  ".W": "Barrett's esophagus is considered to be a premalignant condition, and long-term surveillance seems mandatory with a careful search for dysplasia and carcinoma by means of multiple and repeated sets of biopsies. Reliable nonhistologic markers indicative of dysplasia or developing carcinoma are not yet available. To investigate development of dysplasia and carcinoma a prospective follow-up study was performed on 50 patients with Barrett's esophagus, without carcinoma at entrance to the study, for a period of 1.5-14 yr (mean, 5.2 yr). Barrett's epithelium was classified as fundic type, junctional or cardia type, or specialized columnar type. When classification in one of these three types was not possible because of lack of the characteristic features of the epithelia, the epithelium was classified as intermediate type. At entrance to the study, low-grade dysplasia was found in 6 patients, high-grade in 1 patient. During follow-up, dysplasia increased in frequency as well as in severity and was found almost exclusively in the specialized columnar- and intermediate-type epithelium. At the end of the observation period dysplasia had been found in 13 patients, in 10 scored as low-grade and in 3 as high-grade, and adenocarcinoma had developed in another 5 patients. This prospective study shows an incidence of carcinoma in Barrett's esophagus of 1 in 52 patient-years, a 125-fold increase compared with the general Dutch population. A sequence of worsening of dysplasia with development of carcinoma was observed in specialized columnar and intermediate-type epithelium. The results of this study support the need for a long-term clinical, endoscopic, and histologic follow-up program in patients with Barrett's esophagus.\r"

  ".W": "The actions of cisapride on electrical behavior of single myenteric neurons and on the propulsive activity of segments of ileum were studied in vitro. Cisapride (10-300 nM) did not affect the membrane potential, resting properties, or active properties of S neurons. The amplitude of fast nicotinic excitatory postsynaptic potentials recorded from S cells was increased by cisapride in the concentration range of 10 nM to 1 microM. Higher cisapride concentrations (3-10 microM) reduced the amplitude of fast excitatory postsynaptic potentials. Potentiation of fast excitatory postsynaptic potentials by cisapride was antagonized by ICS 205-930 (1 microM) but was unaffected by GR 38032F (1 microM), both compounds being 5-HT3-receptor antagonists. Cisapride did not modify the electrical behavior of AH neurons except at the highest concentrations (3-10 microM), which caused hyperpolarization of some neurons. The propulsive efficiency (i.e., number of peristalses and total amount of fluid ejected per unit of time) of isolated segments of ileum was enhanced by cisapride (100 nM to 3 microM). Higher cisapride concentrations (6 or 10 microM) had a depressant action on propulsive activity. The stimulatory effect of cisapride on propulsion was not antagonized by ICS 205-930 (300 nM or 1 microM). These data indicate that cisapride facilitates cholinergic transmission in the myenteric plexus of guinea pig ileum and that this effect may be at least partially responsible for the increased propulsive efficiency observed in ileal segments.\r"

  ".U": "89196815\r", 
  ".W": "The aim of this study was to correlate the movement of colonic luminal contents with the changes in intraluminal pressure. Studies were performed in 9 healthy volunteers. Intraluminal pressure was measured with perfused catheter ports in the transverse, splenic flexure, descending, and sigmoid colon. Movement of the luminal contents was measured by following the movement of technetium 99m-ethylenetriamine-pentaacetic acid that was instilled as a bolus in the splenic flexure. During fasting there was very little change in pressure or in the movement of intraluminal contents. After eating a 1000-kcal meal, the tracer moved from the splenic flexure into the transverse colon and the sigmoid colon. Nonpropagating colonic motor activity increased in all colonic segments immediately after eating the meal (p less than 0.05). The increase in motility was significantly greater in the descending colon than in the transverse and sigmoid colon (p less than 0.05). In one-half of the subjects propagating contractions occurred postprandially. The movement of the intraluminal tracer occurred during both types of motility. The nonpropagating contractions were associated with a gradual movement of the luminal contents. The direction of the movement of the contents was determined by the differences in pressure in the different segments of the colon. The propagating contractions were associated with a rapid movement of intraluminal contents. These studies suggest that (a) colonic motility and transit are quiescent during fasting and (b) the transverse colon acts as a mixing and storage area, as retrograde transit into the transverse colon is the characteristic postprandial pattern.\r"

  ".W": "The natural history of duodenal lesions was studied in 20 patients with familial adenomatosis coli/Gardner's syndrome. These patients were followed for an average of 7.1 yr (range 1 yr, 7 mo to 12 yr, 2 mo) and repeatedly examined by hypotonic duodenography, duodenofiberscopy, and biopsy. Tubular adenomas of the duodenum (less than 8 mm in diameter) were present in 18 (90%). During the follow-up period, there was a slight increase or decrease in the number of duodenal adenomas in 4 patients but no distinct change in 13. In the remaining patient (aged 49 yr), a polypoid lesion (17 mm in diameter) of the duodenal bulb, which had been overlooked at the initial examination, became an advanced cancer (50 x 30 mm in size) during 22 mo. Tubular adenomatous tissue of the duodenal papilla was detected in 11 patients (55%). Follow-up study of the lesions revealed no change in endoscopic and histologic findings in all but 1 patient, in whom there was a slight enlargement of the duodenal papilla, as seen at endoscopy. These findings suggest to us that in patients with this disease, duodenal adenomas do not require prophylactic surgery. However, careful repeated follow-up examinations with endoscopic biopsy should be performed, with endoscopic removal of larger polyps when possible.\r"

  ".W": "We have established a large library of monoclonal antibodies against a human hepatoma cell line called FOCUS. One such monoclonal antibody (SF-25) detects a 125-kilodalton cell surface antigen found on FOCUS cells. As both the liver and the colon are of endodermal origin, we examined the possibility of expression in colon adenocarcinomas. This antigen was found in all 23 colon adenocarcinoma tissues surgically obtained but was absent in the adjacent normal mucosal counterpart as determined by a direct radioimmunohistologic technique. In the present study, we have established a model for human metastatic colon adenocarcinoma using the LS 180 cell line. Athymic mice were further immunosuppressed by intravenous injection of anti-NK cell antibodies (antiasialo GM1). After 24 h, mice were injected with LS 180 cells either via the tail vein or into the spleen followed by splenectomy. Macroscopic pulmonary and lymphatic metastasis developed within 2-3 wk after injection of cells and 9 of 10 mice died with advanced metastatic disease 2-3 wk later. In addition, macroscopic hepatic metastases were evident in 4 of 5 mice 3-4 wk after intrasplenic injection. Both hepatic as well as pulmonary and lymphatic tumor spread was localized by nuclear imaging with 125I-SF-25. Furthermore, micrometastases were detected by autoradiography 5-10 days later. Monoclonal antibody SF-25 is a potential candidate for tumor localization and the experimental metastatic colon cancer animal model may be useful for treatment evaluation of monoclonal antibody SF-25 either alone or in combination with other monoclonal antibodies when conjugated to radionucleotides and chemotherapeutic agents.\r"

Intraduodenal infusion of oleic acid emulsion in a dose of 18 mmol/h resulted in a significant increase in pancreatic secretion of water, bicarbonate, and protein, which was accompanied by increased plasma concentrations of both secretin and cholecystokinin. Infusion of pancreatic juice or bovine trypsin into the duodenum significantly inhibited the oleic acid-stimulated pancreatic secretion. This inhibition coincided with a significant decrease in plasma secretin level, whereas plasma cholecystokinin concentration was not affected by either pancreatic juice or trypsin. Neither pancreatic secretion nor plasma secretin concentration was affected by intraduodenal administration of NaHCO3 solution. The trypsin-induced suppression of pancreatic secretion was prevented by intravenous administration of secretin in a dose that achieved a plasma secretin level comparable to that during the oleic acid administration. This study indicates that a negative feedback mechanism is operative in the intestinal phase of pancreatic exocrine secretion in dogs, and endogenous secretin plays a significant role in the mechanism.\r"

At the time of surgery a stonelike lesion of this ductal orifice was found along with a miliary pattern of infection of the left liver lobe.

Results of a study of a patient with hyperglucagonemia and necrolytic migratory erythema complicating untreated celiac disease are reported. Whereas pancreatic glucagon was only mildly elevated, there was marked elevation of enteroglucagon. Immunofluorescence staining demonstrated numerous (19.6 cells per square millimeter of mucosa) enteroglucagon-positive small intestinal crypt cells. Treatment with gluten-free diet not only resulted in resolution of malabsorption and improvement in small intestinal histology but was paralleled by disappearance of necrolytic migratory erythema, normalization of plasma glucagon levels, and marked reduction in the number of enteroglucagon-producing crypt cells (0.2/mm2 mucosa). The findings demonstrate that necrolytic migratory erythema is not an exclusively paraneoplastic phenomenon and that it can occur in association with excess production of enteroglucagon by the intestinal mucosa.\r"

However, a substantial number of blood donors with elevated aminotransferase levels will have other hepatobiliary diseases, including primary sclerosing cholangitis.

Total prostaglandin formation and the prostaglandin profile as well as the degradation of PGE2 were assayed by incubating homogenates of endoscopic biopsies from antral and duodenal mucosa with the precursor (14C)arachidonic acid. Total prostaglandin synthesis in antrum (623 (110) pmol/mg protein) and duodenum (432 (72) pmol/mg) was stimulated after three weeks administration of low dose antacids by 176% (p less than 0.05) and 154% (p less than 0.05), respectively. An untreated control group exhibited no significant changes. In contrast, the prostaglandin profile showed only a small increase of the prostacyclin metabolite 6-keto PGF1a (p less than 0.05) at the expense PGD2. PGE2 catabolism was unaffected. This enhanced activity of mucosal prostaglandin cyclooxygenase might represent one possible mechanism of action of a low dose antacid treatment.\r"

  ".W": "Low level chemiluminescence of exposed rat intestine was measured during occlusive ischaemia and reperfusion. Spontaneous emission of in vivo rat intestine (10 +/- 1 cps/cm2) decreased almost to zero in animals subjected to ischaemia and when the period of ischaemia lasted only two minutes, chemiluminescence increased beyond control levels (39%, three minutes after reperfusion) at intestine deligation. This overshoot did not occur when rats were pretreated with allopurinol (40 + 100 mg/kg bw). The ratio of xanthine dehydrogenase to xanthine oxidase activities was 3.46 in preischaemic intestine samples. The same ratio was changed to 0.35 in samples subjected to two minutes of ischaemia. As chemiluminescence appears to reflect the steady state level of singlet oxygen, which in turn derives from the steady state level of peroxy radicals, these results agree with the view that oxygen radicals derived from the xanthine oxidase reaction are involved in the cellular damage produced after ischaemia and reoxygenation in the intestine.\r"

  ".W": "Methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) rapidly dissolves cholesterol gall stones in vitro and in vivo. To further characterise tolerability and safety of this aliphatic ether, either MTBE (1 ml/kg body wt daily for two days) or an equal amount of saline was infused into the common bile duct (CBD) of eight cholecystectomised rabbits. Transient vomiting, dyspnoea and somnolence developed during MTBE instillation. Post-treatment values of serum transaminases and alkaline phosphatase were significantly higher in MTBE than in saline treated animals. Cholangiography one week after the last intraductal infusion showed a five-fold increase of CBD size in MTBE v control rabbits. At autopsy histological signs of chemical cholangitis and mild duodenitis were noted in MTBE treated animals. Prompted by these findings, we performed a cholangiography in two patients who had received intraductal MTBE (about 0.2 ml/kg body wt daily for one or two days) one year before: an abnormal dilatation of the CBD was present, which might represent a specific, hitherto undescribed permanent sequela of MTBE administration.\r"

  ".W": "A new specific method for determination of cholecystokinin, CCK-8, and CCK-33, 39 in rat plasma is described. Plasma CCK radioimmunoassay (RIA) is difficult, because of cross-reactivity with gastrin. In the rat, problems because of difficulties in separating gastrin from CCK by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) exist. These were solved by enzyme digestion of gastrin before HPLC separation of molecular variants of CCK from gastrin fragments. Cholecystokinin immunoreactive forms in the HPLC fractions were determined by an antibody, which recognises the carboxyl terminus of CCK and gastrin. Fasting concentrations of small (CCK-8) and large (CCK-33, 39) molecular forms of CCK averaged 1.9 (0.3) pM and were raised to 13.4 (3.8) pM in rats fed ad libitum. Cholecystokinin in lactating rats rose two-fold after suckling, compared with 2.8 fold in response to feeding. The basal ratio between CCK-8 and CCK-33, 39 was approximately 1:1, but increased in favour of CCK-8 after feeding and in response to suckling. Gastrin like immunoreactivity measured in unextracted plasma was found to rise after feeding, but was unchanged in response to suckling.\r"

  ".W": "In 40 patients with cirrhosis and oesophageal varices transmural variceal pressure was assessed endoscopically by fine needle puncture and related to endoscopic signs as well as to the severity of liver disease. Transmural pressure was significantly (p less than 0.01) higher in the presence of a red colour sign (26.7 (7.8) cm H2O) than in its absence (19.1 (6.6) cm H2O). Transmural pressure, however, was not significantly related to diameter or number of varices (diameter greater than 5 mm: 23.7 (8.4), diameter less than or equal to 5 mm: 22.2 (7.9) cm H2O; number greater than 3: 23.2 (8.0), number less than or equal to 3: 22.2 (7.8) cm H2O). The Child status (Child A: 23.9 (8.0), Child B/C: 21.3 (8.1) cm H2O) and individual Child-Pugh parameters including ascites (ascites present: 23.2 (8.3) cm H2O ascites absent: 22.8 (8.1) cm H2O) were not significantly related to transmural variceal pressure. We conclude that the endoscopic visibility of a red colour sign on the varices is associated with a high transmural oesophageal variceal pressure. Our results favour the hypothesis that variceal pressure may be of major importance for the development of the red colour sign.\r"

Histology of the oesophageal mucosa showed a deep chronic eosophagitis, and the 24-hour pH-monitoring of the upper oesophagus showed frequent gastro-oesophageal refluxes. Manometry showed hypotonic lower oesophageal sphincter with marked alterations of peristalsis. In the patient with tracheostomy a 24 pH monitoring of the hypolaryngeal zone showed decreased pH at the time of choking attacks. In the other patient further investigations showed that amyotrophic lateral sclerosis was the cause of the oesophageal motility disorder. An intense antireflux treatment abolished the respiratory attacks in both patients.\r"

Chondrosarcoma, osteosarcoma, and fibrosarcoma were common diagnoses. There were twenty-three iliosacral, twenty-five acetabular, and twelve ischiopubic lesions. Most of the resections were done with a wide margin and disruption of femorosacral continuity. Reconstruction included ten iliosacral, fourteen iliofemoral, and three ischiofemoral arthrodeses, and approximately 50 per cent of the procedures resulted in fusion. The average length of follow-up exceeded five years. Seventeen per cent of the patients, primarily those in whom an iliosacral lesion extended into the sacrum or along the spinal column, had a local recurrence. Twenty-one patients (37 per cent) had metastasis. The best functional results were seen after resections in which femorosacral continuity was maintained or reconstructed. If satisfactory margins can be achieved by the excision of a pelvic tumor, salvage of the limb is justified from both an oncological and a functional standpoint.\r"

All of the patients had Class-IV functional capacity, and 92 per cent had Stage-III or IV rheumatoid progression. Nine (38 per cent) of the shoulders had a tear of the rotator cuff. The mean length of clinical follow-up was 4.5 years (range, two to ten years). Preoperatively, all of the patients had disabling pain and limited function. Postoperatively, twenty-two (92 per cent) of the patients had no appreciable pain, and eighteen (75 per cent) had no significant functional limitation (p less than 0.001). Active elevation improved by 88 per cent, and external and internal rotation also improved significantly. Motion, relief of pain, and functional improvement were not significantly greater in the patients who had an intact rotator cuff. Radiolucent lines developed around ten (42 per cent) of the glenoid prostheses, but only two of the prostheses were surrounded by a complete line and were thought to be loose. No revisions were done. We believe that a non-constrained total shoulder replacement affords excellent relief of pain, satisfactorily improves range of motion, and improves function in patients who have severe rheumatoid involvement of the shoulder. However, because motion and function are severely restricted preoperatively, the end-results are not comparable with those that have been reported for patients who have less severe rheumatoid disease.\r"

An age-matched control group of fifty-one patients who had similar symptoms, but whose arthrograms showed normal results, was used to establish a baseline incidence of ten specific radiographic findings in the shoulder. Two discrete groups of patients who had a tear of the rotator cuff were identified. Twenty-eight patients (27 per cent) had a tear of a single tendon; the histories and the physical and radiographic findings in this group were consistent with a symptomatic local mechanical-impingement process in the shoulder. Sixty (80 per cent) of the seventy-five patients in the other group had a history of acute trauma to a shoulder. The patients in this second group were older and were non-athletic, and had not previously had symptoms that were severe enough to need treatment. These patients were subsequently found to have a complete tear of more than one of the tendons of the rotator cuff. Multiple radiographic findings in the shoulder and other coexisting orthopaedic conditions also were more common in these patients. In this group, we believe that acute trauma in a shoulder that had chronic degenerative changes, rather than localized mechanical impingement, caused the tendons to rupture.\r"

Postoperatively, the average flexion was 115 degrees; extension, 35 degrees; and pronation and supination, 95 degrees. There were fifteen excellent or good results. There was one failure due to a deep infection, but after removal of the prosthesis a satisfactory fascial arthroplasty was achieved in this elbow. Function was improved in all patients, and all patients had relief of the preoperative pain. For the arthroplasty to succeed, the patient must have a good understanding of the procedure and must be willing and able to comply with the postoperative rehabilitation program. The use of a semiconstrained, often custom-fit, implant is necessary. The Bryan-Morrey posteromedial approach to the elbow is recommended for the procedure, since this approach allows early institution of range-of-motion exercises.\r"

  ".W": "The cases of twenty-six patients who had a reconstructive surgical procedure for treatment of a malunion of a displaced fracture of the fibula were evaluated. In these patients, who had pain, swelling of the ankle, and stiffness at an average of six years after the injury, the malunions were classified radiographically as either occult (eighteen patients) or overt (eight patients). An occult malunion was one in which the talus remained in its normal position, but the lateral malleolus showed residual displacement, characterized by external rotation and shortening. In an overt malunion, there were similar changes in the lateral malleolus, but the talus was displaced. All of the patients were treated by osteotomy of the lateral malleolus to correct the external rotation and shortening, to reduce the lateral subluxation of the anterior aspect of the tibiofibular joint, and to restore the stability of the talus. At an average follow-up of seven years (range, six months to eleven years), twenty of the twenty-six patients were able to resume the preinjury level of activity; three had improvement in the ability to walk and in the level of functional activity, although they still had intermittent pain; and three had not benefited from the procedure.\r"

The complications included transient paresthesias, massive swelling of the thigh with myonecrosis, acute renal failure secondary to myoglobinuria, and arterial insufficiency that resulted in a below-the-knee amputation. In order to elucidate the causes of the complications, the external pressure of the contralateral femoral triangle and the blood flow to the contralateral foot were monitored intraoperatively in seventeen patients. The results supported the postulate that pressure at the groin is increased intraoperatively and that this can cause vascular compromise. Other proposed causes of the complications were pre-existing vascular disease, obesity, the lateral decubitus position of the patient on the operating table, and the use of hypotensive anesthesia. We found several techniques that may minimize complications in the contralateral limb during operations on the hip.\r"

  ".W": "The use of survivorship analysis requires an assumption that patients who are lost to follow-up are no more or less likely to be at risk of failure of an operation or a procedure than are patients who are still being followed. This is a major assumption in long-term orthopaedic studies, in which a high percentage of patients are usually lost to follow-up. We compared the survivorship curve for the first 100 Tharies replacements done at our institution (which were completed by September 1977), using data that were collected in the standard way up to 1985, through a letter requesting a follow-up visit, with the curve for the same patients that was based on almost complete follow-up data that were gathered by telephone from 1985 on. The similarity of the two curves suggested that the assumptions that are necessary for the validity of survivorship analysis are reasonable, even in the orthopaedic setting, in which many patients are lost to follow-up. The usefulness of the survivorship curve for prediction was also evaluated by comparing the curve based on the first forty-six of the 100 Tharies replacements (before 1977) with the curve based on the last fifty-four such operations (from January 1977 to September 1977). The results of these two comparisons suggest that survivorship analysis is a valid technique to use in the long-term evaluation of patients who have had a joint replacement.\r"

Twenty-two patients had cerebral palsy and twenty-four had another neuromuscular disease. In thirty-nine patients, the arthrodesis was extended to the sacrum. Eleven patients who had severe scoliosis as well as pelvic obliquity and decompensation of the torso had a combined anterior and posterior arthrodesis; the other thirty-five patients had a one-stage posterior procedure. Preoperatively, the average scoliosis was 74 degrees; this was corrected to 39 degrees at follow-up. Final corrections were similar for scoliosis and were better for pelvic obliquity and decompensation of the torso in patients who had combined anterior and posterior arthrodesis. The results for scoliosis and pelvic obliquity in patients who had a spastic deformity were similar to the results in patients who had a flaccid deformity. Correction of decompensation of the torso was better in patients who had a spastic deformity. Postoperatively, a brace was used in half of the patients in each group; this did not appear to affect the amount of correction in either group, although the result may have been influenced by the selection process. The rate of complications was 48 per cent. Pseudarthrosis occurred in three patients (6.5 per cent). There were no major neurological deficits related to the correction or to the use of sublaminar wires. Three patients died, one in the immediate postoperative period and the other two at eighteen months and four years after the original procedure, due to causes unrelated to the operation.\r"

Kinetic and kinematic data were acquired using infrared video cameras and force platforms; electromyographic data were obtained using surface electrodes. Velocity and cadence were decreased and stride time and double-limb support time were increased in the patients who had Paget disease compared with the control subjects. Frequently, the knee of the limb that was affected by Paget disease was flexed during stance and flexed less during swing. When the involved knee was in varus angulation it also had an increased adduction moment, which may be related to the bowing deformity. Although the patterns of ground-reaction force were similar in the patients and the control subjects, the magnitudes of forces were reduced in the patients. Phasic muscle activity was similar in the two groups.\r"

These differences included increased synthesis of proteoglycan and collagen in the larger chondrocytes. Radiolabeled hypertrophic chondrocytes were mixed with unlabeled resting and proliferating chondrocytes, and then were separated by elutriation. The radioactivity was recovered in fractions that contained the largest cells, confirming that differences in the sizes of the cells can be used to effect a zonal separation by centrifugal elutriation.\r"

Invest. 72:379-387). In the current study, the structure of apo E from the propositus of this family was determined using both protein and DNA analyses. The propositus is heterozygous for two different apo E alleles, one coding for normal apo E3 and one for a previously undescribed variant apo E3 in which arginine replaces cysteine at residue 112 and cysteine replaces arginine at residue 142. Apo E gene analysis of nine other family members spanning four generations indicated that only those five members having type III hyperlipoproteinemia possess the variant apo E3. Like the propositus, all five are heterozygous for this variant, suggesting that the disorder in this family is transmitted in a dominant fashion. The variant apo E3 was defective in its ability to bind to lipoprotein receptors, and this functional defect probably contributes to the expression of type III hyperlipoproteinemia in this family.\r"

  ".W": "To investigate the regulation of expression of cardiac Ca2+ + Mg2+-dependent ATPase (Ca2+-ATPase) in sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), we isolated cDNA (pHA6) encoding a Ca2+-ATPase of rat cardiac SR. The clone consisted of 2,311 mRNA-derived nucleotides, which covered half the coding region and the entire 3'-untranslated regions. The nucleotides and deduced amino acid sequences of pHA6 showed striking homology, 89 and 98%, respectively, to those of rabbit Ca2+-ATPase of the slow-twitch form. Northern blot analyses revealed that the mRNA levels of Ca2+-ATPase were decreased by pressure overload and became 32% of sham in 1 mo. During the developmental stage the mRNA levels were very low in the fetal period and steeply increased around birth. These changes in mRNA levels were correlated with the corresponding protein levels. These results suggest that the expression of cardiac Ca2+-ATPase in SR is regulated by pressure overload and the developmental stage, at least in part, at the pretranslational level.\r"

  ".U": "89198062\r", 
  ".W": "Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) administration produces an increase in plasma triglycerides that may be due to inhibition of adipose lipoprotein lipase activity and/or a stimulation of hepatic lipogenesis. We now report that TNF administration to insulinopenic diabetic rats increases serum triglycerides (2 h, 2.4-fold; 17 h, 4.3-fold). Adipose tissue lipoprotein lipase activity was markedly decreased in diabetic animals compared with controls and was not further inhibited by TNF. Incorporation of tritiated water into fatty acids in the liver was increased 45% 1-2 h after TNF and 87% at 16-17 h. These results indicate that the TNF-induced increase in circulating lipid levels can occur in the absence of a TNF-induced inhibition of adipose tissue lipoprotein lipase activity. Moreover, the clearance from the circulation of triglycerides in chylomicrons was similar in control and TNF-treated animals; these results provide further evidence that the removal of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins is not altered in the TNF-treated animals. Our data suggest that the TNF-induced stimulation of hepatic lipid synthesis may play an important role in the increase in serum triglycerides. In addition, TNF administration to diabetic animals leads to an elevation in serum glucose levels (73% at 17 h) without a change in serum insulin levels. Thus, TNF stimulation of hepatic lipogenesis is independent of changes in insulin.\r"

After 21 d in culture, the endothelial cell monolayer displayed in vivo-like intercellular borders and junctions, deposited a single-layered, continuous basement membrane that was impenetrable to colloidal particles, and supported neutrophil extravasation in a physiologic manner. Using this model, we demonstrate that neutrophil transmigration in a plasma milieu was associated with a significant disruption of the retentive properties of the basement membrane in the absence of discernable morphologic changes. The loss of basement membrane integrity associated with neutrophil diapedesis was not dependent on neutrophil elastase or cathepsin G and was resistant to inhibitors directed against neutrophil collagenase, gelatinase, and heparanase. Despite the fact that this loss in matrix integrity could not be prevented, basement membrane defects were only transiently expressed before they were repaired by the overlying endothelium via a mechanism that required active protein and RNA synthesis. These data indicate that neutrophil extravasation and reversible basement membrane disruption are coordinated events that occur as a consequence of vessel wall transmigration.\r"

  ".U": "89198064\r", 
  ".W": "Prior studies, both in vitro and in vivo, have suggested that cutaneous porphyrin photosensitization requires the generation of superoxide anion (.O2-) and various other reactive oxygen metabolites. No unifying concept has emerged, however, that unequivocally demonstrates the source of generation of these species. Since xanthine oxidase is known to generate .O2- in reperfused ischemic tissue and in certain inflammatory disorders, we attempted to assess its role in porphyrin photosensitization. C3H mice were rendered photosensitive by the intraperitoneal administration of dihematoporphyrin ether (DHE) (5 mg/kg) followed by irradiation with visible light. Murine ear swelling was used as a marker of the acute photosensitization response and involvement of oxygen radicals was evaluated using electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy. The administration of allopurinol, a potent inhibitor of xanthine oxidase, afforded 90% protection against DHE-mediated acute photosensitivity in vivo. Furthermore, xanthine oxidase activity was twofold higher in the skin of photosensitized mice than in unirradiated animals. ESR spectra of 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide-trapped radicals from the skin of photosensitized mice verified the presence of .O2- and .OH, while neither of these species was detected in the skin of control mice or mice receiving allopurinol. The administration of a soybean trypsin inhibitor or verapamil before irradiation also partially blocked the photosensitivity response, suggesting that calcium-dependent proteases play a role in the activation of xanthine oxidase in this photodynamic process. These data provide in vivo evidence for the involvement of .O2- in DHE-mediated cutaneous photosensitization and suggest that these radicals are generated through the activation of the xanthine oxidase pathway. The administration of allopurinol and calcium channel blockers may thus offer new approaches for the treatment of cutaneous porphyrin photosensitization.\r"

We explored the potential regulatory effects of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) on these processes. We found that cultured mouse glomerular endothelial, mesangial, and epithelial cells as well as isolated intact rat glomeruli possess high-affinity receptors for TGF-beta. We also found that, although TGF-beta consistently inhibited the proliferation of glomerular endothelial and epithelial cells, it acted as a bifunctional regulator of mesangial cell proliferation. TGF-beta significantly increased the production of collagen and fibronectin by glomerular mesangial cells whereas only fibronectin production was augmented in glomerular epithelial cells. The presence of TGF-beta receptors on intact glomeruli and on each glomerular cell type and the demonstrated responsiveness of these cells to TGF-beta combine to suggest that potentially important interactions may occur between resident glomerular cells and TGF-beta in vivo.\r"

We used cDNA probes to examine regulation of these proteins in human fetal lung. The mRNAs were detectable at 13 wk gestation and increased to approximately 50% (SP-B) and approximately 15% (SP-C) of adult levels at 24 wk. The mRNAs were detected only in lung of 11 dog tissues examined. When human fetal lung was cultured as explants without hormones, SP-B mRNA increased and SP-C mRNA decreased. Exposure for 48 h to glucocorticoids, but not other steroids, increased both SP-B mRNA (approximately 4-fold) and SP-C mRNA (approximately 30-fold) vs. controls. Half-maximal stimulation occurred with 1 nM dexamethasone and 300 nM cortisol for SP-B mRNA and at three- to fivefold higher concentrations for SP-C mRNA. Both stimulation and its reversal on removal of hormone were more rapid for SP-B than for SP-C. Terbutaline and forskolin increased SP-B mRNA but not SP-C mRNA. Levels of both mRNAs were much higher in type II cells than fibroblasts prepared from explants. Thus, the genes for SP-B and SP-C are expressed in vivo before synthesis of both SP-A (28,000-36,000 D) and surfactant lipids. Glucocorticoid induction of SP-B and SP-C mRNAs in type II cells appears to be receptor mediated but may involve different mechanisms.\r"

Most HIV Ab- and HIV Ab+ individuals' lymphocytes, however, could proliferate or be induced by rIL-2 to proliferate in response to lysates of Escherichia coli or Saccharomyces cerevisiae. These findings indicate selective defects in lymphocyte proliferative responses to HIV antigens before the development of AIDS in which lymphocytes are unable to proliferate in response to any antigens. These defects in cell-mediated immune responses to HIV antigens are likely to play an important role in the pathobiology of HIV infections. Although intact HIV or glycosylated gp120 envelope protein of HIV are involved in these defects, a non-glycosylated recombinant form of the HIV gp120 envelope (ENV2-3) and p25 core proteins did not inhibit antigen- or mitogen-driven lymphocyte proliferation.\r"

Considerable heterogeneity is seen, far exceeding that published in prior reports. Gel filtration HPLC yielded a major peak at molecular weight 30,000 and minor peaks at 50,000 and 12,000. Reverse-phase HPLC gave one major fraction in the void volume and an eluted peak at 50-60% acetonitrile. Accell QMA anion exchange HPLC revealed three peaks of activity; one in the void volume similar to that published previously using QAE-Sephadex, and peaks that eluted at 0.5 and 0.8 M ammonium acetate, respectively. Electroelution following SDS-PAGE yielded peaks at MW 12,000 and 15-17,000 plus variable peaks at 25-27,000, 31-34,000, and 80-90,000 D. Using a combination of the aforementioned procedures, we have purified molecular species of HRF at 41,000 and 17,000 D to apparent homogeneity, as judged by SDS PAGE and autoradiography. Since human interleukin 3 and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor possess histamine-releasing capability, it is clear that multiple cytokines can share this activity. However, the major HRF we isolate from human mononuclear cells appears, thus far, to be unique.\r"

  ".U": "89198074\r", 
  ".W": "Elevated serum estradiol concentrations and specific changes in the biliary excretion of some androstenedione metabolites have been reported in male rats with portal bypass produced by portal vein ligation (PVL). In this study, the hypothesis that male-specific forms of cytochrome P-450 are altered after PVL was tested by measuring microsomal steroid hydroxylase activities. Consistent with earlier findings in the intact animal, androstenedione 16 alpha-hydroxylase activity was reduced after PVL to 44% of control (P less than 0.05). Other pathways of androstenedione hydroxylation, and total estrogen formation (after androstenedione aromatization) were unchanged. Although total estrogen formation was not different, a sevenfold greater proportion of estradiol was produced in PVL rat microsomes. Additional experiments revealed that PVL selectively reduced the rate of microsomal estradiol 16 alpha-hydroxylation (to 56% of control, P less than 0.02). Levels of cytochrome P-450UT-A, the microsomal steroid 16 alpha-hydroxylase, were lower after PVL (56% of control, P less than 0.05), so that the present observations are consistent with the earlier suggestion that portal bypass is associated with the selective downregulation of this enzyme. Since downregulation of cytochrome P-450UT-A also occurs in experimental hepatic cirrhosis, portal hypertension may well contribute significantly to altered drug metabolism in liver disease. Impaired hepatic elimination of androstenedione by hydroxylation may indirectly enhance extrahepatic aromatization of the androgen. The decreased activity of hepatic estradiol 16 alpha-hydroxylation after PVL would enhance the accumulation of estradiol, the biologically more potent estrogen.\r"

This study assessed the effects of NPY on the coronary circulation in 40 chloralose-anesthetized, open-chest dogs. Intracoronary NPY (42 nmol over 5.2 min) caused a 39% reduction in coronary blood flow without changing heart rate or aortic pressure. To determine whether this vasoconstriction could produce ischemia, intramyocardial pH was measured in seven dogs (group I) and decreased from 7.45 +/- 0.06 to 7.37 +/- 0.06 pH units after NPY in the subendocardium (P less than 0.0002), and from 7.45 +/- 0.06 to 7.40 +/- 0.05 pH units (P less than 0.04) in the subepicardium of the infused zone. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), measured by radionuclide angiography, decreased from 0.52 +/- 0.08 to 0.42 +/- 0.12 U (n = 5, P less than 0.01) during NPY. NPY-induced vasoconstriction was also associated with ST-T wave changes on the electrocardiogram (ECG) in eight of nine other animals (group V). In another group of six dogs (group IV), the change in small vessel resistance accounted for 94% of the increase in total resistance, so that the primary vasoconstrictor effect of NPY was exerted on small coronary arteries. Thus, NPY, a peptide found in human coronary arteries, caused constriction of primarily small coronary arteries that was severe enough to produce myocardial ischemia as determined by ECG ST-T wave changes, and decreases in intramyocardial pH and LVEF in dogs.\r"

Na+ uptake into hepatocytes was stimulated approximately 10-fold by 25 mM extracellular HCO3-.HCO3--stimulated Na+ uptake was saturable, abolished by 4-acetamido-4'-isothiocyano-2,2'-disulfonic acid stilbene (SITS), and unaffected by amiloride or Cl- removal. Neither propionate nor acetate reproduced this effect of HCO3-. 22Na efflux from preloaded hepatocytes was similarly increased approximately 10-fold by an in greater than out HCO3- concentration gradient. 22Na efflux was also increased by valinomycin and an in greater than out K+ concentration gradient in the presence but not absence of HCO3-. Intracellular pH (pHi) measured with the pH-sensitive fluorochrome 2',7'-bis-(2-carboxyethyl)-5-(and 6-)carboxyfluorescein (BCECF) decreased at a rate of 0.227 (+/- 0.074 SEM) pH units/min when extracellular HCO3- concentration was lowered from 25 to 5 mM at constant PCO2. This intracellular acidification rate was decreased 50-60% in the absence of Na+ or presence of SITS, and was unaffected by amiloride or Cl- removal. Membrane hyperpolarization produced by valinomycin and an in greater than out K+ concentration gradient caused pHi to fall; the rate of fall was decreased 50-70% by Na+ removal or SITS, but not amiloride. An inside positive K+ diffusion potential and a simultaneous out greater than in HCO3- gradient produced a transient 4,4'-diisothiocyano-2,2' disulfonic acid stilbene (DIDS) sensitive, amiloride-insensitive 22Na accumulation in basolateral but not canalicular membrane vesicles. Rat hepatocytes thus exhibit electrogenic basolateral Na+/HCO3- cotransport.\r"

Studies with the cell-free oxidase-activating system from normal neutrophils and from neutrophils obtained from two patients with type II (autosomal recessive cytochrome-positive) chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) have suggested that (a) the defective element in the cytosol from patient neutrophils is S; (b) in normal neutrophil cytosol, S is limiting with respect to M; and (c) C alpha and C beta interact cooperatively with the activated precursor complex [M.S]*. It was further speculated that S might be identical to the nonphosphorylated progenitor of the phosphorylated 48-kD proteins that are missing in certain forms of CGD, and that other forms of type II CGD besides the one described in this report remain to be discovered.\r"

We also cloned and sequenced a rat lung Cu,Zn SOD cDNA that was used to measure Cu,Zn SOD mRNA concentration. We found that (a) under normal gestational and postgestational conditions the synthesis of this enzyme was regulated pretranslationally; (b) the increased synthesis that occurs under hyperoxia (greater than 95% O2), was pretranslationally mediated in otherwise unmanipulated neonatal rats but translationally controlled in hyperoxic adult rats; and (c) in lungs of rats made tolerant to greater than 95% O2 by allowing 24 h rest in air after an initial 48 h in greater than 95% O2, the increased Cu,Zn SOD synthesis that occurred during the second period of hyperoxia was regulated pretranslationally. We conclude Cu,Zn SOD gene expression in the lung is developmentally regulated under normal conditions and in response to an oxidant challenge. Tolerance, whether endogenous or induced, appears to require the accumulation of increased amounts of Cu,Zn SOD mRNA.\r"

Studies were performed on ethanol-fed and pair-fed cells to identify the kinetic parameters of cellular GSH concentration-dependent efflux. The relationship between cytosolic GSH and the rate of efflux was modeled by the Hill equation, revealing a similar Vmax, 0.22 +/- 0.013 vs. 0.20 +/- 0.014 nmol/min per 10(6) cells for ethanol-fed and pair-fed cells, respectively, whereas the Km was significantly decreased (25.3 +/- 2.3 vs. 33.5 +/- 1.4 nmol/10(6) cells) in ethanol-fed cells. The difference in Km was larger when the data were corrected for the increased water content in ethanol-fed cells. We found a direct correlation between mitochondria and cytosolic GSH, revealing that mitochondria from ethanol-fed cells have less GSH at all cytosolic GSH values. The rate of resynthesis in depleted ethanol-fed cells in the presence of methionine and serine was similar to control cells and gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase remained unaffected by chronic ethanol. However, the reaccumulation of mitochondrial GSH as the cytosolic pool increased was impaired in the ethanol cells. The earliest time change in GSH regulation was a 50% decrease in the mitochondrial GSH at 2 wk.\r"

The authenticity of our cDNA clones was demonstrated by the ability of the coding sequences, subcloned in a retroviral expression vector, to mediate expression of bona fide CD13 molecules at the surface of transfected mouse fibroblasts. The nucleotide sequence predicts a 967 amino acid integral membrane protein with a single, 24 amino acid hydrophobic segment near the amino terminus. Amino-terminal protein sequence analysis of CD13 molecules indicated that the hydrophobic segment is not cleaved, but rather serves as both a signal for membrane insertion and as a stable membrane-spanning segment. The remainder of the molecule consists of a large extracellular carboxyterminal domain, which contains a pentapeptide consensus sequence characteristic of members of the zinc-binding metalloprotease superfamily. Sequence comparisons with known enzymes of this class revealed that CD13 is identical to aminopeptidase N, a membrane-bound glycoprotein thought to be involved in the metabolism of regulatory peptides by diverse cell types, including small intestinal and renal tubular epithelial cells, macrophages, granulocytes, and synaptic membranes prepared from cells of the central nervous system.\r"

Hormonal disposal rates were determined after water loading to suppress endogenous AVP release using a constant infusion method designed to achieve three different steady-state concentrations of plasma AVP (PAVP) on each test occasion. Dose schedules were altered in mid- and late pregnancy to obtain comparable AVP levels at each stage of the protocol. Prehydration decreased plasma osmolality sufficiently to suppress AVP release, as circulating AVP-neurophysin measured serially in three of the women was undetectable. The MCR of AVP was similar before conception (0.75 +/- 0.31, 0.79 +/- 0.34, and 0.76 +/- 0.28 liters/min at PAVP of 2.6 +/- 1.9, 4.7 +/- 2.4, and 8.3 +/- 3.9 pg/ml), in early pregnancy (0.89 +/- 0.34, 0.97 +/- 0.04, and 0.95 +/- 0.40 liters/min at PAVP of 2.2 +/- 2.1, 3.9 +/- 3.2, and 7.9 +/- 3.4 pg/ml), and postpartum (0.70 +/- 0.21, 0.69 +/- 0.24, and 0.75 +/- 0.20 liters/min at PAVP 3.5 +/- 1.8, 5.1 +/- 3.7, and 9.1 +/- 4.2 pg/ml).

Plasma vasopressinase, undetectable at 7-8 gestational wk, increased markedly by mid- and slightly more by late gestation. Finally, relationships between PAVP and urine osmolality were similar before, during, and after pregnancy. We conclude that marked increments in the MCR of AVP occur between gestational weeks 7 and 8 and mid-pregnancy, which parallel the period of greatest rise in both trophoblastic mass and plasma vasopressinase. There was no evidence of a renal resistance to AVP during gestation.\r"

  ".W": "To characterize and localize hepatic plasma membrane ATP-dependent Ca2+ transport and Na+/Ca2+ exchange, studies were performed using highly purified rat basolateral and canalicular membrane vesicles. ATP-dependent Ca2+ transport activity was present in vesicles from both domains, insensitive to azide, oligomycin, oxalate, calmodulin, and calmidazolium, and virtually abolished at pH 6.8. However, basolateral and canalicular transport differed significantly. While basolateral transport was markedly stimulated by 1 mM Mg2+, canalicular transport was Mg2+ independent. Basolateral transport was similar at pH 7.4 and 8.0 but canalicular activity was stimulated fourfold at pH 8.0. Both Ca2+ Km [1.4 +/- 0.1 (SE).10(-8) vs. 4.8 +/- 0.7.10(-8) M] and Vmax (3.6 +/- 0.1 vs. 9.0 +/- 0.6 nmol mg-1 protein min-1) were lower in basolateral than in canalicular vesicles. Basolateral transport was somewhat more nucleotide specific (for ATP) and sensitive to vanadate (IC50 130 vs. 500 microM, respectively) than was canalicular transport. Na+/Ca2+ exchange activity was not detected in membranes from either domain. These studies suggest that hepatic ATP-dependent Ca2+ transport is mediated by domain-specific carriers on the basolateral and canalicular membranes.\r"

  ".W": "We have developed a model of reperfusion injury in Krebs buffer-perfused rabbit lungs, characterized by pulmonary vasoconstriction, microvascular injury, and marked lung edema formation. During reperfusion there was a threefold increase in lung superoxide anion (O2-) production, as measured by in vivo reduction of nitroblue tetrazolium, and a twofold increase in the release of O2- into lung perfusate, as measured by reduction of succinylated ferricytochrome c. Injury could be prevented by the xanthine oxidase inhibitor allopurinol, the O2- scavenger SOD, the hydrogen peroxide scavenger catalase, the iron chelator deferoxamine, or the thiols dimethylthiourea or N-acetylcysteine. The protective effect of SOD could be abolished by the anion channel blocker 4,4'-diisothiocyano-2,2'-stilbene disulfonic acid, indicating that SOD consumes O2- in the extracellular medium, thereby creating a concentration gradient favorable for rapid diffusion of O2- out of cells. Our results extend information about the mechanisms of reperfusion lung injury that have been assembled by studies in other organs, and offer potential strategies for improved organ preservation, for treatment of reperfusion injury after pulmonary thromboembolectomy, and for explanation and therapy of many complications of pulmonary embolism.\r"

  ".U": "89198093\r", 
  ".W": "Numerous in vitro studies in experimental animals have demonstrated a direct suppressive effect of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH)2D) on parathyroid hormone (PTH) synthesis. We therefore sought to determine whether such an effect could be demonstrated in uremic patients undergoing maneuvers designed to avoid changes in serum calcium concentrations. In addition, the response of the parathyroid gland in patients undergoing hypercalcemic suppression (protocol I) and hypocalcemic stimulation (protocol II) before and after 2 wk of intravenous 1,25(OH)2D was evaluated. In those enlisted in protocol I, PTH values fell from 375 +/- 66 to 294 +/- 50 pg (P less than 0.01) after 1,25(OH)2D administration. During hypercalcemic suppression, the \"set point\" (PTH max + PTH min/2) for PTH suppression by calcium fell from 5.24 +/- 0.14 to 5.06 +/- 0.15 mg/dl (P less than 0.05) with 1,25(OH)2D. A similar decline in PTH levels after giving intravenous 1,25(OH)2D was noted in protocol II patients. During hypocalcemic stimulation, the parathyroid response was attenuated by 1,25(OH)2D. We conclude that intravenous 1,25(OH)2D directly suppresses PTH secretion in uremic patients. This suppression, in part, appears to be due to increased sensitivity of the gland to ambient calcium levels.\r"

  ".U": "89198095\r", 
  ".W": "Hypertriglyceridemic (HTG) serum, lipolyzed in vitro by purified bovine milk lipoprotein lipase, was found to be cytotoxic to cultured macrophages. Surviving macrophages contained numerous lipid inclusions similar to those found in foam cells. Individual lipoprotein fractions isolated from the lipolyzed HTG serum, including HDL, were also cytotoxic. Lipolysis of isolated lipoprotein fractions (either HTG or normal) allowed localization of cytotoxicity to postlipolysis remnant VLDL and chylomicron particles. The presence of a critical concentration of HDL in either the lipolysis mixture or the culture dishes inhibited the cytotoxicity. Below this critical concentration HDL itself became cytotoxic, producing lipid inclusions in surviving macrophages. The lipid fraction of the cytotoxic remnants contained the cytotoxic factor(s); neither FFA nor lysolecithin alone could account for this cytotoxicity. Postprandial lipemic sera from subjects with a brisk chylomicron response, when lipolyzed in vitro, were cytotoxic to cultured macrophages; neither fasted sera from these subjects, nor postprandial sera from normolipidemic subjects with a normal chylomicron response, were cytotoxic. Postheparin (in vivo lipolyzed) serum and its isolated lipoprotein fractions obtained 30 min after heparin injection in subjects with HTG were shown to be cytotoxic to macrophages; by 60 min most of the cytotoxicity had disappeared. The postprandial and postheparin observations support an in vivo significance for remnant-associated cytotoxicity. We hypothesize that cytotoxic remnants of lipolyzed VLDL and chylomicrons may be one of the major atherogenic lipoproteins. Further, we suggest that inhibition of the cytotoxicity of these remnants may be one important way that HDL prevents atherosclerosis.\r"

We have studied the expression of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) B chain and PDGF A chain, insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I and IGF-II, endothelial cell growth factor (ECGF), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) in aortic tissue from normotensive rats and rats made hypertensive by deoxycorticosterone (DOC)/salt treatment. Using Northern blotting, we found that genes for each of these growth factors were transcriptionally active in the aorta of both normotensive and hypertensive rats. TGF-beta aortic mRNA levels increased up to threefold as a result of DOC/salt hypertension. In contrast, no major changes in the expression of either PDGF chain, IGF-I or II, ECGF, or bFGF were detectable. The results indicate that at least seven genes coding for growth factors that were shown previously to influence growth and function of vascular cells in vitro, are expressed in rat aorta in vivo. These findings support the hypothesis that synthesis and release of growth factors in the arterial wall are involved in autocrine and/or paracrine regulatory mechanisms. In addition, the increased expression of TGF-beta in vivo may have a role in mediating the aortic changes induced by hypertension.\r"

We have studied the etiology of MSUD by determining the enzyme activity, protein, and mRNA levels of BCKDH in fibroblasts from a classic MSUD patient and his parents. By enzymatic amplification of the patient's mRNA followed by cloning and DNA sequencing, we have identified a T to A transversion that alters a tyrosine to an asparagine at residue 394 of the E1 alpha subunit. Amplification of both mRNA and genomic DNA, in combination with allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization, demonstrated that the father was heterozygous for this mutant allele. The mother was homozygous for the allele encoding the normal Tyr394, but expressed only about half of the normal level of mRNA and protein. The patient was genetically heterozygous for this altered allele, although only the abnormal allele was expressed as mRNA. We conclude that the patient was a compound heterozygote, inheriting an allele encoding an abnormal E1 alpha from the father, and an allele from the mother containing a cis-acting defect in regulation which abolished the expression of one of the E1 alpha alleles. Our results revealed for the first time that a case of MSUD was caused by structural and regulatory mutations involving the E1 alpha subunit.\r"

It is concluded that extramedullary spread of myelomatosis in the form of bulky tumour deposits is a rare and ominous mode of tumour progression or relapse. Rises in serum and urinary paraprotein concentrations are not the inevitable signs of relapse.\r"

DNA content, however, did not confer independent prognostic information in a Cox model based on four discrete pathological variables. Patients were classified by a new system of prognostic grouping and those with a very good or a very poor outlook were removed leaving 137 prognostic group III patients. No further substratification of this group by DNA content or by four additional pathological variables could be achieved. As the new prognostic system is not improved by the addition of ploidy, routine adoption of flow cytometry in the assessment of rectal cancer cannot be recommended.\r"

Two slightly different cell preparation and staining techniques were used in the two laboratories. Using strictly defined criteria the histograms were classified blind as diploid, peritetraploid, aneuploid, or inadequate and insufficient by two independent investigators. Both the concordance between the two different flow cytometers and the agreement of duplicate assessments within the same flow cytometers were assessed. The mean coefficient of variation of the G0/G1 peak of the diploid tumours in the PARTEC flow cytometer was 5.5 (range 2.3-9.8) and in the FACS flow cytometer 5.2 (range 3.7-8.3); this difference was not significant. There was concordance of classification between the two laboratories in 35 of 36 cases. In 25 cases (18 diploid, seven aneuploid) the intralaboratory variation showed a 100% concordance in histogram classification.

The results showed an increase in the cell size in the parabasal cell compartment of all the white lesions compared with the normal mucosa. In the spinous cell compartment there was an increase in the cell size in lichen planus and traumatic keratosis; leucoplakia and candidal leucoplakia showed a slight decrease in cell size compared with the normal mucosa.

The degree of villous atrophy was estimated with a Weibel eyepiece graticule, and this correlated strongly with the degree of crypt hyperplasia, which was assessed by deriving the mean number of enterocytes in the crypts. The density of villous intraepithelial lymphocytes fell largely within the normal range, either when expressed in relation to the number of villous enterocytes or in relation to the length of muscularis mucosae. Villous enterocytes showed mild non-specific abnormalities. Pathogens were sought in biopsy sections and in faeces. Crypt hyperplastic villous atrophy occurred at all clinical stages of HIV disease and in the absence of detectable enteropathogens. An analogy was drawn between HIV enteropathy and the small bowel changes seen in experimental graft-versus-host disease. It is suggested that the pathogenesis of villous atrophy is similar in the two states, the damage to the jejunal mucosa in HIV enteropathy being inflicted by an immune reaction mounted in the lamina propria against cells infected with HIV.\r"

A weaker but significant correlation (R = 0.564, p = 0.008) was found between total serum creatine kinase activity and this index of serum cytotoxicity. As it is likely that the concentration of circulating modified protein was largely determined by the quantity of free acetaldehyde generated in the liver and that the AST activity was mainly derived from damaged hepatocytes, the data indicate a correlation between hepatic acetaldehyde generation and hepatocyte damage. This correlation may indicate either that increased quantities of acetaldehyde are released by damaged hepatocytes or that acetaldehyde is hepatotoxic in vivo. As only the creatine kinase isoenzyme present in skeletal muscle (CK-MM) was demonstrable in the serum in all but one of our patients, the data also suggest that circulating modified serum proteins may be toxic towards skeletal muscle cells.\r"

After application of the manufacturer's correction formula to adjust for tube length there was improved correlation (n = 150, r = 0.936, p less than 0.001), but still considerable scatter, between the Seditainer and Westergren results. Seditainer ESR values above 55 mm/first hour should therefore be regarded as semiquantitative. This vacuum extraction method offers a simple and safe technique for measuring the ESR and specimens can be stored overnight at 4 degrees C.\r"

Tissues can be placed briefly in Betapropiolactone before cryostat sectioning without any adverse effect on preservation or antigen expression. It is suggested that use of Betapropiolactone is applicable to tissues harbouring or exposed to the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).

Adjacent cryostat sections from the same tissue block were stained for diagnostic and quantitative histological assessment. The assay was used to illustrate variations in tissue androgen receptor concentration for correlation with epithelial cell content in benign prostate hyperplasia and prostatic cancer, and to show the effects of androgen receptor concentration of resection of prostatic tissue by electroresection. The results indicate that the heat in electroresection renders prostatic tissue unsuitable for androgen receptor assays, and suggest that knowledge of the cellular composition of carcinomatous prostates may be of importance in the full assessment of androgen receptor assay results. This method incorporates both a biochemical assay and histological assessment of the assayed tissue on near-facsimile sections, an advantage over conventional biochemical assays.\r"

  ".W": "The in-hospital course of 500 consecutive patients treated with coronary angioplasty for acute myocardial infarction was reviewed in relation to their clinical and angiographic presentation and angioplasty outcome to determine which patients benefit most from successful angioplasty in this setting. Patient age was 56 +/- 11 years (mean +/- SD) and 78% were men; 46% had anterior myocardial infarction, 49% received concomitant intravenous thrombolytic therapy, left ventricular ejection fraction was 47 +/- 11% and median time to angioplasty was 4.7 h (range 1 to 24). Angioplasty was successful in 78% of patients and partially successful in 7% of patients; the overall in-hospital mortality rate was 10.2%. Multivariate analysis found six independent correlates (p less than 0.05) of in-hospital mortality: left ventricular ejection fraction less than or equal to 30%, lack of postangioplasty infarct artery patency, age greater than 65 years, recurrent ischemia after successful angioplasty, emergency bypass surgery and arterial pressure on admission to the catheterization laboratory less than 100 mm Hg. After consideration of these predictors of survival in multivariate analyses, angioplasty success still was independently correlated with improved in-hospital survival for patients with cardiogenic shock (p = 0.002) and anterior myocardial infarction (p = 0.007). A trend toward an independent beneficial effect of successful angioplasty on survival was also noted in patients with inferior wall infarction and precordial ST segment depression (p = 0.063) and for all patients who were hypotensive on admission to the catheterization laboratory, regardless of the infarct site (p = 0.057).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Mean (+/- SD) lesion stenosis decreased from 88 +/- 10% to 35 +/- 11% (p less than or equal to 0.001), whereas left ventricular ejection fraction increased from 57 +/- 11% to 64 +/- 10% (p less than or equal to 0.001) for the entire group. Left ventricular functional changes were further subgrouped according to stability of angina. Eighteen procedures were performed on 17 patients with stable angina: 24 procedures were performed on 22 patients with unstable angina defined as angina at rest or on minimal activity or recently accelerated angina. There were no significant subgroup differences in mean age, gender ratio, vessel anatomy, drug therapy or extent of coronary stenosis before or after angioplasty. Global ejection fraction increased significantly for the unstable group (from 54 +/- 11% to 66 +/- 9%, p less than or equal to 0.001) but was unchanged for the stable group (from 61 +/- 9% to 61 +/- 11%, p = NS). In unstable angina, regional ejection fraction (segmental area method) increased for both jeopardized (from 37 +/- 11% to 52 +/- 9%, p less than or equal to 0.001) and nonjeopardized myocardial segments (from 43 +/- 13% to 51 +/- 13%, p less than or equal to 0.001), but improvement was significantly (p less than or equal to 0.02) greater in jeopardized segments.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

With dual catheters across the left ventricular outflow tract, the pressure gradient and corresponding left ventricular ejection time were measured in 10 patients as the pressure gradient was pharmacologically provoked or abolished, or both. The patients were studied during constant atrial pacing to avoid the potential errors introduced with heart rate correction equations. The pressure gradient was pharmacologically provoked or reduced over a range of greater than or equal to 62 mm Hg per patient. In each patient the left ventricular ejection time varied directly with the pressure gradient (mean r = 0.97, range 0.92 to 1.00). The change in magnitude of the pressure gradient varied directly with the corresponding change in the measured ejection time (mean r = 0.98, range 0.97 to 1.00). When the data from all 10 patients were pooled with use of Weissler's heart rate correction equation, the relation between the corrected left ventricular ejection time and the pressure gradient was still significant and linear (r = 0.86), but less so than in individual patients. This difference was the result of marked interpatient variability in the slope of this linear relation reflecting interpatient differences in other important factors, such as underlying myocardial contractility and stroke volume, that influence left ventricular ejection time. This study demonstrates a clear, direct and highly significant relation between the magnitude of the pressure gradient and the left ventricular ejection time in hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The patients in the cardiomyopathy and control groups showed a similar degree of clinical and functional impairment. Imaging was undertaken 48 h after antimyosin injection. The heart/lung ratio of antimyosin uptake was used to assess the results. The mean ratio in the cardiomyopathy group was 1.83 +/- 0.36 (range 1.40 to 2.80), a value significantly higher than that obtained in the control patients without cardiomyopathy (mean 1.46 +/- 0.04, range 1.38 to 1.50) or normal subjects (mean 1.46 +/- 0.13, range 1.31 to 1.6) (p less than 0.01).

With use of the short-axis plane, left ventricular mass at end-systole and end-diastole were determined and left ventricular systolic wall thickening at three different levels was assessed. For validation in the current study, cine NMR imaging and two-dimensional echocardiographic measurements of left ventricular volumes were correlated. Left ventricular volumes of the normal volunteers (end-systolic volume = 34 +/- 3.8 ml, end-diastolic volume = 90.4 +/- 7.2 ml) and patients with cardiomyopathy (end-systolic volume = 173 +/- 28.3 ml, end-diastolic volume = 219.5 +/- 29.6 ml) obtained in the transverse plane were nearly identical to those obtained in the short-axis plane (normal volunteers, end-systolic volume = 30.3 +/- 3.5 ml, end-diastolic volume = 84.7 +/- 7.0 ml and patients with cardiomyopathy, end-systolic volume = 179.1 +/- 27.8 ml, end-diastolic volume = 227 +/- 30.9 ml) and correlated highly (r = 0.91) with volumes obtained by two-dimensional echocardiography.

The myocardial thallium concentration in the postexercise images and percent washout were determined in the distribution of the diseased vessel and a normal vessel, and each was expressed as a ratio. Coronary stenosis was assessed as minimal diameter stenosis, minimal area stenosis and percent diameter stenosis. The correlations between the myocardial concentration ratio or washout ratio and the descriptors of coronary stenosis improved when the patients with collateral vessels were excluded. There were significant correlations between the myocardial thallium concentration ratio and minimal diameter stenosis (r = 0.73, p less than 0.001), minimal area stenosis (r = 0.72, p less than 0.001) and, to a lesser degree, percent diameter stenosis (r = -0.51, p less than 0.01). Similarly, there were significant correlations between washout ratio and minimal diameter stenosis (r = 0.50, p less than 0.01) and minimal area stenosis (r = 0.45, p less than 0.02) but not percent diameter stenosis (r = 0.37, p = 0.06). Thus, variation in thallium kinetics in relation to the severity of coronary stenosis can be demonstrated with conventional imaging in patients with one vessel disease. The myocardial thallium concentration and washout are physiologic expressions of the severity of perfusion deficit and are dependent on collateral flow. The myocardial thallium concentration ratio and washout ratio correlate better with minimal diameter and area stenosis than with percent diameter stenosis.\r"

Doppler measurements and catheterization were performed simultaneously before, immediately after and 24 to 48 h after valvuloplasty. A high correlation between Doppler- and catheterization-derived mitral valve areas was found before mitral valvuloplasty (r = 0.81, Y = 0.88X + 0.1, SEE = 0.11 cm2) and 24 to 48 h after valvuloplasty (r = 0.84, Y = 0.70X + 0.67, SEE = 0.20 cm2). In contrast, the correlation immediately after valvuloplasty was only moderate (r = 0.72, Y = 0.43X + 1.1, SEE = 0.49 cm2). The Doppler-derived mitral valve area (2.41 +/- 0.61 cm2) immediately after valvuloplasty was significantly larger than the catheterization-derived area (2.08 +/- 0.39 cm2, p less than 0.05). In conclusion, the Doppler echocardiographic measurement performed with the pressure half-time method may lead to significant error immediately after mitral balloon valvuloplasty, but clinically accurate measurement can be obtained 24 to 48 h after valvuloplasty.\r"

Whether congenital right ventricular pressure overload is associated with a similar phenomenon is uncertain. It is also unknown whether supranormal ejection performance affects only the overloaded ventricle or is a general process affecting both ventricles. Conflicting data exist about whether the hypertrophic process associated with pressure overload is induced primarily by local loading conditions or by neuroendocrine influences. If the former postulate is true, the hypertrophic response should be confined to the overloaded ventricle; if the latter is true, one might predict that both ventricles would be affected by a less specific response to circulating catecholamines. To help resolve these issues, both right and left ventricular performance was examined in seven patients with isolated congenital pulmonary stenosis (average pulmonary pressure gradient 78 +/- 13 mm Hg), six patients with isolated congenital aortic stenosis (average gradient 80 +/- 10 mm Hg) and six normal subjects. Right ventricular ejection fraction was increased in patients with pulmonary stenosis (61 +/- 2%) compared with the value in normal subjects (53 +/- 2%, p less than 0.01) and in patients with aortic stenosis (50 +/- 3%, p = 0.007).

  ".W": "The automatic implantable cardioverter-defibrillator was implanted in 270 patients because of life-threatening arrhythmias over a 7 year period. There was a history of sustained ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation, or both, in 96% of these patients, 80% had one or more prior cardiac arrests and 78% had coronary artery disease as their underlying diagnosis. The average ejection fraction was 34%, and 96% of these patients had had an average of 3.4 antiarrhythmic drug failures per patient before defibrillator implantation. There were four perioperative deaths and eight patients had generator infection or generator erosion, or both, during the perioperative period or during long-term follow-up. Concomitant antiarrhythmic drug therapy was given to 69% of patients. Shocks from the device were given to 58% of patients. and 20% received \"problematic\" shocks. The device was removed from 16 patients during long-term follow-up for a variety of reasons. There were 7 sudden cardiac deaths and 30 nonsudden cardiac deaths, 18 of which were secondary to congestive heart failure. The actuarial incidence of sudden death, total cardiac death and total mortality from all causes was 1%, 7% and 8%, respectively, at 1 year, and 4%, 24% and 26% at 5 years. The automatic implantable cardioverter-defibrillator nearly eliminates sudden death over a long-term follow-up period in a high risk group of patients. It has an acceptable rate of complications or problems, or both, and most late deaths in these patients are nonsudden and of cardiovascular origin.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of ventricular fibrillation duration in humans on defibrillation efficacy as it pertains to the time of intervention of an automatic implantable defibrillator is unknown. If a difference in defibrillation efficacy exists in the early period after ventricular fibrillation onset, it may affect algorithms used by antiarrhythmic devices for arrhythmia detection and therapy. Therefore, a prospective, randomized evaluation was performed of the effect of ventricular fibrillation durations of 10 s and 20 s on defibrillation thresholds in 10 survivors of sudden cardiac arrest undergoing implantation of an automatic cardioverter defibrillator. The initial duration of ventricular fibrillation was chosen randomly. Subsequently, each patient served as his or her own control for the alternate duration of ventricular fibrillation to that chosen initially. The mean leading edge defibrillation threshold voltage was 411 +/- 114 V when ventricular fibrillation persisted for 10 s and 419 +/- 125 V when it persisted for 20 s (p = 0.73). The mean defibrillation threshold current was 11.4 +/- 2.8 A when ventricular fibrillation persisted for 10 s and 11.4 +/- 3.2 A when it persisted for 20 s (p = 0.97). The delivered energy defibrillation threshold was 11.5 +/- 5.9 J when ventricular fibrillation persisted for 10 s and 12.0 +/- 6.9 J when it persisted for 20 s (p = 0.67). These findings show that the defibrillation threshold does not change between 10 and 20 s of ventricular fibrillation in out-of-hospital survivors of cardiac arrest at the time of surgical implantation of an automatic defibrillator. The data may have influence on the programming of defibrillator detection algorithms.\r"

The patients were similar in terms of age, smoking habit, serum cholesterol and blood pressure levels, but differed in the presence (Group I, n = 23) or absence (Group II, n = 23) of the ECG pattern of left ventricular hypertrophy and strain. Group I patients had significantly more episodes of exercise-induced ST segment depression (14 versus 4, p less than 0.05) and reversible thallium perfusion abnormalities (11 of 23 versus 3 of 23, p less than 0.05) despite similar exercise capacity and absence of chest pain. Nonsustained ventricular tachycardia was detected on 24 h ambulatory ECG monitoring in two patients in Group I, but no patient in Group II. Coronary arteriography performed in 20 Group I patients demonstrated significant coronary artery disease in 8 patients. This study has shown that there is a subgroup of hypertensive patients with ECG left ventricular hypertrophy and strain who have covert coronary artery disease. This can be detected by thallium perfusion scintigraphy, and may contribute to the increased risk known to be associated with this ECG abnormality.\r"

  ".W": "A newly developed, flow-directed, Doppler pulmonary artery catheter, capable of measuring instantaneous and continuous cardiac output, was evaluated in both an in vitro pump model and an animal model. Quantitative flow was calculated with use of the instantaneous, space-average velocity (obtained from the velocity profile) and the instantaneous area (obtained from the vessel diameter) and compared with electromagnetic flow. Additionally, simultaneous thermodilution flow measurements were obtained. Doppler catheter-determined flow was highly predictive of electromagnetic flow in both continuous and pulsatile pump models (r2 = 0.98, slope or m = 1.04, SEE = 0.44; and r2 = 0.97, m = 1.04 and SEE = 0.33, respectively). Thermodilution was less predictive and appeared to underestimate electromagnetic flow in both the continuous and the pulsatile model (r2 = 0.99, m = 0.91, SEE = 0.20 and r2 = 0.95, m = 0.84 and SEE = 0.34, respectively). In the animal model, Doppler catheter-determined cardiac output appeared to modestly underestimate electromagnetic flow (r2 = 0.80, m = 0.87, SEE = 0.61). However, Doppler determinations of flow remained more accurate than did simultaneous thermodilution measurements (r2 = 0.73, m = 0.79, SEE = 0.72). Accurate, continuous and instantaneous cardiac output measurements appear possible with use of a flow-directed, Doppler pulmonary artery catheter. This catheter system also provides instantaneous diameter measurements and mapping of instantaneous velocity profiles within the main pulmonary artery and may lead to more accurate Doppler-derived assessment of cardiac output in humans.\r"

  ".U": "89198282\r", 
  ".W": "In patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, the mitral valve moves anteriorly and assumes a unique shape, with mitral-septal contact centrally and preserved valve orifice area laterally. This shape is not clearly predicted by the Venturi mechanism, which stresses flow above the valve as opposed to changes intrinsic to the valve. On the other hand, it has been suggested that displacement of the papillary muscles anteriorly and toward one another, as observed in this disease, can promote anterior mitral valve motion and produce this unusual shape. The purpose of this in vitro study was to test the hypotheses that anterior motion of a membrane in a flow field can be generated by altering the distribution or effectiveness of chordal tension tethering the membrane, and that the shape achieved by this membrane depends on the geometry of chordal tension. Accordingly, a horizontal leaflet mounted in a flow chamber was attached by chords at its distal end to a series of upstream screws. Chordal tension could be varied by turning the screws or redirected by shifting the screws anteriorly. Anterior leaflet motion having the same unusual configuration seen in patients was reproduced by decreasing central chordal restraint while tension on the leaflet edges was maintained. Directing chordal tension anteriorly caused greater degrees of anterior motion at earlier stages in the release of chordal restraint; increased flow rate had a similar but less marked effect. These studies suggest that primary geometric alterations in the papillary-mitral apparatus can play an important role in determining the presence and geometry of systolic anterior mitral motion. The nature of these alterations suggests a role for anterior and inward papillary muscle displacement in promoting such motion. The geometric factors embodied in this model can explain many observed features of this motion not adequately explained by the Venturi effect, such as early systolic onset and the importance of a distal residual leaflet. Finally, flow visualization studies emphasize the importance in this process of drag forces caused by interposing the leaflet into the flow stream, and of geometric factors that enhance such forces.\r"

Activity levels measured in the study showed high-level task activities (consuming a large amount of work time) were conducting individual diet instructions, conducting nutrition assessments, reviewing and recording in medical records, and supervising support personnel. Taking anthropometric measurements, participating in medical rounds, attending professional conferences, and purchasing and dispensing specialized products were found to be low-level task activities (consuming little work time). The average amount of time spent on the job per week was 42.7 hours with a mean of 20.4 hours spent in direct patient care, 13.6 hours in indirect patient care, and 7.3 hours in nonpatient care.\r"

Through the advice of the consultant, a media tipsheet, published monthly, was created. This publication, the Nutrition Informationist, effectively increased media contacts from two in 1986 to 19 in 1987 and resulted in a total of 8 hours of air time. Weight reduction, fad diets, and sports nutrition proved to be the most popular topics. Public service announcements (PSAs) concerning the DIAL-A-DIETITIAN program were developed by the consultant to assist the public in gaining access to local registered dietitians. Calls to that service increased 75% (from an average of 47.5 to 83.0 calls) the month following the distribution of PSAs to radio stations. The positive outcome of this collaborative effort shows that public relations consultants can be a useful resource for local dietetic associations, aiding them in their efforts to reach the media and the public and to improve their image.\r"

A model to measure the productivity of ambulatory nutrition specialists at a large urban teaching hospital was devised and was defined by the following equation: Patient/time productivity index = [(extended visits X 2) + (brief visits X 1) + (weigh-ins X 0.5) + (telephone consults X 0.25) + (group class census X 0.25)] divided by number of hours worked. Information obtained from this productivity measurement has been used to evaluate and improve patient scheduling and the organization of functions in various ambulatory nutrition settings. A productivity award based on the productivity index and distributed monthly has provided an incentive for all ambulatory nutrition specialists to streamline operations and maximize efficiency. The patient/time productivity index has been incorporated into performance reviews of ambulatory nutrition specialists as an objective measure of compliance with expectations. When used in conjunction with quality assurance techniques such as chart audits and patient satisfaction questionnaires, the patient/time productivity index can be a useful tool for management to maximize the quality and efficiency of ambulatory nutrition services.\r"

  ".W": "An explosive outbreak of influenza A/H3N2 began in a nursing home in the Denver area early in November, 1987. Residents had not been vaccinated at that time. Vaccine was administered on November 11th. Two weeks after the vaccine was given, the attack rate differed between the vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals. There were 40 cases of influenza among the 98 elderly residents, 12 cases of pneumonia, and seven deaths. Vaccine efficacy two weeks after it was given was estimated to be 65.4% in preventing clinical illness. There were no cases of pneumonia and no deaths among people who were vaccinated more than two weeks before. The virus was identified as influenza A by complement fixation tests with convalescent sera from 16 individuals who had been ill. Many also had hemagglutination inhibition titers for A/Colorado/1/87, which were as high as titers for A/Leningrad/87. A/Colorado/1/87 closely resembled A/Sichuan/87.\r"

The 4-day program included intensive education about the disease and its prognosis, physical therapy education, nutritional counseling, and medical evaluation and treatment. All therapeutic patients enrolled in the program over a one-year period (N = 38) were interviewed individually pre- and post-participation. Knowledge of osteoporosis, level of social support, coping styles, and perceptions of the impact of pain and chronicity were assessed. Patients reported improved future outlook despite continued concern about pain and chronicity. Mention of depression was reduced, and knowledge of osteoporosis increased significantly. In addition, there were meaningful changes in patients' understanding of disease management. These included knowing when to make specific changes and avoid harmful actions. The findings suggest that an educational program can have a positive impact on patients' coping. Educational efforts may be an important component in the management of chronic disease.\r"

However, elderly people define constipation differently than do their physicians: only 3% of men and 2% of women in the community sample reported that their average stool frequency was less than three per week, the customary medical criterion for constipation. The primary symptom which elderly people used to define constipation was having to strain in order to defecate. Multiple factors were found to influence self-reports of constipation. The amount of liquids consumed was significantly related to longest period without a bowel movement in men, but fiber and liquids were not related to self-reported constipation in either sex. The number of chronic illnesses and the number of nonlaxative medications were significantly related to constipation in women but not men, and the number of psychological symptoms correlated significantly with self-reports of constipation in both men and women. Age was not significantly related to self-reported constipation in men or women over the age of 65.\r"

As part of a large study of institutionalized elderly fallers, we compared Holter findings of fallers (N = 51) with a group of nonfallers (N = 27) having similar medical and demographic characteristics. Prevalence of ventricular arrhythmias was 82% in each group, and all patients had supraventricular arrhythmias. The mean number of ventricular and supraventricular couplets and runs did not differ between groups. There was no difference in severity of arrhythmias between fallers and nonfallers; in fact, fallers had slightly fewer Lown 4B arrhythmias than nonfallers (10% vs 18%, NS). Prevalence of heart disease was 78% in both groups and was associated with increased ventricular ectopy in the form of runs and couplets (P less than .05). No symptoms were reported during the Holter monitoring. We conclude that Holter monitoring should not be a routine part of the work-up of the patient who falls.\r"

Demographic and anthropometric data were collected to determine the effects of nutrition and other variables on cutaneous-delayed hypersensitivity. Anergy (a lack of response greater than 5 mm of induration when read at 48 hours) to any of the four antigens occurred in 34% of nursing home residents, 17% of geriatric clinic patients, and none of the healthy young adults. Mean and maximal responses were less in the nursing home residents than the clinic patients or controls, even if anergic individuals were excluded from analysis, suggesting both a qualitative and quantitative decline in cell-mediated immune function in this elderly population. Repeat testing with each antigen for which there was a negative initial response revealed a \"booster\" affect of 7 to 19% and occurred as commonly in the healthy young adults as in the nursing home residents or geriatric clinic patients. The mumps antigen elicited strong responses in the healthy young adults, but weak reactions in the nursing home residents. An unexpectedly high prevalence of positive tuberculin (PPD) responses occurred in the nursing home residents, suggesting recent exposure. Analysis of anthropometric and demographic characteristics show that neither nutritional status nor age alone can account for differences in cutaneous-delayed hypersensitivity observed between populations. Cutaneous-delayed hypersensitivity may vary widely between elderly populations and have important practical implications for the tuberculin test.\r"

  ".W": "We hypothesized that the blood pressure response to standing may depend on the method of establishing baseline blood pressure. Three hundred elderly subjects previously completed a postural blood pressure protocol with three supine baseline blood pressure readings obtained two minutes apart prior to standing. Comparison of the readings showed a significant drop between the first and the second (P less than .001) but not between the second and third supine systolic blood pressures. The difference between the first supine systolic blood pressure and the one minute standing blood pressure was significantly greater than that between the third supine systolic blood pressure and the one minute standing blood pressure (P less than .001). A second group was prospectively studied to determine whether the change in blood pressure after standing was greater if only a single baseline reading was taken rather than multiple readings, and whether the decline in blood pressure over three readings was related to duration supine or to the number of blood pressures taken. This group also demonstrated a decline in systolic blood pressure with three serial readings. We conclude that supine blood pressure declines significantly between the first and second readings taken two minutes apart and is secondary to the repetition of readings and not the duration supine. However, this change in supine blood pressure does not significantly alter the blood pressure response to standing. Thus, it appears that a single baseline supine blood pressure measurement is adequate for determining the postural blood pressure response, and that pooling of multiple baseline readings may not be appropriate.\r"

Longer use of TCP may cause more severe cardiac damage which might result in an increase in the capture threshold for subsequent transvenous cardiac pacing (TVP). To assess this possibility, we examined changes induced by TCP in a canine chronic heart block model. Heart block was induced in conditioned dogs (n = 8) by His bundle ablation. Seven to 10 days after induction of heart block, six animals were paced. Cardiac enzymes were drawn before pacing and at 4, 24, 48, and 72 hours after pacing. Although there was a significant rise in CK at 4 and 24 hours (P less than 0.05), there was no detectable rise in the MB fraction in any of the paced animals. There was no elevation of LDH after pacing, although three animals did develop an LDH1/LDH2 isoenzyme flip indicative of myocardial damage. Animals were sacrificed 72 hours after pacing and their hearts were examined for gross and microscopic changes. The hearts of the paced animals revealed subendocardial, subepicardial, and perivascular areas of basophilic degeneration involving less than 1% of the myocardium in four of six animals. No evidence of such damage was seen in two heart-blocked control animals not undergoing pacing. TVP and TCP capture thresholds assessed before and after a 60-minute TCP pacing period showed no significant change. Hence, use of TCP for a 60-minute period prior to TVP appears to be a safe emergency pacing technique.\r"

In some patients it can produce an acute pulmonary reaction ranging from mild dyspnea to noncardiogenic pulmonary edema. Symptoms include fever, dyspnea, chills, cough, and chest pain. Physical examination generally reveals an acutely ill, extremely apprehensive patient in varying degrees of respiratory distress. Fever is usually present and there is an increase in heart rate and respiratory rate. Cyanosis, rales, and a maculopapular rash are common findings. Laboratory studies typically demonstrate a leukocytosis with eosinophilia, varying degrees of hypoxia and hypocapnia, and a mild to moderate elevation of the erythrocyte sedimentation rate. The chest x-ray study may be normal but more often demonstrates bilateral lower lobe interstitial infiltrates frequently accompanied by pleural effusions. Treatment in the majority of cases requires only stopping the drug, but steroids, bronchodilators, or antihistamines may be used in selected cases. Once the diagnosis is made and the drug withdrawn, prognosis for full recovery is excellent.\r"

The anatomical etiology is the presence of accessory atrioventricular conduction fibers called the Kent bundle. Patients with the WPWS may present to the emergency department with a wide spectrum of symptoms, ranging from mild palpitations, to unstable tachydysrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. WPWS should be suspected in any patient presenting with a tachydysrhythmia with a rate exceeding 200/minute. Cardioversion is indicated in the unstable patient. It is impossible to predict the effect of any particular drug without prior electrophysiologic studies in a patient with WPWS. Procainamide is the safest drug for the stable WPWS patient with a tachydysrhythmia, including wide-complex and irregular rhythms. Verapamil is a useful drug in narrow-complex, regular rhythms, although complications have been reported. Atrial fibrillation may be difficult to diagnose in a very rapid tachycardia, and the use of verapamil in WPWS with atrial fibrillation is contraindicated. Electrophysiologic studies are indicated in the WPWS patient to maximize prophylactic therapy. An illustrative case as well as pathophysiology and management of WPWS are discussed.\r"

Since these modalities are generally limited in their availability, and since the success of thrombolysis is strongly time-dependent, the interfacility transfer of patients during AMI has become more common. Study of a relatively small number of patients indicates that aeromedical helicopter transport can be conducted in a safe manner, and that the outcome of management is of benefit to the patients. Reperfusion events, however, must be anticipated during transport of patients in whom thrombolysis is initiated preflight. Furthermore, initiation of thrombolytic therapy may be problematic if begun in patients with events mimicking AMI, particularly aortic dissection or Prinzmetal's angina.\r"

  ".W": "The role of the lytic complement C5b-9 membrane attack complex (MAC) in acute passive transfer experimental autoimmune myasthenia gravis (EAMG) produced in rats was investigated by in vivo inhibition of MAC formation with anti-C6 Fab. Anti-C6 Fab totally inhibited in vitro serum hemolytic activity, but did not consume or inhibit early complement pathways. Injection of rats with 0.12 mg/ml anti-C6 Fab reduced serum C6 to 8% and inhibited the muscle weakness, electrophysiologic abnormalities and loss of acetylcholine receptor (AChR) associated with acute EAMG. This level of C6 inhibition reduced the total serum complement hemolytic activity to 29% of normal but did not reduce the serum levels of complement components C3, C5, or C7. Treatment of rats with lower amounts of anti-C6 Fab (0.08 mg/ml) also inhibited clinical and electrophysiologic signs of EAMG, however, the lower amount of anti-C6 did not prevent the loss of muscle AChR. Both the higher and the lower amount of anti-C6 Fab inhibited the accumulation of macrophages at muscle motor end-plates. The inhibition by anti-C6 indicates that muscle weakness and electrophysiologic abnormalities associated with EAMG are dependent on the complement MAC, and that muscle weakness results from tissue injury in addition to loss of muscle membrane and AChR.\r"

  ".W": "The precise biologic function of C-reactive protein (CRP), a major acute phase protein in man, is unknown. The abilities of CRP to bind biologic substrates and to activate the C pathway, and its localization at sites of inflammation argue for an opsonic role for this protein. Such a role has been supported by recent reports of specific binding of CRP to neutrophils. Using highly purified radioiodinated human CRP, we have observed specific binding of this protein to human monocytes in vitro. The binding was reversible and rapid, with a t1/2 for the dissociation reaction of approximately 3 min. Binding was saturable at a CRP concentration of approximately 0.2 microM, with an estimated K from Scatchard analysis of 1.1 x 10(-7) M. Specific binding was calcium-dependent, with optimal binding occurring at calcium concentrations of more than 1.0 mM. No specific binding could be demonstrated to a non-adherent population of mononuclear cells (more than 80% lymphocytes). In other experiments, a 100-fold excess of human IgG failed to inhibit binding, although rabbit CRP produced competitive inhibition of binding which was quantitatively similar to human CRP. The binding was maximal at pH 7.4 and was sensitive to prior trypsin treatment of cells. These studies provide direct evidence for specific binding of soluble human CRP to human monocytes in vitro and thus provide further support for an important functional interaction of this acute phase protein with phagocytic cells in man.\r"

When packed human E were added to human serum or guinea pig serum, binding of IC to the E occurred and IC solubilization was significantly inhibited. By contrast, SRBC did not bind IC nor inhibit IC solubilization. Because IC binding to human E is mediated by CR type 1 (CR1) we evaluated whether CR1 was responsible for the inhibition of IC solubilization. Human E were treated with trypsin or anti-CR1 mAb. Both treatments abrogated IC binding to human E but did not affect the ability of the human E to inhibit IC solubilization. Human E inhibited C activation by IC. Thus, incubation of IC in human serum caused significant activation of C3 and C5, but not C4. However, when IC were incubated in whole blood or with isolated human E and serum, C3 activation by IC was inhibited significantly. In addition, we demonstrated that the C3b generated during C activation by IC deposited on both IC and human E. Thus, human E may compete for nascent C3 generated during C activation by IC. In conclusion, human E inhibit both complement-mediated solubilization of IC and C activation by IC.\r"

Recognition first manifests itself as a 3- to 10-fold reduction in the affinity of C3b for factor H, a regulatory protein of C. This report describes the use of a fluorimetric assay which is sensitive to the C3b-H interaction to study the characteristics of recognition. Fluid phase C3b covalently bound to CHO (C3b-CHO) was prepared by activating C3 in the presence of the small homopolymers dextran (alpha 1-6 polyglucose) or inulin (beta 1-2 polyfructose). In particulate form both polysaccharides are activators of C. The conjugates exhibited increased resistance to inactivation in the factor H-dependent assays compared to C3b not bound to CHO and to C3b bound to mono- or disaccharides. The dextran-induced restriction of inactivation was partially reversed by treatment of the conjugate with dextranase. C3b-CHO conjugates failed to bind to factor H-Sepharose and when introduced into serum behaved as though C3b was attached to particulate activators of C, suggesting that the fluorimetric assay accurately reports recognition. The results suggest that the recognition site which induces a reduction in the affinity of C3b for factor H is distinct from the thioester site of C3b and can recognize structural features of polysaccharides including size, sialic acid content, and possibly aspects of three-dimensional oligosaccharide structure.\r"

In this study the size of the site with which the polysaccharides interact and its special relationship to the thioester site were investigated using a fluorimetric assay and soluble C3b attached to low m.w. polysaccharides. Oligomers of alpha 1-6 and alpha 1-4 polyglucose and beta 1-2 polyfructose were prepared and attached to C3b at the thioester site. C3b bound to monomeric, dimeric, or trimeric sugars exhibited the same interaction with factor H as free C3b, i.e., there was no effect due to attachment alone. Beginning with tetrameric oligosaccharides a linear decrease in factor H binding was observed with increasing oligosaccharide size and the effect reached an apparent maximum with large polysaccharides. Maximum inhibition of factor H function was estimated to occur at a length of 16 saccharide units. The results suggest that this site, which regulates the inactivation rate of surface-bound C3b and thus the activation of the alternative pathway of C, spans a maximum of 13 sugar units (less than 65 A) starting four units (approximately 15 A) from the thioester site in C3b.\r"

  ".W": "Tumor cells have adapted several strategies which permit them to grow in an immunologically hostile environment. The C system can potentially destroy these cells; however, its action needs to be specifically potentiated on the surface of the tumor cells. To this end, a heteroconjugate composed of a mouse mAb and of the human C3b C component has been generated by using the heterobifunctional reagent N-succinimidyl-3-(2-pyridyldithio)propionate. The two mAb which were used in this study are V1-10 and TIB219 which bind to the human and mouse transferrin receptors, respectively. The mAb-C3b conjugates were purified by gel filtration and were each composed of one mAb and one C3b. They bound to the human K562 and HL60 or mouse ALB1 cell lines and amplified the killing of these cells by C from 10 to 15% to 70 to 100%. Fresh normal human or mouse sera were used as a source of C. The mAb-C3b conjugates activated primarily the alternative pathway of C since only C3 and factor B but not C4 were cleaved in the sera. After disulfide-linking to the mAb, the C3b became highly resistant to inactivation by factors H and I, probably due to its reduced factor H binding capacity. On the other hand, the conjugated C3b bound factor B better than free C3b and produced more C3 convertases which expressed increased stability. These results suggest that mAb-C3b conjugates may serve as an effective tool for the specific activation of the cytolytic C system on selected cells. As such, they may be used in vitro or in vivo to target the autologous C to tumor cells or to lymphocytes and may promote tumor immunotherapy.\r"

Despite its abundance, novel subcellular distribution, and lineage-restricted expression, nothing of PMN LacCer function is known. We examined the relationship between LacCer and PMN activation by assessing binding of anti-LacCer mAb (T5A7; anti-CDw17) to PMN during and after cell stimulation. CDw17 expression markedly decreased after treatment with PMA, dioctanoylglycerol, calcium ionophore, FMLP (with or without cytochalasin B or added Ca2+), TNF-alpha, or lymphotoxin. Depending on the stimulus, CDw17 declined to levels ranging from 70% (TNF, lymphotoxin) to less than 5% (phorbol ester, dioctanoylglycerol) of levels detected on untreated PMN. Loss of CDw17 from PMA-treated PMN followed dose- and temperature-dependent kinetics, with loss being detected after PMA treatment for 1 min. Membrane internalization explained PMA-induced loss of CDw17, as cell-associated 125I-anti-CDw17 became inaccessible to fluorescent anti-Ig after PMA treatment. CDw17 on PMN cytoplasts or retinoic acid-induced HL-60 cells was only slightly affected by stimulation, suggesting that down-regulation of the epitope is associated with granule exocytosis rather than superoxide production. Results with PMN from a patient with chronic granulomatous disease confirmed that normal superoxide production is not required for CDw17 loss induced by PMA or FMLP treatment. The data collectively demonstrate that reduced levels of cell-surface CDw17 are associated with granule exocytosis after PMN activation.\r"

  ".W": "In evaluation of macrophage-activating principles other than lymphokines, we systematically investigated the effects of endotoxin on the formation of reactive oxygen intermediates measured by chemiluminescence. Surprisingly, endotoxin exposure of human blood monocytes cultured in vitro for 36 h lessened in a dose-dependent manner the amount of O2- and H2O2 secreted in response to phagocytosis of opsonized particles or to PMA, a soluble stimulant. Blunting of the respiratory burst by endotoxin was independent from the state of macrophage activation. Endotoxin thus impaired formation of reactive oxygen metabolites before, during, or after activation of macrophages by IFN-gamma. The median effective concentration (EC50) was 1.95 ng/ml LPS in resting macrophages and 7.22 ng/ml in IFN-gamma-activated macrophages with as little as 0.1 ng/ml reproducibly giving detectable inhibition. Lipid A, but not \"detoxified\" monophosphoryl lipid A gave an inhibition comparable to that of complete LPS. The inhibitory effect of endotoxin was attenuated by dexamethasone, but not by inhibitors of arachidonic acid metabolism. Because endotoxin induces and dexamethasone inhibits production of some monokines, it is tempting to speculate that endotoxin is part of an autoregulatory system of mononuclear phagocytes for the control of excessive production of potentially harmful oxidants. The two monokines identified to be secreted in response to LPS and to be inhibited by dexamethasone, IL-1 and TNF, had, however, no comparable effect on chemiluminescence.\r"

Previously we reported that mAb 302 recognizing the 230-kDa PMMSA of Plasmodium yoelii provided passive protection to mice challenged with this parasite. We now report that the protective capacity of mAb 302 is variant specific, affording protection against infection with only three of five P. yoelii lines. Immunoprecipitation analyses of their PMMSA revealed that the expression of the epitope recognized by mAb 302 also varied and correlated completely with the results of the passive protection studies. Although this specific determinant was not present on the merozoite Ag of all P. yoelii lines, the common expression of other B cell epitopes was noted by the demonstration of serologic cross-reactivity between these molecules. Furthermore, the relatedness of the genes encoding the PMMSA of several murine plasmodial strains and species was clearly shown in nucleic acid hybridization studies. Although strain-common and strain-variable epitopes have been observed in the PMMSA of the human parasite, Plasmodium falciparum, little is known concerning the variability of its biologically relevant epitopes. The current studies using the P. yoelii model system demonstrate that the epitope recognized by a protective mAb is strain variable. Because of the similarities between these antigens of P. falciparum and P. yoelii, this information may impact on the construction of an effective blood-stage malarial vaccine.\r"

This induction is most likely due to the increase in cAMP levels elicited by the agonist, based on the direct measurements of cAMP levels and the ability of DBcAMP and the adenylate cyclase activator, forskolin to mimic the effects of isoproterenol. Blocking of the induction was achieved with the beta-antagonist, propranolol, but not with the alpha-antagonist phentolamine, indicating that this is a beta-adrenergic receptor-mediated phenomenon. Finally this induction is transcriptionally regulated as determined by nuclear run-on experiments. Future studies will center on identifying DNA regions of the DR alpha-chain gene which are important in this regulation.\r"

Although SpA reportedly is a potent T cell mitogen that can induce immune cell proliferation and production of humoral factors with anti-tumor activity, it has been suggested that mitogenic enterotoxin contaminants might be responsible for these effects. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the nature of SpA-induced cell proliferation and the relationship between mitogenicity and the anti-tumor effect that we observed in our mouse model. SpA stimulated the proliferation of a mixed population of splenic B and T cells from BALB/c mice, but activity did not require the presence of IgG in the culture medium. Furthermore, mitogenic activity could be inhibited completely by anti-SEA plus anti-SEB, but was unaffected by anti-SpA. HPLC-purified SpA was inactive while the mitogenic factor(s) had the same retention time as authentic enterotoxin and its activity was inhibited by anti-SEA and anti-SEB, but not by anti-SpA. Enterotoxin-free rSpA produced in Escherichia coli had the same IgG binding capacity as the staphylococcal product but was not mitogenic. These data indicate that SEA and SEB completely account for mitogenicity in SpA preparations. In contrast, we found that optimal concentrations of rSpA as well as crude and HPLC purified staphylococcal SpA were equally effective in inhibiting the growth of established Meth A fibrosarcomas demonstrating that SpA is responsible for antitumor activity without any apparent role for enterotoxins.\r"

In addition, it was found that subjects who initially had a small melanocyte population showed a larger increase in both exposed and covered skin compared to those with a high initial density. Individuals with a low density might therefore constitute a risk group for the development of malignant melanoma. These findings support the view that infrequent periods of intensive UV irradiation might be more harmful than regular exposure.\r"

To investigate the possible role of the keratinocyte in regulating pigmentation, human keratinocytes were incubated for 24 h in a defined culture medium, which was then transferred to pure human melanocyte cultures. After 1 week, the conditioned medium produced a fourfold increase in melanocyte yield and a seven-fold increase in total melanin. Increased melanocyte dendricity was clearly visible within 24 h as well. Ultrafiltration of the keratinocyte-conditioned medium suggested approximately one-half of the growth promoting activity as well as most of the dendricity and melanization stimulating activities were of low molecular weight (less than 500 Da). High molecular weight fractions stimulated only melanocyte growth. Of the several known keratinocyte-derived factors tested, none could be implicated as a mediator of the observed effects. Basic fibroblast growth factor, known to stimulate melanocyte growth in some culture systems, failed to stimulate growth, dendricity, or melanin content when added to the complete non-conditioned medium. Interleukin-1 alpha, interleukin-1 beta, 12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid, prostaglandin E2, leukotriene B4, and adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate analogues also had no effect. These studies demonstrate that keratinocytes in vitro release factors that modulate melanocyte behavior and expand our understanding of controls for human epidermal pigmentation.\r"

Laser-Doppler velocimetry was used to quantitate the microvascular flow rates in normal control, disease control (rheumatoid arthritis, discoid lupus erythematosus), and subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus serum-injected guinea pig skin test sites before and after combined ultraviolet B and A radiation from a solar simulator. Results, expressed as change in milli-electron voltage (perturbed milli-electron volts after irradiation minus baseline milli-electron volts before irradiation), revealed that subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus serum injections consistently resulted in greater UV-induced microvascular flow rates than those elicited by normal or disease control serum injections. Anti-Ro/SS-A containing subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus sera produced the greatest flow rates observed in this study. Earlier studies have suggested that the pathogenesis of lupus photosensitivity is very likely multifactorial. Our current data suggest that anti-Ro/SS-A autoantibody or other closely related humoral elements should also be considered among the factors which might contribute to this clinical phenomenon.\r"

  ".W": "Cultured human epidermal keratinocytes express a transglutaminase which appears in epidermis only during later stages of normal cell differentiation (Thacher and Rice, Cell 40:685, 1985). Using a monoclonal antibody affinity column, the keratinocyte transglutaminase has been purified approximately 1000-fold from non-ionic detergent extracts of the particulate fraction of a squamous cell carcinoma line. The prominent 92-kilodalton band in the purified material is recognized on Western Blots by a monoclonal antibody which also can immunoprecipitate the active enzyme. Further analysis of the 92-kilodalton band shows that it is apparently not antigenically related to tissue transglutaminase, or to the cytoplasmic enzyme expressed in cultured keratinocytes which is immunologically cross-reactive and of identical molecular weight to tissue transglutaminase. In monkey palmar and plantar epidermal homogenates significant transglutaminase activity appears to be membrane bound and chromatographs on anion-exchange as the keratinocyte enzyme does. It can be precipitated, at least in part, with the aid of specific monoclonal antibodies directed to keratinocyte transglutaminase. As determined immunohistochemically, the most likely membrane location of the enzyme in cultured cells is the plasma membrane, consistent with keratinocyte transglutaminase function in cross-linked envelope formation. Thigh, neonatal foreskin, psoriatic epidermis, and monkey esophagus are compared as to patterns of staining for keratinocyte transglutaminase. Cultured epidermal cells and psoriatic epidermis both show precocious expression when compared to normal epidermis, demonstrating that keratinocyte transglutaminase expression can be substantially modified during epidermal regenerative maturation or hyperproliferation.\r"

Biopsy specimens of skin lesions from five patients with PV and three patients with PF contained C5, C7, C9, and the MAC related neoantigen (C5b-9 neoantigen) in intercellular substance areas (ICS), as well as IgG and the early complement components Clq, C4, and C3. The presence of these late complement components and the C5b-9 neoantigens in ICS sites of the skin lesions is indicative of complement activation by the pemphigus antibody, with subsequent assembly of the MAC. The binding of IgG and early complement components to ICS was observed in both non-lesional (normal appearing) skin and in skin lesions. However, no MAC could be detected in the normal appearing skin of our pemphigus patients. It was also noted that the MAC could be generated in vitro on cryostat sectioned normal human skin by pemphigus antibody in the presence of complement. Results of these studies suggest that complement activation may be related to membrane damage of epidermal cells in both PV and PF.\r"

SBC production in 8-MOP sensitized mouse epidermis with and without application of sunscreens is dose-related. The difference between the slopes of the dose-response curves of the control group and the four sunscreens was highly significant (p less than 0.001). It appears that the SBC production was modified both by the dose of the UVA irradiation administered and by the UVA photoprotection of the four sunscreens. It could be concluded that the number of SBCs in 8-MOP sensitized mouse epidermis is a useful parameter to quantify the degree of UVA photoprotection of sunscreens.\r"

  ".U": "89198780\r", 
  ".W": "Oxygen toxicity to the lung is characterized by injury of the pulmonary capillary endothelium with progressive loss of functioning alveolar-capillary units. Current concepts suggest that the risk of O2 toxicity in human subjects is greatly increased with O2 concentrations exceeding 50% to 60%, although there are no data to support a cellular basis for this apparent threshold of toxicity. Our study suggests that a cellular threshold may exist in human pulmonary endothelial cells for O2 toxicity. Hyperoxia was directly toxic to cultured human pulmonary artery endothelial (HPAE) cells, with impairment of replicative function, expressed as growth impairment (GI) index, monitored by two independent parameters: cell number determination and tritiated thymidine incorporation. Impaired cell growth occurred as early as 8 hours after beginning exposure to 95% O2 and with concentrations as low as 60% during a 48-hour incubation. For example, 60% O2 resulted in an impairment of HPAE cell growth at 48 hours with a GI index (cell number) of 37.5 +/- 2.1 (p less than 0.001, comparison with control cells in normoxia). Furthermore, 95% O2 impaired cell growth, as monitored by tritiated thymidine incorporation, as early as 8 hours after exposure (GI index of 43.6 +/- 4.9) however, the injury was completely reversible when cells were reincubated in normoxia for 6 hours (GI index of 4.2 +/- 4.7), p less than 0.001. O2 toxicity was associated with an increase in cellular glutathione levels but was not associated with a detectable loss of antioxidant enzyme activity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In humans, the time course of this transfer has not been systematically evaluated in viable premature infants. We examined the cord blood of 13 preterm (25 to 36 weeks of gestation) and 10 term (38 to 42 weeks of gestation) infants for pluripotent (mixed colony-forming unit-granulocyte, erythrocyte, macrophage, megakaryocyte), erythroid (burst-forming unit-erythroid, colony-forming unit-erythroid) and myeloid (colony-forming unit-granulocyte, macrophage) stem cells. A gestational age-dependent decrease in all lineages of circulating hematopoietic stem cells was noted (p less than 0.001). By 34 weeks of gestation, preterm infant cord blood had a similar concentration of circulating stem cells compared with that of term infants. This gestational age-dependent decrease in hematopoietic stem cells of all lineages supports the hypothesis of a blood-borne transfer of hematopoiesis that appears largely complete by 34 weeks of gestation. Infants born after less than 32 weeks of gestation have high levels of circulating hematopoietic stem cells that may reflect the active transfer of hematopoiesis from liver to bone marrow.\r"

After massive damage with 1000 mg/kg galactosamine, TK activity (DNA synthesis) peaked between 62 and 120 hours. This peak of activity was depressed as much as 91% by six subcoma doses of dimethyl disulfide (DMDS) given between 24 hours and 64 hours after galactosamine administration. Similar doses of octanoic acid (OA) had no effect, and doses of NH4Cl had no effect except at 120 hours. The first peak of ODC activity (initiation of cell growth) at 45 hours was depressed about 60% by six subcoma doses of NH4Cl or DMDS injected between 27 hours and 42 hours. OA again had no effect. After 400 mg/kg galactosamine, a narrow but high peak of TK activity occurred at 62 hours. This peak of activity was depressed more than 50% by six subcoma doses of NH4Cl, OA, or DMDS given between 24 hours and 54 hours. The first peak of ODC activity at 36 hours was similarly reduced by more than 50% by similar doses of each of the toxins given between 24 hours and 34 hours. The overt neurologic effects of the toxins were dissipated within 1 hour of each injection. The depressive effect of NH4Cl and OA on TK and ODC activities during regeneration after massive centrolobular injury with acetaminophen was more consistently present and more extensive than that seen after injury with galactosamine.\r"

  ".W": "Whole cell deformability and lipid determinations were performed on red cells from two patients who had acanthocytes in the peripheral blood (10% and 20% to 30%) and normal serum lipoprotein levels. One patient had typical chorea-acanthocytosis and the other had no clinical abnormalities associated with acanthocytosis. Red cells from the patient with chorea-acanthocytosis showed reduced deformability, as measured by a visco-diffractometric method (ektacytometry), which could be explained by the presence of increased numbers of dehydrated cells containing high concentrations of hemoglobin. The total cell population showed a modest increase in potassium efflux, which may be responsible for reduced cation content and dehydration in a subpopulation of cells. When the patients' red cells were separated into different density populations by centrifugation on density gradients, the cells of classic acanthocyte morphology were concentrated in the high-density layers. This was true for both patients, although the subject with acanthocytes and no clinical disorder had a normal red cell density distribution. Lipid analysis of both types of acanthocytes showed an increase in the relative proportion of sphingomyelin with respect to the glycerophospholipids. Total cholesterol and phospholipid levels were reduced in the chorea-acanthocytosis red cells, but the other acanthocytes did not differ significantly in total lipid content from normal control samples. Thus, the one common abnormal feature in these two forms of acanthocytosis is the increase in the proportion of red cell sphingomyelin. Because this is a very stable, immobile component of the membrane, we suggest that its relative enrichment could result from a defect in the transport and maintenance of glycerophospholipids. Further study of the dynamics of glycerophospholipid organization in acanthocytes may be useful in increasing our understanding of the genesis of abnormal, acanthocytic morphology.\r"

We studied the levels of both HRG and plasminogen in patients with different degrees of liver cirrhosis to assess the role of HRG in enhanced fibrinolysis in these patients. In mild (Child A) cirrhosis, HRG levels unexpectedly were significantly increased. The total plasminogen level and the calculated amount of free plasminogen were decreased. In moderate (Child B) cirrhosis, both HRG levels and total plasminogen levels were reduced, resulting in a normal amount of free plasminogen in circulation. In severe (Child C) cirrhosis, HRG level, total plasminogen level, and free plasminogen level were all decreased. Because the HRG level is increased in Child A liver cirrhosis, we suggest that other mechanisms, other than simply a decreased synthetic capacity of the liver, contribute to the changes in HRG levels in patients with liver disease. Because of the reduction of free plasminogen levels in severe liver cirrhosis, we propose that the decrease in HRG levels in liver cirrhosis plays no role in enhanced fibrinolysis in these patients. The increase in the HRG level in Child A liver cirrhosis may be of importance in future studies on familial thrombosis associated with elevated levels of HRG, where mild liver dysfunction should at least be excluded.\r"

  ".W": "On the basis of the reversible, competitive binding of protamine and azure A dye to heparin, a facile, colorimetric protamine titration method was developed. The method uses azure A dye as the titration indicator and has thus replaced the time-consuming clotting assay in the traditional protamine titration method with a rapid colorimetric assay. It offers the same accuracy in estimating the titration end point as the traditional titration method but allows the processing time to be significantly shortened. With the use of a premade diagnostic kit containing a fixed amount of azure A dye and various amounts of protamine, the titration end point can be determined in less than 5 minutes. This new colorimetric protamine titration method should provide clinicians with an easy and reliable means to accurately estimate the protamine dose required for heparin neutralization. It should also assist medical laboratories in preparing plasma samples that are free of heparin interference for routine coagulation tests. In a reverse manner, the colorimetric assay can also be used with a heparin titration procedure to quickly assess the heparin dose required for protamine reversal. For patients who have received overdoses of protamine, the availability of a facile heparin titration method may offer the prospect of exercising a heparin \"back titration.\"\r"

We studied the physiologic control mechanisms, intestinal regions, and effects of lumenal factors on the intestinal absorption of polyethylene glycol (PEG) 900 in the rat in vivo and in rabbit brush border membrane vesicles (BBMVs). The kinetics of PEG 900 intestinal absorption were compatible with simple passive diffusion. Because transport across BBMVs was minimal, we concluded that transport of PEG 900 is mostly through the paracellular tight junctions. Absorption was highest in the midcolon (104.3 +/- 9.5 mumol/100 mg protein per hour vs 9.1 +/- 1.2 mumol/100 mg protein per hour in the jejunum). Absorption was decreased by higher lumenal osmolarity (greater than 400 mOsm/L) after the additions of 2.5 to 5.0 mmol/L chenodeoxycholate or 2.5 mmol/L lysolecithin, or at higher lumenal flow rates (greater than 1 ml/minute), higher lumenal pressure (7.5 cm H2O),or higher lumenal pH (8.0). Lipid solubility of PEG 900 was less than 0.00079%. Under all experimental conditions, PEG net absorption followed changes in water transport. When water transport changed from absorption to secretion, PEG absorption decreased. When water absorption increased, PEG 900 absorption increased in parallel. We conclude that PEG 900 is absorbed by passive diffusion that is modulated by solvent drag and is maximal in the midcolon. Transport directly across cell membranes is mimimal, but overall PEG 900 permeability is closely linked to water absorption by solvent drag and takes place primarily through the paracellular junctions. We propose that these features and mechanisms of PEG 900 transport make PEG 900 a suitable probe molecule for studying intestinal permeability changes.\r"

NaCl did not affect growth, fluid retention, or kidney ultrastructure in Cu-supplemented rats. Cu deficiency decreased growth rate and kidney Cu, increased plasma cholesterol concentration, and suppressed plasma RAAS. NaCl increased the magnitude of these changes in Cu-deficient rats. The mortality rate was higher in CuDNa (8/16) than in Cu-deficient (2/16) rats. An acute renal failure syndrome characterized by tissue edema, pleural effusion, and ascites occurred in rats fed CuDNa. Bioelectric impedence analysis indicated that body water content was similar in rats fed CuS, CuSNa, and CuD but was higher in edematous and nonedematous rats fed CuDNa. Transmission electron microscopy indicated that glomeruli from Cu-deficient rats were poorly perfused and often occluded by expanded mesangium and contained numerous lysozome-like bodies. Fusion of podocyte foot processes, derangement of glomerular basement membrane, and hypertrophy and lipid accumulation by glomerular capillary endothelium were present in tissue from rats fed CuDNa. These results indicate that Cu deficiency reduces NaCl tolerance in rats. Ultrastructural changes in kidney tissue and the suppression of RAAS in rats fed CuDNa suggest that the edema and ascites result from acute renal failure and not from increased fluid and electrolyte reabsorption.\r"

To test the hypothesis that the chemical disinfectant in the swimming pool is probably responsible for the Eustachian tube dysfunction, 30 children between the ages of four and eight years were selected at random from the community health department computer records and were randomly allocated into two groups. Eustachian tube function was assessed by standard tympanometry both immediately prior to swimming (control) and 30 to 45 minutes following swimming in Group 1 and approximately 14 hours following swimming in Group 2. The results of the study showed no significant change (p greater than 0.05) between pre- and post-swimming tympanometry. It is therefore concluded that swimming on the surface of chlorinated water does not compromise the Eustachian tube function in children with healthy middle ears.\r"

This disturbance resolves quickly and central compensation is complete generally within a month with resolution of symptoms and signs. The course of central compensation following VNS will be similar to that seen after labyrinthectomy because the detachment of hemi-labyrinthine input that is achieved by both will be identical. Six patients are presented who have undergone VNS at least 2.7 years ago (Average 3.5 years); all of them have persisting spontaneous peripheral type horizontal jerk nystagmus, present with optic fixation in five. This is obvious clinically and was confirmed in each case by agreement of three independent observers and has been recorded by electronystagmography (ENG). They are free from marked vestibular symptoms. The explanations of mechanisms involved in central compensation are discussed with respect to this previously unrecorded clinical observation.\r"

Although the symptoms of maxillary sinusitis may be clinically dominant, many previous studies have showed that the origin of this disease was, in most cases, located within the anterior ethmoid region. This study included 100 Egyptian patients, suffering from chronic maxillary sinusitis (confirmed by maxillary sinoscopy), who were subjected to 'systematic nasal endoscopy'. It was found that all cases of chronic maxillary sinusitis were associated with anatomical variations and/or pathological abnormalities of 'the ostiomeatal area'. It is recommended, therefore, that during the diagnosis and treatment of chronic maxillary sinusitis, attention should be given to the region of the middle meatus and anterior ethmoid complex (or 'ostiomeatal area') for any anatomical variations and/or pathological abnormalities in order to avoid recurrence of maxillary sinusitis. This is the basis of the procedure of functional endoscopic sinus surgery.\r"

The lower outline of the tongue, represented by the line between vallecula (V) and the hyoid bone (AH) was more inferiorly positioned in patients, apparently giving the tongue a more upright position with more of the tongue tissue at the hypopharyngeal level than found in normals.

SCM myocutaneous flaps have previously been considered for pharyngocutaneous fistulae and then disregarded due to the doubtful nature of the blood supply to the skin. The SCM myoplasty obviates this problem as it relies on muscle rather than skin. SCM myoplasty has been used as a bolster in pharyngeal reconstruction after the pharynx has been closed by pharyngeal mucosal advancement or rotation. The author has extended this idea utilizing the raw muscle of the SCM to directly reconstruct the defect in fistulae deemed too large for primary closure. Anatomical, oncological and technical considerations are discussed, as well as the author's protocol for post-laryngectomy pharyngocutaneous fistulae.\r"

As much as 14% of the boys and 5% of the girls had either a systolic BP above 140 mmHg or a diastolic BP above 90 mmHg. Total serum cholesterol averaged 4.13 mmol l-1 for the boys and 4.53 mmol l-1 for the girls, which is also high compared with adolescents from other countries. The ratios for high density lipoprotein cholesterol to total serum cholesterol were normal and in the range of 0.25-0.28 for both sexes. Other factors associated with coronary heart disease in adults, such as body fat content, serum triglycerides, physical activity, as well as smoking and alcohol habits were similar to that reported for teenagers in other countries. No correlation was found between aerobic power (ml min-1.kg-1) and the risk factors measured.\r"

  ".W": "Casual blood pressure (BP) and ambulatory BP (mean 24-h BP) were determined in 23 untreated patients with essential hypertension and in 11 normotensive healthy control subjects. Mean 24-h BP was significantly lower than casual BP in patients with essential hypertension, but not in control subjects. This was demonstrated in the patients who did not work during the ambulatory BP monitoring and in the patients with newly recognized hypertension, whereas no differences were revealed either in the patients who went to work or had a known duration of hypertension longer than 6 months. The size of the difference between casual BP and mean 24-h BP was unaffected by antihypertensive therapy with metoprolol and also individually reproducible. An accordance between casual and ambulatory BP measurements in evaluation of the efficacy of antihypertensive treatment was found in 75% of the patients. Casual BP and mean 24-h BP were weakly correlated both before and during antihypertensive treatment. It is concluded that the higher casual BP than ambulatory BP in essential hypertension may be a specific characteristic of the disease. Both work and known duration of hypertension longer than 6 months eliminate the difference between casual ambulatory BP in essential hypertension. Ambulatory BP monitoring seems to be superior to casual BP measurements in the evaluation of antihypertensive treatment.\r"

The most useful test for specific virological diagnosis was haemagglutination inhibition-IgM (HI-IgM). Most cases were from Aland Islands and nearby south-western main Finland. Two of the infections were imported. There were three laboratory infections and two transfusion infections. The disease occurred mainly from July to September. Detailed hospital records of 108 of the patients could be obtained. Ninety-five per cent of the patients had headaches, 82% had lymphocytosis of the cerebrospinal fluid, and 81% had high fever. Forty-four per cent had a confirmed biphasic course of disease. Seventeen per cent were severely ill. There were no deaths. The sequels were psychic irritability and fatigue for up to 1 year. There were eight cases of paresis, two of which became permanent.\r"

Poor oral health, as assessed by two indices measuring the severity of infections of teeth and periodontium, or by the presence of subgingival calculus or the presence of suppuration in the gingival pockets, were more common in male patients than in male controls, but no difference was observed in females. If severe dental infections were combined with other probable bacterial infections there were altogether 16 patients (40%) but only two controls (5%) who had suffered from a probable bacterial infection within 1 month or at the time of the stroke or when examined as a control (P less than 0.01). Our results suggest an association between bacterial infection and ischaemic cerebrovascular disease in patients under 50 years of age. Severe chronic dental infection seems to be an important type of infection associated with cerebral infarction in males.\r"

Hypercalcaemic patients had total serum calcium of 2.91 +/- 0.12 mmol l-1. Serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) was normal while daily urinary calcium excretion was subnormal (below 2.5 mmol) in 45%. Comparison with an age-matched group of patients with primary hyperparathyroidism gave a small overlap regarding serum human PTH, urinary calcium and the ratio between calcium clearance and creatinine clearance. Family screening therefore is of diagnostic importance. Twelve subjects had been subjected to parathyroid surgery before the correct diagnosis was settled, none of the cases had an adenoma. Three patients became normocalcaemic and the others had persistent hypercalcaemia. One male non-abuser had seven episodes of acute pancreatitis before surgery and none after. The findings in all four kindreds are compatible with familial hypocalciuric hypercalcaemia (FHH). This hereditary disorder of unknown aetiology, therefore, also exists in Scandinavia. It is of importance to consider FHH in the differential diagnosis of hypercalcaemia, since this disorder usually has a benign prognosis if untreated.\r"

Bone mineral content (BMC) of the lumbar spine, femoral neck and femoral shaft was determined using dual photon absorptiometry. Compared to healthy females of corresponding decades the PBC patients exhibited significantly decreased mean BMC-values in lumbar spine (88%, P less than 0.05) and femoral neck (92%, P less than 0.05) but not in femoral shaft (96%, NS). Bone mineral content was not significantly associated with duration of liver disease, impairment of liver function (serum concentrations of albumin, clotting factors II + VII + X, bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase galactose elimination capacity or histology), variables reflecting calcium homeostasis (serum concentrations of ionized calcium, parathyroid hormone, vitamin D binding protein, 25-hydroxy vitamin D3 and 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D3) or previous treatment with glucocorticosteroids. In view of our negative findings we suggest that future studies in this field should focus on physical activity and female sex hormones as determinants for the prevention of osteopoenia in females with primary biliary cirrhosis.\r"

The sweat is usually limited to the palms, soles, and axillae, and is greatly accentuated by mental stimuli rather than temperature and exercise. The severity is such that for many, sweating has become socially and emotionally devastating and may predispose to other cutaneous diseases. More than 60 research papers on eccrine glands and sweating have been published since 1978. Little progress, however, has been made on the control of hyperhidrosis, and the process remains a treatment dilemma among both family physicians and dermatologists. The many treatment modalities documented in the literature have been for the most part unsuccessful or unacceptable. This report describes the use of phenoxybenzamine, an alpha-adrenergic antagonist, for control of excessive sweating in two patients. After a trial of topical medication, phenoxybenzamine is useful for the reduction of sweating to an acceptable level.\r"

A total of 136 family practice residents (44 first-year, 40 second-year, 52 third-year) and 42 full-time and part-time faculty participated in the study along with 30 radiologists. The mix of radiographs evaluated was as follows: 44 percent chest, 20 percent lower extremity, 6 percent head, 4 percent lumbosacral spine, 3 percent cervical-thoracic spine, and 3 percent abdomen-pelvis. Interpretation concordance rates between family physicians and radiologists, by level of training, were as follows: first-year residents 83.0 percent, second-year residents 84.4 percent, third-year residents 86.0 percent, and faculty 88.6 percent. Concordance after the resident and faculty preceptor discussed the film and provided a collaborative interpretation was 92.1 percent. This finding compares with previously reported error rates of 10 to 40 percent between experienced radiologists. Only 10.3 percent of the discordant readings (0.8 percent of all radiographs) contained significant discordancies that may have affected patient management or outcome. Had the family physicians been given the option to refer an x-ray film to the radiologist, all x-ray films containing significant discordancies would have been referred.\r"

Questionnaires were mailed to all members of the Michigan Academy of Family Physicians (MAFP) who were listed as currently practicing obstetrics. Two hundred ninety-one questionnaires from the 357 mailed questionnaires were returned for a response rate of 81.5 percent. Two hundred thirty-five of the 291 respondents (80.8 percent) were practicing obstetrics in 1986. Twenty-two of the 235 physicians (9.4 percent) planned on discontinuing obstetric practice by early 1987. Reasons for discontinuing obstetrics included malpractice liability risk and cost and interference with lifestyle. Physicians who had recently discontinued or were planning to discontinue obstetric practice were significantly less likely than physicians practicing obstetrics to have a residency program affiliation (33 percent vs 58 percent). While malpractice concerns were found to be an important factor in deciding to discontinue the practice of obstetrics, practice arrangements and educational affiliations were other important factors that may be more amenable to change through educational or administrative interventions.\r"

The goal of this study was to assess the long-term effects of these sex chromosome and hormonal anomalies on psychopathology and social functioning. We report interview and questionnaire data concerning lifetime history of mental disorders and current psychiatric symptoms. Also reported are data from questionnaires and interviews evaluating social functioning as measured by education, occupation, personal resources, and sexual behavior. Twenty-three TUS women were studied and compared with 23 closely matched women with constitutional short stature (CSS) and with 10 normal sisters of the TUS women. TUS women reported generally less mental disorder and comparable rates of psychiatric symptoms. On the other hand, they had lower overall functioning on a measure of global psychological health and had more impairment in social functioning as measured by achievement of adult milestones. We conclude that TUS women display less mental illness by positive symptom-oriented criteria but also less mental health when day-to-day functioning is considered. Our data suggest that differences in TUS women cannot be explained solely by short stature and may be related to other psychosocial, genetic, endocrine, or CNS effects of the syndrome.\r"

It was hypothesized that the right hemisphere is specialized to become activated by and to process negative affective stimuli, and that this specialization may play a role in the co-occurrence of depression and pain. The relationship between depression, experimental pain, and cerebral laterality was investigated in 16 depressed and 16 nondepressed, right-handed, female students. Cerebral laterality was measured via tasks assessing visual and auditory biases, and pain was assessed via a cold pressor task. The proposition that the right hemisphere mediates the co-occurrence of pain and depression was not supported, but specific findings did suggest that the right hemisphere may play a unique role in pain perception. Data from the visual task indicated that prior exposure to pain results in increased right hemisphere activation as indicated by a left visual field bias. Pain perception was a complex function of mood, preceding tasks, and the hand tested, and it was suggested that exposure to a typical right-hemisphere task increased the left side lateralization of pain in nondepressed subjects. Implications of these findings are discussed for coexisting problems of pain and depression and for the lateralization of pain in disorders judged to involve a significant psychogenic component.\r"

Two previous studies in our laboratory had shown that schizophrenic patients were differentiated from a matched normal control group by a left temporal scalp region deficit in P300 topography. This present report compares two schizophrenic patients with the typical left temporal P300 topography deficit with two schizophrenic patients with a right temporal P300 topography deficit. The two right temporal deficit patients had more positive symptoms, more thought disorder, more severely impaired functioning, earlier age of onset, poorer response to neuroleptic medications, more diffuse cognitive deficits on a neuropsychological testing battery, and poorer premorbid history than the two left temporal deficit patients. There was some evidence for the presence of more CT abnormalities suggestive of frontal lobe pathology in the right temporal deficit patients.\r"

The delirious patients differed from the controls significantly in ventricular dilatation and cortical atrophy, and there was a statistically significant correlation between the width of the sylvian fissure and Mini-Mental State Examination score. Focal changes were also statistically more common in the delirious patients, and these changes tended to concentrate in the high-order association areas of the right hemisphere.

  ".W": "Of 283 mildly to profoundly retarded patients, 10 (3.5%) presented with compulsive behavior that significantly interfered with their daily functioning. Compulsions occurred in the context of obvious cerebral dysfunction and in the absence of anxiety or \"ego-dystonic\" qualities. The interrater reliability of the differential diagnosis between compulsions, stereotypies, and other repetitive behaviors was good (kappa = .82). A severity rating scale for the compulsive behavior yielded total scores with good interrater reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient = .82). Single items that described observable behaviors had good reliability, while inner resistance and subjective distress were not reliably assessed and contributed little to the total score. The authors suggest that the DSM-III-R diagnosis of obsessive-compulsive disorder be considered in mentally retarded patients, despite the absence of recognizable ego dystonic characteristics. Emphasis should be on the behavioral, externally observable components of the disorder, rather than on inner conflicts and anxiety. Such a diagnostic approach may also benefit nonretarded compulsive patients.\r"

Specifically, a question arises with respect to the relationship of numerous personal, neurological, medication, and disability variables to this memory impairment. We administered a recently developed standardized test of recent memory functions to 53 idiopathic parkinsonian patients undergoing Sinemet treatment. Memory scores were correlated with age, sex, education, marital status, length of illness, age at onset of illness, dosage and time on medication, functional status, and the major symptoms of parkinsonism. Of all factors assessed, only increased bradykinesia correlated consistently and pervasively with impaired memory. Some possible explanations are offered.\r"

Ninety consecutive patients (41 women and 49 men) treated for trauma, vascular diseases, tumours, pain, and malformations were included in the study. The physicians responsible for the treatment and the patients rated the result of the therapeutic efforts (operative or nonoperative) independently from each other on a five grade scale at the time for discharge. A follow-up study was also made 8-24 months after the treatment. Three different groups of paired observations were distinguished: (1) \"identical opinion\", (2) \"pessimistic opinion\" (physician's score lower than patient's) and (3) \"optimistic opinion\" (physician's score higher than patient's). At the time of discharge identical opinion about the result of treatment was present in 83% (75 cases) whereas 9% (8 cases) and 8% (7 cases) were referred to the groups of pessimistic and optimistic opinions respectively. In the follow up series the corresponding values were 57%, 12%, and 31%. The increase of non-identical judgements in the follow-up study was found almost exclusively in the group of patients treated for painful conditions. Also the spread of judgements was largest in the group of painful conditions. Otherwise there was no correlation between the actual result of treatment and diagnosis, sex or age.\r"

In the second group 29 of the 30 initially presented with a brain stem haemorrhage. The latter was often characterised by development of symptoms over two days or more (16 cases), absence of headache (48 cases) and tendency to recurrence (20 cases). Clinical diagnosis was difficult in many cases especially in the AOVM group. Several of the patients were misdiagnosed as having multiple sclerosis. Clinical data in conjunction with magnetic resonance imaging were helpful in determining the nature of these lesions.\r"

In this study we compared platelet serotonin concentration in 95 patients with CTH, 166 patients with migraine and 35 normal control subjects. Mean platelet serotonin (ng/10(9) platelets) was 310 for the CTH group, 384 during migraine headache, 474 for normal control subjects and 514 in headache-free migrainous patients. There was significant statistical difference of values between CTH patients and those of normal control subjects as well as headache-free migrainous patients, but not of those of migrainous patients during headache. It is suggested that CTH is a low serotonin syndrome, representing one end of the spectrum of idiopathic headache, the other end being represented by migraine.\r"

In the remaining six patients dementia was accompanied by dysphasia, dyspraxia and agnosia. One developed a Parkinsonian syndrome before the dementia, in three cases a Parkinsonian syndrome occurred later, and in two cases not at all. All patients showed Lewy bodies and cell loss in the substantia nigra, locus coeruleus and dorsal vagal nucleus, as in Parkinson's disease. The severity of cell loss in the nucleus basalis varied from mild to severe. Lewy bodies were also present in the parahippocampus and cerebral cortex, but Alzheimer-type pathology was mild or absent, and insufficient for a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. Patients with moderate or severe dementia, some with temporal or parietal features, may have cortical Lewy body disease, Alzheimer's disease, or a combination of the two. Cortical Lewy body disease may be associated with dementia in Parkinson's disease more often than realised, but is not necessarily associated with extensive Alzheimer pathology.\r"

About half of those with tangles, but no Lewy bodies, had excess nigral cell loss, and 16% had moderate or severe neuronal fallout, but none had a Parkinsonian syndrome. Cases with nigral tangles were younger, tended to have more hippocampal and cortical tangles and plaques, and lower activities of cortical choline acetyltransferase. In most cases of Alzheimer's disease degeneration in nigral and tegmental areas was greater than controls, and tangles were evenly distributed. All the cases of Down's syndrome had tangles in the nigra and eight showed mild cell loss. Mild degenerative changes accompanied by tangles in the substantia nigra and ventral tegmental area are common in Alzheimer's disease, but severe cell loss is rare. When a Parkinsonian syndrome occurs in Alzheimer's disease it is likely to be due to Lewy body pathology.\r"

  ".W": "In order to investigate the neuronal basis of cognitive disorders in Parkinson's disease, the neuropsychological performance of 120 patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease was analysed in relation to motor symptoms as a function of their response to levodopa. Cognitive impairment was poorly correlated with akinesia and rigidity, symptoms which respond well to levodopa treatment, and was not correlated at all with that part of the patients' motor score that could be improved by the drug. In contrast, strong correlations were found between all neuropsychological test scores and axial symptoms such as gait disorder and dysarthria, which respond little if at all to levodopa treatment. The neuropsychological test scores were also strongly correlated with the motor score of patients estimated when clinical improvement was maximal under levodopa treatment. This score is assumed to represent residual non-dopaminergic motor dysfunctions. The correlations suggest that much of the cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease results from the dysfunction of non-dopaminergic neuronal systems.\r"

Cathodal stimulation over the C7 spinous process was more effective than anodal stimulation or stimulation over the C5 or C3 spinous process. As the stimulus intensity was increased, the response amplitude increased and the latency decreased. When progressively higher levels of supramaximal stimuli were delivered the latency often decreased further. The shortest latencies evoked by stimulation over the C7 spinous process were close to the latencies of the responses evoked by supramaximal stimulation near Erb's point. Thus, with this type of stimulation, the site of nerve activation changes with different stimulus intensities. The variability in latency introduced by distal spread of the site of activation will affect measurements of central motor conduction time and should be considered in the diagnostic use of this technique.\r"

In the serum and in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) before, during and after the administration of the drug, the following were quantitated (a) levels of specific anticysticercous antibodies measured in optical densities by the ELISA method; (b) levels of IgG, IgM, IgA and IgE; (c) levels of complement fraction C3, C4; (d) presence of immune complexes; (e) total number of white blood cells in the CSF. It was found that after treatment with PZQ, the level of specific anticysticercous antibodies and the level of IgG rose significantly in the CSF but not in the blood. The levels of the fractions of the complement and the immunoglobulins IgM, IgA and IgE did not change significantly either in the serum or in the CSF. The blood-brain barrier was found ruptured in three patients before therapy and in five patients after the therapy as measured by the albumin index. Nevertheless, the IgG index showed that there was local production of IgG in five patients before treatment and in seven after the end of it. The relative specific antibody index was greater than 1.0 in five patients before therapy and in seven after therapy. This data strongly supports the idea that the specific antibodies are produced intrathecally and are not derived from the serum pool through a ruptured blood-brain barrier. It was concluded that patients with parenchymal CC have an elevation of specific anticysticercous probably due to a combination of a ruptured blood-brain barrier and intrathecal synthesis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The age at onset of symptoms ranged from 6 to 15 years (mean, 10.4 years). The EEG and polygraphic findings included normal background activity in most patients, spontaneous fast generalised spike-and-wave discharges, photosensitivity, no activation during slow sleep, and vertex and rolandic spikes in REM sleep. Results of muscle biopsy, performed an average of 14 years after onset of the disease, were normal and showed no mitochondrial abnormalities.

Examples of features include subnuclei, focal neuronal loss, and focal gliosis. We present a statistical test that justifies an investigator's claim that a feature is present in a nucleus at a selected level of confidence after completion of a cell counting experiment. The computer program developed for the test also indicates the most probable location of the feature within the nucleus, and its most probable density and length, and potentially allows one to make comparisons of feature characteristics among cases. We also present quantitative guidelines for the selection of a sampling periodicity in a heterogeneous nucleus before a cell counting experiment. Sampling periodicity is based upon analysis of computer-generated simulations of the nucleus with features of different sizes; for each feature the probability of Type I (false positives) and Type II (false negatives) errors are examined against one another. Type II error rate is dependent upon feature length and density, acceptable Type I error rate, and sampling periodicity. Feature detection is important for devising sampling strategies in brainstem nuclei.\r"

Pregnant F344 rats were given a single intravenous dose of 3.5 mg ENU/kg or vehicle on the twentieth day of gestation. A total of 192 male offspring were divided into four groups: ENU-PB, ENU-control, PB-control, and control-control. Rats in ENU-PB and PB-control groups received 0.05% PB in their drinking water from four to 78 weeks of age. Nervous system tumors were induced only in animals exposed to ENU. The difference in the incidence of neuroectodermal tumors in rats that were ENU initiated only (13/37; 35%) compared to the incidence in rats that were initiated and given PB (13/57; 23%) was not statistically significant (p greater than 0.05). ENU-control and ENU-PB treatment groups exhibited no differences in tumor multiplicity or tumor latency. These results demonstrate that PB lacks promoting activity for neurogenic tumors in F344 male rats transplacentally exposed to ENU.\r"

Centrosylvian architectonic abnormalities consisting, in part, of thin cortical plates and broad subcortical heterotopic zones were found in all abortuses. Astrocytes, neuroblasts, immature neurons and radial glia contained abnormal pleomorphic cytosomes, presumably of variable lipid composition. The same areas exhibited increases in cholesterol ester very long chain fatty acids and decreased plasmalogens. A pathogenetic hypothesis, proposing that regional tissue constraints act in concert with a peroxisomal-derived biochemical abnormality to impede centrosylvian neuronal migration, is discussed.\r"

The number and affinity of the glucagon receptors were unaffected by diet. The glucagon-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity from fish oil-fed animals exhibited the greatest stimulation, followed by corn oil-fed animals. Butter fat-fed and all cholesterol-supplemented groups showed a depression in stimulation. The pattern of adenylate cyclase activity with fluoride stimulation was similar to that observed with glucagon. The effect of dietary fat on forskolin stimulation was similar to glucagon and fluoride for the groups without added cholesterol. However, the cholesterol-supplemented groups did not exhibit a decreased activity. It is suggested that the effect of dietary lipid on glucagon-stimulated adenylate cyclase is not due to changes in the glucagon receptor, but rather due to changes in signal transduction, the Gs-protein or the catalytic unit.\r"

Female pups (F-2) were also fed the maternal diet after weaning. At 7 wk of age, before saline or N-nitrosomethylurea (NMU) treatment, ornithine decarboxylase (ODC, EC 4.1.1.17) activity in mammary epithelium and liver tissue was significantly higher in the HP group than in the NP group. Eight weeks after saline treatment ODC activity in mammary tissue decreased in both groups, but remained significantly higher in the HP group. NMU treatment caused a sixfold increase in ODC activity in the mammary tissue in the HP group and a significantly lower response in the NP group. Liver ODC activity had a minimal response to NMU treatment. Changing from the HP to the NP diet 4 wk after NMU treatment reduced mammary ODC induction response but not tumor burden; changing from the NP diet to HP diet produced no change in ODC activity or tumor burden. Mammary tumor burden was positively related to dietary protein and mammary epithelium ODC activity prior to and following NMU treatment.\r"

  ".W": "These studies were conducted to determine to what extent dietary fibers, or related compounds such as lactulose or amylomaize starch, alter the flux of blood urea to the cecum and cecal absorption of ammonia in the rat. Cecal weight and pH values were not different among rats fed diets containing 10% lactulose, pectin or guar gum, or 25% amylomaize starch. However, the cecal wall weight was markedly higher with lactulose feeding than with the other polysaccharides, whereas volatile fatty acid concentrations were lower with lactulose. The fiber diets depressed cecal ammonia, particularly in the case of the amylomaize starch diet, whereas the lactulose diet enhanced the concentration of ammonia. Owing to cecal enlargement and enhanced blood flow, the diets containing fermentable carbohydrates promoted a higher flux of urea to the cecum and also higher ammonia absorption in spite of low concentrations of ammonia in the cecum. Lactulose led to particularly high transfer of urea and absorption of ammonia. High blood urea in rats fed a 50% casein diet led to a very high flux of urea to the cecum and, hence, to high ammonia absorption. The presence of polysaccharides amplified the flux of urea and ammonia in the cecum. This study suggests that oligosaccharides such as lactulose, although very effective for the acidification of the contents of the large intestine, may enhance cecal ammonia and its absorption. Polysaccharides such as amylomaize starch might show greater efficiency for lowering ammonia concentrations in the large intestine.\r"

The FF and CWB groups consumed unvaried diets throughout the day. The IWB group consumed two consecutive meals of a 50% bran diet for a total of 4 hr each day followed by a fiber-free diet for the remaining hours of the day. Similar daily quantities of bran were consumed in the CWB and IWB groups. Dry fecal weights rose significantly and transit times declined in both bran-fed groups independent of the meal distribution of bran. Colonic cell proliferation (estimated by thymidine kinase activity) was similar in all groups. The results suggest that these physiological effects of wheat bran are independent of the meal distribution of the bran.\r"

Vitamin A content and TCDD-derived radioactivity were estimated in the parenchymal cells and in the stellate cells, which were identified and quantified in these fractions. Similar levels of vitamin A (0.3 +/- 0.4 nmol per million cells or 0.5 +/- 0.7 mumol per liver; values are mean +/- SD for 56 rats) were found in parenchymal cells from both control and TCDD-treated rats. However, while the vitamin A content of stellate cells increased from 14 to 46 nmol per million cells (i.e., from 1.7 to 7.7 mumol per liver) in control rats over the course of the study, stellate cells from TCDD-exposed rats showed no increase in vitamin A level until at least 25 d after exposure and remained at a level about 30% below the controls thereafter. TCDD-derived radioactivity resided mainly in the parenchymal cell compartment, although stellate cells contained more radioactivity per cell. Most of the radioactivity in parenchymal cells was eliminated with a half-life of 13 d, whereas the remainder persisted with an elimination half-life of 70 d. The elimination half-life in stellate cells was estimated to be 52 d. Thus, TCDD inhibited storage of vitamin A in stellate cells until 60-90% of the TCDD-derived radioactivity had been eliminated from the liver.\r"

Weanling male Sprague-Dawley rats were fed purified test diets containing 8% of one of 10 test triglycerides (either tributyrin, tricaproin, tricaprylin, tricaprin, trilaurin, trimyristin, tripalmitin, tristearin, triolein, trilinolein) or corn oil (a mixed triglyceride) for 23 d after an initial 1-wk stabilization period. Essential fatty acids were provided by safflower oil (8 g/kg diet). Total liver fatty acid composition showed the expected responses to dietary fatty acid intake; short-chain and medium-chain fatty acids were readily elongated to palmitate and stearate, and palmitate and stearate were readily desaturated. Consumption of oleate or linoleate (as their triglycerides) markedly enriched their concentrations in liver lipids. The proportions of palmitate were generally greater in liver retinyl esters than in total liver fatty acids, and the proportions of oleate were less. However, retinyl ester composition was significantly affected by dietary triglyceride, particularly by diets providing long-chain fatty acids. Total liver vitamin A levels were depressed in the group fed trilinolein.\r"

Ascorbic acid levels were also measured to determine the effect of tumor growth and supplementary ascorbate on cellular ascorbic acid levels. Ascorbate addition at levels of up to 200 micrograms/ml was found to inhibit the in vitro growth of BL6 cells but not of LLCMK cells. Ascorbic acid levels in both cell types were very similar. The presence of tumors was found to reduce liver ascorbic acid levels in mice. Supplementary dietary ascorbate increased liver and tumor ascorbic acid levels and also reduced the growth of BL6 melanomas transplanted in C57 mice. Ascorbate thus appears to play a role in suppression of BL6 melanoma growth.\r"

Methylated metabolites of niacin, N1-methylnicotinamide (NMN) and N1-methyl-2-pyridone-5-carboxamide (2-pyr), in urine and plasma were determined during periods of low (6.1 or 10.1 NE per day), adequate (19 NE per day = 1 RDA) and high (25 or 32 NE per day) niacin intakes and after small test doses of nicotinamide. Urine excretion of less than 1.2 mg/d of either NMN or 2-pyr was a reliable indicator of subjects receiving the lowest intake of 6.1 NE/d, but the NMN metabolite was a better marker of subjects ingesting 10.1 NE/d. The ratio of 2-pyr/NMN in urine was not as good a measure of the 6.1 NE/d intake as the individual metabolite excretions and was not responsive to the 10.1 NE/d intake. Plasma niacin metabolites were generally not as reliable as urinary metabolites for identifying subjects receiving low niacin intakes, however, values for plasma 2-pyr dropped quickly and were eventually nondetectable. After a 1 RDA oral dose of nicotinamide, increases in urine and plasma 2-pyr levels above pre-dose baseline values were significantly decreased in subjects receiving low, as compared to adequate, niacin intake. A leucine supplement had no effect on the rate of repletion of niacin-deficient subjects nor on the level of methylated niacin metabolites in urine or plasma.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of iron on zinc absorption in the rat, and vice versa, was investigated from single starch:sucrose test meals (containing 65Zn or 59Fe) by whole body counting. Zinc had no effect on iron absorption, but iron reduced zinc absorption when the total ionic species in the meal (iron plus zinc) reached 1.36 mg. Below this level, high iron:zinc molar ratios (10:1) had no effect on zinc absorption, presumably because the transport mechanism for zinc had not reached full capacity. Previous iron intake had no effect on zinc absorption. The relevance of these findings to infant foods was explored by feeding rats exclusively a vegetable or cereal weaning product, with or without additional iron, for 12 d and measuring zinc and iron status. The added iron raised body iron stores and caused a small reduction in zinc status in animals fed the oat, but not the vegetable, diet as measured by plasma and femur zinc concentrations. Since the threshold level of 1.36 mg ionic species would be exceeded when the animal ate 3-4 g of the iron-fortified weaning food at any one time, it appears that the iron:zinc interactive effect was absent in the vegetable and less potent in the oat formulation than in a carbohydrate test meal. Alternatively, it may be the case that the animals had responded over time to reduced zinc availability by increasing whole body zinc retention.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Amino acid-defined diets deficient in methyl groups have been shown to result in a very high incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma. It has been suggested that this is a result of decreased levels of S-adenosylmethionine and the undermethylation of DNA. Accordingly, the enzyme glycine N-methyltransferase (GNMT, EC 2.1.1.20) may play a major role in maintaining the levels of S-adenosylmethionine in liver in response to changes in dietary methionine. The effect of methyl-deficient, amino acid-defined diets on GNMT activity and S-adenosylmethionine levels in rat liver was therefore investigated. When rats were fed a defined amino acid diet containing no choline in which homocysteine was substituted for the methionine of the control diet at an equimolar level, there was a rapid and marked decrease in growth rate in spite of the fact that the rats consumed 85% of the food eaten by control rats fed a nutritionally adequate, defined amino acid diet. The GNMT activity in livers of methyl-deficient rats decreased rapidly, but there was no difference in amount of GNMT protein as measured immunologically. In methyl-deficient rats, the levels of S-adenosylmethionine were maintained but the levels of S-adenosylhomocysteine were rapidly elevated compared to control values. These changes are consistent with the postulated role of GNMT in regulating methyl group metabolism.\r"

The basal diet used was low in calcium and high in phosphorus and chlorine and known to promote a high incidence of tibial dyschondroplasia in broiler chickens. The chickens in all experiments received enough ultraviolet radiation from fluorescent lights in the pens to nearly satisfy their need for vitamin D. The addition of disulfiram to the diet caused an increase in most of the measurements indicating development of tibial dyschondroplasia in all of the experiments, and caused a decrease in bone ash in two of the experiments and a decrease in growth and gain:feed in one experiment. The addition of D3 to a diet containing no D3 caused higher bone ash and lower incidence of tibial dyschondroplasia in the absence or presence of disulfiram. The effects of the addition of 25-OHD3 to diets containing approximately five times the requirement of D3 in the absence and presence of disulfiram caused variable results. The addition of 1,25-(OH)2D3 to the D3-supplemented diet in the absence or presence of disulfiram caused dramatic increases in bone ash and a decrease in most of the criteria used to measure development of tibial dyschondroplasia. There was no indication of interaction of the effects of D3, 25-OHD3 and 1,25-(OH)2D3 with the action of disulfiram.\r"

The accumulation of DNA strand breaks, as assessed by DNA unwinding in alkali, was found to be significantly elevated in lymphocytes from rats fed the methyl donor-deficient diet and was associated with an increase in mitogen-stimulated incorporation of [3H]-thymidine via the salvage pathway for thymidylate synthesis. In addition, a significant decrease in the DNA repair-associated pyridine nucleotide, NAD, was observed in lymphocytes from the deficient group and was associated with a decrease in total spleen cell numbers. These results suggest that alterations in nucleotide metabolism and DNA damage are induced when methyl donor pools are stressed by dietary deficiency.\r"

At baseline, the mean serum beta-carotene level in ferrets was 0.6 micrograms/dl and no beta-carotene was present in liver or adipose tissue. After the ferrets were fed 4 or 20 mg of beta-carotene/kg body wt daily for 2 wk, serum levels were 15.3 and 41.5 micrograms/dl, liver values were 0.9 and 4.1 micrograms/g and adipose tissue values were 0.1 and 0.2 microgram/g of beta-carotene, respectively. Thus, like humans, ferrets are able to absorb dietary beta-carotene intact. Further, these animals can store quantifiable amounts of dietary beta-carotene in their liver and, to a lesser extent, in adipose tissue. In contrast, serum beta-carotene levels in rats fed the two levels of beta-carotene were very low (0.5 to 0.6 microgram/dl) and no beta-carotene was found in liver or adipose tissue. Thus, the ferret is a more appropriate animal model for studying the intestinal absorption of beta-carotene and its storage and metabolism in body tissues.\r"
