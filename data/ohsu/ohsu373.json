  ".W": "A murine model of long-term colonization with Candida albicans, established by intubating infant CBA/J mice, was used to study the effects of colonization on the development of Candida-specific immune responses in mature animals. Two striking consequences were stimulation of protective immune responses, as evidenced by increased survival and decreased numbers of colony-forming units in mice challenged intravenously (iv), and priming of the T cell component responsible for delayed hypersensitivity (DH). Colonized mice, tested as adults by using a cell wall-derived antigen, had little or no demonstrable DH. If inoculated once cutaneously with viable Candida, however, they responded with significantly enhanced DH reactions that could not be correlated with the cutaneous inoculation. Inoculation of the same number of dead organisms into infant mice neither primed animals for enhanced DH nor stimulated protective immunity. Antibody to cytoplasmic antigens of Candida was demonstrable in colonized animals, and its production was increased significantly in animals challenged iv with the highest dose of blastoconidia.\r"

  ".W": "Because patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) consistently lack sweating response to isoproterenol (ISO) in vivo and in vitro, we studied to what extent beta-adrenergic defect is expressed in CF heterozygotes. To improve the sensitivity and accuracy of determining the sweating response to intradermal ISO (also containing theophylline and atropine), a water vapor analyzer was used, and the peak sweat rates attained after intradermal injection in the forearm of optimal concentrations of ISO and methacholine (MCH) were determined. The peak ISO sweat rate was further normalized by the peak MCH sweat rate in each individual and expressed as the relative ISO sweat ratemax (in percent). The relative ISO sweat ratemax was determined independent of age and sex and was unchanged after brief acclimatization. The mean relative ISO sweat ratemax of CF heterozygotes was significantly lower than that of controls (10.1% vs 19.5%); however, 21 of the 54 CF heterozygotes overlapped with controls, and the remainder of the CF heterozygotes fell below the arbitrary demarcation line drawn at the relative sweat rate of around 10%. Thus, although the ISO sweat test may not be a practical discrimination test for CF heterozygotes, knowledge of the diversity of beta-adrenergic sweating responses in CF heterozygotes will provide a useful data base for further understanding the possible linkage (or its absence) between the abnormal CF gene(s) (which may be identified by molecular biologists in the near future) and the abnormal intracellular process(es) that takes place during beta-adrenergic stimulation of the CF eccrine sweat gland.\r"

In 87 of these cases, the biopsy was performed stereotactically. In the remaining 13 cases, a CT-guided free hand technique was used. Of the 100 biopsies performed, adequate tissue for histopathologic diagnosis was obtained in 97, and in three the biopsy was nondiagnostic. In 61 procedures the initial biopsy specimen was adequate for diagnosis. Two specimens were required in 25 and in the remaining cases it was necessary to obtain three to four biopsy specimens before a definitive diagnosis could be made. Ultimately, the histologic diagnosis was made on frozen section examination in 93 of the cases. The lesions identified were neoplastic disease in 83 cases, vascular disease in seven, infectious disease in five, demyelinating disease in one, and radiation necrosis in one. Comparison between the frozen section diagnosis and the final diagnosis based on the permanent sections revealed that they matched in 89 cases (92%). Of the 83 cases of neoplasms the exact grade of malignancy was determined by frozen section to make a final diagnosis revealed that even if the specimen volume was less than 2 mm3, the biopsy was generally successful. The disadvantages of the small sample size obtained through needle biopsy are best overcome by careful targeting and assessment of sample quality by intraoperative frozen section examinations, which will give the definitive diagnosis in most of the cases without paraffin-embedded sections.\r"

Other peroxisomal functions were normal, including levels of very long chain fatty acids, pipecolic acid, and bile acid intermediates, and immunoblot studies of peroxisomal acyl-CoA oxidase and bifunctional enzyme in postmortem liver. Unlike what is observed in Zellweger syndrome and neonatal ALD, catalase activity in cultured skin fibroblasts was sedimentable, indicating that peroxisome structure is not grossly deficient in RCDP.

All nine infants had markedly elevated peripheral renin values, 134.3 +/- 128.1 ng/mL/hr (mean +/- SD). Five infants had abnormal renal sonographic and perfusion scans with evidence of renal artery thrombosis, parenchymal disease, or both. Captopril therapy (0.3 mg/kg) was instituted at a postnatal age of 123 +/- 108 days. After the initial dose, the systolic BP decreased significantly in all infants, the decrease ranging from 21% to 58% of the pretreatment value. Dosage was subsequently halved in all infants. Seventeen episodes of unpredictable decreases in BP more than 40% from baseline occurred during the reduced maintenance therapy. Four infants had a total of seven episodes during which the BP decreased by 57 +/- 10% from baseline; this decrease persisted for 17 +/- 6 hours and was unresponsive to volume reexpansion and inotropic therapy. All seven episodes were accompanied by oliguria (urine output less than 1 mL/kg/hr) that persisted for 18 +/- 12 hours. These episodes were accompanied by neurologic signs (subtle seizures, lethargy, and/or apnea) within 18 +/- 6 hours after the onset of oliguria. The remaining five infants had a total of 13 episodes of decreased BP of 50 +/- 8% of baseline, which were of significantly shorter duration and responded to volume reexpanders, inotropic therapy, or both and were unaccompanied by oliguria. These data suggest the need for close observation of BP in infants receiving maintenance captopril therapy.\r"

Significant cardiovascular risk factors are identifiable and alterable in children and adolescents, and are associated with arterial lesions. Cost-effective atherosclerosis prevention can be achieved by identification and treatment of high-risk children and adolescents. The pediatrician should record the family history of all patients at 2 years of age, with periodic updates. The serum cholesterol concentration can then be measured in the office if there is a commitment to quality control; otherwise, a monitored commercial laboratory must be used. It is not unreasonable to measure serum cholesterol concentrations once in all school-age patients. The majority of high-risk patients will respond to nutritional intervention and will not require pharmacotherapy. Until the efficacy and safety of the therapeutic diet are proved beyond doubt, its use should be limited to high-risk patients under pediatric supervision. Studies documenting the growth and development of children receiving dietary therapy must be a major priority of pediatric nutrition. Until that is accomplished, although some pediatricians may prefer to wait, most will use the extensive scientific evidence at hand and their clinical judgment to identify and treat their high-risk patients.\r"

  ".W": "This study examines the metabolism of 125I-angiotensin II (125I-ANG II) and 125I-angiotensin III (applied 125I-ANG III or 125I-ANG IIIapp) by membrane peptidases. The first step in the metabolism of 125I-ANG II was the formation of 125I-ANG III (generated 125I-ANG III or 125I-ANG IIIgen). The ability of both ANG II and ANG III to reduce 125I-ANG IIIgen production without ANG(1-5), ANG(2-5), amastatin or bestatin being similarly effective suggests that this step may be highly substrate-specific. Subsequent metabolism of 125I-ANG IIIgen was similar to that of 125I-ANG IIIapp in that 125I-ANG(2-7) and 125I-ANG(2-4) fragments were produced. The formation of 125I-ANG(2-7) appeared to be a very substrate-specific process because it was only inhibited by ANG II and ANG III. In contrast, the production of 125I-ANG(2-4) was unaffected at the concentration of inhibitors used and is considered to be a relatively nonspecific process. However, despite these similarities sequential N-terminal cleavage leading to the formation of 125I-ANG(3-8), 125I-ANG(4-8) and 125I-Tyrosine appears to be the preferred pathway in the metabolism of 125I-ANG IIIapp. The absence of this pathway in the metabolism of 125I-ANG IIIgen suggests that applied and generated 125I-ANG III may be metabolized in separate degradative compartments. These data demonstrate that 125I-ANG II and 125I-ANG III are metabolized by membrane-bound peptidases in an orderly and sequential manner.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Smooth muscle cells were isolated from the dog gallbladder and used to examine whether bombesin-14 and substance P cause direct contraction and whether this effect is mediated by the same or different receptors. Both peptides caused concentration-dependent contraction that was inhibited by two substance P derivatives, [D-Pro2,D-Trp7,9]SP ([PTT]SP) and [D-Arg1,D-Pro2,D-Trp7,9,Leu11]SP ([APTTL]SP). In nonmuscle cells, these substance P derivatives exhibit preferential antagonism of responses to substance P and bombesin, respectively; accordingly, these properties were used to demonstrate the presence of separate bombesin and substance P receptors. Estimates of the apparent Ki showed that [PTT]SP was 40 times more potent than [APTTL]SP as an antagonist of the response to substance P, whereas [APTTL]SP was 85 times more potent than [PTT]SP as an antagonist of the response to bombesin-14. Estimates of median inhibitory concentration obtained from inhibition curves for the effect of various concentrations of each antagonist on the responses to substance P and bombesin-14 confirmed that [PTT]SP was a preferential antagonist of the response to substance P and [APTTL]SP, a preferential antagonist of the response to bombesin-14. The results demonstrate the presence of separate bombesin and substance P receptors mediating contraction of smooth muscle cells of the dog gallbladder.\r"

  ".W": "Several phenylhydrazone derivatives of oxymorphone [phenylhydrazone and p-nitrophenylhydrazone (OxyPNPH)] as well as oxymorphonazine produce a wash-resistant inhibition of radiolabeled opioid binding, suggesting nonequilibrium binding to opiate receptors. All are agonists and, in an effort to correlate their prolonged inhibition of binding with their pharmacology, we examined their analgesic actions in vivo. Dose-response curves at 1 hr revealed similar potencies of oxymorphone and the derivatives, with the exception of OxyPNPH which was significantly less potent. After 10 hr, oxymorphone at doses up to 50 mg/kg did not demonstrate any effect. In contrast, OxyPNPH at 25 mg/kg elevated tail-flick latencies from 2 to over 8 sec after 10 hr. The 50-mg/kg dose elevated latencies to approximately 5 sec after 24 hr. Oxymorphonazine and oxymorphone phenylhydrazone also produced a prolonged analgesia, although not as effectively as OxyPNPH. The prolonged analgesic actions of OxyPNPH were highly dependent upon a critical period of 2 to 3 h immediately after injection. Blockade of receptors during this period with naloxone prevented analgesia at all time points examined. If the long duration of action of OxyPNPH resulted simply from a long half-life and persistent-free compound within the brain, analgesia should have returned by 8 hr, at which time naloxone has been eliminated. The absence of analgesia 8 hr after both OxyPNPH and naloxone argues against simple pharmacokinetic mechanisms for the prolonged analgesia and is consistent with persistent receptor occupation. OxyPNPH (25 mg/kg) administered in vivo lowered radiolabeled opioid binding effectively in brain membranes despite extensive washing. OxyPNPH lowered mu1 binding by approximately 60% and mu2 binding by 35% whereas delta binding was not lowered significantly.\r"

  ".W": "Antepartum testing in postdate pregnancy was reviewed. No method of testing has been uniformly found to prevent all antepartum deaths in pregnancies with confirmed dates greater than 42 weeks. Perinatal mortality varies according to both the test and the institution. When comparing results according to the method of testing, perinatal mortality appears to be lowest (1.8/1,000) with the use of a 3-cm vertical pocket on ultrasound. Nearly as good is the use of a contraction stress test (2.5/1,000) on a weekly basis. Ultrasound using a 1-cm pocket and a biweekly non-stress test (NST) resulted in slightly worse perinatal mortality (5/1,000 and 6/1,000, respectively). If variable decelerations during the NST are not interpreted as abnormal, the perinatal mortality using a biweekly NST is 15/1,000. Induction of labor at 41-42 weeks with a favorable Bishop score will obviate the need for antepartum testing in some patients.\r"

The antenatal diagnosis corresponded to the postnatal diagnosis in 66 per cent of the cases. We review the course of 6 fetuses who had catheters placed percutaneously to drain dilated urinary tracts that were believed to be caused by posterior urethral valves (5) or an obstructed megaureter (1). Only 2 of these fetuses exhibited valves postnatally. No fetus had any recognized benefit from the antenatal intervention. We found that sonography may not readily differentiate fetuses with hydronephrosis with obstruction from those without obstruction. From this experience we conclude that intervention in pregnancies suspected of harboring a fetus with a malformed urinary tract should be done cautiously. Antenatal sonography is useful to identify the fetus with a dilated urinary tract. This identification permits perinatal specialists to be alerted so that preparations for reconstructive surgery in such cases can be made early postpartum.\r"

We previously described our digitization system and measured the perimeter and area of a microscopic circle similar in size to prostatic carcinoma nuclei with a reproducibility and accuracy of greater than 95%. We have applied our improved system to nuclear contour digitization and standardized our method for NRF measurement. In order to calculate accurately the NRF for prostatic carcinoma, the histologic section must have been reviewed by a pathologist and 150 nuclei traced after random selection. NRF measurement reproducibility within and between observers exceeded 90%. This system for NRF measurement successfully predicted outcome in 13 of 15 patients with stages A2, B1, and B2 prostatic carcinoma. Our success with a carefully tested and improved system for NRF determination warrants further evaluation of NRF for assessment of prognosis of patients with prostatic carcinoma.\r"

This occurred even though testosterone levels (50% of normal) were ostensibly high enough to maintain normal tumor growth. Melatonin may act directly upon the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone to inhibit tumor growth. Alternatively, a more complicated mechanism may be involved since studies on MCF breast cancer tissue indicate an estrogen requirement for inhibition of growth by melatonin.\r"

This technique was compared to the classic renal repair using chromic suture and a patch of perirenal fat. The repair with butyl cyanoacrylate was less time consuming (four minutes vs. 28 minutes for the controls) and decreased blood loss (67 cc vs. 180 cc for the controls). Ten days post injury the kidneys repaired with tissue adhesive showed minimal intraparenchymal hemorrhage or perirenal bleeding, while two of the four (50%) suture-repaired kidneys showed intrarenal microhemorrhages and one (25%) developed a perirenal hematoma. Perirenal adhesions were noted in both groups. Vital signs, IVP's, creatinine clearance, and serum and urine chemistries were nearly identical in the two groups. The results show that low-velocity ballistic injuries of renal tissue can be repaired effectively and more efficiently with the use of butyl cyanoacrylate when compared to conventional suturing methods.\r"

Renal function was determined in all patients and the recurrences of P-fimbriated Escherichia coli bacteriuria, cystitis and acute pyelonephritis during a 3-year followup were studied. We found a significant correlation between the P-fimbriae receptor accessibility on uroepithelial cells and glomerular filtration rate (r equals -0.75, p less than 0.001). Uroepithelial cells from the patients with chronic pyelonephritis and renal insufficiency had a higher binding capacity of P-fimbriated Escherichia coli than uroepithelial cells from patients with a normal glomerular filtration rate.

In each case the diagnosis was obtained by fractioned microbiological study via the method of Meares and Stamey. This test was repeated 4, 12 and 24 weeks after the end of treatment. Of the patients 25 (49 per cent) were cured microbiologically, 11 (21.5 per cent) were cured after a second cycle of treatment and the remaining 15 (29.4 per cent) failed to respond. The clinical cure rate was 43.1 per cent and 41.1 per cent of the patients were improved. After 6 months 5 patients had relapse and 1 had reinfection. No differences were observed with both antimicrobials. The microbiological cure indexes of 70.5 and 58.8 per cent after 3 and 6 months, respectively, compared favorably with that obtained by oral therapy with antimicrobials that reach effective levels in the prostatic fluid. Transitory post-injection hemospermia was observed in 11 patients. Together with pain during or after injection (8 and 5 patients, respectively), these were the sole adverse effects observed with this therapy.\r"

Our data suggest that aspiration biopsy has specificity and sensitivity similar to core biopsy, it is important to re-test patients who have a palpable abnormality and an initially benign biopsy, and aspiration biopsy simplicity allows for a low threshold of suspicion of subtle abnormalities and for repeating biopsies after negative findings.\r"

The aim of this study was to clarify how much DHR may improve the prognostic capacity of nutritional assessment (NA). Nutritional and immunological evaluations were performed at admission on 405 patients undergoing elective general surgical procedures. Subjects with serum albumin less than or equal to 3.0 g/dl or total iron-binding capacity less than or equal to 220 micrograms/dl or weight loss greater than or equal to 10% with respect to usual body weight were classified as malnourished. DHR was assessed by performing skin tests with four recall antigens: PPD, candida, trichophyton, sk-sd. The incidence of postoperative complications resulted higher among the 187 malnourished patients (31.0%) than in the 218 well-nourished ones (14.2%) (p less than 0.001), and among the 213 anergic patients (29.6%) than in the 192 normal responders (13.5%) (p less than 0.001). To determine how much skin tests may improve the prognostic ability of NA, the relationship between DHR and postoperative complications was also studied in the malnourished and in the well-nourished patients, separately. In the malnourished group, the patients with an impairment of DHR had a higher incidence of postoperative infections than normal responders (p less than 0.05). In the well-nourished group, no significant differences were found between anergic patients and normal responders. In our study, DHR slightly improved the prognostic capacity of NA. Therefore, the first approach to identify the high-risk patients seems to be the unexpensive, quick and available determination of nutritional status.\r"

  ".W": "Over the past several decades, research on the role of mediators in inflammation, immunity, repair processes, cell growth, and substrate metabolism have centered around the use of purified products of stimulated macrophages. With the current availability of recombinant mediators, the participation of individual monokines in cellular metabolism has been more clearly defined. Interactions among various mediators have been demonstrated, but their exact role in metabolism is currently under intense study. With the use of recombinant monokines, formal evidence for their participation in the acute phase response has been developed. Their use has also assisted in the reinterpretation of data gathered in older studies using purified preparations, which were almost certainly contaminated with several monokines. In this review we will try to give the reader insight into recent advances in the understanding of the role of cellular mediators in relation to nutrition and intermediary metabolism. With a clearer knowledge of the role of cellular mediators in the pathophysiology of disease, it may be possible to develop rationales for their therapeutic use as modulators of substrate metabolism during critical illness.\r"

The enzyme was isolated from human liver and the urinary analysis performed with radioimmunoassay. Patients receiving cyclosporine A without toxicity or rejection did not excrete this enzyme in their urine; whereas the urine of patients with cyclosporine A-induced nephrotoxicity contained significant amounts of the transferase (P less than 0.001). Patients with allograft rejection also showed increased urinary concentrations of the basic glutathione transferase, but had significantly lower values than patients with cyclosporine induced nephrotoxicity (P less than 0.001). During aminoglycoside and co-trimoxazole treatment, the urinary concentration of this transferase also increased. Patients with renal infarction showed a sudden increase in urinary transferase to very high levels. The results indicate that quantitative analysis of the basic glutathione transferase in urine is useful for monitoring renal tubular lesions present in various complications following transplantation, such as cyclosporine and antibiotic induced nephrotoxicity and renal infarction.\r"

Twenty-four cardiac transplant recipients treated with azathioprine for more than 24 months served as controls. Despite equivalent cardiac performance, GFR in those treated with CsA was depressed, 47 +/- 3 versus 94 +/- 4 ml/min/1.73 m2 (P less than 0.001). CsA therapy was also associated with significant elevation of renal vascular resistance (RVR), proteinuria, arterial hypertension, and impaired intrarenal conversion of inactive prorenin to active renin. Histopathological changes associated with CsA included an obliterative arteriolopathy with deposition of proteinaceous material in necrotic arteriolar walls, and associated tubulointerstitial damage. A minority of glomeruli exhibited either ischemic collapse or sclerosis. Area perimeter analysis revealed enlargement of the remaining glomeruli with significant expansion of the mesangium. Longitudinal examination over a 48 month period (N = 15) during which CsA was reduced in dosage or withdrawn revealed persistent hypofiltration, increasingly elevated RVR and heavier proteinuria. Further histopathological deterioration was observed when renal tissue was sampled a second time in six patients, and three members of the experimental group developed end-stage renal disease. We conclude that continuous CsA therapy for more than 12 months causes a chronic injury to renal microvessels that is rarely reversible and potentially progressive.\r"

  ".W": "Technological and immunological developments within the last decade have evolved a variety of therapeutic modalities by which ESRD may be satisfactorily managed. With the exception of renal transplantation between identical twins, none of these modalities provide permanent and complete correction of the uremic state, however, and the challenge now facing those involved in the management of irreversible renal failure is to devise an individualized treatment program permitting optimal long-term physical and psychological well-being and the maintenance of a valuable and productive role in society. Such a goal is most effectively achieved by an integrated approach combining both dialysis and renal transplantation. In the program proposed and utilized at our institution, all therapeutic options are presented to the patient with incipient renal failure, and a rational long-term management strategy devised based on clinical status, psychological stability, convenience, and acceptability. Dialysis is normally employed as a limited term maintenance procedure pending renal transplantation from a living or cadaver donor, thus permitting optimal correction of the uremic state. Early rehabilitation and social reintegration are actively pursued to minimize disease impact and maximize quality of life. In subjects with chronic deterioration of graft function, retransplantation may be performed prior to requirement for dialysis, thus minimizing hospitalization time, cost, and social disruption. The definition of risk factors predicting graft success has facilitated the individualization of therapy within this integrated program. While allograft survival exceeding 90% may now be anticipated in the non-sensitized first-graft recipient, predicted outcome is poor in subjects who are highly sensitized following previous transplantation or with rapid loss of a prior graft.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "(1) There is no single measurement of adequacy in dialysis available now, and there likely never will be. (2) With present knowledge, it is rational to model patients for removal of both small and middle molecules. Minimum weekly clearances for urea and for a middle molecule the size of Vitamin B12 should be 120 and 30 liters per week per 1.73 m2 respectively. (3) In prescribing a dialysis treatment, a Kt/v urea greater than 1 should be targeted, a value of under 0.8 is unacceptable. (4) Attention to the nutritional status of the patient is important, and one should strive for a PCR of 1.1 to 1.3 g/kg/day. (5) Studies on living cells (for example, platelets) and systems (for example, CNS function) are valuable if there is doubt as to the patient's status. (6) Assessments of treatment stresses and quality of life should be used in monitoring dialysis patients. (7) In clinical trials of different treatment methods, it is important to equate findings to solute clearance profiles and to include studies on functions of cells or systems and to measure the impact of the treatment upon quality of life.\r"

This tumor occurs primarily in young women (mean age 23.3 years) and presents as a large abdominal mass (mean size 10.3 cm) in 63% of patients. Treatment is surgical resection of the involved portions of the pancreas and results of treatment are excellent following this form of therapy alone. The tumor appears to represent a low-grade malignancy, possibly of ductal cell origin. Only two patients with recurrences and two patients with metastatic disease have been reported. Surgeons should be aware of this curable pancreatic malignancy as they are most often responsible for the evaluation and treatment of the patient presenting with a large abdominal mass.\r"

We first reviewed our results with coronary artery bypass graft in equivalent patients in the Coronary Artery Surgery Study with one- and two-vessel disease between 1976 and 1981. Among 1376 patients, hospital mortality was 0.07%, and 5-year survival was 95.2% +/- 0.8%. To define trends in invasive therapy, which have since occurred, we compared 100 patients with one- and two-vessel disease in each of three groups: 1979 coronary artery bypass graft, 1984 coronary artery bypass graft, and 1984 percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. Preoperative characteristics in the average 1979 and 1984 patients were similar; however, in 1984, patients who had a coronary artery bypass graft were older than patients who had percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (61.5 versus 56.7 years, p less than 0.01), they required more heart medications (2.1 versus 1.5, p less than 0.01), had more previous infarctions (0.8 versus 0.5, p less than 0.01), and more patients had an ejection fraction of less than 50% (34% versus 7%, p less than 0.01). Patients who had angioplasty had a shorter postoperative stay (median number of days 7, 7, 2, p less than 0.01). Freedom from major complications was similar among the groups (91%, 87%, 85%). Unstable symptoms were the most frequent indication for invasive therapy (approximately 80%), whereas long-term symptoms, those considered in the randomized trials, occurred in relatively few patients. The number of patients without at least one definite indication for invasive therapy was 13%, 3%, and 11%, p less than 0.05, suggesting that the indications for the 1984 coronary artery bypass graft group have become more restrictive since the 1979 coronary artery bypass graft group. Indications for the 1984 percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty group remained less restrictive, being similar to those for the 1979 coronary artery bypass graft group. A continuing trend toward the use of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty was evident, as 56% of the 1979 coronary artery bypass graft group of patients and 32% of the 1984 coronary bypass group of patients would be offered percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty rather than coronary artery bypass graft on the basis of 1986 percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty criteria. The p values were obtained with analysis of variance or chi 2 test.\r"

Because lactate can be readily metabolized to pyruvate, it may be the preferred substrate for aerobic metabolism after cardioplegic arrest when arterial concentrations are elevated. Nineteen patients undergoing elective coronary revascularization with blood cardioplegia were randomized to receive LOW (nine patients, no exogenous lactate) or HIGH (10 patients, a perioperative infusion of Ringer's lactate) arterial lactate concentrations. Coronary sinus catheterization and lactate labeled with carbon 14 permitted calculation of myocardial oxygen consumption and lactate oxidation which were significantly increased during reperfusion in the group with HIGH arterial lactate concentrations. Atrial pacing at 110 beats/min on cardiopulmonary bypass resulted in myocardial lactate production (suggesting ischemic anaerobic metabolism) in the LOW lactate group, but atrial pacing increased lactate consumption and oxidation in the HIGH lactate group (suggesting increased aerobic metabolism). Systolic function (the relation between end-systolic pressure and volume) as assessed by nuclear ventriculography 3 hours postoperatively was significantly better (p less than 0.05 by analysis of covariance) in the HIGH lactate group. Postoperative myocardial creatine kinase release was significantly lower in the HIGH lactate group, which suggested less perioperative ischemic injury. Lactate was the preferred substrate for myocardial oxidative metabolism after cardioplegic arrest, and the higher arterial lactate concentrations improved myocardial metabolic and functional recovery and reduced perioperative ischemic injury.\r"

  ".U": "88201262\r", 
  ".W": "Cardiopulmonary bypass in children with congenital heart disease is associated with significant morbidity manifested by increased complement degradation products, heightened pulmonary vascular activity, and coagulopathy. In adults with cardiac disease, the prostaglandins (eicosanoids) have been shown to contribute to the pathophysiologic response to extracorporeal circulation. This study assessed the effect of cardiopulmonary bypass in infants and children on two potent eicosanoids: thromboxane, a vasoconstrictor and platelet aggregating agent, and prostacyclin, a vasodilator and platelet disaggregating agent. The biochemical profiles of thromboxane and prostacyclin were evaluated in temporal relationship to selected parameters of platelet loss and pulmonary vascular hemodynamics during and after cardiopulmonary bypass. Twenty-one children, aged 3 days to 9 years, with congenital heart defects who were undergoing repair with cardiopulmonary bypass were studied. Nine pediatric patients undergoing palliative heart operations with no cardiopulmonary bypass served as the control group. In the group having cardiopulmonary bypass, the thromboxane concentration significantly increased during bypass (195 +/- 10 to 910 +/- 240 pg/ml, +/- standard error of the mean, p less than 0.005), whereas the control group demonstrated no significant change in thromboxane concentration. The highest thromboxane values were seen in the youngest patients (p less than 0.002). There was no significant correlation between thromboxane changes with alterations in pulmonary vascular resistance, platelet loss, duration of cardiopulmonary bypass or aortic cross-clamping. Prostacyclin levels rose significantly in both the bypass group (100 +/- 20 to 570 +/- 80 pg/ml, p less than 0.01) and in the control group (109 +/- 44 to 589 +/- 222 pg/ml, p less than 0.01), which apparently is due to surgical manipulation of vascular endothelium. These data show that eicosanoid production is significantly altered in children during cardiopulmonary bypass. Although thromboxane, a potent vasoconstrictor, is produced in significant amounts during and after cardiopulmonary bypass, our data show that thromboxane does not directly mediate changes in pulmonary artery hypertension and is not quantitatively related to platelet loss during pediatric cardiovascular operations.\r"

  ".U": "88201275\r", 
  ".W": "Between 1979 and 1986, 30 patients underwent replacement of the aortic valve and ascending aorta by a composite graft, with aortic wrapping of the graft. Thirteen patients had annuloaortic ectasia; six had DeBakey type I dissection (five acute, one chronic); three had DeBakey type II dissection (one acute, two chronic); three had left ventricular-aortic discontinuity caused by prosthetic valve endocarditis; three had sinus of Valsalva aneurysms after previous aortic valve procedures; and two had atherosclerotic aneurysms. Three patients died (10%). The mean duration of follow-up was 54 months. Fifteen patients consented to be restudied by intra-arterial digital subtraction angiography; studies were performed 6 to 58 months (mean 25 months) after composite graft replacement. Two patients had pseudoaneurysms at the right coronary anastomosis, which were repaired successfully. One patient showed persistent dissection beyond the distal aortic anastomosis; no reoperation has been done. One patient had pulmonary edema. Emergency study and reoperation showed disruption of the proximal aortic anastomosis and right coronary anastomosis. Anastomotic dehiscence after composite graft replacement is potentially lethal. Follow-up by means of intra-arterial digital subtraction angiography is simple and highly accurate. We suggest that dehiscences may occur early in the postoperative period and that restudy may be appropriate within a few months after operation.\r"

  ".W": "Estrogen replacement therapy is effective for the prevention and treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis and should be offered to all women at high risk for osteoporosis. Such therapy is particularly beneficial for prevention of spinal compression fractures; in addition, it alleviates menopausal symptoms (hot flushes, genitourinary symptoms, and changes in mood). In each patient, these benefits must be weighted against the potential risks of endometrial hyperplasia and carcinoma, breast tenderness, hypertension, vascular headaches, and the inconvenience of menstrual bleeding if the uterus is intact. The risk of endometrial cancer associated with estrogen replacement therapy can be considerably reduced by the addition of a progestin, and other side effects can be diminished or eliminated by use of the new transdermal estrogen preparations. Thus, estrogen replacement therapy should be considered in all women who have experienced natural or surgically induced menopause, and it is advisable in women who have osteoporosis or an increased risk for this disorder and no contra-indications to its use. Estrogen replacement therapy should be instituted as soon after menopause as possible and seems to be well tolerated until at least 75 years of age.\r"

  ".W": "Striational autoantibodies (StrAb) are a useful serologic marker of thymoma in patients with myasthenia gravis (MG). We compared a standard immunofluorescence method with a new enzyme immunoassay (EIA) for detection of StrAb. Retrospective testing of 264 stored sera by the two methods yielded well-correlated results (58 sera were positive by both assays; r = 0.8). For 104 patients with spontaneously acquired MG or thymoma, results were 100% concordant, of which 53% were positive. For 34 recipients of D-penicillamine, StrAb were found in 15% by EIA and in 6% by immunofluorescence. StrAb were detected in two of four bone marrow recipients by EIA and in one by immunofluorescence. Prospective testing of 434 fresh sera (of which 49 were positive by the two methods) yielded discordant results in only 4. Serial EIA quantitation of StrAb in two patients with MG and thymoma proved useful in monitoring immunosuppressant therapy and in a third patient predicted recurrence of the tumor. A high prevalence of StrAb was detected by both assays in elderly patients with spontaneous MG, but StrAb were more readily quantifiable by EIA. The EIA method proved to be highly sensitive and specific for detecting StrAb in patients with thymoma with and without MG, in patients treated with D-penicillamine, and in those with graft-versus-host disease after bone marrow transplantation.\r"

This study investigates the efficacy of certain angiogenic agents to expedite the neovascularization process and to increase the viability of skin flaps. Eighty-four island skin flaps were designed on the auricles of 42 New Zealand White rabbits to achieve 90% necrosis over a 7-day period. Thirty-six flaps were treated with Endothelial Cell Growth Supplement (ECGS) or Endothelial Cell Growth Factor (ECGF) at several concentrations topically or immersed in Gelfoam. The remaining flaps were used as normal saline controls. Flap viability and peripheral neovascularization were documented by polar planimetry, angiography, and histological analysis. The flap viability of the ECGS-Gelfoam -treated flaps was 100% greater than their normal saline-Gelfoam controls (p = .021). Flap angiograms demonstrated increased vascular ingrowth among the treated flaps compared to the controls. This study suggests that angiogenic agents can expedite flap neovascularization and have the potential to increase flap viability.\r"

  ".W": "Impaired glucose tolerance often presages the development of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. We have studied insulin action and secretion in 24 Pima Indians before and after the development of impaired glucose tolerance and in 254 other subjects representing the whole spectrum of glucose tolerance, including subjects with overt non-insulin-dependent diabetes. The transition from normal to impaired glucose tolerance was associated with a decrease in glucose uptake during hyperinsulinemia, from 0.018 to 0.016 mmol per minute (from 3.3 to 2.8 mg per kilogram of fat-free body mass per minute) (P less than 0.0003). Mean plasma insulin concentrations increased during an oral glucose-tolerance test, from 1200 to 1770 pmol per liter (from 167 to 247 microU per milliliter). In 151 subjects with normal glucose tolerance, the insulin concentration measured during an oral glucose-tolerance test correlated with the plasma glucose concentration (r = 0.48, P less than or equal to 0.0001). This relation was used to predict an insulin concentration of 1550 pmol per liter (216 microU per milliliter) in subjects with impaired glucose tolerance (actual value, 1590 pmol per liter [222 microU per milliliter]; P not significant), suggesting that these subjects had normal secretion of insulin. In contrast, plasma insulin concentrations in the diabetics decreased as glucose concentrations increased (r = -0.75, P less than or equal to 0.0001), suggesting deficient secretion of insulin. This relative insulin deficiency first appears at the lower end of the second (diabetic) mode seen in population frequency distributions of plasma glucose concentrations. Our data show that impaired glucose tolerance in our study population is primarily due to impaired insulin action. In patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, by contrast, impaired insulin action and insulin secretory failure are both present.\r"

  ".W": "In fasting nondiabetic subjects, insulin is secreted in regular pulses every 12 to 15 minutes, but patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes lack regular oscillatory insulin secretion. To investigate whether abnormal insulin oscillations are an early feature of diabetes, we studied 10 minimally glucose-intolerant first-degree relatives of patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes and 10 controls matched for age and obesity. We performed a time-series analysis of fasting plasma insulin levels in blood samples obtained at 1-minute intervals for 150 minutes. Fasting plasma glucose levels were higher in the relatives than in the controls (mean +/- SD, 5.4 +/- 0.7 vs. 4.4 +/- 0.3 mmol per liter). Autocorrelation of pooled data showed no regular oscillatory activity in the relatives but a 13-minute cycle in the controls (r = 0.23, P less than 0.001). Similarly, Fourier transform analysis showed no significant peak in the relatives but the expected significant peak at 13 to 14 minutes in the controls (P less than 0.05). First-phase (0 to 10 minutes) insulin secretory responses to glucose administered intravenously were not significantly impaired in the relatives (geometric mean, 188 pmol per liter [26.2 mU per liter]; range of SD, +103 to -67 pmol per liter [+14.4 to -9.3 mU per liter]), as compared with the controls (geometric mean, 231 pmol per liter [32.2 mU per liter]; range of SD, +131 to -83 pmol per liter [+18.2 to -11.6 mU per liter]). We conclude that abnormal oscillatory insulin secretion may be an early phenomenon in the development of non-insulin-dependent diabetes.\r"

  ".W": "To determine whether non-insulin-dependent diabetes is associated with specific alterations in the pattern of insulin secretion, we studied 16 patients with untreated diabetes and 14 matched controls. The rates of insulin secretion were calculated from measurements of peripheral C-peptide in blood samples taken at 15- to 20-minute intervals during a 24-hour period in which the subjects ate three mixed meals. Incremental responses of insulin secretion to meals were significantly lower in the diabetic patients (P less than 0.005), and the increases and decreases in insulin secretion after meals were more sluggish. These disruptions in secretory response were more marked after dinner than after breakfast, and a clear secretory response to dinner often could not be identified. Both the control and diabetic subjects secreted insulin in a series of discrete pulses. In the controls, a total of seven to eight pulses were identified in the period from 9 a.m. to 11 p.m., including the three post-meal periods (an average frequency of one pulse per 105 to 120 minutes), and two to four pulses were identified in the remaining 10 hours. The number of pulses in the patients and controls did not differ significantly. However, in the patients, the pulses after meals had a smaller amplitude (P less than 0.03) and were less frequently concomitant with a glucose pulse (54.7 +/- 4.9 vs. 82.2 +/- 5.0, P less than 0.001). Pulses also appeared less regularly in the patients. During glucose clamping to produce hyperglycemia (glucose level, 16.7 mmol per liter [300 mg per deciliter]), the diabetic subjects secreted, on the average, 70 percent less insulin than matched controls (P less than 0.001). These data suggest that profound alterations in the amount and temporal organization of stimulated insulin secretion may be important in the pathophysiology of beta-cell dysfunction in diabetes.\r"

Prophylaxis against traveler's diarrhea has been associated with side effects from bismuth subsalicylate and the development of resistance to antimicrobial agents. We undertook a double-blind controlled trial in which a bovine milk immunoglobulin concentrate with high titers of antibodies against enterotoxigenic E. coli was used as prophylaxis against E. coli challenge in volunteers. Lyophilized milk immunoglobulins were prepared from the colostrum of cows immunized with several enterotoxigenic E. coli serotypes and fimbria types, E. coli heat-labile enterotoxin, and cholera toxin. As a control, an immunoglobulin concentrate with no anti-E. coli activity was prepared. Ten volunteers received buffered immunoglobulin concentrate against enterotoxigenic E. coli, and 10 received the control immunoglobulin concentrate, dissolved in water, three times a day. No side effects were observed. On the third day of immunoglobulin prophylaxis, the volunteers were given 10(9) colony-forming units of enterotoxigenic E. coli H10407 (O78:H11). This strain produces colonization factor antigen I and heat-labile and heat-stable enterotoxins. None of the 10 volunteers receiving the immunoglobulin concentrate against E. coli had diarrhea, but 9 of the 10 controls did (P less than 0.0001). All volunteers excreted E. coli H10407. We conclude from these preliminary results that milk immunoglobulin concentrate may be an effective prophylaxis against traveler's diarrhea.\r"

We analyzed the effect of matching for HLA-B and HLA-DR antigens on graft survival in patients treated with cyclosporine. The results in 9369 recipients of kidneys obtained and transplanted in the same center were compared with those in 5553 recipients of kidneys shipped from one center to another. In both patient subgroups, the association of HLA matching with graft survival was statistically significant (P less than 0.0001). Moreover, well-matched exchanged kidneys survived better than poorly matched locally transplanted kidneys. Among patients receiving their first cadaver transplant, graft survival at one year was 13 percentage points higher (P less than 0.0001) in exchanged kidneys without mismatches than in local kidneys with four mismatches. Among patients receiving their second transplant, graft survival was 21 percentage points higher (P less than 0.001). Kidney preservation for up to 48 hours did not affect graft survival significantly. Transplantation of poorly matched local kidneys preserved with a short period of cold ischemia (less than 24 hours) had significantly lower rates of success than did transplantation of well-matched exchanged kidneys with a longer period of cold ischemia (up to 48 hours) (P less than 0.0001). Our data indicate that the exchange of cadaver kidneys among transplant centers to obtain grafts with better HLA matching can improve the success rate of renal transplantation.\r"

Sporozoite vaccines are designed to prevent mosquito-induced infection; first generation recombinant or synthetic peptide vaccines have been tested in humans. Asexual erythrocytic stage vaccines, developed to prevent or reduce the severity of disease, have been tested in animals and in humans. A third strategy is to produce sexual stage vaccines that would induce antibodies which would prevent infection of mosquitoes when ingested in a bloodmeal containing sexual stage parasites. Although not directly protective, the sexual stage vaccine combined with a sporozoite or asexual stage vaccine (protective component) could prolong the useful life of the protective component by reducing transmission of resistant vaccine-induced mutants. In areas of low endemnicity, the sexual stage vaccine could reduce transmission below the critical threshold required to maintain the infected population, thereby assisting in the control or eradication of malaria. Transmission of Plasmodium falciparum, the major human malaria, can be blocked by monoclonal antibodies against three sexual stage-specific antigens. We have cloned the gene encoding the surface protein of relative molecular mass Mr 25,000 (25K; Pfs25), expressed on zygotes and ookinetes of P. falciparum. The deduced amino-acid sequence consists of a signal sequence, a hydrophobic C-terminus, and four tandem epidermal growth factor EGF-like domains.\r"

We report here that lysates of insulin secretory granules contain two distinct Ca-dependent acidic endoproteases; one (type I) cleaving exclusively on the C-terminal side of Arg 31.Arg 32 (B-chain/C-peptide junction), the other (type II) preferentially on the C-terminal side of Lys 64.Arg 65 of proinsulin (C-peptide/A-chain junction). The Ca and pH requirements of these proteinases suggested that the type-II proteinase would be active in the Golgi apparatus and the secretory granule, whereas type-I activity would be compatible only with the intragranular environment. Kinetic analyses of (pro)insulin conversion intermediates in [35S]methionine-pulsed rat islets support this supposition. Our results suggest a simple mechanism whereby different dibasic sites can be cleaved in different cellular compartments. In conjunction with the regulation of the ionic composition of such compartments and the operation of post-Golgi segregation, our results also suggest how proteolytic conversion of diverse proproteins destined for different cellular sites can occur differentially and in a regulated manner.\r"

The cardioprotective effect of nimodipine was assessed by measuring the electrocardiographic changes over the first 3 days of drug treatment. There was a mild lowering of the mean cerebral blood flow in the nimodipine-treated group over the 21-day period. Analysis of the continuous electrocardiographic traces showed no difference between the nimodipine and placebo groups in the frequency or type of abnormality detected. At 3 months, 4 of the 38 patients receiving nimodipine had died, compared with 10 of the 37 placebo-receiving patients. Of the 50 eligible patients who had a proven cerebral aneurysm, 1 patient (4%) on nimodipine died compared with 6 (24%) receiving placebo (0.01 less than P less than 0.05, chi 2 test; approximate 95% confidence interval for mortality difference, 0.4% to 39.6%). We conclude that nimodipine does not increase the cerebral blood flow or protect the heart after a subarachnoid hemorrhage. There were no side effects from nimodipine. The trend toward improved outcome should be verified in a larger series of patients.\r"

This technique utilizes a dental radiographic unit and extraoral cassettes for visualization of the needle tip in the inferior synovial space for arthrography. The radiographic visualization is combined with tactile discernment of the needle tip on the mandibular condyle. The successful application of these two methods makes fluoroscopy unnecessary. After an initial success rate of 81% (34 of 42 attempts), we have used the technique successfully in more than 100 cases. Most of the problems encountered with this technique can be attributed to initial operator inexperience. This technique is not suggested as a replacement for fluoroscopy. However, it is a convenient, economical technique that can be used in the dental surgical room by trained clinicians when arthrography is indicated to determine meniscal-condylar relationships and meniscal perforations.\r"

The median age of the patients was 27 years (range, 20 to 50 years). Twenty patients were men and three were women. All but two of the twenty three patients used intravenous drugs for a median period of 6 years (range, 5 to 18 years) and were involved in several episodes of needle sharing. Eight men were also bisexual, one man was homosexual, and one man was hemophiliac and bisexual. Eleven patients had asymptomatic infection, five had lymphadenopathy syndrome, six had AIDS-related complex, and one had acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. In all patients, HL lesions were localized on the lateral borders of the tongue. In twelve patients, the lesion was unilateral, and in eleven patients, it was bilateral. Microscopically, hyperparakeratosis and the presence of koilocytes were observed in all cases. Surface candidiasis could be detected with staining with periodic acid-Schiff in two thirds of the cases. In four cases, electron microscopy showed the presence of intracellular and extracellular hyphae of Candida albicans in the parakeratin layer associated with coccobacilli in the spaces between surface epithelial cells. The spinous layer included koilocytes, which had a clear cytoplasmic matrix, sparse organelles and tonofilaments, and dispersed chromatin. These cells were found to be infected by a herpes-type virus in all cases examined. There was no ultrastructural evidence of human papillomavirus in the nuclei of the epithelial cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Males had increased bony interorbital distances and distances between the inner canthi of the eyes, broad nasal root, broad halluces, and vertical grooving of nails but no craniosynostosis. Affected men transmitted the condition to all of their daughters but to no sons, while affected women transmitted the disorder to about half their daughters and half their sons. This pattern is compatible with X-linked dominant inheritance, but the far milder manifestation of the syndrome in males cannot be explained by simple mendelian genetics.\r"

  ".W": "The evaluation of cancer pain remains a problematic clinical problem, not only due to the subjective and multidimensional nature of pain per se, but also because of its specific characteristics. Cancer pain has an insidious onset, often involves many sites, and is frequently multicausal. Tools have been developed to quantify pain, the most commonly used being the verbal rating scale (VRS), the visual analogue scale (VAS), and the McGill Pain Questionnaire (MPO). The first 2 scales are short, easy to administer and to score, but only measure pain intensity. The VRS is assumed to be an ordinal scale although unequal differences between pain descriptors have been demonstrated; it offers a restrictive choice of words that may not represent pain experience with sufficient precision, and is not sensitive to change especially for mild pain. The VAS on the other hand, represents pain as a continuum and is sensitive to change. The MPQ has the advantage of evaluating the sensory, affective and evaluative dimensions of pain. However, it is lengthy to administer and some words are not readily understandable. In addition, the words within a given category are considered to be equidistant, the number of words in each category are unequal, and the number of categories evaluating a given dimension are not taken into account when calculating the total pain rating index. A further issue in assessing pain, other than the choice of a valid and reliable tool, is the frequency with which pain evaluations should be repeated. To date no studies have addressed this problem.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Using a within-session design, the specific effects of relaxation induction were evaluated in a group of benign chronic pain patients (n = 24), and compared to similar patients undergoing a control procedure (n = 22). The results indicated that irrespective of the focus of pain complaint, induction of relaxation over a 20 min period led to significant and sizeable reductions in both sensory and affective pain experience. The overall intensity of pain was significantly reduced. These effects were shown to be reliable and independent of onset level of sensory experience or depression. No significant changes occurred in the control group over a comparable period. The implications of these results were discussed with respect to the process by which relaxation reduces pain.\r"

During the sessions blood samples were taken in regular intervals to measure acetylsalicylate (ASA)- and salicylate (SA)-plasma levels. Analyses of variance were computed with several psychophysical parameters. Both the '12 N' and the '8 N' ratings discriminated between placebo and aspirin, however, only the ratings obtained from the stronger stimuli discriminated between two doses of aspirin. Subsequently we computed analyses of covariance with the ASA- and SA-plasma levels as covariates. Significant (negative) correlations of pain ratings and SA-plasma levels were found for the high dose of aspirin, but there were no significant correlations of ASA levels and ratings.\r"

Repeated immobilization leads to partial blunting of the behavioral and hormonal responses, with transient modifications of neurotransmitter systems in the brain. Pain reactions, as investigated by different kinds of nociceptive tests, are usually attenuated both during and immediately following acute immobilization and the analgesic effect of opiate compounds potentiated; these behavioral alterations may be attributed at least in part to activation of an endogenous opioid system. In some species, restraint may induce a reflex immobility (animal hypnosis or tonic immobility) which is also characterized by suppression of pain reactions in rabbits, probably subserved by different mechanisms. Analysis of available data suggests that pain testing in unanesthetized, restrained animals may involve alterations of the animal's reactivity to noxious stimuli.\r"

Seven patients (41%) had perforations of their hypopharynx or esophagus, including two neonates (most likely associated with intubation attempts). Two patients presented in the emergency department with a tentative diagnosis of \"epiglottitis,\" while another referred to as having \"persistent fever\" was found to have a needle embedded in the hypopharynx. Fourteen children (81%) were brought to the operating room for examination and/or drainage of the abscess under general anesthesia. One child received an elective tracheotomy, and two others remained intubated postoperatively, pending resolution of their airway compromise. X-rays of the lateral neck were confirmatory in all these cases, with an unusually high incidence of \"air/fluid levels,\" probably reflecting the corresponding large number of perforations of the hypopharynx or esophagus with subsequent communication into the retropharyngeal space.\r"

Adjustments in both food intake and energy expenditure are used to stabilize weight at the set-point level. Animal studies indicate that some forms of obesity can be regarded as instances of regulation at an elevated set point, while other forms seemingly result from a regulatory dysfunction. Possibly, a similar distinction between regulated and unregulated forms of obesity can be made in humans. Traditional weight-loss programs may be effective in treating unregulated forms. However, if obesity is the consequence of regulation at a high set point, a metabolic resistance to weight change will be encountered and weight loss will be difficult to achieve or maintain. Help for such patients will await development of safe and effective methods for altering the set point.\r"

  ".W": "Pseudomonas exotoxin (PE) is composed of structural domains I, II, and III; when interacting with mammalian cells the function of domain I is cell recognition, the function of domain II is membrane translocation, and domain III functions in ADP ribosylation. PE is secreted by Pseudomonas aeruginosa into its growth medium. The domain responsible for secretion has been examined by expressing modified PE genes in Escherichia coli under the control of a T7 promoter. Without a signal sequence, PE accumulates within the cell, but PE is secreted into the periplasm when part or all of domain I is removed. PE appears in the periplasm and medium when domain I and part of domain II are removed. Domain II alone is secreted into the periplasm, whereas domain III alone remains within the cell. Addition of an OmpA signal sequence results in secretion of mature PE into the periplasm and secretion of domains II-III into the medium. A protein composed of transforming growth factor alpha fused to the amino terminus of domains II-III is secreted into the periplasm without a signal sequence and into the medium with a signal sequence. A protein composed of domain(s) II or II-III fused to the amino terminus of alkaline phosphatase is secreted into the periplasm and the medium with or without a signal sequence. We conclude that domain II contains important information for protein secretion.\r"

Fewer polymerase II complexes were associated with the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase gene after insulin treatment, as compared with cAMP-treated cells, but they were distributed uniformly, so insulin does not block transcription at a discrete site, nor does it cause gradual, but progressive, premature termination. The phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase primary transcript was synthesized at a rate of about 2500 nucleotides per min in cAMP-treated cells and about 1000 nucleotides per min in insulin-treated cells. Thus insulin retards transcript elongation in comparison with cAMP, but this action does not account for the total effect insulin has on transcription. After insulin treatment, few, if any, nascent transcripts are associated with the first 69 nucleotides of the gene, whereas in cAMP-treated cells the opposite is true. These observations lead us to suggest that both insulin and cAMP exert their primary effects directly at the level of transcription initiation, but in opposite ways.\r"

We have used two specific probes for the detection of poly(sialic acid) in normal human kidney and Wilms tumor: a monoclonal antibody against meningococci group B capsular polysaccharide (homopolymers of alpha (2----8)-linked sialic acid units), which shows no crossreactivity with polynucleotides and denaturated DNA, and bacteriophage-induced endosialidases specifically hydrolyzing alpha (2----8)-linked poly(sialic acid) units. Additionally, for the detection of N-CAM, antibodies recognizing the polypeptide portion of the molecule and biotinylated antisense RNA transcribed from a cDNA clone for N-CAM were applied. Poly(sialic acid) was regionally detectable in human embryonic kidney but undetectable in normal adult kidney, as already reported for rat kidney. The malignant Wilms tumor, which is characterized by the presence of structural components resembling those found in embryonic kidney, reexpressed poly(sialic acid) units and showed positive immunostaining for the polypeptide portion of N-CAM. Immunoblot analysis of Wilms tumor as well as human embryonic kidney and brain with the monoclonal anti-poly(sialic acid) antibody revealed in each case the same high molecular mass broad band. In situ hybridization demonstrated the presence of mRNA for N-CAM in Wilms tumor. We conclude that poly(sialic acid), most probably present on N-CAM, is an oncodevelopmental antigen in human kidney.\r"

Baby hamster kidney cells (BHK cells) and several other cell lines were probed with a well characterized monoclonal antibody to ubiquitin. The antibody stained a complex cellular structure that we identified as the microtubule network. The anti-ubiquitin antibody bound to the microtubule network at all stages of the cell cycle, and we showed that the apparent association of ubiquitin with the microtubule network is not an artifact of crosslinking of free ubiquitin to the cell structure. Immunoblot procedures demonstrated that tubulin itself was not ubiquitinated. We propose that ubiquitin and/or ubiquitin-protein conjugates are associated with those networks as a new class of microtubule-associated protein. The targeting of ubiquitin to specific sites within the cell by its association with the microtubule network may regulate some of the functions of ubiquitin.\r"

By DNA blot hybridization analysis we show that the alkylation-sensitive E. coli mutant BS23 [Sedgwick, B. & Lindahl, T. (1982) J. Mol. Biol. 154, 169-175] is a deletion mutant lacking the entire ada-alkB operon. Despite the absence of the ada gene and its product, the cells contain detectable levels of a DNA-repair methyltransferase activity. We conclude that the methyltransferase in BS23 cells is the product of a gene other than ada. A similar activity was detected in extracts of an ada-10::Tn10 insertion mutant of E. coli AB1157. This DNA methyltransferase has a molecular mass of about 19 kDa and transfers the methyl groups from O6-methylguanine and O4-methylthymine in DNA, but not those from methyl phosphotriester lesions. This enzyme was not induced by low doses of alkylating agent and is expressed at low levels in ada+ and a number of ada- E. coli strains.\r"

To understand the cellular changes associated with transformation of hepatocytes to the malignant state, we have made several libraries of monoclonal antibodies against the hepatocellular carcinoma cell line FOCUS and have found six antibodies (AF-20, SF-25, SF-31, SF-90, XF-4, and XF-8) that recognize antigens expressed at consistently higher levels on hepatoma cells. We have studied malignant and nontransformed liver tissue from the same individual by using direct 125I-labeled antibody binding and immunoperoxidase staining techniques. For each of these antibodies, we found striking increases in antigen expression on the transformed tissues. These antigens were found to be expressed throughout the tumor and on distant metastases, with little, if any, expression on the nontransformed adjacent liver. These antibodies demonstrate that hepatic transformation may be accompanied by stereotyped and predictable antigenic changes. The uniformity of such antigenic changes suggests an association between these cell-surface alterations and the malignant transformation process.\r"

We tested the hypothesis that the molecular basis of this recognition is by means of a lectin-carbohydrate interaction. We synthesized a number of neoglycoproteins by covalently binding pyranose derivatives of various monosaccharides to bovine serum albumin (BSA). These reagents and the galactosyl-terminating glycoprotein asialofetuin were used to inhibit engraftment of intravenously transplanted marrow cells into lethally irradiated mice. In splenectomized mice, in whom engraftment occurs only in the bone marrow, galactosyl-BSA, mannosyl-BSA, and asialofetuin but not fucosyl-BSA inhibited homing of transplanted cells. Both the survival and cellular content of marrow, including hemopoietic stem cells and granulocyte-macrophage progenitors, were reduced. In nonsplenectomized mice, in whom engraftment occurs in both spleen and marrow, the reagents did not inhibit splenic homing. Both the survival and cellular content of spleen, including hemopoietic stem cells and granulocyte-macrophage progenitors, were similar to those of the control group. But even in this group, marrow homing of transplanted cells was inhibited by these reagents. We conclude that the recognition and homing of intravenously transplanted hemopoietic cells by marrow, but not by spleen, occurs by means of a recognition system with galactosyl and mannosyl specificities.\r"

Hippocampal pyramidal cells responded to the three main glutamatergic agonists, N-methyl-D-aspartate (N-Me-D-Asp), quisqualate, and kainate, whereas Purkinje cells responded only to quisqualate and kainate. Analysis of single-channel events recorded in outside-out patches from hippocampal neurons showed large conductance events (50 pS), which occurred more frequently in the presence of glycine. These events could be produced by N-Me-D-Asp and also, at low frequency, by quisqualate. On the other hand, 50-pS events were never observed in Purkinje neurons. This supports the hypothesis that N-Me-D-Asp and \"non-N-Me-D-Asp\" receptors are distinct molecular entities. Comparison of whole-cell and outside-out patch recordings from Purkinje cells revealed a clear spatial segregation of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glutamate receptors: although GABA receptors are found at high density in somatic membrane, quisqualate and kainate receptors are mostly extrasomatic. The results show that organotypic slice cultures are amenable to patch-clamp methods. They also show that, in these cultures, amino acids receptors have specific distribution patterns according to cell type and to region within a cell.\r"

  ".W": "Several lines of evidence indicate that tachykinin neuropeptides [substance P (SP), substance K (SK), and neuromedin K (NK)] play a role in regulating the inflammatory and immune responses. To test this hypothesis in a human inflammatory disease, quantitative receptor autoradiography was used to examine possible abnormalities in tachykinin binding sites in surgical specimens from patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Surgical specimens of colon were obtained from patients with ulcerative colitis (n = 4) and Crohn disease (n = 4). Normal tissue was obtained from uninvolved areas of extensive resections for carcinoma (n = 6). In all cases, specimens were obtained less than 5 min after removal to minimize influences associated with degradation artifacts and were processed for quantitative receptor autoradiography by using 125I-labeled Bolton-Hunter conjugates of NK, SK, and SP. In the normal colon a low concentration of SP receptor binding sites is expressed by submucosal arterioles and venules and a moderate concentration is expressed by the external circular muscle, whereas SK receptor binding sites are expressed in low concentrations by the external circular and longitudinal muscle. In contrast, specific NK binding sites were not observed in any area of the human colon. In colon tissue obtained from ulcerative colitis and Crohn disease patients, however, very high concentrations of SP receptor binding sites are expressed by arterioles and venules located in the submucosa, muscularis mucosa, external circular muscle, external longitudinal muscle, and serosa. In addition, very high concentrations of SP receptor binding sites are expressed within the germinal center of lymph nodules, whereas the concentrations of SP and SK binding sites expressed by the external muscle layers are not altered significantly. These results demonstrate that receptor binding sites for SP, but not SK or NK, are ectopically expressed in high concentrations (1000-2000 times normal) by cells involved in mediating inflammatory and immune responses. These data suggest that SP may be involved in the pathophysiology of inflammatory bowel disease and might provide some insight into the interaction between the nervous system and the regulation of inflammation and the immune response in human inflammatory disease.\r"

  ".W": "The influence of neurogenic versus humoral factors on mRNA levels of several secretory proteins of rat adrenal medulla was studied in vivo. Increased splanchnic nerve activity was generated (reflexly) with insulin treatment. Twenty-four hours after insulin injection, levels of mRNAs encoding neuropeptides (enkephalin and neuropeptide Y) were increased 6.5-fold, whereas those of mRNAs for the major secretory proteins (chromogranins A and B) were unchanged. Bilateral transection of the splanchnic nerves completely prevented this increase. Hypophysectomy decreased levels of chromogranin A mRNA to 32% of control, suggesting a dependence on hormones of the pituitary-adrenal axis. Treatment of hypophysectomized rats with dexamethasone restored chromogranin A mRNA to basal levels. Chromogranin B mRNA levels were not changed by either insulin treatment or hypophysectomy. These results demonstrate (i) that different classes of secretory proteins present in chromaffin granules are regulated by different mechanisms, (ii) that this regulation occurs at a pretranslational site, and (iii) that the relative concentration of secretory constituents of chromaffin granules may vary. The significance of an altered composition of secretory-granule constituents, which may be important in hypotension or stress, is discussed.\r"

The localization of [3H]bradykinin receptors to nociceptive pathways supports a role for bradykinin in pain mediation. Several bradykinin antagonists block bradykinin-induced acute vascular pain in the rat. The bradykinin antagonists also relieve bradykinin- and urate-induced hyperalgesia in the rat paw. These results indicate that bradykinin is a physiologic mediator of pain and that bradykinin antagonists have analgesic activity in both acute and chronic pain models.\r"

  ".W": "Recent evidence suggest that the N-methyl-D-aspartate (N-Me-D-Asp) channel is functionally and structurally associated with the phencyclidine (PCP) receptor, which mediates the psychotomimetic effects of PCP, sigma opioids, and dioxalanes. To investigate the relationship between N-Me-D-Asp and PCP receptors on a molecular level, we injected mRNA isolated from adult rat brain into Xenopus oocytes. In injected oocytes N-Me-D-Asp application (with glycine) evoked a partially desentizing inward current that was potentiated by glycine and blocked by D-(-)-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid (D-APV), by Zn2+ and, in a voltage-dependent manner, by Mg2+. These results show that the distinguishing features of rat brain N-Me-D-Asp channels are reproduced in this translation system. In addition, kainic acid elicited a nondesensitizing inward current at short latency, and quisqualate elicited a delayed oscillatory inward current, presumably mediated by a second-messenger system. Responses to glutamate had both short-latency and delayed components. The PCP derivative N-[1-(2-thienyl)cyclohexyl]piperidine (TCP) blocked the N-Me-D-Asp-evoked current, and its potency was comparable to its binding affinity in rat brain membranes. Onset of block required the presence of antagonist. Antagonism was stereoselective in that the active ligand dexoxadrol was a more effective blocker than its relatively inactive stereoisomer levoxadrol. adrol. Other PCP receptor ligands, (+)SKF-10,047 and MK-801, also blocked. Potencies of compounds active at N-Me-D-Asp and PCP receptors in oocytes were comparable to those obtained previously in electrophysiological and binding assays on neural tissues. These results indicate the coexpression of neuronal PCP and N-Me-D-Asp receptors in Xenopus oocytes.\r"

Preprofessional physical therapy students were divided into three groups that received videodisc, lecture-demonstration, or no instruction. Learning was assessed with written examinations and performance analyses. The results showed that interactive videodisc instruction was as valuable as lecture-demonstration in teaching a particular psychomotor skill.

This technique is based on biomechanical properties of skin (creep, stress relaxation) which allow skin to stretch beyond its inherent extensibility. Presuturing is performed under local anesthesia and consists of plicating intact skin over the area of planned excision the night prior to operation. Experimental studies in a pig model showed the decrease in force required to close a standard-sized wound to be 40.1 percent less than control (p less than 0.001). Fourteen patients who underwent wide excision of skin lesions had their wounds presutured. All but one wound could be closed primarily without undermining. Presuturing seems to be an easy and clinically useful technique in aiding the primary closure of large defects.\r"

However, the slope of midazolam's dose-response curve for sedation appeared to be steeper (i.e., a narrower therapeutic dosage range). In a comparative evaluation of their relative sedative-amnestic properties and recovery characteristics, the median effective doses of the two benzodiazepines were compared. Midazolam (0.1 mg/kg IV) was found to produce more profound sedation and amnesia than diazepam (0.2 mg/kg IV). Midazolam was associated with significantly less pain on injection and a lower incidence of postoperative venoirritation. Overall patient acceptance was higher with midazolam compared to diazepam. Finally, recovery characteristics were similar for the two benzodiazepines in our outpatient setting.\r"

After implantation, the graft surface became scarcely covered with platelets. From 1 week onward, endothelial cells originating from the anastomotic sides grew in over the graft surface, covered only about half the prostheses after 3 months of implantation, but did produce normal amounts of prostacyclin as compared to normal endothelium. Only near the anastomotic sides one to two layers of smooth-muscle-like cells developed underneath the neoendothelial lining. Perigraft tissue ingrowth into the wall of the polytetrafluoroethylene prostheses was scarce. The overall patency rate was 98 percent. It was concluded that optimalization of the healing characteristics of microvascular polytetrafluoroethylene prostheses may provide a prosthesis that is more suitable for clinical microsurgery.\r"

For smaller injuries, pedicle flaps offer ideal coverage. Larger defects can be covered by omental flaps. Coverage with a free muscle flap followed by split-thickness skin grafting offers optimal long-term coverage. Two new techniques are introduced. The wire-button technique offers stabilization, and the halo frame provides good support and protection for a new free-flap graft and may increase the success rate of flaps in patients with scalping injuries.\r"

No serious reactions were recorded with either of the contrast media. Urography with iohexol was found to give better parenchymal opacification, pelvocalyceal opacification, and overall quality. The sum of examinations with good and excellent overall quality was 97.8% with iohexol and 91.1% with metrizoate. The frequency of poor overall quality urograms was 1.6% with iohexol and 7.5% with metrizoate. The data suggest that iohexol is safer and more frequently produces urograms of better quality.\r"

In comparison, 17 of the 26 women with ectopic pregnancies (65%) had hCG levels greater than 1,000 IU/L, and none of the 26 had an intrauterine gestational sac. Endovaginal sonography demonstrated an adnexal mass and/or a gestational sac-like structure in 16 of the 17 cases (94%) in which hCG levels were above 1,000 IU/L, compared with only three of the nine (33%) with lower hCG levels (P less than .01). These findings indicate that an intrauterine gestational sac should be normally visualized with endovaginal sonography when the hCG level exceeds 1,000 IU/L, and that visualization of an extrauterine gestational sac and/or adnexal mass is significantly more likely in ectopic pregnancies when the hCG level exceeds 1,000 IU/L.\r"

With each imaging modality, the location (one of 11 anatomic segments), size, and appearance of detected uterine leiomyomas were determined and compared with surgical and histologic findings. Among the nine patients who underwent both MR and US, the sensitivity (85%) and accuracy (94%) of MR imaging for abnormal segments was significantly better than that of US (sensitivity = 69%, P = .015; accuracy = 87%, P = .043). For the ten patients who underwent both MR and hysterosalpingography, the sensitivity (91%) and accuracy (96%) of MR imaging was better than that of hysterosalpingography (sensitivity = 18%, P = .0005; accuracy = 72%, P = .0005). The specificities of the three modalities did not significantly differ (100%, 97%, and 98% for MR, US, and hysterosalpingography, respectively).

At surgery, three patients were found to have extratesticular and 20 patients intratesticular abnormalities. This distinction had been correctly made with both imaging modalities, but US did not demonstrate the intratesticular abnormality in four patients with diffuse infiltrating tumors. Neither modality allowed differentiation of benign from malignant disorders. When local tumor staging was analyzed in 11 patients, the accuracy of both modalities was disappointing (true-positive findings with MR imaging in seven patients and with US in five). At present, US remains the primary imaging modality for testicular disease. MR imaging should be employed when findings at physical examination and US are discrepant and considered when diffuse infiltrative disease is suspected.\r"

Bile culture was not helpful in the prediction of acute cholecystitis, since results were not available for a minimum of 24-48 hours after aspiration. In addition, gram-stained smears and bile cultures suffered from low sensitivity (48% and 38%, respectively); consequently, a negative test does not allow the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis to be excluded. Bile aspiration of the gallbladder thus has a limited role in the diagnosis of this condition.\r"

Complications that were observed included pancreatic transplant rejection, pancreatitis, arteriovenous occlusions, hemorrhage, abscesses, and extravasation at the pancreaticocystostomy site. Scintigraphy is a sensitive indicator of normal transplant function but is non-specific when findings are abnormal. Real-time US aids in the differentiation of acute rejection from pancreatitis and arteriovenous occlusion. CT is helpful for evaluation of postoperative complications.

The most common appearance of ICAC at computed tomography (CT) is that of a single, homogeneous low-attenuation mass. Multiple low-attenuation lesions were present in four cases. Calcification was depicted by CT in three cases. At angiography, ICAC has a variable appearance with avascular, hypovascular, and hypervascular patterns possible. Portal obstruction was seen in only one case. The most common appearance of ICAC at sonography is that of a homogeneously hyperechoic mass, either single or multiple. In only one case was ICAC hypoechoic. Plain abdominal radiography demonstrated calcification in three patients and evidence of Thorotrast (thorium dioxide) deposition in one. Upper gastrointestinal series demonstrated abnormal gastric folds in two cases, corresponding to gastric invasion by ICAC. There were no characteristic radiographic findings, but the following features may be helpful in differentiating ICAC from other primary intrahepatic tumors, particularly typical hepatocellular carcinoma: a homogeneously echogenic or high-attenuation appearance on images that reflects the uniform nature observed at pathologic examination, the presence of calcification, and the uncommon invasion of portal or hepatic veins. Conversely, the presence of satellite lesions may blur the the distinction between ICAC and metastatic liver disease.\r"

  ".U": "88204890\r", 
  ".W": "Apolipoprotein E is a plasma protein that serves as a ligand for low density lipoprotein receptors and, through its interaction with these receptors, participates in the transport of cholesterol and other lipids among various cells of the body. A mutant form of apolipoprotein E that is defective in binding to low density lipoprotein receptors is associated with familial type III hyperlipoproteinemia, a genetic disorder characterized by elevated plasma cholesterol levels and accelerated coronary artery disease. Apolipoprotein E is synthesized in various organs, including liver, brain, spleen, and kidney, and is present in high concentrations in interstitial fluid, where it appears to participate in cholesterol redistribution from cells with excess cholesterol to those requiring cholesterol. Apolipo-protein E also appears to be involved in the repair response to tissue injury; for example, markedly increased amounts of apolipoprotein E are found at sites of peripheral nerve injury and regeneration. Other functions of apolipoprotein E, unrelated to lipid transport, are becoming known, including immunoregulation and modulation of cell growth and differentiation.\r"

  ".W": "Screening for human T-lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I) antibodies was performed on sera from 39,898 blood donors at eight blood centers in geographically distinct areas of the United States. Ten donors (0.025 percent) showed evidence of HTLV-I seropositivity by enzyme immunoassays; this was confirmed by protein immunoblot and radioimmunoprecipitation. Seroprevalence rates ranged from 0 to 0.10 percent at the locations sampled, with HTLV-I antibodies found predominantly in donors from the southeastern and southwestern United States. Matched case-control interviews and laboratory studies were performed on five seropositive women and two seropositive men who participated in an identity-linked collection of sera from a subset of 33,893 donors at six of the eight blood centers. Four of the women and both men are black; one woman is Caucasian. Four of the seven seropositive individuals admitted to prior intravenous drug abuse or sexual contact with an intravenous drug user. Sexual contact with native inhabitants of an HTLV-I endemic area was the only identified risk factor for one male. The distribution of HTLV-I antibodies in this U.S. blood donor sample corroborates the previously reported epidemiology of this agent and suggests that additional donor screening measures, including the testing of donated blood for HTLV-I markers, may be necessary to prevent the spread of HTLV-I to transfusion recipients.\r"

This step may be vulnerable to attack by antibodies, chemicals, or small peptides. Dextran sulfate (molecular weight approximately 8000), which has been given to patients as an anticoagulant or antilipemic agent for more than two decades, was found to block the binding of virions to various target T lymphocytes, inhibit syncytia formation, and exert a potent inhibitory effect against HIV-1 in vitro at concentrations that may be clinically attainable in human beings. This drug also suppressed the replication of HIV-2 in vitro. These observations could have theoretical and clinical implications in the strategy to develop drugs against HIV types 1 and 2.\r"

Extremely long-lasting (minutes) Ca2+ gradients were induced in the apical dendrites of hippocampal CA1 neurons after brief (1 to 3 seconds), local application of either glutamate or N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA). These gradients reflect the continuous flux of Ca2+ into the dendrite. The sustained gradients, but not the immediate transient response to the agonists, were prevented by prior treatment with the protein kinase C inhibitor sphingosine. Expression of the long-lasting Ca2+ gradients generally required a priming or conditioning stimulus with the excitatory agonist. The findings demonstrate a coupling between NMDA receptor activation and long-lasting intracellular Ca2+ elevation that could contribute to certain use-dependent modifications of synaptic responses in hippocampal CA1 neurons.\r"

The pathways selective for form and color seem to be derived mainly from the parvocellular geniculate subdivisions, the depth- and movement-selective components from the magnocellular. At lower levels, in the retina and in the geniculate, cells in these two subdivisions differ in their color selectivity, contrast sensitivity, temporal properties, and spatial resolution. These major differences in the properties of cells at lower levels in each of the subdivisions led to the prediction that different visual functions, such as color, depth, movement, and form perception, should exhibit corresponding differences. Human perceptual experiments are remarkably consistent with these predictions. Moreover, perceptual experiments can be designed to ask which subdivisions of the system are responsible for particular visual abilities, such as figure/ground discrimination or perception of depth from perspective or relative movement--functions that might be difficult to deduce from single-cell response properties.\r"

Epstein-Barr virus-transformed lymphocytes from this patient synthesize an insulin receptor precursor that is normally glycosylated and inserted into the plasma membrane but is not cleaved to mature alpha and beta subunits. Insulin binding to these cells is severely reduced but can be increased about fivefold by gentle treatment with trypsin, accompanied by the appearance of normal alpha subunits. These results indicate that proteolysis of the proreceptor is necessary for its normal full insulin-binding sensitivity and signal-transducing activity and that a cellular protease that is more stringent in its specificity than trypsin is required to process the receptor precursor.\r"

The patient is a compound heterozygote, having inherited two different mutant alleles of the insulin receptor gene. One allele contains a missense mutation encoding the substitution of glutamic acid for lysine at position 460 in the alpha subunit of the receptor. The second allele has a nonsense mutation causing premature chain termination after amino acid 671 in the alpha subunit, thereby deleting both the transmembrane and tyrosine kinase domains of the receptor. Interestingly, the father is heterozygous for this nonsense mutation and exhibits a moderate degree of insulin resistance. This raises the possibility that mutations in the insulin receptor gene may account for the insulin resistance in some patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.\r"

To examine the possible involvement of a ubiquitous Ca2+-activated protease, calpain II, in the mitotic process, synchronized PtK1 cells were monitored by immunofluorescence for the relocation of calpain II. The plasma membrane was the predominant location of calpain II in interphase. However, as mitosis progressed, calpain II relocated to (i) an association with mitotic chromosomes, (ii) a perinuclear location in anaphase, and (iii) a mid-body location in telophase. Microinjection of calpain II near the nucleus of a PtK1 cell promoted the onset of metaphase. Injection of calpain II at late metaphase promoted a precocious disassembly of the mitotic spindle and the onset of anaphase. These data suggest that calpain II is involved in mitosis.\r"

Various techniques have been described and can be divided into two categories: excision of the intact tumor, best suited for a curative procedure when tumor characteristics can be accurately determined, and tumor destruction therapy, more generally used for palliation. The results of local excision, compared with those of radical operations, are very good when a strict selection policy is implemented and coupled with adequate patient follow-up study.\r"

In this review, the roots of current attempts at autologous and heterologous grafting of neural tissue are traced. Grafts of peripheral and central nervous tissue have been shown to be viable after implantation in a variety of locations in adult animals' brain and spinal cord, and survival data are impressive. Donor tissue is optimal when harvested from fetuses, and successful growth and differentiation of neural grafts have been demonstrated in host animals in a broad age range. A variety of morphologic, physiologic, and behavioral parameters suggest a certain degree of integration of graft tissue into the host central nervous system, although technical limitations do not yet allow definitive statements regarding the extent of functional reinnervation. Perhaps the most promising and innovative of current studies are those that utilize a combination of peripheral and central neural tissue as transplant material. There are a number of possible applications of neural transplantation to clinical neurology and neurosurgery, some of which are discussed.\r"

Using the primed constant infusion of stable and radioisotopes, we have determined glucose, glycerol, free fatty acids, and urea kinetics, as well as glucose oxidation. Measurements were performed both in the basal state and during glucose infusion (4 mg/kg body weight/min). Compared with normal volunteers, PHPT patients are intolerant of glucose because of a limited suppression of endogenous glucose turnover during glucose infusion (34% versus 96% suppression). In addition, the plasma cortisol level increased in the PHPT patients during glucose infusion. Glucose oxidation and fat kinetics in both PHPT patients and volunteers were similar, but the rate of net protein loss was significantly greater in the PHPT patients than in the volunteers (2.1 +/- 0.5 versus 1.4 +/- 0.2 gm/kg/day). Rates of VO2 in the PHPT patients and volunteers were similar, but the value in the SHPT patients was higher (120 +/- 9 versus 142 +/- 20 mumol/kg/min for PHPT and SHPT patients, respectively). The SHPT patients had significantly increased rates of glucose turnover, glucose clearance, and glycerol turnover, compared with the other two groups, as well as an increased reliance on glucose for energy. We conclude from these studies that (1) SHPT patients are catabolic and have increased rates of glucose and fat turnover; (2) PHPT patients have limited suppression of endogenous glucose turnover after glucose infusion compared with volunteers and higher rates of net protein loss; (3) fat metabolism and glucose utilization are unimpaired in PHPT patients; and (4) these alterations in metabolism and hormonal response to glucose infusion suggest that some of the symptoms seen in these patients may have a metabolic-hormonal basis.\r"

In the untreated pancreatitis group, mean arterial pressure, cardiac output, stroke volume, and stroke work values decreased (mean arterial pressure from 101 +/- 4 to 74 +/- 12 mm Hg, cardiac output from 118 +/- 7 to 56.2 +/- 1.1 ml/min/kg; stroke volume from 0.93 +/- 0.08 to 0.22 +/- 0.07 ml/beat/kg; p less than 0.05), whereas heart rate and peripheral resistance increased (heart rate from 125 +/- 7 to 185 +/- 10 beats/min, peripheral vascular resistance from 3130 +/- 410 to 4436 +/- 610 dynes/sec/cm5; p less than 0.05). Although coronary blood flow, endocardial-epicardial flow ratio, and myocardial oxygen delivery values decreased progressively in group I after induction of pancreatitis, these changes did not achieve statistical significance. All indices of cardiovascular function and coronary blood flow remained unchanged in group II. Neither dP/dt max, the maximal rate of left ventricular pressure increase, nor dP/dt at a developed pressure of 40 mm Hg (an index of myocardial contractility minimally affected by changes in preload and afterload) were depressed by bile-induced acute canine pancreatitis in either group. Our data indicate that the detrimental effects of acute pancreatitis on cardiovascular function are related solely to hypovolemia and reduced cardiac filling and not to humoral or reflex effects induced by the disease.\r"

In this study we show that after elective surgery in otherwise healthy subjects the B cell compartment is deeply affected, as documented by the appearance, 7 days after the intervention, of circulating lymphoblastoid B cells spontaneously secreting in vitro IgG and IgA antibodies. Analogous lymphoblastoid B cells have been described after in vivo immunization and represent a sensitive marker of the B cell response against the immunizing antigen. To better understand the origin of the reaction, we have analyzed the specificity of the antibodies secreted in culture supernatants. We show that the antibody response is polyclonal, since low titers of antibodies against several different bacterial antigens--such as tetanus toxoid, pneumococcal capsular polysaccharides (PCPs), and the lipopolysaccharides (LPSs) of several enteropathogenic strains of Escherichia coli--are detected. This response seems to reflect the previous immunologic experience of the single patient and to be caused by antigens released from traumatized tissues or absorbed through breaches in skin or mucous membranes.\r"

This permits studies on pure pancreatic juice to be carried out. In 11 such patients we studied the penetration of clindamycin, cefoxitin, and piperacillin into pancreatic juice. These three antibiotics all have good effect against the bacteria commonly isolated during pancreatic infections. Simultaneous blood and pancreatic juice samples were collected immediately before drug administration and at 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes and 3, 4, 5, 6, and 8 hours after administration. The concentration of clindamycin in pancreatic juice was 34% of that in serum and exceeded the minimum inhibitory concentration for most bacteria associated with pancreatic infections. In spite of adequate serum concentrations of cefoxitin and piperacillin, the concentrations in pancreatic juice were only 8% and 5%, respectively, and did not exceed the minimum inhibitory concentration for the relevant bacteria. In view of these findings, clindamycin seems to be preferable in the treatment of pancreatic infections.\r"

The prevalence of cholelithiasis in a random sample of the population of the town near our institution was used to calculate the expected frequency of gallstones. The comparison of the expected and the observed frequencies of cholelithiasis in these patients did not show any statistically significant difference between men and women. All these patients were recalled for a follow-up of the long-term effects of gastric surgery, and 66% (133/202) returned and were examined. They underwent ultrasonography of the biliary tract. Again the observed and the expected (obtained as before) frequencies of cholelithiasis were compared. A statistically significant difference was apparent in male patients. We conclude that BII gastric resection could be a predisposing factor in the formation of gallstones in men.\r"

Sixty-three patients had complete disappearance of swelling after one aspiration. Seventy-eight patients were selected for surgery on the basis of cytologic findings of malignancy in the aspirated fluid (one patient), on the basis of recurrent cyst formation after one aspiration (17 patients; in these cases the incidence of malignancy was similar to that in solid, cold nodules), and on the basis of palpable tissue after aspiration that indicated a partially cystic lesion (60 patients). Surgicopathologic findings revealed six malignant lesions; all of these nodules were more than 3 cm in diameter. In percentage, 6.6% of the partially cystic and 2.5% of the purely cystic nodules were malignant. The color of the aspirated fluid did not add to the discriminant value of the aspirate. The identification of malignant conditions in thyroid cysts was handicapped by the yield of acellular material in three of five cases of malignant disease and in more than 50% of benign lesions. However, the study suggests that aspiration biopsy of cystic thyroid nodules when used in association with the above clinical criteria is a useful technique of selecting patients for operation and, by itself, is a safe and reliable means of treating the disorder.\r"

The importance of this mechanism in normal acid homeostasis and in the inhibition of chronic endogenous acid hypersecretion is not established. In this study the classic Dragstedt model antral colonic transplant (ACT) was used to produce endogenous hypergastrinemia and acid hypersecretion. The effects of the ACT when the duodenum was retained in continuity with the stomach (gastroduodenostomy) were compared with those obtained when the duodenum was no longer in continuity with the stomach (gastrojejunostomy). The duodenum markedly suppressed gastrin release (p = 0.003) and gastric acid secretion (p = 0.005) in each of the four dogs. The dogs remained free of ulcers for 8 months after gastroduodenostomy and ACT. However, after conversion to gastrojejunostomy, large, chronic peptic ulcers developed after a mean of 3.5 months. The inhibitory effect of the duodenum on gastric release and gastric acid secretion protected the dog against ulceration for an extended period. The duodenum may be the major site of inhibitory control of acid secretion and endogenous gastrin release in dogs.\r"

A review of more than 20 publications in which a relation was sought between plasma lipid and lipoprotein concentrations and cerebrovascular atherosclerosis leads to the general conclusion that such a relation exists and that it is stronger in older than in younger individuals. A relation was found between blood lipids and/or lipoproteins and the extent and/or severity of cerebrovascular atherosclerosis in all but three of 26 reviewed studies. However, the specific nature of the relation is obscure because the various studies cannot easily be compared with one another. Interstudy variations in lipoprotein fraction analyzed, methodology for the analysis of lipids and lipoproteins, arterial segment examined, population sampled, control selection in case-control studies, statistical analytic approach taken, and methodology for the assessment of arterial disease preclude pooled analyses. There is a clear need for further evaluation of this relation using standardized and up-to-date methodologies both for analyses of lipids and lipoproteins and for assessment of cerebrovascular disease in symptom-free volunteers as well as in symptomatic patients.\r"

Thirty-nine presented with subclavian steal and 28 without. We also studied an additional group of 29 patients who had undergone surgery for subclavian steal syndrome and vertebrobasilar transient ischemic attacks. The results, in terms of both ultrasonographic and clinical criteria, demonstrate the benign nature of the subclavian steal syndrome: all neurologic signs and symptoms were of a transient character. Spontaneous remission of vertebrobasilar transient ischemic attacks occurred in approximately 50% of the initially symptomatic patients, and only 15% of the initially asymptomatic patients experienced vertebrobasilar transient ischemic attacks during follow-up. Doppler ultrasonography revealed progression during follow-up in only 17% of the subclavian stenoses, and in 13% a stenosis was no longer detectable. Still-ongoing brainstem transient ischemic attacks were reported in 24% of the operated patients. The most important factor for the lack of improvement was the occlusion of the bypass. Continuation of transient neurologic symptoms could be observed in only 14% of the patients with intact carotid-subclavian bypass. In conclusion, indications for surgical treatment of the subclavian steal syndrome should be restricted to cases in whom vertebrobasilar transient ischemic attacks occur frequently and are either debilitating or greatly frighten the patient.\r"

The decision to employ aspirin instead of placebo as the control regimen in trials testing newer antiplatelet agents emphasizes the need for an accurate estimate of the efficacy of older drugs. A meta-analysis of seven randomized control trials comparing aspirin and/or sulfinpyrazone or dipyridamole with placebo was performed. For aspirin compared with placebo, a nonsignificant reduction in stroke of 15% (odds ratio 0.85, 95% confidence interval 0.60-1.19; chi 2 = 0.78, p greater than 0.30) was found. For aspirin combined with sulfinpyrazone or dipyridamole compared with placebo, a 39% reduction in stroke was observed (odds ratio 0.61, 95% confidence interval 0.39-0.95; chi 2 = 4.22, p less than 0.05); at the same time a 350% increase in gastrointestinal hemorrhage or peptic ulcer was noted (odds ratio 3.5, 95% confidence interval 1.26-9.75; chi 2 = 4.61, p less than 0.05). A trend in reduction of strokes for men was observed (odds ratio 0.58, 95% confidence interval 0.32-1.07; chi 2 = 2.52, p less than 0.15) for any regimen containing aspirin. The significant benefit of aspirin-combination therapy on stroke must be interpreted cautiously because of a number of possible biases. It is still conceivable that aspirin alone may decrease the incidence of stroke by as much as 40%, but a sample of greater than 13,000 patients would be needed to confirm the benefit observed in our analysis.\r"

Doppler shift frequency parameters were well correlated with residual lumen diameter when the latter was at least 1 mm. Residual lumens of less than or equal to 2 mm were found to have an fmax of greater than 7.5 kHz and a carotid index of greater than 3.8. If fmax was greater than 14 kHz or the carotid index was greater than 7, the residual lumen diameter was nearly always less than or equal to 1 mm. Thus, the severity of the stenosis correlated directly with Doppler shift frequencies. The length of stenoses did not affect the correlations.\r"

Middle cerebral artery blood velocity was 38.9 +/- 17.9 cm/sec ipsilateral to an occlusion, 50.9 +/- 18.3 cm/sec contralateral to an occlusion (p less than 0.01), and 56.8 +/- 14.4 cm/sec in the controls (p less than 0.01).

  ".U": "88205537\r", 
  ".W": "In principle, cell-mediated allograft rejection can be brought about by cytotoxic T cells or by a DTH-like reaction. The first part of this article reviews the relative importance of these two mechanisms in graft rejection and concludes that the bulk of evidence points to cytotoxic T cells as being of major importance. In the discussion an operational definition of DTH is adopted--namely a mechanism that mediates bystander killing and depends on the existence of a radiation-sensitive effector mechanism. The rejection of skin and organ allografts in mammals is T cell dependent and the demonstration that such rejection can occur in heavily-irradiated T cell reconstituted animals and in the absence of demonstrable bystander effects leads to the conclusion drawn. This is not to imply that concomitant DTH reactions may not augment the rejection process nor to deny the possibility that in special circumstances DTH reactions may play an essential part. In the second part of this article, the roles in graft rejection of CD4+ and CD8+ cytotoxic T cells are considered. The classical collaborative interaction between class II-restricted CD4+ cells that play an inductive role, and class I restricted CD8+ cells that differentiate into cytotoxic effector cells, seems to be unnecessary in some allograft responses. Thus, not only can CD4+ T cells differentiate into class II-restricted cytotoxic T cells but CD8+ T cells, at least in some class I MHC-incompatible strain combinations, can develop into mature effector cells without an inductive signal from CD4+ T cells. This autonomy seems to be limited to MHC incompatibilities so that CD8+ cells alone are unable to mediate the rejection of minor-H incompatible grafts. For these latter types of grafts, CD4+ T cells can bring about graft rejection if multiple minor-H determinants are present, but for weak minor-H responses the classical collaborative scheme is necessary.\r"

  ".W": "We have investigated the impact of various immunosuppressive drugs and their combinations on the graft, on the intragraft inflammatory patterns of rejection, and on rejection-associated effects in the recipient circulation by fine-needle aspiration biopsy and an extensive computer program. The patients were randomized into three treatment groups, 32 patients each, with the following postoperative immunosuppression: (1) Aza (2.1 mg/kg/d) plus MP (3.6 mg/kg/d tapered to 0.5 mg/kg/d by day 15), (2) CsA (10 mg/kg/d tapered to 8 mg/kd/d by day 28) and, (3) CsA (as above) plus MP (3.6 mg/kg/d tapered to 0 mg/kg/d by day 9). The groups were homogeneous in regard to all tested pretransplantation parameters. Graft parenchymal cell morphology was significantly (P less than .05) deteriorated and urine output reduced in CsA-treated patients, compared to those receiving Aza + MP; concomitant administration of steroids partially (P = NS) protected against the CsA-associated effects. The first episode of inflammation occurred significantly earlier (P less than .001) in patients receiving initially only CsA, compared to those receiving Aza + MP or CsA + MP, the total duration of intragraft inflammation was longer and the clinical signs of rejection were significantly prolonged (.001 less than P less than .05). Although the influx of lymphocytes and monocytes into the graft and the peak intensity of intragraft inflammation was similar in the three groups of patients, the inflammatory patterns of rejection were distinctly different. The number of (T) lymphoblasts in CsA-treated grafts was significantly (P less than .05) lower and their appearance delayed, compared to those treated with Aza + MP and even lower and more delayed in grafts treated initially with CsA + MP. The number of (B) plasmablasts was also reduced and their appearance delayed, but the differences to conventional treatment with Aza + MP were smaller and no longer significant. On the other hand, a significant (P less than .01) early maturation of blood-borne monocytes into tissue macrophages was observed in the CsA-treated grafts in context of first rejection, which was lacking from those treated with CsA + MP or Aza + MP. In the blood, the first episodes of inflammation under CsA were associated with significant (P less than .001) thrombocytosis, which was lacking from the Aza + MP- and CsA + MP-treated patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

The technique used a precipitation step prior to the fluorescence polarization measurement. We compared serum HPLC and RIA to the FPIA procedure. The within run coefficients of variation were 7.2%, 9.5%, and 4%, respectively. Between run CVs were 8.0%, 12.2%, and 3.8%. The correlation coefficient for HPLC and both of the immunoassays was less than 70%, showing the influence of the different specificities of the techniques. Medical centers that have based patient care on the HPLC assay that measures only parent drug will have difficulty using an immunoassay that measures a combination of parent and metabolites. There was a good correlation (R2 = 0.93) between the two immunoassays indicating that those currently using the serum RIA for monitoring could, through careful correlation studies in their patient population, use the FPIA technique. The regression equation was as follows: serum FPIA = 1.27 serum RIA + 1.9. This indicates the higher bias of the FPIA measurements. The advantages of the FPIA assay are that 20 assays could be done in less than one hour. This is in contrast to the longer turnaround time of the standard Sandoz RIA procedure. The technical competence required to perform the assay is less than that needed to perform the current RIA procedure. The assay can be recommended for replacement of the serum RIA; however, a correlation of levels with clinical experience is necessary in view of the difference in values between RIA and FPIA.\r"

  ".W": "The use of CsA has evolved considerably in concept and practice since the First International Congress on this drug in 1983. CsA is now increasingly used as a component of a multiagent protocol, rather than as a single, potent agent, with adjunctive therapy selected to optimize induction or maintenance immunosuppression. Novel clinical developments include the prophylactic use of the MoAb OKT3 as an alternative to polyclonal ALG, and the coadministration of bromocriptine to inhibit prolactin-dependent immune augmentation. Other combinations with site-selective pharmacologic agents are now under investigation in vitro or in vivo to improve both the selectivity and potency of immunosuppression while reducing further the toxicity and cost of CsA. With the introduction of MoAb to CsA, rapid and specific measurement of the parent molecule will now become widely possible. Because of its simplicity and rapidity, this technique may well replace HPLC for routine monitoring, although the latter will remain indispensable in a research setting for measurement of individual metabolites. Specific measurement of the parent molecule is clearly important in heart or liver transplantation when hepatic metabolism is frequently grossly disturbed. There is less evidence that this will prove of value in renal transplantation, however, and it remains possible that by virtue of the biologic effect of certain metabolites, a more broadly crossreactive polyclonal assay is equal or superior in this setting. In this regard, the fluorescence polarization immunoassay is particularly attractive as a clinical monitoring system. It is simple, accurate, and cost-effective, and by virtue of its automation and speed, particularly adapted to outpatient monitoring. The planned introduction of new kits allowing measurement by monoclonal or polyclonal antibody in either serum or whole blood will make this a versatile system for the measurement of CsA.\r"

  ".W": "Ten CsA pharmacokinetic studies were performed on five pancreas transplant recipients to determine proper doses and dosing intervals. These cadaver pancreas transplants were performed with exocrine ductal drainage into the urinary tract through a bladder anastomosis in four cases and into the bowel in one case. Four CsA pharmacokinetic studies were performed on diabetic renal transplant recipients and an additional six studies were performed while with pancreas transplant patients taking metoclopramide in an effort to enhance absorption of CsA. Mean CsA dose was 3.7 mg/kg/dose (range 2.1 to 7.5 mg/kg/dose). All patients but one were on twice daily dosing intervals yielding an average daily dose of 7.4 mg/kg/d. Noncompartmental pharmacokinetic analyses were used. The adequacy of a 1-, 2-, or 3-exponential model was determined by breakpoint analysis of the log concentration v time curve using the F statistic. The terminal rate constant was calculated by nonlinear regression analysis. The AUC and AUMC were calculated by the trapezoidal method with exponential extrapolation and these were used to calculate the MRT and Vdss. The unknown fractional absorption, F, was used to correct the oral data. The average CsA concentration maximum (Cmax) was 528 ng/mL with an average time to maximum concentration (Tmax) of 4.7 hours, a mean residence time of 7.75 hours, with a Vdss/%F of 9.61 L/kg in the pancreas transplant recipients. Additional studies of six patients receiving metoclopramide with CsA revealed an average Cmax of 723 ng/mL, an average Tmax of 2.3 hours, an average MRT of 6.08 hours, and an average Vdss/%F of 5.7% L/kg. These results indicate that coexistent gastroparesis in diabetic recipients of either pancreatic or renal transplants may result in reduced bioavailability of CsA.\r"

Additional studies characterizing the disposition of M17 and M1 in WB and P separated at 37 degrees C following chronic CsA therapy will be needed to further understand the role of these metabolites in therapeutic drug monitoring of CsA. New analytical techniques or refinements in the present techniques will be required to identify and separate coeluting substances that are now being recognized with the present techniques.\r"

  ".W": "The absorption of CsA applied topically on normal or grafted skin was studied. When care was taken to prevent the rat from ingesting the CsA off their backs, the CsA blood levels was about 100 ng/mL or less, a suboptimal level to prevent rejection. The mean survival time of BUF grafts topically treated with 12 mg CsA/d was still significantly prolonged from 9.8 +/- 0.4 to 12.0 +/- 0.3 days. In bilateral grafting experiments where one graft was treated with CsA and one was not, the treated graft survived longer. Both grafts survived significantly longer than control animals with single grafts. These findings indicate that there is both a systemic and local immunosuppressive effect of topical CsA.\r"
