  ".W": "When the whole body is exposed to sinusoidal variations of ambient pressure (delta Pam) at very low frequencies (f), the resulting compression and expansion of alveolar gas is almost entirely achieved by gas flow through the airways (Vaw). As a consequence thoracic gas volume (TGV) may be computed from the imaginary part (Im) of the delta Pam/Vaw relationship: TGV = PB/[2 pi f X Im(delta Pam/Vaw)], where PB is barometric minus alveolar water vapor pressure. The method was tested in 35 normal subjects and compared with body plethysmography. The subjects sat in a chamber connected to a large-stroke-volume reciprocating pump that brought about pressure swings of 40 cmH2O at 0.05 Hz. delta Pam and Vaw were digitally processed by fast Fourier transform to extract the low-frequency component from the much larger respiratory flow. Total lung capacities (TLC) obtained by ambient pressure changes and by plethylsmography were highly correlated (r = 0.959, p less than 0.001) and not significantly different (6.96 +/- 1.38 l vs. 6.99 +/- 1.38). TLC obtained by ambient pressure changes were not influenced by lowering the frequency to 0.03 Hz, adding an external resistance at the mouth, or increasing abdominal gas volume. We conclude that the method is practical and in agreement with body plethysmography in normal subjects.\r"

  ".W": "The aim of this study was to develop a device capable of measuring transvascular fluid flux in blood-perfused organs. For any given blood flow through the organ (QT), transvascular flux (QF) can be considered as the fraction of QT exchange. Presumably, QF would change the background concentration of an impermeable tracer residing in the perfusate. Thus QF could be calculated from the relative changes in tracer concentration for any given QT. We have used Blue Dextran (1 g/l of blood) as the reference tracer. Because the minimum molecular weight of Blue Dextran is 2 X 10(6), we anticipated it to behave as an impermeable tracer in most organs. QF was simulated with continuous infusions of plasma, normal saline solution, and a 50% mixture of both. Changes in Blue Dextran concentration were continuously followed colorimetrically by changes in transmission of specific light at a wavelength of 632 nm. Because 632-nm light is affected by hematocrit and O2 saturation changes, two additional wavelengths were used: 815-nm, which is not affected by saturation or Blue Dextran concentration changes, was used to account for changes in hematocrit, and 887-nm specific light, which is not affected by Blue Dextran, served to correct for saturation changes. Red cells could not be used as the reference tracer because of the possibility of hematocrit changes independent of fluid flux (Fahraeus effect). The device so constructed proved capable of measuring rates of fluid infusion in the order of 0.1% of QT with a variability of 10% around the mean.\r"

A mathematical model of CO uptake from a single alveolar lung is developed and used as the basis for an estimation procedure to measure both lung volume and diffusing capacity during a rebreathing maneuver. Because this estimator-model uses the exact flow generated by the subject, errors in such factors as breath-hold times or depth of inspiration do not result. The estimator-model was tested using simulated data from uniformly and nonuniformly ventilated models and was found to be insensitive to noise and inhomogeneity, in contrast to the diffusing capacity of the lungs for CO (exhaled). The estimator-model makes greater use of the available data than traditional methods by utilizing both the slope of the alveolar plateaus for CO and the relative heights of such plateaus in a rebreathing experiment.\r"

Vital capacity (VC) increased 0.25 +/- 0.25 liters (P less than 0.01), functional residual capacity (FRC) increased 0.39 +/- 0.29 liters (P less than 0.001), and total lung capacity (TLC) increased 0.35 +/- 0.47 (P less than 0.025) in swimmers, irrespective of IM training. Residual volume (RV) did not change. Maximum inspiratory mouth pressure (PImax) measured at FRC changed -43 +/- 18 cmH2O (P less than 0.005) in swimmers undergoing IM conditioning and -29 +/- 25 (P less than 0.05) in controls. The time that 65% of prestudy PImax could be endured increased in IM trainers (P less than 0.001) and controls (P less than 0.05). All results were compared with similar IM training in normal females (age 21.1 +/- 0.8 yr) in which significant increases in PImax and endurance were observed in IM trainers only with no changes in VC, FRC, or TLC (Clanton et al., Chest 87: 62-66, 1985). We conclude that 1) swim training in mature females increases VC, TLC, and FRC with no effect on RV, and 2) swim training increases IM strength and endurance measured near FRC.\r"

  ".W": "Experiments were designed to test the hypothesis that drugs which increase adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) in the lung would prevent the pulmonary hypertension and the increase in vascular permeability caused by the infusion of the oxidant lipid peroxide, tert-butyl hydroperoxide (t-bu-OOH), in isolated rabbit lungs perfused with Krebs-Henseleit buffer. Pretreatment with indomethacin or verapamil was also studied, since these drugs block the increase in pulmonary arterial pressure caused by t-bu-OOH. Indomethacin or verapamil prevented the pulmonary hypertension but did not prevent the increase in permeability caused by t-bu-OOH. Consequently, indomethacin or verapamil treatment partially reduced the gain in lung weight caused by t-bu-OOH. In contrast, pretreatment with isoproterenol, prostaglandin E1, or a cAMP analogue not only prevented the pulmonary hypertension but also inhibited the increase in vascular permeability caused by t-bu-OOH. Consequently, these drugs completely blocked the gain in lung weight caused by t-bu-OOH. Posttreatment with aminophylline or the cAMP analogue also significantly reduced the gain in lung weight caused by t-bu-OOH. These results indicate that pharmacological therapy can reduce the pulmonary hypertension and the increase in vascular permeability caused by the infusion of a lipid hydroperoxide. Since isoproterenol, aminophylline, prostaglandin E1, and a cAMP analogue all had similar effects, the results suggest that the likely common mechanism for their protective effect is an increase in cAMP.\r"

Selenium deficiency resulted in decreased lung glutathione peroxidase activity but normal glutathione reductase activity and glutathione content. Infusion of the hydroperoxide into control lungs caused a proportional increase in tissue glutathione disulfide (GSSG) concentration and release of GSSG into the perfusate up to an infusion rate of 250 nmol of tert-butyl hydroperoxide X min-1 X 100 g body wt-1. Infusion rates greater than this resulted in continued rise of tissue GSSG concentrations but GSSG release into the perfusate plateaued. Infusion of tert-butyl hydroperoxide into selenium-deficient rat lungs resulted in much lower concentrations of tissue GSSG and GSSG release into the perfusate; however, release in the selenium-deficient rat lung was also found to be saturable at infusion rates of 450 nmol of tert-butyl hydroperoxide X min-1 X 100 g of body wt-1. Selenium deficiency in the rat decreases the rate of reduction of infused tert-butyl hydroperoxide by glutathione and may predispose the lung to free radical damage.\r"

Subjects sat in a head-out body plethysmograph, and transthoracic pressure was measured with an esophageal balloon. Changes in Reff and in Eeff with frequency were nearly the same in all subjects. Reff (in cmH2O X l-1 X s) was 2.9 +/- 0.8 at 0.2 Hz and fell sharply to minimum values (0.5-0.9) at 1-4 Hz. Eeff (in cmH2O X l-1) increased from approximately 10 at the lowest frequency to a plateau of about 15 at 1-3 Hz and decreased above 3 Hz. In the same subjects, we measured the relative magnitude and phase between the displacements of different parts of the chest wall with magnetometers during identical sinusoidal forcing. Results indicate that the chest wall expands and deflates uniformly at frequencies up to 1 Hz. Thereafter the abdomen makes relatively larger excursions, and the relative magnitude and phase of displacement at different points on the chest wall show complex changes. We conclude that the frequency dependence of Reff and Eeff below 1 Hz is not due to nonuniformities in displacement of different parts of the chest wall. The frequency dependency of Reff is consistent with an increasing contribution of rate-independent plastic dissipation to the pressure difference in phase with flow as breathing frequency decreases.\r"

It was found that pressure on the hemithorax from any surface (i.e., lateral, anterior, posterior, or superior) leads to reduced patency of the ipsilateral nostril but increased patency of the nostril on the opposite site. In the patient with Horner's syndrome, the nostril on the affected side remained blocked even on compression of the opposite hemithorax, and in the one with facial nerve palsy, the nostril on the affected side remained patent despite compression of the hemithorax on that side. The findings suggest that compression of hemithorax leads to changes in the congestion of the nasal mucosa that may be mediated through autonomic nerves.\r"

  ".W": "Many previous studies have fit lumped parameter models to respiratory input (Zin) and transfer (Ztr) impedance data. For frequency ranges higher than 4-32 Hz, a six-element model may be required in which an airway branch (with a resistance and inertance) is separated from a tissue branch (with a resistance, inertance, and compliance) by a shunt compliance. A sensitivity analysis is applied to predict the effects of frequency range on the accuracy of parameter estimates in this model obtained from Zin or Ztr data. Using a parameter set estimated from experimental data between 4 and 64 Hz in dogs, both Zin and Ztr were simulated from 4 to 200 Hz. Impedance sensitivity to each parameter was also calculated over this frequency range. The simulation predicted that for Zin a second resonance occurs near 80 Hz and that the impedance is considerably more sensitive to several of the parameters at frequencies surrounding this resonance than at any other frequencies. Also, unless data is obtained at very high frequencies (where the model is suspect), Zin data provides more accurate estimates than Ztr data. After adding random noise to the simulated Zin data, we attempted to extract the original parameters by using a nonlinear regression applied to three frequency ranges: 4-32, 4-64, and 4-110 Hz. Estimated parameters were substantially incorrect when using only 4- to 32-Hz or 4- to 64-Hz data, but nearly correct when fitting 4- to 110-Hz data. These results indicate that respiratory system parameters can be more accurately extracted from Zin than Ztr, and to make physiological inferences from parameter estimates based on Zin impedance data in dogs, the data must include frequencies surrounding the second resonance.\r"

It was observed that resistance (the real part of impedance) decreased slightly with frequency between 4 and 22 Hz then increased considerably with frequency above 22 Hz. In the current study, these impedance data were analyzed using nonlinear regression analysis incorporating several different lumped linear element models. The five-element model of Eyles and Pimmel (IEEE Trans. Biomed. Eng. 28: 313-317, 1981) could only fit data where resistance decreased with frequency. However, when the model was applied to these data the returned parameter estimates were not physiologically realistic. Over the entire frequency range, a significantly improved fit was obtained with the six-element model of DuBois et al. (J. Appl. Physiol. 8: 587-594, 1956), since it could follow the predominate frequency-dependent characteristic that was the increase in resistance. The resulting parameter estimates suggested that the shunt compliance represents alveolar gas compressibility, the central branch represents airways, and the peripheral branch represents lung and chest wall tissues. This six-element model could not fit, with the same set of parameter values, both the frequency-dependent decrease in Rrs and the frequency-dependent increase in resistance. A nine-element model recently proposed by Peslin et al. (J. Appl. Physiol. 39: 523-534, 1975) was capable of fitting both the frequency-dependent decrease and the frequency-dependent increase in resistance. However, the data only between 4 and 64 Hz was not sufficient to consistently determine unique values for all nine parameters.\r"

For all combinations of preexposure time, N2 partial pressure, as well as identity of the conditioning gas the relations between the convulsion threshold pressure (Pc) and the anesthesia N2 pressure (Pa) appear to be uniquely correlated by the equation Pa = 54.5 - 0.2(Pc - 60)1.2. The potency of N2O with respect to these habituation phenomena is between 28 and 33 times higher than that of N2, depending on the aspects compared. Evidence is presented indicating that after 14 days of habituation the animals have attained between 75 and 85% compensation for the anesthetic as well as the anticonvulsant effects of the conditioning gas. The bearing of the results on the problem of the nature of the antagonism between inert gas narcotic agents and high pressure and on the hypothesis that habituation tends toward restoration of isofluidity (or some analogous normalization process) are discussed.\r"

From a highest final protein concentration of 4 mg/ml the potential inhibitors were diluted down to 0.125 mg/ml in six steps, and each concentration was evaluated together with two final phospholipid concentrations, 6.25 and 1.25 mg/ml, of the surfactant preparation. The strongest inhibiting action was exerted by fibrinogen, followed by human serum and the 55,000-dalton serum protein; the weakest inhibitor was albumin. Bilirubin, when added in an amount of 1.73 mg/100 ml dissolved in human serum, significantly (P less than 0.001) augmented the inhibition over that exerted by human serum alone. Adsorption rate, as reflected in the mean value of surface tension 2 and 10 s after creation of a bubble, not pulsating, was seriously affected by each of the protein-containing inhibitors in concentrations exceeding 1 mg/ml. Surface tension was raised significantly when the pulsating bubble was at maximal and minimal size. The effect was dose dependent. At maximal size it showed no tendency to disappear during the 10-min recording, but at minimal bubble size the inhibition gradually diminished. We conclude that proteins present in the airways may seriously interfere with the activity of Surfactant TA.\r"

Studies were conducted with maximally dilated (papaverine) isolated hindquarters of 13 C rats and 10 ET rats perfused with Tyrode's solution containing 5% albumin. Vascular flow capacity was estimated by measuring total and regional flows at three to five different perfusion pressures. Capillary exchange capacity was estimated by measuring maximal capillary filtration coefficients and capillary diffusion capacity for 51Cr-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (51Cr-EDTA). The efficacy of the training was shown by significant increases in succinate dehydrogenase activities of the vastus intermedius muscle. Total hindquarter flow capacity was 50% higher in the ET rats. Regional flow data indicated that the higher total flow was due to increased muscle flow (85%), with the high-oxidative muscle tissue having the greatest increases (e.g., 200% increase in red gastrocnemius muscle). The maximal capillary diffusion capacity values for the ET rats were 70% greater than control values. However, the capillary filtration capacity values of the C and ET rats were not different. We conclude that the vascular transport capacity of the high-oxidative areas of extensor muscles is increased by endurance training.\r"

With histamine alone, three types of ID response (constriction, dilatation, and no change) occurred in parallel-arranged arteries. Relative frequency and magnitude of constriction were maximum in arteries of 300-400 micron ID, whereas those of dilatation were maximum in arteries of 100-200 micron ID. In veins, relatively uniform constriction occurred. Under H2-blockade, histamine caused greater constriction than that with histamine alone in arteries and veins of 300-500 micron ID. Under beta-blockade, with histamine, ID of all vessels decreased significantly below the ID sizes under the above two conditions, and no dilatation occurred. In two parallel arteries that showed opposite ID changes to histamine, flow velocity increased, but volume flow decreased in a constricted artery while it increased in a dilated one. Those data indicated that, with histamine, qualitatively and quantitatively nonuniform ID response was induced in both parallel- and series-arranged small pulmonary arteries and, in turn, produced heterogeneous flow distribution. Factors to cause the nonuniformity may be partly explained by difference in density of H2- and beta-receptors in vascular walls.\r"

Mean lung volume (VL) determined from helium dilution was 57 ml/kg and physiological dead space volume (VD) was about 3.6 ml/kg. QL, determined from acetylene uptake during rebreathing, increased in proportion to VO2 with temperature. Therefore, constant O2 content difference was maintained between pulmonary arterial and venous blood. DLCO, measured using a rebreathing technique, was 0.04 ml X kg-1 X min-1 X Torr-1 at 25 degrees C. Several cardiopulmonary characteristics in C. mydas are advantageous to diving: large tidal volume relative to functional residual capacity promotes fast exchange of the alveolar gas when the turtle surfaces for breathing: and the concomitant rise of pulmonary blood flow and O2 uptake with temperature assures efficient O2 transport regardless of wide temperature variations encountered during migrations.\r"

  ".W": "This study was undertaken to gain insight into the mechanisms responsible for the hypoferremia occurring after severe exercise. To this end, 18 athletes who were competing in a 160-km triathlon involving canoeing, cycling, and running were evaluated before the race, immediately after the finish, and thereafter at 30 min, 24 h, and 48 h. The evaluation included plasma iron, total iron-binding capacity, lactoferrin, ferritin, haptoglobin, cortisol, various enzymes, and white cell count. The cortisol, white cell count, and lactoferrin were significantly increased immediately after the race, while the plasma iron and transferrin saturation were significantly decreased. There was a 40% but nonsignificant rise in the plasma ferritin at the completion of the race, while the C-reactive protein was raised by nearly 300% at 24 h. In contrast, haptoglobin declined significantly by 24 h but was normal again 24 h later. Quantitative considerations suggested that the lactoferrin was not responsible for removing transferrin iron from circulation and hence causing the hypoferremia. Instead, it seemed more likely that the iron-related changes were occurring as part of an acute phase response initiated by muscle injury.\r"

To determine whether the edema resulted from increased microvascular pressure or from increased permeability, the airway fluid-to-plasma protein (A/P) concentration ratios were compared for both total proteins and endogenous protein fractions of known molecular radii (37-114 A) from dogs with edema produced by either veratrine, alloxan (permeability edema), or combined left atrial pressure and volume overload (hemodynamic edema). High A/P ratios (0.98 +/- 0.05) were observed after alloxan administration, whereas lower values (0.54 +/- 0.04) were observed in hemodynamic edema. A/P ratios were observed after veratrine administration that formed a continuum (0.48-0.84) between these extremes. Veratrine animals with high overall A/P ratios exhibited elevated A/P ratios for all protein fractions, whereas animals with lower overall A/P ratios exhibited A/P protein fraction ratios similar to those observed in the hemodynamic group. These data indicate that both hemodynamic and increased permeability mechanisms may play a role to varying degrees in the development of this form of NPE.\r"

Three groups of animals were studied: 10 rabbits breathed room air and were hypoxemic during pneumothorax (hypoxemic pneumothorax = HP); 10 rabbits breathed 40% O2-60% N2, which prevented arterial hypoxemia during pneumothorax (supraoxemic pneumothorax = SP); seven normal control animals were untreated during this time period (NC). Pneumothoraces in HP and SP were evacuated by negative pressure applied to the right pleural space for 2 h while animals were anesthetized and mechanically ventilated.

Six healthy male subjects exercised on separate days for 80, 40, and 20 min at 70% of maximal O2 consumption on a cycle ergometer. A control experiment without exercise was performed. O2 uptake, respiratory exchange ratio (R), and rectal temperature were monitored while the subjects rested in bed 24 h postexercise. An increase in O2 uptake lasting 12 h was observed for all exercise durations, but no increase was seen after 24 h. The magnitude of 12-h EPOC was proportional to exercise duration and equaled 14.4 +/- 1.2, 6.8 +/- 1.7, and 5.1 +/- 1.2% after 80, 40, and 20 min of exercise, respectively. On the average, 12-h EPOC equaled 15.2 +/- 2.0% of total exercise O2 consumption (EOC). There was no difference in EPOC:EOC for different exercise durations. A linear decrease with exercise duration was observed in R between 2 and 24 h postexercise. No change was observed in recovery rectal temperature. It is concluded that EPOC increases linearly with exercise duration at a work intensity of 70% of maximal O2 consumption.\r"

  ".W": "Indirect methods of measuring ventilation, such as the respiratory inductive plethysmograph (RIP), operate on the assumption that the respiratory system possesses two degrees of freedom of motion: the rib cage and abdomen. Accurate measurements have been obtained in many patients with pulmonary disease who possess additional degrees of freedom. Since calibration and validation of the RIP was carried out during quiet breathing in these patients, the amount of asynchronous or paradoxic breathing was presumably similar during the calibration and validation runs. Conversely, accuracy might be lost if following the initial calibration procedure the magnitude of chest wall distortion increased during subsequent validation runs. We calibrated the RIP during quiet breathing and examined its accuracy while subsequently breathing against resistive loads that required the generation of 20-80% of the subject's maximum inspiratory mouth pressure (Pmmax). We compared the relative accuracy of three commonly employed calibration methods: isovolume technique, least-squares technique, and single position loop-area technique. Up to 60% of Pmmax, 89% of the RIP values with the least-squares technique were within +/- 10% of simultaneous spirometric (SP) measurements and 100% were within +/- 20% of SP, compared with 63 and 91%, respectively, for the loop-area technique and 19 and 54%, respectively, for the isovolume technique. At 70 and 80% of Pmmax accuracy deteriorated. Accuracy of respiratory timing was judged in terms of fractional inspiratory time (TI/TT).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "We aimed to investigate whether newborn rats respond to acute hypoxia with a biphasic pattern as other newborn species, the characteristics of their ventilatory response to hypercapnia, and the ventilatory response to combined hypoxic and hypercapnic stimuli. First, we established that newborn unanesthetized rats (2-4 days old) exposed to 10% O2 respond as other species. Their ventilation (VE), measured by flow plethysmography, immediately increased by 30%, then dropped and remained around normoxic values within 5 min. The drop was due to a decrease in tidal volume, while frequency remained elevated. Hence, alveolar ventilation was about 10% below normoxic value. At the same time O2 consumption, measured manometrically, dropped (-23%), possibly indicating a mechanism to protect vital organs. Ten percent CO2 in O2 breathing determined a substantial increase in VE (+47%), indicating that the respiratory pump is capable of a marked sustained hyperventilation. When CO2 was added to the hypoxic mixture, VE increased by about 85%, significantly more than without the concurrent hypoxic stimulus. Thus, even during the drop in VE of the biphasic response to hypoxia, the respiratory control system can respond with excitation to a further increase in chemical drive. Analysis of the breathing patterns suggests that in the newborn rat in hypoxia the inspiratory drive is decreased but the inspiratory on-switch mechanism is stimulated, hypercapnia increases ventilation mainly through an increase in respiratory drive, and moderate asphyxia induces the most powerful ventilatory response by combining the stimulatory action of hypercapnia and hypoxia.\r"

In this series of experiments we have attempted to attenuate this increase by blockade of the autonomic nervous system. Four groups of anesthetized, tracheostomized, open-chest dogs were studied. Group 1 (n = 5) were hyperventilated for 30 min with 1) warm humid [approximately 26 degrees C, 100% relative humidity, (rh)] air followed by bilateral vagotomy, 2) warm humid air, 3) cold (-22 degrees C, 0% rh) dry air, and 4) warm humid air.

Group 2 were controls. Group 3 were given phentolamine, 0.6 mg/kg intravenously, as an alpha-blockade, and group 4 were given propranolol, 1 mg/kg, as a beta-blockade after warm dry air hyperventilation (period 2). Five minutes before the end of each 30-min period of hyperventilation, measurements of vascular pressures, cardiac output, arterial blood gases, and inspired, body, and tracheal temperatures were measured, and differently labeled radioactive microspheres were injected into the left atrium to make separate measurements of airway blood flow. After the last measurements had been made animals were killed and their lungs were excised. Blood flow to the airways and lung parenchyma was calculated.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The present study was designed to determine whether the cooling or the drying of the airway mucosa was the principal stimulus for this response. Six anesthetized dogs (group 1) were subjected to four periods of eucapnic hyperventilation for 30 min with warm humid air [100% relative humidity (rh)], cold dry air (-12 degrees C, 0% rh), warm humid air, and warm dry air (43 degrees C, 0% rh). Five minutes before the end of each period of hyperventilation, tracheal and central airway blood flow was determined using four differently labeled 15-micron diam radioactive microspheres. We studied another three dogs (group 2) in which 15- and 50-micron microspheres were injected simultaneously to determine whether there were any arteriovenous communications in the bronchovasculature greater than 15 micron diam. After the last measurements had been made, all dogs were killed, and the lungs, including the trachea, were excised and blood flow to the trachea, left lung bronchi, and parenchyma was calculated. Warm dry air hyperventilation produced a consistently greater increase in tracheobronchial blood flow (P less than 0.01) than cold dry air hyperventilation, despite the fact that there was a smaller fall (6 degrees C) in tracheal tissue temperature during warm dry air hyperventilation than during cold dry air hyperventilation (11 degrees C), suggesting that drying may be a more important stimulus than cold for increasing airway blood flow. In group 2, the 15-micron microspheres accurately reflected the distribution of airway blood flow but did not always give reliable measurements of parenchymal blood flow.\r"

The focus of this study was the acylation of membrane phospholipid in situ by erythrocytes. Activation of exogenous [9,10-3H]oleic acid to acyl thioester and transesterification of the acyl thioester into phospholipid by intact human erythrocytes incubated in vitro decreased 30% after exposure of 10 human subjects to hyperbaric hyperoxia (100% O2, 3 ATA, 3.5 h). Partial recovery of activity could be detected when additional cells were obtained from these subjects and assayed in vitro 24 h after cessation of exposure. No significant change in membrane phospholipid fatty acid composition was detected under these conditions. The reduced glutathione content of intact erythrocytes increased by 15% after hyperbaric hyperoxia and remained elevated 24 h after exposure. In isolated membranes prepared from the same cells activation of [9,10-3H]oleic acid to acyl thioester and its transesterification into phospholipid did not change after hyperoxia. Since the ability of intact cells to replace oxidized fatty acids in membrane phospholipids via deacylation and reacylation in situ may be necessary for the maintenance of membrane integrity during exposure to oxidative stress, the decrease in [9,10-3H]oleic acid incorporation by human erythrocytes detected in vitro after hyperbaric hyperoxia in vivo may reflect an early event in the pathogenesis of oxygen-induced cellular injury and may be a useful index for assessment of the tolerance of tissues to hyperoxia.\r"

Six pairs of monozygotic twins were subjected to a 1,000 kcal/day surplus for 22 days with careful experimental controls over food intake and physical activities. O2 consumption (VO2) was measured during a submaximal treadmill exercise test 165 min postprandially before and the morning after the overfeeding protocol. As expected, overfeeding induced significant increases in body weight and fat mass. No significant increase in mean exercise VO2 was observed after overfeeding. However, the interindividual variation in overfeeding-induced changes in exercise VO2 was large and not randomly distributed. When comparing intrapair variance for changes in exercise VO2 to interpair variance, a moderate to high within-pair resemblance in response, i.e., a genotype-overfeeding interaction, was observed. Changes in exercise VO2 were positively correlated with those in postexercise levels of blood catecholamines, particularly epinephrine. A negative correlation was found between changes in exercise VO2 and body fat gain. These results are consistent with the concept of a role for the sympathoadrenal system in the regulation of adaptive thermogenesis and the predisposition to store fat. Moreover, these data suggest that the sensitivity to adapt in exercise energy expenditure after overfeeding is inherited to a significant extent.\r"

Thirteen men performed intermittent bouts of treadmill running at 90% of their predetermined maximum O2 uptake until exhaustion on one occasion during a week in which all men were consuming a standard diet (115 mg Mg/1,000 kcal). Plasma and erythrocyte Mg concentrations and peripheral blood mononuclear cell Mg content were measured before and after the exercise. Complete 24-h urine collections were obtained on control days, on the day of exercise, and on the day after exercise. Exercise induced a transient but significant decrease in plasma Mg content (-6.8%; P less than 0.01); over 85% of the loss could be accounted for by a shift to the erythrocytes. Significant increases in urinary excretion of Mg were observed on the day of exercise (131.5 +/- 6.8 mg/day) compared with control days (108 +/- 6.6 mg/day), with the percent increase correlating with postexercise blood lactate concentration (r = 0.68; P less than 0.01) and oxygen consumption during recovery (r = 0.84; P less than 0.001). The data indicate that high-intensity anaerobic exercise induces intercompartmental Mg shifts in blood that return to preexercise values within 2 h and urinary losses on the day of exercise that return to base line the day after exercise. It is postulated that the exercise-induced increase in Mg excretion may depend on the intensity of the exercise, and the relative contribution of anaerobic metabolism to the total energy expended during exercise.\r"

When the animals breathed O2, the hyoid muscles either became longer or did not change length (but never shortened) during inspiration. During progressive hyperoxic hypercapnia, transient increases in geniohyoid muscle inspiratory lengthening occurred in many animals; however, at high PCO2 the geniohyoid invariably shortened during inspiration (mean 4.9% of resting length at the end of CO2 rebreathing; P less than 0.001). The PCO2 at which geniohyoid inspiratory lengthening changed to inspiratory shortening was significantly higher than the CO2 threshold for the onset of geniohyoid electrical activity (P less than 0.01). For the sternohyoid muscle, hypercapnia caused inspiratory lengthening in 13 of 17 cats and inspiratory shortening in 4 of 17 cats; on average the sternohyoid lengthened by 1.6% of resting length at the end of CO2 rebreathing (P less than 0.01). Sternohyoid lengthening occurred in spite of this muscle being electrically active. These results suggest that the relationship between hyoid muscle electrical activity and respiratory changes in length is very complex, so that the presence of hyoid muscle electrical activity does not necessarily indicate muscle shortening, and among the geniohyoid and sternohyoid muscles, the geniohyoid has a primary role as a hypopharyngeal dilator in the spontaneously breathing cat, with the sternohyoid muscle acting in an accessory capacity.\r"

Both measurements were done before and after induction of anesthesia-paralysis. After induction of anesthesia-paralysis, Vthx and FRC were consistently and significantly (P less than 0.01) reduced by 0.28 +/- 0.22 (SD) and 0.59 +/- 0.24 liter, respectively. The reduction of FRC was larger than the reduction of Vthx (delta Vthx) in six of the eight subjects, a finding suggesting that intrathoracic fluid (blood) plus trapped gas volume (Vtt) increased. Changes in Vthx were partitioned into volume changes from the thoracic rib cage (delta Vrc) and from shape and/or position changes of the diaphragm (delta Vdi). delta Vrc contributed significantly (0.17 +/- 0.15 liter, P less than 0.02) to delta Vthx, whereas delta Vdi contributed only in four of the eight subjects.

However, maximal contraction was only 16.2 +/- 2.74 g/cm (vs. 35.7 +/- 5.74 g/cm for untreated controls; P less than 0.02). The dose at which maximal contraction was elicited after atropine was 10(-7) mol ia (vs. 1.9 X 10(-9) mol for controls; P less than 0.001). Pretreatment with INDO caused minimal attenuation, and HEX had no effect on the response elicited by ia PAF. We demonstrate a method for assessing the effects of PAF in central airways that avoids tachyphylaxis and permits dose-response studies in the same animal. We also demonstrate that PAF is an extremely potent mediator that elicits tracheal smooth muscle contraction at least in part by postganglionic activation of parasympathetic nerves. A direct contractile effect of PAF which is not related to secretion of products of the cyclooxygenase pathway is also suggested.\r"

Blood flows were obtained at rest and during reactive hyperemia produced by ischemic exercise to fatigue. Vascular conductance was computed from blood flow measured by venous occlusion plethysmography, and mean arterial blood pressure was determined by auscultation of the brachial artery. Resting blood flow and mean arterial pressure were similar in both groups (combined mean, 3.0 ml X min-1 X 100 ml-1 and 88.2 mmHg). After ischemic exercise, blood flows were 29- and 19-fold higher (P less than 0.001) than rest in trained (83.3 +/- 3.8 ml X min-1 X 100 ml-1) and sedentary subjects (61.5 +/- 2.3 ml X min-1 X 100 ml-1), respectively. Blood pressure and heart rate were only slightly elevated in both groups. Maximal vascular conductance was significantly higher (P less than 0.001) in the trained compared with the sedentary subjects. The correlation coefficients for maximal oxygen uptake vs. vascular conductance were 0.81 (trained) and 0.45 (sedentary). These data suggest that physical training increases the capacity for vasodilation in active limbs and also enables the trained individual to utilize a larger fraction of maximal vascular conductance than the sedentary subject.\r"

Muscle biopsies were taken at rest and following 16, 32, 48, and 64 contractions. The ATP turnover rates during the four 16-contraction periods were 6.12, 2.56, 2.17, and 0.64 mmol X kg dry muscle-1 X s-1 contraction time. Glycolysis provided 58%, phosphocreatine 40% and a decreased ATP store 2% of the consumed energy during the initial 16 contractions. Glycolysis was responsible for 90% of the total ATP production beyond contraction 16. Absolute glycolytic ATP production decreased to 60, 55, and 17% of the amount in the initial 16 contractions during the final three periods, respectively. In conclusion glycolysis produced approximately 195 mmol ATP/kg dry muscle during the initial 48 contractions (76.8 s) and only approximately 15 mmol ATP/kg dry muscle during the final 16 contractions. Equivalent values for total ATP turnover were 278 and 16.5 mmol/kg dry muscle.\r"

Muscle biopsies were obtained at rest and following 16, 32, 48, and 64 contractions. Glycolytic intermediates and several modulators of the glycolytic enzyme phosphofructokinase (PFK) were measured. Glycogenolytic and glycolytic rates were 1.68 and 1.26 mmol glucosyl units X kg dry muscle-1 X S-1 contraction time during the initial 16 contractions and pHm decreased from 7.00 +/- 0.01 to 6.70 +/- 0.03. During the subsequent 32 contractions both glycogenolytic and glycolytic rates were maintained at approximately 0.70 mmol X kg-1 X S-1 and pHm decreased to 6.45 +/- 0.04. In the final 16 contractions, both rates were very low and pHm was unchanged. Therefore, PFK remained active despite increasing acidity until pHm decreased to approximately 6.45. We conclude that increases in the concentrations of several positive modulators partially reverses pH-dependent ATP inhibition of PFK in vivo, permitting glycolytic activity to continue in the pHm range of 6.70-6.45.\r"

Exhaustive exercise at ambient temperature (Ta) 22 degrees C induced significant increases in plasma beta-EP and beta-LPH in all subjects as did work at 60% VO2max in amenorrheic and eumenorrheic women. During work at Ta 5 degrees C, the relative increase in beta-EP and beta-LPH was suppressed in eumenorrheic women and completely prevented in amenorrheic women. Although significant lowering of beta-EP and beta-LPH was observed in men and eumenorrheic women during rest at 5 degrees C, amenorrheic women maintained precold exposure levels. These findings suggest that plasma beta-EP and beta-LPH may reflect a thermoregulatory response to heat load. There appears to be a sexual dimorphism in exercise- and cold-induced release of beta-EP and beta-LPH and amenorrhea may be accompanied by alterations in these responses.\r"

In dogs lying prone and in excised lobes, there is virtually no large-scale spatial organization of the variability. We interpret these data as evidence of an intrinsic heterogeneity of parenchymal expansion. The effect of variability of parenchymal expansion on gas mixing is calculated. From a statistical model, we infer that the variability of volume changes observed by Olson et al. is a result of an underlying variability with a larger magnitude at a smaller scale and that the variability at the smaller scale is large enough to explain the inefficiency of mixing observed in single-breath oxygen tests on excised dog lobes.\r"

The primary objective was to observe whether the normally close relationship between heart rate and log NE concentration in upset when heart rate at a given work load is increased by heat stress. Exercise, beginning at 50 W, was graded in 50-W increments lasting 10 min each up to 200 W, which lasted 5-10 min. Each subject went through the protocol twice, once with skin temperature kept low by a water-perfused suit and then with skin temperature raised to 38 degrees C. Exogenous heart stress raised log circulating NE concentration in proportion to the rise in heart rate at a given work load so that the usual relationship between these variables, previously observed during other stresses, was preserved. In contrast to some other stresses, heat stress had no added effect on E concentration, indicating that this stress during exercise raises sympathetic neural activity (as reflected in the rise in NE) without stimulating additional adrenal release of E.\r"

Accordingly, its accumulation of O2 deficit during hypoxia and its excess O2 use during normoxic recovery might be altered by extrinsic neural activity. We measured blood flow and O2 uptake in whole body (WB) and gut segments while anesthetized dogs were ventilated with 9% O2-91% N2 for 30 min followed by 30-min normoxic recovery. In six dogs extrinsic innervation to the gut segment was left intact and it was severed in another six animals. O2 deficit and excess were the accumulated differences from the normoxic O2 uptake for both gut and WB corrected for O2 stores changes. The intact gut, although only 4% body wt, incurred 22% of WB O2 deficit but contributed only 8% to WB O2 excess. The imbalance (gut excess was only 44% of gut deficit) implied that O2 using functions were curtailed during hypoxia without obligating an energy stores deficit. Denervation did not alter these quantitative relationships. Blood flow responses to transition between normoxia and hypoxia were only transiently altered. Extrinsic innervation apparently plays no major role in gut responses to WB hypoxia.\r"

Seizures were induced with bicuculline (0.2-1.2 mg/kg iv) in rats anesthetized with 70% N2O and paralyzed with curare. Briefer seizures were accompanied by increased cerebral PO2 and increased oxidation of cytochrome aa3. Lung water content and arterial O2 partial pressure (PaO2) remained normal. Longer duration seizures were also accompanied initially by increases in cerebral oxygenation. Within minutes, however, PaO2 fell from a mean of 118 to 51 mmHg, and lung water content increased from 76.2 to 83.6%. Cerebral PO2 fell but most often rose back to or above control levels, while cytochrome aa3 became markedly reduced. Simultaneously, cerebral blood flow increased more than 300% above preseizure values and O2 delivery increased more than O2 consumption. The reductive shift of cytochrome aa3 was greater than that produced by lowering PaO2 to equivalent values in seizure-free rats. The reductive shift of cytochrome aa3, despite increased O2 delivery, may be indicative of derangements in cerebral O2 diffusion or energy metabolism.\r"

Thus we hypothesized that large cyclists should have a lower O2 consumption normalized to body weight (VO2/BW) than small cyclists because of the former's lower SA/BW. We measured the VO2/BW of small (BW = 59.4 +/- 4.1 kg) and large (BW = 84.4 +/- 3.2 kg) cyclists while they bicycled on a flat road at 10, 15, and 20 mph. The large cyclists had a 22% lower VO2/BW than the small cyclists at all speeds. However, the SA/BW ratio of the large cyclists was only 11% lower than that of the small cyclists. We then photographically determined the frontal area (FA) of the cyclists in a racing posture, and found that the large cyclists had a 16% lower FA/BW ratio than the small cyclists. We conclude that large cyclists are at a distinct advantage, in terms of VO2/BW, while bicycling on level roads, and this advantage is principally due to their lower FA/BW ratio.\r"

The laser system reliably tracked the pulsating arterial diameter at a particular longitudinal site as well as at various increments in the presence of an experimentally created stenosis. The He-Ne laser measured the radial motion of canine arteries and various vascular substitutes anastomosed in an end-to-end fashion. From these novel measurements, calculations were made of arterial compliance and bending stress, two biomechanical parameters that are implicated as potential causes of anastomotic intimal hyperplasia and graft failure. Although this device is inherently limited to in vitro use, it is a potentially useful instrument for vascular physiology and biophysics.\r"

Intrapulmonary clearance of inhaled staphylococci was reduced by 67 and 74% after 96 and 168 h in hyperoxia (P less than 0.05). Impaired phagocytic killing was not due to diminished bacterial ingestion. Alveolar macrophages (AM) lavaged from pups reared in normoxia had a progressive ability to release superoxide (O-2) and showed increasing cyanide-sensitive O2 consumption during the 1st wk of life. Conversely, AM recovered from litters housed in hyperoxia for 48 h produced 190% more O-2 than normoxic controls (P less than 0.005), but this capacity to generate O-2 fell by 43% after 96 h of exposure (P less than 0.05). After 96 h of hyperoxia, AM had a significant shift toward cyanide-insensitive metabolism compared with normoxic cells (P less than 0.05). Polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) entered the alveoli after 96 h of hyperoxia, and mortality rose abruptly in animals exposed for 168 h (16%) vs. 96 h (3%). Our findings indicate neonatal hyperoxia induces metabolic and bactericidal dysfunction in the primary pulmonary phagocyte, the AM, and this injury is followed by additional lung insult during PMN migration into the airways.\r"

Histamine acid phosphate solution was nebulized into the airways of six dogs to produce predominantly peripheral airway obstruction. Vmax air, Vmax with the dogs breathing 80% He-20% O2 (delta Vmax), and airway sites of flow limitation (choke points) were examined at four lung volumes (VL), which ranged from 51 to 23% of the control vital capacity (VC). The findings were interpreted in terms of the wave-speed theory of flow limitation. At all VL, Vmax air decreased during bronchoconstriction by approximately 30% compared with the control value. Resistances peripheral to a 0.3-cm-diam airway were increased about threefold with histamine, whereas resistances between 0.6-cm-diam bronchi and main-stem bronchi increased just slightly. Airway diameters were measured in the air-dried lung at 20 cmH2O transpulmonary pressure. Our results showed that only at 44% VC did delta Vmax decrease in all experiments after histamine to indicate peripheral obstruction (mean: 68.5 to 45%). At 23% VC, delta Vmax increased slightly, from 22 to 28%. At 23 and 36% VC, substantial differences in the wave-speed variables between air and HeO2 were present before bronchoconstriction, so that delta Vmax was low in some dogs, although peripheral airway obstruction was not evident. When bronchoconstriction was produced, delta Vmax at 23% VC could not be decreased further and even increased in four of six dogs. Thus changes in delta Vmax at given lung volume may not reflect the predominant site of airflow obstruction during bronchoconstriction.\r"

Dose-response curves to 10(-10) to 10(-7) mol/kg methacholine (MCh) were generated [at functional residual capacity (FRC)] by repeated intravenous bolus administration using tantalum bronchography after each dose. Airway constriction varied substantially with dose-equivalent stimulation and varied sequentially from trachea (8.8 +/- 2.2% change in airway diam) to fifth-generation bronchus (49.8 +/- 3.0%; P less than 0.001). Length-tension curves were generated for each airway to determine the airway diameter (i.e., resting in situ smooth muscle length) at which maximal constriction was elicited using bolus intravenous injection of 10(-8) mol/kg MCh. A Frank-Starling relationship was obtained for each airway; the transpulmonary pressure at which maximal constriction was elicited increased progressively from 2.50 +/- 1.12 cmH2O for trachea (approximately FRC) to 18.3 +/- 1.05 cmH2O for fifth-generation airways (approximately 50% TLC) (P less than 0.001). A similar relationship was obtained when change in airway diameter was plotted as a function of airway radius. We demonstrate substantial heterogeneity in the lung volumes at which maximal constriction is elicited and in distribution of parasympathomimetic constriction within the first few generations of resistance bronchi. Our data also suggest that lung hyperinflation may lead to augmented airway contractile responses by shifting resting smooth muscle length toward optimum resting smooth muscle length.\r"

We studied seven normal males and found positive effort dependence of maximal expiratory flow between 50 and 80% VC in five of them, as demonstrated by standard isovolume pressure-flow (IVPF) curves. We then attempted to distinguish the effects of chest wall conformational changes from possible mechanisms intrinsic to the lungs as an explanation for positive effort dependence. IVPF curves were repeated in four of the subjects who had demonstrated positive effort dependence. Transpulmonary pressure was varied by introducing varied resistances at the mouth but effort, as defined by pleural pressure, was maintained constant. By this method, chest wall conformation at a given volume would be expected to remain the same despite changing transpulmonary pressures. When these four subjects were retested in this way, no increases in flow with increasing transpulmonary pressure were found. In further studies, voluntarily altering the chest wall pattern of emptying (as defined by respiratory inductive plethysmography) did however alter maximal expiratory flows, with transpulmonary pressure maintained constant. We conclude that maximal expiratory flow can increase with effort over a larger portion of the vital capacity than is commonly recognized, and this effort dependence may be the result of changes in central airway mechanical properties that occur in relation to changes in chest wall shape during forced expiration.\r"

  ".W": "Maximum oxygen uptake (VO2max) and body composition have been shown to deteriorate with age. How much of the decline is attributable to aging and how much is affected by reduced physical activity is not known. The purpose of this investigation was to determine the aerobic capacity and body composition of 24 master track athletes and to evaluate the relationship to age and maintenance of training over a 10-yr period. The subjects (50-82 yr of age) were retested after a 10.1-yr follow-up (T2). All continued their aerobic training, but only 11 were still highly competitive (COMP) and continued to train at the same intensity. The other 13 athletes studied became noncompetitive (post-COMP) and reduced their training intensity. The results showed the COMP group to maintain its VO2max and maximum O2 pulse while the post-COMP group showed a significant decline (54.2-53.3 vs. 52.5-45.9 ml X kg-1 X min-1; 20.7-20.8 vs. 22.4-20.0 ml/beat from test one (T1) to T2 for the COMP vs. post-COMP groups, respectively). Maximum heart rate declined 7 beats/min for both groups. Body composition showed no difference between groups from T1 to T2. For both groups body weight declined slightly (70.0-68.9 kg), percent fat increased significantly (13.1-15.1%), and fat-free weight decreased significantly (61.0-59.0 kg). Thus, when training was maintained, aerobic capacity remained unchanged over the follow-up period. Body composition changed for both groups and may have been related to aging and/or the type of training performed.\r"

  ".W": "We investigated whether ethchlorvynol (ECV)-induced acute lung injury (ALI) is associated with an increase in leukotriene C4 (LTC4) production. In six pentobarbital sodium-anesthetized dogs, ECV (15 mg/kg iv) introduced into the pulmonary circulation resulted in a 164 +/- 31% increase in extravascular lung water 120 min after ECV administration. Concomitantly, the mean (+/- SE) concentration of LTC4 in arterial plasma measured by radioimmunoassay following 80% EtOH precipitation, XAD-7 extraction and high-pressure liquid chromatography purification was 5.0 +/- 1.3 pg/ml, unchanged from control (pre-ECV) values. In contrast, in pulmonary edema fluid 120 min post-ECV, the LTC4 concentration was 35.2 +/- 10.8 pg/ml, sevenfold greater than those values found in the arterial plasma (P less than 0.01). In six additional dogs, 120 min after unilateral ALI had been induced with ECV (9 mg/kg iv), LTC4 in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) of the uninjured lung was 12.1 +/- 1.5 pg/ml, unchanged from pre-ECV values, whereas, LTC4 in the BAL of the injured lung increased from a control value of 10.2 +/- 1.6 to 24.2 +/- 3.5 pg/ml (P less than 0.01) 120 min after ECV administration. These results demonstrate that, in ECV-induced acute lung injury, LTC4 concentrations in pulmonary edema fluid are considerably greater than those found in arterial plasma in the case of bilateral acute lung injury and significantly greater in the BAL of the injured lung compared with the uninjured lung in the case of unilateral acute lung injury. The results are a necessary first step in support of the hypothesis that leukotrienes participate in the altered permeability of ECV-induced acute lung injury.\r"

  ".W": "To further examine the role that substance P plays in initiating the observed massive postmortem bronchoconstriction in guinea pig lungs and to explore the role of neural reflex in this airway spasm, six groups of animals were employed: control (n = 6), morphine (n = 6), substance P (n = 5), chronic capsaicin pretreatment + substance P (n = 5), tetrodotoxin (TTX) + acute capsaicin (n = 4), and chlorisondamine + acute capsaicin (n = 5). Pressure-volume curves were performed prior to and following the initiation of artificial pulmonary perfusion with 1% bovine serum albumin and 5% dextran in Tyrode's solution. A decrease in inflation volume (the lung volume between transpulmonary pressure of 0 and 30 cmH2O during inflation) was used as an index of bronchoconstriction. In control animals, inflation volume decreased to 20-30% of the base-line value at 15-30 min of perfusion, indicating massive bronchial constriction during this time period. Morphine (an agent inhibiting substance P release) significantly attenuated the spasm, whereas the presence of substance P in the perfusate markedly enhanced the constriction. Depletion of endogenous substance P by chronic capsaicin pretreatment did not affect exogenous substance P-induced spasm. Acute capsaicin-induced bronchoconstriction was significantly attenuated by TTX but was not affected by the ganglionic blocking agent, chlorisondamine. These data suggest that substance P initiates the massive postmortem bronchoconstriction in guinea pig lungs and that substance P is released by local stimulation of sensory nerve endings via axonal reflex.\r"

Therefore, measurements were made of total skin surface area segmented into five regions of 12 spontaneously hypertensive (SHR) and 12 normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats. SHR's were selected because chronically elevated core temperature and reduced ability of SHR's to withstand heat stress make them of interest for thermoregulatory studies. Area was determined by coating the skin with rubber base dental impression material, then measuring the area of the coating. The relationship between total skin surface area and mass of SHR's was not different from that of WKY's and is described by the equation SA = 8.62 M0.67. However, the ears of SHR's had larger surface area and their tails smaller surface area than those of WKY's. For the combined groups, the proportion of total surface area of the regions was as follows: ears, 0.022; front feet, 0.017; hind feet, 0.040; tail, 0.100; central skin, 0.826. These data provide a basis for calculating skin surface area, mean skin temperature, and related values for SHR and WKY rats.\r"

At this time, rabbits not treated with surfactant exhibit a severe lung injury with hypoxemia, increased alveolar premeability to solute, decreased total lung capacity (TLC) and lung edema. For surfactant treatment, 125 mg of calf lung surfactant extract (CLSE), suspended in 6-8 ml of normal saline, were instilled intratracheally at 0 and 12 h posthyperoxic exposure. At 24 h postexposure, these CLSE-treated rabbits compared with saline controls had significantly higher amounts of lung phospolipids (34 +/- 4 vs. 4.5 +/- 0.6 mumol/kg body wt) and increased TLC (42 +/- 2 vs. 27 +/- 1 ml/kg), with significantly lower amounts of alveolar protein (36 +/- 3 vs. 56 +/- 3 mg/kg) and decreased lung wet weight-to-dry weight ratios (5.6 +/- 0.1 vs. 6.3 +/- 0.3). Surfactant supplementation also decreased the degree of lung atelectasis as reflected by the increase in arterial O2 partial pressure (PaO2) after breathing 100% O2 for 20 min (PaO2 = 460 +/- 31 vs. 197 +/- 52 Torr). These findings indicate that instillation of exogenous surfactant mitigates the progression of hyperoxic lung injury in rabbits.\r"

  ".W": "We studied the effects of regional hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPV) on lobar flow diversion in the presence of hydrostatic pulmonary edema. Ten anesthetized dogs with the left lower lobe (LLL) suspended in a net for continuous weighing were ventilated with a bronchial divider so the LLL could be ventilated with either 100% O2 or a hypoxic gas mixture (90% N2-5% CO2-5% O2). A balloon was inflated in the left atrium until hydrostatic pulmonary edema occurred, as evidenced by a continuous increase in LLL weight. Left lower lobe flow (QLLL) was measured by electromagnetic flow meter and cardiac output (QT) by thermal dilution. At a left atrial pressure of 30 +/- 5 mmHg, ventilation of the LLL with the hypoxic gas mixture caused QLLL/QT to decrease from 17 +/- 4 to 11 +/- 3% (P less than 0.05), pulmonary arterial pressure to increase from 35 +/- 5 to 37 +/- 6 mmHg (P less than 0.05), and no significant change in rate of LLL weight gain. Gravimetric confirmation of our results was provided by experiments in four animals where the LLL was ventilated with an hypoxic gas mixture for 2 h while the right lung was ventilated with 100% O2. In these animals there was no difference in bloodless lung water between the LLL and right lower lobe. We conclude that in the presence of left atrial pressures high enough to cause hydrostatic pulmonary edema, HPV causes significant flow diversion from an hypoxic lobe but the decrease in flow does not affect edema formation.\r"

We excised, degassed, and intrabronchially filled 14 dog lung lobes from nine dogs with 75, 150, 225, or 350 ml of 5% albumin solution, and then air inflated the lobes to a constant airway pressure of 25 cmH2O. By use of micropipettes, we punctured subpleural alveoli to measure alveolar liquid pressure by the servo-null technique. Alveolar liquid pressure was constant in all lobes despite differences in lobe liquid volume and averaged 10.6 +/- 1.3 cmH2O. Thus, in all lobes a constant pressure drop of 14.4 cmH2O existed from airway to alveolar liquid across the air-liquid interface. We attribute this finding, on the basis of the Laplace equation, to an air-liquid interface of constant radius in all the lobes. In fact, we calculated from the Laplace equation an air-liquid interface radius which equalled morphological estimates of alveolar radius. We conclude that in the steady state, alveoli that contained liquid have a constant radius of curvature of the air-liquid interface possibly because they are always completely liquid filled.\r"

  ".W": "The aim of the present study was to determine in canine bronchi the effects produced by norepinephrine (released from adrenergic nerve terminals) on cholinergic neurotransmission. Electrical stimulation of canine bronchi activates cholinergic and adrenergic nerve fibers. The adrenergic neuronal blocker, bretylium tosylate, inhibited the increase in [3H]norepinephrine overflow evoked by electrical stimulation but did not prevent that caused by the indirect sympathomimetic tyramine. During blockade of the exocytotic release of norepinephrine with bretylium, the pharmacological displacement of the sympathetic neurotransmitter by tyramine significantly decreased the contractions evoked by electrical stimulation but did not affect contractions caused by exogenous acetylcholine. Metoprolol, a beta 1-adrenergic antagonist, abolished and propranolol significantly reduced the effect of tyramine during electrical stimulation. alpha 2-Adrenergic blockade, beta 2-adrenergic blockade, or removal of the epithelium did not significantly affect the response to tyramine. These results suggest that norepinephrine when released from sympathetic nerve endings can activate prejunctional inhibitory beta 1-adrenoceptors to depress cholinergic neurotransmission in the bronchial wall.\r"

  ".W": "An in vitro artificial capillary system has been developed for use in examining the O2 transport properties of free hemoglobin and erythrocytes. The artificial capillary was constructed by casting a thin film of transparent silicone rubber around a strand of tungsten wire that was 24 micron in diameter. After the rubber had polymerized, the wire was removed. Typical dimensions of the silicone rubber film were 170 micron thick, 1 cm wide, 5 mm long in the direction of flow, and a 27-micron lumen diameter. The artificial capillary bed was mounted on a microscope and perfused by either hemoglobin solutions or cell suspensions. Fractional saturation was measured as a function of axial position by a dual-wave-length microspectrophotometer, and the flow rate was regulated precisely by a syringe pump. O2 release experiments were carried out by suffusing the gas space surrounding the artificial capillary film with 100% N2 and perfusing with an oxygenated sample. O2 uptake experiments were carried out by suffusing the gas space with O2-N2 mixtures and perfusing with deoxygenated samples. The axial velocities were varied from 3 to 15 mm/s. The residence time (the time a particular red cell or hemoglobin molecule has spent in the capillary) for 50% oxygenation of a 4 mM (heme) deoxyhemoglobin solution was approximately 0.05 s at 37 degrees C when the gas space surrounding the capillary contained air. The corresponding time for 50% oxygenation of an equivalent red cell suspension was approximately 0.25 s.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "O2 transport was examined by measuring the fractional saturation of concentrated hemoglobin solutions flowing through an artificial capillary that was approximately 27 micron in diameter and embedded in a silicone rubber film approximately 170 micron thick. The effects of pH, hemoglobin concentration, O2 tension, temperature, and organic phosphate were measured and analyzed quantitatively by a rigorous mathematical model that included the geometry of the capillary in the silicone film, parabolic flow velocity distributions inside the lumen, and cooperative O2 binding by hemoglobin. The rates of both oxygenation and deoxygenation were limited by diffusion and governed by the magnitude of the O2 gradient between the intracapillary fluid phase and the external gas space. In uptake experiments, O2 flux is determined primarily by the external O2 tension (16-160 mmHg in our experiments) because the internal O2 pressure is kept small due to chemical combination with hemoglobin. In release experiments, the external O2 tension is maintained at zero, and the transport rate is determined by the intracapillary partial pressure of O2 that is proportional to the O2 half-saturation pressure of hemoglobin value of the hemoglobin sample. As a result, factors that change the affinity of hemoglobin for O2, such as pH, temperature, and organic phosphate concentration, influence strongly the rate of O2 release but have little effect on the rate of O2 uptake. These properties are physiologically advantageous, since a decrease in pH or an increase in temperature during exercise increases both the rate and extent of deoxygenation while not altering the kinetics of oxygenation.\r"

We made measurements before and during bronchoconstriction induced by vagal stimulation or inhalation of histamine or prostaglandin F2 alpha (PGF2 alpha), each of which decreased dynamic compliance by approximately 40%. With histamine and PGF2 alpha the rise in RL was predominantly due to Vtis. With vagal stimulation there was a relatively greater increase in Raw than Vtis. At higher lung volumes, Vtis increases offset falls in Raw, producing higher RL at these volumes before and during constriction with PGF2 alpha and histamine. During constriction with vagal stimulation, the fall in Raw with inflation overrode the rise in Vtis, resulting in a lower RL at the higher compared with the lower lung volume. The changes seen after a DI in the control and constricted states were due to alterations in tissue properties, both viscous and elastic. However, the relative hysteresis of the airways and parenchyma were equal, since Raw, our index of airway size, was unchanged after a DI.\r"

We considered that newborn calves made severely hypoxic might reproduce features of the human disease. When 2-day-old calves were placed at 4,300 m simulated altitude, pulmonary arterial pressure was increased and could be reversed by 100% O2. However, after 2 wk at 4,300 m, pulmonary arterial pressures were suprasystemic and there was right-to-left shunting probably through the foramen ovale and a patent but restrictive ductus arteriosus. Suprasystemic pulmonary pressure and hypoxemia persisted with 100% O2 breathing. Morphometrical examination of the lung arteries showed a markedly thickened adventitia with cellular proliferation and collagen and elastin deposition. There was increased medial thickness and distal muscularization of the pulmonary arteries associated with decreased luminal diameter. The rapid development of severe pulmonary hypertension and poor responsiveness to O2 was associated with increased arterial wall thickness, particularly involving the adventitia. Thus the pulmonary arterial circulation in these calves, which were placed at high altitude for 2 wk, exhibited features resembling persistent pulmonary hypertension in newborn infants.\r"

Coarctation was unsuspected in 23 patients, 3 of whom presented with acute aortic dissection and 4 with severe aortic valve disease. Twenty seven were hypertensive before surgery. Three patients required emergency operation and all died. There was one death and one postoperative paraplegia amongst 39 patients who underwent elective operation. Of 21 preoperatively hypertensive patients studied at least 2 years after surgery blood pressure returned to normal levels in 10. Acute aortic dissection, aortic aneurysm formation and aortic valve disease complicate the surgical treatment of adult coarctation and hypertension may persist in as many as 50% of patients. Nevertheless surgery is preferable to the poor reported results of long term medical management.\r"

  ".W": "During a 12-year-period, 33 infants 4 days to 1 year old underwent 36 operations for treatment of coarctation of the aorta. Associated cardiac anomalies were present in 27 infants (81.8%). All patients presented with congestive heart failure and underwent cardiac catheterization and aortography. Resection was performed in 11 infants, patch aortoplasty in 6, bypass in 2 and subclavian flap angioplasty in 17. Pulmonary artery banding was performed in 4 patients and ligation of a patent ductus arteriosus in 21 patients. Aortic crossclamp time was shorter in the 17 patients who had subclavian flap angioplasty than in 9 patients who had resection (P less than 0.05). Thirty-day mortality was 5 patients (13.9%); all were under 2 months of age at operation and had intracardiac anomalies. Four of them had resection and one had bypass. Mean follow-up was 5 years. Reoperation for recurrent or residual coarctation was performed in 5 patients after resection, 2 after patch aortoplasty and 2 after subclavian flap angioplasty. There was no significant difference in early postoperative arm-to-leg pressure gradients between patients who had resection and patients who had subclavian flap procedure. However, at last follow-up arm-to-leg pressure gradients were lower in 9 infants after subclavian flap (8 +/- 10.1 mmHg) than in 5 infants of similar age who had resection (34 +/- 23.9 mmHg) (P less than 0.05). Subclavian flap angioplasty is safe and more effective than resection for treatment of aortic coarctation in infants.\r"

However no one developed costochondral infection. Sternal wound infection was 6 times higher among coronary bypass patients (20%) than among patients with other types of open heart surgery (3.3%). Leg wound infection was observed in 7 (14%) patients, all minor. The prevalence of diabetics was 54% among coronary-bypass patients and 6.5% among non-coronary group. Wound infection was three times higher in diabetic--or obese patients than among non diabetic--or non obese patients. Infections were not related to age, sex, smoking habits or social class. The interval between catheterisation and operation, the preoperative stay in hospital, preoperative haemoglobin or albumin level, and the time during which the patient was on the ventilator and re-opening the chest for bleeding had no influence. A significantly higher incidence of infection in patients undergoing coronary artery surgery in addition to high prevalence of diabetic or obese patients was related to the longer duration of operation procedure and the coronary perfusion time.\r"

In all cases with bone fracture and/or dislocation bone stabilization was followed by the vascular procedure. The average time of follow-up was 76 months, 28 patients could be evaluated in the postoperative study: in 25 (89.2%) the reconstruction was patent, in 3 (10.8%) occluded. In 13 patients (46.4%) there was a complete success, 7 had a nerve deficit (25.0%), 3 had a claudication (10.7%), in one patient an amputation was necessary (3.6%) and 4 (14.3%) suffered from miscellaneous skeletal problems.

In a retrospective study all these parameters have been evaluated in 413 patients submitted to below-knee (bk, n = 196), transgenicular (tg, n = 93) and above-knee (ak, n = 124) amputation between 1971 and 1980. As compared to the ak resection, the bk amputation has the following advantages: lower operative mortality (9% vs. 30.5%), higher prosthetic fitting rate (85% vs. 66%) and significantly improved rehabilitation (walking with artificial limb: bk 84%, ak 22%). Regarding surgical mortality (8.5%) and prosthetic gait (66%), the tg amputation was nearly equivalent to the bk resection and turned out to be clearly superior to the ak amputation. As compared to the latter procedure, knee disarticulation and bk amputation had a greater risk of delayed wound healing and re-amputation at a higher level (ak: 13.5 resp. 1%, tg: 22.5 resp. 25%, bk: 35% resp. 16%). The patient with a bk amputation has the best prospect concerning a successful rehabilitation. Whenever the very important knee joint cannot be saved an ak amputation should be avoided in favour of a knee disarticulation.\r"

These lesions may become, after an otherwise well-tolerated reconstruction, the source of severe and, occasionally even permanent, complaints. In a series of 536 operations of the carotid artery, 14.4% of transient and 6% of permanent injuries to some of the distal cranial and cervical nerves occurred. The highest injury rate was observed in the hypoglossal nerve (8.6%), followed by the marginal mandibular branch of the facial nerve (6.2%) and the vagus nerve with its superior and recurrent laryngeal branches (3.7% of cases). Injury to the glossopharyngeal nerve and the greater auricular nerve occurs very rarely. A thorough knowledge of the topographic and anatomical situation combined with a cautious operation technique may lower the frequency of these lesions. That is why the essential data on the anatomy, function and the most frequent causes of injury to the individual nerves sustained during surgery within the trigonum caroticum are presented in this article.\r"

These can present when the patient regains consciousness or develop from hours to days postoperatively. Within 3 1/2 years 93 carotid artery operations were performed in 79 patients. The purpose of our presentation is to describe 5 patients who developed neurologic deficits after a successful carotid reconstructive procedure within 18 hours to 10 days postoperatively. These patients were immediately returned to the operation room and reoperated upon. In 4 of 5 cases we achieved a complete recovery. Even though our patient content is small we want to point out that in patients who develop neurological deficits postoperatively after successful surgical procedures an immediate reoperation is mandatory, and may be completely successful. In almost all patients with recurrent neurological deficits after primarily successful reconstructions we carried out control angiograms. We want to emphasize that these procedures are not obligatory since the cause for reoperation is nearly always technical and will require operative revision.\r"

Radiological signs of congestive heart failure of various degrees were present in five, abdominal bruit in four and preoperative renal failure in three patients. As preoperative diagnostic examinations i.v. pyelography was done in two patients and ultrasound scanning and angiography of the abdominal aorta in a further two patients. In one ultrasound scanning a dilated inferior vena cava and hepatic veins were seen as an indirect sign of ACF, while in both angiograms the ACF was seen. In these two cases the diagnosis of ACF was made preoperatively, while in four other cases the diagnosis was made during the operation. Three patients survived the operation and were still alive after eight months, four years and six years respectively. Postoperative complications developed in two patients: postoperative ileus in one and deep venous thrombosis and pneumonia in another. Because of its rarity aorto-caval fistula is difficult to diagnose. The presence of haematuria in a patient suffering from abdominal aortic aneurysm should strongly suggest the diagnosis of an aorto-caval fistula.\r"

We found that serum from both normal subjects and critically ill patients contained an ether-extractable factor which lowered ionized calcium concentrations and increased albumin-calcium binding. This factor was found in higher concentrations in serum from ill patients. Oleic acid and palmitic acid increased albumin-calcium binding from 2-28% in a dose-dependent manner when added in vitro to calcium-albumin solutions. Scatchard analysis demonstrated that 0.1 mM oleic acid increased the number of calcium-binding sites on the albumin molecule (from three to five sites per molecule) without altering binding affinity. A similar effect was found when we performed Scatchard analyses of ether extracts in serum from three critically ill patients (number of calcium-binding sites increased from three to six). We also found that lipid infusions (during parenteral nutrition) lowered mean serum ionized calcium values in six critically ill patients [4.6 +/- 0.2 (+/- SEM) to 4.1 +/- 0.2 mg/dL; P less than 0.05]. These data support the concept that FFAs increase calcium binding to the albumin molecule. Alterations in FFA concentrations during critical illness may contribute to the poor correlation between corrected total serum calcium and ionized calcium concentrations in critically ill patients. In addition, acute elevations in circulating FFA concentrations may contribute to hypocalcemia in patients with defects in bone calcium mobilization.\r"

  ".W": "Testosterone (T) concentrations in saliva and serum were measured in 53 women with various degrees of hirsutism and hyperandrogenism. The bioavailability of T was judged by comparing the correlations among the grade of hirsutism, salivary testosterone (SaT), and serum total and free T (fT) and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) levels. The effect of body mass index on the correlations was also studied. The high SaT concentrations [mean, 237.6 +/- 66.7 (+/- SD) pmol/L] compared to the serum fT concentrations (mean, 29.1 +/- 11.8 pmol/L) in hirsute women may reflect the bioavailability of albumin-bound T or an ability of the salivary glands to metabolize steroids. SaT was more closely related to the T/SHBG ratio (mean, 82.5 X 10(-3) +/- 54.8), reflecting the non-SHBG-bound fraction of T, than to serum fT, which might support the former theory. SaT correlated better to the degree of hirsutism (rho = 0.45; P less than 0.01) than did any of the serum T parameters or SHBG. The correlation between SaT and hirsutism was partly dependent on the effect of body mass index. After eliminating this effect, SaT still correlated with hair growth on the total body area (rho = 0.36; P less than 0.05). On the basis of the results, SaT seems to relate to the bioavailable fraction of the hormone and, thus, appears to be an optimal method for studying hirsute women.\r"

  ".W": "To determine whether women with PRL-secreting pituitary tumors have similar decreases in cortical and trabecular bone and to determine whether bone loss associated with hyperprolactinemia is reversible, we measured forearm and vertebral bone mineral in normal women and in amenorrheic women with treated and untreated hyperprolactinemia. The mean spinal bone mineral content in hyperprolactinemic women [130 +/- 23 (+/- SD) mg/mL] was 25% lower than that in normal women (167 +/- 28 mg/mL), while the mean forearm bone mineral content (0.71 +/- 0.04 g/cm2) was similar to that in normal women (0.73 +/- 0.05 g/cm2). Women with normal serum PRL levels and regular menses after transsphenoidal surgery had slightly higher mean spinal bone mineral content (149 +/- 28 mg/mL) than women who remained amenorrheic after surgery (129 +/- 19 mg/mL), but the mean value in the cured women remained significantly lower than that in normal women. In contrast, women who had undergone successful transsphenoidal pituitary surgery had mean forearm bone mineral comparable to that in normal women. There was no correlation between vertebral and radial bone mineral in hyperprolactinemic women and no correlation between bone mineral and serum PRL, serum estradiol, or duration of amenorrhea when age was taken into account. These findings suggest that hyperprolactinemia and/or decreased gonadal function in women with PRL-secreting pituitary tumors are associated with more prominent effects on trabecular bone in the spine than on cortical bone in the wrist. In addition, the abnormal spinal bone mineral content after successful treatment suggest that normalization of estradiol and PRL secretion is not sufficient to restore bone mineral content to normal, although it may be stabilized.\r"

Both fractions obtained after IGF-I-Sepharose chromatography were capable of binding [125I]IGF-I and gave a single protein band of 79,000 mol wt, when subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Coomassie blue staining), suggesting that the large mol wt species may be a dimer of identical or iso-mol wt subunits. Three minor contaminants of less than 5% each were detected upon subsequent silver staining.

The susceptibility to autoimmune thyroid disease has recently been reported to be strongly linked to certain immunogenetic factors, and increased frequency of certain HLA antigens has been found in patients with Graves' disease. This study was, therefore, undertaken to determine HLA haplotypes in Japanese men with thyrotoxic periodic paralysis (TPP). HLA typing in 35 TPP patients and 263 normal men and women demonstrated highly significant increases (P less than 0.01) in HLA-A2, Cw3, and DRw8 in the TPP patients. In comparing TPP patients with thyrotoxic men who did not have PP, the frequency of DRw8 antigen was 2.5-fold greater in patients with PP than in those without it (62.8% vs. 28.6%). The data suggest that the HLA-DRw8 gene itself may play a significant role in the susceptibility to TPP among Japanese men.\r"

Changing the diet from one with a high fat to low fat content (less than 20 g fat/day) for a further two week period resulted in a significant reduction in mean plasma cholesterol level (p less than 0.001) while the mean SHBG level increased (p less than 0.01). The increase in plasma SHBG was associated with a significant decrease in the free testosterone fraction and free testosterone concentration. No significant changes were detected in plasma samples obtained from the same men during a control period. The results from this study demonstrate that dietary lipid intake is an additional factor involved in the regulation of plasma levels of SHBG.\r"

  ".W": "Because weight-reducing diets result in loss of lean body tissue as well as fat, we sought to determine whether injections of GH might facilitate the preservation of nitrogen and accelerate the loss of body fat during dietary restriction. The dietary intake of 8 obese subjects was restricted to 24 Cal/kg ideal BW and 1 g protein/kg for 11 weeks. During weeks 3-5, 4 subjects were given a total of 10 im injections of recombinant methionyl human GH, 1 morning injection every 48 h in a dosage of 0.1 mg/kg ideal BW. The other 4 subjects were given injections of vehicle. During weeks 8-10, the subjects who had received GH previously were given vehicle and vice versa. While receiving GH injections the mean daily nitrogen deficit [0.35 +/- 2.14 (+/- SD) g/day] was significantly less than the loss during injection of vehicle (2.21 +/- 1.45 g/day; P less than 0.001). Although three of six subjects lost 190% more fat (as determined by hydrostatic weighing) while receiving GH, the difference in group mean fat loss during GH injection was not significantly greater than that during injection of vehicle (3.06 +/- 1.39 kg lost with GH vs. 2.64 +/- 1.08 kg lost with vehicle; P = NS). In parallel with the changes in nitrogen balance, GH produced a significant increase in the mean plasma somatomedin-C/insulin-like growth factor I concentration. From a mean pretreatment value of 1.06 +/- 0.28 U/mL, a maximal value of 3.20 +/- 1.60 U/mL was achieved after 12 days of GH injection (P less than 0.001). Somatomedin-C/insulin-like growth factor I concentrations did not change during injection of vehicle. During GH injection weight loss was attenuated because of fluid retention. If weight loss was determined 1 week after the end of GH administration, however, the total weight loss (3.42 +/- 1.73 kg) was not significantly different from that during the 3 weeks of vehicle administration and the following week (4.16 +/- 1.30 kg). Fasting blood glucose and serum insulin concentrations did not change during GH administration, and no glycosuria was detected in morning urine samples. Short term GH administration is effective in decreasing the loss of lean body mass in individuals ingesting restricted diets. However, fat loss was not accelerated.\r"

Plasma SM-C levels were significantly lower in the elderly men and were correlated with the total integrated GH levels and total GH peak areas, but not with basal plasma GH levels, suggesting that the GH peaks determine SM-C levels and that the decreased GH secretion in elderly men has biological significance.\r"

One possibility is excess production of nonaldosterone mineralocorticoids, such as 19-nor-deoxycorticosterone (19-Nor-DOC). To evaluate this possibility we measured urinary 19-Nor-DOC glucuronide in normal subjects (n = 14) and patients with essential hypertension (n = 10), pituitary-dependent CS (n = 8), and adrenal tumors producing CS (n = 6). The subjects were admitted to a metabolic unit where 24-h urine samples were collected while they ate an isocaloric diet (128 meq Na+ 80 meq K+/day). 19-Nor-DOC glucuronide was purified by extraction and chromatography and measured by RIA. Urinary 19-Nor-DOC glucuronide excretion was significantly higher in patients with both pituitary CS and adrenal CS compared to that in normal subjects, while the values in the two CS groups were similar. The patients with essential hypertension also had elevated urinary 19-Nor-DOC glucuronide excretion, although the values were lower than those in either CS group. These results demonstrate that a nonaldosterone mineralocorticoid, 19-Nor-DOC, is produced in excess in patients with either pituitary or adrenal CS and, thus, suggest a possible role for 19-Nor-DOC in the pathogenesis of some hypertensive disorders.\r"

For comparison aspiration was performed from normal thyroid tissue in euthyroid patients operated for solitary thyroid lesions. The average amounts of Tg aspirated were: normal 177 +/- 52 (SE) micrograms, n = 7, hyperthyroidism 82 +/- 32 micrograms (n = 8); hypothyroidism 4.6 +/- 1.9 micrograms, n = 9. The iodothyronine content of Tg was, normal, T4 3.7 +/- 0.5 mol/mol, T3 0.28 +/- 0.04 mol/mol, T4/T3 13.7 +/- 1.4; hyperthyroidism, T4 3.8 +/- 1.0, T3 0.59 +/- 0.15, T4/T3 6.8 +/- 1.1; hypothyroidism, T4 3.3 +/- 0.5, T3 0.54 +/- 0.09, T4/T3 6.8 +/- 0.7. The iodine content of Tg was 28 +/- 3.1 atoms/mol in the euthyroid subjects and 31 +/- 7.3 atoms/mol in hyperthyroid patients. Hence, both untreated hyperthyroidism and untreated hypothyroidism were characterized by Tg with a normal T4 but a relatively high T3 content. This is probably related to the prolonged hyperstimulation of functioning follicular cells present in both diseases. The relatively high T3 content of Tg could not alone explain the relatively high T3 production compared to T4 production in these two thyroid diseases.\r"

The effect of luminal chloride addition was examined in tubules perfused symmetrically with chloride-free solutions. In the absence of inhibitors, luminal chloride addition did not affect cell pH. However, after inhibition of basolateral membrane anion transport with peritubular 4-acetamido-4'-isothiocyano-(2,2')-disulfonic-stilbene (to amplify effects of apical membrane transport on cell pH), luminal chloride addition caused a small cell acidification (delta pHi = 0.02). When 1 mM formate was added to the solutions, luminal chloride addition caused a larger change in cell pH (delta pHi = 0.06) that was inhibited by (4,4')-diisothiocyano-(2,2')-disulfonic-stilbene. This stimulation of Cl/base exchange was not seen with 1 mM acetate addition.

Our data suggest that an inborn error (i.e., high Km of transketolase for thiamine pyrophosphate) predisposing to thiamine deficiency diseases similar to those reported in Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome may occur in the general population. However, for some as yet unexplained reason(s) this variant seems to occur more frequently among familial chronic alcoholic men and their male offspring without any history of alcoholism. The inheritance pattern of this enzyme variant as revealed from an Amish pedigree study may be autosomal recessive as previously suggested.\r"

Using indirect methods, we and others have proposed that dissociation may be catalyzed by interaction of albumin with the liver cell surface. This study looked for direct evidence of catalysis by comparing the rate of dissociation of oleate from albumin in vitro with the rate observed within the sinusoids of perfused rat liver. No evidence for catalysis was found. The rate of hepatic oleate removal from dilute albumin solutions did not exceed but instead closely paralleled the rate predicted from the in vitro dissociation rate constant (0.14s-1). These results suggest that under some conditions the liver can remove unbound material from the sinusoids faster than it can be replenished by dissociation from albumin, resulting in dissociation-limited removal. However, dissociation of oleate does not appear to be catalyzed by the liver.\r"

Basal and stimulated serum gastrin concentrations as well as basal and maximum acid outputs were similar in the three groups. At low doses of either exogenous pentagastrin or gastrin-17 (G17), cirrhotics with portacaval shunt secreted significantly greater amounts of gastric acid than unshunted subjects. After low doses of intragastric peptone, cirrhotics with portacaval shunt secreted significantly more acid than unshunted cirrhotics and normal subjects. At each measured serum gastrin concentration after either exogenous G17 or intragastric peptone meals, cirrhotics with portacaval shunt secreted more acid than the unshunted control groups and their dose-response curve was significantly shifted to the left. Thus, in cirrhotic patients with portacaval shunt, gastric acid secretion is abnormally sensitive to both exogenously administered or endogenously released gastrin.\r"

Reductase activity exhibited a diurnal rhythm and decreased during fasting. Enzyme activity was also modulated in vivo by alterations in dietary and plasma cholesterol, suggesting the existence of an operative cholesterol feedback regulatory system. A single, high cholesterol meal decreased reductase activity within 2 h. In addition, rapid depletion of circulating cholesterol levels by plasmapheresis led to an approximately twofold elevation in enzyme activity within 90 min of treatment. Finally, reductase activity was inhibited by dichloroacetate, a compound known to lower plasma cholesterol in man and inhibit the human leukocyte enzyme in vitro. The regulatory mechanisms controlling HMG CoA reductase activity in the human mononuclear leukocyte in vivo thus are similar to those that modulate the mammalian liver enzyme in vivo. Assessment of mononuclear leukocyte reductase activity may provide insight into the in vivo regulation of human cholesterol metabolism.\r"

Cells were incubated for 21, 65, and 140 min with [3H-methyl]dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) containing liposomes prepared from synthetic lipids. Radioactivity in cellular phosphatidylcholine (PC) declined steadily to 50% of the total trypsin-resistant cell-associated radioactivity. The proportion of radioactivity increased with time in cytidine-5'-diphosphate-choline and phosphorylcholine, which suggested reutilization of choline for PC synthesis. Cells incubated with liposomes for 2 h revealed that of the total cell-associated radioactivity, 7% was in lamellar bodies and 10% in the microsomal fraction. The lipid-associated radioactivity was 24% in \"soluble,\" 96% in lamellar bodies, and 92% in the microsomal fraction. Percent of total PC label recovered in disaturated PC of microsomal fractions decreased (slope = -5.27%/h) with time of incubation (r = 0.67). Incubation of cells with liposomes containing ([3H-methyl]choline-[14C]palmitoyl) DPPC led to altered isotope ratios in both lamellar bodies and microsomes. These observations indicate that granular pneumocytes degrade exogenous PC and resynthesize PC from degradation products.\r"

We investigated the hepatic processing of bilirubin glucuronides and their precursors, and characterized the disposition of bile pigments arising from intraversus extrahepatic sources. Tracer doses of purified radiolabeled biliverdin, bilirubin, bilirubin monoglucuronide (BMG) or diglucuronide (BDG) were administered intravenously to intact normal or jaundiced homozygous Gunn rats. Rapid sequential analysis of radiolabeled BMG and BDG in bile revealed comparable excretion patterns following biliverdin and bilirubin injection, with BDG as the major pigment. Biliary excretion of radiolabeled conjugates from injected BMG was more rapid, with BMG predominating. Excretion of injected BDG in normal rats and BMG or BDG in Gunn rats was virtually identical to that of unaltered BMG in normal rats. Model independent analysis by deconvolution provided objective comparison of the disposition of radiolabeled pigments from the different sources. These findings indicate that bilirubin glucuronides formed in the liver from endogenous (hepatic) and exogenous (extrahepatic) sources of bilirubin follow a similar excretory pathway. BMG formed endogenously is converted preferentially to BDG, whereas circulating BMG is excreted predominantly unchanged. Exogenous conjugated bilirubins are excreted more rapidly than those generated intrahepatically, by a transcellular pathway that is largely independent of the conjugation system.\r"

Training caused a similar increase in \"muscle efficiency\" in patients on prednisone (n = 9) as in normal volunteers (n = 9). In normal subjects the increase in muscle efficiency was associated with an increase in sarcoplasm, whereas in patients on prednisone the functional improvement was associated with an increase in sarcoplasm, capillaries, and mitochondria content. Thus, a therapy with low dose prednisone does not abrogate training-induced improvement of muscle efficiency but modulates the ultrastructural response of the muscle to the training.\r"

There was a two- to fourfold increase in the activity of CETP, measured in an isotopic assay in hypercholesterolemic plasma. A CETP-like molecule was isolated in increased amounts from hypercholesterolemic plasma. Incubated plasma from four dysbetalipoproteinemic subjects also showed an increase (threefold) in cholesteryl ester mass transfer, compared with normolipidemic controls. There was a twofold increase in the activity of CETP, assayed in whole or lipoprotein-free plasma. Thus, there is increased transfer of cholesteryl esters from HDL to potentially atherogenic apoB-containing lipoproteins in dyslipidemic rabbit and human plasma. The enhanced transfer results in part from increased activity of CETP, possibly reflecting an increase in CETP mass.\r"

Mere incubation primed neutrophils to double their binding of fMet-Leu-Phe. This spontaneous increase of peptide binding was unaffected by changes in the extracellular calcium concentration. However, depression of the [Ca2+]i totally abolished the increased binding of fMet-Leu-Phe. Scatchard-Plot analysis revealed that the observed increase of peptide binding was due to an increased number of receptors. Normalization of the [Ca2+]i in cells where it was initially depressed resulted in a slow but progressive increase in fMet-Leu-Phe binding. The rate of receptor recruitment could be enhanced by rapidly increasing the [Ca2+]i by addition of ionomycin. Addition of PMA to cells with near maximal receptor expression led to a marked reduction of fMet-Leu-Phe binding without affecting [Ca2+]i. These observations suggest the existence of a dual regulatory mechanism for up- and down-regulation of fMet-Leu-Phe receptors on the cell surface of human neutrophils.\r"

The strongest idiotypic crossreactivity was seen between identical twins in studies using four anti-ID raised against the anti-TT idiotypes of two sets of twins.

Replacement of Na+ by K+ or Li+ did not alter uptake, whereas replacement of Cl- by HCO-3 or gluconate- reduced uptake by approximately 40%. Substitution of Cl- by the more permeant NO-3 enhanced initial BSP uptake by 30%. Efflux of [35S]BSP from cells to media was inhibited by 40% after ATP depletion or sucrose substitution. To confirm these results in a more physiologic system, transport of [3H]bilirubin was studied in isolated livers perfused with control medium or medium in which Cl- was replaced by gluconate-. Perfusion data analyzed by the model of Goresky, revealed 40-50% reductions in influx and efflux with gluconate- substitution. These results are consistent with existence of a Cl-/organic anion-exchange mechanism similar to that described by others in renal tubules.\r"

In this study, we have determined the stoichiometry of the Na+-HCO3- cotransport system in basolateral membrane vesicles that were isolated from rabbit renal cortex by Percoll gradient centrifugation. When the membrane potential is approximated by the Nernst potential for K+, as in the presence of the K+ ionophore valinomycin, equilibrium thermodynamics predicts that the Na+-HCO3- cotransport system should come to equilibrium and mediate no net flux when (Na)i/(Na)o = [(HCO3)o/(HCO3)i]n[(K)o/(K)i]n-1, where n is the HCO3-:Na+ stoichiometry. Our experimental approach was to impose transmembrane Na+, HCO3-, and K+ gradients of varying magnitude and direction, and then to measure the net flux of Na+ over the subsequent 3-s period. In this way, we could determine the conditions for equilibrium of the transport system and thereby calculate n. The results of these experiments indicate that the value of n is greater than 2.6 and less than 3.5, consistent with a stoichiometry of 3 HCO3-:1 Na+, or a thermodynamically equivalent process. Based on reported intracellular potentials and ion activities, this value for the stoichiometry indicates that the inside-negative membrane potential is sufficient to drive HCO3- exit against the inward concentration gradients of HCO3- and Na+ that are present across the basolateral membrane of the intact proximal tubule cell under physiologic conditions.\r"

Amastigote forms of Leishmania donovani were found within bone marrow macrophages and within occasional neutrophil and eosinophil granulocytes. Electron microscopy showed the presence of many abnormal cells, which probably represented immature erythroblasts with giant lysosomes. These cells were often large, usually contained immature nuclei with relatively little condensed chromatin, had 1-20 electron dense cytoplasmic granules with an average diameter of 0.5 micron, and regularly displayed substantial rhopheocytotic activity. A few abnormal cells and intermediate and late erythroblasts appeared to have been phagocytosed by macrophages.

Prior mixing of the conjugate and antigen improved the stability of these reagents as well as removing an incubation stage from the assay. The incubation time of less than four hours permits a rapid throughput of specimens. Using the assay, a total of 163 sera were examined in a three centre study and good agreement was found. Results were expressed as arbitrary enzyme immunoassay units (EIUs) against a freeze dried standard. Throughout the study the standard serum showed a coefficient of variation less than 10% across the microtitre plate. By measuring IgM titres in patients having toxoplasmic lymphadenopathy with a known date of onset, IgM class antibodies were shown to peak at two months, persisting for about six months. In addition, a case of laboratory acquired toxoplasmosis was monitored. Sera shown to contain rheumatoid factor and antinuclear factor did not give false positive results.

In the diabetic group MgUF varied inversely with fasting plasma glucose (r = -0.269, p less than 0.05). In 14 patients with significant hypomagnesaemia, fasting plasma glucose concentration was higher (p less than 0.01) and the diabetes was of shorter duration (p less than 0.05) than in 46 patients with an MgUF in the control range. The fasting urinary magnesium creatinine ratio was greater in the diabetic patients (p less than 0.05). Patients with retinopathy did not have lower plasma magnesium values than those without retinopathy.\r"

Some 49% of the nurses' and 37% of the doctors' results differed from laboratory values by more than 0.2 mmol/l. Potassium test strip results proved acceptably comparable and reproducible when produced by an experienced analyst, but greater variability in clinical hands rendered the system unsuitable for precise monitoring of potassium concentration.\r"

  ".W": "In a prospective study the predictive value of a multivariate morphometric prognostic index was evaluated in 195 patients with primary breast cancer who had not been treated with any form of chemotherapy or hormonal treatment. The presence or absence of distant tumour recurrence combined with the scores of the prognostic index were compared with the survival curves predicted in a previous study. The value of the presence of lymph node metastases, number of positive nodes, tumour size, mitotic activity index, and oestrogen receptor status in prediction of prognosis were also investigated. In agreement with the results of the previous retrospective study, the prospective use of the index had the strongest predictive prognostic value, followed by the mitotic activity index. Statistical analysis showed that the actual prognoses of 43 of the 195 patients (22%) were more accurately determined by the prognostic index rather than by using the presence of the lymph node metastases as the classifying variable. The prognostic index is consistently reproducible by different technicians; it is a reliable method of predicting distant recurrence of tumour and hence the prognosis of patients with primary breast carcinoma. It provides more prognostic information than the presence of lymph node metastases alone, and the index should be incorporated in routine pathology reports.\r"

Gram positive cocci were not always identified in tissue, nor cultured, when serological tests were required to confirm the diagnosis. The only apparent difference between the acute and subacute type was the higher incidence of thrombi in some blood vessels of acute cases, whereas patent vessels or recanalized thrombus were usually found in subacute cases. This quantitative difference in the degree of thrombosis may alone be responsible for the varying clinical features and response to antibiotics.\r"

  ".W": "Studies in our laboratory have shown that minoxidil prolongs the life of keratinocytes in culture and extends the time after confluence that cells can be subcultured. These data suggest that the drug reduces the rate at which cells are lost from the germinative pool and hence slows senescence. In a dose-response study with minoxidil, the maximal effect of the drug was seen at doses from 6 to 12 micrograms/ml; however, activity could be detected at doses below 1 microgram/ml. Cells subcultured during log growth failed to demonstrate that minoxidil increased the total number of generations attainable under these conditions, although as expected, epidermal growth factor extended the life span of cells. When the experiments were repeated in a keratinocyte cell line that does not require a fibroblast feeder layer, the same results were obtained, indicating that the difference observed between log phase and postconfluence growth cannot be explained by the presence of fibroblasts. Minoxidil's effect on postconfluent cells was blunted by the addition of cholera toxin to the medium, suggesting that elevation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate cannot be a mechanism, although reduction of cyclic adenosine monophosphate is a possibility. Finally, maintaining keratinocytes at a 20 to 40 mM calcium concentration greatly reduced the ability of postconfluent cells to be subcultured, in comparison with the normal calcium concentration of 2 mM. That minoxidil almost completely reversed this inhibitory effect suggests it may work by preventing cross-linking by transglutaminase, which is activated by elevated calcium concentrations.\r"

  ".W": "In vivo, topical minoxidil therapy is associated with changes in the follicular epithelium, tissue and blood lymphocyte populations, lymphocyte blastogenic response to mitogens, and perifollicular vasculature. Biopsy specimens taken from areas of terminal hair regrowth show a dose-dependent increase in hair follicle length, a decrease in tissue lymphocyte populations associated with a simultaneous increase in peripheral blood lymphocyte counts, and reopening of previously closed lumina of perifollicular vessels. Responder lymphocytes show pretreatment-increased concanavalin A and phytohemagglutinin-induced blastogenesis, which decrease toward control values after treatment. In vitro, at concentrations approximating the range of tissue levels in patients treated topically with the 5% solution, minoxidil affects both epithelial cells and lymphocytes in tissue culture. Cultured murine epithelial cells show increased cell proliferation and delayed senescence. Cultured human lymphocytes show suppression of mitogen-induced blast transformation. Differential effects on responder, nonresponder, and control lymphocytes are seen. Minoxidil may induce hair regrowth in alopecia areata by a synergistic stimulatory effect on follicular epithelium and a suppressive effect on lymphocyte-mediated immunologic phenomena. A contributing role for its vasodilatory properties must also be considered.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of topical minoxidil (5% and 2% solutions) on hair regrowth was studied in the frontal bald scalp of 18 adolescent and adult stump-tailed macaques (Macaca arctoides). Gross observation of the hairiness and folliculogram analysis of the skin biopsy specimens have shown that minoxidil induces the enlargement of vellus follicles to the size of middle to terminal follicles (regrowth of hair effect), minoxidil maintains the terminal follicles in the prebald scalp of periadolescent animals (prevention of baldness effect), enlarged follicles regress after minoxidil is withdrawn, and hair follicular growth is once again stimulated when treatment with minoxidil is reinstituted. Hair regrowth was more prominent in the early stage of baldness among younger macaques than in baldness of longer duration in older animals. An in vitro study of 3H thymidine uptake revealed that the hair follicles in minoxidil-treated macaque skin showed significant enhancement of deoxyribonucleic acid synthesis in the follicular and perifollicular cells but not in the epidermal keratinocytes. Furthermore, the uptake of 3H minoxidil and its conversion to minoxidil sulfate (the active metabolite producing vasodilation) was relatively higher in the hair follicles than in the epidermis and dermis. Serum concentration of minoxidil was fairly constant 2, 4, 6, 15, and 24 hours after a single application (averaging 15 ng/ml with 5% minoxidil). Minoxidil's essential action in hair follicular growth may be as a potent vasodilator. However, a direct action on the hair follicle cannot be ruled out considering uptake and conversion of the drug to minoxidil sulfate within the hair follicle itself.\r"

(In untreated patients after hair transplant surgery, regrowth begins 3 to 5 months after surgery, after the shedding period.) A review of the literature--and personal discussions with surgeons whose hair transplant experience spans 25 years--revealed no evidence of a similar report. In addition, two of the remaining 10 patients had regrowth less than 4 weeks after postsurgical telogen effluvium. Neither patient age nor number of grafts transplanted played a predictive role. The location of the operative procedure also failed to predict, or preclude, successful regrowth. Topical minoxidil may be an important adjunctive therapy during the recuperative period in patients who have undergone hair transplant surgery. Carefully controlled studies are needed to substantiate this preliminary observation.\r"

Accordingly, mitral valvuloplasty was performed in five postmortem specimens and in 18 adult patients with rheumatic mitral stenosis, using either one (25 mm) or two (18 and 20 mm) dilation balloons. Postmortem balloon dilation resulted in increased valve orifice area in all five postmortem specimens, secondary to separation of fused commissures and fracture of nodular calcium within the mitral leaflets. In no case did balloon dilation result in tearing of valve leaflets, disruption of the mitral ring or liberation of potentially embolic debris. Percutaneous mitral valvuloplasty in 18 patients with severe mitral stenosis (including 9 with a heavily calcified valve) resulted in an increase in cardiac output (4.3 +/- 1.1 to 5.1 +/- 1.5 liters/min, p less than 0.01) and mitral valve area (0.9 +/- 0.2 to 1.6 +/- 0.4 cm2, p less than 0.0001), and a decrease in mean mitral pressure gradient (15 +/- 5 to 9 +/- 4 mm Hg, p less than 0.0001), pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (23 +/- 7 to 18 +/- 7 mm Hg, p less than 0.0001) and mean pulmonary artery pressure (36 +/- 12 to 33 +/- 12 mm Hg, p less than 0.01). Left ventriculography before and after valvuloplasty in 14 of the 18 patients showed a mild (less than or equal to 1+) increase in mitral regurgitation in five patients and no change in the remainder.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The pressure-volume relation was determined using simultaneous gated radionuclide angiography, echocardiography and micromanometer pressure. The derived chamber dynamics were then compared with quantitative histologic data (percent fibrosis and cell diameter) and adenosine triphosphate content measurements obtained from the left ventricular biopsy specimen obtained at the time of the pressure-volume studies. The measures of systolic function correlated linearly with high energy phosphate content. The adenosine triphosphate/protein ratio (nanomoles) was shown to parallel ejection fraction (r = 0.81), peak ejection rate (r = -0.73) and peak positive maximal rate of rise in left ventricular pressure (dP/dt) (r = 0.79). No correlation was observed between these variables and the percent fibrosis or cell diameter. Variable results were found in comparing the diastolic properties of the left ventricle with the biopsy data. In general, the high energy phosphate content correlated with measures of active relaxation, but not with the passive filling characteristics of the left ventricle. The adenosine triphosphate/protein ratio was linearly related to peak negative dP/dt (r = -0.74) and the peak filling rate (r = 0.76) but correlated less well with other measures of active and passive diastolic filling. No correlation was found between any diastolic variable and the percent fibrosis or cell diameter.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To examine the mechanism of this pacing-induced ischemia, the effect of incremental atrial pacing on coronary blood flow and metabolism was studied in 27 patients with angina and normal coronary arteries. Seventeen patients continued to exhibit normal lactate extraction even at heart rates up to 160 beats/min (Group 1), whereas in 10 patients (Group 2) lactate extraction changed to production at the highest pacing rate. Coronary blood flow increased in Group 1 patients by 18, 41 and 75%, respectively, as heart rate was increased by 20 beat/min increments from 100 to 160 beats/min. In contrast, coronary blood flow increased by only 8, 7 and 14%, at the three respective pacing rates in Group 2. Between the heart rates of 100 and 160 beats/min, coronary vascular resistance decreased 32% in Group 1 patients but was unchanged in Group 2 patients. There was no significant change in the ratio of myocardial O2 consumption/rate-pressure product in Group 1 patients, but this ratio decreased from 0.91 +/- 0.26 ml O2 X min-1 X (mm Hg X beats/min)-1 to 0.53 +/- 0.11 (p less than 0.05) in Group 2 patients as heart rate increased from baseline to 160 beats/min. Thus, patients with angina and normal coronary arteries who develop ischemia with pacing have a decreased coronary vasodilator response that interferes with their ability to increase myocardial oxygen supply to match the higher demand.\r"

  ".W": "On exercise thallium-201 scintigraphy, it has been noted that the size of the left ventricle is sometimes larger on the immediate poststress image than on the 4 hour redistribution image; this phenomenon has been termed transient ischemic dilation of the left ventricle. The angiographic correlates of this finding were assessed in 89 consecutive patients who underwent both stress-redistribution thallium-201 scintigraphy and coronary arteriography. A transient dilation ratio was determined by dividing the computer-derived left ventricular area of the immediate postexercise anterior image by the area of the 4 hour redistribution image. In patients with a normal coronary arteriogram or nonsignificant coronary stenoses (less than 50%), the transient dilation ratio was 1.02 +/- 0.05 and, therefore, an abnormal transient dilation ratio was defined as greater than 1.12 (mean + 2SD). The transient dilation ratio was insignificantly elevated in patients with noncritical coronary artery disease (50 to 89% stenosis) (1.05 +/- 0.05) and in patients with critical stenosis (greater than or equal to 90%) of only one coronary artery (1.05 +/- 0.05). In contrast, in patients with critical stenoses in two or three vessels, the transient dilation ratio was significantly elevated (1.12 +/- 0.08 and 1.17 +/- 0.09, respectively; p less than 0.05 compared with all other patient groups). An abnormal transient dilation ratio had a sensitivity of 60% and a specificity of 95% for identifying patients with multivessel critical stenosis and was more specific (p less than 0.05) than were other known markers of severe and extensive coronary artery disease, such as the presence of multiple perfusion defects or washout abnormalities, or both.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Before angioplasty, 19 of these 20 patients had angina. Collateral vessels to the distal part of the occluded vessel were visible in all 20 patients. A previous myocardial infarction was documented in 14 patients (9 with a Q wave and 5 with a non-Q wave infarction). At the time of follow-up, three patients were symptomatic: one had unstable angina and two had a positive stress test. The follow-up angiogram showed a significant restenosis in six patients and reocclusion in two. The mean ejection fraction had improved slightly from 59 +/- 11% to 63 +/- 9% (p less than 0.05). Left ventricular wall motion synchronism was studied using two variables for 128 shortening segments: the \"time of peak contraction\" and the \"time of peak relaxation,\" as obtained from biharmonic Fourier transformation for each segment. Their respective standard deviations reflect the synchronism of contraction and relaxation. The mean standard deviations of the two variables expressed in degrees of one cardiac cycle (360 degrees) were respectively: 5.5 +/- 0.4 degrees for the time of peak contraction and 6.0 +/- 0.5 degrees for the time of peak relaxation in the 20 normal subjects, 11.7 +/- 1.7 degrees and 23.0 +/- 3.0 degrees before recanalization and 9.6 +/- 1.8 degrees and 12.5 +/- 2.2 degrees at follow-up in the group of 20 patients.

  ".W": "The possibility of transiently entraining and interrupting the common type of atrioventricular (AV) node tachycardia (anterograde slow, retrograde fast AV node pathway) was studied using atrial and ventricular pacing in 18 patients with paroxysmal AV node tachycardia. Transient entrainment occurred in all patients. During atrial pacing, localized block in the AV node for one beat followed by anterograde conduction over the fast pathway was observed in three patients. During ventricular pacing, localized block for one beat followed by retrograde conduction over the slow pathway was not observed in any patient. Neither atrial nor ventricular fusion beats were observed during entrainment. These observations indicate in a way not previously shown that reentry involving two functionally dissociated pathways in the AV node is the underlying mechanism of paroxysmal AV node tachycardia. The inability to demonstrate atrial or ventricular fusion beats during entrainment suggests a true intranodal location of the reentrant circuit. Finally, the ability to transiently entrain intranodal tachycardia demonstrates that this electrophysiologic phenomenon is not exclusively limited to macroreentrant circuits.\r"

  ".W": "Physiologic hypertrophy resulting from intense athletic participation has been reported to result in normal, reduced and augmented overall left ventricular performance. Rather than representing true differences in left ventricular contractility, these data may reflect the variable degree of ventricular dilation and increased wall thickness that occur with different types of exercise. As such, the resultant altered loading conditions may diminish the ability of the usual indexes of left ventricular function to accurately assess the left ventricular contractile state. Therefore, three groups of elite athletes with distinct patterns of myocardial hypertrophy were investigated utilizing recently developed load-independent contractility indexes. Age-matched control subjects (n = 33) were compared with 11 swimmers, 11 long-distance runners and 11 power lifters. Rest echocardiogram, phonocardiogram and calibrated carotid pulse tracing were used to calculate left ventricular dimensions, wall thickness, mass, fractional shortening, velocity of shortening and mean, peak and end-systolic wall stresses and the stress-time and minute stress-time integrals. Compared with control subjects, all athletes had increased left ventricular mass, even when values were normalized for body surface area. Runners had a dilated left ventricular and normal wall thickness, swimmers had a mildly dilated ventricle with increased wall thickness and power lifters had normal cavity size with markedly increased wall thickness. Peak systolic wall stress was normal in runners and swimmers and reduced in power lifters, whereas end-systolic stress was low in swimmers and power lifters and normal in runners. The minute stress-time integral, a measure of myocardial oxygen consumption, was normal in runners and swimmers but was significantly reduced in lifters.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Five patients required reoperation during follow-up of 1 month to 2.5 years (mean 1.5 years). Six additional patients required programming to ventricular demand (3) or AV sequential (3) pacing, because of development of sinus bradycardia (2), atrial sensing problems (1) or pacemaker-mediated tachycardia (3). Pulse generators that could sense atrial signals less than 1.0 mV and had a programmable atrial refractory period did not require reprogramming out of the atrial tracking mode. No patient developed atrial flutter or fibrillation. Sensing problems during exercise occurred in 37% of the first 60 pacemakers but in none of the last 40, which had improved electronic components. Atrial tracking pacing is feasible in pediatric and young adult patients.\r"

  ".W": "To evaluate the risks of and optimal method for valve dilation in aortic stenosis, balloons of different sizes were used to dilate the normal aortic root in 16 lambs and then stenotic valves in 15 children. In the lambs, inflated balloon to aortic anulus diameter ratios ranged from 0.9 to 1.5. These hearts were examined immediately after the procedure. Ratios of 0.9 to 1.1 did not produce significant damage to the left ventricular outflow tract, whereas those of 1.2 to 1.5 produced tears or hematomas, or both, of the aortic valve leaflets (n = 3), mitral valve leaflets (n = 4) and interventricular septum (n = 4). The 15 patients, aged 10 days to 15 years, underwent 16 balloon aortic valvotomy procedures. The balloon-aortic anulus ratio ranged from 0.67 to 1.1 (mean 0.90). The average pressure gradient decreased 69% and, overall, the peak systolic gradient decreased from 86 +/- 21 to 28 +/- 14 mm Hg (p less than 0.01) and the aortic valve area increased from 0.44 +/- 0.11 to 0.73 +/- 0.22 cm2/m2 (p less than 0.01). Immediately after the procedure an increase in aortic regurgitation was noted in 8 (57%) of 14 patients, but was never greater than 3+ and has been well tolerated. Other early complications encountered consisted of transient left bundle branch block in two patients, temporary femoral artery occlusion in three and femoral artery rupture requiring operative management in one infant. Balloon valvotomy can reduce the transvalvular gradient in most patients with valvular aortic stenosis when a balloon less than 1.1 times the aortic root diameter is used.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

If catheterization affects early surgical mortality then perhaps omitting it would improve survival. Early operative mortality of 100 patients managed with echocardiography without preoperative catheterization (Group I) was compared with that of 151 diagnosis-matched control patients who had catheterization (Group II). The catheterization (Group II) and echocardiographic (Group I) groups included patients with the following diagnoses: atrial septal defect (33 and 17 in Group II and Group I, respectively); pulmonary stenosis/pulmonary atresia (33 and 15), aortic stenosis (14 and 3), coarctation of aorta (36 and 29), patent ductus arteriosus (10 and 15) and miscellaneous (25 and 21). Age range was 1 day to 16 years (mean 3.5); 114 (45%) of the 251 patients were less than 1 year of age and 59 (29%) were less than 1 month of age. With one exception, echocardiographic diagnosis was correct when compared with findings at surgery or autopsy, or both. Surgical mortality was 18% in Group I and 9% in Group II; however, multiple logistic regression analysis adjusting for differences in age and preoperative condition showed no significant difference between the two groups with a trend toward lower mortality in Group I (p = 0.075). Echocardiography as the definitive imaging modality in selected patients with congenital heart disease is accurate and is comparable with conventional methods of preoperative diagnosis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Eleven male patients, 5 with idiopathic and 6 with ischemic cardiomyopathy, had sinus rhythm and were hospitalized with congestive heart failure not precipitated by an acute ischemic event. All 11 patients were treated with intravenous furosemide and various vasodilators without invasive hemodynamic monitoring for a mean period of 4.3 +/- 2.1 days. This therapy resulted in subjective and objective improvement in all patients as reflected by a significant decrease in heart failure score from 9.5 +/- 2.2 to 2.7 +/- 2.3 (p less than 0.001). When compensation was achieved by clinical criteria, the patients were instrumented and hemodynamics obtained before and serially thereafter for 6 hours after the intravenous administration of digoxin given in two 0.5 mg doses 2 hours apart. In response to digoxin, cardiac index increased from 2.6 +/- 0.7 liters/min per m2 to a peak of 3.3 +/- 0.6 liters/min per m2 (p less than 0.005); left ventricular stroke work index (g X m/m2) increased from 27 +/- 16 to 43 +/- 23 (p less than 0.005) and the ejection fraction (eight patients) increased from 21 +/- 13% to 29 +/- 11% (p less than 0.04).

There were no significant changes in blood pressure or heart rate. The contractile state of the left ventricle was also assessed by the shift of the Starling curve. To construct the function curve, lower body negative pressure was used to regulate the venous return to the heart. An inotropic effect of the agent was confirmed by the shift of this function curve upward and to the left, even when an augmentation of the cardiac output was masked by the marked reduction in preload. The hemodynamic and clinical effects of OPC-8212 were encouraging and the drug appears to be promising for the treatment of congestive heart failure.\r"

  ".W": "The mechanisms of action of the potent antiarrhythmic drug amiodarone are unknown. However, amiodarone and its abundant metabolite, desethylamiodarone, bear a striking structural resemblance to thyroid hormones. In addition, certain cardiac electrophysiologic effects of amiodarone treatment are similar to those of hypothyroidism. These facts suggest that amiodarone or desethylamiodarone could be acting, in part, by blocking thyroid hormone action. Because thyroid hormones are known to act through nuclear receptor proteins, the binding of amiodarone and desethylamiodarone was measured to nuclear extracts derived from human lymphocytes, bovine atrium and ventricle and rat liver. The capacity of increasing concentrations of amiodarone and desethylamiodarone nuclear extracts to block receptor binding of radiolabeled triiodothyronine (T3) in a standard in vitro competition assay was tested. Nuclear extracts demonstrated only minimal binding to amiodarone. However, all receptor preparations had substantial affinities (KD) for the desethyl analog: lymphocyte, 8.6 microM; atrium, 35.0 microM; ventricle, 26.9 microM and liver, 8.6 microM. Desethylamiodarone accumulates in very large quantities in parenchymatous organs during long-term amiodarone treatment. Taking its usual therapeutic serum level (about 4 microM or 2.7 micrograms/ml) as an estimate of intranuclear concentration, desethylamiodarone would partially saturate nuclear thyroid hormone receptors in several different tissues, including the heart. Thus, amiodarone treatment may exert some of its electrophysiologic effects by metabolic conversion to desethylamiodarone. This metabolite may then exclude thyroid hormone from nuclear receptor sites within the myocardium.\r"

In addition, the prognosis of patients with malignant ventricular arrhythmias and coronary artery disease treated with amiodarone remains poor. The survival of 54 consecutive patients with angiographically documented coronary artery disease and symptomatic ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation treated with amiodarone was compared with that of 5,125 medically treated patients with coronary artery disease. The amiodarone group was older, with worse left ventricular function and more peripheral and cerebrovascular disease. The 1 year survival probability was 0.73 for the amiodarone group and 0.94 for the control coronary artery disease group. At 2 years of follow-up, the survival probabilities were 0.60 and 0.90 for the amiodarone and the control group, respectively. When the survival curves were adjusted for group differences in baseline prognostic characteristics (integrated as a previously published hazard score), there was no difference in the prognosis of the two groups. These findings suggest that treatment with amiodarone of malignant ventricular arrhythmias associated with coronary artery disease maintains patients on an underlying survival curve determined by the degree of myocardial dysfunction, clinical characteristics and coronary anatomy, and that amiodarone does not have a deleterious effect on survival.\r"

All three drugs had dosage-related effects on electrocardiographic intervals, refractory periods and cycle length of ventricular tachycardia. Significant linear relations between serum drug levels and changes in refractory periods and ventricular tachycardia cycle length were also observed. Ventricular tachycardia was no longer inducible on at least one drug in 11 patients but concordance of this effect on both of the others was 36% and on either of the others it was 45%. Ventricular tachycardia remained inducible on at least one drug in 28 patients and concordance of this effect on both of the others was 75% and on either of the others was 79%. Continued inducibility on quinidine, the drug producing the greatest electrophysiologic effects, was the best individual predictor of continued inducibility on the others. Subdivision of continued inducibility into easier to induce, inducibility unchanged, or harder to induce dramatically decreased concordance of this effect. Thus the antiarrhythmic effects of these drugs are discordant in individual patients despite electrophysiologic similarities. Nevertheless, continued inducibility after high dosages of any one of these drugs is clinically useful for screening for continued inducibility on the others and this is dose-related rather than drug specific.\r"

  ".W": "Assessment of the functional severity of coronary stenoses has become increasingly important as the intrinsic limitations of coronary angiography have been documented. Videodensitometric coronary flow reserve has been proposed as a means to assess the physiologic significance of a coronary stenosis in humans. This study compared videodensitometric assessment of coronary flow with microsphere quantitation in the closed chest canine model. In five dogs, flow rates were assessed at baseline, after vasodilation with adenosine, after vasoconstriction with vasopressin and during rapid cardiac pacing. The videodensitometric peak density, time to one-half peak density and washout time (time from peak to one-half peak density) were compared at each flow state with flow assessed by microsphere injection. Reproducibility of videodensitometric measurements from two different coronary injections during the same flow state was best with peak density (r = 0.94). Videodensitometric flow ratios (flow state under study to flow at rest) using peak density demonstrated a fair correlation with flow ratios by microsphere (r = 0.81). There was poor correlation between flow ratios when time to one-half peak or washout time was used. Videodensitometric flow measurements used in vivo to assess a wide range of drug-induced coronary flows may not accurately reflect coronary flow measured by microsphere.\r"

  ".U": "87167164\r", 
  ".W": "Previous studies demonstrated that treatment with superoxide dismutase, a scavenger of superoxide anions, limits the extent of myocardial injury in a canine preparation of regional myocardial ischemia and reperfusion. Little is known, however, about the effects of superoxide dismutase on the healing of a myocardial infarct. Therefore, this study was performed to determine whether treatment with superoxide dismutase during myocardial ischemia impairs formation of scar tissue after infarction. Dogs received 2 hour infusions of superoxide dismutase or albumin (controls) by way of the left atrium beginning 15 minutes before and ending 15 minutes after a 90 minute occlusion of the left circumflex coronary artery. Six weeks later the animals were killed. Two-dimensional echocardiography was performed before surgery and before induced death. Wall thickening in the central ischemic zone was decreased at 6 weeks compared with baseline studies (p less than 0.05), but the decrease was similar for both groups. The hydroxyproline concentrations (microgram/mg dry weight) of the scar tissue in the superoxide dismutase and control groups, respectively, were 35.3 +/- 3.8 and 28.7 +/- 5.0 (p less than 0.05). The ratios of the scar thickness to normal wall thickness were superoxide dismutase 0.91 +/- 0.03 and control 0.89 +/- 0.03 (p greater than 0.05). Thus, superoxide dismutase had no adverse effect on wall thickening or scar formation assessed 6 weeks after myocardial infarction, and may be useful to limit oxygen radical-mediated damage during reperfusion of the ischemic myocardium.\r"

  ".W": "This study was designed to determine the hemodynamic and hormonal consequences of aortic coarctation at rest and during treadmill exercise. Twelve normal adult dogs served as controls. In eight dogs coarctation was created within 1 week of birth by banding the aorta just proximal to the ductus ligament, thereby fixing luminal diameter at 1 to 2 mm. Studies were performed 18 months after operation. Vascular pressures were monitored proximal and distal to the coarctation, cardiac output and regional blood flow were evaluated with radioactive microspheres and blood samples were collected for determination of hormone levels and blood gases. At rest, systolic pressure in the proximal aorta was 130 +/- 12 mm Hg (mean +/- SD) in the control group and 167 +/- 16 mm Hg in dogs with coarctation (p less than 0.01). During exercise at a level that doubled heart rate and cardiac index, mean aortic pressure increased by 11 and 31% (p less than 0.01) in the control and the coarctation group, respectively. Mean distal aortic pressure increased by 8% during exercise in control dogs but decreased by 29% in dogs with coarctation. Exercise decreased flow to the kidneys and the large intestine in the coarctation group. Plasma norepinephrine concentrations were greater in the coarctation group than in control dogs at rest; during exercise, plasma norepinephrine, epinephrine and renin activity increased in both groups, but to a greater degree in the group with coarctation. These results confirm an abnormality in renal and gut perfusion in experimental coarctation and suggest that this may be related to a decline in perfusion pressure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Recently, there has been a resurgence of interest in the use of contrast-enhanced echocardiography as a means of noninvasively assessing myocardial perfusion. However, if injections of echocardiographic contrast agents are to be used for this purpose it is essential that they are not intrinsically toxic to the heart. In this study, the left ventricular end-systolic wall stress-rate-corrected velocity of fiber shortening relation, a load independent index of contractility, was studied in nine dogs. Two-dimensional and targeted M-mode echocardiographic as well as central aortic pressure tracings were made during echocardiographically gated, pressure- and volume-controlled aortic root injections of nonsonicated and sonicated Renografin-76, saline and dextrose 70% (n = 6), and sonicated and hand-agitated Renografin-76/saline mixture (n = 5). Two of nine dogs received all agents. Off-line computer videodensitometric analysis documented myocardial perfusion. In all cases, data were obtained at control and 5 and 15 seconds after injection. Additional data were collected at 25 seconds after injection for the Renografin-76/saline mixture. Alterations in contractility were measured relative to control as changes in rate-corrected velocity of fiber shortening after afterload (measured as end-systolic wall stress) was eliminated as a confounding variable. Under no condition did saline or Renografin-76 cause alterations in left ventricular contractility. Nonsonicated and sonicated dextrose 70% increased left ventricular contractility at 15 seconds but not at 5 seconds after injection. Hand-agitated Renografin-76/saline mixture induced a negative inotropic effect at 5 and 15 seconds after injection.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "M-mode echocardiographic measurement of left ventricular fractional shortening and meridional wall stress has been used extensively alone and in combination to describe left ventricular systolic function. To determine whether the improved dimensional information afforded by two-dimensional echocardiography might result in shortening and stress calculations yielding a different view of left ventricular function, we compared two-dimensional and M-mode echocardiograms in 69 subjects (19 normal, 13 with aortic stenosis, 22 with aortic regurgitation and 15 with congestive cardiomyopathy). Fractional shortening was greater with M-mode than with two-dimensional echocardiography in all subjects, especially in those with cardiomyopathy (p less than 0.05). In aortic stenosis, two-dimensional shortening, at 24 +/- 5%, was reduced (p less than 0.05 versus normal), but M-mode shortening, at 34 +/- 5%, was not. M-mode estimates of meridional stress were higher than two-dimensional values, again especially in cardiomyopathy. Two-dimensional echocardiography enabled determination of long- and short-axis ratios, circumferential stress and the ratio of circumferential to meridional stresses. Circumferential stress was elevated in aortic stenosis at 302 +/- 65 X 10(3) dynes/cm2, suggesting afterload excess as the cause for the observed reduction in two-dimensional shortening. The more spherical cardiomyopathic hearts had a meridional to circumferential stress ratio closer to 1, such that use of meridional stress alone would overestimate effective afterload. It is concluded that M-mode and two-dimensional echocardiographic analyses of left ventricular shortening and stress produce different results. Two-dimensional echocardiographic methods may enhance the assessment of ventricular function, especially in patients with aortic stenosis and cardiomyopathy.\r"

Patients with an aortic valve prosthesis were excluded. Twenty-nine patients had aortic insufficiency and had adequate color Doppler studies for analysis. The mean time between color Doppler examination and angiography was 2.3 days (range 0 to 12). The maximal length and area of the regurgitant jet were poorly predictive of the angiographic grade of aortic insufficiency. The short-axis area of the regurgitant jet from the parasternal short-axis view at the level of the high left ventricular outflow tract relative to the short-axis area of the left ventricular outflow tract at the same location best predicted angiographic grade, correctly classifying 23 of 24 patients. However, the jet could be seen from this view in only 24 of the 29 patients. The height of the regurgitant jet relative to left ventricular outflow tract height measured from the parasternal long-axis view just beneath the aortic valve correctly classified 23 of the 29 patients. Mitral stenosis or valve prosthesis, which was present in 10 patients, did not interfere with the diagnosis or quantitation of aortic insufficiency by these methods.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The serum IgE binding sites of the drugs appeared to be the ammonium ion determinants. In patients allergic to suxamethonium, one of the most frequently used muscle relaxants for general anesthesia, significant histamine release could be obtained in each case with simple diammonium salts. The length of the chain linking the ammonium groups appears to play an important role. In fact, when the length was less than or equal to 4 A, no significant histamine release could be obtained, whereas the optimal length for histamine release appeared to be greater than or equal to 6 A. Furthermore, muscle relaxants with a rigid backbone between the ammonium determinants (such as pancuronium) are less active than flexible molecules (such as suxamethonium) in initiating mediator release. This study suggests that small divalent molecules can induce anaphylactic shock in sensitized patients and that the length and the flexibility of the chain bearing the haptenic determinants appear to be important factors in the elicitation of mediator release.\r"

Suppressor T cell depletion was accomplished by treating mononuclear cells (MNCs) with the monoclonal antibody Leu 2b followed by the addition of complement. Treated and untreated MNCs were obtained before and during (6 to 24 months) immunotherapy and were cultured at 1 X 10(6) cells per milliliter for 7 days in RPM1-1640 containing 10% fetal calf serum. In order to determine the effect of ragweed antigen on IgE production, untreated or Leu 2b-depleted MNCs were incubated with short ragweed extract (SRW) (1.0 to 10 micrograms/ml) for 20 hours, washed three times, and incubated for a further 6 days. The cell-free supernatants from each were harvested and assayed for total IgE by use of a modified PRIST assay. To determine specific IgE, a modified RAST procedure was used. Total or antiragweed IgE production was calculated by subtracting preformed IgE from the total or specific IgE content in the supernatant. Depletion of Leu 2-positive cells did not affect total IgE production before immunotherapy. In contrast, a statistically significant increase was observed in total IgE 6 months (p less than 0.05) and 13 months (p = 0.005) after immunotherapy. Specific antiragweed IgE production at these times was also enhanced, but this increase did not reach statistical significance. Before immunotherapy was begun, preincubation of MNCs with SRW did not change the amount of total IgE produced.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In this article, we studied the effect of azatadine on preventing the release of histamine after nasal challenge with cold, dry air (CDA) and its effect on antagonizing nasal challenge with histamine. With histamine challenge, azatadine inhibited symptoms (sneezing, nasal congestion, and rhinorrhea) and the increase in the level of albumin in nasal secretions (p less than 0.01 all). With challenge with CDA, the drug had no effect on either symptoms or histamine and N-tosyl-L-arginine methyl ester-esterase release. Although the patterns of mediator release after CDA and after the early reaction to antigen are similar, the pharmacologic control differs, suggesting different mechanisms of induction of histamine release from mast cells.\r"

Increased levels of IgG antibodies to FCS, mock vaccine, and beta-propiolactone-modified FCS, and human serum albumin were also found.

The presence of low-density eosinophils possibly reflects an ongoing process of activation of these cells induced by the allergic reaction. Ca-ionophore-induced leukotriene (LT) C4 production, in the absence of added substrates, demonstrated a decreased potency for LT generation by low-density eosinophils compared with the LT generation of normal-density cells (57 +/- 33 ng and 103 +/- 44 ng per 10(6) cells, respectively). In contrast with the Ca-ionophore-induced LT formation, incubations with serum-treated zymosan in the presence of glutathione demonstrated higher productions of LTC4 with the low-density eosinophilic subpopulation compared with normal-density cells. This is compatible with a possibly higher expression of complement C3b receptors on the low-density eosinophils. Total arylsulfatase contents demonstrated that low-density eosinophils are not degranulated with respect to their small granules. Although release of the large granules by low-density eosinophils cannot be excluded, electron-microscopy studies indicated that degranulation is not the only (or major) factor that determines the density of the various eosinophilic subpopulations.\r"

The study demonstrates that histamine released by degranulation of basophilic cells in the nasal mucosa causes nasal hypersecretion mostly by way of the reflexive pathway. Approximately 4% of the amount of nasal secretion induced by an antigen challenge in subjects with house-dust nasal allergy was due to a leakage of plasma. There were almost no direct effects of histamine on the nasal glands. Nasal secretion induced by nasal challenge with acetylcholine after vidian neurectomy comes from the nasal glands by its direct effects on the nasal glands, the amount of which indicates degree of reactivity of the nasal glands to acetylcholine independent of hypersensitivity of the mucosal sensory system. The nasal glands of vidian neurectomized subjects having nasal allergy reacted more excessively to extrinsic acetylcholine than nasal glands of subjects of the control group. This verifies the existence of hyperreactivity in the nasal glands to acetylcholine in nasal allergy. The nasal glands of nasal allergy patients may respond more excessively to a given amount of acetylcholine released from parasympathetic terminals.\r"

Nine women with asthma and with normal menstrual cycles but not taking systemic asthma medication were asked to chart temperatures, asthma attacks, and use of asthma medication for four menstrual cycles. We measured baseline spirograms, skin and airway responsiveness to histamine, and serum levels for estradiol, progesterone, and testosterone on approximately day 7 and day 24 of two consecutive cycles. None of the women reported cyclic asthma symptoms, and review of subjects' charts demonstrated no menstrual variation in asthma attacks or use of asthma medications. We found no differences in forced vital capacity or FEV1 early compared to late in the menstrual cycle. Neither did we find a change in airway responsiveness, as indicated by the histamine dose causing a 15% fall in FEV1 or a 35% fall in specific airway conductance. Skin responsiveness as indicated by the wheal response to intradermal histamine was also unchanged. We conclude that physiologic changes in hormone levels during the menstrual cycle are not in themselves associated with changes in airway or skin responsiveness to histamine.\r"

  ".W": "Our previous study indicated that the IgE antibody responses in mice immunized with intraperitoneal injection of the antigens mixed with diesel-exhaust particulates (DEP) were higher than those in the animals immunized with the antigens alone. We examined the adjuvant activity of DEP inoculated by the intranasal route, i.e., the natural entrance of DEP. In 3-week interval immunization, the IgE antibody responses in mice immunized with intranasal inoculation of ovalbumin (OA) mixed with DEP were higher than responses in the animals immunized with OA alone. DEP had an adjuvant activity for anti-OA IgE antibody production, even in a small dose such as 1 micrograms administered with a 3-week interval. Also in 1-week interval immunization, the enhancing effect of DEP on anti-OA IgE antibody production was demonstrated when mice were immunized with intranasal inoculation of OA and DEP. The possibility cannot be excluded that DEP, which are kept buoyant in the environmental atmosphere of urban districts, may exert an adjuvant activity for IgE antibody production after being inhaled into the human body and have some relation to the mechanism of the outbreak of allergic rhinitis caused by pollens in Japan.\r"

  ".W": "The responses of human cutaneous, pulmonary, intestinal, and cardiac tissue mast cells to the histamine-releasing agent morphine sulfate (MS) were investigated in vitro. Human cutaneous mast cells released significant amounts of histamine in the presence of 1 to 100 mumol/L concentrations of MS. Histamine release was detectable within 5 minutes after challenge and was complete by 15 minutes. A maximal histamine release of 21.6% (+/- 1.4 SEM) was observed after stimulation with 100 mumol/L of MS. This MS effect was inhibited by the opiate receptor antagonist naloxone with a 59% inhibition detected at equimolar concentrations and an 88% inhibition occurring in the presence of a tenfold molar excess of naloxone. Naloxone did not alter the cutaneous mast cell response to the calcium ionophore A23187. Human mast cells derived from pulmonary, intestinal, and cardiac tissues, as well as blood basophils, did not release histamine after stimulation with 1 to 200 mumol/L of MS, whereas each of these cell preparations responded to an IgE-mediated stimulus. The results of this study demonstrate that cutaneous mast cells release inflammatory mediators after stimulation by MS, whereas mast cells residing in lung, heart, and gastrointestinal tissues do not. These observations indicate that human mast cells in different anatomic sites can vary in their functional responses.\r"

  ".W": "The Committee on Allergen Standardization of the American Academy of Allergy and Immunology obtained information about 46 fatalities that had occurred during immunotherapy (IT) or skin testing (ST) since 1945. Sufficient information for complete analysis was provided for 30 patients (six for ST and 24 for IT). Of the 30 fatalities, there were 15 male and 15 female fatalities ranging in age from 7 to 70 years (x = 33 years). Known errors of administration accounted for three and possibly an additional three fatalities. Ten fatalities occurred during seasonal exacerbation of the patient's disease, four in patients who had been symptomatic at the time of the injection, two of whom had been receiving beta-adrenergic blockers. Of the 24 fatalities associated with IT, four had experienced previous reactions, 11 manifested a high degree of sensitivity, and four had been injected with newly prepared extracts. Fifteen of the 30 fatalities had received pollen extracts as part of the fatal injection. Of the six fatalities associated with ST, five were due to intradermal testing without prior puncture testing. The signs and symptoms were variable and did not indicate that death was imminent nor predict the cause of death. The time to onset of the reaction was less than 30 minutes in 22/30, more than 30 minutes in 3/30, and not reported in 5/30. The cause of death in 14/16 patients with asthma was respiratory. Epinephrine had been administered to 18, not administered to three, and was either not recorded or unknown in the remaining nine patients. Since seven to 10 million allergen injections are administered yearly, the risk of a fatal reaction is low and may be lessened even further as additional precautions are taken in the selection and treatment of allergic patients and in improved treatment of the anaphylactic reactions.\r"

Demographic data were collected in personal interviews, and systematic analyses were conducted of subjects' medical records. Mean intake of energy, folic acid, and calcium was below the RDAs for both men and women, and intake of thiamin was below the RDA for men. Nutrient intake failed to meet the RDAs for nine leader nutrients in 40% to 80% of the sample. Fewer than 20% of the subjects were able to name the Basic Food Groups or any of their food components. The subjects' age, income, gender, marital and health status, living situation, and educational level did not predict nutrient intake. Poor dietary intake among older, homebound persons, coupled with diverse medical problems, places them at major risk of nutrition problems. The nutrition needs and problems of the homebound elderly should be considered in the delivery of home health care services.\r"

Half the patients received monthly diet counseling that was individualized and aimed at normalizing nutrient intake; the other half of the patients received no diet counseling and served as controls. Over the 6-month study period, the mean nutrient intakes met or exceeded the 1980 U.S. Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) for all nutrients except folate in the men and iron and folate in the women. However, at study entry, for each nutrient there was a substantial proportion of patients whose intake did not meet the full RDA. Less than 50% of the men consumed the full RDA for energy and folate, and less than 50% of the women consumed the full RDA for energy, folate, calcium, iron, thiamin, and vitamin B-12. Monthly diet counseling sessions were associated with increases in the mean intake of most nutrients, whereas similar improvement was not observed in the control group members, who did not receive counseling. By 6 months, significantly more counseled than non-counseled patients were consuming the full RDA for protein, riboflavin, and vitamin C (p less than .05). Thus, diet counseling was found to be an important tool for improving the nutrient intake of outpatients with Crohn's disease.\r"

Data from 3,500 individuals, 15 years of age or older, interviewed in the fall quarter of the 1977-78 Nationwide Food Consumption Survey were used. Results indicate that although the nutrient density of food eaten away from home was lower than that of food eaten at home, the persons studied did not eat out frequently enough to influence the adequacy of their diets significantly. The low nutrient density of food eaten away from home does suggest, however, that individuals could be putting themselves at risk of some nutrient inadequacies (particularly of calcium and vitamins A, B-6, and C) or of caloric excess if they substantially increase their frequency of eating away from home. Teenagers and senior citizens seem most vulnerable to potential nutritional inadequacies.\r"

In a study having a 3 X 3 X 2 factorial design, 10 trained observers recorded 1,560 measurements from 52 healthy adult subjects selected to represent three factors: sex, age, and weight for height. Each observer obtained three independent measurements from every subject. By analysis of variance, the variation between different observers' measurements of the same subject was estimated with 95% confidence to be less than or equal to 2.8% for men and less than or equal to 3.8% for women. This variation was unaffected by age but decreased with decreasing weight for height in women (p less than .05). Variation between each observer's repeated measurements of the same subject was estimated with 95% confidence to be less than or equal to 1.1% and was unaffected by sex, age, or weight for height. It was concluded that the smallest detectable change in arm circumference is 7.8% for men and 9.8% for women when successive measurements are recorded by different observers. However, arm circumference changes as small as 2.2% can be detected in both men and women when successive measurements are obtained by the same observer.\r"

This study compared the use of current guidelines alone with the integration of the urea kinetic modeling-derived protein catabolic rate and current guidelines for the nutrition assessment and management of 27 chronic renal failure patients on hemodialysis. In phase 1, subjects were counseled according to current renal nutrition guidelines. In phase 2, subjects were kinetically modeled and counseled with incorporation of the urea kinetic modeling-derived protein catabolic rate value. Thirteen subjects received a 1-month follow-up. Food records and time length of counseling sessions were recorded in phases 1 and 2. Significant changes seen in the mean blood urea nitrogen value during phase 2 (no. = 22, p less than or equal to .05) and follow-up phase (no. = 13, p less than or equal to 0.05) reflected an improved protein intake from phase 1 for the majority of subjects. Dietary intake and time length of counseling sessions in both phases were not significantly different. The following correlations were noted: reported protein intake and protein catabolic rate: r = .685, p less than or equal to .001; protein catabolic rate and blood urea nitrogen: r = .799, p less than or equal to .001; blood urea nitrogen and serum albumin: r = .485, p less than or equal to .05. Results suggest that the urea kinetic modeling-derived protein catabolic rate value positively affects patient adherence to diet recommendations.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "87167201\r", 
  ".W": "Noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus is a major health problem, highly correlated with obesity and, therefore, overeating. Diet continues as the cornerstone of therapy, with oral hypoglycemic agents or insulin added, if needed, to maintain normal blood glucose values. The diet prescription should be implemented in stages, with caloric restriction the first priority, as weight loss itself diminishes hyperglycemia to or toward normal. Combinations of foods and even different processing or cooking of the same food may produce different glucose responses. These factors minimize the role of the glycemic index in overall diabetes management. Foods with high soluble fiber content may diminish glucose elevations after meals; however, high-fiber foods appear to be less important for the obese diabetic person than adhering to a calorie-restricted diet and achieving weight loss. Attempts should be made to alter life-style within an acceptable degree for any given patient to encourage weight reduction. For example, although exercise may have a small but transient direct effect in lowering blood glucose and insulin resistance, it can be considered an adjunct to decreased calorie diets for weight reduction. Finally, it appears prudent to prevent or reverse obesity, especially in individuals with a family history of diabetes, in the hope that the onset of diabetes may be prevented or postponed.\r"

  ".W": "Americans are eating out an average of 3.7 times per week and are spending almost 40% of their food dollar doing so. A Gallup Survey shows about 39% of consumers claim to have improved their eating habits while eating out, but restaurant patrons are most concerned about nutrition when dining out on a routine visit or while in a family-style restaurant. Restaurant patrons are also now more likely to order lower sodium meals, small-size portions, and lower calorie entrees. Although the opportunity to promote nutrition in the foodservice setting exists, restaurant chefs and managers often lack the background to take advantage of it and could benefit from the services of qualified nutrition professionals. Dietitians could assist in identifying menu items appropriate for nutrition promotion, recipe development, and staff training. However, a realistic approach must be maintained, and the following facts should be kept in mind: Nutritious restaurant fare should blend with the theme of the menu and be promoted primarily on its sensory attributes. Nutrition in restaurants is best received when promoted generally and within the scope of health and wellness. Descriptive menu items should be carefully used. A restaurant consultant should be current on controversial food and nutrition trends. The wait staff should be properly trained.\r"

  ".W": "Maintaining optimal nutrition in the pediatric patient with Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) is challenging, but it may be one of the most effective therapies. Patients experience numerous complications that compromise nutritional status. Infection, fever, diarrhea, feeding problems, and decreased intake all contribute to malnutrition, which in turn predisposes the patient even more to infection and malabsorption. Nutrition assessment should be done routinely so that new problems may be identified and treated. High-calorie, high-protein feedings, vitamin supplementation, and, when necessary, gavage feedings or parenteral nutrition are recommended to improve nutritional status and prevent further deficits. Maintaining optimal nutrition in the pediatric patient with Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) poses a significant challenge to the health care team. Patients may experience numerous complications that compromise nutritional status. The patient is at high risk for opportunistic infections, especially of the lungs, central nervous system, gastrointestinal (GI) tract, and skin. Such infections are common causes of morbidity and mortality. Impaired nutritional status may further impair the patient's immunocompetence. A study by Kotler and Gaety demonstrated severe progressive malnutrition in adult AIDS patients, with the lowest measures of lean body mass occurring in those patients close to death at the time of the study. While no studies of children with AIDS have been done to date, we have subjectively observed feeding problems, weight loss, and malnutrition in most of the patients we have seen.\r"

A consistent quality-controlled product increases consumer satisfaction and repeat purchase of product. Administrative dietitians have applied the concepts of using human error rates (the number of errors divided by the number of opportunities for error) at four hospitals, with a total bed capacity of 788, within a tertiary-care medical center. Human error rate was used to monitor and evaluate trayline employee performance and to evaluate layout and tasks of trayline stations, in addition to evaluating employees in patient service areas. Long-term employees initially opposed the error rate system with some hostility and resentment, while newer employees accepted the system. All employees now believe that the constant feedback given by supervisors enhances their self-esteem and productivity. Employee error rates are monitored daily and are used to counsel employees when necessary; they are also utilized during annual performance evaluation. Average daily error rates for a facility staffed by new employees decreased from 7% to an acceptable 3%. In a facility staffed by long-term employees, the error rate increased, reflecting improper error documentation. Patient satisfaction surveys reveal satisfaction, for tray accuracy increased from 88% to 92% in the facility staffed by long-term employees and has remained above the 90% standard in the facility staffed by new employees.\r"

An accurate stature obtained by summing five segmental measurements was compared to the stature recorded in the patient's chart and calculated estimates of stature from measurement of a long bone (humerus, tibia, knee height). Estimation of stature from measurement of knee height was highly correlated (r = 0.93) to the segmental measurement of stature while estimates from other long-bone measurements were less highly correlated (r = 0.71 to 0.81). Recorded chart stature was poorly correlated (r = 0.37). Measurement of knee height provides a simple, quick, and accurate means of estimating stature for bedridden females in nursing homes.\r"

This prospective study evaluates their use among consecutive medical and surgical admissions to an acute care hospital.

Cox regression analysis was used to calculate relative risk of restraint while adjusting for duration of hospitalization as well as other variables. Restraints were applied to 37 (17%) of the 222 study patients. Restrained patients were eight times more likely to die during hospitalization (24% v 3%; P less than 0.01). Abnormal mental status exam, diagnosis of dementia, surgery, and presence of monitoring and support devices (eg, intravenous lines) were statistically significant independent predictors of restraint. Mechanical restraint is a common occurrence among nonpsychiatric inpatients particularly those with impaired mentation, requirement for surgery, or intensive medical intervention. Identification of medical and surgical patients at risk for restraint may reduce the use of these devices by concentrating surveillance and prevention on this group.\r"

  ".W": "A two-year study of 159 community dwelling Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients evaluated in a geriatric clinic is reported. Patients were not as disabled as commonly supposed, having only a moderate reduction in cognitive function (Folstein mean Mini-Mental Status [MMS], 15.3) and physical activities of daily living (PADL), mean, 3.3, but were more dependent in their instrumental activities of daily living (IADL), mean, 1.9. Associated medical problems averaged 3.4 per patient. Forty-seven percent lived alone and 39% had not been out of the home in the previous week, making isolation a major concern. During the study, 34% went into nursing homes. Initial mean MMS of these patients was 12.4 compared to 16.6 for patients who remained at home, but activities of daily living (ADL) mean scores were not significantly different. Based on this assessment, the management of AD patients, including medication use, daycare, education and support for family caregivers, and nursing home placement, is discussed.\r"

Hospital mortality was 3.9% for elective and 22.8% for nonelective patients; 18-month mortality was 13.0% and 47.4%, respectively. Fifty-nine patients (60.8% of survivors) completed follow-up questionnaires. Subjective and objective quality of life was good. Quality of life was slightly worse for ICU survivors than for controls; elective and nonelective patients did not differ significantly. Although the cost of ICU hospitalization was high, additional medical care was not excessive. Nonelective patients required more continuing care than elective patients, and both groups required more than controls.\r"

Each patient was assessed three times: prior to admission, and at four and 12 months after admission to the unit. Patients were evaluated using a modified version of a previously published assessment scale as well as with a standardized New York State numerical rating system. There was an increased level of functioning in both mental and emotional status and basic functions of daily living at both four (P less than or equal to 0.001) and 12 months (P less than or equal to 0.005). The improvement in scores was maintained over a prolonged time period, despite the expectation of progression of the dementing process. There was no change noted on the New York State assessment. Our data suggest that a select group of demented elderly can benefit from being placed on a specialized dementia unit.\r"

Incontinence was highly associated with each of the physical and mental functional disabilities we examined. However, with the exception of recurrent urinary tract infections and dementia, no specific clinical factors were significantly more common among incontinent than continent patients. Although precise causes for the UI were not determined, these data highlight the potential role of impairments of physical and/or mental function in the pathogenesis of UI among NH patients, and emphasize the need to address these impairments in future research on the assessment and treatment of UI in this population.\r"

Moreover, patients with Barrett's esophagus with acid sensitivity took longer to develop pain during acid perfusion (p less than 0.05), and overall, experienced less severe symptoms (p less than 0.01) than those with reflux esophagitis. Over a 2-week period, as judged by diary, the Barrett's group had less frequent (p less than 0.01) and less severe (p less than 0.01) heartburn symptoms than the other patients.

Esophageal manometry documented a hypotensive lower esophageal sphincter in three patients and low peristaltic amplitude in the distal esophagus in four. Treatment was begun with cimetidine, 300 mg orally four times daily. If symptoms did not totally abate, bethanechol, 25 mg orally four times daily, was added. Cimetidine completely relieved or dramatically reduced symptoms in all patients. Adding bethanechol produced further symptomatic improvement in three of four patients. After initial dilatation in the two patients with strictures, there was no recurrence. Endoscopic evidence of inflammation resolved completely in four patients and was markedly improved in two. Treatment with both drugs was well tolerated by all patients. The abnormally placed squamo-columnar junction did not regress during follow-up.\r"

The extent, duration, and major clinical features of Crohn's disease did not differ between patients with DF and those with other fistulas. Six of the patients underwent surgery for refractory disease or abscess formation and two patients were treated medically. All improved and were able to maintain an adequate oral intake after treatment. At follow-up 3-10 years later, the surgically treated patients were well but both medically treated patients had died, one from a probably unrelated brain tumor 7 years after discharge and one from necrotizing pancreatitis 10 years later. Our experience suggests that the presence of a DF is not an absolute indication for early surgery. The initial therapeutic management of such patients should be determined by the nature and severity of the underlying Crohn's disease rather than the presence of a DF. The late pancreatic complication in a patient with a chronic DF, however, raises the question of an association between the two.\r"

The only feature common to all seven patients was a long history of chronic constipation. All patients were treated surgically with no mortality and with minimal morbidity. We believe that severe untreated chronic constipation may, on rare occasions, cause free perforation of the sigmoid colon.\r"

Of 183 patients with such cancers 15 (8.2%) had hypercalcemia. Hypercalcemia was defined as serum calcium level greater than 11.0 mg/dl on at least two determinations. The incidence of hypercalcemia by site was 5 of 74 (6.8%) liver, 1 of 16 (6.3%) biliary tract, 4 of 33 (12.1%) pancreas, 3 of 15 (20.0%) esophagus, 0 of 37 stomach, 0 of 2 duodenum, 2 of 5 colon, and 0 of 1 rectum carcinomas. There was no sexual or age predisposition to hypercalcemia. Bone scans and/or x-ray results were positive in three of eight, negative in five of eight, and were not evaluated in the remaining seven patients. Of five patients tested, four had low to normal serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels, and one had a serum PTH level high by C-terminal assay but normal by N-terminal assay. Serum chloride levels at the late stage of hypercalcemia were less than 102 mEq/L in all patients. Therefore, hyperproduction of PTH was unlikely to be a causative factor for hypercalcemia. Indomethacin was given to four patients with hypercalcemia with no effect on serum calcium levels in any cases. Survival from the diagnosis of hypercalcemia ranged from 2 to 96 days (mean 33 days). We conclude that hypercalcemia is a complication not infrequent at the late stages of cancers of the digestive organs, with the exception of gastric cancer, and a portent of a poor prognosis.\r"

In an effort to study the impact such a system has on residents in emergency medicine, residents participating in helicopter transport were surveyed at 10 programs in the United States. The potential survey field was 118 residents with (81%) responding. Generally helicopter transport was perceived to be educational (80%), enjoyable (88%), and safe (74%). A total of 75% felt that benefits of transport outweighed the risks, despite an increase in aeromedical helicopter fatalities in 1985. In six of ten programs residents wore shoulder restraints, in two they wore helmets, and in no program were fire-retardant clothing worn on a regular basis. Of the 72 residents involved in mandatory participation, 69% would continue flying in a voluntary system. Although it is clear that selected patients benefit from aeromedical transports, refined triage protocols as well as further studies to identify the costs and benefits of such transport programs to participating emergency medicine residents are needed. Flight safety equipment including helmets, shoulder-harness restraints, and fire-retardant suits are underutilized at all programs surveyed.\r"

Five of six SS patients without focal CNS disease but with psychiatric disease or cognitive dysfunction had detectable CSF SC5b-9, whereas two other SS patients without focal CNS or neuropsychiatric disease had no detectable CSF SC5b-9. Six of seven patients with SLE or SLE overlap syndrome with CNS involvement had CSF SC5b-9, whereas two patients with SLE without CNS involvement had no CSF SC5b-9. A subset of SS and SLE patients with CNS disease had SC5b-9 detected in CSF but not in serum. SC5b-9 was generally absent from the CSF of patients with noninflammatory CNS diseases. These findings demonstrate intrathecal activation of terminal complement in patients with CNS SS or CNS SLE, and suggest a role for terminal complement activation in the pathophysiology of CNS involvement in both SS and SLE.\r"

  ".U": "87167556\r", 
  ".W": "Antibodies to self-antigens are characteristic of several human and murine autoimmune diseases. Subsets of those autoantibodies cause organ damage in some instances, such as IgG antibodies to DNA in human and murine systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Our experiments in the NZB/NZW F1 (BW) female mouse model of SLE were designed to define idiotypic (Id) structures on antibodies to DNA in attempts to distinguish pathogens from nonpathogens within the anti-DNA population. Two important findings emerged. First, the number of public Id expressed became relatively restricted as the mice aged, with three such Id (IdX, IdGN1 and IdGN2) dominating and accounting for 30 to 95% of the total serum IgG in all individual nephritic mice studied, and 81 to 86% of the total IgG in serum pools from 30-wk-old nephritic mice. Second, IdGN1 and IdGN2 constituted approximately 50% of the IgG deposited in glomeruli of nephritic mice; IdX was present in negligible quantities in glomeruli, whereas it was usually the most frequent Id in BW serum. These latter findings suggested that pathogens and nonpathogens can be distinguished by their idiotypy in this animal model. The finding of relative Id restriction suggests the occurrence of an idiotypic \"spreading\" phenomenon, in which a regulatory process appears as BW mice age that results in repeated selection and expansion of this small number of Id, one group of which, the IdGN, is pathogenic. This process was further suggested in experiments in which IdX was suppressed by administration of anti-IdX; the \"escape\" antibodies to DNA appearing after suppression of IdX were composed largely of IdGN1 and IdGN2, without a major contribution from Id-negative mutants. Defining the basis of this Id spreading or restriction phenomenon may provide important information regarding the pathogenesis of this autoimmune disease.\r"

Plasma concentrations of the antibodies were the highest in mice with incipient nephritis and the lowest in mice with progressive nephritis. Mice with attenuated nephritis due to immunosuppressive therapy had intermediate plasma concentrations of the antibodies. The specific concentrations (ng/microgram IgG) of anti-RNA polymerase I antibodies in kidney eluates were significantly (10- to 70-fold) greater than the corresponding plasma concentrations. These results indicated that the decreased plasma concentration of the antibodies in mice with more advanced disease was at least partially due to selective concentration of anti-RNA polymerase I antibodies in the kidneys. The degree of this selective concentration was directly proportional (R2 = 0.9962) to the severity of renal disease, as reflected by the concentration (microgram/g tissue) of IgG eluted from the kidneys. The concentration (microgram/g tissue) of anti-RNA polymerase I eluted from the kidneys also was increased in mice with more severe renal disease. Further, the extent of this increase was greater than that of total IgG, again suggesting that anti-RNA polymerase I antibodies had been selectively concentrated in the kidneys. These findings are strongly suggestive of an important role for the RNA polymerase I/anti-RNA polymerase I antibody system in the pathogenesis of murine lupus nephritis.\r"

Previous work demonstrated that monoclonal antibody 53.6 reacted with every human cell line tested, as well as with subpopulations of normal bone marrow and peripheral blood lymphocytes. Mitogen stimulation of peripheral blood lymphocytes with phytohemagglutinin resulted in increased expression of the antigen recognized by 53.6. Immunoprecipitation of biosynthetically labeled KG-1A cell extracts with 53.6 revealed that the antigen is a nonglycosylated acidic protein of Mr 34,000. Analysis of mouse-human hybrid cell lines indicated that the structural gene for the antigen is encoded on chromosome 11. The antigen recognized by 53.6 is distinct from previously described cell surface antigens based on its distribution on activated cells and biochemical characteristics. These studies indicate that the 53.6 antigen is a novel proliferation-associated antigen, and may be useful in analyzing lymphocyte activation.\r"

The algorithm is based on the amphipathic helix model in which antigenic sites are postulated to be helices with one face predominantly polar and the opposite face predominantly apolar. Such amphipathic structures can form when the polarity of residues along the sequence varies with a more or less regular period. Hence they can be identified by methods (so called power spectrum procedures) that detect periodic variations in properties of a sequence. The choice of power spectrum procedure, hydrophobicity scale, and model parameters are examined. An algorithm is tested by comparing the predicted amphipathic segments with the locations of the known T cell sites, counting the number of matches, and calculating the probability of getting this number by chance alone. The optimum algorithm, which predicts the largest number of sites with the lowest chance probability, uses the Fauchere-Pliska hydrophobicity scale and a least squares fit of a sinusoid as its power spectrum procedure. By applying this algorithm, 18 of the 23 known sites are identified (75% sensitivity) with a high degree of significance (p less than 0.001). The success of the algorithm supports the hypothesis that stable amphipathic helices are fundamentally important in determining immunodominance. This approach may be of practical value in designing synthetic vaccines aimed at T cell immunity.\r"

Recovery from acute babesiosis is associated with development of protective immunity against subsequent challenge with both homologous and heterologous parasites. Viable and infectious merozoites, the intraerythrocytic stage of B. bigemina responsible for clinical disease, were separated from contaminating host cells by density gradient centrifugation. Monoclonal antibodies developed against gradient-separated merozoites were screened for surface reactivity against live merozoites in an immunofluorescent binding assay. Surface-reactive antibodies immunoprecipitated five major biosynthetically radiolabeled merozoite proteins with relative m.w. of 72,000, 58,000, 55,000, 45,000, and 36,000 in SDS-PAGE. Two additional proteins immunoprecipitated with the 45,000 m.w. protein were unreactive with monoclonal antibody in western blots and are apparently part of a membrane complex co-precipitated by this antibody. In contrast, additional proteins of m.w. of 36,000, 35,000, and 33,000, immunoprecipitated with the 58,000 protein, all contain the surface-exposed epitope bound by monoclonal antibody. Immune serum from an animal that had recovered from infection with a Mexico isolate of B. bigemina immunoprecipitated five radiolabeled proteins from the Mexico isolate that co-migrated in SDS-PAGE with major proteins precipitated by surface-reactive monoclonal antibodies. In addition, antibodies against a Kenya isolate of B. bigemina immunoprecipitated the same co-migrating proteins from radio-labeled Mexico isolate, demonstrating epitope conservation between surface proteins of geographically different isolates. The identification of proteins with epitopes exposed on the surface of live merozoites and accessible to antibody provides candidates to be tested as protective immunogens in cattle.\r"

To examine the relationship between NK cells and cells of the T lineage we have examined purified NK cells from a mutant mouse strain (scid) with severe combined immunodeficiency. Approximately 40% of the lymphoid cells in the spleens of scid mice expressed the NK-specific marker NK-2.1. All NK activity of the scid spleen cells could be accounted for by the NK-2.1+ population, similar to results obtained by using normal C57BL/6 X DBA/2 (B6D2F1) mice. Sorted NK-2.1+ cells proliferated in response to human recombinant interleukin 2 (r-IL 2) but not to concanavalin A (Con A), and were maintained in culture for 2 to 3 wk. Cultured NK-2.1+ cells displayed a cell surface phenotype (Asialo-GM1+, Thy-1.2+, L3T4-, Lyt-2-) and lytic activity similar to that described for freshly isolated NK cells of normal mice. Furthermore, T cell receptor (TCR) genes of the TCR-gamma and TCR-beta loci were in germline configuration, and no functional transcripts of TCR-gamma, TCR-beta, or TCR-alpha were detected. We propose that the expression of the TCR is not necessary for functional NK activity, and NK cells are distinct from both mature cytotoxic T lymphocytes and the earliest identifiable T cells.\r"

In this study we characterized sera from CB3-infected mice for their reactivity with three different myosin isoforms (heart, skeletal muscle, and brain myosins) and for autoantibody isotype by using an ELISA. Competitive inhibition assays and absorption studies with various myosins demonstrated the presence of two autoantibody populations in sera of susceptible A.CA and A.SW mice. The first was specific for cardiac myosin and was mainly IgG. The second antibody population cross-reacted with heart, skeletal muscle, and brain myosin and was mainly IgM. B10.PL/SgSf and B10.A/SgSf mice, which do not develop immunopathic myocarditis, produced only the IgM autoantibody population cross-reactive with all three myosin isoforms. Because the heart-specific myosin autoantibodies were found exclusively in the mouse strains that developed immunopathic myocarditis, they can be considered a serologic marker for autoimmune heart disease.\r"

  ".W": "In the present study, we used monoclonal antidinitrophenol (DNP) antibodies to determine certain of the biophysical characteristics of precipitating and nonprecipitating antibodies. In addition, we studied the dynamics of immune complex (IC) formation when precipitating antibodies react with antigen in the presence of nonprecipitating antibodies. The antigen utilized in these studies was DNP-bovine serum albumin. All isolated nonprecipitating anti-DNP antibodies were of the IgG2b isotype, whereas all antibodies with other isotypes (IgG1, IgG3, IgM, IgA and IgE) were precipitating. Nonprecipitating antibodies did not differ significantly from precipitating antibodies in affinity, valence, or isoelectric point. Nonprecipitating antibodies inhibited the formation of precipitable IC between antigen and precipitating antibodies. In addition, preformed IC precipitates were solubilized by nonprecipitating antibodies. The solubilization of IC precipitates was influenced by the isotype of the precipitating antibody and by the antibody:antigen ratio in the IC precipitate. By isokinetic sucrose density centrifugation, we determined that solubilization of IC precipitates by nonprecipitating antibodies was associated with release of free precipitating antibody and formation of soluble IC between the antigen and the nonprecipitating antibody. In conclusion, in this study the nonprecipitating property of mouse anti-DNP antibodies is isotype-specific. Nonprecipitating antibodies compete and displace precipitating antibodies from the antigen, resulting in inhibition of IC precipitation and in IC solubilization. On the basis of the present results, we postulate that antibody-antibody interactions are important determinants of precipitating ability, and that these interactions are a characteristic of antibody isotype.\r"

We have shown that the optimal activity of these acute-phase proteins requires a functioning complement system, and it can take place even in the xid mouse, which has virtually no naturally occurring anti-pneumococcal antibody in its serum. These studies provide additional evidence that CRP may play a protective role in pneumococcal infections, and it may help postpone the development of fatal levels of pneumococci in the blood, long enough for an effective anti-pneumococcal antibody response to be generated.\r"

  ".W": "A murine monoclonal antibody (MAb) (15TD3) was found to recognize a unique filamentous structure in Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-producing lymphoblastoid cell lines. By immunofluorescent morphology, in comparison with a control MAb to vimentin, the 15TD3 filamentous structure was judged to be associated with intermediate filaments of the cytoskeleton. Expression of the 15TD3 antigen and vimentin was induced simultaneously in some EBV genome-positive cell lines either by EBV superinfection or by 12-0-tetradecanoyl-1-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA) and n-butyrate treatment. The 15TD3 antigen was considered to be a restricted component of the EBV-induced early antigen (EA) complex. The 15TD3 antigen was expressed only in EBV genome-activated cells after either spontaneous EBV genome activation, EBV superinfection, or TPA and n-butyrate treatment. The expression of 15TD3 antigen paralleled the induction of EA in several models of induction of EBV antigens, and was detected only in EA+ cells which were stained with anti-EA+ human sera. The reactivity of 15TD3 MAb was blocked with anti-EA+ human serum, but not with anti-EA- serum. The synthesis of 15TD3 antigen was not inhibited with phosphonoacetic acid, was resistant to acetone fixation, and was sensitive to ethanol (or methanol) fixation. Human lymphoblastoid cells from patients with acute infectious mononucleosis were cloned for the production of antibodies which detected EBV-specific or -nonspecific epitopes on filamentous structures. Two human MAb were defined by two-color immunofluorescence to react to the 15TD3 determinants on intermediate filaments of EBV+ cells. This study supports the following views: that EBV genome activation induces a structure associated with intermediate filaments, and that antibodies against both the EBV-specific, intermediate filament-associated epitope and native intermediate filament epitopes are produced by some EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines from patients with infectious mononucleosis.\r"

The mean number of binding sites/(E) for Yz-1 monoclonal anti-CR1 correlated with the number of sites for polyclonal anti-CR1 that had been determined 2 to 4 yr previously in 18 normal persons (p less than 0.001), 18 patients (p less than 0.001), and 28 relatives (p less than 0.001), indicating that CR1 sites/E was a stable characteristic in all three groups. The mean number of Yz-1 sites/E was 281 +/- 34 (+/- SEM) in 28 probands with SLE and 457 +/- 21 in 93 relatives, both determinations being less than that for 100 normal persons, 553 +/- 21 (p less than 0.002). Thirty-six patients and 51 normal individuals were also assessed for the presence of the 7.4 kb and 6.9 kb HindIII CR1 allelic restriction fragments that correlate with high and low expression, respectively, of CR1 on E. The distribution of patients differed from normal (p less than 0.05), with a smaller proportion being homozygous for the 7.4 kb allele. In addition, the mean numbers of Yz-1 sites/E for patients and relatives who were homozygous (p less than 0.02) and heterozygous (p less than 0.05) for the 7.4 kb allele were significantly lower than those for normal persons matched for the HindIII RFLP, suggesting the existence of additional heritable factors that decrease CR1 expression. The stability over time of the CR1 deficiency among patients, the finding of decreased CR1 number among an expanded group of relatives, the altered frequency among patients of CR1 alleles defined by the HindIII RFLP, and the decreased expression of CR1 on E among patients and relatives compared with normal individuals having the same HindIII RFLP indicate a role for genetic factors in CR1 deficiency in SLE.\r"

Control BN and DA rats received syngeneic cells. Rats were injected i.v. with [methyl-3H]thymidine for 1 h before being killed at 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14 days after the cellular inoculum. A piece of ventral abdominal skin was removed. Autoradiography was used to determine cell proliferative activity (labeling index, LI) in mast cells and fibroblasts of the dermis and basal cells of the epidermis. In addition, the number of mast cells per high-power field was determined for all 4 groups of rats: control DA, GVHD-DA, control BN, and GVHD-BN. Only GVHD-BN rats demonstrated extensive dermatitis. The LI of mast cells, fibroblasts, and basal cells decreased in control rats with increasing age. Although there were differences between DA and BN rats, there was a general pattern of increased proliferation of mast cells at early time points of GVHD followed by a decrease to or below control levels. The number of mast cells per high-power field also increased at early time intervals in both the DA and BN GVHD rats, but decreased significantly at later time points. These data confirm previous studies on chronic GVHD which demonstrated a decrease in the number of mast cells in the skin. Fibroblast LI was decreased at day 1 in both DA and BN GVHD rats. In GVHD-DA, fibroblast LI remained depressed while GVHD-BN demonstrated a second peak in LI at day 10 before declining below control levels. The most prominent basal cell response occurred in GVHD-BN between days 6-14 and is probably indicative of an attempted reparative response associated with GVHD dermatitis in this species. These data demonstrate that the activation of mast cells (proliferation and subsequent degranulation) correlates temporally with cell kinetic alterations occurring in the dermis and epidermis during acute GVHD.\r"

At concentrations within its potential physiologic range, intradermal injection of C5a elicits immediate wheal and flare reactions, increased vascular permeability, mast cell degranulation, and neutrophil-rich infiltrates. To assess the relative contribution of interacting cellular elements to C5a-induced inflammation in normal human skin, purified human C5a was tested intradermally in 8 patients with bone marrow failure (BMF). Reactions to C5a in patients with BMF were compared with responses at identical test sites in healthy volunteers and other patients with cutaneous disorders. Patients with BMF demonstrated significantly less wheal and flare reactivity following intradermal injection of C5a than controls (p less than 0.05 and less than 0.02, respectively). In these studies, patients with the greatest cytopenia generally showed the least cutaneous reactivity to human C5a. Biopsies of C5a test sites in patients with BMF revealed an absence of leukocytes in marked contrast to neutrophil-rich infiltrates observed at test sites in healthy volunteers. Avidin-fluorescent and/or Giemsa staining of skin biopsies revealed no difference between the number of dermal mast cells in patients with BMF and samples of normal human skin. In addition, skin test studies with histamine (2 micrograms) and morphine (5 micrograms) performed to assess cutaneous vascular and mast cell responsiveness in patients with BMF, normal volunteers and controls with rhinitis revealed no significant differences in cutaneous reactivity to these pharmacologic agents. These in vivo studies demonstrate that patients with BMF specifically exhibit decreased cutaneous reactivity to human C5a and suggest that neutrophils make an important and an immediate contribution to inflammatory responses elicited by this anaphylatoxin.\r"

Apparent molecular weights for epidermal cathepsins B, H, and L were higher than those for comparable liver enzymes of adult rats. The cysteine proteinase inhibitor in epidermis was found to inhibit cathepsins B, H, and L but not cathepsin D and aminoendopeptidase of rat epidermis.

The microsomal fraction exhibited the highest esterifying activity and was stimulated by the addition of palmitoyl-CoA and dithiothreitol, but not by palmitic acid. Saturation kinetics with an apparent Km of about 6 microM for retinol were noted. Experiments with competitive and noncompetitive inhibitors of [3H]retinol esterification established that the epidermal enzyme was an acyl-CoA:retinol acyltransferase (ARAT; EC 2.3.1.76). The specificity for retinol was not absolute; a few closely related vitamin A alcohols were equally good substrates. The ARAT activity was not significantly altered by physiologic variations in the epidermal vitamin A content. In conclusion, mouse epidermis expresses ARAT activity which may be of importance for the regulation of vitamin A metabolism at the cellular level.\r"

Retinol is distributed to target cells by the retinol-binding protein (RBP), which circulates in the plasma in complex with transthyretin (TTR). In this study we have addressed the question of retinol delivery to the epidermis via RBP. Retinol radiobinding assays, affinity chromatography with TTR coupled to Sepharose beads, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and immunoblotting techniques were used to show that epidermal extracts contain retinol binding sites with no affinity for TTR. Immunoreactive RBP was detected in the epidermal extracts. The RBP in the epidermis was in the apoform (without retinol) in contrast to serum where the majority of RBP is in the holoform (with retinol). Epidermal RBP was converted in vitro into the holoform only after addition of 20 times more retinol, which was needed to reconstitute holoforms of RBP in dermal extracts, human buccal mucosal extracts, and delipidized normal serum or purified delipidized RBP. Moreover, several immunoreactive RBP bands (possibly degradation products) were identified in the epidermal but not in dermal extracts. Retinol-binding protein from nonkeratinizing human oral mucosa showed different immunoblotting patterns when compared to epidermal RBP. These results suggest that degradation of RBP within the epidermis may result in a decreased retinol supply to the keratinocytes, and may lead to the cornification of the epidermis.\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies have shown that the fibronectin receptor function of keratinocytes is activated during wound healing in vivo and during cell culture in vitro. In order to study the specificity of activation in culture, two series of experiments were carried out. First, freshly isolated human keratinocytes were tested in short-term assays to determine their adhesion to several different ligand-coated substrata including fibronectin, collagen, basement membrane, concanavalin A, and wheat germ agglutinin. Second, human keratinocytes were cultured on the above substrata, and after various times, the cultured cells were harvested and retested for adhesion. We found that, compared with freshly isolated cells, cultured keratinocytes were activated more than 30-fold in their attachment to fibronectin-coated substrata but unchanged in their attachment to other ligand-coated substrata. In addition, cultured keratinocytes were activated in their capacity to spread on all ligand-coated substrata. The cells that expressed enhanced adhesiveness were found to be mostly basal keratinocytes, based on immunofluorescence staining studies. Also, basal keratinocytes attached selectively on substrata coated with fibronectin, collagen, or HR-9 basement membrane, but not on substrata coated with lectins. We propose that the activation of keratinocyte adhesiveness is a novel feature of basal keratinocytes required for reepithelialization during wound repair.\r"

The dimer yields produced by a broadband UVA source, by broadband UVA filtered to remove all light of wavelength less than 340 nm, and by narrow band radiation centered at 365 nm were similar, indicating that UVA radiation, and not stray shorter wavelength radiation, was responsible for dimer production. The identity of the UVA-induced DNA lesions was confirmed as pyrimidine dimers by photoreactivation of approximately 100% of the endonuclease-sensitive sites in vitro with the 40,000 dalton Escherichia coli photoreactivating enzyme.\r"

Normal human melanocytes have been found to grow exponentially in the presence of 10(-11) M cholera toxin and 10 ng/ml of 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate in routine tissue culture media. They could be trypsinized up to 3-4 passages. Melanocytes of the uninvolved skin of vitiligo subjects manifested a lag of 8-11 days for the onset of growth and they could not be passaged. Melanocytes obtained from both hypo- and hyper-pigmented perilesional skin failed to grow under these conditions. Only in a few cases where the perilesional skin was normally pigmented did the melanocytes manifest some growth after a lag of 15 days. The initial seeding capacity of the melanocytes from uninvolved and perilesional skin of vitiligo patients were, respectively, 50% and 25% of the normal individuals. Vitiligo lesions themselves gave rise to unidentified dendritic cells that survived for 10-15 days without manifesting any growth. Our results suggest that melanocytes of individuals with vitiligo are defective. This fact has to be taken into account in any theory on the etiology of vitiligo.\r"

Utilizing microsurgical techniques, split-thickness skin grafting with syngeneic skin grafts, and the congenitally athymic (nude) rat, a skin sandwich flap system has been generated that has an independent but accessible vasculature and thus fills this void. We describe the methodology that has been developed to create the flap and present experiments that: demonstrate a lack of significant collateral circulation; quantify the microcirculation of the skin sandwich flap, host side, and graft side at various times during and after the flap has been generated, and note that blood flow to the flap is basically unchanged from host skin; demonstrate the utility of the system in measuring the amount of [14C]benzoic acid that appears in the flap when deposited on the surface in volatile and nonvolatile vehicles as a function of time; and demonstrate the fact that the flap can be reused, and that the total amount of [14C]benzoic acid absorbed across skin does not change in a substantial way as the flap ages.\r"

  ".W": "Arachidonic acid (AA), the precursor of prostaglandins and leukotrienes, can be directly liberated from membrane phospholipids by phospholipase A2 or indirectly by phospholipase C. One or both of these enzymes may be responsible for the increased content of AA found in psoriatic lesional epidermis. Keratome biopsies were obtained from normal and psoriatic individuals. After homogenization and sonication, a 10,000 g supernatant was used as the enzyme source. The activities of both phospholipase A2 and C were assayed in each sample using phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylinositol, respectively, as substrates. Phospholipase A2 activity was found to be significantly higher than normal in both uninvolved and lesional psoriatic epidermis. In contrast, phospholipase C activity was significantly higher than normal in only the psoriatic plaque on the basis of wet weight (p less than 0.001), protein (p = 0.01), and DNA (p = 0.004) content. Phospholipase C activity in pmol diacylglycerol formed/min/microgram DNA was: normal 4.96 +/- 0.80, n = 13; uninvolved 7.29 +/- 1.06, n = 18; plaque 14.44 +/- 2.50, n = 18. Analysis (pH profile, calcium requirement, substrate specificity, and saturation kinetics) of pooled epidermal extracts showed no inherent differences in phospholipase C from normal and psoriatic epidermis, suggesting either a higher concentration or the presence of an activated form of the enzyme in psoriatic plaque. Since phospholipase C activity, in contrast to phospholipase A2 activity, is elevated only in lesional epidermis, it is possible that this enzyme contributes to AA accumulation observed in this tissue.\r"

The frequency of erythemogenesis was determined in vivo for these 7 lower aliphatic primary alcohols. The frequency of erythemogenesis correlated strongly and significantly with the rate of substrate utilization by alcohol dehydrogenase. These results are consistent with the view that the reaction to primary alcohols applied topically to human skin is provoked, in large part, by the corresponding aldehyde.\r"

Intestinal tissues from animals dying of this disease contained up to 10(8) colony-forming units of M. paratuberculosis/g of tissue. The clinical and pathological features of paratuberculosis in this species were comparable to those reported for paratuberculosis in ruminants and Mycobacterium avium infections in primates. By enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, antibodies to M. paratuberculosis were found in 79%-84% of the animals. Antibodies could not be detected in six animals with clinical disease. These findings extend the natural host range of M. paratuberculosis to include nonhuman primates and add support to current suggestions that M. paratuberculosis may be pathogenic for humans.\r"

Mean total body clearance of pentamidine before surgery was 46.7 ml/min per kg, of which only 2.0 ml/min per kg was due to renal clearance had fallen 80%--to 0.4 ml/min per kg. Two dogs with azotemia and two control dogs received 14 daily infusions of pentamidine. Kinetic parameters measured after the last dose were not significantly different from those after the first dose, and the amount of pentamidine recovered from tissues was similar for dogs with azotemia and controls. In summary, because renal clearance of pentamidine accounted for such a small proportion of total body clearance, none of the parameters measured was affected significantly by moderate azotemia.\r"

The percentage of vaccinees who seroconverted on the 10th and 30th days after the first vaccination was higher for the rHBsAg vaccinees than for the recipients of plasma-derived vaccine (rHBsAg: 10% on day 10 and 70% on day 30; HEPTAVAX-B: 0% and 25%, respectively). The only statistically significant difference in titers of antibody to HBV surface antigen was noted 30 days after the first vaccination. Both vaccines induced a shift in antibody from the 19S to the 7S fraction and a specific antibody response to the a determinant. The rHBsAg vaccine was not associated with significant reactogenicity or toxicity and was somewhat more immunogenic than the currently licensed product.\r"

The fluid phase of the preparation of beta-propiolactone and human serum albumin completely inhibited IgE binding to solid-phase vaccine. Of 21 subjects with urticarial reactions to a booster, 19 had IgE to doubly inactivated vaccine and to beta-propiolactone and human serum albumin. None of 27 immunized subjects without urticaria had detectable IgE. In paired pre- and postimmunization sera, IgE appeared in six of seven of the subjects with urticaria and in one of seven nonreactors.

During one to 15 years of follow-up, histological deterioration was documented in 77% of anti-HDV-positive patients; however, in hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) carriers without HDV infection, histology deteriorated in 30% but improved or remained unchanged in the majority of patients (P less than .01). In seven (70%) of the 10 anti-HDV-positive patients who showed transition from chronic active hepatitis to cirrhosis, this event was observed within the first two years of follow-up. The probability of evolution to cirrhosis was significantly higher in anti-HDV-positive patients than in patients without antibody to HDV (P less than .001). These findings indicate that HDV infection in patients with chronic hepatitis B is associated with a more-rapid progression to cirrhosis compared with HBsAg carriers with chronic hepatitis and no evidence of HDV infection.\r"

Suppression of fever had a markedly deleterious effect on the course of infection, resulting in an increased content of infectious virus in the mesenteric lymph nodes, increased mortality, and retarded recovery in animals that survived the infection. Histological lesions were mainly lymphocytic depletion in lymphoid organs and lymphoid necrosis in both rabbits treated with antipyretics and those left untreated, but damage was more pronounced in the former than in the latter. More viral antigen was detected by immunofluorescence in lymphoid organs of drug-treated rabbits than in those of untreated rabbits. Antipyretic treatment resulted in higher serum interferon levels in the early phase of infection and an increased antibody response in animals that survived the infection.\r"

Complement studies showed activation of the alternative pathway proportional to the number of dead cells; C3 was fixed on dead cells, and C5a was generated. Neutrophils (PMNLs) adhered to killed fibroblasts, a process requiring fresh serum. After adhering to killed fibroblasts in the presence of serum, PMNLs exhibited depressed chemotactic responsiveness to activated serum and reduced bactericidal activity against preopsonized Staphylococcus aureus. These data suggest that thermally killed cells activate and fix complement, a process generating cleavage products that, in turn, recruit PMNLs and bind them to the inflammatory site. Thus, in our model, dead tissue activates humoral mechanisms and inflammatory cells; this process results in depressed in situ host-defense function upon subsequent local challenge with microbes.\r"

This article provides a three-phased guide for obtaining a comprehensive history of vitamin-mineral supplement use. Phase 1 determines current and past behaviors with respect to kind, dosage, frequency, duration, and constancy of supplement intake. Phase 2 considers patient beliefs about taking supplements and outcomes of supplement usage. Phase 3 outlines considerations important for patient guidance. A vitamin-mineral supplement history should be a routine component of every complete medical history.\r"

The results demonstrate that within and between diagnoses there is both consensus and disagreement in case management. A standard of practice can be inferred for those management options achieving consensus. Further research is indicated for those options generating considerable disagreement to resolve the discrepancies in standards of care.\r"

To achieve these purposes, all patients entering the center were asked to fill out a Family APGAR questionnaire during the month of March 1984. Physicians learned of the results in a randomly selected one half of all cases. A chart review was conducted one month later. Twenty-four percent of patients reported family dysfunction (APGAR less than 6). Knowledge of the APGAR score did not increase the frequency with which physicians evaluated family function (20 percent known vs 17 percent unknown) or diagnosed family dysfunction (6.3 percent known vs 6.4 percent unknown). Patients with self-reported family dysfunction as defined by the Family APGAR did not have more psychosomatic complaints noted in their charts than patients without self-reported family dysfunction. Family dysfunction is a common problem in family practice patients, it is recorded infrequently in patients' charts, and knowledge of the results of a screening device does not increase the frequency with which family dysfunction is noticed.\r"

  ".W": "Dane County (Madison), Wisconsin, has experienced a dramatic transformation of its health services into competing closed-panel health maintenance organizations (HMOs). The change occurred literally overnight after the state, as the dominant employer, implemented price competition. In 1983, 22 percent of the 24,000 state employees in Dane County were enrolled in closed-panel HMOs; in 1984 about 85 percent enrolled in one of seven major competing physician HMO plans. In 1985 state employees basically stayed with the HMO they had chosen in 1984, and the only major shift was continued movement away from the standard fee-for-service plan. The Dane County HMO plans were less costly than fee-for-service plans to the state and to the state employee. Fee-for-service state enrollees self-reported greater use of inpatient hospital services and self-reported poorer health than employees selecting HMOs when controlling for age between the two groups. This article describes these changes, why they occurred, and the initial impact on employees as an example relevant to HMO development that may occur elsewhere.\r"

Dream material was gathered by an independent interviewer using the Staged Interview Technique, a newly developed interview technique that limited bias. The outcome measures used were obtained at the time of cardiac catheterization. Different levels of severity of cardiac disease with these measures were interpreted as representing different biological states. The patients' dreams were evaluated for the predicted correlations of the number of dream references to death (men) and separation (women) with different levels of severity of heart disease. The severity of heart disease was evaluated with anatomical (coronary angiography) and physiological (ejection fraction) measures obtained at cardiac catheterization, each represented by a 6-point scale of increasing severity. There was no correlation of the number of dream references with the severity of abnormalities on coronary angiography. However, the number of dream references to death and separation correlated with the severity of cardiac dysfunction, as measured by the ejection fraction, which is a more sensitive parameter of disease severity. The data provided prospective support for the hypothesis by showing that dreams reflected a biological state, the ejection fraction. This suggested a possible biological \"meaning\" of dreams.\r"

Contrary to prediction, alcoholics differed from control subjects as much on the easy analogies as they did on the hard analogies, which suggested that alcoholics differ both qualitatively and quantitatively from nonalcoholics in cognitive impairment. Finally, in two of three studies in our laboratory, familial alcoholics had significantly lower CLAT scores than nonfamilial alcoholics. These findings emphasize the importance of considering familial history of alcoholism when studying the neuropsychological functioning of alcoholics.\r"
