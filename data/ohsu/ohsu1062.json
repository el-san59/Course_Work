Analyses of model systems, such as the uptake of enteropathogenic Yersinia into cultured cells, indicate that the particular mammalian cell receptors bound and the nature of the binding event dictate whether the bacterium remains extracellular or enters host cells.\r"

In particular, it has been suggested that correlated firing of retinal ganglion cells in the same eye directs the segregation of their synaptic terminals into eye-specific layers within the lateral geniculate nucleus. Such correlations in electrical activity were found by simultaneous recording of the extracellular action potentials of up to 100 ganglion cells in the isolated retina of the newborn ferret and the fetal cat. These neurons fired spikes in nearly synchronous bursts lasting a few seconds and separated by 1 to 2 minutes of silence. Individual bursts consisted of a wave of excitation, several hundred micrometers wide, sweeping across the retina at about 100 micrometers per second. These concerted firing patterns have the appropriate spatial and temporal properties to guide the refinement of connections between the retina and the lateral geniculate nucleus.\r"

This protein contains a catalytic domain similar to that of calmodulin-dependent kinases and a calmodulin-like region with four calcium binding domains (EF hands). The predicted structure of this kinase explains its direct regulation via calcium binding and establishes it as a prototype for a new family of calcium-regulated protein kinases.\r"

The complementary DNA and part of the gene for an 87-kilodalton human protein that is necessary for Ah receptor function have been cloned. The protein is not the ligand-binding subunit of the receptor but is a factor that is required for the ligand-binding subunit to translocate from the cytosol to the nucleus after binding ligand. The requirement for this factor distinguishes the Ah receptor from the glucocorticoid receptor, to which the Ah receptor has been presumed to be similar. Two portions of the 87-kilodalton protein share sequence similarities with two Drosophila proteins, Per and Sim. Another segment of the protein shows conformity to the consensus sequence for the basic helix-loop-helix motif found in proteins that bind DNA as homodimers or heterodimers.\r"

Cloned polymerase chain reaction products were used to analyze coding sequences of the V3 loop in the gp120 glycoprotein. The original isolate HIV-1 Bru, formerly called LAV, was derived from patient BRU. HIV-1 Lai was derived from patient LAI and contaminated a HIV-1 Bru culture between 20 July and 3 August 1983. The culture became, in effect, HIV-1 Lai, identifiable by a unique motif in the V3 loop. Because of this contamination two, rather than one, HIV-1 isolates were sent to the Laboratory of Tumor Cell Biology at the National Cancer Institute on 23 September 1983. Original HIV-1 Bru was indeed present in the sample marked JBB/LAV. However the M2T-/B sample harbored HIV-1 Lai, a strain capable of growing on established cell lines. The striking similarity between HIV-1 Lai (formerly LAV-Bru) and HTLV-3B sequences remains.\r"

Analysis of the protein's sequence reveals no similarities to any other DNA binding proteins except for the existence of two domains that are characteristic of high mobility group (HMG) proteins.

However, the origin of retrons is unknown. A P4-like cryptic prophage was found that contains a retroelement (retron Ec73) for msDNA-Ec73 in an E. coli clinical strain. The entire genome of this prophage, named phi R73, is 12.7 kilobase pairs and is flanked by 29-base pair direct repeats derived from the 3' end of the selenocystyl transfer RNA gene (selC). P2 bacteriophage caused excision of the phi R73 prophage and acted as a helper to package phi R73 DNA into an infectious virion. The newly formed phi R73 closely resembled P4 as a virion and in its lytic growth. Retronphage phi R73 lysogenized a new host strain, reintegrating its genome into the selC gene of the host chromosome and enabling the newly formed lysogens to produce msDNA-Ec73. Hence, retron Ec73 can be transferred intercellularly as part of the genome of a helper-dependent retronphage.\r"

High school aged boys were the subject of 60% of all inquiries, 26% of which were made by parents and were exclusively related to sports. Football and athletics in general were the most common reasons for inquiry (62%), but 36% of the adolescents were interested in steroids for psychosocial reasons. Nearly 60% of the inquiries by adolescents and 36% of those by parents were considered to be serious, as opposed to casual. All inquiries regarding adolescents were for boys, and less than 1% were nonwhite. On hundred seventy-seven physicians (34%) reported 802 possible steroid users. Only 17 patients fit the stereotype of a steroid user (ie, competitive bodybuilders or professional and collegiate athletes); football players comprised 12.4% of the total. Those thought to be using steroids for psychosocial reasons equaled almost 10% of the total. All those identified as steroid users were male and only nine were nonwhite. The survey results suggest that interest in and use of anabolic steroids are common, rather than the exclusive purview of competitive athletes. This study is the first to demonstrate parental interest in anabolic steroids.\r"

The complication rates were almost identical (37% and 35%). Differences in operative mortality, incidence of cholangitis, and recurrence of jaundice were not statistically significant between patients having biliary decompression via the common bile duct or the gallbladder. Operative mortality associated with choledochoenterostomy was 33% versus 17% for cholecystoenterostomy. Gastric outlet obstruction developed in 5% of patients who did not have GE. We conclude that cholecystojejunostomy is an effective method of biliary bypass. Because its addition did not seem to increase operative morbidity or mortality, we advocate GE at the initial exploration to prevent gastric outlet obstruction.\r"

Patients with low stage CRC (0 or A) had smaller tumors, were less likely to be anemic at presentation, and were more likely to have tumors located in the left side of the colon than patients with tumors at stage B or higher. Thirty-two of the 246 tumors were detected in asymptomatic patients through screening. These tumors were more likely to be of a lower stage than those in patients with active gastrointestinal symptoms. In our experience active screening programs detect a relatively small number of CRCs. A majority (66%) of CRCs are still detected from symptoms referable to the gastrointestinal tract.\r"

We advocate this method in patients with abnormalities detected on DRE or with elevated levels of prostate-specific antigen or prostatic acid phosphatase, and as preoperative screening in patients having TURP because of the potential impact of a preoperative diagnosis of cancer upon the choice of treatment.\r"

The remaining 122 patients were judged to be asymptomatic when inspiratory and expiratory chest roentgenograms, recorded serially over a 24-hour period, revealed no intrathoracic trauma. Subcutaneous air was found in five of the patients, and an aorto-right ventricular fistula was found in one patient during his follow-up visit to the clinic a week later. The fistula was repaired uneventfully. No late-developing complications were detected in a review of the charts a year later. We believe a patient with a stab wound to the chest but with no evidence of intrathoracic injury may be appropriately managed with limited observation, including serial inspiratory and expiratory roentgenograms of the chest.\r"

One patient died, and the other four recovered after removal of the vascular access device and appropriate antibiotic therapy. The increased risk of polymicrobial bacteremia associated with long-term hemodialysis should be taken into account when empiric antibiotic therapy is undertaken.\r"

A geriatric team was formed, sharing staff and resources from existing units. To determine the efficacy of intermediate care, automated data sources at the Nashville Veterans Administration Medical Center provided data on discharge status, length of stay, and diagnoses of patients in both the acute and intermediate care units. The first year's experience indicated that careful communication and education of nursing staff was required to initiate the Intermediate Care Service with no staff resigning. An interdisciplinary team facilitated better patient care and discharge planning. Among 190 patients discharged from this service, 57% were discharged home and 22% into nursing homes; this can be compared to those discharged from acute care units of the hospital: 84% home and 4% to a nursing home; 20% of the patients in the Intermediate Care Service were discharged to a lower level of care than the initial hospital discharge plan had indicated. A 1.4-day decrease in average length of stay in the hospital has occurred since initiation of the Intermediate Care Service.\r"

To assess management practices, we retrospectively reviewed the medical records of individuals with acute back pain treated at three independent general medicine walk-in clinics. Patients having an acute flare-up of chronic back pain were excluded. Bed rest was recommended at the initial visit for 171 patients who had normal findings on neurologic examination. The duration of recommended bed rest was recorded in 76 of these 171 patients' medical records (44%). The median duration of recommended bed rest was 5.5 days (range 1 to 14 days). Most patients (60/76 [79%]) were advised to rest in bed longer than 2 days. Even if all patients in whom duration of bed rest was not recorded had been told to rest in bed for 2 days or less, bed rest prescriptions would still have been too lengthy in 60 of these 171 patients (35%). This practice may prolong the recovery of patients with acute low back pain.\r"

The most common manifestations were abdominal pain or tenderness (13 patients) and cloudy dialysate (six patients); only two patients had fever. Peritonitis without localized intra-abdominal abscess formation occurred in all instances. Intraperitoneal aminoglycoside therapy for 3 to 14 days (mean 10.7 days) eradicated infection in 14 cases. Two patients were successfully treated with 4 days of intraperitoneal gentamicin followed by 8 days of oral ciprofloxacin; another was cured with 10 days of IV ceftriaxone. Tenckhoff catheter removal was necessary in only one patient. Unlike pseudomonal or fungal peritonitis associated with CAPD, infection due to Acinetobacter species is generally responsive to antimicrobials alone.\r"

In addition, posterior structures in the heart such as the left atrium, left atrial appendage, atrial septum, and mitral valve are seen with poorer resolution than structures closer to the anterior chest wall. Placement of a sonographic transducer in the esophagus immediately behind the heart circumvents these limitations. Newly developed probes are well tolerated by sedated conscious patients as well as by patients receiving ventilatory assistance in the intensive care unit and those under general anesthesia. Consequently, transesophageal echocardiography is now available for further enhancement of cardiac diagnosis in outpatients, for evaluating the hemodynamic status of critically ill patients in the intensive care unit, for intraoperative assessment of cardiac repairs, and for intraoperative cardiac monitoring in noncardiac surgical procedures. A series of case examples from our practice during a recent 1-year period illustrates the clinical utility of this technique in these settings.\r"

The extreme severity of this disorder was probably related to the use of a combination of dopamine antagonists in a patient who had premorbid cerebral dysfunction. Although dopamine antagonists should always be used with caution in individuals with cerebral dysfunction, this particular combination of antiemetics should probably be avoided in such patients.\r"

Chordoma was not considered high on the list of differential diagnoses. A right pontine hemorrhage, which was evacuated surgically, was diagnosed in the second case both from its clinical appearance and from that on CT scan. Only when bone windowing technique was used with CT was a lytic lesion of the right petrous bone evident. Chordoma was only diagnosed on autopsy. In reviewing these two cases and the literature, it is evident that chordoma must be considered in the differential diagnosis of erosive lesions of the petrous bone.\r"

Disorders that affect one or more of these components and produce intentional dementia include Binswanger's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, HIV infection, closed head injury, normal pressure hydrocephalus, neoplasms, syphilis, vitamin B12 deficiency, multiple sclerosis, and a number of uncommon degenerative and acquired syndromes. Depression may resemble intentional dementia. Guidelines for diagnosis and management are discussed.\r"

Only five of 17 patients had concomitant pulmonary tuberculosis. A typical computed tomographic scan was helpful in the diagnosis. Diagnosis was made at emergency (five patients) or elective (six patients) laparotomy, by endoscopic (two patients) or percutaneous (three patients) biopsy or on the basis of roentgenologic and clinical evidence (one patient). All responded to antituberculous chemotherapy. With the spread of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), tuberculosis has become increasingly frequent in urban areas and it must be suspected in all immigrants and patients with AIDS presenting with abdominal complaints.\r"

One hundred and five aspiration cytologic specimens were obtained from palpable solid tumors of the breast just prior to excisional biopsy. Specimens were numbered and submitted to three different staff pathologists for diagnosis in a single blind manner. Results were then compared with tissue diagnosis of the same tumors. Of 105 specimens taken at biopsy of the breast, 28 malignant lesions were diagnosed on the final tissue report. Of those, ten were diagnosed as malignant (Class V), two were highly suspicious (Class IV) and six were insufficient specimens (Class O). Of those diagnosed as class IV and V by the results of cytologic examination, all were malignant on permanent section for a specificity of 100 per cent and a sensitivity of 36 per cent. The cytologic diagnoses of Classes I, II and III did not correlate with any histologic report, benign or malignant. Malignant growths were misdiagnosed by cytologic examination in 36 per cent and missed because of inadequate specimens in 28 per cent. We believe that a Class V cytologic finding is sufficient basis on which to perform definitive treatment of carcinoma of the breast provided rigid criteria are used. There is a learning curve associated with this diagnostic modality.\r"

  ".U": "91240440\r", 
  ".W": "The effect of ischemia on hepatic protein synthesis during sepsis is not known, but is of clinical relevance, since hepatic blood flow decreases during the late phase of sepsis. In this study, synthesis of acute-phase proteins was measured in perfused livers of rats 16 hours after sham operation or cecal ligation and puncture. Livers from each group had 45 minutes of complete ischemia or control perfusion. Protein synthesis was measured during two hour perfusion after the ischemia or control period, by determining incorporation of 3H-leucine into total secreted trichloracetic acid precipitated proteins, immunoprecipitated complement component C3 and albumin and phosphotungstenate-precipitated alpha 1-acid glycoprotein. Lactate, glutamine-oxalacetic transaminase (GOT) and glutamic-pyruvic transaminase (GPT) levels in the perfusate were measured during preischemic and postischemic perfusion. Tissue glutathione levels were measured at the end of the perfusion. Synthesis of alpha 1-acid glycoprotein was increased by 100 per cent and albumin synthesis decreased by 46 per cent in septic livers, consistent with an acute-phase response and apparent downregulation of albumin synthesis during early sepsis. Synthesis rates were reduced by 50 to 60 per cent after ischemia in perfused livers from sham operated rats and 70 to 80 per cent in livers from septic rats. Hepatic production of interleukin-1 was not different between the groups during perfusion. GOT and GPT levels increased significantly during ischemia of both nonseptic and septic livers and rapidly returned toward baseline during reperfusion. Lactate levels were higher in perfusate of septic than of nonseptic livers before ischemia and increased further during ischemia. The results suggest that ischemia inhibits production of secreted hepatic proteins similarly in nonseptic and septic livers, but perhaps to a slightly greater extent in septic livers.\r"

The mean acute PBEL was significantly elevated compared with the mean convalescent PBEL (40.5 +/- 29.0 versus 5.4 +/- 2.1 picomoles per liter, p less than 0.05). PBEL were highest in patients with multiple injuries (60.5 +/- 33.2 picomoles per liter, n = 16). PBEL were also elevated with isolated injuries of the head, face or limbs, and even with less severe injuries, namely multiple abrasions. PBEL were low in patients with abdominal (two patients) or spinal (two patients) injuries. Convalescent PBEL were consistently low. Severely injured patients (Injury Severity Score [ISS] of more than ten) had significantly elevated PBEL compared with patients with minor injuries (ISS less than 10), but some children with low ISS had elevated PBEL. The presence of head injury did not influence PBEL and there was no correlation between PBEL and systolic blood pressure. We have demonstrated that the PBEL is elevated in pediatric patients with trauma.\r"

  ".W": "Fine needle aspiration cytologic studies are being used with increasing frequency to diagnose carcinoma of the breast. To determine whether or not a diagnosis of carcinoma established by cytologic examination is sufficiently accurate to proceed to treatment without tissue confirmation, we have examined our results in a series of 109 patients who had 111 aspiration cytologic procedures followed by open biopsy between January 1985 and June 1987. From this group, 39 specimens were read as malignant and 19 were read as suspicious. Thirty-eight of 39 specimens with positive readings were from lesions that proved to be malignant on subsequent open biopsy. Seventeen of 19 suspicious specimens were also from malignant lesions. Three of 17 specimens that were inadequate and nine of 36 negative specimens were from lesions that were later shown to be malignant. Our single false-positive result occurred on cells that had been air dried during preparation in the early months of experience with this technique at our institution. Re-evaluated later in our series, the same specimen was called suspicious rather than malignant. We conclude that a positive reading on fine needle aspiration is highly accurate. The positive predictive value should be 100 per cent, once experience is gained in preparing and interpreting the material. Open biopsy is necessary for inadequate, negative or suspicious specimens to exclude a malignant lesion if the clinical or mammographic findings are consistent with carcinoma.\r"

  ".W": "To date, no five year survival rates have been reported for patients with hepatic metastases (HM) from breast origin treated by chemotherapy or hormone therapy. This study was done to evaluate whether or not surgical excision of such metastatic disease associated with chemotherapy has any effect on such a poor prognosis. Between May 1985 and September 1988, 22 patients with a diagnosis of isolated (solitary or multiple) HM have been surgically treated. The therapeutic approach also included systemic preoperative and postoperative chemotherapy. Laparotomy findings for those 22 patients are presented. There were benign hepatic lesions in four patients (four different histologic types) and hepatectomy was done in two patients. Diffuse metastatic disease contraindicated any attempt at hepatic resection in six patients. Hepatectomy was possible in 12 patients. There was no postoperative mortality and minimal morbidity. One-half of the patients with metastases had one or more positive lymph nodes at the hepatic pedicule. Median survival time for 12 patients treated by hepatectomy was 37 +/- 9 months after hepatectomy and 42 +/- 3 months after the discovery of HM. Eleven patients had other metastases after an average period of 11.8 months after hepatectomy, and the liver was the first site of recurrence in eight. One patient underwent a hepatectomy twice. Two patients were free of disease 29 to 46 months postoperatively in spite of poor prognostic features on the excised specimen. Although the median survival time was two times better than with usual treatment, we believe this procedure is of doubtful benefit. In this situation, hepatectomy acts as cytoreductive surgical treatment, with the main limiting factor being the relatively low effectiveness of chemotherapy. This type of therapy can be applied only to a restricted number of patients, and if we decide to proceed with this study, we will have to modify the protocol of chemotherapy radically.\r"

  ".W": "Hemorrhage is the most frequent complication of endoscopic sphincterotomy, with a reported incidence of 2 to 9 per cent. Previous reports have generally defined this complication clinically, leaving the issue of occult bleeding after sphincterotomy essentially unaddressed. Seventy-five serial sphincterotomies were reviewed to further assess this complication. Nine patients had clinically evident hemorrhage and 27 patients had occult bleeding manifested only by a decrement in hematologic parameters, for a total postsphincterotomy bleeding rate of 48 per cent. No statistically significant risk factors for bleeding were delineated. Endoscopically recognized bleeding at the time of the sphincterotomy was 47 per cent sensitive and 85 per cent specific in predicting postprocedural bleeding. Significant delayed hemorrhage was manifest in three patients, one of whom had clinically occult bleeding. We conclude that bleeding complicates endoscopic sphincterotomy much more frequently than previously reported, although often in a clinically occult manner. Significant delayed bleeding can occur, and may not be clinically apparent. Bleeding recognized endoscopically at the time of sphincterotomy is an insensitive but relatively specific predictor of postprocedural bleeding. As use of endoscopic sphincterotomy increases, careful surveillance for hemorrhagic complications, as well as efforts to identify factors predisposing to the same, will be of increasing importance.\r"

Multivariate analysis (stepwise logistic regression) showed that five variables were correlated with the presence of CBD stones--size of CBD equal to or greater than 12 millimeters, gallstones equal to or less than 10 millimeters, advanced age, chronic or acute cholecystitis and past history of biliary colic. Using a scoring system, a group of patients with a low risk (less than 2 percent) of CBD stones could be easily determined. In this group of patients, operative cholangiography may be avoided.\r"

  ".W": "Congenital hernias in the lumbar region are very uncommon. Approximately 10 per cent of all lumbar hernias are congenital and the vast majority are unilateral. We report our experience with seven congenital lumbar hernias in six infants treated during a five year period. All patients presented in the first year of life with abnormal protrusions in the lumbar region. In addition to the lumbar hernia, major associated malformations, including caudal regression anomalies, diaphragmatic hernia, ureteropelvic junction obstruction, cloacal exstrophy and lipomeningocele, were observed in 66 per cent of the infants and were consistent with lumbocostovertebral syndrome. In five patients, unilateral defects were repaired primarily. One patient with bilateral lumbar hernia underwent staged repair. The larger right-sided defect was repaired using a polytetrafluoroethylene prosthesis. At a second operation two months later, the small left-sided hernia was closed primarily. All patients have done well without recurrence with a follow-up period ranging from four to 48 months. Early repair of congenital lumbar hernias in infants after correction of other life-threatening conditions is advocated. Unlike the acquired variety, congenital lumbar hernia may include a more extensive deficiency of the entire lateral abdominal wall extending to the rectus sheath and inguinal ligament and satisfactory closure of the defect without prosthetic material may be difficult or impossible.\r"

Blood contact was defined as percutaneous, mucous membrane, nonintact skin or intact skin contact of patient blood with any member of the operative team. Blood exposure was defined as contact in any of the preceding categories excluding intact skin. Over-all, 28 per cent of the patients had one or more blood contact events that involved 293 operating room personnel. Risk of blood contact was significantly greater for cardiothoracic (p less than 0.001), trauma (p less than 0.003) and obstetric cesarean section (p less than 0.021) procedures when compared with all other procedures. Three services (Ophthalmology, Transplant and Oral Surgery) had no contact events. The remaining nine had rates ranging from 17 to 33 per cent. Eight per cent of the procedures (n = 54) resulted in blood exposure to 63 individuals. Percutaneous exposure occurred in 3 per cent of all procedures. Blood contact events increased with increasing operative time. Blood contact most commonly occurred among circulating nurses (n = 79), anesthesia personnel (n = 65), surgeons (n = 59) and first assistants (n = 49). Despite increased concerns over the risk of occupationally acquired viral diseases, blood contact and exposure continue to be frequent events. Surgeons must assume that all patients are potentially infected and should adopt universally applied standards of behavior to minimize contact with blood.\r"

  ".U": "91240454\r", 
  ".W": "Partial narrowing of arteries produces poststenotic dilatation. This appears as a dilation of the vessel wall 1 to 3 centimeters distal to the area of a partial stenosis. When a stenotic band is placed in dogs, poststenotic dilatation develops rapidly, often within eight to ten days. Moderate stenoses that produce a bruit and thrill are effective in eliciting poststenotic dilatation, whereas very tight and very mild stenoses usually are ineffective. Thus, development of poststenotic dilatation requires the presence of flow disturbances sufficient to produce an audible bruit and a palpable thrill. Although the exact flow disturbance is uncertain, statis, increased lateral pressure, cavitation, abnormal shear stresses and turbulence all have been postulated to be the cause of poststenotic dilatation. Of these, experimental studies support abnormal shear stresses and turbulence as the most likely causes. Whatever the flow disturbance, it must make the wall vibrate to produce poststenotic dilatation. Vibrations are thought to produce alterations in wall elastin and possibly in vascular smooth muscle tone. This leads to dilatation of the vessel. If the dilatation is slight, removal of the stenosis may cause reversal of poststenotic dilatation with recovery beginning within hours of correction of the stenosis. If the dilated area is enlarged to twice normal diameter, it may exhibit permanent aneurysmal changes and, therefore, requires resections with reanastomosis. Arteries that are dilated to as little as one-third more than normal size may contain areas of ulceration with overlying thrombus. These vessels also may require resection with reanastomosis.\r"

To determine whether lovastatin could prevent restenosis, between December 1987 and July 1988, a total of 157 patients undergoing successful PTCA were randomly and prospectively assigned to the lovastatin group or a control group. Seventy-nine patients received lovastatin (20 mg daily if the serum cholesterol level was less than 300 mg/dl and 40 mg daily if the serum cholesterol level was greater than or equal to 300 mg/dl) in addition to conventional therapy (lovastatin group). Seventy-eight patients received conventional therapy alone (control group). Fifty patients in the lovastatin group and 29 in the control group were evaluated with coronary angiography at an interval of 2 to 10 months (mean 4 months). The restenosis rate was evaluated according to the number of patients showing restenosis, the number of vessels restenosed, and the number of PTCA sites restenosed. Restenosis was defined as the presence of greater than 50% stenosis of the PTCA site. In the lovastatin group 6 of 50 patients (12%) had restenosis compared with 13 of 29 patients (44.4%) in the control group (p less than 0.001). When the number of vessels restenosed was considered, only 9 of 72 vessels (12.5%) restenosed in the lovastatin group compared with 13 of 34 vessels (38.2%) in the control group (p less than 0.002). Similarly, 10 of 80 (12.5%) PTCA sites restenosed in the lovastatin group compared with 15 of 36 (41.7%) in the control group (p less than 0.001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

This system can provide a beat-to-beat or gated determination of left ventricular ejection fraction and ST segment analysis. In 28 patients this miniaturized probe was correlated against a high resolution gamma camera study. Over a wide range of ejection fraction (31% to 76%) in patients with and without regional wall motion abnormalities, the correlation between the Cardioscint detector and the gamma camera was excellent (r = 0.94, SEE +/- 2.1). This detector system has high temporal (10 msec) resolution, and comparison of peak filling rate (PFR) and time to peak filling (TPFR) also showed close agreement with the gamma camera (PFR, r = 0.94, SEE +/- 0.17; TPFR, r = 0.92, SEE +/- 6.8). In 18 patients on bed rest the long-term stability of this system for measuring ejection fraction and ST segments was verified. During the monitoring period (108 +/- 28 minutes) only minor changes in ejection fraction occurred (coefficient of variation 0.035 +/- 0.016) and ST segment analysis showed no significant change from baseline. To determine whether continuous on-line measurement of ejection fraction would be useful after coronary angioplasty, 12 patients who had undergone a successful procedure were evaluated for 280 +/- 35 minutes with the Cardioscint system.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

When used initially in the United States, a single balloon, designed for peripheral arterial angioplasty, was passed across the intraatrial septum for mitral dilatation. The results were less than ideal, with resultant valve areas between 1.0 and 1.5 cm2. Double balloon dilatation was introduced and yielded valve areas between 1.5 and over 2.0 cm2. However, the double balloon technique is substantially more cumbersome, requires passage of two catheters through the atrial septum with an incidence of atrial septal defect, and results in significant hemodynamic sequelae during the procedure. This report describes a novel single balloon for PTMC. In contrast to the more conventionally used peripheral arterial balloons, this device was specifically designed for mitral stenosis. Results in 25 patients (mean age 60 +/- 5 years; range 29 to 87 years) showed an increase in value area from 0.9 +/- 0.2 cm2 to 1.6 +/- 0.5 cm2 (p less than 0.001). In contrast to the results reported with conventional balloon dilatation, there was no difference in the resultant valve area or in the incidence of complications among patients with more severely deformed valves compared with patients with more \"ideal\" valves for commissurotomy. An in vitro comparison of the pressure-volume characteristics of the conventional versus the Inoue balloon showed the latter to be more compliant, reaching nominal inflated diameter at 2.0 +/- 0.4 atm versus 3.3 +/- 0.5 atm for conventional balloons (p less than 0.005).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To test whether diastolic stretch modified ventricular repolarization, the change in the QT interval was determined in 15 patients who underwent percutaneous transluminal mitral commissurotomy (PTMC) for mitral stenosis. After successful PTMC, the QT interval was prolonged in five, shortened in two, and was unchanged in eight patients, but the mean QT interval in 15 patients did not change (406 +/- 31 msec versus 412 +/- 40 msec, p = NS). However, linear regression analysis revealed a strong correlation between changes in the QT interval and those in systemic vascular resistance (r = -0.83, p less than 0.01). These data indicated that changes in the QT interval after PTMC were small compared with those seen with valvuloplasty for pulmonary or aortic stenosis, and were dependent on afterload but not on preload.\r"

Heart rate, aortic pressure, and left anterior descending coronary artery cross-sectional area were measured before and for 60 minutes after each injection. Myocardial blood flow was measured with 15 microns radioactive microspheres at baseline and 30 minutes after administration of cocaine or saline solution. Plasma cocaine, benzoyl ecgonine, and norepinephrine concentrations were measured and correlated with physiologic changes. Cocaine caused sustained dose-dependent vasoconstriction of the left anterior descending coronary artery, which was significant at 15 minutes and maximum at 60 minutes (control = 2 +/- 10%; cocaine, 9 mg/kg = 46 +/- 10% cross-sectional area reduction). There was an immediate but transient reduction in aortic pressure and an elevation of heart rate after the 6 and 9 mg/kg doses and no hemodynamic changes with lower doses. Coronary blood flow was reduced 30 minutes after the 3, 6, and 9 mg/kg doses. Two dogs had refractory ventricular tachycardia after injection of cocaine and were not included in the analysis. Results of this investigation demonstrate angiographic evidence of dose-dependent, cocaine-induced epicardial coronary vasoconstriction and deleterious hemodynamic abnormalities at commonly used doses of cocaine. These results demonstrate a mechanism for the development of angina and myocardial infarction associated with cocaine use.\r"

  ".W": "Silent ischemia is common in diabetic patients with coronary heart disease. These patients may also have more subtle alteration in the perception of angina as reflected by prolongation of anginal perceptual threshold--the time from onset of 0.1 mV ST segment depression to the onset of chest pain during treadmill exercise. Silent ischemia may be associated with a generalized hyposensitivity to pain, although the pathophysiologic mechanism is obscure. The purpose of the present study was to determine whether diabetic patients with prolonged anginal perceptual thresholds are also hyposensitive to painful stimuli and to investigate whether this is associated with autonomic neuropathy. Nineteen diabetic and 25 nondiabetic patients with exertional angina were exercised on a treadmill to measure anginal perceptual threshold. Somatic pain threshold was measured by calf sphygmomanometry. The cuff was inflated rapidly until pain occurred, and six repeat inflations were done to test reproducibility. Because there was no significant difference between measurements (coefficient of variation = 0.156) the mean value for each patient provided a measure of somatic pain threshold. The diabetic group had a longer anginal perceptual threshold (138 +/- 64 seconds vs 34 +/- 51 seconds, p less than 0.001), which correlated positively with the somatic pain threshold (r = 0.5, p = 0.03); patients with more prolonged anginal perceptual thresholds tended to have higher somatic pain thresholds. In the diabetic group anginal perceptual (r = -0.3, p = NS) and somatic pain (r = -0.4, p = 0.05) thresholds tended to increase as the ratio of peak to minimal heart rate during the Valsalva maneuver fell below 1.21, but these variables were unrelated in the nondiabetic group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

A total of 70 patients with recent infarction underwent modified Bruce treadmill testing with simultaneous measurement of expired gases in the absence of antianginal agents including beta-antagonists. Among these, 31 patients who had at least one of the following abnormalities--ST depression greater than or equal to 1 mm (22 patients), chest pain (four patients), or treadmill time less than 360 seconds (12 patients)--were studied in a randomized double-blind fashion and received either placebo or 240 mg of propranolol/day. A total of 28 patients completed the randomized phase and were able to undergo repeat exercise testing an average of 3.4 +/- 1.8 days later. Randomized groups were equivalent at baseline except for a higher peak oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production (p less than 0.05) in the propranolol compared with the placebo group; these differences were taken into account in statistical analyses of the study data. Resting heart rate (59 +/- 1.2 versus 82 +/- 4.2 beats/min) and peak heart rate x systolic blood pressure (14,208 +/- 496 versus 20,075 +/- 1,062) were both significantly less (p less than 0.01) after propranolol than after placebo. Eight of nine patients treated with placebo maintained ST depression greater than or equal to 1 mm from the initial to the randomized exercise test, compared with only 4 of 13 receiving propranolol (p less than 0.01). In those with continued ST depression, time to positivity was significantly longer in those receiving propranolol compared with those taking placebo (538 +/- 73 versus 318 +/- 44 seconds, p less than 0.05). In contrast, the peak ratio between carbon dioxide production and oxygen consumption was higher in those receiving propranolol compared with those receiving placebo (0.93 +/- 0.04 versus 0.81 +/- 0.03, p less than 0.05). We conclude that propranolol therapy reduces evidence of ischemia and changes traditional estimates of potential cardiac risk derived from submaximal postinfarction exercise testing.\r"

Every patient underwent testing with three different exercise protocols: (1) Bruce (Bruce-standing recovery), (2) abrupt onset of exercise (abrupt), and (3) modified Bruce protocol preceded by a 10-minute warm-up period (warm-up). After exercise test patients recovered in a sitting position. In addition, all patients performed a fourth exercise (Bruce protocol), but this time they recovered in the supine position (Bruce-supine recovery). Time and heart rate-blood pressure product at 1 mm ST segment depression were similar for Bruce-standing recovery, abrupt, and Bruce-supine recovery protocols (5.1 +/- 2, 4.4 +/- 2, and 5.2 +/- 2 minutes and 20.8 +/- 4, 21.3 +/- 4, and 20.4 +/- 4 beats/min x mm Hg x 10(-3), respectively. Heart rate and heart rate-blood pressure product at peak exercise did not differ in Bruce-standing recovery, abrupt, and Bruce-supine recovery. Maximal ST segment depression was -2.0, -1.9, and -2.0 mm with Bruce-standing recovery, abrupt, and Bruce-supine recovery exercise, respectively, and -1.5 mm with warm-up exercise (p less than 0.05). Duration of ST segment depression into recovery was significantly prolonged after Bruce-supine recovery exercise (9.4 + 5 minutes) compared with Bruce-standing recovery, abrupt, and warm-up protocols (6.8 + 3, 5.9 + 4, and 5.0 + 3 minutes, respectively; p less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

A total of 114 patients undergoing evaluation for ventricular arrhythmias were enrolled in this protocol. Two consecutive SAECG's (40 Hz bidirectional high-pass filtering with a computer-automated system) were performed 10 minutes apart. Abnormal SAECG parameters were defined as (1) vector QRS duration more than 120 msec, (2) terminal root mean square (RMS) voltage less than 20 microV, and (3) low-amplitude signal (LAS) duration more than 40 msec. An SAECG was defined as abnormal if at least one vector parameter was abnormal. There was close correlation between vector parameters during the two SAECG observations: QRS duration had the highest reproducibility (r2 = 0.97, p less than 0.001) followed by terminal RMS voltage (r2 = 0.92, p less than 0.001), and LAS duration (r2 = 0.90, p less than 0.001). The mean (+/- SD) percentage of change between the two recordings was 2% +/- 2% of the QRS duration, 13% +/- 22% for terminal RMS voltage, and 7% +/- 11% for LAS duration. The reproducibility of an initially normal SAECG was 92% and of an initially abnormal SAECG, 96%. Seventeen patients (15%) had a change in one of the three vector parameters between the two recordings. There were no clinically significant differences between the 17 patients in whom the SAECG was nonreproducible and the 97 patients in whom the SAECG was reproducible. However, reproducibility was significantly higher in patients with an initially normal versus an initially abnormal SAECG (92% vs 76%, p = 0.03).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Multivariate analysis was performed to obtain the relatively important factor related to repetitive VPBs with the use of the following variables: age, redistribution, left ventricular ejection fraction, serum potassium and magnesium concentration, QRS score, left ventricular aneurysm, and the number of diseased vessels. Thirty-five patients had redistribution, but only three of them had repetitive VPBs during exercise testing. The average heart rate before 79% of 398 episodes of repetitive VPBs during ambulatory monitoring was in the range of 56 to 70/min. These data indicate that most of repetitive VPBs during ambulatory monitoring were not provoked by exercise-induced acute myocardial ischemia. However, redistribution was found to be an important factor associated with repetitive VPBs. The electrical abnormality relating to a substrate characterized by chronic reversible ischemia may explain the association between redistribution and repetitive VPBs.\r"

After short-term therapy, 62% of the patients had an adequate response to amiodarone. In 27 patients who were hemodynamically unstable, ventricular tachycardia was induced and became noninducible or hemodynamically stable after combination therapy with a class I agent. Among 18 patients who did not have inducible ventricular tachycardia after short-term therapy, eight (44%) had inducible, hemodynamically unstable ventricular tachycardia after long-term treatment with amiodarone. On the other hand, six of the 27 patients who had hemodynamically unstable ventricular tachycardia after short-term therapy had an adequate response after long-term treatment with amiodarone. Therefore an adequate electrophysiologic response after short-term therapy does not guarantee a similar response after long-term treatment, and an inadequate response after short-term therapy does not always predict a similar response after long-term therapy.\r"

  ".U": "91240939\r", 
  ".W": "The effects of pharmacologic modulation of vagal activity on ischemic ventricular tachycardia were evaluated in 21 conscious dogs after permanent left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) occlusion. Studies were done on spontaneous ventricular tachycardia (cycle length 383 +/- 100 msec, n = 21), 24 to 72 hours after LAD occlusion, and on inducible sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (cycle length 251 +/- 30 msec, n = 6), 4 to 7 days after LAD occlusion. Edrophonium (1 mg/kg intravenously), a cholinesterase inhibitor, and methacholine (0.1 to 1 mg intravenously), a muscarinic agonist, had no significant effect on the rate or QRS morphology of either type of tachycardia, despite severe slowing of the sinoatrial rate. Similarly, atropine (up to 60 micrograms/kg intravenously) had no effect on the rate and QRS morphology of either type of tachycardia. In an attempt to enhance myocardial drug delivery to the ischemic and infarcted left ventricle, edrophonium (1 mg/kg) and methacholine (0.1 to 0.2 mg) were injected retrogradely through the great cardiac vein. This did not impart any significant therapeutic advantage over the systemic intravenous route. Sympathetic beta blockade did not affect the therapeutic outcome (n = 5) with either edrophonium or methacholine. It is concluded that direct or indirect enhancement of cardiac vagal activity has no effect on ischemic ventricular tachycardia in this model of subacute myocardial infarction. The lack of efficacy appears to be independent of myocardial drug delivery to ischemic ventricular site(s) and background sympathetic activity. Such a lack of efficacy may be caused by ischemia-mediated degeneration of vagal nerve terminals, by altered responsiveness of muscarinic receptors at infarcted arrhythmogenic myocardial sites, or both.\r"

The purpose of this study was to describe a new sign permitting delineation of the mechanism of SVT by analysis of the P wave in lead V1 and the left atrial electrogram, which may be registered by the esophageal electrode. Among 146 patients with SVT, 72 had a ventriculoatrial interval greater than 70 msec. The P wave in lead V1 during SVT was discernible in 69 of them. The precession of the left atrial electrogram on the P wave in lead V1 was always associated with reentry through a left lateral (n = 37) or posteroseptal (n = 4) accessory atrioventricular (AV) connection. When the P wave in lead V1 preceded or occurred simultaneously with the left atrial electrogram, reentry was through either the AV node or a right-sided accessory AV connection. On the other hand, although the P wave in lead V1 was more frequently negative in reentry through a right-sided connection and positive in reentry through a left-sided connection, the polarity was not specific enough to identify the reentry. The precession of the left atrial electrogram recorded by the esophageal electrode on the P wave in lead V1 during SVT was a specific criterion of reentry through a left accessory AV connection, and this technique could be useful for preliminary localization of the accessory connection before electrophysiologic study.\r"

Mitochondria occupy a pivotal position in energy metabolism, and mitochondria have their own DNA, which encodes 13 subunits of the mitochondrial energy transducing system. Other subunits are encoded by nuclear DNA. DNA has been shown to have a high mutation rate, and genetic mutation might primarily be ascribed to mtDNA mutation in the energy transducing system. Recent advances in gene technology, especially in polymerase chain reactions (PCR), permit us to analyze mtDNA mutations in a small quantity of tissue. We devised rapid and accurate methods to detect mitochondrial mutations--the primer shift PCR method, PCR-Southern method, the modified primer shift PCR method, and the asymmetric PCR method. With these methods, we analyzed myocardia mtDNA in human cadavers of various ages (from 3 years old to 97 years old, mean 57 years old). The 7.4 kb deletion of mtDNA was commonly detected in elderly subjects, and the proportion of deleted mtDNA to normal mtDNA increased with age. Deleted mtDNA was observed in all subjects that were over 70 years old. The mutation was based on the directly repeated sequence: 5'-CATCAA-CAACCG-3', which exists in both the adenosine triphosphatase 6 gene and the displacement loop (D-loop) region. Replication impairment occurred at that directly repeated sequence, which caused the elimination of genomes between the adenosine triphosphatase 6 gene and the D-loop region and resulted in a 7.4 kb deletion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

For the left ventricular internal dimension, however, no genetic effect was found after correction for body weight. After appropriate adjustment a genetic component of 32% was found for aortic peak flow velocity, 55% for stroke distance, and 47% for minute distance. The early and late diastolic peak flow velocities at the mitral valve showed a genetic component estimated at 43% and 26%, respectively. The inheritance of the late/early diastolic peak flow velocity ratio was estimated at 53%. In conclusion, these data suggest a significant genetic component for left ventricular structural features but not for cavity dimension. A significant influence of heredity was detected for left ventricular inflow and outflow characteristics.\r"

A total of 39 patients with predominantly mitral (n = 22) or aortic (n = 17) regurgitation with (n = 13) and without (n = 26) myocardial disease and 10 normal volunteers were examined with cine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 1.5 T. Left ventricular (LV) cardiac output (CO) and peak systolic (PS) wall stress (WS) and end-systolic (ES) WS were calculated from blood pressure recordings, carotid pulse tracings, and wall thickness (h) and diameter (D) measurements obtained from cine MRI. Patients were classified into three degrees of severity according to their LV regurgitant volume (RV). Myocardial disease was defined by an ejection fraction (EF) of less than 40%. Mean LV EF was 61 +/- 3% in normal volunteers, 64 +/- 3% in patients with regurgitation, and 25 +/- 2% in patients with myocardial disease. LV CO was directly related to RV in patients without myocardial disease, whereas it was disproportionately low in relation to RV in patients with myocardial disease. PS WS was significantly higher in severe mitral and/or aortic regurgitation compared with moderate, mild, and no mitral and/or aortic regurgitation. Compared with the degree of regurgitation, PS WS was disproportionately higher in patients with myocardial disease. Thus LV CO and WS rise progressively with increasing severity of regurgitation. Disproportionately high systolic WS relative to RV indicates the presence of myocardial disease.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "To examine changes in diastolic left ventricular filling during the development of left ventricular hypertrophy, serial pulsed Doppler echocardiographic studies were performed in a canine model of left ventricular hypertrophy induced by neurogenic pressor episodes. This model is unique since left ventricular hypertrophy develops without sustained hypertension. The neurogenic pressor episodes produced progressive increases in left ventricular mass of 17% by 3 weeks (p less than 0.03) and 23% by 9 weeks (p less than 0.001). During the course of hypertrophy development, there were no changes in resting heart rate, blood pressure, left ventricular volumes or ejection fraction, or end-systolic wall stress. However, peak early filling (peak E) velocity decreased from 65 +/- 5 cm/sec to 53 +/- 4 cm/sec by 3 weeks (p less than 0.05) and remained depressed at 9 weeks. In addition, peak E/A (the ratio of early to late peak filling) decreased by 3 weeks (p less than 0.01) and the contribution of atrial filling to total left ventricular diastolic filling increased by 9 weeks (p less than 0.005). There were significant correlations between the changes in left ventricular mass and the change in peak E velocity at 3 weeks (r = -0.92, p less than 0.001) but not at 9 weeks. These data indicate that left ventricular filling abnormalities occur early in the course of the development of left ventricular hypertrophy, are not a result of loading alterations related to sustained hypertension, and do not change significantly following increasing stages of hypertrophy.\r"

  ".W": "Increased systemic vascular resistance and contracted blood volume are characteristic findings in preeclampsia. These alterations in cardiovascular hemodynamics can adversely affect ejection phase indices of left ventricular performance making it difficult to separate abnormalities resulting from changes in load from those caused by depressed myocardial contractility. To address this issue the contractility-sensitive, load-independent relationship between left ventricular end-systolic wall stress and rate-corrected velocity of fiber shortening was assessed in 10 nulliparous patients with preeclampsia. Comparisons were made with data obtained from 10 age-matched normotensive women with uncomplicated pregnancies (control subjects). Studies were performed by means of two-dimensionally targeted M-mode echocardiography and calibrated carotid pulse tracings during early labor, 1 day after delivery, and 4 weeks after delivery. During early labor and 1 day after delivery, patients with preeclampsia had elevated blood pressure and increased total systemic resistance. These parameters returned to normal by 4 weeks after delivery. Before delivery and 24 hours after delivery, the patients with preeclampsia had lower overall left ventricular performance (as measured by cardiac output and rate-corrected velocity of fiber shortening) and higher left ventricular afterload (as measured by left ventricular end-systolic wall stress) when compared with control subjects. These differences were no longer present 4 weeks after delivery. Despite the time-related intergroup differences in hemodynamics, left ventricular contractility was similar between normotensive and preeclamptic subjects at all stages of the study. Thus when load is eliminated as a confounding variable, the decrements in overall left ventricular performance measured in patients with preeclampsia reflect a mechanically appropriate response to increased afterload rather than an abnormality in the ventricular contractile state.\r"

Left ventricular mean diameters at end diastole and at end systole prior to pregnancy (5.2 +/- 0.3 and 3.0 +/- 0.2 cm, respectively) did not change during pregnancy (5.2 +/- 0.3 and 3.1 +/- 0.2 cm). Similarly, left ventricular fractional shortening did not alter significantly during pregnancy or postpartum. Furthermore, no patient developed any symptoms or signs of left ventricular failure. All patients had normal babies, including one who had twins. We conclude that PPCM patients whose left ventricular function returns to normal may undertake further pregnancy with a normal fetal outcome and a low risk of recurrent left ventricular dysfunction.\r"

Pseudoaneurysms, which result from extravasation of blood into the mediastinum, most commonly occur at the site of aortotomy or aortic cannulation. Infection may play an important role. Dissecting aneurysms after cardiac surgery usually occur at the site of aortic incision or cross clamping, especially in atherosclerotic aortas. Both conditions may be clinically silent but more frequently are seen with significant symptoms. Noninvasive techniques including CT scan, MRI, and echocardiography are very useful in the diagnosis of both complications, with contrast aortography remaining the definitive method. Surgical repair is necessary for dissecting aneurysms and for enlarging and symptomatic pseudoaneurysms, with improving morbidity and mortality.\r"

  ".U": "91240950\r", 
  ".W": "Left atrial ball thrombus is an infrequent clinical syndrome, which can have a catastrophic outcome but can be readily treated when recognized. It is usually a complication of long-standing rheumatic mitral stenosis. Symptomatic presentation is variable: fragmentation of the thrombus followed by peripheral embolization will produce ischemia or infarction of myocardium, brain, viscera, or extremities; random, intermittent, partial, or total occlusion of the mitral valve orifice may cause syncope, pulmonary congestion, and occasionally sudden death in other patients. Embolic and obstructive phenomena may also occur together. Cardiac physical findings usually suggest mitral stenosis; variability in the intensity of the diastolic rumble is common. Two-dimensional echocardiography is the gold standard for identifying ball thrombus. Cardiac catheterization provides assessment of coronary artery status when needed. The outcome of untreated ball thrombus is unlikely to be favorable. The results of anticoagulation and thrombolysis are unpredictable and potentially as harmful as no treatment at all. Current evidence although scant suggests that prompt surgical removal of the free thrombus, often in conjunction with mitral valve repair or replacement, is the appropriate therapeutic course in most patients.\r"

  ".W": "The feasibility of percutaneous translumial angioscopy of the cardiac valves was examined in eight patients with and in 11 patients without valvular disease. In eight of these patients, a guiding balloon catheter (9F) was introduced into the aortic root, a guide wire (0.014 or 0.025 inch) was introduced through the catheter into the left ventricle to prevent dislocation of the catheter, and a fiberscope (1.6 or 4.6F) was advanced to the distal tip of the catheter. The balloon was then inflated with carbon dioxide and was manipulated against the aortic valve; a body temperature heparinized saline was infused through the catheter for observation. Similarly, the balloon catheter was advanced transseptally into the left atrium for observation of the mitral valve in four patients. Also, the balloon catheter was advanced through the right femoral vein into the right atrium for observation of the tricupid valve in three patients. In patients with a normal aortic valve, the aortic cusp surface was smooth and white and the edges were sharp. They opened briskly during systole and coapted each other completely during diastole. In rheumatic aortic regurgitation, the cuspus were thick and blunt and their coaptation insufficiency was observed during diastole. In a patient with rheumatic AS, globular and yellow cusps were observed. Mitral valve leaflets were smooth and white in a patients without mitral valvular disease, while the leaflets were yellow, thick and irregular, and blood regurgitation from the left ventricle into the left atrium could be observed in two patients with rheumatic MSR. The process of opening and closure of a tricuspid valve was also observed in three patients without tricuspid valvular disease.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

A recently described \"buttoned\" device developed by Sideris et al. that can be delivered across the ductus via a 7F sheath had undergone successful trials in animal models. Because of the ease of device implantation and the requirement for a smaller-sized sheath for delivery than that used with other devices, we have used this custom-made double-disc device in a 5-year-old child and have shown successful closure of the ductus by angiography and by color Doppler studies. Further clinical trials with this device seem warranted.\r"

  ".W": "Phosphodiesterase inhibitors that are selective for cAMP-specific cardiac and vascular PDE III comprise a new group of agents for the treatment of heart failure, which at present are limited to clinical shortterm intravenous use and research uses only. Although both intravenous amrinone and milrinone are FDA approved, only amrinone is available for general clinical use. Selective phosphodiesterase inhibition produces beneficial actions of positive inotropy and peripheral vasodilation that result from increased cardiac and vascular muscle concentrations of intracellular cAMP and ionic calcium. In addition, a positive lusitropic action (enhancement of cardiac relaxation) has been observed. Neither beta-adrenergic agonist activity nor inhibition of the sodium-potassium ATPase is produced by these agents. The magnitude of hemodynamic improvement generally exceeds that of the cardiac glycosides and is comparable with that of intravenous catecholamines such as dobutamine. The different pharmacodynamic profile of the PDE inhibitors is additive to the effects of cardiac glycosides, complementary and synergistic to the actions of catecholamines, and has been shown to have favorable effects on coronary hemodynamics. As a result there is continued enthusiasm for the short-term intravenous use of amrinone and potentially milrinone in the setting of acute heart failure resulting from systolic dysfunction (after myocardial infarction, open heart surgery, or infectious or toxic myocarditis), heart failure resulting from right ventricular systolic dysfunction, and when patients with severe heart failure await cardiac transplantation. Initiation of treatment with an intravenous bolus followed by a maintenance infusion provides prompt increases in stroke volume and cardiac output and simultaneous reductions in right and left ventricular filling pressures and systemic vascular resistance.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

These agents inhibit the intracellular hydrolysis of cyclic adenosine monophosphate, thereby promoting cyclic adenosine monophosphate--catalyzed phosphorylation of sarcolemmal calcium channels and activating the calcium pump. They have a wider therapeutic index than do the cardiac glycosides. They also have vasodilator and lusitropic actions and are devoid of the central stimulant actions that narrow the therapeutic index of theophylline and other methylxanthines. Receptor down-regulation, which curtails the inotropic efficacy of beta-adrenoreceptor agonists, does not compromise the efficacy of phosphodiesterase inhibitors. The effectiveness of these new agents is, however, dependent on some degree of basal adenylate cyclase activity.\r"

  ".W": "The myocardial effects of milrinone are mediated through inhibition of myocardial phosphodiesterase III. This inhibition results in accumulation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate and consequently increased calcium influx through voltage-dependent channels. The vascular effects also result from increased cyclic adenosine monophosphate. Direct coronary artery infusion of milrinone causes a concentration-related increase in left ventricular +dP/dt and substantial improvement in pump function as indicated by increased stroke work at lower left ventricular end-diastolic pressures. Subsequent intravenous administration of milrinone produces additional hemodynamic improvement, which is associated with a further reduction in systemic vascular resistance and left and right heart filling pressures. There is also a downward displacement of the left ventricular pressure-volume curve and acceleration of isovolumic relaxation, findings which indicate improved diastolic filling and accelerated isovolumic myocardial relaxation, respectively. The former action may reflect unloading of the right ventricle, whereas the latter may be due to improved calcium reuptake in the myocardium. Myocardial oxygen demand is unaltered because peripheral vasodilatation reduces wall stress and counteracts the increased oxygen requirement necessary to support enhanced contractility. This therapeutic profile differs from that of inotropic agents such as dobutamine and vasodilators such as nitroprusside, and contributes significantly to the usefulness of phosphodiesterase III inhibitors such as milrinone in the short-term management of patients with heart failure.\r"

Deductions about venous tone from standard hemodynamic studies may be misleading since filling pressures may be reduced by improved left ventricular function. To study the venodilator properties of drugs, we have modified a radionuclide blood pool method and shown that venous volume is increased by 10% after glyceryl trinitrate but is unchanged after the arteriolar dilator hydralazine. In patients with congestive cardiac failure, the calcium channel blocker, felodipine, causes a marked reduction in systemic vascular resistance and left ventricular filling pressures, but venous volume remains unchanged. In a similar group of patients comparable arterial and central effects are seen after the administration of captopril, but venous volume increases by 16%, and this increased venous volume is sustained after 3 months of long-term treatment. Milrinone has been used to treat both acute and chronic heart failure. As expected of a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, it exhibits inotropic properties in animals and humans and also causes arterial vasodilatation. We have studied its effects on venous tone in 10 patients with severe heart failure (New York Heart Association classes III to IV). Milrinone was given intravenously at a loading dose of 50 micrograms/kg followed by an infusion of 0.5 micrograms/kg/min. After treatment, cardiac index, which was measured by thermodilution, increased from 1.8 +/- 0.48 to 2.3 +/- 0.65 L/min/m2 (p less than 0.001); pulmonary artery wedge pressure fell from 23 +/- 6 to 11 +/- 5 mm Hg (p less than 0.001); and systemic vascular resistance index decreased from 4296 to 3168 dynes.sec.cm-5/m2 (p less than 0.001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Bipyridine derivatives have recently been introduced as a new class of inodilator drugs in the intravenous therapy of heart failure. A member of this class is milrinone, which improves the inotropic state and reduces ventricular afterload, leading to improved hemodynamics. Because systolic and diastolic function are intimately related, it can be expected that the diastolic muscle properties are influenced by changes in systolic function and therefore by milrinone therapy. Since end-diastolic pressure may shift as a result of a change in ventricular volume alone, a complete left ventricular diastolic pressure volume (LVDPV) relationship must always be measured before one can make firm conclusions regarding changes in diastolic function. After a LVDPV relationship is obtained, one should identify the variables that can modify this relationship without directly affecting the intrinsic diastolic muscle properties. These variables can be divided into static effects (coronary vascular bed volume, right ventricular pressure, and pericardial pressure) and dynamic effects (viscoelasticity and myocardial active relaxation). Increments in coronary perfusion pressure of perfusion flow (vascular bed volume) are known to stiffen the cardiac wall (turgor effect). Changes in right ventricular pressure or pericardial pressure are other factors affecting the LVDPV relationship by changing transmural pressure. This effect is more pronounced when the ventricle is already stiff, such as in patients with myocardial hypertrophy. Dynamic effects become important when a LVDPV relationship is measured during isolated cardiac cycles; they include viscoelasticity and abnormal myocardial relaxation. Clinical assessment of diastolic cardiac performance assumes a model in which the heart is considered an elastic body (while in fact it is viscoelastic).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The response of patients with chronic severe heart failure to extended infusions (greater than or equal to 48 hours) of milrinone was evaluated in a multicenter, baseline-controlled, phase III efficacy and safety trial in 189 patients in the United States. Milrinone was given as loading and maintenance infusions according to one of four dose regimens. An effective response was defined as greater than or equal to 20% increases in cardiac index or decreases in pulmonary wedge pressure. All loading doses (range, 37.5 to 75 micrograms/kg/10 min) were effective short term, and maximum response occurred at 15 minutes. For the three effective regimens, cardiac index increased initially (at 15 minutes) by 24% to 42%, and pulmonary wedge pressure decreased by 24% to 33%. Systemic vascular resistance was reduced by 15% to 31%. The maximal acute response was effective in 99% of individual patients. During maintenance therapy, effective responses were seen at infusion doses of 0.375, 0.50, and 0.75 micrograms/kg/min, whereas an infusion of 0.25 micrograms/kg/min was ineffective. During 2 days of maintenance therapy, cardiac index remained augmented by 34% to 39% for the low and intermediate doses and by 44% to 73% for the high-dose infusion regimen. Pulmonary wedge pressure decreased an average of 18% on day 1 and 30% on day 2. Systemic vascular resistance was reduced by 20% to 25%, and stroke work index was augmented by 21% to 58%. Symptomatic improvement was common during intravenous milrinone therapy for symptoms of dyspnea (61% response), orthopnea (63%), edema (62%), and fatigue (40%). Improvement occurred more frequently in those with worse baseline functional indexes and in those with greater hemodynamic responses to therapy. Safety and tolerance were exceptionally good for these patients with advanced heart failure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

A subgroup (n = 18) with severe cardiac pump dysfunction and three patients in cardiogenic shock were analyzed separately; their hemodynamic response was compared with that of the total group (n = 40). After 15 minutes of intravenous therapy with milrinone, the total group (n = 40) showed an increase of 65% in cardiac index; in the subgroup (n = 18) cardiac index increased by 94% after 15 minutes and by 106% after 30 minutes. Likewise, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure decreased after 30 minutes in both the total group (n = 40) and the subgroup (n = 18). The heart rate showed an overall tendency to decrease. The systolic blood pressure tended upward and remained statistically unchanged in the total group, whereas in the subgroup in which pressure was initially low, there was an increase in the systolic pressure after 1 hour and a further increase after 24 hours. Mean arterial pressure also rose in this subgroup. The early improvement in all measured hemodynamic parameters was sustained throughout the 24-hour infusion period. Development of tolerance was not observed, nor were any clinically symptomatic side effects or symptomatic arrhythmias. Thus intravenous milrinone is a safe medication for the rapid and prolonged improvement in hemodynamics, specifically in patients with severely restricted cardiac pumping function.\r"

Phosphodiesterase III inhibitors work independent of adrenoreceptor activity and plasma catecholamine levels; thus these agents are likely to be more effective in the treatment of severe heart failure. The present study compares both the initial and late hemodynamic effects of dobutamine and milrinone during sequentially administered 24-hour infusions. Twenty patients with severe heart failure (New York Heart Association class III, n = 4; New York Heart Association class IV, n = 16) were investigated. Dobutamine could be administered at the prescribed maximum dose of 15 micrograms/kg/min for 24 hours in only 15 of 20 patients. In three patients the dose was reduced or dobutamine infusion completely stopped because of a drug-related increase in heart rate greater than 140 beats/min. Another 2 of 20 patients showed no hemodynamic improvement over 3 hours at the maximum dose of 15 micrograms/kg/min. Dobutamine administration was also discontinued in these patients on account of the existing unfavorable hemodynamic condition, and therapy with intravenous milrinone was started. All 20 patients responded to milrinone without side effects, although comparison of the hemodynamic effects during a 24-hour infusion was possible in only 15 patients. The 15 patients studied over both observation periods experienced an increase in heart rate from 88.8 to 105.6 beats/min (+ 1 hour; p less than or equal to 0.001) when receiving dobutamine but had no increase with milrinone. Stroke volume increased during dobutamine infusion from 19.3 to 28.9 ml/m2 (+49.6%) after 1 hour and then fell continuously to 25.2 ml/m2 after 12 hours; during milrinone therapy, stroke volume increased from 18.8 to 31.2 ml/m2 (+66%; p less than or equal to 0.001) and remained at this level until the end of the infusion (30.2 ml/m2). Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) decreased (p less than or equal to 0.001) immediately during milrinone therapy from 26.5 to 16.2 mm Hg after 30 minutes and stabilized at 20.1 mm Hg after 24 hours. During dobutamine infusion PCWP showed a delayed decrease from 27.8 to 19.0 mm Hg after 6 hours and subsequently rose to 22.7 mm Hg after 24 hours.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Patients received milrinone by loading dose (50 micrograms/kg over a 10-minute period), followed by a continuous infusion of either 0.375, 0.5, or 0.75 micrograms/kg/min (low-, middle-, and high-dose groups, respectively) given for a minimum of 12 hours. Patients were allocated to each dosage group sequentially, not randomly. Hemodynamic measurements were made before the loading dose and at 15, 30, 45, and 60 minutes, 3, 6, and 12 hours after the start of milrinone therapy. Further measurements were made at 2 and 4 hours after treatment was stopped. Milrinone therapy was associated with a rapid, well-sustained, and highly significant increase in cardiac index in all three dose groups (p less than 0.001), and a similar fall occurred in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure in all groups (p less than 0.001). Significant increases occurred in heart rate in all three groups (p less than 0.001). Systemic and pulmonary vascular resistance also fell significantly, although changes in this latter parameter were less predictable and more dose dependent. Few serious treatment-related adverse effects were seen. We conclude that intravenous milrinone is an effective and safe therapy for the treatment of low output states after cardiac surgery.\r"

Although dipyridamole has traditionally been used for this purpose, there are several compelling reasons why adenosine may be a preferable agent. First, dipyridamole acts by blocking the reuptake and transport of adenosine, which is the effective substance responsible for coronary vasodilation. Second, exogenous adenosine has a very short half-life (less than 2 seconds), which explains its very short duration of action as well as the brief, self-limiting duration of its side effects. Third, the adenosine infusion is controllable and may be increased or decreased as desired. Fourth, the coronary vasodilation induced by the doses of adenosine we recommend (140 micrograms/kg/min) may be more profound than that induced by the standard dipyridamole dose. Our experience to date, with nearly 1,000 patients studied, shows the adenosine thallium-201 test to be practical and well tolerated, with high sensitivity (87%) and specificity (94%) for detecting coronary artery disease.\r"

The quality of the thallium images is better or similar to that of exercise thallium images. The optimal dose of intravenous dipyridamole is 0.56 mg/kg and the optimal oral dose is 300-375 mg, although higher doses may be necessary in some patients. The sensitivity and specificity of dipyridamole-thallium imaging, whether intravenous or oral, have been shown in a number of studies to be quite adequate and comparable to that achieved during exercise thallium imaging.

To circumvent these limitations, two new myocardial perfusion imaging agents labeled with technetium-99m (99mTc) have been developed. They are Tc-sestamibi and Tc-teboroxime. Clinical trials of myocardial perfusion with both tracers have shown results similar to those obtained with 201Tl for detection of coronary artery disease. Results to date indicate that Tc-sestamibi accurately detects and locates myocardial infarction and can accurately assess both left and right ventricular ejection fractions by the first-pass technique. In addition, research has shown that rest-stress studies can be performed on the same day and that Tc-sestamibi can be used to assess the results of thrombolytic therapy. Tc-teboroxime has excellent myocardial tracer uptake characteristics but is cleared very rapidly from the myocardium. These features make Tc-teboroxime well suited to rapid serial studies. These new technetium myocardial perfusion agents have just become available for routine clinical use and are likely to replace 201Tl in many of its clinical applications.\r"

Quantification of blood flow based on tracer kinetic modeling yields blood flow values in close agreement with determinations provided by invasive procedures.

Over the last 8 years, our laboratory group has developed a catheter for measuring coronary blood flow velocity in humans, using the Doppler principle, and studied the effects of microvascular vasodilators. These studies have enabled us to measure coronary flow reserve in humans and to characterize some of the effects of focal and diffuse atherosclerosis on the coronary circulation.

  ".W": "Residual high-grade coronary stenosis and collateral flow are frequent findings in the chronic phase after a Q-wave acute myocardial infarction (AMI). The prognostic importance of a residual stenosis of the infarct artery and of collateral flow to the infarct area was analyzed in a group of 102 young patients (mean age 35 years, range 22 to 39) who had survived an anterior wall Q-wave AMI. Patients whose only significant lesion (greater than 50% luminal diameter reduction) was in the proximal portion of the left anterior descending artery were enrolled in the study. A 50 to 74% diameter stenosis was present in 33 of 102 patients (32%), 43 (42%) had a 75 to 99% stenosis and 26% had a total occlusion of the infarct vessel. Collateral vessels, which were evaluated by a scoring system, were present in 52 of 102 patients (51%). Four percent had only faint (score 1), 17 of 102 patients (17%) had moderate and 32 patients (31%) had good collateral flow (score greater than 4). The 8-year cumulative mortality was 15.2%--an eightfold increase compared with the age-matched general population. No patient with less than 75% stenosis died during follow-up, whereas the cumulative 8-year mortality was 23 and 17% in patients with a 75 to 99% stenosis or total occlusion, respectively (p less than 0.01). Patients with at least moderate collateral flow had a mortality rate of 21%, versus 8% for patients without or with faint collateral flow (p less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The pattern of oxygen (O2) consumption (VO2), carbon dioxide (CO2) production (VCO2), ventilatory and metabolic responses during and in recovery from supine bicycle exercise was examined in 18 patients with recent myocardial infarction. An increase in VO2 with increasing work load was accomplished by proportional increases in both cardiac output and the arteriovenous O2 difference. During recovery, however, the arteriovenous O2 difference rapidly decreased below levels at rest, whereas VO2 and cardiac output remained elevated, indicating that VO2 during recovery further depended on relatively high cardiac output. The ratio of VCO2 to VO2 further increased after exercise, suggesting that such cardiac output contributed to the remaining high CO2 flow to the lung and therefore enhanced ventilation. Increased arterial catecholamines during exercise remained elevated for the first 5 minutes of recovery. Arterial lactate during this period continued to increase and resulted in profound metabolic acidosis, causing alveolar hyperventilation after exercise. These results suggest that during recovery from exercise, cardiopulmonary responses remain enhanced because of continuing high cardiac output, resulting in subsequent high CO2 flow to the lung and metabolic acidosis, and that this may be associated with profound fatigue or dyspnea after exercise.\r"

Coronary angiography and electrophysiologic studies of the SN, both in the basal state and after pharmacologic autonomic blockade, were performed in 23 study patients (mean age 60 years) with SSS and a previous inferior wall AMI and in another 23 control patients (mean age 57 years) with normal sinus rate and a previous inferior AMI. Stenosis of the SN artery (or that proximal to its origin) greater than 50% was present in 13 study patients (56%) and in 8 control patients (34%) (p less than 0.05). In the study group, the intrinsic heart rate was abnormal in 5 of the 6 patients (83%) with severe SN artery stenosis (greater than or equal to 75% narrowing), in 3 of the 7 (43%) with moderate stenosis (50 to 75% narrowing) and in 3 of the 10 (30%) with insignificant stenosis (less than 50% narrowing). In the study group, the correlation between the SN measures (heart rate, corrected SN recovery time and sinoatrial conduction time) and the severity of SN artery stenosis was good after autonomic blockade (r between 0.59 and 0.64) and poor in the basal state. These data provide evidence for a role of SN artery disease in the pathogenesis of SSS in patients with an inferior wall AMI.\r"

The prevalence of these risk factors was markedly different than in the Framingham Offspring Study population, used here as a comparison group.

Most patients with CAD (97%) had greater than or equal to 1 additional risk factor. When the patients with CAD were divided by age groups (40 to 49 years [n = 109], 50 to 59 [n = 191]), no significant differences were observed in the prevalence of risk factors between the young and older patients.

  ".W": "Thallium-201 myocardial imaging during dipyridamole-induced coronary hyperemia has been an accepted method for diagnosing coronary artery disease (CAD) and risk stratification. Adenosine is a powerful short-acting coronary vasodilator. Initial results of thallium imaging during adenosine infusion have been encouraging. In 132 patients with CAD and in 16 patients with normal coronary angiograms, adenosine was given intravenously at a dose of 0.14 mg/kg/min for 6 minutes and thallium-201 was injected at 3 minutes. The thallium images using single-photon emission computed tomography were abnormal in 47 of the 54 patients (87%) with 1-vessel, in 34 of 37 patients (92%) with 2-vessel and in 40 of 41 patients (98%) with 3-vessel CAD. The sensitivity was 92% in the 132 patients with CAD (95% confidence intervals, 86 to 96%). In patients with normal coronary angiograms, 14 of 16 patients had normal thallium images (specificity, 88%; 95% confidence intervals, 59 to 100%). The results were very similar when subgroups of patients were analyzed: those without prior myocardial infarction, elderly patients and women. The nature of the perfusion defects (fixed or reversible) was assessed in relation to whether the 4-hour delayed images were obtained with or without the reinjection technique. In patients who underwent conventional delayed imaging, there were more fixed perfusion defects than in patients with reinjection delayed imaging (16 vs 0%, p less than 0.0001). The adverse effects were mild, transient and well tolerated. Thus, adenosine thallium tomographic imaging provides a high degree of accuracy in the diagnosis of CAD. The use of the reinjection technique enhances the ability to detect reversible defects.\r"

While abstaining from antianginal therapy, all 53 patients underwent coronary arteriography before and after 1 mg of intracoronary isosorbide dinitrate and 21 of the 53 also before and after 20 to 30 micrograms intracoronary ergonovine.

  ".W": "To determine the correlation of quantitative assessment of coronary narrowings with left ventricular functional impairment induced by exercise, 57 patients with 1-vessel coronary artery disease and without evidence of collateral flow were studied. A significant relation was observed between minimal cross-sectional area, percent area stenosis, minimal lumen diameter, percent diameter stenosis and the percentage of segmental area change from rest to peak exercise in a vascular distribution territory (r = 0.76, p less than 0.001; r = -0.55, p less than 0.001; r = 0.56, p less than 0.001; r = -0.75, p less than 0.001, respectively). For minimal cross-sectional area, the best cut-off value to separate significantly patients who had a decrease in contractility at peak exercise testing from those who had a normal response was 2 mm2 (p less than 0.001); for percent cross-sectional area stenosis, it was 75% (p less than 0.001); for minimal lumen diameter, it was 0.7 mm (p less than 0.001); and, for percent diameter stenosis, it was 85% (p less than 0.001). High cut-off values for angiographic variables are necessary to separate significantly patients who have a decrease in contractility at peak exercise testing from those who have a normal response. Several patients with mild coronary stenoses may have either normal or abnormal wall motion during exercise. Thus, exercise echocardiography is a useful tool in detecting the presence of fairly severe anatomic narrowing, whereas it is of limited clinical use in the assessment of intermediate coronary atherosclerotic lesions.\r"

Coronary artery spasm was documented during coronary angiography in 6 patients (left anterior descending artery, 3; right coronary artery, 2; left circumflex, 1). In the remaining 6 patients, coronary artery spasm was documented by a positive methylergometrine test performed at the bedside, which provoked ST-segment elevation in the inferior (n = 3), anterior (n = 1) or lateral (n = 2) leads. Ninety minutes after administration of the study medication, methylergometrine testing was performed at the bedside, using incremental doses of up to 0.4 mg of methylergometrine. After molsidomine, 10 patients (83%) had a negative and 2 had a positive test; after nifedipine, 9 patients (75%) had a negative and 3 a positive test. Only 1 patient had a methylergometrine test that remained positive after either molsidomine or nifedipine. Therefore, molsidomine appears as effective as nifedipine in suppressing methylergometrine-induced coronary artery spasm in patients with variant angina. In addition, patients not responding to 1 of the study medications may respond to the other.\r"

After an echocardiogram at rest was obtained, each patient performed maximal, symptom-limited, upright treadmill exercise, immediately after which repeat imaging was performed. The exercise echocardiogram was abnormal if any segment failed to become hypercontractile with exercise, and these regional wall motion abnormalities were used to predict the extent and distribution of coronary disease. At subsequent angiography, coronary stenosis was defined as significant if luminal diameter was reduced greater than or equal to 50%. Compared with electrocardiography, exercise echocardiography was more sensitive (97 vs 51%) and specific (64 vs 62%), and had higher positive (90 vs 82%) and negative (87 vs 28%) predictive accuracies. Exercise echocardiography was also highly predictive of the extent (no, 1-, 2- or 3-vessel disease) and distribution (which vessel) of coronary stenoses. It is concluded that exercise echocardiography is an excellent screening test for the presence, extent and distribution of coronary artery disease.\r"

Recently developed techniques allow continuous computerized digital analysis of ST segments that can be zeroed to the patient's own baseline electrocardiogram even if that baseline is abnormal conduction. With use of this technology, ST-segment changes during balloon coronary occlusion were compared in 10 patients with LBBB versus an age-, sex-, and coronary anatomy-matched population of 20 control subjects with normal baseline conduction. ST-segment deviation of greater than or equal to 1 mm from baseline was present in 80% of patients with LBBB and in 75% of control patients (difference not significant). There was no significant difference between patients with LBBB versus control patients in maximal ST-segment deviation (2.6 +/- 1.7 vs 2.0 +/- 1.0 mm) or in ST-segment deviation measured after 60 seconds of occlusion (2.4 +/- 1.3 vs 1.8 +/- 1.1 mm). ST-segment deviation reached 1 mm more quickly in patients with LBBB (33 +/- 11 seconds) than in control subjects (60 +/- 36 seconds) (p = 0.003). It is concluded that ST-segment analysis is feasible in patients with LBBB using digital self-referenced ST analysis and may provide important clinical information regarding the presence of myocardial ischemia.\r"

Histologic sections were taken at 5-mm intervals from the entire lengths of the right, left main, left anterior descending and left circumflex coronary arteries. With the use of a computerized morphometry system, analysis of the 4 major epicardial coronary arteries showed the major component of plaque to be a combination of cellular (mean percent total plaque area = 65%, standard error = 6%) and dense (19%, standard error = 6%) fibrous tissue. Arterial segments narrowed greater than 75% in cross-sectional area from these young women were compared with similarly narrowed arteries from 37 older patients (32 men [86%]) with fatal CAD previously reported by this laboratory, and showed significantly more cellular fibrous tissue and lipid-rich foam cells, and lesser amounts of dense fibrous and heavily calcified tissue. The large amount of lipid-containing foam cells and relative lack of acellular scar tissue in coronary plaques in these young women suggests a greater potential for reversibility of these plaques in this subset of patients with CAD.\r"

Analysis of composition according to the 4 degrees of luminal cross-sectional area narrowing revealed marked step-wise increases in pultaceous debris (from 0 +/- 0% at 0 to 25% narrowing to 18 +/- 22% at 76 to 100% narrowing, p = 0.0001) and calcific deposits (from 0 +/- 0 to 10 +/- 15%, p = 0.002), and decreases in fibrous tissue (from 99 +/- 3 to 71 +/- 23%, p = 0.0001) and area occupied by the media (from 35 +/- 8 to 16 +/- 8%, p = 0.0001).

Specimens of saphenous vein grafts were obtained from 7 necropsy patients who died at 4 days to 6 months after surgery. Monoclonal antibodies specific for smooth muscle cells (HHF35) and macrophages (HAM56) were used for analysis of the cell components. Migration of macrophages into the intima and the media was observed on the fourth postoperative day. Intimal thickening was characterized by the proliferation of smooth muscle cells, and scattered macrophages were present in the subendothelial layer 1 month after surgery. At 2 months, intimal thickening became prominent and macrophages were recognized circumferentially throughout the layer. At 5 to 6 months, some of the saphenous vein grafts were almost occluded by severe intimal thickening due to proliferation of the smooth muscle cells. Macrophages were also observed both inside and outside of the internal elastic lamina; these are rarely found in the artery. These results suggest that compared with the arterial graft, cytokinesia of the saphenous vein graft contributes to the development of early graft failure because of its rapidity in progression and severity.\r"

  ".W": "The electrophysiologic profile of the accessory pathway was studied in 17 patients (mean age +/- standard deviation 32 +/- 14 years) with Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome who were either lying down in a supine position, standing, or undergoing isometric or dynamic treadmill exercise. There were significant decreases in the PP interval after isometric exercise, standing and dynamic exercise (supine 764 +/- 224, standing 638 +/- 146, isometric 605 +/- 170, treadmill 455 +/- 86 ms; p less than 0.05). Both anterograde and retrograde accessory pathway refractory periods were measured after a constant drive of 400 ms during lying down supine, standing and isometric and treadmill exercise (Bruce protocol stage II). There was no significant decrease in the anterograde accessory pathway refractory period during isometric exercise (lying down 265 +/- 22 to isometric exercise 256 +/- 13 ms, p less than 0.05), but there were significant decreases (p less than 0.05) during standing (246 +/- 24 ms) and treadmill exercise (235 +/- 17 ms). The retrograde accessory pathway refractory period also showed a significant decrease (supine 272 +/- 16, isometric 267 +/- 23, standing 249 +/- 15, treadmill 237 +/- 17 ms; p less than 0.05). The relative change in refractory periods was greater when patients changed from lying down to standing than when they changed from standing to treadmill exercise, despite obvious higher adrenergic neuronal activities during exercise. These findings suggest that testing the accessory pathway during free standing can give a reliable indication of the sensitivity of the accessory pathway to sympathetic stimulation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The relation between left ventricular (LV) filling variables measured by gated blood pool radionuclide ventriculography and clinical symptoms and survival was examined in 93 patients who had decreased LV systolic function. The diastolic data were not significantly associated with clinical symptoms. Time to peak filling rate, peak filling rate and ejection fraction were associated independently with survival free of cardiac death (chi-square = 7.74, 5.91 and 3.92, respectively, by stepwise Cox regression analysis). A short time to peak filling rate or increased peak filling rate was associated with decreased survival, whereas the opposite indicated a good prognosis. One-year Kaplan-Meier survival was 73 and 98% when time to peak filling rate was below or above the median value of 167 ms, respectively, 82 and 90% when peak filling rate was above or below the median value of 1.67 end-diastolic volumes per second, respectively, and 76 and 95% when LV ejection fraction was below or above the median value of 0.35, respectively. Thus, filling variables (time to peak filling rate and peak filling rate) measured by radionuclide ventriculography may be valuable in predicting survival in patients with decreased LV systolic function.\r"

  ".U": "91241024\r", 
  ".W": "The accuracy of transesophageal echocardiography was compared with that of transthoracic echocardiography in the detection of ruptured chordae tendineae (flail mitral leaflet) in 27 patients with mitral valve prolapse (MVP) who underwent valve repair or replacement for mitral regurgitation. Confirmation of the presence of ruptured chordae resulting in a flail leaflet was available at surgery in all cases. The echocardiographic studies were read blindly by 2 independent observers with any differences resolved by a third. Mean (+/- standard deviation) age was 63 +/- 13 years. Men (n = 20) outnumbered women (n = 7) (p less than 0.02), and tended to be younger (p = 0.06). Flail leaflets were identified in 20 of 27 patients. In 1 patient, both leaflets were involved and in the remaining 19 patients posterior leaflets (15 patients) were more frequently affected than anterior leaflets (4 patients). Transesophageal echocardiography correctly identified all 20 patients with flail leaflets, but 1 false positive study occurred among the 7 patients without a flail leaflet. In contrast, transthoracic echocardiography identified only 12 of 20 patients with flail leaflets, with no false positive studies. Transesophageal echocardiography was more accurate, correctly classifying 26 of 27 (96%) cases versus 19 of 27 (70%) by the transthoracic approach (p less than 0.01). This study suggests a higher incidence of chordal rupture to the posterior leaflet in patients with MVP and demonstrates improved accuracy of transesophageal over transthoracic echocardiography in the detection of flail leaflets.\r"

  ".W": "Seventy-one patients aged greater than or equal to 80 years (mean +/- standard deviation 82 +/- 2) with aortic stenosis or mixed stenosis and regurgitation underwent aortic valve replacement alone (n = 35, group 1) or in combination with a coronary artery bypass procedure without any other valve procedure (n = 36, group 2). Preoperatively, 91% had severe cardiac limitations (New York Heart Association class III or IV). Hospital mortality was 12.7% overall (9 of 71), 5.7% (2 of 35) for group 1 and 19.4% (7 of 36) for group 2. Perioperatively, 1 patient (1.4%) had a stroke. Survival from late cardiac death at 1 and 3 years was 98.2 and 95.5%, respectively, for all patients, 100% for patients who underwent isolated aortic valve replacement, and 96.3 and 91.2%, respectively, for patients who underwent aortic valve replacement plus coronary artery bypass. Eighty-three percent of surviving patients had marked symptomatic improvement. Freedom from all valve-related complications (thromboembolism, anticoagulant, endocarditis, reoperation or prosthetic failure) was 93.3 and 80.4% at 1 and 3 years, respectively. Thus, short- and long-term morbidity and mortality after aortic valve replacement for aortic stenosis in patients aged greater than or equal to 80 years are encouragingly low, although the addition of coronary artery bypass grafting increases short- and long-term mortality.\r"

This study was undertaken to assess the value of color Doppler flow imaging in 36 symptomatic mitral stenosis patients who subsequently underwent successful balloon mitral valvuloplasty by comparing the results to those obtained at cardiac catheterization. Color Doppler-guided conventional Doppler assessment agreed well with cardiac catheterization results in classifying mitral stenosis as mild, moderately severe and severe, both before and after valvuloplasty. Color Doppler was also useful in identifying patients who had moderate to severe mitral regurgitation before and after valvuloplasty. Color Doppler flow mapping was more sensitive than oximetry in the detection of iatrogenic atrial septal defects, which were noted in 25 patients. The defects of those patients with smaller defects by color Doppler (diameter less than 0.7 cm) or echocardiographic shunt volume less than 0.7 liters/min tended to close, usually within 6 months, as opposed to those with larger defects or higher shunt volumes, which tended to persist. Echocardiographic shunt volumes revealed a fair correlation with oximetric results.\r"

  ".W": "Although the Gorlin formula and the continuity equation are both used to calculate valvular areas in the clinical situation, there have been few comparisons of the 2 methods. Mathematically, it can be shown that both formulas are derived from similar hydrodynamic principles which basically give a measure of the physiologic or effective area occupied by flow. However, the Gorlin formula contains errors in formulation and incorporates a constant that purports to give a measure of the anatomic rather than of the effective area of the valve. If both formulas are applied to the same hemodynamic data from aortic and mitral bioprostheses studied in a pulse duplicator system, the Gorlin formula constantly yields results 1 to 2% higher than the continuity equation for aortic valves and 12 to 13% higher for mitral valves. For any given type and size of prosthesis, the areas calculated by either formula increase linearly in relation to increasing pressure and flow (up to 20% for aortic valves and up to 35% for mitral valves). It is concluded that the Gorlin formula and the continuity equation are both pressure- and flow-dependent and are primarily related to the effective area occupied by flow rather than to the anatomic area of the valve. The 2 methods yield consistently different results due to differences in mathematical formulation. Such factors are important to consider when interpreting valve area calculations clinically.\r"

Ejection fraction, heart rate, systemic blood pressure and oxygen saturation (ear oximetry) were measured. There were 6 male and 8 female patients. Mean age +/- standard error of the mean was 14.5 +/- 1.1 years (range 6.3 to 21.1). Eight patients (group 1) had systemic to pulmonary shunts placed as palliation 8.2 +/- 2.2 years before study and 6 patients (group II) had caval to pulmonary shunts placed 11.8 +/- 1.6 years previously. Ejection fraction at rest was 54 +/- 2% and an abnormal response to exercise (failure of ejection fraction to increase greater than or equal to 5% from rest to peak exercise) was found in 9 of 14 patients. When analyzed separately, ejection fraction at rest in group I was higher than in group II; however, this difference disappeared at peak exercise. There was a significant negative correlation between ejection fraction at peak exercise and the interval since palliative surgery, although it was not apparent at rest. These data suggest that ventricular function is compromised during exercise and that abnormal performance is influenced by long-standing volume overload. Importantly, this abnormal state is concealed at rest and the choice of palliative shunting procedure appears to have little effect on normalizing pump performance.\r"

  ".W": "Intraoperative echocardiography was performed by epicardial, 2-dimensional, low- and high-pulsed repetition frequency, continuous-wave Doppler and color flow mapping in 50 patients. Forty studies were performed before and 44 studies after cardiopulmonary bypass. Studies before cardiopulmonary bypass agreed with preoperative evaluation. After cardiopulmonary bypass, studies revealed that 11 of 25 patients who underwent repair of ventricular septal defects had residual ventricular septal defects, and 1 of 25 patients who underwent atrial septal repair had 1 residual atrial communication. One patient with a \"Swiss cheese\" ventricular septum underwent repeat cardiopulmonary bypass to close residual ventricular septal defects. The patient with a residual atrial communication required immediate reoperation because of a right to left shunt after a modified Fontan procedure. Eight of 10 remaining residual ventricular septal defects spontaneously closed 1 to 41 days after operation. Assessment of postcardiopulmonary bypass and postoperative valvular regurgitation in 21 valves revealed good correlation (p less than 0.01). However, 1 patient required reoperation for mitral valve replacement on the sixth postoperative day. The correlation was fair between postcardiopulmonary bypass and postoperative residual stenotic pressure gradients in 12 surgically repaired stenotic lesions. This study shows that little additional information is added to a comprehensive preoperative evaluation by precardiopulmonary bypass intraoperative echocardiography. Postcardiopulmonary bypass intraoperative echocardiography is useful in identifying residual shunts. Assessment of stenotic gradients and valvular regurgitation must be interpreted in light of a changing hemodynamic state.\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies have demonstrated substantial changes in Doppler-derived indexes of left ventricular (LV) diastolic function in response to changes in loading conditions. To assess the influence of autonomic reflexes on these indexes, 2-dimensional and Doppler echophonocardiography were performed in 8 normal male subjects before and during autonomic blockade (0.2 mg/kg of propranolol and 0.04 mg/kg of atropine, intravenously) in the supine, passive upright 80 degree tilt and passive leg-raised positions, and during supine isometric exercise. During autonomic blockade in the supine position, there were significant increases in transmitral peak late filling velocity (A) (mean +/- standard error of the mean +34 +/- 7%) and isovolumic relaxation time (+18 +/- 9%), and significant decreases in transmitral peak early filling velocity (E) (-20 +/- 7%), deceleration time (-35 +/- 7%) and E/A ratio (-40 +/- 5%). E/A ratio decreased from 2.0 +/- 0.1 to 1.2 +/- 0.1 with autonomic blockade. When either upright tilt or isometric handgrip exercise was combined with autonomic blockade, the pattern of diastolic filling became distinctly \"abnormal,\" with E/A ratio decreasing to 0.9 +/- 0.1. The effect of volume loading (increased end-diastolic volume and increased peak E) was seen in the legs-raised position only during autonomic blockade. It is concluded that autonomic blockade substantially alters the Doppler indexes of LV diastolic filling and modifies both hemodynamic response and Doppler indexes produced by positional changes and by isometric exercise.\r"

The technique was applied to 14 normal volunteers (8 females, 6 males) aged 24-94 y who underwent neutron inelastic scattering and neutron activation measurements for body carbon, nitrogen, and calcium. The initial results agree with other techniques. Unlike models that evaluate body fat by subtracting lean body mass from body weight, the TBC technique is not sensitive to assumptions on the composition of lean body; therefore, it is appropriate for studies of adults of any age and health condition.\r"

Body composition was estimated in 98 men and women aged 65-94 y by using a four-compartment model based on hydrodensitometry, 3H2O dilution, and dual-photon absorptiometry. These estimates were significantly different from those obtained by using Siri's two-compartment model. The differences were associated significantly (P less than 0.0001) with variation in the aqueous fraction of FFM. Equations for predicting body composition from anthropometry and resistance, when calibrated against two-compartment model estimates, retained these systematic errors. Equations predicting body composition in elderly people should be calibrated against estimates from multicompartment models that consider variability in FFM composition.\r"

The recommended procedures require identification and estimation of all major sources of variability and explanations of laboratory quality control procedures employed. Variance-components techniques are used to model the total variability and calculate a maximum percent error that provides an easily understandable measure of laboratory precision accounting for all sources of variability. This avoids ambiguities encountered when reporting an SD that may taken into account only a few of the potential sources of variability. Other proposed uses of the total-variability model include estimating precision of laboratory methods for various replication schemes and developing effective quality control-checking schemes. These procedures are demonstrated with an example of the analysis of alpha-tocopherol in human plasma by using high-performance liquid chromatography.\r"

The ratio of active to sedentary energy expenditure, an index of physical activity, was also negatively correlated with body weight and percent body fat (r = -0.74, P less than 0.002 and r = -0.61, P less than 0.02, respectively).

After weight gain or weight loss, all subjects maintained their new weights for 2-10 wk on the same corn-oil-formula diet. As hypothesized, there were minimal changes in the concentrations of 41 fatty acids identified in both abdominal and gluteal tissues after all dietary phases, and small site-specific differences in the levels of saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids were not altered. The largest change was a 15% decrease (P less than 0.05) in 18:3n-3 in both abdominal and gluteal tissues during weight loss, despite higher levels in the diet than in the baseline adipose tissue. This decrease occurred without coexisting decreases in 22:5n-3 and 22:6n-3, two elongase-desaturase products of 18:3n-3 that were not detectable in the diet.\r"

Longitudinal measurements also indicated a relationship between the proximity to menopause and the rate of loss of potassium. Total body potassium was significantly related to total body calcium and bone density of the spine, radius, and femoral neck. Total body fat was not related to any of these measurements. We found no evidence that adiposity plays a major role in protecting against bone loss.\r"

For maternal weight change, diet effects of near starvation are unequivocal. With chronic undernutrition or social deprivation, diet effects are inapparent or modest (conditional on pregnancy stage, diet supplement, and prepregnancy weight). For birth-weight change, diet effects of near starvation are likewise unequivocal and modest with chronic undernutrition or social deprivation. The complete causal sequence has been demonstrated only below a famine threshold. Outside famine, effects are modest (conditional on baseline nutrition, timing, and content of diets, possibly also on infant sex and energy expenditure). High-protein concentrations have produced adverse effects. Micronutrients and consequent fluid retention could have favorable effects. Diet effects on birth weight apparently bypass maternal weight change. Hence, to enhance birth weight, maternal diet appears to deserve more attention than does weight gain.\r"

Although the rate of preterm delivery was 30% lower in the intervention group (P less than 0.05), the rates of intrauterine growth retardation were similar in the two groups. Fetal mortality was slightly higher (14 vs 12 per 1000, NS), but early neonatal mortality was fivefold lower (3 vs 19 per 1000, P less than 0.06) in the intervention group. Maternal morbidity was significantly lower (P less than 0.05) in the intervention group. There was a trend towards lower infant morbidity in the intervention group.

Serum cholesterol fell from a prediet (baseline) value of 5.49 +/- 0.32 to 3.62 +/- 0.31 mmol/L (P less than 0.01) after 1-2 mo of VLCDs (nadir), after which it rose to 5.95 +/- 0.36 mmol/L (peak, P less than 0.01 compared with nadir and baseline) as weight loss continued. With weight maintenance, serum cholesterol fell to 4.92 +/- 0.34 mmol/L (P less than 0.05 compared with peak). Adipose cholesterol content did not change in peripheral (arm and leg) biopsy sites but rose significantly in abdominal adipose tissue with weight loss.

Rates of protein synthesis and degradation measured by an intragastric infusion of [1-13C]leucine, averaged 14.5 and 15.9 g protein.kg-1.d-1, some 50% higher than previously reported in older preterm infants and not correlated with nitrogen balance. The growth failure of these infants was not associated with inadequate overall rates of protein turnover, but appeared to reflect an influence of the insufficient energy and protein intakes on the high rates of protein turnover, inducing changes in protein balance in either direction through relatively small changes in protein synthesis and/or degradation.\r"

Two studies, both involving in vitro incubations with human fecal bacteria as inoculum, were conducted to assess fermentation of various fiber sources and to quantitate the SCFAs produced. In experiment 1, substrate fermentability based on total SCFA production ranked as follows: citrus pectin greater than soy fiber greater than sugarbeet fiber greater than pea fiber greater than oat fiber. Fermentation of soy fiber led to higher proportions of propionate and butyrate than did fermentation of other substrates. In experiment 2, fermentation of gum arabic, a mixture of arabic and guar, and apple pectin resulted in greater SCFA production than did fermentation of either oat fiber or corn bran. Fermentation of gums led to more propionate and butyrate production than did that of apple pectin. It may be possible to select fiber sources capable of supporting stipulated amounts of both total and individual SCFA production in the human colon.\r"

In this study the glucose and insulin responses to consuming 14.5 g of specifically prepared oat gum with 50 g glucose were compared with the response to guar gum with glucose and to glucose alone in nine healthy, fasting subjects. Plasma glucose and insulin increases after the glucose drink were greater than after both gum meals between 20 and 60 min (P less than 0.01). The responses to the two gum meals were nearly identical. These results establish that the more palatable oat gum lowers postprandial plasma glucose and insulin concentrations in humans and may be comparable with or of greater benefit than guar gum.\r"

No psyllium fiber or placebo was given at lunch, which allowed measurement of residual or second-meal effects. For meals eaten immediately after psyllium ingestion, maximum postprandial glucose elevation was reduced by 14% at breakfast and 20% at dinner relative to placebo. Postprandial serum insulin concentrations measured after breakfast were reduced by 12% relative to placebo. Second-meal effects after lunch showed a 31% reduction in postprandial glucose elevation relative to placebo. No significant differences in effects were noted between patients whose diabetes was controlled by diet alone and those whose diabetes was controlled by oral hypoglycemic drugs.

During depletion, excretion of pyridoxic acid rapidly adjusted to approximate the intake. Plasma pyridoxal phosphate concentrations at the end of the baseline, depletion, and supplementation periods were 81 +/- 51, 9 +/- 3, and 455 +/- 129 nmol/L, respectively, whereas muscle concentrations were 21 +/- 9, 20 +/- 4, and 25 +/- 7 nmol/g, respectively and total vitamin B-6 in muscle was 28 +/- 10, 27 +/- 4, and 35 +/- 10 nmol/g, respectively. These data provide further confirmation that the vitamin B-6 pools in skeletal muscle are resistant to depletion.

Changes in plasma BC concentrations ranged widely from -313 to 16,090 nmol/L (median 2721 nmol/L). Multivariate analysis revealed that the subject's plasma BC concentration before supplementation was the most important indicator of the amount of increase after supplementation. Nonsmokers, women, and leaner subjects all had larger increases in plasma concentrations although the statistical model could account for relatively little of the variability in subjects' plasma response to BC supplementation (R2 = 0.14). We conclude that between-subject variability in response to daily supplementation with oral BC is very large and that the best predictor of this response is the initial plasma BC concentration.\r"

Preincubation of cells with 5-fluorouracil (1-100 mumol/L) but not methotrexate (10-100 mumol/L) resulted in a significant decrease in the degree of suppression. The dUST performed on colonocytes from folate-deficient animals displayed less suppression than on colonocytes from folate-replete animals (P less than 0.05). The abnormal degree of suppression was corrected by adding 100 mumol folinic acid/L. There was a negative correlation between the degree of suppression and the folate concentration of the colonic epithelium (P less than 0.001). These data indicate that the dUST is useful for detecting folate deficiency in the colonic epithelium and may therefore be valuable in assessing a deficiency state localized to that epithelium.\r"

Exclusion of these same foods from the current diet (except for mango and papaya in older children) was associated with a two- to ninefold excess risk of xerophthalmia, adjusted for weaning influences. Xerophthalmic children aged less than 3 y were generally at higher risk of dietary imbalance than were older children. Xerophthalmia is associated with a chronic, infrequent consumption of key vitamin A foods from weaning through early childhood.\r"

Comparison of TPP response values indicated that there was no significant difference between groups. However, approximately 24% of the total population appeared to have less than adequate RBC thiamin on the basis of current standards for TPP response. Neither dietary intake nor reported previous alcohol intake was correlated with TPP response.

Serum concentrations of vitamin A, vitamin B-12, ascorbic acid, and folic acid and dialysate concentrations of ascorbic acid were determined. Thiamin and riboflavin were assessed by measuring erythrocyte enzyme activities. Vitamin B-6 was measured as plasma pyridoxal phosphate. Dietary vitamin intake was determined with weighed 3-d food records. The dialysis patients had significantly greater stores of vitamin A, thiamin, riboflavin, pyridoxal phosphate, and folic acid than did the control population (P less than or equal to 0.01). The patients' combined dietary and supplemental intake of all vitamins except ascorbic acid was also significantly greater than the intake of the control group (P less than 0.01). Vitamin supplementation is associated with normal or greater-than-normal values of water-soluble vitamins in pediatric patients receiving long-term peritoneal dialysis.\r"

In nine normal, elderly control subjects and eight elderly subjects with achlorhydria, 47Ca was ingested with three test meals: a low-fiber meal (0.5 g dietary fiber), a high-fiber meal (10.5 g), and a high-fiber meal with 120 mL of 0.1 mol HC/L. In control subjects calcium retention, measured in a whole-body counter, was 25.7 +/- 4.0% (mean +/- SD) with the low-fiber meal, 19.1 +/- 1.9% with the high-fiber meal (P less than 0.002 vs low fiber), and 18.9 +/- 3.3% with the high-fiber-plus-acid meal (P less than 0.002 vs low fiber, NS vs high fiber). Calcium absorption in achlorhydric subjects was not different from control subjects: 26.2 +/- 8.0% with low fiber, 19.6 +/- 4.1% with high fiber (P less than 0.04 vs low fiber), and 21.0 +/- 5.8% with high fiber plus acid (P less than 0.04 vs low fiber, NS vs high fiber). We conclude that, in humans, the reduction in calcium absorption with high fiber intake is unaffected by gastric pH.\r"

Self-reported weights at 50 y were equally accurate for both males and females; the mean reporting underestimate was -1.98 kg for males and -1.86 kg for females. Males' self reports at age 50 y were influenced by years of education (P less than 0.005) and current body size (P less than 0.0001) whereas females' were not.

When random-effect regression models were used, monthly changes in weight were inversely related to proportions of days in the month with fever and diarrhea and positively related to energy intake per kilogram body weight. Interestingly, weight changes did not vary with age in this interval. Estimates indicate that increasing energy intakes to the recommended World Health Organization level would have a significantly greater effect on weight gain than would the elimination of diarrhea and fever. With energy at recommended intake and diarrhea and fever prevalence as found in US children, weight gain is predicted to be near that of the international reference population. Therefore, interventions aimed at improving dietary intake may be as important as infection-control programs for improving growth of children in poor developing nations.\r"

Positivity was assessed through parent and patient interviews that included standard alcohol abuse screening instruments. Provider recognition was assessed through record review and physician interview. Of the 22 families screened positive, only one was so identified by the child's attending or resident physician. Positive and \"negative\" families were similar in most respects, although parents in positive families were more likely to report stress and sleeping problems and adolescents were more likely to report being troubled by a parent's drinking. The similarity of positive and negative families and the low pediatrician recognition rate suggest that alcohol problems are likely to go unnoticed without a conscious screening effort.\r"

Children older than 11 years had low dietary calcium intake; only 15% met the recommended dietary allowance for calcium (1200 mg daily). Dietary calcium intake was associated with bone mineral status. Children ingesting more than 1000 mg of calcium daily had higher bone mineral content than those ingesting less.

Babies born to mothers with hematologic problems or babies who themselves had any evidence of hematologic disorder, blood loss, or disorders that affect hematologic values, eg, asphyxia, were excluded from the reference population. Six hundred two newborns were included in the study; however, after exclusions, the final reference population was 550. A minimum of 50 babies were studied for each gestational age except for gestations of 24 and 25 weeks. For these two gestations, 27 and 21 babies were studied, respectively. The percentile curves should be useful as a guide to the normal range of these variables in babies, particularly those of Arab origin.\r"

Compared with the combination of maternal and newborn urine testing, meconium testing had an 82% positive predictive value (14/17) and a 91% negative predictive value (10/11). Collection of meconium is simpler and more reliable than collection of urine, and testing of meconium was easily incorporated into routine procedures at a busy commercial laboratory.

These initiatives have greatly improved the level of safety in transportation of nonhandicapped children. Despite these positive changes, the transportation needs of nonambulatory children have not been addressed. In addition, implementation of Public Law 99-457 will result in larger numbers of young children with motor impairments requiring transportation to preschool early intervention programs. This study sought to describe how safely children in wheelchairs are transported. Observations of subjects were made as they were transported by their families or agencies at a residential summer camp, a preschool program for children with developmental disabilities, and a school for children with cerebral palsy. A safety score system was developed based on laboratory studies conducted on wheelchair restraint systems. This observation tool described the position of the wheelchair in the vehicle, the occupant restraint system, and the wheelchair restraint system. These structured observations revealed inadequate safety measures. Comparisons of safety scores of subjects transported by families with those transported by agencies were not found to have statistically significant differences. The findings of this study demonstrate a gap between minimal safety standards in wheelchair transportation and actual observed practices. In an effort to promote safe transportation practices of children regardless of their developmental differences, we present guidelines for health care providers for monitoring safe wheelchair practices in family, school, and community settings.\r"

A family history of hypertension was positively associated with elevated blood pressures in 46 (80.7%) of 57 subjects compared with controls (23/410 [5.6%]). Consistent with previous studies, subjects with elevated blood pressures had a greater body weight (94.5 +/- 25.7 kg) compared with normotensive subjects (75.2 +/- 14.0 kg). Subjects with elevated blood pressures engaged in heavy resistance weight training (three times a week or more) more often (41/57 [71.9%]) than normotensive subjects (65/410 [15.8%]).

One matched subject with plumbism had grossly abnormal renal function and an elevated blood lead level of an unclear cause. Among the remaining 21 matched pairs, the risk of hypertension was significantly higher in subjects with plumbism (relative risk, 7.0; 95% confidence interval, 1.2 to 42.3). Mean adjusted creatinine clearance rates for subjects with plumbism, however, were significantly higher than those of controls and supranormal in comparison to rates predicted for sex and age. Subjects with plumbism had significantly lower hemoglobin concentrations and hematocrit readings than the controls. Blood lead and serum creatinine levels were low for both groups. These results suggest that survivors of childhood lead poisoning have an increased risk of clinically significant hypertension developing in the setting of supranormal creatinine clearance rates.\r"

Nine infants had ophthalmological abnormalities; these included strabismus, nystagmus, and/or hypoplastic optic discs. Six mothers used cocaine, one used cocaine and heroin, one used only heroin, one used amphetamine, and one used phenylpropanolamine. Each of these cerebral anomalies (agenesis of the corpus callosum, septo-optic dysplasia, schizencephaly, hydranencephaly, congenital hydrocephalus, porencephaly, and cerebral infarctions) can be attributed to insults at different stages of development. There appears to be a relationship between the time of prenatal drug exposure and the type of cerebral anomaly, evoking malformations, disruptions, or fetal strokes. Since many or possibly all of these anomalies are thought to have a vascular origin, it seems appropriate to implicate prenatal exposure to vasoactive drugs.\r"

Women were consecutively recruited from the prenatal clinics at Boston (Mass) City Hospital between 1984 and 1988 and were interviewed during the prenatal and postpartum period by trained bilingual interviewers. Urine specimens were collected at the time of each interview and were analyzed for marijuana and cocaine metabolites. Following delivery, one of five pediatricians who were \"blinded\" to the mothers' prenatal and drug history performed a physical examination and abstracted medical information, including the diagnosis of respiratory distress syndrome from the medical record. The study sample consisted of 33 infants born at 34 weeks' or less gestation who were appropriate for gestational age and not exposed to heroin or methadone prenatally. Eight of the mothers of these 33 infants used cocaine prenatally. One (12%) of eight cocaine-exposed infants was diagnosed as having respiratory distress syndrome compared with 13 infants (56%) not exposed to cocaine prenatally. Infants not exposed had an odds ratio of 8.9 (95% confidence interval: 0.9, 83.5) for respiratory distress syndrome compared with infants exposed to cocaine prenatally. When the analysis was controlled for prolonged rupture of membranes, black race, infant gender, or gestational age, the adjusted odds ratio was essentially unchanged. This preliminary observation of a decreased incidence of respiratory distress syndrome among premature infants prenatally exposed to cocaine appears to be biologically plausible and needs to be confirmed in future studies with larger numbers of subjects to control for potentially confounding variables.\r"

All families were consecutively ascertained through a single proband who was referred for diagnostic evaluation of a memory disorder. The results suggest that susceptibility to AD is determined, in part, by a major autosomal dominant allele with an additional multifactorial component. Single-locus, polygenic, sporadic, and no-transmission models, as well as recessive inheritance of the major effect, were significantly rejected. Excess transmission from the heterozygote was marginally significant and probably reflects the presence of phenocopies or perhaps the existence of two or more major loci for AD. The frequency of the AD susceptibility allele was estimated to be .038, but the major locus accounts for only 24% of the transmission variance, indicating a substantial role for other genetic and nongenetic mechanisms in the causation of AD.\r"

  ".W": "A genetic component in the etiology of Alzheimer disease (AD) has been supported by indirect evidence for several years, with autosomal dominant inheritance with age-dependent penetrance being suggested to explain the familial aggregation of affecteds. St. George Hyslop et al. reported linkage of familial AD (FAD) in four early-onset families (mean age at onset [M] less than 50 years). Subsequent studies have been inconsistent in their results; Goate et al. also reported positive lod scores. However, both Pericak-Vance et al.'s study of a series of mainly late-onset FAD families (M greater than 60 years) and Schellenberg et al.'s study failed to confirm linkage to chromosome 21 (CH21). These various studies suggest the possibility of genetic heterogeneity, with some families linked to CH21 and others unlocalized. Recently, St. George Hyslop et al. extended their analysis to include additional families. The extended analyses supported their earlier finding of linkage to CH21, while showing strong evidence of heterogeneity between early-onset (M less than 65 years) and late-onset (M greater than 60 years) FAD families. Because our families did not show linkage to CH21, we undertook a genomic search for an additional locus for FAD. Because of both the confounding factor of late age at onset of FAD and the lack of clear evidence of Mendelian transmission in some of our families, we employed the affected-pedigree-member (APM) method of linkage analysis as an initial screen for possible linkage. Using this method, we identified two regions suggesting linkage: the proximal long arm of chromosome 19 (CH19) and the CH21 region of FAD linkage reported by St. George Hyslop et al. Application of standard likelihood (LOD score) analysis to these data support the possibility of an FAD gene locate on CH19, particularly in the late-onset FAD families. These data further suggest genetic heterogeneity and delineate this region of CH19 as an area needing additional investigation in FAD.\r"

Despite some recent claims to the contrary, it is shown that testing multiple markers decreases the posterior false-positive rate among significant tests, rather than increasing it; this is true whether the trait of interest is simply monogenic or complex, or even if the genetic model is misspecified. However, if the true mode of inheritance is complex, or if the genetic model is misspecified, the power to obtain a significant result when linkage is present may be reduced, while the significance level is not, leading to an inflation of the posterior false-positive rate. Furthermore, the posterior false-positive rate increases with decreasing sample size and may be unacceptably high for very small samples. By contrast, testing multiple genetic models, by varying either mode-of-inheritance parameters or diagnostic categories, does lead to an inflation of the posterior false-positive rate. A conservative correction for this case is to subtract log10t from the obtained maximum lod score, where t different genetic and/or diagnostic models have been tested.\r"

Her mother carried a balanced reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 1 and 14 [46,XX,t(1;14) (q32;q32)]. Both of her parents were phenotypically normal. Molecular studies were carried out to determine the parental origin of chromosomes 1, 13, and 14 in the patient. Using probes for D14S13 and D14S22, we could show that the patient inherited both chromosomes 14 from her father and none from her mother. Similar studies using probes for chromosomes 1 (D1S76) and 13 (D13S37) loci showed the presence of both maternal and paternal alleles in the patient. Our findings indicate that paternal uniparental heterodisomy for chromosome 14 most likely accounts for the phenotypic abnormalities observed in our patient.

  ".W": "Three families presenting with X-linked recessive Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathies (CMT) were studied both clinically and genetically. The disease phenotype in family 1 was typical of CMT type 1, except for an infantile onset; two of five affected individuals were mentally retarded, and obligate-carrier females were unaffected. Families 2 and 3 showed distal atrophy with weakness, juvenile onset, and normal intelligence. Motor-nerve conduction velocities were significantly slowed, and electromyography data were consistent with denervation in affected CMT males in all three families. Thirty X-linked RFLPs were tested for linkage studies against the CMT disease loci. Family 1 showed tight linkage (recombination fraction [theta] = 0) to Xp22.2 markers DXS16, DXS143, and DXS43, with peak lod scores of 1.75, 1.78, and 2.04, respectively. A maximum lod score of 3.48 at DXS16 (theta = 0) was obtained by multipoint linkage analysis of the map DXS143-DXS16-DXS43. In families 2 and 3 there was suggestion of tight linkage (theta = 0) to Xq26 markers DXS86, DXS144, and DXS105, with peak lod scores of 2.29, 1.33, and 2.32, respectively. The combined maximum multipoint lod score of 1.81 at DXS144 (theta = 0) for these two families occurred in the map DXS10-DXS144-DXS51-DXS105-DXS15-DXS52++ +. A joint homogeneity analysis including both regions (Xp22.2 and Xq26-28) provided evidence against homogeneity (chi 2 = 9.12, P less than .005). No linkage to Xp11.12-q22 markers was observed, as was reported for X-linked dominant CMT and the Cowchock CMT variant. Also, the chromosomes 1 and 17 CMT loci were excluded by pairwise linkage analysis in all three families.\r"

However, after already having had such an offspring, a DM mother's risk increases to 20%-37%. The risks of 10% and 41%, respectively, calculated in this study are similar to the estimates in the literature. However, our data on clinical status of the mothers demonstrate that only women with multisystem effects of the disorder at the time of pregnancy and delivery are likely to have congenitally affected offspring. No heterozygous woman with polychromatic lens changes but no other clinically detectable multisystem involvement had a congenitally affected child. In addition, our data suggest that the chance of having a more severely affected child increases with greater severity of maternal disease. The findings of this study are relevant for genetic counseling, as the risk of having a congenitally affected child for women with classical manifestations of the disease is shown to be higher than predicted by the overall risk estimate for any heterozygous woman. We consider it appropriate to give these classically affected women risk figures which approach the recurrence risk given to mothers with congenitally affected children. However, the risk of having a congenitally affected child for heterozygous women with no multisystem involvement appears to be minimal. Our findings support the earlier proposed hypothesis of maternal metabolites acting on a heterozygous offspring. Neither genomic imprinting nor mitochondrial inheritance is able to explain the correlation between the clinical status of heterozygous mothers and that of their children.\r"

In order to evaluate whether a single genetic or environmental factor with large effects explains the mixture of distributions in Na-Li countertransport in the general population, complex segregation analyses were conducted by using 1,273 individuals more than age 20 years from 276 pedigrees selected without respect to disease risk factors or health status. Either a single genetic locus or a single environmental factor with large gender-specific effects explained the mixture of distributions for Na-Li countertransport in this sample equally well. In the subsample of pedigrees supporting a single-locus etiology, the single genetic locus explained 29.0% of the variability in adjusted Na-Li countertransport in males and 16.6% of that in females. In a subsample of pedigrees supporting an environmental factor etiology, the environmental factor explained 35.2% of the adjusted Na-Li countertransport in males and 20.5% of that in females. These results suggest that there are at least two different explanations for the mixture of distributions in Na-Li countertransport in the general population. Attempts to relate genetic variation in Na-Li countertransport to risk of essential hypertension must consider that the factor with large phenotypic effects on this trait is gender specific and may not be a single major locus in all pedigrees.\r"

  ".W": "Ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) is an X-linked, liver-specific enzyme that catalyzes the second step of the urea cycle. In humans, inherited deficiency of OTC in hemizygous affected males usually results in severe ammonia intoxication and early death. To characterize mutations responsible for OTC deficiency, we used the PCR to amplify cDNAs prepared from patient livers which demonstrated no OTC enzyme activity and no OTC cross-reacting material on western blots. In three of seven cases, smaller than normal products were observed. Sequencing of these cDNAs revealed that two were missing exon 7 of the OTC gene and that the other was missing the first 12 bp of exon 5. Sequencing of genomic DNA from these three patients revealed that one mutant missing exon 7 had a T-to-C substitution in the 5' splice donor site of intron 7. The other mutant missing exon 7 had an A-to-G change in the third position of intron 7. It is interesting that both of these mutations resulted in skipping the preceding exon rather than in inclusion of some or all of the affected intron. In the third mutant, an A-to-T substitution was found in the 3' splice acceptor site at the end of intron 4. Here, a cryptic splice acceptor site within exon 5 was used. Northern blotting of liver RNA from these patients demonstrated (a) reduced, but significant, amounts of OTC mRNA in one of the patients who had a deleted exon 7 but (b) very little OTC mRNA in the other two patients. We propose that these point mutations, which result in aberrant splicing of the OTC pre-mRNAs, lead to OTC deficiency through either decreased efficiency of mRNA export from the nucleus to the cytosol or synthesis of enzyme subunits that are unstable and rapidly degraded. We speculate that abnormal mRNA splicing may represent a relatively common mechanism in the pathogenesis of this disease.\r"

  ".W": "In the past few years, more than 20 different mutations have been reported in hyperphenylalaninemias. In southwestern Europe and Mediterranean countries, however, the mutant genotypes reported account for only a fraction (27%) of all mutant alleles at the phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) locus, and most of the mutations causing the disease remain unknown. In order to develop a strategy for rapid detection of mutation-containing exons, we applied the single-strand conformation-polymorphism (SSCP) technique to exons 3, 5, 7, and 12 of the PAH gene. We observed five abnormal patterns of migration in mutant PAH genes, and we consistently found base substitutions in the corresponding exons, with no false-positive results. By this procedure, two novel putative mutations were detected in the seventh exon of the PAH gene, (A259V and Y277D) and we were able to demonstrate that the delta I94, R158Q, R408W, and E280K mutations were easily detectable by the SSCP technique. This procedure is therefore of particular interest for rapid detection of mutation-containing exons and for determination of further genotype-phenotype correlations in hyperphenylalaninemias.\r"

Direct sequencing of the PCR fragments which showed an altered electrophoretic behavior not attributable to known mutations has led to the characterization of four new mutations, two in exon 11, and one each in exons 15 and 20. Screening for the different mutations thus far identified in our patients by the DGGE analysis and other independent methods should allow detection of about 70% of the molecular defects causing CF in Italy. Mutations located in exons 11 and 20 account for at least 30% of the non-delta F508 mutations present in Italian CF patients.\r"

  ".W": "Menkes syndrome is a rare X-linked recessive disorder characterized by an inability to metabolize copper. A female patient with both this disease and an X; autosome translocation with karyotype 46,X,t(X;2)(q13;q32.2) has previously been described. The translocation breakpoint in Xq13 coincides with a previous assignment of the Menkes gene at Xq13 by linkage data in humans and by analogy to the mottled mutations which are models for Menkes disease in the mouse. Therefore, this translocation probably interrupts the gene for Menkes syndrome in band Xq13. We describe here experiments to precisely map the translocation breakpoint within this chromosomal band. We have established a lymphoblastoid cell line from this patient and have used it to isolate the der(2) translocation chromosome (2pter----2q32::Xq13----Xqter) in human/hamster somatic cell hybrids. Southern blot analyses using a number of probes specific for chromosomes X and 2 have been studied to define precisely the location of the translocation breakpoint. Our results show that the breakpoint in this patient--and, therefore, likely the Menkes gene--maps to a small subregion of band Xq13.2-q13.3 proximal to the PGK1 locus and distal to all other Xq13 loci tested.\r"

  ".W": "Two CpG mutations at codon 504 of the gene encoding the alpha-subunit of beta-hexosaminidase (the HEX A gene) have been identified previously: (1) a C deletion resulting in premature termination of the alpha-subunit and (2) a G----A transition resulting in 504Arg----His substitution, in patients with infantile Tay-Sachs disease and juvenile GM2 gangliosidosis, respectively. This prompted a search for a C----T transition in the same dinucleotide, as would be expected from the mechanism of CpG mutagenesis. Such a mutation, which results in a substitution of cysteine for arginine, was found in a patient with chronic GM2 gangliosidosis, in compound heterozygosity with the known 269Gly----Ser allele. The biochemical phenotype of the 504Arg----Cys mutation was examined by site-directed mutagenesis of the alpha-subunit cDNA and transfection of Cos-1 cells. The expression of the mutagenized cDNA with the cysteine substitution gave rise to an alpha-subunit with the same defects as those resulting from expression of mutagenized cDNA with the histidine substitution--i.e., secretion primarily as the alpha-monomer rather than as the alpha alpha dimer, along with absence of enzymatic activity. The 504Arg----Cys/269Gly----Ser genotype of the chronic GM2 gangliosidosis patient is shared by her sibling, who has mild adult-onset GM2 gangliosidosis, implying that the clinical differences between them must be attributed to other factors. The family is unique in yet another respect--namely, that the normal allele of the mother and of a 504Arg----Cys heterozygous sibling has a silent mutation, a G----A transition in the wobble position of the glutamic acid codon at position 506.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To characterize the molecular basis of the anodal F variant, the DNA sequence of the coding exons of an FZ individual was determined. The F allele differed from the normal M1(Val213) alpha 1AT allele by a single nucleotide transversion of cytosine to thymidine, which results in the amino acid substitution Arg223 CGT----Cys TGT. Inheritance of the F mutation was confirmed by family analysis using allele-specific amplification. In the context that the normal alpha 1AT molecule has only one cysteine residue, a mutation resulting in the addition of a second cysteine may influence the three-dimensional form of the protein and/or permit interaction with other plasma proteins with free-SH groups and may be responsible for the observation that the major F alpha 1AT bands often migrate as doublets in IEF gels.\r"

In a survey of hGH-V gene expression in 20 placentas of gestational age 8-40 wk, we detected a single placenta that contained, in addition to the two normal hGH-V mRNA species, a set of two slightly larger hGH-V mRNAs. Sequence analysis of the elongated hGH-V mRNA demonstrated retention of the first 12 bases of intron 2, resulting from both a base substitution at the intron 2 splice-donor dinucleotide (GT----AT) and activation of a cryptic splice-donor site 12 bases downstream. Survey of a total of 60 additional chromosomes failed to reveal additional incidence of this mutation. The mutation, which we have designated hGH-Vintron 2, pos 1 (G----A), represents both an initial example of a nondeletional mutation within the hGH-V gene and corresponding structural alteration in the encoded hGH-V hormone.\r"

Independently, the Senegal (SEN) beta s haplotype has been found in association with elevated Hb F in SS and beta-thalassemia patients. We have used the kindreds of Milner and colleagues to characterize further the association of haplotype and gamma gene DNA sequence variation with Hb F expression. For the largest kindred, Wi, all four SS had high (greater than 14%) Hb F and both SEN and Benin (BEN) haplotypes. Two AS cases carrying SEN had low Hb F and low F cells, while three AS and one CS carrying BEN had elevated Hb F and elevated F cells; only one AS carrying BEN had low Hb F and low F cells. In order to look for genetic alterations that could account for the elevated Hb F of kindred Wi, we sequenced both the G gamma and A gamma genes of the Wi BEN haplotype. The data showed largely identical G gamma and A gamma genes which may have been generated by two gene conversions: the A gamma promoter was like that of G gamma 3' to -471, while the G gamma IVSII was like that of A gamma in its 5' half.

A G----T transversion was observed in the AG acceptor splice site preceding exon 5 of the beta-hexosaminidase alpha-subunit gene in the first black family. This transversion changed the acceptor splice site from the consensus sequence, AG, to AT, thereby interfering with splicing at this intron 4/exon 5 junction. The proband was homozygous for this mutation; his mother and a brother are heterozygous. The same mutation was found in a second, apparently unrelated, black GM2-gangliosidosis patient. The second patient was a compound heterozygote, as only one allele carried this mutation. The mother and a brother in this second family are carriers for this mutation, while the father and a noncarrier sister are normal for this region of the gene. The third proband did not have this mutation; nor did the mother of a fourth black proband. Eight other independently ascertained non-black, non-Jewish, GM2-gangliosidosis families did not have this mutation. The observation of the same novel mutation in two unrelated black GM2-gangliosidosis patients indicates that the American black population has segregating within it at least one GM2-gangliosidosis mutation which may be specific to this population and not a result of migration.\r"

  ".W": "Skin fibroblasts from a proband with a lethal variant of osteogenesis imperfecta synthesized both apparently normal type I procollagen and a type I procollagen that had slow electrophoretic mobility because of posttranslational overmodifications. The thermal unfolding of the collagen molecules as assayed by protease digestion was about 2 degrees C lower than normal. It is surprising, however, that collagenase A and B fragments showed an essentially normal melting profile. Assay of cDNA heteroduplexes with a new technique involving carbodiimide modification indicated a mutation at about the codon for amino acid 550 of the alpha 1(I) chain. Subsequent amplification of the cDNA by the PCR and nucleotide sequencing revealed a single-base mutation that substituted an aspartate codon for glycine at position alpha 1-541 in the COL1A1 gene. The results here confirm previous indications that the effects of glycine substitutions in type I procollagen are highly position specific. They also demonstrate that a recently described technique for detecting single-base differences by carbodiimide modification of DNA heteroduplexes can be effectively employed to locate mutations in large genes.\r"

Experience gained from the technology and the development of nursing expertise with assessment of patient symptoms are presented as interdependent factors, both of which are critical to a therapeutic nurse-patient relationship. It is proposed that this combined interactive expertise increases sensitivity to the early recognition of preterm labor. The nurse's role in providing social support to high-risk pregnant women is then identified as a potential additional independent contributing factor to reported observed reductions in preterm births. Discussion focuses on future research, public policy issues, and the need for expanding nurse-patient interactions into the home.\r"

The Kupperman index score in both groups declined to about 30% to 40% of initial values (p less than 0.001). The hot flushes in both treatment groups decreased to a highly significant degree (p less than 0.001), to a value below 20% of baseline values. We conclude that a continuous combination of estrogen and progestogen can produce amenorrhea and symptomatic relief. However, the progestogen components seem to differ in their ability to control bleeding.\r"

  ".W": "The hypothesis that an enhanced vasopressor response to angiotensin II in pregnancy may be corrected by suppressing production of platelet thromboxane A2 with low-dose aspirin was tested in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial. We studied 36 normotensive primigravid women with an elevated blood pressure response to intravenously infused angiotensin II at 28 weeks' gestation; 18 women received 60 mg of aspirin daily and the same number received matched placebo until 34 weeks' gestation, when angiotensin-sensitivity was again determined. In women taking aspirin, values of thrombin-induced platelet malondialdehyde production were approximately 10% of those determined in the placebo group, indicating marked suppression of thromboxane A2 synthesis. In the aspirin group vascular refractoriness to angiotensin II was restored in 14 of 17 treated women, by comparison with 5 of 15 women in the placebo group who had remained normotensive. These results support the hypothesis that prostacyclin/thromboxane imbalance is an important pathophysiologic factor in the development of the enhanced angiotensin-sensitivity associated with pregnancy-induced hypertensive disorders.\r"

Amnion membranes (reflected and placental portions) were obtained from patients either in active labor who were delivered vaginally or by cesarean section after 6 to 12 hours of labor or from patients who underwent elective cesarean section before clinical signs of overt labor. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that reflected amnion membranes that were obtained from patients who were not in labor consisted of a uniform single layer of epithelial cells with numerous microvilli on the apical surface and closely associated cellular borders. In contrast, amnion membranes that were obtained from patients who were in labor consisted of a single layer of epithelial cells, which was interrupted by wide intercellular gaps and extracellular extrusions. Transmission electron microscopy showed that intercellular junctions tended to be less complex in patients who were in labor versus patients who were not in labor. Although lipid droplets were prevalent in both patient groups, specimens that were obtained from patients who were in labor had more lipid droplets per cell than specimens from patients who were not in labor. These results support the theory that the complex biochemical events that culminate in parturition are accompanied and/or preceded by demonstrable morphologic changes in the amnion membrane.\r"

Its application has been limited by the amount of image degradation that occurs as a result of fetal movement during the long imaging times. By use of a fast-scan imaging technique good images are obtained of fetal anatomy in 3 to 14 seconds per image, depending on the setting used. Different organs could be visualized by varying the setting. Magnetic resonance imaging complements the role of ultrasonography in fetal visualization. It also allows clear fetal imaging in such high-risk situations as maternal obesity and oligohydramnios, where it may be difficult to produce clear images by ultrasonography. This technique will allow wider application of magnetic resonance imaging in obstetrics and give additional information about the developing fetus.\r"

Disorders of sperm function manifested at the level of zona binding, zona penetration, oolemma fusion, and pronuclear decondensation as well as oocyte anomalies were considered to represent the specific gamete defects that led to abnormal sperm-oocyte interactions (i.e., failed fertilization).

Maternal serum CA 125, which is believed to derive from the decidua, is elevated in the first trimester and immediately after delivery when placental separation occurs, possibly because of decidual disruption. Serum CA 125 was measured in 27 patients beyond 20 weeks' gestation who were first seen with vaginal bleeding and in 17 control patients of similar gestational age and labor status. Mean (+/- SD) CA 125 levels were higher (p less than 0.01) among patients with abruptio placentae (105.9 +/- 115 U/ml) than among those with alternate sources of bleeding (13.7 +/- 10 U/ml) or control patients (18.2 +/- 11.7 U/ml). Mean (+/- SD) serum CA 125 levels in seven control patients within 6 hours post partum (194 +/- 80.5 U/ml) were higher than those among patients first seen with abruptio placentae (p less than 0.01). Sensitivity and specificity of CA 125 for abruptio placentae were 70% and 94%, respectively. Our data support a decidual source for CA 125 and may indicate utility of CA 125 as a marker for abruptio placentae.\r"

Prostaglandin A1 is a powerful vasodepressor that augments renal blood flow and glomerular filtration and possesses antiplatelet aggregator and oxytocic properties. A continuous intravenous infusion of prostaglandin A1 (40 to 50 micrograms/min) or dihydralazine (35 to 50 micrograms/min) was administered to 20 women with severe preeclampsia (10 in each group). The induced hypotensive response was similar with both drugs but the maximum reduction in blood pressure was achieved sooner with dihydralazine (4 hours) compared with prostaglandin A1 (7.5 hours). The more gradual hypotensive response is probably less dangerous on placental perfusion than a sudden change. Moreover, the oxytocic property of prostaglandin A1 shortened the time to delivery, which constitutes another potential advantage.\r"

According to postpartum self-report, 15% of a teaching hospital sample and 3% of a private hospital sample of mothers had used cocaine during pregnancy or in the previous month (total = 876). Rates at the teaching hospital reflect a fifteenfold increase over the past 12-year period, when compared with previously obtained data. Cocaine users were significantly more likely to report that they drank alcohol, smoked cigarettes, and took other illicit drugs during pregnancy than women who denied using cocaine. Mothers at highest risk for cocaine use were those who were black (20%), were single-separated-divorced (24% to 33%), and had less than a high school education (21%).\r"

Parathyroid hormone and osteocalcin levels were low in early pregnancy. They declined toward the middle of pregnancy, but increased in late pregnancy. The serum osteocalcin level correlated with the parathyroid hormone level. The synthesis of osteocalcin by osteoblasts is stimulated by the action of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, and serum osteocalcin levels are also related to the levels of parathyroid hormone. During early and mid pregnancy, the stimulatory effect of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D on the synthesis of osteocalcin may be overridden by the inhibitory effect of declining parathyroid hormone levels. The increase in osteocalcin level in late pregnancy may be a consequence of increasing levels of both parathyroid hormone and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D.\r"

Mothers who were delivered of infants with intrauterine growth retardation demonstrated significantly more autoantibody abnormalities in the two hypertensive groups and in the normotensive control group as compared with patients delivered of appropriately grown infants. The most frequently observed autoantibody abnormalities were antiphospholipid antibodies and the most frequently observed among those were immunoglobulin G isotypes. Total immunoglobulin levels in both hypertensive and normotensive groups were identical. These results suggest a close association between the degree of B-cell activation and both severity of hypertensive diseases and development of intrauterine growth retardation in their offspring.\r"

Of the 10 women with positive herpes simplex virus cultures in this group of 143, no infant was delivered with evidence of neonatal herpes simplex virus infection, including two who had vaginal deliveries. The results of this study support the recommendations that in women without symptoms but with known risk factors for genital herpes simplex virus, a trial of vaginal delivery be allowed and that in women with either a lesion clinically consistent with genital herpes simplex virus or prodromal symptoms of genital herpes simplex virus a cesarean section be the mode of delivery.\r"

Body mass index increased with advancing maternal age, parity, and advancing gestational age and was significantly greater in black women than in nonblack women. Risks for the development of adverse outcome associated with maternal obesity, including development of gestational diabetes, preeclampsia, fetal macrosomia, and shoulder dystocia, were comparably predicted by either maternal weight or body mass index greater than 90th percentile. Maternal weight was as predictive of preeclampsia, macrosomia, and shoulder dystocia as was body mass index when these factors were analyzed as continuous variables, whereas increasing body mass index was more predictive of gestational diabetes. The prediction of factors associated with low maternal weights, small-for-gestational-age birth, prematurity, low birth weight, and perinatal death was equivalent for maternal weight and body mass index that was less than 10th percentile. This study indicates that in the initial risk assessment of outcomes related to maternal weight, the calculation of maternal body mass index offers no advantage over simply weighing the patient. This finding contrasts with results in nonpregnant women.\r"

Complexes of activated protein C with both inhibitors in plasma samples from subjects with normal or pathologic pregnancy were measured. In normal pregnancy we observed a progressive and significant increase in activated protein C/alpha 1-antitrypsin complex levels, from 9 +/- 3 ng/ml in the first trimester to 16 +/- 3 ng/ml in the third trimester, as well as an increase in alpha 1-antitrypsin plasma levels. In severe preeclampsia, but not in chronic hypertension with superimposed severe preeclampsia, there was a greater increase in activated protein C/alpha 1-antitrypsin levels (25 +/- 10 ng/ml) (p less than 0.001) and a decrease in protein C and protein C inhibitor levels as compared with normal pregnant women at similar gestational ages. These data show an increase in the activation of the protein C pathway in both normal and pathologic pregnancy and provide evidence for an enhancement of thrombin generation in severe preeclampsia compared with chronic hypertension with superimposed severe preeclampsia.\r"

  ".U": "91241192\r", 
  ".W": "In the past decade, gratifying progress has been achieved in our understanding of clinical intraamniotic infection. With a usual incidence of 1% to 4%, clinical intraamniotic infection mainly develops as an ascending process after prolonged rupture of the membranes and labor, but other cases may be hematogenous in origin whereas still others complicate intrauterine procedures. The most common organisms isolated in amniotic fluid of cases of intraamniotic infections are anaerobes, genital mycoplasmas, group B streptococci, and Escherichia coli. The latter two are found most commonly in maternal or neonatal bacteremia complicating intraamniotic infection. Although the diagnosis remains largely a clinical one, laboratory tests have been suggested to confirm the diagnosis in women with symptoms. These include amniotic fluid Gram stain, gas-liquid chromatography, and leukocyte esterase measurement. Maternal treatment consists of antibiotic therapy and delivery. Studies to date have used a penicillin plus an aminoglycoside, with some authors advocating the addition of clindamycin after cesarean delivery. Other broad-spectrum regimens may be equally effective. Complications of clinical intraamniotic infections include an increase in cesarean section rate and in maternal and neonatal bacteremia. Poor neonatal outcomes in intraamniotic infection are more likely in the following cases: (1) when E. coli or group B streptococci are present in the amniotic fluid; (2) when the infant has a low birth weight; (3) when maternal antibiotic therapy is delayed until after delivery.\r"

We examined the effects of two vasoactive peptides, endothelin and neuropeptide Y, on segments of human uterine arteries and veins in vitro. We found endothelin, a potent vasoconstrictor in the uterine artery and vein, giving a slow and long-lasting contraction starting at 10(-9) mol/L. At this concentration, the established vasoconstrictor noradrenaline had almost no effect. Neuropeptide Y had no effect of its own in the human uterine artery, but increased basal tone in uterine veins, and at higher concentrations triggered spontaneous contractions. Neuropeptide Y (10(-7) mol/L) often, but not always, enhanced the contraction induced by noradrenaline (10(-6) mol/L). Neuropeptide Y (10(-7) mol/L) also enhanced the contraction induced by transmural nerve stimulation (20 Hz, 0.4 msec). We conclude that endothelin and neuropeptide Y may modulate the control of human uterine circulation.\r"

We were unable to detect any changes in activity after stimulation with a model 5C electrolarynx. With more powerful stimulation using a mechanical oscillator, fetal electrocortical activity desynchronized. Fetal breathing and eye movements changed with electrocortical activity and there was an increase in nuchal muscle activity. Stimulation caused a small decrease in fetal heart rate. Responses to stimulation were not seen in four of the five fetuses with bilateral cochlear ablation. These results indicate that in fetal sheep the auditory apparatus is necessary for the detection of vibroacoustic stimuli. The difference in responsiveness of the sheep and human fetus appears to be because of a difference in central processing after detection of the stimulus.\r"

Addition of magnesium sulfate (0.5 to 9.6 mmol/L) to the suffusion medium containing the normal concentration of 1.2 mmol/L magnesium sulfate produced concentration-dependent relaxation of norepinephrine (1 mumol/L)-induced or potassium chloride (35 mmol/L)-induced contractions. Magnesium sulfate was about three times more potent in causing inhibition of potassium chloride-induced contractions in uterine arteries from pregnant patients than in those from nonpregnant patients. The concentrations that inhibited 50% of the contraction induced by potassium chloride were 0.6 +/- 0.2 mmol/L (n = 4) in the arteries from pregnant patients and 1.6 +/- 0.2 mmol/L (n = 4) in the arteries from nonpregnant patients. At high concentrations (4.8 and 9.6 mmol/L), magnesium sulfate also was more potent in inhibiting norepinephrine-induced contractions in arteries from pregnant women than in arteries from nonpregnant women. The magnesium sulfate-induced relaxation was almost completely inhibited by calcium chloride (2 mmol/L) added to the suffusion medium containing the normal concentration of 2.5 mmol/L calcium chloride but was not affected by indomethacin (5 mumol/L), methylene blue (10 mumol/L), or removal of the endothelium. The results show that magnesium sulfate, at therapeutic blood concentrations, acts as a potent dilator of human uterine arteries, especially those from pregnant patients. The results are consistent with the view that magnesium sulfate may facilitate uteroplacental perfusion.\r"

  ".W": "Recurrent vaginal infections caused by Candida albicans are associated with decreased cell-mediated immune responses. We report that circulating progesterone levels and variations between persons in the activity of their monocytes are two of the factors that influence the extent of lymphocyte proliferation in response to C. albicans. With the use of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from five men and four women, removal of the monocytes increased the lymphocyte response to C. albicans antigens in eight persons. The percentage increase in proliferation was inversely proportional to the proliferative response observed when the monocytes were present, suggesting that differences existed between persons in the ability of their monocytes to down regulate the response. An approximate 50% decrease in C. albicans-induced lymphocyte proliferation was observed in the presence of luteal-phase levels (25 ng/ml), as opposed to proliferative-phase levels (0.15 ng/ml) of progesterone. Monocyte removal obviated the ability of 25 ng/ml progesterone to inhibit this response, suggesting that progesterone inhibited lymphocyte proliferation through a monocyte-dependent mechanism. Thus fluctuations in a woman's monocyte activity in response to genetic, hormonal, or environmental factors may influence her ability to mount an effective cell-mediated immune response to C. albicans.\r"

In this study we showed that release of the antigen is regulated, with both amnion and WISH cells responding in a similar manner to the tested agents. Release of CA 125 decreased in the presence of dexamethasone (10(-6) mol/L) or cycloheximide (0.1 micrograms/ml) and increased when colchicine (0.01 micrograms/ml) was added to the culture medium. Stimulatory and inhibitory effects were more apparent after 3 days in culture. The precise mechanisms by which some of these agents (colchicine and dexamethasone) affect CA 125 release remain unknown. We propose that amnion and WISH cells in culture represent a useful model to investigate some regulatory aspects of the production of CA 125 in normal tissues.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE: The authors' goal is to address the complex issue of treatment-refractory depression from a clinical perspective. DATA COLLECTION: They review the literature on the major clinical and methodological issues involved in the treatment and study of treatment-refractory depression as well as primary and tertiary care surveys of patients whose depression has not responded to treatment. FINDINGS: There are methodological problems in defining treatment-refractory depression and in the tertiary care surveys of treatment-refractory depression. The authors define treatment-refractory depression as primarily involving diagnostic-treatment variables rather than patient variables. They articulate these variable as a series of questions the clinician may consider when confronted with patients who are considered refractory: 1) Is the diagnosis correct? 2) Has the patient received adequate treatment? 3) Was a rational stepped-care approach used? 4) How was outcome measured? 5) Is there a coexisting medical or psychiatric disorder that interferes with response to treatment? and 6) Are there factors in the clinical setting that are interfering with treatment? CONCLUSIONS: The problem of treatment-refractory depression has to do primarily with the diagnostic-treatment process than with patient variables. This has a number of implications in the areas of training, education, research, and public health. The evidence indicates that improvements in the recognition and treatment of depression are needed.\r"

FINDINGS: The serotonin syndrome is most commonly the result of the interaction between serotonergic agents and monoamine oxidase inhibitors. The most frequent clinical features are changes in mental status, restlessness, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, diaphoresis, shivering, and tremor. The presumed pathophysiological mechanism involves brainstem and spinal cord activation of the 1A form of serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, or 5-HT) receptor. The incidence of the syndrome is not known. Both sexes have been affected, and patients' ages have ranged from 20 to 68 years. Discontinuation of the suspected serotonergic agent and institution of supportive measures are the primary treatment, although 5-HT receptor antagonists may also play a role. Once treatment is instituted, the syndrome typically resolves within 24 hours, but confusion can last for days, and death has been reported. CONCLUSIONS: The serotonin syndrome is a toxic condition requiring heightened clinical awareness for prevention, recognition, and prompt treatment. Further work is needed to establish the diagnostic criteria, incidence, and predisposing factors, to identify the role of 5-HT antagonists in treatment, and to differentiate the syndrome from neuroleptic malignant syndrome.\r"

  ".U": "91241394\r", 
  ".W": "OBJECTIVE: Benzodiazepines, either alone or added to neuroleptics, have been studied extensively as treatments for schizophrenia, but no consensus regarding their efficacy has been reached. The authors review the double-blind trials in the literature and relate the findings to the neurobiology of benzodiazepine actions. METHOD: The clinical review included all double-blind studies through 1989 that could be identified by means of Index Medicus and computer-assisted searches and by the cross-referencing of articles. The findings from the 14 studies of benzodiazepines used alone and the 16 studies of adjunctive therapy are presented separately. RESULTS: The studies reviewed suggest that 1) response is highly variable, and about one-third to one-half of patients improve; 2) benzodiazepines are potentially most useful as adjuncts to neuroleptics in the acute management of psychotic agitation, although actual antipsychotic effects have also been observed in some patients; 3) relatively higher doses of benzodiazepines may be associated with better response; and 4) therapeutic effects, when seen, develop rapidly but diminish after several weeks in some patients. The authors explore the neurobiological bases of benzodiazepine action, which presumably underlie their efficacy in schizophrenia and may help explain the variability of response. CONCLUSIONS: Future research on benzodiazepines in the treatment of schizophrenia should focus on features that predict response, the relation of dopamine or other neurotransmitter systems to therapeutic effects, the schizophrenic symptoms most amenable to benzodiazepine treatment, changes in neuroleptic dose during benzodiazepine augmentation, the role of benzodiazepines in maintenance therapy, and the optimal characteristics of benzodiazepine treatment.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE:The author's goal is to determine whether there has been a recent change in the number and proportion of severely ill psychiatric patients treated in general hospitals. METHOD: He analyzed the discharge data from the National Hospital Discharge Survey for the years between 1970 and 1987, focusing particularly on the discharges of patients with psychiatric versus nonpsychiatric diagnoses. The number and proportion of discharges of patients with psychiatric diagnoses in four major diagnostic groups (depression, bipolar spectrum disorders, schizophrenia, and other psychoses) were determined. RESULTS: Between 1970 and 1987, discharges of patients with psychiatric diagnoses from general hospitals increased by a factor of 0.8. The percentage of discharges of patients with the diagnoses of depression (18.0%-22.7%), schizophrenia (9.4%-13.6%), and paranoid or other nonorganic psychoses (3.1%-4.0%) remained relatively constant. The percentage of discharges of patients with the diagnosis of nondepressed bipolar disorder increased from 0.6% in 1970 to 3.2% in 1987. CONCLUSIONS: Although there has been a recent absolute increase in the number of general hospital patients with severe psychiatric diagnoses, the increase has been tempered by a concomitant increase in the number of patients with nonsevere diagnoses. Changes in classification systems (DSM-II or ICDA-8 to DSM-III or ICD-9-CM) and questions regarding the rigor with which the nosologic changes have been incorporated into practice complicate the interpretation of these findings.\r"
