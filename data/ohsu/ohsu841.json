  ".W": "The crystal structure of Escherichia coli glutaminyl-tRNA synthetase (GlnRS) complexed with its cognate glutaminyl transfer RNA (tRNA(Gln] and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) has been derived from a 2.8 angstrom resolution electron density map and the known protein and tRNA sequences. The 63.4-kilodalton monomeric enzyme consists of four domains arranged to give an elongated molecule with an axial ratio greater than 3 to 1. Its interactions with the tRNA extend from the anticodon to the acceptor stem along the entire inside of the L of the tRNA. The complexed tRNA retains the overall conformation of the yeast phenylalanine tRNA (tRNA(Phe] with two major differences: the 3' acceptor strand of tRNA(Gln) makes a hairpin turn toward the inside of the L, with the disruption of the final base pair of the acceptor stem, and the anticodon loop adopts a conformation not seen in any of the previously determined tRNA structures. Specific recognition elements identified so far include (i) enzyme contacts with the 2-amino groups of guanine via the tRNA minor groove in the acceptor stem at G2 and G3; (ii) interactions between the enzyme and the anticodon nucleotides; and (iii) the ability of the nucleotides G73 and U1.A72 of the cognate tRNA to assume a conformation stabilized by the protein at a lower free energy cost than noncognate sequences. The central domain of this synthetase binds ATP, glutamine, and the acceptor end of the tRNA as well as making specific interactions with the acceptor stem.2+t is\r"

  ".W": "A single-site mutant of Escherichia coli glutaminyl-synthetase (D235N, GlnRS7) that incorrectly acylates in vivo the amber suppressor supF tyrosine transfer RNA (tRNA(Tyr] with glutamine has been described. Two additional mutant forms of the enzyme showing this misacylation property have now been isolated in vivo (D235G, GlnRS10; I129T, GlnRS15). All three mischarging mutant enzymes still retain a certain degree of tRNA specificity; in vivo they acylate supE glutaminyl tRNA (tRNA(Gln] and supF tRNA(Tyr) but not a number of other suppressor tRNA's. These genetic experiments define two positions in GlnRS where amino acid substitution results in a relaxed specificity of tRNA discrimination. The crystal structure of the GlnRS:tRNA(Gln) complex provides a structural basis for interpreting these data. In the wild-type enzyme Asp235 makes sequence-specific hydrogen bonds through its side chain carboxylate group with base pair G3.C70 in the minor groove of the acceptor stem of the tRNA. This observation implicates base pair 3.70 as one of the identity determinants of tRNA(Gln). Isoleucine 129 is positioned adjacent to the phosphate of nucleotide C74, which forms part of a hairpin structure adopted by the acceptor end of the complexed tRNA molecule. These results identify specific areas in the structure of the complex that are critical to accurate tRNA discrimination by GlnRS.\r"

Most were sequential isolates obtained at the initiation of and during therapy. Comparative nucleotide sequence analysis of the reverse transcriptase (RT) coding region from five pairs of sensitive and resistant isolates identified three predicted amino acid substitutions common to all the resistant strains (Asp67----Asn, Lys70----Arg, Thr215----Phe or Tyr) plus a fourth in three isolates (Lys219----Gln). Partially resistant isolates had combinations of these four changes. An infectious molecular clone constructed with these four mutations in RT yielded highly resistant HIV after transfection of T cells. The reproducible nature of these mutations should make it possible to develop rapid assays to predict zidovudine resistance by performing polymerase chain reaction amplification of nucleic acid from peripheral blood lymphocytes, thereby circumventing current lengthy HIV isolation and sensitivity testing.\r"

Transgenic mice represent a new form of perturbation analysis whereby the selective expression of novel or altered genes can be used to perturb complex systems in ways that are informative about their development, their functions, and their malfunctions.

We report the clinical and histopathological findings of an infant who developed a unilateral, sectoral lens opacity four months after undergoing treatment for disseminated candidiasis. The diagnosis of localized intralenticular fungal abscess with associated endophthalmitis was made via histopathologic examination of the aspirated lens material. Treatment with systemic antifungal agents successfully preserved the eye. In addition, we review and summarize the previously reported cases of Candida endophthalmitis in patients under one year of age.\r"

Some patients develop dystonic, uncontrolled movements in areas outside the facial nerve distribution (segmental cranial dystonia or craniocervical dystonia). Chronic, forceful squeezing by the periocular muscles becomes debilitating for the patient and leads to functional and cosmetic eyelid deformities. Treatment has included a variety of modalities and oral medications that are of limited efficacy. Botulinum-A toxin injections have delivered the best temporary relief from this disorder, while the periorbital myectomy operation has been shown to give the best long-term results.\r"

Muller describes his attempts to correct his own -14.00 diopters of myopia with \"cornea-lenses,\" which were essentially glass scleral lenses. His inability to tolerate lens wear for more than half an hour was probably due to a) limbal pressure as a result of the primary optic diameter being too small, and b) the use of water to occupy the space between the lens and cornea, which would have induced severe corneal edema. Many of the observations and recommendations embodied in Muller's thesis, such as the importance of a good fit, adequate tear flow and rounded edges, are still relevant to contact lens practice today.\r"

A decade of experience with modern techniques has produced considerable literature on the complications of keratotomy. Vision-threatening complications (bacterial keratitis, traumatic rupture of the globe through weakened keratotomy scars, endophthalmitis, cataract formation from surgical trauma to the lens) are quite rare, occurring in less than 1% of eyes in published series. The most common side effects affect most patients in the first few months after surgery: pain for 24 to 48 hours, transient glare and light sensitivity, and fluctuating visual acuity. The most common persistent complications are overcorrection and undercorrection. Persistent irregular astigmatism occurs in almost all cases in the region of the incision scars, but it is rarely severe enough to reduce spectacle acuity. Most individuals have mild glare, but this is rarely disabling. Diurnal variation of refraction in visual acuity occurs commonly, but the magnitude of the fluctuation is seldom enough to require multiple pairs of spectacles. Longterm refractive stability occurs in approximately half of eyes by six months, but approximately one in four eyes will experience continued change over six months to four years. Complications, such as scarring from intersecting keratotomy incisions, irregular astigmatism resulting from multiple reoperations, and overcorrections with the attendant early onset of symptomatic presbyopia are becoming much less frequent.\r"

We reviewed the preoperative investigation and operative outcome in 23 patients to assess the predictive value of localization before surgery. With results of laparotomy used as reference, the efficacy of computed tomography, angiography, ultrasonography, and magnetic resonance imaging, individually and combined for primary and metastatic disease, was determined. All investigative modalities were poor for the detection of primary gastrinomas, with individual sensitivities in the range of 20% to 29%. Their combined sensitivity was 53%, with a negative predictive value of only 38%. The detection of metastatic disease was better, with a combined accuracy of 83%. At laparotomy, tumor was identified in 19 of 23 (83%) patients. In 14 patients with negative preoperative workup, primary gastrinoma was found in 10 of 14 (71%) and resected for long-term cure in three of 14 (21%) patients. In all nine patients with positive preoperative test results, tumor was found and was resected for cure in four (44%) patients. In conclusion, preoperative localization of primary gastrinoma is unreliable, and a negative workup does not preclude cure. Therefore, despite the availability of effective palliative antiulcer therapy, all patients exclusive of those with multiple endocrine neoplasia, type I, or metastasis should undergo laparatomy with curative resection in mind.\r"

Patients with MEN I and either insulinoma or vasoactive intestinal polypeptide tumor (VIPoma) underwent surgery whether or not a tumor was identified. Each patient underwent preoperative portal venous sampling (PVS). Nine patients with MEN I and one with MEN II underwent surgery; seven had ZES, one had insulinoma, one had VIPoma, and one had both insulinoma and ZES. Eight of the nine patients with MEN I had an identifiable hormone gradient on PVS. Islet cell tumors were removed from the pancreas of each patient; two patients also had duodenal wall tumors, and three patients had malignant islet cell tumors. No patient with ZES and MEN I was cured of ZES despite the fact that islet cell tumor was removed from the region of the gastrin gradient in five of six patients. The single patient with MEN II and ZES and the three additional patients with MEN I and either insulinoma or VIPoma were cured by islet cell tumor resection. The results indicate that islet cell tumors in patients with MEN I can be both extrapancreatic and malignant. In patients with MEN I and ZES, ZES cannot be cured by tumor resection, and PVS cannot be used to select patients for curative surgery. It appears that gastrinoma in patients with MEN II, as well as either insulinoma or VIPoma in patients with MEN I, can be cured by islet cell tumor resection.\r"

This study examined the effects of injections of recombinant (r) human TNF on circulating levels of metabolic substrates and hormones in conscious, unrestrained rats and the effects of TNF on cortisol secretion from human adrenocortical cells in vitro. Sublethal doses of rTNF--doses that did not produce hemodynamic changes in previous work--produced rapid (1 hour), significant increases in blood levels of glucose, lactate, and triglycerides and decreases in plasma levels of branched chain amino acids. Plasma levels of glucagon, corticosterone, ACTH, norepinephrine, and dihydroxyphenylglycol were also increased significantly. Incubation of adrenocortical cells with either 0.15 or 1.5 micrograms of rTNF increased cortisol secretion to the same extent as did 10(-10) mol/L ACTH. Administration of TNF produces a variety of metabolic and neuroendocrine effects including stimulation of anterior pituitary, adrenal cortical, and pancreatic secretion, and sympathoneural activation. These changes, and the in vitro results, are consistent with the view that immune cells can interact with endocrine cells through release of TNF.\r"

  ".W": "The question still remains: What is best for the patient? It appears that whole organ or segmental pancreas transplantation can be carried out, giving anywhere from a 46% to an 84% 1-year pancreas survival rate. At the moment there is no clear-cut evidence that patient survival--at least in the short term--is any better after a combined pancreas-kidney graft than after a kidney graft alone, and there are more complications from the combined procedure. It appears once again that patient survival is a function of control of ketoacidosis and its complications--whether by a pancreas graft or by better insulin delivery. Nevertheless, several things have been learned: (1) Patients who receive a pancreas-kidney graft simultaneously have the best pancreas 1-year survival. (2) A pancreatic graft without a simultaneous kidney graft does poorly. (3) A pancreas graft carried out after a kidney graft will not do as well. (4) A kidney transplanted to a diabetic patient may become nephropathic unless supported by a pancreatic graft. (5) Retinopathy is not improved by pancreatic transplantation. (6) Neuropathy is improved or stabilized by pancreatic transplantation. (7) Nephropathy is improved by pancreatic grafting. (8) There is no clear-cut difference in pancreatic graft survival, whether segmental or whole organ grafts are used. (9) Bladder-drained grafts appear to have slightly better survival at 1 year than enteric-drained or polymer-injected grafts. (10) Human islet cell homotransplantation is not yet an accomplished fact. As Barker has pointed out, the potential benefits of pancreatic grafting are for those who are prone to complications and who do not have irreversible diabetic complications. Predicting those in whom significant complications will develop is not easy, and a large percentage of the grafts done to date have been done for patients with end stage renal disease. It has been suggested that transplants are best used for those with early renal disease and for those with pre-proliferative retinopathy and for those that are metabolically difficult to handle with insulin and for those at high risk for complications with diabetes: namely, those with high levels of inactive renin that are associated with microvascular complications and high levels of insulin-like growth factor. These complications seem to be associated with accelerated progression of retinopathy. Diabetic children whose disease is associated with major neurovascular disease and children with impaired counter regulatory mechanisms may also be candidates for grafting.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The presence of steroid hormone receptors has previously been suggested in thyroid tissue by biochemical means. Our studies were designed to confirm these results and to localize the specific receptor-containing cell type using a novel immunocytochemical method. Monoclonal antibodies specific to estrogen receptors (ER) and progesterone receptors (PgR) were used to localize these steroid hormone receptors in the human thyroid gland. Frozen tissue sections from surgical specimens excised from 22 patients of both sexes with benign thyroid disease were studied. The sections were incubated with rat antiestrophilin and antiprogesterone receptor antibodies and were then exposed to rabbit anti-rat IgG and to rat peroxidase-antiperoxidase complex. The reaction product was visualized with diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride and hydrogen peroxide. Four specimens were positive for both ER and PgR, 16 were ER-positive and PgR-negative, and two were negative for both ER and PgR. Positive reactivity was limited to the follicular lining cell nuclei and varied from focal to diffuse. The immunohistochemical findings confirmed the presence of ER and PgR in the thyroid tissue and demonstrated for the first time that these receptors are present only in the nuclei of the lining cells of the thyroid follicle. The role of steroid hormone receptors in the thyroid in health and disease remains to be explained.\r"

  ".W": "The panting manoeuvre may be used during the assessment of airway resistance and in asthmatic patients during bronchial provocation testing or spontaneous asthma. To study whether panting opens the larynx in patients with asthma, laryngeal resistance was examined in six patients with stable asthma before and after methacholine induced bronchoconstriction and in another six patients with spontaneous asthma. Subjects were asked to pant and then to hold their breath immediately afterwards. Laryngeal resistance after panting was compared to that during quiet tidal breathing. Change in laryngeal resistance was estimated by a method using low frequency sound and respiratory resistance by forced oscillation at 10 Hz. Mean baseline respiratory resistance during inspiration was 0.245 and 0.470 kPa/l.s before and after methacholine in the patients with stable asthma and 0.480 kPa/l.s in the patients with spontaneous asthma. In the patients with stable asthma mean laryngeal resistance was lower after panting than during the preceding quiet tidal breathing, both before and after methacholine induced bronchoconstriction (by 0.08 before and by 0.065 kPa/l.s after). In contrast, the patients with spontaneous asthma showed an increase in laryngeal resistance after panting of 0.089 kPa/l.s. The magnitude of change in laryngeal resistance after panting was similar to the change in respiratory resistance in the patients with spontaneous asthma and in the patients with stable asthma after methacholine, but was greater than the change in respiratory resistance in the patients with stable asthma before methacholine. These results suggest that panting may cause different effects on the laryngeal aperture in patients with stable and spontaneous asthma.\r"

Informative measures of transfusion practice within an ICD-9-CM class were the proportion of patients transfused, the mean units transfused per patient, and the ratio of standard deviation to the mean of units transfused. Transfusion frequency plots (percentage of patients against units of red cells transfused per patient) revealed the existence of a modal transfusion frequency, as well as an asymmetric tail on the high frequency side. These and other features make it possible to characterize transfusion practice in specific ICD-9-CM classes. The mean units of red cells transfused for all patients in a DRG is a measure of blood resource utilization and should be useful in planning to meet future needs.\r"

All of these have been shown to cause deleterious physiologic responses in laboratory studies in humans. Some compounds found in wood smoke--benzo[a]pyrene and formaldehyde--are possible human carcinogens. Fine particulate matter has been associated with decreased pulmonary function in children and with increased chronic lung disease in Nepal, where exposure to very high amounts of wood smoke occurs in residences. Wood smoke fumes, taken from both outdoor and indoor samples, have shown mutagenic activity in short-term bioassay tests. Because of the potential health effects of wood smoke, exposure to this source of air pollution should be minimal.\r"

Unfortunately, the relative benefits and risks of anticoagulant therapy have not been adequately quantified for many thromboembolic disorders, and the decisions as to whether, for how long, and how intensely to administer anticoagulation are often complex and controversial. Several expert panels have published recommendations for anticoagulant therapy for different thromboembolic disorders; the primary area of disagreement among these panels concerns the optimal intensity of anticoagulation. Recent research and analytic reviews have helped to clarify both the risk factors for and the appropriate diagnostic evaluation of anticoagulant-induced hemorrhage. Clinicians must be aware of the nonhemorrhagic complications of anticoagulant therapy, particularly during pregnancy. The administration of anticoagulants is difficult both in relation to dosing and long-term monitoring. Knowledge of the pharmacology of the anticoagulants, an organized approach to ongoing monitoring, and thorough patient education may facilitate the safe and effective use of these drugs.\r"

Different velocity curves have been empirically described in different disease states and under differing loading conditions in humans, but relating these various Doppler parameters to hemodynamic measurements of ventricular diastolic properties has not been fully elucidated. The effect of differing loading conditions (preload reduction, preload increase, afterload increase) on the Doppler mitral flow velocity and high-fidelity left atrial-left ventricular pressures was examined in seven closed-chest, anesthetized dogs. Preload reduction by balloon inflation in the inferior vena cava resulted in significant decreases in E velocity (early diastolic velocity) from 0.39 +/- 0.09 m/sec to 0.29 +/- 0.10 m/sec (p less than 0.01) and prolongation of deceleration time from 131 +/- 18 msec to 165 +/- 60 msec (p less than 0.05). Preload increase by infusion of fluids resulted in a significant increase in E velocity from 0.39 +/- 0.09 m/sec to 0.49 +/- 0.10 m/sec (p less than 0.001) and shortening of the deceleration time from 131 +/- 18 msec to 95 +/- 15 msec (p less than 0.001). The effect of afterload increase was variable and was dependent upon the left atrial pressure. Significant but weak positive correlations were noted between E velocity and maximal left atrial-left ventricular pressure gradient (r = 0.47, p less than 0.001) and total change in left ventricular pressure (r = 0.68, p less than 0.001), with inverse relationships between the deceleration time and these parameters. There was no overall relationship between the time constant tau and the E velocity, but an inverse relationship emerged when the data were examined according to different filling pressures. These results indicate that none of the mitral velocity measurements should be directly equated with other measurements of diastolic function. However, distinct velocity curves emerged under differing loading conditions that help in interpreting the meaning of these curves.\r"

Echocardiographic methods included: [1] cubed M-mode formula; [2] Teichholz M-mode formula; [3] subjective estimation of LVEF from two-dimensional echocardiographic videotape; [4] area-length method in one four-chamber view; [5] average of area-length method in three four-chamber views; [6] average of area-length method in four-chamber and two-chamber views (one beat each); [7] subjective estimation from stored videoloop of four-chamber and two-chamber view. In 30 cases M-mode tracings were available for analysis. In only 23 of the 44 patients were the apical views suitable for quantitative analysis. The ERNA ejection fraction was 44 +/- 17% (mean +/- 1 SD). The best echocardiographic correlation with ERNA ejection fraction in each patient subgroup studied was obtained by method 3. We concluded that subjective analysis of the videotaped study by an experienced cardiologist/echocardiographer provided the best estimation of ERNA ejection fraction. More time-consuming and costly computer techniques yielded a worse estimate.\r"

A thorough physical examination and basic, noninvasive evaluation are essential for establishing the diagnosis of heart failure and for designing an optimal, individualized treatment regimen. Although digitalis and diuretics continue to be used commonly for the treatment of CHF of all severities, the use of vasodilators and ACE inhibitors has increased dramatically, as they are used more widely and earlier in the course of the illness. Because the RAA system contributes significantly to the altered cardiovascular hemodynamics and symptomatology characteristic of heart failure, the ACE inhibitors provide a rational approach to therapy for many patients. Results of controlled clinical trials have shown that selected vasodilators and ACE inhibitors can improve survival in patients with CHF and that patients receiving ACE inhibitors show sustained improvement in clinical class, exercise tolerance, and hemodynamics. Thus the therapeutic spectrum available to the clinician dealing with patients with CHF has broadened substantively over the past decade.\r"

Symptoms include dyspnea (81%), chest pain (34%), and fatigue (29%). Peripheral edema (90%) and an elevated jugular venous pressure (86%) were the most common abnormal signs found during physical examination. Chest x-ray and ECG abnormalities were not helpful in making the diagnosis, and abnormal echocardiographic findings were reported in less than half of the cases. Computerized tomography and magnetic resonance imaging scans of the heart were usually of great diagnostic benefit. Diastolic equalization of cardiac pressures remains the sine que non for diagnosis. Oral steroids have been reported to favorably alter the course early in the disease, but pericardial stripping remains the definitive form of therapy. Operative mortality rates vary from 5.5% to 14.5%.\r"

  ".U": "90071694\r", 
  ".W": "Since its introduction in 1985, there have been numerous reports of the use of radio-frequency (RF) current as an alternative energy source for catheter ablation. RF current (frequency range 150 kHz to 1 MHz), when delivered in bipolar mode, causes desiccation of tissue by creating a localized area of heat that results in discrete coagulation necrosis. An equivalent energy source such as direct current (DC) shock can be delivered at lower power (5 to 30 W) and lower voltage (30 to 80 V) for a longer pulse duration (10 to 60 seconds), thus eliminating barotraumatic effects. Because of its high frequency, RF current does not stimulate neuromuscular fibers, and general anesthesia during ablation is not needed. Studies in animals have shown that catheter-delivered RF energy can safely produce permanent complete or partial AV block, necrosis of atrial and ventricular myocardium adjacent to the mitral and tricuspid anuli potentially suitable for ablation of accessory pathways, and discrete lesions in the left and right ventricular myocardium. Recently, investigators from several centers have reported successful ablation of the AV junction (either complete or partial AV block) in patients with refractory supraventricular tachyarrhythmias, ablation of accessory pathways, and ablation of focal ventricular myocardium or a segment of a bundle branch in patients with drug-resistant ventricular tachycardia. Specific modification of AV conduction to cure AV nodal reentrant tachycardia has been successfully attempted. In all studies the application of RF current has not caused any serious complications.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "To examine the natural history of long-term anti-arrhythmic therapy in patients with benign and potentially lethal ventricular premature complexes (VPCs), 28 patients with initial efficacy with moricizine (greater than 75% suppression of baseline mean VPCs/hr and greater than 90% suppression of repetitive VPCs) were prospectively followed for 1 to 56 (mean +/- standard deviation 25 +/- 17) months. Patients were examined during baseline placebo, anti-arrhythmic drug therapy and intermittent pulsed-placebo reexamination periods. The mean VPCs of all patients at baseline entry were 233 +/- 47 VPCs/hr, and after moricizine therapy 14 +/- 4 VPCs/hr. Follow-up demonstrated that antiarrhythmic efficacy decreased to 75% at 12 months and to 62% at 24 months. Loss of antiarrhythmic drug efficacy most commonly occurred as a \"transient\" event (10 patients [36%]), and efficacy was spontaneously reestablished without a change in antiarrhythmic therapy. In contrast, increased dose titration of moricizine was necessary to reestablish antiarrhythmic suppression efficacy in 4 patients (14%), and 4 patients (14%) lost antiarrhythmic drug responsiveness during follow-up. Spontaneous decrease in baseline VPCs resulted in discontinuation of antiarrhythmic therapy in 3 patients, and increase in baseline VPCs was associated with a loss of antiarrhythmic response in 2 patients. Late proarrhythmic effects (2 patients, 7%), delayed side effects necessitating drug withdrawal (6 patients, 21%) and medical events (4 patients, 14%) occurred during 56 months of follow-up. Individual serum moricizine levels remained in the therapeutic range throughout the study and did not correlate with changes in antiarrhythmic efficacy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The study population consisted of 251 caucasian 11-year-old twin pairs. Correlations were higher for all variables in monozygotic twins compared to dizygotic twins; this is consistent with a significant genetic effect. Path analysis revealed that the model of additive genetic and individual environmental effects fit systolic BP, diastolic BP and HR. In boys and girls, sex-specific genetic effects controlled systolic BP. The magnitudes of the sex-specific genetic effects on systolic BP were similar in both boys and girls and accounted for 66% of the variance. In boys, for diastolic BP, genetic effects accounted for 64% of the variance while in girls they accounted for 51%. These results provide no evidence for different genetic effects on HR in boys or girls. No shared environmental effects were detected. The large sample size and design, using different-sex dizygotic twins of the same age, establish that genes play an important role in the influence of resting BP and HR and that there are sex-specific genetic contributions in early pubertal children.\r"

The authors reviewed marrow sections from 60 patients with CTCL, looking carefully for aggregates of cerebriform cells, and found marrow involvement in 13 patients (21.7%); another 19 had abnormal lymphoid nodules that were not diagnostic of involvement, and 28 had marrows with negative results. Involved marrows had nodules or infiltrates of dysplastic cerebriform cells that were often subtle, without a significant increase in cellularity; only one case showed massive involvement. Patients with CTCL with an infiltrative component of marrow involvement had associated peripheral blood involvement (eight of eight), generalized erythroderma (six of eight), lymph node involvement (five of eight), visceral progression (five of eight), and significantly shortened median survival compared with patients with CTCL with negative marrows (11 months and 70 months, respectively; P = 0.007). In contrast, five patients with nodules of tumor in the marrow but lacking an infiltrative component did not have peripheral blood involvement; only one patient had adenopathy or visceral progression develop, and two patients have died. Significant hematologic abnormalities were generally absent. Eight of 13 patients with marrow involvement had advanced skin disease, but skin disease was limited to plaques in five patients. Eight patients had marrow involvement develop within three months of initial diagnosis. Thus, marrow involvement occurs in approximately 20% of patients with CTCL, is often present at initial diagnosis, and is associated with widespread dissemination and shortened survival time when an infiltrative component is present.\r"

  ".W": "The authors present experimental techniques for the diagnosis of malignant lymphoma and benign lymphocytosis in lymphoid-rich effusions with the use of an inexpensive microcomputer-based video system for computerized interactive morphometry (CIM). Lymphoid cells were randomly selected by a trained observer from real-time images of Papanicolaou-fixed and -stained cytospin smears prepared from pleural, peritoneal, or pericardial effusions. The lymphoid cells were classified by the instrument, based on the size and shape of their nuclear profiles. The morphometric data collected by the instrument were interpreted by a simple rule-based expert system that classified the smears as benign or malignant. One hundred four cases, including 28 malignant lymphomas, 63 benign lymphocytoses, 8 chronic lymphocytic leukemias, and 5 cases with incomplete immunopathologic data, were studied retrospectively. Sixty-three of these effusions had been stained to detect light chain monoclonality. Ninety-one effusions were correctly classified by the expert system. There were four potential false negative diagnoses and one potential false positive diagnosis by the CIM system. Eight effusions from patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) were consistently classified as benign. Although the author's series of patients with a history of CLL is small, their results suggest that CIM is unsuitable for the diagnosis of malignancy in these effusions. If only those effusions from patients with a history of CLL are excluded, the predictive value of a diagnosis of malignant lymphoma was 96.5%, whereas the predictive value of a diagnosis of benign lymphocytosis was 94.0%.\r"

Background staining was decreased by use of buffers containing a detergent. The use of a light-stable silver reagent permitted greater control of the enhancement stage. The method yielded a high degree of contrast with negligible nonspecific staining. Sensitivity was comparable to that obtained with conventional enzymatic immunostaining. However, the authors noted that trypsinization of sections was rendered unnecessary for those antigens for which such pretreatment was usually required, and the need for special fixatives could be eliminated. The method was also applicable to immunostaining of frozen sections. Immunogold-silver staining by capillary action deserves consideration as an alternative to existing immunohistochemical methods in diagnostic histopathology.\r"

The antidote interfered to a varying extent with all assays reported. The results suggest that most competitive immunoassays will yield results that bear little relation to concentrations of total digoxin or free digoxin (i.e., digoxin not bound to the antidote). The aca, Dimension, and CEDIA sequential immunoassays moderately overestimated the free digoxin concentration. Free digoxin levels appeared to be only slightly overestimated by the Aria, Stratus, and Syva assays.

The authors have studied three patients with biopsy-proven lepromatous leprosy in whom Fite stain, performed on histologic sections of bone marrow aspirates, demonstrated numerous bacilli lying free in the interstitium in the absence of Virchow cells or focal collections of foamy macrophages. Two of the patients had a recent diagnosis of lepromatous leprosy by skin biopsy; the third patient had a 33-year history of lepromatous leprosy that had been treated. Bone marrow aspirates were performed in all three patients for evaluation of anemia. The findings indicate that the bone marrow may act as a reservoir for viable organisms in the absence of a host response in treated and untreated patients with lepromatous leprosy. The persistence of viable organisms in the bone marrow in patients with lepromatous leprosy may account for the high rate of relapse and/or recrudescence of the disease following cessation of specific therapy. Bone marrow examination with the Fite modification of the acid-fast stain is therefore indicated in such patients to evaluate bone marrow involvement and the efficacy of treatment.\r"

During this time, newer imaging techniques, especially ultrasonography and computed tomography, facilitated the prompt diagnosis of cystic lesions within the liver parenchyma. The incidence of pyogenic liver abscess at our institution (25 per 100,000 pediatric hospital admissions) was higher than previously reported. Since the majority of abscesses were located in the right lobe of the liver, patients were most effectively treated with percutaneous drainage of the abscess cavity. Staphylococcus aureus was the most common bacterial agent responsible for pyogenic liver abscess; however, anaerobic organisms were noted as a major group of pathogens and represented 27% of our patients. Furthermore, one patient was discovered to have multiple microabscesses of the liver associated with cat-scratch disease; pleomorphic gram-negative bacilli were not cultured. Among the 109 patients, the overall mortality of 15% was considerably better than that for children with PLA before 1975. The improved survival may be related to more prompt diagnosis of pyogenic liver abscess followed by evacuation of the liver abscess and antibiotic therapy.\r"

  ".W": "We have studied 34 Becker and 160 Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) patients with the dystrophin cDNA, using conventional blots and FIGE analysis. One hundred twenty-eight mutations (65%) were found, 115 deletions and 13 duplications, of which 106 deletions and 11 duplications could be precisely mapped in relation to both the mRNA and the major and minor mutation hot spots. Junction fragments, ideal markers for carrier detection, were found in 23 (17%) of the 128 cases. We identified eight new cDNA RFLPs within the DMD gene. With the use of cDNA probes we have completed the long-range map of the DMD gene, by the identification of a 680-kb SfiI fragment containing the gene's 3' end. The size of the DMD gene is now determined to be about 2.3 million basepairs. The combination of cDNA hybridizations with long-range analysis of deletion and duplication patients yields a global picture of the exon spacing within the dystrophin gene. The gene shows a large variability of intron size, ranging from only a few kilobases to 160-180 kb for the P20 intron.\r"

Patients were observed initially, every three to four days during therapy, and weekly during the post-therapy period. Observations that were recorded included graded chest symptoms and physical findings, vital signs, hematologic parameters, and objective sputum measurements (daily volume, purulence, differential quantitative cytology, bacterial counts, and physical properties). Both antibiotic regimens were effective in resolving these acute bacterial exacerbations. Paired t test analysis revealed that ciprofloxacin is as clinically effective as ampicillin in the treatment of acute bacterial exacerbations in chronic bronchial disease, and appears to be superior in clearing bacterial pathogens from the sputum.\r"

  ".W": "The efficacy and safety of intravenous ciprofloxacin was compared with intravenous ceftazidime in 80 hospitalized patients with lower respiratory tract infection. There were 40 patients in each treatment group. Patients and physicians were blinded to the randomized scheme for treatment groups until patient consent was obtained. The 37 evaluable ciprofloxacin-treated patients received 200 mg every 12 hours intravenously as initial therapy and 29 completed their course receiving oral ciprofloxacin. The 34 evaluable ceftazidime-treated patients received 1 to 2 g intravenously every eight to 12 hours. The two groups did not differ with respect to patient age, infection severity, and admitting diagnosis. Clinical outcomes were similar with greater than 95 percent of treatments in each group being successful. Headache was the most commonly reported complaint (four patients) in the ciprofloxacin group. Three patients experienced substantial increases in serum theophylline concentrations while receiving ciprofloxacin. The predominant pathogens isolated were Haemophilus influenzae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and susceptibility rates for all organisms were similar for both drugs. The mean peak serum concentration at steady state while receiving intravenous ciprofloxacin was 2.3 micrograms/ml, and the mean trough concentration was 0.5 micrograms/ml. Patients randomly assigned to ciprofloxacin therapy received 2.6 fewer days of intravenous antibiotic therapy than those receiving ceftazidime. This 80-patient comparative trial demonstrates that ciprofloxacin and ceftazidime are similar in efficacy and safety when treating gram-negative lower respiratory tract infections. There appears to be potential for cost-reducing benefits through decreased length of intravenous therapy and earlier hospital discharge.\r"

Ciprofloxacin eradicated 36 of 46 (78 percent) pathogens and ceftazidime 21 of 29 (72 percent) pathogens. Superinfections occurred in nine of 32 (28 percent) ciprofloxacin patients and in two of 19 (11 percent) ceftazidime patients (0.01 less than p less than 0.05). Adverse reactions requiring cessation of therapy occurred in two of 32 (6 percent) ciprofloxacin patients and in one of 19 (5 percent) ceftazidime patients. There was one death in each group; neither was due to the infection or antimicrobial therapy. Chronic infection was a significant risk factor for failure in both groups. Ciprofloxacin was as effective and safe as ceftazidime for serious infections of the skin and skin structure.\r"

Patients received ciprofloxacin 200 mg intravenously every 12 hours or ceftazidime 2 g intravenously every eight hours, with placebo infusions to maintain blinding. Therapy with metronidazole was added for suspected or documented intra-abdominal infection. Thirty-two of the 57 ciprofloxacin-treated patients were evaluable for determination of efficacy and had 41 bacterial isolates from 34 sites. Thirty-six of the 56 ceftazidime patients were evaluable for determination of efficacy and had 41 bacterial isolates from 38 sites. Seven of 35 bacteremic patients had no identifiable primary focus. The most commonly isolated pathogens were Escherichia coli, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Cure rates and bacteriologic eradication rates were comparable. Nine patients did not improve. Patients with treatment failures in the ciprofloxacin group included a quadriplegic patient with relapse of urinary tract infection with bacteremia (K. pneumoniae). Another patient with bacteremia (Pseudomonas aeruginosa), pneumonia (Proteus vulgaris), and urinary tract infection (P. vulgaris, Providencia sp.) died on the first treatment day. The third patient (S. aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae pneumonia) had a new aspiration pneumonia develop on the third day; the pneumococcus also persisted. Undrained S. pneumoniae empyema caused the fourth ciprofloxacin treatment failure, and the fifth patient had a relapse of S. aureus pneumonia with bacteremia. One ceftazidime-treated patient died of pneumococcal pneumonia on the first day. Another had persistent Staphylococcus epidermidis and Listeria bacteremia despite 48 hours of treatment. Two other patients had pneumonia (S. aureus and P. aeruginosa, respectively) and completed full courses of ceftazidime therapy without improvement. Five patients had pneumococcal bacteremia; four patients were cured: one of two patients in the ciprofloxacin group and three of three patients in the ceftazidime group. Significant increases in the number of platelets (four patients with ciprofloxacin treatment, one patient with ceftazidime treatment) and declines in the number of platelets (one patient with ciprofloxacin treatment, one patient with ceftazidime treatment) were observed. Intravenously administered ciprofloxacin is comparable with ceftazidime and is a safe and effective antibiotic for the treatment of patients with serious infections, including bacteremia.\r"

Thirty-two patients (16 patients receiving ciprofloxacin and 16 patients receiving ceftazidime) with 38 infections caused by susceptible Pseudomonas aeruginosa, enteric gram-negative rods, Salmonella group B, Serratia marcescens, Pseudomonas cepacia, and Xanthomonas maltophilia at various sites were evaluable for determination of efficacy. Length of therapy varied from seven to 25 days. Concomitant antimicrobials included intravenously administered beta-lactams for gram-positive organisms, intravenous/oral metronidazole and clindamycin for anaerobes, and intravenous/local amphotericin B for Candida albicans. Intravenous administration of 200 mg ciprofloxacin every 12 hours to 11 patients produced peak serum levels between 1.15 and 3.12 micrograms/ml; trough levels ranged between 0.08 and 0.86 micrograms/ml. Overall response rates were similar for patients receiving ciprofloxacin and ceftazidime. Emergence of resistance was similar in both groups--one Enterobacter cloacae and two P. aeruginosa became resistant after ciprofloxacin therapy and two P. aeruginosa became resistant after ceftazidime therapy. The frequency of superinfection with a variety of organisms was also similar in both groups. Adverse events related to ciprofloxacin included transient pruritus at the infusion site and generalized rash leading to drug discontinuation (one patient each), and with ceftazidime adverse effects included pain at the site of infusion and the development of allergic interstitial nephritis (one patient each). Overall, intravenous/oral ciprofloxin therapy appears to be as safe and effective as intravenous ceftazidime therapy in the treatment of a variety of infections due to susceptible aerobic gram-negative organisms.\r"

Male and female inpatients 18 years or older had bacterial infections of the blood, skin or skin/structure, intra-abdominal region, lower respiratory tract, or urinary tract (considered complicated) caused by organisms susceptible to both ciprofloxacin and ceftazidime. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either ciprofloxacin 200 mg intravenously every 12 hours or ceftazidime 0.5 to 2 g intravenously every eight to 12 hours. Clinical evaluations were performed daily during therapy and within five to nine days after therapy was complete. For patients with urinary tract infection, urine for culture was obtained during (Day 3 or 4) and after (five to nine days and three to five weeks) therapy. A total of 86 patients were enrolled into the study. Forty-three received ciprofloxacin and 43 received ceftazidime. There were 22 evaluable patients in the ciprofloxacin group with 24 infection sites: skin/skin structure (eight), respiratory tract (nine), blood (two), urinary tract (five). In the ceftazidime group, there were 26 evaluable patients with 29 infection sites: skin/skin structure (15), respiratory tract (nine), blood (three), and urinary tract (two). The mean duration of therapy with ciprofloxacin and ceftazidime was 7.5 days (range, four to 28 days) and 8.4 days (range, three to 25 days), respectively. Bacteriologic eradication of the causative organisms occurred at 17 infection sites (70.8 percent) in the ciprofloxacin-treated patients and 21 infection sites (72.4 percent) in the ceftazidime group. Clinically, resolution or improvement in signs/symptoms was demonstrated in 22 patients (91.7 percent) in the ciprofloxacin group and 26 patients (89.7 percent) in the ceftazidime group. Bacteriologic response (by organism) and overall response were comparable in both groups. All enrolled patients were evaluated for determination of safety. Adverse events considered possibly or probably related to the study drugs were reported in 16 of 43 patients (37.2 percent) in the ciprofloxacin group and four of 43 patients (9.3 percent) in the ceftazidime group. Ciprofloxacin and ceftazidime were equally efficacious in the treatment of selected infections, but ciprofloxacin was associated with a higher incidence of adverse reactions probably or possibly related to drug administration. Further studies with larger sample sizes in selected patient populations will be required to identify differences in efficacy among the two antibiotics.\r"

All evaluable subjects (39 patients) had documented infections, 23 percent of which were associated with bacteremia. The mean/median duration of intravenous antibiotic use for ciprofloxacin was 7.37/five days and for ceftazidime 9.95/seven days; 63 percent of the ciprofloxacin patients received an additional 17 days of oral therapy with ciprofloxacin, whereas intravenous therapy with ceftazidime was followed by an average of 12 days of an oral regimen in 55 percent of patients. Overall response rates for patients receiving ciprofloxacin and ceftazidime were 76 percent (16 of 21) and 82 percent (18 of 22), respectively. Four out of five bacteremias in each group were successfully treated. Overall, 69 percent of the pathogens were gram-negative aerobes, and 47 percent of the infections involved the urinary tract. Failure of therapy was most often associated with pneumonia (two of five failures with ciprofloxacin and three of four failures with ceftazidime). Adverse effects occurred in approximately 20 percent of patients in each group and were mild and reversible. Superinfections occurred in five of 19 (26 percent) ciprofloxacin recipients and seven of 20 (35 percent) ceftazidime recipients. All fungal superinfections involved the genitourinary tract and occurred most often in association with chronic indwelling catheters. Enterococcal superinfections occurred in both groups (a bacteremic urinary tract infection in a ceftazidime patient and osteomyelitis in a ciprofloxacin patient). Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea was documented in a ceftazidime recipient. The mean duration of hospitalization following the onset of antibiotic treatment was 10.45 days in the ciprofloxacin group and 12.95 days in the ceftazidime group. Sequential intravenous/oral ciprofloxacin was as safe and effective as intravenous ceftazidime in the treatment of infections due to susceptible gram-positive and gram-negative organisms.\r"

A total of 52 patients received intravenous ciprofloxacin 200 mg twice daily (26 patients) or ceftazidime 1 to 2 g every eight to 12 hours (26 patients). This was followed, respectively, by oral ciprofloxacin or another suitable drug when improvement was seen. Informed consent was obtained from all patients. Cultures and laboratory determinations were performed initially and repeated periodically as indicated. Both groups were comparable in age, sex, number of infected sites, and instance of nosocomial infections (27 total). Severe infections occurred in six ciprofloxacin and 12 ceftazidime patients (p = 0.056). There were 13 patients in the ciprofloxacin group and six in the ceftazidime group with accompanying diseases (p = 0.032). Patients were treated with ciprofloxacin or ceftazidime for infections of the urinary tract (eight and two patients, respectively), skin or soft tissues (15 and 17 patients), pelvis (one and zero patients), lower respiratory tract (one and one patients), intra-abdominal (zero and three patients), and bacteremia (three and five patients). Two patients in each group had two sites of infection. Causative organisms were as follows: 15 gram-positive cocci (90 percent minimal inhibitory concentration: ciprofloxacin, 0.5; ceftazidime, 16.0 micrograms/ml) and 55 gram-negative rods (44 Enterobacteriaceae, nine Pseudomonas aeruginosa; 90 percent minimal inhibitory concentration: ciprofloxacin, 0.25; ceftazidime, 8.0 micrograms/ml). Resistance emerged in one patient treated with ciprofloxacin (Acinetobacter sp.) and 12 treated with ceftazidime (four Enterococcus, two Staphylococcus aureus, six other). Intravenous treatment was longer with ceftazidime (11.5 days versus 5.6 days for the ciprofloxacin group, p less than 0.0005), but the total duration of therapy was similar (12.9 versus 14.1 days, p value not significant). Resolution or improvement occurred in 23 ciprofloxacin and 26 ceftazidime sites of infection (p value not significant). Death occurred in two ceftazidime-treated patients (due to bacterial infection) and one ciprofloxacin-treated patient (at the induction of anesthesia). Adverse experiences were more common in the ceftazidime group as compared with the ciprofloxacin group (22 versus 15 patients, p = 0.026). Ciprofloxacin eradicated 25 of 31 causative organisms, whereas ceftazidime eradicated 30 of 41 (p value not significant). Intravenous ciprofloxacin was at least as effective as ceftazidime. Patients treated with ciprofloxacin may need added coverage for anaerobes, but the drug's excellent activity against nosocomial pathogens and its availability in oral form allow for an early change to oral therapy without compromising effectiveness coupled with added savings and convenience.\r"

  ".U": "90072175\r", 
  ".W": "Ciprofloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone, is a potent, broad-spectrum antibacterial agent. It rapidly blocks bacterial deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) replication by inhibiting DNA gyrase, an essential prokaryotic enzyme that catalyzes chromosomal DNA supercoiling. Molecular genetic approaches have been used to study the interaction of 4-quinolones with DNA gyrase from quinolone-sensitive strains and from uropathogenic quinolone-resistant clinical isolates of Escherichia coli. An important mutational locus in the gyrase A gene that confers resistance to ciprofloxacin and other quinolones has been identified, and a new, rapid method to examine clinical isolates for the presence of mutations at this position has been devised. A quinolone resistant gyrA gene has been previously cloned and sequenced from an E. coli clinical isolate. Genetic analysis indicated that resistance resulted from a Ser-83----Trp change in the 875 residue gyrase A protein: two other changes observed in the protein, Asp-678----Glu and Ala-828----Ser, were neutral. GyrA genes carrying these mutations have now been expressed, corresponding mutant gyrase A proteins purified, and their quinolone resistance properties tested by complementing with gyrase B protein and studying the resulting gyrase activity in an adenosine triphosphate-dependent DNA supercoiling assay. The in vitro DNA supercoiling activity of the A (Ser-83----Trp) mutant subunit complemented with wild-type gyrase B subunit was highly resistant to ciprofloxacin and other 4-quinolones. In contrast, A subunit carrying codon 678 and 828 changes reconstituted a quinolone-sensitive gyrase activity. Thus, quinolone-resistant gyrase A proteins may be readily obtained for study by using high-copy gyrA plasmids. In addition, other quinolone-resistant strains of E. coli have been examined for the presence of mutations at gyrase A codons 82 and 83 using a new analytical method based on a restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP). This analysis revealed that seven of eight resistant clinical isolates of E. coli examined carried gyrA mutations at codon 82 or 83, whereas five sensitive strains appeared to possess wild-type sequence. Thus, mutations at codon 83 (and possibly 82) in the gyrA gene frequently confer resistance to 4-quinolones, including ciprofloxacin. The RFLP method described should prove useful in examining strains for such mutations. These results are discussed with regard to the mode of interaction of the 4-quinolones with gyrase.\r"

  ".W": "Oral ciprofloxacin has been shown to be effective in the treatment of infections due to gram-positive cocci and gram-negative rods. The efficacy and safety of intravenous ciprofloxacin was compared with that of intravenous ceftazidime in the treatment of 59 patients with well-documented serious infections in a prospective, controlled, randomized study with a third-party blinding. Thirty-three patients were treated with intravenous ciprofloxacin (200 mg every 12 hours, plus a daily extra placebo dose); 26 patients were treated with ceftazidime (1 g every eight hours). The severity of the infections, underlying diseases, and demographic features were comparable in both groups, although there were more men in the ciprofloxacin group. For ciprofloxacin/ceftazidime treatments, respectively, the evaluated infections were: pyelonephritis (16 patients/nine patients), pneumonia (three/five), soft-tissue infections (four/zero), spontaneous peritonitis (five/two), primary bacteremia (three/eight), and other (two/two). Isolated pathogens included: Escherichia coli (22/12), Klebsiella sp. (five/four), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (two/three), Haemophilus influenzae (one/one), Proteus mirabilis (two/zero), Proteus vulgaris (one/zero), Salmonella sp. (zero/two), Plesiomonas shigelloides (one/zero), and others (one/four). The clinical responses were cure or improvement in 31 ciprofloxacin cases/21 ceftazidime cases; failure, zero/four; and indeterminate, two/one. The bacteriologic responses were eradication in 28 ciprofloxacin cases/22 ceftazidime cases; persistence, one/three; and indeterminate, four/one. Mild intolerance occurred in three ciprofloxacin cases and two ceftazidime cases. A mild increase in serum hepatic enzymes was observed in two patients in each group. Superinfections occurred in five patients: enterococcal septicemia (zero/two) and urinary tract infections (one/two). The results presented suggest that intravenous ciprofloxacin is an effective and safe antimicrobial agent for the treatment of serious infections, with an efficacy comparable with that of ceftazidime, a broad-spectrum cephalosporin. An additional advantage seems to be a lower rate of superinfections.\r"

(23 patients), other gram-negative bacilli (five patients), staphylococci (19 patients), other gram-positive cocci (seven patients), and Rickettsia conorii (five patients). Thirty-eight patients were given parenteral therapy (ciprofloxacin at a mean daily dose of 200 mg every 12 hours, mean duration of therapy, nine days). Fifty-six patients were also given ciprofloxacin orally after initial intravenous therapy at a dose of either 500 or 750 mg every 12 hours (mean duration of therapy, 36 days). Another antibiotic was given concomitantly in 25 cases (27 percent). The overall clinical response was 93 percent and the bacteriologic response rate was 84 percent. There was no difference between patients treated by intravenous ciprofloxacin and those treated by intravenous ciprofloxacin followed by oral ciprofloxacin. Favorable responses (resolution of improvement) were observed in 39 of 42 patients (93 percent) with bacteremia, 28 of 30 (93 percent) with urinary tract infection, 10 of 13 (77 percent) with respiratory tract infection, 11 of 12 (92 percent) with bone and joint infection, three of three (100 percent) with skin and soft-tissue infection, nine of nine (100 percent) with intra-abdominal infection, three of three (100 percent) with typhoid fever, and two of two (100 percent) with meningitis. All five patients with R. conorii infections had a response to therapy. The adverse effects were minor and transient. Seven patients experienced clinical adverse effects: pain at the injection site (three patients), rash (two patients), and headache (2 patients). Serum transaminase levels were increased in 11 patients. Intravenously administered ciprofloxacin or intravenous ciprofloxacin followed by oral ciprofloxacin is a safe and effective therapy for serious infections.\r"

One hundred six men with genitourinary tract obstruction were enrolled in the study. The 102 men evaluable for determination of efficacy (53 in the ciprofloxacin group and 49 in the cefotaxime group) received a single intravenous infusion of either 300 mg ciprofloxacin or 1,000 mg of cefotaxime prior to resection of the prostate for benign prostatic hypertrophy and prostatic carcinoma or internal urethrotomy for urethral stricture. A mean of 32.1 and 40.3 minutes for the ciprofloxacin and cefotaxime groups, respectively, elapsed between the end of the intravenous infusion and the onset of surgery; all but one patient in the ciprofloxacin group underwent catheterization after surgery, of which the mean duration was 3.7 days for both groups. At the time of hospital discharge, patients were evaluated clinically; 50 patients in the ciprofloxacin group (94 percent) and 45 in the cefotaxime group (92 percent) had no bacteriologic evidence of genitourinary tract infection. At follow-up two to six weeks after surgery for the patients with no bacteriologic evidence of genitourinary tract infection, fewer patients in the ciprofloxacin group (8 percent) than in the cefotaxime group (16 percent) remained without evidence of infection. Both drugs were well tolerated. This study demonstrated that a single intravenous dose of ciprofloxacin was as effective as a single dose of cefotaxime in reducing the incidence of infection following transurethral surgical procedures.\r"

A prospective, randomized, single-center efficacy and safety comparison was conducted of intravenous ciprofloxacin, 200 mg every 12 hours, and ceftazidime, 2 g every eight hours, as initial empirical therapy in neutropenic patients with fever. Regimens were modified as necessary, guided by laboratory results and/or the clinical condition. Response was evaluated at 72 hours and at the end of the neutropenia. Toxicity was evaluated by regular clinical examination and laboratory investigations. A total of 43 patients with 51 febrile neutropenic episodes were enrolled into the study and randomly assigned to one of the two regimens. Five episodes were excluded from evaluation of efficacy because of protocol violations, leaving 46 evaluable episodes (21 ciprofloxacin, 25 ceftazidime). The two groups were well matched for risk factors for infection. There were no differences between the two groups in response rates either at 72 hours or at the end of neutropenia, although in the vast majority of patients some modification of the initial therapy was required. No patients died of uncontrolled bacterial infection. Superinfection with gram-positive cocci (often streptococci) was seen primarily in bone marrow transplant recipients who had been randomly assigned to receive ciprofloxacin. This study demonstrated that, in certain circumstances, a single antibiotic can be used successfully as initial empirical therapy in febrile neutropenic patients. In this study, ceftazidime and ciprofloxacin were generally of equal efficacy, but there appeared to be an increased incidence of streptococcal superinfection in bone marrow transplant recipients who received ciprofloxacin.\r"

In addition, the efficacy of early conversion from intravenous therapy to orally administered ciprofloxacin was compared with that of continued ceftazidime plus amikacin. Seventy-one oncology patients with 79 episodes of fever and neutropenia were randomly assigned to receive initial empiric antibiotic therapy with either intravenously administered ciprofloxacin and azlocillin followed by orally administered ciprofloxacin (regimen 1, 25 episodes); ceftazidime and amikacin (regimen 2, 30 episodes); or ceftazidime and amikacin followed by oral ciprofloxacin (regimen 3, 24 episodes). Microbiologically documented infections were the cause of fever in 10 (40 percent), seven (23 percent), and nine (38 percent) episodes in regimens 1, 2, and 3, respectively, including six, five, and four episodes of bacteremia. Patient survival was 90 to 92 percent in each regimen; however, some modification of antimicrobial therapy occurred in 65, 44, and 41 percent of surviving patients in regimens 1, 2, and 3, respectively. The rate of clearance of initial bacteremia was 67 percent (four of six) in regimen 1, 100 percent (five of five) in regimen 2 and 50 percent (two of four) in regimen 3. Patients in regimens 1 and 3 were able to convert to orally administered ciprofloxacin in 32 (65 percent) of 49 episodes after a mean of six days of intravenous therapy. Superinfections occurred in 24, 10, and 12 percent of patients receiving regimens 1, 2, and 3, respectively, and occurred similarly for patients receiving orally administered ciprofloxacin, 12 percent (four of 32), and intravenous therapy, 17 percent (eight of 47). Parenteral ciprofloxacin was generally well tolerated. One (4 percent) of 25 patients receiving regimen 1 experienced oto- or nephrotoxicity, compared with eight (15 percent) of 54 patients receiving regimens 1, 2, and 3 (p = 0.15), including three patients who required premature termination of aminoglycoside therapy. Our data suggest that the combination of ciprofloxacin and azlocillin is an effective alternative to ceftazidime and amikacin for the initial empiric therapy of febrile neutropenic patients, is generally well tolerated, and avoids the oto- and nephrotoxicity associated with aminoglycoside use. In addition, a majority of patients could change to orally administered ciprofloxacin alone after six days of parenteral therapy.\r"

Subsequent studies have investigated the mechanisms of these interactions. With respect to the effect of antacids, the absorption of all quinolones appears to be significantly reduced by antacids containing magnesium and/or aluminum, and concomitant administration must be avoided. Other cations, such as calcium, iron, and probably zinc, appear to interact in a similar manner. Chelation between the quinolone and cation is the most likely mechanism. With respect to the effect on theophylline metabolism, quinolones inhibit specific cytochrome P-450 isozymes responsible for metabolism of methylxanthines, although there are major differences between the quinolones. Enoxacin is the most potent inhibitor, followed by ciprofloxacin, pefloxacin, norfloxacin, and ofloxacin. Caffeine metabolism is also inhibited, although the clinical significance is uncertain. Case reports describe renal failure associated with concomitant administration of cyclosporine and ciprofloxacin, although controlled trials have not demonstrated an interaction. Enoxacin has little effect on warfarin metabolism, suggesting that other quinolones may not affect warfarin disposition. Case reports of central nervous system toxicity from administration of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents and quinolones need confirmation. Patients should be monitored closely when potential interacting agents are used; it is probable that not all interactions have been identified.\r"

An overwhelming majority had at least one accompanying systemic illness, and the condition of more than half the patients was only fair or poor at the onset of therapy. Ciprofloxacin was administered in a unit dose of either 200 mg (68 percent of the patients) or 300 mg (28 percent) by intravenous infusion, generally over 30 minutes every 12 hours, at a mean daily dosage of 456 mg. The duration of intravenous therapy ranged from one to 57 days, with a mean of seven days; over 1,000 patients were treated for more than five days. Adverse events considered probably or possibly related to intravenous ciprofloxacin were reported in 15.8 percent of the courses; therapy was discontinued prematurely in 3 percent. Local reactions at the site of infusion were the most common, occurring in 4.4 percent of the courses. Changes in blood chemistry values (4.1 percent) included increases in alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and alkaline phosphatase. Reports of adverse effects referable to the gastrointestinal tract (3.0 percent) were primarily nausea and diarrhea. Central nervous system reactions (1.8 percent) included convulsive seizures, headache, and dizziness. In comparative trials, events considered probably or possibly drug related were reported for 17.3 and 13.6 percent of the ciprofloxacin- and ceftazidime-treated patients, respectively. The incidence of adverse events other than local reactions at the infusion site was not significantly different between the ciprofloxacin- and ceftazidime-treated patients (12.7 percent versus 11.0 percent, p greater than 0.2).\r"

A 600-mg daily dose of ciprofloxacin was used mostly in Japan (2,341 patients). The daily dose of 1,000 mg was administered chiefly in the United States and Europe (2,288 patients). The age of the patients ranged from less than one year to 99 years (mean, 50.6 years). More than 38 percent were older than 60 years. According to COSTART terminology, the following drug-related side effects were observed in the different organ systems: digestive, 4.9 percent; metabolic-nutritional, 4.4 percent; central nervous system, 1.5 percent, skin, 1.1 percent; hemic and lymphatic, 0.9 percent; urogenital, 0.8 percent; body as a whole, 0.5 percent; cardiovascular, 0.2 percent; special senses, 0.2 percent; musculoskeletal, 0.1 percent; and respiratory, 0.1 percent. Several patients had more than one reaction. The total incidence of side effects for the treated patients was 9.3 percent. The vast majority of adverse reactions were mild or moderate (94 percent). Serious side effects were reported for 55 patients (6 percent). Based on the 9,473 courses, the incidence of severe reactions was 0.6 percent. Ciprofloxacin treatment was discontinued due to side effects in 146 patients (1.5 percent), mostly due to gastrointestinal reactions (80 patients). The worldwide data from clinical trials with oral ciprofloxacin clearly demonstrate that the drug is relatively safe, and the side effects are usually mild or moderate in intensity and are reversible.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: Despite conflicting experimental and clinical evidence, diphenylhydantoin continues to be used for the treatment of alcohol withdrawal seizures in emergency departments and alcohol detoxification centers. Our goal was to evaluate the effectiveness of intravenous diphenylhydantoin for prevention of alcohol withdrawal seizures in high-risk patients using a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study design. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Ninety alcoholic patients, enrolled within six hours of the initial alcohol-related seizure in a withdrawal episode, were randomly assigned to treatment with intravenous diphenylhydantoin (1,000 mg) or placebo. Seventy-one patients had a history of seizures during prior alcohol withdrawal episodes. Patients with a history of seizures unrelated to alcohol withdrawal were excluded. Drugs known to affect the seizure threshold or demonstrating cross-tolerance with alcohol were withheld. For each patient, the study endpoint was either (1) seizure recurrence or (2) a minimum 12-hour seizure-free observation period after completion of the study drug infusion. RESULTS: During the postinfusion observation period, six of 45 diphenylhydantoin-treated patients and six of 45 placebo-treated patients experienced at least one recurrent seizure. Equivalent diphenylhydantoin serum levels were measured in patients with and without subsequent seizures. There was no statistically significant difference between the response rates for the two treatments (p greater than 0.05). The 95% confidence interval for the difference in response probabilities was -14.0%, 14%. CONCLUSION: When administered to non-epileptic patients within six hours of the onset of alcohol withdrawal seizures, intravenous diphenylhydantoin failed to show a significant benefit over placebo in the prevention of subsequent seizures. We suggest that the well-documented risks of intravenous diphenylhydantoin therapy outweigh the potential benefit in the short-term treatment of alcohol withdrawal seizures.\r"

Pulmonary barotrauma, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, pulmonary hemorrhage, obliterative bronchiolitis, asthma, and pulmonary edema have all recently been described. The number of reports are few, reflecting either the low incidence of these complications or the lack of recognition of these phenomena as cocaine-related illnesses. The mechanism by which freebase cocaine can injure the lung is not well defined. Whether an abnormal immunologic response to cocaine freebase can result in hemorrhage, pneumonitis, bronchiolitis, or asthma remains speculative. Whether cardiogenic or non-cardiogenic factors play a role in the development of pulmonary edema in freebase smokers has not yet been determined. Likewise, the roles of either cocaine, tobacco, or adulterants in producing the observed abnormalities of lung function remain controversial. Further reporting of freebase-related pulmonary complications, as well as the development of appropriate animal models, is needed.\r"

Women with hyperphenylalaninemia and those with phenylketonuria diagnosed and treated at birth are intellectually normal, as are some women with undiagnosed phenylketonuria. Both groups are at risk for maternal phenylketonuria syndrome in their offspring if blood phenylalanine levels are not controlled by diet during pregnancy. The problems and pitfalls of suspecting, diagnosing, and managing the condition are discussed. Suggested strategies for reversing the increasing trend include the greater use of genetic registers, increased clinical awareness, and some form of rescreening. The advantages and costs of rescreening a subset of pregnant women or all pregnant women at or before their first registration are examined.\r"

We examined the influence of the stage of the menstrual cycle on the cellular immune response to Candida albicans, the efficiency of C. albicans germination in sera, and the ability of products from activated lymphoid cells to inhibit germination. C. albicans germination was maximal in sera obtained during the luteal phase. During this period the cellular immune response to Candida was reduced as was the inhibition of Candida germination by products of activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Variations in immune response to Candida were of much lesser magnitude in women who took oral contraceptives, which suggests that it was the marked fluctuation in progesterone or estradiol levels during the menstrual cycle that influenced the changes in the immune response to C. albicans. Thus the hormonal status of women may influence the pathogenicity of C. albicans by modulation of immune system activity. These results explain the clinical observation that candidal vaginitis infections most frequently reappear before menstruation.\r"

The extent of follicular growth and maturation, the incidence of escape ovulation, and the effect of correct and incorrect pill intake were assessed in 30 evaluable women during two consecutive spontaneous menstrual cycles. After the first cycle, 11 of 30 women (36.6%) had follicle-like structures of at least 10 mm in diameter. Ten of 11 structures gradually disappeared during the second cycle, with one persistent structure remaining through the second cycle. Seven of 30 women (23%) developed follicle-like structures during the second cycle. Of these, one woman had a probable ovulation, and another had an elevated progesterone level without follicle rupture, suggesting the luteinized unruptured follicle syndrome. Both of these women missed a pill on day 1 of the second cycle. In all cases cervical scores indicating hostility were noted. Thus, although suppression of ovarian activity may have been incomplete when oral contraceptives were incorrectly taken, secondary mechanisms of contraception remained operant. When they were correctly taken, low-dose triphasic oral contraception consistently prevented ovulation.\r"

The malformation rate in White Classes B to F was remarkably constant from 1967 to 1981, but a significant decrease in major congenital malformations was found in the period 1982 to 1986 versus 1977 to 1981 (2.7% vs. 7.4%, p less than 0.05). This decrease was mainly due to a fourfold decline in major congenital malformations in White Classes D and F (p less than 0.01), and consequently a correlation between the severity of maternal diabetes and the frequency of congenital malformations was no longer present. In the offspring of a control group of 1715 nondiabetic women, major congenital malformations were found in 1.7% (p greater than 0.05). Seventy-five percent of the diabetic pregnancies were planned, and in these pregnancies only 1% of the infants had major congenital malformations. The frequency of fatal malformations in White Classes B to F was still significantly higher than in the control group (p less than 0.001).\r"

A high statistical correlation was found between gestational age and each of the five variables (p less than 0.001).

Probability estimates were not significantly affected by the addition of the distal femoral, proximal tibial epiphyses, placental grade, or amniotic fluid volume. From these data, probability prediction tables were generated. The results of this study provide an alternate method by which gestational age may be estimated in late pregnancy.\r"

  ".W": "The fetal pituitary gland secretes beta-endorphin in blood in response to delivery. However, other forms of endorphin have recently been observed in the fetal pituitary, such as N-acetyl-beta-endorphin, which is devoid of opiate activity, and a desacetylated form of alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone. Both endorphins originate in the pituitary intermediate lobe. The sensitivity of this lobe to labor stress was assessed by the evaluation of beta-endorphin, N-acetyl-beta-endorphin, melanocyte-stimulating hormone, and desacetylated alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone in maternal plasma and cord blood in 11 cases of vaginal delivery and 10 cases of elective cesarean section without labor. Plasma peptide levels were determined by specific radioimmunoassays after extraction on Sep-Pak C-18 cartridges and high-performance liquid chromatography fractionation. Cord blood samples of infants delivered vaginally showed higher beta-endorphin (8.5 +/- 1.6 pmol/L, mean +/- SE) and desacetylated alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (13.6 +/- 3.2 pmol/L) levels than those delivered by elective cesarean section (3.7 +/- 0.8 and 4.2 +/- 1.1 pmol/L, for beta-endorphin and desacetylated alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone, respectively). N-acetyl-beta-endorphin and alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone levels do not differ in relation to the mode of delivery. In maternal circulation beta-endorphin levels were higher in those delivered vaginally (5.2 pm 1) than in women who had cesarean sections (2.5 +/- 0.5 pmol/L), whereas no changes were found for the other peptides. In vaginal deliveries, the level of desacetylated alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone was higher in cord blood (13.6 +/- 3.2 pmol/L) than in maternal plasma (6.5 +/- 3 pmol/L); there were no significant differences with regard to the other peptides. Fetal and maternal levels of all the peptides were similar in cases of cesarean section. We conclude that parturition activates proopiomelanocortin peptide release from both the anterior and the intermediate pituitary lobe and that the fetus secretes the appropriate beta-endorphin molecule, that is, the peptide able to bind opiate receptors. Concomitant secretion of desacetylated alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone may occur with adrenal androgen activation at birth.\r"

The fetuses in eight pregnant ewes underwent maternal aortic and umbilical cord constrictions producing serial blood flow reductions. Occlusion of the umbilical cord and maternal aorta caused distinctly different waveforms. Cord occlusion produced an immediate response with an elevated systolic/diastolic ratio and disappearance of diastolic velocity. Maternal aortic occlusion produced a delayed response with drops in both systolic and diastolic velocity; diastolic velocity never reached zero. Although systolic/diastolic ratios are believed to reflect placental resistance, the maintenance of the systolic/diastolic ratio with diminution of systolic velocity suggests declining fetal cardiac output as an additional factor. It is possible to differentiate uteroplacental from umbilicoplacental insufficiency by Doppler methods. With technologic improvements Doppler ultrasonography may allow better analysis of acute stressful conditions during human labor.\r"

  ".W": "Evidence from autoradiographic studies with 1,25(OH)2-vitamin D3 (vitamin D, soltriol) labeled with tritium and from the literature indicates that the steroid hormone soltriol regulates and modulates reproductive processes in the female, as it does in the male. Nuclear receptors for soltriol have been discovered in the uterus, oviduct, ovary, mammary gland, placenta, and fetal membranes, as well as in the pituitary and hypothalamus. Soltriol is recognized as a transducer and hormonal messenger of sunlight, acting as a somatotropic activator and modulator of vital processes for the seasonal and estival adaptation of growth, development, and procreation. Its influence on calcium equilibrium is just one of its many functions to serve this goal. This article reviews experimental, clinical, and epidemiologic evidence that suggests the involvement of soltriol in the control of reproductive processes, noting its importance for the onset of puberty, fertility, pregnancy, lactation, and probably sexual behavior. Cooperative actions between soltriol and other steroid hormones, especially estradiol, are pointed out.\r"

  ".W": "Although the majority of American women believe that oral contraceptives can cause serious health problems such as cancer or heart disease, the scientific literature does not support these beliefs. Oral contraceptives actually protect against endometrial and ovarian cancer. The increased incidence of cardiovascular disease in oral contraceptive users, including myocardial infarction, appears to be caused by thrombosis and not atherosclerosis. The studies suggesting an increased risk of cardiovascular disease in oral contraceptive users were published in the late 1970s and therefore used a data base of women ingesting formulations containing 50 micrograms of estrogen or more. More recently published data involving healthy women taking mainly lower estrogen dose preparations suggest that there is no increased incidence of myocardial infarction or stroke. Nearly all published studies indicate that there is no increased risk of myocardial infarction in former users of oral contraceptives. Animal data actually suggest that oral contraceptives may have a protective effect against atherosclerosis, even in the presence of lowered high-density lipoprotein levels. The low-dose triphasic and monophasic formulations are effective, safe methods of contraception that can be used by most healthy women of reproductive age.\r"

They are medicine's closest approximation to the controlled experiments of the laboratory scientist. These studies prevent selection bias and minimize ascertainment bias. In addition, they are statistically efficient. There have been few randomized clinical trials comparing the metabolic effects and adverse drug experiences of low-dose oral contraceptives. Previous studies conducted with oral contraceptives containing higher doses of estrogen (equivalent to greater than 50 micrograms of ethinyl estradiol) may not be relevant today when low-dose preparations are more widely used. For this reason a randomized trial was conducted to compare three multiphasic oral contraceptives marketed in the United States.\r"

The control group consisted of 49 patients using nonhormonal forms of birth control. Eighty-eight percent (181/206) of the patients completed all four visits and were considered evaluable for subsequent analyses.\r"

A control group consisting of 49 women taking a nonhormonal form of contraception was also included. After 6 months of oral contraceptive treatment, significant increases in plasma triglyceride (28% to 52%) and plasma apolipoprotein B levels (20% to 23%) were observed in each treatment group. The changes in total plasma cholesterol (3% to 10%) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol values (0% to 11%) were less striking. Changes in total high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were statistically insignificant (-2% to -4%); however, high-density lipoprotein2 cholesterol levels decreased by 29% to 33% and high-density lipoprotein3 cholesterol levels increased by 20% to 23%. Concomitantly, plasma apoliporprotein A-1 values increased by 5% to 12%.

The efficacy of oral contraceptives depends primarily on patient compliance. So-called \"nuisance\" side effects, such as intermenstrual bleeding (breakthrough bleeding or spotting), play a major role in their discontinuation. The Triphasic Randomized Clinical Trial compared the incidence of these side effects in three groups of subjects taking NET (A) (Ortho-Novum 7/7/7), LNG (Tri-Levlen), or NET (B) (Tri-Norinyl). Subjects taking NET (A) had the highest incidence of intermenstrual bleeding (63%) followed by NET (B) (44%) and LNG (33%). Only the difference between NET (A) and LNG attained statistical significance (p less than 0.030). Control subjects had no breakthrough bleeding and a 4% incidence of spotting. Further research is warranted to establish the cause of the disparity in the incidence of intermenstrual bleeding among patient groups assigned to the three oral triphasic contraceptives.\r"

Janet provided a broad framework that unifies into a larger perspective the various approaches to psychological functioning which have developed along independent lines in this century. Today his integrated approach may help clarify the interrelationships among such diverse topics as memory processes, state-dependent learning, dissociative reactions, and posttraumatic psychopathology.\r"

Object relations theory fills a niche in the biopsychosocial model but is not a complete psychology for general psychiatry. Rather, it is an addition to drive theory and ego psychology within psychoanalysis.\r"

Seventy-three aspirations were performed in 73 patients. Forty-six patients with a previously treated malignancy had aspiration to diagnose either locally recurrent or metastatic disease. The remaining 27 patients had liver aspiration to rule out metastases from suspected or unknown primary sites. Computed tomography and ultrasonography were equally effective in providing diagnostic material, which was obtained from 68 of 73 aspirates. No serious morbidity occurred. Fifty-seven patients had a metastatic or recurrent malignancy, and 3 had primary hepatocellular carcinoma. Fine-needle aspiration biopsy correctly identified 51 (85 percent) of these 60 cases. There were no false-positive results and five false-negative results. Aspiration results obviated the need for a diagnostic laparotomy in 49 of the 60 patients with malignancy (82 percent). We conclude that directed percutaneous FNA biopsy is a safe and accurate method of diagnosing recurrent and metastatic intraabdominal malignancies.\r"

However, in contrast to neonatal RDS, this deficiency generally does not represent the primary pathogenic factor. The diversity of the disorders associated with ARDS has made it impossible to develop a single-animal model that can be used to test potential therapeutic measures. The ARDS animal models that have been developed are equally diverse, and represent the wide variations in severity and time-course seen clinically. Nevertheless, almost all of the lung injury models show indications of surfactant abnormality, which is caused mainly by biophysical inhibition of surfactant activity by the large amounts of proteinaceous edema found in the injured lungs. In some cases, this surfactant dysfunction is further compounded by a quantitative surfactant deficiency brought about by metabolic alterations of the type II pneumocytes. It is important to note that all of the lung injury models studied thus far have shown significant improvements in pulmonary mechanics and arterial oxygenation after treatment with exogenous surfactant. Such results are consistent with biophysical studies that suggest that increasing the effective surfactant concentration in the lung should mitigate the effects of both quantitative and functional surfactant deficiencies. Although animal studies suggest that surfactant replacement therapy might be efficacious in ARDS, there is a good deal of experimental work that still needs to be done.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Hypertension is common following coronary artery bypass surgery. The safety of labetalol, a recently released combined alpha-1 and beta-adrenergic blocking agent for treatment of hypertension in this clinical situation is controversial. The authors compared the hemodynamic effects of labetalol with those of sodium nitroprusside (SNP) in 91 patients with good left ventricular function and equally severe coronary artery disease and in whom coronary artery bypass surgery had been just completed. They were anesthetized using fentanyl, diazepam, and enflurane. If hypertension developed postoperatively, patients were randomized to receive labetalol, 2 mg/min to a maximum of 300 mg (20 patients) or sodium nitroprusside in 0.5 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 increments by infusion (20 patients) to return blood pressure to normal. Compared with control values, labetalol brought about significant (P less than 0.05) reductions in heart rate, and cardiac index. No change was noted in stroke volume or systemic vascular resistance, but slight increases were found in central venous pressure and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. Sodium nitroprusside treatment caused significant increases in heart rate and cardiac index while reducing diastolic blood pressure, central venous pressure, and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. Stroke volume remained unchanged. Following the study period, blood pressure was controlled in all patients with SNP. Total doses of SNP in the 16 h following the study period were significantly less in the labetalol group (46.6 +/- 11.7 mg) versus (116.1 +/- 10.3 mg) in the SNP group (P less than 0.05). In this clinical circumstance, labetalol can be safe and effective for controlling hypertension, but its mechanism of achieving this effect varies from that for sodium nitroprusside.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Excitatory amino acids accumulating in the brain during ischemia may cause selective neuronal damage postischemia. This hypothesis was tested in a series of studies using MK-801, an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor blocker, in a reproducible outcome model of prolonged cardiac arrest in dogs. After normothermic ventricular fibrillation cardiac arrest, the dogs were resuscitated with closed-chest femoral veno-arterial cardiopulmonary bypass. At 4 h they were separated from bypass, ventilation was controlled for 20 h, and intensive care was continued to 96 h. In Study I, ventricular fibrilation cardiac arrest (no-flow) was 17 min; starting immediately with reperfusion, MK-801 1200 mg/kg (n = 5) or an equal volume of placebo (n = 5) was infused over 12 h in blinded, randomized fashion. In Study II, the duration of the no-flow period was reduced to 15 min, and MK-801 2400 mg.kg-1 (n = 4) or placebo (n = 4) was infused. In Study III, no-flow lasted for 15 min, and MK-801 2400 mg/kg was started 30 min before ventricular fibrillation (n = 4); comparison was with Study II controls. In all three studies, MK-801 plasma concentrations peaked at greater than 50 ng/ml and were 15-30 ng/ml over 12 h. All 22 dogs of experiments within protocol survived with severe brain damage. MK-801 delayed return of pupillary reactivity, EEG activity, consciousness, and respiration, necessitating longer periods of controlled ventilation. Neurologic deficit scores, overall performance categories, and brain and heart morphologic damage scores at 96 h did not differ between placebo and MK-801 pretreatment or post-treatment groups. These negative outcome results after prolonged cardiac arrest do not negate the hyperexcitability hypothesis of selective vulnerability, but suggest the existance of additional mechanisms of secondary brain damage.\r"

The almost revolutionary technological event that permits widespread implementation of this principle has been the development of automated external defibrillators (AEDs). The simplicity, accuracy, and safety of these devices markedly expands the range of people who can deliver early defibrillation, which includes minimally trained emergency personnel, lay and community responders, and family members of high-risk patients. Even though AEDs now approach the status of \"standard of care,\" the AED, as an example of a new technology, has not followed the classic technology paradigm: conceptualization, experimentation, dissemination, and standard of care. Instead, like many other technical innovations in emergency medicine, the development of AEDs proceeded simultaneously on many fronts, and implementation often occurred before confirmation of important subissues. AEDs may experience the life cycle of many new ideas: initial enthusiasm and widespread adoption, followed by disillusionment and rejection, and finally a mature, proper perspective. Careful implementation and continued evaluation may help emergency personnel avoid periods of disillusionment with AEDs and move steadily and uneventfully to a proper perspective.\r"

Recent technologic improvements and the development of paramedic services have led to a resurgence of emergently placed external pacemakers, particularly for patients with symptomatic bradycardias and bradyasystolic cardiac arrests in both prehospital and emergency department settings. A review of the history, mechanics, and research of external pacemakers is presented.\r"

The identification and quantification of left ventricular dysfunction by ultrasound allows effective determination of prognosis and, thus, may supplant the ECG in patient triage. Transesophageal echocardiography definitively identifies the presence of thoracic aortic dissections, and this information may be obtained more immediately than by other imaging methods. Emergency physicians should have, at a minimum, sufficient knowledge of echocardiography to know when it is applicable to a patient problem. It may be feasible for noncardiologists to gain sufficient proficiency in echocardiography to use the technique as a screening procedure in the emergency department setting.\r"

Much early research with this technique has focused on the evaluation of early pregnancy, where changes related to intrauterine and ectopic gestation are evident at least one week earlier when compared with routine transabdominal ultrasound. Graded compression sonography for appendicitis is an ultrasound search for the inflamed, nonruptured appendix performed by compressing the right lower quadrant with a linear array transducer. Both techniques are fast, safe, and inexpensive evaluations that can be used to evaluate patients with nonspecific clinical findings and are particularly helpful in women of childbearing age.\r"

In most patients the most striking effect was the increase in staphylococcal counts. These strains were found to be resistant to both quinolones in the study. Less consistent changes were observed in oral flora. No relevant difference could be demonstrated between the two regimens on bacterial counts either in feces or in saliva. This study shows the efficacy of both quinolones in eradicating gram-negative bacilli in the alimentary tract of bone marrow transplant patients; however, the finding of the overgrowth of resistant gram-positive organisms during treatment with these agents deserves further evaluation.\r"

The affinity of 3'-azido-2',3'-dideoxyuridine-5'-triphosphate for the reverse transcriptases was similar to that observed for 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine-5'-triphosphate. Both compounds were competitive inhibitors with respect to the normal substrate dTTP and served at least 100 times better as substrates than did dTTP. In contrast, cellular DNA polymerase alpha showed an about 60-times-higher preference for dTTP as substrate than for either inhibitor. The phosphorylation of thymidine in human peripheral blood mononuclear cell extracts was inhibited in a competitive manner by both 3'-azido-2',3'-dideoxyuridine and 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine, with apparent inhibition constants of 290 and 3.4 microM, respectively. The Michaelis-Menten constant, Km, for thymidine was 7.0 microM. 3'-Azido-2',3'-dideoxyuridine and 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine both served as substrates, with apparent Km values of 67 and 1.4 microM, respectively. The maximal rates of phosphorylation with 3'-azido-2',3'-dideoxyuridine and 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine were 40 and 30%, respectively, of the rate with thymidine. The different affinities of 3'-azido-2',3'-dideoxyuridine and 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine for the thymidine kinase and the Km values observed with these compounds as substrates may explain the difference in effects on human immunodeficiency virus type 1 replication in infected peripheral blood mononuclear cells observed when equimolar concentrations of the two compounds are compared.\r"

  ".W": "The treatment of patients with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (ZES) has undergone dramatic evolution during the past decade. Although initially regarded as an incurable tumor, resection of gastrinoma for potential cure has been reported in 30% to 40% of selected patients in recent series. Conversely, although definitive control of acid hypersecretion is achieved by total gastrectomy, histamine (H2)-receptor antagonists and the newly introduced agents omeprazole and somatostatin analogues allow effective medical therapy of gastric acid overproduction. Confirmation of the diagnosis is best achieved with the I.V. secretin stimulation test, and tumor localization techniques are mandatory to identify candidates for operative tumor resection. Intraoperative sonography and careful exploration are required for tumor removal; successful tumor resection is associated with prolonged survival. The majority of patients (60%) are still found to have malignant disease at the time of diagnosis, but 10-year overall survival commonly exceeds 40%. The presence of multiple endocrine neoplasia type I (MEN-I) is seen in 10% to 25% of patients; correction of hypercalcemia alone may have therapeutic benefit in some ZES patients, and while gastrinoma resection is rarely possible, MEN-I patients demonstrate prolonged survival. The choice of medical rather than surgical therapy for acid hypersecretion depends on the suitability of each patient for careful and repeated endoscopic and chemical studies, versus the likelihood of a successful postoperative outcome. Socioeconomic, geographic, and related medical factors in each case may dictate the form of long-term antisecretory therapy. Exploration for possible tumor resection is indicated for virtually all patients who have no documented metastatic disease.\r"

Ninety-five percent of the patients in the modified Toupet group had good or excellent results versus 67% for the Nissen group. However both procedures are effective in curtailing esophagitis with an improvement of the endoscopic grading in the Nissen group by 91% and 89% in the group undergoing the modified Toupet procedure. A significant improvement in symptoms (acid regurgitation, heartburn, retrosternal pain) was noted in both groups, except for dysphagia in the Nissen group. Three patients with a Nissen fundoplication had a slipped Nissen requiring reoperation and two had gas-bloat syndrome. These specific complications of the Nissen procedure were not found in the modified Toupet group.\r"

  ".U": "90073076\r", 
  ".W": "Studies with four different transplantable murine tumors demonstrated that surgical instruments contaminated by contact with a tumor mass could produce tumors in a surgical wound. Eighty-seven per cent of mice with wounds made by invisibly contaminated scissors developed tumors. Irrigation with water did not prevent tumor growth. Before spilled tumor cells can invade and grow into a recurrence in the wound site, they must first attach to underlying extracellular matrix. We have devised a simple in vitro assay to identify inhibitors of tumor-cell attachment to develop therapeutic compounds that can prevent tumor-cell reimplantation. Various test compounds, including proteases (trypsin and Dispase), known modulators of matrix metabolism (proline analogues, cycloheximide, heparin, cortisone, cortexolone, and heparin-steroid combinations), large molecular weight polymers (agarose, dextran, polyethylene oxide), and synthetic fibronectin peptides were tested for their ability to inhibit mouse melanoma (B16-F10) cell attachment to gelatinized dishes. Most of these compounds had little or no effect on tumor-cell adhesion when cells were plated in serum-containing medium. However we identified three compounds that inhibited tumor-cell attachment in a reversible fashion: (1) a specific inhibitor of collagen deposition (L-azetidine-2-carboxylic acid); (2) a bacterial neutral protease (Dispase); and (3) synthetic fibronectin peptides that contained the arginine-glycine-asparate (RGD) sequence that is responsible for cell binding. Dispase and the RGD-containing peptides also inhibited cell implantation and prevented tumor formation in a surgical wound. We propose that inhibitors of attachment might be used either alone or with other biologic modifiers to prohibit implantation of free tumor cells at the time of surgery and thus, to prevent local tumor recurrence.\r"

Their courses of illness were also rated for chronicity. Significantly more patients responded to phenelzine (71%) than to imipramine (48%), which benefited significantly more patients than placebo (26%). Both chronicity and DMS-III diagnosis predicted response on several outcome measures. For example, patients with dysthymic disorder responded better to treatment than did those with major depression, suggesting that dysthymic disorder can be treated with medication. Placebo response correlated inversely with chronicity, regardless of DMS-III diagnosis. Atypical depression and longitudinal course of illness may add to the usefulness of DMS-III depressive diagnosis as a predictor of antidepressant response.\r"

Clomipramine was clearly superior to desipramine in significantly reducing obsessive-compulsive symptoms. Age at onset, duration and severity of illness, type of symptom, and plasma drug concentrations did not predict clinical response to clomipramine. Sixty-four percent of patients who received clomipramine as their first active treatment showed at least some sign of relapse during desipramine treatment.

The major goals of the workshop for affective disorders were to explore the relationship between genetic and clinical heterogeneity, to identify major impediments to linkage studies, and to develop recommendations for the application of standardized methods of conducting linkage studies. The participants in the conference presented detailed demographic and clinical data from most of the published linkage studies of affective disorders. No systematic correspondence between genetic and clinical subtypes of bipolar disorder pedigrees was evident. The major problems hampering the linkage analyses of psychiatric disorders that were identified follow: (1) the major psychiatric disorders--the affective disorders in particular--constituting complex human disorders; (2) the lack of valid definitions of affective disorders; (3) comorbidity between the affective disorders with other disorders; (4) nonrandom mating; (5) a cohort effect, with younger birth cohorts exhibiting higher rates of affective disorders; and (6) the lack of replication of current linkage studies. The recommendations that were made for linkage study designs that incorporate some of the complexities of the affective disorders are reported.\r"

  ".W": "Although different populations of inflammatory cells infiltrate the healing wound, the mechanisms by which they influence the healing process in vivo are poorly defined. In vitro studies suggest that these cells may mediate wound healing by releasing various cytokines within the wound. We measured the levels of interleukin (IL) 1, IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor, and macrophage colony-stimulating factor within a subcutaneously implanted polyurethane sponge on various days after injury. Significantly higher levels of IL-1, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor, and macrophage colony-stimulating factor were detected in the wound fluid compared with basal serum levels in nonwounded mice. Tumor necrosis factor, macrophage colony-stimulating factor, and IL-6 peaked earlier than IL-1; however, the levels of these cytokines had fallen by the 13th day after wounding. Interleukin 2, IL-3, and IL-4 could not be detected in the wound fluid, and the wound fluid inhibited the proliferation of the IL-2-dependent cell lines CTLL-2 and HT-2 in response to recombinant IL-2. We hypothesize that tumor necrosis factor, macrophage colony-stimulating factor, IL-1, and IL-6, which are secreted at the site of injury, interact to promote tissue remodeling. The decrease in the levels of these cytokines by the 13th day after wounding may be the result of a regulatory process by the healed wound.\r"

We report two cases of a cirsoid aneurysm in the proximal jejunum; two cases have been previously reported in the literature. These lesions have the same pathologic features as gastric cirsoid lesions and cause massive gastrointestinal hemorrhage. Because these lesions are beyond the reach of current endoscopy, surgery was necessary to diagnose and treat the lesions in three of four patients. The fourth patient died after unsuccessful surgical exploration, and the lesion was found post mortem. Jejunal cirsoid aneurysms may be an unrecognized rather than a rare cause of gastrointestinal bleeding. They should be considered in the patient with massive proximal gastrointestinal bleeding in whom the source is not known, especially if angiography suggests a small-bowel site. With the advent of newer forms of endoscopy that can examine the small bowel, the management of these lesions may change; at present, surgery is lifesaving.\r"

As a psychiatrist he introduced the humanitarian principle of \"no restraint\" to German asylums. Although he did not attempt to develop a systematic nosology, he nevertheless founded an influential school of psychiatrists (eg, Forel, Kraepelin, and Nissl).

A neurologist is called, examines the patient, and it is concluded that a nerve lesion has occurred, because of stretch, ischemia, compression, or laceration. A subsequent electromyogram and nerve conduction study confirm the clinical impression, but offer little in the way of explanation. Over the subsequent months, the patient makes a slow recovery but there has been a prolonged period of pain and disability. Liability issues loom. This scenario could reflect a number of different nerve lesions. This review illustrates the different modes of pathogenesis that may occur and the variable nature of the neurological deficits.

It is one front of a broad curricular effort to develop physicians' values, social perspectives, and interpersonal skills for the practice of medicine. The authors define medical ethics education as more clinically centered than human values education and more inclusive of philosophical, social, and legal issues than is interpersonal skills training. The authors review the history of the emergence of medical ethics education over the last 20 years, examine the areas of consensus that have emerged concerning the general objectives and premises for designing medical ethics programs, and describe teaching objectives and methods, course content, and program evaluation used in such programs on both preclinical and clinical levels. The four interrelated requirements for successful institutionalization of medical ethics education programs are defined and discussed, and the paper ends with an overview of the uncertain future of medical ethics education, an accepted but still not fully mature part of physician training in the United States.

  ".W": "The new renin inhibitor CGP 38560A has been shown to block angiotensin (ANG) production in healthy volunteers. In order to determine its potential antihypertensive effect, the compound was administered in a 30-min infusion, in 12 hypertensive patients (mean blood pressure (BP): 112.8 +/- 3.5 mm Hg). These patients were selected for their sensitivity to captopril: a single oral dose of 50 mg captopril lowered their mean BP by 8.8 +/- 2.2 mm Hg after 30 min and by 15.3 +/- 1.5 mm Hg after 90 min. At the end of the renin inhibitor infusion, mean blood pressure decreased by 5.7 +/- 2.2 mm Hg in the six patients infused with the dose of 0.125 mg/kg and by 6.0 +/- 1.8 mm Hg in the six patients infused with 0.250 mg/kg. The fall in blood pressure was correlated to the initial plasma renin activity (PRA) (r = 0.61, P less than .05). A dose-dependent effect was observed on plasma ANG I which fell by 74% with 0.125 mg/kg and by 94% with 0.250 mg/kg. Identical falls were found for plasma ANG II (72% and 94%, respectively) and ANG I and ANG II were well correlated (r = 0.91, P less than .001). The fall in BP was correlated to the fall in plasma ANG I (r = 0.77, P less than .01). The time-course of the BP changes was parallel to the changes in plasma angiotensins, as were the slightly delayed rise and fall in active renin measured by a direct immunoradiometric assay. When measured by the conventional ANG I radioimmunoassay, PRA values indicated a long-lasting inhibition.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Nifedipine acutely (first dose) lowered supine blood pressure but did not change supine plasma renin activity (PRA) or aldosterone concentration. In contrast to placebo, short-term treatment (10 weeks) with nifedipine (n = 9, mean dose 43 +/- 16 mg daily) added to HCTZ (50 mg daily) significantly decreased seated blood pressure by 8.6 +/- 10.8/11.5 +/- 6.9 mm Hg. Neither nifedipine or placebo therapy altered PRA, plasma aldosterone concentration or 24 hour urinary aldosterone excretion. Nifedipine frequently caused mild vasodilator symptoms but these did not limit therapy in most patients. There was no correlation between PRA, plasma aldosterone concentration or 24 hour urinary aldosterone excretion and the acute or short-term blood pressure response to nifedipine in these diuretic treated patients. The acute blood pressure response to nifedipine did not predict short-term efficacy. Thus, nifedipine added to a diuretic is generally well-tolerated, effectively lowers blood pressure, and does not stimulate the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone (RAA) axis. Additionally, in diuretic treated patients, the activity of the RAA axis and initial blood pressure response to nifedipine are not predictive of short-term efficacy.\r"

This multicenter, double-blind, randomized study compares the antihypertensive efficacy and safety of dilevalol with propranolol and, in addition, compares the efficacy of dilevalol when given once daily with twice daily. Caucasian patients with mild and moderate essential uncomplicated hypertension were divided into three treatment groups and received either propranolol twice daily (N = 59), dilevalol twice daily (N = 60), or dilevalol once daily (N = 53). Patients were given increasing doses of these medications over a 2 to 10 week period to achieve a supine diastolic blood pressure (SuDBP) of less than 90 mm Hg. The three regimens were equally effective in lowering supine blood pressure (dilevalol daily and twice daily reduced SuDBP by 14 Hg and propranolol by 13 mm Hg). Patients with at least a 5 mm Hg reduction in SuDBP then entered a two month maintenance phase. Dilevalol, whether given once (N = 40) or twice daily (N = 55) maintained the supine systolic blood pressure more effectively (dilevalol daily--15 mm Hg, twice daily--13 mm Hg, P less than .05) than propranolol (N = 53, 11 mm Hg) and dilevalol given once daily maintained diastolic blood pressure more effectively than propranolol (17 mm Hg v 14 mm Hg, P less than .05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Sleep, respiration, arterial blood pressure, arterial plasma catecholamines [norepinephrine (NE) and epinephrine (E)], and plasma pancreatic polypeptide (PP) were measured without and after seven days treatment with nCPAP. Initially in the apnea, arterial blood pressure decreases, and thereafter steadily increases and shows a maximum during the first breath terminating the apnea. With nCPAP the arterial pressure variations disappeared. Awake morning systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure decreased the nCPAP treatment. A significant relation between the reduction in AI and the reduction in morning awake SBP and DBP with nCPAP treatment was observed. No significant changes in NE were observed with nCPAP treatment. Epinephrine decreased and PP increased significantly with nasal nCPAP treatment. The systolic and diastolic blood pressure reduction was significantly related to the decrease in E and the increase in PP. No association between sleep stages and plasma NE, E, and plasma-PP was found before treatment. With nCPAP treatment plasma-PP was higher during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) stage 2 to 4 sleep than during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Thus, morning awake arterial blood pressure and nocturnal arterial blood pressure decrease with nCPAP treatment in sleep apnea patients. These hemodynamic changes are related to the decrease in AI and sympathetic activity and the increase in parasympathetic activity.\r"

Statistically significant decrease in blood pressure (P less than .001) was demonstrated in both treated groups. Total, low density (LDL) and high density (HDL) lipoprotein, cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations were not modified either by ZOF or HCT. Furthermore, LDL/HDL and HDL-2/HDL-3 ratios, apoproteins B, A and A-1 levels did not show any significant differences.

Chronic alveolar hypoventilation symptoms are often misdiagnosed and the condition is frequently treated inappropriately by oxygen therapy. Physicians are often at a loss to offer assisted ventilation by noninvasive methods and tracheostomy and long-term tracheostomy intermittent positive pressure ventilation is often refused. We studied the use of two noninvasive positive airway pressure alternatives for the nocturnal ventilatory support of 31 post-poliomyelitis patients. These methods were intermittent positive pressure ventilation via nasal access (NIPPV) and via a strapless oral-nasal interface (SONI IPPV). The use of custom fabricated interfaces was also evaluated. Practical alternatives for assisted daytime ventilation included glossopharyngeal breathing, the pneumobelt ventilator and mouth intermittent positive pressure ventilation. Overnight sleep monitoring was performed on 10 patients breathing autonomously or with body ventilators then repeated on NIPPV and/or SONI IPPV. The mean sleep oxygen saturation (SaO2) increased from 87.5 +/- 9.1% on unassisted breathing or body ventilators to 96.2 +/- 2.0% (P less than 0.01) on NIPPV or SONI IPPV. Of 12 other patients with a mean vital capacity of 472 +/- 480 ml and no significant free time supine, 11 patients also maintained SaO2 greater than 94% during sleep supine on NIPPV and/or SONI IPPV. Twenty-one patients have been on nocturnal NIPPV for an average of 23 (3-70) months. Six have been on nocturnal SONI IPPV for an average of 35 (5-66) months. All patients' hypoventilation symptoms were relieved. In conclusion, NIPPV and SONI IPPV can improve the nocturnal ventilation of post-poliomyelitis patients with chronic alveolar hypoventilation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The purpose of this study was to describe the pattern of blood flow over the trochanter when subjected to a constant interface pressure for a prolonged period of time. A quasi-experimental design was used to measure skin blood flow over the left trochanter in a sample of 19 healthy adults. With the use of laser doppler flowmetry, the pattern of blood flow was monitored continuously while subjects lay on a supportive air mattress. Measurement of blood flow was described for three periods: preload with subjects supine, loading with subjects in the left lateral position and hyperemia after subjects returned to the supine position. Rate of blood flow under loading showed a gradual increase from preload. There was a marked initial increase in flow during hyperemia that gradually tapered off, but failed to reach preload levels within 30 min. Individual blood flow tracings revealed an inconsistent pattern of response to loading, suggesting the presence of a range of physiological response to compressive surface pressure. Given the individual variation in response to a common external pressure, further research is recommended to evaluate the pattern of blood flow over bony prominences subjected to known interface pressure.\r"

After nine consecutive treatments, the tendons were excised under anesthesia and compared biomechanically. Exposure to ultrasound induced a significant increase in both the tensile strength and the energy absorption capacity of the tendons. Although healing in rabbits may not translate directly to healing in humans, these findings suggest that surgically repaired human Achilles tendons may heal faster if ultrasound is applied during the early stages of healing.\r"

Thus, this monoclonal antibody identifies an epitope located in a region of gp41 that is conserved among all these isolates. To identify this conserved region a series of E. coli recombinant proteins were screened in immunoblot with M71/2B4. From these results the epitope recognized by this antibody appears to map at the amino terminus of gp41, in the region indicated between the cleavage site with gp120 (aa 508) and the HindIII site (aa647).\r"

At all ages in normal and hypertensive lungs neuropeptide tyrosine was the predominant neuropeptide associated with the pulmonary vascular nerves. In normal lungs the relative density of nerve fibres increased during childhood only in the arteries of the respiratory unit. Pulmonary hypertension was associated with the premature innervation of these arteries during the first year of life. Innervation of small, abnormally thick-walled pre-capillary vessels by predominantly vasoconstrictor nerves may help to explain the susceptibility of infants to pulmonary hypertensive crises.\r"

There was reduction in pelvic congestion demonstrated by venography in 17 of the 22 women, and in 16 this was associated with induction of amenorrhoea which suggests that effective ovarian suppression is an important component of successful treatment. In the 17 women who showed a reduction in venogram score, the median change in pain score was 75% compared with only 29% in the five women with no change in venogram score (P less than 0.01). This significant association between reduction in pelvic congestion and pain indicates that pelvic congestion is likely to be the cause of pain in these women and that treatment with medroxyprogesterone acetate could be of value.\r"

Eighty-four women with abnormal pelvic venography were assigned to one of four treatment groups: MPA alone, MPA plus psychotherapy, placebo alone, and placebo plus psychotherapy. Women were treated for 4 months and thereafter followed up regularly for 9 months with pain assessments, pelvic ultrasound scanning, and hormone measurements. During treatment, MPA showed a significant benefit in terms of a reduction in visual analogue scale pain score, with 73% of women reporting at least 50% improvement compared with 33% of those treated with placebo. At 9 months after the end of therapy there was no overall significant effect of MPA or psychotherapy, but there was an interaction between MPA and psychotherapy, with 71% of the women in this group showing a greater than or equal to 50% reduction in pain score. Therapy with MPA is a useful first-line therapy for women with pain associated with demonstrable pelvic congestion.\r"

A significant correlation was demonstrated between both plasma viscosity and gestational age and the resistance index used to characterize the Doppler waveform. Multiple regression analysis demonstrated that changes in plasma viscosity explained 55% of the variance seen in the resistance index and that this was statistically significant. This finding is, however, unlikely to be of clinical significance as whole blood viscosity had an insignificant effect on the impedance in the umbilical artery. We postulate that vascular factors such as the number and calibre of the placental arterioles are a more important determinant of umbilical artery impedance.\r"

Abdominal sector scanning was used to assess uterine contents. Pregnancy was confirmed by ultrasound in 406 pregnancies. Histological confirmation was obtained in each case of pregnancy failure. A live fetus was demonstrated in 259 women of whom six subsequently miscarried; one of these had markedly depressed serum hCG and PAPP-A, but normal SP1 levels, and two had oligohydramnios. Of the 147 women without ultrasound evidence of fetal heart action 67 had a correct ultrasound diagnosis of anembryonic pregnancy. The predictive value of a depressed serum hCG level was 70% in this group, and 31% in samples taken at less than or equal to 7 weeks. The predictive value of a normal hCG level was 96%. In 34 women missed miscarriage was diagnosed readily by ultrasound; all but five had depressed hCG and PAPP-A levels. A clinical diagnosis of a complete or incomplete miscarriage was made in 45 women and easily confirmed by ultrasound. All of them had depressed hCG, SP1 and PAPP-A levels. These results indicate that the diagnostic value of ultrasound in threatened miscarriage is often better than that of biochemical tests.\r"

An automated technique using a digitizer (interfaced with an IBM PC) for measurement of combined cortical width (CCW) at the mid-shaft of six metacarpals was evaluated in three groups of individuals under 50 years of age (98 normal controls, 96 RA, 63 SLE). Intra-observer, inter-observer, and inter-institution reproducibility was assessed with a 'phantom' embedded in a rectangular mould of wax. Intra-patient variation was also assessed in RA patients seen on two occasions less than a month apart. Two hundred and fifty-seven subjects were studied. The method was found to be reproducible for a single observer, among five different observers and in two separate institutions. The RA subjects seen on two occasions showed no significant differences in CCW. The technique showed significant differences of CCW in the three groups of premenopausal subjects (controls; RA; SLE) studied (p less than 0.001). The six metacarpal bone mass was calculated in less than 5 min. The technique of digitized radiogrammetry is an improvement on the Vernier caliper technique. The method is useful for epidemiological cross-sectional studies and for evaluation of long-term radiological changes in RA.\r"

The catheter incorporates a steering system by means of which the catheter tip can be made to assume the form of either a right or left Judkins catheter or to be fixed in any intermediate configuration, entirely through external manipulation. We used this new guiding catheter to perform PTCA on 15 patients. Single lesions were found in the left anterior descending branch in seven patients, in the right coronary artery in four, and in the circumflex artery in two, whereas stenosis of a coronary bypass graft was found in two patients. Angioplasty was successful in all cases. There were no complications, during either the procedure or the postoperative hospitalization. The steerable guiding catheter described here may prove useful for PTCA in cases where a conventional catheter cannot be placed accurately or in cases with multi-vessel coronary disease.\r"

  ".U": "90075565\r", 
  ".W": "Perinatal loss prompts a unique bereavement for parents and their families that is unlike the mourning process experienced at the death of other loved ones. The Support Center For Perinatal and Childhood Death has developed a comprehensive program to provide support, counseling, and information to families who experience miscarriage, stillbirth, fetal anomalies, and therapeutic abortion for genetic or congenital abnormalities. The impact of perinatal loss is felt not only in the real loss of the wished-for child but also in the loss of self-esteem, the role of parent, and the loss of confidence in the ability to produce a healthy child. The emotional experience of miscarriage or stillbirth creates an atmosphere of despair and confusion for families anticipating a joyous event. The presence of a support counselor and medical caregivers at this time can help parents to navigate the crisis surrounding the loss in ways that promote a healthy grieving process and avert pathologic adaptations. Prenatal, intrapartum, and postpartum counseling opportunities are afforded to families as the situation and parental needs dictate. Services also are extended to other family members, with particular attention to surviving siblings who might be vulnerable to the consequences of unresolved or unacknowledged grief. Grief is experienced as a long-term process, which frequently emerges fully after discharge from the hospital and lasts well beyond the interest and stamina of supportive family members and friends. Support groups, which meet the specific needs of families who experience perinatal loss, contemplate subsequent pregnancy, or face the prenatal decision to terminate a genetically or congenitally compromised pregnancy, have been run successfully for a period of several years. Beyond the experience of intrapartum loss in the delivery room, the experience comes full circle for families who enter the delivery room again with a subsequent child. The expressed need for support in acknowledging the rekindled memories of prior loss at this poignant time are matched only by parents' needs to find reassuring ways of differentiating healthy newborns from the memory of those who died. It is often at the time of the subsequent birth that the memory of the lost child can take its proper place in the family. Stein expresses the essence of grief work and resolve: Mourning is not just feeling sad. It is the specific psychological process by which human beings become able to give up some of the feelings they have invested in a person who no longer exists, and extend their love to the living. Mourning is hard, emotional work.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "In summary, the in utero diagnosis of nonimmune hydrops is associated with a grave prognosis. Antenatal evaluation will determine the cause in many cases, allowing appropriate decisions to be made regarding the management of the pregnancy. To date, no specific in utero therapy exists for most causes of nonimmune hydrops fetalis. At the time of delivery, a resuscitation team will be needed for the infant because extensive resuscitation is likely to be necessary. Many infants will die in the first day of life but some will survive; the survivors will probably require intensive newborn care, including mechanical ventilation. A major cause of mortality in babies with nonimmune hydrops is respiratory insufficiency. If pulmonary hypoplasia is present and severe, survival may not be possible despite intensive care. Review of our data suggests that the diagnosis of idiopathic nonimmune hydrops carries the same grave prognosis as other forms. Currently, only babies with nonimmune hydrops secondary to supraventricular tachycardia have a high probability of survival. Parents of hydropic infants should be counseled concerning the probable outcome and the risk of recurrence. A genetic consultant can help in this regard. Infants who die should have a complete postmortem examination, and placental pathology should be performed in all cases.\r"

Perinatal management should include close fetal monitoring, timely intervention, and the provision of skilled neonatal resuscitation once the infant is delivered. Etiology of cardiopulmonary distress in the neonate may initially be difficult to determine. Surfactant deficiency (RDS), congenital pneumonia, cardiopulmonary asphyxia, and pulmonary hypoplasia should be included in the differential diagnosis.

  ".W": "The intrapartum management of the patient with a multiple gestation should begin in the antenatal period. With the present widespread use of ultrasound, the number of multiple gestations diagnosed early in pregnancy has now increased, permitting determination of placentation and monitoring of fetal growth. When a patient with a twin gestation presents in labor, ultrasound should be used to establish fetal presentation and size. The fetal well-being should be evaluated with fetal heart monitoring, and assessment of potential maternal complications, such as anemia, hypertension, and polyhydramnios, should be accomplished. With more than two fetuses, cesarean delivery is recommended. The principal controversy in intrapartum management of twin gestation relates to the planned route of delivery, particularly because this consideration is influenced by malpresentation and prematurity. There is general agreement favoring vaginal delivery for vertex-vertex twin pairs. With dual fetal heart rate monitoring and appropriate delivery room preparation for emergency cesarean section, recent evidence supports planned vaginal delivery of the mature nonvertex second twin. Elective cesarean section for the nonvertex second twin estimated as weighing less than 1800 gm is advised.\r"

  ".W": "The number of HIV-infected pregnant women in the United States is steadily increasing. While seroprevalence rates vary widely by geography, as many as 2 to 5 per cent of pregnant women in epicenters are seropositive. Medical management of the HIV-infected woman during labor and delivery depends on the clinical stage of her disease. Many will be asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic and can be managed as usual. For others, delivery may be complicated by concomitant infections and AIDS-related conditions. Between 25 and 40 per cent of infants born to HIV infected mothers will acquire HIV infection. Transmission of HIV from mother to her infant can occur in utero, intrapartum, or postpartum by breastfeeding. Infants who escape intrauterine infection are exposed to HIV-infected maternal blood and secretions at the time of delivery. Precautions should be taken to minimize intrapartum exposure by removing blood and secretions from the surfaces and mucous membranes of the infant as soon as possible after birth. In addition, procedures that involve disruption of the infant's intact skin should be avoided when possible until maternal blood and secretions have been removed. The risk of nosocomial transmission of HIV is low (less than 1 per cent following needlestick exposure). Nevertheless, labor and delivery represent times when exposure to blood and body fluids can be anticipated. Precautions that are designed to prevent parenteral exposure and exposure of mucous membranes and nonintact skin of health care workers to blood and body fluids should be used routinely for all patients.\r"

Adding information on neurologic state during the first days of life adds powerfully to the ability to predict long-term outcome. Further enhancement of predictive abilities will require putting together into single studies the kinds of information on predictors that is now reported in scattered and variously selected small series. Although prediction of outcome requires looking forward from information available in the delivery room to include observations on neonatal encephalopathy and its biochemical and other correlates, an understanding of causation requires looking backward from immediate perinatal and delivery room events to consider the contribution of prenatal factors, known and unknown. Many characteristics commonly labeled as indicators of \"neonatal hypoxia,\" for example, may be the first evidence in the infant of earlier-established abnormality. Birth events appear to contribute only a small proportion of CP and much less of other chronic neurologic disabilities. There is a possibility that the addition of new agents to our therapeutic armamentarium may be capable of reducing that number still further. Prediction and causation as related to chronic neurologic disability gain fresh relevance in view of the need to prepare for clinical trials of new therapies in perinatal medicine.\r"

  ".W": "The pathophysiological mechanisms of leakage, synthesis, and decreased removal of enzyme from blood all play a role in explaining why serum enzymes increase in disease. This presentation has focused on increased synthesis as an important and perhaps major source of increased serum enzymes. The second key point has to do with the reference standard. There is tremendous sophistication in the field addressed to the numerator, that is, biochemical units. The natural tendency is to focus attention on what we want to know in the numerator, the enzyme changes in the tissue. In so doing, however, we tend to ignore the changes of the reference standard in the denominator, which influence the final result as much as the numerator. The following recommendations are made: uniformity, enzyme activities referable to morphological units, and basic biological significance. Total organ per gram initial body weight is recommended as the optimal reference standard whenever possible. If this were done, perhaps we could then resolve the dilemma of the poor understanding of why serum enzymes change in disease. We would, thereby, be better equipped to bring the major part of biochemical pathology out of its infancy as described by Farber.\r"

  ".W": "For the diagnosis of myocardial injury, particularly AMI, CK-MB has become the gold standard. Changing CK-MB activities in serially collected blood from patients with suggestive signs and symptoms of AMI is almost pathognomonic for infarction. Nevertheless, an increased CK-MB cannot be equated with AMI owing to the many other types of inflammatory, traumatic, and miscellaneous forms of injury to the heart and the trace activities of CK-MB in skeletal muscle. Other enzyme tests for AMI are less efficient. In order of decreasing efficiency, the tests are CK-MB, CK, LD1 greater than LD2 or LD1/LD2 greater than 0.76, AST and LD; the latter two tests are not cost effective and add little or nothing when results for CK-MB, CK, and LD isoenzymes are available. The value of the isoforms of CK-MM and CK-MB remains to be established. Early evidence suggests that they could be helpful in the diagnosis of AMI; however, owing to the greater technical difficulties in performing these tests, their use is necessarily more restricted. Enzyme testing on admission and then every 12 hours for 2 days is sufficient and effective in making the initial diagnosis. In patients presenting early after an attack, CK and CK-MB are often normal. Decisions on AMI cannot be made on blood tests collected in the emergency department. Clot-lysing agents like streptokinase, urokinase, and tPA have changed the therapy of AMI dramatically. Enzyme tests clearly separate patients with and without successful therapeutic or spontaneous reperfusion. With successful reperfusion, the uniform finding has been a \"washout\" phenomenon with significantly earlier peaking times for CK and CK-MB. The isoforms of CK and myoglobin give the earliest peaks after successful reperfusion. With faster turnaround times for these tests, they may become important tools in patient management.\r"

  ".W": "Following acute myocardial infarction, total CK and CK-MB levels begin to rise 5 to 6 hours after the onset of chest pain. The serial profile of the rise and fall of both activities is nearly always indicative of AMI. The recent increase in the use of thrombolytic agents in an attempt to attain reperfusion of occluded coronary arteries alters the enzyme profiles observed in blood after AMI. After successful reperfusion a washout phenomenon occurs in which early restoration of blood flow to damaged myocardium causes an early rise in total CK and MB levels above the normal range 2 to 4 hours after AMI, with earlier and higher peak enzyme values. Recently reports have appeared describing numerous serum and plasma CK-MM and CK-MB isoform patterns after AMI. Following release from injured myocardium CK-MM3 and CK-MB2 (designated the tissue isoforms) are converted in the circulation to post-translation products (MM2, MM1, MB1, respectively). Studies have now shown that CK-MM isoform patterns provide a unique means of assessing the time of onset of necrosis and a monitor of the duration of enzyme release from the site of injury. Following AMI, MM3, the MM3/MM1 ratio, or both rises and peaks earlier than either total CK or CK-MB levels. During successful reperfusion, the rate of rise of CK-MM3 is more rapid and the MM3/MM1 ratio peaks earlier than without reperfusion. However, any concomitant release of CK-MM3 from skeletal muscle would decrease the clinical utility of MM isoforms in detecting myocardial damage. Recent advances in technology have shown that CK-MB2 rise parallels the CK-MM increase and also rises earlier than total CK and total MB levels and provides increased specificity for the myocardium. The full potential of the diagnostic utility of MM and MB isoforms will not be realized until a reliable, sensitive, simple, and rapid quantitative assay becomes available.\r"

Detecting CK2MB at its average peak for maximal assurance of diagnosis when release is small and for prognosis in all cases of increased serum CK2MB 2. Detection of laboratory evidence of myocardial injury when admission is delayed after onset by the collection of an admission sample for declining CK2MB, and for assays of other enzymes with longer time curves after myocardial injury such as LD isoenzymes and ASAT/ALAT activities and ratio 3. Establishment of decision limits and criteria for the determination of laboratory evidence of myocardial injury 4. Providing cost-effective procedures other than limitation of the number of samples; these include establishing thresholds and criteria for total CK, total LD, and ASAT so that isoenzymes and ALAT are only performed when thresholds are exceeded and criteria are met; performing only CK and, if the threshold is exceeded, CK isoenzymes on the 16-hour sample; collecting additional samples after the first two only when indicated by positive or suspicious (borderline) results and only on routine morning or afternoon rounds rather than specifically timed specimens (except in cases involving thrombolytic therapy); and termination of the protocol once peak positive CK2MB activity and requisite diagnostic consensus confirmation (such as positive LD isoenzymes) is obtained whether or not thrombolytic therapy is involved. Tissue localization of the enzymes has been outlined in some detail with particular reference to the amount of CK2MB in skeletal muscle. Pathophysiological factors discussed in more depth in a previous article have been amplified here with particular reference to the role of increased synthesis as a response to myocardial injury by surrounding prehypertrophic and hypertrophic myocardium as a possible major source of increased serum enzymes in myocardial infarction. ASAT and especially the ASAT/ALAT ratio are useful tests in the protocol, particularly in cases tested late after onset of symptoms when CK2MB has declined into the borderline or usual range, and ASAT/ALAT may be helpful in evaluating LD isoenzyme results.

Unanticipated monitored events were defined as sudden reductions (greater than 20%) in cardiac index (CI), PaO2, SaO2, transcutaneous PO2 (PtcO2), and PtcO2/PaO2 index, or decreases to the lower limits of satisfactory values, specifically: PaO2 less than 70 torr, SaO2 less than 95%, PtcO2 less than 50 torr, and PtcO2/PaO2 less than 0.6. Essentially, monitored events are the small variations superimposed on the overall physiologic patterns that describe the entire course of critical illnesses. Monitored events are described by their baseline values just before each event, at the nadir of the event, and at the recovery from the event. To simplify presentation of complex changes in many variables, the circulatory changes were evaluated in terms of cardiac, pulmonary, and peripheral perfusion functions. Common patterns of these monitored events and the incidence of these patterns in high-risk surgical patients were described. Before the unanticipated monitored event, there were normal or increased heart, lung, and perfusion functions in about three fourths of the events. At the nadir, cardiac functions decreased in about two thirds, perfusion decreased in over half, and lung function fell in only one quarter of the events. Recovery occurred with increased cardiac function in two thirds, improved perfusion in over half, and increased lung function in less than one fifth of these monitored events. Noninvasive and invasive hemodynamic and oxygen transport variables were measured simultaneously to evaluate compensatory and decompensatory patterns.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Bronchocutaneous fistula (BCF) can originate at different levels, from the major airways to the peripheral lung. Little is published on the influence of the fistula origin or the ventilatory effect of the airleak. This study evaluates relative CO2 elimination via fistulas of various size and how different ventilatory modes influence both the quantity and quality, i.e., oxygen and CO2 content, of the airleak. We created BCF with five polyethylene tubings of different diameters (tube 1, 3.0 mm; tube 2, 4.0 mm; tube 3, 5.1 mm; tube 4, 6.4 mm; tube 5, 9.8 mm) in nine dogs. Six modes of ventilation were used with each tubing: spontaneous breathing (SB), pressure support (PS), high frequency (HF), assisted controlled with inspiration set at 20% (AC20) and at 67% (AC67) of the respiratory cycle, and AC20 with an end-expiratory pressure of +10 cm H2O (PEEP). For each ventilatory mode, the fistula air flow (Vf), CO2, and oxygen partial pressure of fistula air (PfCO2 and PfO2) and arterial blood were measured. Vf was measured for all tubes, while gas analysis was done for tubes 1, 3, and 5 only. As expected, Vf increased with tubing size. Vf was higher with AC67 and PEEP than with the other ventilatory modes. PfCO2 was not significantly influenced by the tube size and Vf. Fistula air alveolization was increased only with HF ventilation. Air leaked via the fistula contributed significantly to gas exchange; even when expiration was totally via the fistula, the arterial gases remained unchanged.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The aim of the present study was to determine possible effects of Escherichia coli endotoxin on peripheral vascular compliance and relate them to concomitant central hemodynamic disturbances. Endotoxin was infused at 0.25 micrograms/kg.min during 2 h in six anesthetized dogs, while six additional animals served as controls. Vascular compliance of the systemic circulation was calculated in intact animals from the changes in CVP after known changes in systemic blood volume. In control dogs, vascular compliance averaged 2.3 ml/mm Hg.kg body weight. During slow endotoxin infusion, cardiovascular effects were measurable only after a certain period of time had elapsed from the start of endotoxin insult and consisted of hypotension associated with systemic vasodilation. Systemic BP decreased gradually from 124 to 68 mm Hg while vascular compliance was finally increased by 100%, when compared to control values. This latter rise was responsible for a reduction in the cardiac preloads. Pulmonary wedge pressure and CVP were decreased from 7.1 to 3.4 and from 4.5 to 2.6 mm Hg, respectively. However, parallel to the decrease in left ventricular preload, endotoxin induced a progressive decrease in left ventricular afterload. Because of the balance in ventricular loading, cardiac output remained almost unchanged. After volume loading (dextran 30 ml/kg), cardiac output was remarkably increased from 3.28 to 6.24 L/min.m2 while peripheral vasodilation was not affected by this maneuver. It is concluded that low dose endotoxin infusion induces in dogs a hemodynamic pattern similar to human sepsis. The left ventricular loading changes are related to an enhanced systemic vascular compliance from 2.3 to 4.5 ml/mm Hg.kg. High flow shock state is encountered provided peripheral blood pooling is compensated by adequate volume replacement.\r"

  ".W": "The theoretical, legal, and medical doctrines of informed consent are analyzed. The elements of informed consent include disclosure of information, competency, understanding, voluntariness, and decision-making. The doctrine is ground in deference to individual autonomy and recognition that the exercise of self-determination in matters of health is a liberty interest honored by our history and traditions. The exceptions to informed consent including emergency, incompetency, therapeutic privilege, and waiver are especially important in critically ill patients and reflect a balancing of autonomy values and society's interest in the promotion of health. Legal decisions inevitably are based on atypical physician-patient encounters and focus on a particular problem or procedure rather than on overall medical care. In addition, they often reflect an artificial view of the doctor-patient relationship. Medical decision-making is a complex, evolving pursuit of a diagnosis and proper treatment regimen. Moreover, patients are not always interested in the role assigned to them by law. A reconceptualization of informed consent doctrines utilizing sliding scale standards based on variables pertinent to each individual patient is suggested.\r"

While much has been learned about the etiologic risk factors, less progress has been made in therapy. Five-year survival rates remain at less than 10%. However, there has been some progress in the therapy of one histological subtype of lung cancer, small cell lung cancer. Totaling around 20% of lung cancer cases, small cell lung cancer is distinct from the other histologic subtypes in its biologic behavior and responsiveness to therapy. In the 1960s, the median survival for patients with small cell lung cancer was approximately 3 months. With combination chemotherapy and radiotherapy median survivals now range from 1 to 2 years, and there is evidence for a curative potential since approximately 10% of patients who initially present with limited disease survive greater than 2 years. The unique clinical aspects of this histological subtype potentially relate to its underlying cell of origin. This behavior is reflected in the numerous paraneoplastic syndromes that frequently accompany small cell lung cancer. Its propensity for early dissemination have made staging the extent of disease an important part of the clinical evaluation. Since small cell lung cancer is sensitive to both chemotherapy and radiation therapy, there have been multiple clinical trials evaluating drug/radiotherapy combinations. This article will briefly describe the unique aspects of small cell lung cancer as opposed to other histological subtypes of lung cancer and give an overview of the current clinical approach and treatment of this disease.\r"

In contrast, when SPMAR was performed on washed sperm or with an indirect antibody transfer from serum or seminal plasma, SPMAR results gave mostly low values for bead binding in comparison with IBT. Our data suggest that SPMAR be used only in direct assays employing unwashed ejaculates, that it can be easily incorporated into routine semen analysis as a screening test, and that positive results should be confirmed by IBT (IgG and IgA).\r"

  ".W": "Clinical and laboratory attempts to alter the sex ratio require more complete and thorough study. Improved identification of Y-bearing sperm through chromosome evaluation rather than by F-body identification is critical to provide a more precise definition. The tentative conclusions stated below are based on an assessment of literature from which it is generally difficult to draw conclusions: 1. The timing of intercourse in relation to ovulation and subsequent fertilization appears to influence the sex ratio. More females are conceived when coitus occurs relatively close to ovulation, and more males are conceived when the sperm or egg is in the reproductive tract for a relatively longer time before conception. The influence of coital timing on the sex ratio is overall quite subtle and is not a practical method to alter the sex ratio for individual couples. 2. The use of ovulation-inducing medications slightly favors female offspring. A decrease in sex ratio of 5% to 10% has been shown in multiple studies. 3. Artificial insemination with fresh donor or homologous spermatozoa results in more male births with a reported 7% to 10% increase in the sex ratio. It appears that ovulation induction combined with artificial insemination cancels the respective influences of each on the sex ratio. 4. Sperm separation techniques using albumin (for selection of Y-bearing sperm) or Sephadex column filtration (for selection of X-bearing sperm) are the only techniques that have been reported to alter the sex ratio to a degree that is clinically relevant. Although clinical birth data are just beginning to accumulate, these methods appear to have a 70% to 80% success for selection of assumed Y-bearing sperm and a 75% to 80% success for selection of assumed X-bearing sperm. The validity of these results will remain questionable until fully detailed accounts are published and successfully repeated. Free-flow electrophoresis appears to achieve significant separation; however, the depressed postprocedure spermatozoa motility presently limits the usefulness of this procedure. 5. There is a potential to combine clinical and laboratory methods to maximize the efficiency of sex selection for interested couples. Modern methods to identify ovulation (e.g., urinary LH kits, ultrasonography) may help the timing of coitus for sex selection. Clomiphene citrate may enhance female sex preselection when Sephadex column filtration is also employed. 6. The priority of sex preselection in terms of medical, social, and demographic consideration remains to be determined. The avoidance of sex-linked genetic disorders is a reasonable and desirable goal.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Separated cells were obtained using selective enzymatic digestion in conjunction with physical separation procedures. Isolated populations exhibited over 95% homogeneity, ascertained immunocytochemically. Using this system, isolated cells from normal endometrium can readily be obtained for in vitro studies.

Comparison of the pulsatility index from the left and right ovarian artery revealed a significantly lower pulsatility index on the side of the ovary bearing the developing corpus luteum, suggesting reduced down-stream impedance or increased blood flow.

Study endpoints were severe recurrence of variceal hemorrhage or death. Forty-two patients did not fulfill the entry criteria for the study. Thirty-eight patients received propranolol of whom 18 (47%) had further hemorrhage, 14 died, eight had side-effects (2 withdrawals), and 3 did not complete follow-up. Forty-three patients received placebo of whom 33 (77%) had further hemorrhage, 19 died, 5 had side-effects (2 withdrawals), and 5 failed to complete follow-up. The median time from onset of hemorrhage to starting drug therapy was 6 days for both groups. Life table analysis showed an equivalent incidence of further hemorrhage in both groups over the first 60 days, following which the propranolol group did consistently better than the placebo group. There was a significantly lower incidence of rebleeding in modified Child's C patients receiving propranolol (39%) than those on placebo (90%).

  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to determine the role of gastrin and cholecystokinin in the cephalic phase of gastrin release and gastric and pancreatic secretion in conscious dogs. Sham feeding in intact dogs increased gastric acid output to about 65% of histamine maximum and pancreatic protein to 23% of caerulein maximum. Significant increases in plasma gastrin and pancreatic polypeptide but not cholecystokinin occurred. Similar effects were obtained using insulin hypoglycemia or 2-deoxy-D-glucose glucocytopemia. Atropine eliminated gastric acid response to sham feeding, insulin, or 2-deoxy-D-glucose, significantly reduced the pancreatic protein response by about 60%, and abolished plasma pancreatic polypeptide but not plasma gastrin. Blocking of cholecystokinin receptors by L-364,715 did not affect gastric or pancreatic secretory responses to sham feeding, insulin, or 2-deoxy-D-glucose and failed to influence the accompanying increments in plasma gastrin and pancreatic polypeptide. In antral-mucosectomized dogs, sham feeding-induced acid output reached only 17% of histamine maximum but the increase in pancreatic protein output was similar to that in intact dogs. In these animals, background stimulation with G17I (62 pmol/kg per h) potentiated the gastric acid response to sham feeding but had little effect on pancreatic protein output. This study provides evidence that unlike gastric acid, the pancreatic protein response to physiological or pharmacological cephalic stimulation does not depend on vagally released gastrin but probably on direct vagal stimulation of the pancreas.\r"

Fourteen patients entered and 9 completed a double-blind, controlled, cross-over study of 7 mo duration. The mean age was 26 yr (range, 18-37). Patients received 4 cookies daily containing 20 mg corn fiber or placebo. Symptoms and compliance were evaluated monthly. Rectosigmoid pressures and dietary intake were evaluated at the outset and completion of each study arm. Symptoms improved during both fiber and placebo treatments. Those symptoms demonstrating significant improvement with time were pain severity, stool frequency, stool consistency (p = 0.001), number of additional gastrointestinal symptoms present (p = 0.02), and total symptom score (p less than 0.001). Rectosigmoid pressures were not significantly altered by fiber or placebo. Fasting pressures at the distal recording site tended to correlate with pain severity (r = 0.6; p = 0.06). It was concluded that (a) corn fiber and placebo were both effective in alleviating symptoms, (b) there was a correlation between symptom severity and fasting rectosigmoid pressure, and (c) there was a trend toward reduction in fasting and postprandial rectosigmoid pressures after fiber therapy.\r"

Several groups of medications, including tricyclic antidepressants, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, and psychostimulants, have been used for treatment of depression in dementia patients. Generally, Alzheimer's patients require lower dosages of medication and longer drug treatment trials than younger patients treated for depression.\r"

It is now proposed that the diet prescribed contain predominantly carbohydrate (50 to 60% of total calories) and that the carbohydrates be primarily complex and rich in fiber. Protein should be of high quality, but never in excess. A diet low in saturated fats and cholesterol and proportionately higher in polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats seems prudent in view of the accelerated incidence of macrovascular disease in this population. Lipid profiles should be carefully monitored, and carbohydrate intake may need to be limited if hypertriglyceridemia is present. Vitamin and mineral supplements may be desirable. It is important to understand that the dietary guidelines for diabetic patients discussed in this article are not fundamentally different from those for any other person desiring a healthy diet. The nutritional program outlined is a good program for everyone, and the entire family is encouraged to participate in the meal planning and preparation involved.\r"

  ".U": "90077671\r", 
  ".W": "The sympathetic nervous system contributes to the regulation and control of a great number of body functions. A considerable fraction of preganglionic fibers are constantly discharging nerve impulses, and this tonic activity is responsible for a number of sustained bodily conditions. These tonic sympathetic discharges are of central origin and may be decreased by inhibition or augmented by excitation of the central neural mechanisms in control of the relevant preganglionic neurons. Certain other sympathetic paths become active only when special conditions lead to excitation of their central connections. The effect of the activity of preganglionic fibers on the different target organs, however, does not depend entirely on central regulatory influences. The sympathetic ganglia play a significant role processing and integrating the information arriving from the central nervous system and controlling the output to the target organs. In this context, the different potentials described above constitute the basis for the integrative process to occur. We now have substantial information about the basic biophysical events associated with different electrical events in the sympathetic ganglia. Very little is known, however, about how they operate in an integrative manner to control specific functions. The control of sympathetic responses during surgical stimulation is an important goal of general anesthesia. General anesthetics may operate to produce this effect at both central and peripheral levels. The sympathetic ganglion as a peripheral synapse, with basic integrative properties similar to the complex central nervous system, is a model still not sufficiently exploited to understand mechanisms by which general anesthetics control sympathetic response. The relevance of the findings described above in a variety of clinical situations, such as stress, hypertension, exercise, and anesthesia, remains to be studied.\r"

The first stage consists of the removal of the femoral component and cement through a lateral transtrochanteric approach, followed by removal of the acetabular component through an abdominal-retroperitoneal approach to permit exposure of the major intrapelvic structures and to ascertain their relationship to the acetabular component and cement. After the acetabular component has been removed, bone grafts are applied to the pelvis. Postoperatively, the patient is placed in traction for a time and then is allowed to walk with non-weight-bearing. The second stage of reconstruction, consisting of hip replacement, is performed nine to twelve months after the first stage. A satisfactory result was obtained in the four patients for whom we followed this operative regimen. In one patient, the first-stage procedure yielded a satisfactory result and the second stage was not done.\r"

LD78 gene transcripts were detected in eight of eight fresh samples of cells from patients with acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL) by Northern blot analysis. ANLL cells with monocytic features gave the strongest bands. RNA transcripts were found in two of three samples of cells from patients with adult T cell leukemia (ATL), eight of nine samples from patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) of B cell lineage, and one of the three samples from patients with T cell ALL. KG-1, HL-60, HUT 102, MT-2, and MJ cell lines expressed the LD78 gene constitutively. The LD78 protein was detected in culture supernatants and cell lysates of HUT 102, MT-2, MJ, and fresh ATL cells by Western blot analysis. This protein was not found in culture supernatants or cell lysates of monocytic leukemia cells and HL-60 cells, although LD78 transcripts were found in those cells. The discrepancy between gene and protein expression might be explained by the stability of the mRNA. Thus, the protein may be involved in the neoplastic transformation of hematopoietic cells.\r"

We performed Northern blot analysis on synovial tissue specimens from Lewis rats with proliferative and invasive streptococcal cell wall (SCW) arthritis. Transin mRNA was present in abundance, as was the mRNA of the c-myc oncogene, which is associated with cellular proliferation. Immunohistochemical staining of synovia from rats with chronic SCW arthritis showed high-level transin expression in the cells of the lining layer and underlying stroma, as well as in chondrocytes and osteoclasts in subchondral bone. Intense nuclear staining for the Myc oncoprotein was also detected with a cross-reactive antibody to v-Myc. Transin stained similarly in the early, rapid-onset, thymus-independent, acute phase of SCW arthritis. In the T cell-dependent adjuvant arthritis, transin expression was noted by day 4, 6 d before the influx of mononuclear cells and the onset of clinical disease. Athymic rats did not express transin. We concluded that transin is a marker of proliferative, invasive arthritis in rats and appears early in the course of disease development, but requires a competent immune system to sustain its expression in these model arthropathies.\r"

Staining of fetal, newborn, or adult skin with antibodies to beta 1, alpha 2, or alpha 3 subunits gave essentially similar staining patterns: intense staining was associated with the basal layer of the epidermis, hair follicles, and blood vessel walls. The alpha 5 subunit could be detected only in epidermis and the inner root sheath of hair follicles in fetal skin. In epidermis, the staining reaction for the beta 1 subunit was not only found in sites interfacing with the basement membrane zone, but also around the entire periphery of these cells. We speculate that these receptors might have previously unrecognized functions in cell-cell interactions or that these findings may suggest the presence of previously unrecognized ligands in the intercellular spaces of keratinocytes. Examination of nine nodular basal cell carcinomas revealed a prominent staining reaction with anti-beta 1 and anti-alpha 3 antibodies at the periphery of the tumor islands. In contrast, staining of five squamous cell carcinomas revealed either the absence of integrins or altered and variable expression. Thus, matrix components and their receptors may participate in modulation of growth, development, and organization of human skin.\r"

  ".W": "A young man suffering from recurrent Neisseria infections was shown to lack detectable serum complement factor D hemolytic activity. Addition to the patient's serum of purified factor D to a final concentration of 1 microgram/ml resulted in full restoration of the activity of the alternative pathway. Using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, it was shown that the patient's serum did not contain measurable amounts of factor D antigen either. The sister, the father, as well as the parents of the mother had factor D levels within the normal range, and the factor D level of the mother was decreased. The capacity of the patient's serum, at concentrations up to 5%, to promote phagocytosis of Escherichia coli by normal human granulocytes was low when compared to normal serum. Substitution of the patient's serum with purified factor D resulted in a full restoration of opsonic activity. This study describes the first complete deficiency of factor D, and demonstrates its possible relation to recurrent Neisseria infections.\r"

  ".W": "Studies were performed in in vitro and in vivo models to assess the effect of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) on the development of acute complement-mediated tissue damage. IVIG significantly increased the duration of survival and frequently prevented the death of guinea pigs injected with anti-Forssman antiserum to cause lethal Forssman shock; no control animal treated with albumin and/or maltose vehicle survived. The most pronounced effect was achieve by delivering IVIG as one slow injection at 1,800 mg/kg 3 h before Forssman shock was elicited. Infusion of guinea pig IgG at the same dosage was similarly protective. A strong positive correlation was found between IgG plasma levels and survival time in guinea pigs treated with graded doses of IVIG. Therapy itself did not affect C3 and C4 levels nor the capacity to activate these components. In vitro studies showed almost complete inhibition of C3 uptake onto IgG-sensitized erythrocytes using serum from an IVIG-treated animal. We suggest that supraphysiologic levels of IVIG act in part by preventing active C3 fragments from binding to target cells. Infusion of high dose IVIG may be a rational approach to modulating acute, complement-dependent tissue damage in a variety of diseases in man.\r"

  ".W": "Internalization and infectivity of Trypanosoma cruzi trypomastigotes by macrophages is enhanced by prior treatment of parasites with normal human serum. Heating serum or removing C1q from serum abrogates the enhancement, but augmentation of attachment and infectivity is restored by addition of purified C1q to either serum source. Although both noninfective epimastigotes (Epi) and vertebrate-stage tissue culture trypomastigotes (TCT) bind C1q in saturable fashion at 4 degrees C, internalization by monocytes and macrophages of TCT but not Epi-bearing C1q is enhanced in comparison to untreated parasites. Adherence of human monocytes and macrophages to surfaces coated with C1q also induces a marked enhancement of the internalization of native TCT. C1q enhances attachment of both Epi and TCT to human foreskin fibroblasts, but only when C1q is on the parasite and not when the fibroblasts are plated on C1q-coated surfaces. Only TCT coated with C1q show enhanced invasion into fibroblasts. Although trypomastigotes produce an inhibitor of the complement cascade which limits C3 deposition during incubation in normal human serum, C1q binds to the parasite and enhances entry of trypomastigotes into target cells.\r"

Because microleakage may be responsible for pulp irritation, pulp inflammation, necrosis, and recurrent caries, it is essential to prevent and control it. Correct cavity margin preparations, proper amalgam manipulation, proper condensation, and burnishing can minimize microleakage in amalgam restorations. The use of conventional varnish or dentin adhesive on cavity walls before the insertion of the amalgam is the best method to reduce microleakage. Most well-manipulated and well-placed amalgams do not exhibit microleakage after a time.\r"

The major cause of dementia is Alzheimer's disease. Although it has been suggested that aluminum intake may cause this disease, the bulk of scientific evidence suggests that this is unlikely. Dietary supplements of choline and lecithin have been used to treat Alzheimer's disease but are ineffective. Alzheimer's disease patients are at risk of developing protein-energy malnutrition because of poor food intake and increased energy requirements. The second most common cause of dementia is multi-infarct dementia, caused by multiple strokes. Diet may play a role in the prevention of this form of dementia through effects on blood pressure and other risk factors. Control of risk factors may also prevent further progression of the dementia. Patients with multi-infarct dementia often have dysphagia. The third most common cause of dementia appears to be excessive alcohol intake, due both to the direct neurotoxic effects of alcohol and to the effects of alcohol on nutritional status. Alcoholic dementia may be at least partially reversible with abstinence and good nutrition. Other causes are vitamin B-12 and folate deficiencies; these are reversible dementias. In all types of dementia, adequate nutrition may improve physical well-being, help maximize the patient's functioning, and improve the quality of life.\r"

We hypothesized that this beneficial effect on blood pressure is caused by an octreotide-induced suppression of insulin secretion. We studied the effects of octreotide and insulin administration on the course of blood pressure after oral glucose loading in 10 healthy hypertensive old persons (mean age 73 +/- 3 years). Octreotide was given in a dose of 50 micrograms subcutaneously (sc) (time = -30 minutes). Insulin was given sc in a dose of 0.3 U/kg body weight (time = -10 minutes) and glucose was given orally in a dose of 75 g in 300 mL water (time = 0 minutes). Plasma insulin concentrations remained essentially unchanged after placebo and rose to a maximum level of 58 +/- 6 mU/L following insulin administration. The course of blood pressure was not different following glucose loading with high or low plasma insulin levels. These data indicate that the effects of octreotide on postprandial blood pressure reduction in the elderly are unrelated to the inhibition of insulin secretion.\r"
