  ".W": "Natural killer cell activity is inhibited by primary cultures of monolayer cells. In this study, we analyzed the mechanism of the inhibition. Inhibited NK cells showed unaltered binding capacity to NK sensitive K562 cells. The orientation of the effector cells' actin-containing microfilaments, an event known to occur during the programming for the lysis stage in lytic conjugates, was unaffected by the inhibition. In single cell cytotoxicity experiments, the number of killer cells among conjugate-forming cells was reduced. The capacity of the inactivated NK cells to secrete cytotoxic factors upon stimulation with Con A was also impaired. Both NK-resistant inactivating target cells and NK-sensitive K562 cells were sensitive to the toxic factors secreted by NK cells. Thus, the results indicate that the target cell-mediated inactivation of NK cell is based on a block in the lethal hit stage, possibly due to reduced release of toxic factor(s) from the effector cells. The capacity of inactivated effector cells to mediate antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity was unimpaired, suggesting that the contact-mediated inhibition of cytotoxicity selectively affects NK cells.\r"

Inducer suppressor T cells (Tsi) were activated in mice at the age of 3 mo (young) or 18 mo (old) by i.v. injection of NP-conjugated syngeneic spleen cells (SC). Spleen cells from the NP-SC-injected mice were subcultured in vitro with spleen cells from normal young or old mice to generate transducer suppressor T cells (Tst). Four days later subcultured cells were added to responder cell cultures 1 day before the PFC assays to trigger effector suppressor T cells (Tse). Responder cell cultures, containing NP-conjugated horse red blood cells (HRBC) and spleen cells from HRBC-primed young or old mice, were assayed on day 4 for anti-NP and anti-HRBC PFC. Suppression was found to be antigen specific and age restricted. NP-specific suppressor cells are easily induced in subculture if the Tsi and Tst cell populations are both derived from young or old mice. Conversely, if Tsi cells from young or old mice are subcultured with Tst cells from mice of a different age, suppression of the anti-NP PFC response is hardly observed. Age restriction was also found to operate in the interactions between subcultured and responder cell populations, indicating that age-matching is required for effective triggering of Tse cells by Tst cells. These results altogether suggest that aging may affect the recognition repertoire expressed in suppressor T cell subsets. Moreover, the finding that suppression is less efficient when exerted on responder spleen cells from old than from young mice provides an explanation for the increased frequency of autoimmune disorders in aging.\r"

High IgE responder mice had higher IgE serum levels than low responder mice both before (100 to 250 vs 2 to 20 ng of IgE/ml) and after (17,000 to 27,000 vs 1,000 to 5,000 ng of IgE/ml) infection. In vitro, mesenteric lymph node cells formed 5- to 10-fold more IgE than the spleen cells. Nu/nu mice had less than 1 ng before and 5 ng of IgE/ml serum after Nbr infection; no IgE was detectable in cell supernatants. There was no difference in the in vivo and in vitro IgE formation between C57BL/6 and C57BL/6-beige mice. Both in vivo and in vitro Nbr-infected Xid+ mice (CBA/N; (CBA/N X BALB/c) F1 male) formed approximately twice the amount of IgE than Xid- mice. Concomitant with the rise of the IgE serum levels, the IgG1 serum level increased by 100 to 1,500 micrograms/ml over preinfection levels in all strains except nu/nu+ mice. The IgM serum level increased by 100 to 500 micrograms/ml. In contrast, the IgG2a and IgG2b levels decreased in most strains, and the IgG3 levels remained unchanged. Nu/nu+ mice showed an increase of all IgG subclasses after Nbr infection. The antibodies to an Nbr extract were predominantly of IgM and IgG1, except in SJL mice which also had IgG2b and nude mice which only had IgM antibodies. The concomitant increase of IgE and IgG1 formation in all but the nude strains suggests that the regulation of these two Ig isotypes may be linked via regulatory T helper cells, which corroborates recent data on the simultaneous induction of IgG1 and IgE synthesis in vitro by the B cell stimulatory factor 1.\r"

  ".W": "The subclass distribution of IgG rheumatoid factor (RF) was determined by a sensitive ELISA assay in sera from patients with rheumatoid arthritis and from normal controls. In both instances, the most important subclasses were IgG1 and IgG4. The IgG4 RF was directed against the Fc region of IgG, and recognized human as well as rabbit IgG. Although human IgG4 myeloma proteins bound to rabbit IgG better than did myelomas of other IgG subclasses, the IgG4 RF activity in rheumatoid sera showed an additional specificity, because the fraction of IgG4 RF/total IgG4 for rheumatoid arthritis sera was far greater than for myelomas. This inference was supported by the observation that there was persistent, albeit diminished, IgG RF activity in pepsin-digested, RF-containing sera (but not myeloma proteins), indicating that a critical component of IgG4 RF activity was contained within the Fab region of the IgG4 molecule. The finding of large quantities of IgG4 RF was not due to a bias of the assay, because the preponderance of IgG4 did not extend to the subclass distribution of antibodies directed against other antigens. The demonstration of an important role for IgG4 as a RF is of special interest because of the relative inability of this subclass to fix complement or to bind to Fc receptors, and because of its potential role as a mediator of increased vascular permeability.\r"

Fifty-three IgG Mab were analyzed from six different fusions (five vs Der p I, one vs Der f I). By antigen binding radioimmunoassay (RIA), most Mab were either Der p I or Der f I specific, and only 2/53 bound to both allergens. Epitope mapping studies using cold Mab to inhibit the binding of six 125I labeled Mab to solid phase allergen defined four nonrepeated, nonoverlapping epitopes on Der p I, a single species-specific epitope on Der f I and a cross-reacting epitope present on each allergen. All but one of the 53 Mab bound to one of these six epitopes. Seventy percent (25/35) of anti-Der p I Mab were directed to the same epitope, suggesting that this epitope is immunodominant for BALB/c mice. Similarly, 88% (16/18) of anti-Der f I Mab bound to the same epitope on Der f I. Parallel cross-inhibition curves were obtained using the species-specific Mab, 10B9, and the cross-reacting Mab, 4C1, to compete for binding to Der p I, suggesting that the epitopes defined by these two Mab on Der p I are adjacent to one another. Both murine Mab and polyclonal rabbit IgG antibodies to cross-reacting sites on both allergens were used to inhibit binding of human IgE antibodies to Der p I by using 19 sera from mite allergic patients. Cross-reacting rabbit IgG antibodies strongly inhibited all sera tested (mean 79.5% +/- 7.7) and two Mab, 10B9 and 4C1, partially inhibited (38% +/- 12). However, the four Mab directed against separate species-specific epitopes (including murine immunodominant sites) showed little or no inhibition (less than or equal to 20%). Our results suggest that most of the epitopes defined by Mab are not the same as, or close to, those defined by human IgE antibody. The striking differences in the repertoires of murine IgG and human IgE antibody responses to Der p I and Der f I could be explained by genetic differences or by altered antigen processing and presentation occurring as a result of different modes of immunization in mice and in mite allergic humans.\r"

Several exceptional strains exhibit constitutive (C4-like) Slp expression, a phenotype that correlates with multiple copies of the Slp gene. To determine the molecular basis for constitutive Slp expression we have isolated genomic clones and compared the sequences of 1.5 kb of 5' flanking DNA from 1 C4 gene and three different Slp genes from the Slp-constitutive strain B10.WR. These sequence comparisons demonstrate C4-like regulatory sequences adjacent to two of the Slp genes. By analysis of cDNA clones isolated from a B10.WR liver library we demonstrate that the constitutive Slp phenotype is due primarily to expression of one of these C4/Slp hybrid genes. It appears likely that Slp gene duplication in strain B10.WR came about via homologous unequal crossover events between C4 and Slp genes; this would accommodate both the gene sequence data and the pattern of C4-like Slp expression in mouse strain B10.WR.\r"

Results of family studies are consistent with a three allele system (t61, t62 and t63) at the t-locus. By SDS PAGE, electrophoretic mobilities of the multiple SC bands for each of the three allotypes are characteristic of the allotype; the apparent molecular sizes of the bands of the t62 allotype are 2 to 3 kDa lower than those for the t61 allotype. The banding patterns of the t61 and t63, although similar, are not identical to each other. Results of serologic cross-reaction studies and of tryptic peptide mapping studies suggest multiple structural differences between the allotypes as well as a closer relationship between t62 and t63 than between either of these allotypes and t61.\r"

  ".W": "The first component of human complement was separated from C1-INH by sucrose linear gradient ultracentrifugation. Activation of C1 was studied in the absence and presence of immune complexes; activation was monitored by SDS-PAGE and Western blot. When the partially purified native C1 preparation was incubated at 37 degrees C without immune complexes, activated C1s appeared after 30 min in the case of eightfold dilution with respect to the original serum, and after 45 min with 32-fold dilution. Kinetics of appearance of activated C1r was the same as that of activated C1s. From the following results, we concluded that spontaneous activation may be partially due to proteolytic enzymes contaminating the preparation: 1) a nonspecific protease inhibitor, PMSF, completely inhibited spontaneous activation but did not inhibit the activation of C1 by immune complexes; 2) alpha 2-macroglobulin partially inhibited spontaneous activation, and 3) although spontaneous activation in the absence of PMSF was relatively slow, activated C1 accelerated spontaneous activation that was completely blocked by C1-INH. In contrast to spontaneous activation, the partially purified native C1 was rapidly activated by immune complexes: within 5 min almost all C1 was activated by rabbit IgG anti-human IgM-human IgM complexes. These results support conclusions derived from activation studies when using native C1 and hemolytic assays, and do not support those derived from the activation studies with reconstituted C1 and SDS-PAGE analysis. We suggest that the contradictions can be resolved if one assumes that C1 activation can be both an intra- and intermolecular process; which process dominates is determined by the state of C1 and by experimental conditions.\r"

  ".W": "Histamine release occurs during the late phase allergic reaction concomitantly with neutrophil (PMN) infiltration. To determine whether PMN might release a factor capable of causing histamine release, supernatants generated by incubating human PMN in the presence or absence of specific activators were added to rat basophilic leukemia cells (RBL) and histamine release was measured. PMN supernatants from 17 of 21 donors induced noncytotoxic histamine release. Neutrophil-derived histamine-releasing activity, termed HRA-N, was dose-dependent and supernatants from greater than or equal to 10(7) PMN/ml caused 6 to 27% net histamine release from RBL. PMN supernatants induced histamine release as effectively as did intact PMN cocultured with RBL. The capacity of various donors to generate HRA-N was not related to atopic status or gender but was inversely related to the proportion of eosinophils (EOS) contaminating the PMN isolate (the larger the proportion of EOS, the lower the histamine release). Addition of EOS to PMN during the generation of HRA-N completely inhibited histamine-releasing activity. HRA-N was not released from mononuclear cells or platelets contaminating the PMN preparation. HRA-N release was not increased by the presence of either serum-treated zymosan or phorbol myristate acetate, agents that caused dose-related release of PMN granule enzymes. Indeed, HRA-N was released from unstimulated PMN in the complete absence of granule enzyme release. HRA-N release was detectable by 15 min and the majority of release occurred between 45 and 60 min of incubation. Thus, the data indicate that HRA-N is released spontaneously from human PMN and that HRA-N release is independent of primary or secondary PMN granule release. It is attractive to suggest that release of HRA-N by PMN might act to recruit mast cells or basophils into participating in acute inflammatory reactions.\r"

To define the antigens responsible for inducing lymphocyte responses, fast protein liquid chromatography was used to fractionate the antigens of Brugia malayi adult worms which were then tested on lymphocytes from patients with filariasis and normal controls. From an anion exchange column (Mono Q), three peaks of lymphocyte-stimulating activity were eluted which were further fractionated by gel filtration (Superose-12). Peak I induced both a proliferative response as well as the production of filaria-specific antibody in patient lymphocytes. Peak II, capable of inducing only a proliferative response (without antibody production) in patient lymphocytes, was a glycoprotein with phosphocholine as one of the antigenic determinants. Peak III induced proliferative responses in both patient and normal lymphocytes and thus appears to be mitogenic. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis was then used to identify changes in the major cellular proteins associated with the activation of patient lymphocytes by these partially purified antigens. Stimulation of patient lymphocytes with peak I resulted in increased synthesis of immunoglobulin heavy, light, and J chains. Further, these were the only major secreted proteins found in the culture supernatants. Peak II resulted in quantitative changes in proteins associated with T and not B lymphocyte stimulation. Further analysis of these antigens should help to elucidate the mechanism of host-parasite interaction at both the cellular and molecular levels.\r"

  ".W": "We have shown recently that alteration of the membrane fluidity of either effector or target cells results in significant and selective inhibition of NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity (NK CMC). However, the localization of the defective stage in the NK lytic pathway is not known. In the present study, we show that rigidification of the NK-sensitive U937 target cell membrane by lipid modulation reduces its sensitivity to lysis by NK cytotoxic factor (NKCF). This resistance was not due to loss of NKCF binding sites on the target cell because target cells with rigid membranes absorbed more NKCF than control cells. The enhanced ability to absorb NKCF by membrane modification was supported by data showing that NK-resistant Raji cells lacking NKCF-binding sites absorb NKCF after lipid modification. Furthermore, consistent with the lipophilic nature of NKCF, synthetic lipid vesicles absorb NKCF. In contrast to membrane rigidification, membrane fluidization of the target cell did not change the target cell properties. Rigidification of the NK effector cell membrane abrogates it ability to secrete active NKCF when stimulated by target cells or by mitogens. Membrane fluidization of the NK effector cells did not inhibit their ability to release NKCF. The results of these studies demonstrate that inhibition of NK CMC by rigidification of the target cell membrane results in cells that are inhibited in processing bound NKCF to lysis. Inhibition of NK CMC by rigidification of the NK effector cell results in defective trigger for activation of the NKCF release mechanism.\r"

Whereas in NWL animals CN serum levels markedly increase 3 to 4 days after immunization, OS animals did not respond with CN elevation. B) A single i.v. injection of conditioned medium (CM) from concanavalin A-stimulated spleen cells also led to a transient, dose-dependent peak in plasma CN (maximum after 30 min). This CN response to a given CM preparation was significantly lower in OS than in NWL animals. C) CM, whether obtained from OS or NWL splenocytes, were equally effective to stimulate CN production. D) A single i.v. injection of CM leads--concomitantly to the CN peak--to a decrease of the concanavalin A-mediated proliferative response of peripheral blood lymphocytes in both OS and NWL chickens. This suppression, however, was significantly more pronounced in NWL chickens. In summary, these data suggest a disturbance of the immune-neuroendocrine communication in OS chickens with spontaneous thyroid autoimmunity. The possible implications for the generation of \"forbidden\" autoimmune responses are discussed.\r"

  ".W": "The aim of this study was to identify constituents of the intermediate C5b-7 complex of human complement that mediate binding of C8 and formation of C5b-8. Analysis of interactions between purified C8 and C5, C6, or C7 indicate that C5 and C8 associate to form a dimer in solution. This interaction is specific and involves a single C5 binding site located on the beta-subunit of C8. Simultaneous interaction of C8 with C5 and C9 in solution suggests that during assembly of the cytolytic C5b-9 complex on membranes, C8 binds to C5b-7 through association of beta with C5b, after which C9 associates through interaction with the previously identified C9-specific site on the alpha-subunit. Other evidence of interaction with C5b was provided by the fact that C8 can bind purified C5b6. Also, in situ cross-linking experiments showed that within C5b-8, the beta-subunit is in close proximity to C5b. These results indicate that C8 binding to C5b-7 is mediated by a specific C5b recognition site on beta, thus explaining the requirement for this subunit in C5b-8 formation. They also reveal that C5b contains a specific site for interaction with beta.\r"

Neuraminidase-treated (NT)-PMN bound and internalized [3H]FMLP (used as receptor marker) as well as normal PMN. NT-PMN, however, retained more [3H]FMLP-associated radioactivity than normal PMN. Subcellular fractionation studies demonstrated that NT-PMN retained more sedimentable (100,000 X G for 180 min) [3H]FMLP-associated radioactivity within light Golgi-containing fractions than normal PMN. Furthermore, NT-PMN exhibited a defect in their ability to reexpress (or recycle) a population of FMLP receptors. Abnormal receptor recycling was associated with inhibition of FMLP-induced PMN chemotaxis. Thus, it appears that recycling of formyl peptide receptors may be necessary for optimal PMN chemotactic responses to FMLP. We postulate that removal of PMN surface sialic acid inhibits FMLP-induced PMN chemotaxis by blocking the reexpression (or recycling) of a population of formyl peptide receptors, perhaps by preventing trafficking of desialated receptors through a light Golgi pathway.\r"

  ".W": "Freshly harvested mouse peritoneal cells, from normal lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-responsive (Lpsn) mice, were capable of transferring an antiviral state (to vesicular stomatitis virus) to \"in vitro aged\" mouse macrophages permissive for viral replication. The transfer of the antiviral state was completely abrogated by addition of antibody to interferon (IFN)-alpha/beta in the co-culture medium. In contrast, even large numbers of donor peritoneal cells from LPS-hyporesponsive (Lpsd) C3H/HeJ and C57BL/10ScCR mice did not transfer an antiviral state to target cells. Although peritoneal macrophages from Lpsd mice did not transfer an antiviral state to target cells, they were nevertheless found to be in an antiviral state when first placed in culture. Injection of mice with antibody to mouse IFN-alpha/beta rendered peritoneal macrophages from both Lpsn and Lpsd mice permissive for vesicular stomatitis virus. The decay of this initial antiviral state in peritoneal macrophages during in vitro culture was far more rapid for Lpsd mice than for normal mice. Addition of antibody to mouse IFN-alpha/beta markedly enhanced the in vitro decay of the antiviral state of peritoneal macrophages. Treatment of total peritoneal cells from Lpsn mice with LPS resulted in IFN production, whereas IFN was not detected in the cellfree medium of LPS-treated peritoneal cells from Lpsd C3H/HeJ and C57BL/10ScCR mice. Genetic studies with F1 hybrids between Lpsn and Lpsd mice and with Lpsn and Lpsd recombinant inbred strains revealed a striking correlation between the capacity of peritoneal cells to transfer an antiviral state and their capacity to produce IFN after stimulation with LPS, suggesting that closely linked, if not identical, genes are in some way involved in the transfer of antiviral state as well as in the LPS response by peritoneal cells of normal mice.\r"

In a laboratory model, BALB/c mice were primed by different schedules of infection with H3N1, H3N2, and H3N7 viruses and given H3N2 and H7N2 vaccines equivalent in NA immunogenicity. In schedules using sequential infections, but not after a single infection with any virus, anti-N2 booster response was fourfold greater with H7N2 vaccine and was reciprocal to the magnitude of anti-H3 response. Thus, HA-influenced suppression of immunologic response to viral NA requires adequate HA priming but is not unique to man and can be studied in the murine model. An incidental finding of this study was the sharing of cross-reactive determinants by N1, N2, and N7 NA.\r"

At this time, one can substitute basic fibroblast growth factor for TPA.

The radiolabeled antimelanoma antibody specifically accumulated only in the tumor lesions, whereas no radioactivity was observed in normal tissues or organs. The distribution patterns of the radioactive antibody in the tumor lesions depended on the sizes of the tumor. Almost the entire region of the small metastatic tumor in lymph nodes was labeled, whereas the radioactive antibody was irregularly localized mainly in the center of the medium-sized tumor. However, only the peripheral region of the large primary tumor was labeled. The highest uptake of radioactivity (tumor:blood ratio) was observed in the small lymph node metastatic tumor lesions rather than in the large primary tumor. Furthermore, high resolution color imaging of B16 melanoma was also obtained by using 125I-labeled monoclonal antibody. Tumor location was specifically visible without subtraction or enhancement methods 3-5 days after injection of the radiolabeled antibody.\r"

  ".W": "Regulation of collagen gene expression was studied in keloids and fibroblast cultures established from keloid biopsies from 9 patients. The collagen concentration in keloid tissue was not different from that in normal skin. The activities of 2 enzymes catalyzing intracellular collagen biosynthesis, prolyl 4-hydroxylase (PH) and galactosylhydroxylysyl glucosyltransferase (GGT) were significantly elevated in the keloids, the mean increase in the former enzyme being 5-fold and in the latter 3-fold with respect to the controls. The mean procollagen production rate in the keloid fibroblasts was at the control level, with only 1 keloid cell line showing a procollagen synthesis rate higher than the mean value + 2 SD of the controls. The mean PH and GGT activities of the keloid fibroblasts were not elevated, but PH activity in 2 cell lines and GGT activity in 1 cell line were higher than the mean + 2 SD for the controls. Cellular type I, III, IV, and V procollagen mRNAs were measured by slot blot hybridization using specific human cDNA clones for the various collagen types. The amounts of type I, III, and V procollagen mRNAs corresponded to the ratios in which these collagen types are produced by fibroblasts. No synthesis of type IV procollagen mRNA by keloid fibroblasts was observed. The total amount of type I and III procollagen mRNAs correlated significantly (p less than 0.01) with the procollagen synthesis rate measured after radioactive labeling of the cells in the keloid and control fibroblasts, indicating that collagen production in these cells is mainly controlled by regulating the final steady state levels of collagen mRNA. The results suggest that fibroblasts isolated from keloids often synthesize normal amounts of collagen.\r"

By electron microscopy, mastocytosis mast cells appeared larger than normal skin mast cells, frequently had atypical, highly indented or bilobed nuclei, and each contained numerous, elongated cytoplasmic projections. Suspensions of mastocytosis mast cells were obtained from lesional skin biopsy specimens, and their response to both immunologic and nonimmunologic secretagogues was compared with mast cells from normal skin. Lesional skin mast cells had a net histamine release of 12.3% (+/- 1.3 SEM) and 31.1% (+/- 6.0 SEM) following stimulation with the purified human anaphylotoxin C3a and mouse monoclonal antihuman IgE antibodies, respectively. This specific release was similar to the responses observed in normal skin mast cells (11.5% +/- 4.5 SEM and 16.7% +/- 2.1 SEM, respectively). Mast cells from cutaneous lesions of mastocytosis also responded to the nonimmunologic secretagogues, morphine sulfate and calcium ionophore A23187 with a specific histamine release of 15.1% (+/- 1.2 SEM) and 39.8% (+/- 8.7 SEM), respectively. The results of this study demonstrate that mast cells from lesions of mastocytosis are morphologically atypical, but have a histamine content similar to normal skin mast cells and retain their functional reactivities to clinically relevant secretory stimuli.\r"

In addition, the melanotropin analogs stimulated follicular eumelanogenesis when applied topically to the skin of mice. The melanotropins were transdermally delivered to the systemic circulation as evidenced by the fact that eumelanogenesis was stimulated in hair follicles in areas distant from the site of topical application. These results demonstrate that peptide hormone analogs can be transported across the skin. The unique actions of the melanotropin analogs may relate to the fact that these peptides are nonbiodegradable and thus exert prolonged actions on melanocytes. These compounds may prove important for studies on normal integumental melanogenesis and for the treatment of hypopigmentary disorders in humans.\r"

  ".W": "Dimethyl sulfoxide's (DMSO) concentration-dependent influences on its own permeation rate through hairless mouse skin and on the concurrent permeation rates of water and the antiviral drug vidarabine (ara-A) have been studied at 37 degrees C using in vitro diffusion cells. Solubilities of ara-A in DMSO-water mixtures were also determined in order to assess ara-A's relative thermodynamic activity in the binary solvent media used in the mass transfer studies. Solubilities increased exponentially with increasing percentages of DMSO. Activity coefficients decreased accordingly. When the same DMSO medium was placed in each side of diffusion cell (balanced solvent configuration) permeability coefficients for ara-A decreased exactly as ara-A's solubility increased up to a 50% DMSO concentration, indicating the observed decreases in the mass transfer coefficients have thermodynamic origins. When DMSO media were placed in either the donor or receiver side of the cell up to the same 50% concentration point and opposed by a normal saline medium on the other side (asymmetric solvent configurations), the permeability of ara-A did not decrease and at some DMSO levels was substantially increased, behavior in marked departure from thermodynamic control. The behavior disparity between the 2 configurations of the cell suggests that cross-currents of solvents play a role in permeability enhancement. Regardless of solvent configuration, permeability coefficients for ara-A at 90 and 100% DMSO strengths were exaggeratedly large, consistent with severe impairment of the stratum corneum. Similar overall permeability behavior was observed for the 2 solvents, water and DMSO. Possible underlying mechanisms for these effects and the relative importance of the various mechanisms of DMSO enhancement as a function of DMSO's concentration and configuration are discussed.\r"

The mechanism of selective destruction of pigmented cells by various lasers, however, has not been fully clarified. Black, brown, and albino guinea pigs were exposed to optical pulses at various radiant exposure doses from a Q-switched, 40 nsec, 694 nm ruby laser. Biopsies were analyzed by light and electron microscopy (EM). Albino animals failed to develop clinical or microscopic evidence of cutaneous injury after irradiation. In both black and brown animals, the clinical threshold for gross change was 0.4 J/cm2, which produced an ash-white spot. By light microscopy, alterations appeared at 0.3 J/cm2 and included separation at the dermoepidermal junction, and the formation of vacuolated epidermal cells with a peripheral cytoplasmic condensation of pigment. By EM, enlarged melanosomes with a central lucent zone were observed within affected epidermal cells at 0.3 J/cm2. At 0.8 and 1.2 J/cm2, individual melanosomes were more intensely damaged and disruption of melanosomes deep in the hair papillae was observed. Dermal-epidermal blisters were formed precisely at the lamina lucida, leaving basal cell membranes and hemidesmosomes intact. Possible mechanisms for melanosomal injury are discussed. These observations show that the effects of the Q-switched ruby laser are melanin-specific and melanin-dependent, and may be useful in the selective destruction of pigmented as well as superficial cutaneous lesions.\r"

We reviewed 19 episodes of ventriculoperitoneal shunt infections due to CNST in 17 patients. Eleven episodes of infection were caused by slime-producing CNST and eight by non-slime-producing CNST. Shunt obstruction and abdominal pain occurred more frequently when infectious episodes were due to slime-producing CNST than to non-slime-producing CNST (P less than .05). Despite appropriate antimicrobial therapy, the mean duration of fever was longer and the failure to eradicate the infecting organisms was more frequent when the infectious episodes were due to slime-producing CNST than to non-slime-producing CNST (P less than .025). Discriminate function analysis found, however, that only failure to eradicate the infecting organism (by antimicrobial therapy) occurred more frequently in infectious episodes due to slime-producing CNST than to non-slime-producing CNST (P = .01).\r"

Vaccinia virus was labeled with 14C or 3H, incubated with neutrophils, and quantified in neutrophil pellets in a new radiometric phagocytosis assay. Better results were obtained from assays of [3H]thymidine-labeled virus; uptake increased through 1 hr and then plateaued. Phagocytosis of 3H-labeled Staphylococcus aureus was normal. Uptake of virus was serum dependent. Hexose monophosphate shunt activity was measured by two methods. No 14CO2 from [14C]1-glucose accompanied uptake of vaccinia virus, in contrast to the respiratory burst accompanying bacterial phagocytosis. Electron microscopy showed intact to slightly digested intraphagolysosomal vaccinia virus. Pock reduction assay showed a decrease in viral content due to neutrophils until 6 hr of incubation, when a modest but significant increase was observed. Thus, neutrophil uptake of vaccinia virus is distinguished from bacterial phagocytosis.\r"

Twenty to 21 bands were observed with the cytoplasmic component, whereas 10 and 9, respectively, were seen with the nuclear and high-speed pellet antigens. The most intense reactions occurred with the higher-molecular-mass proteins (50-215 kDa) by using the cytoplasmic and high-speed antigens and with the more rapidly migrating proteins (less than 50 kDa) by using the nuclear antigen. The precipitin responses increased for three months or more after onset of symptoms with the nuclear and high-speed pellet antigens but peaked within one to two months with the cytoplasmic antigen.\r"

  ".W": "The use of ovulation induction for multiple follicular growth in in vitro fertilization (IVF) has introduced the problem of follicular asynchrony. As a consequence of the asynchrony, the parameters most commonly used by IVF groups to assess follicular and oocyte quality within those follicles are not sufficiently sensitive or specific. Thus, each follicle must be considered separately, and specific markers of follicular and/or oocyte maturation must be sought from within the follicle. In this review we analyze previous reports of potential markers of follicular and oocyte maturation. In regards to the follicular fluid constituents, the level of estradiol in follicular fluid correlates with fertilization and pregnancy in stimulated cycles. Other steroids are only helpful when specific stimulation protocols are used. The level of some follicular proteins such as alpha-1-antitrypsin and fibrinogen also correlates with fertilization and pregnancy outcome. Cyclic AMP levels in follicular fluid are significantly reduced in follicles leading to conception. Regulators of oocyte maturation, such as the Oocyte Maturation Inhibitor (OMI) or the Meiosis Inducing Substance (MIS) have also been correlated with IVF outcome, but their exact structure remains still unknown. In addition, other sophisticated parameters, such as chemotactic activity of human leukocytes, or simple methods, such as the presence of intrafollicular echoes, have also been used as successful markers in predicting IVF outcome.\r"

Of the 23 ongoing or term pregnancies produced, 21 came from transfers of at least one embryo that had reached four-cell stage by 40 hr postinsemination. Pregnancy rates were unaffected in either the fast-cleaving or the slower-cleaving embryos by culturing in vitro for an additional 24 hr. The presence of anucleate cell fragments also had no effect on pregnancy rates. Pregnancy rates increased progressively with the transfer of more embryos per transfer. These results suggest that procedures to improve ovulation induction and in vitro embryo culture technique may better the success of in vitro fertilization by providing a high number of rapidly cleaving embryos for transfer.\r"

The objective of this paper is to analyze the effect of the quality of oocytes, the husband's semen characteristics, and category of the couple's infertility on the number of spermatozoa bound to the zona pellucida. One hundred eighty-one oocytes which failed to fertilize or failed to cleave were fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde 40 to 60 hr after insemination in vitro and examined under interference microscopy and the number of sperm bound to the zone pellucida was determined. The means +/- SD of sperm bound to mature, immature, and atretic oocytes were 51.0 +/- 50.7, 7.3 +/- 12.1 10.4 +/- 17.8, respectively. Fertilized mature oocytes (81.0 +/- 53.3) had a significantly higher number of sperm bound to zonae compared to unfertilized oocytes (41.8 +/- 47.3). It is  concluded that the number of sperm bound to zonae is functionally important. The sperm motility and the number of motile sperm used to inseminate oocytes were significantly correlated with the number of sperm bound to zonae, whereas sperm morphology and sperm concentration did not correlate. This study supports the notion that sperm motility is the single most important factor influencing fertilization of human oocytes in vitro.\r"

The concentrations of estradiol (E2), progesterone (P), testosterone (T), and prolactin (PRL) were measured in follicular fluid and related to the maturation of the oocyte-corona-cumulus complex (OCCC) and the fertilization of oocytes. Follicles containing mature oocytes had significantly higher follicular fluid E2 and P levels than follicles with intermediate and immature oocytes. A constant decrease in PRL and T values with advancing follicular maturation was observed. Similar results were obtained when the fertilizing ability of the oocytes was examined. The gradual decline in follicular fluid PRL and T levels during follicular development was connected with increasing E2 and P biosynthesis and therefore seems to be an important precondition for normal follicular and oocyte maturation.\r"

This fact, along with the treatment's multiplicity of procedures and intensity, place unique emotional demands on patients. The goal of this research was to describe both the acknowledged emotional state of patients at the time they began the in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer (IVF-ET) process and the emotional experience of the actual procedures themselves. The findings can be used to develop strategies for providing emotional support. Data were collected from self-administered questionnaires returned by 94 IVF-ET patients in three Houston programs during a 6-month period. At the time of the IVF procedure, 77% of the population reported that infertility was still a painful concern, not something with which they had learned to live. The loss of control, seen by most patients as infertility's most stressful dimension, left them vulnerable to the intense stresses of in vitro fertilization, less able to handle its multiple demands. Thus for many, the IVF-ET procedures were like an emotional roller coaster on which they experienced a wide range of feelings during a brief period of time. Not surprisingly, emotional strain was a major consideration influencing the decision whether or not to repeat IVF. Patients indicated specific services which the staff could provide to reduce the stress of the procedures.\r"

ABEP peak latencies as well as interpeak latency differences, and also the effect of increasing stimulus rate, were determined for each patient and compared with the clinical symptoms. The psychoacoustic and ABEP detection thresholds were also compared. A highly significant correlation was observed between ABEP detection threshold and the psychoacoustically determined hearing threshold, and the differences between them were found to be insignificant. The results of this study indicate a central component in sudden deafness. This impairment manifests itself in abnormal effects of increasing stimulus rate on ABEP, and may be related to reduced central synaptic efficacy.\r"

The explanation for the symptomatology in patients who suffer from reflux oesophagitis is probably referred pain from the region of the lower oesophageal sphincter rather than spasm of the upper sphincter. The expression globus hystericus is outdated and should be discarded, and we recommended describing the symptoms as primary globus pharyngeus when there is no evident cause and secondary globus pharyngeus when the aetiology is detectable.\r"

The disease is a chronic suppurative infection caused by micro-organisms from the actinomyces group, most often israelii. Actinomyces species are all oral commensals. They are gram-positive, non acid-fast, anaerobic or microaerophilic filamentous bacteria (Walker et al., 1981; Bennhoff, 1984). Associated flora of both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria are always present, most frequently anaerobic streptococci, fusiform or gram-negative bacilli, and hemophilus species. The associated flora form a kind of symbiosis with the actinomyces species and may cause an anaerobic environment which furthers the growth of these species (Bennhoff, 1984). Topographically, a distinction is made between 3 favorite localizations: 1. Cervico-facial (55 per cent); 2. Abdomino-pelvic (20 per cent); and 3. Pulmo-thoracic (15 per cent).\r"

Most urologists performed vasectomies, whereas family physicians and general surgeons were less likely to do so. As expected, most physicians used local anesthesia, occasionally in combination with a sedative; however, 22 percent of physicians reported using general anesthesia for at least some vasectomies. Complication rates were in the ranges reported by previous case series. Physicians who performed between one and ten vasectomies in 1982 had higher rates of hematoma and hospitalization for treatment of a complication than physicians who performed more vasectomies. Maintenance of surgical skills appears to be important in preventing complications of this usually low-risk procedure.\r"

  ".W": "Acute bronchitis is a common syndrome characterized by upper respiratory tract infection accompanied by productive cough in persons without chronic lung disease. As a first step in investigating the potential role of pulmonary airflow disturbances in acute bronchitis, 27 adult patients with acute bronchitis performed serial pulmonary function tests and daily peak flow measurements and completed daily symptom diaries. Eleven patients (40 percent) had a forced expiratory volume of the first second (FEV1) at entry less than 80 percent of predicted. Mean FEV1, forced midexpiratory flow rate (FEF25-75), and peak flow measures showed steady improvement over the five-week period. Differences between initial and final flow rates were statistically significant. These changes were particularly evident when two groups were created by stratifying by \"abnormal\" (FEV1 less than or equal to 80 percent predicted) and \"normal\" (FEV1 greater than 80 percent predicted) initial FEV1. Total duration of cough and subjective ratings of cough severity were not predicted by initial FEV1, but work absence was significantly higher in the abnormal group. The finding of reversible airway obstruction suggests a role for bronchospasm in many cases of acute bronchitis and calls for further research regarding proof of rapid reversibility and treatment with bronchodilators.\r"

In this study, a computerized, simulated encounter with an alcoholic patient was used to assess the performance of a randomly selected sample of primary care physicians in diagnosing alcoholism. Of 95 physicians in this study, only 32 percent diagnosed alcoholism with maximal certainty. There was great variability among physicians in the threshold of information needed to diagnose alcoholism. One third of subjects misinterpreted symptoms of alcoholism and erroneously made other psychiatric diagnoses, chiefly anxiety or depression. Results of this pilot study were not associated with the physicians' age, sex, specialty, duration of training, or reported personal impact of alcoholism. This study provides further evidence of the need for additional education of primary care physicians if such physicians are to succeed in reducing the dramatic impact of alcoholism and alcohol abuse on public health.\r"

The two groups were compared with a third control group of 40 smokers who expressed no desire to stop smoking. At the end of one year, 12.2 percent of those receiving only gum and 10 percent receiving gum and instruction had stopped smoking, compared with a 20 percent cessation rate for the control group. The observed difference was not statistically significant (P greater than .05). Results of this study suggest that the use of nicotine gum alone may not be a viable alternative for family physicians whose patients desire to quit smoking.\r"

  ".W": "Specific, measurable health objectives for the nation have helped guide federal, state, and local policy in disease prevention and health promotion during the 1980s. About one half of these objectives will probably be achieved by 1990. Public awareness of hypertension and its consequences, for example, is at very high levels. Although the physician's office is a key setting for accomplishing many of the objectives, physicians remain largely uninformed about them and uninvolved in the broader process of public health policy formulation. Family medicine, as a specialty concerned about the care of the individual in the context of family and community, has much to contribute to future public health planning efforts. A plan for drafting the year 2000 objectives is beginning. Because the objectives will help shape health policy in the future, family physicians should be involved in developing appropriate health objectives for the nation and helping to implement them.\r"

  ".W": "The present study attempts to delineate the course of depressive illness in suicidal, depressed inpatients as compared with a matched group of nonsuicidal, depressed inpatients. Thirty adult nonpsychotic psychiatric inpatients presenting with symptoms of a major depressive episode participated in the present study. Two subject groups were identified, one suicidal and the other nonsuicidal according to their responses on the Modified Scale for Suicidal Ideation. Subjects were assessed on a variety of self-report measures and several clinical interviews during hospitalization and follow-ups at 4, 10 and 16 months after discharge. Results supported the hypothesis that, although displaying similar levels of depression during hospitalization as well as at long-term follow-up, the two groups differed in the speed of their recovery. Approximately 4 months after discharge virtually all of the nonsuicidal patients had recovered, whereas a majority of the suicidal group remained quite depressed. These results suggest that more time is needed for the recovery process to occur in suicidal patients. Future research in the area of depression and suicide should take into account the different courses seen in these two groups of subjects. Furthermore, those who treat suicidally depressed patients should be cautions of the slow recovery of these patients.\r"

Comorbid BPD effects on UNI include earlier onset and absence of psychotic symptoms at baseline and more substance abuse and use of psychiatric treatment at follow-up. Comorbid UNI effects on BPD include better premorbid instrumental functioning, later onset at baseline, and a higher risk for suicide over the long term. Other noteworthy findings are a low rate of suicide (2%) among the noncomorbid BPD patients and a high rate of diagnostic instability (68%) among the noncomorbid UNI patients. Findings demonstrate a lack of syndromal stability within and among all three study groups and highlight the shortcomings of DSM-III for the investigation of comorbidity.\r"

No detectable medicine level was found in 25 (61%) of the patients and a therapeutic level by American standards was found in only six (15%), indicating a high incidence of noncompliance. A Cambodian subgroup, however, was significantly more compliant than either the Vietnamese or Mein patients. After patient education and a discussion of problems and benefits of medicine, compliance improved with Vietnamese and Cambodians but not with the Mien. Cultural and educational factors influence compliance with medicine and responsiveness to education. Because the Cambodians also suffered from posttraumatic stress disorder, it is probable that the presence of this illness increased compliance. Preliminary data among these patients indicate that Asians probably need the same dose of imipramine as Americans to achieve a \"therapeutic\" level. Reports that Asians need lower doses of TCA medicine are limited by the high noncompliance rates with Asians. These high rates probably reflect cultural beliefs about illness and medication usage. It is valuable to perform TCA blood levels on Asian patients for whom antidepressants have been prescribed to monitor compliance and to lead into a discussion of benefits and side effects of the medicine. Evidence of noncompliance can lead to a productive doctor-patient discussion about beliefs and effects of the medication.\r"

Multiple regression analysis involving nine predictor variables revealed that self-reported nervous illness during the war and depressive illness since the war had pronounced independent effects on current depression as measured by the Zung Scale. Being married and better educated had significant protective effects against depression for the non-POWs while being employed and having higher socioeconomic status were protective for POWs. A clear linkage was shown from wartime nervous illness to postwar depressive illness to present-day depression.\r"

Most patients in the second category demonstrate an improvement in their ERG when the responses recorded following levodopa infusion were compared with baseline responses obtained during the period of medication withdrawal.

The patients' ocular saccades were characterised by an increased variability of their latencies and reduced accuracy, with normal velocity profiles apart from saccadic duration. Their smooth pursuit had a decreased velocity gain. Similar abnormalities were found with manual tracking. Clinical improvement with dopaminergic drugs was associated with an improvement of saccadic accuracy and smooth pursuit gain. It is postulated that the ocular motor changes seen in Parkinson's disease are contingent upon functional dopamine levels in the basal ganglia.\r"

In order to examine the relationship of sensory threshold and handedness the latter was assessed by means of the Edinburgh Inventory.

Of right-handers tested 73.5% had a lower threshold on the left side while 70.8% of left-handers had a lower threshold on the right side.

In only the first patient did the electrical stimulation of nerves evoke \"late repetitive response\" (LRR), which resembled the wave forms of the myokymic discharge. Epidural and peripheral nerve blocks abolished myokymia in the first and second cases, but peripheral nerve block was without effect in the third patient.

Splenic cells from two inbred murine strains (BALB/c and SJL/J) are activated (immunized) in vitro by co-culture with their respective syngeneic skeletal muscle myotubes. Subsequent injection of the activated splenocytes with or without B. pertussis into the respective syngeneic hosts results in inflammatory myopathy in the SJL/J mice but never in the BALB/c mice. The muscle inflammation is very similar in appearance to human autoimmune inflammatory myopathies. The myositis is not effector cell-skeletal muscle specific because splenocytes activated by co-culture with smooth muscle will also elicit skeletal muscle lesions. Both strains of skeletal muscle appear to express class II (Ia) antigens and the splenocytes from both strains appear to be equally activated. Thus we postulate that the difference in the expression of myositis between the two strains is in the effector phase of the disease. Since SJL/J mice have vasoactive amine sensitive vascular systems and BALB/c do not, it is likely that activated splenocytes emigrate from muscle microvessels in the SJL/J strain whereas they cannot do so in the BALB/c strain. The most significant contribution of this model may be in its potential for addressing a sine qua non of cellular autoimmune disease, i.e. lymphocyte migration from the vascular compartment into the target tissue. Finally, the data support a cellular more than a humoral pathogenesis in this model.\r"

In degenerating muscle a decrease in the density of caveolae was observed. In regenerating extensor digitorum longus muscle, a decrease in the density of orthogonal arrays and an increase in the density of caveolae was present. The results show that freeze fracture alterations in fast twitch regenerating muscle are similar to those seen in the muscles of patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy.\r"

A sural nerve biopsy taken at age 60 had shown lipid storage in Schwann and interstitial cells, and a pronounced loss of unmyelinated fibers. The neurons of the L5 spinal ganglion and, to a lesser extent, all neurons of the sacral spinal cord, contained large lipid inclusions which in electron micrographs differed from those in Schwann and satellite cells. There was no storage material in glial cells. The neuronal inclusions were membrane-bound and consisted of electron-dense and electron-lucent components. There was evidence of neuronal death in the spinal ganglion, and a diameter histogram showed that small cytons had preferentially been lost. The inclusions probably were secondary lysosomes or residual bodies, and resembled giant lipofuscin granules. Nevertheless, they were uncolored and displayed weak autofluorescence as compared to the aging pigment in control ganglia. It is tentatively suggested that the syringomyelia-like neuropathy in Tangier disease represents a lysosomal storage disorder preferentially affecting small dorsal root ganglion cells.\r"

  ".W": "A strain of rapidly growing meat-type chickens was fed a diet deficient in riboflavin from 1-40 days of age. Diminished growth rate, progressive gait abnormality and reluctance to move were noted beginning on day 8. Neurologic abnormalities were related to peripheral neuropathy characterized by Schwann cell hypertrophy and degeneration with cytoplasmic lipid droplets' and segmental demyelination. Lesions were initially detected on day 10, and in concert with clinical signs became more profound between days 14 and 21. Sequestration of myelin debris within Schwann cells was common. Other features of the neuropathy included the presence of endoneurial edema and axonal degeneration involving small numbers of fibers. Remyelination of peripheral nerve fibers in birds on the deficient diet was occasionally seen on day 10, became progressively more prominent, and was marked by day 37. There was an associated, variable but incomplete, clinical improvement evident in later stages of the study. Liver concentrations of riboflavin in deficient birds were significantly reduced on day 13 but not on day 26. This neuropathy may be related to diminished tissue levels of the riboflavin-based coenzymes flavin-adenine dinucleotide (FAD) and flavin mononucleotide (FMN) leading to reduced cellular energy levels and profoundly affecting Schwann cells at some critical point in growth.\r"

JCV DNA was identified predominantly in the nuclei of interfascicular oligodendrocytes in demyelinated areas of the biopsies. JC virus was isolated from one case, and the diagnosis of PML was substantiated in all cases by electron microscopic identification or immunocytochemical labeling of JC viral antigen.

Light microscopy demonstrated OLD with pigmented macrophages and glial cells. Electron microscopy showed electron-dense, membrane-bound intracytoplasmic lamellar inclusions with curved or straight parallel arrangement, or fingerprint pattern, in white matter macrophages, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. Cortical cells contained lipofuscin which was normal in type and amount. This suggests that the material in white matter glial cells and macrophages is ceroid pigment, however, the distribution is not that seen in ceroid-lipofuscinosis. Similar inclusions have been found in oligodendrocytes in other forms of OLD. Biochemical study did not show evidence of demyelination. Galactolipids were normal. Polyunsaturated fatty acids were decreased. The most striking feature was an increase in plasmalogens.\r"

The hypothalamic nuclei were most commonly involved, followed by the optic system and the septum pellucidum. Other lesions were found in the cerebral cortex, corpus callosum, olfactory system and cerebellum. The hypopituitarism appeared to have been secondary to hypothalamic damage rather than to intrinsic pituitary defect. A virtually normal histology and the usual endocrine cell populations were demonstrated by immunocytochemistry in the adenohypophysis. Damage to the neurophysin-containing cells of the hypothalamus explains the various degrees of clinically observed diabetes insipidus.\r"

  ".W": "From June 1973 to May 1978, a total of 845 women with resectable breast cancer and positive axillary nodes were entered into two consecutive randomized studies evaluating adjuvant chemotherapy. All patients were subjected to radical or modified radical mastectomy, none received postoperative radiation, and 666 were administered adjuvant CMF (cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil). After a median follow-up in excess of 10 years, no cases of acute nonlymphocytic leukemia were detected, but 21 second solid tumors other than contralateral breast carcinoma were documented. The cumulative frequency was 4% +/- 1.9% after surgery alone, and 4.2% +/- 1.03% following adjuvant CMF. No differences were observed between patients aged up to 50 years (surgery, 3.1% +/- 2.2%; CMF, 3.3% +/- 1.3%) or older than 50 years (surgery, 4.5% +/- 2.6%; CMF, 5.2% +/- 1.8%). During the same period, a total of 29 contralateral breast carcinomas were documented for a cumulative frequency of 3.7% +/- 1.7% after surgery alone and of 5.2% +/- 1.4% following adjuvant CMF, respectively. We conclude that, at present, there is no evidence for an increased risk of second malignancies following adjuvant CMF as given in this series. Our findings would suggest that second tumors documented so far cannot be entirely ascribed to treatment with adjuvant chemotherapy, but they could be due to a chance association.\r"

Twenty-nine patients (group A) were newly diagnosed with local-regional disease only and were candidates for transhiatal esophagectomy (THE). These patients received two courses of chemotherapy at 3-week intervals prior to surgery. Response was assessed by measuring changes in the primary tumor length and depth on serial biphasic contrast esophagrams and comparing this result with tumor measurements obtained from the surgical specimen. Complete (CR) and partial responders (PR) received three additional postoperative cycles. Seven patients had recurrent or metastatic disease (group B) and were treated every 4 weeks until disease progression. Of 34 patients evaluable for response, there was one pathologically confirmed CR and 15 PRs (47%). This consisted of 12 of 27 (44%) group A patients (seven of 11 epidermoid, five of 16 adenocarcinoma) and four of seven (57%) group B patients (two of four epidermoid, two of three adenocarcinoma). Toxicity included leukopenia in one third of treatment courses and thrombocytopenia in 21%. Nausea and vomiting occurred in 60% of patients, diarrhea in 18%, transient nephrotoxicity in 18%, peripheral neuropathy in 12%, and ototoxicity in 3%. Twenty-five group A patients underwent resection. Four chemotherapy nonresponders (NR) and one PR had known disease left at surgery; all others (80%) had gross total removal of their disease. The median survival time (MST) of the 29 group A patients was 14 months, with 21% alive at 36 months. The MST of group A chemotherapy responders was 15 months compared with 9 months for NRs (P = .032). Initial sites of recurrence in 14 patients were local-regional in six, distant only in six, both local-regional and distant in two. This regimen, administered in maximally tolerated doses, was active in epidermoid and adenocarcinoma histologies, recurrent disease and newly diagnosed patients. However, nearly all responses were PRs and the MST of resected patients was similar to a prior series of patients treated with esophagectomy alone. Observations from this pilot trial and those of others have led to a follow-up study, in progress, evaluating intensive preoperative chemotherapy and concurrent radiation therapy (RT).\r"

  ".W": "Two hundred seventy-nine patients with previously untreated nonresectable adenocarcinoma of the lung (ACL) entered a prospective randomized trial, comparing vindesine (VDS) to a combination of lomustine (CCNU), cyclophosphamide (CTX), and methotrexate (MTX), and to a regimen including all four drugs. Response assessment was possible in 218 patients, while 259 were evaluable for survival. Response rates were similar (22%, 23%, and 27%, respectively) as were median durations of response (15 weeks overall) and survival (29 weeks overall). Patients with dose-limiting toxicity had significantly higher response rate and longer survival than patients without toxicity. The major toxicity was peripheral neuropathy with VDS treatment and myelosuppression with the other two regimens. The VDS single-agent activity in ACL was confirmed, but addition of VDS to the three-drug regimen did not increase activity. Future studies of VDS in combination with other active agents, and comparison to a matched control group on supportive care, are indicated.\r"

  ".W": "From 1978 to 1984, 62 patients with advanced seminoma of testicular or extragonadal origin were entered on two consecutive Southeastern Cancer Study Group (SECSG) protocols. All patients had progressive disease and were stratified according to tumor burden. Randomization on SEG 78-GU240 was cisplatin, vinblastine, and bleomycin (PVB), with or without doxorubicin; on SEG 81-GU332, randomization was to PVB or cisplatin, etoposide (VP-16), and bleomycin (PVP16B). Dosages of etoposide, vinblastine, and doxorubicin were decreased by 25% in patients who had received prior radiotherapy. Thirty patients (55%) had received prior chest and/or abdominal radiotherapy. Overall, 41 of 60 evaluable patients (68%) achieved a complete remission (CR) and 37 patients are alive and free of disease. CR was obtained in 13 of 15 patients (87%) with minimal disease, 13 of 16 (81%) with moderate disease, and 15 of 29 (52%) with advanced disease. Patients with no prior radiotherapy or limited-field (chest or abdomen) radiotherapy were more likely to achieve CR than those with prior chest and abdominal radiotherapy (75% v. 42%). Using univariate analysis, the extent of disease is the only significant prognostic factor, whereas both extent of disease and extent of prior radiotherapy are significant in a multivariate analysis. This study confirms the chemosensitivity of metastatic seminoma in a cooperative group setting and defines prognostic factors useful for comparison of other chemotherapeutic trials in seminoma.\r"

  ".U": "87310565\r", 
  ".W": "The development of a new multidrug chemotherapy regimen for primary brain tumors was based upon the cellular heterogeneity within individual tumors, the Goldie-Coldman and Price-Goldie-Hill hypotheses, and known agonistic effects of certain drug combinations and sequences. Eight drugs (vincristine [VCR], hydroxyurea, procarbazine, CCNU, cisplatin, cytosine arabinoside [Ara-C] high-dose methylprednisolone, and either cyclophosphamide or dacarbazine) were administered within 12 hours in an attempt to minimize myelosuppression. Courses were repeated at 2- to 4-week intervals. The regimen was devised to include lipid and water soluble drugs, polar and nonpolar agents, phase-specific and cell-cycle independent agents, and antineoplastics with different mechanisms of action. More than 330 courses of the regimen were administered to 107 children with brain tumors whose tumor had recurred or had been incompletely resected at diagnosis. Tumor response according to protocol-specified criteria and independent review was evaluable in 78% of the patients. After just two cycles of chemotherapy and within a 4- to 6-week interval, 50% had an objective tumor response including 15.5% who had a complete response (CR). Nephrotoxicity and high-frequency hearing losses were noted after three to five courses of therapy in approximately half of the patients. Transfusions with red cells or platelets and use of antibiotics for fever and neutropenia were required in 10% to 25% of patients. The regimen appears satisfactory for preradiation chemotherapy in newly diagnosed patients with residual tumor after surgery, but it must be compared with standard therapeutic approaches in prospective controlled trials before its relative value can be established.\r"

  ".W": "Taxol, a plant product, has significant activity against certain rodent and human xenograft tumors. It promotes microtubule assembly in vitro, in contrast to vinca alkaloids, which inhibit assembly. In this phase I study, taxol was administered as a 24-hour continuous intravenous (IV) infusion in 65 courses to 26 patients. A premedication regimen of dexamethasone, cimetidine, and diphenhydramine was used to prevent the acute hypersensitivity reactions observed in previous studies of taxol. Only one episode of mild stridor occurred in this study. Peripheral neuropathy was the dose-limiting toxicity and was observed in 40% of patients treated at a dose of 250 mg/m2. Significant neutropenia of brief duration was also common. Pharmacokinetic studies by a high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method demonstrated that drug plasma concentrations increased during the 24-hour infusion and then declined rapidly. Peak plasma concentrations correlated with dose, and less than 5% of taxol was excreted in the urine. Most of the drug was bound to serum components. Partial responses of more than 3 months' duration were observed in four of 12 melanoma patients treated. The recommended phase II dose of taxol on this schedule is 250 mg/m2. Priority should be given to the study of taxol in melanoma.\r"

  ".W": "Based on the reports of activity of interferons against metastatic melanomas, we conducted a phase II study of recombinant interferon alfa-2a (Roferon-A, Hoffmann-La Roche, Nutley, NJ) in 66 patients with disseminated melanoma. All patients had excellent Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (0 to 1), and no evidence of brain metastases. Thirty patients had previously received chemotherapy and the remainder were untreated. The first 35 patients were treated on a daily schedule starting with a Roferon-A dose of 3 X 10(6) U/d and escalating to a maximum of 36 X 10(6) U/d over a period of 12 days. Because of excessive toxicity, the second group of 31 patients were treated on a fixed dose of 18 X 10(6) U/d [corrected] three times weekly (TIW). Among the 62 evaluable patients, five achieved an objective response for a response rate of 8% (95% confidence limits, 3% to 18%). Four patients had minor regressions and eight patients had stability of disease. The responses were evenly distributed between the two dose schedules. The major toxicity of interferon consisted of a constitutional syndrome of anorexia, fever, weight loss, and fatigue, which required a dose reduction in 75% of the patients on the daily schedule. Our data revealed a modest level of activity, which was not influenced by prior treatment or by the dose or schedule of interferon. Because of substantial toxicity with the daily schedule, we recommend a dose of 18 X 10(6) U/d [corrected] if interferon is used in the treatment of patients with melanoma.\r"

The antibody was conjugated with DTPA (diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid) and labeled by chelation of 111In. One mg of antibody labeled with 5 mCi of 111In was infused, together with 0 to 40 mg of \"cold\" carrier ZME-018. The blood clearance, urinary excretion, and in vivo localization were determined in 26 patients. Scintigraphic images were obtained at 24 hours and 72 hours in all patients. Mild toxicity occurred in one patient. The half-time clearance of labeled monoclonal murine antibody (MoAb) from the blood increased from 16.1 hours at an antibody dose of 1 mg to 35.9 hours at 40 mg. Males showed faster clearance from the blood than did females or a single castrated male, perhaps due to selective concentration of antibody in the testes. Nonspecific uptake in liver, spleen, bone marrow, and intestine was seen in all patients. The percentage of known metastatic foci detected increased with the total dosage of antibody, from 23% at doses less than or equal to 5 mg, to 65%, 87% and 78% for 10, 20, and 40 mg, respectively. We conclude that at doses of greater than or equal to 10 mg, ZME-018 is a safe and potentially useful agent for the scintigraphic detection of metastatic malignant melanoma.\r"

The incidence of ER in males was 38.7% and 50% in females (not significant). There is an increased incidence of ER+ melanoma in women with extremity lesions (P = .08). The disease-free interval (DFI), survival, and recurrent interval were 42.0 +/- 4.0, 52.3 +/- 4.3, 13.7 +/- 1.7 months in ER- patients; 63.7 +/- 11.6, 76.1 +/- 11.4, 26.5 +/- 7.3 months in ER+ patients (1 to 10 fmol/mg cytosol protein), and 69.8 +/- 17.9, 102.7 +/- 27.9, 29.4 +/- 9.9 months in ER+ patients (greater than 10 fmol/mg cytosol); respectively. When ER+ groups were combined, the DFI in women with ER+ lesions was significantly longer than those with ER- tumors (P less than .05). Cox multivariate analysis demonstrated that ER status is a significant variable of survival along with thickness level and nodal status. These observations suggest that ER may be a marker for a more biologically indolent melanoma.\r"

Five patients (22%) had karyotypic or pathologic evidence of KS. All of the patients with KS had germ cell tumors of the nonseminomatous subtype and were relatively young (median age, 15 years). The literature confirms the findings of a young median age (18 years), nonseminomatous subtype, and mediastinal location of the germ cell neoplasm. We conclude that patients with KS are predisposed to the development of mediastinal nonseminomatous germ cell cancers.\r"

Sixteen patients (41%) were found to have macroscopic disease, six (15%) microscopic tumor, and 17 (44%) no disease at SLL. Five of 22 patients who received further therapy based on positive SLL findings have remained without clinical evidence of disease 17 to 65 months after SLL. Nine of 17 patients with negative SLL, in whom treatment was stopped, recurred 8 to 52 months after SLL, five in extraperitoneal sites only. Five of 11 patients not undergoing SLL recurred 16 to 39 months after diagnosis, four intraperitoneally. There was no significant difference in survival between the second-look and no second-look groups for the period of study. Clinical trials are needed to determine if SLL influences longer-term survival and if continued treatment is indicated in a high-risk subgroup despite negative SLL. The value of SLL is limited by the efficacy of second line therapy. The role of routine SLL outside an investigational setting is questioned.\r"

Group A (WBC greater than 100,000/microL) had significantly more deaths during the first week of therapy than did group C (WBC less than 50,000/microL) (P = .0003). CNS hemorrhage was responsible for a significantly greater number of deaths in group A compared with group C (P less than .004). The group B (WBC 50,000 to 100,000/microL) death rate was intermediate. These findings are consistent with other reports of complications of leukostasis. Rapid intervention with antileukemic therapy and cranial irradiation may have decreased the risk of CNS hemorrhage in group A. If early deaths are removed from analysis, the complete remission rate among patient groups is not significantly different (group A, 59%; group B, 68%; group C, 65%). However, further analyses of patients achieving remission demonstrate significant differences among patient groups based on presenting WBC count. The median complete remission duration of patients in group A (4.2 months) is shorter than that of patients in group B (8.0 months) or C (8.0 months), P = .07. In addition, remission duration has improved with modern aggressive antileukemic therapy in groups B (median before 1977, 7.0 months; after 1977, 22.0 + months) and C (before 1977, 6.0 months; after 1977, 16.0 + months). No such improvement has occurred in group A, in which the median duration of remission was 4.2 months before and after 1977. The same findings are demonstrated in an analysis of survival, with improvement occurring only in groups B (median before 1977, 16.5 months; after 1977, 26.0 + months) and C (before 1977, 13.5 months; after 1977, 24.0 + months). Long-term follow-up (minimum of 4 years) of these patients has allowed an analysis of the effect of presenting WBC count on the overall outcome of adult patients with ANLL.\r"

The median survival of responding and nonresponding (TF criteria) stage II patients was 43.8 and 40.3 months, respectively (P = .29). By SWOG criteria, median survival for responding and nonresponding stage II patients was 48.3 and 39.0 months, respectively (P = .12). In stage III patients, median survival for responders and nonresponders (TF criteria) was 34.0 and 21.7 months, respectively (P = .01), compared with 35.5 and 24.4 months (P = .04) by SWOG criteria. These data would suggest that the TF criteria predicts a survival disadvantage only in very advanced myeloma and that applying the stricter limits for the definition of response of the SWOG does not further aid in selecting a subgroup of myeloma patients with poorer survival.\r"

  ".W": "In a study of 1,010 patients with solitary, unilateral, nonmetastatic breast cancer, the histologic grade, assessed by a multifactorial analysis (Cox model) to study its significance with other prognostic factors, was found to be an important, independent factor. For 612 operable patients, two laboratory characteristics, the number of histologically positive nodes and the histologic grade, were the most valuable predictors. These two factors alone form a predictive index that may be an excellent and simple guide for the clinical decision of subsequent therapy. For 398 patients with inoperable breast cancer (ie, tumor greater than or equal to 7 cm, N2-3, inflammatory, skin fixation, and clinically rapidly growing forms), the histologic grade (performed on drill or cutting needle biopsy) was again a most important (and with inflammatory forms the most important) predictor of prognosis in these patients. Our data support that performing our modified histoprognostic grading of Scarff and Bloom is simple, reproducible, incurs no additional cost, may be carried out in the simplest histology laboratory, and finally, defines an important risk factor in all patients. It should be routine for all breast cancer specimens. Furthermore, studies of adjuvant therapy should stratify patients for this variable.\r"

A good correlation could be found between serum laminin concentration and response to therapy in patients with carcinoma and leukemia. Elevated laminin levels were associated with a progressive course of the tumor condition. Furthermore, a close correlation has been detected between serum concentrations of laminin and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) in patients with carcinoma of the colon. The serum laminin level seems to be a valuable parameter for observation of the course of certain malignancies.\r"

Serum 3F8 levels achieved were proportional to the dose of 3F8 infused. However, serum antimouse antibody levels did not increase with the amount of 3F8 administered. Toxicities included pain, hypertension, urticaria, and complement depletion. All acute side effects were controllable with symptomatic therapy. No long-term side effects were detected in patients observed for more than 14 months. None of the 17 patients received any antitumor therapy postantibody treatment. Antitumor responses occurred in seven of 17 patients. These ranged from complete clinical remissions to mixed responses.

When tested by immunoblotting with monoclonal antibodies directed against P-glycoprotein; tumors from six of 25 sarcoma patients displayed elevated levels of P-glycoprotein. Three of the sarcoma patients exhibiting P-glycoprotein had not previously been exposed to chemotherapy, implying that overexpression of this marker and possible concomitant multidrug resistance may not depend only on selection during prior drug treatments. The P-glycoprotein overexpression in the sarcoma specimens is evidence for the presence of multidrug resistant cells in these tumors; thus, our data suggest that this mode of resistance may have clinical significance in sarcoma patients.\r"

All but two acute periodontal infections developed at low granulocyte levels (less than 1,000/microL). Suspected pathogens were detected in high concentrations in subgingival plaque specimens in 17 episodes of acute periodontal infection; a single pathogen was recovered in ten acute infections, and more than one pathogen was recovered in seven acute infections. Staphylococcus epidermidis, Candida albicans, S aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa predominated, with combinations of these detected in some patients. Concomitant bacteremias developed in two of these patients. The subgingival microflora associated with ten acute periodontal infections was characterized by predominantly indigenous microorganisms, which in nine episodes were in abnormal proportions compared with microbial profiles in noncancer patients with similar degrees of periodontal disease. These data demonstrate that pathogens normally associated with infections in myelosuppressed cancer patients, as well as indigenous oral flora, are associated with acute periodontal infections during granulocytopenia. This finding is important, since this body site has not commonly been recognized as a source for acute infection in these patients.\r"

Baseline levels of compliance (control group) were compared to results obtained after implementation of three intervention packages, whose aim was to increase compliance. The packages included combinations of education, home psychologic support and restructuring, and training in pill taking. A 24-hour profile of the two drugs and their metabolites was first determined. Serum samples were then obtained monthly over 6 months and analyzed for presence of the drugs. Control patients were fully compliant with allopurinol only 16.8% of the time. This rate increased significantly (44% to 48% of the time) for those who received any one of the intervention programs. With respect to prednisone, control patients were compliant 26.8% of the time, with no real improvement after interventions. Finally, self reports overestimated compliance by a factor of two when compared to drug analysis. The results indicated that full compliance with oral medications was remarkably low among our patients who have treatable and in some cases curable hematologic malignancy. However, compliance can be significantly improved by the use of various intervention packages.\r"

Guidelines for early stopping of comparative trials must be carefully defined to avoid this problem. In addition, to avoid inappropriate early closure of studies due to declining accrual (as investigators draw their own conclusions from early unreliable data), it is recommended that access to interim data be limited to a multidisciplinary monitoring committee responsible for (1) performing and reviewing interim analyses, and (2) deciding when early termination should be considered. Accrual and reporting of studies from two clinical trials groups, one with a policy of limited access to interim data and one without, are compared. The group without monitoring committees had a higher incidence of accrual and reporting problems than the group with monitoring committees.\r"

There was marked lateralization of NP-59 uptake to the side of the mass lesion in the seven patients with unilateral masses and prominent asymmetric, (R greater than L) bilateral uptake in the patient with bilateral masses despite the fact that there were no obvious abnormalities of adrenocortical or adrenomedullary function as determined from peripheral blood and 24-hr urinary hormone measurements. Simultaneous bilateral adrenal vein catheterization (AVC) was employed to measure the levels of hormone effluent from the adrenal cortex and medulla and in all instances the cortisol concentrations were greatest from the side of the mass lesion in those patients with unilateral masses and from the larger of the two adrenals in the patient with bilateral adrenal masses. Thus, there was congruence between the anatomic (CT) and functional (NP-59 scintigraphy and AVC) investigations that depicted asymmetry of the adrenal glands which were not associated with abnormalities of overall adrenal function or hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis integrity.\r"

Since large pericardial effusions may also cause such symptoms, the ability to recognize them on routine GBPS is of clinical importance. Characteristic features of the \"halo\" sign surrounding the cardiac blood pool were developed, based on the GBPS of patients with known pericardial effusions. These criteria were then applied blindly to 154 consecutive patients who underwent both GBPS and echocardiography. All five patients with large effusions (approximately greater than 500 ml) were correctly identified by GBPS (sensitivity 100%); for patients with moderate effusions (approximately 150-500 ml), the sensitivity was only 33% (3/9). There were three false positives (specificity 98%). We conclude that large pericardial effusions can be identified with high sensitivity and specificity on routine GBPS. Although echocardiography remains the method of choice for the diagnosis of effusions, inspection for characteristics suggesting their presence on GBPS should be part of routine interpretations.\r"

With an increasing number of injected particles, lung uptake increased and bone marrow uptake decreased. Microfiltration studies showed that the colloid is unaffected by dilution with saline but may be affected after incubation in normal rat plasma. We conclude that the distribution of [99Tc]sulfur colloid in organs varies with the number of injected particles and therefore, is not dependent upon the blood flow to the reticuloendothelial organs alone. The \"critical colloid dose\" may differ among the reticuloendothelial organs and cannot, therefore, be evaluated by blood clearance measurements alone. The considerable influence of the number of injected colloid particles on bone marrow uptake should also be recognized when carrying out dosimetric calculations.\r"

  ".W": "To assess the effect of hypoxia on cellular thallium-201 (201Tl) uptake and washout independent of coronary flow, we studied thallium kinetics during normoxia and hypoxia in cultured chick ventricular cells. Monolayers of contracting ventricular cells grown on coverslips were placed in a chamber and perfused to asymptote with media containing 201Tl. Perfusates were equilibrated with 5% CO2-95% air or 5% CO2-95% nitrogen for normoxia and hypoxia, respectively. Washout thallium kinetics were then observed during perfusion with unlabeled media. Twenty paired experiments were performed, randomly alternating the sequence of normoxia and hypoxia. Pharmacokinetics for thallium were determined by computer using standard formulae. Thallium uptake and washout were best described by assuming that intracellular thallium was contained within a single compartment. Cellular thallium uptake, as well as transfer rate constants for thallium uptake and for thallium washout during normoxia and hypoxia, were compared using paired t-tests. During normoxia and hypoxia, respectively, thallium uptake was 22 +/- 7% and 19 +/- 7% of asymptote (p less than 0.01); the compartmental rate constant for uptake by the cell was 0.16 +/- 0.07 min-1 and 0.15 +/- 0.06 min-1 (N.S.); and the transfer rate constant for washout from the cell was 0.26 +/- 0.06 min-1 and 0.23 +/- 0.05 min-1 (p less than 0.01). We conclude that there was a small (14%) decrease in thallium uptake during hypoxia. The rate of thallium uptake and washout was slightly less during hypoxia, although only the rate of washout was significantly less. These data show that cellular accumulation of thallium and the rate of washout of thallium were minimally decreased by hypoxia independent of blood flow.\r"

  ".W": "Yttrium-90 is often considered to possess many favorable properties for radioimmunotherapy applications. Among these is its availability as a radionuclide generator product by decay of its parent, 90Sr. Nevertheless, most present and planned clinical trials with 90Y-labeled antibodies employ radioactivity obtained not from an in-house generator, but from commercial sources. To prepare for clinical trials at this institution with 90Y labeled to diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid- (DTPA) coupled antibodies, we have adapted previously published procedures and have developed others to prepare antibodies labeled with generator produced 90Y for human use. Up to 25 mCi of 90Sr have been loaded without evidence of radiolytic degradation to the Dowex 50 cation exchange resin which serves as the solid support for the generator. Using 0.003M ethylenetriaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) as eluant, elution efficiency averages 98% and 90Sr breakthrough averages 0.002%. The EDTA is destroyed remotely and the activity is dissolved in 0.5M acetate, pH 6. In this form, 90Y may be used to label DTPA-coupled proteins at specific activities of 1-3 mCi/mg (an order of magnitude improvement in specific activity results from the purification of 90Y by cation exchange prior to labeling). When properly labeled, size exclusion HPLC shows 90% or greater radiochemical purity and recovery without postlabeling purification. We conclude that these techniques provide a 90Y-labeled protein preparation which is safe for administration to patients.\r"

Labeling efficiency in leukocyte rich plasma (LRP) averaged 44%, of which greater than 90% was specifically bound to leukocytes. MP-gradient analysis also revealed that leukocyte labeling did not occur with stannous chloride colloid, nor when citrate was present during rotation with [Tc]SFC. When citrate was added after labeling to \"solubilize\" unbound [Tc]SFC, radiocolloid was removed from the leukocytes, indicating that the mechanism of [Tc]SFC labeling is adherence rather than phagocytosis. Technetium-labeled neutrophils exhibited normal in vitro chemotaxis and no lung uptake in vivo. Technetium-labeled mononuclear leukocytes, on the other hand, exhibited prolonged lung transit in vivo. Neither [Tc]SFC cell preparation showed signs of in vivo reoxidation to pertechnetate.\r"

The measurements were made in ionization chambers from two manufacturers, Capintec and Radcal. The main objective was to examine the use of radionuclides in NBS ampoules and Du Pont Vial E containers as suitable reference sources for ionization chambers used to assay radiopharmaceuticals in elution vials and syringes. The exercise illustrated that regardless of the brand of dose calibrator used, a calibration factor for each geometry should be determined to ensure the highest accuracy. The data show that as much as a 9% difference from the correct activity can be observed for these radionuclides, even when the ampoule reference source gives the appropriate reading.\r"

Furthermore, a mechanism or structure is needed in which the guidelines can be periodically reviewed and updated. In making dietary recommendations, genetic variability, age, sex and body size need to be considered. Survival, extension of life span, relief of selected symptoms and biochemical improvements of risk factors are some of the criteria to be used in assessing the role of diet in health and disease. The most important questions that remain unresolved in the nutritional sciences concern the relation of diet to the development of chronic disease. The science of nutritional epidemiology needs to be strengthened and etiologic research in epidemiology ought to be performed and evaluated with the same standards used in other branches of science. Therefore, there is a need to establish guidelines for the validity of methods in assessing dietary intake and for a minimum acceptable correlation for the reproducibility and repeatability of dietary intake data. Research on the role of genetic variation and nutrition, the metabolic effects of omega-3 fatty acids and their relationship to omega-6 fatty acids, the energy expenditure after weight reduction and improving the scientific base of nutritional epidemiology will enhance the scientific basis of nutrition and our understanding of the role of diet in health and disease.\r"

Soybean meal was the only source of protein. Diets contained magnesium ferrite as marker. Individual amino acid absorption was determined by analysis in the lower ileum or excreta as apparent absorption; true absorption was calculated from the slope of the regression curves, obtained by plotting dietary amino acid levels versus amino acids in the lower ileum or excreta. In the excreta, the true values were higher than the apparent ones determined with the three levels of dietary protein (diets 1-3, respectively, were 34.8, 25.7 and 18.1 g N/kg). This difference is the result of elimination of the endogenous fraction as represented by the intercept of the regression line obtained by the calculation method. In the lower ileum both absorption values, the apparent (diets 1-3) and the true (calculated), are almost similar to the true (calculated) ones in the excreta. The method based on regression analysis allows calculation of true absorption from excreta data, without the need to kill the chicks. This has been validated with soybean meal as the source of protein. The determined endogenous amino acids levels in chicks fed an N-free diet were higher than those calculated from the intercept (the endogenous amino acids related to the feed protein tested), both in the excreta and in the lower ileum.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To investigate further the role of dietary manipulation involving gamma-linolenic acid (18:3n-6) and eicosapentaenoic acid (20:5n-3) on hyperproliferative cellular components, the effects of orally administered primrose oil (containing 18:3n-6) and menhaden fish oil (containing 20:5n-3) were tested in a cutaneous system using the essential fatty acid (EFA)-deficient guinea pig fed a hydrogenated coconut oil (HCO) diet. The effects of the dietary crossover regimen were determined on epidermal 1) morphology, 2) DNA synthesis, 3) delta 6- and delta 5-desaturase activities and 4) fatty acid composition of skin and liver lipids. Our results demonstrated that dietary fish oil lacked the capacity to reverse the signs of epidermal hyperproliferation, acanthosis and hypergranulosis that are characteristic of EFA deficiency. In contrast, primrose oil feeding reversed the histological and biochemical signs of hyperproliferation. These results suggest that dietary fish oil, which contains largely the 20:5n-3 fatty acid, lacks EFA-functional properties in the skin. In addition, substitution of HCO with primrose or fish oil after 6 wk revealed incorporation of 18:3n-6 and 20:5n-3 into epidermal lipids, respectively. The significance of these altered epidermal fatty acid profiles is discussed.\r"

The vitamin A concentrations in placenta and fetuses of dams fed 10 REq/d were significantly different from those of dams fed no vitamin A. This difference was not seen in any of the six other maternal tissues assayed. We suggest that the fetus is at greater risk than other maternal tissues during severe vitamin A deprivation. For vitamin A-deprived dams, linear regression analysis indicated strong relationships between the vitamin A concentrations of nonhepatic tissues and their liver vitamin A concentrations. In contrast, among vitamin A-replete dams, these relationships were not statistically significant. An estimate was made of the minimal vitamin A status corresponding to tissue repletion by solving linear equations described by the data of the depleted dams for the vitamin A concentrations found in tissues of replete dams. This analysis revealed that a maternal vitamin A status of 3 micrograms/g liver was needed to provide the level of vitamin A found in the placenta, whole fetus and maternal tissues of vitamin A-replete dams.\r"

Significant differences in erythrocyte transketolase activity between fish fed the thiamin-deficient and control diets were measured after 24 wk of feeding. No significant difference in liver transketolase activity was found between trout fed diets with or without thiamin supplementation. Thiamin pyrophosphate levels were significantly lower in erythrocytes and liver of fish fed the thiamin-deficient diet after 16 wk of feeding.

Retention corrected to zero time and turnover rate were determined by whole-body counting. Percent zinc retention was inversely proportional to the natural logarithm of the meal zinc, between 0.09 and 26 mumol. In comparison to lower doses, higher doses resulted in lower percent retention but greater amounts of zinc retained. Although the latter relationship was slightly curvilinear, there was no indication of a limited capacity for zinc retention with high doses. However, doses above 4 mumol resulted in higher turnover rates in rats accustomed to lower zinc intakes. Percent retention and the reciprocal of the turnover rate were proportional to the reciprocal of the dietary zinc concentration. The greatest differences in retention and turnover occurred between 12 and 26 mg Zn/kg diet. The zinc dose in a meal and the usual dietary zinc separately influenced percent zinc retention. These factors also interacted, such that greater dose effects were observed at lower zinc intakes and greater dietary zinc effects were observed at lower doses.\r"

In three studies, rats were fed diets containing adequate levels of iron (33-35 micrograms Fe/g diet) and zinc (15-25 micrograms Zn/g diet) and diets with excessive levels of zinc (2441-2470 micrograms Zn/g diet) or iron (1408-3042 micrograms Fe/g diet). Consumption of excess iron for several weeks or in one test meal did not alter tissue levels of zinc or apparent absorption of 65Zn. In contrast rats fed excess zinc throughout the three studies had depressed hematocrits and serum copper levels, apparently absorbed 59Fe less efficiently and retained less 59Fe in livers and tibias than control animals. Nutritional status with regard to iron or zinc, not just the intakes of iron and zinc, also influenced the interactions between zinc and iron. Rats fed excess iron for several weeks retained less 65Zn from a test meal in their tibias than rats fed excessive iron in only the test meal. Although chronic ingestion of excess zinc depressed apparent absorption of 59Fe from a test meal, the ingestion of one test meal with excess zinc did not. Investigators studying nutrient interactions should not rely solely on studies in which unadjusted humans or animals are given a single dose of test substances because acute responses do not reflect all the changes induced by chronic feeding.\r"

The experimental design was a 2 X 2 factorial study with the source of dietary carbohydrate (cornstarch or fructose) and the level of dietary zinc (0.7 or 31 micrograms Zn/g) as the variables. The experiment utilized 76 weanling male Sprague-Dawley rats randomly assigned to one of four dietary groups. Animals fed a zinc-deficient fructose diet were allowed to consume the diet ad libitum; all other groups were pair-fed to that group to ensure equivalent nutrient and energy intake. The results of the 29-d study showed that the most sensitive indices of zinc status measured, including growth, survival and the zinc concentrations of plasma, femur and testes, were not affected by the type of dietary carbohydrate. This lack of an effect of fructose on the zinc status of the experimental animals indicates that the ability of fructose to exacerbate copper and selenium deficiencies is specific, rather than representing a generalized effect of this simple sugar on the requirements and/or metabolism of all essential trace elements.\r"

Hepatic copper concentration of the copper-deficient groups was 50% of that of the copper-supplemented groups. Body and relative pancreatic weights were lower in the F-Cu dietary group than in any other group. Relative liver weight was significantly higher in the fructose dietary groups than in the starch dietary groups. There were significant carbohydrate (CHO) X week and Cu X week interactions for luminal amylase activities and the CHO X Cu X week interaction was significant for luminal lipase and trypsin activities. The lowest enzyme activities were observed in the F-Cu-fed rats. The CHO X week interaction was significant for chymotrypsin with the lowest enzyme activities in the fructose-fed rats. It appears that high dietary fructose and low dietary copper interact to produce greatly reduced pancreatic enzyme activities in small intestinal washings. We speculate that subsequent digestive and absorptive abnormalities during a period of rapid growth may account for the severe morbidity and mortality in copper-deficient, fructose-fed rats.\r"

The intraduodenal dose contained 0.05 microCi 75Se, 0.01 mM Se, 150 mM NaCl and 0-1.0 mM Hg. In the presence of 1 mM inorganic Hg in the intraduodenal dose, the absorption of the inorganic 75Se compounds was only about 65% of that in the control group, whereas only a slight inhibitory effect on [75Se]Met absorption was observed. Methylmercury had no effect on [75Se]selenite absorption. Precipitation of the 75Se-selenite in the intestinal lumen partly explained the direct interaction between inorganic Hg and Se compounds. Absorption of [75Se]Met and [75Se]selenite was also determined in chicks fed after hatching a purified diet supplemented with varying amounts of Hg (0-500 mg/kg) and Se (0-4 mg/kg). Dietary Hg significantly reduced the transfer of [75Se]selenite to body by enhancing the accumulation of the isotope in the intestinal tissue. Dietary Hg did not affect the absorption of [75Se]Met, but altered the whole-body distribution of this Se compound. Because interaction between Se and Hg was observed mainly between the inorganic compounds and with use of a manyfold excess of Hg over Se, the data suggest that intestinal interaction between these metals is not of great nutritional importance.\r"

We also studied the influence of nutrition on cellular composition at birth and at 2 wk. Fifty-four pups (27 IUGR and 27 controls) were enrolled into normal or undernutrition groups. Postnatal undernutrition resulted in significantly lower growth in both control and IUGR rat pups than in normally fed pups. In the control group, postnatal undernutrition resulted in a lower liver weight but not a lower brain weight. Underfeeding of the IUGR group produced a greater number of cells of the brain and liver, but with smaller cell size than in normally fed IUGR rats. We conclude that compensatory catch-up growth in the mild-IUGR rat occurs if the postnatal nutrition is adequate. When postnatal nutrition is restricted, the non-IUGR rats became malnourished at 2 wk of age and the mild-IUGR rats did not demonstrate the catch-up growth phenomenon as was seen in those with adequate nutrition. In the severe-IUGR rat, undernutrition further compromised growth rate, so that at 2 wk of age their weights were the lowest of all the groups studied.\r"

  ".W": "Cardiac output, organ blood flow and organ weights were examined in rats assigned at d 0 of lactation to a control (C) group fed ad libitum or an acutely restricted (AR) group fed 50% of the intake of C dams. Dams in each group were assigned to subgroups for measurement of milk yield or cardiac output, blood flow and organ weights. At d 14 of lactation, cardiac output and blood flow were measured with radiolabeled microspheres and milk yield with the tritiated water method. In AR dams cardiac output was 55% of that of C dams, but cardiac output relative to body weight did not differ between groups. Mammary gland blood flow and weight were reduced in AR dams. The weight of the kidneys, gastrointestinal tract and liver of the AR dams was less than that of C dams; however, relative blood flow to these organs did not differ between groups. Milk yield was reduced by 58% in AR dams compared to C dams. We conclude that dietary restriction during lactation negatively affects absolute cardiac output, blood flow to the mammary glands and milk yield, and that the reduced milk yield is associated with the decrease in mammary gland weight and blood flow.\r"

Rats were fed diets containing 6 (severe anemia), 11 (moderate anemia) or 250 (iron sufficient) mg iron/kg diet throughout gestation and lactation. On d 2 of lactation, litters were adjusted to contain six pups. On d 12 of lactation, two pups from each litter were immunized with sheep red blood cells (SRBC) and on d 17, tissues were removed for the determination of protein synthesis and evaluation of RNA and DNA contents. In the moderately iron-deficient pups, protein synthesis was lower (30%) in spleen than that in iron-sufficient pups. Protein synthesis in liver and thymus was not changed by moderate iron deficiency. In spleen, liver and thymus, protein synthesis in severely iron-deficient pups was less than half that of iron-sufficient pups. Protein synthesis in the spleen of the moderately iron-deficient group was higher after immunization with SRBC than in iron-sufficient controls, whereas the severely iron-deficient pups failed to respond. Impaired protein synthesis may be the mechanism responsible for compromised ability to produce antibody in iron deficiency.\r"

There were 177 (24%) patients with MOSF and 83 (11%) nonsurvivors of MOSF. The mortality rates for two, three, or four or more failed organ systems were 26%, 62%, and 88%, respectively (P less than 0.001). Eighty-four (47%) patients with MOSF had associated sepsis. Sepsis (both bacteremia and clinical sepsis syndrome) did not significantly increase mortality rates in the groups with organ system failure. Mortality rates for patients with sepsis before or within 24 hours of development of MOSF (early sepsis) did not differ from mortality rates for those patients with onset of sepsis more than 24 hours after developing MOSF (late sepsis, 53% vs 33%, P = NS). We conclude that underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms of MOSF other than sepsis are as important as sepsis in critically ill pediatric patients.\r"

The distribution of intelligence and general developmental scores was bimodal; one group had severe deficits (mean IQ 28.8), the other had relatively less severe intellectual sequelae (mean IQ 91.6). Correlation analysis (Pearson r) showed that three variables--microcephaly, neurologic abnormalities, and chorioretinitis--when apparent during the first year of life, were all significantly associated with low intelligence. No correlation was found between IQ and severity of neonatal reticuloendothelial disease or hearing loss. Multiple regression analysis showed that age at testing, chorioretinitis, and neurologic sequelae accounted for 63% of the IQ variance in our sample. We conclude that children with symptomatic congenital cytomegalovirus infection have a greater range of intellectual outcomes than has been previously reported, and that certain early clinical manifestations may be useful in anticipating special needs.\r"

These obstructive lesions, caused by local granuloma formation, have been reported in 18 other patients with chronic granulomatous disease, none of whom received steroids. Our first patient, a 3-year-old boy, had emesis and weight loss associated with antral narrowing and delayed gastric emptying at age 2 years. Antibiotic therapy was ineffective, but intravenous and oral corticosteroid therapy for 10 weeks resulted in clinical cure. One year later, dysuria associated with bladder neck obstruction was also treated successfully with corticosteroids. The second child, a 10-year-old boy, had dysphagia caused by distal esophageal stenosis. Corticosteroid therapy (with concomitant antibiotics) on two occasions reversed this obstruction. Granulomatous cystitis with ureteropelvic obstruction then developed, which also responded to treatment with corticosteroids and antibiotics. Despite the risk of increased susceptibility to infection, corticosteroid therapy is justified in preventing life-threatening obstruction of vital organs.\r"

A maximal PD value (PDmax) and an average PD value (PDmean) were determined for each study of the nasal respiratory epithelium. The voltage response to superfusion of 10(-4) mol/L amiloride onto nasal mucosa was noted. The PD of the palm, wrist, and between two fingertips was also measured. Nasal PDmax and PDmean of the CF group were more negative than the control (P less than 0.01) and chronic disease groups (P less than 0.01). After application of amiloride, the voltage change in nasal PD was greater in the CF group than in the non-CF control groups (P less than 0.01). There were no clinically significant differences in the PD of the palm, wrist, or fingertips of the three groups. These data confirm the observation that patients with CF have hyperpolarized nasal epithelia that demonstrate greater change in response to amiloride than that in non-CF controls. These results indicate a possible role for the use of in vivo nasal PD measurements as a diagnostic test for cystic fibrosis.\r"

The implications of the age of onset on the clinical presentation and course of MS are unclear. This population-based retrospective study presents data from a group of 125 patients with onset of MS before age 16 years and can thus be considered as representative of MS occurring in childhood. It demonstrates that childhood MS is more frequent in girls, that it very often has a relapsing-remitting course, that initial bouts usually involve afferent structures of the central nervous system, that recovery from these is often complete, and that the pace of the disease is slow.\r"

  ".W": "Vocal cord paralysis with inspiratory stridor during infancy is a well-recognized complication of the Arnold-Chiari malformation associated with myelomeningocele. Management of these symptoms, however, remains controversial. The outcome in 19 infants with symptoms managed by us during 1978-1984 was therefore reviewed. Ten infants had stridor alone at presentation (clinical grade 1), four infants also had apnea (grade 2), and five infants also had associated cyanotic spells and dysphagia (grade 3). Of 14 ventricular shunt revisions performed, seven were associated with resolution: in five of eight infants with grade 1, two of four with grade 2, and none of two with grade 3 symptoms. Of the 10 posterior fossa decompressions performed, two were associated with clinical resolution: in one of four infants with grade 1, one of two with grade 2, and none of four with grade 3 symptoms. Mortality over 6 months following onset of symptoms was absent among infants with grade 1, one with grade 2, and three with grade 3 symptoms. We propose that differences in outcome among the three groups of infants reflect differences in pathologic processes within the brain stem. We speculate that infants with grade 2 or 3 symptoms have more extensive brain stem damage, such as hemorrhage, infarction, and necrosis. Use of our classification system may be helpful in further studies on intervention modalities in these infants.\r"

  ".W": "Thoracic impedance apnea monitors may fail to detect obstructive apnea, may falsely alarm when the infant is breathing, and may confuse cardiac artifact with respiratory impedance. Therefore, we compared the performance of a respiratory inductive plethysmograph and a thoracic impedance monitor with a reliable measure of airflow, either nasal CO2 or pneumotachograph, during 29 studies in 28 patients referred for sleep laboratory evaluation. Sleep time averaged 72 +/- 37 (SD) minutes. The inductance plethysmography and the impedance monitor detected 99.6% +/- 0.6% and 98.3% +/- 3.0% of breaths, respectively. However, in two studies, the impedance monitor detected many extra breaths, once because of cardiac-induced impedance changes and once because of partial airway obstruction-induced impedance changes. In 11 studies, cardiac artifact was sometimes misinterpreted as a breath by the impedance monitor. The impedance monitor, but not the inductance plethysmograph, missed breaths following sighs in 16 of 29 studies. Both monitors detected all 60 episodes of central apnea. The inductance plethysmography detected 35 of 38 episodes of obstructive apnea, but the impedance monitor identified only two such events. Apnea was detected falsely four times by the inductance plethysmograph and 14 times by the impedance monitor. These results suggests that a respiratory inductive plethysmograph would have significant advantages over impedance monitoring, including the ability to detect obstructive apnea, and freedom from cardiac artifact.\r"

Fifty-eight percent of PVLs were infiltrated by 36.30 +/- 33.53 hours (mean +/- SD; median 40 hours, range 10 to 187 hours). No difference between infiltrated and noninfiltrated PVLs was noted with regard to patient age, gender, weight, cannula type, cannula gauge, cannula site, infusion device, potassium or dextrose concentration, medications, or rate of solution administration (P greater than 0.05). Infiltration was observed more often in black than in white infants (P = 0.03) and in patients with lower controller solution head heights (P = 0.01). The time to infiltration was decreased significantly for steel verus Teflon cannulas (P = 0.02), for administration of intravenous medication versus no administration of medication (P = 0.03), for peripheral parenteral nutrition solutions compared with 5% or 10% dextrose solutions (P = 0.014), and with increasing cannula gauge (P = 0.05). The time to infiltration did not differ significantly for gravity-controlled versus positive-pressure infusion device delivery (P = 0.51) or for potassium concentrations less than or equal to 20 mEq/L versus greater than 20 mEq/L (P = 0.13). Infusion device occlusion alarms were associated with only 19% of infiltrations. No sloughing of skin or necrosis of tissue occurred related to infiltration.\r"

  ".W": "We carried out a prospective study in 66 infants with congenital diaphragmatic hernia within the first 6 hours of life to determine whether outcome is related to the degree of underlying pulmonary hypoplasia, as predicted by preoperative PaCO2, when correlated with an index of ventilation (VI = mean airway pressure X respiratory rate) and confirmed by postmortem analysis of the lung. Those infants with PaCO2 greater than 40 mm Hg before surgery had a 77% mortality; when PaCO2 reduction could be achieved only with VI greater than 1000, the mortality was still greater than 50%. After repair, however, the ability to hyperventilate to PaCO2 less than 40 mm Hg proved to be an important determinant of survival; only one of 31 infants in this group died, whereas only two of 27 infants with PaCO2 greater than 40 mm Hg survived. In 16 infants with PaCO2 greater than 40 mm Hg despite hyperventilation, high-frequency oscillatory ventilation was started. This resulted in a rapid fall in PaCO2, but 14 of the 16 infants had only temporary improvement in oxygenation, and died. In five of the infants who died, alveolar number was assessed by postmortem morphometric analysis; there was a severe reduction to less than 10% of published normal neonatal values. Pulmonary vascular changes of increased muscularization were less remarkable than those observed in infants with persistent pulmonary hypertension. Our findings suggest that the degree of pulmonary hypoplasia (which would not be influenced by surgical repair), rather than the pulmonary vascular abnormality, mainly determines survival. Consideration could therefore be given to an initial nonsurgical approach to congenital diaphragmatic hernia, with the expectation that pulmonary function might improve and pulmonary vascular resistance decrease.\r"

  ".U": "87310957\r", 
  ".W": "To determine whether surgical repair of congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CHD) results in improvement in respiratory mechanics, we measured respiratory system compliance in nine patients (five survivors and four nonsurvivors) before and after operation. In all nine infants, CHD was diagnosed within 6 hours of life, and surgical repair was through an abdominal approach after a period of stabilization. Measurements were made noninvasively, using the passive expiratory flow-volume technique. In only one of the nine infants did compliance immediately improve after surgical repair, and in another it showed no change. Both of these infants survived, with an uneventful postoperative course. In the remaining seven infants, however, postoperative compliance immediately decreased to 10% to 77% from the preoperative value. The four infants with more than 50% decrease in compliance died with increasing hypoxemia and acidosis. These results suggest that respiratory mechanics in CHD, far from improving, frequently deteriorate as a result of repair of the hernia. The role of urgent surgery in this malformation should be reevaluated.\r"

A significant decrease in platelet counts was observed during mechanical ventilation: (mean +/- SD) reduction of 39% +/- 5%, 42% +/- 5.6%, and 11.9% +/- 5.4% in the three groups, respectively, independent of other causes. In the group with congenital diaphragmatic hernia, there was a significant correlation between mean airway pressure and the reduction in platelet counts. In a subsequent series of experiments, platelet counts were recorded before and during ventilation in rabbits. A significant mean decrease of 37.3% in platelet counts was associated with ventilation with either air or pure oxygen. Results of these studies indicate that mechanical ventilation itself may cause a major decrease in platelet count in newborn infants.\r"

  ".W": "The bone mineral status of healthy preterm infants fed maternal milk was compared with that of similar infants fed maternal milk with mineral supplementation. Fifty infants with birth weight less than 1600 g were fed human milk for 1 week until reaching an intake of 120 kcal/kg/d. Thereafter, infants were assigned randomly to one of three diets: (1) continued unsupplemented human milk, providing an intake of 40 to 50 mg/kg/d calcium and 23 to 30 mg/kg/d phosphorus; (2) human milk mixed with a high mineral containing formula, providing total intakes of 130 mg/kg/d calcium and 68 mg/kg/d phosphorus; or (3) human milk alone for 1 additional week, followed by human milk mixed with a powdered fortifier, providing total intakes of 160 mg/kg/d calcium and 90 mg/kg/d phosphorus. Infants fed human milk with formula supplementation, but not those fed human milk with fortifier, had significantly higher serum phosphorus concentrations and significantly lower serum alkaline phosphatase concentrations than did those fed unsupplemented human milk (P less than 0.01). Bone mineral content of the humerus, determined by photon absorptiometry, however, was similar in all three groups; values averaged 0.104 g/cm at the beginning of the study, and remained unchanged irrespective of mineral supplementation. Shortly before hospital discharge, study diets were discontinued and infants were fed standard proprietary formula or were nursed by their mothers. At 44 weeks postconceptional age (7 to 10 weeks after change in diet), infants were reexamined. Serum phosphorus concentrations increased, serum alkaline phosphatase concentrations decreased, and bone mineral content more than doubled to values comparable with those in term infants. Results at follow-up were comparable for all three initial diet groups and for infants who were formula-fed or breast-fed after hospital discharge. The lack of any significant effect of early maternal milk supplementation on bone mineralization by 44 weeks postconceptional age suggests that these methods of supplementation of maternal milk may not be warranted for healthy preterm infants.\r"

Age-matched controls were injected with 0.9% saline solution. The activities of xanthine oxidase, superoxide dismutase, and catalase were measured in small intestines from fetal (20 and 21 days gestation), newborn, and older (aged 16, 21, and 106 days) rats. Xanthine oxidase rose with maturation; the major increase occurred on postnatal day 21. Catalase and superoxide dismutase rose minimally during intrauterine life. On day 16 postpartum, catalase and superoxide dismutase values were 160% and 60%, respectively, higher than at birth. Glucocorticoid administration stimulated maltase and sucrase activities, but had no effect on the antioxidant enzymes or xanthine oxidase.\r"

We measured norepinephrine in plasma and platelets from normal, nonpregnant women and from normal and preeclamptic pregnant women with a radioenzymatic assay. Plasma and platelet norepinephrine was not markedly different in normal, pregnant women during the third trimester, intrapartum or postpartum when compared with those levels in nonpregnant women. Platelet norepinephrine was significantly elevated in women with mild preeclampsia, but plasma norepinephrine was not. A linear relationship existed between platelet count and platelet norepinephrine concentrations in women with preeclampsia. These findings are compatible with the hypothesis of increased sympathoadrenal activity in women with mild preeclampsia and normal platelet counts. The lower platelet norepinephrine in thrombocytopenic patients suggests that platelet activation and degranulation have occurred and indicate that platelet catecholamine concentration does not provide a stable index of sympathoadrenal activity when platelets are being consumed.\r"

By forming a linear model of the fetal ECG, it is possible to measure time constants and characteristics on a real-time basis. The technique provides a powerful tool for the detection of subtle changes in the ECG, but the interpretation of these changes is critical to the application of the technique in fetal monitoring. Shifts in the ST segment and changes in T wave configuration are late indicators of fetal asphyxia, whereas the earliest indicators of stress are shortening of the PR interval and inversion of the normal positive relationship between the PR and RR intervals. The method appears to substantially enhance our ability to predict fetal stress at an early stage.\r"

We have suggested that progesterone may play a role in preventing the kaliuresis that normally occurs when aldosterone levels are elevated and substantial quantities of sodium are presented to distal nephron sites. In addition, we hypothesize that subtle K secretory problems, such as those known to occur in sickle cell disease, may be aggravated during gestation, probably due to elevated circulating levels of progesterone.\r"

Most of this increase in the incidence of breast-feeding is found in the higher socio-economic groups, pointing to a need to collect data on milk yield in such women. The levels of milk yield in women with infants between 1 and 6 months ranged from a mean of 1.13-1.24 kg/24 h. This is a higher level of milk production than the generally accepted range of 0.7-0.9 kg/24 h. However, this difference is due, in part, to a failure of previous test weighing methods to correct for the evaporative water losses in either the infant or mother. There was no relationship between the introduction of solids and a return to fertility in 38 women breast-feeding on demand. The return of the ovulatory menstrual cycle in women resulted in two acute changes in milk composition. These changes were characterized by a rise in the concentration of sodium and chloride and a fall in the concentration of potassium, glucose and lactose in breast milk. The first change occurred five to six days before ovulation, and the second occurred six to seven days after it. Following the cessation of breast-feeding, the concentration of lactose in breast milk gradually declined, but the concentrations of anti-bacterial proteins (IgA and lactoferrin) gradually increased to high levels over a period of 30-40 days.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The level of plasminogen activator in RA was found to be higher than in OA. The plaminogen activators of both RA and OA revealed 3 different molecular weights: 90,000, 55,000 and 33,000. RA demonstrated the 3 plasminogen activators in broadly comparable ratios, but OA had the 55,000 form dominantly. The 90,000 plasminogen activator was a tissue-type plasminogen activator, while the 55,000 and 33,000 plasminogen activators were of the urokinase-type. beta-Methasone suppressed the tissue-type plasminogen activator, and urinary trypsin inhibitor suppressed the urokinase-type plasminogen activators. When urinary trypsin inhibitor was injected clinically into the joint space of a patient with RA, the urokinase-type plasminogen inhibitor was suppressed as in the in vitro study, and the clinical signs and symptoms were markedly improved. Open trials of intraarticular injections of urinary trypsin inhibitor demonstrated improvement of the clinical signs and symptoms.\r"

  ".W": "Nine patients with rheumatoid arthritis (10 knees) with chronic knee synovitis unresponsive to medical therapy were entered into a prospective study of arthroscopic total synovectomy of the knee. Histopathological examination of the synovium revealed a proliferative synovitis in all knees. Patients were ambulatory and exhibited 90 degrees of knee flexion on the day after surgery and were discharged at 24 to 48 h postoperation. Mean joint tenderness and swelling improved from the preoperative level and was maintained for the initial 12 months of the study. Knee range of movement was improved in all patients (mean 21 degrees). Improvement of joint function in daily activities was also demonstrated, but patients with Grade IV articular cartilage damage failed to show significant improvement. Nine knees were followed for at least 24 months and 4 required repeat surgery. Arthroscopic synovectomy is comparable to synovectomy by arthrotomy in short term reduction of pain and swelling. The chief benefit of arthroscopic synovectomy is a reduction in morbidity, hospital stay and postoperative rehabilitation.\r"

The cellular profile of metal variation was conspiciously altered in patients (n = 29) with ankylosing spondylitis compared with the profile found in age and sex matched healthy controls. Ca was accumulated in erythrocytes and granulocytes but decreased in platelets (p less than 0.001). Mg was increased in granulocytes but appeared in reduced concentrations in platelets and erythrocytes (p less than 0.001). The cellular amounts of Mn was increased in granulocytes (p less than 0.001), normal in platelets (p greater than 0.05) and subnormal in erythrocytes (p less than 0.001). Zn was reduced in all 3 cell types (p less than 0.001). Fe accumulation was evident in granulocytes and platelets (p less than 0.001). Sr was only measurable in granulocytes from patients. Cu was below the detection limit in the different cell types isolated from patients, but appeared in measurable amounts in erythrocytes and platelets from controls. The granulocyte amounts of Ca, Mg, Mn and Sr were strongly related to the acute phase reaction. Negative correlations were found between erythrocyte Mg and Zn and the inflammatory activity. The patients had increased serum levels of Cu, normal levels of Ca, Mg and Sr and decreased levels of Zn, Fe and Mn. No relationship was found between the serum concentrations of these elements and their respective cellular stores, except for a weak negative correlation between granulocyte and serum Fe.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

But when age only was considered, trabecular bone density in the distal radius was found to be 7% higher than predicted (p less than 0.05).

The success of a particular animal model rests in the ability to parallel, on a temporal basis, the biological changes which characterize osteoarthritic development as seen in the human population. Macroscopic, microscopic, and biochemical evaluations then permit the detailing of the steps which lead to cartilage erosion. In this manner, link proteins have been found to be deficient in osteoarthritic guinea pig cartilage.\r"

In order to test the hypothesis that osteoarthritic cartilage contains an increased amount of proteoglycans characteristic of immature cartilage, experimental osteoarthritis (OA) was induced in 11 dogs by transection of the anterior cruciate ligament.

While the magnitude of the effects of NSAID on proteoglycan metabolism in cartilage appeared to be inversely related to the proteoglycan content of the matrix, it is possible that some drugs are selectively bound to cartilage matrix components, which could affect their action on the chondrocyte.

In contrast, the changes due to degradation occur throughout life, but predominate during aging of the adult.

Described here are experiments with immature and mature chondrocytes in culture which show that aging of chondrocytes in vivo is accompanied by a marked fall in the capacity of these cells to synthesize link protein and to assemble a proteoglycan-rich matrix.

In the present work, the molecular heterogeneity of articular cartilage collagen was investigated in more detail. Two additional genetic types of collagen were found in the mature bovine tissue, types V and VI, each accounting for about 1-2% of the tissue dry weight. Type V, a close relative of type XI, apparently had accumulated after birth. Type VI is a short-helix, microfibrillar collagen of wide tissue distribution but unknown function. In understanding the physical changes in the collagen network of cartilage that are believed to herald the onset of cartilage degeneration in osteoarthrosis, all five of these collagen types deserve attention.\r"

This activity is expressed on fibroblastic cells from several types of connective tissues, including synovium, and on cartilage tissue, but not on cells of unrelated origin. For synovial fibroblastic cells, matrigenin activity stimulated both hyaluronic acid and proteoglycan synthesis. The major proteoglycan whose synthesis was stimulated, contained primarily chondroitin-6-sulfate chains and eluted in the range of 400-600 Kdaltons. It is suggested that matrigenin activity in bone matrix has the potential to modulate remodelling (repair) in bone and in the synovial and cartilagenous regions abutting on bone.\r"

Autoimmunity to Type II collagen involving \"arthrogenic epitope(s)\", expressed on the Type II collagen molecule, as well as cell mediated immune responses to collagen may be relevant in the overall development of destruction of articular cartilage. In OA, a role for inflammation and the immune response to connective tissue macromolecules has been suggested by recent investigations. In this regard, autoimmunity plays a part in the progression of the degeneration of articular cartilage in OA.\r"

The current data give little support for an immune initiation for osteoarthritis nor for the induction of autoimmunity; rather, they suggest episodes of immune insult which may at times initiate and at times prolong clinical inflammation in mechanically deranged sites and which, via the activation of complement and mononuclear cell mediators, accelerate cartilage damage.\r"

With radioimmunoassays we have detected proteoglycans released from adult human articular cartilage in vitro and in vivo. In vitro cleavage appears to occur mainly adjacent to the hyaluronic acid binding region with the release of the rest of the molecule. Two distinct populations have been observed, the larger of which is chondroitin sulfate-rich and the smaller keratan sulfate-rich. Although they are a little smaller and probably aggregate less with hyaluronic acid, these populations correspond in size and composition to two similar populations detected in situ in healthy adult human articular cartilage. In vivo studies of synovial fluid have revealed that the proteoglycan fragments are smaller and the most commonly detected fragment is the hyaluronic acid binding region. This suggests that in vivo further degradation occurs, probably due to degradation mediated by the inflamed synovium and polymorphonuclear leucocytes present in the synovial fluid of inflamed joints.\r"

In the formative phases, because of simple structural reasons, the joint may well not be narrowed and the proliferative changes and geodes may not as yet be apparent. Even symptomatic joint disease at this time may fail of diagnosis because the customary criteria have not yet been met. I submit that all OA is secondary, the inception being remote in time and, unless dramatic, being forgotten or never even noticed. An understanding of some of the mechanical features that characterize the progression to OA and the mechanism of pathogenesis should lead to earlier diagnosis and possible application of preventive measures.\r"

Despite the development of newer chemical compounds, similarities in pharmacologic properties, efficacy in clinical trials, and toxicity profiles do not support a claim that any one drug is consistently better than another. Differences in pharmacokinetic profiles and formulations do allow for considerable flexibility in clinical therapeutics. Variabilities in drug action, effects on other organ systems, and drug interactions, particularly in the elderly, must always be considered when prescribing an individual medication. However, variability in patient response to individual drugs (both clinical benefit and toxicity) and the size of the clinical problem largely justify the number of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs available.\r"

In the first phase of the program, AAMC staff members interviewed more than 500 persons in approximately 40 medical schools and solicited responses from clerkship coordinators in six specialties on the problems encountered in evaluating students' clinical performance. These results were published in 1983. The second phase of the program, which is reported on in the present paper, consisted of developing a set of self-assessment instruments in clinical evaluation and testing these instruments by 10 pilot schools. Clinical faculty members and clerkship coordinators in the pilot schools and residents at affiliated hospitals who worked with the students were asked to identify the problems they faced in evaluating students' clinical performance, and these responses were analyzed in terms of the respondents' specialties. The problems identified by the highest percentages of clinical faculty members and residents were: inadequate guidelines for handling problem students, failure to act on negative evaluations, lack of information about problems that students bring with them into clerkships, and faculty members' unwillingness to record negative evaluations. A rank-ordering of these responses on problems showed that different specialties considered different problems to be severe. In rating difficulties in evaluating problem students, the respondents reported that the type of problem student most frequently encountered was one who cannot focus on what is important. Rank-ordering of these responses showed that each type of problem student poses different evaluation difficulties in each specialty. The respondents also identified the problems they had with the evaluation forms used in their departments.\r"

However, the need for such legislation has been diminished since the appeal of foreign medical education for U.S. students is on the decline. In this paper, the author reviews the economic and educational environment that in the mid-1970s led to the growth in the numbers of U.S. students who sought foreign medical education and contrasts it with the environment in the mid-1980s. Recent data are cited that support a reversal of that earlier trend.\r"

The most important criteria in selection of physicians by HMOs were the physician's board eligibility, motivation, bedside manner, adaptability to a changing environment, the ability to work in a team, training being done in a U.S. medical school, and ability to relate to nonphysician staff members and the reputation of the physician's residency program.\r"

Of these, 54 had been active in the 1985-86 academic year and had a total enrollment of 390 residents, an average of 7.2 residents per program. Fourteen new programs were activated in July 1986 and enrolled 46 residents, with an average of 3.3 residents per program. Virtually all the programs emphasized training in primary care and included the use of outpatient clinics where residents often work with nonphysician health-care providers. Many programs provided instruction in the use of community resources, preceptorships, and outpatient-oriented conferences and emphasized data-gathering skills. Areas that need to be addressed by program directors and the accrediting organizations are discussed by the authors.\r"

One group (116 students) used the CPS during a fourth-year cardiology elective, while another group (92 students) completed a cardiology elective that did not include use of the CPS. There were no differences between the two groups on a multiple-choice test on cardiology and a skills test on the CPS at the beginning of the clerkship. After the clerkship, the students in the CPS group achieved significantly higher scores on a multiple-choice test, a skills test on the CPS, and a skills test on cardiology patients. Both the students and faculty members expressed very favorable attitudes toward the CPS, but the patients perceived no differences between the two student groups. These data demonstrate that the CPS enhances learning both the knowledge and the skills necessary to perform a bedside cardiovascular evaluation and that the skills obtained from use of the simulator are transferable to use with patients.\r"

The average levels of stress decreased with the residents' advancing levels of training. Comparison of the top quartile with the lowest quartile of scores of everyday stress showed significantly elevated stress for rotations in the emergency room, greater frequency of being on call, and lesser amount of sleep. The residents' reports showed that the bleakest three days of residency tended to occur in the first year and during intensive care rotations. Stress during these bleakest times was significantly higher than everyday levels. The residents described the major causes of distress during bleakest times as lack of sleep, inadequate support from senior professionals, large patient load, and competition from peers. \"High quality\" teaching rounds, a night-float system, and sick leave were felt by the residents to lessen stress. To cope with the stress, the residents reported they talked to others, tried to see humor in the situation, or slept.\r"
