Preatrophy is proposed as a term to describe the subtle unmasking or normally covert subpapillary vascular channels found by the use of enhanced skin surface magnification techniques. We conducted a randomized double-blind, bilaterally paired comparison clinical trial in patients with chronic plaque psoriasis treated with twice-daily (nonoccluded) superpotent topical steroids for 2 weeks. Occult reversible delicate networks of horizontally oriented vascular channels were found within and surrounding 20% (23/118) of the involved psoriatic plaques during the course of the study. The use of a hand-held magnifying lens (8X), mineral oil, a coverglass, and adequate illumination allow recognition of preatrophy. Preatrophy was more frequently found in women than in men.\r"

Of the 53 outpatients who received suberythemogenic UVB phototherapy three times per week, 24 applied the topical corticosteroid and 29 applied the placebo cream twice daily until clearing was achieved. Nine patients in each group failed to comply with the protocol. Although there was a trend toward a slightly more rapid response in the topical corticosteroid-treated group, there was no significant difference in patients' early response to therapy, number of treatments, and UVB dose required to achieve clearing. Patients in the topical corticosteroid-treated group remained in remission longer than did patients in the control group (183 vs 116 days). Life-table analysis predicts that 62% of emollient-treated patients flare within 6 months of clearing compared with only 42% of topical corticosteroid-treated patients (p less than 0.1). For most patients with psoriasis who receive UVB therapy in an outpatient setting, the use of potent topical corticosteroids appears to produce, at most, a modest beneficial effect.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the specificity of linear IgA deposition at the cutaneous basement membrane zone for primary bullous disease, we reviewed the results of all direct immunofluorescence studies of skin biopsy specimens taken from patients seen at Mayo Clinic during the period 1982 through 1986. Of 4642 specimens submitted for direct immunofluorescence during this 5-year period, 44 from 42 patients showed linear IgA deposition at the basement membrane zone, with or without other immunoglobulins. Of these 42 patients, 36 (86%) had primary subepidermal bullous disease. Of the 36, 20 had linear IgA without IgG at the basement membrane zone (10 with clinical adult linear IgA bullous dermatosis, 2 with chronic bullous disease of childhood, and 8 with cicatricial pemphigoid). Sixteen had linear IgA and IgG at the basement membrane zone (10 with clinical cicatricial pemphigoid, 5 with bullous pemphigoid, and 1 with epidermolysis bullosa acquisita). There was a high frequency of mucosal involvement (67% of the 36 patients) and a somewhat higher frequency of ocular involvement in patients with cicatricial pemphigoid who had linear IgA without IgG at the basement membrane zone (6 of 8) than in those who had both immunoglobulins at the basement membrane zone (4 of 10). These results show that the direct immunofluorescence finding of linear IgA deposition at the basement membrane zone correlates with primary subepidermal bullous disease in a high percentage of patients but reflects a heterogeneous group of blistering disorders.\r"

The histologic pattern comprised edema, necrosis, and inflammation of skin, subcutaneous fat, and fascial tissue. Hyalin necrosis of sweat glands was observed in five patients. Thrombosis of vessels at all levels was a prominent feature, suggesting that study of coagulation factors may be important. Diagnosis may be confirmed by the histologic picture; however, microbiologic material is essential to guide therapy.\r"

There was no ICAM-1 expressed on keratinocytes of normal skin; ICAM-1 was induced as early as 4 hours after the application of the patch in some subjects. By 48 hours after the application of the patch, all specimens contained ICAM-1-positive keratinocytes. This was concurrent with a heavy mononuclear cell dermal infiltrate and maximum clinical manifestations. Expression of human lymphocyte antigen (HLA)-DR or other inducible surface proteins on keratinocytes under these conditions was much less frequent. When specimens from primary irritant dermatitis were used, only 1 of 14 cases had keratinocytes expressing ICAM-1 at 48 hours, the time of maximum clinical manifestation. Among benign inflammatory lesions, most cases resembled the allergic patch test specimens in that ICAM-1 was expressed to a large degree on keratinocytes. Again, the expression of HLA-DR was variable. Malignant skin lesions, on the other hand, were much less consistent and generally lower in terms of ICAM-1 expression on keratinocytes. Furthermore, in contrast to the benign cutaneous conditions, some malignant skin lesions contained keratinocytes that expressed class II antigens or other inducible surface proteins in the absence of ICAM-1. These data suggest that ICAM-1 plays a role in the specific immune response by facilitating either antigen presentation or lymphocytic infiltration.\r"

The case is also unusual because of the short course and low cumulative dose of drug received and because of the calcification of elastic fibers. The calcification of elastic fibers suggests that this case may represent an unusual variant of elastosis perforans serpiginosa or an overlap with pseudoxanthoma elasticum. All reported cases of D-penicillamine-induced elastosis perforans serpiginosa are reviewed, and histopathologic and electron microscopic findings are presented.

Such halos have frequently been thought to be recurrent caries or voids in the material. Fifteen of 45 radiopaque composite resin restorations placed by students enrolled in a first-year preclinical operative dentistry course exhibited such halos. Micrographs showed that a thick layer of unfilled resin bonding agent was present. These halos were reproduced in other teeth when excess bonding was not blown off. The results indicate the importance of meticulous technique.\r"

Resulting complications include severe daytime sleepiness, morning headaches, loud snoring, and disturbed nighttime sleep. Patients affected with OSA are frequently hypertensive and can have dangerous cardiac arrhythmias. The diagnosis of OSA requires an all-night polysomnographic recording; neither snoring nor other subjective complaints constitute adequate criteria for treatment. The treatment objective for OSA is to maintain airway patency. A potential treatment discussed here is temporary advancement of the mandible or tongue during sleep with the use of dental appliances.\r"

The focal absence of epithelial cells in airways of patients with asthma is well documented. When the luminal surface of canine bronchi is rubbed gently, the only morphologic change observed is the disappearance of the epithelial cell layer. The removal of the epithelium causes an increased sensitivity of the bronchial smooth muscle to acetylcholine without alteration in the maximal responsiveness to the cholinergic transmitter. The augmentation cannot be attributed to reduced enzymatic breakdown of acetylcholine after removal of the epithelial cells, since it is not affected by inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase. It cannot be attributed to disappearance of a diffusion barrier, since epithelium removal also augments the contractions evoked by electrical stimulation of the cholinergic nerve endings. Removal of the epithelium potentiates the contraction evoked by histamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine in a manner similar to that observed for acetylcholine. The potentiating effect of epithelium removal is more pronounced in larger rather than in smaller bronchi. By contrast, the relaxations evoked by beta-adrenergic agonists are less pronounced in bronchi without, rather than in bronchi with, epithelium. The influence of the epithelium on isoproterenol-induced relaxation is more pronounced in smaller rather than in larger bronchi. These observations suggest that the bronchial epithelium releases an inhibitory factor that partially counteracts activation of the airway smooth muscle by bronchoconstrictor substances.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Efficacy of each drug was assessed by daily symptom scores and plasma- and 24-hour urine-histamine levels. After completion of the study, symptom scores revealed that seven of the eight children exhibited a greater reduction in symptoms while they were receiving hydroxyzine (p less than 0.05). The symptoms most likely to improve with treatment with hydroxyzine were flushing and abdominal pain. Analysis of plasma- and 24-hour urine-histamine levels at the beginning and end of each trial period of each drug revealed no significant differences (p greater than 0.20). Changes in 24-hour urine-histamine levels, but not plasma-histamine levels, correlated with changes in symptom scores. We conclude that ketotifen offers no advantage over hydroxyzine in the treatment of pediatric mastocytosis.\r"

  ".W": "In 22 patients with cat asthma who were highly sensitive to cat, we compared, double-blind, the effects of immunotherapy with cat-hair and dander extract (11 patients) with effects of placebo (11 patients). Patients matched by intradermal skin test titration, leukocyte histamine release, and the doses of both cat extract and methacholine required for 20% fall in FEV1 were randomly assigned to one of the two treatment groups. Immunotherapy doses were increased to a maintenance dose of 4.56 Food and Drug Administration (FDA) units of Fel d I or if maintenance dose was less, to the highest tolerated dose. Before and during immunotherapy, we measured by intradermal titration the dose of cat extract, in FDA units of Fel d I equivalents, required for (1) 2+ end point (wheal diameter, greater than or equal to 10 mm; erythema diameter, 20 to 30 mm) and (2) 20 mm end point (erythema diameter, 20 mm). By prick skin test, we measured (1) the dose of cat extract that produced a wheal equal in area to that produced by histamine, 1 mg/ml, (2) the doses of cat extract that produced a wheal 22 mm2 in area, and (3) the sum of the wheal areas produced by five prick tests to 23.8, 7.1, 2.4, 0.7, and 0.2 FDA units per milliliter of Fel d I, respectively. After 1 year of treatment, in comparison to control patients, treated patients had significant increases in the ratio 1 year value/pretreatment value for the doses of cat extract required for intradermal test end points 1 and 2 (p less than 0.01), for prick test end point 1 (p less than 0.01), for end point 2 (p = 0.015), and significant decreases in this ratio for prick test end point 3 (p = 0.015). Treated patients also had significant increases in cat extract required for a 20% fall in FEV1 (p less than 0.01), in IgG antibodies toward whole cat extract, Fel d I and cat albumin (p less than 0.001), and in IgE antibodies toward whole cat extract, (p less than 0.01). Thus, a decrease in skin sensitivity to cat extract demonstrated by both intradermal and prick methods occurred in patients after 1 year of immunotherapy with cat extract at a time when bronchial sensitivity to cat extract was decreased and IgG and IgE antibodies toward cat extract were increased.\r"

In this investigation, we have studied the possible occurrence of similar activities in 20 atopic individuals on natural exposure to allergen, that is, during the birch-pollen season. Since eosinophil accumulation is a hallmark of an ongoing allergic inflammation in the respiratory tract also, the possible production of eosinophil chemotactic activity (ECA) was examined in serum after allergen challenge and at natural exposure to pollen. Both HL-NCA and HL-ECA were produced to a significant extent (p less than 0.001) during the season, with the peak of activities occurring simultaneously with the peak pollen count. HL-ECA was produced after allergen challenge of subjects with asthma in the laboratory, as has been demonstrated for NCA previously. The activity of the HS-NCA was unaltered during season. Gel-filtration studies of the major HL-NCA and HL-ECA indicated a molecular weight for both activities of 100 to 150,000, and the activities produced during season cochromatographed with the HL-NCA and HL-ECA produced after allergen challenge in the laboratory, suggesting that all these activities are due to one and the same molecule. The results suggest that the heat-labile chemotactic activity found in serum of atopic subjects and subjects with asthma after allergen exposure may be involved in the attraction of eosinophils and neutrophils to the site of allergic inflammation.\r"

Neutrophils may exert their effects through the generation of superoxide O2- anion and other oxygen-derived free radicals. O2- generation by neutrophils has been demonstrated to be modulated by adenosine at physiologic concentrations. Therefore, we have investigated the function of peripheral blood neutrophils with respect to O2- anion generation and its regulation by adenosine in both subjects with asthma and normal subjects and also the relationship between O2- anion generation and airway hyperresponsiveness in subjects with asthma. Purified neutrophils were obtained from eight subjects with stable asthma and seven normal control subjects not taking chronic medications. O2- anion generation in subjects with asthma was significantly higher compared with that of normal subjects after stimulation with either N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (mean, 14.8 nmol/10(6) cells for subjects with asthma versus mean, 9.6 nmol/10(6) cells for normal subjects; p less than 0.01) or phorbol myristate acetate (mean, 13.6 nmol/10(6) cells versus mean, 8.1 nmol/10(6) cells; p less than 0.05). Adenosine inhibited N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine-stimulated O2- anion generation in a dose-related fashion in subjects with asthma and normal subjects to a similar degree. Adenosine had no effect on O2- anion generation after phorbol myristate acetate stimulation. These results indicate that neutrophils from subjects with asthma produce more O2- anion when they are stimulated than do neutrophils from normal subjects and that this difference is not due to adenosine modulation. In subjects with asthma, O2- anion generation correlated with the degree of airway hyperresponsiveness to inhaled methacholine.\r"

Identification of demented family members is usually based on recall by relatives. This study examines the validity of the classification of Alzheimer's disease and other dementias based on relatives' reports. Close relatives of autopsy-confirmed dementia cases were asked to complete a questionnaire describing the patient's symptoms. These informants were familiar with the patient's disease and involved in his/her care prior to death. The questionnaire included the DSM-III criteria for Primary Degenerative Dementia and the Hachinski Ischemic Scale. A diagnosis derived from the close relatives' responses was compared to the neuropathologic diagnosis for thirty-six cases: 20 Alzheimer's disease, 9 mixed Alzheimer's disease, and 7 non-Alzheimer's disease dementias. The diagnosis of Primary Degenerative Dementia derived from questionnaire responses had a sensitivity of 0.93 and specificity of 0.43 for pathologic Alzheimer's disease. Few vascular dementias were included in the series, thereby precluding the study of so-called multi-infarct dementia. Hachinski scores based on relatives' responses classified 40% of pathologically pure Alzheimer's disease cases as multi-infarct dementia (HIS greater than 7). Thus, using these elevated Hachinski scores to rule out Alzheimer's disease would cause substantial misclassification. Diagnosis based on questionnaire Primary Degenerative Dementia criteria was quite sensitive but relatively nonspecific. When attempting to obtain a complete family history or pedigree that describes the occurrence of Alzheimer's disease and other dementias in all family members, the questionnaire approach should be supplemented with additional information from medical records, physicians, and other relatives.\r"

Both groups had comparable risk factors for stroke, which were treated similarly, as well as comparable initial cerebral blood flow values, as measured by the 133xenon inhalation method, and initial scores on Cognitive Capacity Screening Examination testing. Patients were evaluated at intervals of one year. Significant improvements were demonstrated for cerebral perfusion values (P less than .0001) and cognitive performance scores (P less than .0001) among aspirin-treated patients compared to untreated controls at each of three annual follow-up evaluations. Both men and women benefited from aspirin therapy and their quality of life and independence appeared to be improved, which was not apparent in the control group.

The current study provides evidence that thymus transplantation leading to the restoration of Bio-Breeding T cell proliferative function can also significantly reduce the incidence of insulitis and prevent the development of diabetes.

Concurrent with the loss of C3 staining from the MGN lesion at 2 to 4 wk after transplantation, the proteinuria decreased from the transplanted kidney (p less than 0.02). Thereafter, from 2 to 28 wk no further decrease was noted in proteinuria which stabilized at a lower but still abnormal level. No appreciable decrease in IgG deposits in MGN lesion was noted up to 12 wk but at 28 wk the deposits had decreased significantly (p less than 0.005). However, the deposits did not resolve completely even at 40 wk. The results indicate that in MGN one component of proteinuria is due to ongoing activation of C with the deposition of new antibody and the other is perhaps due to structural damage to glomerular filter. The former appears reversible and the later irreversible. Although the resolution of IgG deposits in the lesion is very slow significant improvement can occur with time (several months).\r"

  ".W": "Acute rejection of allogeneic and semiallogeneic marrow grafts has long been considered to be a function of the natural immune system because it shares many features with NK activity in mice. With the use of a recently developed in vivo adoptive transfer assay in which spleen cells are transferred from mice able to reject a particular marrow graft into mice that fail to do so, we show that the cells responsible for induction of marrow graft rejection indeed display the phenotype of NK cells: they lack the T cell Ag CD4 and CD8 but express the NK Ag NK1 and ASGM1. The rejection induced by adoptively transferred cells is exquisitely specific--a feature that points to a specific recognition process by the transferred cells. To elucidate what the recognition structure on these cells may be we found that they express CD3 and most likely the beta-chain of the TCR. Highly purified responder cells with the NK1+, CD3+, CD4-, CD8- phenotype, when transferred into nonresponder recipients, cause specific marrow graft rejection. We conclude that the acute rejection of bone marrow grafts is caused by a cell that expresses NK phenotype but is of T cell lineage. This may suggest the specificity of acute marrow graft rejection is caused by a specific recognition process that involves TCR.\r"

Human IL-4 alone did not induce LAK activity and inhibited IL-2 induction of LAK activity from unstimulated PBMC, peripheral blood null cells, spleen cells, and lymph node cells in a dose-dependent manner. IL-4 also inhibited several phenomena induced by IL-2 such as cell proliferation, augmentation of NK activity, increase of Leu-19+ cells, and expression of IL-2R(p55) on either CD3+ or Leu-19+ cells. IL-4, however, augmented cell proliferation with other T cell mitogens including PHA, Con A, PMA, or allo-MHC Ag with or without IL-2. In contrast to unstimulated cells, IL-4 alone induced marked cell proliferation and LAK activity as well as Leu-19+ cells from in vitro IL-2 preactivated PBMC or null cells, and did not inhibit IL-2 induced cell proliferation, LAK activity, Leu-19+ cells and IL-2R(p55) expression, but rather augmented them with low doses of IL-2. Although IL-4 alone induced LAK activity from peripheral blood of some patients previously given IL-2, IL-4 inhibited in vitro LAK generation with IL-2 from these cells in most cases. Therefore, IL-4 appears to directly inhibit the IL-2 activation pathway via IL-2R(p70) and prevent resting LAK precursors from proliferating and differentiating into final effector cells. However, once cells were sufficiently preactivated by IL-2, IL-4 induced LAK activity and did not inhibit IL-2 activation of these cells. These data suggest an immunoregulatory role of IL-4 on human null cells and T cells.\r"

  ".U": "89235159\r", 
  ".W": "It has previously been shown that during degranulation Mac-1 (CD11b/CD18)--a glycoprotein that plays a central role in neutrophil adhesion-is up-regulated on PMN surfaces. It has been assumed that this quantitative change in adhesion Ag expression on the cell surface would in turn lead to increased cellular adhesiveness. In contrast, we found that at an incubation temperature of 16 degrees C, stimulated neutrophil adhesion to plastic tissue culture dishes in the presence of FMLP (2.5 x 10(-6) M), TNF (10 ng/ml), or PAF (1 x 10(-4) M) occurred without cellular degranulation or Mac-1 surface up-regulation as measured cytofluorometrically. As shown by functional inhibition studies employing monoclonal antibodies 60.3 (anti-CD18) and 60.1 (anti-CD11b), adhesion at 16 degrees C, where no CD11b/CD18 up-regulation was seen, is mediated by CD11b/CD18 just as it is at 37 degrees C, where degranulation and CD11b/CD18 up-regulation could be demonstrated. The physiologic importance of these findings was underscored by experiments done on endothelial monolayers, which showed that PMN association with endothelial cells is absolutely independent from the quantitative up-regulation of Mac-1 on PMN surfaces. When neutrophils were stimulated at 37 degrees C by endotoxin, an agent that does not induce aggregation (a form of intercellular adhesion), Mac-1 surface expression increased only after cells had become adherent, whereas cells held in suspension to prevent cell-substrate adhesion neither degranulated nor up-regulated their Mac-1 surface expression. Thus, not only is adherence independent of degranulation and Mac-1 cell surface up-regulation, but both degranulation and Mac-1 surface up-regulation appear to depend on the process of adhesion. Correspondingly, incubation of neutrophils with antibodies 60.1 and 60.3 inhibited not only adhesion of cells stimulated with FMLP at 37 degrees C but degranulation as well. These results indicate that Mac-1 influences degranulation as well as it controls adhesion not by its mere quantity on the cell surface, but rather by an yet undefined molecular modulation.\r"

  ".U": "89235162\r", 
  ".W": "Mononuclear cells, obtained from the spleens and lungs of influenza virus-seropositive C57BL/6 mice at 2 to 4 days after re-infection with homologous virus (strain A/Bangkok/1/79), produced a low m.w. factor in vitro that prevents the biologic expression, but not production, of the lymphokine, leukocyte migration inhibition factor (LIF). The low m.w. factor inhibited LIF activity without destroying the LIF molecule inasmuch as simple dialysis restored lymphokine activity to culture supernatants. Production of the low m.w. factor was observed from 2 to 4 days after re-infection, at which time the delayed-type hypersensitivity response to viral Ag was suppressed. In contrast, LIF was produced by splenocytes and lung mononuclear cells obtained at all times tested after re-infection (from 2 to 30 days). Production of the low m.w. factor required re-infection of influenza A virus-seropositive mice with type A virus; re-infection with influenza B virus failed to induce production. Ag specificity was also required in vitro for splenocytes to produce the factor; cells from type A virus-re-infected mice required type A Ag stimulation. Cell depletion studies with mAb plus C revealed that macrophages and T cells along with Ag stimulation were required for factor production by spleen cells. However, mononuclear cells obtained within 4 days from the lungs of re-infected mice did not require in vitro Ag stimulation for production of the low m.w. factor, and factor production was dependent upon the presence of CD4+ (L3T4) cells in the culture. Fractionation of culture supernatants over a Sephadex G-50 column indicated that the factor had a molecular mass of 2 to 3 kDa, and by FPLC chromatofocusing over a Mono P column, the factor eluted at a pH of approximately 8.2. Thus, re-exposure of influenza virus-seropositive mice to homologous virus resulted in the production of a low m.w. factor that prevented the biologic expression of LIF, but not its production. Lymphokines are an important component of the delayed-type hypersensitivity response; the presence of mononuclear cells secreting a low m.w. factor and LIF concomitantly at the site of virus replication (lungs) and the capacity of the factor to block the biologic expression of LIF in vitro suggest that the factor may have a role in the regulation of a delayed-type hypersensitivity response in vivo during re-infection.\r"

  ".U": "89235163\r", 
  ".W": "We have previously suggested that variation within the circumsporozoite protein of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum was the result of selection by immune T cells. Our hypothesis has been supported by experiments documenting a lack of cross-reactivity between variant peptides from the C-terminal region for murine T cells primed by 7G8-specific sequences. Now, by using a murine model we have found that peptides representing variant regions (amino acid residues 326-343 and 361-380) of two other parasite clones (Wel and LE5) are also immunodominant for murine T cells. However, there were distinct changes in response profiles. For example, whereas lymph node cells from H-2d and H mice immunized with peptides from the 326-343 region of all three variants proliferated in vitro after homologous challenge, only lymph node cells from H-2b mice immunized with LE5 peptide proliferate after homologous challenge. In contrast, only LE5 did not induce lymphoproliferation against homologous challenge in the H-2s background. These data suggest that the naturally occurring substitutions affect agretopic (i.e., Ia). Peptides from all variants representing the 361-380 domain were recognized only by T cells from H-2k mice. Also, in nearly all cases, T cells primed by one sequence did not recognize variant sequences. The immunodominance of these domains from three different clones and the lack of significant cross-reactivity further supports the hypothesis that variation is the result of T cell immune pressure.\r"

  ".W": "The human mAb 33G2 has high capacity to inhibit in vitro invasion of erythrocytes by Plasmodium falciparum merozoites and, thus, is of special interest with regard to protective immunity against the parasite. In order to obtain more information about asexual blood stage Ag of P. falciparum that are seen by this antibody, material from synchronized P. falciparum cultures was studied by immunofluorescence, immunoelectron microscopy, and immunoblotting. Reactivity was mainly confined to the membrane of infected erythrocytes. Soon after merozoite invasion the antibody stained the erythrocyte membrane. This membrane-associated staining faded during intracellular development of the parasites. Beginning about 18 h after invasion, a dotted pattern appeared which increased in strength with time and persisted to schizont rupture. Pf155/RESA was the major Ag recognized in immunoblots of parasites collected throughout the entire erythrocytic cycle, although other polypeptides also bound the antibody. Among these was a 260-kDa polypeptide found in late trophozoites and schizonts. The specificity of the antibody was analyzed with synthetic peptides corresponding to repeated sequences in the P. falciparum Ag Pf155/RESA, Pf11.1, and Ag332. Synthetic peptides related to Ag332 were the most efficient inhibitors of antibody binding in immunofluorescence studies and cell ELISA. A beta-galactosidase-Ag332 fusion protein was also efficient in reversing reinvasion inhibition caused by 33G2. These results define a family of cross-reactive P. falciparum Ag recognized by mAb 33G2 and suggest that Ag332 was its original target.\r"

Bone marrow plus spleen cells from B10.D2 mice were transplanted into lethally irradiated B10.D2 (syngeneic recipient) or H-2d-compatible BALB/c (allogeneic recipient) to produce a chronic form of GvHR. BALB/c recipients of an allogeneic transplant demonstrated a marked and proportional lymphoid depletion of the spleen with normal percentages of B cells, T cells, and CD4+ and CD8+ T cell subsets. Mice with GvHR made normal numbers of PFC/10(5) spleen cells in response to the T-independent Ag, but a significantly depressed number of PFC/10(5) spleen cells to the T-dependent Ag compared with normal B10.D2 mice and with irradiated B10.D2 recipients of syngeneic B10.D2 marrow plus spleen cells. Mice undergoing the minor Ag GvHR made significantly larger numbers of PFC/10(5) spleen cells after secondary immunization with TNP-SRBC compared with controls. In vitro assays demonstrated that B cells from mice with GvHR responded to T help from normal B10.D2 mice and that T cells from mice with GvHR provided help to normal B cells after in vivo immunization. These data demonstrate that radiation chimeras with GvHR in response to minor histocompatibility Ag have relatively normal B cell function and an apparent defect in T helper cell function that is reversible by immunization with appropriate Ag.\r"

Syngeneic thyrocytes and hepatocytes were found to be resistant to the cytolytic action of activated macrophages.

Although both proteins and glycolipids are targets of anti-islet cell antibodies, the Ag have not been purified or characterized. Previously, we observed that rat insulinoma (RIN) cell lines varied in their reactivity with both human antibodies and murine mAb A2B5, which binds to polysialo gangliosides. To determine the chemical basis of the varied immunoreactivity, we analyzed the glycosphingolipids of 5 RIN lines. Glycolipids bound by two mAb and by antibodies in the sera of type I diabetics were identified. The more immunoreactive RIN lines contained a much higher content of gangliosides and a higher proportion of complex gangliosides. The major gangliosides were GM3, GD3, and GT3. By high performance TLC immunostaining, we demonstrated that A2B5 and R2D6, an anti-beta cell murine mAb, bound most strongly to ganglioside GT3. The binding of human sera to gangliosides was analyzed by an ELISA assay. Although both normal and diabetic sera contained antibodies to various glycolipids, binding to GT3 was significantly elevated in 31 new-onset type I diabetics (p less than 0.001). The presence of the GT3 trisialosyl epitope on human islet cells was shown by immunofluorescent staining by both R2D6 and A2B5. These findings support previous suggestions that gangliosides play an important role in the immunopathology of type I diabetes, and identify for the first time a specific ganglioside Ag that is the target for autoantibodies in a subset of diabetic patients.\r"

We studied the primitive stem cells (PSC) from which most circulating lymphocytes and erythrocytes were descended during 300 to 400 days in recipients of genetically distinguishable marrow mixtures in competitive repopulation. Equivalent PSC concentrations (Eq. PSC Conc. or Conc.) were estimated, with the notion of common PSCs contributing equally in lymphoid and myeloid compartments. Similar estimation was done for common PSCs from which lymphocytes (and erythrocytes) drawn at successive sampling times about 100 days apart were descended. The percentages of lymphocyte and erythrocyte types, P1 and Pe, measured in each recipient were closely correlated, especially after 6 months and later. Close correlations were also found in cells sampled at successive one hundred day intervals, especially after the first. Apparently a few PSCs or their direct descendents produced most of the blood lymphocytes and E, and this production continued for many months. Concentrations of these PSCs (Equivalent PSC concentrations) were about one per 10(5) marrow cells from young donors. This is much lower than previous estimates, probably because our methods focus only on the most interesting precursors, those from which most of the circulating cells were descended. Equivalent PSC concentrations were about two-fold higher in old donors; old marrow produced correspondingly higher P1 and Pe values, but these declined with time. There were also small increases with time in the P1 and Pe values with young donors. To explain the temporal trends, we suggest that excess concentrations of precursors less primitive than PSC are present in old marrow, and their contribution to the differentiated cell population gradually declines. Possibly such precursors, as well as true PSC, proliferate in old donors to compensate for deficiencies that develop with age.\r"

  ".W": "Many recent studies have established the eosinophil as an active proinflammatory participant in a variety of disease states, most notably in allergic and helminthic disorders. In order to understand the effector role of eosinophils, factors which promote a selective eosinophilic infiltrate must be delineated. Eosinophil adherence to vascular endothelium is the first step in the formation of such an infiltrate. However, studies thus far have failed to identify factors which selectively activate the adherence of eosinophils. We have therefore speculated that the selective enrichment of eosinophils may result from nonselective recruitment of several leukocyte types combined with the production of local factors that promote the survival of eosinophils and not of other cells. We report that endothelial cell-conditioned medium selectively prolongs eosinophil survival up to 6 days in culture in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Stimulation of human vascular endothelial cells with IL-1 caused an increase in the generation of eosinophil survival-promoting activity, whereas stimulation with platelet-activating factor did not. Supernatants from human vascular endothelial cells cultured for 48 h in the presence of the glucocorticoid, dexamethasone, were less active in promoting eosinophil survival than control supernatants. These results suggest that factors produced locally in the vascular microenvironment may selectively promote eosinophil survival and may be under the regulation of cytokines and glucocorticoids.\r"

A total of 83% of the individuals responded to at least one of the six peptides tested, confirming that these epitopes are immunodominant. A much greater number of individuals than expected by chance (32% of the responders to Th2R and 27% of the responders to Th3R) reacted to all three of the variant peptides for that epitope, indicating interdependency of the T cell responses, suggestive of cross-reactivity. Nevertheless, some subjects' T cells were clearly able to distinguish each variant peptide from the others. Using EBV transformed B cells, lymphocytes from 10 of the individuals were HLA typed. In this small group, HLA DRw13 was associated with a positive response to any of the peptides, whereas there was a negative association between DQw3 and response to any of the peptides. These results, although limited by the small sample size, suggest that recognition of T epitopes may be Ir gene linked. Our findings suggest that it may be possible to broaden the immunogenicity of an anti-sporozoite malaria vaccine.\r"

The effector lymphocytes have low buoyant density, carry CD16 and HNK1 markers as well as the CD11a-c/CD18 leukocytic cell adhesion molecules. One of these molecules, made up of CD11b-CD18 (alpha- and beta-chains), is also the receptor for iC3b. We studied the role of the cell adhesion molecules in the NK effect on targets with and without C3-fragments. We focused on the E/T interaction of opsonized cells in the presence of anti CD18 mAb. mAb directed to the CD11a molecule caused 0 to 30% inhibition of the lysis of both non-opsonized and opsonized cells whereas the mAb antibody directed to the CD11c molecule had no effect. Reagents reactive with the iC3b binding site of CD11b (alpha-chain of the CR3) molecule did not alter the lysis of non-opsonized targets whereas they abrogated the C3-mediated increment of the Nk effect on opsonized cells. Two mAb preparations, 60.3 and IB4, directed to the CD18 chain shared by the three cell adhesion molecules abrogated in a dose-dependent way the lysis of both non-opsonized and opsonized targets. The 60.3 mAb inhibited the iC3b binding site of CR3 (despite its localization on the alpha-chain) and in accordance it inhibited the binding of lymphocytes to the opsonized target also. The IB4 did not affect this site and in accordance it inhibited only partially the binding of effectors to the C3 fragment carrying Raji, nevertheless it inhibited their lysis. This result indicates that the iC3b-CR3 bridge is insufficient for triggering the lysis in absence of the contact through the adhesion molecules.\r"

This report describes a new approach that employs pretreatment of effector cells with 8-methoxy-psoralen (8-MOP) and ultraviolet A light (UVA) to render the effector cells of graft rejection immunogenic for the syngeneic recipient. Reinfusion of photodamaged cells resulted in an immunosuppressive host response that permitted prolonged retention of histoincompatible skin grafts and specifically inhibited in vitro and in vivo responses that correlate with allograft rejection. Eight days after BALB/c mice received CBA/j skin grafts, their splenocytes served as a source of alloreactive effector cells. The splenocytes were treated with 100 ng/ml 8-MOP and 1 J/cm2 UVA before reinfusion into naive BALB/c recipients. Recipient mice were tested for tolerance to alloantigens in mixed leukocyte culture (MLC), cytotoxicity (CTL), delayed type hypersensitivity assays (DTH), and challenge with a fresh CBA/j graft. Splenocytes from BALB/c recipients of photoinactivated splenocytes containing the effector cells of CBA/j alloantigen rejection proliferated poorly in MLC and generated lower cytotoxic T cell responses to CBA/j alloantigens in comparison with sensitized and naive controls. Splenocytes from these hyporesponsive mice suppressed the MLC and CTL response to alloantigen from sensitized and naive BALB/c mice. In vivo the DTH response was specifically suppressed to the relevant alloantigen in comparison with controls. Moreover, BALB/c mice treated in this fashion retained a CBA/j skin graft for up to 42 d posttransplantation without visual evidence of rejection. These results indicate that the in vivo and in vitro response to alloantigen can be attenuated by pretreating the host with photoinactivated splenocytes containing the effector cells of alloantigen rejection.\r"

In pemphigoid and pemphigus, however, the distribution of IgG subclasses was heterogeneous, with IgG4 being the dominant autoantibody. Pemphigoid (herpes) gestationis factor, the circulating anti-basement membrane zone autoantibody thought to be pathogenic in pemphigoid gestationis, is therefore, an IgG1 antibody, with inferred complement binding capacity. Tissue damage in pemphigoid gestationis is apparently mediated by complement fixation which is detected via the classical complement cascade.\r"

  ".W": "Immunoreactivity of vitronectin was investigated in 100 skin specimens from different body regions in 87 individuals of different ages using monoclonal and polyclonal anti-vitronectin antibodies in an avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex technique. Vitronectin immunoreactivity was found in conjunction with dermal elastic fibers in all subjects older than 13 years. No vitronectin immunostaining was detected in subjects younger than six years, suggesting deposition of vitronectin during late childhood or early adolescence. Using an immunogold staining procedure, vitronectin immunoreactivity was ultrastructurally localized to the periphery of elastic fibers. The blood level of vitronectin in 20 healthy newborns was 67% of the adult level, suggesting active biosynthesis already in the fetus. To investigate whether vitronectin is deposited as part of the SC5b-9 complex or as uncomplexed protein, the immunoreactivity of vitronectin was compared with that of C9, using monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies against the C9 neoantigen. Distinct C9 neoantigen immunoreactivity was demonstrated in association with dermal elastic fibers in human skin in adults but only in subjects older than 30 years. The intensity of C9 neoantigen immunoreactivity appeared to increase with age and was found to be stronger in sun-exposed skin than in sun-protected skin. These findings indicate that uncomplexed vitronectin is deposited during childhood or early adolescence and that terminal complement complexes (C5b-9 and/or SC5b-9) are deposited on elastic fibers later on in life. Hypothetically, the tissue form of vitronectin may be involved in the prevention of tissue damage in proximity to local complement activation. In addition, it may be physiologically important as substratum for cells, stimulating cell migration and anchorage.\r"

  ".W": "Recent studies in our laboratory have shown that C3d,g, a 41,000-Da fragment of the third component of complement, is present along the base of the lamina densa and in the sublamina densa region of normal human epidermal basement membrane, but absent from the skin of a patient with congenital C3 deficiency. In studies of human skin, papulonodular basal cell carcinomas have served as a useful model for the investigation of various basement membrane antigens and matrix proteins. To further investigate the presence of C3d,g within epidermal basement membrane as well as examine its relationship with other known basement membrane constituents, we have analyzed serial sections of ten papulonodular basal cell carcinomas by light and immunofluorescence microscopy. In these studies, C3d,g was either absent (N = 9) or minimumly detectable (N = 1) in tumor nest basement membranes. While bullous pemphigoid and KF-1 antigens were absent (N = 6 and N = 3, respectively) or significantly decreased (N = 4 and N = 7, respectively), epidermolysis bullosa acquisita antigen was routinely present though somewhat (N = 3) or moderately decreased (N = 3). Laminin and type IV collagen were expressed normally in all tumor nest basement membranes. All constituents, including C3d,g, were present in adjacent normal epidermal basement membrane of these tumor samples. This study has demonstrated antigenic alterations within each ultrastructural subregion of papulonodular basal cell carcinoma tumor nest basement membranes by identifying the virtual absence of C3d,g (sublamina densa) as well as a significant reduction in KF-1 (lamina densa) and bullous pemphigoid (lamina lucida) antigens. Moreover, the presence of laminin, type IV collagen, and epidermolysis bullosa acquisita antigen in tumor nest basement membranes suggests that these particular constituents neither cleave C3 nor act as essential binding sites for passive incorporation of this complement component in epidermal basement membrane. These studies give additional support to the hypothesis that C3d,g is a previously unrecognized constituent of normal epidermal basement membrane and does not represent passive incorporation of circulating C3 at this site in human skin.\r"

Using pulse-labeling of 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU), a thymidine analogue incorporated into the nuclei of DNA-synthesizing (S-phase) cells, the antiproliferative effect of CsA was revealed as a decrease in the number of BrdU-positive human EK grafted onto nude mice receiving a daily subcutaneous injection of 50 mg/kg of CsA. The blood level of CsA in the treated mice, evaluated by a radioimmunologic assay, was 679 +/- 501 ng/ml (n = 3). Using an antibody to leukocyte common antigen, it was shown that no human lymphocytes were present in the grafted skin. Therefore, this antiproliferative effect of CsA on human EK seems to be due to a direct effect on EK rather than to lymphocyte regulation.\r"

By immunoelectron microscopy, normal melanocytes were shown to express beta 2M on the cell surface. In lentigo maligna melanomas and acral lentiginous melanomas, the mean percentages of beta 2M-positive tumor cells were significantly lower in thick (greater than 1.50 mm) primary lesions and metastases than in thin (less than or equal to 1.50 mm) primary lesions. The evidence suggests that melanocyte-derived melanoma clones with a low grade of malignancy preserve class 1 HLA expression, and that the clones with a high grade of malignancy tend to lose the antigen expression. Nevus cells in common nevi have little or no expression of beta 2M. In halo nevi, however, beta 2M were detected on nevus cells in the lesions associated with inflammatory infiltration. Immunohistochemical analyses of the cellular composition of the inflammatory cells in halo nevi demonstrated the presence of cytotoxic T cells together with helper/inducer T cells, Langerhans cells, and macrophages. It appears that nevus cells of halo nevi are destroyed by cytotoxic T cells and that class 1 HLA antigens expressed on nevus cells play an important role in the target cell recognition and lysis by specific cytotoxic T cells.\r"

Neoplasms of pigment cells in fish are also of three phenotypes, melanomas (melanophoromas), erythrophoromas, and iridophoromas, showing the phenotypes of their corresponding normal pigment cells. These pigment cell tumors are among the most common types in bony fish and seem to be more common in fish than in mammals, including humans. Moreover, there are no mammalian neoplasms corresponding to erythrophoromas and iridophoromas in fish. The complexities in the nature and classification of pigment cell tumors in fish will be discussed on the basis of a survey of our collection of these tumors at the Cancer Institute. The etiology of pigment cell tumors in fish is obscure. In order to know whether activated oncogene is involved in the genesis of erythrophoromas in goldfish, the ras genes from normal and erythrophoroma cells were cloned and their nucleotide sequences were compared. The goldfish ras gene and human ras genes showed striking homology. However, no point mutation at the 12th codon was observed in ras genes isolated from erythrophoromas. Besides pigment cell tumors in fish, abnormal pigmentation or depigmentation in flounders associated with diseased conditions is also described.\r"

Large inter-individual variations are found in the basal and induced arylhydrocarbon-hydroxylase activities. 2) UV-induced unscheduled DNA synthesis was demonstrated in human epidermal cells on autoradiographs. We also found that DNA repair is defective in epidermal cells isolated from xeroderma pigmentosum by a new explant-outgrowth culture. 3) Human epidermal cells are unique in that there is a large number of binding sites to phorbol esters compared with mouse epidermal cells, but there is no down-regulation. Further, human epidermal cells show essentially negative responses to tumor promoters, i.e., no stimulation of DNA synthesis, sugar uptake, and no induction of ornithine decarboxylase activity. 4) Human epidermal cells contain 1.5 x 10(5) binding sites per cell for epidermal growth factor (EGF), whereas squamous cell carcinomas of skin and oral cavity have larger amounts of EGF receptors in the order of 10(6) per cell. 5) Based on the above results, we attempted to transform human epidermal cells by the treatment with chemical carcinogens, but until now no transformation was obtained.\r"

  ".W": "The near epidemic of melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancer in the United States and certain other industrialized nations is attributable to cutaneous exposure to sunlight more than to any other factor. Chronic exposure to UV irradiation and a high total cumulative dose may be less deleterious than are periodic bursts of large amounts of sun exposure leading to severe sunburn. Such an exposure pattern is characteristic of individuals such as office workers whose outdoor activities are irregular rather than daily, as with farmers or fisherman. Although UV irradiation is injurious to many cellular elements, the mechanisms underlying UV-mediated skin cancer are thought to be most likely related to DNA damage to cutaneous cells. Various types of UV-induced DNA damage have been identified, and they differ in biologic significance. Damage which is apt to be most cytotoxic is probably less effective as an inducer of skin cancer than is more subtle damage, which is tolerated but can initiate malignant transformation. Repair of DNA damage involves specific cellular activities which vary in their effectiveness in restoring cutaneous cell function to normal. Other biologic effects of UV irradiation may contribute to the development of skin cancer through effects on such defenses as pigmentation and the immune response. Sun-induced damage to DNA, however, is apparently necessary. Biologic consequences of dangerous environmental exposure to UV irradiation can be modulated by changes in life-style, the depth of the ozone layer, use of sunscreens, and possibly by hormones or their synthetic analogs.\r"

  ".W": "Two hypotheses have been presented. The first states that melanomas commonly evolve from normal melanocytes by a tumor progression pathway from a banal nevus to a nevus with dysplasia, to a micro-invasive, and then to a fully evolved, tumorigenic, primary melanoma which has competence for metastasis. It is important to note that not all melanomas follow this complete pathway. As Foulds noted long ago, tumors may bypass any of the stages of tumor progression. Thus, many melanomas do not, apparently, arise in nevi, and melanomas may evolve \"fully formed\" as pure tumorigenic nodules. However, from the biological point of view, study of the benign potential precursors (nevi and, especially, dysplastic nevi as well as microinvasive melanomas) may well reveal mechanisms of progression that are applicable to all melanomas, and perhaps to other solid tumors as well. From a clinical viewpoint, follow-up and education of patients at increased risk for melanoma, and early diagnosis of melanomas in their curable, microinvasive stages may result in a reduction of mortality from the disease, even without influencing its overall incidence. The melanomas that occur on plantar and palmar (acral) skin appear to progress through a microinvasive stage similar to that of other cutaneous melanomas. However, the significance of precursor and marker lesions (if any exist) in acral melanoma remains to be elucidated by clinicopathologic and epidemiologic studies. The possibility of etiologic agents other than UV light, such as chemical carcinogens and/or viruses, should be investigated in these cases. The second hypothesis presented here, that UV light is etiologic for the common cutaneous melanoma of white populations, has support from clinical, epidemiologic, and biologic observations. From a biologic viewpoint, ultraviolet light has all of the properties that might enable it to act as a complete carcinogen, and to enhance tumor progression in melanocytic \"potential-precursor\" lesions. Clinically, it seems appropriate to encourage patients (and members of the general population, as well) to adopt sensible attitudes to sun exposure. By such means, it is possible that some melanomas might be prevented, or that the rate and incidence of progression to more-advanced stages might be inhibited.\r"

Because the gamma-Sm (PSA) test seems likely to replace the PAP test in the area of urology and study of prostate-specific antigens is expanding, we have reviewed physicochemical properties and clinical significance of two prostate-specific antigens, gamma-Sm (PSA) and beta-microseminoprotein (beta-MSP). Both proteins have been proved to originate in the prostate gland and have not been detected in any other human tissues by an immunohistologic study. The usefulness of gamma-Sm and beta-MSP in determining the origin of metastatic tumors has also been shown. gamma-Sm is a glycoprotein with a molecular weight of 26,079 for the peptide portion, of which the amino acid sequence is identical to so-called PSA and homologous with serine proteases (the kallikrein family). Its chymotrypsin-like activity with a unique substrate specificity has also been demonstrated. The molecular weight of beta-MSP is 10,652 from the amino acid sequence, in which the protein has been shown to contain no alanine residue.\r"

Financial studies of graduate medical education have used the methods of cost allocation or joint-products cost analysis. Previous cost-allocation studies indicate that one third of family practice residency costs are met by extramural subsidy. Cost reports of eight California public hospitals with a single family practice residency program were evaluated for the 1984-85 fiscal year. Discrepancies in the education costs reported to Medicare and those reported in state hospital disclosure reports demonstrate the arbitrary nature of the cost-allocation method. The Medicare medical education reimbursement was an average of $20,444 per resident. State and federal grants provided an average of $5,190 per resident. The Medicare payments and grants met an average of 35.7% of the education costs reported to Medicare. A joint-products cost analysis was used to estimate the pure cost of education in an 18-resident family practice residency. Replacing the residency with salaried physicians would have decreased the hospital's net return by $143,534. If neither grants nor Medicare education payments had been received, elimination of the program would have increased hospital net return by $428,083.\r"

  ".W": "We evaluated, in a multi-center trial, the safety and efficacy of GR 38032F (GR-C507/75), a novel and selective serotonin antagonist, in preventing acute emesis in chemotherapy-naive patients receiving treatment with regimens containing high-dose cisplatin (greater than or equal to 100 mg/m2). Eighty-five patients were randomized to receive GR 38032F, 0.18 mg/kg, either every six or every eight hours for three doses, beginning 30 minutes before cisplatin. Patients were evaluated for emetic episodes (vomiting or retching) over a 24-hour period following cisplatin. All patients were evaluable for toxicity and 83 were evaluable for efficacy. The overall antiemetic response rate was 75% (55% complete response [CR], 20% major response). No difference in antiemetic control between the two administration schedules was noted. Patients with histories of heavy ethanol use had significantly better antiemetic control (74% CR) than modest or non-drinkers (33% CR). Toxicity of GR 38032F was modest and independent of administration schedule. The most common adverse events included mild hepatic transaminase elevations, self-limited diarrhea, dry mouth, headache, and mild sedation. Our data indicate that GR 38032F is a safe and effective agent in the control of acute cisplatin-induced nausea and vomiting. Additional trials exploring dosing, schedule, and comparison to standard antiemetic agents are indicated.\r"

  ".W": "One hundred eight patients with recurrent or metastatic transitional cell carcinoma of the urothelial tract were randomized to receive cisplatin (C) 80 mg/m2 on day 1 every 4 weeks, or methotrexate (M) 50 mg/m2 on days 1 and 15 plus C 80 mg/m2 on day 2 every 4 weeks (C + M). Fifty-three eligible patients were randomized to C + M and 55 to C. In the C + M arm, 45% of patients responded (complete response [CR], 9%) and 31% (CR, 9%) in the C arm (P = .18). In the C arm, 20 patients failing or relapsing after C received M. Two patients responded, and four with progressive disease (PD) and one with a previous partial response (PR) showed no change. The median survival was 8.7 months (C + M arm) and 7.2 months (C arm), P = .7. Relapse-free survival was not significantly different, but C + M was associated with a significantly increased time to disease progression (median, 5.0 months, v 2.8 months for C arm). The response of untreated patients (37%) was not different from those with prior treatment (39%). On the C + M arm, 92% of patients and 96% of patients on the C arm received 85% or more of the scheduled C dose. Significantly more grade 3 or 4 hematological toxicity (27% v 2%; P = .01) and mucositis (20% v 0%; P = .0005) occurred in patients on the C + M arm. Although the initial response rates seen on the combination arm look superior, and the time to disease progression is increased, these effects have not translated into a clinically important increase in the duration of survival and were associated with increased toxicity.\r"

  ".W": "Peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) forms a morphologically heterogeneous group of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL) with distinct immunophenotypes of mature T cells. Progress has been slow in defining specific clinicopathological entities to this particular group of NHL. In order to elucidate the specific characteristics of PTCL, a direct comparison of PTCL with a group of diffuse B-cell lymphomas (DBCL) was performed. Between June 1983 and December 1987, we studied 114 adults with NHL, using a battery of immunophenotyping markers. Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma, lymphoblastic lymphoma, mycosis fungoides/Sezary syndrome, follicular lymphoma, well-differentiated lymphocytic lymphoma, and true histiocytic lymphoma were excluded from this study since these are distinct clinicopathologic entities with well-recognized immunophenotypes. Of the remaining 75 patients, 70 who had adequate clinical information were analyzed, and of these, 34 were PTCL and 36 were DBCL. Classified according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Working Formulation (WF), 68% of PTCL and 31% of DBCL were high-grade lymphomas. Clinical and laboratory features were similar, except PTCL had a characteristic skin involvement and tended to present in more advanced stages with more constitutional symptoms. Induction chemotherapy was homogeneous in both groups, and complete remission rates were 62% for PTCL and 67% for DBCL. Patients with DBCL had a better overall survival than patients with PTCL, but the survival benefit disappeared after patients were stratified according to intermediate- or high-grade lymphoma. A subgroup of PTCL patients who had received less intensive induction chemotherapy was found to have a very unfavorable outcome. We conclude that (1) PTCL follows the general grading concept proposed in WF classification; (2) within a given intermediate or high grade, PTCL and DBCL respond comparably to treatment; (3) the intensity of induction chemotherapy has a crucial impact on the outcome of PTCL patients; and (4) with a few exceptions, the clinical and laboratory features of PTCL and DBCL are comparable.\r"

  ".U": "89235696\r", 
  ".W": "Thirty-two children ranging in age from 1.5 to 16 years with poor-prognosis acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) were treated with myeloablative immunosuppressive therapy consisting of cyclophosphamide (CPM) and total body irradiation (TBI) followed by allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) while in first complete remission (CR). The main reasons for assignment to BMT were WBC count greater than 100,000/microL, structural chromosomal abnormalities, and resistance to initial induction therapy. All children were transplanted with marrow from histocompatible siblings. Twenty-seven patients are alive in first CR for 7 to 82 months post-transplantation (median, 30 months). The actuarial disease-free survival rate is 84.4% (confidence interval, 7.2% to 29%) and the actuarial relapse rate is 3.5% (confidence interval, 0.9% to 13%). Four patients died of transplant-related complications, 16 developed low-grade acute graft-v-host disease (GVHD), and six developed chronic GVHD. The very low incidence of relapse (one of 28 long-term survivors) precluded the determination of the prognostic significance of the different poor-outcome features. Moreover, two infants treated with busulfan, CPM, and cytarabine (Ara-C) relapsed promptly in the marrow. In summary, as a means of providing long-term disease-free survival and possible cure, BMT should be considered for children with ALL presenting poor-prognostic features, particularly certain chromosomal translocations [t(4;11), t(9;22)], very high WBC counts, notably if associated with a non-T immunophenotype, and, perhaps, a poor response to initial therapy with corticosteroids (CS), or infants less than 6 months of age.\r"

The pretreatment characteristics needed for the calculation of the PI are the Karnofsky index, the site of metastases expressed as the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage, the size of residual tumor, the Broders' grade, and the presence of ascites. In the subgroup comprising the 10% of the patients with the best prognosis, 4-year survival was 75%, whereas all of the patients in the subgroup comprising the 10% with the poorest prognosis died within 4 years, which illustrates the large variability of the prognosis among patients. The PI was found to retain its value after response was achieved. The information provided by the PI can be expected to be useful in treatment planning and for proper stratification of patients in clinical trials.\r"

While its mechanisms of action and pharmacology are incompletely understood, tamoxifen appears to act predominantly by blocking the action of estrogen by binding to the estrogen receptor. Clinical trials of tamoxifen for 1 to 2 years in primary breast cancer demonstrate consistent beneficial effects on disease-free survival, but only suggested beneficial effects on survival. Routine use of adjuvant tamoxifen for 5 years or more will depend on the results of ongoing large clinical trials of efficacy and detailed studies of unknown biological effects on other tissues.\r"

Review of the supporting evidence indicates that it is not based on sound scientific data but on unscientific and unsubstantiated allegations. There is no evidence of a congenital, developmental, or inherited weakness of the vessel wall. The most plausible explanation is that the aneurysms are acquired degenerative lesions--the effect of hemodynamic stress. The mural atrophy leading to aneurysmal dilatation is an acquired lesion which can be produced experimentally by hemodynamics alone. Hypertension and connective tissue disorders associated with acquired loss of tensile strength of the connective tissues are not essential: they appear to be aggravating rather than causal factors. Occlusion of one or more feeding vessels may enhance the possibility of aneurysm formation at large arterial forks subjected to the augmented hemodynamic stress associated with collateral flow.\r"

All patients fulfilled strict entry criteria; 78 patients underwent open discectomy and 73 were subjected to chemonucleolysis. An increase in radicular pain immediately after treatment was encountered in 16 patients (22%) in the chemonucleolysis group, as compared to none in the discectomy group. The efficacy of discectomy appeared to be definitely superior to that of chemonucleolysis. Within a follow-up period of 1 year, 18 patients (25%) required open discectomy following failed chemonucleolysis; two patients (3%) in the discectomy group needed a second operation. Open discectomy following previous chemonucleolysis was successful in only 44% of cases. Comparison of the final results of the two modes of treatment 12 months after the last intervention (including second treatment) did not reveal any significant differences. The duration of the preoperative symptoms, the level of disc herniation, and the leakage of contrast medium out of the disc appeared to be of no relevance to the final outcome. The complication rates in both treatment groups were low.\r"

Visual and quantitative evaluation of the three radioisotope methods before ACE inhibition already disclosed abnormalities suggestive of renal artery stenosis in a high percentage (87%, 60%, and 60%, respectively) in this group of patients, but ACE inhibition further improved the diagnostic yield in all three methods (93%, 86%, and 80%). Iodine-123 hippurate renography was at least as useful as [99mTc]DTPA renography in this respect, while [99mTc]DMSA scintigraphy can be used particularly in segmental stenosis. Despite a large drop in blood pressure after ACE inhibition little adverse reactions were seen and overall renal function was fairly well maintained, the exceptions noted in patients with initially a more impaired renal function.\r"

Overall, 34/37 patients were diagnosed by the provocative test as having at least one renal artery affected by a stenosis greater than 50%. Of those with no stenosis (n = 55) or stenosis less than 50% (n = 13) only two cases were falsely positive. Thus sensitivity was 92% and specificity 97%. For single kidney identification with stenosis greater than 50%, sensitivity of renal scintigraphy after Captopril administration was 94% and specificity 98%. Captopril enhanced renal scintigraphy is thus suggested as the first test to be performed in hypertensive patients referred for renal scintigraphic studies. Only those cases with equivocal results require a baseline study for better assessment.\r"

The infants were enrolled by age 5 days and randomly assigned to receive parenterally administered, and later orally administered, free alpha-tocopherol (vitamin E) or its placebo. Study medication was continued until retinal vascularization was complete or active ROP had subsided, except in infants with a diagnosis of severe disease, in whom vitamin E was substituted for study medication. Acute ROP data were collected on 755 infants. Logistic regression analysis, with control for immaturity, oxygen exposure, and other illness risk factors, showed a decrease in incidence of ROP in vitamin E-treated infants (p = 0.003, all infants; p = 0.035, infants weighing less than or equal to 1500 gm at birth). Among the 424 infants weighing less than or equal to 1500 gm at birth, the age at enrollment influenced treatment effect (age day 0 to 1, p = 0.006 (n = 288) vs age day 2 to 5, p greater than 0.1 (n = 136]. Overall, 77.6% of infants with ROP had mild disease. Moderate to severe ROP was confined to infants weighing greater than or equal to 1500 gm at birth (25 given placebo, 25 given vitamin E), with progression to severe disease in nine placebo-treated versus three vitamin E-treated infants (p = 0.048). The incidence of severe ROP per se was not significantly decreased (all birth weights, p = 0.086; less than or equal to 1500 gm birth weight, p = 0.080); the sample size was too small, however, to assess this end point adequately. An increased incidence of sepsis and late-onset necrotizing enterocolitis was found among vitamin E-treated infants weighing less than or equal to 1500 gm at birth who received study medication for greater than or equal to 8 days (p = 0.006). Because most ROP is mild in degree and regresses completely, the risk/benefit ratio of pharmacologic prophylaxis for ROP is unfavorable. Treatment of moderate and severe ROP with vitamin E above physiologic serum levels (greater than 3 mg/dl) appears promising and should be further investigated. The interpretation of cicatricial outcome was confounded by the small number of patients involved and by subsequent treatment of severe ROP in placebo-treated infants with vitamin E.\r"

  ".W": "We tested the hypothesis that a deuterium oxide (D2O) tracer could discriminate among patterns of clinically significant, imperfect compliance during drug trials. A model was developed to predict deuterium concentration during multiple dose regimens. After developing a regression equation to predict one of the model parameters for children, we selected healthy children (N = 20) at random to receive one of five 10-day D2O regimens. Five urine samples were obtained from each child during 15 days and analyzed for deuterium level by mass spectrometry. Each child's height, weight, age, and the first four urinary deuterium levels were used to estimate the amount and timing of deuterium administration. These estimates were compared with the five regimens to determine the closest match between estimate and regimen. The closest matching regimen was the regimen actually administered to 19 (95%) of the 20 children. Two of these children had D2O administration estimates that could be confused with another regimen. The correlation between the model's predicted levels and the measured levels of all urine samples was 0.96. We conclude that a D2O tracer shows excellent promise as a quantitative method of assessing compliance with liquid medications under specified conditions.\r"

Such immunogenic variants frequently express elevated class I major histocompatibility complex antigens relative to the level of expression in the parent tumor and are rejected in syngeneic mice by a T-cell-dependent process. To ascertain whether elevated immunogenicity is a function of increased class I antigen expression, we isolated high class I antigen expressors from 5-aza-treated 10.1 cells by using the fluorescence-activated cell sorter. Clonal variants displaying any increase in class I antigen expression were more efficient stimulators of allo-class I antigen-specific cytolytic T-cell precursors. However, these variants displayed unaltered tumorigenicity in immunocompetent syngeneic mice. Thus, phenotypic changes other than, or in addition to, elevated class I antigen expression cause the reduced tumorigenicity of immunogenic clones of 10.1 cells isolated after 5-aza treatment.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of estradiol and two synthetic progestins (ORG2058 and R5020) on the expression of the high-affinity, metastasis-associated laminin receptor in two human breast carcinoma cell lines were examined. The T47D cell line contains estrogen and progesterone receptors, but the MDA-MB 231 cell line lacks both receptors. Treatment of T47D cells with 10(-9) M estradiol alone results in a three-fold increase (P less than or equal to .05) in the steady-state level of laminin receptor mRNA determined by RNA blot analysis as well as in cell-surface, laminin receptor expression that is evaluated by immunofluorescence. No effects of estradiol on the receptor-negative MDA-MB 231 cells were observed. Untreated and steroid-treated MDA-MB 231 cells had higher levels of laminin receptor mRNA than did untreated or estradiol-treated T47D cells. A more dramatic increase (five-fold; P less than or equal to .005) of mRNA and cell-surface expression in T47D cells was observed after treatment with estradiol plus 10(-8) M progestin or with progestin alone. Estradiol treatment also increased chemotaxis and haptotaxis of T47D cells but not of MDA-MB 231 cells to laminin; it had no effect on the attachment of these latter cells to laminin. Interestingly, treatment with estradiol plus progestin or progestin alone significantly increased the attachment of T47D cells to laminin but did not have an effect on either haptotaxis or chemotaxis to laminin. These results suggest that the various cell-laminin interactions are mediated by different mechanisms. The augmentation of laminin receptor mRNA by estrogen and progesterone treatment in hormone receptor-positive cells, but not in cells that lack these receptors, may relate functionally to the difference in the clinical aggressiveness between classes of breast cancers.\r"

Blood is collected for determination of etretinate levels before treatment and then at 2, 4, 8, 16, and 24 weeks after randomization. The monitoring strategy was assessed by interim evaluation. There were 276 posttreatment samples available from 75 randomized subjects of whom 36 received etretinate and 39 placebo. The mean coefficient of variation for the internal standard retinyl acetate in serum was 4.16% for the high-pressure liquid chromatography method used. Among positive samples, the mean etretinate concentration was 25.7 ng/mL (SD, 23.4). Of the 131 samples obtained from subjects randomized to etretinate, 120 or 91.6% had detectable levels compared with 4 of 145 or 2.8% placebo samples. Among the 36 subjects given etretinate, at least one positive test occurred. In 27 of these 36 participants, etretinate was detected in every sample obtained. In the other nine, the absence of drug could be explained by pill counts or a history of discontinuation of treatment for six. Among the 39 subjects given placebo, the four positive samples were from four individuals, all of whom were negative on three other occasions. These data confirm the usefulness of the monitoring system we used and indicate that compliance and/or contamination will not be major problems in this trial.\r"

Osteoporosis was defined by atraumatic vertebral compression deformity. Ultrasound velocity averaged 1954 +/- 71 (+/- SD) m/s in premenopausal normal women and declined significantly with age after menopause, largely independently of age-related loss of spine bone mass. Postmenopausal osteoporotic women had lower velocities than normal women (-76 m/s). After allowing for slight differences in age between the groups, the difference (-54 m/s) was still significant. Women with velocities below 1825 m/s were about six times more likely to have one or more fractures than women with velocities about that level. By sensitivity-specificity analysis, ultrasound velocity discriminated between normal and osteoporotic women as well as direct measurement of spine bone mass. Ultrasound velocity measures both bone mass and a component of bone fragility distinct from decreased mass; it is a potentially valuable new tool for evaluating women for osteoporotic fragility.\r"

Fractional allelic loss, a measure of allelic deletions throughout the genome, and allelic deletions of specific chromosomal arms (the short arm of 17 and long arm of 18) each provided independent prognostic information by multivariate analysis when considered individually with Dukes' classification. Distant metastasis was significantly associated with high fractional allelic loss and with deletions of 17p and 18q. Mutations of ras proto-oncogenes and deletions of 5q had no prognostic importance. Statistically significant associations were also found between allelic losses and a family history of cancer, left-sided tumor location, and absence of extracellular tumor mucin. Allelic deletion analysis thus identified subsets of colorectal carcinoma with increased predilection for distant metastasis and cancer-related death. Further studies may define a subset of genetic alterations that can be used clinically to help assess prognosis.\r"

The theme of multiple-receptor subtypes with clinical relevance is highlighted by calcium antagonist and benzodiazepine receptors. Numerous drugs may exert therapeutic and untoward effects via calcium channels. Examples include effects of loperamide hydrochloride on diarrhea, the phenothiazine thioridazine hydrochloride on cardiac and ejaculatory function, and the neuromuscular toxicity of aminoglycosides. Elevated numbers of calcium antagonist receptors in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy may be involved in the pathophysiology of this disease. Benzodiazepines act via discrete central and peripheral receptors. At central receptors, benzodiazepines facilitate the inhibitory effects of the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid. Peripheral benzodiazepine receptors are localized to mitochondria and enriched in several endocrine glands where they are influenced by therapeutic blood levels of benzodiazepines such as diazepam.\r"

  ".W": "Medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) is an important human cancer for the study of molecular abnormalities that underlie initiation of neoplasia and subsequent cellular changes during tumor progression. This tumor can occur in different inherited forms, each mediated by autosomal dominant genetic events. Germline abnormalities on chromosome 10 are linked to at least one type of genetic MTC, multiple endocrine neoplasia type II. Our studies of chromosome 10 in DNA from MTC tumors failed to detect frequent loss of polymorphic DNA markers, suggesting that the genetic mechanisms involved in MTC development may be different from those for other inherited cancers such as retinoblastoma. During tumor progression of MTC, abnormalities develop in expression of the mature phenotype of the endocrine cell from which the tumor arises. In cell culture, chemical modulation or gene insertion can lead to partial correction of these defects in differentiation capacity by activating cellular signaling processes. These studies offer opportunities to dissect the molecular events that regulate endocrine cell differentiation, to determine the precise abnormalities that may underlie the initiation and tumor progression events in MTC and related cancers, and, thereby, to identify new targets for therapeutic intervention.\r"

It is a complicated field, however, which has seen attempts to protect the brain using a single therapy such as barbiturates ultimately disappoint investigators in the field. It is likely that much more work needs to be done in understanding the intracellular metabolic and biochemical effects of ischemia before therapies can be designed that are likely to be effective. This work might ultimately require knowledge of how ischemia or hypoxia interrupt cellular RNA and DNA machinery before these effective therapies can be developed. Before we are discouraged by the difficulty of the task, however, it is useful to review how much progress has been made in understanding the pathophysiology of ischemic brain injury in the past decade, so that we may be challenged to continue our efforts in this exciting area of critical care medicine.\r"

The exercise group was superior to the control group in watts, exercise time, maximum expired volume per unit time, and maximum oxygen consumption. No untoward events or loss of leg strength occurred as a result of the exercise regimen. We conclude that the aerobic training program employed in this study is a safe, short-term procedure and that patients with postpolio sequelae respond to training in a manner similar to healthy adults.\r"

Moreover, a causal relation between dietary fat and breast malignancy is biologically plausible. Negative findings from recent analytic epidemiologic studies of dietary fat and breast cancer, however, have fueled the notion that the hypothesis is no longer viable. We argue that only limited conclusions should be drawn from epidemiologic studies to date because of the narrow range of dietary fat intake among subjects and the substantial measurement error in dietary assessment. Although many doubts remain about the dietary fat--breast cancer hypothesis, the question is of such importance that intensive efforts at designing better studies of the hypothesis are urgently needed. Such studies might include (1) laboratory investigations in humans that examine possible mechanisms for the effects of fat, (2) large, prospective epidemiologic studies, and (3) randomized, controlled diet trials.\r"

In order to estimate the cell cycle time in this study, the percent labeled mitosis curve was prepared with immunoperoxidase staining using monoclonal antibody to BrdU instead of 3[H]thymidine autoradiography. This technique was considered to be very useful because it can be done for a short term and can still be changed to the autoradiographic method. Comparing the results in this study with already reported data on various xenografts of human carcinomas in nude mice, the tumor doubling time (117.5 hr) and the cell cycle time (23.5 hr) were rather short, but the growth fraction (54%) and the cell loss factor (68%) were nearly equivalent to the median value. These findings suggest that the very rapid growth rate of this tumor was mainly due to the shortness of the cell cycle time.\r"

Clinical application of these variables to the prediction of future outcome requires an understanding of the definitions of risk. These definitions must then be applied appropriately when assessing risk. The definition of risk used must be explicitly stated and consistently used. Provided is a review of the definitions of risk and the risk of acquiring breast cancer according to age, family history, and histopathological characteristics of benign breast biopsies. The highly variable relative risk of dying from breast cancer when diagnosed is also reviewed.\r"

Eight patients underwent liver transplantation, five of whom survived and three of whom died. In addition, two patients died before undergoing transplantation. The survival rate of 62% was better than that among our previous series of similar patients. This improvement seems to be related to the use of orthotopic liver transplantation as a therapeutic alternative among these patients. One of the three patients who died after liver transplantation had normal liver function, but respiratory failure caused by Pneumocystis carinii developed 4 months after the transplantation. The surgical procedure was less difficult in patients with acute fulminant hepatitis than in those with chronic liver disease because fewer problems arose from adhesions, venous collaterals, and ascites. The emerging role of orthotopic liver transplantation in patients with acute hepatic failure is demonstrated by the improvement of survival rates observed by various groups, including ours, when this therapeutic modality is available.\r"

Orthotopic liver transplantation is an option for patients with end-stage liver disease associated with hepatitis B virus infection despite the risk of allograft reinfection. Passive immunoprophylaxis has been attempted perioperatively to prevent graft infection but has not been beneficial. Some patients with chronic type B hepatitis have benefited clinically from antiviral therapy and, in particular, interferon, but its use has not previously been reported as an approach to prevent allograft infection. We administered recombinant leukocyte A interferon perioperatively to a patient who underwent liver transplantation for type B chronic active hepatitis and cirrhosis. Circulating hepatitis B virus DNA was found postoperatively while the patient was receiving interferon, and stainable viral antigen subsequently reappeared in the transplanted liver. Thus, the drug failed to prevent viral replication and allograft infection. Thus far, no evidence of progression of the chronic hepatitis has been noted.\r"

The mean duration of stay in the ICU was 5.91 days after liver transplantation and 6.15 days for patients who subsequently required readmission to the ICU. During the immediate postoperative period, hypothermia and hyperglycemia invariably occurred. Later during the initial admission or on readmission to the ICU, there arose the possibility of infections and renal insufficiency. Prompt diagnosis and treatment are necessary for hypertension, hypokalemia, severe metabolic alkalosis, fever, altered mental status, oliguria, and signs of graft failure in liver transplant patients. In our patient series, selective bowel decontamination minimized the occurrence of gram-negative and fungal sepsis, and use of antihypertensive agents and correction of coagulopathies may have decreased the risk of intracranial bleeding in patients with hypertension and clotting defects. Anticipation of potential conditions postoperatively and early implementation of treatment are key factors in the successful ICU management of patients who have undergone liver transplantation.\r"

Only one death has occurred, and one patient has required retransplantation. Biochemical liver function tests showed median values in the normal range, except for mild elevation of serum gamma-glutamyltransferase. In patients with primary biliary cirrhosis, these test results were completely normal. A liver biopsy 1 year after transplantation disclosed normal histologic findings in 31 patients (67%). The other patients had either transient (acute rejection) or stable (chronic rejection) abnormalities, except for two patients with progressive graft dysfunction attributable to chronic rejection. A clinically significant vascular anastomotic abnormality was noted in one patient who had hepatic artery thrombosis. Late bile duct complications occurred in 15% of patients, all of whom had a satisfactory outcome after surgical or radiologic intervention. Cyclosporine-related nephrotoxicity and hypertension each occurred in 67% of patients; however, conversion to a low-dose cyclosporine-azathioprine regimen yielded stabilization of renal function after the first postoperative year, and hypertension has been easily controlled medically. Diabetes necessitating insulin treatment developed in three patients. The body weight of the study patients had increased by a median of 6.5 kg at 1 year but stabilized thereafter. Subjective well-being and satisfaction with life were reported by 91% of the patients. Of the 46 patients, 26 were employed, 16 were homemakers, and only 4 did not work, 2 because of transplant-related medical problems. Thus, we conclude that liver transplantation rehabilitates patients with end-stage liver disease and enhances their quality of life.\r"

In 567 (21.9%) patients diagnostic and/or therapeutic surgery was done. Breast cancer was confirmed by histopathology in 429 (75.7%) of the patients operated on and a further 60(10.6%) had non-malignant pathological changes (eg, sclerosing adenosis, epitheliosis, fibroadenoma, or papilloma). Thus, surgery was justified in 86.3% (489) of the patients. In addition to the histopathologically verified cancers, another 22 (0.8%) breast cancers were diagnosed by mammography and cytology but these patients were not subjected to surgery for various reasons. A combination of mammography and SFNB offers a procedure of high sensitivity for early diagnosis of breast cancer.\r"

They were treated during both periods with regular insulin and with protamine (NPH) insulin. 18 subjects started with human and 14 with porcine insulin; the two insulin periods each lasted twelve weeks; the insulin doses were much the same in the two periods (mean 23 [SD 9] U daily NPH; 14 [7] U daily regular insulin), as were blood glucose profiles and HbA1c values. There were 171 episodes of hypoglycaemia during human and 150 episodes during porcine insulin. Patients completed questionnaires after each hypoglycaemic episodes and at the end of the trial. Hunger and sweating without concomitant neuroglycopenic symptoms were significantly more frequent as initial warning symptoms during porcine than during human insulin (41% vs 20%), whereas neuroglycopenic symptoms were more frequent during human insulin. At the end of the trial 18 of 32 subjects reported diminished awareness of hypoglycaemia during human insulin compared with 6 of 32 during porcine insulin. Hypoglycaemia developed faster during human than during porcine insulin administration. The transfer of IDDM subjects from porcine to human insulin seems to alter warning symptoms of low blood glucose concentration, with consequent impairment of its early recognition.\r"

ICA positivity conferred a relative risk of IDDM of 533 (95% CI 145-1955). In the 10 years of follow-up 4 of the 8 ICA-positive subjects became insulin dependent, whereas the probability of being free of IDDM was 99.9% for those who were ICA-negative at the start of the study. The findings suggest that, although chronic autoimmunity involving the pancreatic beta-cells may precede non-familial IDDM by many years, a positive ICA test on a single occasion predicts the development of IDDM in only 4 out of 8 subjects over a period of 10 years.\r"

Consequently, some centres recommend transplants only for patients for whom a poor response to chemotherapy is predicted. To assess how reasonable this strategy is, data from 704 recipients of HLA-identical sibling transplants for AML in first remission were analysed. 5-year leukaemia-free survival (LFS) was 48% (95% confidence interval 43-53%); leukaemia relapse rate was 20% (16-24%). Improved LFS was associated with younger age and lower white blood cell count at diagnosis. These prognostic variables are similar to those reported to affect outcome after chemotherapy. These findings suggest that a strategy of treatment assignment based on risk factor analysis is unlikely to resolve the controversy of transplant versus chemotherapy for AML in first remission.\r"

We counted the number and location of each skin lesion and found that patients had an average of 188 EM skin lesions at the time of their evaluation. We found the isomorphic phenomenon, that is, lesions appearing at sites of skin trauma, in 19 of the 22 study subjects; photodistribution of skin lesions in 15 of the 22, grouping of the lesions over the elbow and knees in 7 of the 22, and nailfold involvement in 7 of the 22. In this study there was compelling evidence for herpes simplex virus association with recurrent EM. All 22 patients had histories of herpes simplex virus infections preceding at least 1 of their previous episodes of EM. Sera from all study subjects had antibodies to HSV detectable by enzyme immunoassay. None, however, had HSV isolated from the throat at the time of the EM or from an EM skin lesion. All 11 patients who were subsequently tested had positive viral cultures for HSV taken from the suspected recurrent herpes lesion. When 8 EM skin biopsies were examined by indirect immunofluorescence with a monoclonal antibody to the type common HSV glycoprotein gB, all had positive staining of keratinocytes. Only one-third of patients with a single episode of EM had a history of possible herpes lesions preceding EM.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "\"Acute tubular necrosis\" (ATN) in the transplanted kidney, when properly differentiated from other causes of acute renal failure, appears to be a relatively benign condition. It has been widely assumed to be pathologically identical to ATN in the native kidney, but its histopathologic features have not been studied in detail. Because immunosuppressive therapy with cyclosporine adds an additional layer of complexity to the morphologic changes observed, in the present study we have confined our observations to patients immunosuppressed with steroids and azathioprine. Thirteen renal allograft biopsies from patients with ATN and 5 biopsies from patients with normal allograft function were compared with the previously obtained series of 57 native kidney ATN biopsies and 20 control biopsies. Both qualitative and quantitative differences between transplant and native kidney ATN were found. Compared with native kidney ATN, transplant ATN showed significantly less thinning and absence of proximal tubular brush border and less variation in size and shape of cells in individual tubular cross-sections. There were also significantly fewer casts and less dilatation of Bowman's space and a significantly greater number of polarizable crystals presumed to be oxalate in transplant ATN. In native kidney ATN the tubular injury sites were mostly characterized by desquamation of individual epithelial cells leaving areas of bare basement membrane (the \"non-replacement\" phenomenon). In transplant ATN, sites of tubular injury, although rare and affecting only short tubular segments, were characterized by the actual presence of identifiable necrotic tubular cells, a finding seldom seen in native kidney ATN. There also was a greater interstitial infiltrate of mononuclear inflammatory cells in transplant ATN compared to native kidney ATN. Electron microscopic studies of 9 transplant ATN biopsies showed a mild reduction in proximal tubular brush border compared with controls but this alteration was significantly less than that observed in native kidney ATN. There was no significant alteration in proximal or distal basolateral infoldings and this contrasted sharply with the marked reduction in basolateral infoldings of the plasma membrane observed in native kidney ATN. Disintegrated necrotic cells were found by electron microscopy in transplant ATN whereas these were not observed in native kidney ATN. There were significantly more cells with apoptosis (shrinkage necrosis) in transplant ATN than in native kidney ATN. There were significantly more cells with apoptosis (shrinkage necrosis) in transplant ATN than in native kidney ATN. On the other hand, there were significantly greater numbers of \"non-replacement\" sites in the distal tubules in native kidney ATN compared to transplant ATN.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

All had a history of recurrent aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis, lymphadenopathy, fever, and numerous infections during periods of neutropenia. Serial blood-cell counts, findings on bone marrow examination, and signs and symptoms were evaluated before and during the daily administration of G-CSF (3 to 10 micrograms per kilogram of body weight per day), either intravenously or subcutaneously. The kinetics of labeled autologous blood neutrophils and the migration of neutrophils to skin chambers were also measured. Recombinant human G-CSF increased the mean (+/- SEM) neutrophil counts from 717 +/- 171 per microliter to 9814 +/- 2198 per microliter (P = 0.009). In five of the six patients, the cycling of blood-cell counts continued, but the length of the period decreased from 21 to 14 days. The number of days of severe neutropenia was reduced (P = 0.002). Neutrophil turnover increased almost four-fold (P = 0.005), whereas neutrophil migration to a skin chamber was normal. G-CSF therapy reduced the frequency of oropharyngeal inflammation, fever, and infections in these patients. During the first 40 months of treatment, no typical mouth ulcers or bacterial infections occurred; recurrent gingivitis improved. We conclude that G-CSF is effective for the treatment of cyclic neutropenia in humans.\r"

  ".W": "Cytomegalovirus is a major viral pathogen in patients who undergo renal transplantation, and cytomegalovirus disease is difficult to treat. We therefore conducted a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial of acyclovir for the prevention of cytomegalovirus disease in recipients of renal allografts from cadavers. Acyclovir was given orally in doses of 800 to 3200 mg per day, according to the patients' estimated level of renal function. Patients took the first dose of either acyclovir or placebo six hours before transplantation and continued to take the assigned medication for 12 weeks. Of 118 patients enrolled in the study, 104 completed at least 30 days on the study medication and were included in our analysis of the results. During the first year after transplantation, 4 of 53 patients (7.5 percent) in the acyclovir group had symptomatic cytomegalovirus disease, as compared with 15 of 51 (29 percent) in the placebo group (P = 0.002). There was a single case of cytomegalovirus pneumonia in the acyclovir group, as compared with nine in the placebo group. The greatest prophylactic benefit of acyclovir was observed among seronegative patients who had received a kidney from a seropositive donor; only one of six such patients in the acyclovir group had cytomegalovirus disease, as compared with all seven in the placebo group. Acyclovir decreased the incidence of documented cytomegalovirus infection (with or without symptomatic disease) to 36 percent from 61 percent among the patients who received the placebo (P = 0.011). Among the patients who received acyclovir, the rates of recovery of virus from the blood and urine were significantly reduced, but the rate of viral shedding from the pharynx was not significantly different from that in the placebo group. There were no differences between the groups in the frequency of adverse events or in the rate of survival of either grafts or patients. We conclude that the oral administration of acyclovir, beginning before the transplantation of a renal allograft from a cadaver, reduces the rate of cytomegalovirus infection and disease without affecting the survival rate of either grafts or patients.\r"

  ".W": "In patients with Alzheimer's disease, amyloid fibrils that are aggregates of A4 protein subunits are deposited in the brain. A similar process occurs at an earlier age in persons with Down's syndrome. To investigate the deposition of amyloid in these diseases, we used a radioimmunoassay to measure levels of the amyloid precursor (PreA4) in the serum of 17 patients with Down's syndrome, 15 patients with Alzheimer's disease, and 33 normal elderly controls. The mean (+/- SD) concentration of serum PreA4 was increased 1.5-fold in patients with Down's syndrome (2.49 +/- 1.13 nmol per liter) as compared with that in controls (1.68 +/- 0.49 nmol per liter; P less than 0.007); the levels in patients with Alzheimer's disease were similar to those in controls (1.83 +/- 0.78; P less than 0.98). We also found that the concentration of PreA4 in the brain tissue of two adults with Down's syndrome (100 and 190 pmol per gram) was higher than that in the brain tissue of either 26 patients with Alzheimer's disease (64.4 +/- 17.3 pmol per gram) or 17 elderly controls with neurologic disease (68.5 +/- 26.3 pmol per gram). Immunocytochemical studies of brain tissue from 26 patients with Down's syndrome showed that the deposition of A4 protein amyloid began in these patients approximately 50 years earlier than it began in 127 normal aging subjects studied previously, although the rate of deposition was the same. We conclude that, since the gene for PreA4 is on the long arm of chromosome 21, which is present in triplicate in Down's syndrome, overexpression of this gene may lead to increased levels of PreA4 and amyloid deposition in Down's syndrome. However, since increased levels of PreA4 are not present in Alzheimer's disease, additional factors must account for the amyloid deposition in that disorder.\r"

  ".W": "Endemic pemphigus foliaceus, or fogo selvagem, is an autoimmune blistering skin disease caused by IgG autoantibodies to a desmosome-associated glycoprotein. We studied the IgG subclasses with autoantibody activity in serum from 29 patients with active disease and in the skin lesions of 18 patients by immunofluorescence, using IgG-subclass-specific monoclonal antibodies. The predominant disease autoantibodies present in all patients were of the IgG4 subclass. IgG1 and IgG2 autoantibodies were detected in low titer in the 29 patients: IgG1 in 23 patients and IgG2 in 9. IgG3 autoantibodies were not detected in the serum of any patient. Direct immunofluorescence testing of skin lesions showed a preferential deposition of IgG4 on the keratinocyte surface. The pathogenic effect of IgG4 was demonstrated by the passive transfer of fractions containing IgG4 autoantibodies from the patients to neonatal BALB/c mice. The disease of the patients was reproduced clinically, histologically, and immunologically in these animals. Only IgG4 autoantibodies were detected by direct immunofluorescence, bound to the epidermis in the lesions of the mice, and by immunoelectron microscopy at the keratinocyte surface. IgG4 has previously been reported to be a blocking or protective antibody because it has poor effector functions in vitro, as compared with the other IgG subclasses. The finding that it is the pathogenic autoantibody in fogo selvagem raises the possibility that it may also be important in other autoimmune disease.\r"

This sequestration is important for the survival of the parasite but may have severe consequences for the host. For example, it is involved in the causation of cerebral malaria which carries 25% mortality. Knob-like protrusions present on the surface of infected erythrocytes have been considered necessary but not sufficient for this cytoadherence. Here we describe the adhesion to endothelial cells of infected erythrocytes which do not have knobs. A human monoclonal antibody (33G2) which was specific for an epitope containing regularly spaced dimers of glutamic acid present in the repeated amino-acid sequences of some defined P. falciparum antigens was found to inhibit cyto-adherence and may therefore be an important reagent for elucidating the molecular basis of parasite sequestration.\r"

  ".W": "The repertoire of receptors expressed by peripheral T cells is the result of two selective events that occur during intrathymic development. Positive selection expands cells able to recognize foreign peptides presented by self MHC molecules, and negative selection eliminates cells reactive to self MHC molecules and associated self peptides. Chimaera studies suggest that, at least in the case of T cells recognizing MHC class II, interaction with thymic cortical epithelial cells is responsible for the former, whereas thymic medullary cells, of bone marrow origin, mediate the latter. This view of thymic development is supported by recent morphometric analyses, showing that autoreactive cells are found in thymic cortex but not medulla. Although numerous studies have shown that MHC class II molecules are expressed in both sites, none provides any explanation for the differential selection of T cells that is observed. Here, we describe a novel MHC class II epitope which is found on cells in thymic medulla but not cortex. The antibody to this epitope reacts with about 10% of class II molecules on B cells and may be recognizing a self peptide-MHC complex. These results provide the first evidence for differential expression of class II epitopes in different tissues and are compatible with the hypothesis that different ligands, rather than different affinity thresholds for the same ligand, are involved in positive and negative selection of the T-cell repertoire.\r"

They are genetically important as they define the ends of the linkage map. Telomeres of lower eukaryotes contain short repeats consisting of a G-rich and a C-rich strand, the G-rich strand running 5'-3' towards the telomere and extending at the end. Telomeres of human chromosomes share characteristics with those of lower eukaryotes including sequence similarity as detected by cross-hybridization. Telomeric repeats from many organisms can provide telomere function in yeast. Here we describe a modified yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) vector with only one telomere which we used to clone human telomeres by complementation in yeast. YACs containing human telomeres were identified by hydridization to an oligonucleotide of the trypanosome telomeric repeat. A subcloned human fragment from one such YAC is immediately subtelomeric on at least one human chromosome.\r"

  ".W": "Telomeres are the DNA sequences found at the ends of linear chromosomes. They define the boundaries of the genetical and physical maps of such chromosomes and so are particularly important for the complete mapping of large genomes that is now being attempted. Telomeres have been intensively studied in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and in ciliated protozoa: in these organisms the telomeric DNA consists of arrays of tandemly repeated short sequences in which one strand is guanosine-rich and oriented 5' to 3' towards the chromosome end. The conservation of these structural features is reflected in the observation that telomeric DNA from a variety of protozoa will function as telomeres on artificial linear mini-chromosomes in yeast. Tandem arrays of the sequence TTAGGG have been identified at the telomeres of humans and other mammals and also of trypanosomes. This indicates that the structural features of telomeres are conserved between higher and lower eukaryotes and implies that human telomeric DNA could function in yeast. I have used this idea to develop a strategy to isolate a specific human telomere as a molecular clone in yeast and have devised a simple and effective way of cloning other human telomeres and their associated sequences.\r"

  ".W": "A number of environmental and pharmacological stimuli capable of inducing phase shifts and/or period changes in the circadian clock of mammals have now been identified. Agents that can alter circadian clocks provide a means for investigating the cellular and neural mechanisms responsible for their generation, regulation and entrainment. Two stimuli that have been used to probe the basis of circadian rhythmicity are pulses of darkness on a background of constant light and injections of short-acting benzodiazepines, such as triazolam. Surprisingly, these two very different stimuli have remarkably similar phase-shifting effects on the circadian clock of hamsters. The observation that a short-term increase in locomotor activity occurs when the circadian activity rhythm of hamsters is shifted by dark pulses or triazolam injections, coupled with the finding that activity bouts themselves are capable of shifting this rhythm, raises the possibility that dark pulses or triazolam alter the circadian clock by inducing acute hyperactivity. Here we demonstrate that the phase-advancing and phase-delaying effects of dark pulses or triazolam on the circadian activity rhythm can be totally suppressed by immobilization of the animals during treatment. These results indicate that behavioural events mediate the phase-shifting effects of both dark pulses and triazolam on the circadian activity rhythm and question present hypotheses regarding the pathways by which light-dark information and pharmacological agents influence circadian pacemakers.\r"

Dystrophin is associated with the cytoplasmic face of muscle fibre membranes and its C-terminal domain is thought to mediate membrane attachment. Although N-terminal and central domain structures share common features with other cytoskeletal components, no significant sequence similarity between the C-terminal region of dystrophin and other previously characterized proteins has been described. Here we report that fragments from the C-terminal domain of the DMD complementary DNA detect a closely related sequence which exhibits nucleic-acid and predicted amino-acid identities with dystrophin of approximately 65 and 80%, respectively. The dystrophin-related sequence identifies a 13-kb transcript in human fetal muscle and maps to chromosome 6. Thus, dystrophin may be a member of a family of functionally related large structural proteins in muscle.\r"

Previous studies on tumour growth, however, have not revealed when or how the transition to an angiogenic state occurs during early tumour development. The advent of transgenic mice carrying oncogenes that reproducibly elicit tumours of specific cell types is providing a new format for studying multi-step tumorigenesis. In one of these models, transgenic mice expressing an oncogene in the beta-cells of the pancreatic islets heritably recapitulate a progression from normality to hyperplasia to neoplasia. We report here that angiogenic activity first appears in a subset of hyperplastic islets before the onset of tumour formation. A novel in vitro assay confirms that hyperplasia per se does not obligate angiogenesis. Rather, a few hyperplastic islets become angiogenic in vitro at a time when such islets are neovascularized in vivo and at a frequency that correlates closely with subsequent tumour incidence. These findings suggest that induction of angiogenesis is an important step in carcinogenesis.\r"

Although monocytic cells may provide a reservoir for virus production in vivo, their regulation of HIV transcription has not been defined. We now report that HIV gene expression in the monocyte lineage is regulated by NF-kappa B, the same transcription factor known to stimulate the HIV enhancer in activated T cells; however, control of NF-kappa B and HIV in monocytes differs from that observed in T cells. NF-kappa B-binding activity appears during the transition from promonocyte to monocyte in U937 cells induced to differentiate in vitro and is present constitutively in mature monocytes and macrophages. In a chronically infected promonocytic cell, U1, differentiation is associated with HIV-1 replication as well as NF-kappa B binding activity. These findings suggest that NF-kappa B binding activity is developmentally regulated in the monocyte lineage, and that it provides one signal for HIV activation in these cells.\r"

  ".W": "Mast cells have a central role in allergic diseases mediated by specific immunoglobulin E antibody responses to allergens. The binding of IgE to the high-affinity receptor for IgE (Fc epsilon R) on mast cells and basophils enables these cells to react specifically to allergens. Such contact leads to the activation of mast cells and the release of histamine and other pharmacological mediators, causing an immediate hypersensitivity and acute inflammatory reactions, accompanied by the development of allergic symptoms. Here we show that Fc epsilon R-mediated activation of murine mast cells results in the production of the haemopoietic growth factors granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and interleukin-3 (IL-3). IL-3 and GM-CSF, in addition to their role in bone marrow haemopoiesis, also influence inflammation as they have the capacity to recruit, prime and activate inflammatory cells such as neutrophils, macrophages and eosinophils. Secretion of these factors by mast cells in response to allergens may therefore have an important role in local tissue defense.\r"

  ".U": "89238588\r", 
  ".W": "The rat neu gene, which encodes a protein closely related to the epidermal growth factor receptor, is a proto-oncogene that can be converted into an oncogene by a point mutation. Both genes encode proteins with a relative molecular mass of 185,000 but the question of why the neu gene product, p185neu, is oncogenic, whereas the product of c-neu, p185c-neu, is not, remains unanswered. The proteins have several features common to the family of tyrosine kinase growth-factor receptors, including cysteine-rich external domains, a hydrophobic transmembrane region and a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase domain. The oncogenic p185neu differs from p185c-neu by an amino-acid substitution in the transmembrane region of the glycoprotein: this replacement of valine by glutamic acid at position 664 induces increased intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity which is associated with transformation. Many glycoproteins with charged amino acids in the transmembrane region exist as multimeric complexes at the plasma membrane. We have therefore investigated the association state of both products of the neu gene and show that the oncoprotein p185neu is organized at the plasma membrane primarily in an aggregated form, but that p185c-neu is not. Induction of an aggregated state may mimic aspects of ligand-induced receptor aggregation resulting in enzymatic activation that leads to cellular transformation.\r"

Aneurysm rupture, an arteriovenous malformation, or other vascular anomalies are suspected first. Preexisting unilateral hearing impairment is a valuable clue to differential diagnosis. Contrast-enhanced computed tomographic scans and cerebral angiograms are important tools for correct diagnosis. The tumor size (greater than 2 cm) and the thin, dilated vessels within the tumor are considered as pathogenetic factors for bleeding. When neurological status is not stable, placement of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt followed by urgent extirpation of the tumor is indicated.\r"

These include errors due to irregularity of food consumption, under- or overreporting of intake, errors in reporting either the amount or the description of the food consumed, recording errors on the part of the interviewer or coding errors on the part of the coder, limitations in the tables of food composition due to missing data for certain nutrients in certain foods or to biologic variability in the same foods from different sources or in those marketed under different conditions, imputed values, the unknown composition of formulated foods or foods prepared from home or commercial recipes, differences in bioavailability of nutrients as a function of the diet, or the use of abridged tables of food composition. In spite of the many unresolved issues relating to dietary standards and the interpretation of dietary intake data, we are still able to make a reasonable assessment of dietary adequacy of groups and individuals with our current system, which is viewed as a unique federal resource. It is hoped that the eventual passage of the National Nutrition Monitoring and Related Research Act will provide both the impetus and the resources to permit us to develop a more sophisticated system for assessing both food intake and nutritional status.\r"

At a dosage level of 5 mg elemental iron, hemoglobin iron was as well or better absorbed than ferrous salts in the normal subject. Absorption of hemoglobin iron increased less, however, in the iron-depleted or iron-deficient subject. In contrast to the absorption of ferrous salts, that of hemoglobin iron was not decreased by food or by phytate nor increased by ascorbic acid. The absorption of hemin iron was also not decreased by food. Iron absorbed from hemoglobin appeared in the plasma later than that from ferrous salts, but was found to be similarly dialyzable at acid pH with EDTA. These findings suggest that iron in heme complexes is absorbed as a porphyrin complex without conversion to the free ionized form. It is further apparent that there is less effective mucosal regulation of absorption of iron in this form. Finally, the present hypothesis of iron absorption based on the behavior of iron salts is not adequate for all types of food iron.\r"

Classic studies of overfeeding and underfeeding clearly showed that caloric deficit and surfeit conditions alter RMR. Recent work on short-term overfeeding of monozygotic twins provides new evidence that genetic factors influence individual sensitivity to changes in RMR and TEF when caloric excess is present. Exercise affects energy expenditure during nonactive times; acute bouts of vigorous exercise may result in increased RMR, and this effect appears most pronounced in the first 12 h after exercise. Acute exercise may potentiate the thermic effects of food when they are taken together, and high levels of exercise training may increase RMR. Thus, physical exercise appears to play an important role in the regulation of energy balance by way of its direct energy cost and its influence on RMR and TEF.\r"

Only the propositus' sister fulfilled the biochemical criteria for hypophosphatasia. Biochemical examination of an extracted tooth from this sister showed phosphate and alkaline phosphatase values that were 7 to 10 times lower than normal and reduced concentrations of the essential cofactors Zn++ and Co++. The spectrum of dental abnormalities is reviewed. This family study reveals that enamel hypoplasia, increased pulp spaces, and premature tooth loss are present not only in the deciduous but also in the permanent dentition.

TCl, a vital blue dye, selectively stains acid tissue components such as DNA and RNA and has been used for more than 20 years by surgeons to identify suspected cancerous lesions. It has not been routinely used by dentists to screen either general or high-risk populations. Sensitivity and specificity, as well as positive and negative predictive values for the TCl test, were calculated. Sensitivity of TCl ranged from 97.8% to 93.5%, and specificity ranged from 92.9% to 73.3%. It was determined that if TCl is used to screen high-risk populations, the likelihood of a false negative finding is extremely low, whereas false positive results will be relatively numerous. However, given the high sensitivity of the test, the absolute number of false positive tests will be small. Further analysis is needed to evaluate the economic costs of false positives and false negatives, versus the value of identifying true positives at an early stage.\r"

Two patients with severe combined immunodeficiency presented with cutaneous nodules in the absence of any local reaction at the site of BCG vaccination. Both patients died of disseminated BCG infection within the first year of life. Four patients with cellular immunodeficiency syndromes presented with regional lymphadenitis resistant to treatment after the fifth month of life. Three of these patients had specific unresponsiveness to tuberculin and survived from 5 to 6 years of age. Two boys with X-linked chronic granulomatous disease presented with regional lymphadenitis in the first 3 months of life.

  ".W": "The use of adrenocorticoids to reduce the morbidity associated with laryngotracheitis (croup) remains controversial despite ten published reports of randomized trials involving 1,286 patients. To determine whether, viewed in aggregate, these studies demonstrate a significant benefit of steroid treatment for this disorder, a meta-analysis of the nine methodologically satisfactory trials was performed. Clinical improvement 12 and 24 hours posttreatment and incidence of endotracheal intubation were evaluated. For each end point, an estimate of the overall effect was obtained by calculating a typical odds ratio and 95% confidence interval. This analysis indicates that the use of steroids in children hospitalized with croup is associated with a significantly increased proportion of patients showing clinical improvement 12 hours (odds ratio = 2.25, 95% confidence interval = 1.66, 3.06) and 24 hours (odds ratio = 3.19, 95% confidence interval = 1.70, 5.99) posttreatment and a significantly reduced incidence of endotracheal intubation (odds ratio = 0.21, 95% confidence interval = 0.05, 0.84). Higher initial doses of steroid (greater than or equal to 125 mg of cortisone or greater than or equal to 100 mg of hydrocortisone) were associated with a larger proportion of patients improved 12 hours posttreatment than was seen with lower doses. These results support the use of steroids in the treatment of hospitalized children with croup and, in the absence of a randomized clinical trial of sufficient size, provide the most reliable estimate of the impact of steroid therapy on the morbidity associated with croup. In addition, the results of this meta-analysis may be used to estimate the number of subjects who would be required to conduct a randomized clinical trial of steroids for the treatment of croup.\r"

During the past 6 years, several cases have been reported of patients in whom intracerebral hemorrhage developed, with and without concomitant angiographic evidence of vasculitis, after taking phenylpropanolamine. In this report, the 11th documented case of phenylpropanolamine-associated intracerebral hemorrhage with vasculitis is described. This is the first case in an adolescent following the ingestion of an overdose of diet-aid pills. Cases of intracerebral hemorrhage with vasculitis have also been described in users and abusers of amphetamine, methamphetamine, and ephedrine, all sympathomimetics with chemical structures similar to that of phenylpropanolamine. This report should alert pediatricians to the potential use by their patients of nonprescription medications containing phenylpropanolamine whenever unexplained acute cerebral symptoms are present.\r"

In this study, the use of computer-assisted instruction in improving knowledge and attitudes in favor of decreased teenage pregnancy is evaluated. Computer-assisted health education is an interactive process and simulates reality. Teenagers explore alternatives and outcomes, and experience consequences of behavioral choices. Two games were designed to promote understanding of the impact and cost of sexual behaviors and parenthood, as well as provide sexual survival skills. Educational evaluation in high schools showed improvements in knowledge and attitudes in these sensitive areas. Test instruments based on the content of each game were developed to assess the impact of the two interventions. Half of the 718 teenagers used the educational programs, and half served as matched control subjects who did not use computer games. Players rated the games highly and evaluated them positively. Measures of 19 factual and psychologic factors associated with pregnancy and parenting were separately made for control and experimental groups. Teenagers who played the games gained knowledge and positive attitude changes to a significantly greater extent than did the comparison group. \"The Baby Game!\" users increased their knowledge of costs of birth and of costs in money and time of child rearing. \"Romance!\" users would seek more professional help, had a better understanding of risk of pregnancy, learned more effective means of contraception, and had greater acceptance of oral contraceptives. Teachers and teenagers found the computer games acceptable and fun, and the games reduced counseling time in physician's offices. Computer-assisted instruction is a useful means of providing health education and a promising intervention for adolescent pregnancy.\r"

Conditioning involved high-dose cyclophosphamide treatment; three also had total body irradiation prior to bone marrow transplantation. Their respective outcomes after follow-up times of 28 months to 71 months posttransplantation are remarkable for normal somatic growth and normal development of intelligence, language, perception, and motor coordination. These findings indicate that future therapeutic studies of infants and young children with acute leukemia or aplastic anemia using total body irradiation, cyclophosphamide, and bone marrow transplantation are not contraindicated by risks of debilitating neurodevelopmental sequelae.\r"

Results of the watertight test demonstrated visible defects in 4.1% of vinyl and 2.7% in latex gloves. Twenty percent of latex gloves and 34% of vinyl gloves which had passed the watertight test allowed penetration of Serratia marcescens when worn by volunteers. A series of manipulations designed to simulate approximately 15 minutes of clinical activity in an intensive care unit resulted in failure rates as high as 66%. Using the dye penetration test, there was a statistically significant difference between vinyl and latex procedure gloves with full manipulations, with failure rates of 53% and 3%, respectively. Both types of gloves provided some barrier protection. However, latex gloves performed better when stressed.\r"

Fisher's Combined test procedure was used to combine the results of the independent studies, to determine if a significant relationship existed between pain management programs and children's response. An overall effect size (r) was also calculated. Significant relationships of small magnitude were found between pain management interventions and child's response for behavioral (r = .41, chi 2 = 181.97, p less than .0001), self-report (r = .34, chi 2 = 122.06, p less than .0001), and physiologic (r = .30, chi 2 = 88.29, p less than .0001) measures.\r"

Heartburn is the most common clinical manifestation. The history and barium esophagram provide sufficient diagnostic information in most cases. Other studies, including ambulatory pH monitoring, the Bernstein test, endoscopy with biopsy, and esophageal manometry, are warranted if the patient has atypical symptoms, an incomplete response to therapy, dysphagia, or abnormalities on the esophagram. Proper utilization of these studies requires an understanding of the questions each test answers. Reflux disease is often a chronic problem. Many patients can be treated symptomatically by a combination of life-style modifications and use of antacids. Patients who do not respond adequately to these simple measures or who have documented erosive esophagitis usually require further drug therapy.\r"

Chemical footprinting experiments have shown that the Ter protein binds to two 14- to 16-base-pair sequences that exist as inverted repeats in the tau fragment. Site-directed mutagenesis of one of the terminus sequences (tau R) resulted in a mutant tau R that failed to bind to the Ter protein. The same mutant terminus also failed to terminate DNA replication in vivo.

  ".W": "We have cloned a cDNA encoding a receptor identical to the native Mr 80,000 glycoprotein that binds interleukin (IL) 1 alpha and -beta in murine T cells. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells transfected with this T-cell IL-1 receptor (IL-1R) [CHO(IL-1R)] cDNA express approximately 100,000 IL-1Rs per cell, compared to the less than 100 receptors present on control CHO cells. For two functional responses to IL-1, prostaglandin synthesis and cytokine secretion, CHO(IL-1R) cells were 1000 times more sensitive to IL-1 alpha than were control CHO cells. Northern blot analysis and antibody precipitation demonstrated that one of the cytokines induced was granulocyte colony-stimulating factor and that mRNA levels for this cytokine were increased in CHO(IL-1R) cells by IL-1 alpha concentrations that had no effect on control cells. To establish the role of the recombinant receptors in signal transduction, an IL-1R cDNA modified by deletion of the predicted cytoplasmic domain was expressed in the CHO cell line termed CHO(IL-1R delta CT). CHO(IL-1R delta CT) cells expressed approximately 100,000 high-affinity IL-1 binding sites per cell, but these cells were less sensitive than control lines to IL-1, as measured by prostaglandin and cytokine release. These results show that the IL-1R cDNA encodes the entire functional receptor and that the cytoplasmic domain is required for signal transduction but not ligand binding.\r"

  ".W": "We describe an approach for investigating the protein folding process, using protein fragments as inhibitory probes of the refolding protein. The refolding of Escherichia coli dihydrofolate reductase (EC 1.5.1.3), reversibly unfolded in 7 M urea, was monitored by the reappearance of enzyme activity after diluting the unfolded enzyme into low urea concentrations (less than or equal to 2 M) in the presence of substrates. Of eight protein fragments produced by limited proteolysis of the 159-residue enzyme, three isolated peptides--Ser-49/Glu-90, Ile-91/Glu-154, and Gln-102/Glu-154--were evaluated for their effects on the recovery of the refolding protein's enzymatic activity. By this criterion, 13 microM peptide Gln-102/Glu-154 inhibits the refolding of 0.015 microM enzyme by approximately 80%, while the related peptide, Ile-91/Glu-154, and peptide Ser-49/Glu-90 at the same concentration inhibit the recoverable activity of the refolding enzyme by less than or equal to 20%. None of these three peptides has any significant effect on the activity of the folded enzyme. Our results indicate that peptides may inhibit refolding differentially and that these effects may be extremely sensitive to fragment sequence and composition. We suggest that peptide specificity in the inhibition of protein folding may be exploited as a structural probe of protein folding mechanisms.\r"

By utilizing transfection assay, Southern blot analysis, and DNA amplification techniques, we have detected an activated Ki-ras gene in the DNAs of both spontaneously occurring and chemically induced lung tumors of strain A mice. The point mutations in the spontaneous lung tumors were in both codon 12 (60%) and codon 61 (30%). In contrast, 100% of the mutations in the Ki-ras gene detected in methylnitrosourea-induced lung tumors and 93% of the mutations in the Ki-ras genes detected in benzo[a]pyrene-induced lung tumors were in codon 12, whereas 90% of the mutations in the Ki-ras genes detected in ethyl carbamate-induced lung tumors were in codon 61. The selectivity of mutations in the Ki-ras oncogene observed in chemically induced tumors, as compared to spontaneous tumors, suggests that these chemicals directly induce point mutations in the Ki-ras protooncogene. These data indicate that the strain A mouse lung tumor model is a very sensitive system to detect the ability of chemicals to activate the Ki-ras protooncogene in lung tissue.\r"

  ".W": "Changes in subunit interaction energies linked to the allosteric transition of the regulatory enzyme aspartate transcarbamoylase (ATCase; EC 2.1.3.2) from Escherichia coli are localized in part at interfaces between the six catalytic (c) and six regulatory (r) polypeptide chains. Site-directed mutagenesis has been used to construct enzymes with amino acid substitutions in a limited region of the zinc-binding domain of the r chains. Substitution of Ser or His for r114 Cys, one of four cysteines binding the structural zinc ion in the regulatory chain, leads to incorrectly folded chains as shown by the inability to detect stable assembled holoenzyme in cell extracts. Replacement of r111 Asn by Ala at the interface between an r chain and a c chain in the apposing catalytic trimer causes a complete loss of the homotropic and heterotropic effects characteristic of wild-type ATCase. Moreover, sedimentation velocity experiments demonstrated that this mutant enzyme exists in the R (\"relaxed\") conformation in the absence of active site ligands due to preferential destabilization of the T (\"taut\") conformation relative to the R state. In contrast, replacement of r113 Asn by Ala at the interface between adjacent r and c chains leads to an increase in the cooperativity of the enzyme. When r139 Lys is replaced by Met, Vmax is reduced by 50% compared to wild-type ATCase, whereas it is increased about 2-fold when r142 Glu is replaced by Asp. Amino acid substitutions in this domain significantly affect subunit interaction energy as measured by rate of subunit exchange when holoenzymes are incubated with isolated catalytic subunits, thus permitting measurements of the effect of the bisubstrate analog N-(phosphonacetyl)-L-asparatate in weakening intersubunit interactions. Subunit exchange increased about 9-fold for the r142 Glu----Asp mutant and almost 20-fold for the r142 Glu----Ala mutant in the presence of the ligand.\r"

For the overproduction of the VIRD proteins in Escherichia coli a tac-virD operon fusion was constructed. A significant increase in the accumulation of VIRD proteins was observed in a lon protease-deficient E. coli host. The presence of an overlapping open reading frame (ORF) upstream of the VIRD1 coding sequence had a negative effect on VIRD1 production. A preparation containing VIRD proteins catalyzes the conversion of supercoiled (form I) DNA to relaxed (form IV) DNA. This activity is similar to that of a DNA topoisomerase. The relaxation activity lacks DNA sequence specificity, requires magnesium ion, and has no requirement for an energy source. Studies with plasmids that had lost defined DNA segments encompassing various virD coding regions showed that VIRD1 is the DNA-relaxing enzyme. In a density gradient centrifugation experiment, the DNA-relaxing activity sedimented as a 21-kDa polypeptide. Earlier studies of Jayaswal et al. [Jayaswal, R., Veluthambi, K., Gelvin, S. & Slightom, J. (1987) (J. Bacteriol. 169, 5035-5045] have shown that in E. coli VIRD2 alone is not sufficient for endonucleolytic cleavage of T-DNA and requires VIRD1 for its activity.\r"

In the first of these, one of the strands of the helix exists in the bulge loop, and the other strand exists in the terminal loop of a previously recognized compound helix involving positions 500-545. Therefore, the new structure formally represents a pseudoknot. In the second, the insertion/deletion of a nucleotide in the vicinity of position 130 correlates with the length of the helix in the 180-195 region, the latter having a 3-base-pair stalk when the base in question is deleted and a stalk of approximately 10 pairs when it is inserted.\r"

Half-maximal effect of the Dk-(61-85) peptide on IR autophosphorylation is obtained at 1.2 microM, and almost complete inhibition of IR kinase activity is obtained at 10 microM peptide. The corresponding K kappa-(61-85) peptide has a significantly weaker effect on autophosphorylation. No such effects are observed with nine peptides of similar length, but unrelated to major histocompatibility complex class I antigens. Neither of the major histocompatibility complex class I-derived peptides has any effect on the constitutively active kinase of a genetically engineered cytoplasmic IR domain. Further, insulin binding to IR is unaltered in the presence of the major histocompatibility complex class I-derived peptides. The inhibitory activity of the peptides on insulin-induced IR phosphorylation facilitated the observation that IRs require insulin to become substrate for an independent tyrosine kinase. In the presence of an inhibitory peptide, the constitutively active cytoplasmic IR kinase domain only phosphorylates the intact IR in the presence of insulin. We conclude that the tyrosine kinase activity of IRs may be altered by peptide interaction at an allosteric site and, moreover, IRs require insulin to assume a conformation permitting phosphorylation by an independent kinase.\r"

The main protein constituent of these deposits is a 37-amino acid peptide known as amylin that resembles calcitonin gene-related peptide, a neuropeptide. We have isolated cDNA clones corresponding to the rat amylin precursor from an islet cDNA library and we show that this peptide is encoded in a 0.9-kilobase mRNA that is translated to yield a 93-amino acid precursor. The amylin peptide is bordered by dibasic residues, suggesting that it is proteolyzed like calcitonin gene-related peptide. The peptide sequences flanking the amylin sequence do not resemble the calcitonin gene-related peptide flanking sequences. RNA hybridization studies show that amylin mRNA is abundant in the islets of Langerhans but is not present in the brain or seven other tissues examined. Dietary changes, such as fasting or fasting and refeeding, have little effect on amylin mRNA expression. This tissue specificity suggests that amylin is involved in specific signaling pathways related to islet function.\r"

Other mAbs against ras-encoded proteins, including Y13-259, which efficiently detects ras proteins from a variety of organisms, did not recognize the platelet 22-kDa protein. Transfer of the platelet 22-kDa protein to nitrocellulose paper showed that the protein binds [alpha-32P]GTP. Moreover, preincubation of the transferred protein with mAb M90 drastically reduced its GTP-binding activity. Treatment of platelets with iloprost, a prostacyclin analog, caused (i) a time-dependent increase of a 24-kDa protein that is recognized by mAb M90 in particulate and cytosolic fractions and (ii) the gradual decrease of the 22-kDa protein from the particulate fraction. When platelets were labeled with 32P and then treated with iloprost, the 24-kDa protein was found to be phosphorylated. The 32P-labeled 24-kDa protein was specifically immunoprecipitated by mAb M90. These results suggest that appearance of the 24-kDa protein results from phosphorylation of the 22-kDa protein, which shifts its mobility to a higher molecular mass area.\r"

GT2 cDNA encodes a protein with 63% amino acid sequence identity and a similar structural organization to GT1. GT2 mRNA is found at high levels in mouse skeletal muscle, heart, and adipose tissue, all of which exhibit insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. GT2 mRNA is absent from 3T3-L1 preadipocytes but is induced dramatically during differentiation into adipocytes. This increase in mRNA content correlates closely with the acquisition of insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. We propose that GT2 is an insulin-regulated glucose transporter.\r"

Using the neu oncogene as a model system, we have developed several experimental approaches for the detection of such hypothetical ligands. The following lines of evidence collectively imply that a candidate ligand of the neu-encoded oncoprotein is secreted by ras-transformed fibroblasts: Medium conditioned by ras transformants is able to induce down-modulation of the neu-encoded p185 and to activate its intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity in vitro. In addition, a rapid increase in the phosphorylation in vivo of tyrosine residues of the neu-encoded protein is induced by the conditioned medium. Finally, transfer of the neu gene into hematopoietic cells renders them mitogenically responsive to the conditioned medium. The possibility of indirect activation of the oncoprotein through other known receptors, especially the receptor for the epidermal growth factor, was experimentally excluded.\r"

The beta 3-tubulin gene is expressed in the somatic and pharyngeal musculature, the dorsal vessel, and the visceral musculature. To learn more about the programs underlying mesodermal differentiation, we have started to dissect the regulatory elements of the beta 3-tubulin gene by means of P-element-mediated transformation experiments. We show that expression of the beta 3-tubulin gene in the somatic muscles, the pharyngeal muscles, and the dorsal vessel is mediated by far upstream sequences. We also demonstrate that the first intron of the beta 3-tubulin gene bears a tissue-specific enhancer element that is required for expression in the visceral muscles and that also functions efficiently when cloned downstream of an indicator gene. The separability of elements driving beta 3-tubulin expression in the somatic and visceral mesoderm facilitates the investigation of the different programs involved in regulating the early differentiation of this germ layer.\r"

To determine whether the plant enzyme could replace the endogenous SOD activities of Escherichia coli and yeast, constructions have been made in appropriate vectors for expression of the preprotein and the mature MnSOD. These were introduced into SOD-deficient strains for complementation studies. In E. coli, both forms of the protein were shown to be active and able to complement SOD deficiency to different degrees. Expression of the preprotein in a yeast strain lacking a mitochondrial MnSOD resulted in a restoration of wild-type growth, only possible if the plant protein was being targeted to the mitochondria. Subsequent studies revealed that the protein was processed and that the leader sequence was cleaved at the identical position as recognized by the mitochondrial peptidase of plants. The components mediating mitochondrial import thus appear to be highly conserved between plants and yeast.\r"

  ".W": "We have compared constitutional and tumor genotypes in nine cases of hereditary Wilms tumor (WT) and in three unrelated cases of familial adrenocortical carcinoma (ADCC). Since susceptibility to these tumors can be observed in malformation syndromes associated with a constitutional deletion of band 11p13 (WT) and with a constitutional duplication of band 11p15.5 (WT, ADCC), we investigated these two candidate regions by using 11p polymorphic markers. As expected, somatic chromosomal events, resulting in a loss of heterozygosity limited to region 11p15.5, were observed in the tumor of two familial cases of adrenocortical carcinoma. Surprisingly, however, analysis of the WT of two patients with a constitutional deletion of band 11p13, associated with aniridia, genitourinary abnormalities, and mental retardation (WAGR syndrome), revealed a loss of heterozygosity limited to region 11p15.5. These data therefore suggest that observation of a specific loss of heterozygosity may not necessarily point to the site of the initial germinal mutation. Together with previous similar observations of a loss of heterozygosity limited to 11p15.5 in breast cancer and in rhabdomyosarcoma, our data suggest that region 11p15.5 may carry a non-tissue-specific gene that could be involved in genetic predisposition, in tumor progression, or in both.\r"

  ".W": "Chromosomal translocations in Burkitt lymphoma and mouse plasmacytomas typically lie within or near the protooncogene MYC. In some instances, however, these tumors contain variant translocations with breakpoints located more distant from and downstream of MYC, in a domain commonly known as pvt-1. Until now, there has been no evidence that pvt-1 marks the location of a functional gene. Here we report the identification of a large transcriptional unit in human DNA that includes pvt-1. We have designated this unit as PVT. PVT begins 57 kilobase pairs downstream of MYC and occupies a minimum of 200 kilobase pairs of DNA. Some of the translocations that occur downstream of MYC in Burkitt lymphoma transect PVT; others lie between the two genes. None of the translocations we have studied appear to enhance transcription from an intact allele of PVT (indeed, they may inactivate that transcription), but some are associated with the production of abundant and anomalous 0.8- to 1.0-kilobase RNAs that contain the 5' exon of PVT and sequences transcribed from the constant region of an immunoglobulin gene (the reciprocal participant in the translocation). Identification of PVT should facilitate the exploration of how translocations downstream of MYC and insertions of retroviral DNA in the vicinity of pvt-1 might contribute to tumorigenesis.\r"

The katF gene product is also necessary for synthesis of HP-II. Mutations in either katF or xthA, but not katE, result in sensitivity to H2O2 and near-UV (300-400 nm) radiation. Exo III, encoded by the xthA locus, recognizes and removes nucleoside 5'-monophosphates near apurinic and apyrimidinic sites in damaged DNA. Extracts of katF mutant strains had little detectable exo III activity. When a katF+ plasmid was introduced into the katF mutant, exo III activity exceeded wild-type levels. We propose that the katF gene is a trans-acting positive regulator of exo III and HP-II enzymes, both of which are involved in cellular recovery from oxidative damage.\r"

  ".W": "In studying the changes that occur in concanavalin A-activated T lymphocytes, an mRNA species was discovered by hybridization of poly(A)+ mRNA with a human ferritin heavy chain cDNA probe. This ferritin mRNA, termed superheavy chain mRNA, differed from the known human ferritin heavy chain mRNAs by its larger size and degree of homology. The superheavy chain mRNA was isolated by sucrose-gradient centrifugation and translated in vitro in a cell-free system. The products obtained included two peptides (superheavy) of 43kDa that reacted with CM-H-9, a monoclonal antibody specific for placental isoferritin. De novo synthesis in intact transformed T cells revealed the synthesis of the superheavy chain peptides that were immunoprecipitated by anti-ferritin monoclonal antibody CM-G-8 and by placental isoferritin specific monoclonal antibody CM-H-9. The above results indicated that blast transformation of human T cells stimulated the appearance of a unique mRNA species that coded for a superheavy chain peptide associated with placental isoferritin, which was not detected in resting T cells.\r"

Murine CTLs that had been fixed with paraformaldehyde retained a slow cytotoxic activity toward various target cells that are also sensitive to another cytokine, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)/cachectin. This cytotoxic activity was neutralized by antibodies specific for TNF. Membrane fractions obtained from CTLs were cytotoxic to TNF-sensitive targets but not to several TNF-resistant cell lines. Immunoblot analysis revealed a membrane protein band of 50-60 kDa from CTLs that reacts with anti-TNF antibodies. The surface localization of this cytokine was further ascertained by flow cytometry, indirect immunofluorescence, and immunoelectron microscopy studies using TNF-specific antibodies. Radioiodination of CTL surface proteins followed by immunoprecipitation with anti-TNF antibodies confirmed the presence of a TNF-related cytokine in the plasma membranes of CTLs that migrated with an apparent molecular mass of 50-60 kDa under disulfide-reducing conditions. This cytokine can be removed from membranes by treatment with detergents but not with high-salt buffers, suggesting that it may be an integral membrane protein.\r"

  ".W": "Although all CD4+ cells theoretically are at risk for infection by human immunodeficiency viruses or the related simian immunodeficiency viruses found in Old World monkeys, only a small proportion of CD4+ lymphocytes from infected individuals have detectable virus. This suggests that immunodeficiency viruses may replicate predominantly in a minor subset or activated form of CD4+ T cells, a possibility we examined in macaques infected with a simian immunodeficiency virus isolate, SIV/Mne. Macaque CD4+ lymphocytes could be divided into two subtypes that differed in their level [high (hi) or low (lo)] of expression of a class of heterotypic adhesion receptors (HARs). In blood from animals infected with SIV/Mne, HARhi CD4+ T cells were lost selectively compared to HARlo CD4+ cells and, when cultured, exhibited 50-fold more recoverable reverse transcriptase activity. The HARhi CD4+ subset was also markedly more susceptible to productive infection following exposure to SIV/Mne in vitro. Both subsets are composed primarily of small resting lymphocytes. However, HARhi cells respond differentially to mitogenic stimulation and may thus be more likely to provide the cellular factors necessary to initiate or enhance virus replication. Thus, HAR expression may prove useful both as a prognostic indicator in immunodeficiency virus infection and as a tool to analyze pathogenesis of immunodeficiency viruses.\r"

In the BXSB or B/W mice, ABMT cured all aspects of autoimmune disease. Glomerular damage, revealed by histological study was dramatically improved. Serological abnormalities and immunologic functions also were normalized. Correction of autoimmune disease and advanced renal disease in BXSB and B/W mice regularly lasted greater than 5-6 mo and even 1 yr after ABMT. In the MRL/lpr mice, however, autoimmune and renal disease at first improved but then recurred after ABMT, apparently because of intolerance of mice for high doses of irradiation and a high degree of resistance of recipient stem cells to irradiation. In this model, H-2 typing revealed that by the time of relapse, immunocompetent cells of the chimeric mice had been replaced by host (MRL/lpr; H-2k) cells. B220+ Ly-1+ cells, present in increased numbers in untreated MRL/lpr mice, initially returned to normal levels after ABMT but then reappeared in the MRL/lpr mice that had received marrow from donors having few such lymphocytes. Thus, our results show that MRL/lpr mice possess abnormal radioresistant stem cells and provide impressive evidence that the origin of autoimmune diseases in this strain, as in the several other strains studied, residues in abnormalities present in stem cells.\r"

The effect was seen within 1 min at an ATA concentration of 10 microM in various T4+ cells (MT-4, U-937, peripheral blood lymphocytes, and monocytes). It was dose-dependent and reversible. ATA prevented the attachment of radiolabeled HIV-1 particles to MT-4 cells, which could be expected as the result of its specific binding to the HIV/CD4 receptor. Other HIV inhibitors such as suramin, fuchsin acid, azidothymidine, dextran sulfate, heparin, and pentosan polysulfate did not affect OKT4A/Leu-3a mAb binding to the CD4 receptor, although the sulfated polysaccharides suppressed HIV-1 adsorption to the cells at concentrations required for complete protection against HIV-1 cytopathogenicity. Thus, ATA is a selective marker molecule for the CD4 receptor. ATA also interfered with the staining of membrane-associated HIV-1 glycoprotein gp120 by a mAb against it. These unusual properties of a small molecule of nonimmunological origin may have important implications for the study of CD4/HIV/AIDS pathogenesis and possibly treatment.\r"

Carboxyl-terminal deletions of CD4 that do not affect HIV-1 gp120 binding eliminate recognition of CD4 by patient antisera. In contrast, mutations in the amino-terminal domain of CD4 that attenuate HIV-1 gp120 binding do not diminish CD4 recognition by patient antisera. These results suggest that HIV-1 infection can generate antibodies directed against a region of the viral receptor distinct from the virus-binding domain.\r"

To determine whether the X region does encode immortalizing functions, a fragment of the HTLV-I provirus capable of expressing known X-region proteins was inserted into the genome of a transformation-defective, replication-competent Herpesvirus saimiri. Infection of fresh mitogen-activated human cord blood and thymocytes yielded immortal T-cell lines that had the same phenotype (CD4+, CD5+, HLA class II+, interleukin 2 receptor alpha-chain +) as lymphocytes transformed by cocultivation with HTLV-I. These experiments demonstrate that the X region encodes the functions of HTLV-I that immortalize a distinct subpopulation of human T cells. The experiments also demonstrate the utility of the H. saimiri vector for the transduction of heterologous genes into human T cells.\r"

  ".W": "To study the role of the protooncogene c-myb in regulating myeloid leukemia cell proliferation and differentiation, we exposed cells of the human leukemia lines HL-60, ML-3, KG-1, and KG-1a to an oligodeoxynucleotide complementary to an 18-base-pair (bp) sequence of c-myb-encoded mRNA. This treatment resulted in a significant decrease in cell proliferation in all of the lines, which was most marked in HL-60 cells. After 5 days in culture, in several separate experiments with different oligomer preparations, 75% growth inhibition was observed in c-myb antisense treated cells in comparison to untreated HL-60 cells. Two c-myb antisense oligomers of identical length with either 2- or 4-bp mismatches had no effect on cell growth nor did an 18-bp c-myb sense or myeloperoxidase antisense oligomer. The effect of a c-myc antisense oligomer (18 bp) on the growth of HL-60, KG-1, and KG-1a cells was also studied. This oligomer had much less inhibitory effect on cell proliferation than did the c-myb antisense sequence. Interestingly, although c-myc antisense treatment induced maturation of HL-60 cells while it inhibited cell proliferation, such an effect was not noted in c-myb antisense treated cells. These studies indicate that the nuclear protein encoded by the c-myb protooncogene is required for maintenance of proliferation in certain leukemia cell lines. In compared to c-myc protein suggest that, at least in HL-60 cells, c-myc amplification or N-ras activation may not be sufficient to maintain the leukemic growth in the absence of c-myb protein. These findings support the hypothesis that development and maintenance of a malignant phenotype requires a multiplicity of interrelated genetic events.\r"

  ".W": "Cerebellar Purkinje neurons respond to glutamate and to the agonists quisqualate (QA) and kainate (KA) with prolonged, multiphasic, voltage-dependent depolarizations. In contrast, N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) at equivalent doses is not effective as an agonist for Purkinje neurons. The responses to QA and KA are reduced by extracellular Cd2+ (30 microM), by increased Mg2+ or Ca2+ (12 mM), and by the glutamate antagonist kynurenic acid (1 mM) but not by the NMDA-selective antagonist 2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate (100 microM). The short pressure application of 1 microM QA (less than or equal to 0.5 s) produces a response often exceeding 1 min in duration, which consists of several phases: rapid initial depolarization, followed by a long plateau, repolarization, and a subsequent small hyperpolarization. A similar response is evoked by glutamate and KA at higher doses (30-50 microM). The initial and plateau depolarizations are dependent on Na+, being reduced by substitution of external Na+ with sucrose or choline, but are not affected by the Na+ channel blocker tetrodotoxin. Rectification, observed at hyperpolarized potentials below -60 mV set by current clamp, is attributed in part to an intrinsic voltage sensitivity of the agonist-activated response. Both the duration and the magnitude of the excitatory responses were found to be voltage-dependent. Single-channel recordings of a Ca2+-sensitive K+ channel, activated selectively during the excitatory response, suggest that intracellular Ca2+ increases during the plateau phase. Certain properties of the excitatory responses in the Purkinje neuron resemble those associated with NMDA-receptor activation in other regions of the central nervous system, including voltage-sensitive rectification, blockade by divalent cations, and the induction of increased intracellular Ca2+ during the excitatory response. These unique properties may enable the Purkinje neuron to express both rapid and long-term effects of glutamatergic transmission with non-NMDA receptors alone.\r"

The beta II PKC immunoreactivity was widely but discretely distributed in the brain. The distribution of the beta II PKC immunoreactivity differed from that of the beta I and gamma PKC subspecies. The beta II PKC immunoreactivity was found in the perikarya, dendrites, and axons of neuronal cells. Few if any glial cells were stained. Immunoreactive neurons were present in the anterior olfactory nucleus, olfactory tubercle, amygdaloid complex, caudate-putamen, accumbens nucleus, claustrum, dorsal part of the lateral septal nucleus, CA1 region of the hippocampus, subiculum, medial habenular nucleus, cerebral cortex, nucleus of the spinal tract of the trigeminal nerve, nucleus of the solitary tract, and substantia gelatinosa of the spinal cord. In these neurons, the beta II PKC immunoreactivity was seen mainly in the form of cytoplasmic dots and, in some cases, diffusely in the cytoplasm. Under electron microscopy, these immunoreactive large dots appeared to be associated with the Golgi complex, suggesting that the beta II PKC plays a specialized function at the Golgi complex in certain neuronal cell types.\r"

  ".W": "A distinctive type of artifactual extravascular assignment of color was identified in 49 color Doppler ultrasound (US) examinations in 43 patients. This artifact appeared as a random localized mixture of red and blue assigned to perivascular soft tissues; the artifact varied with the cardiac cycle, being most prominent in systole and absent or less prominent in diastole. The artifact was seen in 26 patients (32 examinations) at an anastomotic site or stenotic lesion associated with surgically created arteriovenous fistulas for hemodialysis. It was also observed in ten patients with accidental iatrogenic arteriovenous fistulas (renal transplant [n = 6], femoral artery [n = 3], and iliac artery [n = 1]), five with stenotic arteries not associated with arteriovenous fistulas, and two with arterial aneurysms. The authors believe this artifact reflects perivascular tissue vibration caused by turbulent intravascular blood flow. If properly recognized and accurately interpreted, the artifact can be a valuable color Doppler US sign of underlying vascular abnormality.\r"

  ".W": "Core tissue for histologic study is believed by many pathologists to be more diagnostic than material from needle aspiration. Recently, a biopsy \"gun\" has been introduced, which simplifies core biopsies. With this device, 182 biopsies of multiple anatomic sites were performed with ultrasonic, computed tomographic, and fluoroscopic guidance and 18-gauge needles. High-quality histopathologic specimens were obtained in 177 of the biopsies, and diagnostic target tissue was obtained in 167. Only three significant complications occurred: one bleeding complication that required transfusion and two cases of pneumothorax that necessitated placement of chest tubes. The biopsy gun eliminated the disjointed movements of conventional \"skinny\" needle biopsies, and none of the samples demonstrated significant \"crush\" artifact or obscuring blood, problems that are commonly associated with manual biopsy techniques. Patient discomfort was decreased with this system compared with that of manual biopsies, and the total procedure time was reduced. Because of these distinct advantages, the authors now use the biopsy gun exclusively for all percutaneous biopsies and recommend that other institutions consider the use of this biopsy method.\r"

One renal abscess was misdiagnosed as a tumor at CT. US is not an adequate screening test for detecting lesions that may require invasive therapy. CT is more sensitive for the detection of acute renal inflammatory disease and for defining the extent of disease for planning of radiologic or surgical intervention.\r"

Three hundred fourteen duplex US studies in 162 patients with 150 episodes of renal allograft dysfunction within a 17-month period were reviewed. Histologic findings were available in 69 cases. Three patients had hyperacute rejection with a mean RI of 0.85 +/- 0.049. There were 37 episodes of acute rejection (mean RI, 0.76 +/- 0.054) and 22 instances of chronic rejection (mean RI, 0.71 +/- 0.065). Ureteral obstruction (nine cases; mean RI, 0.72 +/- 0.026) was the only cause of allograft dysfunction other than rejection with a mean RI greater than 0.70. Mean RI values associated with rejection were significantly elevated above those in the 88 cases of dysfunction without rejection (mean, 0.64 +/- 0.064) and in baseline examinations (mean, 0.63 +/- 0.066). The results identified two causes of increased RI values in addition to acute rejection: chronic rejection and ureteral obstruction.\r"

The results were confirmed by means of either surgery or percutaneous liver biopsy and compared with results of computed tomographic (CT) scanning, selective abdominal angiography, and abdominal ultrasound (US). For primary extrahepatic gastrinoma (intra-or extrapancreatic), MR imaging had a sensitivity of 20% and a specificity of 100%, with a positive predictive value of 100% and a negative predictive value of 11%. For metastatic gastrinoma in the liver, MR imaging had a sensitivity of 43% and a specificity of 100%, with a positive predictive value of 100% and a negative predictive value of 81%. The ability of MR imaging to depict extrahepatic gastrinomas was directly related to tumor size; no tumors smaller than 1 cm were detected, and 50% of tumors 3 cm or larger were detected. MR imaging was as effective as abdominal US but less effective than either CT scanning or selective abdominal angiography for the detection of extrahepatic gastrinoma. In seven patients with hepatic gastrinoma, three gastrinomas were detected with MR imaging and with abdominal US, while five were detected with CT scanning and with selective abdominal angiography. These results indicate that, at the present time, MR imaging is generally not useful in the initial attempt to localize gastrinomas.\r"

The inflamed portal vein may act as a conduit to the liver for bacteria, or it may become thrombosed and cause portal hypertension and hypersplenism. In one child, symptomatic portal hypertension developed 10 years after the initial disease. In children, an ultrasonic finding of a focal liver mass of low-to-mixed echogenicity or the presence of low-attenuation areas on computed tomographic scans should suggest the possibility of a hepatic abscess, and the radiologist has a major role in suggesting complicated inflammatory disease of the appendix as the cause. Similarly, when portal vein thrombosis or portal hypertension are found, the radiologist should consider complicated inflammatory disease of the appendix as the cause.\r"

These cases showed the spectrum of symptoms and characteristic radiologic features of this condition in both plain abdominal radiographs and barium studies. Plain radiographs of the abdomen may show an isolated loop of bowel containing an air-fluid level. The characteristic finding in barium studies of the small bowel is a localized dilatation of the small bowel lumen with afferent and efferent loops. In the absence of a complication or coexistent cause of obstruction, the transit time of contrast medium through the small bowel is not delayed. The radiologic examination is useful in diagnosis, and the condition is cured with surgery.\r"

A sensitive modification of the polymerase chain reaction method was used to provide unambiguous molecular evidence that a significant proportion of intravenous drug abusers are infected with HTLV, and the majority of these individuals are infected with HTLV-II rather than HTLV-I. Of 23 individuals confirmed by polymerase chain reaction analysis to be infected with HTLV, 21 were identified to be infected with HTLV-II, and 2 were infected with HTLV-I. Molecular identification of an HTLV-II--infected population provides an opportunity to investigate the pathogenicity of HTLV-II in humans.\r"

The overall sequence similarity is surprisingly low for enzymes catalyzing the same chemical reaction: three of them show limited amino acid sequence similarity to each other in two narrow regions, and the fourth enzyme is completely different. The diversity in primary structure together with different regional and cellular expression of the isozymes suggests that each isozyme has a defined function in processing the physiological response of different cell types to a variety of external stimuli and that each is regulated differently.\r"

Whereas ACH-2 cells produce infectious virions, U1 cells produce defective, noninfectious particles. Although 3'-azido-3'-deoxythimidine (AZT) prevented acute HIV infection of susceptible cells, it did not prevent the induction of HIV expression in the infected cell lines. In contrast, interferon alpha (IFN-alpha) inhibited the release of reverse transcriptase and viral antigens into the culture supernatant after phorbol ester stimulation of both cell lines. Further, IFN-alpha suppressed the production or release (or both) of whole HIV virions, but had no effect on the amount of cell-associated viral proteins. Also, after phorbol ester stimulation of ACH-2 cells, IFN-alpha reduced the number of infectious viral particles secreted into the culture supernatant, but had no effect on the infectivity of cell-associated virus. These findings lend support to the combined use of antiviral agents that have action at both the early (AZT) and the late (IFN-alpha) stages of HIV replication.\r"

DNA isolated from human fat tissue, when transfected into 3T3-C2 mouse cells, also gives rise to mouse transfectants that are induced to differentiate into adipocytes by the addition of insulin. Apparently, transfection of a trans-regulatory gene (or genes) from 3T3-F442A or human fat cells into 3T3-C2 cells is sufficient to commit 3T3-C2 cells to adipocyte differentiation.\r"

  ".W": "Augmented by public programs such as Social Security and Medicare, incomes of the elderly in the United States have grown more rapidly during the last several decades than have the incomes of other groups, so that on average the elderly are at least as well off as the nonelderly. Not all elderly, however, have done as well: widows, in particular, have high poverty rates. The economic prospects of the elderly during the next few decades are good because of the large work force from the baby-boom cohort. In the distant future a large fraction of the population will be elderly, which will probably lead to a deterioration in their economic status. Today, the main problems center on the distribution of economic resources among the elderly and on uncertainties such as costs of medical care.\r"

  ".U": "89242137\r", 
  ".W": "The intervening sequence of the ribosomal RNA precursor of Tetrahymena is a catalytic RNA molecule, or ribozyme. Acting as a sequence-specific endoribonuclease, it cleaves single-stranded RNA substrates with concomitant addition of guanosine. The chemistry of the reaction has now been studied by introduction of a single phosphorothioate in the substrate RNA at the cleavage site. Kinetic studies show no significant effect of this substitution on kcat (rate constant) or Km (Michaelis constant), providing evidence that some step other than the chemical step is rate-limiting. Product analysis reveals that the reaction proceeds with inversion of configuration at phosphorus, consistent with an in-line, SN2 (P) mechanism. Thus, the ribozyme reaction is in the same mechanistic category as the individual displacement reactions catalyzed by protein nucleotidyltransferases, phosphotransferases, and nucleases.\r"

  ".W": "The group I intron from Tetrahymena catalyzes phosphodiester transfer reactions on various RNA substrates. A modified RNA substrate with a phosphorothioate group in one stereoisomeric form at the site of reaction was synthesized in order to determine the stereochemical course of an RNA-catalyzed reaction. The reaction product was digested with a stereospecific nuclease to determine the configuration of the product phosphorothioate. The reaction occurs with inversion of configuration at phosphorus, implying an in-line pathway for the reaction.\r"
