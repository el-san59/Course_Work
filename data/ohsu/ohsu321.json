Unconjugated cholic acid will be secreted into bile, be absorbed from the intestine, and become the predominant bile acid in bile and plasma. Other bile acids will be esterified with glucuronate and secreted into bile, but undergo little enterohepatic circulation. Cholestasis will not be present; the bile acid pool will be diminished and lipid absorption, especially that of fat-soluble vitamins, will be impaired. A secretory diarrhoea may occur, caused by increased bile acid concentrations in the colon. Awareness of this possible syndrome should aid in its identification; oral administration of bile acids conjugated with glycine or taurine should correct the metabolic and clinical abnormalities.\r"

He was excreting Norwalk-like virus particles 48 hours after the illness. In addition, ill kitchen staff vomited in the kitchen area and may have contaminated surfaces and stored foods. It is recommended that food handlers should be regarded as potentially infectious until at least 48 hours after clinical recovery from viral gastroenteritis. Stored foods that may have been contaminated should be immediately discarded and areas of the work place which may have been affected should be identified and decontaminated.\r"

Infant feeding categories were: breast feeding (BF) greater than 6 months; BF less than or equal to 6 months; and artificial feeding (AF, or exclusive non-human milk feeding). Compared with BF greater than 6 months, a raised risk for total cancers was found in both BF less than or equal to 6 month and AF groups.

  ".W": "Before December, 1986, all public human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) testing in Oregon was done confidentially (using names). In December, clients were offered the option of either anonymous or confidential services. As judged by questionnaire responses, the availability of anonymity increased overall demand for testing by 50%: 125% for homosexual/bisexual (gay) men, 56% for female prostitutes, 17% for intravenous drug users, and 32% for other clients. The number of gay clients who had tests increased from a mean of 42 per month during the 4 months before anonymity was available to 108 per month during the 4 months after, whereas, at public sites in Colorado or California and private sites in Oregon, the number of gay clients tested did not increase. Twice as many seropositive persons were identified during the 3 1/2 months after anonymity became available (n = 85) as in the 3 1/2 months before (n = 36). Thus, availability of anonymous HIV testing and counselling drew gay men who had not sought services under a confidential testing system.\r"

With escalation of this situation a point may be reached at which the infant, because of the constraint of his stomach capacity, is unable to consume sufficient calories at a feed, since foremilk is lower in calories than hindmilk. The result will be symptoms of hunger (crying, fretfulness) and maybe even failure to thrive. The low fat content of the diet may cause rapid gastric emptying. This in turn may lead to lactose reaching the small bowel in concentrations that may tax the infant's lactase potential, with resulting diarrhoea. A simple change in breastfeeding patterns may alleviate some instances of undernutrition or diarrhoea.\r"

Antibiotic prophylaxis consisting of agents specific for anaerobes combined with broad-spectrum agents that provide coverage for other well-recognized pathogens should be an effective combination regimen for this group of patients. We conducted a prospective, randomized study comparing the efficacy of prophylaxis using combination of metronidazole and cefazolin-designated group A, to prophylaxis using cefazolin alone-group B, for patients undergoing oncologic procedures of the head and neck. The rate of wound infection in the cefazolin-metronidazole group (158 patients) was 9.5%, compared with 18.6% in the cefazolin group (172 patients) (p = 0.03). Patients undergoing clean procedures had a 4.9% infection rate overall, compared with 17.9% for clean-contaminated procedures, and 33.3% for contaminated procedures. The average length of hospitalization was 20.7 days for patients who developed infections, compared with 8.9 days for patients without infection. Anaerobic organisms were cultured in 12 of 26 patients, ten of whom did not receive metronidazole. The lower rate of wound infection among patients who received metronidazole suggests that anaerobic organisms are an important source of wound infection in head and neck oncologic surgery. Chemoprophylaxis for these patients should, therefore, include specific anaerobic coverage in addition to the broad-spectrum agents that cover the more familiar aerobic organisms.\r"

Jannetta has proposed vascular compression of the eighth nerve as the etiology of hearing loss, tinnitus, and vertigo in some patients. The case that follows illustrates a clear-cut example of vestibular symptoms arising from vascular compression of the eighth nerve. The patient involved had disabling peripheral vertigo refractory to medical management. Magnetic resonance imaging documented a tortuous basilar artery compressing the eighth nerve on the involved side. This was confirmed at surgery, and a selective section of the vestibular nerve provided complete relief of disabling symptoms and preservation of hearing. The authors describe the details of this case and the enigma of eighth nerve symptoms due to vascular compression.\r"

Four cases required diagnostic confirmation with electron microscopy or histochemistry. The tongue accounted for more than one third of the cases. Three lesions exhibited locally aggressive behavior, but none of the tumors metastasized. Initial treatment was wide local excision in all but one case; recurrence was noted in two cases. Fine-needle aspiration can be used to provide preoperative diagnosis of granular cell tumors. Wide local excision with histologically confirmed clear margins provides definitive treatment.\r"

Measurements were then made of the proximity of bone removal to several vital structures including the optic nerve, carotid artery siphon, cavernous sinus, and frontal lobe dura. Entrance into the sphenoid sinus was found to be routine. Adequate decompression requires maximum removal of bone at the orbital apex and incision of the periorbita without damage to the adjacent vital structures. This requires; 1. knowledge of ethmoid and sphenoid sinus anatomy and recognition of anatomic variations, 2. removal of bone under direct visualization, and 3. incisions of the periorbita be made most posteriorly first to prevent prolapse of orbital fat anteriorly which obscures vision of the critical orbital apex periorbita.\r"

  ".W": "Current techniques for ossicular reconstruction include ossicular autografts and homografts, and plastic and ceramic prostheses. Experimental testing of ceramic materials has led to the development of a nonporous, bioactive form of glass ceramic (Ceravital) for tympanoplastic reconstruction. To determine the clinical usefulness of these implants, Ceravital ossicular reconstructions were evaluated in 37 patients treated at the University of Michigan Medical Center during an 18-month period. Thirty-two patients (86%) with chronic ear disease underwent Ceravital ossicular reconstruction with tympanoplasty with or without mastoidectomy. Five other patients (14%) underwent ossicular reconstruction--2 for congenital anomalies, 2 for temporal bone trauma, and 1 patient for glomus tympanicum removal. Patient follow-up ranged from 2.2 to 3.8 years, with a mean follow-up period of 2.9 years. Prosthesis extrusion occurred in one case (3%). Mean preoperative and postoperative (2-year) pure tone air-bone gaps were 41.6 dB and 21.3 dB, respectively. Hearing was improved in 35 of 37 patients (95%). Postoperative pure tone air-bone gap was closed to 20 dB or less in 23 patients (62%). Hearing gains were greater with partial rather than total reconstructions (p = 0.14) and significantly greater with intact canal wall rather than canal wall down tympanoplasties (p less than 0.05). Initial results obtained with the Ceravital ossicular prosthesis compare favorably with those obtained using other methods of alloplastic reconstruction. These preliminary data suggest that Ceravital is an effective alternative prosthetic material for ossicular reconstruction.\r"

A series of cases requiring laryngotracheal reconstruction following severe burns to the head and neck region is reported. Methods of treatment are discussed as well as modifications of standard burn therapy to decrease the incidence of severe scarring.\r"

Superselective embolization, a highly successful technique for the management of head and neck vascular lesions, was used to effectively control an obstinate laryngotracheal hemangioma. Superselective embolization appears to provide yet another viable therapeutic option in the management of laryngeal hemangiomas.\r"

Vertigo was completely controlled in all but two of 31 patients, one of whom required revision surgery to control attacks. Analysis of these two cases suggests that the cause of persistent vertigo is incomplete neurectomy. With our current surgical technique in patients with Meniere's disease, hearing results were not statistically different from our results with surgery of the endolymphatic sac. Control of vertigo was much more successful with the RVN than endolymphatic sac surgery.\r"

  ".W": "Delayed endolymphatic hydrops is a disease entity that can be differentiated from Meniere's disease. This condition was first reported simultaneously by Nadol, et al. and Wolfson and Leiberman, with further clarification by Schuknecht. The disease is characterized by a profound sensorineural hearing loss in one ear, with the onset of episodic vertigo from that ear after a prolonged period of time (ipsilateral delayed endolymphatic hydrops) or the development of fluctuating hearing loss and/or episodic vertigo in the opposite ear after a prolonged period of time (contralateral delayed endolymphatic hydrops). This paper is a review of 15 cases of delayed endolymphatic hydrops, eight ipsilateral and seven contralateral. The results of this study indicate that surgical treatment for the ipsilateral form of the disease gave the best results. For the contralateral variant, it appears that medical measures should be the therapy of choice resorting, in the event of their failure, to conservative surgical intervention on what may be the only hearing ear to preserve hearing and control vertigo.\r"

Until recently, operative procedures, including unilateral arytenoidectomy, were recommended for the relief of such obstruction. Because arytenoidectomy adversely affects voice quality, alternative procedures designed to open the airway by restoring vocal cord mobility have been attempted with some success. We report our experience with six consecutive patients, five of whom had previously required tracheotomy for relief of airway obstruction from posterior glottic stenosis. In all patients, the operative procedure included a midline thyrotomy, excision of the posterior commissure scar tissue, and stenting. Vocal cord motion returned to normal or near normal in all six patients, and all have been decannulated. Subjective evaluation of voice quality was the same or improved postoperatively. Our experience suggests that restoration of an adequate airway in patients with posterior glottic stenosis can be achieved without sacrificing an arytenoid cartilage and voice quality.\r"

Choosing the appropriate method for stenting requires considering consistency of stenosis, altered anatomy, size, location, and stability of grafts when used for surgical repair and host tissue healing factors. Possible stents that can be used include endotracheal tubes, Silastic sheet rolls, Montgomery T-tubes, and laryngeal stents. This study investigates the effectiveness of the Aboulker stent, an increasingly popular stent for use in children. Indications and associated technical considerations for using the stent in 18 cases are reviewed. Postoperative care and follow-up, directed against infection and towards securing the stent in its original location, and management of complications are discussed.\r"

Mycobacterial cervical lymphadenitis, or scrofula, remains a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge because it mimics other pathologic processes, and because of the inconsistent reliability of physical and laboratory findings. Twenty-five cases of scrofula were treated at our institution from 1973 to 1986. Positive chest x-ray was exhibited by five (20%) patients. Histologic examination of the excisional biopsy was the most reliable test with 100% positive specimens. This study emphasizes the marked variability in clinical presentation of scrofula and the importance of surgical excisional biopsy for histologic diagnosis.\r"

All patients reported had baseline normal hearing. Hearing levels were measured prior to each course of chemotherapy. Audiological monitoring included conventional assessment of pure tone sensitivity at 500 to 8,000 Hz and assessment of ultra high frequencies (9,000 to 20,000 Hz). After one to two doses, 100% of patients failed to respond at 9,000 Hz and above. In the 2,000 to 8,000 Hz range, repeated administration of the drug effected successively lower frequencies with progressive loss, until a maximum threshold shift or plateau was reached at each frequency between 3,000 and 8,000 Hz. The plateau for cisplatin ototoxicity appears to fall within the moderate hearing loss range (40 to 60 dB HL) in the high frequencies. All patients complained of tinnitus and difficulty understanding speech in the presence of background noise. The pattern of pure tone audiometric alteration is consistent in all patients, all dosages, and each method of administration. The ultra high frequency alteration is prompt and dramatic.\r"

Cisplatin-induced toxicity in albino and pigmented guinea pigs was evaluated morphologically and functionally, using light and transmission electron microscopy as well as auditory brainstem-evoked potentials on the organ of Corti and the stria vascularis. The results showed variability in hearing thresholds, ranging from no change to hearing loss of 30 dB, and prominent damage in the organ of Corti and in the stria vascularis. The toxic effects to both the organ of Corti and the stria vascularis should be considered when cisplatin is used in chemotherapy.\r"

CT scan, and more recently, NMR have proved to be of value in choosing the surgical approach. In view of the usual point of departure, a combined neurosurgical and transfacial approach seems to be a satisfactory approach for obtaining oncological control of the lesion. The role of chemotherapy is discussed. The main prognostic factors seem to be the size of the lesion, the intracranial extension, and the lymph node involvement.\r"

A significant increase in error was observed with the OLP approach (22.9%) if responses could not be monitored oscilloscopically, a common situation in patients with severe degeneration. In a final study, however, a previously unreported factor was found to significantly reduce test error: recording electrode size.

Multisystem involvement was manifested in one case by testicular hypoplasia, early cataract formation, and borderline glucose intolerance. Prolonged dimpling of these large rear-limb muscles was elicited by percussion. Myotonic discharges were identified by electromyography. Percussion dimpling and the typical myotonic discharges persisted after neuromuscular blockade. Distinctive histologic muscle changes included ring fibers, sarcoplasmic mass formation, variation in fiber diameter size, and internally positioned nuclei.\r"

Five of the patients had normal fiber density, 9 had a normal jitter study, and further 7 had a normal mean interspike interval. However only one had all the parameters normal. The paraspinal and intercostal muscles at the apex of the scoliotic curvature examined in some of the patients showed similar abnormalities.

The dependency of the outcome of the test on type-specific size differences is rather small. Moreover, a method is given to correct for this bias.

  ".W": "The clinical significance of myoadenylate deaminase (MAD) deficiency and its mode of inheritance is still questioned. There were 36 relatives of 9 unrelated MAD deficient patients who were examined with the aid of a standardized ischemic forearm test: 8 new cases of MAD deficiency were detected, 5 of which were confirmed histochemically and biochemically. Obligate heterozygotes showed a normal ammonia production and MAD staining, but the mean activity of the enzyme was significantly less than in a group of controls. The results obtained from the family study strongly suggest an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance. However, only 2 of the 8 newly found MAD deficient individuals complained of exertional myalgia, whereas the remaining 6 were without any symptoms or complaints. This finding casts doubt on the clinical significance of MAD deficiency and the relationship of the deficiency state with exertional myalgia.\r"

We describe a computer model to investigate possible causes of this phenomenon. Effects of the range of conduction velocity in a nerve and the size of the constituent action potentials forming the recorded response are evaluated. We conclude that the broader duration of the motor unit potential is the predominant factor in accounting for motor nerve responses showing less change over distance than sensory responses. The contributions of temporal dispersion and phase cancellation are also discussed.\r"

Repeatability of each signal was studied. The AMG had a relationship to the torque which was more quadratic than linear, whereas that of the EMG was more linear. The coefficient of variability of residuals about a \"best-fit\" line was 8.55% for torque-increasing EMG recordings and 19.2% for torque-increasing AMG recordings. At the same torque, the EMG was on average about 10% greater for increasing-torque recordings than for decreasing-torque parts of the recordings, but the magnitude of the AMG signal was about 10% less. With repeated testing on the same day, the coefficient of variability of the signal/torque relationship (torque-increasing) was 9% for EMG and 23% for AMG signals. With long-term testing over 2 weeks these coefficients were 23 and 39%, respectively. Correlation analysis showed that the two signal/torque relationships varied independently of each other.\r"

In infancy, exacerbations of the symptoms occurred during febrile illness, but thereafter the clinical course was stable and the children appeared to be only slightly handicapped. Biopsies were taken from the intercostal muscle in both patients. Microelectrode studies revealed small Mepp amplitudes. Light microscopy demonstrated predominance of type I fibers and focal type-grouping. There was a lowered cholinesterase activity and frequent branching of preterminal axons. Electron microscopy revealed that there were few, if any, folds of the postsynaptic membrane and that there were no signs of degeneration. Methods for localization of acetylcholine receptors (AChR) revealed a deficiency and altered distribution of AChRs at these postsynaptic membranes and the occurrence of extrajunctional AChRs in some muscle fibers. It is concluded that the syndrome is a clinicopathological entity, characterized morphologically by a congenital paucity of secondary synaptic clefts (CPSC syndrome).\r"

These transmission abnormalities shown by motor unit action potential (MUAP) instability in size and shape with repetitive discharges occurs in postpolio patients who are and who are not complaining of progressive muscle weakness. Although some reinnervated MUAPs do seem to stabilize their neuromuscular transmission with time in mildly affected muscles, the question arises as to whether or not some MUAPs ever stabilize after polio. Two cases of acute polio personally followed by the author, one over a 9 1/2 year period, are presented. In both cases, in muscles where there are more deinnervated muscle fibers than could possibly be reinnervated, the MUAPs have remained unstable. New concepts of function in the reinnervated motor unit following polio are presented.\r"

Electrophysiological tests indicated myasthenia gravis of facial muscles and changes consistent with an asymmetrical motor neuropathy as a cause of the muscle atrophy. Both conditions occurred as complications of a locally invasive thymoma, and both failed to improve after surgery and radiation but substantially improved with subsequent treatment by corticosteroids, azathioprine, and plasmapheresis. Review of the literature disclosed that several neuromuscular conditions may be associated with thymoma, the commonest being myasthenia gravis. Muscle atrophy may occur in 10% of patients who have myasthenia gravis, whether associated with or without thymoma. Its mechanism is debated, and further studies are needed, but observations in our patient suggest the atrophy is due to a motor neuropathy. Primary treatment of the thymoma by surgery, irradiation if the tumor is invasive, and immunosuppressive therapy for neuromuscular complications offers a relatively good prognosis for this group of patients.\r"

No therapy has been proved to be curative for this process. Recent reports have suggested that interferon may cure or dramatically control airway papillomatosis. We evaluated the efficacy of human leukocyte interferon in the treatment of respiratory papillomatosis. One hundred twenty-three patients were randomly assigned to receive treatment with either surgery plus interferon or surgery alone. Interferon (2 X 10(6) IU per square meter of body-surface area) was given daily for one week, then three times per week for one year; treatment was followed by a year of observation, without the drug. Both study groups underwent serial endoscopy to remove papillomas and to document the efficacy of treatment during the two years of study. During the first six months, the growth rate of papillomas in the interferon group was significantly lower than in the control group (P = 0.0007). This difference diminished during the second six months and was no longer statistically significant (P = 0.68). Our data do not show that interferon is either curative or of substantial value as an adjunctive agent in the long-term management of recurrent respiratory papillomatosis. The initial benefit of interferon is not sustained.\r"

The separate contribution of social, as opposed to vocal, stimulation has been difficult to address, however, because in almost all cases both tutor and pupil sing. The opportunity to isolate such effects arose in cowbirds (Molothrus ater ater) after discovering that males housed with non-singing female cowbirds made vocal changes which related directly to the female preferences for native song. Here we report how females communicate with males about songs. We describe a visual display by females, a wing stroke, that is elicited by specific vocalizations. The songs that trigger wing strokes are in turn highly effective releasers of copulatory postures, and thus this previously unnoticed female display has biological significance. The data not only provide the first evidence of the tutorial role of male-female interactions during song ontogeny, they also clearly implicate visual stimulation in song learning, a process that has until now been assumed to be affected only by auditory information.\r"

Although direct excitation of LGNd relay neurons has been shown in vitro, the situation is complicated because cholinergic axons form numerous and complex synapses not only with relay cells, but also with inhibitory interneurons, and electrical activation of the brainstem cholinergic neurons reduces inhibitory postsynaptic potentials in the LGNd. We report here that morphologically characterized interneurons in the cat LGNd possess distinctive electrophysiological properties in comparison with those of relay cells and are inhibited by ACh through a muscarinic receptor-mediated increase in potassium conductance. Together the direct excitation of relay cells and inhibition of intrageniculate interneurons allow the ascending cholinergic system to exert a powerful facilitatory influence over the transfer of visual information to the cerebral cortex.\r"

We report the assignment of the gene mutation for this disorder to chromosome 9p22-CEN by genetic linkage to an anonymous DNA marker MCT112 and the interferon-beta gene probe. In contrast to the clinical variation seen for the disorder, no evidence of genetic heterogeneity is observed.\r"

It is considered to replicate via a rolling-circle mechanism in which circular, monomeric plus and minus RNAs act as templates for the synthesis of longer-than-unit-length precursor RNAs. Processing of these RNAs in vivo may occur by a self-cleavage reaction, as indicated by ability of dimeric, linear plus and minus ASBV RNAs to specifically self-cleave in vitro with the excision of a monomeric RNA with 5'-hydroxyl and 2',3'-cyclic phosphodiester termini. A similar self-cleavage reaction has also been reported to occur in an RNA transcript containing a dimeric copy of a tandemly repeated, 330-base-pair sequence of the newt genome. Based on comparisons with self-cleaving plant viral satellite RNAs, hammerhead-shaped active structures, each containing one self-cleavage site, were proposed for the plus and minus ASBV RNAs and the newt RNA, but the stability of these hammerheads has been questioned. Here, more stable active structures that contain two self-cleavage sites are proposed and data supporting these models are presented.\r"

The signals in question are those delivered by hormones to their cell-surface receptors that activate PI-PLC by means of a guanine nucleotide binding protein. Activation of the enzyme leads to the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate to two second messengers, 1,2-diacylglycerol and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, the second of which ultimately mobilizes internal pools of calcium. There are at least five PI-PLC isoenzymes, whose differences in structure and function are unknown. We have focused on isoenzyme I, which we have recently purified and characterized from guinea pig uterus. We have now determined the sequence of a full length complementary DNA of this isoenzyme from the rat. Although the sequence has little similarity with the only other sequenced PI-PLC isoenzyme, it has a surprising degree of similarity to thioredoxins, protein co-factors in thiol-dependent redox reactions.\r"

In the first study, performance on a battery of cognitive tasks by 12 subjects with myasthenia gravis is compared with that of ten healthy control subjects and ten medical control subjects with chronic disease of a nonneurologic nature. The tests used were the Boston Naming Test, Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (AVLT), and the Logical Memory and Design Reproduction portions of the Wechsler Memory Scale (WMS). Results indicate that the myasthenic group was significantly impaired relative to both the medical and healthy control groups for performance on the Boston Naming Test, WMS Logical Memory, and WMS Design Reproduction. Both the myasthenic and the medical control groups were impaired relative to the healthy controls on the AVLT. In the second study, a myasthenic patient had plasmapheresis for treatment of her myasthenia on two separate occasions. Her memory was examined prior to as well as following each series of plasma exchanges with a variation of the Peterson-Peterson consonant trigram task. Results showed that this patient had significantly fewer interference effects and less rapid forgetting following plasmapheresis. The results of these two studies support the hypothesis that myasthenia gravis has central cholinergic effects manifested by cognitive dysfunction.\r"

Patients with mental retardation benefited less frequently (5/10 improved), but 4/4 from this group with ictal falls associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome did benefit.

However, an alternate (but not mutually exclusive) interpretation is that the patients are either strongly attracted to or impaired in disengaging from the stimuli occupying the other, non-neglected hemispace. We tested ten patients with neglect on two versions of a cancellation test. In the control test they cancelled lines by drawing over them, and in the experimental test they erased lines. There were significantly more omissions in the drawing-over task than in the erasing task. The improved performance when lines were cancelled by removal instead of by marking them suggests that hemispatial neglect is influenced by the presence of stimuli in the non-neglected hemispace.\r"

Over a 17-year period we found CPM in 10 (7%) of the 139 burn patients examined postmortem but in only 10 (0.28%) of the 3,528 patients in the general autopsy population (p less than 0.001). Each of the burn patients with CPM had suffered a prolonged, nonterminal episode of extreme serum hyperosmolality, whereas most burn patients without CPM had not suffered such an episode. The histologic age of the lesions correlated with the duration of time between the hyperosmolar episode and death. Hypernatremia, hyperglycemia, and azotemia, alone or combined, accounted for the hyperosmolality. No single electrolyte or metabolic derangement was essential, as in at least one burn patient with CPM the serum sodium, glucose, or blood urea nitrogen was normal during the hyperosmolar episode. Hyponatremia was not present in any burn patient with CPM. We conclude that severely burned patients, like alcoholics, are especially susceptible to CPM, and that in burn patients with CPM there is a striking association with serum hyperosmolality. The data also suggest that the rapid correction of hyponatremia exerts its effects by causing an osmotic shift and not because of any specific property of the sodium ion.\r"

We ascertained altogether 42 cases of Parkinson's disease occurring in 41 twin including 18 monozygotic pairs, 14 dizygotic pairs, and nine pairs of undetermined zygosity. Only one dizygotic pair was concordant for Parkinson's disease; all other pairs were discordant. In 1981, the expected number of cases among the Twin Cohort, calculated according to the age- and sex-specific prevalence rates of Parkinson's disease in Finland, was 33. At the same time, the observed number of patients alive was 35. This study, further substantiating the low concordance for Parkinson's disease in monozygotic as well as in dizygotic twins and indicating that the prevalence of Parkinson's disease in twins compares with the prevalence in the general population, suggests that Parkinson's disease is an acquired disease not caused by a hereditary process.\r"

Botulinum toxin injections into multiple sites of the thyroarytenoid muscle on one side were performed in 16 patients. Speech was recorded prior to injection and three times post-injection. Symptoms were measured by two examiners from speech spectrograms without knowledge of speaker identity or recording session. Significant (p less than or equal to 0.03) reductions in pitch and voice breaks, phonatory aperiodicity, and sentence time occurred only when injections resulted in unilateral vocal fold paralysis. Symptoms returned with the restoration of vocal fold movement, 3 months later. Reduction in speed of swallowing without aspiration was reported in 80% of cases.

Severe behavioral disturbances were more likely to occur in patients with left frontal structural lesions upon injecting amobarbital into the right hemisphere. Analysis of patients with structural lesions of the anterior regions of the right hemisphere showed no evidence of similar behavioral complications.

Clinical ratings of 11 neurologic symptoms (three bilateral) were obtained at the time of testing, and odor identification was retested in 24 patients at intervals ranging from 5 to 39 months. Relative to matched controls, the PD patients exhibited consistent and marked decrements on both types of olfactory tests (ps less than 0.0001). The odor identification deficit was not restricted to any subset of odorants and did not evidence longitudinal change. A factor analysis of the intercorrelations among the variables yielded six easily interpretable factors: general motor, oral motor, olfactory function, cognitive function, tremor, and gender. Olfactory test scores were independent of all other measures, including disease stage and duration. Seventy-two percent of the PD patients were unaware of a smell disorder before testing; those who were aware had significantly lower test scores. A statistical comparison of PD patients' olfactory test scores to those obtained from Alzheimer's disease patients found the olfactory disorders of these diseases to be indistinguishable. The data support the hypothesis that the olfactory deficit of PD is a general and stable one which likely occurs early in the disease process.\r"

We present a 9-year-old girl with a phenotype similar to a mucopolysaccharidosis: short stature, microcephaly, and mild facial dysmorphism, along with dysphagia, retinal degeneration, developmental arrest, and ataxia. We discuss the importance of measuring the sulfatase activities in the leukocytes, and the instability of sulfatases in the cultured skin fibroblasts.\r"

However, when the DAT patients were analyzed according to age at onset of dementia or presence of extrapyramidal signs, alpha-MSH-LI concentrations remained significantly lower than in controls only in DAT patients with late onset of dementia (greater than 65 years of age). No correlation was found between alpha-MSH levels and degree of mental impairment. A significant negative correlation was found between CSF concentrations of alpha-MSH and homovanillic acid in the group of all DAT patients (p less than 0.001). These results suggest that hypothalamic neurons which produce pro-opiomelanocortin-related peptides may be involved in Alzheimer's disease.\r"

All dementia cases with a premortem diagnosis of DAT or PD showed large numbers of HLA-DR-positive reactive microglia and significant plaque and tangle counts in the hippocampus, as well as reduced cortical choline acetyltransferase activity. One of 11 nondemented controls showed mild evidence of similar cortical pathology. These data indicate that HLA-DR-positive reactive microglia are a sensitive index of neuropathologic activity.

This report documents an uncharacteristically aggressive case of neurosyphilis accompanied by marked changes in the CSF in an HIV-positive patient. While the immunologic effects of HIV and syphilis in combination are not yet fully understood, the cellular immunity defect associated with HIV may alter the natural history of syphilis in patients with concomitant infection, producing unusually aggressive forms or atypical presentations of neurosyphilis.\r"

We report a technique for incisional lacrimal gland biopsy under these circumstances. To prevent tumor spillage in the event of benign mixed tumor, the incision site into the gland is covered with several drops of butyl-2-cyanoacrylate. The biopsy specimen is submitted for frozen section examination. If the frozen section reveals benign mixed tumor, the entire gland may be removed, with the cyanoacrylate bond protecting the lacrimal gland contents from contaminating the orbit. The technique and its indications are described in detail.\r"

In humans, a biphasic incidence occurs with peak infection rates among young children and young adults. In children, infection is spread by direct contact or through fomites, with lesions predominating on the trunk, extremities, and face. In young adults, this disease is spread primarily through sexual contact. Periocular infection can cause secondary chronic follicular conjunctivitis, superficial keratitis, and punctal occlusion. Although many modes of therapy are effective in destruction of the virus, some may have significant side effects when used in the periocular area. We describe treatment by incision and curettage, which we recommend as a simple, effective method of managing this problem.\r"

In the boys, these spots were located on a background of fine variations in pigment, with scattered depigmented atrophic areas revealing the sclera in the peripheral and midperipheral fundus. Superadded white spots were located in front of the retinal vessels. The younger boy also had discrete patches of chorioretinal atrophy of 0.5 to 1 disc diameter.

A flow meter was added to the water system to adjust flow rates. It clearly shows when laser shutdowns are caused by low flow rates and indicates the need for water filter changes. Water pressure was monitored and is most affected by use of the laser. A convenient electric water control, activated by the laser key switch, has proved to be reliable. The water control is kept open by a timer ten minutes after the laser is shut off.

In certain situations this approach has revolutionized medical management, e.g. in immune thrombocytopenia. In other areas, such as in Kawasaki's syndrome, IVIG therapy have been shown to be highly beneficial in preventing long term disease sequelae by some investigators, but the field remains controversial. Conditions under which IVIG therapy has been shown to be of potential benefit are: (1) intractable childhood epilepsy; (2) autoimmune diseases, e.g. myasthenia gravis, systemic lupus erythematosus, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, idiopathic neutropenia and aplastic anemia; (3) atopic allergy with IgG subclass deficiency including bronchial asthma; (4) in severe infections in combination therapy with antibiotics and as an antipyretic; (5) in Kawasaki's disease; (6) in multiple myeloma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Oral and intraventricular administration of IVIG have also been tried, the former for severe diarrhea and the latter to try to rescue the central nervous system from damage by a pathogen. Carefully controlled clinical trials are needed to establish the efficacy of gamma-globulin therapy in these and other conditions.\r"

Data are given here showing that after such events the levels of immunoglobulins; the complement factors C3C, C4 and C Factor B; and the numbers of circulating lymphocytes and of the subpopulations CD3, CD4, CD8 and natural killer cells as well as the stimulatory capacity of mononuclear cells to mitogen fall; while the levels of acute phase proteins, neopterin and interleukin 2 receptors and the spontaneous uptake of thymidine by mononuclear cells become augmented. Extent and duration of these changes and the rate of subsequent infections depend on the extent and kind of surgery (minor, major, clean, contaminated). However, crucial factors of the posttrauma and postsurgery immunodeficiency syndromes are not yet elucidated and relevant predictive parameters for infections are not at hand. These are essential prerequisites to initiate future immunomodulatory measures which should be added to the use of intravenous immunoglobulins yielding so far distinct but limited benefits for the prevention of infections after polytrauma and major surgery.\r"

  ".W": "In the last 30 years patients with antibody deficiency have benefited remarkably from regular replacement therapy with intramuscular immune serum globulin. In a proportion of patients this approach has not been successful in preventing sinopulmonary infections and progressive deterioration. The introduction of preparations of immune serum globulin suitable for intravenous administration provided the potential for examining the effects of achieving higher serum IgG levels. We have therefore evaluated and compared high vs low dose therapy in patients with hypogammaglobulinemia and sinopulmonary disease. To achieve minimum trough serum IgG levels of 500 mg/dl, we administered 0.6 g/kg every 4 weeks. High dose therapy proved efficacious in reducing symptoms, decreasing the frequency of major and minor infections and significantly improving pulmonary function. The improvement appeared to correlate with a marked reduction in the isolation of Mycoplasma, particularly Urea-plasma urealyticum, an important cause of infection in patients with hypogammaglobulinemia. High dose therapy with immune serum globulin suitable for intravenous administration appears to be the treatment of choice in patients with sinopulmonary disease.\r"

Recent experimental animal studies suggest that it may result from prior irreversible cerebral necrosis and therefore represents a consequence as opposed to a cause of major brain injury. In this study, 32 asphyxiated term newborns were studied during the first week of life with serial intracranial pressure measurements. A total of 26 infants had CT scans during the first five days of life. Seven patients had two CT scans within this period. These investigations were correlated with outcome at 18 months of age. Seven infants had increased intracranial pressure (greater than 10 mm Hg) that reached a maximum between 36 and 72 hours of age. Cerebral perfusion pressures remained normal, which makes ongoing ischemic injury unlikely as a cause. The seven patients with increased intracranial pressure had decreased attenuation on CT that was generalized in six infants and patchy in one infant. Of the infants with increased intracranial pressure and severe CT abnormalities, three died and four had severe neurologic sequelae. In seven infants, a second CT scan at three to four days of life demonstrated progression of the decrease in tissue attenuation. Most of the infants with normal intracranial pressure (23/25) had no or had only minor neurologic abnormalities at follow-up. These data suggest that brain swelling is relatively uncommon in the asphyxiated term newborn.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

All 13 of these children (93%) had clinically significant histories of bilateral recurrent serous otitis media (ie, they were otitis prone), and at least four children (29%) had bilateral sensorineural hearing losses in addition to being otitis prone. Many of the children with recurrent serous otitis media required repeated myringotomies with placement of ventilation tubes, and those with sensorineural hearing losses required sound amplification during childhood. Recurrent respiratory infections (secondary to immune deficiencies) and eustachian tube dysfunction (secondary to embryonic malformations of the first and second branchial arches) are discussed as possible etiologic factors in the presence of the recurrent serous otitis media. An alcohol-induced neuroectoderm syndrome and alcohol ototoxicity are discussed as possible etiologic factors in the occurrence of sensorineural hearing loss. The findings suggest that hearing disorders are a heretofore unrecognized characteristic of the fetal alcohol syndrome. Such hearing disorders may contribute to the speech and language and learning difficulties seen in children with fetal alcohol syndrome. The present study also provided confirmatory evidence of visual, health, and speech and language disorders in children with this syndrome.\r"

Two patients had proven neurologic abnormalities before extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Postextracorporeal membrane oxygenation CT brain scans showed right hemispheric focal abnormalities in three patients. Seven infants had neuromotor abnormalities which were lateralizing in nature; all were left sided, suggesting right-sided brain injury. EEGs showed an increased incidence of slowing and attenuation over the right hemisphere. These findings indicate that right-sided brain abnormalities exist after extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and that carotid artery ligation for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation is not without risk.\r"

  ".U": "88289214\r", 
  ".W": "Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has dramatically increased the survival rate of hypoxemic neonates who are unresponsive to maximum conventional medical therapy. Because ECMO involves multiple risks, including ligation of the right common carotid artery and right internal jugular vein, ECMO candidates should be neurologically intact neonates with a high probability of death despite maximum conventional ventilatory support. Currently, criteria based on the calculated alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient (A-aDO2) have replaced the neonatal pulmonary insufficiency index for predicting mortality and, thus, ECMO eligibility. A retrospective review of death prediction for the 26 months prior to the initiation of an ECMO program revealed a sensitivity of 67% and a specificity of 96% using the criterion of a PaO2 of less than 50 mm Hg for four hours. An equivalent A-aDO2 criterion of greater than or equal to 630 for four hours produced a sensitivity of 61% and a specificity of 96%. Prediction of mortality in neonates with sepsis was poor regardless of the criteria used. Excluding the deaths due to sepsis increased the sensitivity to 86% and 79% using criteria based on PaO2 and A-aDO2, respectively. It is concluded that the use of criteria based on PaO2 is equivalent to criteria based on A-aDO2 for predicting mortality. Criteria based on PaO2 may, however, decrease both the false-negative rate (patients with an elevated PCO2) and the false-positive rate (patients with intentionally induced hypocarbia secondary to hyperventilation alkalosis).\r"

Ages (mean +/- SD) at testing for the two groups was 8 +/- 3 years for the early group and 11 +/- 5 years for the late group. Wechsler verbal, performance, and full-scale IQ scores were lower for the early group (range of mean scores: early, 85 to 86 v late, 96 to 103). Growth measures were significantly different in the two groups. Means +/- SD (percentage of standard) were: length for early group, 92 +/- 9; for late, 99 +/- 7; and head circumference for early, 98 +/- 4; for late, 101 +/- 2. The groups were similar in severity of liver disease and acute nutritional status, however. Patients with intellectual impairment had a longer duration of illness, poor nutritional status, and vitamin E deficiency; 82% of impaired patients were in the early group. The data suggest that liver disease during early life has pernicious effects on intellectual function and linear growth. Careful monitoring of nutritional status of children with early-onset liver disease and aggressive nutritional support beginning at the time of diagnosis may help reduce delays in growth and mental development.\r"

Retinopathy with marked peripheral retinal neovascularization was seen in these litters. Three other litters were exposed to the same treatment for ten days after birth, removed from oxygen, and kept for 15 more days in room air. Severe retinopathy with extraretinal proliferation and, in some cases, retinal detachment developed in these animals. Two other litters received hyperbaric (1.80 atm) oxygen supplementation (FiO2 80%) for ten days after birth and were then kept for 15 days in normobaric room air. These animals showed no evidence of peripheral retinopathy.

Surveillance to identify children with acute respiratory symptoms was done by weekly telephone interview. Symptomatic children were examined, oxygen saturation was determined by oximetry, and nasopharyngeal lavage fluid was collected for virus cultures and rapid respiratory syncytial virus antigen tests. During the 4-month study period (December to April), 27 children had one or more acute respiratory illnesses, and respiratory syncytial virus developed in 16/27 (59%). Passive smoking and greater than or equal to four members in the home increased the risk of symptomatic respiratory syncytial virus (P less than .01 and P less than .03, respectively). Of 16 children, 11 (69%) required hospitalization. Of the 11 hospitalized children with respiratory syncytial virus, nine were either still receiving oxygen at home or required oxygen therapy within the previous 3 months v none of five nonhospitalized children (P less than .005). Five of the hospitalized children were greater than 12 months of age and five had respiratory syncytial virus infection previously that had been confirmed by culture results. Hospitalizations were prolonged and complicated.

Nine additional infants had monilial diaper rashes, which spread to the trunk and extremities in four infants. These infants were older at the onset of the dermatitis, and all survived the systemic infection. Systemic candidiasis without any cutaneous involvement developed in only one infant. Candidiasis should be more frequently considered, and prompt systemic therapy should be instituted when cutaneous candidiasis occurs within the first few days of life in infants who weigh less than 1,500 g.\r"

Of the 26 children (33%) with abnormal IVP findings, 13 had congenital urinary tract anomalies only and 13 had urinary tract injuries (eight renal contusions, four renal lacerations with extravasation, and one bladder rupture). The number of RBCs per high-power field correlated with IVP evidence of injury (P less than .05). If only those patients with greater than or equal to 20 RBCs per high-power field had received IVPs, 42% of IVPs would have been avoided and no injuries or surgically correctable anomalies would have been overlooked. Urinary tract injury occurred significantly more often in patients with extremity fractures (P less than .05) and pelvic fractures (P less than .05). Mechanism of injury, admission to the hospital, and flank tenderness or hematoma were not associated with IVP evidence of trauma (P greater than .05), however. In four patients with trauma, results of IVP led to lengthened hospitalization or further diagnostic studies but did not result in surgery.

  ".W": "Live virus vaccines can cause serious adverse reactions when administered to immunocompromised patients. Because children infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) may be immunosuppressed, immunization of these children with live virus vaccines is a potential problem. A retrospective survey was conducted by the New York City Department of Health, with consultation from the Centers for Disease Control, to evaluate the frequency of serious adverse events following receipt of live vaccines among children with HIV infection receiving pediatric care in New York City and New Jersey. Outpatient records of 319 children being cared for by 16 participating physicians were reviewed. Of the 319 charts, 221 (69%) contained vaccination histories. Perinatal transmission of HIV infection was suspected for 208 (94%) of the 221 cases and infection via transfusion for the remaining 13 (6%). Of the 221 for whom immunization histories were available, 180 (81%) had received at least one dose of live oral polio vaccine and 70 (32%) had received measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine. There were 120 children for whom a temporal relationship between immunization and onset of symptoms of immunodeficiency could be seen; 46/120 had received at least one dose of oral polio vaccine and 23/45 had received measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine after onset of symptoms. Although follow-up of this population has been limited, there were no reports of serious adverse events such as typical or atypical measles, paralytic poliomyelitis, or aseptic meningitis in the month following vaccination.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The medical records and echocardiograms of 58 newborns with persistent Staphylococcus epidermidis bacteremia who were hospitalized in the neonatal intensive care unit at The New York Hospital during the past 5 1/2 years were reviewed, and five infants were identified as having S epidermidis right-sided infective endocarditis. These episodes were associated with placement of umbilical venous catheters in the right atrium, slow resolution of bacteremia, and persistent thrombocytopenia. This experience suggests the role of endocardial trauma resulting from the placement of umbilical venous catheters in the pathogenesis of endocarditis. The increasing importance of coagulase-negative staphylococci as a cause of bacteremia in the newborn may explain the emergence of S epidermidis as an important cause of infective endocarditis in the neonatal intensive care unit. These cases underscore the potential severity of S epidermidis infection in the premature newborn.\r"

Management of osteoarthritis starts with patient education on moderating activity and avoiding local joint stresses. Caution in use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs is essential. Local injection of corticosteroids in small amounts into particularly symptomatic joints may yield long-term or repeatable local relief. When an adequate trial of conservative measures fails to preserve or permit reasonably moderate function of a joint, surgical correction must be considered.\r"

Discontinue all monoamine oxidase inhibitors at least one week prior to surgery and substitute alternative antihypertensive or antidepressant medication as necessary. 4.

Mouth-to-mouth ventilation is ineffective until the water is removed. The Heimlich maneuver expels aspirated water, vomitus, debris, and other foreign matter. In treating near-drowning victims, place the victim in the supine position with head turned to the side and perform the Heimlich maneuver to evacuate water from the lungs, unless you know water is not in the respiratory tract. The Heimlich maneuver is a form of artificial respiration. It elevates the diaphragm, increasing intrathoracic pressure and compressing the lungs, and should be performed intermittently until all water is expelled. It is an especially useful technique because fear of contagion sometimes deters rescuers from using mouth-to-mouth ventilation . Further treatment has not been necessary in most instances. If the victim does not recover after water ceases to flow from the mouth, ventilation techniques, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and other measures as indicated should be used.\r"

  ".W": "The temptation to specify cause-and-effect relationships in cases of neurologic handicap has created a number of misconceptions that have stimulated irresponsible malpractice litigation focusing on childbirth. Paradoxically, the number of such lawsuits is on the increase, even though obstetric and neonatal care has improved dramatically since Virginia Apgar introduced her scoring system in 1953. Nowadays, no evidence of intrapartum hypoxia is found in the majority of newborns who require resuscitation. Consequently, the value of using the Apgar score as an index for assessing asphyxia should be vigorously questioned. It should also be stressed that asphyxial damage may occur without respiratory depression. The recent proliferation of articles linking fetal scalp or cord blood evidence of metabolic acidosis to birth asphyxia threatens to create another legal booby trap. Although the development of fetal metabolic acidosis reflects oxygen deprivation, this fact should not be misconstrued to mean that any degree of oxygen deprivation can damage the brain. Available data make it quite clear that the fetus can sustain transient episodes of hypoxemia without ill effects. In those neonates born with low Apgar scores, cord blood gases should be measured to exclude hypoxemia. Securing such data can protect practitioners from subsequent legal inquiry. Routine determination of cord blood gases is not recommended, however, because a substantial number of newborns who are born acidotic have normal Apgar scores.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Bicontinuous cubic phases, composed of bilayers arranged in the geometries of periodic minimal surfaces, are found in a variety of different lipid/water systems. It has been suggested recently that these cubic structures arrive as the result of competition between two free-energy terms: the curvature energy of each monolayer and the stretching energy of the lipid chains. This scenario, closely analogous to the one that explains the origin of the hexagonal phases, is investigated here by means of simple geometrical calculations. It is first assumed that the lipid bilayer is of constant thickness and the distribution of the (local) mean curvature of the phospholipid-water interfaces is calculated. Then, assuming the mean curvature of these interfaces is constant, the distribution of the bilayer's thickness is calculated. Both calculations quantify the fact that the two energy terms are frustrated and cannot be satisfied simultaneously. However, the amount of the frustration can be smaller for the cubic phase than for the lamellar and hexagonal structures. Therefore, this phase can appear in the phase diagram between the other two, as observed in many recent experiments.\r"

The process uses retroviral vectors and mixtures of two \"packaging cell lines\" that incorporate retroviral genomes into virions with different host-range envelopes. In these cocultures, interference barriers to superinfection are overcome, retroviral vectors can replicate in the absence of a transmissible helper virus, and the cells become infected with multiple copies of the provirus that contains the cloned gene. This procedure was used to amplify expression of the membrane glycoprotein that is encoded by Friend spleen focus-forming virus, a retrovirus that is replication defective in other cell cultures. Amplifications were measured at the DNA provirus, RNA, and protein levels. In addition, the human growth hormone gene was inserted into retroviral vectors and we observed amplifications of growth hormone synthesis and secretion. The amplified growth hormone was properly processed as indicated by immunoblot analyses. A vector is described (pSFF) that is exceptionally active in coculture amplification.\r"

The MAP model chosen for study was an octa-branching MAP consisting of a core matrix made up of three levels of lysine and eight amino terminals for anchoring peptide antigens. The MAP, containing both the core matrix and peptides of 9-16 amino acids, was prepared in a single synthesis by the solid-phase method. Six different MAPs elicited specific antibodies in rabbits and mice, of which five produced antibodies that reacted with their corresponding native proteins. In rabbits, the sera had a considerably higher titer of antibodies than sera prepared from the same peptides anchored covalently to keyhole limpet hemocyanin as carrier. Thus, the MAP provided a general, but chemically unambiguous, approach for the preparation of carrier-bound antigens of predetermined and reproducible structure and might be suitable for generating vaccines.\r"

By using solid-phase peptide synthesis methodology, DL-Phe(pBz) was incorporated into the cAMP-dependent protein kinase substrate Leu-Arg-Arg-Ala-Ser-Leu-Gly in place of the phosphorylatable serine. The diastereomeric peptides were separated by reverse-phase HPLC. The peptide substrate analog containing L-Phe(pBz) had a Ki of approximately 110 microM at pH 7.5. When photolyzed at 350 nm in the presence of the enzyme, this peptide caused time- and concentration-dependent inactivation. Radioactive acetylated L-Phe(pBz) peptide was used to establish the binding stoichiometry of peptide to enzyme; these results, together with protection experiments, showed the photoaffinity labeling to be specific (approximately 1:1). To identify the residues that were modified on the catalytic subunit, the photoinactivated enzyme was cleaved with CNBr and V8 protease (Staphylococcus aureus). The resulting peptide fragments were purified by HPLC and were sequenced; these experiments identified the modified residues as Gly-125 and Met-127. This region of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit contains many residues that are conserved in serine- and tyrosine-protein kinases.\r"

Chromophore-assisted laser inactivation can be used to study cell surface phenomena by inactivating the functions of single proteins on living cells, a molecular extension of cellular laser ablation.

Several forms of splicing complexes assemble on precursor RNA during splicing in vitro. One of these forms, spliceosome B, contains U2, U4, U5, and U6 snRNPs bound to the precursor RNA. This same set of snRNPs associates efficiently in the absence of precursor RNA during incubation of the extract at high salt concentration.

  ".W": "By using oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis, we have produced a point mutation (guanine to adenine) at nucleotide 388 of the gene for human beta-adrenergic receptor (beta AR) that results in a substitution of asparagine for the highly conserved aspartic acid at position 130 in the putative third transmembrane domain of the human beta AR ([Asn130]beta AR). We have examined the functional significance of this mutation in B-82 cells continuously expressing the mutant [Asn130]beta AR. The mutant [Asn130]beta AR displayed normal antagonist binding but unusually high-affinity agonist binding (5- to 10-fold higher than wild-type beta AR), consistent with a single class of high-affinity binding sites. The mutant beta AR displayed guanine nucleotide-sensitive changes in agonist affinity (3- to 5-fold shift) implying an interaction between the beta AR and the stimulatory guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory protein; however, the ability of guanine nucleotides to alter agonist affinity was attenuated. Addition of saturating concentrations of isoproterenol to cell cultures expressing mutant [Asn130]-beta ARs had no effect on intracellular levels of cAMP, indicating that the mutant beta AR is unable to affect stimulation of adenylate cyclase. These results indicate that substitution of the aspartic acid with asparagine at residue 130 of the human beta AR dissociates the well-characterized guanine nucleotide effects on agonist affinity from those on activation of the stimulatory guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory protein and adenylate cyclase and suggests the existence of two distinct counterions for the amine portion of catecholamines that are associated with high- and low-affinity agonist binding states of beta AR.\r"

As cells develop aggregation competence, the antigen is released from the cell surface in a soluble form that can still be radiolabeled with [14C]ethanolamine but not with [3H]myristate or [3H]palmitate. The molecular weight of the released antigen is similar to that found in the plasma membrane, but it preferentially partitions in Triton X-114 as a hydrophilic, as opposed to a hydrophobic, protein.

A single component, termed the \"ATR\" (a flash-induced scattering signal, where ATR designates amplified transient-retina), dominates the amplitude and rising-phase kinetics of the initial peak of the light-scattering response. Superfusion with physiological solution containing low Na+ concentration reversibly abolishes the photoreceptor electroretinographic response but preserves the ATR signal, indicating a receptoral origin for the ATR. The increase of ATR amplitude (A/Amax) with flash intensity (R*/R, where R indicates rhodopsin) is described by A/Amax = (1- e-kR*/R), with R*/R = k-1 occurring on generation of approximately two photoactivated rhodopsins (R*s) per disc surface in the rod outer segment. Weak background light and bright flashes reversibly depress the ATR. Kinetic and sensitivity data suggest a basis of the ATR in stochastic, unit activation events, each initiated by a single R*. They further suggest an essential invariance of the unit event under differing conditions of illumination. A delay, apparently governed by the lifetime of a light-activated substance regulating ATR generation, precedes ATR recovery after a bright flash. The flash dependence of the delay period indicates an upper limit of 3 s for the lifetime of R* in the ATR-generating process. The unit event appears to be an R*-catalyzed and disc-localized reaction of phototransduction.\r"

As much as 66% inhibition of glandular differentiation can be achieved by addition to the culture of a synthetic peptide (2 mg/ml) containing the Arg-Gly-Asp-Thr (RGDT) sequence, which is a cell recognition site found in collagen. Arg-Gly-Asp-Thr also inhibited the cell attachment to collagen-coated plates. A control peptide containing the Arg-Gly-Glu-Thr (RGET) sequence had no effect on cell adhesion or cell differentiation. Chromosome 15 was found in all human-mouse hybrid clones [from a cross between SW1222 and a mouse rectal carcinoma cell line (CMT-93)] that could differentiate in the collagen gel and bind collagen. Both binding to collagen and glandular differentiation of the hybrid cells were also inhibited by Arg-Gly-Asp-Thr as for the parent cell line SW1222. The ability of SW1222 cells to express the differentiated phenotype appears, therefore, to be determined by an Arg-Gly-Asp-directed collagen receptor on the cell surface that is controlled by a gene on chromosome 15.\r"

The binding of 125I-labeled SP-A is time- and temperature-dependent and is not accompanied by significant degradation. The binding process is saturable at low concentrations of SP-A (5 micrograms/ml), and unlabeled SP-A readily competes with labeled SP-A for cellular binding sites. Subsequent to binding, two pools of cell-associated 125I-labeled SP-A can be identified based upon sensitivity to trypsin at 0 degrees C. It is likely that the trypsin-sensitive pool comprises 125I-labeled SP-A bound to the cell surface and the trypsin-insensitive pool comprises the internalized protein. Scatchard analysis of cell surface binding of SP-A at 0.1-10 micrograms/ml shows positive cooperativity at concentrations between 0.1 and 1 micrograms/ml. Hill plots give nH = 1.34 +/- 0.08 with an apparent dissociation constant K'd = 1.02 +/- 0.32 micrograms/ml (which is 0.64 +/- 0.19 nM if the native molecular mass of oligomeric SP-A is assumed to be 1.6 MDa). The binding of SP-A to type II cells shows an absolute requirement for Ca2+. The putative receptor for SP-A is unaffected by treatment of type II cells with a variety of proteases and N-Glycanase (EC 3.5.1.52). Alveolar macrophages also exhibit high-affinity binding of SP-A, but rat lung fibroblasts and the alveolar epithelial cell line L2 exhibit only nonspecific binding.\r"

In the second phase, the growth of pbc1051-transfected cells was stimulated by dexamethasone, but the hormone was not essential for growth. After approximately 10 weeks in culture, pbc1051-transfected cells had progressed to hormone independent growth. Rat embryo cells transfected with wild-type polyomavirus DNA had the second phase in which growth was stimulated by glucocorticoid, and after this phase growth was steroid independent. Addition of glucocorticoids to rat fibroblasts transfected with a plasmid encoding only the middle-sized tumor antigen resulted in only a weak stimulation of growth. In contrast, embryo cells transfected with a plasmid containing the human homologue of the cellular T24 Ha-ras gene linked to murine sarcoma virus and simian virus 40 enhancers could be efficiently established as cell lines in medium supplemented with glucocorticoids. The data suggest that, in the transformation of primary rodent cells by polyomavirus, the activity of large tumor antigen can be substituted for by stimulating normal cellular functions with dexamethasone.\r"

Our analysis of the Hox-2.2 cDNA and genomic clones indicates that there are at least two oxons and one intron. The largest open reading frame includes the homeobox and codes for a 224 amino acid protein of molecular weight 25,312. Comparisons of the predicted Hox-2.2 protein with other homeodomain-containing proteins revealed four regions of sequence similiarity: an N-terminal octapeptide, a hexapeptide upstream of the homeodomain, the homeodomain, and a glutamic acid-rich region at the C terminus. Possible functions of these regions are discussed. The Hox-2.2 gene is expressed in 13.5-day embryos in the developing hindbrain and spinal cord. The expression patterns of Hox-2.2 and Hox-2.1 in 13.5-day embryos are compared.\r"

In this study, we have examined the steady-state levels of the Hox-1.3 transcripts in undifferentiated and differentiated F9 embryonal carcinoma cells. We find that there is a rapid increase of Hox-1.3 transcripts after differentiation induction of F9 cells. The level of the major 1.85-kilobase (kb) transcript peaks at 16-24 hr after differentiation induction of F9 cells. By using primer extension techniques the 5' ends of the major 1.85-kb transcript have been mapped to two sites in induced F9 cells. Cellular fractionation of RNA and transfer blot gel analysis has localized one minor transcript to the nucleus, whereas the major transcript and two additional minor transcripts appear in the nucleus and the cytoplasm of induced F9 cells. The results of nuclear run-off experiments with uninduced and induced F9 cell nuclei indicate that there is a substantial increase in the rate of Hox-1.3 transcription upon induction of F9 cells with retinoic acid.\r"

  ".U": "88289764\r", 
  ".W": "Thyroid hormone has been implicated as an important factor in rodent development. We have used a strain of mice with a recessive mutation producing congenital primary hypothyroidism (C.RF/J-hyt/+) to study the effects of thyroid hormone on developmental changes in the expression of genes encoding a number of proteins involved in lipid metabolism and transport. Total cellular RNA was prepared from the small intestine and liver of hyt/hyt mice and their unaffected littermates (+/?) at various times during postnatal development. RNA blots were probed with apolipoprotein A-I, A-II, A-IV, B, and E cDNAs plus cDNAs encoding the low density lipoprotein receptor, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, and three cytoplasmic hydrophobic ligand-binding proteins (two fatty acid-binding proteins and a protein that binds all-trans-retinol). Hypothyroidism results in small changes (1.5- to 5-fold) in the concentration of many of these mRNAs in liver and small intestine between postnatal days 15 and 50. A much greater tissue-specific effect was noted on apolipoprotein B (apoB) gene expression. In euthyroid +/? animals, apoB mRNA levels fall by a factor of 30 in liver between days 20 and 35 without a comparable decrease in the small intestine. This liver-specific decrease does not occur in hyt/hyt animals. The normal decrease in hepatic apoB mRNA levels is accompanied by a decrease in plasma apoB-100 but not apoB-48. No reduction in either form of plasma apoB was noted in hyt/hyt animals. Mutant hyt/hyt mice given thyroxine from birth to 35 days had liver apoB mRNA levels comparable to those in +/? littermates. In contrast, hepatic apoB mRNA concentrations did not fall to normal levels in hyt/hyt mice given thyroxine from postnatal days 15 to 35. All treatment groups have comparable levels of plasma corticosteroids. These data suggest that (i) there is a critical period or a required response time during postnatal development for thyroid hormone action on apoB gene expression, (ii) thyroid hormone's effect on apoB is tissue specific, and (iii) the hyt/hyt mouse represents a useful system to evaluate the developmental effects of thyroid hormone on specific gene expression.\r"

The current model for this receptor depicts a four-subunit structure, alpha beta gamma 2. A cDNA for the alpha subunit was recently cloned and predicts a structure consisting of two homologous extracellular domains, a transmembrane segment, and a cytoplasmic tail. Using a synthetic oligonucleotide corresponding to the amino-terminal sequence of the alpha subunit, we identified a number of cDNA clones from a rat basophilic leukemia cell cDNA library. Nucleotide sequencing established four different forms of cDNA: one is nearly identical to the published cDNA; the second differs from the first in the 5' untranslated sequence; the other two forms use either one or the other of the 5'-end sequences as above and lack 163 base pairs in the region coding for the second extracellular domain. RNase protection analysis with radioactive RNA probes established the heterogeneity of rat basophilic leukemia cell mRNA with regard to both the 5' and the internal sequences. Our results suggest the existence of at least four different protein forms related to the alpha subunit of the high-affinity IgE receptor.\r"

However, there is conflicting evidence regarding the potency of hHCF on bone and, by implication, its role in calcium mobilization and the skeletal contribution to tumor-associated hypercalcemia. To resolve this conflict, the effects of infusing either hHCF-(1-34)-NH2 or a peptide containing residues 1-34 of bovine PTH [bPTH-(1-34)] into unrestrained thyroparathyroidectomized rats on a low calcium diet were compared. Direct effects on bone histology and serum calcium levels, which are totally dependent on calcium mobilization from bone in these animals, were examined. bPTH-(1-34) and hHCF-(1-34)-NH2 were equipotent in producing dose-dependent calcium mobilization from bone. At an infusion rate of 0.1 nmol/hr, both peptides produced hypercalcemia and extensive nephrocalcinosis. Histomorphometric analysis of tibiae from these animals after 48 hr of peptide infusion showed a dose-related increase in osteoclast number from 3-5 cells per mm2 at 0.01 nmol/hr to approximately equal to 32 cells per mm2 at 0.1 nmol/hr of hHCF or bovine PTH. These findings indicate that hHCF has a direct PTH-like effect on bone and, in this model system, the hHCF-(1-34)-NH2 is equipotent to bPTH-(1-34).\r"

A sensitive and specific radioimmunoassay (RIA) for RC-160 was developed and used for following the rate of liberation of this peptide from microcapsules of poly(DL-lactide-coglycolide). Antibodies were generated in a rabbit against RC-160 conjugated to bovine serum albumin with glutaraldehyde. At an antiserum dilution of 1:100,000, the antibodies bound approximately 25% of added radiolabeled RC-160. Somatostatin octapeptide analogs that had a disulfide bridge showed crossreactivity with the antiserum, but analogs without the disulfide bridge and other peptides tested did not crossreact. The minimum detectable dose of RC-160 was 10 pg. Intra- and interassay coefficients of variation ranged from 9.1% to 12.8% and from 14% to 30%, respectively. The RIA was suitable for direct determination of RC-160 in serum. Eleven prototype batches of microcapsules were tested in rats, and the rate of release of the analog from the microcapsules was followed. An improved batch of microcapsules made from RC-160 pamoate maintained high serum levels of RC-160 for more than 30 days after intramuscular injection. The RIA should be of value for monitoring levels of this analog in serum during long-term therapy.\r"

  ".W": "Free radicals have been hypothesized to be important mediators of disease in a variety of organs and tissues. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy can be applied to directly measure free radicals; however, it has not been possible to measure important biological radicals in situ because conventional spectrometer designs are not suitable for the performance of measurements on whole organs or tissues. We report the development of an EPR spectrometer designed for optimum performance in measuring free radicals in intact biological organs or tissues. This spectrometer consists of a 1- to 2-GHz microwave bridge with the source locked to the resonant frequency of a recessed gap loop-gap resonator. With this spectrometer, radical concentrations as low as 0.4 microM can be measured. Isolated beating hearts were studied in which simultaneous real time measurements of free radicals and cardiac contractile function were performed. This in vivo EPR technique was applied to study the kinetics of free radical uptake and metabolism in normally perfused and globally ischemic hearts. In addition, we show that this technique can be used to noninvasively measure tissue oxygen consumption. Thus, it is demonstrated that EPR spectroscopy can be applied to directly measure in vivo free radical metabolism and tissue oxygen consumption. This technique offers great promise in the study of in vivo free radical generation and the effects of this radical generation on whole biological tissues.\r"

Based on a previous observation that the naphthalene sulfonamide calmodulin antagonist W-7 can block Paramecium Ca channels at high concentration, we have synthesized analogs of W-7 that block these channels at concentrations of less than 1 microM. The effectiveness of these compounds was tested both by a sensitive behavioral assay and on Ca channels that had been incorporated into planar lipid bilayers. Despite the fact that these compounds are effective Paramecium calmodulin antagonists, two independent lines of evidence suggest that W-7 and its analogs block the Ca channel by a mechanism that is independent of their action on calmodulin. In addition, the sensitivity to W-7 or dihydropyridines of Ca channels present in a number of eukaryotic phyla has been used to identify similarities in Ca channels from widely diverse organisms. It appears that the pharmacological specificity provides a means to group Ca channels.\r"

An analysis of structure-function relationships shows that the conserved central region of Sh polypeptides determines ionic selectivity and overall channel behavior, whereas the divergent amino and carboxyl termini can modify channel kinetics. Alternative splicing of Sh gene transcripts may provide one mechanism for the generation of K+ channel diversity.\r"

To determine whether there is differential loss among different populations of striatal projection neurons, the integrity of the axon terminal plexuses arising from the different populations of substance P-containing and enkephalin-containing striatal projection neurons was studied in striatal target areas by immunohistochemistry. Analysis of 17 HD specimens indicated that in early and middle stages of HD, enkephalin-containing neurons projecting to the external segment of the globus pallidus were much more affected than substance P-containing neurons projecting to the internal pallidal segment. Furthermore, substance P-containing neurons projecting to the substantia nigra pars reticulata were more affected than those projecting to the substantia nigra pars compacta. At the most advanced stages of the disease, projections to all striatal target areas were depleted, with the exception of some apparent sparing of the striatal projection to the substantia nigra pars compacta. These findings may explain some of the clinical manifestations and pharmacology of HD. They also may aid in identifying the neural defect underlying HD and provide additional data with which to evaluate current models of HD pathogenesis.\r"

Electrical stimulation (1-3 pulses at 200 Hz) of group III and IV pure muscle afferents (gastrocnemius nerve) evoked excitation of greater than 50% of supraoptic nucleus neurons (n = 50), whereas stimulation of group Ia or Ib fibers was ineffective. Baroreceptor stimulation inhibited 95% of these supraoptic nucleus neurons that responded to activation of muscle afferents. Excitation of receptors in the gastrocnemius muscle by intra-arterial injection of chemicals (NaCl, KCl, and bradykinin) increased firing rates of most (84%, 74%, and 80%, respectively) neurosecretary neurons. The magnitude of the excitatory response was dose dependent--bradykinin being the most effective. The response disappeared after muscle denervation. When the gastrocnemius muscle alone was contracted phasically by ventral root stimulation, discharges of the supraoptic nucleus neurons increased, whereas quick stretch of the muscle had no effect. We conclude that activation of muscle receptors by chemical or mechanical stimulus can directly excite neurosecretory neurons in the supraoptic nucleus and that afferent impulses are carried by polymodal fibers of small diameter but not by the largest afferents (group I) from the muscle. The results may relate to increased concentrations of plasma vasopressin during exercise.\r"

Ang II concentrations ranged from 5 X 10(-12) to 5 X 10(-8) M. The mean peak Ca2+i increase was similar at all Ang II concentrations (205 +/- 11 nM), with a significant difference (P less than 0.05) found only between 5 X 10(-12) M (151 +/- 16 nM) and 5 X 10(-9) M (236 +/- 24 nM). Striking differences over the range of Ang II concentrations were found in the Ca2+i response kinetics. A dose-dependent delay of the onset of the Ca2+i response was observed ranging from 2.6 +/- 0.3 sec at 5 X 10(-8) M to 181 +/- 27 sec at 5 X 10(-12) M Ang II. After the delay, cells typically responded with an abrupt increase in Ca2+i, complete within 15 sec. At low Ang II concentrations (5 X 10(-11) and 5 X 10(-12) M), a complex response was often observed consisting of Ca2+i oscillations. Higher Ang II concentrations gave some evidence of Ca2+i oscillation, especially at 5 X 10(-10) M where oscillations appeared fused. Above 5 X 10(-10) M Ang II, the initial Ca2+i increase decayed to an apparent steady-state value 38-40% of the peak response within 5 min; 5 X 10(-10) M Ang II produced a smaller decline to 63% of the initial Ca2+i increase. In contrast to cell population studies, assessment of individual glomerulosa cells demonstrates (i) a dose-dependent delay prior to a rapid increase in Ca2+i; (ii) a similar peak increase at most Ang II concentrations; (iii) greater sensitivity of the Ca2+i response; and (iv) a complex oscillating Ca2+i response in the physiological range of Ang II.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of the Air-Stirrup (AS) standard ankle brace on the gait of 19 subjects with hemiplegia resulting from a cerebrovascular accident who exhibited excessive subtalar joint motion were studied. Videotaped trials and footprint analyses were used to measure subjects' hip, knee, and ankle sagittal plane angles; inversion and eversion of the calcaneus; and time-distance gait characteristics. A one-way analysis of variance for repeated measures was used to compare the gait of 19 subjects with the AS brace and unbraced and 11 subjects with the AS brace, unbraced, and with an ankle-foot orthosis. The AS brace was associated with more calcaneal stability during standing than the unbraced condition. The ankle-foot orthosis was associated with less plantar flexion at foot-strike than either the AS brace or unbraced condition. Both the AS brace and the ankle-foot orthosis were associated with less mid-swing plantar flexion and increased step length on the paretic side compared with no brace. These results support the effectiveness of the AS brace in controlling inversion and eversion instability in patients with hemiplegia.\r"

Aerobic fitness levels were predicted using the Astrand and Ryhming submaximal exercise test. Mean predicted maximal aerobic capacities were significantly higher (p less than .05) for the AA Group (46.0 +/- 6.0 mL.kg-1.min-1) compared with the BA Group (31.0 +/- 4.8 mL.kg-1.min-1) subjects. Heart rate and blood pressure responses were obtained at rest (supine position for 30 minutes) and during 5 minutes of upright tilting to 70 degrees (electric tilt table). A two-factor analysis of variance indicated that the increase in heart rate to upright tilting was significant (p less than .05) (significant treatment effect). More importantly, the study revealed a significant treatment x group interaction (p less than .05), indicating that the heart rate response for the BA Group was significantly greater than for the AA Group. Similar results occurred for blood pressure responses. A separate analysis of variance demonstrated significant changes in hemodynamic responses to upright tilting and significant treatment x group interactions. These results demonstrated significantly smaller (p less than .05) changes in blood pressure and heart rate to upright tilting for the AA Group compared with the BA Group. The results, therefore, indicate that reflex responses to central hypovolemia are different between above-average and below-average aerobically fit adults.\r"

  ".W": "One of the most troublesome complications in the rehabilitation of hemiplegic patients is inferior subluxation of the glenohumeral joint. The purpose of this study was to determine which of two shoulder supports, the Bobath shoulder roll or the Henderson shoulder ring, would be more effective in the management of hemiplegic patients with a subluxated glenohumeral joint. To determine the degree of subluxation and the amount of reduction after application of a shoulder support, radiographs were taken of 26 hemiplegic patients with subluxated shoulders. Radiographs of the unsupported affected shoulder were compared with radiographs of the same shoulder with each support applied. Radiographs of the unaffected shoulder were used as a comparison in determining the amount of subluxation. An analysis of variance revealed no significant difference in the reduction of inferior subluxation between the two types of shoulder support. A significant difference in subluxation, however, existed between measurements of the unsupported affected shoulder and the unaffected shoulder (p less than .001) and between measurements of the unsupported affected shoulder and the supported affected shoulder (p less than .001). The results of this study demonstrate the benefits of the Bobath shoulder roll and the Henderson shoulder ring in the management of hemiplegic patients with subluxated shoulders.\r"

The onset and amplitude of electrical activity in the ankle muscles of four standing hemiplegic subjects with mild stretch reflex abnormalities and four healthy subjects were studied. Each subject stood on a platform controlled by a hydraulic servomechanism and experienced an unexpected posterior horizontal platform movement that induced a forward body sway. The activity of the gastrocnemius (agonist) and tibialis anterior (antagonist) muscles were monitored bilaterally using surface electromyography. In comparison with the healthy subjects, the hemiplegic subjects showed a greater disassociation between agonist and antagonist activation, a larger frequency of response defaults in the antagonist, and an increase in nonparetic (left) limb agonist amplitude during the 200-msec electromyographic integration period. We concluded that the sequelae of cerebrovascular disease may hamper the initiation of a passive shortening response in the tibialis anterior muscle during forward sway. This finding is functionally significant because the response deficit described seems to be exaggerated in some cases and reduced in others.\r"

Ten children with a diagnosis of cerebral palsy (means age = 8.8 +/- 2.7 years) and 9 healthy children (means age = 8.9 +/- 2.4 years) participated in the study. Stride length, walking velocity, and goniometric measurements of the hip, knee, and ankle were recorded using the two gait analysis methods. A multivariate analysis of variance was used to determine significant differences between the data collected using the two methods. Pearson product-moment correlation coefficients were determined to examine the relationship between the measurements recorded by the two methods. The consistency of performance of the subjects during walking was examined by intraclass correlation coefficients. No significant differences were found between the methods for the variables studied. Pearson product-moment correlation coefficients ranged from .79 to .95, and intraclass coefficients ranged from .89 to .97. The clinical gait analysis method was found to be a valid tool in comparison with 16-mm cinematography for the variables that were studied.\r"

Variables that were measured included age, income, social support, physical dependency, pain, and depression. Physical dependency was moderately associated with depression (r = .27). A multiple regression analysis performed to control for the other variables, however, revealed that physical dependency had little effect on depression (R2 change = .03). Correlation (r = .41) and regression (R2 change = .13) analyses indicated that pain was an important factor in level of depression even after controlling for all of the other variables.\r"

Fourteen healthy middle-aged or elderly subjects (means age = 61.3 years) were randomly assigned to either a CTM or placebo group. Subjects received nine separate treatments (CTM or placebo) on alternate days over a three-week period. Each treatment was divided into 15-minute control, intervention, and recovery periods. Subjects in the CTM Group (n = 8) were given CTM on the basic section (low back), and subjects in the Placebo Group (n = 6) had sham ultrasound applied to the same area. Variables monitored were skin temperature (right great toe and popliteal fossa), galvanic skin response, mean arterial blood pressure, and heart rate. Variable measurements were made every five minutes. An analysis of variance and single-case analyses showed no changes in the variables measured in the CTM or Placebo Group. The results of this study suggest that CTM has no consistent immediate or long-term effects on the autonomic nervous system in healthy middle-aged and elderly subjects.\r"

Since textbooks do not agree on the course of the intercostal nerves in the rectus fascia and no precise description is given of the exact site of penetration of the nerves in the rectus muscle, six fresh cadavers were dissected. It has been observed that the nerves enter the deep face of the muscle in its middle portion. Lateral parts of the muscle are consequently denervated during a transverse rectus abdominis musculocutaneous flap, which preserves them. This has been confirmed by CT scan of the abdominal wall in 10 patients 2 to 37 months after a transverse rectus abdominis musculocutaneous flap. In these patients, a progressive fibrosis and disappearance of the remaining muscle could be demonstrated. It is concluded that a partial taking of the rectus abdominis muscle does not preserve its muscular function.\r"

Twenty patients between the ages of 5 months and 17 years were randomly selected from patient files. Patient diagnoses included facial clefts, hypertelorism, Treacher Collins syndrome, and craniofacial dysostosis (Crouzon's and Apert's syndromes). Rigorously standardized photographs of patients taken before and after surgery were shown to 40 \"naive\" raters ranging in age from 17 to 52 years. Raters analyzed the photographs with regard to global physical attractiveness. These ratings indicated that the patients' physical attractiveness was reliably (62 percent) improved following surgery. The results are discussed in light of recent evidence that untreated craniofacial patients may be at risk for psychosocial disorders and in terms of the growing evidence of the importance of physical appearance for the development of cognitive and social-emotional competence. In addition, a standardized assessment system is described that can be used to facilitate the compilation of actuarial data predicting surgical outcomes. Finally, the importance of empirically evaluating the effectiveness of surgical procedures and practitioners on a continuing basis is emphasized.\r"

Since one of the main objectives in outpatient surgery is to have the patient recover as quickly as possible and be discharged without any significant drug hangover, we recommend the incorporation of midazolam into the armamentarium of the aesthetic surgeon. Subsequent to the presentation of this paper (Twentieth Annual Meeting of the American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery, in Los Angeles, California, March 23, 1987), we have administered midazolam to an additional 400 patients undergoing outpatient surgery and no apnea has occurred requiring an airway or supportive respiratory measures.\r"

All patients had preoperative measured decreases in lower face height. Mean vertical lengthening of the chin was 5.3 mm. Seven of the eight patients had class II occlusions and underwent simultaneous sagittal advancement of the chin. Follow-up at a mean time of 11.1 months revealed complete stability of the vertically repositioned symphyseal segment. Mean ratio of the vertical soft to hard tissue augmentation was 0.89:1. There were no instances of operative complications. Vertical facial aesthetics and their application in the evaluation and treatment of patients with vertically deficient lower faces and chins are reviewed.\r"
