The present 1-year actuarial graft and survival rates at the University of Minnesota are 43 and 88 per cent, respectively. The indications for pancreas transplantation and the selection of recipients have undergone modification, and more nonuremic nonkidney transplant patients are now receiving pancreas allografts. A variety of techniques have been used for pancreas transplantation. Whole or segmental pancreas grafts have been used. Most centers drain the graft exocrine secretions into the gastrointestinal tract as a Roux-en-Y pancreaticojejunostomy or into the bladder as a pancreaticocystostomy. The most common complications requiring radiologic evaluation and treatment include vascular thromboses utilizing technetium flow studies and arteriography and intra-abdominal fluid collections and infections requiring ultrasonography and CT scans. Percutaneous aspiration of intra-abdominal fluid collections is important for diagnosis but has not been successful therapeutically. Intra-abdominal infections are most common in patients with enteric drainage of the pancreas graft, which carries a high risk of contamination at the site of anastomosis. Most intra-abdominal infections require surgical drainage and removal of the graft.\r"

The first has been the progressive nationwide development of the Emergency Medical Service System, which identifies trauma centers by a process of categorization, regionalization, and verification. The hospital must be staffed and equipped to perform computed tomography, angiography, and sonography. Trauma centers effectively reduce morbidity and mortality of the accident patient. The second innovation has been the intensive use of computed tomography (CT) for immediate patient evaluation. CT surpasses other imaging methods in examination for craniocerebral, abdominal, spinal, pelvic, and facial trauma. In craniocerebral trauma, the precise diagnosis afforded by CT reduces the fatality rate by permitting early surgical intervention. In abdominal trauma, CT examination supports nonoperative management of hemodynamically stable patients with solid organ injury. In spinal, pelvic, and facial injuries, CT provides diagnostic information not available with conventional radiography.\r"

On the basis of the Doppler findings, the varicoceles were classified as either stop type or shunt type. On venography, the stop-type varicoceles showed only retrograde blood flow (reflux) in the testicular (internal spermatic) vein, whereas each shunt-type varicocele showed both retrograde and orthograde (i.e., physiologic) venous blood flow: First, reflux appeared in the testicular vein, then orthograde flow occurred in the deferential vein, cremasteric vein, or both. The shunt-type varicocele therefore represented a kind of venous bypass. Thus, the existence of two hemodynamically different types of varicocele as suggested initially by Doppler US is confirmed by percutaneous retrograde venography. The shunting of venous blood appears to be a precondition for medium and large varicoceles and might have some prognostic significance for subfertility associated with varicoceles.\r"

When the results in women were analyzed separately (n = 49), the overall accuracy was 96%. Several important limitations of US scanning were encountered. There were three false-positive examinations in patients with a sonographically visible appendix whose symptoms spontaneously resolved. Another patient had a normal compressible appendix with a thin (2-mm), symmetric wall surrounded by ascites. There were three nondiagnostic studies (3%) due to inability to compress the cecum and right lower quadrant adequately because of exquisite tenderness (two patients) or massive ascites (one patient). When interpreted in light of the clinical examination, sonography should significantly reduce the rate of false-negative appendectomies, particularly in women.\r"

The shapes of the ovaries (roundness index) in PCOD patients were not different from those of the healthy women. There was no significant correlation between the size and shape of the ovaries. Bilaterally enlarged, globular-shaped ovaries were rare and usually asymmetric in size. The most important feature of PCOD on US scans is the bilaterally increased numbers of developing follicles (0.5-0.8 cm in size), usually more than five in each ovary. Although maturing follicles (1.5-2.9 cm) are much rarer in PCOD patients (13.5%) than in healthy women (36%), the incidences of follicular cysts (greater than 3 cm) was about the same in both.\r"

The pericallosal, callosomarginal, anterior cerebral, basilar, middle cerebral, and internal carotid arteries and the vein of Galen were isolated and evaluated in almost every subject. In the second part of the study duplex characteristics of healthy term infants, healthy preterm infants, preterm infants with intracranial hemorrhages, and hydrocephalic infants were evaluated. Relative flow velocity at peak systole and end diastole and pulsatility index were investigated. The most significant variable was gestational age. Preterm infants frequently had no forward flow during diastole. Duplex sonography does not appear to add significant diagnostic information to routine real-time cranial studies. It does, however, permit more exact evaluation of cerebral blood flow than does non-pulse-gated, nondirected Doppler scanning.\r"

One or more extra-CNS abnormality was identified with US in 22 of the 27 (81%) fetuses with multiple anomalies but no anomalies were identified with US in the seven patients with an isolated anomaly. Fetal mortality was directly related to the presence of extra-CNS anomalies (P less than .01). Many important anomalies coexisting with fetal hydrocephalus can be identified with US. Furthermore, sonographic detection of extra-CNS malformations carries a poor prognosis and was associated with a uniformly fatal outcome in this series.\r"

The normal structures of the scrotum were depicted clearly on MR images. In all cases, the tunica albuginea was easily differentiated from the testis and epididymis. MR imaging enabled one to distinguish intratesticular from extratesticular lesions and to determine whether a lesion was solid or cystic. Complicated and simple fluid collections could also be differentiated. In general, MR imaging and US scanning provided similar information. A potential advantage of MR imaging is in the evaluation of patients with painful scrotal lesions that may limit US evaluation.\r"

Recent work has identified clear distinctions between nontypable and type b strains of H. influenzae. These organisms affect different patient populations, cause different infections, present different surface antigens to the host, and are genetically different. The commonest clinical manifestation of infection due to nontypable H. influenzae in adults is lower respiratory tract infection, particularly in the elderly and in those with chronic bronchitis. The bacterium is a frequent cause of acute otitis media in children. The surface of nontypable H. influenzae is composed of outer-membrane proteins and lipooligosaccharide, and both of these demonstrate substantial antigenic heterogeneity, which can be used to serotype isolates. Some respiratory tract isolates are fimbriated, but the role of fimbriae in pathogenesis is unclear. Antibodies to outer-membrane proteins and lipooligosaccharide are present in human serum. Investigation of human immunity to infection is focusing on identification of those antigens to which protective antibody is directed.\r"

The meeting, held April 2-6 in Brasilia, was attended by 37 participants representing Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Peru, Venezuela, the United States, PAHO, and the World Health Organization. The objectives of the seminar were to review the current status of the disease, with emphasis on diagnosis and on the care and management of patients, and to formulate recommendations for improvements in diagnosis and management and for future research. A unique aspect of the seminar and one that distinguished it from previous, epidemiologically oriented meetings on yellow fever was the emphasis on clinical medicine and the participation of individuals representing academic medicine in relevant specialties such as hepatology, hematology, cardiology, and nephrology.\r"

The goal is a new generation of safe, inexpensive, and easily administered vaccines that are immunogenic in infancy and provide prolonged immunity in the vaccinate, secondary immunization to community members not reached in the initial application, and/or herd immunity. The approach is to capitalize on advances in molecular biology, biochemistry, and immunology, and the agenda developed addresses the five genera that cause most morbidity in less-developed areas of the world: Neisseria, Streptococcus, Staphylococcus, Haemophilus, and Pseudomonas. Three strategic areas for study are emphasized: existing polysaccharide vaccines, natural immunity and pathogenesis, and evaluation of new or speculative alternative approaches. It is hoped that this agenda will stimulate the widest possible participation in this global initiative.\r"

After two decades of trial and clinical use, the role of granulocyte transfusions for therapy of serious infections has not been clearly established. The methods of harvest, storage, and transfusion of granulocytes are acceptable; however, the quantities that are obtained from donors restrict numbers of cells that may be transfused. Limited clinical response has diminished enthusiasm for the use of granulocyte transfusions as therapy, and their use as prophylaxis has been ineffective. Reported clinical data suggest that patients with persisting granulocytopenia with sepsis due to gram-negative bacteria and patients with chronic granulomatous disease with life-threatening infections unresponsive to aggressive antimicrobial therapy may benefit from granulocyte transfusions.\r"

The use of intravenous immunoglobulins in these settings is controversial because the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of this treatment are still not definitively established. Specific preparations of immunoglobulins against Pseudomonas aeruginosa for intramuscular administration have shown promising efficacy, and preparations for intravenous administration are now under investigation. Cross-protection against a wide range of gram-negative infections has been attempted by the administration of antiserum to the core glycolipid of lipopolysaccharide prepared from volunteers immunized with the J5 mutant of Escherichia coli 0111. Treatment with this preparation improved the survival rate of patients with gram-negative bacteremia and, when administered prophylactically to high-risk surgical patients, prevented shock and death related to gram-negative infections. The mechanism of protection of the J5 antiserum is not clearly understood because of our inability to measure the actual protective antibody in polyclonal J5 antiserum. Thus, the preparation of readily available cross-protective hyperimmune immunoglobulins is hampered because there is presently no method of selecting appropriate donors or high-titered plasma pools.\r"

The compromised host tends to develop infection with organisms that are frequently encountered in the normal flora. However, the results of surveillance cultures suggest that these organisms have indeed been acquired during hospitalization. This report suggests that many of these pathogens are acquired not as a result of clinically related activities but, rather, in conjunction with the \"hotel services\" of the hospital, such as the supply of food, water, and air. Tentative recommendations to hospitals for reducing the risk of infection from these services include proper design and maintenance of air-ventilating systems, regular monitoring of the water system, and preparation of foods low in microbial content for granulocytopenic patients.\r"

Granulocytopenic patients, however, are at risk for multiple infectious episodes, particularly when the duration of neutropenia is prolonged. Accordingly, the addition of one or more antimicrobial agents to the initial empiric antibiotic regimen is often necessary to deal effectively with these second infections and to help maximize the patient's chance for survival. An organized plan that incorporates modifications of the primary antibiotic regimen (e.g., the addition of another antibiotic or an antifungal agent) into the overall management of the febrile neutropenic patient is important, especially when neutropenia lasts for more than a week.\r"

Currently, four pathogenic categories of diarrheagenic E. coli are recognized: enteropathogenic (EPEC), enterotoxigenic (ETEC), enteroinvasive (EIEC), and enterohemorrhagic (EHEC). Of these, ETEC and EPEC are important causes of pediatric diarrhea, especially in developing countries. ETEC strains are characterized by their production of well-defined heat-labile or heat-stable enterotoxins. In the absence of other identifying characteristics, EPEC strains have been identified by serotyping only; recent laboratory and clinical investigations have shown that these strains constitute a distinctive group of pathogenic microorganisms displaying characteristic adherence to cultured epithelial cells and producing pathognomonic histopathologic changes in experimentally infected animals and naturally infected children. The pathogenicity of most strains of EPEC is associated with the carriage of a 55- to 70-megadalton plasmid that specifies the production of an adherence factor. EPEC strains may also owe their pathogenicity to the production of at least one enterotoxin, possibly a Shiga-like cytotoxin.\r"

Such infections are of basically two types: superficial, involving damaged or previously intact mucosae and skin; and systemic, often serious infections that may occur in the setting of depressed immunity. A broad spectrum of aquatic organisms, including viruses, bacteria, fungi, algae, and parasites, may invade the host through such extraintestinal routes as the conjunctivae, respiratory mucosae, skin, and genitalia.\r"

  ".U": "87148650\r", 
  ".W": "Yersinia enterocolitica is now the species of Yersinia most frequently isolated from human and animal infections. The species includes pathogens and ubiquitous strains. Among the human pathogens, those isolated in America are more virulent than those isolated elsewhere, especially in Europe and Japan, and these isolates differ biochemically and serologically. The relation between Y. enterocolitica and Y. pestis only became obvious in 1980 with the discovery that at 37 degrees C Y. enterocolitica requires Ca++, a phenotype described in the 1960s for Y. pestis. This requirement as well as virulence is dependent on a 70-kilobase plasmid found later in Y. pseudotuberculosis and Y. pestis. Thus, many bacteriologists elected Y. enterocolitica as a model for bacterial invasiveness. However, studies with non-American strains were impeded by the lack of an inexpensive, simple animal test, a difficulty now circumvented by supplying an appropriate siderophore to the bacteria. Ca++ dependence can be viewed as a transition between free growth and protection against the immune system. In the latter phase, Y. enterocolitica synthesizes and releases large amounts of six plasmid-encoded outer membrane proteins. Most of these are under the control of the plasmid region governing Ca++ dependence. Mutants in this region either lose the Ca++ requirement at 37 degrees C or become unable to grow at 37 degrees C irrespective of the Ca++ concentration. The complex events leading to Ca++ dependence is still not understood. Virulence in Y. enterocolitica also depends on chromosomal genes: the endocytosis in intestinal epithelial cells seems not to be encoded by the pYV plasmid. Studies of Y. pseudotuberculosis suggest that this property depends on a single chromosomal locus, the study of which might be particularly important in the understanding of the first step in infection.\r"

Manipulation of the thiolester bonds in these related proteins should permit us to understand, and ultimately to direct, the molecular mechanisms of inflammation.\r"

In the suckling mouse model, the jejunum was shown to be a major site of encystation of the parasite. Small intestinal factors were therefore tested as stimuli of encystation. An antiserum that reacted with cysts, but not with cultured trophozoites was raised in rabbits and used as a sensitive probe for differentiation in vitro. Cultured trophozoites that were exposed to bile salts showed a more than 20-fold increase in the number of oval, refractile cells that reacted strongly with anticyst antibodies, and in the expression of major cyst antigens. Exposure to primary bile salts resulted in higher levels of encystation than exposure to secondary bile salts. These studies will aid in understanding the differentiation of an important protozoan pathogen.\r"

Localization of sites for T-cell recognition on this molecule is critical for vaccine design. By using an algorithm designed to predict T-cell sites and a large panel of H-2 congenic mice, a major nonrepetitive T-cell site was located. When a synthetic peptide corresponding to this site was covalently linked to the major B-cell site on the molecule, an immunogen capable of eliciting a high-titer antibody response was formed. This peptide sequence could prime helper T cells for a secondary response to the intact CS protein. The new helper T-cell site is located outside the repetitive region of the CS protein and appears to be the immunodominant T site on the molecule. This approach should be useful in the rational design and construction of vaccines.\r"

The evidence presented here indicates that CDC25, identified by conditional cell cycle arrest mutations, encodes such an upstream function.\r"

  ".W": "It is a generally accepted principle of biology that a protein's primary sequence is the main determinant of its tertiary structure. However, the mechanism by which a protein proceeds from an unfolded, disordered state to a folded, relatively well-ordered, native conformation is obscure. Studies have been initiated to examine the \"genetics\" of protein folding, with mutants of bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI) being used to explore the nature of the specific intramolecular interactions that direct this process. Previous work with BPTI chemically modified at cysteines 14 and 38 indicated that transient disulfide bond formation by these residues contributed to efficient folding at 25 degrees C. In the present work, mutants of BPTI in which these cysteines were replaced by alanines or threonines were made and the mutant proteins were produced by a heterologous Escherichia coli expression system. At 25 degrees C in vitro, the refolding behavior of these mutants was characterized by a pronounced lag. However, when expressed at 37 degrees C in E. coli, or when refolded at 37 degrees or 52 degrees C in vitro, the mutant proteins folded readily into the native conformation, albeit at a rate somewhat slower than that exhibited by wild-type BPTI. These results indicate that, at physiological temperatures, BPTI lacking cysteines 14 and 38 can refold quantitatively.\r"

In this study, the possible interactions of these drugs were examined in vitro, and a reproducible antagonism between azidothymidine and ribavirin was found to occur under a variety of experimental conditions. The mechanism responsible for this antagonism appeared to be inhibition of azidothymidine phosphorylation by ribavirin. Because similar effects may occur in vivo, clinical trials of these two drugs in combination must be performed only under carefully controlled conditions.\r"

The Escherichia coli plasmid pAM120, which contains Tn916, was transformed into Acholeplasma laidlawii and Mycoplasma pulmonis. Transposition of Tn916 into the mycoplasma chromosome apparently occurred by an excision-insertion mechanism. This example shows that newly introduced DNA from other bacteria can be successfully expressed in mycoplasma and that Tn916 should serve as a powerful genetic tool for the study of mycoplasmas.\r"

A heterogeneous immune response for inhibition of enzyme function was noted. Catalytic activity was depressed by 50% or more with the use of 10 micrograms of IgG from 11 of 16 HIV-seropositive asymptomatic carriers, but from 0 of 8 seronegative controls and 2 of 12 patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) or the AIDS-related complex (ARC). The inhibitor was confined to the F(ab')2 fragment. It was not directed against the poly(rA) X oligo(dT) template, nor against major envelope or structural viral antigens, and did not cross-react with bacterial, avian, or other mammalian DNA polymerases. It did not correlate with recognition of polymerase antigens by radioimmunoprecipitation. Loss of this inhibitor may be associated with development of clinical disease. Ten asymptomatic HIV-seropositive carriers with high titers of IgG antibodies to reverse transcriptase were followed for a mean of 3 years. All of four lost inhibitory capability prior to development of AIDS or ARC, while titers persist in the six who remain clinically healthy.\r"

The RNAs transcribed from each DNA strand are spliced and polyadenylated, and share significant exon domains.

  ".W": "Many RNAs are complex, globular molecules formed from elements of secondary and tertiary structure analogous to those found in proteins. Little is known about recognition of RNAs by proteins. In the case of transfer RNAs (tRNAs), considerable evidence suggests that elements dispersed in both the one- and three-dimensional structure are important for recognition by aminoacyl tRNA synthetases. Fragments of alanine tRNA synthetase were created by in vitro manipulations of the cloned alaS gene and examined for their interaction with alanine-specific tRNA. Sequences essential for recognition were located near the middle of the polypeptide, juxtaposed to the carboxyl-terminal side of the domain for aminoacyl adenylate synthesis. The most essential part of the tRNA interaction strength and specificity was dependent on a sequence of fewer than 100 amino acids. Within this sequence, and in the context of the proper conformation, a segment of no more than 17 amino acids was responsible for 25% or more of the total synthetase-tRNA free energy of association. The results raise the possibility that an important part of specific RNA recognition by an aminoacyl tRNA synthetase involves a polypeptide segment that is short relative to the total size of the protein.\r"

  ".U": "87149484\r", 
  ".W": "Most observations of acute acalculus cholecystitis have been reported in patients after trauma, after unrelated surgical treatment and in critically ill patients, patient populations in whom the diagnosis of this condition is difficult. The importance of making an early diagnosis is demonstrated by the rapid development of complicated forms of cholecystitis. The results of collective reports have indicated that 40 to 100 per cent of the patients with acute acalculus cholecystitis will have advanced disease with gangrene, empyema or perforation of the gallbladder at operation. To demonstrate the importance of early suspicion and the use of sonography in making the diagnosis of this condition, a retrospective study of 40 patients with a surgical and pathologic proved diagnosis of acute acalculus cholecystitis was conducted. The fulminant nature of this disease was underscored by the fact that 70 per cent of these patients had advanced disease. Patients were divided into two groups, those who underwent operation within 48 hours of the onset of symptoms and those whose surgical treatment was delayed. Forty per cent of the patients who underwent operation more than 48 hours after the onset of symptoms had gallbladder perforation, while only 8 per cent of the patients without a delay in surgical treatment of more than 48 hours had perforations. Since advanced disease, especially perforation, carries a much higher morbidity and mortality than uncomplicated cholecystitis, making an early diagnosis is of paramount importance. Therefore, heightened awareness on the part of physicians is a key in making an early diagnosis. In 25 per cent of the patients in this study, unexplained fever was the first sign of the disease. Although most patients later presented with more classic symptoms of cholecystitis, many of these patients still presented with confusing clinical signs and symptoms leading to a delay in diagnosis due to the coexistence of the post-trauma, postsurgical or critically ill state. Ultrasound proved to be an important adjunct to the often confusing clinical clues in making an early diagnosis. Three ultrasonographic signs in the absence of stones--1, a thickened gallbladder wall; 2, an enlarged tender gallbladder, and 3, a pericholecystic collection--were suggestive of acute acalculus cholecystitis. One of these findings was present in almost 90 per cent of the patients in this study with acute acalculus cholecystitis who underwent biliary ultrasound.\r"

In contrast with polypropylene and nylon sutures, the polybutester sutures have a perceptible stretch, are more elastic and flexible, and exhibit less creep. Polybutester sutures appear to be an acceptable alternative to polypropylene and nylon sutures and their unique mechanical properties may even prove to be superior in vivo.\r"

Forty patients received a moderate dose, 4,500 rads, of radiation therapy preoperatively. Twenty-six of these patients (65 per cent) underwent protective colostomy at operation. An additional 93 patients underwent an operation without radiation and 38 of these (42 per cent) had a colostomy. We found no significant difference between patients who did or did not undergo radiation therapy in the over-all rate of complications (25 per cent for those who underwent radiation and 29 per cent for those who did not). Furthermore, there was no significant difference in anastomotic leak rates between the two groups (10 and 7 per cent respectively), even after controlling for the presence of a protective colostomy. We did find that leak rates for both groups were markedly higher for patients with a colostomy (14 per cent) than for patients without (1 per cent) (p less than 0.005). We conclude that a moderate dose of radiation therapy preoperatively does not increase the risk of anastomotic leakage or other operative complications with anterior resection. Colorectal intestinal anastomosis may be safely performed without routine colostomy after planned preoperative adjuvant radiation therapy if the anastomosis is technically satisfactory.\r"

Its diagnosis is virtually always incidental due to the absence of any clinical indication of its presence. This lesion carries a significant risk for development of subsequent invasive carcinoma which applies equally to both breasts and which appears to increase with time. The appropriate treatment of this disease remains a controversial issue. Various aspects of its epidemiology, pathology and natural history which have an important bearing on the therapeutic decision as well as the many treatment options available are analyzed herein. There is certainly a perception that lobular carcinoma in situ represent the early form of a malignant process which can be cured or prevented if appropriately treated at this stage. At the very least, an understanding of this lesion holds the potential for broadening our understanding of the physiologic basis of carcinoma of the breast as a whole.\r"

Epidemiologic studies suggest an increased incidence in homosexuals. With the exception of mucoepidermoid and small-cell carcinoma, the morphology of anal carcinoma has little influence on treatment and prognosis. Site, size of the primary lesion, and the presence of groin metastases are the crucial factors in prognosis. There is no satisfactory method for staging anal carcinoma--the symptoms are nonspecific. Diagnosis is based on histologic examination of biopsy material or tissue obtained from anal operations. The treatment of infiltrating, recurrent, or residual malignant anal lesions is a radical abdominoperineal resection. The addition of a limited obturator and hypogastric lymphadenectomy may be worthwhile. Inguinal lymphadenectomy provides palliation in the treatment of synchronous groin metastases, whereas in cases of metachronous metastases, groin dissection may result in an occasional cure. Small, noninfiltrating, low-grade anal lesions are best treated by either adequate local excision or supervoltage radiotherapy. If borne out, the promising results obtained with the combined chemoradiotherapy for anal cancer followed by local excision of the residuum will radically alter the future management of carcinoma of the anus.\r"

Cadaveric inferior vena cava, common and external iliac, common and superficial femoral, and greater saphenous veins were harvested in conjunction with multiple organ donor procedures. Identical anatomic reconstruction within the infected fields was accomplished, with patency and distal perfusion maintained for intervals sufficient to achieve complete resolution of infection in all cases. This interval of revascularization with a venous homograft has served as a temporizing maneuver, which permitted eradication of infection and allowed subsequent reimplantation of prosthetic graft material without associated reinfection in the two instances in which it was required. Use of freshly harvested large-caliber caval, iliac, and femoral homograft veins as arterial substitutes in infected fields has not been previously reported.

  ".W": "A method for determining the optimal level of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) by means of noninvasive conjunctival oxygen (PcjO2) monitoring and arterial blood gas analysis was developed from the pattern of changes in PcjO2 tension, invasive hemodynamic parameters, and oxygen transport variables during PEEP titration in a series of patients with adult respiratory distress syndrome. All patients had radial and pulmonary artery (PA) catheters inserted and blood volume was measured with 125I serum albumin before each study. During progressive increases in the level of PEEP, PcjO2 tensions reflected changes in both PaO2 and cardiac index (CI), depending on whether PEEP produced a significant decrease in CI. In patients with a stable CI, PcjO2 tensions tracked PaO2 values (rw = 0.92); in patients with a greater than a 15% decrease in CI, the conjunctival index, CjI (defined as the PcjO2/PaO2 ratio), tracked CI (rw = 0.87), excluding one patient with high cardiac output-septic shock and severe hypoxemia. PcjO2 correlated with PaO2 in the latter patient (r = 0.99) probably because conjunctival oxygen transport was limited by arterial oxygen content (PaO2 = 34 torr) rather than blood flow (CI greater than 6 L/min X m2). In patients with a greater than a 10% decrease in CI as a result of PEEP, the greater the decrease in CI, the better CjI values correlated with CI. We conclude that PcjO2 monitoring combined with repeated arterial blood gas analysis may be used to titrate PEEP therapy in patients with adult respiratory distress syndrome. In patients whose CjI significantly decreases because of PEEP, PA catheterization and measurement of cardiac output are indicated because of the likelihood of a significant (greater than 15%) decrease in CI. In the absence of a significant decrease in the CjI, optimum PEEP occurs at the level producing maximum PcjO2. It is hoped that by following the described algorithm, many patients will be spared the cost and morbidity of unnecessary PA catheterization.\r"

Two variables were measured: nasal airways resistance and the development of rhinorrhoea. Histamine had a greater effect than methacholine in increasing nasal airways resistance while the converse was true for rhinorrhoea. Rhinitic subjects had a significantly greater response to histamine induced changes in nasal airways resistance (p less than 0.05), rhinorrhoea (p less than 0.05) and methacholine induced rhinorrhoea (p less than 0.01) than those without rhinitis. No significant differences were found between the two groups in methacholine induced changes in nasal airways resistance. The findings show that, like the lower airways of patients with asthma, the nasal mucosa of rhinitic subjects shows a greater responsiveness to non-specific agonists than that of non-rhinitic subjects.\r"

Both drugs were administered by pressurised aerosol inhaler; the inhaler containing budesonide and its matching placebo were fitted with a collapsible spacer device. There was no significant difference in the control of asthma during the two six week treatment periods. There was no significant difference in FEV1 and forced vital capacity after four and six weeks of treatment or in mean morning and evening peak expiratory flow rates for the last 21 days of treatment. There was a small but statistically significant reduction in the daytime wheeze score while they were taking high dose budesonide but there was no difference for daytime activity, cough, and night symptoms. The mean basal cortisol concentrations were significantly lower after six weeks of high dose treatment than before treatment (budesonide p less than 0.01, beclomethasone p less than 0.05). There was no difference between mean basal cortisol values after six weeks of high dose treatment, and there was no effect on the rise of cortisol obtained after a short tetracosactrin test. High dose inhaled corticosteroids produced few side effects and were well tolerated.\r"

Only a prospective study of DST- and Cs-treated patients with a long-term follow-up will probably resolve the issue of the optimum regimen for one-haplotype-matched living related donor-recipient pairs. The ultimate strategy may involve the selective use of each regimen for the most appropriate circumstances.\r"

Morphometric analysis showed that the percentage cellular infiltrate at day 3 was significantly greater in enhanced than in rejecting grafts but a notable feature in the phenotypic analysis of day 5 infiltrates was a markedly reduced number of MRC OX8 positive cells (Tc/s and NK cells) in enhanced grafts. Both rejecting and enhanced allografts showed a marked induction not only of class I but also of class II MHC antigens, and quantitative absorption analysis of donor class I MHC antigens indicated that induction occurred more rapidly in enhanced grafts. Taken together, these findings suggest that blood transfusion sensitizes the recipient, resulting in a more rapid allograft response, but that even in the presence of massive MHC/antigen induction and large numbers of infiltrating cells, immunoregulatory mechanisms are able to suppress the rejection response.\r"

In order to meet this still increasing demand for organs in the future, optimal utilization of already existing resources by reduction of the wastage rate, multiple-organ procurement, and even dividing grafts is suggested. A real increase in graft supply may be achieved by creating a proper legal basis, recognition of brain death, and adoption of adequate forms of organization. In the light of the latest medical information, the justification of live donation has to be reconsidered. However, until enough organs from cadaveric donors are retrieved, kidneys may be taken from related living donors and in special situations from emotionally related persons. The concept of buying and selling organs has to be deplored for ethical reasons. The possibilities of xenografting will have to be evaluated in animal models by using modern immunosuppressive strategies.\r"

  ".W": "The AG-CDC tests were performed in parallel with C-CDC tests for studying sensitization of DST patients. Fourteen of 56 DST patients were positive by the AG-CDC tests after DST. Ten of 14 were also positive by both tests after DST. In 8 of 14 patients AG-CDC antibodies continued to be detectable even after C-CDC antibodies became undetectable as time passed and with plasmapheresis. Thus, AG-CDC tests are more sensitive compared to C-CDC tests and can extend the detection rate of DST-sensitized patients. Except for two DST patients (highly sensitized), 12 of 14 DST-sensitized patients were given transplants from specific blood donors at the time when their C-CDC tests became negative. One graft failed, another one had impaired function, and ten of them functioned. It should be noted that DST patients were transplanted successfully with or without plasmapheresis across a positive AG-CDC test if the titer was less than 1:4 at the time of transplant. All four DST recipients who developed antibodies detected only by AG-CDC tests after DST experienced severe accelerated rejections. In contrast, two of eight patients who were positive by both tests had \"severe\" accelerated rejections. The incidence of severe accelerated rejections was shown to be highly associated with the presence of AG-CDC antibodies. These facts suggest that AG-CDC antibodies may damage kidney grafts and result in severe accelerated rejections; and that AG-CDC tests are useful for predicting occurrence of severe accelerated rejections in DST recipients.\r"

  ".W": "The induction of immunologic unresponsiveness to improve renal allograft survival was attempted in 113 patients by the pretransplant administration of donor-specific whole blood or buffy coat in conjunction with continuous Aza immunosuppression. All donor/recipient combinations were at least 1-haplotype disparate and 17 were 2-haplotype disparate. Presensitization, defined as a positive Amos or antiglobulin T cell CM or a positive high-titer (greater than or equal to 1:8) B cell CM was present in 10 patients and not present in 103 patients. Attempts at desensitization of the already sensitized group were uniformly unsuccessful. Treatment of the 103 nonpresensitized patients resulted in transient sensitization in 3 patients, permanent sensitization in 8, and no evidence of sensitization in 92. Ninety-one nonsensitized patients underwent renal transplantation from the specific blood donor, and only 5 have experienced renal allograft rejection loss during a mean follow-up period of 26 months (6 to 70 months). Fifty-four percent have never experienced a rejection episode. The allograft survival rate at 2 years (91%) and 5 years (89%) is significantly better (P less than .01) than our historical experience with 1-haplotype living-related transplants at 2 years (66%) and 5 years (64%). The low rate of sensitization (8%) has permitted almost all patients to undergo eventual renal transplantation from the specific blood donor. This and the low rate of rejection (5%) argues for a modification of the immunologic response rather than a selecting out process as the mechanism for improved allograft survival.\r"

The study was conducted on two consecutive days. Ten patients were studied twice and four patients once, giving 24 studies. The total dosage of metoclopramide was 20 mg. The day on which metoclopramide was administered was chosen randomly. Whole blood cyclosporine levels were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography. Coadministration of cyclosporine with metoclopramide resulted in a significant increase in mean maximum blood concentration (567 ng/mL nu 388 ng/mL) and mean area under the blood concentration nu time curve (4120 ng X h/mL nu 3370 ng X h/mL), and a significant decrease in mean time to reach maximum concentration: The mean increase in area under the blood concentration versus time curve was 29%. No significant changes were observed in the elimination of cyclosporine when it was coadministered with metoclopramide. These observations suggest that coadministered metoclopramide increased the total absorption of cyclosporine. Metoclopramide has been shown to hasten gastric emptying; since cyclosporine is absorbed predominantly in the small intestine, coadministration of metoclopramide resulted in increased bioavailability of cyclosporine.\r"

  ".W": "The results of 61 cadaveric allografts preserved for 30 to 76 hours were analyzed to determine the effect of cold ischemia time, the method of preservation, and the type of immunosuppression on early graft viability and long-term graft survival. Preservation in cold storage up to 50 hours gave a low incidence of nonfunction (4%) and of posttransplant dialysis (20%) and a high rate of function both at 1 month (96%) and at 2 years (60%). Cold ischemia time greater than 50 hours caused a significantly increased need for dialysis (58%) but without appreciable difference in graft function at 1 month or at 2 years. Preservation by machine had no advantage over preservation by simple cold storage when the cold ischemia time was less than 50 hours. When cold ischemia time exceeded 50 hours, machine preservation was associated with a significantly reduced incidence of posttransplant dialysis but without significant differences in long-term function at 2 years. With up to 50 hours of cold ischemia and providing there was no ATN, CsA had little nephrotoxicity and gave excellent graft function at 1 month and at 2 years. However, the nephrotoxicity of CsA was markedly increased when the preservation interval exceeded 50 hours, resulting in a significantly increased rate of primary nonfunction and the need for dialysis with a significant decrease in graft function at 1 month and at 2 years. The nephrotoxicity of CsA was considerably decreased or eliminated without affecting its powerful immunosuppressive property when initial immunosuppression was begun with azathioprine with sequential conversion to CsA when graft function was fully established. It is recommended that when cold ischemia is long or when there is ATN, CsA should be used as a sequential therapy to azathioprine after graft diuresis or, alternatively, in much smaller doses as part of a combination therapy with azathioprine.\r"

Although its histogenesis and biological potential have not been entirely defined, the evidence strongly suggests a metaplastic lesion comprising immature cells which lack the capacity to invade or metastasize. Clinical signs and symptoms are nonspecific and may relate more to the coexisting abnormality than to the nephrogenic adenoma itself. Although nephrogenic adenomas may resemble certain types of urologic malignancies, their histology is distinctive and varies little from lesion to lesion so that once the entity is considered, an accurate pathologic diagnosis is rarely a problem.\r"

  ".W": "In a preliminary study of 32 women with stress urinary incontinence, a modification was added to the standard suprapubic urethropexy to decrease the incidence of postoperative urinary retention. Immediately before the elevating sutures are tied, a urethroscope is inserted into the midurethra and the bladder neck is visualized while the sutures are being tied with just enough tension to close the bladder neck. This resulted in a 100 per cent continence rate at twenty-four months and an average catheter time of 6.2 days, with 69 per cent of the patients voiding easily on the fourth postoperative day. This has resulted in a significant improvement over the length of catheter time when the urethroscope is not used, and additionally provides good experience and immediate feedback in a teaching situation for accuracy of suture placement and adequacy of bladder neck closure.\r"

  ".W": "Anejaculation is a common problem among spinal-cord injured (SCI) men. Only 1-20 per cent of SCI men can ejaculate. Methods of ejaculatory stimulation are needed to obtain sperm for artificial insemination purposes. The methods of stimulation heretofore used include intrathecal neostigmine, rectal probe electro-ejaculation, vibratory stimulation of the penis, and subcutaneous physostigmine. Ejaculatory ability increased to as much as 58 per cent using these techniques, but complications such as nausea and vomiting, elevated blood pressure, and headaches have been reported. The mechanisms of action of these techniques are poorly understood; they are believed to stimulate either reflex spinal ejaculatory centers or efferent peripheral nerves from these centers. The studies with these techniques often fail to use scientific methods of evaluation and are deficient in characterizing the subject population, description of stimulator and technique utilized, definition and presentation of \"success\" and/or complications observed. The criteria by which future studies of ejaculatory stimulation should be measured are suggested.\r"

Eighty-three patients with documented upper urinary tract calculi were evaluated for efficacy.

Overall efficacy assessments were \"good\" or \"excellent\" for 87 per cent, 72 per cent, and 85 per cent, respectively.

Aged patients with refractory anemia should be studied by utilizing red cell volume (MCV) and red cell heterogeneity (RDW). A classification with these indices initially can separate the anemias for a more fruitful investigation. By old age the anemias of hereditary red cell membrane or hemoglobin disorders should be known to the patient. In the absence of tumor, elderly patients have an increasing frequency of refractory anemias that can be called preleukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome. Morphological observations have emphasized the importance of abnormal megakaryocytes and platelets in all phases of preleukemia, and these cytologic changes should be used to guide the physician in the early diagnosis of the syndrome complex. This group of refractory anemias have a limited survival, but nonspecific marrow stimulation can be effective and should be tried. With a more complete classification of the chromosomal abnormalities in the myelodysplastic syndrome, a more accurate prognosis can be anticipated. The anemias of marrow aplasia and ineffective iron utilization (anemia of chronic disease) are found frequently in the elderly, and the physician may offer more effective therapy by an early diagnosis.\r"

The therapy of each differs depending on the cause, the principal of which are drugs (for the acquired form), excessive sympathetic activity (for the congenital form), and a variety of causes for the miscellaneous group. The long Q-T interval, ascribable in some cases to pathologic disparity of durations of the excited state, aggravated under certain conditions by increased sympathetic activity transmitted through the stellate ganglia and sympathetic cardiac nerves, are at present the most probable electrical sources of arrhythmogenesis in the LQTS. However, there are other possibilities for the development of threshold potentials during the Q-T and Q-U intervals (regarding the U wave as part of the myocardial recovery process). These include minor deviations in the time or site of ventricular activation, the onset of recovery before excitation is completed, physiologic and pathologic displacements of the S-T segment (large ventricular gradient), desynchronized depolarization and repolarization, principally endocardial (in ischemic heart disease), early afterdepolarization with arrested repolarization, and late afterdepolarization following a slow diastolic wave that may be related to the U wave. Although the basis for some of these possibilities has been observations made at the membrane level principally on the canine Purkinje fiber, evidence for the clinical validity of some has accumulated in isolated examples. It is likely that additional clinical proof will be forthcoming, and with it additional means of managing the malignant ventricular arrhythmias encountered in the long Q-T syndromes. A number of drugs with the desired selective actions are under active investigation.\r"

NRH of the liver is an established pathologic entity that should not be confused with focal nodular hyperplasia, hepatocellular adenoma, or the regenerative nodules associated with cirrhosis. Correct diagnosis will prevent an unnecessary hepatic lobectomy should NRH be mistaken for hepatocellular adenoma. Unlike focal nodular hyperplasia, NRH may bleed, may be associated with portal hypertension in one-half of cases, and is often associated with a systemic disease such as a myelo- or lymphoproliferative disorder. Correct diagnosis is important because the prognosis in patients with NRH and portal hypertension is better than that in patients with portal hypertension due to cirrhosis. Radiologically, multiple nodules, large masses, or an apparently normal liver (containing nodules less than 0.5 cm in diameter) were visible. The nodules may take up technetium sulfur colloid and have variable echogenicity on sonography. They are often hypodense on CT without significant enhancement. The nodules may fill from the periphery on angiography, are vascular, and sometimes contain small hypovascular areas due to hemorrhage. A large nodule may rupture and cause hemoperitoneum. These findings may resemble some features of focal nodular hyperplasia, hepatocellular adenoma, or metastases. NRH is probably underdiagnosed owing to a lack of recognition of the entity and limited sampling of liver tissue by needle biopsy. Scintigraphy, sonography, and CT of the liver should be performed in cases of idiopathic portal hypertension to detect NRH. In cases with compatible findings, multiple needle biopsies or a laparoscopically guided needle biopsy or wedge liver biopsy should be recommended for definitive diagnosis.\r"

The other 40 were found to have single or multiple, small (less than 2-cm), low-density lesions. In 33 patients these were proven to be benign hepatic cysts by sonography, follow-up CT, or clinical course. The initial CT interpretations in these patients had been metastatic disease in seven (21%), benign cysts in five (15%), and indeterminate in 21 (64%). Since the distinction between cysts and metastases has important clinical implications, sonography should be used whenever the true nature of these lesions cannot be determined by CT.\r"

Radiologic findings of seven patients with histologically proven xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis were reviewed retrospectively.

Four had nonopacified gallbladder, and one had stenosis of the proximal part of the common bile duct. Marked thickening of the gallbladder wall was seen in six of seven cases on CT. In one case the thickened wall was lobulated and irregular. The border between the gallbladder and the adjacent liver was unclear in two and relatively clear in five. Four patients underwent angiography to evaluate the possibility of tumor. Two of them had irregularity and stenosis of the cystic artery highly suggestive of carcinoma. The other two showed only dilatation of the cystic artery. On the basis of all radiologic studies, carcinoma was diagnosed preoperatively in two of the seven cases. Radiologically, xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis may best be regarded as a tumor-like condition and should be included in the differential diagnosis of gallbladder cancer.\r"

  ".W": "The increasing use and availability of renal transplantation has resulted in a demand for noninvasive methods to study possible complications. One of the most serious adverse reactions is acute rejection, a possibly reversible cause of transplant failure if treated promptly. Differentiation from other causes of acute renal failure frequently is difficult, and the lack of specificity in many imaging studies has been troublesome. Eighty-one patients with renal transplants, including 41 with acute rejection, were examined. Duplex Doppler examination of the intrarenal arteries and a simplified formula, the resistive index ([peak systolic frequency shift--lowest diastolic frequency shift]/[peak systolic frequency shift]), were used to diagnose rejection. With a resistive index greater than 0.90, a 100% positive predictive value was obtained for the diagnosis of acute rejection. A value less than 0.70 was unlikely to be rejection (negative predictive value, 94%). This approach uses a simple analysis of the waveform. Use of a duplex Doppler examination and the formula described here appears to be an accurate method for the detection of acute rejection and for the differentiation of acute rejection from the various other causes of acute renal failure.\r"

Six cases showed a slight decrease in uterine echogenicity. One case had sonographic findings suggestive of a calcified leiomyoma. The diagnosis of adenomyosis cannot be made conclusively by sonography. However, it can be suggested if the uterus is slightly enlarged and if the posterior portion of the myometrium is anechoic and thickened.\r"

Serial two-dimensional echocardiograms were performed during the hospital stay and patients were followed clinically for systemic emboli for 1 month after discharge from the hospital. Thirty-one percent of patients in group I (4/13) and 35% of patients in group II (6/17) developed LV thrombi on two-dimensional echocardiograms. There was no statistical difference in the incidence of LV thrombi between the two groups (p greater than 0.05). Infarct size as determined by creatine phosphokinase isoenzymes (2,386 +/- 1,568 vs 2,083 +/- 1,462 IU for groups I and II, respectively; p greater than 0.05), wall motion score (12.7 +/- 5 vs 10.7 +/- 5 for groups I and II, respectively; p greater than 0.05) and wall motion index (1.8 +/- 0.6 vs 1.8 +/- 0.56 for groups I and II, respectively; p greater than 0.05) were not statistically different between the two groups of patients. One patient in both groups had an embolic event. In conclusion, prophylactic anticoagulation in high-risk AMI patients for LV thrombus development does not prevent LV thrombus formation during the acute and subacute stages of an AMI. The results also suggest that anticoagulation may not prevent systemic embolization.\r"

  ".W": "To examine the effects of chronic oral therapy with verapamil, 120 mg three times a day, and nifedipine, 20 mg four times daily, on left ventricular ejection fraction and regional wall motion at rest and exercise, 10 patients with chronic stable angina pectoris underwent serial rest and exercise radionuclide angiography. Pre drug control study revealed a resting left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 0.62 +/- 0.08, falling to 0.54 +/- 0.12 at peak exercise (p less than 0.05). Wall motion score deteriorated from a resting value of 13.8 +/- 2.3 to 10.6 +/- 1.8 (p less than 0.01) with exercise. Patients were subsequently randomized to verapamil or nifedipine for 4 weeks each in an open-labeled crossover design. Rest and exercise radionuclide angiography were repeated at the end of each 4-week period. Neither verapamil nor nifedipine had a significant effect on resting LVEF (verapamil LVEF = 0.61 +/- 0.10, nifedipine LVEF = 0.64 +/- 0.02). Likewise, they had no significant effect on resting wall motion score (verapamil = 14.2 +/- 2.2, nifedipine = 14.4 +/- 1.6). Both verapamil and nifedipine significantly increased LVEF at peak exercise (verapamil = 0.63 +/- 0.09, nifedipine = 0.65 +/- 0.08, p less than 0.05 vs pre drug control) and improved peak exercise wall motion score (verapamil = 13 +/- 1.9, nifedipine = 13.8 +/- 1.6, p less than 0.05 vs pre drug control). Both drugs significantly reduced maximal ST depression at peak exercise and prolonged exercise duration. Episodes of angina and nitroglycerin use were also significantly reduced. In summary, verapamil and nifedipine improved left ventricular performance at exercise in patients with angina pectoris.\r"

Primary malignancy of the pericardium is rare, whereas secondary tumor involvement of the pericardium is more frequently observed. The common secondary solid tumors involving the pericardium are from lung and breast carcinomas; of the nonhematologic malignancies, lymphomas and leukemias are most frequent. A high index of suspicion in patients with malignancy, along with a history, physical examination, x-ray films, ECG, and echocardiography, will often make the diagnosis in a hemodynamically compromised patient. Occasionally, cardiac catheterization and pericardial biopsy are necessary to differentiate malignant pericardial disease from radiation pericarditis and restrictive heart disease. Therapy is dependent on the underlying condition and includes pericardiectomy, chemotherapy to obliterate the pericardial space, and external beam radiotherapy. These therapies are all palliative, but provide months of hemodynamic relief. The underlying prognosis of malignant pericardial disease remains grave.\r"

A pooled analysis of 10 randomized trials involving a total of 14,355 patients was performed to look for overall trends in the change in mortality within 6 weeks (group A) and after 6 weeks (group B) of follow-up, and the change in LV function. All 10 trials, 7 with IC and 3 with IV SK, were randomized after 1980. There was a significant reduction in mortality risk in patients in group A treated with IV SK (pooled odds ratio = 0.81, 95% confidence interval = 0.73 to 0.90, p less than 0.001). In contrast, no significant differences in mortality were detected in patients in group B treated with IV SK or in patients in either group treated with IC SK. Two IV SK trials that prospectively stratified patient population according to duration of symptoms showed a greater reduction in mortality with administration of SK therapy within 3 hours of onset of symptoms. Analysis of LV function was performed before, within 96 hours after and 1 to 4 weeks after SK therapy. Only 2 of 7 IC SK trials showed significantly greater improvement in global LV ejection fraction in SK group compared with a control group, both showing improvement in LV function between early and late after treatment. Thus, IV SK therapy significantly reduces short-term risk of death after acute myocardial infarction; 2 trials show a greater reduction in mortality risk with earlier institution of IV SK therapy.\r"

To determine which patients are most likely to benefit from such therapy, the effects of patient age, reperfusion success, admission left ventricular (LV) function, infarct location, admission clinical class, time from onset of pain to reperfusion and admission electrocardiographic findings on the outcome of coronary reperfusion in AMI were assessed in 292 prospectively studied, sequential patients from August 1980 to January 1984. Two hundred ten patients received intracoronary streptokinase (SK) therapy on admission and 82 patients, who either refused the protocol or met exclusion criteria, served as control subjects. Patients older than 65 years showed little improvement in 1-year mortality risk and no significant improvement in LV function during hospitalization after treatment with intracoronary SK. The remaining patients, 178 treated with SK and 48 control, were well matched and served as the basis for further comparisons. In this subgroup of patients, reperfusion success was associated with improved survival and LV function (mortality rate 3%, vs 17% in control subjects; increase in ejection fraction [EF] 18% vs 4%). Patients with an EF of less than 45% on admission showed a 21 +/- 30% increase in EF, compared with an increase in control subjects of 8 +/- 19%, and a lower 1-year mortality rate than controls (6% vs 21%, p = 0.01). Patients with anterior AMI had a significant increase in EF in the SK group (22 +/- 31%) and lower mortality compared with control subjects (5% vs 25%, p = 0.003).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

All patients received placebo for 2 to 4 weeks, followed by either study drug during the double-blind phase, titrated over 8 weeks to achieve a goal of supine diastolic BP reduction of at least 10 mm Hg and/or a diastolic BP of less than 90 mm Hg. Patients not achieving the treatment goal with either drug alone received the other drug in combination. Both drugs produced significant decreases in supine and upright BP throughout the 26-week study. The magnitude of decrease in mean supine diastolic BP was similar for both drugs as monotherapy at week 14 (-11.4 and -12.1 mm Hg, respectively). Hydrochlorothiazide produced significantly greater reductions at week 14 in mean supine systolic BP than sustained-release diltiazem (-19.5 and -12.7 mm Hg, respectively). The difference in mean supine diastolic BP reduction with the 2 drugs diminished when hydrochlorothiazide (50 mg/day) was compared with sustained-release diltiazem. The BP effects were sustained for 6 months with both drugs. The 2 drugs appeared to lower BP more in patients older than 60 years and more in black than in white patients. The combination of the 2 drugs decreased supine diastolic BP to goal levels in about 56% of the patients not achieving goal with either drug alone. Adverse effects were minimal with either drug alone and in combination, except for hypokalemia, which increased with thiazide alone and in combination.\r"

Computer densitometric analysis (CDA) of digital subtraction angiography offers the potential for calculation of EF, independent of LV shape, by comparing summated brightness for regions of interest at end diastole and end systole. Therefore, the accuracy of CDA was validated for 2 mechanical heart models of differing geometry, spherical and rectangular. Both models confirmed the close correlation between calculated and measured EF (r = 0.98 and r = 0.99, respectively). Subsequently, the CDA was compared with single and biplane area-length EF calculations in 72 patients, half with a previous myocardial infarction. In patients without previous myocardial infarction, CDA correlated closely with both single-plane and biplane EF (r = 0.91 and 0.93, respectively). The close correlation was maintained regardless of whether CDA was applied to direct LV injection or intravenous digital subtraction angiography. However, in 36 patients with previous myocardial infarction, CDA correlated less closely with single-plane (r = 0.74) than with biplane (r = 0.86) area-length EF. Thus, CDA permits calculation of EF without geometric assumptions, and may be superior to the area-length method in patients with LV dyssynergy after myocardial infarction.\r"

  ".W": "To change the stretch on cardiopulmonary mechanoreceptors, large shifts of blood in the capacity space were elicited by tilting and by exerting positive lower body pressure in the tilted position. Twelve volunteers underwent invasive hemodynamic studies and in 10 other subjects cardiac size was determined by radionuclide cardiography. In all 22 subjects tilting caused the expected increase of renin, which was abolished by lower body compression. Decompression caused renin to increase again. Right atrial pressure in invasive studies and end-systolic and end-diastolic counts in noninvasive studies showed a significant and strong negative correlation with renin and norepinephrine levels. Thus, the degree of stretch of the cardiopulmonary mechanoreceptors is a major determinant of reflex regulation of renin release in humans.\r"

  ".W": "Mitral regurgitation (MR) is common in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF), but the frequency in relation to the origin of ventricular dilatation has not been established. In 50 patients referred for cardiac transplantation, MR was assessed by Doppler echocardiography and the findings were compared with clinical information. Dilatation of the left ventricle, left atrium and mitral anulus was analyzed in 25 patients with respect to cause of CHF. All 50 patients had MR of at least moderate severity, regardless of cause (idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy in 36, coronary artery disease in 14), length of symptoms (20 +/- 19 months, less than 6 months in 13 patients) or presence of murmurs (absent in 13 patients). Comparison of patients with nonischemic cardiomyopathy to those with ischemic heart disease revealed larger left ventricular volumes (215 +/- 81 vs 131 +/- 60 ml in systole, p less than 0.05) and left atrial volumes (124 +/- 70 vs 70 +/- 35 ml, p less than 0.05). Mitral anular dilatation was present only in patients with idiopathic cardiomyopathy (diameters 3.6 +/- 0.4 vs 3.1 +/- 0.2 cm, p less than 0.05). The frequency of significant MR in these patients with CHF suggests that it may have a major role in decompensation and in the therapeutic response.\r"
