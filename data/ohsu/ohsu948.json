  ".W": "We tested the hypothesis that the administration of nitrous oxide (N2O) causes major (e.g., myocardial infarction, neuronal injury, hypoxemia, infection, death) or minor (e.g., nausea, vomiting, headache, earache) untoward effects in patients requiring anesthesia for 1.5-4 h. Given the higher morbidity and mortality associated with aging, we also tested whether aging increased any untoward effect of N2O. Finally, we investigated whether the substitution of N2O for a fraction of the anesthesia supplied by isoflurane altered the latter's pharmacologic effects. We studied 270 patients scheduled for elective total hip arthroplasty (n = 100), carotid endarterectomy (n = 70), or transsphenoidal hypophysectomy (n = 100) who were randomly assigned within each surgical group to receive isoflurane with or without 60% N2O. Regardless of patient age, we found no difference in major or minor untoward outcomes between anesthetic groups, nor a trend to suggest that a larger data cohort would reveal a significant adverse effect of N2O. The addition of N2O administration decreased the isoflurane requirement for clinical anesthesia but did not alter most of the clinical variables measured in practice, including blood pressure, heart rate, rate of recovery from anesthesia, development of postoperative pain, patient satisfaction with anesthesia, or duration of anesthesia or of hospitalization. Patients given N2O were no more likely to dream during anesthesia, remember events during anesthesia, or be frightened by those events. Our results support the continued use of N2O to anesthetize patients for elective surgery.\r"

To assess whether relatively prolonged anesthesia with N2O in normal patients might similarly cause untoward effects, we investigated whether the addition of N2O to isoflurane anesthesia caused injury to patients having surgical resection of acoustic neuroma lasting approximately 10 h. Twenty-six patients undergoing surgical resection of acoustic neuroma were randomly assigned to a regimen that included or excluded N2O (50%-60%) during isoflurane anesthesia plus intravenous adjuvants. On average, slightly less isoflurane (0.24%) was used during anesthesia with N2O. We measured standard clinical variables (blood pressure, heart rate), oxygen saturation, neurologic status, pain, and the incidence and type of morbid outcomes. Exposure to N2O did not increase the incidence of morbid outcomes (including hepatic injury, infection, or hypoxemia), prolong hospitalization, or increase common postoperative complaints such as nausea, vomiting, coughing, or headache. Patients anesthetized with either regimen were equally satisfied with their anesthetic.\r"

All other aspects of anesthetic management were similar, except for greater concentrations of oxygen and isoflurane in patients not given N2O. Perioperative monitoring for myocardial ischemia and infarction included 12- or 5-lead electrocardiography, transesophageal echocardiography, and creatine kinase isoenzyme levels. By transesophageal echocardiographic or electrocardiographic criteria, 44% of patients given oxygen but only 21% of those given N2O had myocardial ischemia intraoperatively (P = 0.065). Similarly, myocardial infarction, identified by changes in creatine kinase isoenzymes, occurred in only one patient given N2O but in three given oxygen (not significantly different). Thus we found no trend indicating a greater incidence of myocardial ischemia or infarction associated with the use of N2O.\r"

One hundred patients having transsphenoidal hypophysectomy were randomly assigned to receive anesthesia including (n = 49) or excluding (n = 51) N2O. All patients were given an injection of epinephrine 1:200,000, with 0.5% lidocaine to produce hemostasis. Using intermittent 12-lead and continuous lead II electrocardiography, we determined the incidence of premature ventricular contraction, isorhythmic atrioventricular (AV) dissociation, and changes in T-wave morphology. Patients given N2O had a significantly higher incidence of isorhythmic AV dissociation (61.2% vs 41.2%). A trend toward a higher incidence of multiple premature ventricular contractions (16.3% vs 7.8%) was not statistically significant. Both anesthetic groups had a high incidence of postoperative changes in T-wave morphology (46.9% in the N2O group vs 50.9% in the group not given N2O). Aging alone did not affect the incidence of ventricular ectopic beats, isorhythmic AV dissociation, or changes in electrocardiographic morphology, but correlated with the development of ventricular ectopy during N2O anesthesia. We conclude that the use of N2O correlated with a higher incidence of isorhythmic AV dissociation in response to injection of epinephrine with lidocaine.\r"

We tested whether surgical patients (23 having total hip replacements and 26 having resection of acoustic neuromas) exposed to isoflurane alone or combined with N2O responded similarly. We found no increase in urinary formic acid and FIGLU in patients exposed to N2O for hip replacement, but a small, transient increase in the FIGLU-to-creatinine ratio in those undergoing resection of acoustic neuromas (mean duration of anesthesia = 9.3 h). This increase peaked at the end of anesthetic exposure and returned toward control levels by the first day after anesthesia and surgery. Low preoperative levels of red blood cell folate and low-normal levels of serum vitamin B12 did not predict an increase in formic acid or FIGLU in response to N2O. Although an occasional patient may prove highly susceptible to and develop signs of severe vitamin B12 and folic acid deficiency after exposure to N2O, our findings suggest that this is a rare event.\r"

Nitrous oxide did not affect the production of red blood cells or platelets. Nitrous oxide treatment was associated with an increase in postoperative leukocyte levels that was modestly but significantly smaller than that found in patients not given nitrous oxide.

Ten patients with a two- or three-vessel coronary artery disease, all treated with the beta-adrenergic blocker metoprolol because of severe stable angina pectoris, performed two identical exercise stress tests, the first without TEA (control exercise) and the second with TEA (TEA exercise). Before each stress test, intravenous metoprolol was given to achieve maximal or near maximal beta-adrenoceptor blockade. Systolic and diastolic arterial pressures (radial artery cannula), heart rate, and rate-pressure product, as well as global and regional ejection fractions, using equilibrium radionuclide angiography in the left anterior oblique projection, were measured at rest and during maximal exercise. ST-segment analysis (V3 or V5) was performed, and the regional wall motion score was calculated at control exercise and TEA exercise. Intravenous metoprolol or intravenous metoprolol plus TEA at rest did not cause any significant changes of any of the variables. During TEA exercise, systolic arterial pressure, diastolic arterial pressure, and rate-pressure product, but not heart rate, were significantly lower compared to control exercise. The global and anterolateral ejection fractions were significantly higher (52.8% versus 46.5% and 53.2% versus 46.0%, respectively, P less than 0.05), and the regional wall motion score was significantly lower (8.8 versus 11.8, P less than 0.01) during TEA exercise than during control exercise. ST-segment depression was significantly lower during TEA exercise (-1.03 versus -1.84 mV, P less than 0.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Adenosine, a potent vasodilator both in animals and in humans, has been used to produce controlled hypotension in patients, especially during cerebral aneurysm surgery. However, in animals adenosine by intrarenal infusion decreases renal blood flow (RBF), glomerular filtration rate (GFR), urine flow, and causes an inhibition of renin secretion. In this study we evaluated the effect of adenosine on RBF in patients (n = 15) scheduled for cerebral aneurysm surgery who had been anesthetized with a modified neurolept-anesthesia during controlled hyperventilation. Perioperative hypotension was achieved with infusion of adenosine (252.8 +/- 55.8 micrograms.kg-1.min-1) (n = 8) or sodium nitroprusside (2.5 +/- 0.8 micrograms.kg-1.min-1) (n = 7). Mean arterial pressure was lowered by 25%-30%, to approximately 60-70 mm Hg, in both groups. Glomerular filtration rate and RBF were measured using standard renal clearance methods for 51Cr-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid and paraaminohippuric acid. Urine and blood samples were collected during normotension before and after a bolus dose of hypertonic mannitol, during hypotension, and during normotension after clipping of the aneurysm. Adenosine induced a marked decrease in GFR (-91%) and RBF (-92%), and a pronounced increase in renal vascular resistance. Sodium nitroprusside caused a significantly (P less than 0.01) less pronounced decrease in GFR (-24%) and RBF (-36%), but did not affect renal vascular resistance. After discontinuation of the hypotensive agents, GFR returned to baseline levels in both groups. Renal blood flow, however, increased above baseline after discontinuation of adenosine (+93%) but not after sodium nitroprusside. Sodium nitroprusside increased renin secretion, which was not seen with adenosine. Four patients in the adenosine group developed reversible atrioventricular conduction disturbances.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The effect of left ventricular infusion of protamine on pulmonary hypertension as well as a possible role of platelet-activating factor (PAF) or histamine in the heparin-protamine reaction was investigated in 30 pigs in four different groups during general anesthesia. Group 1 animals received 250 IU/kg heparin, followed by 100 mg protamine intravenously after 15 min. In group 2 protamine was infused into the left ventricle. Group 3 animals received the histamine H1- and H2-antagonists clemastine and ranitidine 5 min before protamine infusion. In group 4 the PAF receptor blocker WEB 2086 was given 5 min before protamine. Platelet-activating factor was measured by a bioassay in serum samples of group 1 and group 4 animals. In all four groups protamine caused severe pulmonary hypertension, thromboxane A2 release, and a transient decrease in leukocyte counts. No PAF release was detected after protamine infusion. Neither left ventricular infusion of protamine nor histamine or PAF antagonists prevented or attenuated the reactions after protamine infusion. The authors conclude that left ventricular infusion of protamine provides no protection from pulmonary hypertension, and that histamine and PAF are not involved in the acute pulmonary vasoconstriction after protamine neutralization of heparin.\r"

Twenty patients were randomly assigned to receive either 2 mg/kg propofol in 5 min followed by 9 mg.kg-1.h-1 for 30 min and 4.5 mg.kg-1.h-1 until skin closure, or 0.42 mg/kg midazolam in 5 min followed by 0.125 mg.kg-1.h-1 until skin closure. Simultaneously, a variable-rate infusion of alfentanil was given. Patients were ventilated with 30% oxygen in air. In both groups blood pressure and heart rate decreased significantly (P less than 0.02) and to a similar extent during induction. The total dose of alfentanil was similar in both groups.

  ".W": "Previous studies have demonstrated that, with the exception of atracurium, resistance to the neuromuscular blocking effects of various muscle relaxants develops in patients receiving anticonvulsant therapy. We studied the effects of 0.5 mg/kg IV atracurium in 53 neurosurgical patients: 21 nonepileptic patients receiving no anticonvulsant therapy (MED = 0); 14 epileptic patients treated with carbamazepine for years (MED = 1); and 18 epileptic patients treated with carbamazepine plus either phenytoin or valproic acid for years (MED = 2). The evoked compound electromyogram of the adductor pollicis brevis was recorded, and results were analyzed using analysis of covariance, with weight and age as covariables. The onset time was not significantly different among the three groups. Times for recovery of baseline and train-of-four responses to stimuli were significantly shorter in the MED = 1 and MED = 2 groups than in control patients (MED = 0). The recovery index (time between 25% and 75% recovery of baseline electromyogram values) was progressively shorter in the three groups (MED = 0: 8.02 min; MED = 1: 5.93 min; MED = 2: 1.96 min; P less than 0.001). This study demonstrates that atracurium, when used on epileptic patients requiring long-term (that is, years of) anticonvulsant therapy, has a shorter duration of action than when used in nonepileptic patients.\r"

  ".W": "Forty-five patients were evaluated during knee arthroscopy performed using local anesthesia produced by lidocaine with epinephrine to determine the dose-response relationship for operative analgesia. Serum lidocaine concentrations were also measured. Patients were randomized prospectively to receive 20 mL of 0.5%, 1.0%, or 1.5% lidocaine with epinephrine intraarticularly. Intraoperative discomfort was measured by verbal response on an 11-point linear pain scale. Pain scores were significantly higher in patients receiving 0.5% lidocaine during the first 45 min of surgery (P = 0.03). After 45 min, pain scores continued to be higher in the 0.5% lidocaine group than in the 1.0% or 1.5% groups, but the differences were not statistically significant. Ninety-four percent of patients in the 1.5% lidocaine group were willing to repeat this anesthetic technique for surgery compared with 83% of those in the 1.0% lidocaine group and 75% of those in the 0.5% lidocaine group (P greater than 0.05). The duration of postoperative analgesia was similar in all groups. Serum lidocaine concentrations before and 15, 30, 60, and 120 min after instillation of lidocaine were highest in the 1.5% lidocaine group with a peak concentration of 278 ng/mL. No patient had symptoms of lidocaine toxicity. We recommend that lidocaine concentrations of 1.0% or 1.5% be used when 20 mL is instilled intraarticularly for knee arthroscopy based on patient comfort and absence of lidocaine toxicity.\r"

Heart rate (P less than 0.01), systolic blood pressure (P less than 0.02), and rate-pressure product (P less than 0.01) increased significantly during extubation of the control group. All doses of esmolol attenuated the increases in heart rate, but 1 mg/kg was insufficient to control the increase in systolic blood pressure. Doses of 1.5 and 2 mg/kg controlled both systolic blood pressure and heart rate, but the larger dose produced significant decreases in systolic blood pressure.\r"

Fetal heart rate was measured 15 min before and 15 min after lidocaine epidural analgesia, and for 60 min at 5-min intervals after administration of epidural fentanyl/placebo. A perinatologist blinded to the injected epidural solution analyzed FHR tracings. Epidural injections of fentanyl and saline, when given during established epidural lidocaine analgesia, were associated with equal reductions in FHR variability and the frequency of FHR accelerations (P less than 0.003). Neonatal outcome was also similar in both groups. The clinical significance, if any, of these moderate reductions in FHR during epidural lidocaine analgesia is unclear.\r"

Logistically, minimum flows of TRIO (Vmin) are desirable for field use and to reduce barotrauma should airway obstruction occur. We carried out a feasibility study to determine the efficacy of Vmin of TRIO delivered within 1 cm of the carina, in nine anesthetized and paralyzed dogs. Minimum flows of TRIO for these dogs of average weight (12 kg) was 91 mL/min. In six of the dogs Vmin TRIO was continued and provided oxygenation for an average of 1.5 h compatible with subsequent resuscitation with conventional ventilation. However, PaCO2 levels increased to mean values of 256 mm Hg in the 90 min. To determine what the effect of increased gas mixing was on gas exchange, we repeated Vmin TRIO for 10 min in six of the dogs with and without high frequency oscillations superimposed on the TRIO flow. The oscillations (60 mL at 16.3 Hz) increased carbon dioxide excretion but significantly impaired oxygenation. In completely apneic animals, TRIO at low flow delivered by cricothyroidotomy may be useful as an emergency procedure when upper airway obstruction limits the use of other airway management techniques. However, enhancement of gas mixing during low-flow TRIO impairs oxygenation, so that higher flows would be required when respiratory efforts occur.\r"

  ".W": "Inadequate airway maintenance has been a major factor in perioperative morbidity. To determine the incidence and etiology of emergency tracheal intubations in the postanesthesia care unit (PACU), we retrospectively reviewed 13,593 consecutive admissions to our PACU from October 1986 through October 1988. Twenty-six patients (26/13,593 = 0.19%) required the insertion of an endotracheal tube while in the PACU. Seventy-seven percent (20/26) of the intubations occurred within 1 h of extubation and/or admission to the PACU. Intubation was more common at the extremes of age; 54% of those intubated were more than 60 yr old (P = 0.003); 19% were less than 3 yr old (P less than 0.05). Twenty-three percent of the intubated patients had undergone otolaryngologic procedures (P = 0.008). Interestingly, 73% of the intubations occurred during the months of January through June (P = 0.016). Median PACU admission scores were lower for the intubated group (P less than 0.001). There was no association between intubation and gender (P = 0.74), anesthetic technique (P = 0.41), or anesthetic agent (P = 0.49). Of the 26 intubations, 18 (69%) were considered to be directly related to anesthetic management. Despite the extremely low incidence of emergency tracheal intubation in a heterogeneous group of patients admitted to our PACU, preventable anesthesia-related etiologic factors including excessive sedative or anesthetic effect, inappropriate fluid management, persistent muscle relaxant effect, and upper airway obstruction contributed to the majority of these intubations.\r"

The maximal recovery of 96.9 +/- 2.6% was obtained at a pH of less than 1. Cyanide recovery from plasma, however, peaked at a pH between 7 and 8, and further changes in pH reduced the recovery rate. The maximal recovery rate from plasma was 74.1 +/- 1.5%. In previous studies, cyanide isolations from both plasma and red blood cells were carried out at a pH of less than 1. This study shows that cyanide isolation from plasma should be performed at a pH between 7 and 8.\r"

  ".W": "To investigate the hemodynamic correlates of perioperative regional wall motion abnormalities (RWMA), we measured wall motion continuously via transesophageal echocardiography (TEE), and related RWMA to continuously measured hemodynamic indices of myocardial oxygen supply and demand (heart rate [HR] and systemic and pulmonary arterial blood pressures). Fifty patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery were studied throughout the prebypass postbypass, and intensive care unit (ICU) periods. Only 28% of TEE episodes (RWMA suggestive of ischemia) were preceded by acute changes in any hemodynamic parameter. Specifically, 7% of TEE episodes were preceded by increases in HR (20% deviation from control), 14% by increases in systolic blood pressure (SBP), 13% by decreases in diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and 9% by increases in pulmonary artery diastolic pressure (PAD). Twelve per cent of TEE episodes were associated with increases in rate-pressure product (RPP) to greater than 12,000, and 27% were associated with decreases in mean arterial pressure (MAP)/HR to less than 1 at the onset of TEE episodes. Comparison among periods revealed that postbypass TEE episodes were more frequently associated with either increases in demand or decreases in supply than were prebypass episodes (53% vs. 25%, P less than 0.05). ECG ischemic episodes also were infrequently (30%) associated with acute changes in HR, SBP, DBP, or PAD. We conclude that perioperative TEE episodes are infrequently triggered by changes in hemodynamics, suggesting that a primary decrease in myocardial oxygen supply may be an important mechanism for most perioperative RWMA. In addition, neither pulmonary artery catheter pressure measurements nor specialized indices (RPP and MAP/HR) appear to be useful in predicting TEE episodes.\r"

  ".W": "To test the hypothesis that there are important differences between studies on memory published in anesthesia literature and those published in the psychopharmacology literature, we compared the two from the period January 1978 through May 1988 to identify deficiencies in the design and methodologies used and to provide guidelines for future experiments. Eight-eight articles in each discipline were reviewed. The sample sizes were larger in the articles in anesthesia journals than in those in psychopharmacology journals (medians 52.5 vs. 18 subjects, respectively). Most (85%) of the studies in the anesthesia literature used patients, who had a median age of 38.9 yr and included a median of 28 women among the subjects per study. In contrast, the majority (60%) of the studies in the psychopharmacology literature used healthy volunteers, who had a median age of 23.6 yr and included a median of only 3.5 females among the subjects per study. Characteristics more common in the psychopharmacology than in the anesthesia literature, respectively, were use of a control or placebo group (90% vs. 42%), double-blind design (80% vs. 47%), use of pre- and posttreatment memory measurements (64% vs. 23%), use of multiple memory tests with distinct equated stimuli (83% vs. 8%), relation of methodology to some theoretical model of memory (72% vs. 17%), and use of other behavioral tests (68% vs. 48%). Relative to the psychopharmacology literature, the anesthesia literature used pictures as stimuli for the memory tests more often (44% vs. 14%, respectively) and words less often (11% vs. 67%) and relied heavily on questions about recall of perioperative events (41% vs. 0%). There is room for improvement in both types of literature, and more so in the anesthesia literature.\r"

  ".W": "Slowing and attenuation of the dominant frequency of the electroencephalogram (EEG) are changes commonly used to detect cerebral ischemia. To assess the validity of this method, the EEGs recorded during 93 episodes of circulatory arrest in ten normothermic, lightly anesthetized patients undergoing implantation of automatic internal cardioverting defibrillators (AICDs) were visually inspected for change. The number of events recorded for each patient varied from 5 to 18 and was a function of the duration and success of AICD testing in each patient. In 82 of 93 (88%) episodes, EEG changes were identified, and occurred an average of 10.2 s after the last normal heart beat. Of these 82, 67 (82%) illustrated slowing and attenuation. However, 15 (18%) of the hemodynamic events showed changes not previously described as indicative of cerebral ischemia: 6 (7%) showed a loss of delta-wave activity and 9 (11%) showed an increase in the amplitude of theta activity. Time to onset of these unusual changes (10.6 and 9.2 s, respectively) was not significantly different from that for EEG slowing and attenuation (10.2 s). Five of the ten subjects showed more than one pattern of EEG change. There was no significant difference in the time to onset of EEG change among individual patients, and neither were there differences in patterns of change associated with particular anesthetic agents. These results indicate that in normothermic, lightly anesthetized individuals, cerebral ischemia may cause changes in EEG pattern other than slowing and attenuation of dominant frequencies. These alternative patterns should be recognized as indicative of cerebral ischemia when intraoperative EEG monitoring is performed.\r"

A blinded observer noted the child's level of sedation, the quality of separation from parents, and the degree of cooperation with an inhalation induction of anesthesia. Picture-recall was used to assess the amnesic effect of midazolam in children over 5 yr of age. Midazolam 0.75 mg.kg-1 produced significant sedation at 30 min. After procedures lasting an average of 106-113 min, recovery was not prolonged by the oral midazolam-atropine combination.

  ".W": "The authors conducted a randomized controlled clinical trial to evaluate the usefulness of perioperative manual evaluation of the response to train-of-four (TOF) nerve stimulation. A total of 80 patients were divided into four groups of 20 each. For two groups (one given vecuronium and one pancuronium), the anesthetists assessed the degree of neuromuscular blockade during operation and during recovery from neuromuscular blockade by manual evaluation of the response to TOF nerve stimulation. In the other two groups, one of which received vecuronium and the other pancuronium, the anesthetists evaluated the degree of neuromuscular blockade solely by clinical criteria. The use of a nerve stimulator was found to have no effect on the dose of relaxant given during anesthesia, on the need for supplementary doses of anticholinesterase in the recovery room, on the time from end of surgery to end of anesthesia, or on the incidence of postoperative residual neuromuscular blockade evaluated clinically. The median (and range of) TOF ratios recorded in the recovery room were 0.75 (0.33-0.96) and 0.79 (0.10-0.97) in the vecuronium groups monitored with and without a nerve stimulator, respectively. These ratios were significantly higher than those found in the pancuronium groups, which wre 0.66 (0.06-0.90) and 0.63 (0.29-0.95), respectively. However, no difference was found between the vecuronium and pancuronium groups in the number of patients showing clinical signs of residual neuromuscular blockade, as evaluated by the 5-s head-lift test.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In a separate group of patients (n = 9) with severe CAD, the effects of TEA on coronary arterioles (resistance vessels) were studied, by measuring total and regional myocardial blood flow and metabolism with the retrograde coronary sinus thermodilution technique. At the stenotic segments, TEA induced an increase in luminal diameter from 1.34 +/- 0.11 to 1.56 +/- 0.13 mm (P less than 0.002), but did not change the diameter of the nonstenotic segments (3.07 +/- 0.13 to 2.99 +/- 0.13 mm). In the second group of patients, TEA induced no changes in coronary perfusion pressure, total or regional myocardial blood flow, coronary venous oxygen content, coronary blood flow distribution, regional myocardial oxygen consumption, or lactate extraction or uptake. Two patients had chest pain in the control situation and had regional myocardial lactate production that was attenuated by TEA. We conclude that TEA may increase the diameter of stenotic epicardial coronary artery segments in patients with CAD without causing a dilation of coronary arterioles. These effects may be beneficial when high TEA is used to treat severe ischemic chest pain in patients at rest.\r"

To assess the efficacy, safety, and appropriate dose of epidural clonidine for post-cesarean section analgesia, we designed a double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Sixty women were randomly assigned to receive epidural administration of saline bolus followed by 24-h saline infusion, 400-micrograms clonidine bolus followed by 10 micrograms/h clonidine infusion, or 800-micrograms clonidine bolus followed by 20 micrograms/h clonidine infusion. Supplemental analgesia was provided with patient-controlled iv morphine. Compared to saline, both clonidine regimens produced analgesia, as measured by verbal pain scores and supplemental iv morphine use during the first 6 h after bolus injection. Time to first morphine use was similar for both clonidine groups and significantly greater than saline. However, compared to saline, only the 20 micrograms/h clonidine infusion resulted in decreased morphine usage over the entire 24-h period. Compared to saline, both clonidine doses decreased blood pressure. This decrease was greater in the 400-micrograms than in the 800-micrograms clonidine group, but no patient required treatment for hypotension. Clonidine decreased heart rate (one patient required atropine for asymptomatic bradycardia) and produced transient sedation. The 800-micrograms clonidine dose prolonged resolution of local anesthetic-induced motor blockade compared to saline. The results suggest that epidurally administered clonidine provides analgesia, as measured by decreased need for supplemental morphine, after cesarean section, but continuous infusion is required for analgesia of more than 6 h duration.\r"

  ".W": "Sixty healthy patients scheduled for elective cesarean delivery under epidural anesthesia were randomized to receive either lidocaine or 2-chloroprocaine as the primary local anesthetic agent. When patients first complained of postoperative pain in the recovery room, they were given either fentanyl 50 micrograms or butorphanol 2 mg, epidurally, in a randomized, blinded fashion. Postoperative analgesia, quantitated on a visual analogue scale, as well as time elapsed until first request for supplemental opioid, did not differ for patients receiving butorphanol after either 2-chloroprocaine or lidocaine anesthesia. In contrast, epidural fentanyl produced a shorter and lesser degree of sensory analgesia after 2-chloroprocaine use, whereas epidural fentanyl after lidocaine anesthesia provided pain relief similar to that seen in the butorphanol groups. Side effects were limited to somnolence with butorphanol and pruritus with fentanyl. No evidence of respiratory depression was seen in any patient. We conclude that 2 mg of butorphanol epidurally provides approximately 2 to 3 h of effective analgesia after cesarean delivery with either lidocaine or 2-chloroprocaine anesthesia. Epidural fentanyl seems to be antagonized when 2-chloroprocaine, but not lidocaine, is used as the primary local anesthetic agent. We suggest a possible mu-receptor-specific etiology for this effect.\r"

Five patients received first a loading dose of intravenous meperidine after umbilical cord clamping, then patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) with intravenous meperidine, and finally meperidine tablets as needed. Five patients received morphine in the same manner. Treatment groups showed no differences with respect to neonatal Apgar scores or visual analog scale (VAS) pain or satisfaction scores at 24 and 48 h postpartum. Breast milk specimens, obtained at 12, 24, 36, 48, 72, and 96 h postpartum and analyzed for opioids and metabolites, showed persistently elevated normeperidine concentrations in the meperidine group. A blinded psychologist evaluated each infant once on the 3rd day of life with the Brazelton Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale (NBAS). A priori, the \"alertness\" and three \"human orientation\" outcomes of the NBAS were chosen for analysis as best measures of opioid-induced effects. On all four outcomes, neonates in the morphine group scored significantly higher (P less than 0.05) than neonates in the meperidine group. We conclude that post-cesarean delivery PCA with morphine provides equivalent maternal analgesia and overall satisfaction as that provided by PCA with meperidine, but with significantly less neurobehavioral depression among breast-fed neonates on the 3rd day of life.\r"

Despite restriction of sensory block to the upper thorax with high thoracic epidural anesthesia, skin temperatures increased significantly (P less than 0.05 vs. saline) on the foot (great toe: +1.2 degrees C +/- 2.9 SD; little toe: +0.9 degrees C +/- 2.6) and hand (thumb: +2.0 degrees C +/- 4.0, digit 5: +2.9 degrees C +/- 4.2) but decreased after saline. Midthoracic injection also increased significantly skin temperature on the foot (great toe: +4.0 degrees C +/- 4.9; little toe: +3.6 degrees C +/- 4.8) but not on the hand. In contrast, with lumbar epidural anesthesia, skin temperature increased significantly on the foot (great toe: +8.5 degrees C +/- 2.5; little toe: +8.6 degrees C +/- 2.8) but decreased significantly on the hand (thumb: -3.1 degrees C +/- 2.1; digit 5: -2.8 degrees C +/- 2.5).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The number of unrecognized hypoxemic episodes, as well as risk factors and possible association between hypoxemia and postoperative morbidity, were studied. Oxygenation was monitored continuously with a pulse oximeter. One or more hypoxemic episodes (SpO2 less than or equal to 90%) were noted in 55% of the patients. SpO2 values less than or equal to 80% were noted in 13% of the patients. Supplementary oxygen was given during 55% of the 447 hypoxemic episodes registered. The hypoxemic episodes were unrecognized by the staff in 95% of the cases. With stepwise multiple logistic regression analyses, risk factors associated with a higher incidence of hypoxemia were: duration of anesthesia (P less than 0.0001), age (P less than 0.002) and a history of smoking (P less than 0.01). Patients who had undergone regional anesthesia had a lower risk of hypoxemia (P less than 0.0002). The occurrence of hypoxemia in the PACU could not be correlated to postoperative morbidity. We conclude that hypoxemic episodes in our PACU are common and that the routine use of supplemental oxygen combined with normal clinical surveillance did not prevent hypoxemic episodes.\r"

Physicians were given two syringes, one of which was labeled as \"load\" for the initial loading dose and the other as \"maintenance\" for continuous infusion. The concentration of drug in each syringe was adjusted to permit administration on a milliliter per kilogram basis. The target loading doses for alfentanil, fentanyl, and sufentanil were 75, 10, and 1 microgram/kg, respectively, and initial infusion rates were 33.5, 2.0, and 0.3 microgram.kg-1.h-1, respectively. Additional supplementary boluses and changes in maintenance infusion rate were made according to predetermined guidelines. Isoflurane, in increasing 0.2% inspired increments, was used only when the maximum allowed opioid dose had been given (i.e., supplementary bolus doses equal to 75% of the calculated loading dose or supplementary bolus doses equal to 50% of the calculated loading dose combined with a 50% increase in the maintenance infusion rate). Opioid infusions were stopped at the time of bone flap replacement. Antihypertensive medications and naloxone were subsequently given at the discretion of the anesthesiologist. Group demographics were not different. Total volumes of drug were similar among groups indicating equipotent preparations. Administration of isoflurane, antihypertensive medications, and naloxone were not different among groups. Although decreases in blood pressure seen with induction were similar among groups, alfentanil-treated patients received ephedrine more frequently before intubation. Thirty minutes after entry into the postanesthesia recovery area, respiratory rate and pH were lowest in sufentanil-treated patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The early signs of infection were studied in 350 patients in whom long-term epidural catheters were inserted. Three areas of the catheter track were found to be involved; exit site and superficial catheter track infection, and epidural space infection. The authors identified the early signs of infection in each area and the progress of the infection from the deep track to include the epidural space in four of these patients. All 19 patients who developed deep track or epidural infections were successfully treated with antibiotics and catheter removal. None of the patients required surgery for spinal cord decompression. Catheters were replaced in 15 of the 19 treated patients who requested them after treatment with no recurrent infections. It was concluded that use of long-term epidural catheterization is associated with a definable epidural infection rate. The use of epidural opioid analgesia is an effective and safe means of obtaining pain relief for terminally ill patients when patients are monitored for possible infection and receive prompt treatment when the diagnosis is established.\r"

Maximal isometric contractions of guinea pig right ventricular papillary muscles were studied in Tyrode's superfusate at 37 degrees C within a gas-tight chamber. Superfusate (pH at 7.45) and chamber were equilibrated with 95% O2/5% CO2. After control measurements in 95% O2, muscles were studied with 50% N2 and 50% N2O (45% O2/5% CO2) in random order with an intervening and final recovery in oxygen. Muscles were field stimulated after rest and at 0.1-3 Hz. At 37 degrees C, muscle performance deteriorated over time with exposure to reduced oxygen; therefore, identical experiments were performed at 30 degrees C in which no systematic deterioration occurred. Peak tension and maximum rate of tension development (dT/dtmax) were compared for each stimulation rate. At both temperatures, N2O caused a 10-15% depression of contractility as compared to that observed with nitrogen. In a second protocol, muscles were studied at 37 degrees C in 26 mM K+ Tyrode's solution with 0.10 microM isoproterenol to study enhanced contractions mediated by slow (Ca2(+)-channel-dependent) action potentials. Rested-state double stimulations were used (stimulus interval, 250-600 ms) resulting in a first rested-state contraction followed by a second contraction (C2) with rapid initial tension development. The muscles were exposed to nitrogen and N2O as in the force-frequency experiments and did not deteriorate over time. In this setting, N2O also caused a 10-15% depression of C2 contractility as compared with nitrogen. Another set of muscles was studied in 95% O2 to which 0.5% halothane or 1% isoflurane was added before exposure to nitrogen and N2O. The combined depressant action of N2O with either halothane or isoflurane did not differ from that predicted by the simple addition of independent effects; there was no evidence of synergism. Furthermore, N2O (50%) alone depressed dT/dtmax in a manner similar to that of 0.5% halothane and different from that of 1.0% isoflurane. Experiments conducted in iso-osmolar 40 mM Na+ Tyrode's solution, in which activator Ca2+ arose from the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+, also showed greater depression by N2O than nitrogen. N2O (50%) is a myocardial depressant independent of concurrent hypoxic effects with a pattern and magnitude of contractile depression similar to that of 0.5% halothane.\r"

In addition, the effects of intramuscular bupivacaine (300 micrograms) and the spinal cord transection (T2) were examined to determine whether the induced metabolic changes, if any, are related to the drug's systemic effect and/or deafferentation. Lumbar epidural bupivacaine sufficient to produce analgesia decreased SP-LGU in the thoracic (18-28%) and lumbar (21-29%) spinal cord but not in the cervical cord. Epidural bupivacaine decreased BR-LGU (15-26%) in 35 of 38 structures examined. With intramuscular bupivacaine, SP-LGU remained unchanged in almost all regions, while BR-LGU was significantly decreased (11-23%) in 23 structures. Plasma concentrations of bupivacaine in the epidural and intramuscular groups were comparable. With spinal cord transection alone, SP-LGU significantly decreased with varying degrees depending on the structure examined, but BR-LGU did not decrease in 36 of 38 structures examined. These results indicate that analgesic doses of epidural bupivacaine decrease SP-LGU, probably reflecting decreased neuronal activity of the spinal cord, and that reduced BR-LGU by epidural bupivacaine is most likely due to the drug's systemic effect rather than deafferentation.\r"

Animals were grouped according to the composition of the circuit priming fluid. Group 1 animals (n = 7) received a priming fluid (6.5% hydroxyethyl starch in 0.72 N NaCl; 323 +/- 13 mOsm/kg [mean +/- SD]) that maintained normal colloid oncotic pressure (COP) during CPB (19.0 +/- 1.5 mmHg). Group 2 animals (n = 7) received a priming fluid (0.9 N NaCl; 324 +/- 23 mOsm/kg) that led to a hypooncotic state (COP = 6.2 +/- 1.2 mmHg). Blood chemistries and hemodynamics were recorded every 15 min during CPB. Animals were given additional priming fluid and sodium bicarbonate during CPB to maintain a circuit flow of 85 ml.kg-1.min-1 and arterial pH greater than 7.35. There were no significant differences between groups 1 and 2 with respect to temperature, central venous pressure, mean arterial pressure, PaO2, PaCO2, plasma sodium concentration, or osmolality at any time during CPB, although osmolality increased in both groups. After 60 min of bypass, animals were killed and organ water contents were determined by wet/dry weight ratios. A separate group of nine similarly prepared and anesthetized animals that did not undergo cannulation or CPB also underwent measurement of plasma chemistries and tissue water contents and served as nonbypass controls (group 3). Brain and kidney water contents were unaffected by oncotic pressure, whereas duodenum and skeletal muscle had significantly greater water content (P = 0.003 and P = 0.008, respectively) after hypooncotic CPB.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The effects of halothane or cooling on Ca2(+)-activated tensions and on the uptake and release of Ca2+ by the sarcoplasmic reticulum were investigated in chemically skinned fibers of the extensor digitorum longus muscle of adult rabbits. At 22 degrees C, halothane (greater than 0.46 mM) induced Ca2+ release from the SR of Ca2(+)-loaded skinned fibers that resulted in transient tensions. Higher concentrations of halothane (greater than 4.65 mM) reduced the steady-state accumulation of Ca2+ in the SR at 22 degrees C. Cooling (to less than 10 degrees C) elicited transient contractures (cooling-induced contractures [CC]) in Ca2(+)-loaded skinned fibers, despite the fact that the tensions elicited by adding Ca2+ to the bath were depressed at these low temperatures. The skinned fibers did not develop CCs at 12-16 degrees C. Halothane cooling contractures could be elicited at these temperatures by exposing the fibers to halothane concentrations that failed to elicit Ca2+ release at 22 degrees C. The halothane cooling contractures were blocked by procaine but not by lidocaine. It was concluded that these contractures resulted from a synergistic interaction between halothane and cooling that stimulates Ca2+ release from, and reduces Ca2+ uptake by, the sarcoplasmic reticulum.\r"

  ".W": "Right ventricular (RV) dysfunction may occur due to increased RV afterload and, hence, might also contribute to the decrease in cardiac output following institution of PEEP in patients with adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). To test this hypothesis, the authors examined the influence of PEEP on local and global RV function in 12 anesthetized dogs with experimental ARDS (eARDS) induced by pulmonary microembolization with glass beads and oleic acid. Local RV function was analyzed in the RV inflow tract (RVIT) and RV outflow tract (RVOT) by assessing both diastolic segment length, systolic segment shortening, and segment work (sonomicrometry). Global RV contractility was quantified by measuring maximum rate of pressure rise (dRVP/dtmax) and maximum velocity of contractile element shortening (Vmax). In eARDS, despite a fivefold increase in pulmonary vascular resistance, there was no change in cardiac index (CI), global RV contractility, RVIT and RVOT work, and RVIT shortening, whereas RVOT shortening decreased from 12.4 to 7.4% (P less than 0.01). Diastolic segment length increased in RVIT (P less than 0.05) but not in RVOT. PEEP of 10 cmH2O did not alter global RV contractility, RVIT and RVOT shortening, and RVIT work but reduced RVOT work (-35%; P less than 0.01) and CI (-11%; P less than 0.001). Cardiac index further decreased during PEEP of 20 cmH2O (-38%; P less than 0.001), while global RV contractility remained intact despite decreased RVIT and RVOT shortening (-32% and -69%; P less than 0.05) and work (-26% and -59%; P less than 0.01) in the presence of reduced fiber preload in both regions. From these findings, it was concluded that 1) the decreased CI during mechanical ventilation with PEEP at constant right ventricular end-diastolic pressure (RVEDP) is not caused by depressed global RV contractility in dogs with eARDS and a normal myocardium prior to insult. Decreased diastolic segment length and segment shortening during PEEP suggest that 2) PEEP reduces stroke volume by the Starling mechanism rather than by ischemia of the RV free wall. Finally, regionally incongruent changes of fiber preload indicate that 3) local differences in RV wall compliance are likely to occur subsequent to eARDS and PEEP.\r"

Isovolumetric left ventricular systolic (LVSP) and end-diastolic pressures (LVEDP) were measured by placing a saline filled, latex balloon into the left ventricle. Bipolar electrodes were placed in the right atrium and right ventricle for measurements of heart rate (HR), atrioventricular conduction time (AVCT), and determination of the incidence and severity of dysrhythmias occurring during hypoxia and reoxygenation. Hearts were divided into three groups: control (n = 20), halothane (n = 12), and isoflurane (n = 13). All hearts were exposed in sequence to oxygenated perfusate (PO2, 530 mmHg), moderately hypoxic perfusate (PO2, 91 mmHg) for 30 min, and then to oxygenated perfusate for 40 min. Halothane (1%, 0.4 mM) or isoflurane (1.5%, 0.5 mM) were administered 10 min before hypoxia, during hypoxia, and during the first 10 min of reoxygenation. Exposure to halothane and isoflurane before hypoxia produced a 14 and 11% decrease in heart rate, a 32 and 23% increase in AVCT, and a 47 and 28% decrease in LVSP (all P less than or equal to 0.001) for halothane and isoflurane, respectively, and no significant change in LVEDP. During hypoxia, HR decreased and AVCT increased similarly in both groups. Left ventricular systolic pressure (LVSP) decreased sharply with a narrowing of the prehypoxic differences among the groups. In the control and isoflurane groups, LVEDP increased during hypoxia but remained unchanged in the halothane group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Since phospholipid methylation and translocation play a key role in the transmission of biologic signals across cell membranes, we examined the effect of two commonly used halogenated anesthetics, halothane and isoflurane, on phospholipid methylation in rat brain synaptosomes. Using S-adenosyl-L-[3H-methyl]methionine as a donor, we found a two-fold increase in 3H-methyl incorporation into phospholipids in synaptosomes taken from rats exposed to concentrations that just abolish pain response, but not in rats exposed to higher or lower concentrations. Methylation was not increased in rats newly recovered from anesthesia. Halothane added to synaptosomes taken from rats not previously exposed to anesthetics stimulated 3H-methyl incorporation over a wide range of concentrations. Enhancement of phospholipid methylation by halothane and isoflurane may effect an alteration of neural signal transduction that results in the anesthetic state.\r"

  ".W": "Adenosine has sedative properties, and adenosine-receptor agonists have been found to reduce anesthetic requirements in rodents. This study determined whether adenosine, in hypotensive doses, reduces anesthetic requirements in halothane-anesthetized dogs. In seven animals, minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) for halothane was determined by a tail-clamp technique at three time points: after 2 h of halothane anesthesia, during adenosine-induced hypotension (mean arterial pressure: 55 mmHg), and 1 h after adenosine was discontinued. In other dogs, the effects of aminophylline, dipyridamole, or the specific adenosine-receptor antagonist 8-phenyl-theophylline (8-PT) on the halothane-adenosine interaction were studied. Adenosine significantly reduced halothane MAC, by 49%, from 0.76 +/- 0.05 to 0.39 +/- 0.05 vol% (mean +/- SEM). This effect was blocked by the concurrent administration of aminophylline (n = 5, P less than 0.05) or 8-PT (n = 4 of 4). When dipyridamole, which increases the plasma concentrations of endogenous adenosine, was administered alone, halothane MAC was reduced from 0.79 +/- 0.03 to 0.67 +/- 0.05 vol% (n = 5, P = 0.09). We conclude that exogenous adenosine substantially reduces halothane MAC in dogs and that this effect is blocked by the concurrent administration of the adenosine-receptor antagonists aminophylline or 8-PT. Relatively small alterations of endogenous adenosine concentrations, however, do not substantially reduce halothane MAC.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE: To assess the hemodynamic determinates of peripheral subdiaphragmatic venous-to-right-heart return during closed-chest CPR. MODEL: Seven anesthetized dogs subjected to electrically induced ventricular fibrillation for five minutes. INTERVENTIONS: Conventional closed-chest CPR and closed-chest CPR with continuous abdominal binding at a chest compression rate of 60 per minute, a compression-to-relaxation ratio of 50:50, and a ventilation-to-compression ratio of 1:5. METHODS: Solid-state catheters were positioned in the ascending aorta, right atrium (RA), and inferior vena cava (IVC). Cannulating electromagnetic flow probes were inserted into the IVC and a carotid artery. Analog-to-digital conversion was performed electronically. Five minutes after ventricular fibrillation was induced, interventions were performed in an alternating sequence. Systolic, diastolic, and mean pressures and flows were measured and compared. STATISTICAL METHODS: Two-tailed, unpaired t test applied to equal sample size, linear regression analysis, and multiple regression analysis. RESULTS: Abdominal binding during CPR significantly increased (P less than .05) all measured systolic and diastolic CPR intravascular pressures compared with CPR without abdominal binding but did not affect IVC-to-right-heart venous return. During conventional CPR without abdominal binding, venous return was dependent on the diastolic IVC pressure (r = .86, P = .014), mean IVC pressure (r = .80, P = .03), and carotid blood flow (r = .99, P = .001) but not on the IVC-to-RA pressure gradient. With abdominal binding, venous return was not correlated with any study hemodynamic variable, including the peripheral venous-to-RA pressure gradient. CONCLUSION: Venous return from the subdiaphragmatic venous bed during CPR is dependent on venous pressure, not on the peripheral venous-to-right-heart pressure gradient. Abdominal binding during CPR does not affect venous return. Venous return during CPR diastole is highly dependent on central venous capacitance (left heart outflow during CPR systole).\r"

Little data exist on the amount of airway protection afforded with this technique of airway management. We sought to evaluate the risk of aspiration during manual TLJV. SETTING: Data were collected in a laboratory animal model. DESIGN: A prospective, nonrandomized, controlled trial was performed. PARTICIPANTS: Seventeen adult apneic mongrel dogs were enrolled. INTERVENTIONS: Intratracheal Gastrograffin was instilled and radiographic changes assessed during ventilation using a 0 to 3 scale (none to severe). Thirty-six trials were performed, with equal numbers at both 30 degrees and 45 degrees head elevation. The three groups studied were animals without airway protection (control), animals with a cuffed endotracheal tube (tube), and animals with a percutaneous TLJV cannula and a 50-psi oxygen source ventilated at a rate of 20 breaths per minute (jet). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Significantly less radiographic evidence of aspiration was noted in the jet and tube groups at 30 degrees and 45 degrees compared with control animals (P = .002 each). At 45 degrees head elevation a trend toward increased aspiration scores in the jet group compared with the tube group (P = .065) was observed. CONCLUSION: In our model, manual TLJV at 20 breaths per minute and an I:E ratio of 1:2 provided protection from aspiration comparable to that observed with a cuffed endotracheal tube at 30 degrees head elevation. At 45 degrees elevation, this protection was diminished.\r"

It is therefore generally assumed that epinephrine and sodium bicarbonate should not be infused in the same IV line during CPR. The aim of this study was to determine the validity of this widely accepted proposition. DESIGN AND SETTING: Two different commercial solutions of epinephrine differing only in the concentration of sodium metabisulfite (0.46% and 0.02%) were studied. Two dosages of each solution type (1 mg/1 mL and 10 mg/10 mL) were diluted in 250 mL of 8.4% sodium bicarbonate. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The concentration of epinephrine was measured at different times for two weeks. It was found that the concentration of epinephrine decreased slowly to zero after two weeks, and was approximately at 70% and 100% of control values at 30 minutes after alkalinization. CONCLUSION: It was concluded that epinephrine in an alkaline solution is effectively oxidized but has a slow reaction that may not be clinically relevant over short periods of time.\r"

The absence of uniform definitions prevents meaningful intersystem comparisons, prohibits explorations of hypotheses about effective interventions, and interferes with the efforts of quality assurance. The most satisfactory numerator for a survival rate appears to be survival to hospital discharge; the most appropriate denominator appears to be witnessed adult cardiac arrest of presumed heart disease etiology, with ventricular fibrillation as the initial identified rhythm. Proposed definitions for the data emergency medical services systems should report as they examine their cardiac arrest survival rates are presented.\r"

DESIGN: Two models of Medtronic Activitrax pacemakers were attached externally to healthy adult volunteers. Each volunteer then was loaded into the helicopter and subjected to a flight sequence. Pacemaker firing rates throughout this sequence were recorded. SETTING: On separate days, Aerospatiale Dauphin and Twinstar helicopters completed a total of 23 flights. TYPE OF PARTICIPANTS: Four healthy adult volunteers, two men and two women, participated. INTERVENTIONS: These included intra- and inter-flight threshold re-programming and external magnet application. RESULTS: The average preflight pacemaker rate of 65 beats per minute increased to an average in-flight rate of 105 beats per minute, which resolved to preflight rates on shutdown. This pattern was consistently extinguished with external magnet application. CONCLUSION: The effect of rotor motion and flight vibration on the rate-response of the Activitrax pacemaker is both predictable and easily preventable. Possible guidelines for the safe transport of these patients, using pacemaker reprogramming or external magnet application, are examined.\r"

However, in emergency medical services (EMS) systems with very short response times, bystander CPR has not been shown to impact outcome. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of bystander CPR on survival from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in such a system. DESIGN: Prehospital, hospital, and death certificate data from a medium-sized metropolitan area were retrospectively analyzed for adult, nontraumatic cardiac arrest during a 16-month period. RESULTS: A total of 298 patients met study criteria. One hundred ninety-five arrests (65.4%) were witnessed, and 103 (34.6%) were unwitnessed. Twenty-five witnessed victims (12.8%) were discharged alive, whereas no unwitnessed victims survived (P less than .001). Patients suffering a witnessed episode of ventricular fibrillation/tachycardia (VF/VT) were more likely to survive (21.9%) than were other patients (2.0%, P less than .0001). Among witnessed patients, initiation of bystander CPR was associated with a significant improvement in survival (20.0%) compared with the no-bystander CPR group (9.2%, P less than .05). Bystander CPR was also associated with improved outcome when witnessed patients with successful prehospital resuscitation were evaluated as a group; 18 had bystander CPR, of whom 13 (72.2%) survived compared with only 12 of 38 patients with no bystander CPR (31.6%, P less than .01). CONCLUSION: Our data revealed improved survival rates when bystander CPR was initiated on victims of witnessed cardiac arrest in an EMS system with short response times.\r"

DESIGN: Comprehensive medical information was added to the EMS data collection tool used by a metropolitan fire department. We evaluated the frequency of failure to enter data pertaining to medical assessment and/or treatment of victims of cardiac arrest after implementation of the system. RESULTS: Failure to enter data in the first month was compared with two subsequent two-month blocks. A high rate of noncompliance existed in the first month (all medical data were missing in 24.6%). However, the subsequent two months revealed a marked decline in noncompliance (4.4%, P less than .001). This decline was maintained after a three-month interim (5.0%, P less than .001). CONCLUSION: Data entry noncompliance can be a significant problem after implementation of a new prehospital data collection system. However, compliance can be markedly improved over a relatively short period. Because EMS system evaluation is based on data collected in the field. EMS researchers and administrators must be aware of the data entry compliance rate in their system when attempting to make conclusions from such information.\r"

DESIGN AND SETTING: This was a randomized, prospective study using prophylactic lidocaine in patients complaining of chest pain who presented to our paramedic system between January 1984 and January 1988. TYPE OF PARTICIPANTS: All patients aged 18 years or older with chest pain of suspected cardiac origin who presented to paramedics during the study period were included. Excluded were patients presenting with warning arrhythmias, second- or third-degree heart block, bradycardias of less than 50, hypotension of less than 90 mm Hg systolic, or known allergy to lidocaine. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomized into two groups, the lidocaine-treated group and the control group. An initial bolus of 1 mg/kg IV lidocaine was administered to the lidocaine-treated group. A simultaneous 2 mg/min IV drip was established. Ten minutes after the first dose of lidocaine, a second bolus of 0.5 mg/kg was administered. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: During the study period, 1,427 patients were entered; 704 received lidocaine, and 723 did not. Discharge diagnoses included acute myocardial infarction (31%), unstable angina (33%), other cardiac problems (7%), and noncardiac problems (29%); overall mortality rate was 7.4%. There was an equal distribution of deaths between the lidocaine-treated group (57) and the control group (48). Six patients had a cardiac arrest in the prehospital setting, and 15 had a cardiac arrest in the ED. Malignant ventricular arrhythmias as the precipitating arrest rhythm in patients with acute myocardial infarctions were similar for the lidocaine-treated and control groups. The incidence of adverse effects, including hypotension, bradycardias, second- or third-degree heart blocks, tinnitus, and altered mental status, was similar in both groups. CONCLUSION: There are no benefits from the administration of prehospital prophylactic lidocaine in stable patients with chest pain; therefore, routine use in this setting appears unwarranted.\r"

Prehospital diagnostic accuracy is improved compared with single-lead telemetry. POPULATION: One-hundred sixty-six stable adult patients who sought paramedic evaluation for a chief complaint of nontraumatic chest pain. METHODS: One-hundred fifty-one prehospital 12-lead ECGs of diagnostic quality were obtained by paramedics on 166 adult patients presenting with nontraumatic chest pain. Paramedics and base station physicians were blinded to the information on acquired prehospital 12-lead ECGs and treated patients according to current standard of care-clinical diagnosis and single-lead telemetry. Final hospital diagnoses were classified into three groups: acute myocardial infarction (24); suspected angina or ischemia (61); and nonischemic chest pain (66). Paramedics and base station physicians' clinical diagnoses and prehospital and emergency department ECGs were similarly classified and compared. Prehospital and ED 12-lead ECGs were read retrospectively by two cardiologists. RESULTS: Paramedics achieved a high success rate (98.7%) in obtaining diagnostic quality prehospital 12-lead ECGs in 94.6% of eligible prehospital patients. For patients with acute myocardial infarction, prehospital ECG alone had significantly higher specificity than did the paramedic clinical diagnosis (99.2% vs 70.9%; P less than .001), and significantly higher positive predictive value (92.9% vs 32.7%; P less than .001). For patients with angina, combining the paramedic clinical diagnosis and the prehospital ECG significantly improved sensitivity (90.2% vs 62.3%; P less than .001) and increased negative predictive value (88.9% vs 71.3%; P less than .02) compared with paramedic clinical diagnosis alone. There was a high concordance between prehospital and ED ECG diagnosis (99.3% for acute myocardial infarction and 92.8% for angina). Furthermore, ten patients whose prehospital ECGs demonstrated ischemia and who had final hospital diagnoses of angina or acute myocardial infarction were mistriaged by paramedics and/or received no base station physician-directed therapy. CONCLUSION: It is feasible to apply prehospital 12-lead electrocardiography to most stable prehospital chest pain patients. Prehospital 12-lead ECGs have the potential to significantly increase the diagnostic accuracy in chest pain patients, approach congruity with ED 12-lead ECG diagnoses, and may allow for consideration of altering and improving prehospital and hospital-based management in this patient population.\r"

Not only does the presence of a high AG suggest a certain differential, but knowledge of the relationship between the rise in AG (delta AG) and the fall in bicarbonate (delta HCO3) is important in understanding mixed acid-based disorders. Simple arithmetic converts this relationship into a numerical value, the delta gap (delta gap). The delta gap = delta AG - delta HCO3. If the delta gap is significantly positive (greater than +6), a metabolic alkalosis is usually present because the rise in AG is more than the fall in HCO3. Conversely, if the delta gap is significantly negative (less than -6), then a hyperchloremic acidosis is usually present because the rise in AG is less than the fall in HCO3. Familarity with the relationship between the changes in AG and HCO3 can be useful in unmasking occult metabolic disorders.\r"

  ".W": "STUDY HYPOTHESIS: That visual colorimetry can be used to rapidly and precisely estimate the erythrocyte count of 1:5 dilutions of simulated peritoneal lavage fluid. POPULATION: Fifty-four normal adult human subjects. METHODS: The automated or chamber RBC count is often used on fluid obtained by peritoneal lavage in patients with abdominal trauma to help determine the need for surgery. Unfortunately, this method sometimes results in excessive delay. We designed and built a simple colorimeter that facilitated rapid direct visual comparison of unknown samples with known color standards. A radiograph view box was used as a light source. Standards were prepared in 16-mm glass tubes to simulate peritoneal lavage fluid with RBC counts ranging from 0 to 140,000 in 10,000 cell/microL increments; 1:5 dilutions with water were used throughout to reduce opacity. Thimerosal was added to unknowns and standards to stabilize color; all samples were kept refrigerated at 4 C when not in use. In a double-blind in-vitro study, each subject matched 20 randomly distributed unknowns ranging from 12,000 to 131,000 erythrocytes/microL to the nearest standard. RESULTS: The mean absolute error for all 1,080 determinations was 3,560 RBC/microL (95% CI = 4,290-4,830; SD = 4,560; t = 39.6; df = 1,079; P less than .001). This method correctly predicted the RBC count to within 9,000 cells/microL 95% of the time. CONCLUSION: Visual comparison of 1:5 dilutions of simulated peritoneal lavage fluid with known color standards can be used to rapidly and precisely estimate the erythrocyte count.\r"

DESIGN: Participants were given a 14-question test and observed for their, practice of universal precautions during routine IV catheter placement or phlebotomy and trauma care before and six months after an education in-service. SETTING: University hospital emergency department. TYPE OF PARTICIPANTS: Nursing personnel. INTERVENTIONS: One-hour lecture addressing the occupational risk of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and the recommended use of universal precautions. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The mean overall correct response rates to the questionnaire before and after the in-service were 70% and 73%, respectively (P = NS). The pattern of incorrect responses suggested that the perceived risks of HIV transmission are underestimated, particularly among healthy-appearing patients. For care of critical trauma patients, there were significant increases between the frequency rates before and after the in-service of glove and protective eyewear use (66.7% vs 87.7%, P less than .025; 0.0% vs 17.3%, P less than .05, respectively). The frequency rates of glove use for IV placement or phlebotomy in noncritical patients and of gown use for trauma patient care also increased (52.6% vs 65.2% and 25% vs 39.5%, respectively); however, these changes were not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: An intensive educational program was associated with a modest increase in the compliance of ED nursing personnel with universal precautions and had no long-term effect on their general knowledge of HIV risk. The practice of universal precautions is still far from universal in this ED.\r"

  ".U": "91052596\r", 
  ".W": "STUDY OBJECTIVES: Patients presenting to the emergency department with chest discomfort are a difficult problem for emergency physicians. Nearly 50% of patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) will initially have nondiagnostic ECGs on ED presentation. The purpose of this study was to determine if patients with AMI having nondiagnostic ECGs could be identified using new immunochemical assays for serial CK-MB sampling in the ED. DESIGN: Chest pain patients, more than 30 years old, with pain not caused by trauma or explained by radiographic findings, were eligible for the study. Serial serum samples were drawn on ED presentation (zero hours) and three hours after presentation, then analyzed for CK-MB using four immunochemical methods and electrophoresis. Standard World Health Organization criteria were used to establish the diagnosis of AMI, including new Q-wave formation or elevation of standard in-hospital serum cardiac enzyme markers. SETTING: A tertiary cardiac care community hospital. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The serum from 183 patients hospitalized for possible ischemic chest pain was collected and analyzed. Thirty-one of 183 patients (17%) were found to have AMI by standard in-hospital criteria. Sixteen of the 31 patients (52%) with AMI had nondiagnostic ECGs on presentation. Immunochemical determination of serial CK-MB levels provided a sensitive and specific method for detecting AMI in patients within three hours after ED presentation compared with standard electrophoresis. The four immunochemical methods demonstrated a range in sensitivity from 50% to 62.1% on ED presentation versus 92% to 96.7% three hours later. The immunochemical tests demonstrated specificities ranging from 83.0% to 96.4% at three hours, with three of the four tests having specificities of 92% or greater. Electrophoresis had a sensitivity of 34.5% on ED presentation, increasing to 76.9% at three hours, with a specificity of 98.6%. CONCLUSIONS: Immunochemical CK-MB methods allowed rapid, sensitive detection of AMI in the ED. Early detection of AMI offers many potential advantages to the emergency physician. Early detection of AMI, while the patient is in the ED, could direct disposition of this potentially unstable patient to an intensive care setting. Such information may prevent the ED discharge of patients with AMI having nondiagnostic ECGs. The diagnosis of AMI within a six-hour period after symptom onset may allow thrombolytic therapy to be given to patients with AMI not having diagnostic ECGs. This study served as a pilot trial for a multicenter study of the Emergency Medicine Cardiac Research Group, which is currently ongoing.\r"

The individuals who interpreted the radiographs included eight observers with varying degrees of radiographic experience. INTERVENTIONS: None MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The positive predictive value averaged 12% or 15% depending on how we counted a straight NFS, and the negative predictive value averaged 93% or 95%, again depending on how we counted a straight NFS. A straight NFS was ten times as likely to occur among normal wrists than among those with navicular fractures. Interobserver reliability was found to be high with a Hoyt reliability coefficient of .79. CONCLUSIONS: An abnormal NFS is a poor predictor of a navicular fracture while both a straight and a normal NFS are good predictors of no navicular fracture. A normal NFS may allow less stringent treatment by the emergency physician. Extremes of radiographic experience were found to have no significant effect on NFS interpretation.\r"

This study was undertaken to assess the tetanus immunization status of patients presenting to an emergency department and to evaluate their immunologic response to a tetanus booster. SETTING: The study was conducted in a tertiary care ED. TYPE OF PARTICIPANTS: The patients enrolled were 65 or more years old and had breaks in their skin barriers. DESIGN: At each patient's initial presentation, pertinent demographic data and tetanus immunization history were recorded. The patient was then followed for 21 days. INTERVENTIONS: Each patient's antitoxin titer was determined on a serum sample by ELISA, and, if required by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices criteria, a booster was administered at the first visit. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Serum antitoxin assays were repeated on days 7, 14, and 21 after the initial visit until seroconversion (titer more than 0.01 IU/mL). Forty-four patients (55%) had protective levels at initial presentation, and in 36 (45%) the levels were not protective. Age and sex were not predictive of protection. Past military service and a definite history of three or more previous immunizations were good predictors of protection. Of 34 patients who were followed serially for inadequate initial titers, only 19 (56%) seroconverted by day 14. Patients who did not seroconvert were more likely to be older (P less than .05). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that a significant number of elderly patients lacked an initial protective level of tetanus antitoxin. Of these, 44% failed to seroconvert within 14 days and carried a potential risk of developing tetanus.\r"

DESIGN: A 12-month retrospective review of all elderly patients who presented to the ED with acute, nontraumatic abdominal pain. SETTING: A regional trauma center serving a predominately rural population in the Midwest. The ED has 55,000 patient visits yearly. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Of the 127 patients enrolled, 30 (24%) had no specific diagnosis made in the ED. Biliary tract disease (12%) and small bowel obstruction (12%) were the two most common specific diagnoses. Overall, 53 patients (42%) required surgery, usually during the initial hospitalization. In four cases, the postoperative diagnosis differed significantly from the ED diagnosis. Of the 74 patients (58%) who did not undergo surgery, 51 had follow-up information available. In 14 patients, the follow-up diagnosis differed from the original diagnosis, but most of these changes did not appreciably alter the treatment and outcome. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of surgical disease is high in elderly patients with acute abdominal pain, and ED staff are able to diagnose and triage these patients accurately.\r"

The pain of infiltration was measured with a previously validated visual analog pain scale. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Analysis of pooled data and paired data (using patients as their own controls) revealed that infiltrating buffered lidocaine was significantly less painful than plain lidocaine (P = .03 and P = .02, respectively).

SETTING: Intensive and Respiratory Care Unit. Between January 1, 1979, and December 31, 1985, 87 submersion victims were admitted. The files of 83 victims were available for statistical analysis. There were 66 male victims and 17 female victims; the average age was 31.4 +/- 25.8 years. There were ten salt water and 73 fresh water submersions. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Predictors for better survival potentials were a young age, submersion of less than ten minutes, no signs of aspiration, and a central body temperature of less than 35 C at admission. We did not detect factors that accelerated a decrease in core body temperature at admission and assume that lethal hypoxia had preceded protective hypothermia in our submersion victims. The Orlowski score had a predictive value but at the same time we found nonindependent indicators in this score. Neurologic outcome in our patients, who were not treated according to a brain protection protocol, was not worse than the outcome published by authors who have used such a protocol. Thirty-three percent of the victims with a cardioventilatory arrest (15) and all victims with a ventilatory arrest (11) survived resuscitation and were discharged. Five nonarrest victims died due to late complications. CONCLUSION: This study shows that no indicator at the rescue site and in the hospital is absolutely reliable with respect to death or survival.\r"

DESIGN: Retrospective clinical review. SETTING: Level I trauma center. TYPE OF PARTICIPANTS: Eight hundred fourteen adult injured patients. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: When an ISS of more than 9 was used as the definition of major trauma, the ISS undercorrelated 11% of the time with the need for any one procedure. When an ISS of more than 14 was used as the definition, it undercorrelated 20% of the time. CONCLUSION: The ISS may not be completely correlated with the resource requirements of injured patients and should not be used as the sole means by which to define major injury.\r"

MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: A new trauma decision rule was derived from 1,004 injured adult patients using a new operational definition of major trauma. The rule, termed the Trauma Triage Rule, defines a major trauma victim as any injured adult patient whose systolic blood pressure is less than 85 mm Hg; whose motor component of the Glasgow Coma Score is less than 5; or who has sustained penetrating trauma of the head, neck, or trunk. Using the operational definition of major trauma, the rule had a sensitivity of 92% and a specificity of 92% when tested on the 1,004-patient cohort. CONCLUSION: The Trauma Triage Rule may significantly reduce overtriage while only minimally increasing undertriage. This approach must be validated prospectively before it can be used in the prehospital setting.\r"

DESIGN, SETTING, TYPE OF PARTICIPANTS, AND INTERVENTIONS: Advanced life support (ALS) providers were trained with a standardized curriculum to identify patients likely to benefit from prehospital inhaled metaproterenol administration. Unit doses of metaproterenol were used in a small-volume nebulizer. We prospectively included 122 patients in an initial study (71 men; age, 63 +/- 19 years) to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of metaproterenol in the field, and 150 patients (including the original 122) in an additional study to evaluate patient selection criteria. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The treatments resulted in an increase in peak flows, a decrease in respiratory rates, and no change in heart rates. In 62% of patients, the increase in peak flow exceeded 15%. Wheezing improved in 59% of the patients, worsened in 4%, and did not change in the remainder. Air entry by auscultation improved subjectively in 59% of patients. Mild tremor occurred in 8% of patients, moderate tremor occurred in 1%, and no tremor occurred in the remainder. Significant dysrhythmias did not occur. CONCLUSIONS: ALS providers correctly identified patients for this therapy. No technical problems were encountered in the field with this treatment approach. We conclude that ALS providers can be taught to identify patients likely to benefit from inhaled metaproterenol, that inhaled metaproterenol can be administered in the field, and that metaproterenol is both safe and effective when used in the prehospital setting.\r"

DESIGN: We analyzed all prehospital data for injuries among patients 70 years old or older for whom 911 EMS dispatch was requested in a medium-sized metropolitan area during a 12-month period. RESULTS: A total of 1,154 cases occurred (women, 65.1%), which represented 30.3% of all 911 dispatches involving elderly patients. Injury mechanisms were fall (60.7%), motor vehicle accident (MVA; 21.5%), fight (2.4%), accidental poisoning (2.3%), and choking (2.1%). Persons in their 90s had a lower frequency of MVAs (3.4%) than did younger patients (23.0%) (P less than .005). The most frequent injuries determined by prehospital assessment were head or face (25.1%), upper extremity (17.2%), hip (14.5%), lower extremity (13.8%), back (9.8%), and chest or abdomen (5.0%). The frequency of serious neurologic injuries was less for falls or MVAs than for other mechanisms (P less than .005). Suspected hip (P less than .001) and pelvic (P less than .005) injuries occurred more frequently during falls than during other mechanisms of injury, whereas back injuries occurred most frequently in MVAs (P less than .001). Seventy-one fall victims (10.1%) had suspected medical causes of their fall. Twelve patients (1.0%) were in cardiac arrest. CONCLUSION: We report injury patterns and mechanisms among elderly victims of trauma presenting to an EMS system. A knowledge of these patterns will be useful to emergency physicians and EMS administrators.\r"

The mechanism, diagnosis, and treatment of occipital condyle fractures are reviewed, as is the ligamentous and fascial anatomy of the cervicocranium. Dissection of fracture hematoma inferiorly along vertically oriented tissue planes is hypothesized as the pathogenesis of our patient's retropharyngeal hematoma. In addition to being a sign of potential cervical-spine injury, post-traumatic prevertebral soft-tissue swelling may also indicate occipital condyle fracture. To avoid overlooking such fractures, computed tomography undertaken to investigate upper cervical-spine prevertebral soft-tissue swelling should always include slices up to the level of the basal skull so as to visualize the condyles.\r"

  ".W": "Correlation and regression analysis are applied to data to define and quantify the relationship between two variables. Correlation analysis is used to estimate the strength of a relationship between two variables. The correlation coefficient r is a dimensionless number ranging from -1 to +1. A value of -1 signifies a perfect negative, or indirect (inverse) relationship. A value of +1 signifies a perfect positive, or direct relationship. The r can be calculated as the Pearson-product r, using normally distributed interval or ratio data, or as the Spearman rank r, using non-normally distributed data that are not interval or ratio in nature. Linear regression analysis results in the formation of an equation of a line (Y = mX + b), which mathematically describes the line of best fit for a data relationship between X and Y variables. This equation can then be used to predict additional dependent variable values (Y), based on the value or the independent variable X, the slope m, and the Y-intercept b. Interpretation of the correlation coefficient r involves use of r2, which implies the degree of variability of Y due to X. Tests of significance for linear regression are similar conceptually to significance testing using analysis of variance. Multiple correlation and regression, more complex analytical methods that define relationships between three or more variables, are not covered in this article. Closing comments for this final installment of this introduction to biostatistics series are presented.\r"

Fiberoptic bronchoscopy using a protected specimen brush (PSB) was performed on each patient within the first 24 h after admission. Cultures of protected brush specimens demonstrated no growth in 27 patients (50%). With the exception of fever (38.2 +/- 0.8 versus 37.7 +/- 0.6 degrees C; p less than 0.05), the initial severity of the episode of exacerbation was similar in patients with and without infection. A total of 44 organisms were isolated in the 27 patients with positive cultures; the predominant pathogens were Hemophilus spp. and Streptococcus spp. (involved in 74% of cases), but other organisms were isolated in 12 of 27 patients. Mortality rates, duration of mechanical ventilation, and duration of hospitalization were not significantly different between patients with bronchial microflora treated with appropriate antimicrobial therapy (n = 27) and patients without bronchial microflora either receiving empirical antibiotic therapy (n = 18) or not (n = 9). These data suggest that distal bronchial infection due to the usual pathogens, as far as shown by protected specimen brush cultures, may not be the sole or even the predominant cause of acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis in patients requiring mechanical ventilation.\r"

Although dyspnea is often considered a single sensation, alternatively it may encompass multiple sensations that are not well explained by a single physiologic mechanism. To investigate whether breathlessness experienced by patients represents more than one sensation, we studied 53 patients with one of the following seven conditions: pulmonary vascular disease, neuromuscular and chest wall disease, congestive heart failure, pregnancy, interstitial lung disease, asthma, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Patients were asked to choose descriptions of their sensation(s) of breathlessness from a dyspnea questionnaire listing 19 descriptors. Cluster analysis was used to identify natural groupings among the chosen descriptors. We found that patients could distinguish different sensations of breathlessness. In addition, we found an association between certain groups of descriptors and specific conditions producing dyspnea. These findings concur with those in an earlier study in normal volunteers in whom dyspnea was induced by various stimuli. We conclude that different types of dyspnea exist in patients with a variety of cardiopulmonary abnormalities. Furthermore, different mechanisms may mediate these various sensations.\r"

Our population permitted a minimum frequency estimate (7 x 10(-4)) for Pi null alleles. Five quantitative phenotypes were measured, including FEV1, FEF25-75, total serum alpha 1AT, oxidized serum alpha 1AT, and total serum IgE. We found that (1) total alpha 1AT levels were higher in Pi Z subjects with lung function impairment (FEV1 less than or equal to 65% of predicted) than in Pi Z subjects who were not impaired; (2) Pi Z subjects with lung function impairment had elevated serum levels of oxidized alpha 1AT; and (3) IgE levels were relatively elevated in first-degree Pi MZ relatives of impaired Pi Z subjects. Moreover, FEV1 tended to be relatively reduced in heterozygous parents of impaired Pi Z subjects, suggesting that a subset of Pi MZ individuals are at risk for development of lung disease because of familial factors. These results represent an initial step toward the development of intermediate phenotypes that will be predictive of a severe course in alpha 1AT deficiency; they suggest that, in addition to cigarette smoking, atopic predisposition and undetermined familial factors may be important codeterminants of lung disease progression.\r"

Closing volume, closing capacity, and slope of phase III were not related to mortality or cancer. In contrast, FEV1 was related to mortality, with an estimated relative mortality risk of 1.37 (95% confidence interval, 1.11 to 1.70) per liter under the expected FEV1, given height, age, and smoking, but FEV1 was not related to cancer. Inability to perform acceptable single-breath nitrogen test tracings was related to mortality with a relative mortality risk of 2.03 (1.45 to 2.85), but not to cancer.

Pleural pressure generation depends on both the size of the recipient thoracic cage and its neuromuscular integrity. To determine whether lung volumes after heart-lung transplantation are more dependent on donor lung size or on recipient chest wall characteristics, seven HLT recipients were evaluated before and after transplantation. Postoperative values initially (average, 2 months), 6, and 12 months after transplantation were compared with predicted lung volumes for the recipient and donor organs. TLC dropped from a mean of 5.2 +/- 0.5 L preoperatively to 3.7 +/- 0.3 L (p less than 0.05) 2 months after HLT, but it improved with time and ultimately was not different from preoperative values. The predicted TLC of the HLT donor organs were significantly larger than those of the recipient's predicted TLC, with a mean of 6.9 +/- 0.4 versus 5.3 +/- 0.3 L (p less than 0.05). DLCO, arterial PO2, and PCO2 did not change after surgery. Within limits, larger donor lungs appear to adapt to the constraints of the recipient chest and may be used with clinical success, without apparent adverse effects.\r"

  ".W": "In heart-lung transplantation (HLT), the airways have been assumed to be denervated since cholinergic, adrenergic, and sensory nerves are severed. Challenge studies of such patients suggest that there is an increase in airway responsiveness to inhaled cholinergic agonists, which may be explained by denervation hypersensitivity of muscarinic receptors on airway smooth muscle. We have studied the cholinergic control of airways from lungs removed from five patients (8 to 31 yr of age) undergoing retransplantation because of rejection-related bronchiolitis, with time since transplantation ranging from 12 to 32 months. These airways were compared with airways obtained from eight heart donors (24 to 42 yr of age) and from five patients undergoing surgical lobectomy for bronchial carcinoma (54 to 72 yr of age). Bronchial rings (distal lobar and subsegmental) were mounted in organ baths and isometric contractile responses measured. Contractile responses to acetylcholine (ACh, 10 nM to 10 mM) and to electrical field stimulation (EFS) (40 V, 0.5 ms, 1 to 64 Hz for 15 s) were determined. Transplant and control airways showed the same response to ACh, with mean EC50 values of 61.0 +/- 0.32 microM for HLT patients, 57.6 +/- 0.24 microM for donor patients, and 48.7 +/- 1.2 microM for lobectomy patients, suggesting no denervation hypersensitivity of muscarinic receptors. EFS, which activates postganglionic cholinergic nerves, caused similar frequency responses in both transplant and control airways, suggesting that postganglionic nerves are intact. [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate binding to membranes prepared from lung was performed to determine muscarinic binding characteristics.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The role of the pulmonary autonomic nerves in the mediation of respiratory sensation is unclear. Pulmonary neurogenic mechanisms may contribute to dyspnea either directly or indirectly via an influence on the pattern of ventilation. Using human heart-lung transplantation as a model of pulmonary denervation, we studied the ventilatory response, respiratory drive (P0.1), and sensation of breathlessness (modified Borg scale) during maximal incremental bicycle exercise. The subjects were four female heart-lung transplant recipients 3 to 9 months post-transplant and 10 age-matched control subjects. The ventilatory response to increasing CO2 output (VCO2) was higher (p less than 0.001) in transplant recipients than in control subjects, such that ventilation at peak exercise was similar in the two groups despite a lower peak VCO2 in transplant recipients. The ratio of tidal volume to inspiratory capacity increased with increasing ventilation in a similar fashion in both groups. Although the respiratory rate increased more quickly in transplant recipients, it was similar at peak ventilation in the two groups. Ventilatory timing and duty cycle at half-peak and peak ventilation were similar in transplant recipients and control subjects. Dyspnea ratings were not different between the two groups at similar levels of ventilation. Dyspnea as a function of P0.1 was also similar in transplant and control groups. These results indicate that pulmonary neurogenic mechanisms play a role in determining the level, but not the pattern, of ventilation during exercise. Furthermore, these pathways do not appear to contribute significantly to the perception of breathlessness in normal humans.\r"

  ".W": "On the basis of local stimulation of individual muscles, it has been suggested that both the external (EI) and internal interosseous intercostal muscles have an inspiratory action at low lung volumes and an expiratory action at high lung volumes. In this study, we assessed the action of the interosseous intercostal muscles at different lung volumes in 19 anesthetized dogs by synchronously activating the intercostal muscles via ventral root stimulation (VRS). An electrode was positioned on the upper thoracic spinal cord according to previously described techniques. The cervical phrenic rootlets were sectioned bilaterally, the accessory muscles were sectioned from the rib cage, and the origins of the abdominal muscles were sectioned from the middle region of the rib cage. Changes in airway pressure (delta P) were monitored during the application of supramaximal stimuli after hyperventilation-induced apnea and during airway occlusion. Animals were passively inflated or deflated with a volume syringe. Precontractile airway pressure was used as an index of lung volume. External and parasternal intercostal muscle (PA) lengths were monitored by sonomicrometry in the third intercostal space. Thoracoabdominal motion was monitored by Respitrace bands. During VRS, both PA and EI shortened at all lung volumes. Mean delta P progressively decreased with increasing lung volume. At precontractile airway pressures of -10, 0, and +30 cm H2O, delta P were -25 +/- 1, -16 +/- 1, and -5 +/- 1 cm H2O, respectively. After section of the internal intercostal nerves lateral to the costochondral junctions from the first through the seventh intercostal spaces to eliminate PA action, EI shortened, whereas PA usually lengthened.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Alterations in gross and microscopic pathology as well as histochemistry were determined in the diaphragm, intercostal, sternocleidomastoid, extensor digitorum longus, and soleus muscles following 3 wk of intramuscular cortisone injections. Corticosteroid administration induced significant pathologic changes in all the muscles except the soleus. Although gross pathologic changes were greatest in the extensor digitorum longus, microscopic changes were greatest in the diaphragm. Reductions in total muscle fiber volume were similar in the diaphragm, sternocleidomastoid, and extensor digitorum longus muscles. The composition of muscle fiber types and the number of fibers in a muscle were not altered in any of the muscles studied following corticosteroids. There was significant atrophy of individual muscle fibers in all the muscles except the soleus. In the diaphragm, corticosteroids induced atrophy of all fiber types, including type I fibers. Atrophy of type I fibers was not present in the peripheral skeletal muscles or the other respiratory muscles. On the other hand, corticosteroids induced selective atrophy of type IIb muscle fibers in the intercostal and sternocleidomastoid muscles similar to that in the peripheral skeletal muscles. These findings suggest that the effect of corticosteroids on the diaphragm is unique, and one cannot extrapolate form the effect of corticosteroids on peripheral skeletal muscles to that in the diaphragm. In addition, these pathologic changes may have functional relevance, since atrophy of type I fibers may result in a reduction in muscle endurance.\r"

  ".W": "Cystic fibrosis (CF) is characterized by excessive amounts of thick and tenacious mucous secretions that obstruct organ ducts and passages. In the respiratory tract this is associated with chronic infection resulting in the hypersecretion of purulent sputum, which the patient finds difficult to clear. We have studied the rheologic properties of purulent sputum from six patients with CF and five patients with chronic bronchitis to assess whether CF is associated with increased sputum viscoelasticity. In addition, we have isolated the major rheologic determinants, mucous glycoproteins, from CF and chronic bronchitis sputa and, using a magnetic microrheometer, investigated the possibility that the altered properties of mucus in CF are associated with abnormalities in these glycoproteins. Creep compliance analysis indicated that the CF sputa possessed raised levels of both elasticity (p less than 0.01) and viscosity (p less than 0.01). These increases in both rheologic parameters were found to be associated with increases in the DNA content (p less than 0.01) and dry weight (p less than 0.05). Mucous glycoproteins were isolated from CF and chronic bronchitis sputum samples by gel filtration on Sepharose CL4B, followed by concentration to form 8% wt/wt gels. In the absence of other sputum components, no abnormality in the rheologic properties of CF mucin gels could be detected. However, when DNA was added, the CF gels responded with increases in both elasticity and viscosity of as much as 30% (p less than 0.05), an effect not observed in the chronic bronchitis gels. These results suggest that a subtle abnormality may exist in CF mucous glycoproteins and that this could have a role in the altered physical properties of mucous secretions in CF.\r"

  ".W": "We previously showed that a panel of monoclonal antibodies (MAb) (5E8, 5C7, and 1F10) that detect serum tumor-associated antigens (TAA) could distinguish patients with lung cancer from those without to a highly significant degree. However, among patients with lung cancer, the frequency and clinical importance of serum TAA expression were not established. Therefore, we analyzed the serum and initial clinical characteristics of 52 Philadelphia VA patients with newly diagnosed lung cancer seen over a 13-month period. A modified semiquantitative ELISA was employed to determine MAb reactivity. Our cohort was characterized by a mean age of 65 +/- 9 year (SD) and mean Karnovsky score of 74 +/- 10; marked weight loss was present in 28 subjects, and 39 presented with either Stage III or IV disease. The panel detected TAAs in 38 of 52 cases (sensitivity 73%; 95% Cl, 60-83%), including 13 of 22 squamous cell, 9 of 12 adenocarcinoma, 10 of 11 undifferentiated, and 6 of 7 small cell carcinomas. No significant differences were found between the reactive and nonreactive patients in terms of age, stage at presentation, histologic subtype, performance status, or weight loss. However, 1F10 and 5C7 were each associated with a greater risk of early death by Cox proportional hazard analysis (p = 0.017 and 0.006, respectively) even when other prognostic variables are accounted for. We conclude that specific serum TAA can be detected in the majority of lung cancer patients with all major histologic subtypes in a cohort with advanced tumors and poor prognostic indices.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Ceruloplasmin is one of the main serum antioxidants, and this defect in ferroxidase activity most likely accounts for the previously observed decrease in smoker serum antioxidant activity. This defect may be related to oxidation of ceruloplasmin in the lung. We hypothesized that vitamin E might be able to reverse the decrease in smoker ferroxidase activity and thus restore serum antioxidant activity. To test this hypothesis, we administered high-dose vitamin E to a group of young asymptomatic cigarette smokers (n = 8). Although serum levels of vitamin E significantly increased (8.7 +/- 0.8 to 20.6 +/- 3.1 micrograms/ml, p = 0.01), the ferroxidase activity of smoker serum (0.139 +/- 0.02 (0.139 +/- 0.02 to 0.144 +/- 0.03 U/ml, p = 0.824), and the antioxidant activity of serum (45.8 +/- 7.2 to 51.6 +/- 8.4%, p = 0.587) remained unchanged. Thus, at the current dose and duration of supplementation, vitamin E was unable to reverse the defect in smoker serum ferroxidase activity and thus unable to augment the antioxidant capacity of the serum.\r"

Pentoxifylline (PTX), a methylxanthine, protects against TNF-induced and sepsis-induced acute lung injury in vivo. We now report on in vitro cellular studies of PMN-mediated cellular injury and its attenuation. We studied TNF-induced bovine pulmonary artery endothelial cell (EC) cytotoxicity both with and without PMN. A 51Cr release assay was used to measure EC damage. Further, we investigated PMN function in response to TNF by measuring chemiluminescence. Agents that attenuate EC damage and PMN activation were evaluated in the above assays. Results revealed that TNF causes EC injury (p less than 0.05) and PMN increase TNF-induced EC injury. Furthermore, PTX, aminophylline (AMPH), caffeine, and forskolin attenuate TNF-induced EC cytotoxicity only in the presence of PMN (p less than 0.05). Of interest, dibutyryl cAMP (DBcAMP) protects EC from TNF-induced injury both with and without PMN. Agents that may increase cAMP levels in PMN (PTX, DBcAMP, forskolin, isobutyl methylxanthine, and terbutaline) significantly attenuate TNF-induced PMN chemiluminescence (p less than 0.05). We conclude that TNF causes EC damage and PMN increase this damage. Furthermore, PTX, AMPH, caffeine, and forskolin can attenuate TNF-induced EC injury in the presence of PMN, whereas DBcAMP attenuates TNF-induced EC injury with and without PMN. In addition, agents that may increase intracellular cAMP levels in PMN can attenuate TNF-induced PMN chemiluminescence. Thus, these agents likely attenuate TNF-induced PMN-mediated EC injury through their inhibitory effects on PMN.\r"

In chronic diffuse interstitial lung diseases, elevated PCP concentrations have been found in serum as well as in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. It has been proposed that PCP is a marker of early, active stages of fibrosis. As severe fibrosis is a frequent complication in adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), we investigated PCP in patients with ARDS and compared the results with those from patients requiring mechanical ventilation because of heart failure and after neurosurgical and surgical interventions, and those from spontaneously breathing patients, including healthy volunteers and patients with pneumonia, liver cirrhosis, and renal failure. PCP concentrations in patients with ARDS were extremely elevated compared with those in control subjects (p less than 0.001) and correlated positively with FiO2 (r = 0.71, p less than 0.01). These results support the pathophysiologic concept of early fibrogenesis in ARDS. As preventing pulmonary fibrosis in ARDS is essential in improving survival rate, we believe PCP can be a valuable diagnostic tool in ARDS.\r"

  ".W": "We investigated the effect of pentoxifylline (PTX) on the development of pulmonary edema in a model of adult respiratory distress syndrome in rabbits. Lung injury was induced by repeated saline lavages in adult rabbits weighing 2.5 to 3.5 kg. Rabbits pretreated with PTX (20 mg/kg bolus followed by 20 mg/kg/h infusion) developed significantly lower amounts of lung edema 4 h after saline lavage (extravascular lung water to dry weight ratio [W/D], 6.9 +/- 0.6 SD versus 8.9 +/- 0.5 in control animals). PTX produced a 25% increase in cardiac output, but there were no differences between treated and untreated groups in calculated pulmonary vascular resistance or microvascular pressure. To determine whether PTX could have lowered pulmonary venous resistance and thus lowered effective microvascular pressure for fluid filtration, we directly measured pulmonary artery and left atrial pressures, and measured by micropuncture the pressure in 20 to 40 microns subpleural venules in four open-chested rabbits 3 to 4 h after lavage. Venous resistance was low (venous pressure drop 0.9 +/- 0.1 mm Hg) and was unchanged by PTX infusion. To determine if PTX decreased lung water by accelerating active alveolar fluid reabsorption, a single 60-ml aliquot of saline was instilled into the lungs of normal rabbits treated with saline or PTX. Both groups had a similar decrease in lung water content 1 and 4 h later. Our data indicate that PTX reduces edema formation in rabbits after saline lavage, not by lowering microvascular pressures for fluid filtration or by acceleration alveolar fluid reabsorption, but possibly by its anti-inflammatory effect on neutrophil function.\r"

The standard therapy for TPE is a 3-wk course of diethylcarbamazine (DEC) following which there is almost always a marked improvement in all parameters. However, clinical observations suggest that the disease can persist despite DEC therapy and lead to chronic dyspnea with restrictive lung impairment. To evaluate the concept that DEC therapy is not completely \"curative\" for TPE, but rather leaves most individuals with a mild, chronic form of TPE defined by persistent inflammation of the lower respiratory tract, we evaluated 23 individuals an average of 12 +/- 2 months following a standard 3-wk course of diethylcarbamazine for acute TPE. In the majority there were mild, persistent symptoms referrable to the lung, chest X-ray abnormalities, blood eosinophilia, and elevated serum IgE and filarial specific IgG. On the average, lung function was consistent with the presence of chronic, mild interstitial lung disease. When the inflammatory cells from the lower respiratory tract were examined, there was a persistent eosinophilic alveolitis (TPE/post-DEC 1769 +/- 376 eosinophils/microliters epithelial lining fluid; normal subjects 256 +/- 38, p less than 0.02). Evaluation of the lower respiratory tract inflammatory cells recovered from the TPE/post-DEC-treated individuals demonstrated spontaneous release of exaggerated amounts of O2-. and H2O2 compared to normal subjects (p less than 0.05, both comparisons).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Antiovalbumin (OA)-IgG1 was isolated by affinity chromatography from serum derived from actively immunized Hartley guinea pigs. Propranolol and pyrilamine pretreated, IgG1-PS guinea pigs were challenged with aerosolized antigen and pulmonary obstruction was quantified by measurements of excised lung gas volume (ELGV). ELGV increased between 150 and 1,035% in a dose-proportional fashion with increasing antigen exposure (0.001 to 0.1% nebulizer concentration). The leukotriene antagonists ICI-204,219 and SKF-104,353 exhibited dose-proportional inhibitions in antigen-induced elevations in ELGV, inhibiting up to 65 and 87% at the maximal concentrations examined. Similarly, the platelet-activating factor (PAF) antagonists WEB-2086 and L-659,989 inhibited antigen-induced elevations in ELGV, inhibiting up to 94 and 59% at the maximal concentrations examined. In contrast, the cyclooxygenase (CO) inhibitor piroxicam significantly enhanced (p less than 0.05) the OA-induced elevations in ELGV. Aerosolized PAF challenge produced dose-proportional elevations in ELGV that were significantly inhibited by the LTD, antagonist ICI-204,219 (38 and 43% inhibition) and the CO inhibitor piroxicam (62 and 48% inhibition) in sensitized and nonsensitized animals, respectively.

The concentration of gentamicin and tobramycin in ALF reached a peak after 5 and 10 min, respectively, and remained high when plasma concentrations were declining, suggesting an accumulation reservoir in the lung acini. The ratio of the AUC of the concentration-time profile in ALF and plasma was 0.67 and 0.45 for gentamicin and tobramycin, respectively. The penetration of both aminoglycosides into the ALF was significantly higher after induction of airway inflammation by inhalation of endotoxin. The ratio of the AUC in ALF and plasma in the endotoxin-exposed animals was 0.76 and 0.55 for gentamicin and tobramycin, respectively. The ratio of the AUC of the concentration-time profile of gentamicin in ALF to that of tobramycin was 1.27 without inflammation and 1.44 after endotoxin exposure. Thus, both with and without inflammation, gentamicin penetrates better into the ALF than does tobramycin.\r"

  ".W": "We have investigated the effects of bradykinin (Bk) antagonists on Bk-induced airway microvascular leakage and bronchoconstriction in mechanically ventilated guinea pigs by simultaneous measuring extravasation of Evans blue dye and airway opening pressure (Pao). Bradykinin (1 microgram/kg intravenously) significantly increased leakage of dye in trachea, main bronchi, and intrapulmonary airways, and increased Pao, indicating airway narrowing. The selective Bk B2 antagonist D-Arg-[Hyp3-Thi5,8-D-Phe7]-Bk (NPC 349; 400 micrograms/kg intravenously) did not alter basal leakage, but when given 2 min before Bk, significantly inhibited the Bk-induced plasma extravasation by 99.8% in the trachea (p less than 0.05), by 75.9% in main bronchi (p less than 0.05), by 83.5% in proximal intrapulmonary airways (p less than 0.05), and by 91.5% in distal intrapulmonary airways (p less than 0.05). NPC 349 also reduced the increase in Pao induced by Bk by 73.5% (p less than 0.05) without affecting the basal Pao. However, NPC 349 had no inhibitory effect on Bk-induced leak or bronchoconstriction when given 30 min before Bk. By contrast, the B1 antagonist des Arg9-Leu8-Bk (500 micrograms/kg intraveneously) had no effect on the Bk-increased plasma extravasation and Pao. We conclude that Bk increases airway plasma leakage and bronchoconstriction via activation of B2 receptors.\r"

Both basophil reactivity (maximal percent histamine release) and basophil sensitivity (the concentration that causes 50% of maximal percent histamine release: HC50) to Der p l in patients with asthma were similar to those in patients with allergic rhinitis. On the contrary, basophil reactivity to anti-IgE was significantly higher in patients with asthma (58.0 +/- 3.6%) than in patients with allergic rhinitis (46.3 +/- 5.2%; p less than 0.05). Both groups of patients showed an increased releasability compared to control subjects (27.3 +/- 4.6%; p less than 0.001), whereas there were no significant differences in basophil sensitivity to anti-IgE among the three groups of donors. Differences were also found with respect to basophil reactivity and sensitivity to f-met peptide, whereas no differences appeared when basophils from the three groups of donors were challenged with the Ca2+ ionophore A23187. There was a significant correlation between basophil reactivity and sensitivity to Der p l and to anti-IgE in both asthmatic and allergic rhinitis patients. A significant correlation was found between basophil reactivity and sensitivity to anti-IgE and serum IgE level only in patients with bronchial asthma, whereas no correlations were found in patients with allergic rhinitis. There was no correlation between in vivo mast cell releasability and in vitro basophil releasability in response to Der p l in either group of allergic patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Airways responsiveness to leukotriene (LT) C4, LTD4, LTE4, histamine, and methacholine have been studied in eight asthmatic and six normal subjects. Airways responsiveness to each bronchoconstrictor agonist was assessed by constructing cumulative dose-response curves, and the dose that produced a 35% decrease in specific airways conductance (PD35) was obtained by linear interpolation. Airways of subjects with asthma were approximately 14-, 15-, 6-, 9-, and 219-fold more responsive to histamine, methacholine, LTC4, LTD4, and LTE4, respectively, than were normal subjects. Thus, there was a substantially augmented level of hyperresponsiveness to LTE4 in bronchial asthma, which was not observed for the other bronchoconstrictor agents, when compared to normal subjects. In contrast to LTC4 and LTD4, as histamine and methacholine responsiveness increase, the dose ratio of histamine to LTE4 (PD35 histamine/PD35 LTE4) and the dose ratio of methacholine to LTE4 also tended to increase. This suggests that as the nonspecific airways responsiveness increases, the relative potency of LTE4 also increases, whereas potency of LTC4 and LTD4 decrease. These results suggest that the mechanism of the bronchoconstriction induced by LTE4 may be distinct from that produced by LTC4 or LTD4 in subjects with asthma. This may reflect leukotriene subtype receptor heterogeneity in asthmatic airways.\r"

  ".U": "91052712\r", 
  ".W": "The airways of the guinea pig are innervated by four types of autonomic nerves: cholinergic excitatory, adrenergic inhibitory, nonadrenergic noncholinergic (NANC) excitatory, and NANC inhibitory. Tachykinins (neurokinins A and B and substance P) are believed to mediate NANC excitatory responses, and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) has been proposed as the chemical mediator of the NANC inhibitory system. Enzymatic degradation represents an important means by which the biologic actions of neurotransmitters are terminated. In the present study, relaxation responses of guinea pig tracheae to NANC nerve stimulation and to exogenous VIP administration were compared in the absence and presence of various peptidase inhibitors. NANC inhibitory responses elicited by electrical field stimulation were unaffected by aprotinin or soybean trypsin inhibitor but were depressed by thiorphan or leupeptin. Concentration-response curves to exogenous VIP were shifted to the left by soybean trypsin inhibitor but were not affected by aprotinin, leupeptin, or thiorphan. After tachykinin depletion with capsaicin, thiorphan also induced a leftward shift in the VIP concentration-response curve. Under the same conditions, thiorphan failed to influence NANC inhibitory responses. These results indicate that the NANC inhibitory neurotransmitter is not metabolized by enzymes susceptible to inhibition by aprotinin, leupeptin, soybean trypsin inhibitor, or thiorphan and, accordingly, distinguish NANC nervous responses from those induced by VIP. The results also suggest that the NANC excitatory system can interact functionally with the NANC inhibitory system, as evidenced by the blunting of NANC relaxation responses following inhibition of tachykinin metabolism and elimination of this effect by capsaicin.\r"

  ".W": "The aim of the present investigation was to study in human bronchial smooth muscle (1) the relationship between methacholine and histamine-induced inositol phosphate (IP) production and contraction, (2) the influence of increasing concentrations of methacholine and histamine on the relaxation (pD2 and Emax) by isoproterenol (functional antagonism), and (3) the relation between IP production by methacholine and histamine and the changes of pD2 and Emax values of isoproterenol-induced relaxation. Methacholine and histamine were full agonists in contracting human bronchial smooth muscle, with pD2 values of 6.01 +/- 0.18 and 6.07 +/- 0.04, respectively. With IP production, however, pD2 values of 4.90 +/- 0.06 for methacholine and 5.15 +/- 0.16 for histamine were obtained, indicating a considerable reserve of PI metabolism for contraction. With increasing concentrations of histamine and methacholine (to 1 and 0.1 mM, respectively), subsequently performed dose-relaxation curves with isoproterenol showed decreasing values of pD2 (from 8.25 +/- 0.20 to 7.28 +/- 0.28) and Emax (from 100% to 56.7 +/- 12.4%). No differences were observed between methacholine and histamine in this respect. A significant correlation was found between IP production induced by the various concentrations of methacholine and histamine and the reduction of isoproterenol pD2 and Emax values. The results strongly suggest that PI metabolism may play an important role in the reduced efficacy of beta-adrenoceptor agonists to induce bronchodilation during active and severe asthma.\r"

  ".U": "91052714\r", 
  ".W": "Several studies have suggested that in asthmatics the quantities of inflammatory mediators such as histamine, thromboxane A2 (TxA2), prostaglandin D2 (PGD2), prostaglandin F2 alpha (PGF2 alpha), and leukotriene C4 (LTC4) that are present in the airway lumen are related to the degree of bronchial responsiveness to inhaled methacholine (MCh). Therefore, we studied the effect of these mediators on the cholinergic responsiveness of isolated human airway segments. Lung tissue collected at thoracotomy from 30 patients was studied. Dose-response curves to MCh were obtained from bronchial segments before, during, and after incubation with either a subthreshold or a threshold concentration of histamine (10(-10) or 10(-8) M), the stable TxA2 analogue U46619 (10(-11) or 10(-9) M), PGD2 (5 x 10(-9) or 5 x 10(-7) M), PGF2 alpha (10(-9) or 10(-7) M), or LTC4 (10(-11) or 10(-9) M). With the exception of LTC4, the presence of any of these mediators at either concentration increased the sensitivity to MCh by a factor of 1.1 to 2 (p less than 0.05, ANOVA). This increase did not depend on the dose of the mediator (p greater than 0.05, ANOVA). These data indicate that mediator-induced muscle hypersensitivity can explain a small part of the leftward shift of the dose-response curve to inhaled MCh as observed in asthma.\r"

We measured the response of respiratory system mechanics in 10 ventilated infants (25 +/- 2 days of age) to 75, 125, and 175 micrograms ipratropium bromide (IB), 125 micrograms IB plus 0.04 mg salbutamol (SAL), 175 micrograms IB plus 0.04 mg SAL, and saline vehicle, delivered via nebulizer into the ventilator circuit. Respiratory system resistance (Rrs) and compliance (Crs) were measured by the passive flow-volume technique. Rrs and Crs were measured before and at 1 to 2 h and at 4 h after delivery of the five drug dosages or saline. All six studies were completed within a 72-h period. Saline had no significant effect on mechanics. Significant responses to ipratropium alone were seen only after 175 micrograms where Rrs decreased 20 +/- 3% (SEM) (p less than 0.05) at 1 to 2 h and 16 +/- 5% (p less than 0.05) at 4 h. After 125 micrograms IB + SAL and 175 micrograms IB + SAL, Rrs was significantly decreased both at 1 to 2 h and at 4 h, and Crs was significantly increased 20 +/- 6% and 20 +/- 4%, respectively, at 1 to 2 h.

However, those studies used partial maximal expiratory flow volume (PMEFV) curves to assess lung function. In order to directly compare responsiveness between infants and older children, we compared bronchial responsiveness to histamine between a group of 45 normal infants, median age 4 wk (range 2 to 6 wk) and a group of 30 nonasthmatic older children, median age 10 yr (range 5 to 15 yr) using PMEFV curves in both groups to assess lung function. In the infant group, PMEFV curves were generated using the forced expiratory flow volume technique. For the older children, PMEFV curves were generated by voluntary effort. The provocative concentration of histamine that produced a 40% fall (PC40) in maximum flow at functional residual capacity (VmaxFRC) was calculated from the PMEFV curves. The geometric mean PC40 of the infants (1.02 g/L) was lower than the geometric mean of the older children (3.4 g/L) (p less than 0.001). However, these results were then corrected for dilution of the aerosol due to air entrainment (AE). Corrected values of PC40 were not significantly different between infants and older children. These results demonstrate the importance of accounting for AE in the evaluation of histamine responsiveness and suggest that bronchial responsiveness may be similar in normal infants and older children.\r"

On the control day, they were subjected to four hyperventilation tests to ensure functional stability. On the 3 remaining days, after a first hyperventilation test, they inhaled placebo, albuterol, or formoterol in randomized, double-blind fashion.

The dose of hyperventilation of cold air causing a 20% fall in FEV1 (PD20) was interpolated on the dose-response curve. The magnitude of the blocking effect at each time interval on each study day was assessed by comparing the changes in PD20 from baseline with the within-day variability of PD20 (standardized change in PD20). The acute bronchodilator effect was not significantly different as assessed 15 min (21 +/- 14% for albuterol and 18 +/- 18% for formoterol) and 1 h (20 +/- 13% for albuterol and 18 +/- 17% for formoterol) after administering the medication. The duration of the blocking effect, defined as the return to 2 SD from the standardized change in PD20, was significantly more prolonged for formoterol (8.0 +/- 3.4 h) than for albuterol (3.0 +/- 1.7 h) (t = 4.2, p less than 0.0001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

An allergen challenge given in the morning produced a LAR in 4 of 10 subjects, while the same challenge in the evening caused a LAR in 9 of 10 (p less than 0.05). The time to onset of the LAR following the morning and evening challenges was 9.4 +/- 2.0 h versus 3.1 +/- 0.3 h, respectively (p less than 0.05). The maximal decrease in FEV1 for the LAR was 32.8 +/- 5.6% for the morning challenge versus 43.0 +/- 3.1% in the evening (p less than 0.05). Additionally, the bronchial responsiveness to methacholine was significantly greater at 24 h following evening allergen challenge than after the morning (p less than 0.05) challenge.

The objective of this study was to determine the extent of pulmonary function decrements, respiratory discomfort, and increased airway reactivity to methacholine induced by exposure to O3 below 0.12 ppm. Separate 6.6-h chamber exposures to 0.00, 0.08, 0.10, and 0.12 ppm O3 included six 50-min periods of moderate exercise (VE approximately equal to 39 L/min, HR approximately equal to 115 bpm, and VO2 approximately equal to 1.5 L/min). Each exercise period was followed by 10 min of rest. A 35-min lunch break was included midway through the exposure. Although not intended as an exact simulation, the overall duration, intensity, and metabolic requirements of the exercise performed were representative of a day of moderate to heavy work or play. Preexposure FEV1 averaged 4.39 L, and essentially no change (+0.03 L) occurred with exposure to 0.00 ppm O3. Significant decreases (p less than 0.01) of -0.31, -0.30, and -0.54 L were observed with exposures to 0.08, 0.10, and 0.12 ppm, respectively. The provocative dose of methacholine required to increase airway resistance by 100% (PD100) was 58 cumulative inhalation units (CIU) following exposure to 0.00 ppm and was significantly reduced (p less than 0.01) to 37 CIU at 0.08, 31 CIU at 0.10, and 26 CIU at 0.12 ppm O3; reductions in PD100 are considered indicative of increases in nonspecific airway responsiveness.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We evaluated alternative formulations of pentamidine that might reduce the airway irritation associated with aerosolized pentamidine isoethionate. Specifically, we assessed the biodistribution, histologic response, and lung retention of the isoethionate, gluconate, and lactate salts of pentamidine after aerosol administration to mice. For each of the three aerosolized salts tested, greater than 50% of the pentamidine initially recovered from the lungs after one dose was still retained there 14 days later. Thus, significant levels of pentamidine, aerosolized as three different salts, are retained in the lung for at least 2 wk after a single dose. The three salts of pentamidine each produced high lung to extrapulmonary drug ratios, the converse of that produced by intravenous injection of pentamidine isoethionate. At very high aerosol doses, the ability of the lung to retain pentamidine appeared saturable. Even aerosolized daily for 2 wk at very high doses, none of the three pentamidine salts produced histologic evidence of organ toxicity. A Phase 1 trial of aerosolized pentamidine gluconate in AIDS-PCP patients is now in progress to determine if this approach can reduce airway irritation.\r"

The degree of their avian contact and pigeon-related symptoms were noted, humoral immune response in the form of IgG antibody to pigeon gamma globulin was quantified, and diffusing capacity and total lung capacity were measured. Thirteen fanciers who had a high level of antibody had increased rates of clearance of 99mTc-DTPA (mean half-time clearance of 16.8 [+/- SEM 2.02] min [p = 0.001]) even if they were asymptomatic and even if their diffusing capacity and total lung capacity were normal. Seven control subjects without exposure to pigeon-derived antigens had normal clearance (mean 72.6 [+/- 5.98] min), and seven fanciers with antigen exposure but without an antibody response had intermediate rates of clearance (mean 42.57 [+/- 5.11] min). Clearance was not directly related to the indices of intensity and duration of antigen exposure. The measurement of rate of clearance of 99mTc-DTPA in pigeon fanciers can identify an alteration in pulmonary integrity more subtle than found with conventional pulmonary function tests and may therefore be a useful test for studying the pulmonary response to inhaled antigen and for detecting the earliest stages in the evolution of hypersensitivity pneumonitis.\r"

Lung function was measured at the schools, and information on respiratory symptoms was collected from a self-administered questionnaire completed by the parents of the children. Nitrogen dioxide was measured in the homes of all children with Palmes' diffusion tubes. In addition, information on smoking and dampness in the home was collected by questionnaire. There was no relationship between exposure to nitrogen dioxide in the home and respiratory symptoms. Respiratory symptoms were found to be associated with exposure to tobacco smoke and home dampness. There was a weak, negative association between maximal midexpiratory flow (MMEF) and exposure to nitrogen dioxide. FEV1, peak expiratory flow, and MMEF were all negatively associated with exposure to tobacco smoke. Home dampness was not associated with pulmonary function. Lung function growth, measured over a period of 2 yr, was not consistently associated with any of the indoor exposure variables. The development of respiratory symptoms over time was not associated with indoor exposure to nitrogen dioxide. There was a significant association between exposure to environmental tobacco smoke in the home and the development of wheeze. There was also a significant association between home dampness and the development of cough.\r"

However, clinical, roentgenographic, histologic, and microanalytic description of these workers are lacking. This is a report of nine Al2O3-exposed workers with abnormal chest roentgenograms (profusion greater than or equal to 1/0, ILO/UC) from a plant engaged in the production of Al2O3 abrasives from alundum ore. Mean duration of exposure was 25 yr, and time since first exposure was 28 yr. in a subgroup of three, the severity of symptoms, reduction in the forced vital capacity (67% predicted) and diffusing capacity (51% predicted), and progressive roentgenographic changes (profusion greater than or equal to 2/2) prompted open lung biopsy. Lung tissue was analyzed by scanning electron microscopy and electron microprobe analysis. In each of the three biopsies, interstitial fibrosis with honeycombing was seen on routine section. In one biopsy, silica and asbestos fiber counts were at the low end of the range seen with silicosis and asbestosis; however, the absence of asbestos bodies and silicotic nodules suggested that the fibrosis was due to another cause. Metals occurred in amounts several orders of magnitude above background, and the majority was aluminum as Al2O3 and aluminum alloys. The findings in these nine workers suggests a common exposure as the possible cause. The nonspecific pathologic findings, absence of asbestos bodies and silicotic nodules, and the striking number of aluminum-containing particles suggest that Al2O3 is that common exposure. The possibility of \"mixed dust\" fibrosis should also be considered.\r"

  ".W": "The rare P-family of alpha 1-antitrypsin (alpha 1AT) variants is defined by the position of migration of the alpha 1AT protein on isoelectric focusing of serum (IEF) between the common M and S variants. To begin to examine the molecular heterogeneity among the P-type alleles, two unrelated subjects and their families identified by IEF to be carrying a P allele were analyzed. The first, Plowell, is a deficiency allele associated with reduced serum alpha 1AT levels, and the second, Psaint albans, is associated with normal serum levels. DNA sequence analysis of Plowell, the more anodal of the two variants on IEF analysis, showed that if differed from the normal M1(Val213) allele by a single base and amino acid substitution Asp256 GAT----Val GTT. In contrast, Psaint albans, a slightly more cathodally positioned variant on IEF analysis, differed from the coding exons of the normal M1(Val213) allele by two mutations, Asp341 GAC----Asn AAC, and a silent substitution in the same codon as the Plowell variant, Asp256 GAT----Asp GAC. Evaluation of Plowell mRNA transcripts by Northern and cytoblot analyses demonstrated they were of normal size and amount, and Plowell mRNA transcripts could be translated normally in vitro. Retroviral insertion of the Plowell cDNA into the genome of 3T3 fibroblasts demonstrated that it directed the synthesis of alpha 1AT, but at levels 24% that of the Psaint albans cDNA or the normal M1 (Val213) cDNA, with a pattern of biosynthesis consistent with the concept that the Plowell alpha 1AT deficiency state results from intracellular degradation of the newly synthesized Plowell protein.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The effect of phospholipase A2 (Naja naja) PLA2) on mean arterial blood pressure and intratracheal pressure was examined in anesthetized guinea pigs. Intracheally administered PLA2 (1 to 10 U) produced acute, dose-dependent increases in mean arterial blood pressure and intracheal pressure. However, Intravenously administered PLA2 (doses as large as 1,000 U) did not alter monitored variables. Acute PLA2-induced morphologic alterations were characterized by airway constriction, airway/alveolar cell damage, and pulmonary sequestration of both leukocytes and platelets. PLA2-induced increases in both mean arterial blood pressure and intratracheal pressure were attenuated to varying degrees by pretreating intravenously with indomethacin (10 mg/kg), a cyclooxygenase inhibitor, and WEB 2086 (0.1 mg/kg), a platelet-activating factor antagonist. Both ICI 198,615 (1 mg/kg), a leukotriene D4, receptor antagonist given intravenously, and dexamethasone (50 mg/kg), a steroidal anti-inflammatory agent given intraperitoneally as a 2-day pretreatment, reduced PLA2-induced increases in intratracheal pressure. Pyrilamine (2 mg/kg), a histamine1-receptor antagonist given intravenously, did not modify PLA2-induced pathophysiologic responses. Guinea pigs exposed to aerosolized PLA2 (100 U/ml) exhibited evidence of increased bronchoalveolar lavage macrophage, leukocyte, and lymphocyte accumulation at 24 h post-PLA2. These studies suggest that in vivo PLA2-induced pathophysiologic changes in the guinea pig involve alterations in resident airway cell populations as well as sequestration and infiltration of inflammatory cells. Both eicosanoids and platelet-activating factor appear to contribute to these PLA2-induced pathophysiologic effects.\r"

This study was designed to determine if high-resolution computerized tomography (CT) could be used to define bronchiectasis in patients with suspected disease. Sixteen patients with asthma were studied. All demonstrated immediate cutaneous reactivity to common aeroallergens including Aspergillus fumigatus. Eight patients had clinical and immunologic evidence of ABPA. Six to 12 high-resolution CT sections (1.5 mm) were obtained at 1- to 2-cm intervals from the aortic knob to the dome of the diaphragm. All radiographs were evaluated separately by two readers in a blinded fashion and graded as to the presence and type of bronchial dilatation and bronchial wall thickening. Bronchial dilatation was seen in 41% of lung lobes in the ABPA group compared to 15% in the non-ABPA asthmatic control group. Upper lobe involvement and bronchial wall thickening was common to both groups. The presence of bronchiectasis in the control group may indicate that asthma is a more destructive lung disease than is currently appreciated. High-resolution CT of the chest has been shown in previous studies to have a sensitivity and specificity approaching that of bronchography, and the current findings support its use in the detection of bronchiectasis in patients with asthma suspected of having ABPA.\r"

Sputum was repeatedly examined and yielded, among other organisms, Clostridium inocuum, Enterobacter, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Staphylococcus aureus. On one microscopic examination of sputum, the presence of feculent material was suspected. A subsequent gastrografin enema revealed a cologastric and colobronchial fistula between the splenic flexture of the colon and the greater curve of the stomach and the bronchial system. Segmental resection of the colon and resection of the lower lobe of the left lung were performed. Histologic findings of the resected colon were consistent with Crohn's disease. After a long period of postoperative recovery, the patient returned to good general health and well-being. To our knowledge, a colobronchial fistula caused by Crohn's colitis has not been previously reported.\r"

The treatment was completed by 97 children (83%). The mean weight gain during therapy was 2,145 g. There was an excellent clinicoradiologic response to the treatment, and improvement in chest roentgenograms was observed in all patients at the end of therapy.

Antithrombin III was significantly lower (0.87%) when elastase was above the normal range (greater than 14.2 micrograms/ml). Elastase was significantly higher (30.6 micrograms/ml), when antithrombin III was less than normal. These data indicate that elevated serum elastase is associated with a significant reduction in circulating antithrombin III.

Of the 19 patients initially treated nonoperatively, resolution occurred in nine (47%); stage of infection did not effect outcome. Surgical drainage was required in the remainder; two cancers were found. FNA cytology in these (and all) patients was negative for malignancy. All underwent mammography during treatment. In 17 (77%) cancer was considered of low probability. The only patient with a mammogram highly suspicious for cancer had fat necrosis on biopsy. Bacterial cultures were positive in 79 per cent, virtually all with Gram (+) cocci. Four patients harbored Gram (-) organisms as well, two in concert with breast cancer. Conclusions: 1) select breast infections can be successfully managed nonoperatively, 2) the accuracy of FNA and mammography in the diagnosis of breast cancer may be impaired by coincident infection, 3) the finding of a Gram (-) breast infection warrants abandonment of nonoperative management in favor of tissue confirmation of the disease process.\r"

In order to prevent a resurgence of the starch peritonitis syndrome we must continue to emphasize the importance of washing gloves, maintain the quality control and purity of the powder used, and be cognizant of the signs and symptoms so that such cases may be managed nonoperatively.\r"

As is frequently characteristic of new technologic procedures, the initial evaluation of the success rate of the procedure is overly optimistic. The procedure carries a considerable complication rate (13%) and mortality rate (15%). Most importantly, success is usually evident early; within the first 24 to 48 hours. After this length of time, careful evaluation to consider further treatment should be contemplated.\r"

Intravenous administration of increasing calcium doses (3.75, 4.37, and 4.75 mg Ca/g-BW) resulted in increasing serum calcium levels (11.4, 14.4, 15.2, respectively vs. animals not injected, 9.5 mg/dl). Mice injected with E. coli bacterial endotoxin after injection of calcium demonstrated significantly (P less than 0.05) lowered serum calcium concentrations (10.5, 12.1, 12.5, respectively). The magnitude of serum calcium reduction was related to the level just prior to endotoxin administration. Mitochondria were incubated using a Percoll purification step. The effect of pretreating the animal in vivo with calcium, endotoxin or calcium plus endotoxin versus control was investigated in both liver and skeletal muscle. When mitochondria were incubated in medium containing EGTA (free Ca less than 1 X 10(-9)). no significant difference between groups was observed in either (RCR) or mitochondrial calcium content. When mitochondria were incubated in EGTA buffers containing calcium (free Ca approximately 7 X 10(-7) liver, 1 X 10(-7) muscle) significant differences in RCR and mitochondrial calcium content were observed. Liver RCR increased significantly with calcium or endotoxin pretreatment (2.20, 2.43 vs. 1.86). Muscle mitochondrial RCR significantly decreased with calcium administration (5.02 vs. 6.79). Both liver and muscle mitochondrial calcium content significantly decreased (2.54 vs. 27.32, and 6.46 vs. 25.82 nMole Ca/mg mitochondrial protein). Preloading with calcium prevented the decline in mitochondrial calcium content. Findings suggest that the reduction in intramitochondrial calcium content during endotoxemia could be an effector of metabolic derangement specifically through calcium-dependent intramitochondrial enzymes.\r"

  ".W": "The diagnosis of pancreatic injury is often difficult because it lies retroperitoneally in a protected area. Delayed diagnosis and treatment of blunt pancreatic trauma can result in significant morbidity and mortality. Endoscopic Retrograde Pancreatography (ERP) is infrequently used in the diagnosis of pancreatic injury. We reviewed our experience with the use of ERP in patients with blunt pancreatic injury. Two stable patients with traumatic pancreatitis underwent ERP shortly after injury. CT scans revealed a transverse fracture of the distal pancrease in one and fluid accumulation in the other around the pancreas extending to the right kidney and left hepatic lobe. The absence of ductal disruption on ERP allowed nonoperative management of the pancreatitis. Resolution was documented by the absence of symptoms on regular oral intake, normal serum amylase levels, and normal follow-up CT scans. A third patient with persistent fistulae three months postinjury underwent preoperative ERP revealing ductal obstruction. This facilitated the planning of a distal pancreatectomy and subsequently the fistulae healed. A fourth patient underwent an exploratory laparotomy on the basis of clinical and CT scan findings that could have been circumvented with preoperative ERP. ERP in selected patients allows nonoperative treatment in the absence of ductal injury or earlier operative treatment of ductal injury. It also aids the treatment of late complications by delineating ductal anatomy.\r"

There was one early graft failure and in the five completely autogenous reconstructions, graft patency and limb salvage had been achieved during a follow-up ranging from three to 22 months.

Preoperative evaluation of patients with these symptoms has traditionally included ultrasound and arch aortography angiograms of the area of the carotid bifurcation. Recent evidence has shown that ultrasound is more accurate in detection and morphologic delineation of these nonstenotic lesions. We analyzed the hospital records of 21 patients with ultrasonographic evidence of disease in whom arteriograms were negative. The patient group comprised 15 men and six women, with an average of 66 years. All patients had symptoms of hemispheric transient ischemic attacks and were evaluated with B-mode ultrasound and arteriography. Ultrasound was positive and arteriogram \"negative\" in all of the patients (i.e., described by the radiologist as without hemodynamic significant disease or ulceration, or as normal). The ultrasound diagnosis was confirmed at operation with findings of 20 to 50 per cent stenosis and ulcerative plaques. At retrospective review of the arteriograms, three ulcerations were found in the 21 patients. We conclude that B-mode ultrasound better defines nonstenotic ulcerative lesions and decisions to perform carotid endarterectomy may be based on either positive test. An ulcerative plaque by B-mode ultrasound and appropriate symptoms, therefore, may not require angiography before operation.\r"

This report describes the treatment of premature withdrawal by immediate endoscopic replacement. Over an 18-month period, 271 patients underwent insertion of a PEG. Five patients (1.8%) who inadvertently removed their gastrostomy tube within seven days of insertion were treated with immediate replacement using the retrograde string technique, avoiding laparotomy. All five PEGs were successfully replaced through the same gastrostomy site. Despite the presence of pneumoperitoneum, no patient developed peritonitis or other septic complications. Premature gastrostomy tube withdrawal is safely managed by endoscopic replacement and observation. Laparotomy is unnecessary and potentially meddlesome.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE: To assess the incidence of human immunodeficiency virus type 1(HIV-1) transmission by antibody (anti-HIV-1)-positive blood components, and to determine the immunologic and clinical course in HIV-1-infected recipients. DESIGN AND SUBJECTS: We retrospectively tested approximately 200,000 donor blood component specimens stored in late 1984 and 1985 for anti-HIV-1, and we contacted recipients of positive specimens to determine their serologic status. They were compared with both recipients of HIV-1-negative transfusions and healthy (untransfused) controls. Subjects were seen at 3- to 6-month intervals for up to 4 years for clinical and immunologic evaluations. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Of 133 recipients, 9 had other possible exposures. Excluding these cases, 111 of 124 (89.5%) were anti-HIV-1-positive (95% CI, 84.1% to 94.5%). The recipient's sex, age, underlying condition, and type of component did not influence infection rates. The cumulative risk for developing the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) within 38 months after transfusion was 13% (CI, 7.5% to 21.6%). At 36 +/- 3 months after the index transfusion, seropositive recipients had lower counts of CD2+CDw26+, CD4+, CD4+CD29+, and CD4+CD45RA+subsets and more CD8+I2+ lymphocytes than did recipients of anti-HIV-1-negative transfusions. The CD4+ and CD2+CDw26+subsets changed the most rapidly. The absolute CD8+ count remained normal. CONCLUSIONS: Transfusion of anti-HIV-1-positive blood infected 90% of recipients. The rate of progression to AIDS within the first 38 months after infection was similar to that reported for homosexual men and hemophiliacs. Although most lymphocyte subset counts changed over time, CD8+ counts were constant.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVES: To summarize the results of a 6-year, ongoing, prospective study of the risk for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) transmission among health care workers, and to estimate the magnitude of the risk for HIV-1 infection associated with different types of occupational exposures. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study; the median follow-up for employees sustaining parenteral exposures was 30.2 months (range, 6 to 69 months). SUBJECTS: Health care workers at the Clinical Center, National Institutes of Health, including those reporting parenteral and nonparenteral occupational exposures to HIV-1. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: One thousand three hundred and forty-four clinical health care workers reported 179 percutaneous and 346 mucous membrane exposures to fluids from HIV-1-infected patients during a 6-year period. Responding to a supplementary questionnaire, 559 of these workers reported 2712 cutaneous exposures to blood from HIV-1-infected patients and more than 10,000 cutaneous exposures to blood from all patients during a 12-month period. Occupational transmission of HIV-1 occurred in a single worker after a parenteral exposure to blood from an HIV-1-infected patient. No infections occurred after either mucous membrane or cutaneous exposures to blood from HIV-1-infected patients. Use of newer diagnostic technologies (for example, antigen detection, gene amplification) has not resulted in the identification of occupationally transmitted seronegative infections. CONCLUSIONS: Combining our results with those of other prospective studies, the risk for HIV-1 transmission associated with a percutaneous exposure to blood from an HIV-1-infected patient is approximately 0.3% per exposure (95% CI, 0.13% to 0.70%); the risks associated with occupational mucous membrane and cutaneous exposures are likely to be substantially smaller. These data support the use of barrier precautions and suggest a need for strategies that change health care providers' attitudes and behaviors.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the complication or death rate from carotid endarterectomy can be predicted from hospital and physician structural variables, such as the hospital's teaching status or the number of endarterectomies done by the surgeon per year. DESIGN: Survey of medical records. After controlling for the severity of the patient's condition on the basis of data in the medical record at the time of the endarterectomy, regression analyses were used to predict the postoperative stroke, heart attack, and 30-day death rate as a function of patient, physician, and hospital characteristics. SETTING: Three geographic areas (states or large parts of states; average population, 3 million) in the United States. PATIENTS: Random sample of 1302 patients 65 years of age or older having carotid endarterectomy in 1981. INTERVENTION: Carotid endarterectomy. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Of 1302 patients, 11.3% had a postoperative stroke or heart attack or died within 30 days of the operation. Patient age, race, income, and gender; physician volume, board certification status, and age; and hospital size, for-profit status, ownership, and teaching status were not significantly related to the postoperative complication or death rate. If the surgeon was a graduate of a foreign, but not a Western European or Canadian, medical school, however, the average complication or death rate rose from 10.4% to 19.6% (P less than 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The effectiveness of carotid endarterectomy depends heavily on its complication rate. Because complications after surgery cannot, in general, be predicted from structural variables, referring physicians cannot rely solely on the surgeon's experience and qualifications when recommending a carotid endarterectomy. The surgeon's and the hospital's actual postoperative complication and death rate should be considered.\r"

SETTING: Institutional sports injury clinic with primary and secondary care. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-five athletes (nineteen women) with scintigraphically confirmed stress fractures matched for sex, age, weight, height, and exercise history with 25 control athletes with no history of bone injury. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Bone mineral density measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry was significantly lower in athletes with fractures than in control athletes: In the spine, bone mineral density was 1.01 +/- 0.14 g/cm2 in athletes with fractures and 1.11 +/- 0.13 g/cm2 in control athletes (P = 0.02). In the femoral neck, it was 0.84 +/- 0.09 g/cm2 in athletes with fractures and 0.90 +/- 0.11 g/cm2 in control athletes (P = 0.005). It was also significantly lower in the Ward triangle (P = 0.01) and the greater trochanter (P = 0.01). Eight athletes with fractures and no control athletes had less than 90% of predicted age-related spine density (P = 0.01), and three athletes with fractures had bone mineral densities that were 2 SDs or more below this predicted level. More athletes with fractures than control athletes had current menstrual irregularity (amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea) (P less than 0.005). Fewer athletes with fractures were using oral contraceptives (P less than 0.05). Seven-day diet records indicated similar energy and nutrient intakes, except athletes with fractures had lower calcium intakes (697 +/- 242 mg/d compared with 832 +/- 309 mg/d; P = 0.02). Dairy product intake was lower in athletes with fractures since leaving high school (P less than 0.05). The incidence of a family history of osteoporosis was similar in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: In athletes with similar training habits, those with stress fractures are more likely to have lower bone density, lower dietary calcium intake, current menstrual irregularity, and lower oral contraceptive use.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE: To determine whether hyperplastic polyps found in the rectosigmoid area of the colon are associated with proximal adenomas, and to judge whether patients with distal hyperplastic polyps found during sigmoidoscopy might benefit from full colonoscopy. DESIGN: Data on patients having colonoscopy collected prospectively according to a set protocol. The size and location of all polyps were noted, and all polyps were biopsied. SETTING: Two university hospitals. PATIENTS: One thousand eight hundred and thirty-six consecutive patients referred for colonoscopy between 31 December 1987 and 31 August 1989. RESULTS: Of the 970 patients who met eligibility requirements, 274 (28.3%) had adenomas and 108 (11.1%) had hyperplastic polyps. The proportion of patients with distal hyperplastic polyps and proximal adenomas (31.9%) was similar to the proportion of those without distal hyperplastic polyps (23.0%) (crude odds ratio, 1.57; 95% CI, 0.77 to 3.06). After adjusting for age and sex, the results were unchanged (adjusted odds ratio, 1.53; CI, 0.82 to 2.88). Patients with distal adenomas, on the other hand, were three times more likely to have proximal adenomas than those without distal adenomas (adjusted odds ratio, 3.42; CI, 1.99 to 5.88). CONCLUSIONS: Distal hyperplastic polyps are not strong predictors of risk for proximal adenomas. Based on the magnitude of the risk difference, we do not believe that finding a hyperplastic polyp during sigmoidoscopy justifies doing a full colonoscopy to search for proximal adenomas. Because rectosigmoid adenomas are associated with proximal adenomas, however, small polyps seen during sigmoidoscopy should be biopsied to determine their type. Colonoscopy should be reserved for patients who are proved to have adenomas.\r"

SETTING: Single-institution tertiary care center. PATIENTS: One hundred twenty-three consecutive patients with non-small-cell lung cancer from whom a viable tumor specimen could be obtained. INTERVENTION: Tumor tissue was removed at the time of entry into a therapeutic protocol. The tumor tissue was processed in the laboratory for attempted cell-line establishment. Patients classified as potentially curable (stages I, II, and IIIA) were treated with surgical resection, radiation therapy, or a combination. Patients suitable for palliative therapy only (stages IIIB and IV) were treated with radiation therapy with or without chemotherapy. Chemotherapy was based on in-vitro drug sensitivity when available. Cell-line establishment was correlated to clinical outcome. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Univariate analysis of survival was done using the log-rank test; multivariate analysis was done by Cox modeling step-up and step-down techniques. Cell lines were established from the tumor specimens of 25 patients (20%). Those patients experienced a median survival of 7 months compared with 18 months in patients from whom cell lines could not be established (P less than 0.001). In the 61 patients with potentially curable disease, 8 patients (13%) with cell lines established had a median survival of 8 months compared with 32 months for those without cell lines established (P = 0.001). In the 62 palliative group patients, the median survival of the 17 patients (27%) from whom tumor cell lines were established was 5 months compared with 7 months for those without cell lines (P = 0.15). Multivariate analysis in both groups showed cell-line establishment to be a significant indicator of prognosis (P less than 0.0001 for curable group; P less than 0.01 for palliative group). CONCLUSION: In-vitro tumor growth is related to decreased patient survival, which in turn reflects the biologic aggressiveness of cancers giving rise to these tumor cell lines.\r"

  ".W": "The general internist has an important role in the management of head and neck squamous cell cancers. This heterogeneous group of cancers must be accurately diagnosed and staged before planning treatment. Curability is directly related to stage at presentation and, because most patients with such cancers present to internists first, these physicians must be familiar with presenting symptoms and must be suspicious enough to refer patients with symptoms for appropriate evaluation. The work-up of patients with suspected unknown primary cancer presenting as adenopathy is detailed, and the physician is cautioned not to immediately proceed to open biopsy. As many as 10% of such primary cancers remain undetected, although, with proper therapy, the 5-year survival rate for squamous cell cancer of the head and neck is 60%. Those patients cured of head and neck cancer still face significant psychosocial and medical problems, including hypothyroidism, xerostomia, and a 20% rate of second primary cancer. Head and neck cancer is highly preventable; 75% of cases are related to tobacco and alcohol use. Smokeless tobacco has gained popularity among young Americans and is associated with an increased incidence of head and neck cancer at several sites. Education is crucial, and internists must seek strategies to stop patients from using tobacco products. Other etiologic factors include industrial carcinogens, Epstein-Barr virus, and diet. Retrospective serologic and dietary recall studies of vitamin A suggest an etiologic role of diet; vitamin A analogs have been tested in preneoplastic lesions. To reduce mortality from head and neck cancers, the general internist must play a central role in prevention and early detection.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: To examine studies of normal colon and colorectal cancer for evidence that the location of the primary tumor proximal or distal to the splenic flexure of the colon may determine distinct genetic categories of this disease. DATA IDENTIFICATION: Studies were identified through a manual search of journals, through MEDLINE, and through review of bibliographies in identified articles. STUDY SELECTION: Approximately 300 articles were examined. About 150 articles were excluded because tumor location was not reported or was reported in a way that did not permit correlation with results or conclusions. DATA EXTRACTION: Articles were selected either because the presentation of data permitted correlation of results with anatomic regions of the colon or because they were relevant to inherited colorectal cancer. RESULTS OF THE ANALYSIS: Differences were noted in biologic properties of proximal and distal segments of normal fetal and adult colonic epithelium and in the epidemiologic, pathologic, cytogenetic, and molecular features of proximal and distal colorectal cancer. Some differences correlated with the features of inherited colorectal cancer (proximal, nonpolyposis or distal, and polyposis forms). CONCLUSIONS: Developmental and biologic differences in proximal and distal colon may reflect differing susceptibilities to neoplastic transformation. Differences in proximal and distal colorectal cancer suggest that each may arise through different pathogenetic mechanisms. Proximal tumors appear to represent a genetically more stable form of the disease and may arise through the same mechanisms that underlie inherited nonpolyposis colon cancer. Distal tumors show evidence of greater genetic instability and may develop through the same mechanisms that underlie polyposis-associated colorectal cancer syndromes.\r"

I propose adding a structure to make physician behavior more ethical. The structure's design would be complex, but its core would be reminiscent of how a patron tips waiters. My proposal would apply the truism that society's reward systems should foster rather than undermine social goals. This idea draws on features of medicine's social background and on a theory of behavior. It challenges the taboo against the physician's financial interests being clearly present in the doctor-patient relationship and it challenges the overly pure characterization of medical ethical dilemmas that currently dominates. Detailed sketches of necessary mechanisms, such as anonymous forms for patients to complete, are offered, and connections to the insights of George Bernard Shaw are made.\r"

In this issue of Annals, Erde suggests that physicians' incomes should depend on patients' assessments of their ethical behavior in much the same way that waiters' incomes depend on patrons' tips. Although Erde's solution is satiric, the problem is a serious one. The experiences and perspectives of patients regarding their own illness are undervalued by physicians. A truly patient-centered care demands that physicians elicit, understand, and respond to patients' perspectives. Tying physicians' pay to measurements of patient satisfaction is unlikely to dramatically improve the ethical quality of patient care as long as attention to the patient's perspective is seen as peripheral to \"good medical care.\" Rather than relying on a single, easy \"fix,\" we must re-examine all of professional development and practice. We need to choose persons for medical careers who will find patient-centered care rewarding; we need to provide such persons with training and socialization that underscores the value of personalized medicine; and we need to build institutions and systems that facilitate and reinforce patient-centered practice. The best ways to achieve these objectives are as yet unclear, but if we, as physicians, are offended by Erde's \"modest proposal,\" then we must respond by proposing and implementing our own ideas about how patient care can become more humane.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clinical and epidemiologic relations between recreational drug abuse and stroke in young persons. DESIGN: A case-control study based on medical records. SETTING: San Francisco General Hospital, a 400-bed municipal hospital. PATIENTS: Consecutive sample of 214 patients aged 15 to 44 years, admitted between 1979 and 1988 with a diagnosis of ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke. An equal number of control patients admitted with diagnoses of status asthmaticus, acute appendicitis, or acute cholecystitis were matched to stroke patients by age, sex, and year of hospitalization. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Seventy-three patients with stroke (34%) were drug abusers compared with 18 (8%) of the controls. In 47 patients with stroke, temporal proximity of drug administration (n = 34) or infectious endocarditis (n = 13) suggested a direct association between drug abuse and stroke. After controlling for other identifiable stroke risk factors, the estimated relative risk for stroke among drug abusers compared with that among non-drug abusers was 6.5 (95% CI, 3.1 to 13.6), and this increased to 49.4 (CI, 6.4 to 379.0) for those patients whose symptoms began within 6 hours of drug administration. Among patients less than 35 years of age, drug abuse was the most commonly identified potential predisposing condition (47%), and it was the only condition with a significantly elevated relative risk for stroke (11.7; CI, 3.2 to 42.5). Further, a substantial rise in the proportion of drug-related strokes was observed in the last 3 years of the study (31% in 1986 to 1988, compared with 15% in 1979 to 1985, P = 0.008). Cocaine, especially recently, was the drug used most frequently in drug-related strokes. CONCLUSION: In an urban population such as ours, recreational drug abuse appears to be a prominent and growing risk factor for strokes in young adults.\r"

DESIGN: A consecutive sample of women seen in a university-based gastroenterology practice over a 2-month period was asked to complete a brief questionnaire. MEASUREMENTS: The self-administered questionnaire requested information about demographics, symptoms, health care utilization, and history of abuse. Physicians indicated the primary diagnosis for each patient and whether she had ever discussed having been sexually or physically abused. RESULTS: Of 206 patients, 89 (44%) reported a history of sexual or physical abuse in childhood or later in life; all but 1 of the physically abused patients had been sexually abused. Almost one third of the abused patients had never discussed their experiences with anyone; only 17% had informed their doctors. Patients with functional disorders were more likely than those with organic disease diagnoses to report a history of forced intercourse (odds ratio, 2.08; 95% CI, 1.03 to 4.21) and frequent physical abuse (odds ratio, 11.39; CI, 2.22 to 58.48), chronic or recurrent abdominal pain (odds ratio, 2.06; CI, 1.03 to 4.12), and more lifetime surgeries (2.7 compared with 2.0 surgeries; P less than 0.03). Abused patients were more likely than nonabused patients to report pelvic pain (odds ratio, 4.05; CI, 1.41 to 11.69), multiple somatic symptoms (7.1 compared with 5.8 symptoms; P less than 0.001), and more lifetime surgeries (2.8 compared with 2.0 surgeries; P less than 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: We found that a history of sexual and physical abuse is a frequent, yet hidden, experience in women seen in referral-based gastroenterology practice and is particularly common in those with functional gastrointestinal disorders. A history of abuse, regardless of diagnosis, is associated with greater risk for symptom reporting and lifetime surgeries.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy and side effects of ondansetron with those of high-dose metoclopramide in treating acute and delayed cisplatin-induced nausea and vomiting. DESIGN: Randomized, double-blind, crossover trial. SETTING: Conducted at two university hospitals, a cancer institute, and six community hospitals. PATIENTS: Of 125 patients, 95 were evaluable for the acute phase and 79 for the delayed phase. Major reasons for not being evaluable were no second course (14 patients), protocol violation (5 patients), and change in cisplatin dose (3 patients) for the acute phase, and rescue medication on day 1 (7 patients), protocol violation (3 patients), and inadequate data (4 patients) for the delayed phase. INTERVENTIONS: All patients received cisplatin, 50 to 100 mg/m2 body surface area (median, 75 mg/m2); none had previously received chemotherapy. Thirty minutes before the cisplatin administration, ondansetron was given intravenously over 15 minutes, at a loading dose of 8 mg followed by a continuous infusion of 1 mg/h for 24 hours. Metoclopramide was given at a loading dose of 3 mg/kg body weight, followed by a continuous infusion for 8 hours (4 mg/kg). For the delayed phase (days 2 through 6), the first oral dose was given as soon as the infusion was completed; the oral dose consisted of either metoclopramide, 20 mg three times daily, or ondansetron, 8 mg three times daily for another 5 days. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: In the acute phase, a major or complete response was seen in 72% of the ondansetron-treated and 41% of the metoclopramide-treated patients (P less than 0.001). Nausea was significantly better controlled among the ondansetron-treated patients (P = 0.04). In the delayed phase, no statistically significant difference was seen between ondansetron- and metoclopramide-treated patients. Nausea was significantly better controlled with metoclopramide (P = 0.016). CONCLUSIONS: Ondansetron is significantly more effective than metoclopramide in preventing acute nausea and vomiting. In the delayed phase, the results of both drugs were disappointing, although metoclopramide's effect on delayed nausea was superior. Patients preferred ondansetron.\r"

SETTING: Referral inpatient service of the cardiology division of a university hospital. PATIENTS: Twenty-three patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy and mild to moderately severe congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association functional class II to IV) were divided into two groups: 9 patients with sustained ventricular tachycardias and 14 patients without serious ventricular arrhythmias (control). INTERVENTIONS: Medications for heart failure were withdrawn 12 hours or more before study. Antiarrhythmic therapy was continued throughout the study. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The patients had skeletal muscle biopsies, myocardial biopsies, and blood sampling for the analysis of magnesium concentrations. No statistically significant differences in the mean magnesium concentrations in serum, circulating mononuclear cells, skeletal muscle, and myocardium were found when the 9 patients with ventricular arrhythmias were compared with the 14 control patients without serious ventricular arrhythmias.

DESIGN: Unblinded trial, decreasing dose schedules of gallium nitrate. SETTING: University hospital with primary orthopedic and metabolic bone disease specialty. PATIENTS: Ten patients with advanced Paget disease who had previously received conventional therapy consisting of calcitonin, etidronate, or mithramycin. INTERVENTIONS: Five patients were entered into each of three dose schedules: 2.5 mg/kg body weight per day by continuous intravenous infusion for 7 days; 0.5 mg/kg per day for 14 days by subcutaneous injection; and 0.25 mg/kg per day for 14 days by subcutaneous injection. Several patients were treated with different dose schedules. Patients were followed until relapse. RESULTS: Fifteen courses of treatment were administered to ten patients. Reductions in serum alkaline phosphatase and urinary hydroxyproline excretion were observed after treatment with each dose schedule. After treatment with high, intermediate, and low doses, the median maximum decreases in serum alkaline phosphatase activity were 49%, 39%, and 18%, respectively. The median maximum decreases in urinary hydroxyproline excretion were 50%, 52%, and 16%, respectively. The maximum decrease in urinary hydroxyproline excretion occurred within a median of 2 weeks from the start of treatment, whereas the maximum decrease in serum alkaline phosphatase activity occurred substantially later at a median of 6 weeks. All treatment schedules were well tolerated. Response duration was highly variable (range, 6 to 42 weeks). CONCLUSIONS: Short-term treatment with gallium nitrate can reduce biochemical parameters of disease activity in patients with advanced Paget disease of bone. Larger trials using low-dose intermittent treatment schedules are required to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of this therapy.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: To evaluate evidence that concurrent infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) alters both the natural history of syphilis (by increasing the frequency of early neurosyphilis) and the response to penicillin. DATA IDENTIFICATION: Review of major works on syphilis in the English language and files maintained since 1971, supplemented by a systematic search using Index Medicus and MEDLARS. DATA EXTRACTION: The works mentioned above were critically reviewed for information on early neurosyphilis and, where relevant, HIV infection. RESULTS OF DATA ANALYSIS: The central nervous system is regularly involved in early syphilis. Standard recommended doses of benzathine penicillin provide cerebrospinal fluid levels that are probably at the borderline of efficacy, and cure relies on treatment and an adequate host immune response. Early neurosyphilis, appearing within 2 years of onset of infection with Treponema pallidum, was uncommon in the prepenicillin era and usually occurred after inadequate therapy. This complication was exceedingly rare in the first three decades of penicillin use. In contrast, in the past decade, 40 patients with HIV infection have been reported to have asymptomatic neurosyphilis, or syphilitic meningitis, cranial nerve abnormalities (predominantly in cranial nerves II and VIII), or cerebrovascular accidents, singly or together. In 40% of cases, HIV infection was first diagnosed when neurologic symptoms appeared. Of the 38 patients for whom information was available, 18 had the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), 7 had AIDS-related complex, and 13 had antibody to HIV. Sixteen had previously been treated for syphilis, of whom 5 (31%) had received benzathine penicillin within the previous 6 months. Preliminary data also suggest that skin lesions and VDRL (Venereal Disease Research Laboratory) antibody in HIV-infected patients with secondary syphilis respond more slowly to conventional penicillin therapy. CONCLUSION: Intensive therapy and follow-up observation is indicated for early syphilis in HIV-infected subjects. Novel approaches to treatment deserve systematic evaluation.\r"

Conspicuously absent from the number of foreign nationals, however, have been physicians, scientists, and educators from the Soviet Union. Under the new conditions of perestroika, Soviet medical professionals are seeking ways in which to open up broad collaboration with their American counterparts. Agreements are being sought between national organizations, between academic medical institutions, and for the exchange of individual scholars. Cooperation in the area of medical education is one of the distinctive bridges on the path to mutual understanding that will represent a strong link in the public diplomacy of the two superpowers. We recently had the opportunity to discuss in Moscow some of the issues with the U.S.S.R. Minister of Health and with the Pro-rector for International Programs of the Central Institute for Advanced Medical Studies, as well as with faculty members, young medical scientists, and medical students of the Moscow Medical Institutes. We describe briefly many of the similarities and some of the dissonances between our two health systems and set forth ideas for an exchange program in medical education.\r"

Possible interventions to modify these patterns of daily practice include monitoring and displaying patient pain ratings routinely, making available educational tools to assist optimal drug ordering, encouraging patients to communicate about unrelieved pain, reviewing quality assurance of pain treatment regimens, increasing behavioral research into analgesic prescribing, and selectively modifying narcotics regulatory practices.\r"

DESIGN: Cohort analytic study of persons with normal glucose tolerance but with a high risk for developing type II diabetes (average follow-up time, 13 years). SETTING: Outpatients had an intravenous glucose tolerance test and were contacted periodically to ascertain diagnoses of diabetes. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred and fifty-five normal offspring, ranging in age from 16 to 60 years, of two parents with type II diabetes and 186 normal control subjects in the same age range who had no family history of diabetes. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Two phenotypic characteristics distinguished the offspring of diabetic parents from control subjects. They had slower glucose removal rates (Kg) (P less than 0.01) and higher insulin levels (fasting and during the second phase of insulin response to intravenous glucose; P less than 0.0001) than did control subjects, even after adjustment for differences in obesity. Sixteen percent of the offspring developed type II diabetes. Mean Kg at baseline was 1.7%/min among offspring who subsequently developed diabetes, 2.2%/min among offspring who remained nondiabetic, and 2.3%/min among control subjects. Corresponding means for first-phase insulin were 498, 354, and 373 pM, respectively, whereas second-phase insulin means were 329, 117, and 87 pM, respectively. In multivariate analysis, low Kg and high serum insulin levels independently increased the risk for developing diabetes among the offspring of diabetic parents. CONCLUSIONS: One to two decades before type II diabetes is diagnosed, reduced glucose clearance is already present. This reduced clearance is accompanied by compensatory hyperinsulinemia, not hypoinsulinemia, suggesting that the primary defect is in peripheral tissue response to insulin and glucose, not in the pancreatic beta cell.\r"

DESIGN: Cohort study with a mean follow-up of 10.1 years. SETTING: A health maintenance organization. PATIENTS: The cohort included 2746 white men 60 to 79 years of age who had no self-reported history of coronary heart disease. MEASUREMENT AND MAIN RESULTS: A total of 260 deaths occurred during 27,842 person-years of follow-up. The relative risk for mortality from coronary heart disease in men 60 to 79 years of age in the highest serum cholesterol quartile was 1.5 (95% CI, 1.2 to 2.0) compared with those in the three lower quartiles combined. The relative risk did not change greatly with age, ranging from 1.4 in men 60 to 64 years of age to 1.7 in men 75 to 79 years of age. However, because mortality from coronary heart disease increased with age, the excess risk for such mortality attributable to elevated serum cholesterol levels increased fivefold over these 20 years, from 2.2 deaths per 1000 person-years to 11.3 deaths per 1000 person-years. CONCLUSIONS: Our results support those of other observational studies in elderly men. If treatment of high blood cholesterol is as effective in reducing cholesterol-related risk for coronary heart disease after 65 years of age as it is in middle-aged men, it might actually produce greater reductions in mortality due to coronary heart disease. A clinical trial is needed to confirm this extrapolation.\r"

SETTING: Referral-based endocrinology clinic. PATIENTS: Seven patients with active acromegaly, three of whom had refractory congestive heart failure. The other four patients were free of symptoms associated with heart failure. INTERVENTIONS: All patients were treated with octreotide, 100 to 500 micrograms subcutaneously three times daily. The three patients with heart failure continued to receive cardiovascular therapy (angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, digitalis, diuretics). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: During octreotide therapy, patients showed a rapid decrease in growth hormone and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1): Mean levels (+/- SD) fell from 28.1 +/- 32.7 micrograms/L to 5.2 +/- 8.3 micrograms/L and 740 +/- 126 micrograms/L to 372 +/- 64 micrograms/L, respectively (P less than 0.025). Plasma volume returned to normal and heart rate decreased significantly. In the four patients without heart failure, right-heart catheterization done before and after 3 months of octreotide therapy showed an 18.3% +/- 11% reduction in stroke volume and a return to normal of the cardiac index. The three patients with congestive heart failure, evaluated before and after 40 days and up to 2 years of therapy, showed a dramatic clinical improvement that was associated with an increase in stroke volume (by 24% to 51%). In these patients, the cardiac index remained in the normal range, filling pressures were markedly decreased, and pulmonary wedge pressure returned to normal. This improvement was sustained for up to 3 years in the two patients with heart failure who were receiving long-term treatment. CONCLUSION: The rapid and sustained cardiac improvement seen in our patients shows that octreotide therapy for patients with acromegaly may be highly beneficial, even in those patients with advanced cardiac failure.\r"

DESIGN: Open trial with 12-month follow-up. SETTING: Inpatient unit of a regional referral hospital in a developing country. PATIENTS: Twenty-nine consecutive eligible patients with culture-confirmed infection of the mucosa with Leishmania species who were otherwise healthy. Eight patients (28%) had mild to moderate disease (confined to the nasal mucosa). Twenty-one patients (72%) had severe disease (including the oropharynx as well as the nasal mucosa). INTERVENTION: Antimony, 20 mg/kg body weight intravenously every day for 28 days. Patients received antimony in the form of sodium stibogluconate. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Initial results of therapy were as follows: 63 of 72 lesions (88%) healed or markedly improved; all lesions were culture-negative for parasites; and 18 of 29 patients (62%) showed complete clinical and parasitologic cure of all lesions. By the 12-month follow-up examinations, however, 37 lesions had recurred, 8 new lesions had appeared, and only 8 patients (30%) showed clinical cure of all lesions. Of the 8 patients with mild to moderate disease, 6 were cured compared with only 2 of the 21 patients with severe disease. Side effects of this treatment regimen included T-wave inversion on electrocardiogram (4 patients), abnormal liver function tests (10 patients), and musculoskeletal pain (24 patients). No side effects occurred during week 1 of therapy. CONCLUSIONS: The only recommended treatment for mucosal leishmaniasis is ineffective in patients with severe disease. The acceptable toxicity of the regimen suggests that longer courses of therapy with antimony, or that trials with other antileishmanial agents alone or combined with antimony be evaluated as initial therapy for this disease.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE: To develop and validate a new standardized confusion assessment method (CAM) that enables nonpsychiatric clinicians to detect delirium quickly in high-risk settings. DESIGN: Prospective validation study. SETTING: Conducted in general medicine wards and in an outpatient geriatric assessment center at Yale University (site 1) and in general medicine wards at the University of Chicago (site 2). PATIENTS: The study included 56 subjects, ranging in age from 65 to 98 years. At site 1, 10 patients with and 20 without delirium participated; at site 2, 16 patients with and 10 without delirium participated. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: An expert panel developed the CAM through a consensus building process. The CAM instrument, which can be completed in less than 5 minutes, consists of nine operationalized criteria from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-III-R). An a priori hypothesis was established for the diagnostic value of four criteria: acute onset and fluctuating course, inattention, disorganized thinking, and altered level of consciousness. The CAM algorithm for diagnosis of delirium required the presence of both the first and the second criteria and of either the third or the fourth criterion. At both sites, the diagnoses made by the CAM were concurrently validated against the diagnoses made by psychiatrists. At sites 1 and 2 values for sensitivity were 100% and 94%, respectively; values for specificity were 95% and 90%; values for positive predictive accuracy were 91% and 94%; and values for negative predictive accuracy were 100% and 90%. The CAM algorithm had the highest predictive accuracy for all possible combinations of the nine features of delirium. The CAM was shown to have convergent agreement with four other mental status tests, including the Mini-Mental State Examination. The interobserver reliability of the CAM was high (kappa = 0.81 - 1.0). CONCLUSIONS: The CAM is sensitive, specific, reliable, and easy to use for identification of delirium.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: To critically review the current recommendations regarding the eligibility of patients with myocardial infarction for thrombolytic therapy. DATA IDENTIFICATION: Relevant studies published from January 1980 to January 1990 were identified through a computerized search of the English-language literature using MEDLINE and by a manual search of the bibliographies of all identified articles. STUDY SELECTION: All randomized, controlled trials of intravenous thrombolysis in acute myocardial infarction and unstable angina were reviewed. Smaller, observational studies and previous review articles were included when relevant to the discussion. DATA EXTRACTION: Key data were extracted from each article, including the proportions of patients eligible for thrombolysis, the reasons for exclusion from thrombolytic therapy, and the clinical outcomes of patients treated and of those excluded from treatment. The validity of certain exclusion criteria was examined using subgroup analysis from the large, randomized mortality trials of intravenous thrombolysis and observations from smaller, nonrandomized studies. RESULTS OF DATA SYNTHESIS: To date, relatively few patients with myocardial infarction have been considered eligible for fibrinolytic therapy. In this group, both early and late mortality have been significantly reduced. Patients excluded from thrombolysis, however, continue to have a high early mortality. The data suggest that the potential benefits of this treatment might be extended to selected high-risk subgroups. In particular, the risk-benefit ratio may favor the inclusion of otherwise healthy elderly patients; certain patients presenting more than 6 hours after the onset of symptoms; and patients with a history of controlled systolic hypertension or brief, nontraumatic cardiopulmonary resuscitation. The data do not support the use of fibrinolytic therapy as primary treatment in patients with unstable angina or suspected myocardial infarction in the absence of confirmatory electrocardiographic changes. CONCLUSIONS: The full potential of thrombolytic therapy to alter the natural history of acute myocardial infarction can only be realized through the continued evaluation of selection criteria and the identification and treatment of the greatest possible number of eligible patients.\r"

  ".U": "91052815\r", 
  ".W": "PURPOSE: To determine the effect of intravenous streptokinase on early mortality in patients with suspected acute anterior and acute inferior myocardial infarctions. DATA IDENTIFICATION: A literature search of English-language studies on the use of intravenous streptokinase in the treatment of suspected acute myocardial infarction for the period 1966 to 1989 using Medlars II and the bibliographies of relevant articles. In a number of instances, additional details on early mortality by location of myocardial infarction were provided by the authors. STUDY SELECTION: Of 140 originally identified articles, 6 that specifically met our inclusion criteria were selected: randomized trials that used intravenous streptokinase in a dose of 1.5 million units, with or without additional agents, compared with a group that differed only by the absence of streptokinase. Trials were selected by review of the methods section without regard for the results. DATA EXTRACTION: Data were extracted independently by two observers using specific methodologic criteria for infarct location and early mortality. After they conferred, the observers agreed completely on the data. RESULTS OF DATA SYNTHESIS: Among the 9155 patients with suspected acute anterior myocardial infarction, the mortality rate in the control group was 17.4%. In contrast, patients treated with streptokinase had a 12.5% mortality. The mean risk difference was -4.8% (95% CI, -7.5% to -2.1%) and the summary risk ratio was 0.72 (CI, 0.65 to 0.79). A total of 9650 patients with suspected inferior infarction had a mortality rate in the control group of 7.6% [corrected]. The mortality for streptokinase-treated patients was 6.6%. The mean risk difference was -0.8% (CI, -1.8% to 0.2%) and the summary risk ratio was 0.87 (CI, 0.76 to 1.01). CONCLUSIONS: Intravenous streptokinase clearly confers a protective effect against early mortality in patients with suspected acute anterior myocardial infarction. The magnitude of this effect is on the order of a 5% absolute reduction in risk of death by 21 to 35 days. For these patients, 21 need to be treated to save 1 additional life. For patients with suspected acute inferior infarction, the benefit of treatment on reducing early mortality is of smaller magnitude and less certain. These patients have an estimated absolute reduction of early mortality of approximately 1%, which would require treating 125 patients to save 1 additional life.\r"

DESIGN: Retrospective cohort analysis of computerized laboratory data (complete blood count, sodium, potassium, and creatinine levels, prothrombin time, and partial thromboplastin time). SETTING: Urban tertiary care Veterans Affairs Hospital. PATIENTS: Consecutive sample of 1109 patients who had elective surgery in 1988. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: At admission, 7549 preoperative tests were done, 47% of which duplicated tests performed in the previous year. Of 3096 previous results that were normal as defined by hospital reference range and done closest to the time of but before admission (median interval, 2 months), 13 (0.4%; 95% CI, 0.2% to 0.7%), repeat values were outside a range considered acceptable for surgery. Most of the abnormalities were predictable from the patient's history, and most were not noted in the medical record. Of 461 previous tests that were abnormal, 78 (17%; CI, 13% to 20%) repeat values at admission were outside a range considered acceptable for surgery (P less than 0.001, frequency of clinically important abnormalities of patients with normal previous results with those with abnormal previous results). CONCLUSIONS: Physicians evaluating patients preoperatively could safely substitute the previous test results analyzed in this study for preoperative screening tests if the previous tests are normal and no obvious indication for retesting is present.\r"

DESIGN: A critical review of previously published estimates of the need and supply of physicians with clinical training in occupational and environmental medicine with the application of currently available data to produce revised estimates. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Need estimates reviewed from the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, the Graduate Medical Education National Advisory Committee (GMENAC), and the Bureau of Health Professions. Supply figures reviewed from GMENAC, the American Medical Association, the American College of Occupational Medicine, and the American Board of Preventive Medicine. Revised need figures are based on the estimated number of occupational and environmental physicians needed to provide adequate nationwide coverage as full-time academic faculty, community-based specialists, and public health physicians in state and local agencies. Revised supply estimates are based on review of available data. Need is estimated at 4600 to 6700 physicians (board-certified or eligible or with special competence in occupational and environmental medicine). Supply is estimated at 1200 to 1500. CONCLUSIONS: This review identified a deficit of 3100 to 5500 physicians in this newly evolving specialty. In order to address this shortfall in the next decade, graduate specialty training would need to be increased to about 3 to 5 times the current maximum capacity.\r"

They are similar in that both have early and late phases of otologic symptoms and that the early phase is a profound hearing loss in one ear. The late phases differ, however, in that the ipsilateral type develops the symptoms of EH (episodic vertigo) in the deaf ear and the contralateral type develops the symptoms of EH (fluctuating hearing loss and/or episodic vertigo) in the hearing ear. In more than half the cases of both types of delayed EH, the profound hearing losses in the early phase are simply discovered to be present in early childhood without a known time of onset. The temporal bones of two patients with contralateral delayed EH show pathologic changes in the deaf ears that are similar to those known to occur in mumps and measles labyrinthitis, whereas the pathologic changes in the hearing ears are similar to those known to occur in Meniere's disease. These observations support the proposition that Meniere's disease may occur as a delayed sequela of inner ear damage sustained during an attack of subclinical viral labyrinthitis occurring in childhood.\r"

A large AG responsible for CSF otorrhea in a 64-year-old man was excised with soft tissue repair of the dural defect. Sixteen of 188 TBs (8.5%) in the collection contained 24 AGs ranging in size from 0.07 to 80.65 mm3. Nine AGs (37%) were small (less than 1 mm3) and did not demonstrate enlargement. Twelve (50%) were of intermediate size (2.50 to 9.32 mm3), and three (13%) were large (49.82 to 80.65 mm3). The intermediate and large AGs were associated with bone erosion and a high incidence of communication with a pneumatized mastoid complex (serous otitis media or meningitis). These findings suggest that AGs of sufficient size to produce bone erosion are the primary responsible lesions in adult-onset spontaneous CSF otorrhea.\r"

The membrane surface density of the ampullar dark cells was similar to that reported for principal cells of the cortical collecting duct in the kidney. The volume density of the intercellular spaces of the dark cells was very constant, unlike that reported for epithelia involved in isotonic fluid transport. Vacuoles were found to comprise only a small portion of protoplasm in the dark cells. This new morphometry provides a basis on which to examine the response of ampullar dark cells to differing experimental conditions.\r"

Vertical eye movements, being correlated with pitching head movements, were scarcely modified by gaze at 2 and 3 Hz. Acquired bilateral lesions presented deteriorated head stability and physically induced eye movements under stronger stimulations. However, significant increase of head movement upon stepping and suppression of pitching motion upon running, both characteristically found in bilateral lesions, were not reproduced by passive oscillations. Thus, these features during active locomotion may result from imbalance produced by alternate bipedal motions and from adaptation to minimize oscillopsia, respectively.\r"

This study includes 30 full-term infants and 30 premature infants, 16 of whom were very low birth weight preterm infants (less than or equal to 32 weeks' gestation and less than 1,500 g birth weight). Overall complication rates were 3% intraoperative, 13% early postoperative, and 38% late postoperative. The early postoperative complication rate in preterm infants was nearly double that of full-term infants. The late postoperative complication rate of patients undergoing tracheotomy for airway obstruction was more than double that of patients requiring tracheotomy for pulmonary indications. Duration of tracheotomy, however, was felt to be the most important factor in the development of a late postoperative complication.\r"

The architecture utilizes modern advances in desktop microcomputers and has been designed so that vocal motor control laboratories (or similar settings) with modest funding can more fully participate in comprehensive investigations of speech production. Research experiments organized with this architecture may involve many more subjects and measures than previously possible without significant increases in time and personnel resources. This paper will demonstrate the technique and practicality of this architecture as it is being used to successfully guide research to map hierarchic central nervous system regions of involvement in two speech disorders: spasmodic dysphonia and stuttering. The architecture has broad usefulness to many areas of otolaryngology and health science.\r"

Improved functional preservation of the facial nerve has been achieved in acoustic neuroma surgery through the monitoring of evoked facial electromyographic activity. This technique may also be used during otologic procedures in which facial nerve manipulation is anticipated in the management of recurrent cholesteatoma, temporal bone trauma, congenital deformity, or purposeful access for cochlear implantation. Potential indications for using facial nerve monitoring in contemporary otologic surgery are detailed through illustrative case presentations, and necessary instrumentation and techniques are briefly reviewed. Intraoperative monitoring can assist the surgeon in isolating the facial nerve when chronic inflammation, traumatic injury, or anomalous development has resulted in distortion or absence of microanatomic landmarks.\r"

On the basis of these trials, endoscopy of the inferior segment of the cochlea during cochlear implantation seemed feasible. In the present study, the same endoscope was used on eight subjects undergoing cochlear implantation, six of whom had partially obstructed cochleas. Endoscopy was found to be helpful in visualizing obstructed segments, determining patency after the obstruction was removed, and identifying normal structures of the cochlea.

The amount of streptomycin administered (5 to 50 g) was determined by clinical symptoms and by serial testing of the reduction in the slow-phase velocity on electronystagmography. Episodic vertigo was totally relieved in 12 patients and improved in severity and frequency in an additional 4 patients. Permanent posttreatment dysequilibrium occurred in 47% of the patients treated. The changes in hearing (speech reception threshold) were independent of the therapeutic effect of streptomycin on the vestibular system. The overall results suggest that the intramuscular titration of streptomycin should continue to be considered as one of the therapeutic options in patients with disabling vertigo due to bilateral MD.\r"

During this period, 32 subjects died, and permission for autopsy was granted in 18 of the patients, including 3 of 4 who had clinical evidence of stroke. The prevalence of cerebrovascular pathological features in our consecutive autopsy series was higher than the clinical incidence. At autopsy cerebrovascular disease was documented in 6 (24%) of 25 children with HIV infection, including all 3 children who had clinical evidence of stroke. Four patients had intracerebral hemorrhages, 6 patients had nonhemorrhagic infarcts, and 3 had both. Hemorrhage was catastrophic in 1 child and clinically silent in 3 children, all of whom had immune thrombocytopenia. One child had an arteriopathy that affected meningocerebral arteries. In another child, the arteries of the circle of Willis were aneurysmally dilated. Two children had coexisting cardiomyopathy and subacute necrotizing encephalomyelopathy with vascular proliferation. These results suggest that stroke should be considered when children with HIV infection develop focal neurological signs.\r"

Hyperplastic MG thymus cells gave significantly higher and more consistent responses to AChR than parallel cultures of autologous blood cells, whereas responses to PPD showed an opposite trend. Thus there was a preferential localization of AChR-reactive T cells in the hyperplastic MG thymus. Furthermore, there was a strong correlation between blood and thymus cell responses to PPD (but not to AChR), arguing that the hyperplastic MG thymus contains a sample of sensitized peripheral T cells. By contrast, both AChR- and PPD-responsive T cells were almost undetectable in thymus from nonmyasthenic patients, which is evidently much less receptive to circulating T cells. Cells from MG thymomas showed the highest stimulations by AChR but did not consistently react to PPD. However, the uninvolved thymus adjacent to these thymomas behaved almost identically to the hyperplastic samples described above. Our interpretation is that AChR-specific T cells are initially sensitized in the MG thymoma but are selectively trapped in the hyperplastic thymus after being primed elsewhere.\r"

Auras and subclinical seizures usually were identical in EEG appearance, but were distributed differently among patients. The subclinical seizures and auras usually had the same origin as complex partial seizures, but did not always reliably indicate complex partial seizure origin. Subclinical seizures and auras were of favorable prognostic significance for patients undergoing temporal lobectomy. A majority (greater than 80%) of individuals with subclinical seizures and auras were free of complex partial seizures after surgery, whereas a minority (29%) of patients without subclinical seizures and auras became free of complex partial seizures.\r"

The amplitude and time course of the miniature end-plate potentials as well as the resting potential of the muscle fibers were not altered, which implies integrity of the postjunctional membrane. The increase in frequency of miniature end-plate potential reflects an increase of basal acetylcholine release and documents dysfunction of the presynaptic terminal of the neuromuscular junction. The increased frequency was associated with high levels of antimotoneuronal IgG in the blood and the presence of IgG at motor end-plates. These data suggest that the presynaptic terminal of the neuromuscular junction may be involved in the immune attack in animal models of motoneuron degeneration.\r"

  ".W": "The rat optic nerve, a typical central nervous system white matter tract, rapidly loses excitability when it is exposed to anoxia and is irreversibly damaged by prolonged anoxia. Neonatal optic nerve is extremely resistant to anoxia-induced dysfunction and injury; the adult pattern of response to anoxia appears between 10 and 20 days postnatal, that is, during the period of oligodendroglial proliferation and myelination. To test the hypothesis that myelination, or associated events, confer anoxic susceptibility on developing white matter, we analyzed the effects of anoxia on the myelin-deficient (md) strain of rat. Acutely isolated optic nerves from 19- to 21-day-old md rats and control optic nerves from unaffected male littermates were maintained in vitro at 37 degrees C, and exposed to a standard 60-minute period of anoxia. The supramaximal compound action potential was recorded and amplitude of the compound action potential, expressed as % of amplitude before anoxic exposure, was determined. The compound action potential was nearly abolished within 3 to 6 minutes after onset of anoxia in control optic nerves, while optic nerves from md rats displayed a slower decrease in compound action potential amplitude during anoxia, with a distinct action potential present even after 60 minutes of anoxia. Optic nerves from md rats showed significantly greater recovery of compound action potential (71 +/- 25%) than did control optic nerves (33 +/- 21%; p less than 0.02) after 60 minutes of anoxia. These findings support the hypothesis that myelination, or changes associated with it, may be important in the development of anoxic susceptibility in central white matter.\r"

We report here that microinjections of therapeutically relevant muscle relaxants into the midbrain tegmentum of genetically spastic rats decrease muscle tone. The substantia nigra is the region from which midazolam, baclofen, and tizanidine (drugs used clinically in the treatment of spasticity), or gamma-vinyl-GABA, (-)-2-amino-7-phosphonoheptanoate, and [D-pro2-D-phe7-D-trp9]-substance P (experimental drugs active in animal models of spasticity), reduce muscle tone in genetically spastic rats and Hoffmann reflexes in normal rats. The effects of muscle relaxant drugs are topographically restricted to the substantia nigra pars reticulata and are receptor specific. These observations disclose a previously unknown function of the substantia nigra in mediating muscle relaxation.\r"

Autopsy examination in 3 revealed widespread endoneurial fibrosis and demyelination in the peripheral nervous system, possibly secondary to axonal atrophy, and poorly defined changes in cerebral white matter (leukoencephalopathy). The cranial nerves and spinal roots were less severely involved and the neurons in the brainstem and spinal cord were intact. The fatal gastrointestinal dysmotility was due to a severe visceral neuropathy. We suggest that these patients manifested a hereditary disorder with distinctive clinical, radiological, and neuropathological features, and propose the acronym POLIP to emphasize the distinctive tetrad of polyneuropathy, ophthalmoplegia, leukoencephalopathy, and intestinal pseudo-obstruction.\r"

New MHC expression was concentrated in phagocytes, particularly in degenerating white matter in which they were dispersed in the tissue and also packed around blood vessels. MHC antigen was not revealed in motor neurons or skeletal muscle fibers. An anti-pan-T-cell monoclonal revealed small numbers of T cells in degenerating white matter. Similar changes have been seen in other neurodegenerative disorders. They suggest a potential for (secondary) cell-mediated activity in the affected areas rather than an ongoing MHC-restricted T-cell response. Vessel-associated phagocytes may be a source of antigen to peripheral lymphoid tissue, stimulating production of the autoantibodies that have been described.\r"

Our purpose was to investigate the hypothesis that periventricular hyperintensity (PVH) reflects ischemia. Periventricular hyperintensity was evaluated with a method we devised, and cerebral circulation and oxygen metabolism were evaluated with the oxygen-15 steady-state technique. We concluded that the brain with severe periventricular hyperintensity had abnormal circulation, although oxygen metabolism was not measurably affected. The role of a compensation mechanism under conditions of decreased oxygen supply was considered.\r"

Each described a sensation of being pushed, thrown, or knocked to the ground or a sudden illusion of movement of the environment that led to a fall. These episodes were not accompanied by symptoms of their typical attacks of Meniere's syndrome. The drop attacks occurred early and late in the course of the disease; they were the initial manifestation in 1 patient. In the majority the episodes spontaneously remitted, although Meniere's syndrome continued to progress. These attacks probably result from a sudden mechanical deformation of the otolithic membrane of the utricle or saccule due to pressure gradients within the inner ear. They are important to recognize because their prognosis is relatively benign compared to other causes of drop attacks.\r"

These patients frequently undergo electroencephalographic (EEG) examination to evaluate episodes of loss of consciousness, which may be associated with convulsions. Electrocardiogram recording as a part of the EEG is a simple and common practice, but analysis for possible QT prolongation is not routinely performed by electroencephalographers. This is, in part, due to the fact that while calculation of the corrected QT interval is straight forward, a calculator is generally required. A nomogram that is presented simplifies determination of the corrected QT interval, facilitating diagnosis of prolongation of the QT interval in the EEG laboratory.\r"

No case of nonfebrile seizures and only 2 cases (3%) of subsequent febrile seizures were observed during this period.

Shigella-related convulsions are not associated with an increased incidence of subsequent febrile or nonfebrile convulsions.\r"

If the contaminated multidose vial is used for another patient, an iatrogenic infection may be spread. Laboratory study of this injection technique found that viral plaque-forming units could be transmitted to a multidose vial in this manner. A survey of 100 fellows of the American Academy of Dermatology from the United States found that 24% of the respondents used this potentially unsafe procedure. The potential for iatrogenic spread of the human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis B virus is described. Recommendations to avoid patient infection are made.\r"

We report the cases of two children with documented PLEVA evolving into CTCL over several years. One child had the clinical lesions of PLC but the dermatopathologic findings of PLEVA at age 2 years. At age 12 years, he had skin changes of poikiloderma atrophicans vasculare and dermatopathologic findings consistent with parapsoriasis en plaque. The second child presented at age 7 years with scaling dermatitis and dermatopathologic findings of PLEVA. At age 12 years, the histologic diagnosis was parapsoriasis. Monoclonal antibody studies performed on biopsy specimens from both patients revealed 70% to 100% cells staining with CD5, 80% to 90% staining with CD4, 30% to 50% staining with CD8, and an increase in CD1-staining cells in the papillary dermis, indicating a predominantly helper T-cell infiltrate. We believe that PLC and PLEVA may be part of the spectrum of CTCL. Furthermore, CTCL may be more common in young children than once thought.\r"

  ".W": "Infiltrate in cutaneous T-cell lymphomas (CTCLs) is composed mainly of CD4 helper cells with a phenotype very similar to that of benign cutaneous lymphoid infiltrate. MY7 (CD13) is a monoclonal antibody that is normally expressed on peripheral granulocytes and monocytes but also cross-reacts with an antigen expressed on epidermal basal cells. We studied MY7 expression on basal cells of the epidermis and CD4 cell infiltrate in 34 CTCLs, 11 pseudolymphomas, and 29 other benign cutaneous lesions. An indirect immunofluorescence technique with double labeling and an immunoperoxidase technique were used. We found that in benign inflammatory infiltrate, less than 10% of CD4 cells expressed MY7 antigen associated with normal MY7 monoclonal antibody labeling of basal cells, whereas in CTCLs more than 50% of CD4 tumoral cells in dermis expressed MY7 antigens; however, basal cells were MY7 negative. Thus, it is demonstrated that MY7 monoclonal antibody with its double modulation on epidermis (basal cells) and dermis (CD4 cells) has diagnostic value for differentiating CTCLs with CD4+ MY7+ tumor cells in dermis and MY7-negative basal cells from benign inflammatory lesions with CD4+ MY7- cells in dermis and MY7-positive basal cells. This modulation of MY7 labeling could be related to the secretion of epidermal cytokines.\r"

The study was retrospective and observer blinded. T lymphocytes were quantitated using UCHL-1, a pan-T-cell monoclonal antibody, and plasma cell number was estimated in hematoxylin-eosin-stained sections. Differences in both variables reached statistical significance. There were fewer T cells and the number of plasma cells was significantly higher in specimens from the human immunodeficiency virus-positive individuals in comparison with control specimens. As plasma cells are readily identified on hematoxylin-eosin-stained sections, their presence in skin biopsy specimens from psoriatic leisons should arouse suspicion of human immunodeficiency virus infection. The depletion of helper/inducer T lymphocytes by the human immunodeficiency virus may promote the presence of plasma cells in cutaneous inflammatory infiltrates.\r"

However, C1q was absent, while granular deposits of two factors of the alternative complement activating pathway, properdin and properdin factor B, were present only in the basement membrane zone of lesional skin, but not in normal buccal mucosa. Deposition of alternative complement pathway reactants in the lesion suggests that complement activation by IgA was associated with lesion development. Western blot analysis of the patient's serum on electrophoresed cultured keratinocyte antigens identified two distinct sets of epidermal antigens. While IgG bound antigens of 230, 205, 140, and 90 kd, the patient's IgA antibodies bound a distinct set of antigens, 180 and 130 kd. The potential pathogenic role of IgA in cicatricial pemphigoid is discussed.\r"

IgA positive, so-called DH bodies were identified as amorphous clumps--most probably immunocomplex aggregates--scattered throughout the upper papillary dermis. Dermatitis herpetiformis bodies were seen underneath the basement membrane, sometimes along microfibrillar bundles, as well as adjacent to the papillary collagen fibers and within the surface (microfibrillar) region of elastic tissue. Some DH bodies, however, were not related to any fibrillar components. The collagen and elastic fibers, microfibrillar bundles, anchoring fibrils, and elastic microfibrils themselves were unlabeled. Dermatitis herpetiformis bodies were not found in normal human skin. The results of our ultrastructural study indicate that DH bodies either are bound to a nonfibrillar component of dermal connective tissue or represent deposits of immune complexes trapped in DH skin.\r"

The histopathologic findings disclosed a pronounced accumulation of mast cells in the dermis. Electron microscopic studies of lesional skin obtained in infancy showed round or spindle-shaped mast cells with numerous fingerlike villous protrusions. The cytoplasmic granules varied in size and shape, and the appearance of degranulation was markedly noted. In the adult, most mast cells had markedly decreased numbers of granules and cytoplasmic villi. Some cells displayed degenerative or necrotic appearances. These findings correlated well with the clinical course of these cases, which improved spontaneously over time.\r"

These patients accumulate fatty alcohol in the plasma and cultured fibroblasts. A 19-year-old woman with ichthyosis, mental retardation, and mild spasticity is described in whom fatty alcohol metabolism was normal, as determined by plasma octadecanol level and fibroblast fatty alcohol:NAD+ oxidoreductase activity. Ultrastructural studies on skin from the patient revealed morphologically abnormal epidermal lamellar bodies, not unlike those seen in neutral lipid storage disease with ichthyosis.
