  ".W": "Between September 1981 and May 1986, coronary angioplasty immediately after intracoronary thrombolysis was attempted in 115 patients with acute myocardial infarction. The present study describes our experience with this combined procedure. Primary success was achieved in 102 patients (89%). Before discharge, 79 of these patients agreed to be restudied angiographically. The infarct-related vessel was still patent in 71 patients (patency rate of 90%). Sequential left ventricular angiograms of quality sufficient to allow automated analysis were obtained in 58 patients. Global ejection fraction improved significantly from 52 +/- 10% to 55 +/- 9% (p = 0.01) from the acute to the chronic stage. In patients with anterior infarction, the increase in global ejection fraction was primarily the result of significant improvement of the regional myocardial function of the infarct zone. No significant changes in global and regional myocardial function could be seen in patients with inferior infarction. However, when patients in whom the infarct-related vessel was reoccluded at follow-up angiography are excluded from analysis, the global and regional myocardial function did improve significantly irrespective of the location of the infarct. Median clinical follow-up of 20 months (range 4 to 50) resulted in an overall mortality rate of 4%. Preservation of global and regional left ventricular function with a low mortality rate suggests that immediate coronary angioplasty after thrombolysis can be safely used to provide reperfusion in the setting of acute myocardial infarction and that this combined procedure may be the optimal mode of therapy. Further randomized studies are warranted to precisely define the role of coronary angioplasty in acute myocardial infarction.\r"

  ".W": "To evaluate the protective effect of nifedipine on ischemic myocardium, in addition to thrombolytic therapy, a total of 149 patients with acute myocardial infarction were included in a double-blind controlled study in which they received 20 mg sublingual nifedipine (74 patients in group 1) or placebo (75 patients in group 2) in the emergency ward, either intracoronary nifedipine, 0.2 mg before and 0.2 mg after reperfusion of the infarct-related vessel and 20 mg three times/day during the hospital stay, or placebo. Combined intravenous and intracoronary thrombolytic therapy was initiated by means of mechanical recanalization in nonreperfused vessels. There were no differences between group 1 and 2 with regard to age, sex, body weight, or location of infarct. Evolution of CK-MB release and cumulative CK-MB was higher in group 1 than in group 2. Changes with regard to regional and global left ventricular function and coronary anatomy were not significantly different (NS) between the two groups. Reocclusion occurred in 15 of 74 (20%) and 10 of 75 (13%) patients in groups 1 and 2, respectively. During the reperfusion period, second- and third-degree atrioventricular block occurred in 5.4% and 6.7% (NS), ventricular couplets in 17.6% and 24% (NS), ventricular tachycardia in 2.7% and 9.3%, and ventricular fibrillation in 2.7% and 8% of the patients, respectively. Mortality rates were 13% and 8%. The study demonstrates that even very early administration of nifedipine combined with intracoronary administration does not enhance the salvage of ischemic myocardium achieved by reperfusion.\r"

  ".W": "Existing studies provide conflicting information concerning the natural history of regional dysfunction after subacute myocardial infarction. The purpose of this study was to use quantitative computer-assisted two-dimensional echocardiography to define the natural history of abnormal wall motion in a subacute canine infarct model within individual short-axis echocardiographic planes, and in the entire ventricle as well. Serial short-axis echocardiograms were obtained from 10 closed-chest dogs before occlusion and at 0.5, 6, 24, 48, and 72 hours after ligation of the circumflex (six dogs) or left anterior descending (four dogs) coronary artery. The circumferential extent of abnormal wall motion was quantified by two different computer-assisted methods: the first, a derived correlation method, examined wall motion throughout the systolic contraction sequence; the second method examined the fractional radial change in endocardial ray length from end-diastole to end-systole. The study shows that for individual planes there is a slight but not statistically significant increase in the circumferential extent of abnormal wall motion from 0.5 to 72 hours after coronary artery occlusion; however, when the total extent of left ventricular asynergy was used to define a global functional infarct size, we observed a small (3.6% to 5.4%) but significant increase in the circumferential extent of abnormal wall motion.\r"

  ".U": "88147772\r", 
  ".W": "Morphine, an opiate alkaloid with mixed mu- and delta-agonist properties, raises the ventricular fibrillation threshold in anesthetized dogs by altering autonomic tone. To elucidate further underlying structure-activity relationships, the effect of fentanyl, a nonalkaloid, mu-selective agonist in wide clinical use, was studied. Fentanyl (30 micrograms/kg) was given intravenously to 27 chloralose-anesthetized dogs, and ventricular fibrillation threshold was measured by means of the single-stimulus technique. In the baseline state fentanyl raised the ventricular fibrillation threshold by 14%. When the dogs were subjected to hemorrhagic stress, this effect was amplified to 29% (p less than 0.0001). Bilateral cervical vagotomy abolished fentanyl's antifibrillatory effect, but neither atropine sulfate (0.4 mg/kg/hr) nor atropine methylnitrate (0.5 mg/kg/hr) did so. Fentanyl's influence on the fibrillation threshold during hemorrhage was significantly reduced by bilateral stellate ganglionectomy (p less than 0.005). It is concluded that fentanyl raises the ventricular fibrillation threshold by its known sympathoinhibitory action rather than by its vagal efferent activating effect. The facts that an intact vagus is required and that hemorrhage amplifies the effect suggest that the antifibrillatory effect of fentanyl is mediated through the afferent component of the baroreflex arc.\r"

  ".U": "88147774\r", 
  ".W": "Pulsed Doppler echocardiography was used to study the timing and dynamics of left ventricular filling in 14 patients with permanent dual-chamber programmable pacemakers. Pacemakers were programmed to atrial sensed (VDD) mode and atrial-ventricular sequential paced mode at low (DVI-L) and high (DVI-H) heart rates, and pulsed Doppler recordings of transmitral flow were analyzed at atrioventricular delays of 50 to 300 msec in each mode. There was a significant decrease in the one-third filling fraction in both VDD and DVI-L modes and a significant increase in DVI-H modes with increasing atrioventricular delay. The ratio of early filling area to atrial filling area was significantly lower at longer atrioventricular delays in both VDD and DVI-L modes. The time from pacemaker spike to mitral valve closure was highly significantly correlated with atrioventricular delay in VDD, DVI-L, and DVI-H modes (r = -0.92, p = 0.0001; r = -0.90, p = 0.0001; and r = -0.85, p = 0.0001, respectively) as was the diastolic filling time to a lesser extent (r = -0.73, p = 0.0001; r = -0.69, p = 0.0001; r = -0.61, p = 0.0001, respectively). Events reflecting atrial systole occurred at a later time in the cardiac cycle in the atrial paced vs the atrial sensed mode. Thus changes in atrioventricular delay and pacemaker mode in this group of patients are a strong determinant of the timing and dynamics of left ventricular filling.\r"

  ".W": "Twenty-five infants and children with native coarctation of the aorta had percutaneous balloon angioplasty over a 28-month period ending in May, 1987. The mean systolic pressure gradient across the coarctation decreased from 47.6 +/- 20.9 mm Hg to 10.3 +/- 7.3 mm Hg (p less than 0.001) following angioplasty, and the diameter of the coarcted segment increased from 3.2 +/- 1.7 mm to 7.8 +/- 3.5 mm (p less than 0.001). Clinical and echo-Doppler follow-up indicated excellent results in 16 of the 18 patients in whom 3- to 22-month follow-up was available; two infants required additional treatment (repeat angioplasty in one and surgical resection in the other). Fourteen patients who underwent repeat cardiac catheterization remain improved with regard to pressure gradient across the dilated coarctation (9.5 +/- 9.6 mm Hg, p less than 0.001) and angiographically measured sizes of the coarcted segment (10.3 +/- 3.2 mm, p less than 0.001). No aneurysm was seen in any child. We recommend balloon angioplasty as the therapeutic procedure of choice for relief of severe, previously unoperated coarctation of the aorta in neonates and young infants. Routine use of balloon angioplasty for unoperated coarctation of the aorta in children appears indicated, but should await longer follow-up results and reports of follow-up on a larger number of patients; this caution is mainly based on reports from other workers of aneurysm formation at the site of balloon dilatation.\r"

All 61 patients taking rilmenidine completed the study; 8 of the 65 patients taking placebo were withdrawn because of an increase in BP. Rilmenidine significantly reduced mean systolic and diastolic BP compared with placebo in both studies. BP was normalized (systolic less than 160 mm Hg and diastolic less than or equal to 90 mm Hg in 61% of the patients taking rilmenidine as opposed to 23% of those taking placebo (p less than 0.001). There was no significant difference in the incidence of either dry mouth or daytime drowsiness between rilmenidine, 1 mg/day, and placebo. Dry mouth was significantly more frequent with rilmenidine, 2 mg/day, than with placebo, but this difference was transient and no longer significant at the end of the study. No unexpected adverse effects occurred. Rilmenidine as single therapy appears to be effective and well accepted in the management of mild to moderate hypertension, in particular at the 1-mg/day dose, which normalized 84% of mild hypertensive patients and did not induce any significant adverse effects compared with placebo.\r"

Exercise tests were performed 1.5, 6, 12, 24 and 36 months after AMI. Maximal accomplished workloads were similar in the 2 groups throughout follow-up. Maximal heart rate was significantly higher in the placebo-treated group throughout the study (p less than 0.001). At the 6-week test more patients in the placebo group terminated exercise due to angina pectoris (40 vs 25%, p less than 0.05) and showed exercise-induced ST-depressions (38 vs 27%, p = 0.05) compared with the metoprolol group. Exercise-induced ventricular arrhythmias were significantly more common in the placebo group during the initial 6 months. Death, another AMI or both were significantly reduced by metoprolol treatment in patients with exercise-induced ST depression greater than or equal to 1 mm at the 6-week test. In a multiple logistic regression analysis maximal accomplished workload at 6 weeks (p less than 0.026), male sex (relative risk [rr] = 3.57, p = 0.016), previous AMI (rr = 3.07, p = 0.001), therapy with placebo (rr = 2.14, p = 0.007) and left ventricular failure (rr = 2.04, p = 0.023) were shown to carry independent prognostic information as well as exercise-induced ST-depression (greater than or equal to 1 mm) in placebo-treated patients (rr = 2.70, p = 0.01).\r"

After 30 minutes of stable pulmonary hypertension, mean (+/- SD) pulmonary artery pressure increased similarly from 16 +/- 4 to 33 +/- 5 mm Hg (hypoxic), and from 14 +/- 2 to 34 +/- 6 mm Hg (septic). All other measured hemodynamic variables were similar. Despite these hemodynamic similarities, there were significant differences in thromboxane B2 levels. After 60 minutes of pulmonary hypertension, thromboxane B2 levels were 760 +/- 253 pg/mL (hypoxic), and 3103 +/- 1083 pg/mL (septic). These data demonstrate that, while thromboxane appears to be crucial in mediating septic pulmonary hypertension in the piglet, it is not associated with hypoxic pulmonary hypertension, implying that different types of pulmonary hypertension are probably mediated by different biochemical agents.\r"

Erythema nodosum, the most common skin lesion, correlates with activity of the bowel disease but not with its duration or extent. Resolution occurs with therapy of inflammatory bowel disease. Pyoderma gangrenosum, the most severe skin lesion, bears little relationship to the activity or extent of the colitis. Therapy is usually supportive, but dapsone and steroids appear promising. Immune and vasculitic mechanisms have been postulated for both skin lesions. Peripheral arthritis usually has its onset with or after the development of colitic symptoms. It worsens with exacerbation of bowel inflammation and responds to treatment of the bowel disease. Immune mechanisms are likely. Spondyloarthropathy usually occurs before the onset of overt intestinal disease. Its course is unrelated to the bowel inflammation, it does not respond to treatment of bowel disease, and it is associated with HLA B27.\r"

Those who are admitted to the hospital with evidence of alcoholic liver disease are uniformly malnourished. The malnourished sick, including those with alcoholic liver disease, do not fare as well with their disease as do the well-nourished sick. The data are compatible with the concept that malnutrition is a complication of alcoholism and interferes with rapid repair of alcoholic liver injury. Only in this important sense does poor protein intake contribute to the hepatic injury of alcohol abuse. Correction of kwashiorkor allows the inherent repair mechanisms to operate in reversing the reversible. Therefore, for the sicker alcoholics who have a reversible component to their liver disease, but who cannot consume adequate diets, enteral or parenteral caloric supplements are indicated. This is, after all, not so different from other diseases. 'Tis better to have one ailment at a time.

Rebleeding rates and success rates of retreatment in the two groups were not significantly different. In the case of a spurter or a bleeder located over the lesser curvature side of the stomach or superior wall of the duodenal bulb, heat probe thermocoagulation was better than pure alcohol injection in achieving hemostasis. We conclude that heat probe thermocoagulation is better than pure alcohol injection in arresting peptic ulcer hemorrhage.

Correction of the anemia eliminates transfusions and their associated risks, improves physical endurance, and results in healthier patients beginning dialysis.

Although some investigations have suggested that transplantation of aging kidneys may cause an increased incidence of primary allograft failure, the effects of donor age on GFR are unknown. In the present study, 201 patients who had allografts that survived for at least 24 months were investigated. The age range of the donors was 7 to 61 years. Multivariate regression analysis demonstrated that both donor and recipient age had significant, independent effects on creatinine clearance at 1 year, and at last follow-up, 5.0 +/- 1.9 years (mean +/- SD) after transplantation. The effect of donor age on renal function could not be attributed to differences in the number of rejection episodes, the frequency or duration of posttransplant acute tubular necrosis, age of the recipient, or other factors. Donor age had no effect on allograft survival, and did not affect the rate of decline in creatinine clearance between 1 year and last follow-up. Thus, these results suggest that donor age is associated with intrarenal alterations that lead to reductions in renal function after transplantation, but donor age may not affect long-term prognosis or allograft survival in the late posttransplant period.\r"

Shortly after transplantation, proteinuria recurred in both patients, progressing to the nephrotic syndrome. Serial renal biopsies were obtained from each patient. These initially demonstrated focal segmental epithelial proliferation (the \"cellular lesion\"), but focal segmental scars were observed in subsequent biopsies. None of the biopsies demonstrated immunoglobulin, complement deposition, or diffuse epithelial cell foot process fusion.

Acute oral potassium-loading was carried out in eight diabetic patients with modestly reduced creatinine clearance (Ccr) and in 11 diabetic patients and 13 controls with normal clearances. Only one diabetic patient manifested an inappropriately low upright plasma aldosterone level (6 ng/dL). The percentage of potassium excreted in 4 hour by both groups of diabetic patients was significantly less than that of the controls (decreased Ccr:21% +/- 6%, normal Ccr:36% +/- 5%, controls:54% +/- 5%; p less than 0.01 and 0.05 respectively). On the other hand, the estimated amount of potassium translocated intracellularly tended to be greater in the diabetic patients (18 +/- 3 mmol; 11 +/- 3 mmol) than controls(7 +/- 2 mmol; p less than 0.005 and 0.1 respectively), and the ratio of the increase in plasma (K) to the amount of potassium retained, was lower in diabetic patients, probably indicating enhanced intracellular potassium translocation. The authors conclude that diabetic patients with normal or only slightly reduced renal function (and no aldosterone deficiency) may have a reduced capacity to excrete an acute potassium load but an enhanced capacity to transfer potassium intracellularly.\r"

These individuals may experience mild symptoms of hypothyroidism. Such symptoms are nonspecific and also can be associated with aging or nonthyroidal illness. SCH is not uncommon in the elderly, particularly in females with positive thyroid antibodies and in those who have undergone partial thyroidectomy or I131 treatment for Graves' disease. Patients with SCH with markedly increased TSH levels or high-titer thyroid antibodies are at higher risk of progressing to overt hypothyroidism. Management options include observation only, with long-term follow up, or substitution with thyroid hormone. Replacement will prevent the development of overt hypothyroidism when reliable follow-up cannot be assured and may improve subtle, nonspecific symptoms of thyroid hormone deficiency. If a decision in favor of replacement therapy has been made, the dose of thyroid hormone should be increased gradually with the objective of returning the TSH level to normal without inappropriately elevating the serum thyroxine concentration. The patient should be carefully observed to see if hypothyroid symptoms, mental status or cardiac function improve with therapy. Continued administration of thyroid hormone would serve prophylactic purposes even if improvement did not occur.\r"

To accomplish this end, some aspects of basic bone cell biology, biochemistry, and pathology are presented, as are speculations about possible causes of this disease. Treatment of Paget's disease will be considered in three sections. The first two sections will review treatment with calcitonin and diphosphonates, respectively. These sections briefly will consider the mechanism of action of the drugs, review in detail clinical studies of drug effectiveness, and summarize the advantages and disadvantages of each drug. The third section details specific treatment recommendations for each of the six clinical settings in which treatment of Paget's disease is justified.\r"

Of these 29, ten had ruptures seen preoperatively. Nineteen had occult ruptures. The preoperative findings predictive of scleral rupture were a visual acuity of light perception or no light perception, an intraocular pressure of less than 10 mm Hg, hyphema, and chemosis. Of the 29 ruptures, 27 involved the superior hemisphere and 25 involved the anterior hemisphere of the globe. Ten of 29 eyes (34%) with scleral rupture and eight of 11 eyes (73%) without rupture achieved a final visual acuity of 5/200 or better over an average follow-up period of 6.7 months. Factors prognostic of ambulatory vision for eyes with ruptured and intact globes included an initial visual acuity of 5/200 or better, absence of scleral rupture, and a rupture length of less than 11 mm in eyes with ruptures. The vitrectomized eyes also had a better result, suggesting that early pars plana vitrectomy is of benefit in selected rupture cases.\r"

Recent research also suggests that PTSD has a unique biological profile consisting of alterations in sympathetic arousal, the neuroendocrine system, and the sleep/dream cycle. This profile distinguishes PTSD from both major depression and panic disorder. Medication appears to alleviate PTSD symptoms associated with sympathetic hyperarousal and intrusive recollections of the trauma but seems ineffective against avoidant symptoms. Pharmacotherapy alone is rarely sufficient to provide complete remission of PTSD. Symptom relief provided by medication facilitates the patient's participation in individual, behavioral, or group psychotherapy.\r"

Using standard sensitivity measures, as well as logistic regression, they concluded that many patients with HPA abnormalities are not identified by the DST. These findings suggest that other neuroendocrine tests, which are sensitive to HPA axis abnormalities, may be helpful in subtyping depression on the basis of HPA axis functioning.\r"

We compared the immediate biomechanical consequences of open versus arthroscopic repair in the human cadaver knee. Additionally, having measured postoperative stresses at various degrees of knee flexion, we have addressed the effect of tethering of the meniscus, a question relevant to both meniscus repair and replacement. Peak stresses were measured by the Pressensor system. Fresh human cadaver knees were subjected to loading in an Instron unit, on an unconstrained base. Instantaneous loads were applied with the knee in 0 degree, 30 degrees, or 60 degrees of flexion, and stress distributions were measured after repair of a 2 cm peripheral tear, by an open or arthroscopic approach. The results of loading experiments on five knees revealed no statistically significant differences between stresses after the two repairs. Similarly, there was no statistically significant difference between the normal and repaired menisci. In our model, this suggests that the immediate biomechanical consequences of open and arthroscopic repair are equivalent and that the \"tethered\" meniscus distributes loads as well as the normal meniscus.\r"

In this series, 16 were treated conservatively with rehabilitation, bracing, and counseling on activity modification. The remaining 24 patients underwent arthroscopic examination and either an extraarticular or intraarticular reconstruction based on growth potential. The average followup was 27 months for the conservative group and 26 months for the surgical group. In the conservative group, six patients underwent arthroscopy for meniscal tears, four medial and two lateral. Only seven patients returned to sports, all experiencing recurrent episodes of giving way, effusions, and pain. In the surgical group, 12 medial and 6 lateral meniscal tears were found at arthroscopy. There were 10 extraarticular reconstructions and 14 intraarticular reconstructions. All 24 returned to sports activity, and 22 of the 24 are still competing. The two remaining patients both suffered reinjury 3 years after their surgery. We recommend arthroscopy and examination under anesthesia for the young patient with ACL tears. Based on the amount of instability, presence or absence of meniscal tears, and athletic desires of the patient and his or her family, a treatment plan can be undertaken.\r"

Kinetic and kinematic data were collected for 14 subjects running heel-toe at an average speed of 4 m/s. The results showed that the four tested viscoelastic insoles did not differ in variables describing the vertical impact forces (vertical force peak, time of occurrence of vertical force peak, maximum vertical loading rate) compared to the conventional insoles furnished in running shoes. Furthermore, the viscoelastic insoles did not influence kinematic variables of the lower extremities in a systematic way.\r"

Nine bypasses failed after cholecystoenterostomy and two after choledochoenterostomy (p less than 0.04). Eight of the 9 failures occurred in the subgroup of 22 patients with malignant biliary obstruction. In this subgroup, five bypasses failed within 90 days of operation, all after cholecystoenterostomy (p = 0.03 compared with choledochoenterostomy).

Despite the continued use of a variety of colloid solutions in resuscitation, there is no good evidence to document a benefit of these solutions over the crystalloid solutions. The additional cost of colloid compared with crystalloid is another argument against colloid use. The most interesting solution currently being assessed is hypertonic saline solution. Its major benefit is that a small volume of fluid can achieve effective resuscitation. The smaller weight gain and lower incidence of peripheral edema may also prove to be significant benefits. Further evaluations are needed to verify the efficacy of this therapy. Finally, a recent National Institute of Health consensus panel identified the appropriate indications for fresh frozen plasma. They concluded that there is no indication for the use of fresh frozen plasma as a volume expander.\r"

The mechanisms by which these agents act and the precise roles they play in normal and abnormal proliferation of intestinal mucosa have not yet been clearly defined. Peptide hormones and growth factors exert their mitogenic effects by first interacting with specific receptors in the cell membrane. Oncogenes induce production of growth factors or replace growth factors and, by themselves, stimulate growth. We believe that no single agent is likely to be responsible; rather, multiple agents are involved in stimulation of growth of normal and neoplastic intestinal epithelial cells. A clear understanding of the factors responsible for regulation of normal and abnormal intestinal cell growth will greatly facilitate the development of therapeutic strategies for the prevention and treatment of gastrointestinal cancers.\r"

Adenosine (217 +/- 32 micrograms.kg-1.min-1) decreased mean arterial pressure 30% from 77 +/- 5 to 54 +/- 3 mm Hg. Cardiac filling pressures and heart rate remained unchanged during hypotension. Adenosine decreased systemic vascular resistance 50 +/- 5% while cardiac index increased 39 +/- 10%. Coronary sinus blood flow increased by 73 +/- 13% from 128 +/- 18 to 224 +/- 36 ml/min with a concomitant decrease in calculated coronary vascular resistance (66 +/- 4%). Both systemic and myocardial arteriovenous oxygen content differences decreased, and myocardial oxygen consumption decreased 42 +/- 9%. There were no alterations in myocardial fractional lactate extraction. Arterial plasma renin activity and arterial catecholamine levels were unaffected by hypotension. It is concluded that adenosine hypotension in this group of patients produced a hyperkinetic circulation in the systemic as well as in the myocardial vascular bed. Cardiac output and coronary sinus blood flow increased at the same time as myocardial oxygen consumption decreased.\r"

The diagnosis of acute valvular decompensation is made by attention to the physical assessment and appropriate use of diagnostic techniques. Recent advances in valvular heart disease have centered around noninvasive diagnostics. Doppler echocardiography can accurately diagnose and quantify stenotic and regurgitant lesions; its use with M-mode and two-dimensional echocardiography makes these the noninvasive diagnostic procedures of choice. Acute decompensation is often related to preexisting critical aortic or mitral stenosis, or more commonly, acute severe regurgitation. Although of different etiologies, acute mitral and aortic regurgitation are associated with similar diagnostic and therapeutic modalities. Emergency treatment consists of vasodilator and, possibly, inotropic therapy. However, definitive therapy generally requires surgical intervention.\r"

Recent research into the physiologic regulation of coagulation and thrombolysis reveals that recurrent venous thrombosis and PE may be caused by heritable deficiencies and abnormalities of plasma proteins. To decide among options for evaluation and treatment of patients suspected of PE, physicians combine clinical assessment with patterns observed on radionuclide ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) scans. However, the prevalence of PE among patients with \"low probability\" V/Q scans suggests that current physician behavior may be imprudent. Heparin anticoagulation continues to be standard therapy for acute PE, but newer clot-specific thrombolytic drugs may offer superior benefits with acceptable complication rates in carefully selected patients.\r"

Chest pain and dyspnea are characteristic complaints. A typical progression of ECG changes occurs during the course of acute pericarditis. These changes occasionally require differentiation from those of acute myocardial infarction or normal variant ST segment elevation. Echocardiography is the most sensitive technique for detecting the presence of pericardial effusion. In addition, a number of echocardiographic findings are characteristic of larger effusions and cardiac tamponade. Any form of pericarditis may lead to the development of cardiac tamponade. Malignant effusion is probably the most common single cause.\r"

To increase the percentage of oxygen delivered (FDO2) from the bag, supplemental oxygen must be provided by way of an oxygen inlet nipple attached to the unit. Using ten medical volunteers and a test lung with oxygen analyzer, we studied the effect of several variables on the FDO2 and determined the most effective reservoir that would provide the highest consistent FDO2 from the ventilating port of the bag. An FDO2 of 1.00 was consistently provided by the 2.5-L bag reservoir and a demand-valve set-up attached to the reservoir port of the ventilating bag. Bag refill time significantly affected the FDO2 when no reservoir or corrugated tube reservoirs were used. Corrugated tube reservoirs were found to be more sensitive to all variations in ventilatory technique and to oxygen flow rates. From our findings we recommend that corrugated tube reservoirs not be used for oxygen supplementation, as they are sensitive to variations in ventilatory technique and cannot alert clinicians to problems with oxygen flow. While both the 2.5-L bag reservoir and demand-valve provide a consistent FDO2 of 1.00, the demand valve has the advantage of audible filling of the ventilating bag as well as being compact and independent of ventilatory technique.\r"

  ".W": "Hyperosmolar environments induce histamine release from mast cells and basophils in vitro. To assess whether the same stimulus induces mediator release in vivo, 15 healthy human volunteers underwent nasal challenges with instilled solutions of differing osmolalities: lactated Ringer's solution (257 +/- 3 mOsm/kg), isosmolar mannitol (277 +/- 6 mOsm/kg), and hyperosmolar mannitol (869 +/- 8 mOsm/kg). The effect of these challenges on the volume, osmolality, and inflammatory mediator content of subsequent 5-ml isosmolar lavages was determined. The volumes of lavages returned after hyperosmolar challenges were significantly greater than those after isosmolar challenges (5.5 +/- 0.2 ml versus 4.2 +/- 0.1 ml; p less than 0.01) and these lavage solutions had higher osmolalities. Even when corrected for increased volumes, the lavages after hyperosmolar challenges contained significantly higher quantities of inflammatory mediators such as histamine (29.0 versus 10.1 ng; p less than 0.01), TAME-esterase activity (32.7 versus 11.1 cpm x 10(-3); p less than 0.01), and immunoreactive leukotrienes (9.9 versus 3.4 ng; p less than 0.01). The changes in mediators were dose dependent in that incremental increase in challenge osmolality were associated with incremental increases in histamine release. Therefore, when exposed to hyperosmolar stimuli in vivo, the nasal respiratory airway releases inflammatory mediators and fluid rapidly shifts into the airway lumen. It has been suggested that the mediator release observed on breathing cold and dry air is due to increased osmolality of airway secretions; the present data confirm that osmotic variations at the airway surface can provide an adequate stimulus for cell activation.\r"

The present study, directed at understanding the mechanism of this reaction, showed that 9 subjects who displayed symptoms and inflammatory mediator release had significant (p less than 0.01) increments in nasal fluid osmolality, whereas the osmolality of the fluids of 6 subjects unaffected by cold, dry air challenge did not differ from baseline. Significant correlations were found between the mediator concentration and the osmolality of recovered nasal lavages (rs = 0.617, p less than 0.02; rs = 0.679, p less than 0.01 for histamine and TAME-esterase(s), respectively). No changes in the osmolality of nasal secretions were found in atopic subjects undergoing nasal challenge with antigen, despite the generation of symptoms and significant elevations in the levels of inflammatory mediators in their nasal lavages. Because increasing the osmolality of the medium surrounding isolated mast cells in vitro triggers mediator secretion, these observations support the concept that the response to cold, dry air nasal inhalation is caused by the release of mediators secondary to an increase in the osmolality of the mucosal secretions.\r"

At doses of 6 to 600 micrograms/kg, the peptide causes significant and dose-dependent increases in resistance (RL) and decreases in dynamic compliance (Cdyn). Inhibition of serum carboxypeptidase N, the enzyme thought to be responsible for control of C3a activity in blood, by pretreating animals with DL-2-mercaptomethyl-3-guanidinoethylthiopropanoic acid (MGPA), resulted in a 4-fold potentiation of the response to 200 micrograms/kg C3a. Responses to lower C3a doses were not significantly affected. Pretreating animals intravenously with histamine prior to administration of C3a resulted in potentiation of C3a-induced bronchoconstriction at all doses tested, decreasing the amount of C3a required to double RL by 15-fold, from 110 to 7 micrograms/kg. The effect appears to be relatively specific for C3a since histamine pretreatment did not alter airway responsiveness to methacholine. Similarly, pretreatment with methacholine at a dose that caused an increase in RL comparable to histamine did not alter subsequent responses to C3a. Administration of capsaicin, under conditions that elicit acute release of endogenous substance P, also resulted in potentiation of C3a responses, to an extent similar to that observed for histamine. These data are consistent with an increase in pulmonary vascular permeability facilitating accessibility of C3a for its receptor to cause bronchoconstriction before it is inactivated by serum carboxypeptidase N. Further, when C3a is generated in the presence of histamine-and/or substance-P-releasing agents, it may be responsible for a greater fraction of altered pulmonary mechanics than has previously been appreciated.\r"

  ".W": "Two hundred twenty-seven workers in a western red cedar sawmill underwent methacholine bronchoprovocation testing at least 2 times during 3 surveys over a 2-yr period. At the first survey, workers completed a respiratory and occupational questionnaire, performed spirometry, gave serum for measurement of plicatic acid-specific IgE antibodies by radioallergosorbent testing, and had skin prick tests to detect atopy. Bronchial hyperresponsiveness was present initially in 18% of the workers. Approximately 15% of those with initially no hyperresponsiveness developed hyperresponsiveness during the follow-up period; 15% of those with initial hyperresponsiveness also lost it during follow-up. Development of hyperresponsiveness tended to coincide with a decrease in level of pulmonary function, whereas loss of hyperresponsiveness was associated with improvement in pulmonary function. Workers with either persistent bronchial hyperresponsiveness or with varying responsiveness had a higher prevalence of plicatic acid IgE antibodies and lower levels of initial pulmonary function than did workers with persistent nonresponsiveness. Workers with persistent hyperresponsiveness had higher initial estimated total airborne dust exposure than did other workers. Age, duration of sawmill employment, atopy, race, and cigarette smoking did not influence the occurrence of hyperresponsiveness. Levels of plicatic-acid-specific IgE antibodies did not change substantially over the 2 yr. These results indicate that immunologic sensitivity to plicatic acid and change in airway caliber are associated with the occurrence of bronchial hyperresponsiveness in cedar workers.\r"

Of 232 patients receiving ventilatory support at this center, 63 (27%) survived an initial episode of ventilatory support. In contrast, 74% of nonventilated patients survived at least 6 months after transplantation. Among patients with malignant disease (n = 992), a multivariate regression model revealed 3 pretransplant factors that were associated with ventilatory support: age greater than or equal to 21 yr (RR = 1.6, 95% confidence intervals [Cl] = 1.3, 2.0), hematologic malignancy in relapse (RR = 2.1, 95% Cl = 1.7, 2.4), and HLA nonidentical donor-recipient pair (nonidentical graft) (RR = 1.7, 95% Cl = 1.4, 2.1). Survival after ventilatory support was not found to be associated with any pretransplant or post-transplant factors examined. We conclude that although the risk factors for mechanical ventilatory support after marrow transplantation can be defined, we are unable to identify characteristics predictive of survival after such support. The implications of these findings in relation to patient selection and future research activities are discussed.\r"

Three groups of dogs were inoculated endotracheally: Group I (n = 5) with sterile broth, and Groups II (n = 5) and III (n = 10) with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Gas exchange, hemodynamics, and plasma prostaglandins were measured before inoculation and hourly thereafter for 5 h in Groups I and II but only once in Group III, 5 h after inoculation. All animals were then killed, and the extent of pneumonia was assessed by lung wet weight and measurement of the percentage of cardiac output (CO) perfusing pneumonic lung using radionuclide-labeled microspheres. None of these measurements changed significantly in Group I, but all dogs in Groups II and III developed severe pneumonia. In Group II, mean arterial oxygen tension fell from 575 +/- 17 to 237 +/- 59 mm Hg (FIO2 = 1.0), with an increase in pulmonary shunt from 6 +/- 2% to 24 +/- 6%.

  ".W": "The presence of cilia on epithelia of the respiratory tract was reported more than 150 yr ago, and the two-layer model of mucus transport was put forward more than 50 yr ago. However, it is only in the last 10 yr or so that the motion of mucus-propelling cilia of the mammalian respiratory system has been adequately described, and fluid dynamic studies have developed far enough to allow descriptions of the mechanisms by which ciliary movement is coupled to mucus transport. In this review, scientific developments on the study of cilia and mucus, and interactions between them, are drawn together to further understanding of mucociliary clearance mechanisms of the respiratory tract. The study of the cilia incorporates a discussion of the internal mechanics and biochemistry of the ciliary axoneme, the physical principles of the beat pattern, and the (weak) metachronal coordination of cilia in the lung. Mucus rheology plays a central role in mucociliary transport with the rheologic properties of the mucus determining the effective functioning of this clearance mechanism. Theoretical models provide information on the mechanical principles of the beat pattern as well as providing reliable estimates of the transport rates. Although airflow is not thought to contribute to mucus transport in the normal state, high frequency ventilation and coughing may make significant contributions.\r"

  ".W": "The axonal transport systems have a wide variety of primary roles and secondary responses in neurological disease processes. Recent advances in understanding these roles have built on the increasingly detailed insights into the cell biology of the axon and its supporting cells. Fast transport is a microtubule-based system of bidirectional movement of membranous organelles; the mechanism of translocation of these organelles involves novel proteins, including the recently described protein of fast anterograde transport, kinesin. Slow transport conveys the major cytoskeletal elements, microtubules, and neurofilaments. Several types of structural changes in diseased nerve fibers are understood in terms of underlying transport abnormalities. Altered slow transport of neurofilaments produces changes in axonal caliber (swelling or atrophy) and is involved in some types of perikaryal neurofibrillary abnormality. Secondary changes in slow axonal transport--for example, the reordered synthesis and delivery of cytoskeletal proteins after axotomy--also can produce changes in axonal caliber. Secondary demyelination can be a prominent late consequence of a sustained alteration of neurofilament transport. Impaired fast transport is found in experimental models of distal axonal degeneration (dying back). Retrograde axonal transport provides access to the central nervous system for agents such as polio virus and tetanus toxin, as well as access for known and hypothetical trophic factors. Correlative studies of axonal transport, axonal morphometry, cytoskeletal ultrastructure, and molecular biology of cytoskeletal proteins are providing extremely detailed reconstructions of the pathogenesis of experimental models of neurological disorders. A major challenge lies in the extension of these approaches to clinical studies.\r"

Assessment was done by serial quantitative neurological examinations and Kurtzke's Expanded Disability Status Scale. Frequency of relapse and patient self-evaluation also failed to show significant differences. Overall deterioration observed in both groups during the trial was only minor.

  ".W": "Immunoreactive class 1 and class 2 major histocompatibility complex gene products (MHCP) and beta 2 microglobulin (beta 2 MG) were demonstrated by microscopic immunocytochemistry in cryostat sections of skeletal muscle biopsies of 67 patients with various neuromuscular diseases. Diagnoses included normal muscle, chronic partial denervation, Duchenne dystrophy, polymyositis, dermatomyositis, inclusion body myositis, and miscellaneous neuromuscular diseases. Normal mature muscle fibers did not express MHCP, but blood vessels showed both class 1 and 2 MHCP and beta 2 MG. Regenerating muscle fibers showed consistent sarcolemmal class 1 MHCP expression irrespective of the disease. In polymyositis, the majority of extrafusal muscle fibers of most patients showed strong sarcolemmal class 1 MHCP expression. In dermatomyositis, muscle fibers situated either in perifascicular or in randomly clustered distribution revealed strong class 1 MHCP reactivity. In inclusion body myositis, scattered small clusters of muscle fibers were positive for class 1 MHCP. In polymyositis and inclusion body myositis, particularly strong class 1 MHCP expression was invariably seen in nonnecrotic muscle fibers partially invaded by lymphocytes whose cytotoxic effects are believed to be class 1 MHCP restricted. Factors or agents that trigger class 1 MHCP expression are presumed also to sensitize lymphocytes to muscle fibers in these diseases, but their identity remains obscure at this time. In dermatomyositis, the expression of MHCP in perifascicular muscle fibers and in areas of capillary loss may represent the triggering of MHCP expression by a nonspecific cellular stress reaction, in this case probably low-grade ischemia.\r"

We initially postulated that the presence of mutagenic contaminants in commercially available DNCB might account for part of its mutagenicity. We have now characterized changes in the dose-mutagenic response curve of 99% DNCB modified by adding 1% concentrations of known contaminants: 1-chloro-2-nitrobenzene; 1,3-dinitrobenzene; and 2,4-dichloronitrobenzene. Dose-response curves were generated using Salmonella typhimurium tester strains TA-98 and TA-100 at concentrations of 0, 1, 5, 10, 25, 50, and 100 micrograms per plate in a modified Ames assay. We observed a linear dose-response relationship with a slight, but nonsignificant, shift to the right when contaminants were added. We conclude that DNCB is itself mutagenic, and that contaminants play a minor role in its observed mutagenicity.\r"

The specificity was 95-99%, sensitivity was 86-96%, and accuracy was 95-98%. Duplex scanning wrongly identified occlusion in four arteries and failed to detect occlusion in one artery. In making decisions prior to carotid endarterectomy, even infrequent errors are unacceptable. We recommend angiography of all surgical candidates with apparent severe stenosis when the internal carotid artery cannot be clearly identified on duplex, or to distinguish apparent occlusion from undetectably low blood flow.\r"

Concentrations of fibronectin, fibrinogen, and immunoglobulins were significantly higher in the uveitic group compared with other diseases and normal controls. The irises from patients with glaucoma showed fewer infiltrating cells and less fibronectin and fibrinogen. Enhancement of major histocompatibility complex class II antigen HLA-DR expression was observed in all disease groups compared with controls. These findings suggest that in patients with uveitis and acute glaucoma the infiltrating T lymphocytes and the presence of fibronectin, fibrinogen, and immunoglobulins may contribute to the greater risk of postsurgical inflammation, leading to such problems as closure of the iridectomy. The enhancement of HLA-DR antigen expression in the iris may indicate abnormalities of iris resident cells seen in various diseases.\r"

Immunologic and functional levels of protein S and C4b-binding protein in plasma were determined for 20 newborn infants and compared with adult normal pooled plasma. Total protein S antigen levels averaged 23%, similar to other vitamin K-dependent plasma proteins. However, the protein S anticoagulant activity was 74% of that of adult normal plasma. This apparent discrepancy of activity to antigen was shown to be due to low or undetectable levels of C4b-binding protein, which results in the presence of most if not all of protein S in its free and active form. The relatively high level of anticoagulantly active protein S in infants may enhance the potential of the protein C pathway, thereby minimizing risks of venous thrombosis in this group.\r"

  ".U": "88150186\r", 
  ".W": "The expression of cytoplasmic CD3 (CyCD3) was analyzed in 45 leukemias, five thymus cell samples, five peripheral blood (PB) samples, and ten cell lines. All T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias (T-ALL) that did not express surface membrane CD3 (SmCD3) appeared to express CyCD3. Furthermore, the majority of SmCD3+ T-ALL also expressed CyCD3. Analogous results were obtained with thymus cell samples in that about 95% of the thymocytes expressed CyCD3 whereas 60% to 75% of the thymocytes also expressed SmCD3. In normal peripheral blood only prominent SmCD3 expression was found. These data indicate that immature T cells express CyCD3 only, that the combined expression of CyCD3 and SmCD3 is characteristic for intermediate differentiation stages, and that mature T cells express prominent SmCD3. All (precursor) B cell leukemias, acute myeloid leukemias, and non-T cell lines tested did not express CyCD3. On the basis of these data, we conclude that CyCD3 expression is restricted to the T cell lineage and can be used as a diagnostic marker for immature SmCD3- T cell malignancies. Therefore, we evaluated which fixative is optimal for CyCD3 staining, and we determined by immunofluorescence staining and Western blotting which anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody (MoAb) can be used for the detection of CyCD3. In our opinion, acid ethanol was the best fixative for the cytocentrifuge preparations. Furthermore, we demonstrated that CyCD3 can be easily detected by use of MoAbs raised against denaturated CD3 chains such as those of the SP series (SP-6, SP-10, SP-64, and SP-78). In addition we tested 22 anti-CD3 MoAbs of the Oxford CD3 panel that were raised against native SmCD3, and it appeared that only four (UCHT1, VIT-3b, G19-41 and SK7/Leu-4) of them were able to detect CyCD3. In Western blot analysis all four MoAbs recognized the CD3-epsilon chain only.\r"

  ".W": "The human monoblastlike cell line U937 can be induced to differentiate by a variety of agents including gamma-interferon, phorbol esters, retinoic acid, and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (VD3). Incubation of U937 with 1 to 1,000 units of recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) did not induce macrophage differentiation. A synergistic effect on macrophage differentiation was observed, however, when U937 was cocultured with 10(-8) mol/L VD3 plus 50 U/mL GM-CSF. GM-CSF-plus VD3-treated cells demonstrated significant increases in OKM1 antigen expression, increased chemokinesis and chemotaxis, and increased Fc receptor-mediated erythrophagocytosis. Human peripheral blood monocyte cultures also demonstrated increased OKM1 antigen expression and chemotaxis when incubated with 50 to 500 U/mL of GM-CSF for 48 to 72 hours. VD3, however, was not necessary for the increases in effector function observed for GM-CSF-stimulated monocyte cultures. In distinction to the synergistic effect of GM-CSF on VD3-induced differentiation of U937, recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) at comparable concentrations had no augmenting effect over that observed for VD3 alone. These results suggest that GM-CSF, in the presence of other physiological stimuli, can induce significant phenotypic changes in GM-CSF-nonresponsive cells of the monocytic lineage and can increase the effector functions of GM-CSF-responsive peripheral blood monocyte cultures.\r"

The present study examines the possibility that binding of autologous IgG to sickle erythrocytes may be associated with the sickling phenomenon. In the present study we subjected low-density erythrocytes to prolonged sickling under nitrogen in the presence of platelet-poor autologous plasma with added glucose for 24 hours (37 degrees C). After reoxygenation IgG bound in vitro was quantified by a nonequilibrium 125iodinated protein A-binding assay and by flow cytometry. Results show that sickle erythrocytes incubated under nitrogen bound significantly (P less than .001) more IgG, 439 +/- 41, molecules of IgG per cell (mean +/- SD) compared with sickle cells incubated under oxygenation (227 +/- 12 molecules of IgG per red cell) or compared with 196 +/- 26 molecules IgG per cell for untreated sickle cells. In contrast, normal erythrocytes incubated in autologous plasma exhibited no detectable IgG binding in vitro under either oxygenation or deoxygenation. Flow cytometry shows that deoxygenation of sickle cells generated a two-to-sixfold increase in the subpopulation of brightly fluorescent IgG-positive cells in comparison to oxygenated sickle cells and a 13.5% +/- 3.1% (mean +/- SD) increase in median fluorescence intensity for fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled deoxygenated sickled cells compared with labeled oxygenated sickle cells. Our studies demonstrate that prolonged sickling will induce in vitro binding of autologous IgG to sickle erythrocytes. These findings indicate that sickle erythrocytes may be unique when compared with erythrocytes from other nonimmunologic hemolytic anemias or senescent red cells in that the primary events producing surface antigens recognized by autoantibody may include the sickling process. These findings also suggest that sickling in vivo may generate membrane alterations in sickle erythrocytes that lead to cumulative binding of autoantibody in vivo.\r"

  ".W": "Human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) enhances numerous functions of mature neutrophils (PMN) including phagocytosis, superoxide responses to chemotaxins, antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, and expression of complement receptors. A central question concerns whether the mechanism of enhancement involves quantitative increases in the response of all cells v subpopulation recruitment. The effects of GM-CSF on individual cell light scatter changes, membrane potential, and oxidant responses induced by the chemoattractant N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (FMLP) were assessed by flow cytometry and by scoring individual cells for nitroblue tetrazolium dye (NBT) reduction. GM-CSF produced a dose- and time-dependent shift in forward light scatter that was very similar in character to that seen with FMLP or leukotriene B4 stimulation. Although not capable of depolarizing the cells directly, GM-CSF primed PMNs for enhanced membrane potential responses to FMLP by significantly increasing the proportion of depolarizing cells when compared with diluent-treated controls after a 60-minute incubation at 37 degrees C (79.4% +/- 3.4% v 29.5% +/- 4.7% GM-CSF v diluent, mean +/- SE, P less than .005, n = 11). Subpopulation recruitment by GM-CSF treatment was also demonstrated by the FMLP-elicited NBT test. Taken together, these results indicate that GM-CSF can modulate the function of mature PMN by enhancing the proportion of responsive cells.\r"

In this study, the effects of three recombinant human CSFs (granulocyte-monocyte CSF [GM-CSF], interleukin 3 [IL-3], and granulocyte CSF [G-CSF]) on antibody-independent monocyte tumoricidal activity were investigated by using WEHI 164 fibrosarcoma cells as monocyte-sensitive targets. None of the CSFs directly induced monocyte cytotoxicity, although both GM-CSF and IL-3 were found to significantly enhance monocyte killing in response to a second stimulatory event (endotoxin). No effect was seen with G-CSF. Antitumor necrosis factor antibody completely abolished CSF-enhanced monocyte cytotoxicity, which suggests that this effect was mediated through increased release of tumor necrosis factor (TNF). As previously shown for GM-CSF, IL-3 was found to induce cytoplasmic accumulation of TNF messenger RNA (mRNA) after 18 hours of exposure. These results suggest that GM-CSF and IL-3 may stimulate monocyte killing indirectly by enhancing expression of TNF mRNA, thereby leading to augmented TNF protein secretion in response to a second activation signal.\r"

  ".U": "88150199\r", 
  ".W": "Small vessel (microvascular) endothelial cells are in close contact with hematopoietic progenitor cells in the bone marrow and therefore may have an important role in hematopoiesis. Although other studies have shown that endothelial cells produce various colony-stimulating factors (CSFs), these studies examined large vessel endothelial cells, which are different in many respects from microvascular endothelial cells and which do not contact cells in the bone marrow. We show in this study that primary cultures of unstimulated rat fat capillary endothelial cells grown in serum-free medium produce a substantial amount of granulocyte-macrophage CSF (GM-CSF). The medium conditioned by these cells stimulated proliferation of two different lines of GM-CSF-responsive cells--PT-18 mast cells and FDC-P1 cells--and supported the growth of cells of the granulocyte and macrophage lines in cultures of rat bone marrow cells. The factor responsible for this activity had physical properties consistent with those of GM-CSF, namely, a similar apparent mol wt by gel filtration, resistance to repeated freeze-thaws, resistance to boiling for ten minutes but not for 30 minutes, and resistance to heating to 56 degrees C for one hour. The factor causing target cell stimulation was not B cell-stimulating factor-1 (BSF-1, or IL 4), since it failed to stimulate a BSF-1-responsive cell line HT2-JH, and target cells (PT-18) did not respond appreciably to recombinant BSF-1. Northern blot analysis of mRNA from rat fat capillary endothelial cells showed high levels of expression of GM-CSF, confirming that this factor is produced by microvascular endothelial cells. This is the first report of CSF production by unstimulated microvascular endothelial cells, demonstrating that these ubiquitous cells are capable of producing sizable amounts of at least one growth factor for hematopoietic progenitor cells.\r"

Treatment was continued, when possible, for a period of 6 months. Determination of response to treatment was based on clinical course, repeat bone marrow biopsies, and aspirates and blood counts (CBC) with WBC differential, platelet, and reticulocyte numbers at specified intervals. No significant difference was noted between the two treatment groups in response to test drug (P = .66). One patient (3%) in the 13-CRA group and two patients (6%) in the placebo group had a minor response. Approximately 30% of patients in both groups had progression of their disease, and progression-free survival was nearly identical. Greater than 90% of the patients receiving 13-CRA developed mild or moderate skin toxicity that was reversible with decreasing or discontinuing the drug.

Approximately 5% of day seven CFU-GM were resistant to 2,000 micrograms/ml G418, using a supernatant infection protocol in the absence of vector-producing cells. A greater proportion of CFU-GM colonies were recovered relative to uninfected controls as the stringency of selection was diminished. Enzyme activity was detected in drug-resistant colonies, confirming that the resistant colonies obtained after infection with N2 represented cells producing neomycin phosphotransferase. Activity in the CFU-GM colonies approached 50% of that of drug-resistant vector-producing cells on a per cell basis. To test the hypothesis that more rapidly cycling bone marrow cells would be more susceptible to vector infection, we treated progenitor cells obtained from cyclic hematopoietic (CH) dogs with the N2 vector. Despite the increased numbers of hematopoietic progenitor cells obtained from CH dogs, the proportion of G418-resistant CFU-GM did not increase over that obtained with N2-infected normal marrow. These results demonstrate that retroviral vectors can be used to transfer and express exogenous genes in canine hematopoietic progenitor cells.\r"

We developed a canine model to test the applicability of these techniques to a preclinical model of human marrow transplantation. Previously we reported that canine CFU-GM could be infected with retroviral vectors carrying either the gene for a mutant dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) or neomycin phosphotransferase (NEO). This study reports six lethally irradiated dogs transplanted with autologous marrow cocultivated with retroviral vector-producing cells. This procedure conferred drug resistance to 3% to 13% of the CFU-GM. Three dogs infected with either the NEO or DHFR virus engrafted, but we detected no drug-resistant CFU-GM. Three dogs were given marrow infected with a DHFR virus and received methotrexate (MTX) as in vivo selection; all three had evidence of engraftment. In the surviving dog, we detected 0.03% to 0.1% MTX-resistant CFU-GM at 3 to 5 weeks posttransplant during in vivo selection. These results indicate that we can reconstitute lethally irradiated dogs with autologous marrow exposed to retroviral vectors and suggest that gene transfer into hematopoietic cells is feasible on a large scale. However, the low-level transient gene expression indicates that considerable obstacles remain before human gene therapy can be considered.\r"

Because tumor-specific immune mechanisms persist in both irradiated and nude mice, it has not been possible to determine if this result is due to rejection of cells already immortalized by retrovirus infection, or reflects an inherent limitation in the proliferative capacity and malignancy of these \"preleukemic\" cells. To clarify these issues, we have transplanted virus-infected bone marrow into mouse fetuses that are immunologically immature and thus incapable of graft rejection. We report here that within days of virus inoculation, transplantable cells capable of disease progression in certain fetal hosts can be detected with this technique. These results demonstrate that cells with the capacity for extensive leukemic proliferation arise very early in Friend virus-induced disease. However, successful transplantation was seen only in genetically anemic recipients (Wx/Wv), which are deficient in hematopoietic stem cells, and not in their normal littermates. Thus, in accord with recent in vitro observations, this in vivo data suggests that normal hematopoietic cells, independent of immune mechanisms, can suppress the malignant progression of transformed cells.\r"

Using high-affinity antibodies specific to phosphotyrosine (P-Tyr), we have shown the presence at high concentrations of P-Tyr-modified proteins in mouse bone-marrow megakaryocytes. Immunofluorescence microscopy of semithin frozen sections revealed that P-Tyr labeling was localized in a punctate pattern in the majority of the cytoplasm. The thin outer rim of the cytoplasm and the cell membrane was devoid of the label. Immunogold electron microscopy of ultrathin frozen sections showed that P-Tyr labeling was concentrated mostly on the membranes of the vesicles in the cytoplasm. The membrane demarcation system characteristic of megakaryocytes was not labeled. The intensity of P-Tyr labeling varied from one megakaryocyte to another. These results suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation of specific proteins might be correlated with the developmental stage of megakaryocytes, possibly related to the formation and deposition of the granules.\r"

Smoking cessation is probably important, although its benefit in established COPD is unproven. Bronchodilator therapy may be of more than symptomatic benefit and is indicated in virtually all patients. Specific beta 2-agonists are the most widely used agents and can be given in substantially larger doses than are usually recommended. Ipratropium bromide, an anticholinergic drug, is about as effective as a beta 2-agonist, but in large doses the two drugs do not seem to have additive effects, unlike theophylline and beta 2-agonists. Systemic corticosteroids decrease airway obstruction substantially in a small number of patients with COPD; these agents should be reserved for these patients and used sparingly. Inhaled steroids are of little benefit, as are respiratory stimulants and depressants. Broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy helps to relieve symptomatic exacerbations of COPD, particularly those characterized by increased dyspnea, sputum volume and sputum purulence. Cor pulmonale is best managed by diuretics and oxygen, with digoxin reserved for left ventricular failure and supraventricular arrhythmias. Continuous oxygen therapy at home is indicated for the patients who have chronic arterial hypoxemia.\r"

  ".W": "From 1981 to 1983, 131 previously untreated patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) standard-risk group were entered to the protocol JCCLSG-S811. Of 119 eligible patients, 115 (96.6%) attained complete remission by treatment with prednisone (PRD) plus vincristine (VCR) or vindesine (VDS). After preventive central nervous system (CNS) therapy including 18 Gy cranial irradiation and three doses of intrathecal methotrexate (MTX), the patients were assigned randomly to the two maintenance chemotherapies, Regimen A and Regimen B. Regimen A (intermittent regimen) consisted of PRD (120 mg/m2/day by mouth for 5 days) plus 6-mercaptopurine (6MP) (175 mg/m2/day by mouth for 5 days) plus VCR (2.0 mg/m2 intravenously) alternating biweekly with MTX (225 mg/m2 intravenously). Regimen B (continuous regimen) consisted of 6MP (50 mg/m2/day by mouth) plus MTX (20 mg/m2/week by mouth) combined with pulses of PRD and VCR (the same dosages as Regimen A) every 4 weeks. As the late intensification therapy (LIT), five courses of high-dose MTX (2000 mg/m2 per dose per week intravenously for three doses every 12 weeks) with leucovorin rescue were administered to all patients who were in continuous complete remission (CCR) for more than 2 years. Sixty and 55 patients, respectively, were registered in Regimen A and B. The CCR rates in Regimen A and B were 75.1% +/- 5.8% (mean +/- 1 SE) and 49.7% +/- 7.3% (P less than 0.01) at 4 years, and 72.1% +/- 6.3% and 49.7% +/- 7.3% (P less than 0.05) at 5 years, respectively. In Regimen B, CNS and testicular relapses increased after 3 years of CCR. In addition, the patients in Regimen B had a much higher incidence of infections than Regimen A. The LIT did not seem to have important effects on the duration of CCR. From these data we conclude that the intermittent cyclic regimen of 6MP and MTX may be more effective as compared to the continuous administration of these drugs in the maintenance chemotherapy.\r"

Lymph node biopsy specimens from two patients showed near total effacement of the nodal architecture by a diffuse infiltration of immunoblasts and plasma cells. The proliferative process was determined to be polyclonal with immunohistochemical techniques. Cytogenetic studies of bone marrow from two patients showed a pseudodiploid abnormal clone, with a translocation involving a break in band 14q32 in each case. The pathogenesis of these proliferative disorders in unclear, although three patients had some evidence of an acute immune disorder. One of these patients was treated with steroids, vincristine, and cyclophosphamide. Another patient was treated with steroids only, and one patient was treated with steroids and cyclophosphamide. All had rapid regression of the disease process. Two patients are alive and apparently free of disease 31 and 48 months after diagnosis. One died of sepsis. The fourth patient had acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) and died without therapy. The biology of the immunoblastic proliferation of these patients is uncertain. The immunohistochemical results suggest a reactive, polyclonal proliferation, but the cytogenetic abnormalities in two patients indicate the possibility of a cryptic neoplastic clone.\r"

Serial sections were examined with antisera to glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). In five ependymal tumors (one ependymoma, two papillary ependymomas, and two primitive neuroectodermal tumors [PNET] with ependymal cells), a variable number of cytokeratin-positive cells were present. Most tumor cells (except two PNET) were positive with GFAP antisera. Many cytokeratin-positive cells were present in all choroid plexus tumors. GFAP-positive cells were present focally in six of 11 papillomas and in one of four carcinomas. Although their staining patterns and distribution were clearly different, focal coexistence of cytokeratin and GFAP was observed in six papillomas and two ependymal tumors. Thus, some ependymal tumors (especially papillary ependymomas and occasional PNET) and many choroid plexus tumors have demonstrable positivity with antibody to cytokeratin, suggesting a transitional cell type with features of both ependyma and choroid plexus.\r"

Despite this aggressive surgery, recurrence rates of approximately 9% have been reported with the removal of benign tumors, and the rate is much higher with the removal of malignant meningiomas. Recurrence most frequently occurs at the original tumor site and is most often explained by incomplete removal, which, in turn, is a function of the anatomic location of the tumor. Less common are regional recurrences, which may be explained on the basis of the multicentric origin of meningiomas. This theory may also explain the rare entity, \"multiple meningioma.\" This article documents an unexpected regional recurrence of meningioma. The pertinent literature is reviewed.\r"

Cells of a solid type GT showed numerous subplasmalemmal pinocytotic vesicles, thin filaments with scattered dense bodies, and thick external lamina, but negative desmin staining and a lack of glycogen. Similar findings also were observed in the GS, but were less obvious. The GS compressed the surrounding GT, exhibited many mitotic figures, prominent nucleoli, elongated nuclei and cytoplasm, and reacted more strongly to vimentin staining than the GT. The GT contained S-100 protein-positive Schwann cells, a few substance P-positive nerve fibers, and moderate numbers of infiltrating mast cells. None of these findings were observed in the GS. Results were consistent with the view that GS was transformed possibly from the GT, and that the good prognosis for GS may be due to its small size that may be related to the preexistence of a pain-causing GT.\r"

There was no change in serum creatinine, beta 2-microglobulin, or endogenous creatinine clearance during guanfacine monotherapy.

Moreover, a growing number of acquired new chemical entities are coming from sources outside the United States, particularly Japan. These and other trends suggest an overall decline in research activity in the United States. At the same time, foreign firms are becoming more active, foretelling greater competition in the United States for both market share and research resources.

However, a marked decrease in platelet reactivity was seen in almost all patients treated with gemfibrozil during exercise. The adrenaline concentration necessary to induce secondary aggregation increased in eight patients during exercise after gemfibrozil and in two after placebo treatment. When adenosine diphosphatase (2 to 4 mumol/L) was used to induce aggregation, 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin) and thromboxane B2 secretion by platelets decreased by 35% and 67%, respectively, during exercise in patients treated with gemfibrozil. The area under the aggregation curve decreased by 28% during exercise after gemfibrozil. No significant changes occurred in these variables during exercise after placebo.

The aim of the study was to examine the responses of plasma glucose, C-peptide immunoreactivity (CPR) and total immunoreactive insulin (IRI) to a standard meal in heroin addicts, since the presence of immunoreactive beta-endorphin has been demonstrated in human endocrine pancreas. 2. Ten heroin addicts and 10 control subjects participated in the study. The addicts had been taking heroin (from 0.5 to 2 g/day) for at least 2 months and they had no detectable diseases. 3. After a 12 h fast, each subject received a standard meal; blood samples were taken at -15, 0, 15, 30, 60 and 120 min to determine glucose, CPR and IRI. Calculation of the CPR/IRI molar ratio was used as a semiquantitative estimation of the hepatic extraction of insulin. 4. No difference in plasma glucose was observed between the groups. Addicts had lower CPR than normals at 15, 30 and 120 min (P less than 0.01). On the contrary, IRI was higher in addicts than in normals (P less than 0.05 at -15 and 0 min, P less than 0.01 at 15, 30 and 60 min), except at 120 min. The CPR/IRI molar ratio was lower in addicts (P less than 0.01). 5. Heroin addiction seems to produce a beta-cell failure and contemporaneously a state of hyperinsulinaemia; blood glucose remains in the normal range. 6. We conclude that chronic heroin addiction may produce a change in the rate of hepatic extraction of insulin.\r"

The predominant form of bone disease is osteoporosis, and it seems likely that most osteoporosis in the middle-aged man can be attributed to alcohol abuse. The reason alcohol abuse leads to osteoporosis remains unclear. Vitamin D deficiency, hyperparathyroidism, and decreased intestinal calcium absorption may play a role, but a direct inhibitory effect of alcohol on bone remodeling seems a more likely explanation. No effective form of treatment has yet been established. Bone lost may not be regained. The best approach is to stop the alcohol abuse before the bone disease becomes manifest.\r"

Joint fluid aspiration should almost always be performed when fluid is present. The diagnosis of gout or CPPD deposition disease usually requires crystal identification from joint fluid for diagnosis. Treatment of shoulder arthritis with oral anti-inflammatory medication is usually indicated; appropriate treatment of the underlying disorder, e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, is necessary.

The most important aspect of spondylitis management is a program of regular exercises, aided by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and physical therapy. Indomethacin and phenylbutazone are most effective in AS and RS, although the latter drug should be used with care and only after a trial of other NSAIDs. The mainstay of peripheral arthritis management is the use of NSAIDs and intra-articular corticosteroids, but several delayed-acting drugs (gold, cytotoxic drugs) are beneficial in difficult cases, depending on the type and severity of the disease.\r"

The elucidation of mast cell function is complicated by growing evidence that mast cells are heterogeneous. Recent studies of mast cell ontogeny suggest that microenvironmental stimuli control the phenotypic expression of parts of the genome leading to subtype differences in a common lineage. Mast cells influence cell proliferation, differentiation, and activation in a range of target cells, although until recently they were considered important only in immediate hypersensitivity. However, they function in delayed-type hypersensitivity, potentiate cytotoxicity of eosinophils and macrophages, and are cytotoxic for certain targets themselves. Mast cell mediators influence blood flow and vascular permeability and facilitate angiogenesis. Numerous mast cell mediators are immunoregulatory. In vitro experiments have begun to investigate the role of mast cells in fibrotic diseases. Further knowledge of mast cell heterogeneity will provide the basis for new therapies in inflammatory diseases of the intestine and other organs.\r"

The responses to leukotrienes and related mediators are attributable to binding by stereospecific cellular receptors and consequent activation of biochemical transductional sequences analogous to those characteristic of other receptor systems. The elevated concentrations of these mediators in lesional fluids and tissues of inflammatory bowel disease and other hypersensitivity and inflammatory states are, in some instances, clearly related to the time course of development of the disease process. Systematic application of specific inhibitors and antagonists that are becoming available will define more clearly the involvement of leukotrienes in health and disease and possibly lead to new therapeutic approaches.\r"

Secretory products of the immune system, which include interleukins and neuropeptides, may also influence the neuroendocrine system. Communication between the two systems is therefore bidirectional. The potential importance of the neuropeptide-immunocyte interaction within the intestinal mucosal immune system is emphasized, and its possible relevance in inflammatory disorders is discussed. This aspect of the \"gut-brain\" interaction deserves further study.\r"

Chemotactic peptides elaborated by both bacteria and leukocytes are the focus of this review. These peptides induce directed migration of inflammatory cells towards their targets, and stimulate biological functions including degranulation, release of oxygen radicals, phagocytosis, and eicosanoid production. Among the released eicosanoids, leukotriene B4 potentiates the leukocyte response. As with other chemotactic factors, these functions are regulated partially through differential coupling to high- and low-affinity receptors and via calcium as the second messenger. Some chemotactic peptides are elaborated by normal colonic luminal bacteria. Recent evidence demonstrates that these peptides can produce mucosal inflammation in vivo. A possible mechanism for this effect involves abnormal colonic permeability in susceptible individuals that allows bacterial chemotactic peptides access to the mucosa where they may induce inflammation. Remaining questions include the mechanism by which the mucosal barrier is breached and the role of leukotrienes in the potentiation of colonic inflammation.\r"

  ".U": "88151622\r", 
  ".W": "Reactive oxygen metabolites (ROMs) are partially reduced oxygen species that include superoxide, hydrogen peroxide, hydroxyl radical, and hypohalous acids. Formation of superoxide or hydrogen peroxide may be injurious to tissue directly; however, it is thought that the primary mediators of tissue damage are the secondarily derived oxidants such as hydroxyl radical and hypohalous acid. The gastrointestinal tract is particularly well endowed with the enzymatic machinery necessary to form large amounts of ROMs. Sources of ROMs in the gastrointestinal tract include mucosal oxidases such as xanthine oxidase, amine oxidase, and aldehyde oxidase as well as the NADPH oxidase found in the resident phagocytic leukocytes (macrophages, neutrophils, eosinophils) of the lamina propria. We have demonstrated that reperfusion of ischemic small intestine results in substantial mucosal injury that is mediated by oxy radicals generated from xanthine oxidase and inflammatory leukocytes. The final mediator of toxicity appears to be the hydroxyl radical derived from the iron-catalyzed interaction between superoxide and hydrogen peroxide. Data from our laboratories as well as other laboratories suggest that reactive oxygen metabolites may play an important role in mediating mucosal injury during active episodes of ulcerative colitis. We present a working hypothesis which states that transient ischemic episodes in the bowel initiate a cascade of self-perpetuating cycles of ROM formation, inflammation and, ultimately, mucosal injury.\r"

Further release of inflammatory mediators follows activation of axon collaterals associated with these afferent nerve endings as axon reflexes. Substance P, somatostatin, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, and calcitonin gene-related peptide are candidate mediators. Recent evidence suggests that several of these peptides may be colocalized either with one or more other peptides or with acetylcholine or noradrenalin. Communicating pathways exist between nerves within the mucosa and the muscle layers. Both long and short visceral reflexes occur. Inflammatory, mechanical, or chemical stimuli reaching the mucosa may release peptides from peripheral nerve endings. Thus neurogenic inflammation may be an important factor in inflammatory bowel disease.\r"

Treatment of infectious conjunctivitis is guided by interpretation of a Gram's stain and subsequent culture of any exudate present. Initial treatment of most cases includes use of topical antibiotic and local comfort measures. Complications of infectious conjunctivitis include more invasive disease such as keratitis or abscess formation, with potential corneal perforation and destruction. All patients should be referred for ophthalmologic followup, both to assess adequacy of treatment and to treat unexpected complications. Remember that allergic conjunctivitis is a common condition that responds to antihistamine decongestant medications given orally or topically. Occasionally these conditions are caused by self-prescribed use of ocular medication, and discontinuation of all eye medication is required. Corticosteroid eye drops are rarely indicated and should be used only at the direction of an ophthalmologist. When the diagnosis is uncertain, treatment is best withheld, as \"shotgun\" therapy is seldom beneficial.\r"

Plasma ACTH levels increased at 30 and 60 min. ACTH levels in the anterior pituitary lobe (AP) decreased at 30 min, and then returned to control levels at 60 min. No change was seen in the intermediate-posterior pituitary (IP) or the hypothalamus after insulin injection. CRF levels decreased at 30 and 60 min, then returned to control levels at 90 min in the medial basal hypothalamus, including the median eminence. Hybridization with a cDNA probe revealed a single size class of POMC mRNA in AP, IP, and hypothalamus, and the size of POMC mRNA in these tissues did not change during the experimental period. POMC mRNA levels in AP increased at 60 min and reached a peak at 120 min, but those in IP and hypothalamus did not change. These results suggest that 1) insulin-induced hypoglycemia stimulates both secretion and synthesis of ACTH (at least by increasing POMC mRNA levels) in the AP, and 2) the levels of ACTH and POMC mRNA in the IP and hypothalamus are not affected by insulin-induced hypoglycemia.\r"

The molecular mechanisms behind the functional responses of the beta-cell after cytotoxic damage are still largely unknown. The present study in an attempt to elucidate this issue. Mouse pancreatic islets were isolated with collagenase and, after overnight culture, exposed for 30 min at 37 C to 2.2 mM streptozotocin (SZ) or vehicle alone (controls). The islets were subsequently cultured for 6 days in medium RPMI-1640 plus 10% calf serum. After the culture they were subjected to light microscopical examinations or different functional tests during short term incubations. The SZ-treated islets showed markedly diminished insulin release after stimulation with the beta-cell nutrients glucose and leucine plus glutamine. Compounds known to increase intracellular cAMP [theophylline and (Bu)2-cAMP] were able to partially counteract the SZ-induced reduction of insulin release. Stimulation with arginine could also slightly restore the impaired insulin release. Glucose-stimulated oxygen uptake, proinsulin biosynthesis, and insulin and insulin mRNA contents were also decreased, with values at about 50% of the controls. However, the cellular contents of DNA and RNA and total protein biosynthesis rates were essentially normal. Besides mild degranulation in some islets, the morphological appearance of the SZ-treated islets did not reveal any obvious differences compared to the control islets. The present observations suggest that after a toxic injury there remains a population of partially damaged beta-cells, which are able to maintain most of their basal metabolic functions, but fail to maintain adequate insulin biosynthesis and release.\r"

These MAbs react strongly with all endocrine cell subtypes of human pancreatic islets, but minimally if at all with the exocrine acinar cells, vascular cells, and stromal connective tissue cells of the pancreas. The antigen is located on the cell surface (plasma membranes), as indicated by immunofluorescence staining of viable cell preparations. Besides the pancreatic islets, HISL-5, -9, and -14 antigenic determinants are also expressed by thyroid follicular cells, parathyroid chief cells, and anterior pituitary cells, other commonly involved targets in organ-specific autoimmune disorders. Preliminary biochemical findings indicated that the MAb-defined epitope(s) is trypsin sensitive and resistant to periodate oxidation and exposure to chloroform-methanol. Further biochemical studies, including single step MAb immunoaffinity chromatographic purification, indicate that the antigen recognized by the MAbs HISL-5, -9, and -14 is a 100 K glycoprotein.\r"

  ".W": "Tumoral insulin-producing cells of the RINm5F line display a poor secretory response to D-glucose. Relative to basal insulin output, which corresponds to a fractional release of stored hormone close to 25%/90 min, the glucose-induced increment in insulin release does not exceed 28 +/- 7%. The low efficiency of D-glucose as an insulin secretagogue contrasts with a marked stimulant action of the hexose on peptide biosynthesis. Thus, D-glucose increases in a rapid, sustained, and dose-related manner the incorporation of [3H]leucine or [3H]phenylalanine into trichloroacetic acid-precipitable material; there is a 7-fold difference between basal and glucose-stimulated protein biosynthesis. Although the low proinsulin and insulin content of the tumoral cells, relative to their total protein content, hampers the quantification of newly synthesized hormonal products, the ratio of immunoreactive proinsulin to insulin exceeded the value in normal islet cells; this difference was more marked in secreted than stored material. It is concluded that despite their poor secretory response to D-glucose, the tumoral cells are, in fact, quite sensitive to this hexose, as documented by its effect on biosynthetic activity. Although RINm5F cells are known to display an acute secretory response to nonnutrient secretagogues, the apparent discrepancy between the biosynthetic and secretory responses to D-glucose may be accounted for in part by a severe perturbation in the capacity of the tumoral cells to store proinsulin and insulin.\r"

  ".U": "88151791\r", 
  ".W": "We have previously shown that copper (Cu) leads to a 3- to 4-fold amplification of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) stimulation of LHRH release from explants of the median eminence area (MEA), that this amplification is a saturable function of [Cu], and that complexed Cu but not ionic Cu is the active form of the metal. This implicates a ligand-specific site in Cu action. In this study we address the following questions. Is there a ligand specificity for Cu amplification of PGE2 stimulation of LHRH release, and if so, does it correlate with the ligand specificity for Cu uptake? MEAs of 1-month-old female rats were incubated for 5 min with 150 microM Cu solution and then for 15 min with 10 microM PGE2 (Cu/PGE2); LHRH released into the medium was evaluated by RIA. To assess Cu uptake, MEAs were incubated with 100 microM67 Cu solution for 15 min, and 67Cu accumulation by the MEA was evaluated. The Cu was complexed to one of the following ligands: histamine, His, Cys, Thr, Gly, glutathione, Gly-His-Lys, or albumin. There was a high degree of correlation (r = 0.943) between the ligand specificity for Cu/PGE2 stimulation of LHRH release (Cu action) and 67Cu uptake. Complexation of ionic Cu with His facilitated Cu action and 67Cu uptake 3-fold each, and this was completely prevented by the inclusion of His in a 100-fold excess over the concentration of the Cu/His complex. Histamine, the amino acids, and the peptides facilitated Cu action and 67Cu uptake, whereas albumin did not do so. Of these facilitatory ligands, histamine and His were the most effective and Gly-His-Lys was the least effective. In summary, both 67Cu uptake and Cu action are ligand-dependent and ligand-specific; the Cu interactive sites have a common recognition for the Cu-ligand complex and for the ligand itself; and the ligand specificity for 67Cu uptake and for Cu action are highly correlated. These results are consistent with the ligand specificity for Cu uptake being the primary determinant of the ligand specificity for Cu/PGE2 stimulation of LHRH release.\r"

  ".W": "The ovarian granulosa cell has recently been shown to be a site of somatomedin-C/insulin-like growth factor I (Sm-C/IGF-I) production, reception, and action. These observations have generally been interpreted to suggest the existence of an autocrine loop concerned with granulosa cell physiology. It is the objective of the in vitro studies reported herein to extend these observations by evaluating the interaction of Sm-C/IGF-I with the adjacent thecal-interstitial cell. Treatment of collagenase-processed whole ovarian dispersates or highly enriched (greater than 90%) thecal-interstitial cells from immature rats with Sm-C/IGF-I (50 ng/ml) or hCG (1 ng/ml), resulted in 2.1- and 4.0-fold increments in the accumulation of androsterone (3 alpha-hydroxy-5 alpha-androstane-17-one), the main androgenic steroid identified in culture media. However, combined treatment with both agents unmasked a synergistic interaction producing a 3.3-fold increase in the hCG-stimulated accumulation of androsterone, an effect consequent to enhanced androgen biosynthesis rather than diminished degradation. Unaccounted for by an increase in viable ovarian cell numbers and independent of the hCG dose (0.1-10 ng/ml) used, the Sm-C/IGF-I effect proved time and dose dependent, with a projected minimal effective dose of 3 ng/ml and a minimal time requirement of 72 h. [125I]Iodo-Sm-C/IGF-I binding to untreated highly enriched thecal-interstitial cells proved saturable, with a single class (Hill coefficient = 0.98 +/- 0.01) of high affinity (Kd = 3.0 nM), low capacity (maximum binding = 10,840 +/- 2,108 sites/cell) binding sites. Limited specificity studies using related peptides produced a rank order of competitive potency of: Sm-C/IGF-I greater than multiplication stimulating activity greater than insulin, a pattern compatible with the presence of type I IGF receptors. Other related peptides, such as porcine proinsulin and porcine desoctapeptide insulin, proved weakly effective in inhibiting Sm-C/IGF-I binding to its receptor; unrelated peptides such as porcine relaxin and erythropoietin were without effect. Taken together, these findings suggest that 1) the thecal-interstitial cell, like the granulosa cell, may be a site of Sm-C/IGF-I reception and action, and 2) the ability of high dose insulin to stimulate ovarian androgen biosynthesis may be due to its capacity to act as a Sm-C/IGF-I surrogate, its high dose requirements reflecting cross-interaction with the type I receptor.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to identify major proteins synthesized by the human oviduct and to determine if the ability of the human oviduct to synthesize these proteins was correlated with a specific stage(s) of the menstrual cycle. Oviducts, obtained from normal menstrual and immediately postpartum women, were minced and cultured in the presence of labeled precursors. The culture medium was analyzed for newly synthesized proteins by electrophoresis, followed by fluorography. One-dimensional gel electrophoretic analysis of culture medium of oviducts obtained at midcycle revealed a major diffuse band in the 120,000-130,000 mol wt (Mr) region which was greatly diminished in intensity or nondetectable in the media of oviducts obtained at all other stages of the cycle. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis resolved the 120,000-130,000 Mr region into two major proteins, one basic and one acidic. Both proteins were intensely labeled with glucosamine, and the basic protein also incorporated leucine and methionine. Western blots of culture media incubated with antibodies against human placental proteins (PP) demonstrated that PP4 and PP7 were released throughout the cycle, while PP14 was present only at the late luteal stage of the cycle. This study demonstrates that human oviducts continue to synthesize and release macromolecules during organ culture. Additionally, the synthesis of some of these proteins appeared to be stage specific. The Mr 120,000-130,000 glycoproteins are of particular interest since they were observed in medium from midcycle oviducts, a period when the oviduct participates in gamete transport and embryo development.\r"

  ".W": "An abundant ovarian protein with a relative mol wt (Mr) of 37K and an apparent pI of 8, associated with the onset of sexual maturity in the rabbit, has been identified. Ovaries from sexually mature (greater than 6 months old) rabbits contain large quantities of this 37K protein, while none can be detected in ovaries of immature (1 and 2 months) animals. Analysis of polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) gels of mature ovarian homogenates demonstrates that this protein is more abundant than actin in these preparations. It appears to be tissue specific, since it was not detected in 16 other rabbit tissues tested. Autoradiographic analysis of proteins labeled with 35S in ovarian organ culture demonstrates that a protein of identical Mr and charge to the 37K protein is synthesized in this tissue. Polyclonal sheep antiserum has been produced to the two-dimensional PAGE-purified protein. Immunoblotting of two-dimensional PAGE gels shows specific recognition of this protein and two slightly more acidic proteins of the same Mr by this antiserum. These three protein species also stain identical colors with a silver-based color stain, further suggesting that these are charge variants of the same protein. This protein is not present in corpora lutea isolated form sexually mature ovaries and is present in interstitial cell-enriched ovaries of rabbits which have been actively immunized with zona pellucida proteins. Immunocytochemical localization studies further demonstrate that this protein is localized in the interstitial gland cells. These findings suggest that this 37K protein is not associated with either follicular or luteal cells, but, rather, is linked with the 20 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone-secreting interstitial gland cell population.\r"

A GnRH antagonist (GnRH-ANT) was used to block gonadotroph GnRH receptors in male rats, and a GnRH antiserum (GnRH-AS) was used to inhibit GnRH stimulation of female and male mouse and male rat pituitaries. The postcastration increases in LH beta and common alpha mRNA levels (2- and 3.5-fold, respectively) were abolished in male rats after 7 days of continuous GnRH-ANT infusion. The postcastration increases in LH beta and common alpha mRNA in female (1.9- and 2.2-fold respectively) and male mice (1.4- and 3.6-fold, respectively) were also prevented after daily sc injection of GnRH-AS, as were the rises in LH beta (3-fold) and common alpha (4-fold) in castrated male rats. The pituitary LH content (postgonadectomy) was no different from intact control levels in all experimental animals regardless of treatment, while the increase in serum LH concentration in rats (7- and 8-fold) and in female (4.8-fold) and male mice (9.8-fold) was prevented by both GnRH-ANT and GnRH-AS administration. In intact rats treated with GnRH-ANT the LH beta mRNA level decreased (57%) while the common alpha mRNA level was unaffected after 7 days. Neither pituitary nor serum LH levels were altered in intact rats or mice after appropriate treatments. We conclude that endogenous GnRH is required for the postcastration rise of both LH beta and common alpha-subunit mRNA levels in rats and mice.\r"

  ".W": "In this study we investigated changes in steady state cytoplasmic mRNA levels for LH subunits in pituitaries of male rats desensitized by continuous infusion of GnRH in vivo. Seven days of GnRH infusion (340 micrograms/day) reduced (P less than 0.01) LH beta mRNA levels in intact adult male rats and prevented the LH beta mRNA rise observed after castration. In contrast, common alpha mRNA doubled (P less than 0.05) in intact rats, and the elevated alpha mRNA after 7 days castration was unchanged. Serum and pituitary LH levels were suppressed below values of intact controls. Fourteen days of GnRH infusion (290 micrograms/day) further reduced LH beta mRNA levels in both intact and castrated male rat pituitaries. alpha mRNA levels in intact rat pituitaries were unchanged by 14 days of GnRH infusion, while in castrated rats there was a 23% (P less than 0.05) decrease, though values were still twice those of intact controls. As at 7 days, serum and pituitary LH were suppressed. Infusion of a superagonist analog (Buserelin) at a dose of 14 micrograms/day for 28 days reduced LH beta mRNA to 15% of intact control values in both castrated and intact rats. Common alpha mRNA was significantly (P less than 0.05) increased in intact rats and reduced by 13% (P less than 0.05) in castrates by superagonist infusion. These results were similar to those produced by 20- to 30-fold higher doses of native GnRH. GnRH and agonist analog effects were specific since no changes were observed in other mRNA species (GH, PRL, actin). These results indicate that in GnRH-desensitized gonadotropes LH beta gene expression is inhibited, and this may largely explain the reduced LH biosynthesis. However, there is a differential effect of continuous GnRH or agonist analog treatment on LH subunit gene expression, with a time-dependent stimulation of common alpha gene expression in intact rats. This may be caused by a stimulatory interaction between GnRH and progestagens at the level of the gonadotrope. Thus, common alpha gene expression is less tightly coupled than that of LH beta to GnRH action.\r"

  ".W": "Laminin, a glycoprotein with a molecular weight of approximately 850,000 daltons, is a major constituent of most epithelial basement membranes. Its presence in the extracellular matrix of normal liver, however, is debated. Using two affinity-purified antibodies directed against laminin, we have localized the glycoprotein within normal rat liver and identified its cellular source. Immunofluorescent staining of rat liver sections revealed laminin in a continuous distribution around hepatic sinusoids, adjacent to hepatocytes and sinusoidal lining cells. To determine the cellular origin of laminin, three perisinusoidal cell populations (hepatocytes, sinusoidal endothelial cells, and lipocytes) were purified from enzymatically dispersed rat liver and were established in primary culture. By immunofluorescence, laminin was associated almost exclusively with lipocytes. Synthesis of laminin was demonstrated by immunoprecipitation of the protein from lipocyte culture medium pulse-labeled with radioactive methionine. These results show that in adult liver, laminin is present in the perisinusoidal matrix and is produced by hepatic lipocytes. Lipocytes, which have the capacity to produce collagen as well as laminin, may be the principal source of extracellular matrix proteins in the perisinusoidal space, and may contribute to subendothelial fibrosis resulting from liver injury.\r"

We have used this technique to examine the lytic activity of freshly isolated T cells from noninflamed human colonic mucosa. Anti-CD3-triggered T-cell (anti-CD3-T) cytotoxicity was found in all mucosal specimens studied. The mucosal anti-CD3-T effectors do not have Fc receptors for immunoglobulin G, and are therefore distinct from T gamma cells, which mediate antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. The surface antigen phenotype of mucosal anti-CD3-Ts is CD2+, CD3+, CD8+, CD4-, CD16-, and Leu7-. In contrast, peripheral blood anti-CD3-T effectors are Leu7+. Although non-major histocompatibility complex-restricted, mucosal anti-CD3-T cytotoxicity has considerable target specificity, which differs from that of natural killer and lymphokine-activated killer cells. The profile of target cell susceptibility and the inhibitory effects of anti-CD45 antibody suggest that the CD45 molecule on the effector cell may be an important determinant of anti-CD3-T sensitivity. As anti-CD3-triggered lysis may be a marker of in vivo primed mucosal T cells of undetermined antigen specificity, this technique might have important implications in inflammatory bowel disease, where the antigen(s) inciting the mucosal immune reactivity is not certain.\r"

Pooled estimates of differences in ulcer relapse incidence between patients initially healed with H2-antagonists and patients initially healed with non-H2-antagonist drugs were calculated. The overall incidence of relapse in patients healed with comparator drugs is 11 percentage units lower at six and 12 months, than that observed in H2-antagonist-healed patients. The confidence intervals are +/- 8% at six months and +/- 7% at 12 months. These data suggest the existence of a different effect on relapse incidence for the entire class of comparator drugs taken as a whole, compared with H2-antagonists. On considering the non-H2-antagonists singly, this conclusion holds good only in the case of tripotassium dicitrato bismuthate.\r"

The responsiveness of these rats to the three major vasopressor hormones, angiotensin II, norepinephrine, and vasopressin, was decreased in the early phase of diabetes and returned to normal in the late phase. Acute treatment at the third, sixth, and twelfth weeks with blockers of these vasopressor hormones resulted in a significant fall in blood pressure at the third week with captopril and at the twelfth week with propranolol plus phentolamine. No significant fall was observed when a specific vasopressin inhibitor was administered. Good control of the blood pressure was obtained when these rats were treated chronically with captopril or prazosin, and partial control was achieved when they were fed a low salt diet. An attenuation in arterial blood pressure levels was observed in rats with two-kidney, one clip hypertension when diabetes was induced by streptozotocin. Plasma creatine levels in diabetic rats were significantly higher than those in control rats only in the sixth and twelfth weeks. Electron microscopy revealed some minor glomerular lesions only at the twelfth week.\r"

To this end, we measured changes in plasma corticosterone, vasopressin, plasma renin activity, aldosterone, norepinephrine, and epinephrine in SHR treated with a 4-week intracerebroventricular infusion of captopril (osmotic minipump, 1.25 micrograms/hr) or vehicle in response to cold stress (4 degrees C x 4 hours) or ether stress (5 minutes). Within the fourth week of treatment, the average systolic blood pressure of captopril-treated SHR was significantly lower than that of vehicle-treated rats. Basal plasma levels of corticosterone, but not vasopressin, were significantly lower in SHR treated with captopril. In response to cold stress, captopril-treated SHR showed significantly lesser increases in both corticosterone and vasopressin than did vehicle-treated SHR. There were no differences in basal plasma levels of norepinephrine, epinephrine, plasma renin activity, or aldosterone between captopril-treated and vehicle-treated SHR, and both groups showed elevations of a similar magnitude after exposure to cold. In response to ether stress, captopril-treated SHR also showed significantly smaller increases in corticosterone and vasopressin than did vehicle-treated SHR. These results suggest that chronic intracerebroventricular administration of captopril, through blockade of the brain renin-angiotensin system, alters the hormonal response of SHR to stress.\r"

Drinking responses, peripheral vascular reactivity, and angiotensin II (Ang II) receptor binding in both the brain and vascular smooth muscle were examined in control and captopril-treated SHR. Pregnant and nursing dams were treated with oral captopril (100 mg/kg). After weaning, offspring were maintained on captopril (50 mg/kg). The average systolic pressures after 21 weeks of captopril treatment were 122 +/- 3 mm Hg (male) and 118 +/- 4 mm Hg (female) as compared with 169 +/- 4 mm Hg (male) and 162 +/- 2 mm Hg (female) in age-matched controls. Drinking responses to intracerebroventricular (10 ng) and subcutaneous (100 micrograms/kg) administration of Ang I and II were attenuated in captopril-treated SHR in comparison to control SHR. Ang II receptor binding in the hypothalamus, thalamus, and septum of captopril-treated SHR was also significantly reduced. In contrast to a depressed angiotensinergic system in the brain, peripheral vascular reactivity to Ang II, as determined in isolated, artificially perfused kidneys, was elevated. Threshold and ED50 values for Ang II were significantly lower in captopril-treated SHR than in controls. Ang II receptor binding in aortic smooth muscle cells prepared from captopril-treated SHR was also significantly greater than in cells from controls. Thus, lifetime treatment with captopril induced alterations in the renin angiotensin systems in the periphery and brain that were manifested by changes in receptor binding and responsiveness to Ang II.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

After a 4-week, single-blind, placebo period, each patient underwent 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring and echocardiography. Labetalol therapy was then initiated at 100 mg twice a day in a single-blind manner and increased weekly by 100 mg twice a day until blood pressure control was obtained or a maximum dosage of 400 mg twice a day was reached. Blood pressure control was achieved at a mean daily dose of 363 +/- 46 mg of labetalol. Measurements were repeated at the end of an 8-week maintenance phase. Labetalol therapy significantly reduced the mean 24-hour systolic ambulatory blood pressure from 154 +/- 8 (mean +/- SEM) mm Hg at baseline to 142 +/- 6 mm Hg (p greater than 0.01) and controlled the early morning surge in systolic ambulatory blood pressure. Minor reductions in diastolic blood pressure and heart rate were statistically but not clinically significant. Left ventricular mass was not changed. Labetalol monotherapy provides effective 24-hour control of systolic blood pressure, including the acceleration phase, in patients with isolated systolic hypertension.\r"

These changes are usually associated with unchanged cardiac output, preserved organ blood flows, maintained organ function, and preserved reflex responses without fluid retention in long-term treatment. These drugs do not stimulate plasma renin activity and aldosterone levels. Thus they fulfill many of the major criteria for an ideal antihypertensive agent.\r"

Nitrendipine was titrated in doses of 5 to 30 mg b.i.d. If blood pressure was not controlled with nitrendipine alone, hydrochlorothiazide or propranolol or both were added. After a mean of 29 days in the study, 96 (90%) of 107 patients reached the initial goal of therapy; in 44 (41%) given nitrendipine alone the mean decrease in supine blood pressure was 38/25 mm Hg. After a mean of 91 days, 69 (72%) of 96 patients achieved the final goal of therapy; in 24 (25%) patients given nitrendipine alone the mean supine blood pressure decrease from baseline was 49/33 mm Hg. Falls in blood pressure were comparable in the patients given drug combinations. Seventy-two of 114 patients given study drug(s) had adverse experiences; headache and edema were the most frequent complaints. Only four patients dropped out of the study because of adverse effects. Most abnormal laboratory values occurred when nitrendipine was given with hydrochlorothiazide or propranolol or both. Analysis of severely hypertensive patients followed up in our Virginia center revealed continued control of blood pressure after long-term follow-up (43 +/- 3 [SD] months). Average supine blood pressure was reduced from 180/121 +/- 21/5 to 140/90 +/- 16/9 (SD) mm Hg (p less than 0.001). It was concluded that the calcium antagonist nitrendipine, alone or in combination with a diuretic or beta-blocker or both, is effective in the treatment of severe hypertension.\r"

By restricting their salt intake to less than 80 mmol of sodium per day for 3 months, 50% of patients reaching goal compliance were able to discontinue diuretics. The literature also reveals responses to a low salt diet. Salt restriction augmented the hypotensive effect of chlorthalidone in two investigations, but not in another, and the hypotensive effect of beta-blockers in three trials. Sodium intake of 10 mmol/day caused a much greater decrease in blood pressure in response to a single dose of captopril than did a sodium diet of 200 mmol/day. In patients receiving various fixed regimens for 2 months, salt restriction decreased blood pressure in all but those receiving calcium blockers. A single dose of nifedipine lowered blood pressure more in patients receiving 350 mmol of sodium per day than in the same patients given 150 or 10 mmol/day. Verapamil for 3 days was more effective in patients receiving 212 mmol of sodium per day than in the same subjects receiving 9 mmol/day. Nitrendipine caused a greater decrease in diastolic blood pressure in patients who did not reduce salt intake compared to those who did. Salt restriction appears useful in salt-sensitive patients who receive beta-blockers, diuretics, converting enzyme inhibitors, or centrally acting drugs. Calcium channel entry blockers may not require salt restriction to maximize their effect.\r"

  ".W": "Recent studies have demonstrated that the neurons of the lower brainstem that are responsible for maintaining normal levels of arterial pressure reside in a specific area of the rostral ventrolateral medulla. In rat, the critical zone corresponds to a small region containing a subpopulation of the adrenergic C1 group, defined immunocytochemically by the presence of the epinephrine-synthesizing enzyme phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase. Neurons of this region (the C1 area), possibly including the adrenergic neurons, directly innervate preganglionic neurons in the spinal cord, and are tonically active and sympathoexcitatory. The excitatory transmitter released into the spinal cord is unknown. The discharge of C1 area neurons is locked to the cardiac cycle and, in turn, leads to firing of sympathetic preganglionic neurons. The C1 area neurons are inhibited by baroceptor input and mediate the vascular component of baroceptor reflexes. They also mediate somato-sympathetic pressor responses from skin and muscle and participate in reflex responses to hypoxia. The neurons are directly innervated by local neurons containing gamma-aminobutyric acid, acetylcholine, enkephalin, and substance P, all of which modulate arterial pressure. The C1 area is the site of the hypotensive actions of clonidine. Clonidine appears to act on imidazole receptors in the C1 area to lower arterial pressure. The natural ligand for these receptors may be a newly defined substance in brain, clonidine-displacing substance. Neurons of the C1 area appear to be the critical neuronal group governing the normal resting and reflex control of arterial pressure. They may play a critical role in the maintenance of elevated arterial pressure in hypertension and as a site of action of antihypertensive drugs.\r"

  ".W": "We conducted extensive histological examination of the tissues that were adjacent to the prosthesis in nine hips that had a failed total arthroplasty. The prostheses were composed of titanium alloy (Ti-6Al-4V) and ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene. The average time that the prosthesis had been in place in the tissue was 33.5 months (range, eleven to fifty-seven months). Seven arthroplasties were revised because of aseptic loosening and two, for infection. In eight hips cement had been used and in one (that had a porous-coated implant for fifty-two months) no cement had been utilized. Intense histiocytic and plasma-cell reaction was noted in the pseudocapsular tissue. There was copious metallic staining of the lining cells. Polyethylene debris and particles of cement with concomitant giant-cell reaction were present in five hips. Atomic absorption spectrophotometry revealed values for titanium of fifty-sic to 3700 micrograms per gram of dry tissue (average, 1047 micrograms per gram; normal, zero microgram per gram), for aluminum of 2.1 to 396 micrograms per gram (average, 115 micrograms per gram; normal, zero micrograms per gram), and for vanadium of 2.9 to 220 micrograms per gram (average, sixty-seven micrograms per gram; normal, 1.2 micrograms per gram). The highest values were found in the hip in which surgical revision was performed at fifty-seven months. The concentrations of the three elements in the soft tissues were similar to those in the metal of the prostheses. The factors to which failure was attributed were: vertical orientation of the acetabular component (five hips), poor cementing technique on the femoral side (three hips), infection (two hips), and separation of a sintered pad made of pure titanium (one hip). A femoral component that is made of titanium alloy can undergo severe wear of the surface and on the stem, where it is loose, with liberation of potentially toxic local concentrations of metal debris into the surrounding tissues. It may contribute to infection and loosening.\r"

To assess the frequency and identify the co-morbid and predisposing factors of this devastating complication, we compared demographic data for the infected and non-infected patients. Comparison of mean age, type of graft, anatomical site of the procedure, and stage of the tumor yielded no significant differences. Multiple-regression analysis of a subgroup of eighty-two patients who had a distal femoral graft showed a correlation between infection and factors that are associated with more extensive surgery (more loss of bone, soft tissue, or skin) or with multiple operations. Approximately 30 per cent of the patients who had an infected allograft had no co-morbid or predisposing factors that could be statistically correlated with an increased risk for infection. Gram-positive organisms were the most common cause of infection, with twelve infections (36 per cent) being due to Staphylococcus epidermidis. Six patients had a single gram-negative organism and nine had mixed flora. The final result in the thirty-three patients who had an infected allograft was poor compared with that of the over-all series and of the uninfected patients. Twenty-seven infected allografts (82 per cent) were considered to be failures of treatment because amputation of the limb or resection of the graft was required to control the infection.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Successful free muscle transplantation and control of the infection were achieved in all patients. The prognosis was, in general, related to the severity of the underlying osseous problems, which were categorized into types A (a tibial defect and non-union without significant segmental loss), B (a tibial defect that is more than three centimeters long and an intact fibula), and C (a tibial defect that is more than three centimeters long, involving both the tibia and the fibula). All of the six type-A patients healed without needing bone-grafting. Of the four type-B patients, all of whom had subsequent bone-grafting, reactivation of the infection occurred in two, and both ultimately had a below-the-knee amputation; the third patient had a non-union between the fibular graft and the tibia; and the fourth patient was fully weight-bearing. All of the four type-C patients also required subsequent bone-grafting; all finally healed and were able to walk with a brace. The results in the present series indicate that, in patients who have an infected tibial defect or non-union, including those that are so severe that an amputation might be considered, this method of treatment is a valid option for salvage of the limb.\r"

In 10 Garden Grade III and IV fractures the average pressure was 28 mmHg with a maximum of 65 mmHg. Most of the recorded intracapsular pressures were high enough to have caused possible vascular embarrassment, and it is suggested that early decompression of the haemarthrosis should be considered.\r"

  ".W": "A low dose of dopamine (DA; 1 microgram/kg.min for 3 h) was infused into 10 normal subjects to determine whether vasodilator prostaglandins might be involved in the vascular action of this vasoactive hormone. Although this DA dose did not alter blood pressure, pulse, or cardiac index, it significantly increased renal blood flow (RBF), as estimated by para-amino-hippurate clearance [1.40 +/- 0.10 (+/- SE) to 1.93 +/- 0.18 L/min.1.73 m2; P less than 0.02]. This increase was due to DA receptor action since it was blocked by metoclopramide, a DA antagonist, and was not altered by prazosin, an alpha-adrenergic antagonist. DA simultaneously increased the urinary excretion rate of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha, a stable metabolite of prostacyclin [PGI2; 79 +/- 16 to 154 +/- 32 ng/g creatinine (2 +/- 0.40 to 3.88 +/- 0.78 pmol/mumol creatinine); P less than 0.02], but there was no change in PGE2 excretion. This dose of DA increased urinary Na+ and K+ excretion and slightly increased creatinine clearance from 0.12 +/- 0.01 to 0.16 +/- 0.02 L/min.1.73 m2 (P less than 0.05). Metoclopramide also blocked the increase in PGI2 excretion, indicating that this increase was due to DA. The relationship between RBF and PGI2 was supported by studies in which either indomethacin or ibuprofen, both cyclooxygenase inhibitors, blocked the increase in both RBF and PGI2 excretion rate. Since some DA actions may be mediated through calcium flux, we also administered nifedipine, a calcium channel-blocking drug, and found that the DA effect on RBF and PGI2 was significantly reduced. These studies suggest that the DA effect on RBF is mediated by calcium flux, which probably activates renal vascular phospholipase, leading to release of arachidonic acid and synthesis of PGI2, a potent vasodilator.\r"

  ".W": "To clarify the role of insulin receptors in the macrosomia and the tendency to hypoglycemia in infants of mothers with insulin-treated diabetes mellitus (IDM) we studied insulin binding in erythrocytes from mixed umbilical blood and from peripheral venous blood collected when the infants were 3-14 days old. Normal infants were matched for gestational and postnatal age. The IDM infants were macrosomic, with significantly higher birth weights relative to gestational age than the control infants. Plasma free insulin concentrations in cord blood were 15-fold higher in the IDM than in the normal infants and more than 3-fold higher in the peripheral venous blood at the median age of 4 days. Hypoglycemia occurred in 12 of the 17 IDM and in none of the normal infants. In umbilical blood insulin binding to erythrocytes was similar in the IDM and normal infants. In both groups insulin binding decreased during the first postnatal weeks, but the decrease was significantly greater in the IDM than in the normal infants. The decrease in insulin binding to erythrocytes was a consequence of decreased receptor affinity as well as decreased receptor concentration in the IDM infants, but was mainly due to decreased receptor concentration in the normal infants. We conclude that insulin binding to its erythrocyte receptor in cord blood in IDM infants is similar to that in normal infants in spite of the simultaneous gross hyperinsulinemia in the IDM infants. The resulting increase in insulin action would then contribute to the tendency toward hypoglycemia and may be partly responsible for the macrosomia in IDM infants. The marked postnatal decrease in insulin binding in IDM infants is a possible explanation for their diminishing risk of hypoglycemia after the first few days of life in spite of persisting hyperinsulinemia.\r"

Urinary GH excretion varied widely, but was significantly higher (P less than 0.01) in patients with renal insufficiency (median, 339; range, 2-17,000 ng/day) than in normal subjects (5.4; 1.2-15 ng/day). Urinary GH excretion correlated positively with urinary beta 2-microglobulin excretion (r = 0.79; P less than 0.001) and negatively with creatinine clearance (r = -0.83; P less than 0.001). Gel chromatography of urine from patients with renal insufficiency revealed a major peak of urinary GH corresponding to a mol wt of 22K, that of pituitary GH. These findings suggest that the kidneys play an important role in the catabolism of GH and that urinary GH may reflect, at least in part, renal function as well as hypothalamo-pituitary function.\r"

The plasma glucose responses during 75-g oral glucose tolerance tests were not altered by the OCA, but the 3- and 6-month plasma insulin responses significantly exceeded control values (P less than 0.05). On a separate morning a constant iv infusion of [3H]3-glucose was given throughout a 2-h basal period and during two successive 2-h euglycemic clamp procedures at iv insulin delivery rates of 10 and 40 mU/m2.min, respectively. Endogenous glucose production rates (milligrams per kg/min) were not altered after 3 or 6 months of OCA administration. Peripheral glucose utilization rates were expressed as M (milligrams per kg/min) or the ratio of M over the prevailing plasma insulin concentration (M/I). One or both parameters were significantly reduced below control values at both insulin infusion rates after 3 months (P less than 0.05), but returned toward control values after 6 months. Serum androgen concentrations were reduced or not altered by OCA administration. We conclude that insulin resistance induced by OCA administration is manifested by reduced peripheral tissue insulin sensitivity and may ameliorate with time. This effect does not relate consistently to total plasma insulin responses during oral glucose tolerance tests or to elevated serum androgen concentrations.\r"

He had received hCG for 6 months when he was 8 yr old, from age 18-21 yr and from age 21-25 yr, when the resistance developed. Anti-hCG antibodies were found in his serum. Three sequential treatment regimens were tried to obviate the effect of these antibodies. 1) hCG treatment (2000 IU, three times per week) concomitant with weekly plasmapheresis (since the patient's response to an hCG challenge test was improved after a reduction of antibody titer by plasmapheresis) resulted in only a temporary increase in testosterone production. 2) Treatment with human (h) LH (400 IU/week) and hFSH (25 IU/week) was used because of the low cross-reaction of the antibodies with hLH and a response to a hLH-challenge test. This treatment maintained serum testosterone levels within the normal range for long periods, but had to be discontinued when the supply of hLH was exhausted. 3) Pulsatile LHRH administration (25 ng/kg, sc, every 2 h) for 2 months did not induce the release of pituitary gonadotropins. These results indicated that 1) conventional hCG treatment was impaired by antibody-induced changes in the kinetics of hCG after its im administration; 2) hLH was an effective substitute for hCG, and the combined hLH-hFSH administration initiated a moderate amount of spermatogenesis; and 3) the patient differs from most individuals with hypogonadotropin hypogonadism in that he did not have normal responses to repetitive LHRH administration.\r"

The occurrence of waxy, purpuric mucocutaneous lesions provides a crucial early pointer to underlying occult plasma cell dyscrasia; the combination of the symptoms of the carpal tunnel syndrome, macroglossia, and specific mucocutaneous lesions is highly characteristic. Although secondary systemic (reactive) amyloidosis rarely gives rise to clinically evident cutaneous lesions, it may be etiologically related to a number of chronic dermatoses. Lesions of nodular primary localized cutaneous amyloidosis are indistinguishable from those of primary and myeloma-associated systemic amyloidosis, and they result from local plasma cell infiltration. Macular and papular (lichen amyloidosus) variants of primary localized cutaneous amyloidosis may have a familial or racial basis and are characterized by a tendency for keratinocytes to undergo filamentous degeneration and apoptosis. The prognosis of patients with plasma cell dyscrasia-related systemic amyloidosis remains poor, since there is little response to therapy with cytotoxic agents, colchicine, or dimethylsulfoxide. Colchicine is the drug of choice in the prevention and treatment of the renal amyloidosis associated with familial Mediterranean fever, and dimethylsulfoxide may be useful in the management of patients with secondary systemic amyloidosis. Macular amyloid and lichen amyloidosus generally follow a chronic course with intractable pruritus; there have been isolated reports of the beneficial effect of dermabrasion, topical dimethylsulfoxide, and therapy with the aromatic retinoid, etretinate.\r"

Relaxation and mere suggestion also affect the autonomic nervous system and the immune system and therefore may affect the course of the skin disorder. A few case studies have documented successful treatment of psoriasis with hypnosis and biofeedback. Further study of this process is needed, and the role of stress in dermatologic diseases must always be given consideration.\r"

Recurrences over many years are common. Light microscopy is characteristic for the disease, with diffuse tissue eosinophilia and marked edema, fibrinoid \"flame figures,\" and palisading microgranuloma. Vasculitis is never found. Eosinophilia of the peripheral blood is a frequent feature. Etiology and pathogenesis are unknown, but the disease has been found to be associated with hematologic disorders in several cases, and recurrences can often be related to infections, arthropod bites, drug administration, or surgery. The diagnosis of Wells' syndrome should be based on the typical clinical picture and the course of the disease with its recurrences and histopathology. Flame figures in histologic sections are an important diagnostic feature but not diagnostic per se for the disease because they represent a reaction pattern that can occur in other conditions. A dilution of Wells' syndrome by making flame figures the central criterion of diagnosis and by lumping all flame figure-positive skin reactions together is therefore unjustified.\r"

The patients do not have lesions of amyloidosis on other parts of the body and no known insult precedes the appearance of lesions. This entity appears to have been described previously as collagenous papules of the ear. Histochemical and electron microscopic methods allow us to confirm the amyloid nature of the substance. We believe this condition to be a variant of primary cutaneous amyloidosis, particularly because monoclonal antikeratin antibody EKH4, which has been positive in lichenoid, macular, and skin epithelial tumor-associated amyloidoses, was positive in our cases.\r"

  ".W": "Skin vessel reactivity was studied by means of an iontophoretic technique in 19 adult patients with atopic dermatitis. Fifteen patients were available for reinvestigation some 6 months later in winter. Compared with a control group, we found a significantly increased sensitivity in summer of dermal skin vessels toward the alpha 1-agonist phenylephrine. Patients with elevated serum IgE levels seemed to be more sensitive to phenylephrine. However, the difference was not significant. Isoproterenol, the beta-adrenoceptor agonist, induced blanching (as opposed to erythema) in 7 of 19 (37%) atopic dermatitis patients in summer and in 9 of 15 (60%) in winter compared with 1 of 36 in the control groups. This blanching was antagonized by the alpha-blocker phentolamine. From the results we concluded that there may be an increased alpha-adrenoceptor reactivity and/or a decreased beta-adrenoceptor reactivity in atopic dermatitis patients, which might be a primary defect.\r"

The psychologic treatment combined behavioral and cognitive interventions with relaxation training. Patients used multiple self-rating sheets to provide feedback with the goal of increasing their skills in the management of scratching behaviors. At the end of treatment all ten patients showed significant reduction in targeted symptoms.\r"

The toxic oil syndrome occurred in Madrid, Spain, as a consequence of ingestion of an industrial oil sold as olive oil. The syndrome occurred in two phases. In the acute phase patients developed an interstitial pneumonitis, fever, and exanthem, and some died of respiratory insufficiency. Of those who survived, some developed a chronic phase with a neuromyopathic and scleroderma-like illness that had many features of a collagen vascular disease. Histologic examination of lung in the acute phase showed an endovasculitis and features of adult respiratory distress syndrome. In the chronic phase the skin showed various degrees of sclerodermoid changes and vessel injury. Immunofluorescence with antiprocollagen and antifibronectin antibodies revealed abundant perivascular fluorescence suggestive of vascular injury. Electron microscopy corroborated this by the presence of endothelial swelling and basal lamina reduplication. Similar findings have been described in systemic sclerosis, and this provides an important model for study of connective tissue disease, including scleroderma.\r"

  ".W": "In a previous study we evaluated a microcrystalline preparation of 5-methoxypsoralen (5-MOP; Bergapten) for its photochemotherapeutic properties. Preliminary data indicated that the clinical efficacy of 5-MOP is comparable to that of 8-methoxypsoralen. 5-MOP appeared as a promising alternative photosensitizer for the management of psoriasis because of the almost complete lack of phototoxic and drug intolerance reactions that are frequently encountered in patients undergoing 8-MOP photochemotherapy. With a new liquid preparation of 5-MOP we have now extended our earlier investigation on a larger clinical scale and have correlated the clinical response with the bioavailability of the drug. Serum level determinations showed an absorption rate of only approximately 25% that of 8-MOP. When administered in the same dosage as 8-MOP, 5-MOP turned out to be significantly less effective; however, by doubling the oral dosage, comparable results in terms of clearing of psoriasis were obtained. Also with this high-dose 5-MOP regimen, no drug intolerance was noted and other side effects, such as severe erythema, pruritus, and nausea, occurred only rarely. We propose 5-MOP as a valuable alternative for photochemotherapy (PUVA) of PUVA-responsive diseases.\r"

  ".W": "Kathon CG, a cosmetics preservative containing, as active ingredients, 5-chloro-2-methyl-4-isothiazolin-3-one and 2-methyl-4-isothiazolin-3-one, appears to be a frequent cause of contact dermatitis in Europe. In the United States, where Kathon CG was introduced some 5 years later, the use of this preservative system for cosmetics and toiletries is rapidly increasing. Undoubtedly cases of contact sensitization will soon emerge in this country. Most cases of contact allergy are caused by the use of moisturizing creams on (slightly) damaged skin. Sensitization by the use of cosmetic products on previously healthy skin, especially the face, does occur but appears to be less frequent. Rinse-off products do not seem to have a substantial potential for the induction and elicitation of contact allergic reactions to Kathon CG because of dilution of the product and the allergen with water as well as a short contact time with the skin. This review provides a synopsis of current knowledge on the preservative system Kathon CG, with emphasis on the risk of sensitization and diagnostic procedures.\r"

A simple method of safe identification of the periosteum is described along with the description of an elevator which assists in rapid, safe, and extensive undermining in the galeal-periosteal plane. An accessory supra-auricular scalp incision can be employed to allow for extensive scalp undermining. A transverse incision into the skin flap to be advanced, allows the surgeon to safely approximate the amount of skin to be excised. When skin closure becomes impossible due to overzealous excision of bald skin, galeotomies can provide closure. A special order suture is described which allows for easier galeal closure. Surgical skin staples are recommended to provide a faster skin closure.\r"

No significant difference was observed between ketotifen treatment and placebo treatment in any of the study parameters that were tested. A decrease in concomitant medication usage during the first treatment period with ketotifen was observed. The principle side effect of ketotifen therapy observed in this age group was weight gain. In contrast to studies in adults, no sedation was noted.\r"

By immunofluorescent antibody and ELISA techniques, this antigen was demonstrated to be present on the germling surface, although it was also detected in supernatants of conidia/germlings within 1 hour and was present in all shake and stationary culture-filtrate extracts. By incorporation of a monospecific antiserum to this component in an intermediate gel of the reference self-crossed radioimmunoelectrophoresis pattern for allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis sera, it was recognized as Ag 5 and was also demonstrated to bind specific IgE. Further immunochemical analyses have revealed that Ag 5 is relatively heat labile, does not bind to concanavalin A, and has a molecular weight of approximately 35 kd. This rapidly released antigenic/allergenic component may play an important role in the initiation of immunologic responses in patients with allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis.\r"

Stratification was based on prick skin test sensitivity and severity of signs and symptoms of previous RAR. NS (1% solution) in a dose of 0.13 ml of nasal spray was administered to each nostril, a minimum twice daily. Concomitant medications were limited to ingested terfenadine, ocular cromolyn, and inhaled medications. Symptoms and medications were noted daily. Active-treatment and placebo-treatment groups were comparable. There were less symptoms of runny nose and itchy eyes in the active-treatment group (p less than 0.05) and also less antihistamine, p less than 0.004. Patients in the active-treatment group were more likely to conclude that symptoms were improved by the nasal spray (p less than 0.01). No side effects were reported. This study indicates that NS is effective and well tolerated in RAR.\r"

A safe and adequate range of intake was established in 1980 for copper and five other trace elements. The range for copper, 2 to 3 mg/day, is higher than the usual dietary copper intake of many individuals in this country. On the basis of balance studies, a requirement of 1.3 mg/day has been suggested. Recent data on copper intake and bioavailability should aid in reevaluating the dietary copper requirement. Copper deficiency symptoms have seldom been observed in human beings. When copper deficiency has been recognized, it has been under unusual conditions, such as in patients receiving parenteral nutrition. Interactions between copper and other dietary components may alter copper status, but the impact of those interactions is not yet well understood. Dietary factors that may affect the bioavailability of copper include the levels of copper, zinc, and molybdenum in the diet; iron deficiency; ascorbic acid intake; intake of carbohydrates, including fructose, glucose, and starch; and fiber and phytate intakes. Some drugs may also affect copper bioavailability.\r"

  ".W": "To document the incidence and management of breast feeding among women with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), 30 IDDM mothers and 30 controls were followed from birth of their infants to 6 weeks postpartum. The researchers interviewed the mothers in the hospital and by telephone at 1, 2, and 6 weeks postpartum. Fifty-three percent of the IDDM women and 57% of the general hospital population intended to breast feed. Because of the need for neonatal observation for hypoglycemia, most IDDM mothers were separated from their infants for the first 2 days. After 1 week, as many IDDM mothers as controls nursed. Initially, no differences in breast-feeding problems were found between the groups, but between 2 and 6 weeks postpartum, two IDDM nursing mothers but none of the controls experienced clinically diagnosed mastitis. A daily diet prescription of 31 kcal per kilogram of maternal body weight was associated with IDDM mothers' ability to sustain lactation, in contrast with 25 kcal per kilogram of maternal weight for IDDM mothers who stopped nursing. Six-week postpartum fasting plasma glucose levels of IDDM mothers who exclusively breast fed were significantly lower (4.6 +/- 2.2 mmol/L [82 +/- 40 mg/dl]) than the glucose levels of the women who stopped nursing (8.1 +/- 2.1 mmol/L [145 +/- 37 mg/dl]) or the glucose levels of the IDDM mothers who chose to bottle feed (6.7 +/- 1.7 mmol/L [120 +/- 30 mg/dl]). It appears that adequate maternal calories, blood sugar control, early breast stimulation, and mastitis monitoring are necessary for optimal lactation outcome in insulin-dependent diabetic women.\r"

One group, the experimental group, received the treatment of life review process; another, the control group, received a friendly visit; and the third, the no-treatment group, received pretests and posttests only. Two dependent variables, life satisfaction, as operationalized by the Life Satisfaction Index A (LSIA), and psychological well-being, as operationalized by the Affect-Balance Scale (ABS), were significant in the experimental group when tested statistically through analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). These results suggest that a structured process of life review can serve as a therapeutic intervention for homebound elderly persons.\r"

  ".W": "In the present study a unique antibody (NKI-L16) reacting with the alpha-chain of the human leukocyte function-associated Ag-1 (LFA-1) is described, which stimulates homotypic cell-cell interactions in a manner very similar to 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA), in contrast to other anti-LFA-1 mAb which inhibit cell aggregation. The induction of aggregate formation of EBV-transformed B cells (JY) and CTL clones by TPA or NKI-L16 is not accompanied by an increase in the expression of LFA-1. Nevertheless, this cluster formation is LFA-1 dependent, inasmuch as anti-LFA-1 antibodies, other than NKI-L16, completely abrogate aggregation. Simultaneous addition of NKI-L16 and TPA did not result in a further increase of the speed of cluster formation, suggesting that a similar pathway is activated. Immunoprecipitation and enzyme digestion studies revealed that NKI-L16 recognizes a unique epitope on the alpha-chain of LFA-1, most likely situated close to the transmembrane segment of the molecule. It is hypothesized that NKI-L16 or TPA can cause the LFA-1 molecule to convert from an inactive to an active configuration, thereby permitting binding of LFA-1 to its natural ligand.\r"

Addition of GM-CSF to the culture medium leads to the production of adherent and nonadherent cells of the macrophage-monocyte lineage. L3T4-Lyt2- cells poorly respond to IL-2 in vitro, but the addition of either rIL-3 or rGM-CSF allows the IL-2 response of L3T4-Lyt2- cells.

The work described here indicates that they represent maturation stages within the same differentiation pathway. Purified populations of CD4+ or CD8+ T cells, after stimulation with PHA, lose cell surface expression of CD45R (Lp220) and gain an increased surface density of CDw29 (4B4). Clonal analysis demonstrated that individual CD4+ CD45R+ T cells lost CD45R and acquired CDw29 with time in culture. This effect was selective for the high Mr 220-kDa form of the T200 (CD45) complex because the density of CD45, detected by an antibody to common determinants, did not decrease. This strongly indicates that CD45R+ cells are an immature stage in a lineage that culminates in CDw29 expression. To further define the expression of CD45R and CDw29, we analyzed infant thymus cells. Thymocytes include only 4 to 6% CD45R+ cells, but 95% express CDw29 in moderate density. The CD45R+ set appears to include mainly single CD4+ or CD8+, CD3 \"bright\" medullary cells, although only 15 to 25% of thymocytes with medullary phenotype express CD45R. In vitro culture of thymocytes with Con A and T cell growth factor induces expression of CD45R but these cells differ from the peripheral CD45R+ set by virtue of their co-expression of a high density of CDw29 (4B4) Ag. We postulate that post-thymically CD45R (Lp200) and CDw29 (4B4) comprise a functional assembly on the surface of T cells that changes in composition after stimulation with Ag or mitogen. This may result in enhanced ability of an Ag-experienced T cell to respond effectively to Ag due perhaps to a more efficient signaling complex.\r"

A surprisingly high proportion (27%) of Ly-2-L3T4- thymocytes were strongly F23.1 and KJ16 positive. No positive cells were detected among Ly-2-L3T4- thymocytes from V beta 8-negative SJL mice. In contrast to the adult thymus, Ly-2-L3T4- cells from embryonic CBA thymus lacked F23.1-positive cells. Subsets of adult CBA Ly-2-L3T4- thymocytes were separated to determine which expressed V beta 8. The major subset, Ly-1 low B2A2-M1/69+Thy-1+Pgp-1-, representing a phenotype similar to embryonic Ly-2-L3T4- thymocytes and the phenotype commonly isolated from adult thymocytes as Ly-1 \"dull,\" lacked cells strongly positive for F23.1. In contrast, a series of subsets of adult CBA Ly-2-L3T4- thymocytes which were B2A2-M1/69- and Pgp-1+ all included strongly F23.1-positive cells. A minor subset, negative for most markers except Pgp-1 and presumed on the basis of this phenotype and some reconstitution studies to include the earliest intrathymic precursors, contained 28% F23.1-positive cells. However, no F.23.1-positive cells were detected in equivalent \"prethymic\" populations from bone marrow or from athymic mouse spleen. The subsets of Ly-2-L3T4- thymocytes which were Ly-1 high, B2A2-M1/69-, and Pgp-1+ all contained about 70% F23.1-positive cells, indicating a V beta 8 usage much higher than the mature T cell average. These results indicate that a series of distinct developmental events have occurred within these CD4-CD8- thymocytes previously considered as a single group of early precursor cells, and that some aspects of repertoire selection may be occurring amongst thymocytes which lack CD4 or CD8.\r"

Center cells were examined by indirect immunofluorescence staining with mouse mAb against either of the two IgA subclasses as primary antibodies and FITC-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse Ig as the second antibody. Blood lymphocytes spontaneously secreting IgA (mean 399/10(6) mononuclear cells) produced mainly IgA1 (73%). A similar distribution of subclasses was recorded among IgA-secreting blood cells in PWM- and EBV-stimulated cultures. In contrast, a predominance of IgA2 (54%) was found among IgA-secreting cells (2531/10(6)) isolated from the blood 7 days after in vivo stimulation with pneumococcal polysaccharides, and a similar proportion (51%) of IgA2 producing cells was found among IgA anti-pneumococcal polysaccharide-secreting cells. It was thus confirmed that IgA1 is the predominant subclass of blood IgA-secreting cells in general. However, the high percentage of IgA2-secreting cells found after vaccination with pneumococcal polysaccharides suggests that these Ag have an unusually high ability to activate IgA2 B cells, or that the B cells stimulated originate from lymphatic tissues with a high frequency of IgA2 committed cells.\r"

  ".U": "88154440\r", 
  ".W": "Many recent studies have established the eosinophil as a primary effector cell in the pathology of allergic diseases. However, relatively little is known about the mechanisms by which eosinophils accumulate and are activated at local sites of tissue inflammation in allergic or other eosinophil-dependent pathologic states. Because the adherence of leukocytes to vascular endothelial cells (VEC) is a critical initial event in eosinophil infiltration, we have studied the interaction of purified human eosinophils with cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Treatment of VEC with stimuli known to activate endothelial cells, including purified human IL-1, rTNF-alpha, bacterial endotoxin LPS, and the tumor-promoting phorbol diester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate resulted in time- and dose-dependent increases (from two- to fourfold) in adhesiveness for eosinophils. Adherence induced by optimal concentrations of IL-1 (2 U/ml), TNF (1 micrograms/ml), and LPS (1 microgram/ml) is dependent upon the CD18 leukocyte cell surface adherence glycoproteins, because a mAb (60.3) directed against the common beta-subunit of the complex inhibits adherence induced by these stimuli. Several agents directly activated eosinophils to display increased adhesiveness to both VEC and gelatinized plates. The bacterial chemotactic peptide formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (10(-8) to 10(-6) M), TNF (1 to 1000 ng/ml), and 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (0.3 to 3 ng/ml) all increased eosinophil binding to VEC by two to fivefold. Platelet-activating factor (PAF; 10(-8) to 10(-6) M), but not lyso-PAF, caused approximately a twofold increase in eosinophil binding to both VEC and gelatinized tissue culture plates, suggesting that activation of eosinophils may be responsible for the known ability of PAF to induce eosinophilic responses. These results suggest that the initiation of an eosinophilic infiltrate in vivo can result from activation of endothelial cells, activation of eosinophils, or activation of both cell types.\r"

Detailed analysis of FcR surface expression is provided for the U937 cell line after exposure to CSF and cytokines. Increased expression of FcRI and FcRII occurred at 72 h in cells exposed to GCT or Mo cell line-conditioned medium as well as to medium from PHA-treated mononuclear cells. The augmentation of FcRII required protein synthesis and was diminished by a neutralizing antibody to granulocyte-macrophage CSF. We also show that fractions containing natural granulocyte CSF or granulocyte-macrophage CSF as well as r-granulocyte and r-granulocyte-macrophage CSF are capable of inducing FcRII on these cells, whereas other cytokines such as IL-1 and IL-2, TNF-alpha, INF-gamma and macrophages CSF failed to do so.\r"

  ".W": "Supernatants of mitogen-stimulated human leukocytes contain two biologically related cytokines, IL-1 and hybridoma growth factor (HGF). IL-1 beta is a potent inducer of HGF in fibroblasts but has little stimulating effect on monocytes that spontaneously produce HGF. Leukocyte-derived HGF and IL-1 were separated by the use of affinity chromatography on specific antibodies and discriminating assay systems for both cytokines. They had different Mr upon gel filtration and SDS-PAGE. In contrast to IL-1 beta, HGF showed heterogeneity on a cation-exchange column. IL-1 beta and HGF were purified to homogeneity by a sequence of four and five purification steps, respectively. Leukocyte-derived HGF was characterized by analysis of its NH2-terminal amino acid sequence. This revealed complete homology with fibroblast-derived HGF, 26-kDa protein, IFN-beta 2, and B cell stimulatory factor 2, molecules which have collectively been designated as IL-6. IL-1 beta exerted an antiviral and growth-promoting effect of fibroblasts, whereas HGF/IL-6 did not. Both IL-1 and IL-6 possessed lymphocyte-activating factor activity, which could be neutralized only by an anti-serum against the corresponding cytokine.\r"

  ".W": "Highly purified peripheral blood monocytes were cultured in the presence of rIL-4. Major changes in the morphology of the monocytes were observed. After day 5 of culturing the cells acquired a macrophage-like appearance, with increased cell size and extensive processes, suggesting that IL-4 may induce monocyte-macrophage differentiation. This notion is supported by the observed increased expression of MHC class II Ag, which is thought to be associated with monocyte differentiation. Exposure of monocytes to IL-4 resulted in a dose-dependent increase of the expression of MHC class II Ag, which became apparent after only 20 h of incubation. Maximal expression was obtained after incubation for 6 days, and persisted throughout the whole culture period. Similarly, IL-4 increased the expression of R for C3bi and p150.95 Ag, two members of the leukocyte function-associated Ag 1 family, whereas the expression of the third member, leukocyte function-associated Ag 1, remained unchanged during culture. Furthermore, it was shown that IL-4 inhibited the secretion of cytostatic and chemotactic compounds. Supernatants of monocytes cultured with IL-4 were, in contrast to control cultures, much less effective in inhibiting the growth of A375 melanoma cells. In addition, these supernatants failed to direct the migration of freshly isolated monocytes in a chemotaxis assay. Further analysis revealed that these supernatants exhibited reduced IL-1 activity, as measured in a mouse thymocyte proliferation assay, which might explain the low cytostatic and chemotactic activity. Taken together these results show that IL-4 modulates monocyte phenotype and function and may induce monocyte-macrophage differentiation in vitro.\r"

  ".W": "A protein termed IFN-beta 2, originally described on the basis of antiviral activity and antigenic cross-reactivity with the classical IFN-beta, is now known to be identical with the independently isolated B cell stimulatory factor (BSF-2). Earlier it was suggested that IFN-beta 2 (i.e., BSF-2) mediates the antiviral action of TNF in human fibroblasts. We examined Escherichia coli-derived recombinant preparations of human IFN-beta and BSF-2 for antiviral activity and plasmacytoma growth factor (PCT-GF) activity. IFN-beta had antiviral activity but showed no PCT-GF activity. BSF-2 showed potent PCT-GF activity but lacked antiviral activity. Antiviral activity of IFN-beta was neutralized by polyclonal antibodies and mAb to IFN-beta, but not by antibody to rBSF-2. PCT-GF activity of BSF-2 was neutralized by antibody to rBSF-2, but not by antibodies neutralizing the antiviral action of IFN-beta. Five mAb and a polyclonal antibody to human IFN-beta failed to react with BSF-2 in a solid phase RIA and antibody to BSF-2 did not react with IFN-beta. PCT-GF activity in supernatants of human FS-4 fibroblasts stimulated with TNF, IL-1 or poly(I).poly(C) was neutralized by antibody to rBSF-2, but not by antibodies neutralizing the antiviral activity of IFN-beta. Finally, the antiviral activity of TNF in FS-4 cultures was neutralized by antibodies to IFN-beta but not by antibodies to BSF-2. Taken together, these results support the view that the antiviral action of TNF in human fibroblasts is mediated by IFN-beta, and not by BSF-2/IFN-beta 2 that apparently lacks significant antiviral activity.\r"

After analyzing this sequence for highly conserved segments within the C3 from other species (which bind P) and segments of low similarity within human C4, mouse C5, and alpha 2-macroglobulin (which do not bind P), a 34-amino acid (1402 to 1435) peptide was synthesized. This synthetic peptide bound to P and inhibited its binding to C3b. In addition, it exhibited negative regulatory activity on the alternative pathway as it inhibited the lysis of rabbit erythrocytes by normal human serum.

  ".W": "A single injection of viable Salmonella typhimurium SL3235, an avirulent organism blocked in the aromatic pathway, induced the generation of activated peritoneal macrophages in three different C3H mouse strains, including macrophage-defective C3H/HeJ mice. Macrophages obtained from immunized mice were cytotoxic for B16 melanoma cells, P815 mastocytoma cells, and TU-5 fibrosarcoma cells and microbicidal in vitro for the obligate, intracellular, protozoan parasite Leishmania major. The capacity of live SL3235 to activate C3H/HeJ macrophages contrasts with the failure of live Bacillus Calmette-Guerin to induce activated macrophages in this mouse strain. Although viable SL3235 were capable of fully activating cells of both normal and defective mice, a dose-dependent difference was observed in the number of organisms necessary for induction of tumoricidal macrophages in C3HeB/FeJ (normal) and C3H/HeJ (defective) animals. As few as 80 viable SL3235 were capable of activating C3HeB/FeJ macrophages whereas 5 X 10(4) organisms were required to activate C3H/HeJ macrophages. Maximal macrophage activation occurred 7 to 10 days after SL3235 inoculation in C3H/HeJ and C3HeB/FeJ mice. Acetone-killed cells of SL3235 had some but not all of the activity of the living Salmonella. A single in vivo injection of the nonviable preparation resulted in the induction of tumoricidal macrophages in C3HeB/FeJ but not in C3H/HeJ mice, even when tested over a wide dosage range. Injection of acetone-killed cells of SL3235 did, however, result in a population of primed macrophages in C3H/HeJ mice, as explanted cells could be induced to express activated macrophage effector activities after additional treatment in vitro with either LPS or IFN-gamma. Thus, in vivo administration of viable SL3235 is, by itself, capable of eliciting the full series of steps required for activation of C3H/HeJ macrophages, whereas killed SL3235 only provides signals sufficient to prime these defective macrophages for further activation in vitro.

The clones were derived from CD3+ and CD3- human PBL. After expansion in rIL-2, all clones were able to lyse the NK-sensitive target cell line K562. In contrast, lysis of fresh tumor cells was achieved almost exclusively by CD3- clones. To test whether a known TCR-CD3 complex may be involved in MHC-unrestricted cytotoxicity, total RNA from nine CD3+ and 11 CD3- clones was isolated and hybridized with DNA probes for the TCR alpha-, beta-, and gamma-chains and for the CD3 gamma-, delta-, and epsilon-chains. TCR gamma transcripts were present at high levels in CD3+CD4- CD8- clones but were undetectable in all CD3- clones. Lysis of fresh tumor cells is an activity which can be independent of the TCR alpha beta and TCR gamma complexes because the CD3- clones did not express these TCR genes. Interestingly, all CD3- clones expressed CD3 epsilon transcripts, but not CD3 gamma- or delta-transcripts. CD3- lymphokine-activated cytotoxic cells may therefore be derived from immature T cells which do not yet express a complete CD3 complex. The CD3 epsilon chain, if expressed in CD3- cells in association with other molecules, could be involved in the activation and lytic function of these MHC-unrestricted cytotoxic cells.\r"

  ".W": "A major sequela of immunotherapy with interleukin 2 (IL-2) is development of a vascular leak syndrome. The pathogenesis of this toxic effect is not known. We have examined pre- and post-treatment skin biopsies from 14 patients undergoing systemic administration of IL-2 for evidence of endothelial cell activation. Specifically, we have used the immunoperoxidase technique to detect the expression of three different activation antigens: endothelial-leukocyte adhesion molecule 1, detected with monoclonal antibody H4/18; intercellular adhesion molecule 1, detected with antibody RR1/1; and histocompatibility leukocyte antigen-DQ, detected with antibody Leu 10. Each of these antigens may be induced on cultured endothelial cells by various cytokines (although not by IL-2) and is expressed during endothelial cell activation in vivo at sites of delayed hypersensitivity and other immune responses. Pretreatment biopsies from each patient showed no endothelial expression of endothelial-leukocyte adhesion molecule 1 and only weak to moderate expression of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 and histocompatibility leukocyte antigen-DQ (except for one specimen unreactive with Leu 10). After 5 days of treatment, every patient showed marked endothelial expression of all three antigens (except for the same patient who remained unreactive with Leu 10). Endothelial-leukocyte adhesion molecule-1 expression was confined to postcapillary venular endothelium whereas intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and Leu 10 also were expressed on stromal cells and mononuclear cells. Thus, we conclude that i.v. administration of IL-2 leads to endothelial cell activation. Because IL-2 fails to induce the same antigens on cultured endothelial cells, we infer that IL-2 acts in vivo by inducing the production of other cytokines (e.g., interleukin 1, tumor necrosis factor, lymphotoxin, and interferon-gamma). Finally, since endothelial cell activation at sites of cell-mediated immune responses is well known to result in vascular leakiness to macromolecules, we propose that the vascular leak syndrome accompanying IL-2 therapy may arise from widespread inappropriate endothelial cell activation.\r"

From 18 to 24 h after s.c. administration of GM-CSF to normal mice, the resident peritoneal macrophages were harvested and the levels of membrane-bound IL-1, FcR, Mac-1 cell-surface Ag, and class II MHC expression were assessed. Peritoneal cells from GM-CSF-inoculated mice had significantly greater levels of membrane-bound IL-1 than did control mice. In addition when resident peritoneal macrophages from normal mice were purified by adherence and grown in the presence of GM-CSF, they produced greater levels of both membrane-bound and secreted IL-1. The peritoneal cells from GM-CSF-inoculated mice did not differ from controls in the expression of class II MHC-encoded Ag. This observation was confirmed by the finding that GM-CSF was unable to induce class II MHC expression on P388D1 cells, whereas a secondary mixed leukocyte culture supernatant was. Peritoneal cells from GM-CSF-inoculated mice also exhibited greater levels of expression of FcR and the Mac-1 cell-surface Ag. This resulted in an increase in their ability to phagocytose opsonized SRBC in vitro.\r"

  ".W": "Phosphodiesteric cleavage of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns-4,5-P2) is required for transmembrane signaling by chemoattractants in human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN). Considering the importance of PtdIns-4,5-P2 as a reservoir for second messenger substances, we have characterized the enzyme system that synthesizes this phospholipid in human PMN, consisting of kinases for phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) and phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate (PtdIns-4-P). The preferred phosphate donor for both enzymes was ATP as compared with GTP. The respective Km for ATP for PtdIns kinase and PtdIns-P kinase were 0.049 +/- 0.013 and 0.062 +/- 0.005 mM and for GTP were 0.242 +/- 0.016 and 0.186 +/- 0.037 mM. PtdIns stimulated the activity of PtdIns kinase to a greater extent than PtdIns-4-P kinase. PtdIns-4-P inhibited the activity of detergent-solubilized PtdIns kinase and stimulated particulate PtdIns-4-P kinase, whereas both enzymes exhibited substrate inhibition to PtdIns-4,5-P2. Mg2+ was the preferred cation for both enzymes, but the apparent Km values (4.1 +/- 0.9 mM for PtdIns kinase and 1.0 +/- 0.7 mM for PtdIns-4-P kinase) were significantly different (p less than 0.005). Mn2+ partially substituted for Mg2+, and both enzymes were inhibited by Ca2+. The polyamine spermine stimulated PtdIns-4-P kinase activity to a greater extent and at lower concentrations than PtdIns kinase. PtdIns kinase was easily solubilized in both Triton X-100 and Nonidet P-40, whereas PtdIns-4-P kinase remained in a detergent-nonextractable membrane fraction. These findings demonstrate that the enzyme system in human PMN that forms PtdIns-4,5-P2 is composed of two distinct enzymes with similar characteristics.\r"

  ".W": "MHC-restricted, viral Ag-specific \"memory\" CTL are thought to play a decisive role in the defense against pathogenic viruses. However, the requirements for activating such CTL remain controversial. In particular, the role of CD4+ helper cells and their soluble products (e.g., IL-2) are uncertain. To approach these questions as they relate to EBV-specific CTL, highly purified CD8+ T cells from healthy EBV-seropositive individuals were cultured with autologous irradiated EBV-transformed B lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCL), in the presence or absence of autologous CD4+ cells or 1 to 10 U/ml purified rIL-2. The results indicate that the induction of CTL requires neither Th cells nor exogenous IL-2. The CTL generated from isolated CD8+ cells were HLA class I restricted as demonstrated by their ability to lyse targets sharing at least one HLA-A or -B Ag with the stimulating autologous LCL. Furthermore, a mAb (W6/32) to a common determinant on HLA class I Ag blocked both the generation and effector phases of killing, whereas an HLA class II directed mAb had no effect. Addition of an IL-2R-specific antibody (anti-Tac) to the culture medium blocked induction of CTL, suggesting that endogenously produced IL-2 plays an obligatory role in this system. Paraformaldehyde fixation of LCL abrogated their ability to function as stimulator cells; however, addition of 2 U/ml exogenous IL-2 to fixed LCL cultured with CD8+ cells allowed for the induction of highly specific CTL. These results indicate that EBV-specific memory CTL can be activated in the absence of CD4+ helper cells or their soluble products, but nonetheless require Ag and IL-2.\r"

This report represents the first characterization of a bacterial amphiphile with a chemical composition and structure as proposed here. As is the case with other bacterial amphiphiles, the nutritionally variant streptococcal serotype I amphiphile was found both intra- and extracellularly.

NK-enriched effector cells (ECc) were first treated with either K562 or Ab-coated KLCL (Ab-KLCL). After incubation, ECc were separated from their TC then examined for residual NK and ADCC activities, phenotypic changes, and changes in LGL morphology. K562-treated ECc and Ab-KLCL-treated ECc, when retested against the inactivating TC, respectively, lost greater than 90% of their lytic activities. However, K562-treated ECc lost 60 to 70% of their activity against Ab-KLCL, whereas Ab-KLCL-treated ECc lost less than 10% of their activity against K562. In contrast to what we observed with K562-treated ECc, we detected significant reductions in plasma membrane expression of Leu-11a and Leu-11b on Ab-KLCL-treated ECc. Although the proportion of OKM1+ cells remained unchanged after the inactivation process, the density of OKM1 on both K562-treated ECc and Ab-KLCL-treated ECc increased significantly. Morphologic analysis revealed no apparent differences in the percentages of LGL before and after treatment with K562 or Ab-KLCL. Finally, IL-2 restored lytic potential to both K562-treated ECc and Ab-KLCL-treated ECc and, in addition, IL-2-induced enhancement of Ab-KLCL-treated ECc was accompanied by a partial reexpression of Leu-11a. These data support the hypothesis that NK-cell-mediated cytotoxicity and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity may result from a common lytic mechanism, although the initiation steps and regulation of the pathway are distinct.\r"

Utilizing this antibody, we sought to determine whether a basement membrane chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan is present in adult, neonatal, and/or fetal skin, and if present, its ultrastructural localization. Indirect immunofluorescence was performed on human adult, neonatal, and fetal skin. To detect the antigen, specimens were pretreated with chondroitinase ABC; absence of enzyme treatment served as negative control. Chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan was detectable in linear homogeneous array along the dermoepidermal junction and within vascular (and when present, adnexal) basement membranes in both adult and neonatal skin. In fetal skin, basement membrane staining was noted as early as 54 gestational days. Indirect immunoelectron microscopy and NaCl-split skin studies were performed to ultrastructurally localize the antigen; immune deposits were detectable within the lamina densa in chondroitinase-treated skin. These findings demonstrate that chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan is present within all skin basement membranes; that it is present in the region of the lamina densa; and that similar to some other ubiquitous basement membrane antigens, it is present early in the developing fetus.\r"

Tumor promotors but not initiators, have been shown to deplete adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase)-positive LC from the skin and therefore the cutaneous immune system may be impaired during tumor promotion but not initiation. The present study shows that the tumor promotor 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA) but not the initiator urethane depletes Ia-positive LC from BALB/c murine ear epidermis, and beta-glucuronidase-positive LC from C57BL mouse tail skin. Sensitization with 2,4-dinitrofluorobenzene (DNFB) through urethane-treated skin resulted in a normal contact sensitivity response when the mice were challenged 5 days later. In contrast, tolerance resulted from sensitization through TPA-treated skin as a result of the generation of suppressor cells. In addition, TPA but not urethane-treated C57BL mouse tail skin survived for an extended time when grafted onto histoincompatible BALB/c mice. Therefore, impairment of the normal immunological functions of skin resulted from treatment with the tumor promotor TPA but not the tumor initiator urethane, which suggests that a loss of LC during tumor promotion may impair immunological protection against skin tumors.\r"

B11 antidesmosomal polyclonal antibody and AE3 antikeratin monoclonal antibody staining were used as comparative reference controls. Desmosomal antigens span the cell membrane and keratins constitute a family of cytoplasmic proteins. The cultured cells were systematically used either unfixed, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, or fixed with methanol at 4 degrees C. The former two preparations were designed to expose only the surface antigens, whereas the latter method permeated the membrane to allow cytoplasmic staining. Differences in staining patterns were observed in the basal layer as compared with the upper layers with all three antibodies. B11 antidesmosomal antibody staining was consistent in pattern after either paraformaldehyde or methanol fixation. In addition to the punctate staining along adjacent cell surfaces as shown in the basal layer, the surface planes of the upper cells exhibited parallel arrays of linear streaks, demonstrating the distribution of desmosomal proteins. Antikeratin staining by AE3 showed the typical filamentous staining in basal cells. However, a homogeneous patchy staining of suprabasal cells was observed. The presence of punctate surface staining using antikeratin antibody on paraformaldehyde fixed cells suggests leakage of keratin to the cell surface. AE11 showed stronger staining in the top cells on methanol treated cultures and a punctate surface staining of the cells fixed with paraformaldehyde. These observations provide useful preliminary information in localizing peripheral proteins in epidermal keratinocytes.\r"

  ".U": "88154583\r", 
  ".W": "Interleukin-1 (IL-1) is a monocyte-derived polypeptide with immunoregulatory and proinflammatory functions. Although monocytes are the principle source of IL-1, other cells, such as keratinocytes, endothelial cells, renal mesangial cells, and neutrophils, produce a factor with IL-1 activity. The IL-1-like polypeptide produced by keratinocytes, epidermal-derived thymocyte-activating factor (ETAF), is similar on biological, biochemical, and molecular levels to monocyte-derived IL-1. Studies of IL-1 or ETAF have for the most part been undertaken using cell culture supernatants or cell lysates, and in situ localization of ETAF has not been demonstrated. Previous studies have suggested that ETAF is involved in the pathogenesis of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL). To gain insights into the role of these cytokines in disease states, we investigated whether IL-1 could be localized in tissue sections using a direct immunofluorescence technique with a monoclonal antibody directed against IL-1. This monoclonal antibody partially inhibited ETAF activity and totally inhibited IL-1 activity in the co-stimulator assay and so could be used to detect IL-1 or ETAF. We studied skin biopsies from 10 healthy individuals, 10 patients with CTCL, and 11 patients with various inflammatory dermatoses. Intense epidermal fluorescence was demonstrated in all cases of CTCL, whereas minimal reactivity was visible in normal biopsies and the inflammatory dermatoses. Most patients with CTCL showed an intercellular pattern, while none of the normal controls or those with inflammatory dermatoses showed this pattern. An irrelevant IgM monoclonal antibody, used as a negative control, did not demonstrate epidermal staining. To further demonstrate specificity, we incubated the anti-IL-1 antibody with recombinant beta IL-1:Epidermal reactivity was completely blocked. In a separate experiment, COLO 16 cells, a squamous cell carcinoma cell line that constitutively produces ETAF, stained positively for the IL-1 antibody. We conclude that epidermal IL-1 is elevated in CTCL.\r"

  ".U": "88154585\r", 
  ".W": "It was recently discovered that murine epidermal Langerhans cells (LC) changed significantly in function and phenotype when maintained in culture. Notably, accessory cell function for primary immune responses increased while cytologic markers like ATPase, nonspecific esterase, and Birbeck granules were lost. To further analyze LC differentiation, we used flow cytometry and a panel of 22 monoclonal antibodies to quantitate changes in surface antigens at the single-cell level. A striking change was a fivefold increase in the amount of Ia antigens (which are expressed on class II MHC products) during the first day of culture. The increase was evident within 3 h and reached a plateau at 15-24 h. Both I-A and I-E products behaved similarly. The increase in Ia was blocked by 1 microgram/ml cycloheximide. Expression of other surface antigens was then monitored on Ia+ LC by two-color flow cytometry. Low levels of class I (H-2D and H-2K) MHC products were detected on freshly isolated LC, and these antigens also increased severalfold during the first day of culture. Fc receptors (identified with the 2.4G2 mAb) and the F4/80 macrophage antigen decreased, as reported previously. Three antigens that were detected in fresh suspensions were expressed at constant levels in culture. These were the C3bi receptor and the pan leukocyte and interdigitating cell antigens. Several leukocyte antigens that were not found initially on LCs did not appear, including B220 anti-B cell, 33D1 anti-dendritic cell, and CD4, CD5, CD8 T-cell specificities. We conclude that the surface of cultured LCs undergoes selective changes in culture. As a result, the cells are rich in Ia and H-2 and have detectable C3bi receptors, but have little or no LFA-1, Ti, CD4, 5, and 8, 33D1, 2.4G2, F4/80, and B220 antigens.\r"

How does it differ in HIV-infected and non-HIV-infected individuals? How is the diagnosis established? What is the sensitivity of the CSF cryptococcal antigen test? Is the serum antigen test of any value? What is the best way to treat patients--the recommended drugs, dosages, and duration of therapy?

The effect of ethanol on several other neutrophil functions required for normal delivery are examined herein. Serum-free neutrophil suspensions showed normal resting adherence to endothelial monolayers in ethanol concentrations up to 1000 mg/dL, but when neutrophils were stimulated by 10(-6)M N-formyl-L-methionyl-L-leucyl-L-phenylalanine (fMLP) to induce hyperadherence, ethanol induced a dose-dependent inhibition that was significant at concentrations greater than or equal to 500 mg/dL. Pretreating the endothelium with ethanol had no effect. Similarly, resting surface expression of the adhesive glycoprotein Mac-1 was unaffected by ethanol, but its up-regulation induced by fMLP was inhibited by 25.5% at 250 mg of ethanol/dL and by 52.3% at 1000 mg/dL. Release of both primary and secondary granule contents after activation showed dose-dependent inhibition, whereas resting granule content and spontaneous release were unaffected. Passive neutrophil deformability was significantly enhanced in 500 mg of ethanol/dL. Thus, ethanol affects several neutrophil delivery functions normally activated by inflammatory stimuli.\r"

  ".W": "Human neutrophils produce small amounts of O2- when stimulated with the chemotactic peptide F-Met-Leu-Phe; preincubating neutrophils with low concentrations of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) markedly increases this response, an effect referred to as priming. Neutrophil suspensions without mononuclear cells and platelets were insusceptible to priming by 10 ng of LPS; susceptibility was restored by reintroducing platelets, approximately five platelets per neutrophil. Incubation of platelets with 10 ng of LPS/mL released a soluble factor that produced graded priming responses of at least fivefold in neutrophils. The priming factor had the properties of a labile protein and did not resemble previously described mediators derived from platelets. Anthrax toxin, which inhibits priming of neutrophils by LPS, inhibited priming by the platelet factor but not release of the factor from platelets. Thus, the platelet factor mediates a portion of the overall priming effect of LPS and thereby modulates the level of O2- generation by neutrophils.\r"

Residual C3b was refractory to factor I cleavage, an occurrence enabling alternative pathway activation to continue. C3 deposited was quantitated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; with 50% PHS, greater than 50% and 90% of total C3 deposition occurred within 5 and 10 min, respectively. With a lower percentage of PHS, maximal deposition required up to 60 min and was not achieved in less than 10% PHS.

The adhesin was composed of a complex mix of monosaccharides (with galactose and glucosamine predominating), bound well to silastic catheter tubing, inhibited adherence of strain RP-62A to catheters, and elicited antibodies that both blocked adherence and stabilized an extracellular structure (visualized by transmission electron microscopy) that appeared to be a capsule. Two of three heterologous, highly adherent strains of coagulase-negative staphylococci also produced this adhesin, and their adherence to catheters was inhibited by both purified adhesin and antibody to adhesin. In contrast, the adherence of one highly adherent and two poorly adherent heterologous strains was unaffected by the RP-62A purified adhesin or antibody, a result suggesting the expression of alternate adhesins by these strains. We conclude that the capsular polysaccharide of some strains of coagulase-negative staphylococci is an important factor in adherence to catheter tubing.\r"

Various colony phenotypes of the HBSN strain were compared in virulence studies by using the rat model of endocarditis. The infectivity rate of the small-colony variant forms was significantly less than that of either the normal parent form (P less than .05) or the mixed phenotypic inoculum (P less than .05). These data indicate that the small-colony variant forms may be selected for, once endocardial infections are established, and that the small-colony variant forms alone are much less able to initiate and/or sustain intracardiac infections in experimental endocarditis.\r"

Among the patients with Lyme disease, both IgM and IgG antibodies most commonly bound to the 41-kilodalton (kDa) flagellar antigen, but many patients had binding to other components, particularly those of 25, 55, 58, or 66 kDa, and the order of their appearance was variable. Compared with indirect ELISA (using sonicated whole spirochetes or a flagellin-enriched fraction as the antigen preparation), more patients with Lyme disease had positive tests by immunoblotting, and fewer control subjects had false-positive results. Our results indicate that immunoblotting is superior to indirect ELISA for diagnosing early Lyme disease.\r"

All 14 pregnant women underwent appropriate diagnostic workups because of the low MSAFP level and were subsequently followed until delivery. Although the literature reports that low MSAFP levels are associated with chromosomal anomalies, none of the 14 women were delivered of infants with anomalies. Reasons for the unexpectedly high rate of abnormal MSAFP levels were investigated. Investigation revealed that normal values for MSAFP tests had been derived from testing performed on high-risk pregnant women who had an inherently higher rate of abnormal pregnancies and, apparently, a different range for normal MSAFP levels than a population of unselected family practice patients. The results of this study demonstrate that it may not be appropriate to apply diagnostic algorithms based on data derived in high-risk subspecialty clinics to unselected patients in a family practice.\r"

Focusing on the physician-patient relationship, their seminars evolved from an emphasis on a psychiatric history taken by the physician to a more pragmatic concern with the process of the everyday brief consultation. The leaders of traditional Balint groups guide group members toward open discussion of case material by modeling listening, curiosity, and tolerance for group members. Seminar goals include increasing general practitioners' sensitivity to their patients' emotional problems and expanding the practitioners' repertoire of interventions in the medical interview. With modifications, Balint-type seminars have been incorporated into some general practice and family medicine training settings both in England and in the United States. The unique features of Balint seminars within the context of medical education are their nondidactic, participatory nature, their goals of an emotional change within the physician, and their focus on the physician-patient relationship.\r"

Multifactorial causes of organic impotence are common and include diabetes mellitus, alcoholism, renal failure, and liver failure. Medications may cause impotence by a variety of mechanisms. The history and physical examination, along with simple laboratory tests, are the mainstay of evaluation and may be performed appropriately by family physicians. Successful new forms of nonsurgical treatment include penile self-injection with papaverine (sometimes with phentolamine) and penile-suction devices. Penile prostheses have been improved greatly in recent years. The patient may select among semirigid, multicomponent inflatable, and self-contained inflatable devices. New surgical treatments include penile arterial revascularization (for atherosclerosis) and ligation of the dorsal vein of the penis (for venous leak).\r"

Further, the latter examination results in a 2-10 times smaller dose than [99mTc]DTPA gamma camera renography under normal outflow conditions. Absorbed renal dose is large, approximately 70 mGy, in the three renographies in the borderline case with total outflow obstructions. For comparison, i.v. pyelography, which is the x-ray examination often used instead of radionuclide renography, involves an absorbed dose to ovaries 10-1000 times larger than in radionuclide renography.\r"

  ".W": "Adult respiratory distress syndrome, a clinical syndrome of respiratory failure that follows many kinds of insults, often in patients with no previous pulmonary disease, occurs in pediatric patients. This group of disorders has a typical clinical, pathologic, and pathophysiologic course, the hallmark of which is injury to the alveolar-capillary membrane with increased permeability of the pulmonary vasculature and pulmonary edema. Resolution may occur at any stage, but most patients die and many develop chronic lung disease requiring respiratory support for weeks or months. Multiple organ system failure, secondary infection, and irreversible respiratory dysfunction are responsible for the poor outcome. The underlying mechanisms that relate injury to the development of pulmonary disease are unclear. In some cases there may be direct injury to the lung, but in others, such as septic shock, there are mediators that link the initial insult to the subsequent lung injury. The leukocyte may have a central role in this process, although this is uncertain. Therapeutic measures needed to support the patient, especially increased inspired oxygen, are additional factors in the progression of lung disease. Current therapy, as summarized in Table II, is primarily supportive. Efforts to treat ARDS after it is clinically apparent have been disappointing. The pathogenic mechanisms that lead to ARDS are probably well advanced by the time the syndrome is diagnosed on the basis of the usual clinical signs. Therefore an emphasis on understanding the mechanisms of lung injury so that specific markers can be used to predict which patients will develop ARDS, allowing intervention in the early stages of the process, may prove rewarding.\r"

Asymptomatic infants were screened at 2 weeks and at 3 and 10 months of age, and bacteriuria was confirmed by bladder puncture. Infants with febrile urinary tract infection were enrolled during the same study period. The inflammatory response was characterized by the presence of fever, serum C-reactive protein, microsedimentation rate, urinary leukocyte excretion, and width of the ureters. The bacteria were defined for O:K:H serotype, hemolysin production, resistance to the bactericidal effect of serum, attachment to uroepithelial cells, and specificity for the globoseries of glycolipid receptors. In agreement with previous studies, the frequency of increased inflammatory signs and of attaching Escherichia coli was significantly higher in infants with febrile urinary tract infection than in the screening group. Within both patient groups, however, children infected with attaching E. coli strains had significantly more inflammatory signs. The results suggest that adherence facilitates the presentation of bacterial components capable of causing inflammation in the tissues in the urinary tract.\r"

When the results of the saline infusion turnover period were compared with those of the glucose infusion turnover period, plasma glucose concentration increased significantly, from 88 +/- 3 mg/dL to 101 +/- 4 mg/dL (P less than 0.001). Plasma insulin concentration remained unchanged (12 +/- 5 microU/mL vs 8 +/- 3 microU/mL). Ra was heterogenous during glucose infusion, and persistent Ra was present in six of 11 infants. Of the five infants who had decreased Ra during glucose infusion, three received glucose at a rate exceeding basal Ra. Of the remaining six infants who evidenced persistent Ra during glucose infusion, three received glucose at a rate equal to or in excess of basal Ra. We conclude that glucose homeostasis in low birth weight infants is transitional throughout the neonatal period.\r"

The effects of i.c.v. and i.v. administration of morphine and mu ([D-Ala2, NMePhe4, Gly5-ol]enkephalin and Tyr-Pro-NMePheD-Pro-NH2)-, delta ([D-Pen2,D-Pen5]enkephalin)- and kappa-selective [trans-3,4-dichloro-N-methyl-N-[2-91-pyrrolidinyl)-cyclohexyl]- benzeneacetamide methanesulfonate (U-50,488H), dynorphin-(1-9), dynorphin-(1-17), nalorphine, alpha-neoendorphin and ethyl-ketocyclazocine) opioid receptor agonists on gastric volume and acid output were examined. Morphine, [D-Ala2, NMePhe4, Gly5-ol]enkephalin and Tyr-Pro-NMePhe-D-Pro-NH2 decreased gastric acid secretion more potently after i.c.v. than after i.v. administration. The inhibitory effect of i.v. administered morphine on gastric acid secretion was not blocked by the quaternary opioid antagonist naltrexone methylbromide when given s.c. However, when naltrexone methylbromide was administered i.c.v., it blocked completely the effects of i.c.v. morphine and partially antagonized the effects of i.v. morphine, indicating a central site of action for morphine. The delta-selective agonist [D-Pen2,D-Pen5]enkephalin did not alter gastric acid secretion after i.c.v. or i.v. administration. The kappa-selective opioid agonist U-50,488H produced a dose-dependent increase in gastric acid secretion after i.v. but not i.c.v. administration. The other kappa-selective agonists tested did not produce a significant increase in gastric acid secretion after i.c.v. or i.v. administration. The increase in gastric acid secretion produced by U-40,488H was blocked by pretreatment with the opioid receptor antagonist naloxone, the nonselective muscarinic receptor antagonist atropine and the M1 selective muscarinic receptor antagonist pirenzepine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To determine whether these peptidases play roles in modulating kinin-induced contractions in the airways, we studied the effects of captopril, an ACE inhibitor, and of leucine-thiorphan and phosphoramidon, two NEP inhibitors, on the contractile responses to bradykinin and lysyl-bradykinin in isolated segments of ferret trachea. Bradykinin and lysyl-bradykinin-induced contractions in a concentration-dependent fashion (P less than .001), with a threshold of 10(-7) M and 5 x 10(-7) M, respectively. In contrast, the bradykinin(8-9) and the N-terminal heptapeptide bradykinin(1-7), the major fragments of hydrolysis of bradykinin by NEP and ACE, had a very weak or no effect on tracheal contraction in concentrations as great as 10(-5) M. Captopril, leucine-thiorphan and phosphoramidon (each inhibitor at 10(-5) M, 15 min) shifted the concentration-response curves to lower concentrations by approximately 1 to 1.5 log U (P less than .05). Both NEP inhibitors and the ACE inhibitor potentiated the response to bradykinin in a concentration-dependent fashion (P = .0001), and the combination of phosphoramidon and captopril resulted in an additive potentiation of bradykinin-induced contraction (P less than .02). [D-Pro2-D-Trp7,9]-substance P, a substance P antagonist, did not modify the potentiation of bradykinin-induced contraction by NEP inhibitors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Bradykinin-stimulated prostaglandin synthesis was investigated in Swiss albino 3T3 fibroblasts (Swiss 3T3 cells) and bovine pulmonary artery endothelial cells (CPAE). Previous studies have indicated that bradykinin stimulates arachidonic acid release in Swiss 3T3 cells by activating phospholipase A2 and by activating phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase C in CPAE cells. The dose-response for bradykinin-stimulated prostaglandin synthesis was similar in Swiss 3T3 cells and CPAE cells. Marked differences were found in the effects of several bradykinin analogs in Swiss 3T3 cells and CPAE cells. des-Arg9-bradykinin was a partial agonist in CPAE cells whereas it was completely inactive in Swiss 3T3 cells. [p-chloro-D-Phe6-D-Pro7]-Bradykinin was a full agonist in Swiss 3T3 cells, but only a partial agonist, exhibiting a bell-shaped curve, in CPAE cells. The bradykinin antagonist, [D-Arg0-Hyp3-D-Phe7]-bradykinin, was a several-fold more potent antagonist in Swiss 3T3 cells, compared to CPAE cells. The effects of these bradykinin analogs on prostaglandin synthesis do not fit the previously described BK1, BK2 bradykinin receptor classification. These findings suggest that there are at least two bradykinin receptors which stimulate prostaglandin synthesis. Previous studies have indicated that these two bradykinin receptors may be coupled to different transduction pathways for the release of arachidonate.\r"

Doses were given at 0.5 mg/m2/day as an iv injection for 3 consecutive days and then were escalated each month by 2.5 mg/m2/day until maximal tolerance was reached on the basis of hematologic or cardiac toxicity. No complete responses were demonstrated. Six patients (22%) had partial responses of 5.5 months' median duration. Four of 12 patients who had not received prior doxorubicin responded (33%), whereas two of 15 patients with previous doxorubicin exposure responded (13%). Cardiotoxicity, determined by serial radionuclide ventriculography, occurred in 10 patients (37%) at a mean total mitoxantrone dose of 83.0 mg/m2. Three of these 10 patients had no predisposing risk factors, four had received thoracic radiotherapy that might have involved the heart, and three had received prior doxorubicin without clinical toxicity. The failure of dose intensification to augment the response rate when compared to the response rates reported for less myelotoxic doses of the drug, in addition to the extent of cardiotoxicity noted, calls into question the value of dose intensification of mitoxantrone in the treatment of metastatic breast cancer.\r"

In one study, survivors (n = 9) and nonsurvivors (n = 11) of LPS were compared along with survivors (n = 8) of half the dose of LPS. In a second study, two groups of animals received naloxone: one (n = 11) had a bolus of 2 mg/kg followed by a 2 mg/kg/hr continuous infusion started 30 minutes before LPS while the other had the bolus and infusion started 1 hour after LPS was begun. Results: Both vasoconstrictive and vasodilative phases were seen. Vasoconstriction was associated with elevated beta endorphin levels, a pattern sustained until death in the nonsurvivors. Both pre- and posttreatment with naloxone lessened the maximum increase in total peripheral resistance index compared with untreated sheep. Discussion: The vasoconstrictive aspects of the response to LPS correlated with elevated beta endorphin levels and with mortality. This vascular response is attenuated with naloxone blockade.\r"

There has not been a Candida burn wound infection in this institution since June 1985. Nystatin, given orally as a 'swish and swallow' or mixed 1:1 with either silver sulfadiazine or polymyxin B/bacitracin, has eradicated Candida burn wound infections and septicemia from this institution and thus obviated the need for systemic antifungals such as amphotericin B.\r"

Transfer of MCMV also occurred following skin grafting with cryopreserved syngeneic skin. Recipients of infected skin were first positive for MCMV between 9 and 15 days post transplant, and MCMV was continually detectable through day 30. These results suggest that fresh or banked skin may serve as a source for transmission of cytomegalovirus infections.\r"

Various methods have been proposed and \"pull-through\" intra-arterial pressures are the \"gold standard.\" Deep Doppler duplex imaging was supplemented with real-time spectral analysis and velocity measurements in 29 cases. Twenty-three of these patients needed arteriography. One hundred sixty-six (166) arterial segments extending from the proximal aorta to the common femoral arteries were independently graded on duplex scans and arteriograms. For severe occlusive disease, duplex scanning is highly accurate (sensitivity 82%, specificity 93%). Velocity measurements were useful in determining the hemodynamic significance of stenoses. Peak systolic velocities in stenoses were measured with a duplex scanner. The pressure gradient calculated with the modified Bernoulli equation (delta P = 4Vmax2) correlated well with the gradients measured during arteriography (r = 0.9, n = 11). These noninvasive velocity measurements and Bernoulli calculations alert arteriographers to obtain special views of suspected areas and suggest the need for \"pull-through\" pressures and possible balloon angioplasty. In addition, these noninvasive measurements are useful to follow up patients who have mild to moderate aortoiliac disease and after angioplasty.\r"

A new dressing, DuoDERM hydroactive dressing (HD), has recently been used extensively for the treatment of venous stasis ulcers. Because of this trend, a prospective, randomized trial of these two dressings was undertaken. Sixty-nine ulcers (39 HD and 30 UB) were randomized. End points were complete healing and development of complications necessitating cessation of treatment. Time to healing, cost of treatment, and patient convenience were also evaluated. Twenty-one of 30 ulcers (70%) healed with UB therapy compared with 15 of 39 ulcers (38%) treated with HD (p less than 0.01, CST). Life-table healing rates at 15 weeks were 64% for UB compared with 35% for HD (p = 0.01, log rank test). Ten of 39 patients (26%) receiving HD had complications compared with no complications in the UB group (p = 0.004, FET). For those patients whose ulcers healed, there was no significant difference (p = 0.51, STT) in the mean time required for healing or the average weekly cost of dressing materials between the HD group (7.0 weeks at +11.50 per week) and the UB group (8.4 weeks at +12.60 per week). Those patients treated with HD reported a significantly greater level of convenience than those patients with UB (p = 0.004, STT). Although treatment with HD led to better patient acceptance, those patients receiving UB therapy had a significantly greater rate of healing and a significantly lesser incidence of complications than those patients treated with HD.\r"

Twenty-seven (77%) of the 35 outbreaks with identified food vehicles were caused by Grade A shell eggs or foods that contained such eggs. National data from 1973 to 1984 showed that S enteritidis outbreaks (44%) were more frequently associated with egg-containing foods than were outbreaks of other Salmonella serotypes (15%). Reflecting the geographic distribution of human illness, cultures of bulk raw eggs from pasteurization plants in the Northeast more frequently yielded S enteritidis (10%) than did eggs from other regions of the United States (0%). The epidemic rise in S enteritidis infections due to Grade A shell eggs is unlike past problems of salmonellosis associated with cracked or soiled eggs and raises the possibility of trans-ovarian contamination of eggs with S enteritidis. New techniques may therefore be needed to control resurgent egg-associated salmonellosis in the United States.\r"

The management of arrhythmias encompasses a wide spectrum of supraventricular and ventricular tachyarrhythmias occurring in patients with various cardiac diagnoses and different degrees of myocardial dysfunction. A number of the newer antiarrhythmic drugs that have either recently been released or appear promising are reviewed in this article. Drugs are described with respect to their basic pharmacology, electrophysiologic actions, pharmacokinetics and metabolism, hemodynamics, antiarrhythmic effects, side effects, interactions, indications, and dosage.\r"

  ".W": "Results of recent large scale treatment trials have demonstrated that aggressive management of high blood pressure prevents progression of mild hypertension to the accelerated or malignant phase and reduces incidence of stroke, congestive heart failure, and left ventricular hypertrophy. These trials mostly have utilized a diuretic-based, stepped-care approach to drug therapy, however, and have not shown a consistent beneficial effect of treatment on coronary heart mortality. In addition, the results of studies such as MRFIT have raised questions about serious risks of diuretic treatment in selected patients. These concerns have led to increased use of nonpharmacologic approaches to lowering blood pressure in patients with mild hypertension, but most patients ultimately require drug therapy. Alternative agents to diuretics now being employed as monotherapy in mild hypertension include beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, ACE inhibitors, alpha-blockers, alpha- and beta-blockers, and, to a lesser extent, centrally-acting sympatholytics and peripheral adrenergic antagonists. Rational use of these agents primarily is based on a careful evaluation of concomitant medical conditions (see Table 3), as well as their mode of action, relative side effects, ease of administration, and cost. Age and race recently have been found to be important determinants of antihypertensive response to agents such as diuretics, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, and ACE inhibitors (see Table 3) and appreciation of these relative differences may affect drug selection. When these factors are taken into account, an effective and well tolerated regimen can be tailored to the individual patient. It is hoped that aggressive treatment of hypertension in the future will cause a further decline in cardiovascular mortality in the United States.\r"

  ".W": "There is convincing evidence that ACE inhibitors, alone or in combination with a diuretic, effectively lower blood pressure in patients with all grades of essential or renovascular hypertension and that they are of particular benefit as adjunctive therapy in patients with congestive heart failure. The hemodynamic, hormonal and clinical effects of the presently available ACE inhibitors, captopril and enalapril, are comparable and their side effect profiles are extremely favorable. One important difference between the two oral ACE inhibitors, however, is their pharmacokinetics; enalapril's action is slower to begin and is of longer duration. Compared with other agents, ACE inhibitors offer important advantages, among them an improved feeling of well being. It is, therefore, expected that ACE inhibitors will gain greater acceptance by patients and physicians in the future.\r"
