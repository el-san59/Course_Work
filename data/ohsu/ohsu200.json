We performed the Tanagho modification of the Burch procedure in 13 patients, as the sole procedure in the treatment of genuine stress incontinence. Vascular clips were used to circumscribe the fat overlying the anterior part of the vaginal wall, thereby allowing en bloc resection of the vascular fat pad. Suspensory sutures of 1-0 Vicryl (polyglactin 910) were placed; no retroperitoneal drains were used. The blood loss was estimated to be less than 50 milliliters in ten instances and less than 75 milliliters in three. The average hospital stay was 4.2 days. All of the patients were given antibiotic prophylaxis and were discharged home with suprapubic drainage of the bladder. There were no intraoperative or postoperative complications. Thus, one of the serious complications of colpourethropexy can be avoided by using vascular clips to facilitate the removal of the periurethral and paravesical fat from the anterior part of the vaginal wall.\r"

  ".W": "In a series published in 1961, an unusual frequency of hysterectomies for uterine leiomyomas (fibroids) was reported in women with gallstones. The purpose of this study was to confirm the association between gallstones and uterine leiomyomas with a patient control study and to investigate its physiopathologic basis comparing the cholesterol saturation of bile in women with gallstones, in women with leiomyomas but no gallstones and in those in the control group with no gallstones or leiomyomas. Patients admitted to the surgical department have, routinely, echography of the gallbladder before and manual exploration of the pelvic floor during surgical intervention. For the first part of the study, we collected information concerning the diagnosis of leiomyomas from the operating room registers and about the diagnosis of gallstones from the clinical records. In 1982, 42 of 139 women operated upon consecutively for gallstones and five of 69 operated upon for other diseases of the gastrointestinal tract had leiomyomas, a statistically significant difference (chi-square test, p less than 0.001). This difference persisted stratifying women with gallstones and those in the control group for age. In the second part of the study, we examined the bile collected at duodenal drainage after gallbladder stimulation with cholecystokinin, in 11 young women with radiolucent gallstones (echography and cholecystography), in ten women with leiomyomas (gynecologic examination and pelvic echography) but no gallstones (echography) and in 11 women with no leiomyomas (gynecologic examination or pelvic echography) or gallstones (echography). Cholesterol, phospholipids and total bile acids in the biliary tract were analyzed with standardized enzymatic methods. The cholesterol saturation index of the biliary tract was higher in patients with leiomyomas than in those in the control group (Wilcoxon rank sum test, p less than 0.01) and similar to that of women with radiolucent gallstones. These data suggest that gallstones and leiomyomas are associated diseases, probably sharing a common cause.\r"

For these reasons, the results of 350 aspirations of the breast performed at this unit were analyzed and the benefits of aspiration cytology were evaluated. The results were encouraging with a diagnostic accuracy rate of 95.0 per cent, a sensitivity rate of 74.0 per cent, a specificity rate of 99.6 per cent and a positive predictive value of 98.0 per cent. There was one false-positive result emphasizing that aspiration cytology must be used in combination with other indicants of the nature of a mammary lump. The sites and the age of presentation of both benign and malignant lesions of the breast were briefly examined. Limitations of this technique were also discussed. A positive FNA result may obviate the need for frozen section. FNA cytology has been found to be a useful and accurate adjunct in the diagnosis of the nature of mammary lumps and is now an integral part in the management of these patients in this unit.\r"

This can be achieved by the intraluminal implantation of a soft, pliable tube above the anastomotic site. Previous clinical and experimental data have indicated that the intracolonic bypass procedure can protect an anastomosis in the presence of maximal colonic loading, gross dehiscences, or fecal peritonitis. This report presents 28 patients with perforated diverticulitis, all of whom were treated by one-stage intracolonic bypass procedures. Ten of the 28 patients had peritonitis, and 18 had pericolic abscesses. Results indicate no deaths and no anastomotic leakages. Three patients (10.7%) had a complicated postoperative course. One patient with fecal peritonitis had prolonged ileus and a pulmonary effusion, and one had a myocardial infarction. Both of these patients responded to medical therapy. Another patient had a wound infection. The hospital stay ranged from 10 to 18 postoperative days. All patients passed the tubes spontaneously 2 to 3 weeks after operation. The one-stage intracolonic bypass procedure can be recommended as a viable alternative to the two- or three-stage procedures commonly used for perforated diverticulitis.\r"

Experiments were performed in adult mongrel dogs to assess the relationship between plasma amino acid clearance (PAAC) and tissue high-energy phosphate after 90 minutes of warm hepatic ischemia. In addition, when PAAC was assessed in the anhepatic dog, PAAC fell to low levels after hepatectomy. After 90 minutes of warm ischemia, both tissue adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and PAAC fell to low levels, with PAAC similar to those levels observed in anhepatic dogs. Recovery of ATP and PAAC progressed over a 48-hour period but did not reach control values. Mortality rate was 33% in a group of 12 animals at 48 hours after ischemia. At 24 hours after ischemia, total free plasma amino acid levels were significantly higher in those animals that were dying as compared with those that were surviving (4352 mumol/L versus 2850 mumol/L; p less than 0.05). There was a strong correlation between PAAC and ATP (r = 0.81). PAAC appears to be an indicator of hepatic functional recovery and tissue ATP levels after ischemia.\r"

The Hemocath (Quinton Instrument Co., Seattle, Wash.), a soft, silicone rubber, double-lumen central venous dialysis catheter, was introduced as a permanent access device in 1984. A prospective evaluation of 53 catheters placed in 51 patients over a 9-month period is presented. Forty-nine catheters were placed for temporary access and four were placed for permanent access. All 53 catheters were discontinued after functioning an average of 63.9 days (range, 5 to 324 days). No major complications occurred during insertion or on dialysis. One catheter fragmented during removal and was retrieved in the operating room. Infection led to the removal of 17 catheters (34.7%). Thrombosis occurred in 11 catheters and was the cause of removal in two (4.1%). Excluding the two catheters that functioned at the time of the patient's deaths and those placed for permanent access, 91.5% of the catheters performed successfully as temporary accesses devices until permanent access sites were available for use. The catheter provided reliable, relatively safe, and easily maintained central venous access for hemodialysis.\r"

Lobular carcinoma in situ was first described in these terms and continues to be considered a purely microscopic lesion that never makes a mass in the breast. A very different situation exists in cases of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), because both gross and microscopic disease exists together. As a result, it has been difficult to evaluate competing treatment options for the DCIS lesion. This study was undertaken to better characterize patients with DCIS lesions. Seventy consecutive patients with DCIS who underwent treatment at our institution were analyzed and two subgroups were identified. The method of presentation and the distribution of cancer in the breast as well as in the regional lymph nodes were examined. The study shows that differentiation between gross and purely microscopic DCIS is feasible and must be accomplished if treatment recommendations are to be made on a rational basis.\r"

We examined this relationship in patients for whom data were collected prospectively (n = 14) and retrospectively (n = 27). We considered only patients cured after excision of a single gland and glands for which a three-dimensional description or volume of water displacement was available. To exclude artifactually elevated serum concentrations of parathyroid hormone (PTH), PTH values were used only from patients with levels of serum creatinine less than 2 mg/dl. To accommodate different assays, highest preoperative PTH, ionized calcium, and alkaline phosphatase (AP) values were expressed as percent above upper normal limit. There was excellent agreement (r = 0.93, p less than 0.05) between measured and calculated gland volume. In the prospective study (but not in the retrospective study) there was a significant (p less than 0.05) correlation (r = 0.61) between gland volume and highest preoperative total calcium value; however, there was considerable variation in gland size in patients with similar calcium levels. In neither study was there a significant correlation between gland volume and any of the following: calcium, ionized calcium, midregional PTH, carboxyterminal PTH, or intact PTH, alkaline phosphatase, and urine cyclic adenosine monophosphate (AMP). In the prospective study there was a tendency for urine cyclic AMP, ionized calcium, and AP to increase with increasing gland volume (r = 0.42, 0.45, and 0.51, respectively). Preoperative measurements of calcium, PTH, urine cyclic AMP, and AP are too inconsistent to rely on for determining the extent of parathyroid gland resection.\r"

  ".W": "The records of 128 patients who underwent hepatic resection at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation between 1960 and 1984 were reviewed. Sixty patients (47%) had major resections and 68 patients (53%) had wedge or segmental resections. One hundred five patients had malignant tumors; 29 were primary liver tumors and 78 were metastatic (61 from a colorectal primary). Twenty-three patients had benign hepatic tumors. The overall operative mortality rate was 7% (7.6% for malignant tumors and 4.3% for benign lesions). Survival rate after resection of a hepatocellular carcinoma (22 patients) at 3, 5, and 10 years was 50%, 33%, and 12%. Survival rate after resection of colorectal metastases at 3, 5, and 10 years was 44%, 28%, and 21%. Overall survival was better for patients who were less than 56 years of age (p = 0.003) and for patients with no tumor at the line of resection (p less than 0.001). In patients with colorectal metastases, survival after wedge or segmental resection was better than after a major anatomic resection (p = 0.004). In these patients, the number or size of the metastases, the time interval between resection of the primary tumor and of the hepatic metastases, and/or the presence of mesenteric lymph node metastases were not significant. Most patients with primary malignant tumors require major hepatic resection. Patients with benign tumors and metastatic colorectal carcinomas require resection only to the extent that the tumor is sufficiently encompassed.\r"

  ".W": "We determined the effect of topically applied ibuprofen on formation of second-degree burn edema and prostanoid production, a possible causative factor. Six adult sheep were given second-degree burns on both flanks with water at 80 degrees C while they were under general anesthesia. Lymph (QL), draining the flank areas, was used to monitor edema formation and prostanoid production. A 5% ibuprofen cream was applied at 2 and 5 hours after the burn and full-thickness biopsy specimens of burned hide were obtained at 8 hours for determination of water content. The QL increased sixfold in nontreated and 2.5 times in treated burn tissue. The lymph/plasma (L/P) protein ratio increased from 0.4 to 0.58 in both sides. Lymph TxB2 was increased from baseline of 200 pg/ml to 500 +/- 100 and 310 +/- 90 pg/ml in untreated and treated sides, respectively. Lymph 6-keto-PGF1 alpha increased from a baseline of 50 +/- 10 to 150 +/- 40 and 90 +/- 80 pg/ml in untreated and treated sides. The difference between PG content of lymph in treated and untreated sides was significant. Plasma prostanoids, except for a transient early rise, remained at preburn baseline. Lymph ibuprofen content on the treated side rose to 1.9 +/- 0.8 mcg/ml with no detectable plasma level. Water content of hide increased from a control value of 74 +/- 2% to 84 +/- 2% in untreated burn, while the value in the treated side was 76 +/- 4%, a significant difference between the two sides. We conclude that topically applied ibuprofen decreases both local edema and prostanoid production in burn tissue without altering systemic production.\r"

  ".W": "We determined the effect of complete excision and closure of the burn wound on the postburn increase in oxygen consumption. Twelve sheep were given a 15% of total body surface full-thickness burn and were monitored for 7 days. By the third day, a 50% increase in O2 consumption, VO2, was noted, as was a significant increase in cardiac index and decrease in mixed venous PO2, compared to baseline. The hypermetabolic process persisted for the 7-day pre-excision period. On the seventh postburn day all sheep were anesthetized for 2 hours with halothane and placed on positive pressure ventilation, and then one half of these sheep underwent excision and closure. During anesthesia, VO2 decreased to 76 +/- 15 ml/min/M2, a value significantly lower than even the preburn awake baseline of 122 +/- 14 ml/min/M2 and the 7-day postburn value of 180 +/- 18 ml/min/M2. Quantitative cultures, before excision, revealed the wounds to be noninfected (less than 10(5) organisms per gram). In six animals, the burns were totally excised to fascia and closed with full-thickness defatted hide from other sheep obtained at the same time under sterile conditions. In these animals, the VO2 returned to preburn baseline by 24 hours postexcision and remained there for the 3-day postexcision study period. In the other six burned sheep, the 15% full-thickness burns remained. The hypermetabolic state returned to the 7-day postburn level on return to the awake state and persisted for the remainder of the study. We conclude that complete excision and wound closure can reverse the postburn increase in O2 consumption.\r"

At admission to the surgical intensive care unit of Aretaieon Hospital, the patient was in a septic condition; a computed tomographic scan of the upper abdomen revealed an abscess at the head of the pancreas. Surgical exploration showed an infected hydatid cyst at the head of the pancreas and pancreatic edema. The cyst was evacuated and drained, which resulted in formation of an external pancreatic fistula. Fistulography showed a communication of the residual cavity with the main pancreatic duct. The patient was begun on a regimen of somatostatin infusion, and the fistula closed within 3 days. The patient was discharged on the sixteenth postoperative day and has remained in good health for a year.\r"

In fact, all hyperimmune Ig preparations were produced from high anti-CMV Ab titer plasma selected either by ELISA, complement fixation, or indirect hemagglutination test. These tests may not investigate the neutralizing activity of antibodies (Ab). We, therefore compared the ELISA titers with the neutralizing Ab titers in various normal Ig preparations from plasma or placenta and for intramuscular or intravenous use. Hyperimmune plasmatic Igs were also included. All the preparations were tested at a 5% dilution. We report the following data: (1) There is a poor correlation between ELISA and neutralization test. (2) The Igs of placental origin have significantly higher ELISA anti-CMV Ab titers than plasmatic normal Igs. They show the same neutralizing activity. (3) When compared with the normal intravenous Ig, normal intramuscular Igs show significantly higher titers with both techniques (P less than .0001). (4) Normal intramuscular Igs from placenta offer similar ELISA Ab titers and similar or higher neutralizing activity than hyperimmune Igs purified from plasma. It would be worth using Igs with high neutralizing activity in CMV prophylaxis in order to correlate in vitro tests and in vivo protection. In this respect, normal intramuscular Igs from placenta might be challenged in a clinical trial.\r"

  ".W": "Surgical extirpation of the primary tumor together with the involved regional nodes has been considered ineffective treatment for locally disseminated prostatic carcinoma. We retrospectively reviewed our experience with 42 patients with Stage D1 disease who underwent radical prostatectomy and bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy and who had a follow-up of one to thirteen years (mean 5 years). The following variables affecting survival and tumor progression were analyzed: (1) tumor grade and local extent; (2) number of positive lymph nodes, and (3) adjuvant therapy. The overall five- and ten-year survival was 79.5 per cent and 28 per cent compared with the expected survival of an age-matched control group of 88 per cent and 28 per cent, respectively. The degree of tumor differentiation had no effect on prognosis, but local tumor bulk and the number of involved lymph nodes significantly changed the disease progression and survival rate. Patients with low local tumor bulk and one positive node survived as long as the age-matched male population group. Our data suggest that radical prostatectomy may represent a valuable treatment in selected patients with Stage D1 prostate carcinoma.\r"

The dynamics of organisms at low concentration (less than 10(5) cfu/mL) in this setting has not been well-characterized; however, in patients with short-term catheters organisms initially present at low concentration (less than 10(5) cfu/mL) usually grow to high concentration (greater than or equal to 10(5) cfu/mL). At the time of catheter replacement for 7 long-term catheterized patients who were not receiving antibiotics, we identified all species at greater than or equal to 10(2) cfu/mL in fresh urine aspirated from the old indwelling catheter and the new sterile replacement catheter and then determined which of these species were present at high concentration two weeks later. A total of thirty-seven species, nineteen at high and eighteen at low concentration were detected in either the old or the new catheters. Eighteen of the nineteen initially detected at high concentration but only one of the eighteen initially detected at low concentration (p less than 0.001) were present at high concentration two weeks later. In patients with long-term indwelling urethral catheters, the number and multiplicity of species causing bacteriuria at low concentration rival that of species at high concentration; however, species at low concentration usually do not grow to high concentration in the presence of other species at high concentration.\r"

Intrarenal pressures remained below 16 cm of water (H2O) at all times with the Amplatz sheath with or without a Rutner adapter, whereas without a sheath the pressures ranged from 15 to 31 cm H2O (i.e., pressures associated with significant pyelovenous and pyelosinus backflow). Similar results were obtained in monitoring intrarenal pressures during clinical procedures. A working sheath should be utilized for all percutaneous nephroscopic procedures to minimize the incidence of pyelovenous and pyelosinus backflow as well as of perirenal extravasation of the irrigation solution. Even with a wide-lumen ureteral catheter in place, drainage via the ureter is not sufficient to maintain the intrapelvic pressure in the physiologic range.\r"

The purpose of our study was to determine the relationship between testicular volume and the presence or absence of a varicocele. Testicular volume was determined by the use of an orchiometer; the presence of a varicocele was determined by palpation during a Valsalva maneuver. The patients utilized in the study were those seen in our Andrology and General Urology Clinics; 291 patients with varicoceles and 83 control patients (no evidence of varicocele) were used. The left (mean = 21.4 mL) and right (mean = 23.4 mL) testicular volumes of patients with a varicocele were significantly reduced compared with that of the control group (left, mean = 23.4 mL; right, mean = 26.2 mL; p = 0.0041 and p = 0.002, respectively). The testicular volume corrected on the basis of the body mass (V/m2) also was significantly reduced in the varicocele group compared with controls (left p = 0.007; right p = 0.001). Reduced testicular volume relative to body size may be detected prior to actual demonstration of the stress pattern and the presence of a varicocele, and may be useful in early diagnosis. It is suggested that measurement of testicular volume may be a useful adjunct to routine examination of the infertile male.\r"

Using FCM the patients' tissue samples were examined and heterogeneity index scores (HIS) were determined. Both cases had recurrence. The first patient has increased in grade with a respective increase in HIS within four months (grade I----II, HIS 27.2----80.8). The second patient also has recurrence in three months both times with a grade I tumor and a score of 106.2. High scores reflect large aneuploid populations which have shown to recur.

These fatty acids are found in fish and marine mammal lipids. Whereas the fatty acid composition of several fish species has been documented, information is more limited on the mammals which feature significantly in the diets of many Arctic populations. This study investigated the fatty acid composition of commonly eaten marine mammals, as well as the polar bear and caribou. The tissue fatty acid composition was species-dependent, probably reflecting to some degree differences in feeding habits. The marine mammals and the amphibious polar bear, but not the caribou, contained substantial quantities of long chain omega-3 fatty acids. These studies further document the transfer of omega-3 fatty acids through the food chain to man and suggest that marine mammal and polar bear lipids are significant sources of omega-3 fatty acids.\r"

The majority of CAs were witnessed but cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) had been initiated by bystanders in only a few cases. The ambulance arrived within a mean time of 7.7 +/- 4.0 min. Forty-eight per cent of the CA patients showed ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation (VT/VF) on ambulance arrival. Patients with a prolonged ambulance delay showed a lower incidence of VT/VF than patients with a short delay. Patients in whom CPR had been initiated by bystanders showed a significantly higher incidence of VT/VF (67%) than unattended patients (45%). Bystander CPR was furthermore associated with an increased incidence of VT/VF in patients with prolonged ambulance delay. VT/VF was present at the time when the ambulance arrived in 86% of the CA patients who had received CPR from a bystander and were reached within 8 min by the ambulance.\r"

A previous history of ischaemic heart disease was found in 24 patients. Twenty-two of the patients admitted were found to have VF, two asystole and four other rhythms. All 11 survivors regained circulation at the site of the CA. At the time of admission all but one of the patients were unconscious and one long-time survivor remained unconscious until the 5th day following admission. Seventeen patients died while still in hospital. In 16 cases a diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction was established, a further six had VF without evidence of acute myocardial infarction and six had other diagnoses. Ten out of the 11 survivors were still alive six months after discharge. Only one case of recurrent VF was seen during a median follow-up period of 16 months. Prolonged coma, especially in combination with convulsions, was associated with a poor prognosis, while early return of circulation was significantly more common among survivors. Ongoing medication with beta-blockers, a high QRS rate on admission and VF without proof of any acute myocardial infarction were also found to be more common in survivors.\r"

Nine developed transient total or subtotal occlusion in one of the major coronary arteries, all of whom had ischaemic HVT-ECG and eight had abnormal HVT-Tl-Sc. In the five patients without spasm at CAG four had normal HVT-ECG and all five normal HVT-Tl-Sc.

Albumin decreased after four hours but no change was found after one week. Serum creatinine increased after one week in the acebutolol-treated group, while sodium, potassium and albumin-corrected calcium in serum did not change. The hyperphosphatemic effect may be due to blockade of beta 1-adrenoceptors, since the effect of the cardioselective acebutolol was no less than that of the non-cardioselective beta-adrenoceptor blockers.\r"

The duration of diabetes varied from 2 months to 30 years (mean 13 years). AN tests included a deep breathing test (E/I ratio) and an orthostatic test on tilt table (acceleration and brake indices) and the results were corrected for age. A clear correlation between AN test and duration of diabetes was shown only for the E/I ratio (r = -0.44, p less than 0.001). On the other hand, deteriorations in the brake index were unrelated to the duration of diabetes and occurred early; 35% of the patients with a duration of 10 years or less showed an abnormal brake index. Autonomic test deviations were related to other diabetic complications. The E/I ratio and the acceleration index were especially low in patients with retinopathy as well as in patients with symptoms of AN if combined with peripheral neuropathy (PN). The brake index was low in patients with symptoms of AN independent of PN.\r"

A standard water load test was performed as a reference before initiation of cytostatic treatment. All tests were repeated if remission of the malignant disease occurred. RIA-SIAD patients were a subgroup of classic SIAD patients, with more pronounced homeostatic abnormalities. Biochemical abnormalities were reduced after tumor regression but a completely normal renal water handling was achieved in only few patients, even when complete remission of the tumor was achieved, presumably due to the persistence of subclinical disease. However, an effect of other yet unknown factors might be of influence.\r"

In 13 patients (20%) TSH levels less than or equal to 0.1 mIU/l were found, indicating an overdose of thyroxine. After correction of the dose, 48 patients had normal TSH values. Their mean dose of thyroxine was 119 micrograms/24 hours, and the appropriate replacement dose tended to decline with advancing age. The serum level of thyroid hormones during replacement therapy with thyroxine very imperfectly reflected serum TSH values. It is concluded that overdose of thyroxine is common when suppressed serum TSH is used as an end point. Biochemical follow-up of replacement therapy with thyroxine in primary hypothyroidism therefore requires the use of an ultrasensitive TSH assay in order to detect such suppression. Serum levels of thyroxine or triiodothyronine (T3) during thyroxine therapy are poor indicators of pituitary TSH secretion and are therefore not useful as parameters of adequate thyroxine dosage.\r"

The maximal working capacity, measured by standardized exercise test on a bicycle ergometer, averaged 74 +/- 19% of the expected normal. Normal exercise ECG were registered in 16 out of 20 patients. Total hemoglobin/kg body weight (THb) was 67 +/- 16% of the expected normal and serum parathyroid hormone concentration (PTH) was 39 +/- 39 micrograms/l (normal range 0.5-1.5). Partial correlation showed a correlation between exercise capacity and PTH (p less than 0.05). In the longitudinal study the decrease in steady state exercise capacity was correlated to the decrease in THb (p less than 0.05), but not to the increase in PTH. In conclusion, patients with predialytic uraemia have a reduced maximal working capacity, due to several possible factors one of which is a reduced THb. Ischaemic heart disease seems to be of minor importance.\r"

  ".W": "We have previously demonstrated that enhanced glucose utilization in reperfused myocardium as assessed by F-18 2-deoxyglucose (FDG) and positron tomography predicts functional recovery. In this study, we compared segmental uptake of F-18 FDG with that of Tl-201 and Tc-99m (Sn) pyrophosphate (Tc-99m PPi) as conventional markers of tissue viability in seven dogs after a 3-hour intracoronary balloon occlusion and 20 hours of reperfusion. Myocardial blood flow was determined with microspheres. Regional retention fractions were calculated from tracer tissue concentrations, the arterial input function, and blood flow. Ischemic injury was assessed by triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining and histologic analysis. At 24 hours, blood flow was 22% lower in reperfused than in control myocardium (p less than 0.05). Uptake of Tl-201 was related linearly to blood flow (r = 0.92), while glucose utilization and Tc-99m PPi were 2.9 (p less than 0.01) and 4.7 (p less than 0.05) times higher in reperfused than in control myocardium. Retention fractions of Tc-99m PPi increased with the degree of ischemic injury, while F-18 FDG uptake was highest in segments with mild cell injury. Thus, in ischemically injured myocardium, Tl-201 primarily reflects blood flow. F-18 FDG as a marker of glucose utilization identifies ischemically injured but viable tissue. The admixture of necrotic cells can be determined with Tc-99m PPi. Our results indicate that a dual tracer approach might best characterize the presence and extent of reversibly and of irreversibly injured tissue in a given myocardial region.\r"

With a single 8 mg/kg dose of U-63,557A (furegrelate) administered prior to coronary ligation, platelet aggregation and serum TXA2 formation declined significantly (p less than 0.02) for up to 48 hours. Myocardial infarct size, as measured by planimetry of serial left ventricular sections, was decreased from 44 +/- 3% (saline-treated control rats) to 34 +/- 4% (p less than 0.05). Left ventricular creatine kinase (CK) following coronary ligation was also preserved in U-63,557A vs saline-treated control animals (p less than 0.05). These beneficial effects of U-63,557A were not accompanied by reduction in the indices of myocardial oxygen demand (heart rate and arterial pressure). Furthermore, neutrophil accumulation in the infarcted myocardium was significantly decreased by U-63,557A (26 +/- 6 vs 96 +/- 3/high-power field [p less than 0.01]). These data suggest that administration of a single dose of selective TXA2 synthetase inhibitor prior to coronary ligation modulates platelet function for up to 48 hours and reduces the extent of myocardial injury, which may, in part, relate to decrease in neutrophil accumulation.\r"

  ".W": "To determine if differences exist in the degree of ischemic damage and in postischemic recovery when different coronary arteries are occluded and reperfused, 40 barbital-anesthetized dogs were subjected to brief 15-minute periods of coronary artery occlusion followed by 3 hours of reperfusion (\"stunned\" myocardium) of the left anterior descending (LAD) or the left circumflex (LCX) coronary arteries. Myocardial segment shortening (%SS) in the subendocardium of nonischemic and ischemic reperfused areas was measured by sonomicrometry, and regional myocardial blood flow was measured by radioactive microspheres. Transmural tissue biopsies were taken at the end of reperfusion for the measurement of adenine nucleotides and total tissue water content. Arterial and local coronary venous blood samples were collected during preocclusion, during occlusion, and at 30 and 180 minutes of reperfusion for determination of blood oxygen content and oxygen consumption in the ischemic area. During occlusion, subendocardial blood flow (LAD flow = 0.11 +/- 0.02; LCX flow = 0.15 +/- 0.04 ml/min/gm), myocardial oxygen consumption (LAD = 2.4 +/- 0.7; LCX = 2.7 +/- 0.7 ml/min/100 gm), and areas of the left ventricle at risk (LAD = 27.4 +/- 2.3%; LCX = 32.4 +/- 2.4) were similar in both groups, thus indicating equivalent degrees of ischemia. There were no differences between groups in hemodynamics throughout the experiment or in the loss of myocardial high-energy phosphates or increase in total tissue water in the ischemic reperfused area at 3 hours of reperfusion. There was a significantly greater loss (p less than 0.05) of systolic wall function during LAD versus LCX occlusion and a greater recovery of segment function from 5 minutes throughout 1 hour of reperfusion after LCX occlusion (p less than 0.05), with no difference in %SS at 2 and 3 hours following reperfusion. Thus, although similar changes occurred in blood flow, metabolite parameters, tissue edema, wall function, and overall hemodynamics when either the LAD or LCX perfusion territories were occluded and reperfused, the loss of systolic wall function and recovery of segment shortening were more variable after regional stunning of the LCX perfusion bed. These data suggest that evaluation of pharmacologic or surgical interventions to improve postischemic functional recovery may be more reliably performed when the LAD coronary artery is the vessel occluded.\r"

Angiographically vasospasm (defined as a reduction in the internal diameter to less than 50% of the control value) was always induced by the topical application of 5 X 10(-1) mol/L DAP. The internal diameter decreased to 25% +/- 7% (mean +/- standard error, n = 6) 15 minutes after the application. The vasospasms propagated 2.7 +/- 0.6 and 1.1 +/- 0.3 cm downstream and upstream, respectively. Angioscopy showed that the lumen narrowed gradually and concentrically. Perfusion of the artery during vasospasm for 15 minutes with a backflow of blood from the contralateral artery resulted in thrombosis at the spastic segment. The results indicate that carotid vasospasm can be constantly induced by DAP, thrombosis occurs in the spastic artery, and angioscopy is useful for serial observation of the luminal changes induced by vasospasm.\r"

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of coronary angioplasty in 28 patients with prior myocardial infarction remote from the artery undergoing dilatation. Prior myocardial infarction was defined by the presence of pathologic Q waves on ECG or segmental akinesis on ventriculography. Angioplasty was successful in 30 of 33 lesions (91%) and in 25 of 28 patients (89%). Mean stenosis diameter was reduced from 91% +/- 7% to 28% +/- 16%; mean translesional gradient after angioplasty was 6 +/- 5 mm Hg. No patient developed severe hemodynamic deterioration from transient coronary occlusion during balloon inflation or from an acute ischemic complication. Three patients underwent coronary artery bypass surgery after unsuccessful angioplasty. There were no new Q wave infarctions or deaths. The results of coronary angioplasty in patients with prior infarction were compared with those of 203 patients without prior remote infarction. Primary success and occurrence of major complications were comparable in both groups. At a mean follow-up of 12 +/- 6 months, 18 of the 25 patients (72%) who underwent initially successful dilatation have remained symptom free with angioplasty alone. Therefore, coronary angioplasty is a suitable therapeutic procedure in carefully selected patients with angina pectoris and prior myocardial infarction at a distance from the site of angioplasty.\r"

Patients with ST segment depression developed smaller infarcts than those with ST segment elevation (creatine kinase MB isoenzyme 8.2 vs 13.3 gmEq/m2, p less than 0.002), but had a lower left ventricular ejection fraction on admission (44% vs 51%, p less than 0.001), more in-hospital complications, and a higher cumulative 1-year mortality (29% vs 11%, p less than 0.001) that could be accounted for by an excess of adverse baseline characteristics. Although a severity index (combining magnitude and extent of the initial ST segment deviation) was not useful for discriminating prognosis of patients with non-Q wave MI who presented with ST segment depression, it was useful in identifying a subgroup of patients with ST segment elevation with an adverse prognosis. The poor outcome of patients with non-Q wave MI presenting with either ST segment depression or severe ST segment elevation on admission suggests that patients in these subgroups should receive close surveillance and should possibly be considered for aggressive therapy.\r"

Thirteen patients showed ST segment elevation only, seven patients showed both ST segment elevation and depression, and four patients showed ST segment depression only. ST segment elevation most frequently occurred in the left anterior chest leads corresponding to the QS area, and ST segment depression developed in the left lower chest and left lower back leads. There was good correlation between the number of lead points showing ST segment elevation (nSTe) after exercise and the number of lead points showing QS waves (nQS) before exercise (r = 0.65). nSTe was also correlated with the asynergy index (r = 0.43). These findings suggest that ST segment elevation is mainly the result of aggravation of wall motion abnormalities of the infarcted myocardium. Body surface distribution of ST segment depression was similar to that in effort angina pectoris without MI. We conclude that exercise-induced ST segment depression in MI mainly reflects the ischemia of the surviving myocardium of small infarcts or the peripheral area of large infarcts.\r"

In the present study, such a comparison was performed to determine which thallium variable(s) are superior, when the computer method is used. In addition, both methods were compared to determine their correlations with the angiographic extent of coronary artery disease (no disease, or one-vessel disease vs multivessel, or left main disease) and the occurrence of future events (cardiac-related death or nonfatal myocardial infarction). Computer-aided analysis was superior to visual analysis (an average of three independent blinded observers) for detection of coronary disease because: (1) it was more specific for detecting initial defects despite having the same sensitivity (89.6% vs 91.0%, p = NS) and (2) it was more sensitive for detecting redistribution in the territory of a stenosed vessel (68% vs 46%, p less than 0.001). However, absolute myocardial clearance of thallium had very poor specificity compared to visually assessed redistribution. Only when segmental clearance was considered abnormal on a relative basis (if it was slower by 98% or more than the fastest clearing segment in the heart) did abnormal clearance achieve the same specificity (99%) and a better sensitivity (60% vs 48%, p less than 0.01) than visual analysis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

On the discharge regimen, VT was no longer inducible by programmed stimulation in 22 patients (group 1). Twenty-seven patients (group 2) with persistent induction of VT despite extensive serial drug testings were discharged on a regimen that resulted in a marked reduction of VPCs on Holter monitoring (greater than or equal to 50% reduction of VPCs, greater than or equal to 90% reduction of couplets, and abolition of nonsustained VT). The modes of induction at baseline and on the discharge regimen were compared in each patient in group 2.

The size of the right atrium was larger (p less than 0.001) in patients with mitral stenosis and atrial fibrillation (21.7 +/- 5.2 cm2) than in patients in sinus rhythm (13.4 +/- 3.9 cm2) or normal subjects (13.8 +/- 3.7 cm2). Multiple regression analysis showed that the severity of mitral stenosis accounted for 38%, age for 7%, and atrial fibrillation for 11% of the change in the size of the left atrium. Atrial fibrillation accounted for 24%, age for 11, and mitral valve area for 3% of the change in the size of the right atrium. The analysis suggests that the onset of left atrial dilatation in mitral stenosis is the result of an early increase in left atrial pressure. Atrial fibrillation, which develops irrespective of the severity of the mitral stenosis, contributes to a further enlargement of the left and right atria.\r"

Thirty-seven (43%) also underwent catheterization and direct determination of the pressure gradient. The correlation between CW Doppler and catheterization measurements was high (r = 0.91) and significantly superior to HPRF Doppler (r = 0.72; p less than 0.005). Disparities between the Doppler measurements predominantly occurred in patients with gradients exceeding 50 mm Hg in whom underestimation by the HPRF instrument was frequent. These data suggest that continuous wave Doppler is the preferred modality for the estimation of transvalvular pressure gradients in adult patients with moderate or severe aortic stenosis.\r"

In the third patient, apical infarction with hyperdynamic contraction of the mid- and basal portions of the myocardium appeared to be the pathophysiologic mechanism.

The cases were classified roentgenologically according to the method of Sakakibara and Konno: 64.5% were type I, 23.7% type II, 1.1% type IIIv, 6.4% type IIIa, 1.1% type IIIa + v, and 3.2% type IV. A new and simplified method of classification has been devised in the Shanghai Chest Hospital and shows the highest incidence to be the type of aneurysm of the sinus of Valsalva associated with ventricular septal defect. On aortography three types of morphologic changes--aneurysmal formation, enlargement of the sinus with no definite aneurysm, and sinus rupture with no enlargement or aneurysmal formation--are observed. Angiographically, shunting from ruptured sinus or sinus aneurysm begins in middiastole and gradually increases to end diastole. Aortic insufficiency, if present, usually begins in early diastole and extends over the whole diastolic phase in a decrescendo fashion. Special attention should be paid to the differentiation between ruptured sinus of Valsalva with or without aneurysmal formation and ventricular septal defect with aortic insufficiency.\r"

This index was measured from two-dimensional echocardiograms in 98 children (ages 1 day to 19 years) with congenital heart disease, and results were compared to right ventricular/left ventricular peak systolic pressure ratios (RVP/LVP) determined at cardiac catheterization. LVSCI was also computed in 50 children without cardiovascular or pulmonary disease to define the normal range. A short axis image of the left ventricle at the level of the papillary muscles was obtained from the left parasternal position. Area and perimeter were determined by computer planimetry of the LV endocardium at end systole. LVSCI was measured from three consecutive beats and averaged. In the normal group all values of LVSCI exceeded 93% (mean 96%). In the group with congenital heart disease RVP/LVP correlated exponentially with LVSCI: RVP/LVP = e2.6-0.04 LVSCI; with r = 0.88, SEE = 0.39, and p less than 0.001. If patients with suprasystemic right ventricular pressures (RVP/LVP greater than 1.2) are excluded, there is a linear correlation between RVP/LVP and LVSCI: RVP/LVP = 2.3-0.021 LVSCI; with r = 0.80, SEE = 0.14, and p less than 0.001. LVSCI could distinguish between patients with normal, mildly elevated, moderately elevated, and severely elevated RVP/LVP. We conclude that LVSCI is a readily determined parameter that is independent of age or body size and predicts RVP/LVP in children with congenital heart disease.\r"

  ".W": "To forego the need to arbitrarily choose coordinate, reference, and indexing systems and to make other assumptions mandated by traditional methods of measuring wall motion, a technique of regional function analysis based on shape characteristics and pattern recognition was developed. The method is based on curvature analysis, a fundamental shape parameter, and is adaptive to the complex geometry of cineangiographic ventricular images. Quantitative shape parameters were compared to a standard method of regional function analysis (center-line method) in 130 patients. Quantitative shape and wall motion indexes showed a positive correlation over a broad range of normal and abnormal function (r = 0.748, p less than 0.001). Overall sensitivity and specificity for categorization of regional function were not statistically different for either technique. Within regions, however, shape criteria were more specific in categorizing inferior zones than anterior zones and were more often abnormal in the presence of mild regional abnormalities that were not located in the apical region. In conclusion, shape analysis and pattern recognition techniques can be used to forego dependence on the numerous assumptions and approximations required by traditional wall motion techniques, while providing performance characteristics that are similar to, and in some instances better than, traditional approaches. Incorporation of shape information in assessments of regional function provides a more comprehensive evaluation that includes the important visual cues used by experienced observers or \"experts.\"\r"

It has been proposed that subendocardial ischemia may exacerbate and perpetuate left ventricular dysfunction in congestive heart failure. Diastolic perfusion time in relation to heart rate was analyzed in 29 digitalized (group 1) and 12 nondigitalized patients (group 2) with heart failure and in 58 normal control subjects. In group 1 there was a strong negative exponential correlation (r = -0.85) and in group 2 a strong negative logarithmic correlation (r = -0.95) between heart rate and diastolic time; both regressions differed significantly from normal control. There was a 9% increase of diastolic time at a heart rate of 60 bpm in group 1 and a 7% increase in group 2 (both p less than 0.05) compared with normal subjects. The curves intersected the regression line of normal subjects at a heart rate of 98 bpm in group 1 and 93 bpm in group 2. At 120 bpm there was a 10% decrease in diastolic time for both groups with heart failure (both p less than 0.05). Changes in diastolic perfusion time relative to heart rate are more pronounced in congestive heart failure such that at faster heart rates this relationship may further impede subendocardial blood flow.\r"

To determine whether this may be due to a decline in cardiovascular risk factors, we compared risk factors in a 1985 urban black population, ages 35 to 69, with those obtained in blacks of the same area in 1973-74. Age-adjusted mean body mass and the prevalence of overweight increased significantly over the 12-year period in both men and women. Mean systolic blood pressures declined significantly in both sexes, diastolic blood pressure declined significantly in men, and the proportion of men and women hypertensives on medication and under control increased. The overall prevalence of cigarette smoking changed very little, but the proportion of heavy smokers decreased significantly in men. No significant changes occurred in resting heart rate. Concurrently with these risk factor trends, age-adjusted heart disease mortality rates in area blacks fell 27% between 1968-73 and 1979-84, and stroke mortality fell 58%. Changing risk factors may be contributing to declining cardiovascular mortality rates in blacks. However, overweight seems to be a worsening problem.\r"

Warmed saline solution (15 to 20 ml) was injected through the guiding catheter into the coronary arteries for replacement of blood. Twenty-one of the 31 coronary segments were visualized and photographed on color cinefilms. The lumen of the atherosclerotic segment showed narrowing with smooth surface or with spiral folds. PTCA caused dilatation of the stenosed segment with scattered thin thrombi.

Radiographic 2- to 8-day-old total thrombotic occlusions were produced in 30 canine femoral arteries. A high-speed rotating device with a cutting tip was used in 18 arteries. Successful opening occurred in every case, with a residual percent diameter stenosis at 45 +/- 25%. Vessel perforation was seen in 6 of the 18 arteries. A noncutting rotational thrombectomy catheter was used in six arteries. Radiographic patency was established in two of six (residual stenosis 86 +/- 28%), with one perforation with the use of the noncutting thrombectomy catheter. Balloon angioplasty reestablished radiographic patency in three of six arteries (residual stenosis 77 +/- 2%). No perforations were seen with balloon dilation, but radiographic distal emboli were always observed. No radiographic emboli were observed with either of the rotational devices. We conclude that subacute arterial thromboses are easily opened with an abrasive-tipped rotating angioplasty device. Although perforations are relatively common with this prototype equipment, design changes may produce a clinically useful angioplasty device.\r"

  ".W": "Advancing age is associated with progressive reductions in the vascular distensibility of major vessels. Two clinically relevant consequences of physiologically impaired arterial compliance of aging, increased systolic blood pressure and decreased carotid arterial baroreflex sensitivity, are discussed. While arterial thickening and stiffening with age are associated with increased systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure is generally stable or even decreases slightly with advancing age. Thus, the prevalence of isolated systolic hypertension increases dramatically with age. This long-neglected abnormality has recently attracted attention, and the view that systolic hypertension is harmless and its treatment fraught with a high incidence of serious adverse effects has now been shown to be myth. Several studies indicate substantial risk associated with isolated systolic hypertension, especially with regard to increasing prevalence of stroke. A recent multicenter trial has shown that systolic blood pressure can be safely lowered with low doses of thiazide diuretics. Currently, a National Institutes of Health sponsored multicenter trial aims to determine whether treatment of isolated systolic hypertension is associated with reduced risk. Age-related impairments in baroreflex sensitivity reduce the capacity of normal elderly persons to increase the heart rate in response to hypotensive stress and contribute to the increased prevalence with advancing age of orthostatic hypotension. This must be taken into account in the design of pharmacologic treatment regimens in older persons.\r"

During this period they had 389 ischemic episodes: 104 (27%) symptomatic and 285 (73%) silent. Marked variability was observed between patients in the number of ischemic episodes (range 2 to 15 per day, mean 6.5), duration of ischemia (range 6 to 419 minutes/day, mean 76.5), maximal ST depression (range 1 to 6 mm, mean 3.4) and heart rate at the beginning of ST depression (range 75 to 105 beat/min, mean 91). The day-to-day variability in individual patients between the different days in the number of ischemic episodes was 36%, in duration 51%, and in maximal degree of ST depression 31%. Only 9% variability was noted in heart rate at the beginning of ST depression. Similar day-to-day variability in individual patients was noted in the symptomatic and silent episodes. For clinical purposes of evaluation of ischemia during daily activities, 1 day of monitoring appears to be sufficient because within the first day, 78% of the maximal number of ischemic episodes, 64% of their duration, and 84% of the maximal degree of ST depression were detected. However, for evaluation of anti-ischemic drugs at least 2 monitoring days are required.\r"

At coronary angiography, 8 had at least 50% diameter narrowing of the left main coronary artery and 4 had severe ostial stenosis of the right coronary artery. Eight patients also had valvular heart disease, 4 pericardial disease and 4 complete heart block. Mean left ventricular ejection fraction was 67 +/- 11% (range 53 to 80%). Nine had undergone coronary artery bypass grafting, but surgery was difficult or impossible in 3 because of severe mediastinal and pericardial fibrosis.

The incidence of permanent pacemaker dysfunction detected by AECG in the early postimplantation period, the frequency that pacemaker dysfunction detected by AECG was not detected by telemetric monitoring and the frequency that results of AECG led to pacemaker reprogramming before hospital discharge were determined. AECG detected at least 1 type of pacemaker dysfunction in 35% of patients and routine telemetry identified the abnormality in only 8% (p less than 0.001). Pacemaker dysfunction occurred in 42% of patients with dual-chamber devices and 27% of those with single-chamber devices (difference not significant). In the 35 patients who had pacemaker malfunction, a total of 50 instances of pacemaker dysfunction were detected. Failure of atrial capture occurred in 2% of patients, failure of atrial sensing in 9%, failure of atrial output in 1%, failure of ventricular capture in 8%, failure of ventricular sensing in 14%, failure of ventricular output due to myopotential inhibition in 11% and pacemaker-mediated tachycardia in 5%. The results of the AECG led to a clinical intervention in 22 patients (pacemaker reprogramming in 21 patients and lead repositioning in 1 patient) in whom no pacemaker dysfunction was suspected on the basis of telemetry or clinical symptoms. In conclusion, AECG provides additional benefit beyond that of routine telemetry monitoring in identifying pacemaker dysfunction in the early period after implantation.\r"

The prevalence of any VPC was 4.4% (681 of 15,637). Over an average follow-up period of 7.5 years, a total of 381 deaths occurred. Of these, 34% (131 of 381) were ascribed to coronary artery disease (CAD) and 31% of the CAD deaths (41 of 131) occurred suddenly. The presence of any VPC was associated with a significantly higher risk for SCD (adjusted relative risk = 3.0; p less than 0.025). On the other hand, the presence of any VPC was not associated with any significant increase in the risk of non-SCD or of total deaths from CAD (adjusted relative risk = 1.0 and 1.6, respectively). When VPC characteristics such as frequency (2 or more uniform VPCs every 2 minutes) and complexity (multiforms, pairs, runs, R-on-T) were examined, those with frequent or complex VPCs were at a significantly increased risk of SCD (adjusted relative risk = 4.2; p less than 0.005), whereas for non-SCD no significant increase in risk was found (adjusted relative risk = 1.6; p = 0.28).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The value of a transcardiac lead system (coronary sinus to right ventricular apex) to record atrial and ventricular electrical activity and its pacing capabilities was assessed in 20 patients with a variety of tachycardias (atrial tachycardia in 3 patients, atrial flutter in 4, intranodal tachycardia in 6, circus movement tachycardia using an accessory pathway in 1 patient, and ventricular tachycardia in 9). The transcardiac lead invariably showed both atrial and ventricular electrical activity during sinus rhythm and tachycardias, allowing application of the same criteria as used when analyzing cardiac rhythm on the surface electrocardiogram. Atrial complexes had a mean amplitude of 4.2 mV during sinus rhythm and varied from 3.0 to 4.1 mV during the different types of tachycardia. Ventricular complexes had a mean amplitude of 9.8 mV during sinus rhythm, 13.8 mV during supraventricular tachycardia and 16.1 mV during ventricular tachycardia. The duration of the QRS complex on the transcardiac lead was equal to the duration of the QRS complex on the surface electrocardiogram during tachycardias with a small or wide QRS complex. By varying the intensity of current delivered through the transcardiac lead, only right ventricular pacing (mean current intensity 1.2 +/- 0.4 mA) or simultaneous atrioventricular pacing (mean current intensity 4.7 +/- 3.3 mA) could be achieved. Termination of all episodes of tachycardia was achieved with either ventricular pacing or simultaneous atrioventricular pacing. This transcardiac lead system allows clear identification of atrial and ventricular events, is suitable for tachycardia analysis using simple surface electrocardiographic algorithms and allows pacing termination of a variety of tachycardias.\r"

  ".W": "The risk of life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias complicating coronary angiography is reportedly increased in patients in whom temporary righ ventricular pacemakers are used. Placement of the temporary pacing electrode in the right atrium or vena cava during angiography theoretically removes from the vulnerable ventricle a source of mechanically or electrically induced ventricular arrhythmias. This hypothesis was evaluated in 7,648 consecutive patients who underwent cardiac catheterization with selective coronary angiography, including 103 with life-threatening ventricular arrhythmic complications. The prevalence of ventricular arrhythmias was 6.4 times greater in patients with temporary pacemakers than in those without (7% vs 1.1%, respectively, p less than 0.001). Analysis of 369 cardiac catheterizations concurrently using temporary pacemakers revealed a greater than 4-fold decrease in the frequency of ventricular arrhythmias when the pacing electrodes were located in the right atrium or vena cava rather than the right ventricle (2% vs 9%, respectively, p less than 0.01). No significant difference in indications for temporary pacing could be distinguished between the groups based on location of the pacing electrode or occurrence of ventricular arrhythmias. These findings confirm that there is an increased risk of ionic contrast agent-induced ventricular arrhythmias in patients with chronic underlying conduction disturbances undergoing coronary angiography with concurrent right ventricular temporary pacemakers. This risk can be significantly decreased by placing the pacing electrode in the right atrium or vena cava.\r"

Its antiarrhythmic efficacy was studied in 21 patients with spontaneous and inducible supraventricular tachycardia: atrioventricular (AV) nodal tachycardia in 6 patients and orthodromic AV reciprocating tachycardia in 15. It increased the effective refractory period of the AV node in all patients with AV nodal tachycardia (fast pathway, p less than 0.02; slow pathway, p less than 0.01), but did not alter the anterograde (n = 8) or retrograde (n = 9) refractory periods of accessory pathways. Flestolol prevented initiation of tachycardia by causing block in anterograde AV nodal conduction. It was more effective in patients with AV nodal tachycardia (5 of 6) than in those with AV reciprocating tachycardia (4 of 15, p less than 0.03). In patients in whom it was ineffective, the mean tachycardia cycle length increased by 54 ms because of an increase in AH interval (p less than 0.0001, n = 11). The cycle length of tachycardia induced 30 minutes after infusion was similar to the cycle length in the control state (354 vs 355 ms, n = 16). Flestolol's kinetics permitted clinically indicated electropharmacologic testing of a second antiarrhythmic drug in 8 patients and control of ventricular rate until arrhythmia surgery in 1 patient with incessant tachycardia. No hypotension or toxicity occurred. Our findings indicate that flestolol's principal antiarrhythmic effects are on the AV node, similar to the effects of other beta-blocking drugs. Its ultrashort duration of action is an advantage during electropharmacologic testing.\r"

Serial defibrillation thresholds were measured in 23 patients over a mean replacement time of 24.8 +/- 7.5 months. In all cases the lead system was a superior vena cava coil to a left ventricular epicardial patch. The defibrillation threshold for the entire group increased from 12.3 +/- 4.7 J to 16.9 +/- 5.9 J (p less than 0.05). Striking increases in the defibrillation threshold were seen in the subgroup of patients taking amiodarone (from 10.9 +/- 4.3 J at implantation to 20.0 +/- 4.7 J at replacement, p less than 0.05). Defibrillation threshold decreased in patients taking no antiarrhythmic drugs or taking class I agents. Thus, the increase in mean defibrillation threshold was the result of an increase in the patients taking amiodarone. These data suggest that at initial implantation lead systems associated with the lowest defibrillation threshold should be used and the defibrillation threshold should be measured at generator change to guarantee an adequate margin of safety.\r"

Over the follow-up interval, permanent left BBB developed in 8 of the 15 patients. Seven of these 8 had underlying CAD, compared to 0 of 6 patients with normal coronary arteries and normal left ventricular function (p less than 0.002). In 1 patient with normal coronary arteries and a left ventricular ejection fraction of 0.34, permanent left BBB developed. During follow-up, 4 patients died; 3 had significant CAD and 1 had depressed left ventricular function. In no patient did high-grade atrioventricular block develop and no patient required pacing. Thus, development of permanent left BBB in patients with exercise-induced left BBB is related to presence or absence of underlying CAD or myocardial disease. When left BBB is found in the absence of underlying heart disease, there does not tend to be progression of the conduction disturbance and the prognosis is excellent.\r"

After smoking 2 of their usual brand of cigarettes in rapid succession, the electrophysiologic protocol was repeated. Nicotine, catecholamine and carbon monoxide concentrations all increased significantly. Smoking increased heart rate and improved atrioventricular conduction in the 13 patients receiving chronic beta-blocker therapy (mostly for angina pectoris); increases in heart rate and improvement in atrioventricular conduction were not different statistically from those seen in patients not receiving beta-blocker therapy, suggesting the possibility of a direct effect of nicotine or other components of tobacco smoke. Ventricular refractoriness was not altered and atrial and ventricular arrhythmias were not increased by smoking. Persistent sympathomimetic actions of cigarette smoking may explain in part the failure of beta-blocking drugs to reduce cardiac mortality risk in smokers after myocardial infarction.\r"

The operating principle is based on establishing an electric arc between a central electrode and the inside of an enclosing metallic tip to convert electrical energy to thermal energy. The metal tip catheter can be heated rapidly and boils water in a saline bath with less than 1 W of power. In vitro studies, using human atherosclerotic aortic segments, demonstrated that effective tissue ablation required more power in saline than in air (more than 9 W vs less than 1 W). The rate of tissue ablation varied with the amount of power delivered and the catheter tip pressure against tissue. In a saline field, 2-mm thickness aortic wall segments were consistently perforated in 3 seconds when 15 W of power and 20 g/mm2 of pressure were applied. Using an atherosclerotic rabbit, in vivo electrical thermal angioplasty (3 W of power for 10-second treatment sequences) was performed in obstructed iliofemoral vessels after mechanical recanalization was attempted. Of the 7 vessels that were more than 50% narrowed (compared with contiguous normal vessel diameter), mechanical recanalization was effective in only 1, but thermal angioplasty resulting in an increased lumen diameter was successful in 6 others. The recanalized segments were 8 to 10 cm; gross morphologic and histologic examination of recanalized vessels demonstrated little or no thermal injury. In addition, significant cholesterol-laden plaques remained in the vessel lumen, which appeared to have been compressed and displaced laterally.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

This method may help identify hypertensive patients at greater risk. Factor analysis found 4 discrete groups of the 7 discriminant variables that function together. Despite beat-to-beat variations due to respiration, myocardial dysfunction (when present) and individual differences, dysfunctional beats can be identified by these methods.

  ".W": "Infusion of glucose-insulin-potassium during acute myocardial infarction has favorable clinical and hemodynamic effects, presumably as a result of decreased myocardial utilization of free fatty acids. In 14 patients with coronary artery disease, hypertonic glucose (a bolus of 10 g followed by infusion of a 30% glucose solution at a constant rate of 10 mg/kg/min) was infused and arterial and coronary sinus levels of glucose, lactate and free fatty acids were measured before and after 15 and 30 minutes of infusion. Arterial glucose and lactate levels increased significantly after glucose infusion, whereas free fatty acid levels decreased significantly. Modest but significant correlations also existed between glucose arterial levels and the arterial-coronary sinus glucose difference (r = 0.53, p less than 0.001); arterial lactate and the arterial-coronary sinus lactate difference (r = 0.35, p less than 0.01); arterial free fatty acids; and the arterial-coronary sinus free fatty acid difference (r = 0.62, p less than 0.001). These results with a hypertonic glucose infusion are similar to those reported after infusion of glucose-insulin-potassium without the potential for harmful adverse effects from infusions of insulin or potassium. Therefore, infusion of hypertonic glucose may be beneficial in patients with coronary artery disease. Further work is necessary to study its effects in different subgroups of patients with coronary artery disease.\r"

In the group studied, in 87 (80%) the course was uncomplicated 3 days after admission, as defined by a lack of congestive heart failure, arrhythmias and angina, and 53 patients (49%) performed heart rate-limited (140 beats/min) treadmill exercise. These patients exercised for 7.9 +/- 3.4 minutes, achieving a heart rate of 129 +/- 11 beats/min and a systolic blood pressure of 151 +/- 27 mm Hg. The exercise test was not accompanied by any protracted ischemia, infarction or significant arrhythmias. Accompanying tomographic thallium-201 scintigraphy demonstrated a reversible perfusion defect in 14 patients (26%), no evidence for ischemia in 36 patients (69%) and an equivocal result in 3 patients (6%). Of the 14 patients with a positive exercise-thallium test result, 4 had an adverse clinical outcome of either reinfarction, postinfarction angina or ventricular tachycardia during hospital days 4 to 10; an adverse in-hospital outcome was not seen in the 40 patients with a negative exercise-thallium test result (p = 0.009). Thus, early exercise testing after acute myocardial infarction is safe in selected patients with an uncomplicated course and the test is predictive of in-hospital clinical outcomes.\r"

Two hundred patients with AMI were randomized to receive amiodarone, 200 mg every 8 hours for 1 month, followed by 200 mg/day, or placebo, starting 48 hours after the onset of chest pain. Twenty-four-hour Holter monitoring was performed on day 1, repeated after 8 days and subsequently at 3-month intervals. One hundred seventy-two patients were followed for 6 to 42 months and monitor data were available at 6 to 9 months in 129 patients. Amiodarone was well tolerated, with no serious side effects; 12 patients were withdrawn from therapy. At 6 to 9 months more than 1 ventricular premature complex per hour was present in 3 of the 59 amiodarone-treated patients (5%) and 24 of the 70 placebo-treated patients (34%) (p less than 0.02). Complex arrhythmias (multifocal, early cycle, repetitive, bigeminy, trigeminy or ventricular tachycardia) were present in 5 of 59 of the amiodarone-treated patients (8%) and 20 of 70 placebo-treated patients (28%) (p less than 0.005). Sixteen patients in the amiodarone group and 11 in the placebo group died (difference not significant). Thus, amiodarone can reduce the frequency and complexity of ventricular arrhythmias after AMI, but it is unlikely that this will result in a substantial beneficial effect on post-AMI mortality risk.\r"

Almost half (44%) of all deaths from coronary causes occurred in the first 2 years. Univariate analysis of 21 historical and clinical variables found several of prognostic significance: age, prior myocardial infarction, previous diastolic hypertension, history of diabetes mellitus, history of heart failure, presence of rales above the scapula, ventricular gallop, Killip class, cardiomegaly on admission chest x-ray and prescribing digitalis or diuretic at discharge. When these prognostic factors were entered into multivariate analysis, only Killip class (p less than 0.001) emerged as an independent predictor of survival.\r"

The median interval from the onset of the AMI to death was 11 days, and from the onset of the AMI to operative closure of the VSD, 4 days. Eight patients died in the operating room or within 2 hours of operation. Coronary artery bypass grafting was performed simultaneously with the VSD closure in 7 patients. Death was attributed to unsuccessful VSD closure in 5 patients, to inadequate left ventricular cavity after resection of necrotic myocardium in 5 patients and to inadequate viable left ventricular myocardium in 4 patients. Heart weights were increased in 14 patients (88%). The AMI associated with the VSD was anterior in 9 patients and posterior (inferior) in 7. Healed myocardial infarcts were present in 3 patients. All 16 patients had severe (greater than 75% in cross-sectional area) narrowing of 1 or more of the 4 major epicardial coronary arteries.\r"

The pressure-volume patterns obtained were compared with those observed in vitro with the balloon inflated in materials whose properties simulate stretching (Silastic tubing), compaction (styrofoam) and cracking (dry macaroni). Of 48 narrowings in 46 patients, a pressure-volume pattern of stretching was observed in 56%, compaction in 27% and cracking in only 17%. Of lesions manifesting a stretching pattern, 85% were longer than 5 mm cr had visible calcium deposits, whereas those that compacted were shorter and lacked calcium deposits. Both of these pressure-volume patterns were associated with a successful clinical outcome. Of 8 lesions exhibiting a cracking pattern, 6 showed dissection angiographically; 3 of these resulted in vessel occlusion.\r"

Patients were included in the study if they had successful 1-vessel PTCA, no angiographic restenosis, no reocclusion or late myocardial infarction and 2 serial left ventriculograms of sufficient quality to allow automated contour analysis before and after PTCA. Global ejection fraction increased significantly (from 56% to 60%, p less than 0.05) only after successful dilatation of a stenosis of the left anterior descending coronary artery. Analysis of regional wall displacement showed significant improvement of regional wall motion in the areas supplied by the dilated vessel of either the left anterior descending, the left circumflex or the right coronary artery. Thus, regional myocardial dysfunction due to stunning of the myocardium in patients with unstable angina improves after successful PTCA.\r"

Thus, to achieve major progress in our field of clinical nutrition, data from the molecular, subcellular, cellular, and organ levels need to be exploited and considered in reference to the whole organism; this requires that we identify important unanswered questions for this latter and more complex, hierarchical level of biological organization and then pursue the answers with the aid of techniques and approaches used in and concepts emerging from all areas of modern biology. In relation to this, the present overview of some of the studies that my colleagues, my students, and I have conducted was meant to emphasize that there is considerable merit in attempting to explore the integrative aspects of the physiology and biochemistry of human nutrient metabolism, specifically of amino acids, with the aid of stable-isotope probes. Recognition of the importance of the phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of cellular proteins as a major regulatory process and of the regulation of leucine oxidation through changes in the activity of the branched-chain 2-Oxo acid dehydrogenase complex via a reversible phosphorylation catalyzed by a specific branched-chain dehydrogenase kinase and phosphatase is indeed exciting new knowledge. Following from this, Espinal et al state: \"The activity of the complex determines the rate of degradation and the dietary requirement for branched-chain amino acids.\" However, the physiological situation cannot be appreciated simply in these terms because we showed that the rate of oxidation of leucine depends upon the tissue availability of the amino acid. Furthermore, our studies revealed that the regulation of leucine oxidation in the intact human appears to be achieved through biochemical mechanisms that are linked to the host's nutritional requirements. These observations and interpretations would not have emerged by considering only the enzymology of branched-chain amino acid metabolism; this underscores the value of exploring, through use of safe noninvasive tracer techniques, the communication of amino acid metabolism among different systems and how these systems might interplay to influence the nutritional needs of the individual. This recalls Fishman's advice: \"Physiology has a special role to play here, for after probing the submicroscopic, life is left behind. It is physiology's responsibility to put together the lifeless pieces of the molecular biologist into living systems.\"(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

A decline in circulating Zn concentration begins early in pregnancy and continues to term. The effect of gestational stage on circulating Zn should be incorporated into standards for serum Zn of pregnant women. Low maternal serum Zn levels have been associated with pregnancy-induced hypertension, abnormal parturition, and congenital anomalies. In studies done to date, Zn supplementation of 15-45 mg/d failed to improve pregnancy outcome except for a possible reduction in the incidence of a dysfunctional labor pattern.

This was done in seven subjects on chronic maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) and in seven normal control subjects. The protein breakdown rate in MHD was not different from that in controls (103 +/- 19 and 106 +/- 19 mumol leucine.kg-1.h-1, respectively). In MHD, however, the protein oxidation rate was 43% greater than that in controls (20 +/- 6 and 14 +/- 4 mumol leucine.kg-1.h-1, p less than 0.05), whereas net protein synthesis was less (p less than 0.05). Reduced net synthesis and increased oxidation rates of protein in the postabsorptive state may therefore contribute to the muscle-wasting syndrome in patients with CRF.\r"

Fiber supplements were crackers containing psyllium gum, wheat bran, or a combination of the two fiber sources. After 1 wk on the control cracker, subjects consumed the three high-fiber crackers and the control cracker for 2-wk periods in a balanced design. Gum and combination supplements gave increased bloating and flatulence. Increase in abdominal pain was reported with gum supplement. Mean daily fecal energy was 96 kcal/d with control crackers and was increased by 63 kcal with high-fiber crackers. Gum and combination supplements significantly decreased intake of digestible energy by 153 and 115 kcal/d, respectively. This suppression was not dependent upon fiber intolerance. Wheat bran supplement had no effect on energy intake.\r"

Blood plasma, erythrocyte, and leukocyte AA levels all reflected AA intake, however, plasma AA showed less variability than red cell AA levels and was considerably easier to determine than leukocyte AA. Plasma AA values less than 0.40 mg/dL (23 mumol/L) reflected marginal AA status. The daily AA intake calculated to maintain plasma AA levels of at least 0.4 mg/dL (23 mumol/L) in healthy young men was 41 mg. The average AA intake estimated to maximize the total body pool was 138 mg/d. Urine and salivary AA levels were not useful indicators of AA status because urinary AA levels did not discriminate well between adequate and deficient AA intakes and salivary AA levels did not consistently reflect AA intake.\r"

We have developed a simple, inexpensive screening method for its early laboratory detection based on the fact that one of the earliest laboratory manifestations of hemochromatosis is a reduction in unsaturated iron-binding capacity. The sequential addition of a small measured quantity of saturating iron and bathophenanthroline disulfonate will result in color with highly saturated but not with normal sera. This screening test almost completely differentiated between 40 normal individuals and 40 patients with iron overload (as defined by a transferrin saturation greater than 55%). The test provides a cost-effective method for screening large segments of the population to detect this genetic disorder.\r"

Results indicated that neither the classic serum indices of nutritional assessment nor retinol-binding protein can predict undernutrition. However, creatinine, urea, carotene, complement C3, and prealbumin included in a function enabled high discrimination between groups: 68% of subjects in 0-5th percentile for triceps skinfold and 75% of subjects in 0-5th percentile for midarm circumference are correctly predicted. Lower serum concentration was found in the lower anthropometric percentiles except for serum carotene, which showed an inverse relation not explained by diet. We found that nutritional alterations exist in hospitalized elderly patients. We emphasize the importance of considering several biochemical markers for detection of mal-nutrition and the pertinency of further exploration of serum carotene profiles in undernourished elderly patients.\r"

The authors classified the metaplastic changes into three types: basal cell hyperplasia, stratification, and squamous metaplasia. Secretory component (SC) was detected in all lesions with stratification and in three of ten lesions of squamous metaplasia. Epithelial membrane antigen (EMA) was localized not only on the luminal surfaces but also among the stratified layers of metaplastic epithelium. No carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) was detectable in normal epithelium, whereas almost all metaplastic lesions had both nonspecific cross-reacting antigen (NCA) and CEA immunoreactivity. In normal mucosa, basal cells were strongly positive for alpha-enolase but negative for gamma-enolase, and columnar cells expressed both enolases. In areas of metaplasia, alpha-enolase was present throughout the layer, but gamma-enolase was absent. These immunohistochemical findings suggest that metaplastic squamous epithelial cells have glandular differentiation and that several biochemical and metabolic aberrations occur during the process of metaplasia.\r"

The cells lining papillary projections or cystic spaces were stained with surfactant apoprotein, SC, and EMA. Characteristic round stromal cells, which were considered to be the main component of the sclerosing hemangioma, consisted of immunohistochemically heterogenous cells, that is, positive findings were attained with all three antigens, surfactant apoprotein- and EMA-positive ones, SC- and EMA-positive ones, only EMA-positive ones, and all three negative. When investigating the immunoreactivity of neoplastic type II pneumocytes in bronchioalveolar cell carcinoma and hyperplastic ones in nonneoplastic pulmonary disorders, the authors found that almost all the neoplastic type II pneumocytes had all three antigens. Many of the hyperplastic and normal type II pneumocytes, however, were stained with surfactant apoprotein and EMA but not with SC. The authors' findings add further support for the proposal that sclerosing hemangioma of the lung is epithelial in origin. In view of the various staining patterns found in the stromal cells, sclerosing hemangioma probably consists of immunohistochemically heterogenous epithelial cells. The staining pattern of the cells lining papillary projections or cystic spaces was similar to that of neoplastic type II pneumocytes rather than that of hyperplastic type II pneumocytes.\r"

Two hundred sixteen control patients were treated with standard therapy, and 215 patients were treated with standard therapy plus sodium warfarin. At the time of entry into the study, the most common abnormalities were elevated fibrinogen levels, platelet counts, and fibrinopeptide A levels. Serial studies demonstrated a steady increase in platelet count and fibrinogen levels before death. Anticoagulation lowered FPA levels but had no significant effect on fibrinogen levels, platelet counts, or euglobulin clot lysis times. An unexpected finding was a dramatic increase in fibrin split product levels after institution of anticoagulation (means +/- SEM = 42.6 +/- 116.4 vs. 2.9 +/- 7.0 mg/L in control subjects; P less than 0.02). This study supports the presence of subclinical activation of blood coagulation in most patients with cancer. Moreover, the preferential activation of fibrinolysis in anticoagulated patients suggests a role for a vitamin K-dependent factor(s) in the regulation of fibrinolysis in patients with cancer.\r"

The diagnosis in all cases was confirmed by electron microscopic examination and histochemical stains for neutral mucin (periodic acid-Schiff-diastase) and acid mucin (alcian blue with and without hyaluronidase). AE1, a monoclonal antikeratin antibody that stains most carcinomas, reacted with all six cases of mesothelioma. HMFG-2 and anti-epithelial membrane antigen (antibodies reactive with human milk fat globule proteins), two other closely related antibodies reactive with most carcinomas, also reacted with all of the mesotheliomas in the authors' series. A polyclonal antibody to carcinoembryonic antigen (anti-CEA) did not stain any of the mesotheliomas in their series. Anti-Leu-M1 did not react with the mesotheliomas. The authors conclude that none of these antibodies, when used alone on routinely fixed paraffin-embedded material, is both sensitive and specific in the distinction of mesothelioma from adenocarcinoma. However, immunoperoxidase studies using anti-CEA and anti-Leu-M1 may occasionally be helpful when used in conjunction with other histochemical stains and electron microscopic examination in distinguishing mesothelioma from metastatic adenocarcinoma.\r"

With this procedure, a batch of patient specimens is rejected if either of two criteria are satisfied: (1) the Bull's mean of one of the red blood cell indices is outside its 3% limits, or (2) the average of three consecutive Bull's means is outside its 2% limits. Power function curves were used to summarize the performance of the multirule approach and demonstrated error-detection capabilities that are superior to the more common implementation of Bull's algorithm using 3% limits for single Bull's means. The increased error detection achieved by the multirule procedure allows shifts in hemoglobin and mean corpuscular volume to be more readily detected but also results in the detection of small shifts in red blood cell count. A modified multirule procedure was also tested and was found to be ineffective. The authors recommend the multirule of Levy and colleagues but caution that its use may result in the detection of small shifts in the red blood cell count.\r"

The tumor, from a 53-year-old woman with the syndrome of subcutaneous fat necrosis and arthropathy, was studied histologically, immunohistochemically, ultrastructurally, and biochemically. The clinical features of this case can be explained by the production of large amounts of lipase by the tumor. The hepatocellular properties of the tumor included characteristic morphology and the synthesis of catalase. The pancreatic properties of the tumor included the production of pancreatic lipase. This neoplasm would appear to be analogous to animal models in which the transdifferentiation of pancreatic acinar cells and hepatocytes has been demonstrated. Although the bulk of the tumor was present in the liver, the authors believe the tumor arose from the pancreas. The distinction between differentiation and site of origin of tumors is discussed.\r"

It is proposed that the current consensus strategies for delineating analytic goals in clinical chemistry can be validly used in the other disciplines of clinical pathology. Goals for imprecision are best based upon average intraindividual biologic variation; such goals are more stringent than those previously published. There are many cogent reasons that justify the goal for inaccuracy of no bias. In consequence, goals for imprecision should be viewed as goals for total laboratory error. Further experimental work on biologic variation is required to develop a wider range of goals for hematology and coagulation tests, if these strategies are considered worthy of adoption.\r"

Mean birth weight and head circumference of drug-dependent offspring were reduced symmetrically compared with drug-free controls of similar socioeconomic status. Although mean gestational ages and rates of prematurity were similar, intrauterine growth retardation occurred in 20% of passively addicted infants vs 4% of controls. A longer period of methadone maintenance was associated with longer gestation and increased birth weight, while higher methadone dosages were associated with higher birth weights and larger head circumferences. Smoking was associated with reduced birth weight by an average of 160 g per pack of cigarettes smoked per day; longer duration of smoking was associated with reductions in both birth weight and head circumference. These data suggest therapeutic strategies to improve these fetal growth characteristics and perhaps improve neurobehavioral outcome of drug-dependent newborns.\r"

During the follow-up period (mean, 5 +/- 4.5 years), progressive AR and aortic aneurysm were documented in four patients, progressive MR in three patients, and progressive aortic root dilatation in two patients. Five patients (22%) died during the follow-up period. Among patients with a positive family history of Marfan's syndrome, MR was less frequent as compared with sporadic cases (29.4% vs 75%, respectively). Progressive cardiovascular involvement was more frequent among patients diagnosed before 10 years of age compared with those diagnosed later (60% vs 12.5%, respectively). Cardiovascular involvement was a common feature of childhood Marfan's syndrome, causing significant morbidity and mortality. Sporadic cases and children diagnosed before 10 years of age represented a particularly high-risk group.\r"

Patients received 0.1 U/kg of GH three times per week. Their mean (+/- SD) growth rate increased from 3.3 +/- 1.0 cm/y before treatment to 6.5 +/- 1.4 cm/y after eight months of treatment. The growth rates of five patients declined to below 4.5 cm/y four months after treatment. Three of these patients resumed GH therapy and again responded with increased growth velocity (8.0 +/- 1.2 cm/y). After therapy, the growth rate of five remaining patients continued to be greater than 4.5 cm/y (6.8 +/- 1.4 cm/y). Two of these patients had entered puberty and their posttreatment growth rate might have been due to a pubertal growth spurt. The three prepubertal patients in this group had a gradual decline in growth velocity to 3.8 +/- 1.0 cm/y by the end of 12 posttreatment months. We conclude that maintenance of normal growth in patients with this pattern of GH deficiency is dependent on GH replacement therapy.\r"

Lower capillary values at higher bilirubin levels might be due to the influence of environmental light. As clinical treatment decisions may be made on the basis of differences in serum bilirubin level of about 17 mumol/L (1 mg/dL) and as capillary samples may underestimate venous bilirubin levels by a similar amount, it may be prudent to measure venous rather than capillary bilirubin levels when the total serum bilirubin level exceeds 170 mumol/L (10 mg/dL).\r"

However, in infants presenting with heart failure, the diagnostic signs of CoA may be obscured and more difficult to recognize even when specifically sought.

Its occurrence is almost always preceded by mild-to-moderate head trauma, unlike adult hemophiliacs in whom ICH occurs without prior head injury in 50% of cases. The bleeding event may follow a minor complication of labor or delivery (eg, prolonged second-stage labor or the use of forceps). Recent experience at our institution, a major tertiary care children's hospital, indicates that the diagnosis of hemophilia is often overlooked in a young infant presenting with ICH, a history of perinatal or postnatal head injury, and a prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (PTT). Three young infants with hemophilia (two moderate cases and one severe case) presented with head trauma and were later found to have factor VIII deficiency. Despite prolongation of the preoperative PTT in each case, hemophilia was not considered before neurosurgery was performed. In one case, PTT prolongation was ascribed to tissue thromboplastin-induced intravascular coagulation. There was one death secondary to overwhelming intraventricular hemorrhage and iatrogenic bacterial ventriculitis. Some specific diagnostic and therapeutic recommendations are provided to assist the clinician in evaluating a child with ICH and a prolonged PTT who is in need of immediate neurosurgery.\r"

Among the unreferred cases, in which the cardiac defect was diagnosed only at autopsy, most infants died in the first week of life and had associated problems, such as low birth weight, major noncardiac malformations, or other life-threatening illnesses, but a few infants with potentially remediable heart disease escaped clinical detection. Until preventive measures become available, reduction of infant mortality due to congenital cardiovascular malformations will continue to depend on early recognition of signs of serious heart disease in infants and on effective community-wide use of specialized cardiac services.\r"

DAI is caused by angular or rotational acceleration of the victim's head. The condition is common and is the second most important head injury after subdural hematoma with regard to death. Its clinical picture is characterized by immediate and prolonged coma or demented state. Because of the subtle nature of histological changes in DAI, awareness and intentional search for the lesion is essential. The triad of DAI is as follows: focal lesions (hemorrhages and/or lacerations) in the corpus callosum and brain stem, and microscopic demonstration of axonal damage--retraction balls. The concept of DAI will elucidate and enhance the understanding of many head trauma cases.\r"

A review of the literature of the relationship between murder and SIDS deaths reveals the suspicions of some physicians but few published cases; this reflects not only the difficulties of making a determination of murder by suffocation, since no injuries may be present, but also a lack of awareness among physicians who must evaluate infant deaths. It is recommended that murder should be considered in the differential diagnosis of sudden, unexpected death in infants and that the autopsy should include full-body x-rays and at least an initial look at the social history of the child.\r"

The amount of stimulatory factor transported to the liver, calculated by use of the stimulating activity in portal serum and the portal blood flow, increased after partial hepatectomy. The maximum amount was correlated to the resection ratio (p less than 0.05) and seemed to be correlated to the increase in liver volume.

Portal vein catheterization and portal venous flow measurement were repeated 18 months after therapy in eight patients without a splenorenal shunt before therapy and in two patients with a splenorenal shunt before therapy. Two of the former developed a splenorenal shunt. In these 10 patients, portal venous flow before, one month, and 18 months after therapy was 617 +/- 219, 784 +/- 227, and 720 +/- 224 ml/min, respectively, and in 8 of 10 patients the portal venous flow at 18 months remained similar to the values at one month. Portal vein pressures were not significantly elevated 18 months after therapy (35.4 +/- 6.4 vs. 33.6 +/- 5.1 cm H2O) and the mean portal vein pressure change was 2.75 cm H2O (range -6 to +7.5 cm H2O). To summarize, portal venous flow was significantly increased one month after combined sclerotherapy in cirrhotics, the portal venous flow at 18 months remained similar to the values at 1 month in most patients, and the change in portal vein pressure after therapy was small.\r"

Metoclopramide (10 mg) was administered intravenously to each subject before the second evaluation of GE. We used single and multiexponential models with linear and nonlinear least-squares regression techniques to study the time-course of the disappearance of 99mTc from the stomach. The GE pattern in all subjects was most accurately characterized by nonlinear analysis (NONLIN) and consisted of two components, an initial adynamic phase and a phase of rapid emptying. The GE t1/2 of a liquid meal decreased from 106.6 +/- 58.3 min (mean +/- SD) in all SCI subjects (quadriplegic plus paraplegic) prior to treatment to 21.6 +/- 8.2 min after the intravenous administration of metoclopramide (p less than 0.006). Significant correlations between GE t1/2 and injury duration (yr) or level of spinal injury were observed. Impaired gastric emptying in SCI can be pharmacologically modified by metoclopramide to resemble a normal gastric emptying profile. Metoclopramide-altered gastric emptying in SCI may be expected to result in changes in the therapeutic efficacy of orally administered drugs when drug absorption is dependent on gastric motility or emptying efficiency.\r"

Among eight such patients treated by us, seven developed acute cholecystitis postoperatively, and in one it was discovered during operation for bleeding duodenal ulcer. Two patients had undergone wide excision of the breast; two, highly selective vagotomy; one, nephrolithotomy; one, truncal vagotomy and gastroenterostomy; and one, left hemicolectomy and colostomy. In three patients, urgent cholecystectomy was performed, and four were treated conservatively with subsequent elective cholecystectomy. Histopathological studies revealed acute and chronic cholecystitis in all eight patients and cholelithiasis in four. One patient died in septic shock. Numerous contributing factors have been suggested, including hypovolemia and biliary stasis, as well as the presence of stones. It would appear that chronic cholecystitis or other biliary pathology, as found in our eight patients, is a major factor in the development of this manifestation.\r"

  ".W": "A 29-yr-old man with neurological symptoms that included tremor, dysarthria, and loss of consciousness was diagnosed as having variegate porphyria, because of increased urinary excretion of delta-aminolevulinic acid, porphobilinogen, uroporphyrin, and coproporphyrin, and increased fecal uro-, copro-, and protoporphyrins. He showed marked retention of indocyanine green (R15 min: 53%-78%) and bromosulfophthalein (R45 min: 24%-10%) as well. The kinetic analysis revealed that both hepatic uptake and hepatic excretion were decreased for both dyes. Results of other liver function tests were unremarkable except for intermittent hyperbilirubinemia (0.7-3.3 mg/100 ml), of which the ratio of conjugated and unconjugated fraction was between 0.7 and 1.2. Binding of serum protein and indocyanine green or bromosulfophthalein was normal. An angiographic and scintigraphic study of the liver was normal. A minimal deposition of hemosiderin pigment was found in liver biopsy specimen without other abnormalities. Deposition of porphyrin was not present in the liver. Plasma exchange and erythrocytapheresis did not show any beneficial effects on the clinical and laboratory abnormalities of the patient. A possible relationship between variegate porphyria and defective hepatic anion transport is discussed.\r"

We report an immunodeficient child with chronic cryptosporidiosis of the biliary tract leading to clinical, pathological, and radiographic findings consistent with PSC. This case documents the ability of Cryptosporidium to disseminate to extraintestinal organs, and suggests that chronic cryptosporidial infection of the biliary tract may be one etiological mechanism producing sclerosing cholangitis in immunodeficient children. The increased incidence of PSC in immunodeficient children may in part be due to their inability to resolve infections of the biliary tract, which may result in sclerosing cholangitis mimicking PSC. We submit that an aggressive diagnostic workup should be performed to rule out an infectious etiology of sclerosing cholangitis in immunodeficient patients who have findings of PSC, because specific chemotherapy against the infecting organism would potentially arrest progressive biliary obliteration.\r"

  ".W": "Whether bicarbonate dialysis (BiHD) improves left ventricular (LV) function more than acetate dialysis (AcHD) and whether AcHD exerts a negative inotropic effect remains controversial. To address this question, the LV contractile responses to both dialysate buffers were tested in six stable chronic dialysis patients not taking any cardiac or antihypertensive medicines. The patients were studied with echocardiography before and after an isovolemic dialysis (no weight change) with either buffer, and neither heart rate nor blood pressure were significantly altered during either procedure. The patients were studied at three different filling volumes so that LV function curves could be constructed. Both dialysates were associated with comparable and significant changes in LV end systolic volume (AcHD, 55 +/- 5 to 49 +/- 5 mL, P less than .001; BiHD, 56 +/- 5 to 49.5 +/- 5 mL, P less than .001), stroke volume (AcHD, 88 +/- 7 to 97 +/- 5 mL, P less than .01; BiHD, 89 +/- 7 to 97 +/- mL, P less than .05), and LV ejection fraction (AcHD, 60 +/- 7% to 65 +/- 8%, P less than .05; BiHD, 60 +/- 3 to 67 +/- 2%, P less than .001). In addition, the mean velocity of circumferential fiber shortening (VCF), an index of ventricular contractility, also increased significantly after dialysis with both dialysates (AcHD, .96 +/- .08 to 1.20 +/- .15, P less than .001; BiHD, .93 +/- .09 to 1.29 +/- .11, P less than .001). Finally, both dialysates were associated with upward shifts in the LV function curve of a similar magnitude.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The course of 93 children, treated with continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) and continuous cycling peritoneal dialysis (CCPD) over a total of 1,819 months, was evaluated retrospectively regarding hernia development. Thirty-seven patients (40%) developed 60 hernias (one per 30 patient-months), of which 36 were ventral, 7 umbilical, 14 inguinal, and 3 scrotal. Hernia occurrence was inversely correlated to patient's age and duration of CAPD/CCPD. The rate of hernia development was highest within the first 3 months following initiation of CAPD/CCPD with a subsequent rapid decrease. The dialysate inflow volume was not related to hernia development. The only complication due to the presence of a hernia was one episode of incarceration of the small bowel that required immediate surgical intervention. Surgical repair was the treatment performed in 75% of the cases. The remaining hernias were managed with volume reduction, conversion from CAPD to CCPD, or discontinuation of the daytime dialysate dwell in patients undergoing CCPD. Our observations suggest that hernia development is a frequent complication in children treated with CAPD/CCPD.\r"

In only three instances could factors predisposing to fungal peritonitis be identified. We were unable to predict who would develop fungal peritonitis by analysis of nutritional, demographic, or technical factors associated with the dialysis procedure. The diagnosis of fungal peritonitis was easily established using routine blood agar culture techniques. Successful management of these patients included prompt removal of the Tenckhoff catheter and intravenous (IV) administration of amphotericin.\r"

Human lymphocytes were concurrently treated with aphidicolin, for determination of fragile site expression, and with 5-bromodeoxy-uridine, for SCE analysis. Aphidicolin induced chromosome gaps nonrandomly, with the great majority of gaps occurring at common fragile sites. On average, 66% of gaps were accompanied by an SCE at the site of the lesion. Analysis of two specific common fragile sites at 3p14 and 16q23 showed the same pattern; that is, on average 70% of gaps at these sites were accompanied by an SCE. These results show that common fragile sites are hot spots not only for chromosomal lesions such as gaps but also for SCE formation.\r"

The chromosomal locations of the aldolase genes provide insight into their tissue-specific and developmentally regulated expression and evolution. DNA probes for the human aldolase-A and -C genes and for an aldolase pseudogene were used to quantify and map the aldolase loci in the haploid human genome. Genomic hybridization of restriction fragments determined that all the aldolase genes exist in single copy in the haploid human genome. Spot-blot analysis of sorted chromosomes mapped human aldolase A to chromosome 16, aldolase C to chromosome 17, the pseudogene to chromosome 10; it previously had mapped the aldolase-B gene to chromosome 9. All loci are unlinked and located on to two pairs of morphologically similar chromosomes, a situation consistent with tetraploidization during isozymic and vertebrate evolution. Sequence comparisons of expressed and flanking regions support this conclusion. These locations on similar chromosome pairs correctly predicted that the aldolase pseudogene arose when sequences from the aldolase-A gene were inserted into the homologous aldolase location on chromosome 10.\r"

Allele frequency distributions show a tendency toward a deficit in diversity for HRAS-1 and a slight excess diversity for D14S1. The direction of these departures is consistent with potential selective effects of the Harvey-ras oncogene and hitchhiking of the D14S1 locus to closely linked immunoglobulin genes. Direct chi 2-tests of goodness of fit of the observed and expected allele frequency distributions reveal significant departures in the caucasoid and Hispanic HRAS-1 distributions but not in any of the other tests.\r"

Although commonly subacute in presentation, complications of endocarditis were frequent: arterial emboli in five patients, new electrocardiographic conduction system abnormalities in nine, congestive heart failure in eight, annular or myocardial abscesses in five, and disruption of valve leaflets in three. Cures were achieved in 10 of 12 patients treated medically and seven of nine treated surgically. In microbiologic studies of 16 coagulase-negative staphylococci from patients with endocarditis, only eight were identified as Staphylococcus epidermidis. All isolates were susceptible to vancomycin. Antibiotic resistance (methicillin, four isolates; gentamicin, two isolates; rifampin, one isolate) was usually associated with nosocomial acquisition of endocarditis. Rather than representing contamination, coagulase-negative staphylococci in blood cultures may indicate life-threatening endocarditis. However, with careful attention to the selection of antibiotics for therapy and to the occurrence of heart failure due to intracardiac complications, treatment of this form of endocarditis is frequently successful. Organisms must always be tested for cryptic resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics. Valve replacement may be required frequently.\r"

The percentage of cases caused by staphylococci and streptococci were roughly equal in all groups. Enterococci, Streptococcus bovis, and coagulase-negative staphylococci were more common in the elderly. In the elderly, invasive vascular procedures were the most common source of infection. Endocarditis acquired nosocomially accounted for 23 percent of all episodes in older patients. The elderly reported fewer symptoms and showed a diminished febrile response. Errors in diagnosis were noted in 68 percent of elderly patients, and a delay in initiating appropriate therapy was more common in this age group. The mortality rate was significantly higher in the elderly (45.3 percent) than in the middle-aged (32.6 percent) and young (9.1 percent). Endocarditis in elderly patients is often nosocomially acquired, is difficult to diagnose, and is associated with a higher mortality than noted in younger patients.\r"

In a retrospective study of 137 patients referred to our hypertension clinic in the past 10 years for primary aldosteronism, four cases of adrenocortical carcinoma were identified. The clinical presentation of these patients was similar to that of patients with Conn's adenoma, but preoperatively, malignant tumoral primary aldosteronism was suspected because of profound hypokalemia, marked elevation in plasma aldosterone levels, and enlarged size and weight of an heterogenous adrenal tumor with internal calcifications. Malignancy was confirmed by the histologic features. No prognostic criteria could be established and two patients died despite specific surgery, which was performed in all cases. More recent developments in the use of mitotane led to the addition of adrenocorticolytic therapy in the remaining two patients, who are still alive at the time of this report.\r"

These lipoprotein alterations are of interest because of their possible role in the origin of the accelerated atherosclerosis found in diabetes. Because of the link between lipoproteins and diabetes, serum lipids and lipoproteins were measured in 215 middle-aged patients (107 female, 108 male) with varying degrees of glucose tolerance: control subjects, subjects with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), and patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). In male subjects, levels of fasting total triglycerides were significantly greater in those with NIDDM compared with control subjects. In female subjects, fasting total cholesterol levels were significantly greater in NIDDM compared with IGT. Both high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and HDL2 cholesterol values were significantly lower in both sexes with NIDDM compared with control subjects. Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels were elevated in the male subjects with IGT. No differences in HDL cholesterol or its subfractions were seen in both sexes with IGT compared with control subjects. Bivariate analyses showed that the reduced HDL cholesterol and HDL subfraction levels were most closely associated with both total triglycerides and weight. This study shows that reduced HDL cholesterol and HDL2 cholesterol levels occur in NIDDM, whereas persons with \"impaired glucose tolerance\" do not have the dramatic alterations in HDL levels.\r"

Despite similar clinical presentations, the bursae of immunocompromised patients took three times longer to sterilize and had a much higher bursal white blood cell count when compared with the bursae of non-immunocompromised patients. The bacteriologic spectrum was essentially identical in both groups; there were no cases in which gram-negative organisms were recovered from infected bursae. No cases of septic bursitis were seen in neutropenic patients. The most common factors contributing to an immunocompromised state were alcoholism or steroid therapy. A successful resolution of septic bursitis was seen in all the patients in the immunocompromised groups.\r"

  ".W": "In order to identify the changes in pulmonary function and in the flow-volume loop due to respiratory muscle weakness, two groups of 10 nonsmokers with stable, chronic neuromuscular disease but without respiratory symptoms were studied: one without (Group 1) and one with (Group 2) respiratory muscle weakness as assessed by measurement of maximal static inspiratory and expiratory pressures. In Group 1, pulmonary function was normal except for increased ratio of one-second forced expiratory volume to forced vital capacity and forced expiratory flow at 25 to 75 percent forced vital capacity, which may reflect increased elastic lung recoil. Group 2 had mild volume restriction, appropriate for the degree of respiratory muscle weakness, and reduced inspiratory and expiratory flow rates. Pulmonary function was significantly more disturbed in Group 2 than in Group 1, and correlated well with maximal static inspiratory and expiratory pressures. Analysis of the flow-volume loop configuration revealed that four parameters describing effort-dependent portions were significantly related to maximal static inspiratory pressure and maximal static expiratory pressure. These parameters were peak expiratory flow, the slope of the ascending limb of the maximal expiratory curve, a drop of forced expiratory flow near residual volume, and forced inspiratory flow at 50 percent of vital capacity. A flow-volume loop score obtained from these four parameters was significantly higher in Group 2 than in Group 1 (2.8 +/- 1.03 versus 1.1 +/- 1.37; p less than 0.01). A flow-volume loop score of 2 or more had 80 percent specificity and 90 percent sensitivity in predicting respiratory muscle weakness in these patients with chronic neuromuscular disease. These data suggest that sensitive assessment of the flow-volume loop configuration as part of routine pulmonary function testing may help to suspect and identify respiratory muscle weakness.\r"

The clinical course of nine patients who died from overwhelming cytomegalovirus sepsis was reviewed. Viral septicemia was associated with increased cardiac index, decreased systemic vascular resistance index (SVRI), and elevated oxygen delivery. This pattern appeared during early and late stages of shock. In contrast to bacterial sepsis and endotoxemia, the pulmonary vascular resistance index (PVRI) was normal. These results indicate that overwhelming viral infection can produce shock associated with a high cardiac output, low peripheral resistance state similar to that seen with bacterial shock. Relative sparing of the pulmonary circulation in viral shock is consistent with the absence of endotoxemia in these patients.\r"

Disease severity was scored by the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II system. Physicians' prior impressions of prognostic factors were compared with the actual results of this study. Most patients were middle-aged men with respiratory diseases. Fifty-nine patients (76 percent) died in the hospital. Survivors of hospitalization and nonsurvivors had similar age, diagnoses, emergency intubations, duration of ventilation, and pH and oxygen tension after 24 hours of ventilation. However, only one of 31 patients with a serum albumin level of 2.5 g/dl or less at the initiation of mechanical ventilation survived (p less than 0.001). Of 24 patients requiring a fractional inspired oxygen concentration greater than 50 percent at 24 hours, none survived (p less than 0.005). At all APACHE II scores, the mortality rates documented in this study were higher than predicted. Physicians overestimated the impact of several variables, including age and presence of pneumonia, on mortality. At the San Francisco Veterans Administration Medical Center, a low serum albumin level may aid in the decision whether to begin mechanical ventilation, and a high fractional inspired oxygen concentration at 24 hours may aid in the decision regarding further aggressive care. These findings need to be validated in other patients before being applied. Conversely, certain older patients, and those undergoing emergency intubation or intubation for a prolonged time, may have as good a prognosis as patients without these factors.\r"

Patients with an initial diagnosis of a cardiovascular cause of syncope had a recurrence rate of 31 percent, patients with a noncardiovascular cause had a recurrence rate of 36 percent, and patients with syncope of unknown origin had a recurrence rate of 43 percent at three years (these differences were not significant; the minimum for any two-way comparison was p greater than or equal to 0.11). In eight of the 191 patients in whom a cause of syncope could not be found on initial evaluation, a diagnosis was assigned in follow-up after recurrent syncope. Recurrences led to major morbidity in eight of 146 patients (5 percent) and minor trauma in 10 patients (7 percent). Using recurrence as a time-dependent variable in the Cox models, it was found that this variable was not a significant predictor of overall mortality or sudden death. It is concluded that recurrences are common in patients with syncope, but new diagnosis are rarely established on the basis of evaluation of recurrences. Recurrences are not predictors of mortality or sudden death.\r"

To evaluate the clinical significance of this marker the systemic alterations and clinical features of 26 patients with acanthosis nigricans seen at two institutions were reviewed. Most subjects affected by acanthosis nigricans were female (20 patients), Caucasian (22 patients), in the third decade of life (13 patients), and overweight (24 patients greater than 120 percent ideal body weight). Gonadal disease, present in 17 patients, was expressed as polycystic ovary syndrome (11 cases), disorders of prolactin secretion (two cases, one with polycystic ovary syndrome), streak gonads (one case), and hypogonadism of the male (four cases). Thyroid disease and tinea versicolor were present in four patients each. Three patients were receiving insulin therapy for diabetes mellitus, and in two additional patients diabetes mellitus was detected during the diagnostic workup. All patients had elevated fasting insulin levels; most of them also had an exaggerated insulin response to a glucose load. Two of 18 patients tested had antibodies against the insulin receptor in the circulation. Skin biopsy of acanthosis nigricans lesions from all 26 patients showed a typical pattern of hyperkeratosis, acanthosis, and epidermal papillomatosis. Colloidal iron staining showed glycosaminoglycan infiltration of the papillary dermis (21 of 21 cases), consisting mainly of hyaluronic acid. It is concluded that: (1) hyperinsulinenemia and local dermal glycosaminoglycan deposition are regular features in acanthosis nigricans and (2) patients with acanthosis nigricans should be screened for diabetes mellitus, gonadal disease, and hypothyroidism.\r"

An elevated serum thyroid-stimulating hormone level, however, suggested that they had primary hypothyroidism and probably pituitary enlargement secondary to pituitary hyperplasia. Detailed evaluation of thyroid-stimulating hormone and prolactin secretion was performed. These studies revealed several abnormalities in dopamine-prolactin interactions; however, the primary event responsible for the hyperprolactinemia is unclear. These women were given thyroxine therapy, and subsequent radiologic and endocrine studies documented resolution of their \"pseudotumors\" and normalization of the serum thyroxine and prolactin levels. Hence, thyroid-stimulating hormone levels should be measured in all patients presenting with a suspected prolactinoma so that any hypothyroidism that is noted is not presumed to be due to secondary hypothyroidism from tumor involvement of the pituitary.\r"

Extensive venous thrombosis developed requiring hospitalization and anticoagulation. Thus, polycythemia itself may be a cause of major morbidity in patients with pheochromocytoma, and prophylactic measures may be warranted. Review of the 130 patients with benign and malignant pheochromocytoma studied since the introduction of I-131-metaiodobenzylguanidine in 1980 revealed another six patients with hematocrits over 50 but only one had a hematocrit greater than 55 and required regular phlebotomy.

The patient was ventilator-dependent and quadriplegic throughout most of his hospital stay and died in the hospital 10 months after the onset of paralysis. \"Vaccine-like\" type 3 poliovirus was isolated from a stool specimen and his serum showed a significant rise in neutralizing antibody titer against type 3 virus. This case report represents the first documented case of vaccine-associated poliomyelitis in a household contact receiving glucocorticosteroids, although evidence of immunosuppression was not documented. Nevertheless, the case reinforces current recommendations not to administer oral poliovirus vaccine to persons known to be immune deficient or suppressed or to normal persons with close contacts known to be immune deficient or suppressed.\r"

This report illustrates a case that mimicked fulminant Rocky Mountain spotted fever in a patient with no other medical problems that might predispose her to the development of staphylococcal sepsis. Epidemiology, cerebrospinal fluid characteristics, and early biopsy of skin lesions are emphasized as important factors leading to early diagnosis and definitive treatment.\r"
