Follow-up periods ranged from 2 to 14 years, with an average of 6 years. Of 110 patients, 29 suffered neurologic deterioration. In most of the patients, deterioration occurred within the first year after surgery. Causes of deterioration were divided into three categories: direct trauma to neural tissue during surgery (a preventable complication); instability of the spine, progression of spondylotic changes above or below the level of fusion, and non-union (apparently unpreventable but treatable); and nonsurgery-related accidental trauma (unavoidable and often irreversible). Countermeasures for the deterioration are discussed.\r"

One of the Harrington cases had a previous history of spontaneous chylothorax that had been managed surgically. The other cases of chylothorax observed after a Harrington operation was bilateral and probably caused by the central venous catheter. All cases were treated conservatively, and the duration of the chylothorax varied from 1 to 18 days.\r"

The Hypochondriasis (Hs), Depression (D), Hysteria (Hy), Psychopathic Deviate (Pd), Psychasthenia (Pt), and Schizophrenia (Sc) scales were found to be predictive of surgical outcome in the herniation group. However, no MMPI scale was related to outcome in the stenosis group. Analysis of covariance showed this fact to be related to the differences in age between the two groups of patients, rather than a result of the differing diagnoses. The MMPI appears to be more useful in predicting surgical outcome in the young and middle-aged adult patient population with disc herniation and is not of predictive utility in the older stenosis population.\r"

Important considerations are starting the rehabilitative program as early as possible after injury and avoiding techniques that unduly immobilize the patient or parts of the body. The use of early active motion to the patient and all movable joints, along with appropriate positioning while at rest, is crucial to a successful program. Passive exercising along with the use of restraints and splints is necessary in certain patients.\r"

Fifteen symptomatic patients with total occlusion of the internal carotid artery underwent ECA reconstruction. Ipsilateral ECA reconstruction was performed upon all patients with no mortality or neurologic deficits. Contralateral disease of the carotid artery was noted in 11 and required correction in seven patients. Follow-up study of the patients ranged from one to 68 months (a mean of 26.8 months) after operation. Vertebrobasilar symptoms persisted in two patients, both with contralateral disease. One of these patients successfully underwent extracranial-intracranial bypass. One ipsilateral and one contralateral stroke occurred during follow-up study, both in patients with contralateral disease. Eleven patients were alive and asymptomatic at last follow-up examination. Symptomatic selected patients with occlusion of the internal carotid artery and ECA stenosis or cul-de-sac formation should be considered for operation. ECA reconstruction is associated with little morbidity and three-fourths of the patients remain asymptomatic. A high incidence of contralateral disease of the carotid artery is present. Extracranial-intracranial bypass should only be considered when symptoms persist after correction of contralateral disease of the carotid artery and any ECA lesions.\r"

In patients with Stage IIIB disease, the melanoma specific cumulative survival rates at five years was 72 per cent for one, 33 per cent for two to three and 20 per cent for four or more positive lymph nodes. In patients with Stage IIIAB disease, those with one node had a better survival rate at five years than those with multiple nodes (45 versus 25 per cent). In patients with Stage IIIA melanoma, two groups were identified based upon the results of prior treatment--those with and without prophylactic lymph node dissection (PLND) at the time of primary therapy. The factors associated with decreased survival rates in patients with PLND were: 1, increasing age; 2, presence of subcutaneous or both subcutaneous and dermal metastases, and 3, treatment at normothermic temperatures or earlier date of treatment. No significant factors were found in the group without PLND; however, the survival time was similar to that for patients with Stage IIIAB and one positive node (45 per cent at five years). Knowledge of these factors is important in assessing the prognosis and establishing randomization criteria for prospective studies evaluating various forms of therapy.\r"

Most patients were diagnosed during in-hospital investigations. Many were also found to be hypercalcemic at regular outpatient controls. At operation, adenomas were found in 80 per cent, different kinds of hyperplasia in 15 per cent, normal histologic finding in 4 per cent, while cancer was found in less than 1 per cent of the patients. At follow-up study, 79 per cent were normocalcemic while 3 per cent were hypocalcemic and 11 per cent were still hypercalcemic--7.5 per cent were lost to follow-up study.

There were no differences between the groups in any of the preoperative measurements, the duration of operation, operative blood loss or transfusion requirement. The RL group required 9.5 liters of fluid intraoperatively as compared with 6.3 liters required by the HSL group (p less than 0.01). There was no significant difference between the groups in the amount of sodium infused to achieve resuscitation or in the sodium balance at the end of the study period. Hypernatremia (average maximum serum sodium: 157 milliequivalents per liter) and hyperosmolarity (average maximum serum osmolarity: 320 milliosmoles per liter) resolved in the HSL group within 48 hours. Correction of the hyperosmolar state was thought to be due to the judicious administration of free water and a decrease in renal free water clearance. The HSL group required significantly greater potassium administration during the early postoperative period due to increased kaluresis. HSL is safe and effective for use in the resuscitation of moderate blood volume deficit. Changes in serum sodium values and in osmolarity resolve rapidly. The serum potassium level should be monitored closely and replaced aggressively.\r"

Incorporation of silver along with the antibiotic enhances the antibacterial activity and prolongs retention of the antibiotics in the prosthetic grafts. Silver mediated bonding appears to release the antibiotic biphasically. In the initial phase (40 to 50 per cent), the drug is rapidly released and, in the second phase, the rest is diffused gradually enabling the graft to retain antibacterial activity for a longer period of time.\r"

Forty-eight patients were not considered suitable for operation due to their poor general status and spread of disease. One hundred and five patients underwent simple exploratory laparotomy, 80 underwent bypass procedure and 61, noncurative resection, and the operative mortality rate was 4.7, 10.0 and 11.5 per cent, respectively. Median survival time was 2.4 months for patients who did not undergo an operation, 2.8 months after exploratory laparotomy and 3.5 months after bypass procedures. Median survival time after nonradical resections was 8.0 months and 6 per cent of these patients survived for more than five years. To perform the analysis within relatively homogeneous groups, patients with different treatments were further stratified into three groups according to the spread of disease: local, distant and local plus distant spread. It is noteworthy that the benefit after bypass procedures in comparison to exploratory laparotomy was limited to those patients with local spread of disease; the advantage of nonradical resection was apparent in all groups. Survival time was finally analyzed with reference to the extent of liver involvement in patients with metastatic disease confined to the liver. The data suggest that a limited sporadic survival time is possible only after gastric resection in patients with liver involvement of less than 50 per cent.\r"

Preliminary endoscopic biliary drainage succeeded in lowering the biliary pressure and the incidence of bacteremia in patients in group 2. In contrast, for those in group 1, it failed to reduce the intrabiliary pressure and, thus, in the presence of bile infection led to an increased incidence of bacteremia. From the results of the present study, preliminary endoscopic biliary drainage is recommended for patients with distal malignant biliary obstruction. For those with proximal malignant biliary obstruction, surgical drainage appears to be the method of choice.\r"

In addition, it can be conveniently used with a Menghini or Jamshidi needle for aspiration biopsy of other tissues. Finally, since the syringe plunger throw is adjustable, the device can be used in a clinical laboratory for the repeated sampling of identical aliquots of fluid.\r"

Forty-seven instances involving the adrenal gland have been published since 1925; five, including the present patient, have occurred since 1981. Confusion concerning the site of the androgen secretion has been generated in the past because of limited roentgenographic study and the poor predicability of selective suppression or stimulating testing of the adrenal gland and the ovary. Of the 22 patients with testosterone producing neoplasms of the adrenal cortex reported since 1973, 45 per cent underwent needless ovarian surgical treatment prior to the correct diagnosis. By recognizing the significant correlation between a serum testosterone of 200 nanograms per deciliter or greater, a serum dehydroepiandrostenone of greater than 6,600 nanograms per milliliter coupled with a thorough pelvic examination, pelvic ultrasound and a more liberal use of high resolution computerized tomography of the adrenal gland, the correct diagnosis can be made. The patient presented herein illustrates the pitfalls inherent in the management of a patient with this problem.\r"

Ten patients were operated upon electively; one of these died as a direct consequence of excision of the arteriovenous malformation--a female patient with an arteriovenous malformation of the corpus callosum. One other patient in this category expired 3.5 months after the removal of the arteriovenous malformation, from unrelated infectious complications arising from a preoperational ventriculo-peritoneal shunting procedure. Two patients were operated upon on an emergency basis because of an associated intraparenchymal hematoma; both of these patients died. All surgical survivors are leading independent lives. The postoperative observation period ranges from 6 months to more than 17.5 years, with an average of 6.6 years. Of the seven patients treated by nonsurgical means, one was hospitalized in a coma after rupture of the arteriovenous malformation and died shortly after admission; another--a girl in the fifth month of her first pregnancy--was admitted in a stupor and expired from a recurrent subarachnoid hemorrhage 3 weeks after the first occurrence. Five nonsurgical patients left the hospital in good condition, but one died at home 2 years later from intractable cardiorespiratory insufficiency associated with an aneurysm of the vein of Galen.\r"

The incidence of SFC was highest in aneurysm surgery (47%), followed by neurovascular decompression (27%) and brain tumor surgery (22%). In aneurysm surgery, preoperative ventricular dilatation seemed to promote the occurrence of SFC. In tumor surgery, SFC occurred more frequently when the tumor existed in the sellar region. The SFCs decreased or disappeared in most cases on sequential CT scans, but increased in 27 cases. In the latter, maximum thickness of the SFC was seen between 20 and 30 postoperative days. Nineteen of the 27 cases had preoperative ventricular dilatation. Operation for SFC was performed in four cases with clinical symptoms and signs. Three of 169 cases developed into chronic subdural hematomas.\r"

Following injury, extradural electrodes attached to receiver-stimulators that were implanted subcutaneously were placed proximal and distal to the injury site. The animals were maintained in cages with electromagnetic fields created by encircling antennae. The control animals were in a field adjusted to a frequency below the sensitive frequency range of the receiver-stimulators so that they received no spinal cord stimulation. After 15-20 weeks of continuous spinal cord stimulation, histological sections of the cords were assessed and scored blindly for pathological changes including magnitude and extent of cord injury, and cystic cavitation, and for regenerative changes including proliferation of axons, Schwann cells and ependymal cells, and formation of myelin. In all 20 animals, there was a complete absence of normal cord tissue at the injury site, and cystic cavitation was frequently present at the injury site and beyond. Extensive regenerative changes were seen in all animals including regeneration of axons, Schwann cells and ependymal cells, and formation of myelin. Statistical analysis did not show a significant difference between treatment and control groups.\r"

However, in recent years, functional isolation of the lateral ventricle has been seen with increasing frequency. Since 1979, eight patients without evidence of infection have required treatment for an isolated lateral ventricle following insertion of a contralateral ventriculoperitoneal shunt at the Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Two of these patients developed their hydrocephalus after intraventricular hemorrhage, and in six patients the hydrocephalus was associated with myelodysplasia. We specifically excluded patients in whom isolation of the lateral ventricle was secondary to ventriculitis. We feel that the isolated lateral ventricle following ventriculoperitoneal shunting may be due to a dynamic situation where overdrainage of the shunted ventricle leads to a functional obliteration of the foramen of Monro and subsequent enlargement of the contralateral lateral ventricle.\r"

  ".W": "Many investigators have concluded that hemoglobin is the spasmogen responsible for cerebral vasospasm. The present study was designed to ascertain whether the contractile responses of isolated canine basilar arteries to xanthochromic cerebrospinal fluid from subarachnoid hemorrhage patients was associated with hemoglobin concentration as measured spectrophotometrically. The results clearly showed that spasmogenicity and hemoglobin content were not correlated. The magnitude and duration of the arterial responses varied greatly, further indicating that more than a single factor was responsible. The potent antagonistic, vasodilator effect of such proteins as antithrombin III may account for some of the variation, but the results directly complement clinical findings of others indicating that hemoglobin is not the singular cause of cerebral vasospasm.\r"

  ".U": "87120792\r", 
  ".W": "Experimental investigations have suggested an important role of arachidonic acid metabolites in the genesis of cerebral vasospasm following subarachnoid hemorrhage. In this clinical study the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum levels of the two main arachidonic acid metabolites prostacyclin and thromboxane A2 are evaluated by measuring their stable degradation products 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha (6-keto-PGF1 alpha) and thromboxane B2 (TXB2) using radioimmunoassay methods during the pre- and postoperative course in patients after aneurysm rupture. Although the serum levels of both substances do not seem to be important for the clinical course of the patients, the CSF concentrations of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha and TXB2 provide important data. A close correlation between the initial TXB2 level of the individual patient and the amount of blood in the basal cisterns as detected by computed tomography scan can be demonstrated. The predictive value of this additional information for the occurrence of cerebral angiospasm is discussed. Comparing the CSF levels of both metabolites the slight preoperative elevation of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha is significantly surmounted by an extraordinary rise in TXB2 concentration. Postoperatively, after cleavage of the basal cisterns there is a decline in the CSF levels of both substances. The pre- and postoperative clinical course in comparison to the CSF levels of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha and TXB2 is demonstrated in four patients. A nearly normal course of TXB2 and 6-keto-PGF1 alpha seems to be associated with an uneventful clinical course, whereas a high TXB2 level--whether occurring preoperatively or, even more important, as a secondary postoperative rise--seems to be associated with ischemic complications and neurological deterioration. It is suggested that pre- and postoperative monitoring of CSF levels of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha and especially TXB2 may serve as a possible indicator for the detection of patients at risk of developing cerebral vasospasm.\r"

There was no difference in the admission WBC counts between patients who subsequently deteriorated due to ischemic complications and those who did not. However, the cell count rose significantly at the time of the clinical manifestations of ischemia, possibly as a result of structural damage of brain tissue and/or increased sympathetic and adrenocortical activity. The possible contribution of leukocytes to the pathogenesis of ischemic damage following subarachnoid hemorrhage--perhaps through the release of leukotrienes--will require further investigation.\r"

Thus far it has been reported in only nine Caucasian patients in the American literature. Two case reports are presented, one typifying ICSC, the other typifying ICSC with bullous retinal detachment. Although both entities probably share the same pathophysiologic mechanism, they are distinct in terms of diagnostic features and treatment.

Instead, a variety of behavioral techniques have been used, with varying degrees of success. These techniques will be described and evaluated with regard to adequacy of norms, percent testable rates, test times, accuracy and similarity to adult standards of visual acuity assessment. Practical suggestions regarding the use of existing techniques and the development of new visual acuity assessment techniques for 15- to 35-month-olds will be given.\r"

A devastating side effect of this treatment is radiation-associated small bowel injury (RASBI). The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that removal of the small bowel from the radiation field would protect it against RASBI. Twenty cebus monkeys underwent low anterior resection. In 10 animals an absorbable polyglycolic acid (PGA) mesh was sewn circumferentially around the interior of the abdominal cavity as a supporting apron, which prevented the small bowel's descent into the pelvis. The other 10 monkeys did not receive the mesh. All animals received 2000 rads by linear acceleration in a single dose. Twenty-four-hour stool fat, serum vitamin B12, and other serum values were obtained during the study. Animals were sacrificed after 1, 2, 3, 6, and 12 months, and the small bowel and rectum were examined histologically in a blind manner. Two monkeys who did not undergo surgery, or exposure to radiation served as controls. At all sacrifice periods, the animals with PGA mesh slings demonstrated normal small bowel function and histologic structure. Animals without mesh slings had abnormal stool and blood values at 1 month, and by 2 months all had died of small bowel necrosis. The animals that received the slings had no evidence of infection or obstruction, and by 6 months all evidence of the mesh was gone. Support of the small bowel out of the pelvis by an absorbable PGA mesh sling protects against RASBI and is without apparent complications.\r"

Nailfold velocity, before and after cold provocation, was decreased in all patients (p less than 0.001). The findings in this study support the conclusion that patients with primary and secondary Raynaud's phenomenon, acrocyanosis, or asphyxia digitorum can be distinguished by combining hemorheologic observations with morphologic and functional microscopic investigations of the nailfold capillaries. The nomenclature currently employed in our clinic can be used to define these different phenomena.\r"

The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between the extent of CAD observed in coronary angiograms (more than 50% stenosis) and the frequency of postoperative myocardial ischemic complications in a consecutive series of 84 patients who underwent elective AAA repair. Ninety-four percent of the patients with clinical evidence of CAD had significant disease as observed in coronary angiograms and eight patients had left main CAD. Seventy-two patients underwent AAA repair with a mortality rate of 1.4%; five patients had preliminary myocardial revascularization, and AAA surgery was not recommended for four patients because of severe cardiac disease. Postoperative myocardial ischemic complications occurred in 13.4% of the patients who had undergone surgery--almost exclusively in patients with clinical evidence of CAD. Both myocardial ischemia and preoperative intervention were more frequent in patients with double- or triple-vessel disease than in patients with less extensive disease. Patients with symptoms and with double- or triple-vessel CAD have a high risk of developing myocardial ischemia after AAA surgery. Preliminary myocardial revascularization may be beneficial in this group of patients.\r"

  ".W": "Reduction of blood loss from a vascular anastomosis, especially when one is using a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) graft, is of great interest; even when a technically perfect anastomosis has been performed, there can still be significant and often bothersome bleeding from the needle holes. Currently, sutures have a needle-to-suture ratio of 2:1 or 3:1. Two new sutures, one made of PTFE and the other of polypropylene, were designed to have a needle-to-suture diameter ratio of 1:1. Theoretically, this allows the suture to completely fill the graft needle hole and control bleeding. These sutures were evaluated in a heparin-treated canine in vivo model to measure graft needle-hole bleeding. The materials were also tested by an independent laboratory to compare the basic physical characteristics. Twenty centimeters of 6 mm PTFE graft was interposed in an end-to-end fashion to the infrarenal canine aorta. The graft was then transected at its midpoint and a series of end-to-end, graft-to-graft anastomoses were performed with alternate experimental and control sutures. The experimental PTFE suture bled a mean of 12.46 ml per anastomosis. The experimental polypropylene bled 4.32 ml per anastomosis, while a control suture of polypropelene with a needle-to-suture ratio of 1.94 (5-0 prolene with a C-1 needle), produced a mean blood loss of 33.35 ml per anastomosis. These data are based on a total of 82 anastomoses. The results were analyzed with a two-tailed paired t test. As the data indicate, both experimental sutures allowed significantly less bleeding than the controls (p = .05). The testing of physical properties of the suture included diameter, tensile strength, needle pull-off strength, and elongation percent and were performed by an independent laboratory. These findings are included along with subjective evaluations of the sutures' handling qualities. We believe that sutures produced with needle-to-suture ratios of 1:1 greatly reduce graft needle-hole bleeding and will be a useful addition to the vascular surgeon's armamentarium.\r"

Its appearance is often followed by a rapid physical deterioration. Nonsurgical attempts to control the ascites are often unsuccessful. Four patients with refractory ascites were treated with Denver peritoneovenous shunts (DPVS). These patients suffered from ventilatory failure, anorexia with malnutrition, and hypotension during hemodialysis. Patients were followed for as long as 18 months after DPVS, and all experienced clinical resolution of the ascites. Ventilatory failure, malnutrition, and hypotension either improved or resolved after shunting. Shunt-related morbidity occurred in all patients and consisted of mechanical complications in four patients and bacteremia in one patient. These problems were resolved by either revision or removal of the DPVS. No deaths were directly related to shunting. Peritoneovenous shunting successfully treats nephrogenic ascites and reverses the morbid sequelae usually associated with this syndrome.\r"

It comprises less than 5% of surgically correctable causes of portal hypertension and can be one of the most difficult to treat. Recurrent Budd-Chiari syndrome associated with a thrombosed mesoatrial shunt can be an even more vexing problem because of the patient's debilitated condition, hypercoagulable state, and altered anatomy from the previous thoracic and abdominal operations. Although the literature describes numerous surgical methods of treating the Budd-Chiari syndrome, no report specifically addresses the reoperative management of a recurrent thrombosed mesoatrial shunt. We report a patient with a recurrent thrombosed mesoatrial shunt, tightly stenotic retrohepatic inferior vena cava, and occluded hepatic veins with severe portal hypertension. A simultaneous inferior vena cavoplasty and a side-to-side portacaval shunt have produced excellent results with 26-month follow-up. To the best of our knowledge, this method has not been previously described. Other reported surgical methods of treating the Budd-Chiari syndrome are discussed, with emphasis on their relative applicability to the reoperative management of this condition. We submit that this one-stage patch cavoplasty and side-to-side portacaval shunt are the best direct surgical methods to provide immediate and long-term benefit for patients with this most challenging problem.\r"

DMH, 20 mg base/kg, was injected weekly for 10 weeks into Sprague-Dawley rats. The Moloney murine sarcoma virus (MSV-M) was injected (200 focus-forming units) intraperitoneally into 15 rats 48 hours after the last DMH injection or in 12 rats before the first DMH injection. Controls consisted of 12 rats receiving 10 injections of DMH only, nine rats receiving MSV-M alone, and 10 untreated rats. All tumors induced were adenocarcinomas of the gastrointestinal tract, characteristically induced by DMH and not by MSV-M. In the late virus group there was an augmentation of colon tumor induction (mean, 2.2 versus 1.1 colon tumors/rat, p less than 0.05), and in the MSV pretreated group, there was also significant augmentation of colon tumor induction (mean, 2.4 versus 1.1 colon tumors/rat, p less than 0.005) when compared with rats treated with DMH alone. Rats treated with MSV-M alone and untreated rats had no tumors. This is the first study to suggest the importance of exogenous viral infection in chemically induced colonic carcinogenesis.\r"

During the past year, our group has used combined intraoperative balloon thrombectomy with intraoperative balloon angioplasty in eight patients with acute arterial thrombosis. All patients experienced resolution of acute symptoms, and seven of eight patients had a palpable pedal pulse. There were no complications, and all patients were discharged by the second postoperative day. The above results have been maintained in a follow-up of 12 to 24 months (average, 16 months). This modality offers many advantages over other treatment modalities and is both therapeutically and cost-effective. We believe that intraoperative balloon thrombectomy with intraoperative balloon angioplasty is the initial treatment of choice in the management of suspected acute infrainguinal arterial thrombosis.\r"

During the study period, there was a 9% increase in the total number of surgical procedures. For the same time period, the number of surgeons grew 20%. By 1984 general surgical operations were greatest in number. However, the 5-year increase in the number of general surgical operations was just 7%. Although obstetric and gynecologic operations declined 1%, the most common inpatient surgical operation performed in the United States is cesarean section. Orthopedic surgical operations grew 24% and arthroscopy has become this country's sixteenth most frequent operation. Cataract extraction is the fourth most common operation and represents 60% of all ophthalmologic surgery. Cardiothoracic operations had the largest increase, 34%. This study demonstrates the dynamics of surgical practice in the United States and conveys a dual message. There is reassuring news concerning \"unnecessary\" surgery due to supplier-induced demand for operations. Despite recent large increases in the number of surgeons, there have not been parallel increases in the number of surgical operations. The belief that more surgeons necessarily means more surgery is not noted. The disturbing news concerns surgical case loads. The prospect of more surgeons performing fewer operations has become a major problem. The surgical community will have to address this growing inbalance.\r"

The functional effects of gallbladder removal in a patient with a patent cystic duct are not known in detail. Studies of the function of the gallbladder and pancreas have suggested feedback mechanisms for the release of cholecystokinin (CCK). A disturbed regulation of CCK release after cholecystectomy might induce pancreaticobiliary and gastrointestinal dysfunctions. In our study the concentrations of CCK in plasma were measured in 17 patients with gallstones. The measurements were taken with gallbladders opacified at cholecystography and with patent cystic ducts at the operation, in the fasting state, and during stimulation before and 17 weeks after the cholecystectomy. The CCK assay used measures sulfated CCK-8, CCK-22, and CCK-33 with equimolar potency but neither nonsulfated CCK nor any gastrins. Emtobil (containing peanut oil and sorbitol) was used for peroral stimulation of the CCK release. The basal concentration of CCK was 4 pmol/L and rose five times during a \"test meal.\" No significant differences were seen in fasting or stimulated concentrations of plasma CCK before and after the cholecystectomy. Thus cholecystectomy in gallstone patients with functioning gallbladders does not seem to influence the regulation of CCK release.\r"

The remaining 27 patients who had candidemia died of bacterial septicemia or organ system failure. The low incidence of Candida and the low incidence of mortality due to Candida was attributed to a comprehensive program of prevention, detection, and treatment. Early initiation of treatment with amphotericin B was an important aspect of the program.\r"

We now report the response to norepinephrine in intimal-thickened iliac vessels in conscious dogs. Seven dogs underwent balloon catheter deendothelialization of the right iliac artery. Three weeks later, ultrasonic transducers were implanted on both iliac arteries to record dynamic vessel dimension. A catheter was inserted into the terminal abdominal aorta for drug infusion and blood pressure monitoring. The dogs were studied unsedated 2 days after instrumentation. Norepinephrine was infused at doses that did not affect blood pressure (0.01 to 0.05 micrograms/kg/min). Control vessel diameter decreased from 5.2 mm +/- 0.3 to 5.1 mm +/- 0.3 (2.4% +/- 1.0% when standardized to baseline diameter) and intimal hyperplastic vessels from 6.2 mm +/- 0.4 to 5.7 mm +/- 0.4 (7.6% +/- 1.7%). The difference between control and intimal hyperplastic vessel vasoconstriction was significant at p less than 0.0025. The calculated reduction in total vessel cross-section area for control vessels was 4.5% +/- 1.9%. In intimal hyperplastic vessels total cross-sectional area was reduced by 14.5% +/- 3.3% by vasoconstriction and the luminal cross-sectional area was reduced by 17.9% +/- 0.7% by the intimal hyperplasia. These data suggest that luminal compromise due to intimal hyperplasia is compounded by increased sensitivity to norepinephrine. This effect, demonstrated in a large elastic artery shortly after endothelial denudation, may be of even greater significance in a smaller vessel with advanced intimal hyperplasia.\r"

We also sought causes that could account for the apparent increase in lipid mobilization. Tumor-bearing (TB) rats had depleted retroperitoneal fat stores, elevated blood triglycerides and cholesterol, and normal thyroid, hepatic, and renal function during tumor bearing. Catecholamine, growth hormone, and glucagon levels were not different between TB and nontumor-bearing (NTB) groups. Serum lipolytic activity and glycerol levels, which were elevated during tumor bearing, returned to NTB levels after complete tumor excision, along with restoration of retroperitoneal fat depots and carcass weight. The elevated serum lipolytic activity of animals that had tumors only incompletely excised rose significantly higher after the tumor regrew; this was accompanied by a failure to regain carcass weight. Previous work has shown that elevated lipolytic activity can also be demonstrated in culture media conditioned by growth of certain animal or human tumor cell lines in cell culture, free of host influences. This suggests that the actual tumor cell and not the host may be at least partly responsible for the lipid derangements seen in this model.\r"

We describe a new modification of a quadruple-loop pouch that has been successfully performed in 10 patients. This new approach to pouch construction produced excellent functional results 6 to 12 months after ileostomy takedown and was easier to construct and engage into the muscular cuff of the distal rectum than quadruple-loop pouches of equal length loops.\r"

Early intracranial operation remains a useful choice in the management of recent SAH in good-risk patients, but patients must be carefully selected on an individual basis. Many patients will undoubtedly benefit from early surgery but it is not a panacea. Further investigation of surgical treatment in combination with improved preoperative and postoperative medical therapy will be required to ameliorate the outcome of SAH. In particular, the prevention and treatment of cerebral infarction deserves attention. The results of the antifibrinolytic and timing of intracranial surgery studies point to the need for an effective prevention treatment regimen for vasospasm. Further studies about the efficacy of calcium channel blocking drugs in prevention of ischemia after SAH are needed among patients given antifibrinolytic drugs or having early operation. All the advances in treatment are predicated on prompt diagnosis of SAH in good-condition patients. The medical community needs to maintain a high degree of vigilance for the diagnosis of SAH in all patients complaining of a new, unusual or severe headache. Early referral to properly equipped and staffed medical facilities remains a keystone to effective treatment of SAH.\r"

Hypertension pre-dating the hemorrhage was present in 45% (69 of 154), as determined by history. A more inclusive definition of hypertension, combining those with a positive history with those found to have left ventricular hypertrophy by electrocardiogram or cardiomegaly by chest radiography, applied in 56% (87 of 154). The cases were compared to controls with and without hypertension derived from the NHANES II study of blood pressure (n = 16,204) to determine relative risk. For the presence of hypertension by history, the relative risk of intracerebral hemorrhage was 3.9 (95% confidence interval, 2.7 to 5.7). For the inclusive definition of hypertension, the relative risk was 5.4 (3.7 to 7.9). Relative risk was also determined for hypertension in blacks (= 4.4), age greater than 70 (= 7), prior cerebral infarction (= 22), and diabetes (= 3). We conclude that the term \"hypertensive hemorrhage\" should be used very selectively, particularly in whites, and propose that hypertension be viewed as one of several important risk factors for spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage.\r"

The incidence and clinical correlates of these lesions remain unknown. In this report, 240 consecutive MRI scans performed over a 6-month period were reviewed (excluding patients with recent brain trauma or known demyelinating disease). Subcortical incidental lesions (ILs) were identified, which could not be accounted for by the patient's current clinical diagnosis, neurological status, or CT scan. The ILs were graded according to size, multiplicity, and location. The incidence and severity of ILs increased with advancing age (p less than 0.0005). Among patients over 50 years of age, the incidence and severity of ILs were correlated with a previous history of history of ischemic cerebrovascular disease (p less than 0.05) and with hypertension (p less than 0.05). Multivariable regression analysis identified age, prior brain ischemia, and hypertension as the major predictors of ILs in the elderly. Diabetes, coronary artery diseases, and sex did not play a significant role. With the exception of cerebrovascular disease, there was no association between ILs and any particular clinical entity, including dementia. It is concluded that subcortical parenchymal lesions are frequent incidental findings on MRI in the elderly, and may represent an index of chronic cerebrovascular diseases in such patients.\r"

Postmortem in vitro proton MRI was performed on the brains of seven consecutive elderly patients dying of nonneurologic causes. Scans were done in the fresh and fixed states with the specimen immersed in saline and formaldehyde respectively. A 1.5 Tesla superconductive system was used with a multiple spin-echo protocol generating T2 weighted images. Subcortical MRI lesions were localized in three dimensions and identified at brain cutting. In addition, pathological correlations were obtained from an eighth patient who underwent MRI eleven days before death. Histological examinations were performed in a blinded fashion, including control areas from the same brains. Subcortical MRI lesions were found to be associated with arteriosclerosis, dilated perivascular spaces, and vascular ectasia (p less than 0.05). These histological changes were characteristic of \"etat crible\" which, like subcortical MRI lesions, is associated with age and hypertension. Shrinkage (or atrophy) of the brain parenchyma around ectatic blood vessels would result in an extensive network of tunnels filled with extracellular water. The proton MRI signal from such areas of the brain would be increased. Gliosis and small areas of infarction occasionally coexisted with \"etat crible,\" but these were not present in all areas with MRI lesions and could not be distinguished by MRI signal alone. In conclusion, clinical and pathological correlations lend support to the uniform hypothesis that MRI provides a nonspecific index of brain parenchymal alterations caused by aging and chronic cerebrovascular disease.\r"

  ".W": "This study examined the phenomenon of post-stroke depression and evaluated its impact on rehabilitation outcome. Sixty-four patients presenting to a rehabilitation program within weeks of first stroke were evaluated for depression through self-report measures and staff ratings. Patients also rated the particular coping strategies which they used in dealing with their illness and hospital stay. Physical and occupational therapists provided measures of functional impairment at admission and discharge. A high (47%) prevalence of depression was found in this population, with no overall differences observed between patients with right or left hemisphere lesions. Depressed patients, in comparison to non-depressed, evidenced greater functional impairment at both admission and discharge. However, both groups showed similar gains over the course of rehabilitation. Coping strategies employed by depressed patients appeared to reflect a lower level of participation in the rehabilitation process. A subgroup of patients evaluated 6 weeks after discharge revealed that depression was associated with a worsening on one measure of functional status. These findings indicate that depression is a frequent companion of stroke, that it is associated with degree of functional impairment, and that it may exert a negative impact on the rehabilitation process and outcome.\r"

A low record of hypertension regulation (5.0%-12.7%), a high proportion (47.1%) of stroke due to cerebral hemorrhage (by clinical assessment), and a high fatality rate (40.1%) for cerebral hemorrhage may account partially for the slower declining rate. A geographic difference in the downward trend of CVD death rate was observed in this period. Districts remote from the major cities have had the lowest decline in CVD death rate.\r"

Eight of the patients had cortical infarcts, in two cases with extension into the striate body. In one case the infarct involved the striate body only. The density of neurons and glial cells was measured in the coronal and the horizontal planes at various distances from the margin of the infarct. Corresponding counting points in the contralateral hemisphere served as control. On light microscopy, the infarcted cortex was irregularly shaped, but on serial sections the bulging parts appeared to be cut off from the infarcted tissue (\"pseudo-infarct islands\"). The zone of transition from infarcted to normal brain tissue was less than a few mm wide. In one patient, tomographic measurements of the cerebral blood flow (CBF) and a CT scan could be compared with the neuropathological findings. In this patient, CBF in the surroundings of the infarct was decreased despite a normal neuronal density. The study supports the traditional view held by pathologists that a sharp transition exists between infarcted and normal brain tissue and suggests that the hypoperfusion zone surrounding the region of complete infarction may be due to mechanisms other than selective loss of neurons.\r"

Frederickson's type IIb hyperlipoproteinemia was the commonest (32%) abnormal pattern observed, followed by type IIa (12%), type IV (12%) and type V (4%). Family studies were carried out in all the 25 index patients (15 hyperlipidemic and 10 normolipidemic). Familial hyperlipidemia (i.e. 2 or more hyperlipidemic members in the same family) was found in 9 of the 15 hyperlipidemic index patients and in none of the normolipidemic index patients. The common pattern was found to be that of familial combined hyperlipidemia. The study indicates that screening the family members of hyperlipidemic young patients of non-embolic ischemic stroke may delineate a group of high risk individuals for possible primary prevention before they develop the disease.\r"

Since perfluorocarbon emulsions such as FC-43 have greater solubilities for gases compared to plasma, it was decided to investigate their potential in providing protection against transient ischemia produced by such emboli. Forty rabbits were divided into three groups of ten, twenty, and ten. They were anesthetized with acepromazine and ketamine and were given an infusion of either hetastarch or FC-43, 10 ml/kg i.v. In Group I, which received a bolus air injection into the internal carotid artery, survival rates were: 2/5 for the hetastarch group and 5/5 for the FC-43 group (p less than .05). In Group 2, which received an air infusion until the EEG was flat bilaterally, 3/10 hetastarch-treated rabbits survived while 10/10 FC-43-treated rabbits survived for 24 hours (p = .035). In Group 3, analysis of blood viscosity and osmolality over a four hour period following either hetastarch or FC-43 infusion resulted in no significant differences between the two treatments but a significant decrease in both variables after 30 minutes which returned to baseline values at 60 minutes. The results of the study demonstrate a protective effect from cerebral air emboli delivered into the internal carotid artery as either a bolus or slow infusion in rabbits pretreated with a perfluorocarbon emulsion in terms of survivability and recovery from transient neurological deficits.\r"

  ".W": "The state of water in cerebral ischemia was studied by using the proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H-NMR) method. Cerebral ischemia was induced experimentally in Mongolian gerbils by unilateral ligation of the common carotid artery. Longitudinal (T1) and transverse (T2) relaxation times of the ischemic brain were measured with a pulse FT-NMR spectrometer and the water content was determined by the wet/dry method. Quantitative analysis of the relaxation times was performed sequentially during the initial 7 hours following ligation and the data were compared with those of brain edema previously reported by S. Naruse in the rat. Characteristic findings in brain ischemia include prolongation of the slow component of T2 and increase in the water content. A quantitative comparison of relaxation rate and water content demonstrates that ischemic brain edema in Mongolian gerbils is different from cytotoxic and vasogenic types of brain edema. When R2 (1/T2) was plotted against the water content, the slope value of ischemia in the gerbil was between the slope values of the TET intoxication and cold injury induced edemas reported previously. From these results, it might be said that ischemic brain edema includes both the cytotoxic and vasogenic types of brain edema. Glycerol was demonstrated to affect brain ischemia by decreasing the water content and by shortening the slow component of T2. By analysis of the relaxation times and water content, we examined the pathophysiological characteristics of water molecules in ischemic brain tissue.\r"

The patients were allocated randomly to two groups: 14 patients received oral treatment with ASA 500 mg b.i.d. for 14 days, 11 patients placebo b.i.d. for the same period. B-TG and PF4 plasma levels and ADP-induced platelet aggregation were determined in basal conditions, and two hours, and seven and fourteen days after starting with ASA or placebo. In addition, the same parameters were studied in a group of 20 healthy males of matched age. Basal levels of plasma B-TG and PF4 and the maximal amplitude of ADP-induced platelet aggregation were abnormally high in TIA patients. ASA caused a significant reduction of B-TG plasma levels in TIA patients 2 hours after the first administration, but no effect was observed at the 7th and 14th day of treatment. PF4 plasma levels were unaffected by ASA treatment. It is concluded that ASA, at the dose conventionally used in clinical trials, does not affect the release of two alpha-granule proteins.\r"

The right carotid artery was permanently ligated, and animals without gross neurological deficits (\"symptom-negative\" gerbils) were selected. Eight days and eight weeks after vascular ligation, cell counts of hippocampal neurons were carried out and correlated with regional blood flow and the acquisition of operant behaviour. Eight days after carotid artery occlusion, learning behaviour was significantly impaired although the number of hippocampal neurons had not changed and blood flow had even increased above normal. After eight weeks, learning behaviour and blood flow were normal but now a significant loss of pyramidal neurons was present in the CA1 and CA2 sectors of the hippocampus. Our observations demonstrate that it is possible to detect subtle functional disturbances by appropriate behavioural investigation before manifestation of selective injury of the hippocampus. Recovery of integrative function, despite persistent cellular damage, provides further evidence for central nervous plasticity.\r"

Functional recovery was evaluated by qualitative and quantitative EEG analysis, and metabolic recovery by measuring metabolite and electrolyte levels in tissue samples taken from the cerebral cortex. In 5 out of 12 animals EEG activity did not recover after ischemia (group I); in 3 animals, intermittent EEG activity (group II) and in 4 animals continuous EEG activity returned during the observation period (group III). In group I the energy state was severely disturbed and an increase of calcium was detected, in group II this disturbance was much less pronounced, and in group III changes in energy metabolism and ion concentration were absent with the only exception of lower ADP levels. During recovery, the total intensity of EEG correlated positively with ATP (p less than 0.01) and inversely with lactate (p less than 0.05), and the intensity of the delta band inversely with sodium content (p less than 0.05). The results obtained demonstrate that electrophysiological recovery after prolonged ischemia is closely correlated with the restoration of the energy state and of electrolyte homeostasis of the brain. The inverse relationship of EEG intensity with lactate and sodium are interpreted as evidence for the adverse effects of ongoing post-ischemic glycolysis, resulting in the activation of the H+/Na+ antiporter for the regulation of intracellular pH.\r"

Ischemia was produced by occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery (MCA), and GM1 (30 mg/kg) was injected intravenously at 30 min after the MCA occlusion or at the time of release of the occlusion, at 120 min. Another group of animals were subjected to the same ischemic insult, but without GM1 treatment, and sham-operated treated and not treated cats were also studied. The animals of both GM1-treated and non-treated stroke groups were classified into 2 groups (severe and moderate) depending on the depression of electrocortical activity in the ischemic hemisphere at 30 min of the ischemia. There was a significant increase in local cerebral blood flow in the ischemic area in the treated animals. Additionally there was a significant treatment effect on the left peripheral MCA territory for lCMRgl in the 30 min treated moderate group, (p less than .05). This group of animals showed decreased lCMRgl accompanied by less severe histological damage suggesting that GM1 may produce metabolic depression so as to maintain a normal flow-metabolism couple and prevent ischemic structural damage. The possible mechanism of metabolic depression induced by GM1 is briefly discussed.\r"

Blood flow was measured by the injection of radioactive microspheres (Co57, Sn113, Ru103, Sc46). Blood flow measurements were made at varying levels of mean arterial pressure (MAP) which was altered by neosynephrine to raise MAP or trimethaphan to lower MAP. Autoregulation of the spinal cord mirrored that of the brain, with an autoregulatory range of 60 to 120 mm Hg for both tissues. Within this range, cerebral blood flow (CBF) was 59.2 +/- 3.2 ml/100 g/min (SEM) and spinal cord blood flow (SCBF) was 61.1 +/- 3.6. There was no significant difference in CBF and SCBF in the autoregulatory range. Autoregulation was also demonstrated regionally in the left cortex, right cortex, brainstem, thalamus, cerebellum, hippocampus and cervical, thoracic and lumbar cord. This data provides a coherent reference point in establishing autoregulatory curves under barbiturate anesthesia. Further investigation of the effects of other anesthetic agents on autoregulation of the spinal cord is needed. It is possible that intraspinal cord compliance, like intracranial compliance, might be adversely affected by the effects of anesthetics on autoregulation.\r"

The relaxation of cerebral arteries that are well endowed with VIP-immunoreactive nerves was selectively and reversibly inhibited by VIP-specific antiserum.

In seven cats the ipsilateral SEP's were abolished after middle cerebral artery occlusion, and did not show any recovery after 6 hours. The same seven cats showed the greatest area of moderate and severe ischemic neuronal changes, ranging from 21 to 64% (mean 39 +/- 14%) of the total ipsilateral cortical area. The remaining eight cats showed a complete flattening or decreased amplitude of the SEP after occlusion, but demonstrated a considerable recovery in the amplitude of the primary cortical potential during the six hours of the study. All these cats had ischemic areas of less than 15% (mean 9 +/- 3%) of the total ipsilateral cortex. These results demonstrate that the disappearance of the SEP and their failure to recover correlate with the extent and degree of histological cerebral ischemia.\r"

In twenty-two baboons, we examined the distribution of 99-Technetium labelled albumin aggregates (5 to 40 microns in size) after injection into the circulation at the left atrium (LA), carotid trifurcation (CA), and anterior and posterior common carotid artery (CCI). In a further subgroup, the emboli were introduced at the carotid trifurcation with the contralateral carotid artery ligated (CA + L). The results of this study demonstrated that aggregates introduced at the carotid artery lodged preferentially in the ophthalmic (p = 0.032) and middle cerebral artery territories (p = 0.016). If the contralateral common carotid artery was ligated, however, more aggregates were found in the ipsi- and contralateral anterior cerebral artery territories (p = 0.01, p = 0.003). Aggregates introduced into the cardiac circulation were equally distributed throughout the brain. This experimental model determined patterns of flow that might be analogous to the human situation where unilateral or bilateral carotid stenosis or stenosis with contralateral occlusion has occurred or embolus from cardiac source has occurred. The results do not imply that the 40 micron microaggregates do cause TIA. These experimental findings support clinical observations that cardiac lesions may cause transient ischemic attacks (TIA) anywhere in the brain. In contrast, those of carotid artery origin cause predominantly middle cerebral or ophthalmic artery territory TIAs unless the contralateral carotid artery is severely stenosed or occluded.\r"

The onset of aggregation was monitored through a microscope in mice given angiotensin II acetate, 4 micrograms i.v. 30 minutes earlier. Aggregation latency was compared with that in vehicle treated (saline) mice. Angiotensin II caused a highly significant delay in aggregation within the arterioles which was not related to a change in shear rate of blood. Angiotensin II added to platelet rich plasma, failed to influence the aggregation produced by subsequent addition of 0.5 microM ADP or 0.5 mM sodium arachidonate. Angiotensin is a well known stimulator of prostacyclin synthesis or release, and angiotensin has been reported to inhibit platelet aggregation ex vivo by increasing prostacyclin in the effluent superfusing the mass of aggregating platelets. Our data represent the first report of an antiaggregating effect of angiotensin II in vivo in an intact microvascular bed. The data is consonant with the literature describing increased prostacyclin levels following angiotensin II infusion. The antiaggregating effect of angiotensin in cerebral microvessels may help explain a recent observation describing increased survival of gerbils treated with angiotensin following carotid ligation.\r"

Comparison of the mean velocity in the MCA and the cortical convexity rCBF revealed relatively little hysteresis in their relationship from prior to after the occlusion. There was however, considerable variability in this relationship among patients. Both the rCBF and the velocity decreased substantially at occlusion in three cases, neither changed very much in three. While in two, though the rCBF decreased significantly, the velocity did not change. The index of pulse amplitude was somewhat more sensitive to the occlusion, decreasing in the seven cases in which it was recorded, including one in which the rCBF did not change.\r"

  ".W": "In this study hemodynamic and morphometric consequences of atherosclerosis were examined in cynomolgus monkeys. We tested the hypothesis that atherosclerosis augments cerebral vasoconstrictor responses to serotonin. We studied 8 normal and 8 atherosclerotic monkeys, which were fed an atherogenic diet for 17 months. Morphometric studies indicated marked intimal proliferation of extracranial carotid arteries, with only modest reduction in the vascular lumen, as atherosclerotic lesions were displaced outward. Cerebral blood flow was measured with microspheres and microvascular pressure was measured with a micropipette in pial arteries approximately 350 microns diameter. Intracarotid infusion of serotonin reduced microvascular pressure, which indicates constriction of large arteries upstream, but cerebral blood flow did not decrease. Serotonin produced a 2-fold greater reduction in cerebral microvascular pressure in atherosclerotic monkeys than in normal monkeys. Intracarotid histamine increased flow and hypocapnia reduced flow in both normal and atherosclerotic monkeys, without altering cerebral microvascular pressure. We conclude: First, atherosclerosis potentiates constrictor responses to serotonin in large cerebral arteries. Because platelets release serotonin when they aggregate, augmentation of responses by atherosclerosis may have implications for cerebral vascular responses during aggregation of platelets at carotid lesions. Second, despite marked proliferation of intima, atherosclerotic lesions are displaced outward during a prestenotic phase of the disease, so that the lumen is relatively well preserved.\r"

The magnitude of platelet accumulation at the carotid bifurcation was expressed as the ratio of radioactivity of indium-111 platelets deposited on the vascular wall to those circulating in the blood-pool (PAI, platelet accumulation index), 48 hr after injection of labeled platelets. PAI values were measured before (baseline studies) and after the antithrombotic therapies (aspirin studies: 325 mg bid for 22.3 +/- 1.3 days, ticlopidine studies: 100 mg tid for 21.8 +/- 2.1 days). At the baseline, the mean PAI value at 24 carotid bifurcations in the patient group was 15.7 +/- 15.3% (mean +/- S.D.) compared to -4.3 +/- 9.1 at 24 carotid bifurcations in 12 normal subjects (p less than 0.01). We defined the upper limit for a normal PAI (%) value to be +13.9, namely the mean PAI plus 2 SD for the carotid bifurcation in normal subjects and used this value for semiquantitative analysis. At the baseline, significant elevation of PAI (more than 13.9%; positive scintigram) was observed at 12 of 24 vessels, while 12 other regions were negative (less than 13.9%). In the lesions with positive scintigraphic results at the baseline, the mean PAI (%) value from the baseline, aspirin and ticlopidine studies was 29.5 +/- 7.0, 11.2 +/- 8.5 (p less than 0.01 versus baseline) and 21.4 +/- 21.3 (not significant from baseline), respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Hypercapnia, induced by the inhalation of 5% or 8% CO2 in air for 8 minutes caused a 2 to 5-fold increase in regional cerebral blood flow. However, despite a marked reduction of about 90% in cortical norepinephrine levels ipsilateral to the lesion, blood flow to the frontal and parietal cortex, hippocampus, striatum and cerebellum increased to the same extent in ipsilateral and contralateral regions. Thus, lesion of the locus ceruleus and the resultant depletion of endogenous cortical and hippocampal norepinephrine, does not influence the cerebrovascular response to hypercapnia.\r"

It is unknown, however, whether these conditions occur more frequently among relatives of patients with specific types of stroke as compared to non-relatives. The frequencies of stroke and its major risk factors in two groups of subjects were compared. One group consisted of 76 siblings of 41 patients hospitalized with cerebral infarction and transient ischemic attacks in an investigative stroke unit; the other consisted of 55 siblings of the patients' spouses. The occurrence of these conditions in the relatives was determined from a questionnaire completed by the relatives and supported by information from the relatives' family physicians. When considered separately, hypertension, heart disease, and stroke occurred in a small but not statistically significant excess among the relatives in-law. However, various combinations of two or three diseases, (including diabetes), occurred in 20.9% of the patients' siblings as compared to only 3.6% of the relatives in-law (p less than 0.001). These results suggest that living siblings of patients with cerebral infarction and transient ischemic attacks may have an increased risk of stroke and cardiovascular disease as a result of multiple risk factors operating simultaneously. Prevention programs among this high risk population may be particularly worthwhile.\r"

The somatosensory evoked potential (SEP) and direct cortical response (DCR) were monitored in all animals and in each case, the cortical component of the SEP was abolished during progressive ischemia while the morphology of the DCR was well-preserved but with reduced amplitude. Determinations of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), phosphocreatine (PCr), and lactate levels in cerebral cortex and white matter were made in five experimental cats and the three controls. At the time of failure of the cortical SEP, PCr was dramatically reduced and lactate moderately elevated in the white matter while ATP remained unchanged. Cortical lactate was only mildly elevated and PCr and ATP were unchanged accounting for preservation of the DCR. In this model of global ischemia, abolition of the cortical SEP is due to a block of stimulus conduction in white matter projection pathways. A hypothesis to explain the observed metabolic changes is presented and correlation is made to clinical situations.\r"

Angiography, carried out, on average, 4.2 months postoperatively, revealed complete occlusion of the operated carotid artery in 16 cases (18.5%); in at least 13 cases this was completely asymptomatic. Perioperative findings suggest that microembolism is, but haemodynamic insufficiency is not, an important cause of focal cerebral ischemia.

In this model an inflatable silastic balloon cuff has been implanted by transorbital approach around the right middle cerebral artery (MCA), proximal to the take-off of the lenticulostriate arteries (LSA). Inflation of the balloon for 3 hours in six animals produced a stereotypic sustained stroke syndrome characterized by contralateral hemiparesis. An infarction volume of 3.2 +/- 1.5 cm3 in the ipsilateral corpus striatum was documented by computerized tomographic (CT) scanning at 10 days following stroke induction and 3.9 +/- 1.9 cm3 (n = 4) at 14 days by morphometric neuropathologic determinations of brain specimens fixed in situ by pressure-perfusion with 10% buffered formalin. Immediate pressure-perfusion fixation following deflation of the balloon was performed in 16 additional animals given Evans blue dye intravenously prior to the 3 hour MCA balloon occlusion. Light microscopy and transmission electron microscopy consistently confirmed the presence of thrombotic material occluding microcirculatory branches of the right LSA in the region of Evans blue stain, but not those of the contralateral corpus striatum. When autologous 111In-platelets were infused intravenously in four animals from the above group prior to the transient 3 hour occlusion of the right MCA, gamma scintillation camera imaging of each perfused-fixed whole brain demonstrated the presence of a single residual focus of 111In-platelet activity involving only the Evans blue-stained right corpus striatum. Focal right hemispheric activity was equivalent to 0.55 +/- 0.49 ml of whole blood, and the occlusion score derived from histologic examination of the microcirculation of the Evans blue-stained corpus striatum averaged 34.8 +/- 2.8. Similar 111In-platelet imaging and histologic scoring experiments carried out in four animals pretreated with the antithrombotic combination heparin and ticlopidine showed marked reduction of both 111In-platelet activity (0.01 +/- 0.03 ml vs. 0.55 +/- 0.49 ml; p less than 0.01) and thrombotic occlusion of the microcirculation (10.8 +/- 7.4 units vs. 34.8 +/- 2.8 units; p less than 0.01) in the right corpus striatum following 3 hours of MCA occlusion. In separate control experiments 111In-labeled autologous platelets were infused after the 3 hour period of right MCA occlusion and subsequent balloon deflation in two animals; no focus of 111In-platelet activity was demonstrated in fixed whole brain.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

In two patients this anomaly was found incidentally. Associated intracranial aneurysms were identified in seven patients, including fusiform aneurysms in 4 and saccular aneurysms in 3. Three patients had an accompanying hydrocephalus. The dolichoectatic basilar artery is associated with various consequences especially in relation to the pathogenesis of brainstem infarction.

In 7 animals treated with oral administrations of allopurinol (200 mg/kg) 24 hours and 1 hour before occlusion, no death was found either during occlusion or after reperfusion, and the loss of righting reflex was noted in only one animal 24-72 hours following reperfusion. The increase in cerebral water content and accompanied changes in electrolyte contents were clearly prevented by allopurinol.

Although VIP (1 and 10 micrograms/ml) caused substantial reduction of NBT, the rate of the SOD-inhibitable portion was not significantly different from zero. We also examined the effect of scavenging of superoxide and hydrogen peroxide by topical application of SOD plus catalase on the vasodilator effect of VIP (0.05-1.0 microgram/ml). The dilation in response to VIP was not significantly affected in either large or small arterioles by scavenging of superoxide and hydrogen peroxide.

Our goals were to determine whether forskolin is a cerebral vasodilator and whether it potentiates cerebral vasodilator responses to adenosine. We measured cerebral blood flow with microspheres in anesthetized rabbits. Forskolin (10 micrograms/kg per min) increased blood flow (ml/min per 100 gm) from 39 +/- 5 (mean +/- S.E.) to 56 +/- 9 (p less than 0.05) in cerebrum, and increased flow to myocardium and kidney despite a decrease in mean arterial pressure. Forskolin did not alter cerebral oxygen consumption, which indicates that the increase in cerebral blood flow is a direct vasodilator effect and is not secondary to increased metabolism. We also examined effects of forskolin on the response to infusion of adenosine. Cerebral blood flow was measured during infusion of 1-5 microM/min adenosine into one internal carotid artery, under control conditions and during infusion of forskolin at 3 micrograms/kg per min i.v. Adenosine alone increased ipsilateral cerebral blood flow from 32 +/- 3 to 45 +/- 5 (p less than 0.05). Responses to adenosine were not augmented during infusion of forskolin. We conclude that forskolin is a direct cerebral vasodilator and forskolin does not potentiate cerebral vasodilator responses to adenosine.\r"

To test the autoregulation, the blood pressure was stepwise lowered by bleeding and maintained at a new level, i.e. 15% or 30% lower than the baseline values before, during and after cerebral ischemia. At the preischemic state, CBF and CeBF were 52.1 +/- 6.2 and 58.9 +/- 4.6 ml/100 g/min (mean +/- SEM), of which autoregulations were normally preserved. Following BCL, CBF was markedly decreased to about 10% of control value while CeBF was minimally reduced to 46.9 +/- 8.6 ml/100 g/min (80%). At the ischemic state, CBF became almost zero flow during hypotension. CeBF was also reduced to 74% and further to 58% of the resting value by 15% and 30% decrease in the blood pressure, respectively, indicating impaired CeBF autoregulation. At the 30 min post-ischemic state, CBF was recovered to 48.0 +/- 4.9 and CeBF to 53.9 +/- 5.4 ml/100 g/min. Autoregulation of CBF was still abolished, whereas CeBF was kept constant by 15% fall of blood pressure and slightly reduced to 84% by 30% hypotension, indicating almost recovery of CeBF autoregulation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Performance on complex motor tests was significantly delayed only in the hypoxic-ischemic 37 degrees C rats. However, cognitive testing disclosed significant delay of spatial learning in animals subjected to hypoxia-ischemia at 21 degrees C and those with gross infarction at 37 degrees C. There was enhanced avoidance learning in the animals with gross infarction in the hypoxia-ischemia 37 degrees C group. Hypoxic-ischemic damage in the neonatal rat at 37 degrees C results in transient delay of complex motor skills, but longer lasting cognitive changes. Hypoxia-ischemia during hypothermia produces no motor deficits, although there may be similar alterations in learning.\r"

Eight normal male volunteers (not suffering from migraine) received 0.5 mg ergotamine and 1 mg dihydroergotamine i.v. Cerebral blood flow was measured by the xenon-133 inhalation method and single-photon-emission computerized tomography before and after intravenous acetazolamide administration (1 g). Cerebral blood flow was measured before and 4 hours after ergotamine and dihydroergotamine administration. Strain-gauge measurements of toe-arm systolic gradients were used to monitor the effect of the drug on leg arteries. Mean hemispheric and regional cerebral blood flow was unchanged after either drug (mean +/- SEM, ml/100 g/min): for ergotamine, 57 +/- 3 before and 57 +/- 3 at 4 hours; for dihydroergotamine, 54 +/- 2 before and 55 +/- 2 at 4 hours. The acetazolamide response was unchanged as well. Only ergotamine decreased the toe-arm systolic gradient significantly (22 mm Hg at maximum after 240 minutes; p less than 0.02). Thus, our study did not support the belief that ergot alkaloids should be withheld from patients during attacks of classic migraine, but this has to be investigated further. The discrepancy in the peripheral effects of ergotamine and dihydroergotamine might also be of clinical importance.\r"

Five dogs failed to meet preestablished protocol criteria and were excluded from data analysis. Neurologic recovery was evaluated by an observer blind to the treatment groups in the remaining 12 dogs at 48 hours postischemia. The neurologic effects of complete cerebral ischemia were compared between dogs treated with deferoxamine and those receiving placebo treatment. One of 6 deferoxamine-treated dogs was normal and 5 were moderately to severely damaged. Similarly, 1 of 6 placebo-treated dogs was normal and 5 were moderately to severely damaged.

Compared to patients without gait disturbance, those with gait abnormality had a higher Hachinski ischemic score and depression score and were more behaviorally impaired. Urinary and gait abnormalities may be markers for cerebrovascular disease and vascular dementia even in the absence of frank stroke. Damage to bifrontal outflow tracts may be the common pathophysiological mechanism underlying the behavioral and motor symptoms characteristic of vascular dementias.\r"

These effects persisted for 3 hours. An adaptive decrease in cerebral blood flow and increase in cerebrovascular resistance were seen when hypercapnia was maintained for an additional 3 hours. Regional variations occurred; those areas with the greatest initial hypercapnic blood flow (cortex, caudate nucleus) showed a greater rate of decay of flow over time. Cerebrospinal fluid pH, initially acidotic during hypercapnia, increased over the subsequent 5 hours from 6.99 +/- 0.02 to 7.13 +/- 0.02. This was accompanied by an increase in the cerebrospinal fluid bicarbonate ion concentration from a normocapnic baseline of 19.6 +/- 0.6 to 26.2 +/- 4 mEq/l. Total and regional cerebral blood flow were linearly related to cerebrospinal fluid pH (R2 = 0.97). Extrapolation of a full adaptive return of flow to baseline indicated a shift in the cerebrovascular sensitivity to extracellular hydrogen ion concentration during prolonged hypercapnia.\r"

To test this hypothesis we measured the permeability-surface area products of 22Na and [3H]sucrose in gerbils following 3 hours of unilateral ischemia. In animals with neurologic symptoms, unilateral carotid occlusion reduced the cerebral blood flow in the ipsilateral cerebral hemisphere to 13 +/- 4 ml/100 g/min (n = 6). The water content of the ischemic hemisphere increased from 79.0 +/- 0.6 to 80.8 +/- 0.2% (n = 7, p less than 0.001) and tissue sodium content increased from 231 +/- 17 to 359 +/- 23 mEq/kg (p less than 0.0001). However, there was a 40% reduction in the sodium permeability-surface area product of the ischemic hemisphere compared with the control side (1.65 +/- 0.44 vs 2.79 +/- 0.29 microliter/g/min, n = 6, p less than 0.001). The sucrose permeability-surface area product, a measure of blood-brain barrier integrity, was unchanged. Although ischemia was less severe in the diencephalon, the tissue water and sodium contents increased significantly on the ischemic side. In contrast to the cerebral hemisphere, however, the permeability-surface area products for both sodium and sucrose were unchanged in the ischemic diencephalon. These results suggest that the increase in tissue sodium seen in ischemic edema is not due to enhanced sodium uptake; we speculate that it results, in part, from a reduction in sodium and water clearance from the tissue.\r"

We studied the bilateral middle cerebral artery occlusion model in 17 cats, 5 with a 1-hour occlusion, 5 with a 4-hour occlusion, and 7 with a sham operation. The time course of cerebral tissue radioactivity (Ci*(t)) was monitored by external coincidence counting during a programmed infusion of [18F]-2-deoxy-2-fluoro-d-glucose (18F-2-FDG). Arterial plasma concentration (Cp*(t)) of the tracer was kept constant during the first 45 minutes. Rate constants were estimated from Ci*(t) and Cp*(t) by a nonlinear least-squares fitting routine. The lumped constant was estimated from the fit of the ratio of extraction fractions of glucose and 18F-2-FDG by nonweighted, nonlinear least-squares fitting. In the 4-hour-occlusion model, the transfer constant k1* was 23% lower, k3* 39% lower, and the lumped constant 78% higher than in the sham-operated animals. In the 1-hour-occlusion model, k3* was 26% lower than in the sham-operated animals but the lumped constant was not significantly different.

Its potential was investigated in the gerbil stroke model. Biodistribution of [3H]misonidazole was measured in normal gerbils and animals that had been subjected to right common carotid artery ligation to produce cerebral ischemia. The uptake of [3H]misonidazole in the right cerebral hemisphere and right/left hemispheral uptake ratios correlated positively with the severity of the stroke when measured 6-9 hours after carotid ligation. Histologic studies in symptomatic ligated animals showed ipsilateral widespread but patchy acute ischemic changes as well as areas that showed no morphological changes. Microscopic autoradiography in these animals showed diffuse heavy labelling only in the ipsilateral hemisphere. This was over areas that had histological damage as well as in adjacent areas that appeared intact. Studies comparing blood flow measured with [14C]iodoantipyrine and [3H]misonidazole retention in gerbils with carotid artery ligations indicated that flow is not a major determinant of retention of this hypoxia tracer. We conclude that a misonidazole congener labelled with a gamma- or positron-emitting isotope may be useful in nuclear imaging of the degree and regional distribution of hypoxic tissue in cerebrovascular disease.\r"

During occlusion, blood flow in the auditory cortex was severely suppressed. In the fore limb projection area of the somatosensory cortex, blood flow was moderately reduced while it was nearly unaffected in the hind limb projection area. Despite different degrees of ischemia in the 3 cortical areas, all evoked responses were completely abolished within 10 minutes after occlusion. During permanent occlusion, the pattern of blood flow reduction persisted, and all evoked potentials stayed abolished. Recirculation after occlusion restored blood flow rapidly. AEP's recovered poorly after both 1 and 2 hours of ischemia. SEP's regained normal amplitudes soon after recirculation in the group with 1-hour occlusion. After 2 hours of ischemia, the recovery of SEP's was variable but better than that of the AEP's. Remarkable water accumulation was observed in the auditory cortex of all 3 groups and was accompanied in the 2-hour ischemia group by a disruption of the blood-brain barrier. In the 2-hour group, water accumulation was also found in the subcortical white matter radiation, whereas significant changes in regional water content were not observed in the somatosensory areas. The present study indicates that abolition of SEP's during middle cerebral artery occlusion in cats is caused by lesions in the afferent pathway leading to cortical deafferentation rather than by cortical ischemia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "This study sought to answer questions about the social and functional consequences of stroke for elderly patients (greater than or equal to 65 years of age). Survivors of acute stroke were retrospectively identified, and hospital records were reviewed. One year after discharge, follow-up interviews were conducted with families of surviving patients. Most patients were discharged to home (82%) and remained there. Independent functional status was the single predictor of discharge to home (p less than 0.01). By the time of followup, less than half of the surviving patients were functionally independent (42%). Stroke is an important cause of functional dependence among the elderly. Attention should be focused on minimizing the effects of persisting dysfunction on them and their families.\r"

A significant improvement in side-to-side cerebral blood flow asymmetry occurred in 6 patients studied at baseline and in 11 patients during provoked cerebral vasodilation. These patients all belonged to a group of 14 patients who, in addition to a severe stenosis of the internal carotid artery, presented a reduction in cerebral perfusion pressure of at least 20%. No improvements occurred in 18 patients with no or only minor reduction in perfusion pressure, irrespective of the degree of stenosis. These findings indicate an improved perfusion reserve following carotid endarterectomy in most patients with marked reduction in perfusion pressure, whereas only some of these patients will experience an improvement in baseline cerebral blood flow.\r"

Histopathology of the brain was evaluated blindly 72 hours later and graded on a conventional 3-point scale. There was no significant effect of treatment in either series. In the 6-hour series, the percent of cerebral hemispheres showing damage of Grades 2 or 3 in zone CA1 of the hippocampus and in the striatum, respectively, was 100 and 40% for the nimodipine-treated rats, 100 and 42% for rats receiving vehicle, and 75 and 25% for animals receiving saline.

  ".W": "1,3-Butanediol is an ethanol dimer that induces systemic ketosis. It has previously been shown to increase hypoxic survival time and reduce neurologic deficit in several experimental preparations. The aim of this study was to determine if the mechanism of 1,3-butanediol-induced cerebral protection was elevation of blood ketone levels, blood glucagon levels, or both. Blood beta-hydroxybutyrate levels, glucagon levels, or both produced by a previously reported protective dose of 1,3-butanediol (47 mmol/kg) were simulated by direct i.v. infusion of the ketone beta-hydroxybutyrate and glucagon separately and in combination, and the effect on hypoxic survival time in instrumented Levine rats (unilateral carotid ligation and hypoxic exposure) was determined. To test if the mechanism was a direct or osmotic effect of the alcohol, an equimolar dose of ethanol (47 mmol/kg) was administered and the effect on hypoxic survival time was compared with that produced by 1,3-butanediol. As in previous studies, 1,3-butanediol significantly increased hypoxic survival time (241% of control, Scheffe p less than 0.05). Various doses of beta-hydroxybutyrate and glucagon were infused to approximate the blood levels of beta-hydroxybutyrate and glucagon produced by a protective dose of 1,3-butanediol. Although beta-hydroxybutyrate or glucagon infusions produced blood levels of these substances that were comparable with those produced by administering butanediol, they failed to prolong hypoxic survival time as long as 1,3-butanediol. No correlation was detected between hypoxic survival time and blood levels of beta-hydroxybutyrate, glucagon, insulin, or glucose. An equimolar dose of ethanol did not significantly increase hypoxic survival time.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Catecholamines and their metabolites were determined by using high-performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection. Plasma 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylethyleneglycol concentrations were markedly elevated in subarachnoid hemorrhage patients with coma compared to those without, and the maximal concentrations observed in comatose patients never occurred in normal subjects or in patients with other neurological disorders. The mean maximal plasma concentrations of free catecholamines did not differ significantly between the comatose and noncomatose groups. Combining 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylethyleneglycol with homovanillic acid level data more clearly discriminated between the comatose and noncomatose subarachnoid hemorrhage groups. The results suggest that plasma concentration of 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylethyleneglycol, a major metabolite of brain noradrenaline, can be a prognostic discriminator for patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage and its discriminating power can be strengthened by combining it with homovanillic acid data.\r"

By potassium permanganate fixation, small cored vesicles containing fibers of noradrenergic nerve terminals made up 29.2% of all nerve fibers in the adventitia. The monoamine oxidase-containing nerves in the adventitia made up 31.4%. According to this study, sympathetic nerve terminal density in human superficial temporal arteries was assumed to consist of approximately 30% of all adventitial nerve terminals. In periadventitial nerve bundles, some unmyelinated axons contained monoamine oxidase activity. Thus, staining is considered to be useful in demonstrating the periadventitial and intervaricose fibers as well as the nerve terminals of sympathetic nerves in human cerebral arteries.\r"

Matching included sex, age, type of stroke, and presence or absence of hypertension and cardiac failure. Thirteen patients (22%) in the beta-blocker group died during a median followup of 41 months. Of the 60 patients not on beta-blockade at discharge, 21 (35%) died during a median followup of 36 months. By life-table technique and log-rank test, the relative risk for death was 0.60:1.00 (p = 0.14). During followup, 12 recurrent strokes were observed in patients on beta-blockers and 19 in patients without beta-blockers (relative risk 0.57:1.00; p = 0.12). It appeared that the reduction in mortality could only marginally be ascribed to fewer deaths from myocardial infarction; other causes of death were also less frequent in beta-blocker-treated patients. The results emphasize that supplementary information on the effect of beta-blocking agents on mortality after stroke is needed before a larger trial of beta-blocker therapy in patients with manifest cerebrovascular disease can be initiated.\r"

Angiographic findings in patients with objective pulsatile tinnitus included dural or pial arteriovenous malformations, occlusive disease of the intra- or extracranial carotid arteries from atherosclerosis or dissection, panarterial ectasia, and venous sinus thrombosis. Most of the patients with subjective pulsatile tinnitus had normal evaluations, but other possible causes of subjective pulsatile tinnitus included a carotid occlusion and pseudotumor cerebri. Pulsatile tinnitus is an uncommon symptom produced by a variety of causes. Given the abnormalities present in our series, we would recommend intraarterial digital subtraction angiography or conventional angiography in the evaluation of objective pulsatile tinnitus and intravenous digital subtraction angiography for subjective pulsatile tinnitus. Increased intracranial pressure must also be considered.\r"

While these pathophysiological mechanisms have gained enthusiastic experimental and theoretical support, the findings are preliminary and will require further large-scale clinical and epidemiological analyses to substantiate their roles as causal factors or potentiators of stroke. Documentation of measurable platelet and coagulation cascade abnormalities reported in healthy volunteers who have ingested alcohol will need to be confirmed on a broader scale in stroke patients with recent ethanol consumption. The risk of stroke in those with alcohol-induced atrial fibrillation and cardiomyopathy must be ascertained for the general population. While the experimental evidence is exciting and provocative, epidemiological evidence also suggests a link between alcohol consumption and stroke. Regular alcohol ingestion is associated with hypertension, fatal and nonfatal intracranial hemorrhage, cerebral infarction, and increased risk of death from stroke. Recent, less stringently controlled studies suggest that alcohol consumption is a risk factor for cerebral infarction in young adults with occasional ethanol intoxication and middle-aged women and young men with occasional alcohol intoxication and regular heavy drinking. Alcohol may also be a risk factor for subarachnoid hemorrhage.\r"

Synaptic transmission was lost at the same rate in response to either grade of hypoxia, but recovery was faster following mild hypoxia. Hyperexcitability of synaptic transmission was a lasting feature following moderate hypoxia, but it was transient following mild hypoxia; after mild hypoxia the strength of synaptic transmission eventually returned to normal. Extracellular calcium did not change during moderate hypoxia. The extracellular pH of slices was always more acid than the bath; pH decreased further in response to both moderate and mild hypoxia. Extracellular potassium increased more during moderate than during mild hypoxia, and a period of rapid potassium uptake was also more pronounced following moderate hypoxia. Extracellular DC potential demonstrated a small positive shift during hypoxia, more so during mild hypoxia. These experiments suggest that synaptic function can be reversibly suppressed in mildly hypoxic brain tissue without severe depolarization of neurons; in addition, the degree and duration of posthypoxic hyperexcitability are correlated with the degree of hypoxia and the magnitude of the release of K+ from cells into their environment.\r"

Using single harmonic regression analysis, the seasonal pattern of TIA and infarction, but not hemorrhage, fit a sine-cosine wavefunction with a 12-month period (R2 = 41% and 36%, respectively). For infarction, the strongest seasonal pattern was exhibited for women of all ages and for both sexes in the age groups 65-74 and 75-84, but only the sine component was significant. The peak months for TIA were June-August, while the peak months for infarcts were February-April. Correlations between ambient temperature and each type of stroke were computed. A significant positive correlation for TIA was found (r = 0.57, p = 0.01). After adjusting for a 2-month lag between the low for infarction and the peak for temperature, a significant negative correlation was found (r = -0.64, p = 0.01). No significant correlation was found for hemorrhage. Possible reasons for the opposite relations of TIA and infarct are discussed.\r"

However, chronic hyperglycemia and chronic hyperglycemia with additional acute elevation of blood glucose are more common premorbid states for stroke patients. The effect of chronic hyperglycemia on regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) is unclear but blood flow changes may play a role in this ischemic cell damage. We measured rCBF in awake restrained rats that had chronic hyperglycemia induced by treatment with streptozotocin. This was compared to that measured in rats made acutely hyperglycemic by injecting glucose into the peritoneal space. rCBF was measured in 17 brain regions using [14C]iodoantipyrine. During chronic hyperglycemia, when plasma glucose was 29 microns/ml, rCBF was decreased and a regional distribution of this effect was noted; 9 hindbrain regions showed a mean flow decrease of 14% while forebrain regions demonstrated less flow reduction. Acute elevation of plasma glucose during normoglycemia or superimposed on chronic hyperglycemia produced flow reductions of 7% for each 10 microns/ml increment in plasma glucose up to 60 microns/ml. Both chronic and acute hyperglycemia are associated with decreased rCBF and the mechanism for this effect does not appear to adapt to chronic hyperglycemia.\r"

Standardized suspensions of red cells as well as of red and white cells were filtered in a new filtration apparatus capable of discriminating between cell deformability and filter occlusion. Results show that red cell deformability, although slightly lower than in controls, is not significantly altered in stroke patients. Filter occlusion, however, was significantly higher in patients when red and white cell suspensions were filtered, but not when red cell suspensions were used, suggesting that white cell filterability is impaired after stroke, which could be due to decreased deformability and/or increased adhesiveness of leukocytes. Slowed white cell passage may also occur in the living microcirculation and may present an obstacle to nutritive flow in exchange vessels, possibly contributing to local ischemia and tissue necrosis after stroke.\r"

We performed PSC of the heart and the neck vessels in 27 stroke patients with suspected cardiac embolism and as control on 10 patients with atherosclerotic lesions of the carotid arteries without evidence of heart disease. The carotid PSC was positive in 6 of 10 patients with carotid disease, and twice in the 27 with suspected cardiac embolism. In these 27 the PSC of the heart indicated pathological conditions 13 times. Pathological platelet accumulations could be visualized in 3 cases in the atrial space, in 9 cases in the region of the left ventricle, and once at the aortic valve. Scintigraphy was negative in all 10 patients with atherosclerosis of the neck vessels. The two-dimensional echocardiography revealed pathological findings in 8 of the 13 patients with positive heart PSC (3 with intraventricular thrombi, 3 with valvular disease, 2 with decreased ventricular contractility) and was normal in the 10 control patients. Open-heart surgery was performed in 2 patients with pathological PSC and revealed an intracardiac thrombus. Three of 4 patients with positive atrial PSC showed mitral or aortic valve disease. These results suggest that PSC can provide a valuable method for detecting cardiac thrombi in stroke patients.\r"

In the medical group, the 325 patients with high normal hemoglobin concentration (15 g/l or more) suffered no more ischemic strokes than the 382 patients with lower values (less than 15 g/l). Those strokes that did occur were no more severe in the high than the low hemoglobin group. Hemoglobin concentration did not emerge as a prognostic factor in those patients treated surgically (n = 662). This prospective study counters the hypothesis that high normal hemoglobin concentration is associated with poor outcome in patients with symptomatic obstructive disease of the carotid and cerebral arteries.\r"

Among MEP's, SEP's were most significantly involved in all patients. Abnormalities in VEP's and AEBR's remained mild or moderate when the hemorrhage did not extend to the diencephalon. If SEP's were normal or mildly abnormal, they improved early the ictus. These patients did well clinically. If SEP's were absent, the patients had poor outcome even when the hemorrhage was small and located outside the internal capsule. In contrast, deterioration or persistence of MEP's indicated secondary insult to the brain and poor patient outcome. Early and serial MEP studies are useful in evaluating primary and secondary brain dysfunction and in predicting patient outcome in hypertensive putaminal hemorrhage.\r"

In the ipsilateral ectosylvian gyrus high-grade ischemia was produced as blood flow in the gray matter was reduced from 52.1 +/- 8.6 (mean +/- SE) to 13.3 +/- 9.0 ml/100 g/min and in the white matter from 33.8 +/- 5.6 to 6.1 +/- 6.4 ml/100 g/min. This significant reduction (p less than 0.05) was associated with abolition of the cortical component of the somatosensory evoked potentials. In all animals occlusion resulted in a predictable extended latency change and a variable amplitude response of the cortical component of the contralaterally recorded somatosensory evoked potentials. In 5 animals, oxygen availability was measured and spontaneous neuronal activity in the contralateral hemisphere was recorded. Volume expansion and hemodilution with either dextran or saline infusions elevated cerebral blood flow in the contralateral gray matter significantly (p less than 0.05) compared with the control and clip values. Ipsilateral spontaneous activity stopped within 4-12 minutes of occlusion, while contralateral spike activity persisted at rates at least equal to those recorded immediately following occlusion.\r"

Adrenergic denervation of cat basilar artery was accomplished by resection of the superior cervical ganglia or by injection of 6-hydroxydopamine into the cisterna magna. In vivo dose-response characteristics were determined for normal and for denervated arteries, and no significant differences were found between topical applications of serotonin, norepinephrine, epinephrine, fresh blood, or incubated blood. In addition, analysis of cat blood incubated in vitro revealed that the levels of serotonin, norepinephrine, and epinephrine diminished over time, whereas levels of hemoglobin and methemoglobin increased up to Day 14. The results of this study indicate that adrenergic denervation is not the cause of cerebral vasospasm and that, whatever the mechanism, hemoglobin is far more likely to play a role than are the other agents.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of changing intraluminal pressure on contractions induced by 70 mM potassium (K+) and 10(-7), 10(-6), and 10(-5) M serotonin (5-HT) were studied in vitro in bovine middle cerebral arteries. Changes in vessel outside diameter in whole-mounted cylindrical sections of artery were detected with a photoelectric infrared device. High K+-or 5-HT (10(-5)M)-induced contractions peaked at 25 mm Hg and were significantly correlated with increasing intraluminal pressure between 25 and 175 mm Hg. Contractions induced with lower concentrations of 5-HT (10(-6), 10(-7) M), norepinephrine, and histamine peaked at 75 mm Hg but were not significantly correlated with rising pressure. Phentolamine (2 X 10(-6) M) added to the extraluminal bath had negligible influence on pressure's ability to affect K+- and 5-HT-induced contractions differently. Reducing bath temperature to 27 degrees C reduced the K+ response at each pressure, but similar temperature changes had little affect on the 5-HT-induced contractions. The K+ response became less sensitive to increasing pressure at low temperatures. Nifedipine (10(-7) M) almost totally eliminated K+-induced contractions, while significantly reducing the responses to all concentrations of 5-HT. The 5-HT responses appeared more sensitive to increasing intraluminal pressure in the presence of nifedipine. Maximum Ca++-induced contractions in the presence of 10(-5) M 5-HT and high K+ occurred at 25 mm Hg, while Ca++-induced contractions and Ca++-induced contractions in the presence of 10(-7) 5-HT or K+ plus 5-HT were maximum at 75 mm Hg.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The platelets in both products were labeled with 111In oxine and infused into the donors. The pH of both products was above 6.0 at the end of storage. The units stored as platelet concentrates compared with those stored as granulocyte-platelet concentrates showed a higher percent release of beta-thromboglobulin, 18.4 +/- 4.0 percent versus 5.9 +/- 3.2 percent (mean +/- SD), but significantly better morphologic scores, 676 +/- 21 versus 525 +/- 56, and better osmotic recovery scores, 72 +/- 10 percent versus 40 +/- 7 percent, respectively (all p less than 0.05).

Human IgG anti-M, -S, and -s were purified by absorption-elution, incubated with platelet pellets from donors of different MNSs phenotypes, washed, and incubated with 125I-labeled mouse monoclonal anti-human IgG. In both assays, the platelet pellets were centrifuged through phthalate ester oils and the radioactivity in the pellets was counted. Dose-response curves and ligand bound per cell indicated no significant difference in the binding of mouse or human anti-M and anti-N to platelets from donors of the MM, MN, or NN phenotype or of human anti-S and anti-s to platelets from donors of the Ss or ss phenotype. Contrary to many previous studies, our data indicate that the MNSs antigens are not expressed on the circulating human platelet. Therefore, antibodies to these antigens probably do not play a role in refractoriness to platelet transfusion.\r"

His clinical history and the results of serologic studies and stool culture were consistent with a mild Salmonella gastroenteritis 5 days before donation. Antibiotic sensitivity patterns and plasmid profiles indicated that the organism (S. heidelberg) isolated from the donor's stool was identical to that isolated from the patient's blood and from the platelet bags. It is believed that low-grade, asymptomatic bacteremia in the donor was the source of infection in the recipient. Food and Drug Administration records contain reports of six septic deaths due to platelet transfusions since 1979, compared with none in the preceding 4 years. Increased use of platelet products and the standard practice of storage at room temperature may contribute to the risk of sepsis after platelet transfusion, particularly in immunocompromised patients.\r"

Transfused granulocytes were eliminated in both rapid and slow phases. Peak recovery was noted in the first sample, which was obtained 10 minutes after transfusion for each assay. The elimination kinetics were similar over 24 hours. These results confirm the value of using 111In-labeled granulocytes as a marker of transfused granulocytes.

RBC membranes were isolated from the patient as well as from controls with group A and O red cells. The membranes were incubated with uridine diphosphate (UDP)-N-acetyl-D-14C galactosamine in plasma from the patient and controls with group A and O red cells. RBC membranes from the patient behaved normally in that they incorporated the terminal carbohydrate responsible for blood group A activity. Scanning electron microscopy showed that the patient's RBCs had striking morphologic changes, with marked crenation and numerous knisocytes and dacryocytes. It was concluded that loss of the A antigen in this patient was not due to an abnormality of the enzyme required to convert H substance to A substance. It was postulated that weakening of the A antigen in some patients with leukemia may be related to a steric modification associated with abnormal red cell morphology.\r"

  ".W": "The authors present circumstantial evidence for the involvement of reactive hemolysis, i.e., C3-independent binding of the cytolytic C5b-9 complement complex to bystander red cells (RBC), in a case of intravascular immune hemolysis. Fresh serum obtained from a 6-year-old patient during the hemolytic episode, but not obtained thereafter, induced C5b-9-dependent hemolysis of human RBCs but the indirect C3 antiglobulin test remained negative. Particles (presumably RBC ghosts) isolated from the patient's plasma anticoagulated with EDTA at the peak of hemolysis were coated with C5b-9 complexes, whereas the direct antiglobulin test was strongly positive for IgA, only weakly positive for IgG, and negative for C3. Moreover, neither the autoantibodies isolated by elution (IgG plus IgA), nor free serum autoantibodies (IgA alone) activated complement in vitro. Additionally, serum samples collected later during the 12-month period of observation contained normal levels of C3, C4, C8, and C9, but markedly reduced levels of C7. These serums all produced strong reactive lysis in agarose plates, but not in test tubes. These results appear compatible with the working hypothesis that the intravascular hemolytic episode in this patient might have arisen through a local initiation of complement activation with subsequent C3-independent binding of C5b-9 to and hemolysis of bystander RBCs.\r"

They were also evaluated by a group of technologists to be more useful for general serologic work than panels created manually. Although the panels were created from a database of only 252 donors, an objective numeric evaluation showed that the panels were more useful than commercial panels. The computer approach used in this study may offer means of efficiently creating panels for general use as well as creating panels for resolution of particular serologic problems. They may also facilitate and encourage the construction of panels from small donor databases.\r"

Blood samples obtained initially and 56 days later were tested for hemoglobin, mean corpuscular volume (MCV), free erythrocyte protoporphyrin, serum ferritin, serum iron, total iron binding capacity (TIBC), and percent saturation of TIBC. The prevalence of gastrointestinal side effects was similar in both groups taking iron. At the end of the study there was no laboratory evidence of change in iron status in women who received carbonyl iron (n = 15). In those treated with ferrous sulfate (n = 17) the mean TIBC increased (p less than 0.001), and in the placebo group (n = 19) there were decreases in mean MCV (p less than 0.01), serum ferritin (p less than 0.001), and percent saturation (p = 0.027) with an increase in mean TIBC (p = 0.004). Carbonyl iron seems to be effective for short-term iron replacement in repeat blood donors and may have the advantage of decreased or absent risk of poisoning if accidentally ingested by children.\r"

The results, expressed as an IgE ethylene oxide index, were greater than 2 in 78 percent of serums from donors with allergic reactions and 12 percent of serums from controls. This association was significant (p less than 0.0001). Reactivity of the antibodies was directed against an ethylene oxide-human serum albumin conjugate and not against human serum albumin carrier protein. IgG antibodies with ethylene oxide specificity also were present in the serums of repeat plasmapheresis donors. Each of seven rabbits immunized with an ethylene oxide-protein conjugate responded with a high serum level of antibody with ethylene oxide specificity.

Alloantibodies had developed previously in 8 of the 12 patients. After chronic transfusion with selected donors, four new antibodies developed in three patients. Three antibodies were due to errors in phenotyping or matching, and one was due to an antigen that was not tested for in the protocol. The incidence of developing antibodies per unit transfused was diminished tenfold when selected donors were used. Autoantibodies developed in five patients (42%), but these did not seriously interfere with the transfusion therapy. It was concluded that matching for red cell antigens may diminish the incidence of alloimmunization in patients with sickle cell anemia requiring transfusion.\r"

This procedure can be performed safely under local anesthesia in an outpatient setting. Rectal cleansing and prophylactic antibiotics have minimized infectious complications following transrectal biopsy, and it remains the favored technique in patients with small lesions. Repeat biopsy under anesthesia is indicated when the clinical suspicion of malignancy remains high despite negative biopsies. In contrast to \"core\" needle biopsy, which obtains a cylinder of tissue for histologic examination, the fine-needle biopsy obtains a specimen for cytologic examination. If cytologic expertise is unavailable locally, the specimen may be fixed in the office and shipped to a major medical center for interpretation. Fine-needle aspiration may be safely employed to biopsy the prostate, pelvic masses, and inguinal and pelvic lymph nodes. Biopsy of palpable masses can be done simply and safely with morbidity akin to venipuncture. Nonpalpable tissues may be biopsied under radiographic guidance. Fine-needle aspiration biopsy is safe and cost-effective, has resulted in a significant improvement in the accuracy of our clinical staging, and has spared many patients unnecessary surgical procedures.\r"

Very rarely a scrotal hernia or a huge hydrocele obscures the cord, preventing administration of local anesthesia. Aside from these rare exceptions, I perform all scrotal surgery with local anesthesia. The use of preoperative sedation makes it possible for all patients to tolerate the small amount of discomfort associated with injection of a local anesthesic. Once the anesthetic is injected, scrotal surgery is painless. Regardless of the choice of local or general anesthesia, virtually all patients are discharged to home on the day of surgery.

Factors influencing the preoperative choice for vasovasostomy or vasoepididymostomy in patients undergoing vasectomy reversal are considered. The preoperative planned choice of vasovasostomy or vasoepididymostomy for patients having vasectomy reversal described herein does not have the support of all urologists who regularly perform these procedures. My present approach has evolved as the data reported in Tables 1 and 2 have become available, but it may change as new information is evaluated. However, it offers a logical method for planning choices of anesthesia and inpatient or outpatient status for patients undergoing vasectomy reversal procedures.\r"

Testicular biopsy may be performed easily on an outpatient basis with excision of a small piece of seminiferous tissue using a \"no-touch\" technique. Needle core biopsy and needle aspiration biopsy may become more widely used in the future. The role of flow cytometry for purposes of interpreting testicular specimens may be expanded in the future. Vasography should be performed only at the time of planned definitive correction of obstructive lesions of the genital duct system. Various techniques of performing vasography are discussed. Emphasis is placed on deferring vasography until the time that definitive surgery is performed to correct the patient's ductal obstruction. In that regard, vasography therefore generally is not performed as an isolated outpatient procedure.\r"

The general experience nationwide and particularly the experience at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and the University of Virginia Hospital indicate that outpatient surgery can be very safe and satisfactory for patients. The outpatient approach requires close cooperation among anesthesiologists, surgeons, and outpatient personnel. Excellent communication with the patient and family is essential. This includes extensive educational printed material and 24-hour availability by telephone. Once the infrastructure is in place, outpatient pediatric urologic surgery results in efficient use of facilities and a more pleasant surgical experience for the patient. The psychological, social, and economic benefits of outpatient surgery make it imperative that a large percentage of pediatric procedures be done on an ambulatory basis. We do not, however, intend to suggest that all minor procedures can be done on an outpatient basis, as certain special situations will mandate hospitalization.\r"

Significant underlying diseases were present in 8 patients: diabetes (6), von Gierke disease (1), hepatorenal syndrome (1). The diabetic children tended to have focal disease. Ten voiding cystourethrograms were performed and only four demonstrated reflux. All children became afebrile within a few days. Lobar nephronia was as clinically responsive as pyelonephritis to antibiotic therapy. Urine cultures were most often positive, although there was 1 patient in each category with negative cultures. Blood cultures were rarely positive in any group. Gram negative organisms predominated. CT scanning in children with clinical acute pyelonephritis reveals three major imaging patterns. While distinct radiographically, they behave in a similar clinical manner. Lobar nephronia does not imply a worse clinical prognosis. Intravenous antibiotic therapy alone was adequate for all patients.\r"

The dogs were sacrificed forty-eight to seventy-two hours (Group A) or twenty-eight to thirty-two days (Group B) post-treatment. Modest damage (hematoma and/or interstitial hemorrhage) was noted in all kidneys. Evidence of permanent change (fibrosis) was noted in both Group B kidneys. Complete necrosis of the kidney was not seen after administration of 8,000 shocks.

He did not seek medical attention, and some of the lesions had become quite large. The initial clinical impression was condyloma acuminatum, and prior to therapeutic intervention histologic evaluation revealed findings diagnostic of seborrheic keratosis. Seborrheic keratoses should be considered in the differential diagnosis of penile lesions especially because of clinical similarities to condylomata acuminata.\r"

Of 56 patients with histologically proved bladder tumors, 24 (43%) had positive urine cytology, 41 (73%) had positive FCM, and 45 (80%) had positive urine cytology and/or positive FCM. When bladder tumors were graded histologically, 8 of 11 patients (73%) with grade I bladder carcinoma, 22 of 28 patients (79%) with grade II, and 15 of 17 patients (88%) with grade III had positive urine cytology and/or positive FCM. Of the 28 patients with grade II, 12 with positive urine cytologic results had higher mean HIS (117.5) when compared with 16 (61.1) in whom urine cytology was negative. Of those who continued to have positive FCM in the face of negative findings on cystoscopic and urine cytologic examinations during follow-up, 3 patients eventually were found to have tumors (2 distal ureter, 1 bladder). These results indicate that FCM examinations for DNA distribution of bladder irrigation specimens are as useful as conventional urine cytology in the management of bladder tumors, can be more sensitive for detection and monitoring of the disease, and can contribute further to accurate diagnosis of the disease when combined with conventional urine cytology.\r"

Hyperthyroid patients had significantly increased micturition frequency as well as nocturia compared with their own control group when euthyroid (p less than 0.01). Hypothyroid patients had reduced micturition frequency compared with their own control group (p = 0.05). No significant changes were found in the euthyroid group. Which mechanisms might be responsible for the relationship between thyroid function and micturition pattern is debatable, and calls for further urodynamic and electrophysiologic studies. One conclusion is that thyroid disease should be borne in mind when patients present with unexplained urinary frequency or retention.\r"

A significant association was found between the incidence of myocardial infarction and the first component but not with the second component or the QT interval itself. The two components were found to be independent and thus to have the potential to act as confounding factors if the QT interval is examined alone. Further, our results suggest that correcting the QT interval for heart rate needs careful reassessment.\r"

There were no significant differences in MPV between the patient groups nor between patients and controls. Thirty patients with AMI were followed for 10 days and showed an initial 12% fall in platelet count followed by a 36% increase. Initially there was an increase in MPV (2%) followed by a fall (8%). The fall in platelet count and increase in MPV correlated with infarct size (maximum activity of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)) and might reflect consumption of platelets. The precise role of platelets in the process of infarction is still unknown.\r"

The incidence of type I diabetes was similar for the four age groups (15-19, 20-24, 25-29, 30-34 years), while for type II it was highest in the oldest group. Types I and II, but not the sexes, differed as regards the cumulative distribution curves of the maximum blood glucose concentration during the first two weeks after diagnosis.

Renal biopsy was done in two patients and revealed mild mesangial glomerulonephritis in both cases. One of these patients had IgA glomerulonephritis and Reiter's syndrome. Pyuria occurred in 16 patients (23%) and was frequently associated with Reiter's syndrome. Seventy-three patients with acute intrinsic renal failure were studied for the occurrence of acute Yersinia infection by determining Yersinia antibodies by ELISA. One out of 13 patients with acute glomerulonephritis but none of 60 patients with acute tubulointerstitial renal disease had acute Yersinia infection. Acute Yersinia infection seems to be rarely an etiologic factor in acute intrinsic renal failure. Our results indicate that transient proteinuria, microhematuria, pyuria or impaired renal function are frequent findings in patients with acute Yersinia infections. However, glomerulonephritis seems to be a rather infrequent and mild complication of acute Yersinia infection.\r"

The typical case of ACA starts with a limited inflammatory lesion, which is gradually replaced by atrophy and the skin shows a bluish, red discoloration. Late changes may be subluxation of joints in hands or feet and periosteal thickening. Capillary microscopy often reveals a clear picture of atrophy and a prominent, dilated subpapillary venular plexus. If localized to the leg the blood flow of the foot and lower leg may be increased, skin temperature elevated and venous capacity and return augmented. All these variables can consequently mimic venous insufficiency of the leg. ACA is caused by a Borrelia infection and serological testing will always show a significantly elevated titer to Borrelia. The disease is most often easily cured by 2-3 g of penicillin daily for two to three weeks.\r"

In no patient did VT result in loss of consciousness. The baseline plasma catecholamine concentrations did not correlate with the baseline right ventricular effective refractory period, the cycle length of induced VT, or the number of extrastimuli required to induce VT. Induced VT was not associated with a significant increase in the mean plasma epinephrine concentration. In contrast, the plasma norepinephrine concentration increased from a mean baseline level of 317 +/- 136 pg/ml (mean +/- standard deviation) to 418 +/- 220 pg/ml during VT (p less than 0.01) and increased further to 569 +/- 387 pg/ml shortly after VT (p less than 0.01). The plasma norepinephrine concentration shortly after VT correlated with the rate and duration of VT and with the magnitude of decrease in mean blood pressure during VT (p less than 0.05 for each). In eight patients the same configuration of VT was induced on two sequential attempts; in five patients the same number of extrastimuli were required for the second induction of VT as for the first, whereas in three patients fewer extrastimuli were required. Plasma catecholamine concentrations were not higher in patients requiring fewer extrastimuli to induce the second episode of VT, either shortly after the first episode of VT or shortly after the second episode of VT.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Twenty-one dogs underwent 2 hours of left anterior descending coronary artery ligation followed by reperfusion. Thallium was administered 5 minutes later and serial images were acquired over 3 hours. Of the 21 dogs, 15 had infarctions of which nine had initially reduced anterior wall thallium activity (group 1) and six had normal or increased activity (group 2). Six dogs did not have an infarction (group 3). All group 1 dogs demonstrated reduced clearance rates in the anterior wall (T1/2 = 15.0 +/- 4.7 hours, SD) compared to the posterior wall (T1/2 = 9.0 +/- 4.4 hours; p less than 0.001). Group 2 dogs demonstrated increased clearance rates in the anterior wall (T1/2 = 5.7 +/- 2.0 hours) compared to the posterior wall (T1/2 = 10.5 +/- 4.6 hours; p less than 0.001). Group 3 dogs demonstrated no difference in clearance rates. In conclusion, although thallium uptake is frequently reduced in nonsalvaged myocardium, tracer uptake can be normal or increased if perfusion has been completely restored. However, an increased clearance rate from the reperfused zone compared to the normal zone is a reliable indicator of nonsalvaged myocardium, despite normal initial thallium uptake.\r"

One consisted of a dissolution of muscle cells with inflammatory cell infiltrate. The other consisted of replacement fibrosis. The more the lumens of at least one of the three main coronary arteries were narrowed by atherosclerosis, the more the myocardial lesions occurred. The greater the number of vessels that were occluded, the more the incidence of myocardial lesions increased. From the age distribution of rabbits which died of natural causes, the average life span was estimated to be markedly shorter in homozygous WHHL rabbits than in normal rabbits. These findings suggest that WHHL rabbits suffered from ischemic heart disease, including acute myocardial infarction. Thus, this study shows that WHHL rabbits may be useful not only as a model of familial hypercholesterolemia but also for investigating the mechanisms of various clinical forms of ischemic heart disease.\r"

Triggered automaticity was induced in 6 of 10 muscles in the control group, in four of eight in the amiodarone-superfused group, and in three of four in the Tween 80-pretreated group. In contrast, triggered automaticity could be induced in only 2 of 10 of amiodarone-pretreated muscles (n = 10) (20 mg/kg intraperitoneally, daily for 4 weeks; p less than 0.05 compared to control and amiodarone-superfused groups). The amplitude of DAD was significantly lower in muscles isolated from rabbits pretreated with amiodarone compared to those from nontreated control rabbits (n = 17). The degree of reduction was significant during all three cycle lengths of stimulation tested (800, 600, and 400 msec), that is, 2.5 +/- 1.8 vs 5.1 +/- 1.8, 2.4 +/- 2.1 vs 5.5 +/- 2.3, and 3.3 +/- 3.4 vs 9.3 +/- 4.3, respectively (values are in millivolts of mean +/- SD). Superfusion with amiodarone (3 micrograms/ml; n = 8) significantly (p less than 0.05) reduced the amplitude of DAD at 800 msec cycle length, but had no significant effect at cycle lengths of 600 and 400 msec.

Shock energies of 25 and 50 joules were employed internally while 100 and 200 joules were delivered externally. Experiments were performed in both the presence and absence of a nearly toxic dose of ouabain. All shocks resulted in the occurrence of nonsustained (less than 15 seconds) ventricular tachycardia. When bursts of rapid ventricular pacing were synchronized with a shock, the pacing stimuli invariably captured the ventricles and overdrove the shock-induced ventricular tachycardia. However, the burst pacing never appeared to break a tachycardia, since the termination of pacing was followed immediately by the resumption of the shock-induced ventricular tachycardia. The presence of ouabain did not alter the response of the ventricles to postshock burst pacing. Administration of verapamil (0.5 mg/kg) had no effect on the duration of shock-induced ventricular arrhythmia. Elevation of the serum potassium level to 8.5 +/- 0.6 mEq/L drastically reduced the duration of postshock ventricular tachycardia in both the presence and absence of ouabain. The results suggest that postshock ventricular ectopy results from an abnormality of impulse initiation rather than reentry.\r"

It was the primary purpose of this study to determine total and unbound concentrations of quinidine and 3-hydroxyquinidine in 25 patients receiving quinidine for therapeutic purposes. At the peak, total quinidine and 3-hydroxyquinidine concentrations were 2.7 +/- 1.2 micrograms/ml and 0.57 +/- 0.33 micrograms/ml, respectively, and at the trough they averaged 2.0 +/- 0.91 micrograms/ml and 0.44 +/- 0.25 micrograms/ml. Interestingly, the unbound 3-hydroxyquinidine concentration frequently exceeded the unbound quinidine concentration, averaging 0.30 +/- 0.28 micrograms/ml at the peak and 0.22 +/- 0.14 micrograms/ml at the trough. Quinidine concentrations averaged 0.24 +/- 0.15 micrograms/ml and 0.18 +/- 0.12 micrograms/ml. The ratio of unbound 3-hydroxyquinidine: quinidine was significantly influenced by the unbound clearance of quinidine (r = 0.66). At low clearance values concentrations of both substances were elevated, with the quinidine concentration consistently exceeding that of 3-hydroxyquinidine. In contrast, at high clearance values 3-hydroxyquinidine concentrations were elevated and consistently exceeded the quinidine concentration. Thus, when quinidine concentrations are used to monitor the pharmacodynamic effect of quinidine, it is most appropriate to evaluate unbound concentrations of both quinidine and 3-hydroxyquinidine.\r"

An attempt was made to individualize P wave parameters which may be associated with these pathologic conditions. On each atrial signal a 512-point fast Fourier transform was used. The original sample was divided into 18 classes, and the mean values of some parameters of each class were computed. The results of fast Fourier transform computing and of the mean values of parameters for both patients and healthy subjects show two different behaviors with respect to the amplitude-frequency relationships and mean peak-to-peak amplitude, respectively. The present results indicate that this technique may be useful for further detailed analysis of P waves.\r"

  ".W": "A prospective comparison of physiologic response to single-rate ventricular and dual-chamber atrioventricular pacing was conducted in 14 pediatric patients (age 1 to 24 years, median 14) with symptomatic nonsurgical second- or third-degree atrioventricular block. All patients were studied acutely during cardiac catheterization before and after 1 hour of both pacing modes. Following pacemaker implant, eight patients were reevaluated after 1 month of each mode with symptom questionnaire, resting ECG, resting echocardiogram, and Doppler cardiac output measurement at rest and at peak treadmill exercise. Cardiac outputs (mean +/- standard error) increased acutely (n = 14) with both ventricular (32 +/- 12%) and dual-chamber (39 +/- 10%) pacing over intrinsic rhythm values (p less than 0.01 in both). During chronic pacing (n = 8), symptoms were reported only with the ventricular mode. Dual-chamber synchronous pacing was associated with improved mean resting shortening fraction and cardiac output, slower mean resting sinus rate (89 +/- 5 compared to 73 +/- 4 bpm (p less than 0.02), and a 23% increase in mean excerise cardiac output (4.2 +/- 0.4 compared to 3.4 +/- 0.3 L/min/m2) compared to single-rate ventricular pacing. Exercise-induced dysrhythmias occurred only with ventricular pacing. This study demonstrates that pediatric patients with nonsurgical atrioventricular block can compensate for loss of atrioventricular synchrony at rest but exhibit improved cardiac function with chronic dual-chamber atrioventricular compared to single-rate ventricular pacing.\r"

This view may also be useful in assessment of RV free wall and RV septal wall motion. However, the accuracy of volumes derived from biplane angiocardiography with the use of the axial cranial oblique projection has not been adequately validated or compared to conventional views. Nineteen RV animal casts whose volume was determined by water displacement were filmed in conventional posteroanterior/lateral (PA/Lat), 30-degree right anterior oblique/60-degree left anterior oblique (30 degrees RAO/60 degrees LAO) views and in angulated 35-degree right anterior oblique/55-degree left anterior oblique/30-degree cranial (35 degrees RAO/55 degrees LAO/30 degrees Cr) view. Tracings of biplane cast images were analyzed for RV volume by Simpson's rule. RV cast volume was significantly overestimated by 12.2 +/- 6.8, 6.0 +/- 5.3, and 9.3 +/- 9.5 ml in PA/Lat, 30 degrees RAO/60 degrees LAO, and 35 degrees RAO/55 degrees LAO/30 degrees Cr views, respectively.

  ".W": "All traditional techniques of regional ventricular function analysis depend upon one or more assumptions about coordinate, reference, or indexing systems, idealized ventricular geometry, and the uniformity of ventricular contraction. Therefore, a method of shape analysis was developed that allows the quantitation of regional curvature and is independent of the assumptions outlined. This was implemented on a commercial image processing unit and applied to silhouettes of 30-degree right anterior oblique left ventriculograms. Three groups with abnormal wall motion (anterior abnormality, n = 23; inferior abnormality, n = 23; anterior and inferior abnormalities, n = 22) were analyzed and compared to a group with normal regional function (n = 22). Relatively few significant quantitative curvature differences were noted at end diastole among the groups. These few abnormalities described a slight increase in curvature or globularity of the anterior and inferior walls. More marked and extensive aberrations were detected at end systole. The group with anterior wall motion disturbances showed four distinct areas of curvature abnormality. Excessive curvature was present on either side of the apex (anterior and inferoapical regions) and apical curvature was less than normal. The fourth region was in the inferior zone, which showed curvature values that were less than normal, suggesting increased inward motion contralateral to the anterior abnormality. The group with inferior wall motion abnormalities also showed excessive end-systolic curvature on either side of the apex (diaphragmatic and anteroapical zones) and deficient curvature at the apex. A combination of these regional morphologic abnormalities was noted in the group with both anterior and inferior dysfunction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

This study evaluates a simplified method for measuring volume flow at the mitral valve orifice. In four open-chest dogs the simplified mitral valve method was compared to a previously described mitral orifice method for Doppler volume flow calculation and to data obtained by electromagnetic flow measurement. Cardiac output varied from 1.4 to 7.7 L/min. Correlation for both the Doppler method and the electromagnetic meter volume flows was r = 0.98 to 0.99, and there was no significant difference between the two methods. In a clinical pilot study, 10 children were studied in the catheterization laboratory, and the simplified Doppler flow method was compared to thermodilution cardiac output measurements with good results. The study indicates that the simplified mitral valve method provides acceptable accuracy for Doppler cardiac output measurement.\r"

Forty-eight percent (21 of 44) of dancers had echocardiographic mitral valve prolapse compared with 10% (5 of 52) of controls (p less than 0.01). The dancers weighed less than the controls and had significantly smaller bony diameters and body circumferences. However, only ponderal index was predictive of mitral valve prolapse in both dancers and controls. Thus, echocardiographic mitral valve prolapse is associated with low body weight relative to height and neither to ballet dancing nor to a distinct body habitus. Echocardiographic mitral valve prolapse may represent a normal variant in the majority of asymptomatic, thin subjects without auscultatory findings.\r"

To assess if cardiac chamber enlargement modulates these effects, we measured cardiac size, shape, wall motion, and cardiac displacement via serial underwater two-dimensional echocardiography. Six normal volunteers underwent 2.5 hours of WI to the neck, seated, at 34.5 degrees C. Recovery was 30 minutes. The size of both atria increased significantly but transiently during the study (p less than 0.0001 for left atrium, and p = 0.0020 for right atrium). Both atria returned to baseline size during WI. Moreover, for left atrium there was a small overshoot in recovery. Neither left ventricular nor right ventricular dimensions nor ejection fraction changed significantly. Also, no shape changes were detected, although WI was associated with upward and lateral displacement of the acoustic windows. Correlation coefficients (r) for left atrial, or right atrial size vs urinary excretion of sodium or urine volume size ranged from 0.05 to 0.36. These results, in sum, suggest that strong compensatory mechanisms are counteracting the effect of WI on distended cardiac receptors, and that cardiac receptor activation alone does not constitute the afferent limb of the reflex mediating the renal effects of head-out WI.\r"

  ".W": "Repair of coarctation of the aorta may not prevent the subsequent development of elevated systemic blood pressure at rest or with exercise. The correlates of late postoperative resting systolic blood pressure and maximal exercise systolic blood pressure levels were investigated in a retrospective study of 42 patients who had graded exercise tests after correction of coarctation of the aorta. The independent variables studied included height, weight, body surface area, age at surgery, age at exercise testing, the time interval between surgery and exercise testing, the highest systolic blood pressure prior to surgery, gradient across the coarctation at preoperative catheterization, and the residual postoperative gradient across the coarctation. The same combination of independent variables provided the best regression model for explanation of the variance of both postoperative resting and maximal exercise systolic blood pressure. The models included height, highest preoperative systolic blood pressure, and residual gradient. None of the other variables added significant explanatory ability to either model. These findings suggest that the preoperative level of systolic blood pressure may be the best determinant of timing the corrective surgery. It may be possible to defer the operation, as long as blood pressure remains normal, until an age when repair is less likely to result in recurrent coarctation.\r"

Post-cardiac surgery etiology was seen only after 1980, but constituted 29% of cases during 1980-1985. Postradiotherapy etiology occurred with equal incidence in 1980-1985 and in 1970-1980, but the interval from radiotherapy to presentation with constrictive pericarditis was longer in the more recent period (11 vs 4.75 years). Effusive constrictive pericarditis occurred in 24% overall with similar prevalence in all of the etiologic groups except the postsurgical cases, which were caused by noneffusive fibrous constrictive pericarditis in all instances. Operative mortality was 12% overall: It was lower in the idiopathic group (8%) and higher in the postradiotherapy group (21%). Thus postradiotherapy constrictive pericarditis continues to occur despite technical changes aimed at reducing its likelihood, but recent cases have a longer latent period: and postsurgical constrictive pericarditis has emerged as an important etiology.\r"

During 30 years of surveillance, 760 men and 578 women developed a first overt clinical manifestation of coronary heart disease. NSA-ECG appears to be a hallmark of a compromised coronary circulation which predicted the occurrence of every clinical manifestation of coronary heart disease independently of known risk factors including hypertension, its chief determinant. Coronary morbidity and mortality was increased twofold in each sex. The more common T-wave abnormality alone carried a significant increased risk, although the combination of S-T and T-wave seemed most hazardous. Persons who develop NSA-ECG without other explanation warrant vigorous preventive management against coronary heart disease.\r"

VPBs appear to be without an independent influence. Inclusion of ECG variables in the predictive model for SD has little effect on identifying those at risk for sudden unexpected death, but it improves substantially the predictive value in persons with known CHD.\r"

  ".W": "In this article we examine the production of very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) by perfused livers obtained from chow- and cholesterol-fed nonhuman primates. These data illustrate two important features of VLDL production. First, VLDL is secreted from the liver in a form very close to that of its plasma counterpart. Thus for chow-fed animals, plasma VLDL and liver perfusate VLDL have similar lipid compositions. Second, the composition of VLDL can be modified significantly by diet in each of two primate species, the Rhesus monkey and the baboon. Rhesus monkey livers uniformly secrete larger quantities of VLDL and show more dramatic dietary effects than do baboon livers. Nevertheless, perfused livers from both species reveal qualitatively similar responses to dietary peanut oil and to lard fed in combination with cholesterol. Both fat-containing diets induce the livers to secrete VLDL enriched in cholesteryl ester compared with control perfusates yet still cholesteryl ester deficient compared with the animals' plasma VLDL. Peanut oil diet reduces the hepatic output of VLDL-associated apoprotein B and triglyceride, whereas lard increases hepatic secretion of VLDL-associated lipids and apoprotein E. We conclude that the nature of dietary fat plays an important role in determining the profile and composition of lipoproteins formed and secreted by the primate liver. We have also briefly reviewed the production of high-density lipoprotein, which is probably formed in the plasma from many sources, with special emphasis on the possible role of newly secreted lipid-poor apolipoprotein A-I and A-II.\r"

The total sequence of apo B100 messenger ribonucleic acid has been revealed by the work from our group, as well as other groups. The sequence spans 13,689 nucleotides from the initiation to the stop codon. Thus the messenger has the capacity to code for 4563 amino acids corresponding to a molecular weight of approximately 510,000. Computer analyses revealed the presence of regions with amphipathic alpha-helix and of hydrophobic regions with a high probability of beta-structure. Regions of the molecule are characterized by continuous variations between hydrophillic and hydrophobic sequences, the latter coinciding with a high probability of beta-structure. It is suggested that this beta-structure is involved, together with the amphipathic alpha-helix, in the binding of apo B100 to the lipid. Pulse-chase studies in Hep G2 cells showed that apo B100 is synthesized as one protein, with a translation time of 14 minutes. The protein is transferred through the cell and secreted within 30 minutes without undergoing any major change in molecular mass. The residence kinetics in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is characterized by an increase during the first 10 to 15 minutes of chase followed by an almost linear decrease with a decay rate of 6%/min. The transfer through the ER to the Golgi apparatus accounts for one third of the time needed for the intracellular transfer of apo B100, whereas two thirds of the time is required for the transfer through the later part of the secretory pathway.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "87124370\r", 
  ".W": "In the normal animal and in humans, low-density lipoproteins (LDL) are removed from the plasma by both receptor-dependent and receptor-independent transport mechanisms. Most of the receptor-dependent transport activity is found in the liver, whereas the receptor-independent transport process is widely distributed in many organs. In the steady state the plasma LDL-cholesterol concentration is determined by the rate of LDL production, relative to the rate of LDL removal from the vascular space. This rate of removal in turn is determined by three transport parameters: Jm, the maximal transport rate for the receptor-dependent process in the whole animal; Km, the concentration of LDL-cholesterol in the plasma at which half Jm is achieved; and P, the proportionality constant for the receptor-independent transport process. The values of these parameters are now known for several species, including humans and provide the basis for understanding how the plasma LDL-cholesterol concentration is altered by environmental factors such as aging and diet. With aging, for example, there appears to be no change in the receptor-dependent transport process, and in those situations in which the plasma LDL-cholesterol level rises, this increase appears to be caused by overproduction of LDL. With cholesterol feeding the plasma LDL-cholesterol level rises because of an increase in the LDL production rate coupled with a decrease in the maximal transport rate for the receptor-dependent process. The addition of saturated triglycerides to the diet further suppresses the Jm value, whereas unsaturated lipids enhance the maximal transport rate for LDL and lowers the plasma LDL-cholesterol level.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "To study the regulation of lipid metabolism in human liver, we have developed assay systems for three rate-determining microsomal enzymes of hepatic cholesterol metabolism: 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase (regulating cholesterol biosynthesis), cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase (governing bile acid formation), and acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT; rate limiting for cholesterol esterification). In addition, we have obtained an assay for low-density lipoprotein binding to its specific receptor in human liver, and we have studied a possible rate-determining enzymatic step in triglyceride biosynthesis, cytosolic phosphatidic acid phosphatase. These assays allow us to study the effects of metabolic perturbations on hepatic lipid metabolism in humans and thus to evaluate the important role of the liver in lipoprotein synthesis and degradation.\r"
