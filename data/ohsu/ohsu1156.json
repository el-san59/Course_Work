Direct antigen testing of all pregnant women would be cost-effective if the test cost less than $6.30 or the prevalence of infection exceeded 6%. However, the positive predictive value of the test was only 51%. Culturing was not cost-effective until the prevalence of infection exceeded 14.8%. If a direct antigen test cost less than $3.90 or prevalence exceeded 8.7%, direct antigen testing of all women and using culture to confirm positive direct antigen tests would be cost-effective. If a direct antigen test cost $8.00 and culture cost $25.00, the excess cost of performing a direct antigen test in all women and confirming positive results with culture would be $2.09 per pregnant woman. Screening all pregnant women for chlamydia is not cost-effective, but the excess cost is modest when direct antigen tests are used.\r"

To assess the potential benefit of synergistic therapy for the prevention of postoperative adhesion formation, these agents were studied in a rabbit uterine horn model. Four groups of New Zealand White rabbits (n = 8 per group) had a bilateral devascularization injury to the uterine horns. Before closure saline solution, verapamil hydrochloride (2.5 mu/kg/hour), recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (4 mg total dose), or a combination of verapamil and recombinant tissue plasminogen activator at the stated doses were instilled by means of an Alzet osmotic pump x 200 hours. Adhesion scores were evaluated after this time period by estimating the total uterine horn surface involved in adhesions at a terminal laparotomy and by clinically grading the response to determine whether minimal adhesions formed. Results of the total uterine horn surface scores were (mean score +/- SE): saline solution, 44% +/- 3.7%; verapamil, 19% +/- 4.8%; recombinant tissue plasminogen activator, 11% +/- 3.6%; combined, 3% +/- 1% (p less than 0.01 to control and p less than 0.05 to single-drug therapy). Results of the number of animals per group with minimal adhesions were as follows: saline solution, 0; verapamil, 1; recombinant tissue plasminogen activator, 3; combined, 8 (P less than 0.01). These results show a synergistic benefit of verapamil and recombinant tissue plasminogen activator to prevent postsurgical adhesion formation when delivered via the intraperitoneal route.\r"

A quantitative enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) demonstrated CAA in 82% of the serum and 89% of the urine samples from these 28 patients. To evaluate the possibility of circadian variability in urine CAA levels, samples were examined in 15 patients at four intervals during a 24-hour period. No significant differences in CAA titers were observed. Seventeen patients were subsequently treated with praziquantel and followed for six weeks. CAA titers in serum and urine decreased significantly one week after therapy. Thereafter, the profile of CAA titer in urine continued to show a parallel but delayed decline compared to that in serum. While all serum CAA titers became negative three to six weeks after treatment, urine titers were negative in 47% at three weeks and 69% at six weeks. The remaining positive patients had low titers. A significant quantitative correlation in CAA titer was found between serum and urine before and after treatment. Seventeen Egyptian control subjects with no active schistosome infection were negative for CAA in both serum and urine. Our results confirm that the CAA urine assay could be used as a sensitive and non-invasive method to diagnose the disease, and indicate that the assay can be used to monitor efficacy of schistosome chemotherapy.\r"

  ".W": "Interest in low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWHs) as potential antithrombotic agents was stimulated by two observations in the mid-1970s and early 1980s. The first was finding that LMWH fractions prepared from unfractionated heparin (UFH) progressively lost their ability to prolong the activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) while retaining their ability to inhibit Factor Xa. The second was the observation that LMWHs prepared by chemical depolarization of UFH are antithrombotic in experimental animal models but produce less microvascular bleeding in experimental models for an equivalent antithrombotic effect than the UFH from which they are derived. Subsequently, it was shown that LMWHs inhibit platelet function and impair vascular permeability less than standard heparin and that LMWHs have a longer biological half-life than standard heparin. A number of LMWHs have been evaluated in clinical trials in general and orthopedic surgery and in the treatment of venous thrombosis. LMWHs are highly effective in orthopedic surgery, where they appear to be more effective than standard heparin. LMWHs have also been shown to be either as effective or more effective than UFH in preventing postoperative thrombosis following general surgery. In preliminary studies, LMWHs appear to be as effective as standard heparin in the treatment of venous thrombosis, but larger studies are required using clinically relevant outcome measures.\r"

  ".W": "A theoretical analysis was performed regarding the cost-effectiveness in terms of lives saved (reduction of fatal pulmonary embolism [PE]) and in terms of money (dollars spent for prevention and treatment) of seven strategies in the management of venous thromboembolic disease in patients over 39 years of age undergoing elective total hip replacement (THR). Strikingly, this theoretical analysis suggests that low-dose warfarin combined with clinical surveillance of deep vein thrombosis would reduce the incidence of fatal PE from 20 per 1,000 patients to 4 per 1,000 patients and simultaneously reduce the charges for venous thromboembolic disease from $550,000 to about $400,000 per 1,000 patients. Based on this analysis, we strongly recommend this measure on a routine basis. Adding venography or duplex sonography routinely to this prophylactic regimen would, in this theoretical analysis, reduce the incidence of fatal PE from 4 per 1,000 patients to 0.15 per 1,000, but adds charges of $200,000 per extra life saved in the case of routine venography and $50,000 in the case of routine sonography. Low-dose warfarin prophylaxis combined with routine sonography does not generate more charges than no prophylaxis with no screening while drastically reducing the incidence of fatal PE from 20 to 0.3 per 1,000 patients. Where duplex sonography is not easily available, a 12-week postoperative course of low-dose warfarin for every patient with no routine screening will be efficacious in reducing fatal PE and as cost-effective.\r"

In the third trial, this protocol was compared with unfractionated heparin calcium given in a standardized manner and appeared to be significantly superior both in efficacy and tolerance. In the fourth trial, the protocol was adapted for use in spinal subarachnoidal anesthesia; 20 mg of enoxaparin, 2,000 anti-factor Xa IU, was given subcutaneously 1 hour after anesthesia and 40 mg 12 hours later. In all these trials tolerance was good. Excessive bleeding did not occur with the 40 mg once daily regimen. Efficacy was good and compared favorably with other protocols in use.\r"

A double-blind, randomized trial comparing low-molecular-weight heparin (enoxaparin) with placebo for the prevention of venous thrombosis in patients undergoing elective hip surgery was carried out. Prophylactic treatment with a fixed dose was begun postoperatively and continued for 14 days. Fifty patients in each treatment group underwent surveillance with 125I-fibrinogen leg scanning and impedance plethysmography. In the first 24 patients, venography was performed only if their surveillance test was positive. Venography was requested in the remaining 76 patients even if the screening tests were negative; in this latter group, venous thrombosis occurred in 4 patients (10.8%) given enoxaparin and 20 patients (51.3%) given placebo (p = 0.0002). The corresponding rates for proximal vein thrombosis were 5.4% and 23.1%, respectively (p = 0.029). In the entire group of 100 patients, venous thrombosis occurred in 12% of those given enoxaparin and 42% of those given placebo (p = 0.0007). The corresponding rates for proximal vein thrombi were 4% and 20%, respectively (p = 0.014). The observed hemorrhagic rate was 5% in each treatment group. The results of this study show that prophylaxis with fixed-dose enoxaparin is effective and safe for patients undergoing elective hip replacement.\r"

Hypercapnia (Paco2, 73.5 +/- 2.3 mm Hg, mean +/- SD) increased heart rate, stroke volume, and cardiac output but decreased systolic shortening in the base of the left ventricle. Hypocapnia (PaO2, 24 +/- 1.5 mm Hg) decreased cardiac output and coronary flow below levels seen with hypercapnia but not below levels seen with normocapnia. Systolic shortening decreased in both apical and basal regions, and left ventricular relaxation was impaired as evidenced by a reduction of the nadir of LV dP/dt. Hypoxemia (PaO2, 39 +/- 1.5 mm Hg) elicited a hyperdynamic response of the circulation, increased coronary blood flow, and exhausted the coronary flow reserve. Neither changes in PaCO2 nor changes in PaO2 caused postsystolic shortening, although hypercapnia caused nonuniformity of contraction in the left ventricle. Thus, marked alterations in oxygen and carbon dioxide tensions do not cause left ventricular dysfunction, even though moderate hypoxia reduces the coronary flow reserve.\r"

The physician and the patient rated the patient's overall ocular condition on days 3, 8, and 15. On day 15 both the physician and the patients rated the pentigetide group as significantly (Chi-square, P less than .05) more improved than the cromolyn sodium group. The physician rated independently conjunctival symptoms and ocular signs at days 1, 3, 8, and 15. Improvement in signs and symptoms favored pentigetide in the majority of comparisons to cromolyn sodium (14 of 18). The pentigetide group showed significantly (ANOVA, P less than .05) greater improvement in hyperemia, edema, lacrimation, and blurred vision/photophobia. Patients completed daily diaries for seven symptoms. At the end of the study, comparisons to baseline between groups favored the pentigetide group for six of the seven symptoms; for itching, improvement favored significantly (ANOVA, P less than .05) the pentigetide group. The mean severity of all symptoms decreased by 64% in the pentigetide group as compared with a decrease of 46% in the cromolyn sodium group. Adverse experiences were minor and comparable in both groups. No clinically abnormal changes were noted for visual acuity, intraocular pressure, or common laboratory tests. This double-blind, active-controlled trial demonstrates that pentigetide, 0.5%, ophthalmic solution is safe and effective in the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis.\r"

To elucidate the biologic relevance of these cytokines to the pathogenesis of psoriasis, we investigated serum levels of interleukin 1 alpha, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and interferon gamma in 21 patients with psoriasis vulgaris, together with 21 healthy controls. The mean serum levels of interleukin 1 alpha and tumor necrosis factor alpha were not significantly different from those in controls, while those of interferon gamma were significantly elevated in the patients with psoriasis. Serum levels of interleukin 1 alpha correlated negatively with clinical disease severity expressed as psoriasis area and severity index score and with duration of psoriasis. In contrast, interferon gamma levels were related, although not significantly, to disease severity. In addition, an inverse correlation was noted between the interleukin 1 alpha levels and interferon gamma levels. These results indicate that interleukin 1 alpha and interferon gamma may be relevant to the induction and perpetuation, respectively, of the inflammatory responses in psoriasis, and that these cytokines, which have similar biologic properties, may strictly regulate one another's production in vivo.\r"

DESIGN--Randomised study from February 1986; randomisation to neutron treatment or photon treatment was unstratified and in the ratio of 3 to 1 until January 1988, when randomisation was in the ratio 1 to 1 and stratified by site of tumour. SETTING--Mersey regional radiotherapy centre at Clatterbridge Hospital, Wirral. PATIENTS--151 patients with locally advanced, non-metastatic pelvic cancer (27 cervical, 69 of the bladder, seven prostatic, and 48 of the rectum). INTERVENTION--Randomisation to neutron treatment was stopped in February 1990. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Patient survival and causes of death in relation to the development of metastatic disease and treatment related morbidity. RESULTS--In the first phase of the trial 42 patients were randomised to neutron treatment and 14 to photon treatment, and in the second phase 48 to neutron treatment and 47 to photon treatment. The relative risk of mortality for photons compared with neutrons was 0.66 (95% confidence interval 0.40 to 1.10) after adjustment for site of tumour and other important prognostic factors. Short term and long term complications were similar in both groups. CONCLUSIONS--The trial was stopped because of the increased mortality in patients with cancer of the cervix, bladder, or rectum treated with neutrons.\r"

DESIGN--Prospective study of patients referred by general practitioners. SETTING--Outpatient allergy clinic in a district general hospital. PATIENTS--175 referred patients who gave a history of immediate type reaction to penicillin, of whom 144 attended as requested and 132 completed the investigations. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--History and examination, serum radioallergosorbent test to phenoxymethylpenicillin and benzylpenicillin, and oral challenge with penicillin. RESULTS--Of 132 patients, four were confirmed to have penicillin allergy by the radioallergosorbent test and 128 had an oral penicillin challenge without ill effect. CONCLUSIONS--Most patients who gave a history of penicillin allergy are not so allergic, and their actual allergic state should be substantiated whenever feasible. For patients reporting minor or vague reactions negative findings with a radioallergosorbent test to phenoxymethylpenicillin and benzylpenicillin provide sufficient evidence to give oral penicillin safely.\r"

  ".W": "Inverse ratio ventilation (IRV) has been reported to improve oxygenation at lower peak airway pressures in patients with respiratory failure. Therefore we hypothesised that IRV might also improve oxygen exchange during anaesthesia. Conventional ratio ventilation (CRV) and IRV were compared in 24 low-risk surgical patients who were paralysed and whose lungs were ventilated with air/O2 by a non-rebreathing circuit and a Siemens 900-C servo ventilator. Two levels of time-cycled IRV (I:E ratios of 60/40 and 77/23) were bracketed by control periods with CRV (I:E ratio of 35/65). Inspired O2 fraction, O2 uptake and CO2 elimination, arterial blood gases, pulmonary ventilation and mechanics, heart rate and blood pressure were measured. From these data alveolar and dead space ventilation and four oxygen tension-based indices of gas exchange were calculated. During IRV, mean airway pressure (mean AWP) was increased but there were no changes in oxygen exchange indices, pulmonary mechanics, HR or BP. A sub-set of the sample with moderately impaired oxygen exchange, defined as the upper quartile for (A-a)DO2, was examined separately with identical results. Multivariate models were tested to identify variables which predicted O2 exchange during CRV. Patient age was the only predictor consistently significant in all models. We conclude that age is an important determinant of impaired pulmonary oxygen exchange during anaesthesia, and that increasing mean AWP by TC-IRV has no beneficial effects on pulmonary mechanics or gas exchange.\r"

This is particularly true when infarct size is measured after at least 48 hours of reperfusion, when the full extent of myocardial damage has become apparent. Dimethylthiourea (DMTU) is an extremely diffusible, potent scavenger of hydroxyl radical, hydrogen peroxide, and hypochlorous acid, with a long half-life of 43 hours. Sixteen chloralose-anesthetized dogs underwent 90 minutes of left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) occlusion followed by 48 hours of reperfusion. Collateral flow was measured by radioactive microspheres. Infarct size and risk area were measured by a postmortem dual-perfusion technique using triphenyl tetrazolium chloride and Evan's blue dye. In eight dogs, therapy with DMTU (500 mg/kg i.v.) was given during the last 15 minutes of ischemia and the first 15 minutes of reperfusion. In eight control dogs, the same volume of 0.9% saline was given during the last 15 minutes of ischemia through the first 15 minutes of reperfusion. Infarct size as a percent of risk area was reduced in the DMTU-treated group compared with the saline-treated controls (DMTU = 42 +/- 4% versus saline = 59 +/- 4%, p less than 0.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "91243310\r", 
  ".W": "A role for altered endothelial cell function is emerging in the pathogenesis of disease. We have previously demonstrated that Dirofilaria immitis, the canine heartworm, depresses endothelium-dependent responses and alters the mechanism of relaxation in the in vivo femoral artery of infected dogs. Exposure of rat aorta to the parasite or parasite-conditioned medium selectively depresses endothelium-dependent relaxation. D. immitis is closely related to the major human filarial pathogens. This study was designed to examine the effect of chronic infection with the filarial nematode Brugia pahangi on endothelium-mediated responses of the rat aorta in vitro. We tested the hypothesis that endothelium-dependent responses are depressed in the aorta from rats infected with B. pahangi. Rings of thoracic and abdominal aorta were suspended in muscle baths for measurement of isometric tension. Dose-response relations to norepinephrine, endothelium-dependent dilators (acetylcholine, histamine, and A23187), and nitroglycerin were done. In some experiments, inhibitors of cyclooxygenase (indomethacin and aspirin), guanylate cyclase (methylene blue), and nitric oxide formation (N-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester; L-NOARG) were used. No differences in vascular reactivity were detected in the thoracic aorta. In contrast, endothelium-dependent responses in abdominal aorta of Brugia-infected rats were significantly depressed when compared with control aorta from noninfected rats. Acetylcholine relaxation was further depressed by indomethacin and aspirin. After L-NOARG, acetylcholine relaxation in control abdominal aorta was completely abolished; however, in abdominal aorta of Brugia-infected rats, acetylcholine still caused relaxation. Methylene blue inhibited acetylcholine relaxation in both control and Brugia-infected abdominal aorta; however, relaxation in Brugia-infected aorta was significantly greater than control. This study demonstrates that endothelium-dependent relaxation can be altered by chronic experimental filarial infection in the absence of direct contact between the blood vessel and the parasite. The mechanism of relaxation in the Brugia-infected abdominal aorta appears to be altered when compared with control, suggesting that parasites are capable of modulating vascular reactivity by inducing changes in endothelial cell behavior. The mechanism may involve parasite-induced local inflammation or alterations in endothelial cell metabolism. Understanding how chronic experimental filarial infection alters vascular reactivity may enhance our understanding of the pathogenesis of human filariasis.\r"

Experiments were designed to examine the effect of hirudin (which inactivates thrombin) and the nitrovasodilators nitroglycerin and 3-morpholinosydnonimine on the spontaneous and thrombin-stimulated release of endothelin in intact blood vessels. Endothelin was detected by radioimmunoassay in the incubating medium of intact porcine aortas with endothelium. The spontaneous release of endothelin was not affected by hirudin (0.1 micrograms/ml) but that induced by thrombin (4 units/ml) was prevented. Nitroglycerin (10(-5) M) and the active metabolite of molsidomine, 3-morpholinosydnonimine (10(-5) M), did not modify the basal production of endothelin from the intima of intact porcine aortas. However, the nitrates fully inhibited the release of the peptide induced by thrombin (4 units/ml). The inhibitory effects of both 3-morpholinosydnonimine and nitroglycerin on the thrombin-stimulated release of endothelin were abolished in the presence of an inhibitor of soluble guanylate cyclase, methylene blue (10(-5) M). Thus, the thrombin-stimulated release of endothelin is inhibited by inactivation of thrombin with hirudin or by agents that mimic the effect of endothelium-derived nitric oxide. In contrast, the spontaneous production of endothelin is not modulated by the drugs.\r"

A table showing the degree of dilution which occurred during simulation of various breathing patterns while using the AFM-DF is also presented. Data revealed that when 60 percent was desired, 13 of 27 measurements were less than 55 percent. The worst-case scenario for 60 percent desired was 48 percent measured. When 80 percent was desired, less than 70 percent was delivered in 24 of the 27 breathing patterns simulated. Less than 60 percent was measured on 12 occasions, with 51 percent being the lowest measurement. When 100 percent O2 was desired, less than 80 percent was measured in 25 of 27 breathing patterns. Less than 60 percent was measured in ten of those. Fifty percent was the lowest analyzed value for the 100 percent setting. The inadequacy of AFM-DF is described in three case studies. A high-flow nonrebreathing face mask (HFM) to address the subset of patients is also discussed. A peak inspiratory flow prediction chart is also documented and may be useful in setting optimal flows when using high-flow systems. The patients in whom intubation and mechanical ventilation (or use of continuous mask CPAP) are indicated can be more clearly identified with a trial of high-flow O2 therapy (with a system that assures adequate flow to meet the patient's peak inspiratory flow demands). In the remainder of patients, those higher-risk modalities will be precluded.\r"

Long term oral administration of OPC induces goiter and thyroid tumor formation in rats, associated with decreases in serum T4 and increases in serum TSH concentrations. Studies were carried out to explore the mechanisms responsible for these drug induced abnormalities. OPC 8212, administered for 1 week at doses of 500 and 2000 mg/kg.day mixed with the diet, resulted in an increase in thyroid weight, a decrease in circulating T4 and free T4 concentrations and an increase in serum TSH concentrations. OPC decreased the 5'-deiodinase (5'-D) activity in liver homogenates and increased the 5'-D activity in pituitary homogenates, consistent with hypothyroidism. OPC 8212 did not affect thyroid iodine metabolism and hormone synthesis or the binding of T4 to serum binding proteins. The hepatic uptake of 125 I-T4 4 h after T4 administration was significantly increased in OPC 8212 treated rats. The biliary excretion of administered 125 I-T4 was increased in OPC 8212-treated rats and most of the increase was due to an increase in the excretion of T4-glucuronide. Hepatic T4-glucuronyltransferase activity measured in vitro in OPC 8212 treated rats was increased as compared to that of controls. It is concluded that the effect of OPC 8212 on lowering serum T4 with a compensatory rise in TSH leading to goiter formation is due to a drug-induced increase in hepatic T4 disposal. The induction of T4-glucuronyl-transferase appears to play an important role in the increased biliary excretion of T4 in OPC 8212-treated rats.\r"

  ".W": "In GH4C1 rat pituitary cells, a GTP-binding protein appears to be involved in signal transduction between the TRH receptor and phospholipase C. In certain other cell types, another role for GTP has been reported, namely regulation of Ca2+ translocation from one intracellular pool to another. Using digitonin-permeabilized GH4C1 cells, we have investigated whether an analogous process occurs in pituitary cells. In permeabilized GH4C1 cells, TRH, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3), and nonhydrolyzable GTP analogs guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (GTP gamma S) and 5'-guanylyl imidodiphosphate each increased free Ca2+ concentration [( Ca2+]). Unlike several other systems, GTP did not increase [Ca2+]. Guanosine 5'-O-(2-thiodiphosphate) inhibited Ca2+ release induced by both TRH and GTP gamma S. Heparin abolished IP3-induced Ca2+ release but did not prevent Ca2+ release induced by TRH or GTP gamma S, suggesting a mechanism for their actions that did not depend solely on IP3 production. Neomycin inhibited GTP gamma S-induced Ca2+ release, but it did not prevent TRH- or IP3-induced Ca2+ release. In the absence of ATP, GTP gamma S did not elevate [Ca2+], although TRH and IP3 did, suggesting that ATP-dependent sequestration of Ca2+ was necessary for the action of GTP gamma S in this system, but not for TRH and IP3. Repeated additions of IP3 resulted in an attenuation of the response to IP3- GTP gamma S, which itself increased [Ca2+] after IP3 attenuation, restored the attenuated Ca2+ response to IP3. We conclude that, in permeabilized GH4C1 cells, GTP gamma S as well as TRH cause intracellular Ca2+ release; however, their mechanisms of action are, at least in part, distinct. Furthermore, the IP3-depletable Ca2+ pool can be refilled from a GTP gamma S-sensitive compartment via Ca2+ transport through the cytosol.\r"

  ".W": "We have previously described FSH receptor-mediated influx of 45Ca++ in cultured Sertoli cells from immature rats and receptor-enriched proteoliposomes via activation of voltage-sensitive and voltage-independent calcium channels. We have further shown that this effect of FSH does not require cholera toxin- or pertussis toxin-sensitive guanine nucleotide binding protein or activation of adenylate cyclase. In the present study, we have identified regions of human FSH-beta-subunit which appear to be involved in mediating calcium influx. We screened 11 overlapping peptide amides representing the entire primary structure of hFSH-beta-subunit for their effects on 45Ca++ flux in FSH receptor-enriched proteoliposomes. hFSH-beta-(1-15) and hFSH-beta-(51-65) induced uptake of 45Ca++ in a concentration-related manner. This effect of hFSH-beta-(1-15) and hFSH-beta-(51-65) was also observed in liposomes lacking incorporated FSH receptor, suggesting that the peptide amides may act as ionophores or channel-formers. Reducing membrane fluidity by incubating liposomes (containing no receptor) with hFSH-beta-(1-15) or hFSH-beta-(51-65) at temperatures lower than the transition temperatures of their constituent phospholipids resulted in no significant (P greater than 0.05) difference in 45Ca++ uptake. The effectiveness of the calcium ionophore A23187, however, was abolished. Ruthenium red, a voltage-independent calcium channel antagonist, was able to completely block uptake of 45Ca++ induced by hFSH-beta-(1-15) and hFSH-beta-(51-65) whereas nifedipine, a calcium channel blocker specific for L-type voltage-sensitive calcium channels, was without effect. These results suggest that in addition to its effect on voltage-sensitive calcium channel activity, interaction of FSH with its receptor may induce formation of transmembrane aqueous channels which also facilitate influx of extracellular calcium.\r"

Primary cultures of anterior pituitary cells from rats were preincubated with [3H]arachidonate to label their phospholipid-containing components. The cells were then washed and incubated with vehicle or test agents, and PRL release into the medium and [3H]arachidonate cleaved from phospholipid were measured. TNF alpha significantly increased the release of both PRL and [3H] arachidonate release in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Other cytokines, such as interleukin-1 alpha, interleukin-1 beta, and gamma-interferon, had no effect on [3H]arachidonate release. To define the role of calcium in TNF alpha-induced arachidonate release, dispersed pituitary cells were incubated with low calcium medium, which decreased arachidonate release in response to TNF alpha. TNF alpha potentiated the release of [3H]arachidonate and PRL promoted by phospholipase-A2 and melittin, and markedly shifted the dose-response curve to the left. Inhibitors of phospholipase-A2, such as p-bromophenacyl bromide and quinacrine, had no effect on TNF alpha-induced [3H]arachidonate and PRL release. BW755C, an inhibitor of the conversion of arachidonate to its metabolites, decreased TNF alpha-induced PRL release, while indomethacin, a prostaglandin synthesis inhibitor, had no effect on TNF alpha-induced PRL release. These data indicate that arachidonate metabolites may be involved in the process of TNF alpha-induced PRL release.\r"

The hypothesis that Ca2+ is a second messenger was examined by spectrofluorometric measurement of cytosolic calcium ([Ca2+]i), of fura-2-loaded human dermal skin fibroblasts. PTH induced: 1) transient elevations of [Ca2+]i due to both Ca2+ influx and intracellular release which were independent of CAMP generation, and 2) membrane depolarization. PTH treatment of fibroblasts depolarized by KCl induced oscillations of [Ca2+]i, but spontaneous oscillatory activity was not observed. Transient elevations of [Ca2+]i similar to that induced by PTH were observed with PTH-related peptide (PTHrp). PTH regulation of [Ca2+]i was normal in fibroblasts from patients with pseudohypoparathyroidism (PHP) type Ia (deficiency of the stimulatory GTP-binding protein, Gs), but PTH induced transient decreases in [Ca2+]i in fibroblasts from patients with PHP type Ib (defective PTH receptor). Both PHP Ia and Ib fibroblasts exhibited: 1) spontaneous [Ca2+]i oscillations, possibly due to voltage gated Ca2+ entry and Ca2+ induced Ca2+ release; and 2) greater sensitivity than normal fibroblasts for release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores when [Ca2+]i was decreased by lowering external Ca2+. Conclusions: 1) PTH-induced transient elevations in [Ca2+]i in normal fibroblasts result from Ca2+ entry and intracellular release which are independent of CAMP generation; 2) [Ca2+]i homeostasis is altered in PHP fibroblasts, resulting in Ca2+ oscillations; 3) PTH regulation of [Ca2+]i is altered in PHP Ib, but not in PHP Ia fibroblasts.\r"

Granulosa cells cultured without hormonal treatment displayed low levels of binding sites for GRF and the related neuropeptide, vasoactive intestinal peptide. However, treatment with increasing concentrations (50-500 ng/ml) of FSH caused dose-dependent increases in cAMP production and expression of binding sites measured with radioiodinated [His1, Nle27]human GRF(1-32)NH2, with no change in binding affinity. The maximum increase in GRF binding sites (2.2-fold) was elicited by 250 ng/ml FSH after 72 h incubation. GRF binding sites were also increased by agents that elevate intracellular cAMP, including choleragen, vasoactive intestinal peptide, dibutyryl cAMP, and forskolin. Low doses of forskolin that did not alone increase [125I] [His1, Nle27] human GRF(1-32)NH2 binding potentiated the action of FSH on GRF binding sites, but the effects of maximal stimulatory doses of both agents were not additive. These findings demonstrate that FSH promotes the expression of GRF receptors in maturing granulosa cells through cAMP-dependent mechanisms. Since GRF enhances the actions of FSH on cAMP production and granulosa cell differentiation, and GRF receptors are increased by the cAMP-mediated actions of FSH, locally produced GRF could exert a positive autoregulatory action to accelerate follicular maturation by amplifying the granulosa cell response to FSH.\r"

  ".W": "We have investigated mechanisms of PTH-induced homologous desensitization reflected in the refractoriness of cAMP response to the second exposure to PTH in the clonal rat osteosarcoma cell line, UMR-106. Preincubation with 10(-7) M rat (r) PTH-(1-34) for 6 h caused the desensitization, resulting in a 65% decrease in cAMP accumulation in response to further exposure to rPTH. This desensitization was apparent at 10(-10) M rPTH and maximal at 10(-7) M rPTH. UMR-106 cells treated with protein kinase C (PK-C) activating phorbol ester, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA, 10(-6) M) for 6 h also induced desensitization manifested by a loss of rPTH-stimulated cAMP accumulation to 50% of that in the control cells. On the other hand, 4 alpha-phorbol 12,13-didecanoate, incapable of activating PK-C, failed to induce desensitization. Fifty micromolar H-7 (PK-C inhibitor) significantly blocked both rPTH- and PMA-induced desensitization. Thus, PK-C seemed to play a major role in rPTH-induced desensitization. Pretreatment with neither rPTH nor PMA changed the cAMP responsiveness to 10 micrograms/ml cholera toxin or 100 microM forskolin. Islet activating protein failed to influence the desensitization in this cell line. PTH receptor binding, assessed by using 125I-labeled [Nle8,Nle18,Tyr34]PTH-(1-34) as a radioligand, was decreased along with PTH receptor numbers by pretreatment with rPTH or PMA. These data indicate that rPTH-induced homologous desensitization occurs at least in part through the activation of PK-C and that PK-C directly affects PTH receptor in UMR-106 cells.\r"

Since endothelin has been found to increase ANP secretion from the heart, we examined a possible regulation by endothelin of the secretion and production of ANP in fetal diencephalic cultures of neurons from gestational day 16 rats. Endothelin produced a concentration-related increase in the secretion of ANP. The ability of endothelin to induce ANP secretion was dependent upon calcium, since added nifedipine, a calcium channel blocker, significantly reversed the effects of this vasoconstrictor peptide. ANP 103-126 was the predominant form secreted, as determined by HPLC followed by RIA. The production of this peptide, assessed by specific mRNA expression, was increased more than 2-fold, in dose-related fashion. These studies provide the first evidence that endothelin regulates ANP gene expression in the brain. Additionally, our secretion studies from neurons are consistent with the known stimulatory effects of endothelin on ANP release from the heart. The regulation of ANP production and secretion by the vasoconstrictor peptide endothelin is one level at which ANP and endothelin might interact in the in vivo brain.\r"

  ".W": "The mechanism and site(s) of the defect responsible for desensitization to hormone stimulation of adenylyl cyclase (AC) vary with cell type. Plasma membrane preparations were assayed after treatment of primary cultured dog thyroid cells to determine the role of the TSH receptor, stimulatory and inhibitory guanine nucleotide binding proteins (Gs and Gi), and catalytic unit in AC desensitization. Exposure of cells to TSH or the phorbol ester, 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA), caused time dependent decreases in TSH-stimulated AC and [125I]TSH binding with approximately 50% decreases seen after 18 h; Bt2cAMP was unable to reproduce the TSH effect. Whereas TSH treatment caused concomitant decreases (approximately 25%) in both cyclase activity and [125I]TSH binding after 2 h, TPA treatment decreased AC activity after 6 h and binding only after 18 h. The protein kinase C inhibitor, H-7, prevented TPA-induced but not TSH-induced effects on AC and hormone binding. Membrane AC activation by cholera toxin or forskolin was not altered by 18 h pretreatment of cells with TSH or TPA, indicating that these agents had no apparent effect on intrinsic functionality of either Gs or the catalytic unit. TSH or TPA pretreatment of cells reduced subsequent toxin-mediated AD[32P]-ribosylation of Gs and Gi in isolated membranes. However, the TSH- and TPA-induced decreases in AD[32P]-ribosylation and desensitization do not appear to be due to endogenous ribosylation of G proteins, since treatment of cells with pertussis toxin, for example, to endogenously ribosylate Gi, both increased TSH-stimulated AC activity and failed to affect the ability of TSH or TPA to desensitize. Thus, in this system, although specific hormone-induced AC desensitization and receptor down-regulation conform to several aspects of classic homologous processes, similar effects are also induced by a nonreceptor (phorbol ester) pathway; desensitization, however, can precede down-regulation, possibly due to receptor-Gs uncoupling.\r"

The possible role of TRH in mediating the difference in the thyroid status between these two lines was investigated. An increase in TRH gene expression in the paraventricular nucleus and TRH peptide levels in the hypothalamus between postnatal days 8-14 in both SS and LS mice coincided with increased circulating levels of thyroxine during this critical period of central nervous system development. No significant differences in TRH biosynthesis were observed between LS and SS mice during this time. Exogenous administration of TRH to LS and SS mice on day 8, when endogenous serum thyroxine levels were equivalent, resulted in a greater increase in serum thyroxine in SS mice (150%) than LS mice (51%). The differential response to the TRH stimulation test was also present on day 14 (SS, 43%; LS, 18%). The differential responsiveness of the pituitary-thyroid axis to exogenous TRH paralleled the differential increase in endogenous serum thyroxine observed between day 8 and 14 in these mice. Administration of TRH to day 20 and adult (60 days) LS and SS mice resulted in nearly equivalent (approximately 75%) increases in free thyroxine serum levels, yet the magnitude of thyroxine release was 50% greater in SS mice, due perhaps to between-line differences within the thyroid glands. It is unlikely that dissimilar endogenous levels of TRH account for the intrinsic difference in the thyroid status in LS and SS mice. Instead, the increased pituitary-thyroid responsiveness to TRH in SS mice during the second postnatal week may translate into increased functional capacity of the thyroid gland in adult SS relative to LS mice.\r"

To examine the role of cathepsin-B, -D, and -L, the three major endopeptidases in this process, we incubated rabbit [125I]Tg, labeled in vivo, with lysosomal extracts from human thyroids. Iodopeptide formation was evaluated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate after short term incubations (20-45 min), while iodoamino acid release was assessed by paper chromatography after long term incubations (8 and 24 h). Using pepstatin to inhibit cathepsin D, Z-Phe-Ala-CHN2 to inhibit both cathepsin B and L, and Z-Phe-Phe-CHN2 to selectively inhibit cathepsin L, we obtained the following results: 1) blocking of all three endopeptidases reduced both iodopeptide formation in short term experiments and iodoamino acid release in long term experiments by 80-90%; 2) iodopeptide formation was reduced by 85% with Z-Phe-Ala-CHN2, by 56% with Z-Phe-Phe-CHN2, and by 26% with pepstatin; 3) iodoamino acid release was reduced by 60-80% with Z-Phe-Ala-CHN2 and by 40-50% with either Z-Phe-Phe-CHN2 or pepstatin at 8 h, but by less than 20% at 24 h; pepstatin and Z-Phe-Phe-CHN2 together reduced iodoamino acid release by 80% and 60% at 8 and 24 h, respectively. Limited hydrolysis of Tg by lysosomal enzymes produced at least eight peptide fragments of less than 100,000 mol wt. Three of these, together representing 32% of the 125I released, resulted from cleavages in the C-terminal region of Tg corresponding to residues 2487, 2393, and 2390 of cDNA-derived human Tg. Several other peptides, together containing 38% of the 125I released, included the N-terminus of Tg. These C-terminal and N-terminal fragments contained three of Tg's four major hormonogenic sites, but none of the cleavage sites fell close to the hormone sites themselves. We conclude that 1) the formation of discrete iodopeptides precedes the release of iodothyronines and iodotyrosines from Tg; 2) the cysteine proteinases are more important than cathepsin D in this process; and 3) these endopeptidases selectively cleave Tg to favor the production of hormone-containing intermediates for subsequent processing by exopeptidases.\r"

  ".W": "The putative endogenous occupant(s) of the ovarian GnRH receptor may play a role as an intraovarian regulator. In this communication we explore the possibility that in vivo activation of the ovarian GnRH receptor may prove heteroregulatory to the murine granulosa type I insulin-like growth factor (IGF) receptor complement. To eliminate potentially confounding pituitary involvement, exclusive use was made of hypophysectomized rats, thereby allowing study of the direct ovarian effect(s) of GnRH receptor ligands. Treatment of immature hypophysectomized rats, thereby allowing study of the direct ovarian effect(s) of GnRH receptor ligands. Treatment of immature hypophysectomized diethylstilbestrol-primed rats with a GnRH agonist (25 micrograms/rat, twice daily) for 2.5 days resulted in a 2.1-fold decrease in FSH (10 micrograms/rat, twice daily)-inducible (but not basal) specific [125I]IGF-I binding to isolated granulosa cells. Scatchard analysis of the binding data revealed this effect to be due in large measure to decreased binding capacity (46% inhibition) rather than affinity (2.5 x 10(-9) M). Although in vivo treatment with a GnRH antagonist (25 micrograms/rat, twice daily) by itself proved without significant effect on the specific binding of IGF-I to isolated granulosa cells, the concurrent provision of a minimally effective dose of FSH (1 microgram/rat, twice daily) resulted in a 2.8-fold amplification of the FSH effect consequent to enhanced binding capacity (110%), but not affinity (2.2 x 10(-9) M). Significantly, this level of binding proved comparable to that induced by a maximally effective dose of FSH when used by itself. Combined pretreatment with identical doses of both peptide analogs had little or no effect on granulosa cell IGF-I binding, suggesting stereospecificity of action and mutual neutralization by the opposing actions of the GnRH receptor ligands employed. The ability of ligands of the GnRH receptor to alter the granulosa cell type I IGF receptor complement proved functionally significant, as assessed by corresponding alterations in IGF-I hormonal action. Indeed, pretreatment with a GnRH antagonist resulted in a 2.1-fold enhancement of IGF-I (50 ng/ml)-supported proteoglycan biosynthesis, with the agonistic analog producing a diametrically opposite effect. Moreover, the ovarian effects of GnRH receptor ligands were not limited to type I IGF receptor binding; comparable effects were noted on basal and hCG-stimulated accumulation of progesterone by cultured granulosa cells, ovarian weight, ovarian protein content, as well as size and number of antral follicles.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "We recently reported that aluminum administration to beagles stimulates uncoupled bone formation in the marrow cavity which increases trabecular bone volume and generates new osseous networks within the axial skeleton. To investigate whether this osteogenic process results from direct stimulation of bone cell replication, we examined the mitogenic effects of aluminum on undifferentiated osteoblasts derived from the MC3T3-E1 clonal cell line. Addition of AlCl3 (1-50 microM) to serum-free culture medium of quiescent osteoblasts resulted in a dose-dependent increase in [3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA and a concordant increase in cell number to 48% of the density achieved at the maximum replicative rate induced by fetal bovine serum (FBS). The time course of aluminum-induced mitogenesis was similar to that of FBS, with onset of DNA synthesis detectable by 12 h and progressive increases in replicative rates observed over a 48-h study period. Moreover, maximal stimulation of DNA synthesis by AlCl3 and that by FBS were not additive, whereas aluminum exerted additional effects on cell replication when combined with low FBS concentrations. Analysis of cell cycle kinetics indicated that aluminum, analogous to FBS, influences the osteoblast replicative activity by inducing transition from the G0 to the S phase of the cell cycle. In addition, exposure of cells to aluminum resulted in rapid accumulation of c-fos mRNA by 30 min, indicating that aluminum, like fetal bovine serum, induced expression of growth-regulating genes. Deferoxamine mesylate, a chelator of aluminum, blocked the replicative actions of aluminum in a dose-dependent fashion. In contrast, pertussis toxin, a specific inhibitor of certain G-proteins, had no effect on the mitogenic effects of aluminum, indicating that aluminum-induced mitogenesis occurs by a pertussis toxin-insensitive pathway. Though the particular cellular pathway remains to be defined, these data provide initial evidence that aluminum-induced neoosteogenesis may depend upon direct stimulation of osteoblast replication.\r"

  ".W": "The present study examined the relationship between the functional status of Sertoli cells and the maintenance and restoration of spermatogenesis in immature hypophysectomized (HPX) rats given various doses of exogenous testosterone with or without daily injections of FSH for 90 days. Subcutaneous implantation of a 2- to 10-cm testosterone capsule (TC) increased serum testosterone levels of HPX rats 2-10 times above the normal control levels, but did not significantly increase the testicular testosterone level. Daily injections of FSH significantly increased the accumulation of testosterone in testes of TC-implanted HPX rats. Maintenance of early spermiogenesis was observed in all TC-implanted animals. Although elongated spermatids were present, step 18-19 spermatids at the luminal edge of stages VII-VIII epithelium were only observed in rats bearing 10-cm TC implants. Daily injection of FSH resulted in the completion of spermiogenesis in all TC-implanted animals, and the number of step 18-19 spermatids was dependent on the length of TC implants used. These results demonstrate the importance of the synergism of FSH and testosterone in the final steps of spermiogenesis. The androgen-binding protein (ABP) content per testis of the HPX rats was stimulated by TC implants. However, a significant increase in epididymal ABP was only noted in rats bearing 10-cm TC implants. Injection of FSH resulted in a significant increase in the testicular ABP content in rats bearing 2- or 5-cm TC, but not in those with 10-cm TC implants. In addition, the epididymal ABP content was significantly stimulated by FSH in all TC-implanted animals. The ABP status in the testis and its transport toward the epididymis are closely related to the extent of maintenance of spermiogenesis. It is speculated that the production of ABP by Sertoli cells and the biochemical properties of ABP molecules may have some role in the control of the final steps of spermiogenesis.\r"

The present work explores the effects of a 72-h pretreatment of adrenal cells with both hormones on the first steps of the mechanism of action of ACTH and A-II and on the amounts of the alpha-subunits of guanine nucleotide binding proteins Gs and Gi. ACTH but not A-II increased acute ACTH or cholera toxin-induced cAMP production. Moreover, ACTH but not A-II enhanced the amount of alpha S protein evaluated by cholera toxin ADP ribosylation, whereas both hormones elevated immunoblotted alpha S. Both hormones increased A-II induced phosphoinositide breakdown and Ca2+ uptake without modification of the A-II potentiating effect on ACTH-induced cAMP production. Treatment of cells with pertussis toxin (PT, 0.5 micrograms/ml) for the last 24 h reduced by 27% the A-II induced phosphoinositide breakdown in A-II pretreated cells but had no significant effect in ACTH-pretreated cells. No effect of PT was observed on A-II induced Ca2+ uptake or on its potentiating action on ACTH-induced cAMP production in ACTH as well as A-II-pretreated cells. Moreover, both hormones increased Gi proteins (40-41 kDa) evaluated by PT ADP ribosylation. Immunoblot analysis revealed that ACTH preferentially enhanced alpha i3, whereas the stimulatory effect of A-II was more marked on alpha i1 and alpha i2. These results indicate that in bovine adrenal fasciculata cells, peptide hormones settle target cell responsiveness not only by regulating the membrane-bound receptors, but also by modulating the level of G proteins coupling these receptors to the intracellular signals.\r"

  ".W": "Hormone regulation of carbonic anhydrase II (CA II) was studied in rat dorsal and lateral prostate. CA II is a major soluble protein in these accessory sex glands. The immunoelectronmicroscopy showed that CA II is expressed in their epithelial cells only. For studies on hormone regulation, adult male rats were castrated for 2 or 7 days. Groups of 7-day castrates and normal rats were treated daily either with testosterone or 17-beta-estradiol for 6 days and 2-day castrates for 1 day. CA II protein was analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and quantified by RIA. The levels of CA II mRNA were studied by Northern blotting and hybridization of total RNA with a 32P-labeled mouse CA II cDNA clone. Castration of the rats decreased the concentration of CA II in lateral prostate but increased in dorsal prostate. These changes were reversed in both prostatic lobes by testosterone treatment. Estrogen treatment of castrated rats enhanced CA II concentration in lateral prostate but no effects were seen in the dorsal prostate of the same animals. In normal rats estrogen increased CA II concentration of dorsal prostate but there was no change in lateral prostate. Corresponding changes were observed in the levels of CA II mRNA in both tissues. The morphometric analyses showed that the castration- and hormone-induced changes of the mRNA and protein levels of the exclusively epithelial CA II could not be explained by any alterations in the proportions of epithelial and stromal components of the glands after hormone manipulations. The results demonstrate the differential steroid regulation of CAII in two prostatic lobes. Androgen regulates the expression of CAII at messenger RNA level, but the responses of CAII to testosterone are opposite in dorsal and lateral prostate. Estrogen increases CA II expression in lateral prostate but in dorsal prostate the castration-like effects of estrogen on CAII expression are probably indirect.\r"

DESIGN: Comparing ultrasound and estradiol (E2) measurements during treatment with a low-dose protocol (using purified follicle-stimulating hormone, starting with 75 IU/d and increasing every 7 days by 37.5 IU/d) with those obtained following treatment with a conventional protocol using the same drug. SETTING: Specialist Reproductive Endocrine Unit. PATIENTS PARTICIPANTS: Eight PCOS patients of whom six had failed to respond adequately to the conventional protocol. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Rate of cancellation of cycles, number of leading follicles, and serum E2 concentration at the time of ovulation. RESULTS: Treatment with the low-dose protocol resulted in a significant reduction in the number of leading follicles (P less than 0.04), serum E2 concentrations (P less than 0.0002), and a higher rate of ovulation. As a result, five patients conceived compared with none in the conventional protocol. CONCLUSION: Using the low-dose protocol permitted induction of ovulation safely and successfully in a selected group of PCOS patients who were previously difficult to treat with the conventional ovulation induction protocol.\r"

DESIGN: Comparative study of endocrinologic parameters in subjects with PCOD. SETTING: Open patient clinic of reproductive endocrinology at University Central Hospital of Turku, Finland. PATIENTS: Fourteen nonobese and 10 obese patients with PCOD. Seven healthy women for reference data collection. Normal thyroid function, serum prolactin concentration, normal diurnal cortisol variation, euglycemia in all subjects. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Serum concentrations of insulin, testosterone, androstenedione, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, sex hormone-binding globulin, immunoreactive luteinizing hormone (LH), bioactive LH, and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). RESULTS: The concentration of insulin was higher and that of bioactive LH was lower in obese than in nonobese PCOD women in whom the levels were also above the upper reference value. There was a negative correlation between insulin and bioactive LH levels (r = -0.57). Bioactive LH correlated inversely with the body mass index (BMI) (r = -0.50). After eliminating the effect of the BMI, the correlation between bioactive LH and insulin was no longer significant (r = -0.37). The bioactive LH and immunoreactive LH/FSH ratio correlated significantly (r = 0.68). CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate that hyperandrogenic women can be divided into two subgroups: those with insulin resistance, normal or minimally elevated LH, and markedly elevated insulin levels; and those with elevated LH levels, no insulin resistance, and normal insulin concentrations. Obesity is associated with the former, and high bioactive LH levels with the latter subgroup.\r"

DESIGN: The study is in two parts: a preliminary clinical trial of women and a follow-up study in laboratory primates. SETTING: Normal human volunteers were studied in an academic research environment; primates were in a conventional laboratory setting. PATIENTS, PARTICIPANTS: Human volunteers were selected on the basis of apparent normal health. The monkeys were believed to be of normal reproductive status. INTERVENTIONS: Gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists were administered at subtherapeutic doses. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: After observing ovarian hyperstimulation in two of five women receiving low doses of GnRH-a, a study was specifically designed to test the hypothesis that at low (subtherapeutic) doses of GnRH-a the \"flare-effect\" can be sustained without achieving down regulation. RESULTS: The data in women and monkeys suggest that a highly individualized response to low GnRH-a doses can be manifested as ovarian hyperstimulation. CONCLUSION: Four points of interpretation are offered: (1) that subtherapeutic doses of GnRH-a can cause ovarian hyperstimulation and related sequelae; (2) this may be a unique observation in that, typically, lower doses of medications have a lower incidence of negative side effects; (3) the findings suggest that GnRH-a prescribed in self-administration regimens may be more prone to such problems in noncompliant patients; and (4) the hyperstimulation response of the ovaries to low GnRH-a doses may indicate a new approach to controlled ovulation induction, although wide individualism was found.\r"

This study was performed to test the effect of a modified human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) regimen on the luteal phase during gonadotropin treatment. DESIGN: Fifteen women from a private practice setting volunteered to be studied during each of two nonconception, gonadotropin-stimulated cycles. After ovarian stimulation with human menopausal gonadotropins (hMG), hCG was administered either as a single dose of 10,000 IU (single dose) or in two divided doses of 5,000 IU given 1 week apart (split dose). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Early, midluteal, and late luteal estradiol (E2) and progesterone (P) levels and luteal phase lengths were measured, and their median values and intraquartile ranges (IQR) compared using nonparametric analysis. RESULTS: Early and midluteal E2 and P levels were similar regardless of which hCG regimen was administered. The median late luteal E2 level was 1,146.0 pg/mL (the IQR ranged from 633 to 1,650, IQR = 1,017) with the split-dose regimen and 240.0 pg/mL (the IQR ranged from 150 to 460, IQR = 310) with the single-dose regimen. The median late luteal P level was 108.0 ng/mL (the IQR ranged from 58.5 to 129, IQR = 70.5) with the split-dose regimen and 4.2 ng/mL (the IQR ranged from 1.9 to 11.7, IQR = 9.8) with the single-dose regimen. Median luteal phase lengths were 16 days (the IQR ranged from 15 to 17, IQR = 2) for the split-dose regimen and 11 days (the IQR ranged from 10 to 12, IQR = 2) for the single-dose regimen. CONCLUSION: In hMG-stimulated cycles, a second dose of hCG given during the midluteal phase significantly increases late luteal E2 and P levels and consistently lengthens the luteal phase.\r"

RESULTS: Progesterone levels Measured in the culture medium of granulosa cells decreased sixfold with culture time. Human luteinizing hormone (LH) increased P production only when basal P production was less than 1 microgram/mL. Granulosa cell P production in culture was negatively correlated with FF LH-human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) levels. Follicular fluid follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels were positively correlated with FF P and 17 beta-estradiol (E2) concentrations. Similar results were found between FF LH (hCG) and E2 levels, but there was no relationship between FF LH (hCG) and FF P values. CONCLUSION: The high dose of hCG administered during gonadotropin treatment could induce a decrease in the in vitro granulosa cell P production.\r"

DESIGN: Granulosa cells were retrieved from preovulatory follicles in patients undergoing in vitro fertilization. Cells were cultured for a period of 72 hours or 10 days. The ability of hCG, human FSH, and/or IGF-I to induce aromatase activity was assayed by the stereospecific release of tritium from [1B-3H]androstenedione. RESULTS: Short-term cultures (72 hours) demonstrated a marked rise in aromatase activity in response to human FSH and IGF-I, whereas a smaller response to hCG was observed. In contrast, 10-day cultures demonstrated responsiveness predominantly to hCG rather than human FSH for the induction of aromatase activity with no remarkable effect of IGF-I. CONCLUSION: Luteinized human granulosa cells undergo a transformation from an initial human FSH and IGF-I responsive state to an hCG responsive state in long-term cultures.\r"

Changes in hepatic lipase are responsible for some lipoprotein modifications observed during estrogen administration (i.e., increased HDL levels). The aim of this study was to compare the effects of alternative routes of administration of estrogen on hepatic lipase activity and lipoprotein metabolism. DESIGN, PATIENTS: The effects of oral and parenteral estradiol (E2) replacement therapy on post-heparin hepatic lipase were studied in the short-term (6 weeks) in postmenopausal women. INTERVENTIONS: Ten patients received 2 mg/d or oral micronized E2 and 10 patients 3 mg/d of percutaneous E2. RESULTS: Both treatments significantly increased plasma E2 levels. Hepatic lipase decreased (-33%) significantly (P less than 0.05), and the phospholipids and free cholesterol content of HDL and HDL3 increased significantly (P less than 0.05) during oral but not during parenteral treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The short-term pharmacological effect of E2 on hepatic lipase depends on the route of administration. The inhibition of this enzyme may reduce the removal of HDL-cholesterol by the liver. The expected vascular benefits of such a pharmacological increase in HDL are questionable.\r"

DESIGN: In a prospective, controlled, randomized study we compared a pure follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG) protocol (group A = control) (n = 93 cycles) to two protocols in which GnRH-a pretreatment plus pure FSH and/or hMG was used in in vitro fertilization candidates. In group B (n = 64) GnRH-a was initiated during the luteal phase and in group C (n = 35) during the follicular phase. RESULTS: We found (1) no differences in fertilization and implantation rates between the three protocols; (2) similar pregnancy rates per transfer when similar number of conceptus were transferred (A = 30%, B = 22%, C = 21%); (3) an increase of the number of oocytes obtained; and (4) a reduction in the cancellation rate with both GnRH-a protocols. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that there is no obvious superiority between the two GnRH-a protocols in the dosage schedule used and that the major advantage of GnRH-a over non-GnRH-a protocols is in decreasing the cancellation rate and increasing the number of oocytes and conceptus obtained. The follicular phase GnRH-a protocol required less hMG-pure FSH than the luteal phase GnRH-a protocol.\r"

M. pneumoniae throat cultures were obtained from 419 patients aged five years or older who were seen in one of four family practice offices with a complaint of sore throat. The overall prevalence of M. pneumoniae infection was 13%. It was characterized by more frequent hoarseness and less frequent complaint of postnasal drip when compared with other nonstreptococcal infections. Compared to patients with streptococcal pharyngitis, M. pneumoniae patients revealed a strikingly dissimilar clinical presentation. In particular, while pharyngitis is predictive of streptococcal infections, its presence did not predict M. pneumoniae infection. Recently developed rapid office-based tests for M. pneumoniae may allow timely diagnosis of this common and formerly elusive pathogen. Further study is required to validate the utility of such methods and to evaluate the efficacy of treatment.\r"

An oligosaccharide-enriched fraction (OEF) from these samples also inhibited the attachment of this EPEC. Inhibition by OEFs decreased as lactation continued because of a general reduction in oligosaccharide content. Localized adherence of six other EPEC was also inhibited by sIgA and OEF, whereas attachment of isolates with diffuse or aggregative adherence was not inhibited by these fractions. Experiments with purified oligosaccharide fractions revealed that EPEC attach to HEp-2 cells through a carbohydrate-mediated mechanism based on the preferential recognition of fucosylated residues in human milk.\r"

The mean interval between blood transfusion and onset of active anti-HCV seroconversion was approximately 3 months after the first elevation of serum alanine aminotransferase levels (18.1 vs. 6.4 weeks). There was no correlation between fluctuations in serum alanine aminotransferase levels and anti-HCV titers. Of 26 patients with type C posttransfusion hepatitis who were followed greater than 1 year, 20 (76.9%) continued to have abnormal serum alanine aminotransferase levels.

  ".W": "Because persistence of infections associated with prosthetic material despite the use of appropriate antibiotics is a major clinical problem, the antimicrobial susceptibility of bacteria responsible for a chronic subcutaneous tissue cage infection in rat was investigated ex vivo. Three to 6 weeks after the initiation of infection, suspensions of two strains of Staphylococcus aureus recovered from the foreign body surface and surrounding fluid were exposed to either oxacillin, vancomycin, fleroxacin, gentamicin, or rifampin. The MBCs of these bacteria were markedly elevated, in most cases 128 to greater than 256 times higher than the MBC of batch culture S. aureus in either logarithmic or stationary phase. Kinetic studies showed the bacteria did not grow when incubated for 2 h in Mueller-Hinton broth, possibly reflecting dormancy. Their killing was slow and incomplete by all antibiotics at greater than 8 times their MIC. These data provide direct evidence of a decreased susceptibility of S. aureus to the killing effect of antimicrobials during chronic foreign body infections in vivo.\r"

Cost reimbursement was based on diagnosis related group payments. Aneurysm repairs were classified as emergent, high-risk elective, or low-risk elective. A net loss of $409,459 was noted for the entire series. Emergent repairs, although only 12% of the population, accounted for 73% of total losses, with a mean loss of $24,655/patient. The mean net loss in the high-risk elective group was $3590/patient, and a net gain of $1132/patient was noted in the low-risk elective group. Length of stay outliers, defined as length of stay greater than 28 days, contributed to the bulk of the losses in the elective series and were predominant in the high-risk group. No preoperative comorbidity, other than high-risk classification, predicted outlier status. Length of stay correlated with total standard costs in all categories of aneurysm repair. Third party payment for length of stay outliers was inadequate; the diagnosis related group system warrants revision so that outlier reimbursement will be based on a tiered system derived from length of stay.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to determine if intraarterial vasodilating drugs could augment the vasodilation produced by sympathetic blockade, such as occurs during epidural anesthesia. Papaverine (2 mg/min), nitroglycerin (1 microgram/kg/min), aand saline were infused into the femoral artery before and after lumbar sympathectomy in six arterially isolated canine hindlimbs. Femoral blood flow was controlled with a perfusion circuit at baseline (80 ml/min), half-baseline (40 ml/min), and low (5 ml/min) flow rates so that hindlimb mean arterial pressure served as an index of peripheral vasodilation. At low flow, hindlimb arteriovenous oxygen content difference increased from 1.4 (baseline) to 6.2 ml O2/dl, consistent with peripheral ischemia. At baseline flow before sympathectomy, papaverine and nitroglycerin caused a decrease in hindlimb mean arterial pressure of 30% and 18%, respectively (p less than 0.01 vs saline control), equivalent to the decreases of 31% and 16% after sympathectomy (p less than 0.01). At half-baseline, papaverine and nitroglycerin reduced hindlimb mean arterial pressure by 22% and 12%, respectively (p less than 0.01), and caused comparable vasodilation after sympathectomy. Neither drug significantly changed hindlimb mean arterial pressure at low flow. Sympathectomy itself reduced hindlimb mean arterial pressure by 23% at baseline flow (p less than 0.01), by 18% at half-baseline flow (p less than 0.01), but had no effect at low flow. We conclude that intraarterial papaverine and nitroglycerin cause peripheral vasodilation that is synergistic with sympathectomy-induced adrenergic blockade, but they cannot augment vasodilation caused by peripheral ischemia.\r"

  ".W": "We previously reported the use of an inexpensive screening model for lung preservation involving ventilation and perfusion of excised rabbit lungs after their preservation. We now have extended this model by perfusing the preserved lung in cross circulation with an anesthetized rabbit to permit stable reperfusion of the preserved lungs for 60 minutes. With this model we compared the results of lung preservation with the lungs inflated with nitrogen, room air, or 100% oxygen during 24 hours of hypothermic storage. Four groups of animals were studied: group 1, excision and immediate evaluation; group 2, inflation with room air and storage for 24 hours at 10 degrees C; group 3, same as group 2, with 100% oxygen for inflation during storage; group 4, same as group 2, with 100% nitrogen for inflation during storage. Assessment of the ex vivo perfused lung consisted of (1) blood gas analysis of inflow and outflow blood at 10-minute intervals; (2) continuous pulmonary artery and airway pressure monitoring; (3) measurement of pulmonary venous oxygen tension after 1 hour of reperfusion, with inflow oxygen tension adjusted to 15 mm Hg; (4) wet/dry weight ratio. We conclude that the paracorporeal circuit does not, in itself, cause lung injury over a 1-hour period; lungs preserved with nitrogen inflation rapidly became edematous and failed to function on reperfusion. Preservation with 100% oxygen inflation appears superior to inflation with room air.\r"

  ".U": "91245822\r", 
  ".W": "The use of aprotinin to reduce blood loss after cardiopulmonary bypass is under debate. Concern has been raised about the renal effects of aprotinin. We administered a mean aprotinin dose of 4.2 x 10(6) kallikrein-inhibiting units to 13 patients with coronary disease undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass for 74 +/- 5 minutes (mean +/- standard error of the mean); 13 comparable patients having cardiopulmonary bypass served as control subjects, and all were studied postoperatively for 24 hours. Aprotinin reduced postoperative blood loss by 50% (p = 0.0082). Two of the 13 patients who received aprotinin needed one red cell unit each versus a total of 18 units in eight of 13 control patients (p = 0.0096). Blood pressure, hemoglobin value and serum protein concentration were higher after operation in the aprotinin group (p less than 0.05 to p less than 0.01). Platelet counts did not differ, but plasma thromboxane was lower in aprotinin recipients (p less than 0.001). In control patients fibrinogen degradation products (D dimer) doubled, and alpha 2-antiplasmin activity was halved during and after cardiopulmonary bypass (p less than 0.01 to p less than 0.001), whereas aprotinin patients showed no changes. The complement breakdown products C4a, C3a, and C3dg as well as C9 neoantigen increased from prebypass baseline in both groups (p less than 0.001); the increment of C3a and C3dg was greater in the aprotinin than in the control patients (p less than 0.001). Serum electrolytes, osmolality, and creatinine remained normal in both groups of patients. Creatinine clearance was normal or above normal and virtually identical in both groups. Osmolar clearance and fractional sodium excretion were higher in the aprotinin group than in the control group shortly after cardiopulmonary bypass (p less than 0.05 to p less than 0.01); renal function was unremarkable the next morning. No adverse clinical effects attributable to aprotinin were seen. In summary, aprotinin offers advantages for cardiopulmonary bypass.\r"

  ".U": "91245825\r", 
  ".W": "In a porcine model of cardiac arrest, we investigated end-tidal carbon dioxide tension as a monitor of native blood flow during resuscitation by extracorporeal circulation. After 15 minutes of cardiac arrest and after precordial compression and transthoracic countershocks had failed, extracorporeal circulation consistently restored spontaneous circulation. Native end-tidal carbon dioxide tension, which averaged 29.8 +/- 1.0 mm Hg before arrest, was only 5.2 +/- 0.8 mm Hg during precordial compression. After the start of extracorporeal circulation, native end-tidal carbon dioxide tension was measured during 15-second interruptions of pump flow. End-tidal carbon dioxide tension progressively increased with a corresponding increase in native cardiac index. The correlation coefficients between end-tidal carbon dioxide tension and native cardiac index averaged 0.92 +/- 0.03 (mean +/- standard error of the mean). When end-tidal carbon dioxide tension exceeded 15 mm Hg, mean aortic pressure in each instance was 60 mm Hg or greater, and the animal was successfully weaned from extracorporeal support. We conclude that end-tidal carbon dioxide tension serves as a reliable monitor of blood flow through the lung and therefore of native cardiac output during weaning from extracorporeal circulation. It therefore indicates when native cardiac output is likely to be adequate to sustain spontaneous circulation.\r"

  ".W": "In an era of decreasing availability of funds and increasing demand, the AIDS epidemic threatens to overwhelm health-care services in some countries. We describe a comprehensive model for the treatment of AIDS in San Juan, Puerto Rico, and compare it with traditional hospital-based services. Given the existing allocation of funds, the comprehensive model emphasised prevention, education, surveillance, early detection, and outpatient care to reduce hospital care. In 1987, the last year of the traditional system, there were 95 admissions of AIDS patients to hospital, and in 1988, the first year of the comprehensive model, there were 100 admissions. The mean length of stay of AIDS inpatients was reduced from 22.3 days in 1987 to 11.3 days in 1988, a 46.8% reduction (p = 0.001). The annual mean (SE) cost of inpatient care per AIDS patient fell from $15,118 (1699) in 1987 to $3869 (659) in 1988. Savings were used to improve non-hospital services, including outreach, education, emergency and outpatient care, laboratory and epidemiological services, and research, and to introduce an employee incentive scheme. Management strategies that reduce the length of inpatient care and provide less costly treatment alternatives can improve AIDS health care in developing nations.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND AND METHODS. Several conjugate vaccines against Haemophilus influenzae type b have been developed in the search for one that induces protection even in young infants. We evaluated the safety and efficacy of a conjugate vaccine that links the H. influenzae type b capsular polysaccharide to the outer-membrane protein complex (OMPC) of Neisseria meningitidis serogroup B. We conducted a double-blind, placebo, controlled trial in Navajo infants, who are at high risk for systemic infections caused by H. influenzae type b. The infants were randomly assigned to receive the first dose of vaccine or placebo at 42 to 90 days of age and the second at 70 to 146 days of age. RESULTS. Of the infants in the trial, 2588 were assigned to receive the vaccine and 2602 to receive placebo. The mean follow-up was 269 days in the vaccine group and 267 days in the placebo group. Before the age of 18 months, there was 1 systemic H. influenzae type b infection in the vaccine group, as compared with 22 in the placebo group (P less than 0.001; point estimate of efficacy, 95 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, 72 to 99 percent). Of the 22 H. influenzae type b infections in the placebo group, 13 were meningitis. Among the children who received both doses, there was 1 H. influenzae type b infection in the vaccine group (n = 2056) and 14 in the placebo group (n = 2105) (P less than 0.001; point estimate of efficacy, 93 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, 53 to 98 percent). The single infection in the vaccine group occurred at 15 1/2 months of age in an infant with osteomyelitis. Between the first and second doses there were no H. influenzae type b infections in the vaccine group and eight in the placebo group (P less than 0.005; point estimate of efficacy, 100 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, 41 to 100 percent). CONCLUSIONS. The H. influenzae type b OMPC vaccine, administered at 2 and 4 months of age, is safe and induces a high rate of protection against invasive disease caused by H. influenzae type b in infants under the age of 18 months. Protection begins after the first dose.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. The period of neutropenia after autologous bone marrow transplantation results in substantial morbidity and mortality. The results of previous phase I-II clinical trials suggest that recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (rhGM-CSF) may accelerate neutrophil recovery and thereby reduce complications in patients after autologous bone marrow transplantation. METHODS. We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial at three institutions. The study design and treatment schedules were identical, and the results were pooled for analysis. One hundred twenty-eight patients were enrolled. Sixty-five patients received rhGM-CSF in a two-hour intravenous infusion daily for 21 days, starting within four hours of the marrow infusion, and 63 patients received placebo. RESULTS. No toxic effects specifically ascribed to rhGM-CSF were observed. The patients given rhGM-CSF had a recovery of the neutrophil count to 500 x 10(6) per liter 7 days earlier than the patients who received placebo (19 vs. 26 days, P less than 0.001), had fewer infections, required 3 fewer days of antibiotic administration (24 vs. 27 days, P = 0.009), and required 6 fewer days of initial hospitalization (median, 27 vs. 33 days; P = 0.01). There was no difference in the survival rate at day 100. CONCLUSIONS. In patients undergoing autologous bone marrow transplantation for lymphoid neoplasia, rhGM-CSF significantly lessens morbidity. Further studies will be required to establish its optimal dosage and schedule of administration.\r"

Nontraumatic, normal pressure CSF fistulas with resultant rhinorrhea, in which no cause can be identified, or primary spontaneous CSF rhinorrhea, is considerably rarer. Presented here are two cases of CSF rhinorrhea of this nature, including the diagnostic workup and treatment. Reviews of literature support laboratory quantitative glucose determination as the most effective and least morbid method for confirming the presence of CSF. Iodine-contrast (metrizamide/lohexol) computerized tomographic cisternography has been shown to be the most effective and least morbid method for localizing the fistula. For inactive, intermittent, small, or questionable CSF leaks, radionuclide cisternography has been shown to be more effective in identifying the presence of these leaks, although not necessarily the location. Numerous reports provide evidence to support the use of an extracranial rhinologic approach for surgical repair of the leak, as a more successful yet less morbid procedure than a craniotomy when used appropriately.\r"

FNA yielded a definitive diagnosis of metastatic ACC in all cases. In six of the nine patients, the pulmonary metastases were asymptomatic. Lung lesions were discovered up to 19 years after primary tumor presentation, and in two, pulmonary spread was the only evidence of recurrent disease. On the basis of the FNA diagnosis, these two patients were treated surgically for their isolated pulmonary metastases, and are disease free at 107 and 139 months. Six of the nine patients received radiation or chemotherapy; one initially refused treatment. Thoracotomy was avoided in these patients on the basis of the FNA diagnosis. All are alive with disease at 25 to 246 months. The metastatic tumors were indistinguishable cytologically from two primary pulmonary ACCs that were available for comparison. Our experience suggests FNA is a useful tool in the diagnosis of ACC in pulmonary material--one which obviates the need for thoracotomy with its associated morbidity.\r"

Between 1978 and 1989, we treated 11 unselected patients surgically for pharyngoesophageal diverticula. Endoscopic diverticulotomy was used in 11 patients and an external approach was used in the others. The endoscopically treated patients had no serious complications, resumed oral intake early, and were discharged from the hospital earlier. Our review of the surgical literature confirmed our experience with the efficacy and safety of the procedure. We therefore recommend endoscopic diverticulotomy as being equal to external approaches with regard to effectiveness; and it affords the patient a shortened hospital stay and more rapid return to to the premorbid state.\r"

  ".W": "There are a variety of methods for treating unilateral vocal cord paralysis, but to date there are few objective studies that evaluate the functional results of nerve transfer from the ansa cervicalis. Six dogs underwent unilateral recurrent laryngeal nerve section with immediate reanastamosis to the sternothyroid branch of the ansa cervicalis. After 5 to 6 months, measurements of vocal efficiency and acoustic parameters, videolaryngoscopy, videostroboscopy, and evoked electromyography were performed. Identical measurements were made in eight control dogs during normal electrically induced phonation and a simulated unilateral recurrent laryngeal nerve paralysis. Histologic analysis of both vocalis muscles, recurrent laryngeal nerves, ansa cervicalis, and the ansa-recurrent laryngeal nerve anastamosis site was performed. Evidence of reinnervation was found in all of the animals that underwent nerve transfer. The vocal efficiency and acoustic quality after ansa cervicalis nerve transfer were dependent on the degree of electrical stimulation from the transferred nerve to the reinnervated cord during phonation. In the absence of electrical stimulation to the nerve transfer, physiologic vocal cord motion could not be elicited from the reinnervated cord.\r"

Patients with sinus disease had significantly more frequent findings of disease in the osteomeatal complex and all sinuses. Concha bullosa was more common in patients with sinus disease (p less than 0.05), as was septal deviation (p less than 0.01). Paradoxical turbinate was equally common. Concha bullosa was associated with anterior ethmoid disease (p less than 0.04). Septal deviation was associated with osteomeatal complex disease (p less than 0.01) and with anterior (p less than 0.04) and posterior (p less than 0.04) ethmoid disease. Paradoxical turbinate was not associated with sinus abnormalities. These data imply a possible causal relationship between concha bullosa or septal deviation and sinus disease.\r"

Following a transient reduction immediately after the intravenous injection of each drug, the oxygen tension increased to reach a peak 5 to 10 minutes later, and then decreased gradually. The magnitude and duration of the PO2 increases were larger after the administration of glycerol than after that of mannitol. These results corresponded well with the clinical experience that glycerol was more effective than mannitol in improving hearing in Meniere's disease. The increase of PO2 in the cochlea, therefore, is considered to be one of the possible contributory factors for the improvement of hearing in patients with Meniere's disease after glycerol administration.\r"

The validity of the monothermal caloric test must be well established before it can be routinely used in clinical situations. The purpose of this investigation was to re-evaluate the monothermal caloric test by examining the correlations between unilateral weakness derived from bithermal caloric stimulation compared to monothermal caloric results using either warm or cool stimulation alone. A retrospective analysis of 200 patients indicated significant correlations between bithermal and monothermal unilateral weakness for patients with unilateral weakness of less than 15% and greater than 30% for both warm and cool water stimulation. For patients with 15% to 30% unilateral weakness, the bithermal and monothermal calorics were significantly correlated for only the cool condition. When predicting normal or greater than 20% unilateral weakness, either of the monothermal calorics have greater than 85% efficiency, with specificity greater than 94% and sensitivity greater than 64%. However, the false-negative rate is 29% for warm and 36% for cool calorics. The high rate of false-negative findings indicates that screening tests have no place in a diagnostic battery, especially in view of the implications for missing significant pathology.\r"

I have personally used skin grafting in almost every case of repair of acute injury or chronic stenosis of the larynx in the last several years. The rationale for grafting is (1) to cover any areas of epithelial loss or dehiscence during the healing period, (2) to reduce the chance of prolonged granulation and subsequent contracture, and (3) to serve as a logical material to use as the interface between a stent and the lumen of the larynx. This report discusses the use of skin grafting in 20 cases of severe acute injury or chronic stenosis. Other procedures needed to enhance the stenotic lumen are also described. In this series, 17 patients are decannulated, one wears a plug continually, and two did not or could not complete the recommended therapy. Among those completing therapy, 100% are either decannulated or wear a plug.\r"

A series of 41 consecutive children under 3 years of age, who underwent inpatient adenotonsillectomy, were reviewed for changes in weight and height. Thirty-seven patients had adequate long-term follow-up. Of these, many had dramatic improvements in growth after adenotonsillectomy. Indications for surgery in this group were recurrent infection in three patients (7%), unilateral tonsillar mass in one patient (3%), and upper airway obstruction in 37 patients (90%). A clear history of sleep apnea was elicited in 59%. At the time of surgery, 19 of 41 patients (46%) were of the fifth percentile or lower for age-corrected weight. The inpatient hospital stay averaged 3.2 days. The postoperative complication rate was 27%, with postoperative stridor as the most common complication. After surgery, 28 children (75%) showed a change to a higher percentile for weight. Twenty-four (65%) had percentile changes of 15% or more. This change is significant according to results of the Wilcoxon signed-rank test (p less than 0.001). We conclude that a relationship exists between improved growth rate and adenotonsillectomy in our study group. The rapid improvement in growth appears to be most obvious in children with upper airway obstruction resulting from adenotonsillar hypertrophy. Upper airway obstruction (including andenotonsillar hypertrophy) should be suspected as a possible cause in the workup of children with suboptimum growth.\r"

To test this hypothesis, matched sets of perilymph, serum, and CSF were obtained from 18 guinea pigs and seven human subjects. The purity of each sample was assured by measurement of the protein concentration of each sample and comparison of this parameter to known normal values for perilymph, serum, and CSF. Each sample was then subjected to two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, separating proteins by isoelectric point in the horizontal dimension and by relative molecular weight in the vertical dimension. All gels were processed under precisely identical physical conditions by use of a diamine silver stain. A small number of perilymph proteins not found in plasma were identified in both the guinea pig and the human specimens. The finding of unique perilymph proteins may permit the development of a sensitive marker that will aid in the diagnosis of perilymph fistula.\r"

  ".W": "Ceftazidime was used as the only intravenous agent for treating lower respiratory tract infections in patients with cystic fibrosis. The risks of inducing beta lactamases and conferring antibiotic resistance are high when monotherapy is used; so the emergence of resistant bacteria was studied prospectively in the sputum of 120 patients. The mean age of patients was 9.0 (range 0.3-25) years and there were equal number of male and female patients. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the only ceftazidime resistant bacterium to be isolated from the respiratory tract, and was identified only in chronically colonised patients. Ceftazidime resistance occurred in 103 (14%) of 750 P aeruginosa isolates, and in 16 of 36 chronically colonised patients. Ceftazidime resistant organisms were isolated from the faeces of 17 of 64 patients investigated. Eighty two per cent of the resistant faecal organisms were single isolates: the same resistant organism in faeces was isolated from successive samples in only two patients. In no case was the ceftazidime resistant enteric isolate the same as that from sputum. Patients chronically colonised by P aeruginosa did not harbour ceftazidime resistant enteric organisms any more than non-colonised patients. The use of ceftazidime as a single intravenous agent in treating chest exacerbations in cystic fibrosis does not induce a reservoir of ceftazidime resistant bacteria.\r"

  ".W": "Approximately 60 million people in the United States have hypertension (BP greater than or equal to 140/90 mm Hg), 40 million have arthritis clinically suitable for nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) therapy, and millions take NSAIDs for nonarthritic conditions, creating considerable potential for concomitant administration of NSAIDs and antihypertensive agents. It is estimated that more than 20 million people are on concurrent therapy. Most NSAIDs produce mild elevations of normal blood pressure levels and can partially or completely antagonize the effects of many antihypertensive drugs. The effect on blood pressure can vary from no effect to hypertensive crisis. In pooled studies, the average increase in mean arterial pressure was 10 mm Hg, and duration was short-lived or chronic. Significant interactions occur in about 1% of patients per year. The risk is greatest in the elderly, blacks, and patients with low-renin hypertension. NSAIDs may block the antihypertensive effects of thiazide and loop diuretics, beta-adrenergic blockers, alpha-adrenergic blockers, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. No interactions have been reported with centrally acting alpha agonists or the calcium channel blockers. The mechanism of the hypertensive effects of NSAIDs seem primarily related to their ability to block the cyclo-oxygenase pathway of arachidonic acid metabolism, with a resultant decrease in prostaglandin formation. The prostaglandins are important in normal modulation of renal and systemic vascular dilatation, glomerular filtration, tubular secretion of salt and water, adrenergic neurotransmission, and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Blockade of salutary effects of prostaglandins by NSAIDs results in a complex series of events culminating in attenuation of the effects of many antihypertensive agents. High-risk patients treated with NSAIDs should be identified and have blood pressure, renal function, and serum potassium frequently monitored.\r"

  ".W": "Cicletanine (CIC), a furopyridine derivative, lowers blood pressure in hypertensive animals and humans. We have previously identified an NaCl-sensitive substrain of spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR-S) that displays enhanced sensitivity to the depressor effects of exogenous atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) when fed a high NaCl diet. The current study tested the hypotheses that CIC has an exaggerated antihypertensive effect in NaCl-supplemented SHR-S and that this effect might be ANP dependent. CIC (40 mg/kg/day) or vehicle was administered by gavage in a single daily dose for three weeks beginning immediately prior to initiation of 1% or 8% NaCl diets in seven-week-old male SHR-S. CIC significantly decreased mean arterial pressure (MAP) and the ratio of left ventricular and septum weight to body weight (LV + S/BW) in both 8% NaCl- and 1% NaCl-fed SHR-S. The depressor effect of CIC was greater in the 8% NaCl group (-26 mmHg) than in the 1% NaCl group (-13 mmHg). CIC was associated with significant reduction in RAP in the 8% NaCl group but not in the 1% NaCl group. Neither CIC treatment nor 8% NaCl significantly altered plasma ANP or cyclic guanosine monophosphate (GMP) levels in plasma, aorta, or kidney. CIC was associated with significant decreases in plasma norepinephrine (NE) levels in the 1% NaCl group but not in the 8% NaCl group. The data demonstrate that the antihypertensive effect of CIC is exaggerated in NaCl-sensitive hypertension. The antihypertensive effect of CIC appears not to be related to ANP or cyclic GMP but may be related to a combination of a sympatholytic and natriuretic/diuretic effects in SHR-S.\r"

RESULTS: Twenty-two patients (8%) had a reactive rapid plasma reagin. Of these, 16 (6%) also had a reactive FTA-ABS and were determined to have syphilis. The cost for screening was $104.90 for each patient with syphilis. Using Poisson regression to control for changing rates over time and for prior differences in rates of syphilis detection in the three hospitals involved in the study, it was determined that our intervention led to 2.4-fold as many cases identified as would have been expected considering prior rates and the increasing incidence of syphilis. CONCLUSION: Syphilis screening of this high-risk population in the ED is warranted.\r"

In the no-ultrasound group, SPA was attempted without ultrasound. All unsuccessful SPAs were followed by catheterization and measurement of urine volume. SETTING: Children's hospital-based pediatric emergency department. PARTICIPANTS: Children less than 2 years old who required SPA. INTERVENTIONS: Ultrasound versus no ultrasound. RESULTS: Thirty-five patients were randomized to the ultrasound group, and 31 were randomized to the no-ultrasound group. SPA was successful in 79% of attempts in the ultrasound group compared with 52% in the no-ultrasound group (P = .04). The sensitivity and specificity of ultrasound were 90% and 86%, respectively.

The groups were studied for demographic similarities and for differences in morbidity, mortality, and ease of feeding. Comparison showed that PEGs had a lower mortality (0%) and morbidity (10%) than did OGTs where mortality was 4 per cent and morbidity was 22 per cent. PEGs began feeding sooner (1.0 day vs. 2.8 days) than OGTs. In addition, almost 60 per cent of the PEG patients underwent complete upper endoscopy at the time of the PEG, which revealed pathology that either altered the type of tube placed or the eventual medical management. PEG offers a less morbid, safer, and easier to use method of gastrostomy tube placement than OGT in the majority of elderly patients.\r"

[2-3H]adenine incorporation (indirect evidence of DNA gyrase activity) in EDTA-permeabilized cells was less affected by pefloxacin in PT2 and PT2-r (50% inhibitory concentration, 0.27 and 0.26 microgram/ml, respectively) than it was in S and PT1 (50% inhibitory concentration, 0.04 and 0.05 microgram/ml, respectively). Reduced [14C]pefloxacin labeling of intact cells in strains PT1 and PT2 correlated with more susceptibility to EDTA and the presence of more calcium (P less than 0.05) and phosphorus in the outer membrane fractions. Outer membrane protein analysis showed reduced expression of protein D2 (47 kDa) in strains PT1 and PT2. Other proteins were apparently similar in all strains. The addition of calcium chloride (2 mM) to the sodium dodecyl sulfate-solubilized samples of outer membrane proteins, before heating and Western blotting, probed with monoclonal antibody anti-OmpF showed electrophoretic mobility changes of OmpF in strains PT1 and PT2 which were not seen in strain S. Calcium-induced changes were reversed with ethyleneglycoltetraacetate. Decreased [14C]pefloxacin labeling was further correlated with an altered lipopolysaccharide pattern and increased 3-deoxy-D-mannooctulosonic acid concentration (P less than 0.01). These findings suggested that resistance to pefloxacin is associated with altered DNA gyrase in strain PT2-r, with altered permeability in PT1, and with both mechanisms in PT2.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

P. aeruginosa PAO1 showed higher susceptibility to carbapenems in minimal medium than it did in rich media such as Mueller-Hinton II agar. The susceptibility was decreased by the addition of a basic amino acid to the minimal medium, whereas it was influenced less by other amino acids. The susceptibility of PAO1 to cephalosporins, piperacillin, quinolones, and gentamicin was not influenced by the addition of a basic amino acid to the minimal medium. A significant change in susceptibility to carbapenems by the addition of a basic amino acid was not observed with D2 protein-deficient mutants of PAO1. Clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa also showed an increase in susceptibility in minimal medium. L-Lysine in minimal medium did not have any influence on the production of D2 protein, beta-lactamases, or penicillin-binding proteins of PAO1 or on the chemical degradation of CS-533. These results strongly indicate that the increase in susceptibility of P. aeruginosa to carbapenems relates to less competition with basic amino acids for permeation through the D2 protein channel of P. aeruginosa.\r"

For staphylococci, MICs were 0.13 to 1 microgram/ml and the MICs for 90% of the strains tested (MIC90s) were 0.13 to 0.5 microgram/ml; there were no differences between oxacillin-susceptible and -resistant strains. For streptococci, MICs were 0.03 to 4 micrograms/ml and MIC90s were 0.25 to 2 micrograms/ml; viridans group streptococci were the least susceptible streptococci. For enterococci, MICs were 0.25 to 32 micrograms/ml and MIC90s were 2 to 4 micrograms/ml; Enterococcus faecalis was the least susceptible. Vancomycin was the only comparative drug with consistent activity against all species of gram-positive cocci. With RP 59500, raising the inoculum 100-fold, lowering the pH of cation-adjusted Mueller-Hinton broth to 5.5, or omitting cation supplementation had little effect on MICs, but 50% serum increased MICs 2 to 4 dilution steps. The differences between MBCs and MICs were greater for staphylococci and enterococci than for streptococci. Time-kill studies with 24 strains indicated that RP 59500 concentrations 2-, 4-, and 16-fold greater than the MICs usually killed bacteria of each species at similar rates; reductions in CFU per milliliter were less than those observed with oxacillin or vancomycin against staphylococci and less than those observed with ampicillin against enterococci. RP 59500 antagonized the bactericidal activities of oxacillin and gentamicin against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213 and that of ampicillin against E. faecalis ATCC 29212.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the ability of dimethylthiourea, a low molecular weight free radical scavenger, to prolong this interval. An in vivo canine transplantation model was used to assess lung function. At harvest and after circulatory arrest, the donor lung was flushed with modified Euro-Collins solution (50 mL/kg). In a blinded fashion, dimethylthiourea (5 g) or saline solution was added to the flush solution at harvest and also infused (20 g over 2 hours) at reimplantation. Harvested lungs were stored for 12 hours at 4 degrees C. Allotransplantation was performed in recipient dogs ventilated with 40% O2. After 1 hour, the contralateral pulmonary artery was ligated, forcing the dog to be dependent on the transplanted lung. Twelve dogs were studied, with 6 randomly assigned to each treatment group in a blinded fashion. Measurements were recorded for 8 hours, keeping the inspired oxygen fraction constant at 0.40. All dimethylthiourea-treated dogs survived the observation period, whereas one third of the dogs that received saline solution died. Dimethylthiourea-treated dogs had significantly greater arterial oxygen tension and significantly less pulmonary vascular resistance compared with control animals. These results suggest that treatment of the lung with a free radical scavenger (dimethylthiourea) improves pulmonary function after reimplantation in a canine model after 12-hour hypothermic storage.\r"

The prophylactic value of flecainide administered as a constant-rate, intravenous infusion (0.15 mg.kg-1.h-1) after a loading dose (2 mg.kg-1) was compared with digoxin (10 micrograms.kg-1 for 12 hours, then 0.25 mg.24 h-1) in a randomized study in 30 patients using Holter monitoring during the first 72 hours after operation. Drug monitoring was performed every day to keep a serum level of flecainide of 200 to 600 ng.mL-1 and a digoxin level of 0.8 to 2 ng.mL-1. Failure, defined as the appearance of atrial fibrillation or flutter or the development of complex ventricular arrhythmias (Lown IVb and V), was observed in one patient in the flecainide group (7%) and in 7 patients in the digoxin group (47%) (p less than 0.05). It is concluded that flecainide is more efficient than digoxin in preventing and treating cardiac arrhythmias after thoracic operations. At the dosage used side effects related to flecainide or digoxin were not observed.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of 2 weeks of lithium carbonate administration at therapeutic plasma levels were examined in 11 normal volunteers. Serotoninergic function before and after lithium administration was assessed using low-dose intravenous clomipramine hydrochloride challenge, while urinary and plasma metabolites of norepinephrine (NE) were used to assess noradrenergic systems. Long-term lithium administration in normal subjects did not significantly or consistently enhance serotonin-mediated neuroendocrine responses but did increase measures related to neuronal release of NE. No statistically significant effects of lithium on prolactin, corticotropin, or cortisol responses to serotoninergic challenge could be detected. The probability of a type II error was assessed, and a doubling of prolactin level was unlikely to have been missed, although more modest increases (less than 75%) could have been overlooked. After 2 weeks of lithium administration, there were significant increases in 24-hour urinary excretion of NE, normetanephrine, and fractional NE release, compatible with increased neuronal release of NE and a lithium-induced subsensitivity in alpha 2-adrenergic receptor function. These changes were not statistically significant after 1 week of administration, suggesting that increased NE release is characteristic of long- rather than short-term lithium administration. Since previous reports have demonstrated enhanced prolactin responses after short- but not long-term lithium use, the present study points to temporal specificity in lithium's effects on both serotoninergic and noradrenergic function. Lithium's effects on NE release were consistent but small (a 16% increase), while its effects on serotoninergic responses were larger (a 50% increase in prolactin responses) but quite inconsistent, suggesting that neither of these systems is the primary site of action of lithium.\r"

  ".W": "As part of a study of the effects of lithium carbonate on neurochemical function in man, platelet and lymphocyte adenylate cyclase activity and lymphocyte beta-adrenergic receptor binding characteristics were determined before and after 2 weeks of lithium treatment in 10 normal volunteers. Lithium had differential effects on platelet and lymphocyte adenylate cyclase activity. In platelets, basal and stimulated (guanyl imidodiphosphate [Gpp[NH]p] or cesium fluoride) adenylate cyclase activity was significantly augmented by lithium treatment. By contrast, in lymphocytes, Gpp(NH)p- and cesium fluoride-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity was unaffected, while basal activity was decreased modestly after lithium. These results are consistent with preclinical studies that suggest that lithium's effects on adenylate cyclase activity are specific with respect to tissue and brain region and that lithium may interfere with guanine nucleotide binding (G) protein function. Lithium treatment significantly increased the ratio of low- to high-affinity dissociation constants for agonist displacement of antagonist binding to lymphocyte beta-adrenergic receptors (thought to reflect coupling between the beta-adrenergic receptor and stimulatory G protein). Lithium had significant effects on measures associated with signal transduction that might be contrasted to its more subtle effects on neuronal function (norepinephrine release) and neuroendocrine systems (responses to serotoninergic challenge) in these same subjects (reported in a companion article). Lithium's primary site of action may be on signal transduction mechanisms. These effects subsequently may be manifested in changes in neurotransmitter function that may be important to lithium's mood-stabilizing actions.\r"

These groups were studied before any drug treatment was started and were compared with a control group of 69 healthy individuals. Plasma atrial natriuretic peptide concentration was clearly raised in patients with definite heart failure and slightly raised in patients with possible heart failure. Plasma adrenaline concentration was somewhat raised in patients with definite or possible heart failure, whereas plasma noradrenaline concentration was raised only in patients with definite heart failure. Plasma renin activity was not increased in any of the patient groups and plasma aldosterone concentration was slightly increased only in patients with definite heart failure. In the total patient series there were significant correlations between plasma atrial natriuretic peptide concentration and markers of the severity of left ventricular dysfunction. There was some evidence of neuroendocrine activation in untreated heart failure: plasma concentrations of atrial natriuretic peptide and catecholamines were increased but the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system showed little or no activation.\r"

  ".U": "91249087\r", 
  ".W": "We have generated a homogeneous population of recombinant interleukin-2 (rIL-2)-stimulated effector cells termed adherent lymphokine-activated killer cells (A-LAK) from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNC) of 14 normal individuals and tested the effect of A-LAK cells on autologous hematopoietic bone marrow (BM) progenitor growth. Enrichment of A-LAK from PBMNC depended on the propensity of A-LAK precursors to adhere to plastic and proliferate in the presence of rIL-2. The resultant population had the morphologic appearance of large granular lymphocytes, and the majority of cells (73% +/- 4%) expressed the CD56+/CD3- phenotype associated with rIL-2-stimulated natural killer (NK) cells. The A-LAK population had potent lytic activity in chromium release assays against both NK-sensitive (K562) and NK-resistant (Raji) targets. When BM mononuclear cells (BMMNC) were coincubated with autologous A-LAK and rIL-2 (1,000 U/mL) added at the start of culture, dose-dependent suppression of burst-forming unit-erythroid (BFU-E) and colony-forming unit mix (CFU-MIX) colony growth was observed at effector to target ratios (E:T) ranging from 0.25:1 to 5:1 (maximal suppression BFU-E = 85% +/- 6%; CFU-MIX = 95% +/- 3%). This suppression was rIL-2 dose-dependent, and no suppression was seen in the absence of rIL-2. Depletion of BM monocytes and T lymphocytes did not alter A-LAK suppression of progenitors coincubated with A-LAK cells. Addition of polyclonal neutralizing antibodies against both interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and tumor necrosis facto alpha (TNF-alpha) to the coincubation culture completely abrogated the suppressive effect of A-LAK on BFU-E and CFU-MIX colony growth while each neutralizing antibody used alone had intermediate effects. In contrast to coincubation studies, 36 hours of preincubation of A-LAK cells with autologous BM (E:T 2.2:1) and rIL-2 (1,000 U/mL) followed by plating of preincubated BM cells in hematopoietic progenitor culture produced significant suppression of day 14 BFU-E (47% +/- 5%), but spared the more primitive CFU-MIX (7% +/- 9%), suggesting a divergent effect of A-LAK cells on hematopoietic progenitors at different stages of differentiation. Addition of neutralizing antibodies against IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha in preincubation failed to abrogate the suppressive effect of A-LAK on BFU-E colony growth, suggesting that this suppression occurs by a different mechanism than that seen in coincubation studies. Previous studies have demonstrated that the A-LAK population has cytotoxic and proliferative advantages over other killer cell populations.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

The immunological effect of IFN (interferon)-gamma on these immunocompetent cells was also investigated. The effect of IFN-gamma on TIL was an increase in CD3 (pan-T cells), especially an increase in CD8 (cytotoxic/suppressor-T cells).

With regard to RLNL, there was a tendency towards a decrease in CD3 and an increase in CD20 (B-cells) following the administration of IFN-gamma. No specific effect on stage and grade was observed apart from a reduction in T cell subset ratios in high grade patients.

Fifteen patients were catheterised with a Nelaton catheter with a special introducer to improve asepsis (O'Neil catheter). The mean incidence of significant bacteriuria in males and females who received Trisdine bladder instillations was 0.58 and 0.48% per catheterisation respectively; in males and females catheterised with the O'Neil catheter it was 1.16 and 2.93% per catheterisation respectively. The instillation of Trisdine into the bladder after each passage of a catheter resulted in a significantly lower incidence of bacteriuria compared with that which resulted from the use of the O'Neil catheter. The former method is therefore to be preferred for aseptic intermittent urethral catheterisation in patients with acute spinal cord trauma.\r"

  ".W": "Gene therapy approaches have been suggested for the treatment of cardiovascular disease. Recently, direct transfer of the gene encoding beta-galactosidase into peripheral arteries of the pig has been demonstrated. To determine whether this approach is applicable to other arterial beds and to other species, we first evaluated the use of beta-galactosidase as a marker protein in the canine model. We demonstrate that variable but substantial endogenous beta-galactosidase-like activity is induced by manipulation of canine peripheral arteries, which precludes the use of this marker protein in evaluating the efficiency of gene transfer in this model. A marker gene encoding firefly luciferase was then evaluated, and background luciferase activity was found to be low in the dog even after arterial manipulation. Using the luciferase gene, we then demonstrated lipid-mediated gene transfer directly into both coronary and peripheral arteries of the intact dog. These results indicate the feasibility of in vivo gene transfer into coronary arteries and demonstrate the use of the luciferase marker protein in quantifying recombinant protein expression following gene transfer in canine models. This simple and effective method for direct in vivo gene transfer into coronary and peripheral arteries may be applicable to the localized production of therapeutically important proteins for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. We studied the effect of intracoronary administration of arginine-8-vasopressin on blood flow in nondiseased coronary arteries and determined whether this vasoconstriction was severe enough to produce ischemia in 30 dogs. METHODS AND RESULTS. In group 1 (n = 6), after vasopressin administration coronary blood flow was decreased by 41% (p less than 0.002) without changes in heart rate or aortic pressure, and left ventricular ejection fraction measured by radionuclide angiocardiography was decreased by 18% (p less than 0.0005). In group 2 (n = 6), ischemia was confirmed by measurement of transmural pH changes. Administration of vasopressin decreased subendocardial pH of the infused zone from 7.40 +/- 0.03 to 7.31 +/- 0.07 (p less than 0.01). The subendocardial pH of the zone not infused with vasopressin did not change. To overcome the intrinsic regulation of blood flow, operating primarily in small coronary arteries, we hypothesized that vasopressin must increase resistance primarily in large rather than small coronary arteries. After intracoronary infusion in group 3 (n = 6), however, most (94%) of the increase in resistance during vasopressin administration was explained by an increase of resistance in small coronary arteries. In group 4 (n = 9), vasopressin decreased coronary blood flow by 50% and decreased local shortening by 90% at a time when systemic hemodynamics were unchanged. Coronary constriction induced by vasopressin, or the recovery from it, also was not altered by cyclooxygenase blockade. CONCLUSIONS. Thus, vasopressin produces myocardial ischemia by constricting small, nondiseased coronary arteries severely enough to overcome the competition from normal coronary regulation, and this ischemic event is not mediated by prostaglandin products.\r"

  ".U": "91249454\r", 
  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Nitroglycerin and other clinically relevant organic nitrate derivatives have been shown to inhibit platelet aggregation in vitro. This antithrombotic effect of nitrates is potentiated by reduced thiol. To determine the potential relevance of this mechanism of action in vivo, we examined the effect of intravenous nitroglycerin infusion on periodic platelet thrombus formation in a canine model of coronary artery stenosis. METHODS AND RESULTS. We used a canine model of coronary artery stenosis associated with cyclic reductions in coronary blood flow that have been shown to depend on periodic platelet thrombus formation. We quantified the frequency of cycles per 40-minute observation period and monitored the effect of a continuous infusion of intravenous nitroglycerin on the cycle frequency. The administration of 10-15 micrograms/kg/min nitroglycerin reduced cyclic platelet thrombus formation significantly and did so without a significant change in coronary artery blood flow. Pretreatment with the reduced thiol, N-acetylcysteine (100 mg/kg during 30 minutes), led to inhibition of cyclic platelet thrombus formation by intravenous nitroglycerin at doses that alone had no such effect (5 micrograms/kg/min). CONCLUSION. These data suggest that one mechanism by which intravenous nitroglycerin improves ischemia in acute coronary artery disease syndromes may be by inhibition of platelet thrombus formation and may highlight the potential importance of reduced thiol in this mechanism.\r"

  ".W": "An oral prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) analogue, OP-1206.alpha-CD, was given to rats with streptozocin (STZ)-induced diabetes to examine the therapeutic effects of OP-1206 on short-term and long-term diabetic neuropathy and its action mechanism with special reference to nerve Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase activity. In the short-term experiment, OP-1206 was administered daily to diabetic rats in 3- and 30-mg/kg doses for 4 wk from the day of STZ injection. In the long-term study, 10 micrograms/kg OP-1206 was also given daily for 8 wk from 7 mo after induction of diabetes. The compound improved decreased sciatic motor nerve conduction velocity in both short-term and long-term diabetic rats. The nerve Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase activity of diabetic rats, reduced by 40% compared with controls, was reversed to the level of controls in both experiments, whereas weight loss and hyperglycemia were unchanged, and neither nerve sorbitol accumulation nor myo-inositol depletion was corrected. In a morphometric analysis of myelinated nerve fibers (MNFs) in long-term diabetes, the mean diameter of the largest 10% of MNFs was significantly reduced in untreated diabetic compared with control rats, but OP-1206 completely reversed this reduction. The results suggest that OP-1206 ameliorates a decrease in nerve Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase activity without any effect on nerve myo-inositol level and that the compound may be not only a potent therapeutic agent for the treatment of diabetic neuropathy but also a useful research tool to investigate the mechanism of nerve Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase activity regulation.\r"

  ".W": "Attenuation of both the active transport of myo-inositol and Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase pumping activity has been implicated in the onset of sugar cataract and other diabetic complications in cell culture and animal models of the disease. Cultured bovine lens epithelial cells (BLECs) maintained in galactose-free Eagle's minimal essential medium (MEM) or 40 mM galactose with and without sorbinil for up to 5 days were examined to determine the temporal effects of hypergalactosemia on Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase and myo-inositol uptake. The Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase pumping activity after 5 days of continuous exposure to galactose did not change, as demonstrated by 86Rb uptake. The uptake of myo-[3H]inositol was lowered after 20 h of incubation in galactose and remained significantly below that of the control throughout the 5-day exposure period. The coadministration of sorbinil to the galactose medium normalized the myo-[3H]inositol uptake. No significant difference in the rates of passive efflux of myo-[3H]inositol or 86Rb from preloaded galactose-treated and control cultures was observed. Culture-media reversal studies were also carried out to determine whether the galactose-induced dysfunction in myo-inositol uptake could be corrected. BLECs were incubated in galactose for 5 days, then changed to galactose-free physiological medium with and without sorbinil for a 1-day recovery period. myo-Inositol uptake was reduced to 34% of control after 6 days of continuous exposure to galactose. Within 24 h of media reversal, myo-inositol uptake returned to or exceeded control values in BLECs switched to either MEM or MEM with sorbinil.2+ reversible and occurred independently of changes in Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase pumping activity in cultured lens epithelium, indicating that the two parameters are not strictly associated and that the deficit in myo-inositol uptake occurs rapidly during hypergalactosemia.\r"

  ".W": "Glycation, oxidation, and nonenzymatic browning of protein have all been implicated in the development of diabetic complications. The initial product of glycation of protein, fructoselysine (FL), undergoes further reactions, yielding a complex mixture of browning products, including the fluorescent lysine-arginine cross-link, pentosidine. Alternatively, FL may be cleaved oxidatively to form N(epsilon)-(carboxymethyl)lysine (CML), while glycated hydroxylysine, an amino-acid unique to collagen, may yield N(epsilon)-(carboxymethyl)hydroxylysine (CMhL). We have measured FL, pentosidine, fluorescence (excitation = 328 nm, emission = 378 nm), CML, and CMhL in insoluble skin collagen from 14 insulin-dependent diabetic patients before and after a 4-mo period of intensive therapy to improve glycemic control. Mean home blood glucose fell from 8.7 +/- 2.5 (mean +/- 1 SD) to 6.8 +/- 1.4 mM (P less than 0.005), and mean glycated hemoglobin (HbA1) from 11.6 +/- 2.3% to 8.3 +/- 1.1% (P less than 0.001). These changes were accompanied by a significant decrease in glycation of skin collagen, from 13.2 +/- 4.3 to 10.6 +/- 2.3 mmol FL/mol lysine (P less than 0.002). However, levels of browning and oxidation products (pentosidine, CML, and CMhL) and fluorescence were unchanged. These results show that the glycation of long-lived proteins can be decreased by improved glycemic control, but suggest that once cumulative damage to collagen by browning and oxidation reactions has occurred, it may not be readily reversed. Thus, in diabetic patients, institution and maintenance of good glycemic control at any time could potentially limit the extent of subsequent long-term damage to proteins by glycation and oxidation reactions.\r"

To identify methods for assessing the effects of antiviral drugs on immune cells, the PBMC response to mitogens, Con A, or phytohemagglutinin was evaluated from measurements of [3H]thymidine and [14C]-leucine incorporation, cell growth, cellular RNA, DNA, and protein levels, and the PBMC proliferative cycle (i.e., progression from G0----G1----S----G2 + M). At clinically relevant concentrations, AZT, ribavirin, or ganciclovir diminished PBMC responsiveness to mitogen. The numbers of proliferating cells in G1, S, and G2 + M phases of the cell cycle, DNA content, and [3H]thymidine uptake were decreased in cultures treated with AZT, ribavirin, or ganciclovir. AZT or ribavirin but not ganciclovir reduced RNA and protein in the cultures and inhibited cell growth. Whereas AZT, ribavirin, or ganciclovir were antiproliferative, ddI or acyclovir had little, if any, effect on PBMC mitogenesis. The inhibitory effects of antivirals on immune cells may contribute to the immune deterioration observed in patients following prolonged use of the drugs.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of a bacteriolytic enzyme, the endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase excreted by Staphylococcus aureus (SaG) on the response of human lymphocytes to mitogens and on the immune response in mice has been studied. SaG inhibited incorporation of [3H]thymidine into TCA-precipitable material by human peripheral lymphocytes stimulated either by phytohemagglutinin or by concanavalin A, as well as formation of cytoplasmic immunoglobulin-containing cells by B lymphocytes treated with pokeweed mitogen. In all cases the level of inhibition first increased with the SaG concentrations reaching values of over 80% at an enzyme concentration of 100 micrograms/ml, and then decreased. Heat-inactivated SaG as well as SaG treated with both polyclonal and monoclonal specific antibodies or enzyme inhibitors such as chitotriose or hydrolyzed peptidoglycan had no effect on lymphocyte response to mitogens. In mice, SaG at a dose of 300 micrograms per mouse was found to cause a fourfold decrease in the anti-BSA antibody titer and an approximately 70-75% reduction in the immunoglobulin-containing cells in the spleens of mice injected with sheep red blood cells. SaG also completely abolished the enhancing effect of adjuvants such as muramyldipeptide, Freund's complete adjuvant, and Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide. When SaG was injected into mice together with S. aureus peptidoglycan hydrolyzed either by SaG or by human lysozyme, the inhibitory effect on both production of anti-BSA circulating antibodies and appearance of Igc cells in the spleens of mice injected with sheep red blood cells was enhanced. As we know that (a) human tissues contain endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidases; (b) other human hexosaminidases (lysozymes) have previously been shown to interfere with the functions of immunocompetent cells; and (c) products of hexosaminidase hydrolysis of peptidoglycan (muropeptides) known to modulate immune response are ordinarily found in the urine of healthy persons, the possibility that hexosaminidases play a major role in the regulation of the immune response is raised and discussed.\r"

ANGII and thrombin dose-dependently stimulated immunoreactive (ir) endothelin-1 secretion. Human ANP(1-28) and human BNP-32 both inhibited such secretion in a dose-dependent way. Inhibition of this secretion by ANP and BNP was paralleled by an increase in the level of cyclic guanosine 5'-monophosphate (GMP). The addition of a cyclic GMP analogue, 8-bromo cyclic GMP, reduced this stimulated secretion. Rat ANP(5-25) was weaker than human ANP(1-28) at inhibiting ir-endothelin-1 secretion and increasing cyclic GMP in the cells. ir-Endothelin-1 in the medium consisted of two components separated by high pressure liquid chromatography; the major one corresponded to endothelin-1(1-21) and the minor one corresponded to big endothelin-1(1-38). Treatment with ANP and BNP did not affect this profile. These findings suggest that human ANP and BNP inhibit endothelin-1 secretion stimulated by ANGII and thrombin in these cells through a cyclic GMP-dependent process. Taken together with endothelin stimulation of ANP and BNP secretion from the heart, our results suggest the existence of a cardiac-endothelium feedback.\r"

By scanning electron microscopy, P. aeruginosa were seen associated with ciliated cells, but by transmission electron microscopy, bacteria were never seen at the interciliary spaces or attached along cilia, but were identified trapped at the extremities of cilia, usually as bacterial aggregates. A fibronectin-containing fibrillar material was seen associated with aggregated bacteria. By time-lapse video microscopy, bacteria were seen to aggregate in the culture medium following their addition to the culture wells. Progressively, these aggregates were trapped by cilia or attached to migrating cells of a lower cell layer that protruded beneath the upper layer cells, at the outgrowth periphery. P. aeruginosa adhesion to these lower cell layer migrating cells was significantly higher than to ciliated or nonciliated cells of the upper cell layer. Migrating cells were intensely labeled by the complexes Con A and arachis hypogea agglutinin (PNA)-FITC, in contrast to the other cells. The percentage of PNA-labeled cells with attached bacteria was significantly higher than that without bacteria. These results suggest that changes of cell surface glycoconjugates related with cell migration may favor P. aeruginosa adhesion to respiratory cells.\r"

A similar biologic activity was detected in culture supernatants of in vitro HIV-I-infected normal adherent and leukemic U937 cells. Tac-inhibitory activity is not cytotoxic and it could be detected in serum-free conditioned media. Recombinant granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor and phorbol myristate acetate stimulation of patients' and normal adherent cells did not enhance specifically the production of the Tac inhibitor. Biologically active conditioned media did not contain infectious virus as well as secreted p24, gp120 viral proteins; the biologic activity could not be abolished by anti-p24, anti-gp120, and anti-nef monoclonal antibodies or human purified polyclonal anti-HIV IgG. Gel filtration of conditioned media followed by anion exchange chromatography resulted in a 1,200-fold degree of purification and revealed that the biologically active molecule was cationic. Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of this fraction and gel elution of the proteins showed that the biologic activity was associated with a 29-kD protein which was distinct from alpha- or gamma-interferon, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and prostaglandin E2. The above findings demonstrate the production of inhibitory factor(s) during HIV infection, which might be involved in the pathogenesis of the patients' immune defect.\r"

  ".W": "To test whether generation of oxygen radicals during postischemic reperfusion might promote peroxidation of cardiac membrane lipids, four groups of Langendorff-perfused rabbit hearts were processed at the end of (a) control perfusion, (b) 30 min of total global ischemia at 37 degrees C without reperfusion, (c) 30 min of ischemia followed by reperfusion with standard perfusate, (d) 30 min of ischemia followed by reperfusion with the oxygen radical scavenger human recombinant superoxide dismutase (h-SOD). The left ventricle was homogenized and tissue content of malonyldialdehyde (MDA), an end product of lipid peroxidation, was measured on the whole homogenate as well as on various subcellular fractions. Reperfusion was accompanied by a significant increase in MDA content of the whole homogenate and of the fraction enriched in mitochondria and lysosomes. This phenomenon was not observed in hearts subjected to ischemia but not reperfused, and was similarly absent in those hearts which received h-SOD at reflow. Reperfused hearts also had significantly greater levels of conjugated dienes (another marker of lipid peroxidation) in the mitochondrial-lysosomal fraction. Again, this phenomenon did not occur in ischemic hearts or in reperfused hearts treated with h-SOD. Unlike the effect on tissue MDA and conjugated dienes, reperfusion did not significantly stimulate release of MDA in the cardiac effluent. Treatment with h-SOD was also associated with significant improvement in the recovery of cardiac function. In conclusion, these data directly demonstrate that postischemic reperfusion results in enhanced lipid peroxidation of cardiac membranes, which can be blocked by h-SOD, and therefore is most likely secondary to oxygen radical generation at reflow.\r"

We find that CRI-positive cells and CD5 B cells both co-express slgD but fail to bind peanut agglutinin or MAbs specific for CD10, indicating that both cell types reside in the mantle zones of secondary B cell follicles. However, less than half of the B cells bearing one or both of these CRIs express detectable levels of CD5. Nevertheless, we find that G6-reactive lymphocytes constitute a multiclonal population of cells that express homologous heavy chain variable region genes, each rearranged to one of several distinct and apparently nonmutated D and JH gene segments. Collectively, these studies indicate that expression of nondiversified autoantibody-encoding variable region genes may not be an exclusive property of B cells that bear detectable levels of the CD5 surface antigen.\r"

  ".W": "In anesthetized rats we tested the hypothesis that amphotericin B (AmB) reduces glomerular filtration rate (GFR) by activating the tubuloglomerular feedback (TGF) mechanism. Infusion of 1 mg/kg AmB over 50 min was followed by a reduction in kidney GFR (from 0.47 +/- 0.03 to 0.39 +/- 0.02 ml/min per 100 g body wt during the second hour after infusion; P less than 0.05) and by an increase in urine flow and urinary chloride excretion. Single-nephron GFR (SNGFR) measured in proximal (TGF interrupted) or distal tubules (TGF intact) decreased to a similar degree from 33.4 +/- 1.8 and 30.6 +/- 1.2 nl/min in the control period to 19.7 +/- 1.9 and 21.2 +/- 1.6 nl/min during the second hour after AmB infusion (P less than 0.05). Distal chloride concentrations and TGF responses to changes in loop of Henle flow rate were not significantly altered by AmB. AmB at 10(-5) M reduced the diameter of isolated perfused afferent arterioles from rabbit kidneys. In isometrically contracting rings of rabbit aorta and renal artery in vitro AmB produced endothelium-independent constriction, with half-maximal contraction (EC50) being achieved by 1.8 x 10(-6) and 2.6 x 10(-6) M in intact vessels and 1.3 x 10(-6) and 1.7 x 10(-6) M in endothelium-denuded vessels respectively. Tension development did not occur in Ca-free media or in the presence of Ca channel blockers. Pretreatment with ouabain or Bay K 8644 potentiated the effect of AmB. The vasoconstrictive effect of AmB was counteracted by aminophylline and atrial natriuretic peptide. We conclude that the AmB-induced reduction in GFR is not caused by TGF activation and that AmB has a direct vasoconstrictor effect that is probably initiated by depolarization-induced opening of Ca channels. This effect may be an important component of the nephrotoxic actions of AmB.\r"

Chronic treatment is associated with cardiomyopathy and characteristic myocardial ultrastructural changes, which include swelling of the t tubules. Accordingly, we investigated excitation-contraction coupling in cardiomyopathic rat heart resulting from chronic DXR treatment. Using the whole-cell patch clamp technique, we studied the L-type calcium channel in single cells enzymatically isolated from normal (CTRL) and DXR rat hearts. Despite similar cell dimensions, the total membrane capacitance was significantly smaller in the DXR cells (138 +/- 9 pF) than in the CTRL cells (169 +/- 11 pF) (mean +/- SEM, n = 9, P less than 0.05). The mean current and the current density-voltage relationships of the CTRL and the DXR cells were significantly different (n = 9, P less than 0.001) with the maximal peak L-type calcium current (ICa) density increased from 6.4 +/- 0.9 in CTRL cells to 10.5 +/- 2.4 microA/cm2 in the DXR cells (P less than 0.05). There was no shift either in the current-voltage relationship or the steady-state inactivation curve in the two cell groups. However, the fast time constant of inactivation was increased at a membrane voltage of -10 to 10 mV. Calcium channel antagonist equilibrium binding assays using [3H]-PN200-110 revealed no difference in the maximal receptor binding capacity (CTRL, 194 +/- 27 and DXR 211 +/- 24 fmol/mg protein; P greater than 0.05, n = 6) and in receptor affinity (CTRL, 0.15 +/- 0.05 and DXR 0.13 +/- 0.03 nM; P less than 0.05). These data suggest that a decrease in effective capacitance might be associated with t-tubular damage. Despite this decrease, ICa was increased in the DXR cells. Such an increase may result from an alteration in the properties of the calcium channels and/or recruitment of \"hibernating\" channels in the remaining surface and t-tubular membranes.\r"

  ".U": "91250566\r", 
  ".W": "Most biologic responses to IL-2 have been attributed to interaction of IL-2 with a high affinity receptor which consists of a heterodimer composed of two distinct IL-2-binding proteins (IL-2R alpha/IL-2R beta). However, both low affinity IL-2R alpha (55 kD) and intermediate affinity IL-2R beta (70-75 kD) also appear to be expressed independently on the cell surface. We investigated the receptor-specific regulatory effects of IL-2 on cytokine production in unstimulated and activated T cells. T cells were activated by stimulation of the antigen receptor complex with anti-CD3 mAb. IL-2 (10(2) U/ml, 1 nM) stimulation of resting cells resulted in a fivefold increase in GM-CSF release but in only minimal IFN-gamma release. IL-2 markedly augmented mRNA expression of GM-CSF but not IFN-gamma in unstimulated T cells. IL-2R beta mAb but not IL-2R alpha mAb decreased IL-2-induced GM-CSF release and mRNA expression from unstimulated T cells. IL-2 concentrations required for GM-CSF release from resting cells suggested ligand binding to an intermediate affinity receptor. GM-CSF and IFN-gamma release from activated T cells increased four- to fivefold in response to 1 nM IL-2 and IL-2 augmented both GM-CSF and IFN-gamma mRNA. IL-2R beta mAb but not IL-2R alpha mAb reduced GM-CSF release and mRNA expression in activated T cells stimulated with 1 nM IL-2. IL-2R alpha blockade markedly decreased IL-2-induced IFN-gamma release and mRNA expression from activated cells, while IL-2R beta blockade had little effect on IFN-gamma production in activated cells. IL-2R alpha blockade altered the affinity of the receptor mediating activated cell GM-CSF release from a high affinity to an intermediate affinity state. These studies indicate an independent role for IL-2R beta in mediating GM-CSF production from T cells. They also suggest that unstimulated and activated T cells, which express distinct IL-2 receptor moieties, mediate release of separate lymphokines and that different subunits of the IL-2 receptor may play an important role in the regulation of cytokine production.\r"

We report on the first complete primary sequence deduced from cDNA analysis of a kappa light chain responsible for LCDD associated with an apparently nonsecretory myeloma. Bone marrow myeloma cells contained intracellular kappa chains and no heavy chains by immunofluorescence. Kidney biopsy showed typical nonamyloid PAS-positive kappa chain deposits. SDS-PAGE analysis of material extracted from a kidney biopsy specimen and of Ig produced by the myeloma cells revealed kappa chains of abnormally high apparent molecular mass (30,000). Comparison of the NH2-terminal aminoacid sequence of the kappa chain deposited in the kidney and of the complete sequence of several identical kappa cDNA clones from bone marrow cells showed the identity of the tissue deposited and plasma cell kappa chain. The kappa mRNA had an overall normal structure and corresponded to the V kappa IV gene rearranged to J kappa 1 and followed by a normal constant exon of the Km(3) allotype. The variable sequence differed from the V kappa IV germline gene by nine point mutations, including an Asp----Asn substitution at position +70 resulting in a potential N-glycosylation site. In vitro biosynthesis experiments and treatment with N-glycosidase provided evidence for the intracellular glycosylation of the monoclonal kappa chain. The peculiar sequence and the glycosylation of a kappa chain of the rare V kappa IV subgroup might be responsible for structural abnormalities leading to tissue deposition.\r"

The number of cells secreting interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) in response to AChR during 48 h culture of blood mononuclear cells (PBL) may reflect AChR-reactive T cells. Using an immunospot assay, we detected such cells in 23 of 30 patients with MG at a mean number of 1 per 33.333 PBL. AChR-reactive T cells were also found in patients with other neurological diseases (OND) and in healthy subjects but at lower frequencies and numbers. The T cell response to purified protein derivative and to PHA, and also to two major myelin proteins (basic protein and proteolipid protein) did not differ between MG and the two control groups, underlining the specificity of an augmented T cell reactivity to AChR in MG. Evaluation of the B cell response by enumerating anti-AChR IgG antibody secreting cells revealed such cells in 27 of 28 patients with MG at a mean value of 1 per 14,085 PBL. Cells secreting anti-AChR antibodies of the IgA and IgM isotypes were also detected in MG, but less frequently, at lower numbers, and only in conjunction with IgG antibody secreting cells. Anti-AChR antibody secreting cells were also found among patient with OND and in healthy controls, but at lower frequencies and numbers. These data confirm that AChR is a major target for autoimmune response in MG.\r"

  ".W": "The helper activity of resting T cells and in vitro generated effector T cells and the relative roles of cognate interaction, diffusible cytokines, and non-cognate T-B contact in B cell antibody responses were evaluated in a model in which normal murine CD4+ T cells (Th), activated with alloantigen-bearing APC, were used to support the growth and differentiation of unstimulated allogeneic B cells. Both \"fresh\" T cells, consisting of memory and naive cells, stimulated for 24 h, and \"effector\" T cells, derived from naive cells after 4 days of in vitro stimulation, induced the secretion of IgM, IgG3, IgG1, IgG2a, and IgA. Effector T cells were significantly better helpers of the response of small dense B cells, inducing Ig at lower numbers and inducing at optimal numbers 2- to 3-fold more Ig production than fresh T cells. The predominant isotype secreted was IgM. Supernatants derived from fresh T cell cultures contained moderate levels of IL-2, whereas those from effector cultures contained significant levels of IL-6 and IFN-gamma in addition to IL-2. The involvement of soluble factors in the B cell response was demonstrated by the ability of antibodies to the cytokines IL-2, IL-4, and IL-6 to each block Ig secretion. Antibodies to IL-5 and IFN-gamma had no effect on the T cell-induced response. Kinetic studies suggested that IL-4 acted during the initial stages of the response, whereas the inability of anti-IL-6 to block B cell proliferation suggested that IL-6 was involved in part in promoting differentiation of the B cells. The relative contributions of cognate (MHC-restricted) and bystander (MHC-unrestricted) T-B cell contact vs cytokine (non-contact)-mediated responses were assessed in a transwell culture system. The majority of the IgM, IgG3, IgG1, and IgG2a response induced by both fresh and effector T cells was dependent on cognate interaction with small, high density B cells. In contrast, a small proportion of these isotypes and most of the IgA secreted resulted from the action of IL-6 on large, presumably preactivated, B cells. The IgA response did not require cell contact or vary when fresh and effector cells were the helpers. The contribution of bystander contact in the overall antibody response to both T cell populations was minimal.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

These cells proliferated for the first 3 to 4 days and then remained viable for up to 14 days in the presence of IL-7, IL-2 or IL-4 had only limited growth-promoting activity on these cells and could not maintain the cell viability. We followed the phenotypic change of triple negative thymocytes during culture with IL-7. After 7 to 14 days of culture with IL-7, a considerable proportion became CD4+ CD8+ (double positive). These cells were found to be CD3- CD4+ CD8 alpha+ beta- in contrast to common double positive thymocytes, which express low levels of CD3 and both alpha- and beta-chains of CD8. By using four-color immunofluorescence and multi-parameter cytofluorometric analysis, we could identify this novel subset in fresh thymocytes. These results suggest that the CD3- CD4+ CD8 alpha+ beta- subset exists physiologically in the human thymus and may represent an intermediate stage between triple negative and common double positive thymocytes.\r"

In this report, we show that a protein kinase C (PKC) activator, PMA (10 ng/ml) can replace IFN-gamma in inducing this form of macrophage competence. IFN-gamma-induced cellular competence was abrogated specifically by a PKC inhibitor but not by inhibitors that have specificity for cyclic nucleotide-dependent protein kinases. Furthermore, PGE2 known to induce protein kinase A in murine macrophages also failed to induce competence. In contrast, the ability to induce Th responses was neither dependent on IFN-gamma nor inhibited by prior treatment with protein kinase inhibitors. Furthermore, PKC depletion of macrophages by treatment with high doses (100 ng/ml) of PMA abrogated their ability to induce Ts cells. In addition, PKC-depleted macrophages failed to regain the ability to stimulate Ts cells after further treatment with IFN-gamma. The ability of IFN-gamma to modulate macrophage-mediated induction of Ts cells does not clearly correlate with an increased Ia expression as inducible expression of Ia was not consistently abrogated by PKC inhibitor treatment. In addition, PKC inhibitors failed to prevent the production of the cytokines IL-1 and IL-6. However, incubation of IFN-gamma or PMA-treated macrophages with antibodies recognizing the putative IJ ligand blocked the ability to induce Ts cells, suggesting the expression of these determinants on accessory cells is responsible for Ts induction.\r"

  ".W": "CD69 is a phosphorylated disulfide-linked homodimer that appears on the surface of human T, B cells and thymocytes in the early steps of activation; its molecular mass is 28 to 34 kDa under reducing conditions. This molecule is able to mediate positive signals to the lymphocytes as the anti-CD69 mAb (MLR3, AIM, Leu 23) in synergism with phorbol esters induce IL-2 production and proliferation of lymphocytes. Here we show that this molecule is associated to a GTP binding protein that is a substrate for Bordetella pertussis toxin. The relevance of CD69 in the activation process is also suggested by the broad range of signals able to modulate CD69 on T cells. In fact, not only the mitogens or the CD3-promoted activation, but also the alternative pathways mediated by CD2 or CD28 are accompanied by CD69 expression; moreover a very rapid and transient appearance of CD69 on the cell surface is observed also in response to a stimulus not specifically involved in T cell activation such as heat shock. Finally we demonstrate that CD69 is present in the cytoplasm of nonactivated T cells; accordingly its surface expression at the onset of activation is independent on a new RNA or protein synthesis.\r"

  ".W": "Mice homozygous for lpr and gld develop profound lymphadenopathy characterized by the expansion of two unusual T cell subsets, a predominant Ly-5(B220)+ CD4- CD8- double negative (DN) population and a minor CD4 dull+ Ly-5(B220)+ population. The mechanisms promoting lymphoproliferation are unknown, but one possibility is a abnormality in the production of cytokines that regulate T cell growth. In the present report, unfractionated LN cells and sorted T cell subsets from C3H-lpr, -gld, and -+/+ mice were compared for spontaneous and induced secretion of a spectrum of lymphokines. In addition, CD4+, CD4 dull+ Ly-5(B220)+, and DN T cells were examined for expression of CD3 epsilon, TCR-alpha/beta heterodimers, Ly-6C, and CD44 and for proliferative responses to immobilized anti-TCR mAb and cofactors. These studies revealed that sorted DN T cells did not secrete IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, GM-CSF, TNF-alpha, or IFN-gamma spontaneously or after TCR-alpha/beta cross-linking. In contrast, stimulated unfractionated lpr and gld LN cells proliferated strongly and secreted high levels of IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha and low levels of IL-3, IL-4, and IL-6. Despite a 5- to 10-fold deficit in the frequency of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, cytokine secretion by lpr and gld LN generally exceeded that of +/+ LN. Comparisons of cytokine secretion by stimulated CD4+ T cells revealed that +/+, lpr, and gld CD4+ Ly-5(B220)- T cells proliferated strongly, but only lpr and gld cells produced significant levels of IFN-gamma. The lpr and gld CD4+ T cells also produced higher levels of TNF-alpha and IL-2 than +/+ cells. In contrast to normal CD4+ T cells, lpr and gld CD4+ Ly-5(B220)+ T cells proliferated weakly and did not secrete TNF-alpha, IL-2, or, in most experiments, IFN-gamma after stimulation. Phenotypic studies of T cell subsets revealed that unstimulated lpr and gld CD4+ Ly-5(B220)- T cells express significantly higher levels of CD44 than +/+ CD4+ T cells. In addition, CD4 dull+ Ly-5(B220)+ cells closely resembled DN T cells in size and expression of TCR-alpha/beta, CD3epsilon, CD44, and Ly-6C. Since elevated CD44 expression is generally associated with T cell activation and only previously activated normal CD4+ T cells produce high levels of IFN-gamma in vitro, our data suggest that lpr and gld CD4+ Ly-5(B220)- T cells contain a higher than normal proportion of primed or memory T cells and thus may be polyclonally activated in vivo.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Histologically, R73 mAb-treated rats had mild hyperplasia of synovial lining cells and minimal destruction of cartilage. In contrast, control-treated animals developed marked pannus formation, with pronounced infiltration of mononuclear cells and severe destruction of cartilage and subchondral bone. The preventive effect of R73 mAb on streptococcal cell wall-induced arthritis was associated with the marked depletion of alpha beta + T cells by R73 mAb. These results indicate that T cells play a crucial role in chronic erosive streptococcal cell wall-induced arthritis.\r"

  ".W": "There is growing evidence to suggest a regulatory role of IL-4 in the immune system affecting both proliferation and lymphokine production. In the present work we have analyzed the effect of IL-4 on IL-2 and IFN-gamma synthesis by stimulating CD4+ human T cells (+10% accessory cells) with Con A in the presence of several doses (1 to 100 U/ml) of human rIL-4. The results showed an impaired IL-2 and IFN-gamma synthesis in the presence of IL-4. This inhibition was dose dependent and was evident only when IL-4 was added in the first 2 h of culture. Moreover, the external addition of IL-2 did not revert the inhibitory effect of IL-4 on IL-2 and IFN-gamma synthesis induced by Con A. We have also analyzed the effect of IL-4 on the expression of both alpha- and beta-chains of the IL-2R. Although the expression of IL-2R alpha mRNA was not modified after 6 h in culture in the presence of IL-4, a decrease was observed at 24 and 48 h. The addition of rIL-2 showed that the inhibition in IL-2R alpha expression could be explained by an impairment in the up-regulatory signal transmitted through the IL-2R. In addition to this, IL-4 did not modify the IL-2R beta mRNA expression at 6 and 24 h although a decreased expression was observed at 48 h which could be explained by the defective IL-2 production. The differential effect of IL-4 on the up-regulatory effect of IL-2 in the expression of IL-2R alpha and IL-2R beta suggest the existence of different regulatory mechanisms acting on the expression of both chains.\r"

When this HRF is inserted into sheep erythrocyte membranes, it is able to protect the erythrocyte from LAK cell lysis. In this report, we show that while HRF can inhibit human complement but not rat complement-mediated hemolysis, it is able to inhibit LAK cell lysis by both human and rat LAK cells. HRF is therefore a more general protective protein than has been previously thought.\r"

  ".W": "T cell-mediated protection against a recombinant vaccinia virus was evaluated in mice with respect to the relative contributions of CTL vs that of T cell-dependent IL and of CD4+ cells. H-2b mice primed with the wildtype of vesicular stomatitis virus serotype Indiana (VSV-IND wt) mount an in vitro measurable cytotoxic response against the nucleoprotein (NP) of VSV-IND and are protected against a challenge infection with a vaccinia-VSV recombinant virus expressing the NP of VSV-IND (vacc-IND-NP). Their protective mechanism was highly susceptible to in vivo depletion of CD8+ T cells, but resistant to CD4+ depletion or treatment with anti-IFN-gamma and anti-TNF-alpha. Surprisingly, also VSV-CTL nonresponder H-2k mice were protected against a challenging infection with vacc-IND-NP when primed with VSV-IND wt. In contrast to the CTL responder H-2b mice, this protection was highly susceptible to CD4+ T cell depletion and to anti-IFN-gamma or anti-TNF-alpha treatment, but resistant to CD8+ T cell depletion. Antibodies were not responsible because they failed to transfer protection; in contrast CD4+ T cells conferred significant protection. VSV-CTL responder H-2b and nonresponder H-2k mice were protected almost equally well against a challenge dose of 10(3) pfu vacc-IND-NP inoculated intracerebrally. However, after intracerebral challenge with 5 x 10(6) pfu vacc-IND-NP, the CTL nonresponder mice died, whereas the CTL responder mice eliminated the virus by day 5. These results collectively show that CD4+ T cell-dependent IL may mediate antiviral protection, but their efficiency is relatively weak compared with CD8-mediated protection correlating with cytotoxic activity in vitro.\r"

  ".U": "91250727\r", 
  ".W": "IFN-gamma clearly plays an important role in the murine host response against Listeria monocytogenes, but the time course of its production and its precise role in immunity remain controversial. To address these issues, we sequentially monitored IFN production and bacterial accumulation in vivo in C57B1/6 mice during primary listeriosis. IFN-gamma mRNA levels (measured by Northern blot analysis of freshly isolated splenic RNA) and serum IFN (measured by ELISA) were both maximal on day 1 of infection, decreasing steadily after day 2 to barely detectable levels by days 4 to 6. Significantly, there was no direct relationship between IFN levels and listericidal activity in vivo. Between days 1 and 3, the period of maximal IFN production, host bacterial load (assessed by quantitating live L. monocytogenes/spleen) increased approximately 10- to 50-fold. On the other hand, during the immune phase of infection (between days 5 and 7), a period when both IFN mRNA and protein were barely detectable, the host bacterial load decreased 1,000- to 10,000-fold. The paucity of IFN production in vivo during the immune phase was unexpected in light of previous reports demonstrating abundant in vitro lymphokine release by splenocytes isolated during the same time period. By direct comparisons of IFN production in vivo and in vitro, however, we could show that the late (days 6-7) peak of IFN release observed in Ag-stimulated cultures was an in vitro artifact. By contrast the pattern of spontaneous IFN release (obtained when freshly isolated cells were incubated in the absence of Ag) conformed more closely to that observed in vivo. Because listerial Ag stimulated vigorous lymphokine release in vitro, we sought to determine whether an analogous effect could be observed in vivo. In fact, even the infusion of very large doses of live bacteria (5-20,000,000/mouse) did not stimulate endogenous IFN-gamma production in mice infected for 6 to 7 days. These studies suggest three major conclusions: 1) IFN production in vivo occurs primarily during the early phase of listeriosis; 2) the dramatic decrease in bacterial numbers observed late in infection cannot be directly attributed to increased IFN production by LM-immune T cells; 3) although Ag-driven cultures of freshly isolated cells can provide useful information about the potential lymphokine-producing capabilities of Ag-specific T cells, these results have limited relevance in understanding patterns of T cell lymphokine production in vivo.\r"

  ".W": "Peritoneal macrophages from mice infected with an extracellular parasite, Trypanosoma musculi were effective in inhibiting parasite proliferation in vitro. This trypanostatic activity could be suppressed by NG monomethyl-L-arginine (NGMMA), a specific inhibitor of a biochemical pathway synthesizing L-citrulline and inorganic nitrogen oxides from L-arginine. Macrophages exerted this in vitro antiproliferative effect from the 10th day of infection on and this activity was maximum around 14th day of infection. Nitrite production paralleled development of macrophage trypanostatic activity. Macrophages collected from BCG-infected mice or treated with IFN-gamma in vitro also exerted a trypanostatic activity which was suppressed by NGMMA. A trypanostatic activity suppressed by NGMMA was also exerted by splenic macrophages from T. musculi-infected mice. Trypanostatic activity of IFN-gamma-treated macrophages was reduced by addition of anti-TNF-alpha showing the participation of TNF-alpha in IFN-gamma-mediated macrophage trypanostatic activity. Nitric oxide (NO) gas inhibited T. musculi proliferation. Addition of excess iron reversed the trypanostatic effect of both macrophages and NO gas. All these data showed that, as reported for a broad spectrum of microorganisms, activated macrophages displayed an antimicrobial effect on trypanosomes through the L-arginine: NO pathway that could participate in controlling infection in T. musculi-infected mice before appearance of antibody-dependent mechanisms. NO production by activated macrophages could trigger iron loss from critical target enzymes in trypanosomes.\r"

  ".W": "A survey of Ig synthesis among mu-heavy chain-producing human B cell lines indicated that roughly one-third co-express full length (mu+) and a particular type of truncated mu-chain (designated mu'). The relative molecular size of the intracellular form of this truncated mu-chain and its normal pattern of N-glycosylation suggested that mu'-chains were missing a single Ig domain at the protein level. Cell-free translation of polyA+ RNA from mu'-producing human B cell lines generated appropriate mu'-translation products, and Northern blot analysis demonstrated the presence of correspondingly truncated mu'-transcripts in these lines. These results pointed to a pretranslational basis for mu+/mu' co-expression. Sequencing of mu+- and mu'-cDNA clones from two human B cell lines showed that mu+- and mu'-transcripts derive from the same primary transcript, with mu'-mRNA formed by a direct leader-to-C mu 1 exon splice such that the heavy chain variable region exon is excluded via a cassette-type alternative splicing mechanism. Southern blot analysis of the rearranged Ig heavy chain genes in one B cell line confirmed that the co-expressed mu+- and mu'-mRNA derive from the same rearranged Ig heavy chain gene. mu'-cDNA clones were readily isolated from normal human bone marrow lymphocytes, whereas peripheral B cells do not appear to express mu'-transcripts. The frequent occurrence of mu'-mRNA in B cell lines, and its high relative expression in untransformed bone marrow lymphocytes attest to a mode of post-transcriptional control of Ig gene expression that may have implications for human B cell development.\r"

Here we report evidence that expression of the IFN-gamma gene may be subject to direct hormonal control. In a transient expression assay, the sex steroid 17 beta-estradiol markedly increases activity of the IFN-gamma promoter in lymphoid cells that express the appropriate hormone receptor. This effect is mediated by sequences in the 5'-flanking region of the gene, and can augment the effect of T cell-activating agents. Short term exposure to estradiol also increases IFN-gamma mRNA expression in Con A-treated murine spleen cells. Hormonal regulation of this pleiotropic cytokine may account in part for the ability of estrogen to potentiate many types of immune responses, and for the disproportionate susceptibility of females to autoimmune disease.\r"

Normally, K1 is expressed at high levels and K2 is almost silent; expression of K2 increases in mutant or experimentally allotype-suppressed animals. The reasons for the preferential utilization of the K1 isotype have not been fully elucidated. We were interested in looking for second enhancers 3' of the C kappa genes because the absence of a 3' enhancer in the K2 locus could explain the preferential utilization of the K1 isotype. However, we found a strong region of enhancer activity about 7 kb downstream of the C kappa 2 gene. Sequences in this region are highly conserved between rabbit, man, and mouse. There also appears to be a homologous 3' enhancer region in the rabbit K1 locus. We also confirmed earlier reports that the rabbit K1 intron enhancer is inactive in transient transfections into mouse B cells but find that the same construct has low but significant activity in a human B cell line. In a comparable construct the K2 intron enhancer is without activity suggesting possible differential activity of the intronic enhancers.\r"

  ".U": "91250734\r", 
  ".W": "Cold agglutinins are human autoantibodies, usually of the IgM class, which agglutinate RBC at low temperature. The major subset recognizes the I/i carbohydrate Ag, and many of these antibodies bear cross-reacting idiotypic determinants. An anti-idiotypic mAb that is specific for one of the idiotopes largely confined to cold agglutinins has been used to identify and monitor tumor cells that secrete these molecules in two patients. The tumor cells were immortalized with EBV and the idiotope-positive lines used to investigate the utilization of the VH and VL genes by these antibodies. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the two cold agglutinins (FS-1 and FS-2) revealed the utilization of a single common gene segment, VH4-21. Serologic analysis documented that only human antibodies utilizing the VH4-21 gene segment were reactive in the idiotope assay, other VHIV antibodies as well as a panel of antibodies derived from other VH families being negative. The DH, JH, VK, and JK gene segments of FS-1 and FS-2 were structurally distinct. These data suggest that the structural basis for the cross-reactive idiotope as well as cold agglutinin activity is the VH4-21 gene segment. A nucleotide change in H chain CDR1 of both cold agglutinins results in the substitution of an aspartic acid residue for glycine at position 31, suggesting that this amino acid might be critical to recognition of the red cell Ag.\r"

One of the new V beta gene families includes three genes and the other three are single member families.

  ".W": "6.1.6 is one of several immunoselected mutants from EBV-transformed human B cell lines that have undergone coordinate loss of expression of all their HLA class II genes. Similar defects have been found in cells from some patients with class II immunodeficiencies. Previous studies have suggested that the defects in 6.1.6 and in the other class II regulatory mutants are in transactive factors required for class II transcription. The defective factors, however, have not been identified. Here we present two lines of evidence that serve to localize the site of action of the factor that is defective in 6.1.6. First, transfected indicator genes linked to HLA DRA promoter fragments that include the conserved X box region are transiently expressed at greatly reduced levels in 6.1.6, compared with the progenitor cell line T5-1. Second, a DNA-protein complex, termed X-A, formed by nuclear extracts from T5-1 with DRA sequences containing the X box and a few bases 5' and 3' to it, is missing with extracts from 6.1.6. Extracts from some but not all patients with class II-negative immunodeficiency also fail to form X-A, whereas extracts from class II-negative mutants derived from the Burkitt's line Raji do form an apparently normal X-A complex. The X-A complex contains proteins of approximately 22, 32, 82, and 92 kDa that can be cross-linked to a 5-bromodeoxyuridine-substituted X box probe by UV light. A defect in an X box-binding protein, or in a factor required for its binding, is a likely cause for the loss of transcription of the class II genes in 6.1.6.\r"

All gene segments appear to be functional except J beta 2.5, which has a 5-bp frame-shifting deletion. This organizational pattern is identical to that of the mouse, and the homologous rat and mouse coding regions share about 92% nucleotide sequence identity. Our sequence comparisons indicate that a localized gene correction event has homogenized the sequences of the first exons of C beta 1 and C beta 2 in the evolutionary time since rats and mice became separate species. We have identified three repetitive elements, each flanked by short direct repeats, present in the region \"brain-specific\" identifier (ID) sequences, another is a truncated member of the LINE I class of repetitive elements, and the third is a member of the Alu type 2 family. The insertion of at least two, and probably all, of these elements has occurred since the time of rat/mouse divergence. We have identified a substantial number of \"cryptic\" rearrangement signals (heptamer/nonamer) in the C beta locus, which match the consensus sequence as well or better than authentic signals, and may represent sites of nonfunctional rearrangements.\r"

  ".W": "Beneficial effects of calcium antagonists on the pulmonary haemodynamics of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have been observed in several studies. Such effects include a decrease in pulmonary vascular resistance, an increase in cardiac output, and an increase in oxygen delivery. The clinical implications of these effects are uncertain. The randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, long-term study described here is the first to investigate the clinical effects of a calcium antagonist on patients with COPD. The aim was to test the hypothesis that the calcium antagonist, isradipine, could increase working capacity and lung function, and decrease morbidity and mortality. Fifty-two patients with COPD were investigated. During a 22-month observation period no statistically significant differences between the isradipine group and the placebo group were found with regard to these parameters. It is concluded that the existing evidence does not justify the introduction of calcium antagonists as part of the routine treatment of COPD.\r"

  ".W": "To determine whether a continuous insulin infusion improves glucose tolerance in extremely low birth weight infants, we conducted a prospective, randomized trial in 24 neonates 4 to 14 days old (mean birth weight 772.9 +/- 128 gm; mean gestational age 26.3 +/- 1.6 weeks). Infants who had glucose intolerance were randomly assigned to receive either intravenous glucose and total parenteral nutrition with insulin through a microliter-sensitive pump or standard intravenous therapy alone. One infant assigned to receive insulin never required it. The groups were similar in birth weight, gestational age, race, gender, medical condition, and energy intake before the study. The mean duration of therapy was 14.6 days (range 7 to 21 days). During the study, the 11 insulin-treated infants tolerated higher glucose infusion rates (20.1 +/- 2.5 vs 13.2 +/- 3.2 mg/kg/min (1.1 +/- 0.1 vs 0.7 +/- 0.2 mmol/L); p less than 0.01), had greater nonprotein energy intake (124.7 +/- 18 vs 86.0 +/- 6 kcal/kg/day; p less than 0.01), and had better weight gain (20.1 +/- 12.1 vs 7.8 +/- 5.1 gm/kg/day; p less than 0.01) than the 12 control infants. The incidence of hypoglycemia, electrolyte imbalance, chronic lung disease, and death did not differ between groups. We conclude that a controlled insulin infusion improves and sustains glucose tolerance, facilitates provision of calories, and enhances weight gain in glucose-intolerant premature infants.\r"

Using open-circuit respiratory calorimetry, we measured energy expenditure in 11 premature newborn infants on 2 successive days for 5 to 7 hours during and after either intermittent or continuous feeding. Infants were fed the same quantity of formula each day, either for 5 minutes or by continuous drip for 2 to 3 hours. The order of feeding type was randomized. No response of diet-induced thermogenesis to continuous feeding was found, whereas a peak increase of 15% over baseline was observed after intermittent feeding. Overall energy expenditure during the study period was significantly greater after intermittent compared with continuous feeding (2.18 +/- 0.07 kcal/kg per hour vs 2.09 +/- 0.05 kcal/kg per hour; p less than 0.05). Thus there was a mean 4% difference (range up to 17%) in energy expenditure between the two feeding modes. These results are similar to those obtained with adults and support the concept of the increased energy efficiency of continuous feeding. Further study will be necessary to document whether the increased energy efficiency provided by continuous feeding may be clinically significant.\r"

The renal manifestations of diseases associated with the production of monoclonal light chains--myeloma (cast) nephropathy, light-chain deposition disease, and amyloidosis AL--result from the deposition of certain Bence Jones proteins as tubular casts, basement-membrane precipitates, or fibrils, respectively. For unknown reasons, the severity of the renal manifestations of these diseases varies greatly from patient to patient. We employed an experimental in vivo model to determine the pathologic importance of various Bence Jones proteins. METHODS. Mice were injected intraperitoneally with 300 mg of Bence Jones protein from 40 patients with multiple myeloma or amyloidosis AL and killed 48 hours later. The mouse kidneys were examined by light and electron microscopy, and light-chain deposits were identified immunohistochemically with highly specific antihuman light-chain antiserum. RESULTS. Of the 40 different human Bence Jones proteins studied, 26 were deposited in the mouse kidneys predominantly as tubular casts, basement-membrane precipitates, or crystals; no light-chain deposits were detected in the kidneys of the mice that received the other 14 Bence Jones proteins. Of the 18 patients for whom renal tissue was available for study, the findings in 14 were comparable to those in the mice. Furthermore, the proteins obtained from 22 of the 27 patients whose serum creatinine concentrations equaled or exceeded 168 mumol per liter (1.9 mg per deciliter) were deposited in the mouse kidneys, whereas protein deposition occurred after the injection of proteins from only 4 of the 13 patients with serum creatinine concentrations below 168 mumol per liter. The repeated injection of Bence Jones proteins from two patients who had amyloidosis AL resulted in deposition of the protein in the mouse kidneys as amyloid. CONCLUSIONS. Particular Bence Jones proteins are primarily responsible for producing the distinctive types of protein deposition in renal tissue and the clinical manifestations that occur in patients with light-chain-associated diseases. This experimental model has potential value for the identification of nephrotoxic or amyloidogenic light chains.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. When administered early after an overdose of acetaminophen, intravenous acetylcysteine prevents hepatic necrosis by replenishing reduced stores of glutathione. How acetylcysteine improves the survival of patients with established liver damage induced by acetaminophen, however, is unknown. This study was undertaken to determine whether the beneficial effect of acetylcysteine under such circumstances could be due to enhancement of oxygen delivery and consumption. METHODS. We studied the effect of acetylcysteine on systemic hemodynamics and oxygen transport in 12 patients with acetaminophen-induced fulminant hepatic failure and 8 patients with acute liver failure from other causes. The acetylcysteine was given in a dose of 150 mg per kilogram of body weight in 250 ml of 5 percent dextrose over a period of 15 minutes and then in a dose of 50 mg per kilogram in 500 ml of 5 percent dextrose over a period of 4 hours; measurements were made before treatment began and after 30 minutes of the regimen. RESULTS. In the patients with acetaminophen-induced liver failure, the infusion of acetylcysteine resulted in an increase in mean oxygen delivery from 856 to 975 ml per minute per square meter of body-surface area (P = 0.0036), due to an increase in the cardiac index from 5.6 to 6.7 liters per minute per square meter (P = 0.0021). Mean arterial pressure rose from 88 to 95 mm Hg (P = 0.0054) despite a decrease in systemic vascular resistance from 1296 to 1113 dyn.sec.cm-5 per square meter (P = 0.027). There was an increase in oxygen consumption from 127 to 184 ml per minute per square meter (P = 0.0007) associated with an increase in the oxygen-extraction ratio from 16 to 21 percent (P = 0.022). The effects in the patients with acute liver failure from other causes were similar. CONCLUSIONS. The increase in oxygen delivery and consumption in response to acetylcysteine may account for its beneficial effect on survival in patients with fulminant hepatic failure induced by acetaminophen.\r"

Three out of 6 monozygotic and 2 out of 3 dizygotic unaffected PD co-twins have shown reduced putamen 18F-dopa uptake to date. In addition, an intact sibling and a daughter of 1 of 4 siblings with PD both had low putamen 18F-dopa uptake. These preliminary findings suggest there may be a familial component to the etiology of PD. PET can also be used to detect underlying nigral pathology in patients with isolated tremor and patients who become rigid taking dopamine-receptor blocking agents (DRBAs). Patients with familial essential tremor have normal, and those with isolated rest tremor have consistently low, putamen 18F-dopa uptake. Drug-induced parkinsonism is infrequently associated with underlying nigral pathology.\r"

  ".W": "Two major lines of evidence support the hypothesis that an impairment of mitochondrial function may underlie neuronal death in Parkinson's disease. First, the neurotoxicity of the parkinsonism-inducing compound 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) is due to the generation of its 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+) metabolite in the central nervous system; the toxicity of MPP+ is likely to result from its ability to block mitochondrial electron flow at the level of complex I. Second, recent studies have revealed a deficiency of mitochondrial complex I activity in the brain as well as other tissues of parkinsonian patients. This enzyme activity reduction might be explained by a defect in one or more of the genes coding for the subunits of complex I. Since seven of these genes are localized in the mitochondrial genome, it is conceivable that abnormal mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) might play a role in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. The entire sequence of the human mitochondrial genome is known, and human mtDNA can be isolated and rapidly analyzed using techniques such as the polymerase chain reaction. Therefore, identification of an easily detectable mtDNA alteration might ultimately be used as a marker for the diagnosis and screening of Parkinson's disease.\r"

  ".W": "Invasive aspergillus rhinosinusitis is a potentially lethal complication of chemotherapy-induced neutropenia in patients with acute leukemia. The majority of cases are caused by Aspergillus flavus. The infection is difficult to diagnose early but should be suspected when a neutropenic patient develops persistent fever without a known source, symptoms of rhinitis or sinusitis, cutaneous findings over the nose or sinuses, symptoms and signs of orbital or cavernous sinus disease, or an ulcerating lesion of the hard palate or gingiva. Careful anterior rhinoscopy followed by computed tomography of the sinus helps establish the diagnosis, which should be confirmed by histologic study and culture of biopsied material. Early treatment with aggressive surgery, high-dose amphotericin B and 5-fluorocytosine, and possibly white blood cell transfusions may produce a cure if the patient's bone marrow recovers. Newer antifungal agents offer promise for prophylaxis and treatment of this infection.\r"

We report the sixth case of an HIV-infected patient who developed acute myelomonocytic leukemia; HIV infection was documented by tests for serum antibodies (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and western blotting), by a markedly elevated p24 antigen level in plasma, and by cultures of CSF and peripheral blood that were positive for HIV. Furthermore, myelomonoblasts that were cultured without the addition of growth factors displayed evidence of HIV replication through the presence of p24 antigen and reverse transcriptase activity, both of which lasted for 4 weeks in the supernatant fluid of the cell cultures. This case report provides the first data indicating that HIV may infect myelomonoblasts in vivo and represents the sixth reported case of an association between HIV infection and pure acute nonlymphocytic leukemia.\r"

  ".W": "The administration of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) has been proved useful in reducing both urea nitrogen production and muscle proteolysis in trauma patients with sepsis, but the optimum infusion rate to achieve these effects is still in question. In this prospective randomized study, a group of 16 posttrauma patients with sepsis received a branched chain-enriched (BCAA = 49.4%) amino acid mixture (8 patients; 120 observations) or a standard amino acid infusion (BCAAs = 15.5%; 8 patients; 227 observations). Total calories, percent lipid calories, and amino acid nitrogen administration were not different in the two groups. Each patient was studied at 8-hour intervals for the plasma levels of amino acids, six hepatic acute-phase proteins, albumin, and other metabolic parameters, including urinary urea nitrogen and 3-methylhistidine excretion. The total intake of each amino acid and its clearance were calculated and the dose of leucine during each 8-hour period was related to the leucine clearance, plasma acute-phase protein levels, and the urinary production of urea and 3-methylhistidine, as an indicator of proteolysis. The results show a significant (r2 = 0.691; p less than 0.0001) reduction of urea nitrogen production and proteolysis as a function of the increase in leucine dose. The identification of a critical mean rate of leucine infusion has been derived from the analysis of the significant linear correlation between leucine intake and leucine clearance (r2 = 0.594; p less than 0.0001). Significant positive correlations between the leucine intake dose and the platelet count (r2 = 0.402; p less than 0.0001), the plasma fibrinogen level (r2 = 0.218; p less than 0.0001), and the regression-derived sum of six acute-phase proteins plus albumin (r2 = 0.696; p less than 0.0001) were found. The increase in leucine clearance was progressively less marked above a mean daily leucine intake rate of 1.4 mumol/kg/min, which also appeared to be the dose level that maximized the acute-phase protein and coagulation effects and reduced proteolysis and urea nitrogen production, suggesting that this is a critical BCAA infusion rate at which an optimum leucine effect occurs. From these data a BCAA (leucine) dose nomogram has been derived.\r"

As Lp(a) is enzymatically inactive, it has been suggested that high levels of Lp(a) may suppress the profibrinolytic activity at the cell surface and increase the risk for arteriosclerosis and thrombosis by competitive inhibition of plasminogen. The present study evaluated whether high levels of Lp(a) influence thrombolytic therapy in patients with acute myocardial infarction. Forty-one patients with acute myocardial infarction received a combination low-dose thrombolytic therapy with recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) and human single-chain urokinase-type plasminogen activator (scu-PA). This regimen did not induce plasminemia or a lytic state as indicated by well-maintained levels of fibrinogen. Coronary patency was assessed angiographically 90 minutes after initiation of treatment. Thrombolysis was successful in 30 and unsuccessful in 11 patients. Patients with high Lp(a) levels (greater than or equal to 25 mg/dl) (n = 9) responded equally well to thrombolytic therapy (8 of 9, patency 89%) as did patients with normal or low levels of Lp(a) (22 of 32, patency 70%, difference greater than 0.1). Lp(a) levels did not differ significantly between patients with successful and unsuccessful thrombolysis. Our results demonstrate that high levels of Lp(a) do not affect thrombolysis in patients with acute myocardial infarction when low-dose pharmacologic concentrations of rt-PA and scu-PA are applied in combination.\r"

  ".W": "To assess the long-term effect of thrombolytic therapy on left ventricular (LV) systolic function, 222 patients with acute myocardial infarction treated with intravenous tissue plasminogen activator within 4 hours of symptom onset underwent assessment of LV ejection fraction (EF) by radionuclide equilibrium angiography at hospital discharge and 1 year later. Mean EF at hospital discharge (46 +/- 12) was similar to that at 1 year (45 +/- 13). Stepwise multivariate linear regression analysis identified EF at discharge and patency of the infarct-related artery before discharge as independent predictors of EF change at 1 year (p = 0.0002 and 0.003, respectively). Random assignments to invasive versus conservative treatment strategies or to early versus delayed beta-blocker therapy did not affect EF change during follow-up. No significant deterioration of EF was observed in patients with larger infarcts. However, EF decreased from 45 +/- 10 at hospital discharge to 39 +/- 12 (p = 0.005) at 1-year follow-up in a subgroup of patients with history of prior infarction. Thus, patients with acute myocardial infarction, treated with intravenous tissue plasminogen activator early after onset of symptoms, appear to have stable LV function between hospital discharge and 1 year follow-up. The change in EF between hospital discharge and 1 year can be predicted from the EF value at discharge, patency of the infarct-related artery before discharge and history of previous myocardial infarction.\r"

  ".W": "In a previous study on the diagnostic efficiency of troponin T measurements in patients with suspected acute myocardial infarction (AMI), the authors found a high variability of troponin T serum concentration changes on day 1 in patients with AMI who underwent thrombolytic treatment. Therefore, the aims of the present study were to investigate the intracellular compartmentation of troponin T and to analyze the effects of AMI reperfusion on the appearance kinetics of cardiac troponin T in serum. Cardiac troponin T was measured with a newly developed bideterminant sandwich assay using cardiospecific, affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies and peroxidase-labeled monoclonal antibody. An unbound cytosolic troponin T pool was found in ultracentrifuged homogenates of myocardial tissue of different species ranging from 0.013 to 0.036 mg/g wet weight. The soluble troponin T molecule had electrophoretic properties identical to troponin T compartmented in the myofibrils. The clinical study group comprised 57 patients with AMI undergoing thrombolytic treatment. Blood flow to the infarct zone and point of time of reperfusion were tested by immediate and late angiography. The appearance of troponin T in serum on day 1 after the onset of AMI depended strongly on reperfusion and on duration of ischemia before reperfusion. Thus, in patients with early reperfused AMI, a marked peak in troponin T serum concentrations was found at 14 hours after the onset of pain. This early troponin T peak was absent in patients with AMI reperfusion occurring greater than 5.5 hours after the onset of pain and in patients with nonreperfused AMI. By contrast, the kinetics of troponin T release after the first day after AMI were unaffected by reperfusion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "91253650\r", 
  ".W": "PURPOSE: Abnormalities in pulmonary function have been reported in association with chronic liver disease of varied etiology. The aim of this study was to better define the frequency and nature of these abnormalities in patients who were being evaluated for liver transplantation. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed a battery of pulmonary function tests and chest radiographs in 116 consecutive patients (50 men, 66 women; aged 19 to 70 years, mean 44.6 years) with severe advanced liver disease who were hospitalized specifically for evaluation for possible orthotopic liver transplantation and were able to perform technically satisfactory tests. In 17 patients, quantitative whole-body technetium-99m macroaggregated albumin perfusion scanning was also performed for assessment of possible right-to-left shunting through intrapulmonary vascular dilatations. RESULTS: The most commonly affected test of lung function was the single-breath diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO), which was abnormal in 48%, 45%, and 71% of patients who never smoked, former smokers, and current smokers, respectively. Ventilatory restriction was noted in 25% of all patients, airflow obstruction (reduced ratio of forced expiratory volume in 1 second to forced vital expiratory volume in 1 second to forced vital capacity) in only 3%, and a widened alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient in 45%. Diffusion impairment was accompanied by a restrictive defect in only 35% of the patients and by an abnormally widened alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient in 60%. When diffusion impairment was accompanied by an oxygenation defect, it was also associated with a significantly increased right-to-left shunt fraction (mean 24.9%) assessed from quantitative whole-body perfusion imaging. On the other hand, isolated diffusion impairment unaccompanied by significant hypoxemia (noted in approximately a third of the patients with a reduced DLCO) was not associated with evidence of significant intrapulmonary shunting (mean right-to-left shunt fraction 6.7%). CONCLUSIONS: Most patients with advanced liver disease have one or more types of abnormality in lung function, a reduced DLCO being the single most common functional defect. Mechanisms accounting for the abnormality in gas transfer may include intrapulmonary vascular dilatations, diffuse interstitial lung disease, pulmonary vaso-occlusive disease, and/or ventilation-perfusion imbalance.\r"

For antigenic analysis of these strains, we produced monoclonal antibodies against the Irie strain isolated in 1971, and the Hirano and Shimokoshi strains isolated in 1980. In all, 34 monoclonal antibodies were produced and their reactivities were determined by the immunofluorescent antibody test. The serological reactivity of the antibodies against these three strains and classic representative strains (Gilliam, Karp and Kato) showed varied reactive characteristics, i.e., serotype-specific, species-specific and intermediate reactivities. It was revealed that these strains are antigenically different from the classic ones. Moreover, by using the serotype-specific monoclonal antibodies, nine strains newly isolated in Miyazaki Prefecture were classified into the Irie and the Hirano types. The antigenicity of the Shimokoshi strain differed from those of the other strains used in this study. From these results, the strains of R. tsutsugamushi used in this study fell into six serotypes including the classic strains. SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting were performed to determine the molecular sizes of the antigenic polypeptides. The results revealed that the serotype-specific antigens belong to the 60-kDa class whereas the species-specific antigens belong to the 61-kDa, 60-kDa or 44-kDa class.\r"

RBCs from P. coatneyi-infected rhesus monkeys (Macaca-mulatta) were collected, allowed to mature overnight in vitro and found to form rosettes as hypothesized. This observation adds to the known falciparum-like characteristics of P. coatneyi, and suggests that the Macaca mulatta-P. coatneyi model may be appropriate for pathophysiologic studies of cytoadherence.\r"

BALB/c mice were immunized with supernatant of disrupted epimastigotes of T. rangeli and with epimastigotes (EPI) of T. rangeli fixed with glutaraldehyde. Both of the antigens were emulsified with incomplete Freund's adjuvant (IFrAdj). All of the animals received T. cruzi Tulahuen antigens in the footpad and the skin reactivity was later studied. The mice that received EPI with or without IFrAdj showed significantly higher skin reactivity than controls, both in Arthus (3 hr) and delayed type hypersensitivity (24 hr) reactions. Furthermore, the mice immunized with T. rangeli developed antibodies against T. cruzi detectable through hemagglutination and immunofluorescence tests. When the animals were challenged with trypomastigotes of T. cruzi, only the groups immunized with EPI-IFrAdj had significantly lower parasitemias and greater survival against infection than controls. These results suggest that T. rangeli can induce humoral and cellular immune response against T. cruzi and attenuate the acute period of the infection produced by this parasite. This is the first time that partial resistance to T. cruzi in T. rangeli-immunized mice is reported. These findings may provide a useful tool for future studies directed at the immunoprevention of Chagas' disease.\r"

Patients with hepatic fibrosis were mostly high responders in contrast with those without fibrosis. High immune response and susceptibility to post-schistosomal hepatic fibrosis were associated with a high frequency of A2 and B12 antigens and a lack of DR2 antigens, while low response was associated with the presence of the DR2 antigen. The T4+:T8+ ratio showed increased suppressor proportions in patients with low immune response and/or with no hepatic fibrosis. We suggest an immunogenetic susceptibility for post-schistosomal hepatic fibrosis, probably controlled by HLA-linked genes via the suppressor T cells.\r"

  ".U": "91253683\r", 
  ".W": "Granulomatous hypersensitivity to parasite eggs of Schistosoma mansoni is an important factor in the development of morbidity in chronic schistosomiasis. It has been demonstrated previously that the chronic, well-tolerated, intestinal form of schistosomiasis is associated with the establishment and maintenance of a variety of immunoregulatory mechanisms. We have used an in vitro model of granuloma formation for the purpose of studying the regulation of granulomatous hypersensitivity to S. mansoni egg antigens, mediated by immune complexes (IC). Our results show that the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from patients with active schistosome infections, when treated with sera from chronic schistosomiasis patients, were able to induce an inhibitory activity on in vitro granuloma formation. Significant modulation of the in vitro granuloma reaction remained after treatment of PBMCs with isolated IC or manufactured IC with soluble egg antigen (SEA) and purified IgG from pooled chronic schistosomiasis sera. In contrast to granuloma modulation stimulated with whole molecule IgG-SEA IC, the incubation of PBMCs with F(ab')2 IgG-SEA IC did not induce any suppression of the granulomatous hypersensitivity to SEA. It appears in this model system that IC may inhibit the activity of granuloma formation by stimulating macrophages to release suppressive mediators. We have demonstrated this possibility by inhibition of prostaglandin activity using indomethacin. The addition of indomethacin to the granuloma culture significantly reduced in vitro granulomatous hypersensitivity to S. mansoni eggs in patients with chronic intestinal schistosomiasis and do so by inducing macrophages to secrete prostaglandins.\r"

  ".W": "Five hundred thirty six Sudanese schoolchildren with Schistosoma mansoni infection were treated at random with either 20 mg or 40 mg/kg praziquantel. Seven months later 420 children could be reinvestigated by ultrasonography. Reduction of egg excretion and reversibility of sonographically-proven periportal fibrosis (PF) was not significantly different in the two groups. Schistosoma mansoni-induced PF grade II decreased from 22.9% to 6.7% and grade III from 5.2% to 1.6%. An increased prevalence of PF grade I, from 10% to 29.8% of the investigated patients, was observed. This increase was caused partly by a downshifting of patients who had PF II (n = 45) and PF III (n = 8) before therapy, but also by patients who developed PF I in the seven months after therapy (n = 56). The overall percentage of patients with PF before and after treatment was 38.1%. Of 420 children, 17.4% increased in their PF grade, 55% remained at the same level and 27.6% improved. Children younger than 11 years of age had a higher rate of complete reversibility than older ones. The percentage of patients with hepatomegaly decreased significantly (11.6% to 6.9%; p = 0.001). The rate of splenomegaly remained unchanged. It was concluded that within seven months therapy with praziquantel resulted in a considerable qualitative improvement of PF in Sudanese schoolchildren with S. mansoni infection.\r"

  ".W": "Following envenomization by Echis carinatus sochureki, a professional snake handler developed a profound coagulopathy manifested by hemorrhage from the bite site, venipuncture sites and gums; coagulation testing revealed prothrombin and partial thromboplastin times greater than 150 seconds, a fibrinogen of 0 mg%, and marked elevation of fibrin degradation products. In addition, protein C antigen levels were undetectable. The coagulopathy was treated with cryoprecipitate; two different antivenoms were also administered with uncertain benefit. Subsequently, the properties of the venom and antivenoms were studied. Venom did not directly clot fibrinogen; however, venom concentrations as low as 0.2 micrograms/ml caused significant prothrombin activation. In addition, venom activated protein C in the absence of thrombomodulin, and this activity was inhibited by hirudin. The ability of four commercial antivenoms to neutralize the venom prothrombinase and hemorrhagic activity was measured. Three of the four antivenoms partially neutralized venom-induced prothrombin activation. Extreme differences in efficacy were found among the four antivenoms in neutralizing venom hemorrhagic activity in mice. This case illustrates the difficulty in managing the complex coagulopathy that can result from exotic snake envenomization, and identifies a new coagulant property of Echis carinatus venom (protein C activation).\r"

  ".W": "Prior reports suggest cerebral blood flow (CBF) responses to changing bypass (systemic) flow rates may differ between alpha-stat and pH-stat management. To compare the effect of blood gas management upon CBF responses to changing systemic flow and pressure, 15 New Zealand White rabbits, anesthetized with fentanyl and diazepam, underwent nonpulsatile cardiopulmonary bypass at 25 degrees C. One group of animals (n = 8) was randomized to alpha-stat blood gas management that maintained arterial carbon dioxide tension (PaCO2) approximately 40 mmHg when measured at 37 degrees C. A second group (n = 7) was managed with pH-stat technique, maintaining PaCO2 approximately 40 mmHg when corrected to the animal's actual temperature. Bypass was initiated at a flow rate of 100 ml.kg-1.min-1 and, after approximately 20 min, control hemodynamic and CBF measurements (radioactive microspheres) were made. Thereafter, bypass flow rate was changed in random order at 15-min intervals to 50, 70, and 100 ml.kg-1.min-1. CBF and hemodynamic measurements were repeated at the end of each period of altered bypass flow. Groups differed significantly with respect to both pHa and PaCO2. There were no significant differences between groups with respect to bypass flow rate, mean arterial pressure (MAP), central venous pressure, temperature, hematocrit, arterial oxygen tension (PaCO2), or bypass duration at any measurement point. MAP decreased significantly, from approximately 80 to approximately 65 mmHg with decreasing bypass flow (P = 0.0001). Over the entire range of bypass flows, CBF decreased with decreasing bypass flow (P = 0.001), and the degree of change was equivalent among regions and between groups.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Patients were randomly assigned to one of four groups: 1) oximeter and capnograph; 2) only oximeter; 3) only capnograph; or 4) neither oximeter nor capnograph data available to the anesthesia team. An anesthesiologist, not involved in patient care, observed all cases and continuously recorded hemoglobin oxygen saturation (Spo2), ECG, expired CO2, and the oximeter plethysmographic output. Mean age, weight, ASA physical status, airway management (mask or endotracheal tube), and anesthetic technique were similar in each group. Two-hundred sixty problems were documented in 153 patients. Fifty-nine events in 43 patients resulted in \"major\" desaturation (Spo2 less than or equal to 85% for greater than or equal to 30 s). Fifteen \"major\" capnograph events (esophageal intubation, disconnection, accidental extubation, or obstructed endotracheal tube) were observed in 11 patients; 8 of these also developed varying degrees of desaturation. One-hundred thirty \"minor\" desaturation events (Spo2 less than or equal to 95% for greater than 60 s) and 79 \"minor\" desaturation events (hypercarbaria or hypocarbia) were observed. A number of problems fulfilled criteria in multiple categories. Infants less than or equal to 6 months of age had the highest incidence of major desaturation events (18 of 65 [27%]) compared to toddlers 7-24 months of age or children greater than 24 months of age (P less than 0.001). Blinding the oximeter data increased the number of patients (12 vs. 31) experiencing major desaturation events (P = 0.003); blinding the capnograph data altered neither the frequency of desaturation events nor the incidence of major capnograph events.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Genetic restriction studies have now demonstrated that these clones recognize myelin basic protein in association with human leukocyte antigen DRw13. Studies of the T-cell receptor beta gene rearrangements generated by these clones demonstrated 12 different patterns, as evaluated by Southern blot analysis. Thus, the human T-cell response to myelin basic protein is exceedingly heterogeneous, even among T cells that recognize the same small fragment of the molecule in association with the same class II restriction element.\r"

According to our calculations, if all Americans 65 years of age and older adhered to a cholesterol screening program similar to the one proposed by the National Cholesterol Education Program, minimum annual expenditures for screening and treatment would be between $1.6 billion and $16.8 billion, depending on the effectiveness of diet and the cost of the medications used to treat hypercholesterolemia. There is no direct evidence that this program would lessen overall morbidity or extend the lives of elderly Americans.\r"

We used scanning electron microscopy to grade endothelial cell morphologic characteristics in terms of cell shape, cell borders, cell swelling, and apical holes in pairs of corneas stored in Optisol and Dexsol. Optisolstored corneas showed significantly fewer morphologic changes after 14 days at 4 degrees C than did Dexsol-stored corneas. No significant differences were seen after 1 to 4 days at 26 degrees C. Temperature-reversal analysis showed no significant change in corneal thickness with warming after 2-week storage at 4 degrees C in either medium, although Optisol-stored corneas were significantly thinner than those stored in Dexsol at all times. The results of scanning electron microscopy suggest that preservation at refrigerator temperature for 2 weeks in Optisol is superior to preservation in Dexsol. Both media may be useful in preserving endothelial structure for limited periods at room temperature, which could provide a measure of safety in shipping or storage where refrigeration is unreliable.\r"

Systolic blood pressure fell 1.7 +/- 0.6 mm Hg, (P less than .01) in association with a mean increase in sodium excretion of 14.7 +/- 4.5 mmol/day and an increase in urine volume of 122.6 +/- 57.0 mL/day. There was a small but significant fall in plasma atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) over the 4 days of potassium supplementation, while significant increases were seen in the levels of plasma potassium (P less than .01) and aldosterone (P less than .01). After 4 days of KCl, urinary 6-keto-PGF1 alpha was significantly elevated and correlated positively with urinary sodium excretion. Plasma renin activity was unchanged. The results suggest that increased vasodilator prostanoid synthesis and a mild natriuresis may contribute to the transient fall in systolic blood pressure. The increase in aldosterone and reduction in ANP probably represent homeostatic responses to this natriuresis, and could account for the failure of potassium supplementation to induce a long-term reduction in blood pressure in other studies in normotensive subjects.\r"

  ".W": "In order to seek possible relationships between renal kallikrein and atrial natriuretic factor (ANF), we measured urinary kallikrein (UK) and ANF in 84 normal subjects (NS) and in 104 uncomplicated essential hypertensives (HP). Atrial natriuretic factor was significantly higher in HP than in NS (38.5 +/- 1.3 vs 29.0 +/- 1.3 pg/mL, P less than .01), whereas UK was significantly lower in HP than in NS (11.1 +/- 0.9 v 15.3 +/- 0.6 nkatal/24 h, P less than .01). Calculating the 95% of the percentile distribution of the single values of UK in the group of NS we were able to show that 24 out of 104 HP had a UK which fell below the lowest limit (4.5 nkat/24 h) of the normal range. We therefore divided our HP into two subgroups: patients with normal kallikrein excretion (NK) (n = 80; mean UK 13.8 +/- 0.8 nkat/24 h) and patients with low kallikrein excretion (LK) (n = 24; mean UK 2.3 +/- 0.3 nkat/24 h). Normal kallikrein patients had a mean plasma ANF value of 31.9 +/- 1.2 pg/mL which was almost superimposable to that found in NS; on the contrary, the mean plasma level of ANF in LK patients (50.7 +/- 2.2 pg/mL) was significantly higher than that measured in NK patients and in NS (P less than .01 v NK patients and NS, respectively). Since a low urinary kallikrein excretion may represent a marker of an impaired production of renal kallikrein, the high levels of ANF found in the LK subgroup could be the result of a compensatory response of the atrium attempting to maintain sodium and volume homeostasis.\r"

Infusion of ANP in the supine position provoked a significant natriuresis and diuresis and suppressed aldosterone secretion. Head-up tilt alone caused expected decreases in urine flow rate and the absolute and fractional excretion rates of sodium and increases in plasma renin activity and aldosterone levels. The combination of head-up tilt and ANP infusion resulted in a less marked decrease in urine flow rate and sodium excretion and a similar increase in plasma renin activity. However, there was a significant decrease in plasma aldosterone levels. These data support a physiologic action of ANP on renal and adrenal function.\r"

Recent studies have indicated that a class of cellular genes known as early response genes are important in the control of cellular growth properties. Two of these genes, c-jun and c-fos, play an important role in the control of cellular differentiation. Because the acute myelogenous leukemia cell line, HL-60, is capable of differentiating to either macrophages or granulocytes, it provides a good model to understand differential gene expression. To determine if the modulation of c-jun was important in the differentiation of HL-60 cells to either macrophages or granulocytes, expression of c-jun mRNA was determined by Northern analysis at various times following treatment with a variety of differentiating agents, including 12-tetradeconyl-phorbol 13-acetate (TPA), retinoic acid (RA), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), or 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25 (OH)2 D3]. Both TPA and 1,25(OH)2D3, which induce HL-60 cells to differentiate to macrophages, resulted in marked increases in c-jun mRNA; while RA and DMSO, which induce HL-60 cells to differentiate to granulocytes, did not greatly alter c-jun mRNA expression. HL-60 cell lines resistant to macrophage differentiation after exposure to either 1,25(OH)2D3 or TPA did not result in increases in c-jun mRNA. These results suggest that elevation of c-jun mRNA in HL-60 cells correlated temporally with differentiation to macrophages. Thus, c-jun may be a critical cellular transcription factor involved in macrophage differentiation.\r"

  ".W": "Patients with primary systemic amyloidosis (AL) often experience bleeding, and we report a newly recognized coagulation abnormality in AL. Of 103 patients with primary systemic AL studied over 2 years, 41 had prolongation of the thrombin time (range, 25 to 46 seconds; normal, less than 22 seconds) and reptilase time (range, 17 to 39 seconds; normal, 14 to 16 seconds). The fibrinogen from the plasma of 36 patients was precipitated by beta-alanine and diluted to a concentration of approximately 200 mg/dL. The thrombin times of the precipitated fibrinogens were normal in 34 patients, implying that an inhibitor was responsible for the abnormal tests. The addition of patient fibrinogen-free plasma to normal plasma prolonged the thrombin times, and this result confirmed the presence of an inhibitor. The inhibitor is more likely to be present in patients with nephrotic syndrome (20 of our patients) and congestive heart failure (six). A circulating monoclonal protein (24 patients), the presence of amyloid liver involvement (eight), and the presence of amyloid neuropathy (nine) were not predisposing factors. Only one patient had deficiency of factor X. We conclude that inhibition of fibrinogen conversion to a fibrin clot rather than dysfibrinogenemia is the cause of the prolonged thrombin time in primary systemic AL.\r"

  ".W": "The feasibility of combining the Lym-1 monoclonal antibody (MoAb) with interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) in the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) was evaluated. We used an in vitro tumor lysis model that incorporated fresh CLL cells from 21 different patients as targets for two distinct normal human leukocyte effector subsets, neutrophils, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Lym-1 antigen (Lym-1-Ag) expression varied greatly and did not correlate with the expression of other CLL-associated antigens such as CD5, CD19, or HLA-DR. CLL cells were not lysed by neutrophils alone or with IFN-gamma in the absence of Lym-1. Neutrophil Lym-1-dependent cytotoxicity (ADCC) in the absence of IFN-gamma was weak and inconsistent. IFN-gamma exposure induced MoAb-dependent lysis of 80% of 21 CLL targets and resulted in an eightfold augmentation of neutrophil ADCC against the remainder. Cytotoxicity correlated directly and positively with Lym-1-Ag expression. Confirmation of the need for interaction between neutrophil IgG Fc receptors (Fc gamma Rs) and the Fc portion of the Lym-1 MoAb was obtained by demonstrating that purified Staphylococcus aureus Protein A (SpA) inhibited ADCC. IFN-gamma exposure caused no consistent alternations in Lym-1-Ag expression on CLL cells so that target antigen upregulation was unlikely to account for augmentation of neutrophil ADCC. PBMCs alone, exposed to interkeukin-2 (IL-2) or IFN-gamma, or with Lym-1 in the presence or absence of IL-2 or IFN-gamma were unable to lyse CLL targets. PBMCs were able to kill Raji Burkitt lymphoma cells in conjunction with Lym-1, so their ability to interact with Lym-1-coated targets and their lytic functions appeared intact. These results emphasize the importance of examining fresh tumor cells with different leukocyte effector subsets before designing a clinical trial that combines a therapeutic MoAb with a cytokine.\r"

SETTING--Norwegian cholesterol lowering programme in Norwegian male population aged 40-49 (n = 200,000), whose interventions comprise a population based promotion of healthier eating habits, dietary treatment (subjects with serum cholesterol concentration 6.0-7.9 mmol/l), and dietary and drug treatment combined (serum cholesterol concentration greater than or equal to 8.0 mmol/l). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE--Marginal cost effectiveness ratios--that is, the ratio of net treatment costs (cost of treatment minus savings in treatment costs for coronary heart disease) to life years gained and to quality of life years (QALYs) saved. RESULTS--The cost per life year gained over 20 years of a population based strategy was projected to be 12 pounds. For an individual strategy based on dietary treatment the cost was about 12,400 pounds per life year gained and 111,600 pounds if drugs were added for 50% of the subjects with serum cholesterol concentrations greater than or equal to 8.0 mmol/l. CONCLUSIONS--The results underline the importance of marginal cost effectiveness analyses for incremental programmes of health care. The calculations of QALYs, though speculative, indicate that individual intervention should be implemented cautiously and within more selected groups than currently recommended. Drugs should be reserved for subjects with genetic hypercholesterolaemia or who are otherwise at very high risk of arteriosclerotic disease.\r"

SETTING--Leicestershire Health Authority. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Costs per affected fetus detected. RESULTS--The triple test is more cost effective than screening only by maternal age for risk cut off points for amniocentesis, resulting in a detection rate over 45%. The most efficient detection rate is around 60-65%, for which the cost per case detected is around 29,000 pounds, through screening with higher detection rates is still likely to be cost beneficial. CONCLUSIONS--Prenatal screening for Down's syndrome based on the triple test should replace screening based only on maternal age. Individual women's preferences should be elicited by the use of structured decision analysis in order to maximise utility and so increase the benefits of the screening programme.\r"

SETTING--Nottingham health district. SUBJECTS--25 brittle diabetic patients were identified in 1979-9; 11 (five men) had three or more admissions with ketoacidosis between June 1977 and 1979 and 14 (eight men) had three or more attendances at the accident and emergency department with hypoglycaemia in 1978. Two controls from our diabetic register were matched to each patient for age, sex, and duration of diabetes. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Frequency of ketoacidosis and severe hypoglycaemia in the 12 years after ascertainment; diabetic control and complications in 1988-90; retrospective attribution of the cause of brittleness. RESULTS--Patients with recurrent ketoacidosis had had a median (range) of 28 (8-67) episodes. One man died of a cerebral tumour but five of the surviving nine patients had not been admitted in the past two years, although diabetic control remained poor (median haemoglobin A1 concentration 14%). Seven patients had pure hypoglycaemic brittleness, and five had also had eight or more admissions with ketoacidosis (mixed brittleness). Two died of uraemia within a year after ascertainment and two others in hypoglycaemic coma seven and 12 years later. Brittle diabetes was in most cases related to a specific situation, usually unhappiness at home or school. CONCLUSIONS--Brittle diabetes is often episodic and almost always related to stressful life circumstances. Once the underlying cause is removed it tends to improve. Recurrent hypoglycaemic brittleness of psychological origin has a poor prognosis.\r"

The tendency for income levels to be inversely correlated with blood pressure means that those least able to pay for antihypertensive medication are those most susceptible to complications.

A significant correlation of linear least squares fit of the mass ablated as a function of incident energy was found for all lasers used except the Excimer at 193 nm. The 2940-nm Erbium:YAG laser was most efficient in terms of mass of disk ablated per joule in the limited lower range where this wavelength was observed. At higher energy levels, the CO2 laser in the pulsed mode was most efficient. However, the Nd:YAG 1064-nm and 1318-nm lasers are currently best suited for percutaneous laser disk decompression because of the availability of usable waveguides. Carbonization of tissue with the more penetrating Nd:YAG 1064-nm laser increases the efficiency of tissue ablation and makes it comparable to the Nd:YAG 1318-nm laser.\r"

Sutures of chromic catgut and two monofilament absorbable synthetic suture materials (polydioxanone and polyglyconate) were used to close a synovial incision in the knees of sheep. A corticosteroid was applied around the wound resulting in minimal tissue healing when the sutures were retrieved up to six weeks later. The failure load and maximum tensile strength of the retrieved sutures were measured. The mechanical degradation of the materials followed a pattern similar to that in normally healing wounds except that the early fragmentation of chromic gut and polydioxanone occurred far less frequently and neither weakened further after three weeks. Polyglyconate was significantly the strongest material up to three weeks but thereafter continued to weaken. The strength of absorbable sutures was retained longer than in a healing lesion probably because of the absence of the phagocytic cells of an inflammatory tissue.\r"

There was an unusually low incidence of HO in this group of patients. Aspirin treatment was instituted the night before surgery and continued for two weeks, except in 13 patients (7%) who had to stop treatment because of gastrointestinal symptoms. All patients had at least one year of roentgenographic study postoperatively.

Spike amplitude decreased in subsequent NREM epochs, but duration and sharpness remained relatively consistent. A NREM/REM modulatory pattern was identified, with REM periods exhibiting spikes of decreased amplitude, shorter duration, and increased sharpness as compared with NREM periods in each third of the night. The spike changes associated with REM sleep are similar to the alterations previously described as occurring coincidentally with attainment of seizure control and thus may reflect inherent modulation of epileptogenicity in synchrony with sleep cycles.\r"

We evaluated prospectively the usefulness of MRI in 50 patients with late-onset epilepsy in whom a computed tomography (CT) scan was normal (32), did not allow a definitive diagnosis to be made (12), or showed irrelevant lesions (6). Patients were assessed clinically and had an EEG, and CT and MRI scans were reported by one neuroradiologist blinded to clinical and laboratory data. Of the 32 patients with a normal CT scan, MRI was normal in 20, showed irrelevant ischemic lesions in 8, and showed the cause of seizures in 4 patients. Of the 12 patients with nondiagnostic CT, MRI clarified the diagnosis in 5 and was normal in 2 patients. In 6 patients, both scans showed irrelevant ischemic lesions, and in 1 patient MRI showed a relevant additional lesion. The incidence of MRI-detected white matter ischemic lesions was no greater than in an age- and sex-matched group of subjects without seizures. MRI was diagnostic in 32% of the patients with partial seizures and/or focal EEG findings, as compared with 0% of patients without focal features (p less than 0.01). We conclude that MRI is useful in investigation of patients with late-onset epilepsy with focal features.\r"

Mean total seizure frequency per day with PHT and CBZ was 1.33 +/- 0.93 (mean +/- SEM), decreasing to 0.87 +/- 0.71 with addition of FBM, and 0.82 +/- 0.78 after discontinuation of PHT. Only one subject tolerated discontinuation of CBZ; the other three had dosage reductions of 33, 54, and 63%. Toxicity attributable to FBM was not observed, and patients often described less severe seizures. Results from four refractory patients indicated that FBM was able to replace PHT and reduce the need for CBZ. In addition, as PHT dosages were reduced, FBM clearance decreased 21%. As the CBZ dosages were reduced. FBM clearance decreased an additional 16.5%.\r"

They also registered diagnoses and certain other medical measures. Around 85% were judged to be ill to some degree, but few were seriously ill. There were small differences in functional capacity between men and women of different ages: both benign, self-limiting complaints and severe illnesses could be associated with considerable problems, while many patients with severe diseases had little discomfort. There was also a considerable discrepancy between functional impairment and work capacity. Using a combination of functional assessment with routine registration of diagnoses seems to be a useful method of obtaining a modulated, distinct picture of the types of patient encountering the general practitioner. However, further development work within the field is needed.\r"

  ".W": "Measurement of the pulmonary excretion of trace gases has been used as a simple means of assessing metabolic reactions. End alveolar trace gas concentration, rather than excretory rate, is usually measured. However, the reproducibility of this measurement has received little attention. In 17 healthy subjects, duplicate collections of alveolar air were obtained within 1 minute of each other using a commercially available alveolar air sampler. The concentrations of hydrogen, methane, carbon monoxide, and carbon dioxide were measured. When the subject received no instruction on how to expire into the device, a difference of 28% +/- 19% (1SD) was found between duplicate determinations of hydrogen. Instructing the subjects to avoid hyperventilation or to inspire maximally and exhale immediately resulted in only minor reduction in variability. However, a maximal inspiration held for 15 seconds before exhalation reduced the difference to a mean of 9.6% +/- 8.0%, less than half that observed with the other expiratory techniques. Percentage difference of methane measurements with the four different expiratory techniques yielded results comparable to those obtained for hydrogen. In contrast, percentage differences for carbon monoxide measurements were similar for all expiratory techniques. When normalized to a PCO2 of 5%, the variability of hydrogen measurements with the breath-holding technique was reduced to 6.8% +/- 4.7%, a value significantly lower than that obtained with the other expiratory methods. This study suggests that attention to the expiratory technique could improve the accuracy of tests using breath hydrogen measurements.\r"

For a 45-year-old woman with one small stone, treatment with extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy rather than cholecystectomy is projected to result in an average gain of only 3 days of life and an average increase in direct medical charges of $1729 over 5 years of follow-up. The resulting marginal cost-effectiveness of extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy vs. cholecystectomy is $216,000 of extra charges per year of life gained with extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy. Extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy is projected to be much more cost-effective for elderly than for young patients (10-20-fold difference), but considerably less cost-effective for multiple stones than a single stone (2-4-fold difference), and less cost-effective for women than men (twofold difference). Adjusting for effects of morbidity on quality of life, extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy is projected to have slightly better quality-adjusted survival than cholecystectomy for the small subset of patients with one stone (by 8 to 43 days at 5 years) but not for young patients with multiple stones. It is concluded that decisions about appropriate use of extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy should consider the effects of patient characteristics on clinical and economic outcomes.\r"

Damage was quantified after 45 minutes by the blood-to-lumen movement of 51Cr-labeled ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and fluorescein isothiocyanate-tagged bovine serum albumin as well as luminal fluid histamine levels. The amount of titratable acetic acid used to lower the pH of the treatment solutions to pH 4.0 was increased by the addition of calcium gluconate. Luminal acetic acid caused a 19-fold increase in 51Cr-EDTA accumulation over saline controls; casein did not modify this effect. In saline controls, loop fluid histamine levels bordered on the limits of detection (1 ng/g) but were elevated 19-fold by acetic acid exposure and markedly increased (118-fold) by the combination of acid and casein. Intraluminal misoprostol (3 or 30 micrograms/mL), administered 30 minutes before acetic acid, significantly attenuated the increase in epithelial permeability (luminal 51Cr-EDTA, fluorescein isothiocyanate-bovine serum albumin accumulation) and histamine release (P less than 0.05). Diphenhydramine, alone or in combination with cimetidine, and indomethacin (5 mg/kg IV) were not protective. It is concluded that exposure of the epithelium to acetic acid promotes the transepithelial movement of casein leading to enhanced mast cell activation and mucosal injury. Damage to the epithelial barrier can be prevented by misoprostol.\r"

The patient's jaundice did not respond to alterations in his parenteral feeding program or to metronidazole. Ursodeoxycholic acid (600 mg/day) led to a prompt and sustained improvement in his hyperbilirubinemia. When ursodeoxycholic acid was stopped, the patient again became jaundiced, but this resolved with reinstitution of ursodeoxycholic acid. This case suggests that ursodeoxycholic acid may be an effective treatment for home parenteral nutrition--associated cholestasis and should be evaluated further in patients with cholestasis associated with parenteral feeding.\r"

Thirty-four patients with active Crohn's disease completed a 4-week treatment course with an elemental diet. Active disease was characterized by increased intestinal permeability [24-hour urine excretion of orally administered 51Cr-EDTA, 6.4% +/- 0.6% (mean +/- SE); normal, less than 3.0%] and by high fecal excretion of 111In-labeled leukocytes (14.2% +/- 1.1%; normal, less than 1.0%). Twenty-seven (80%) went into clinical remission, usually within a week of starting treatment. After 4 weeks of treatment, there was a significant decrease in both the urine excretion of 51Cr-EDTA (to 3.4% +/- 0.5%; P less than 0.01) and the fecal excretion of 111In (to 5.7% +/- 1.0%; P less than 0.001), indicating that such treatment is not just symptomatic. A framework for the mechanism by which elemental diet works, centering around the importance of the integrity of the intestinal barrier function, is proposed, and also appears to provide a logical explanation for some relapses of the disease.\r"

In many instances, these physicians attempt to bridge gaps between medical and emotional needs and clinical and social services with social and psychotherapeutic as well as biomedical interventions.

We found the following: 1) The basal plasma ANP level was higher in 16-week-old SHR than in Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats (109 +/- 10 [SEM] versus 63 +/- 4 pg/ml, p less than 0.001). Thiorphan (30 mg/kg i.v.) significantly increased plasma ANP by 60% in both SHR and WKY rats. However, increases in urinary sodium excretion (+290% versus +130%, p less than 0.05) and cyclic GMP (+160% versus +60%, p less than 0.05) were greater in SHR than in WKY rats. Urinary excretion of ANP was markedly increased by thiorphan, and its increase was greater in SHR than in WKY rats. 2) The thiorphan-induced natriuresis was substantially attenuated by antiserum for ANP but not by a bradykinin receptor antagonist. 3) Isolated SHR kidneys excreted 50% less sodium than WKY rat kidneys at perfusion pressures of 100 and 160 mm Hg (p less than 0.05). Urinary sodium excretion was increased at the perfusate ANP level of 100 pg/ml, a concentration similar to the SHR plasma ANP (+70% at 160 mm Hg). 4) After bolus administration of ANP to the isolated kidney, the ANP concentration of the recirculating perfusate decreased rapidly in a log-linear fashion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We studied the relation of these two actions of endothelin in anesthetized, bilaterally nephrectomized Sprague-Dawley rats. Infusion of endothelin (25 ng/kg/min) for 45 minutes produced a modest increase in blood pressure of 12% from a baseline of 99 +/- 5 mm Hg and an increase in hematocrit of 8.0 +/- 0.6%, reflecting a reduction in plasma volume of 13.1 +/- 0.9%. These changes each exceeded greatly those observed after 45 minutes of vehicle infusion. Plasma protein concentration, however, increased only by 4.2 +/- 0.6%, suggesting protein extravasation, which was confirmed by finding an endothelin-dependent increase in the accumulation of Evans blue dye in heart, skeletal muscle, and intestine, but not liver, lung, brain, or testis. Endothelin infusion increased plasma immunoreactive ANP concentration from 196 +/- 50 to 722 +/- 203 pg/ml (p less than 0.02), and a close correlation existed between the increase in plasma immunoreactive ANP and immunoreactive endothelin concentrations as a result of the infusion (r = 0.84, p less than 0.01). Pretreatment of rats with rabbit anti-rat ANP antiserum did not affect baseline variables but led to an exaggerated increase in blood pressure (25.3 +/- 2.9%, p less than 0.002 versus endothelin alone). No change in hematocrit occurred. Thus, the increase in plasma immunoreactive ANP concentration resulting from endothelin infusion mediates the increase in hematocrit through an increase in vascular permeability to whole plasma.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Using an initial XAD-2 extraction and preparative high-performance liquid chromatography followed by a batch enzyme affinity extraction and two subsequent semipreparative chromatographic steps, 300 l of human plasma was processed, yielding 31 micrograms (53 nmol) of pure EDLF and representing purification on a dry weight basis in excess of 0.6 billionfold. Four divergent pieces of evidence, including chromatographic, mass spectrometric, immunoreactive, and binding characteristics, suggested that the EDLF purified in the present study was either ouabain or an isomer of ouabain. This material may represent a plasma-borne, naturally occurring, selective, high-affinity ligand for the digitalis binding site that may play a significant role in the modulation of the sodium pump and thereby cellular electrolyte homeostasis in humans.\r"

The accurate mass was determined to be 585.295 Da in a second high-resolution fast atom bombardment mass spectrometric experiment. Based on this accurate mass, the elemental composition of endogenous digitalislike factor was determined and found to be identical to the elemental composition of the known cardenolide ouabain. Direct comparison of ouabain and endogenous digitalislike factor by linked scan tandem mass spectrometry, derivatization with acetic anhydride coupled with fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry, and analytical high-performance liquid chromatography failed to reveal any differences. We conclude that the endogenous digitalislike factor isolated from human plasma is ouabain or a closely related isomer.\r"

Based on the outcome of mass spectral analysis of purified inhibitor, we raised in rabbits antibodies to conjugates of the commercially available cardenolide ouabain and used them in the development of an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for endogenous digitalislike factor (EDLF). Antisera obtained were of high antibody titer (1:2 x 10(6)) and showed full cross-reactivity with purified EDLF. The antisera were highly specific for ouabain and structurally related cardenolides but showed no cross-reactivity with numerous endogenous steroids and peptides. At each step in the purification of EDLF, inhibition of the sodium pump and immunologic cross-reactivity were inseparable. The ELISA as developed had a working range of 5-2,000 fmol, with an IC50 of 80 fmol/well. Using solid-phase extraction and the ELISA, we determined the circulating level of EDLF in plasma from normal human volunteers to be 138 +/- 43 fmol/ml, whereas patients on total parenteral nutrition for at least 1 week had a circulating level of 108 +/- 17 fmol/ml, suggesting that the circulating factor was of endogenous origin. The ELISA developed appears to measure a naturally occurring counterpart to the cardenolides that could play a role in modulating the sodium pump and thereby cellular electrolyte homeostasis.\r"

We found that borderline hypertensive patients compared with controls 1) showed a higher baseline urinary excretion of methoxytyramine, a marker of exocytotic dopamine release, with a greater DOPA-induced decrease of systolic blood pressure without reflex tachycardia; 2) had in response to DOPA a blunted plasma DOPA and free dopamine increase but an accentuated plasma dopamine sulfate and urinary DOPAC excretion; and 3) eliminated comparable quantities of dopamine in urine despite a lower rise in the glomerular DOPA load. Furthermore, although DOPA elicited natriuresis in both groups, its effect was greater in borderline hypertensive patients, who lacked the urinary sodium correlation with urinary dopamine excretion seen in control subjects. These data are compatible with increased basal exocytotic dopamine release and accelerated neuronal and renal (extraneuronal) dopamine generation from administered DOPA in borderline hypertension. The DOPA-induced hypernatriuresis exceeding augmented dopamine in borderline hypertensive patients, contrasting with the urinary sodium and dopamine correlation in control subjects, suggests that DOPA induced an additional natriuresis in borderline hypertensive patients by a decrease in renal sympathetic tone because of its central inhibition of sympathetic outflow, which also may account for the absence of reflex tachycardia.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of melatonin on pulsatile LH secretion was investigated in early follicular phase women (days 2-5). During two consecutive days, at 0800 hrs., subjects received placebo or oral melatonin in a random double-blind fashion. Two doses of melatonin were used; 100 mg single dose (N = 6) or 2.5 mg in three divided doses (N = 5), (1 mg at 0800 hrs., 0.75 mg at 1000 and 1200 hrs.). Blood samples were collected every 10 minutes, between 0900-1700 hrs. Compared with placebo, melatonin administration augmented LH pulse amplitude (p less than 0.01) without changing LH pulse frequency. The integrated LH secretion was significantly increased (p less than 0.01) after melatonin, independent of doses administered. Serum FSH and ovarian steroids were not altered. It is concluded that exogenous melatonin enhances LH pulse amplitude in women, without modifying FSH and ovarian steroid levels.\r"

  ".U": "91258503\r", 
  ".W": "To determine whether short periods of fasting can suppress the activity of the reproductive axis in normal healthy men, eight men were studied on a fed day and again after 48 h of fasting. Subjects were between 20-32 yr of age and ranged from 84-119% of normal body weight. Blood samples were collected on day 1 (a fed day) and day 3 (after 48 h of fasting) at 15-min intervals from 0800-1600 h through indwelling venous catheters. Fasting for 48 h resulted in a significant decrease in mean LH, FSH, and testosterone concentrations. The mean LH concentration decreased from 2.94 +/- 0.59 IU/L on the fed day to 1.07 +/- 0.14 IU/L after 48 h of fasting, and there was an accompanying decrease in LH pulse frequency (from 5.13 +/- 0.29 to 2.63 +/- 0.62 pulses/8 h) and mean baseline LH concentration (from 1.83 +/- 0.52 to 0.51 +/- 0.07 IU/L), but no significant decrease in LH pulse amplitude. In a second study, blood samples were collected from five subjects who were allowed to eat normally between days 1 and 3; these individuals showed no difference in LH secretion. To begin to examine the possibility that an activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis leads to the suppression of reproductive hormone levels that occurred after 48 h of fasting, cortisol levels were measured in all plasma samples. There was no significant difference in mean cortisol concentrations on fed vs. fasted days or when cortisol concentrations were examined as hourly means across the 2 days. These results indicate that activity of the reproductive axis can be suppressed in normal healthy men by 48 h of fasting. It appears unlikely that activation of the adrenal axis is the cause of this suppression of reproductive axis activity.\r"

The minimal dosage of depot leuprolide acetate required, using intervals of 1.5 mg or less when given every 28 days, was determined. This dosage, as determined by suppression of gonadotropin responses to GnRH stimulation, was 4.14 +/- 1.33 mg (mean +/- SD) and 0.15 +/- 0.07 mg/kg.28 days. The dosage correlates with bone age and pubertal stage and is larger among patients with more advanced puberty. Five patients required a larger dosage from 5-10 months after initial suppression. Therefore, to monitor suppression, GnRH testing should be repeated at least at 6-month intervals. Samples 20 and 40 min after GnRH stimulation are sufficient to indicate adequacy of treatment, so an abbreviated test could be used.\r"

  ".W": "Successful establishment of pregnancy is dependent on inhibition of clotting and suppression of the maternal immune response at the feto-maternal interface. Early human placental production of prostacyclin (PGI2) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) may be important in this process. To examine the possible role of these PGs, we studied PGE and 6-keto-PGF1 alpha (stable metabolite of PGI2) synthesis in human placental (9-17 weeks gestation) organ cultures, and monolayer cultures of purified trophoblasts. PGE2 appeared to be the major protanoid formed. Other arachidonic acid metabolites identified in placental organ culture were 6-keto-PGF1 alpha, thromboxane B2, PGF2 alpha, leukotriene B4, 5(S)-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (5-HETE), 12-HETE, and 15-HETE. The synthesis of PGE and 6-keto-PGF1 alpha altered with gestation and was maximal in the younger placentas. Arachidonic acid (33 microM) stimulated and indomethacin (28 microM) inhibited PG production. hCG, including physiological concentrations, stimulated PGE and 6-keto-PGF1 alpha synthesis in placental organ cultures. This effect was most striking in the 9-12 week placentas, compared to 15-17 week placentas. A similar hCG-induced stimulation of PGE production occurred in monolayer cultures of trophoblasts. The addition of TSH, FSH, and LH indicated that this effect was specific for hCG. These data suggest that hCG may have a biological role in the regulation of PG synthesis in early human placenta.\r"

In this placebo-controlled study, sterile saline (eight women) or 24 IU GH (eight women) were given im on alternate days, starting on cycle day 4, in combination with GnRH and human menopausal gonadotropin. IGFBP-1 levels decreased significantly during the first 4 h after GH administration, whereas no significant changes were seen in the placebo group. The concentrations of serum IGF-I and insulin did not change during 4 h after GH injection. During the 11-day follow-up period, serum levels of both IGF-I and insulin were significantly higher in GH-treated than in placebo-treated women. These results suggest that the serum concentration of IGFBP-1 is not completely GH independent. They also support the earlier findings that long term treatment with GH increases serum IGF-I and insulin levels.\r"

  ".W": "Hypothalamic-pituitary function was studied in 45 patients with idiopathic GH deficiency (GHD), 33 of whom had pituitary abnormalities on magnetic resonance imaging: pituitary hypoplasia, undescended stalk and ectopia of the posterior lobe in 8 patients with isolated GHD (IGHD) (group I) and in 12 patients with multiple pituitary hormone deficiency (MPHD) (group II); isolated pituitary hypoplasia in 13 patients with IGHD (group III); no evidence of pituitary abnormalities in the remaining 12 patients with IGHD (group IV). Sellar and pituitary volumes were significantly lower in groups I, II, and III than in group IV (P less than 0.001). No significant differences were observed between group I and group II in the GH response to GHRH1-44 expressed both as peak serum GH and area under the curve. Mean GH peak in group III and IV was significantly higher than that in group I (P less than 0.005) and II (P less than 0.001), as were the mean AUC (P less than 0.005), suggesting hypothalamic defect. Delayed peak serum TSH after TRH was found in all patients of group II, and overt hypothyroidism in 11 of them. Furthermore, basal hyperprolactinemia was present in 6 patients and adrenal insufficiency in 7 cases of group II. Finally, a reduced response of FSH to GnRH was observed in all these patients (P less than 0.005 vs. each of the other groups), and clinical hypogonadism was present in all of them. We suggest that: 1) A high incidence of pituitary abnormalities seems to be present in idiopathic GHD patients; 2) Pituitary hormone deficiencies are more dependent on the type of the hypothalamic-pituitary abnormality than on the size of the pituitary per se: the association of pituitary hypoplasia, undescended stalk and ectopia of the posterior lobe should possibly be considered a distinct entity reflecting an early abnormality in hypothalamic development; 3) The majority of patients with IGHD or MPHD probably have a primary hypothalamic releasing hormone deficiency even if pituitary hypoplasia is associated; 4) Magnetic resonance imaging may have a role in the diagnosis and prognosis of patients with GHD through differentiation between patients who are at risk for developing MPHD vs. those who are candidates for having a persistently isolated GHD.\r"

These had been previously identified using standard methods and included 29 that had given aberrant results. Neisstrip identified correctly all but two, including nine incorrectly identified by Phadebact and 18 erroneously identified using CTA sugars. Results were similar to those obtained with Gonochek II. After this a prospective study was performed testing 400 oxidase positive isolates derived from clinical samples cultured on gonococcal selective medium. Two organisms, both Moraxella spp, were incorrectly identified as N gonorrhoeae by the Neisstrip. The superoxol test, when used with either the Phadebact or Neisstrip tests, maintained 100% sensitivity and specificity. The Neisstrip is a rapid, economic test that is accurate and easy to interpret. It may be used alone or in conjunction with a superoxol test or a coagglutination test, which is relatively accurate but more expensive, and found by some technical staff to be more difficult to interpret.\r"

PBLs from patients with AD demonstrated elevated spontaneous IgE production that was not stimulated further by the addition of recombinant IL-4, whereas for the healthy control subjects, recombinant IL-4 increased spontaneous IgE production by PBLs. INF-gamma that has been previously demonstrated to antagonize the effect of IL-4 on IgE synthesis, decreased IgE production of patients with AD. Addition of Abs to INF-gamma did not change spontaneous IgE production for patients with AD or for healthy control subjects. Together with our observation that IL-4 Abs lowered the high spontaneous IgE production by PBLs from patients with AD, these results suggest that in AD, IL-4 production by lymphocytes, together with a lack of INF-gamma production, is at least partially responsible for the increased spontaneous IgE production.\r"

To determine if cell-mediated immunity is casually related to the pathogenesis of bacterial meningitis, T cell subsets were quantitated from blood of the 29 children with clinical and bacteriologic diagnosis of Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Neisseria meningitidis bacterial meningitis. The CD4+ T cells increased and CD8+ T cells decreased in patients with meningitis as compared to patient control subjects (bacterial infections without meningitis) and normal healthy control subjects. An elevated percentage of CD25+ (interleukin-2 receptors) and HLA-DR+ (immune-response gene-associated antigen) T cells were detected from all patients with meningitis. All 29 patients with meningitis had highly elevated CD4+ CD45R+ (suppressor-inducer) cells and reciprocally depressed CD4+ CDw29+ (helper-inducer) cells compared with healthy age-matched normal and patient control subjects. These findings indicate characteristic immunologic T cell abnormalities from meningitis. The abnormal increase in the CD4+ CD45R+ suppressor-inducer or \"virgin\" cells and expression of activation antigens on T cells may be of help in future understanding of abnormal immune reactions from bacterial meningitis. However, deficiency of the CD4+ CDw29+ helper-inducer or \"memory\" cells may contribute to the impaired helper function for B cell-induced protective antibody synthesis to bacterial capsular polysaccharides found in this disease.\r"

Fifty-seven patients, intubated for control of agitation and combativeness, were divided into high injury severity (HIS) and low injury severity (LIS) subgroups using admission trauma (TS) and injury severity scores (ISS). Thirty-eight (70%) were classified as HIS and 19 (30%) as LIS. All HIS patients had significant injuries diagnosed following paralysis with intubation (PWI). Mortality in the HIS group was 9%. The LIS subgroup was compared to a randomly selected group of similarly injured blunt trauma patients who did not require PWI. There were significant differences (P less than 0.05) in age, hospital cost, hours per day of nursing care, and percent of patients with an ETOH level greater than 100 mg%. Emergency paralysis with intubation is an effective method for controlling the uncooperative, combative, seriously injured patient. However, patients with low injury severity who require restraint have higher costs and require more care if they are paralyzed and intubated than if they are not.\r"

Lack of penetration to necessary locations or rapid metabolism during passage through the epidermis may account for the ineffectiveness. Cytochromes P-450III in the liver are known to be involved in cyclosporine metabolism and inactivation. This study was undertaken to determine if an epidermal cytochrome P-450III exists that can inactivate topical cyclosporine A. Rats were treated with the macrolide antibiotic erythromycin to induce the cytochrome P-450III family of enzymes. Microsomal fractions were prepared from liver and epidermis of rats and from lesional areas of psoriasis patients. NADPH cytochrome C reductase activity was determined as a positive control for microsomal enzymatic activity. Formation of metabolite 1, the predominant metabolite of cyclosporine A, by liver microsomes was increased 193% after 10 d erythromycin treatment. The cytochrome P-450 dependent activity in microsomes from the epidermis of control and erythromycin-treated rats and in microsomes from psoriatic tissue was at the detection limits of the assay system. Cytochrome P-450III gene family mRNA were detectable by polymerase chain reaction in liver but not in psoriatic or normal epidermis. The lack of detectable P-450III mRNA and the absence or minimal conversion of cyclosporine A to inactive metabolites by epidermal microsomes suggest that the ineffectiveness of topical cyclosporine A in psoriasis may not be due to inactivation of cyclosporine A by cytochrome P-450 in the skin.\r"

Flasks were equilibrated with gas mixtures containing 5% CO2 and various partial pressures of oxygen (PO2 7-620 mm Hg) and kept in incubators, which were electronically maintained at the desired oxygen tensions. Melanocytes grew best at PO2 from 6-34 mm Hg. Growth was reduced by 30% at PO2 142 mm Hg, and even more at O2 tensions greater than 230 mm Hg. A PO2 of 603 mm Hg was cytotoxic. Tyrosinase activity (assayed by the method of Pomerantz) was 300 microU/mg protein at PO2 7-34 mm Hg. At PO2 235 and 355 mm Hg tyrosinase activity decreased to about 100 microU/mg protein. The apparent Km for tyrosine was unchanged in melanocytes cultured at all experimental oxygen tensions. The Vmax, however, was decreased at the higher oxygen tensions (PO2 235 mm Hg). At PO2 6-135 mm Hg the melanin content was proportional to tyrosinase activity. At cytostatic oxygen tensions (PO2 235 and 355 mm Hg) the intracellular melanin content increased somewhat, although tyrosinase activity was decreased. Low oxygen tension is favorable for both melanocyte proliferation and tyrosinase activity.\r"

Different marmoset body sites showed a threefold range in follicle area but this did not appear to influence the absorption rates of the test penetrants. However, among the species there was an 80-times range in follicle area, which correlated with the observed differences in rate of mannitol and paraquat absorption. Thus, permeability could be related to inter-species differences in skin structure, but only with the relatively slowly absorbed test penetrants, mannitol and paraquat.\r"

We have investigated whether IFN-gamma influences the constitutive interleukin-1 (IL-1)-like activity in normal rat skin because IL-1 is a regulatory cytokine in immune responses. Rats were injected intradermally into both ears with different doses of rat recombinant IFN-gamma (10(3)-10(5) U), and control animals were given phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The animals were killed at different times and the ears were cut off at the bases. The biologic activity of the IFN-gamma was verified by immunohistochemistry on injected ears, showing a time- and dose-dependent induction of major histocompatibility complex class II antigens on the keratinocytes. Aqueous extracts of homogenized ear skin were tested for IL-1-like activity in a mouse thymocyte bioassay. No major effects of IFN-gamma on the constitutive IL-1-like activity in the rat skin were found; at 6 h there was a slight reduction and at 72 h an increase in IL-1 bioactivity in extracts from IFN-gamma (10(5) U)-injected animals compared with PBS-treated controls (p less than 0.05). We conclude that the regulation of immune responses in the rat skin by IFN-gamma is less likely to be mediated via changes in the IL-1-like activity.\r"

  ".U": "91258882\r", 
  ".W": "Proteoglycans and their component glycosaminoglycans are involved in such cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions as cell adhesion and migration, processes that are essential for embryonic and fetal development. As definitive organs such as skin emerge, structurally different proteoglycans partition into highly defined compartments. In skin, these compartments correspond to morphologically and functionally distinct layers. However, during the normal aging process, the relative amounts of structurally distinct proteoglycans apparently varies independently in each of these layers. This was demonstrated, in an indirect immunocytochemical study, through the use of monoclonal antibodies that detect structurally distinct domains in glycosaminoglycan chains of proteoglycans. Using samples of normal human skin obtained from individuals ranging in age from 20 weeks of gestation to 98 years of age, we determined that a common distribution pattern existed in skin. The epidermis contained chondroitin 4- and keratan sulfates, the basal lamina was the only layer that contained chondroitin 6-sulfate, the papillary and reticular dermis contained principally dermatan sulfate. In addition, antibodies that recognize native domains in chondroitin sulfates identified proteoglycan subsets that partitioned into distinct layers. An important new finding was that the relative amounts of specific types of glycosaminoglycans varied in an age- and layer-dependent manner. In the epidermis there was a notable increase in keratan sulfate beginning at age 50. Chondroitin 6-sulfate, found principally in the basal lamina, decreased after age 60. In the papillary dermis, the amount of dermatan sulfate increased after age 50, whereas the amount of novel chondroitin sulfate epitope, detected by antibody 4C3, decreased with age. Thus, age-related changes in proteoglycan distribution exist and correlate with morphologic and functional changes that occur in the intrinsic process of aging in human skin.\r"

Potential explanations for this phenomena include a patient population that has different prevalence of antibodies, or that the antigen preparations used by the different groups contain different relative amounts of these antigens. We have compared the relative concentration of the different bullous pemphigoid antigens in epidermal extract preparations made by three different procedures commonly used to separate dermis from epidermis: NaCl, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), and heat. We have found that the amount of the 180-kD antigen present in extracts is dependent on the techniques involved in separation of the epidermis from dermis. NaCl- and EDTA-separation procedures result in partial proteolysis of the 180-kD antigen to smaller forms, including major brands at 160 kD and 97 kD in the EDTA preparation. Fragments of the 180-kD antigen are present in both the separation and wash fluids, associated with a significant reduction of the 180-kD form in the extract of the NaCl-separated skin. We conclude that the native molecular weight of the previously described minor bullous pemphigoid antigen is 180 kD, and that the apparent difference in patient reaction to the 180-kD antigen may be due to different preparations of the antigen rather than underlying differences in seropositivity in the patient population.\r"

Because no information is available relating to the effect of amino acids on kidney cell proteolysis, this study was conducted with cultured proximal-like opossum kidney (OK) cells and primary cultured rabbit proximal tubular cells in which long-lived cell proteins were labeled with carbon 14-labeled valine. These cultured cells were acutely deprived of amino acids; this was followed by a 57% to 66% increase in the proteolytic rate in OK cells and a 22% rate increase in the rabbit kidney cells. In cultured OK cells incubated in serum-free minimal essential medium containing 13 amino acids, proteolysis averaged 4.62% +/- 0.28%/2 hr and increased to 7.66% +/- 0.38%/2 hr when amino acids were deleted. Each amino acid was then added alone. Leucine, phenylalanine, and lysine had significant effects in inhibiting the deprivation response by 40%, 26%, and 22%, respectively. Leucine appears to inhibit proteolysis directly and not through its metabolites, since alpha-ketoisocaproate, the leucine transamination product, was without effect. Similarly, failure of tyrosine to inhibit proteolysis suggests a direct phenylalanine action. When leucine, phenylalanine, and lysine were simultaneously deleted from the incubation medium, the increase in proteolysis corresponded to 56% of the response after deletion of all amino acids. Thus to maximally affect proteolysis, amino acids, which on their own have little effect on protein breakdown, also appear to play a role. From this study we conclude that amino acids seem to play an important and direct role in the regulation of kidney epithelial cell protein breakdown.\r"

Right and left atrial areas were measured by two-dimensional echocardiography. Plasma ANF level was sampled simultaneously from the pulmonary artery, aorta, and femoral artery and vein. At 30 minutes into the infusion, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and right atrial pressure increased from 5.6 +/- 2.8 mm Hg (mean +/- SD) and 6.4 +/- 2.2 mm Hg to 10.2 +/- 3.2 and 9.5 +/- 2.2 mm Hg, respectively (both p less than 0.01). Left atrial area increased from 12.6 +/- 2.2 cm2 to 15.0 +/- 2.1 cm2 (p less than 0.05), whereas right atrial area did not change. Plasma ANF levels from all sampling sites increased significantly (e.g., 43 +/- 21 pg/ml to 71 +/- 62 pg/ml in the femoral artery, p less than 0.05). Plasma norepinephrine and renin levels were unchanged, whereas aldosterone level declined significantly. At 30 minutes after termination of the infusion, atrial pressures declined to baseline values in all patients. However, left atrial area remained significantly increased, and a trend for systemic arterial plasma ANF level to remain increased was seen. Plasma aldosterone level remained significantly suppressed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The second study evaluated the same CA regimen with or without cisplatin. Eligibility for the two studies was the same. At last contact, 76 patients were alive. In a multivariate analysis, cell type other than clear cell or mucinous, cisplatin-based treatment, good performance status, younger age, lower stage, clinically nonmeasurable disease, smaller residual tumor volume, and absence of ascites were favorable characteristics for overall survival (P less than .05). Second-look laparotomy was negative significantly more often among those with endometrioid tumors; there were no negative second-look laparotomies among those with mucinous or clear cell tumors. There were 30 patients with suboptimal stage III disease who had a negative second-look laparotomy; 18 (60%) have experienced recurrence, and 13 (43%) have died. Although cisplatin treatment was beneficial, new treatments are clearly needed.\r"

For all the age groups, the coefficient of correlation between these two parameters was high (range: 0.95 to 0.99) and the s.e.e. was low (range 0.76-3.86 ml/min). It was also shown that a linear equation (GFR = 2,602 V120-0,273) could be used to convert the two hour distribution volume into an accurate estimate of two-blood sample GFR whatever the age of the patient. The use of the single-sample technique for measuring GFR in children is therefore recommendable.\r"

Saturation analysis revealed high affinity sites (KH values, 7 x 10(-11) M, 5 x 10(-11) M and 6 x 10(-11) M), with Bmax-H values 209, 36 and 23 fmol/mg protein in the brain, heart and smooth muscle, respectively. High affinity [3H]glyburide binding was pharmacologically specific, insensitive to a variety of receptor-active ligands, but sensitive to a series of sulfonylureas, and good, essentially 1:1, correlations were obtained between binding affinities and literature-derived pharmacologic activities. The K+ channel activators, cromakalim, nicorandil, pinacidil and minoxidil were not effective as inhibitors of [3H]glyburide binding. However, diazoxide was a modestly effective inhibitor. Putative low affinity sites (KL values, 3 x 10(-7) M, 1 x 10(-7) M and 2 x 10(-9) M) with Bmax-L values 4956, 336 and 53 fmol/mg protein in brain, heart and smooth muscle, respectively, were identified. Their significance remains to be established. Except for ATP gamma S, the ability of nucleotide triphosphates to inhibit high affinity [3H] glyburide binding was dependent on the presence of Mg++. ADP, in the presence of Mg++, inhibited binding with an IC50 value of 6.3 x 10(-4) M. Nucleotide monophosphates did not inhibit [3H] glyburide binding in the presence or absence of Mg++, whereas in the presence of Mg++, nucleotide triphosphates were equally potent inhibitors of binding. The rank order potency for nucleotide diphosphate inhibition of binding, in the presence of Mg++, is ADP greater than GDP greater than IDP = UDP. In the absence of Mg++, [3H]glyburide binding shows a biphasic response to ADP, and the inhibition of binding by ADP was prevented by ATP. It is suggested that this biphasic response is the result of a second nucleotide binding site.\r"

CP was given as a single intraperitoneal injection (7.5 mg/kg) 3 days before experiments. In separate groups of rats, the renal response to intravenous infusion of A68828 at 3, 10 or 30 micrograms/kg/min or ANF[1-28] at 0.03, 0.1 or 0.3 micrograms/kg/min for 2 hr was evaluated. Another group of CP-treated rats were infused with the vehicle (0.1% bovine serum albumin in 0.9% NaCl). CP treatment resulted in a marked decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR), arterial pressure, heart rate and reabsorption of water and electrolytes compared to untreated control animals. Infusion of A68828 produced a dose-dependent improvement in the glomerular filtration rate. The highest dose of A68828 produced a nearly 3-fold increase in the glomerular filtration rate, whereas arterial pressure was decreased; heart rate was unchanged. Despite producing a significant diuresis and natriuresis, net tubular reabsorption of water and sodium was also increased. Similar dose-dependent effects were observed with the native peptide, ANF[1-28]. These data indicate that infusion of the reduced-sized analog of ANF, A68828, can significantly improve glomerular and tubular function in rats with acute renal failure induced by CP.\r"

  ".U": "91259453\r", 
  ".W": "Recent clinical evidence indicates a potential for skeletal muscle toxicity after therapy with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (HMGRIs) in man. Although the incidence of drug-induced skeletal muscle toxicity is very low (0.1-0.2%) with monotherapy, it may increase following concomitant drug therapy with the immunosuppressant, cyclosporine A (CsA), and possibly with certain other hypolipidemic agents. In the Sprague-Dawley rat, very high, pharmacologically comparable dosages (150-1200 mg/kg/day) of structurally similar HMGRIs (lovastatin, simvastatin, pravastatin and L-647, 318) produced dose-related increases in the incidence and severity of skeletal muscle degeneration. Physical signs included inappetence, decreased activity, loss of body weight, localized alopecia and mortality. To evaluate the interaction between HMGRIs and CsA, a rat model of CsA-induced cholestasis was developed. In this 2-week model, the skeletal muscle toxicity of the HMGRIs was clearly potentiated by CsA (10 mg/kg/day). Doses of HMGRIs which did not produce skeletal muscle toxicity when given alone caused between 75 and 100% incidence of myopathy (very slight to marked skeletal muscle degeneration) when CsA was coadministered. Typical light microscopic changes included myofiber necrosis with interstitial edema and inflammatory infiltration in areas of acute injury. Histochemical characterization of the muscle lesion indicated that type 2B fibers (primarily glycolytic white fibers) were most sensitive to this toxicity but that, with prolonged administration, all fiber types were ultimately affected. Results of pharmacokinetic studies in rats treated with various HMGRIs +/- CsA indicated that coadministration of CsA alters the disposition of these compounds, resulting in increased systemic exposure (e.g., increased area under the plasma drug concentration vs. time curve-AUC) and consequent (up to 13-fold) increases in skeletal muscle drug levels. Evaluation of the potential interaction between the HMGRI, lovastatin and CsA at the level of hepatic microsomal metabolism indicated that CsA did not inhibit the metabolism of lovastatin in isolated microsomes from female rats. In light of the above findings, it appears that HMGRI-induced myopathy is a class effect in the rat, which is potentiated by CsA as the result of altered clearance and resultant increased tissue exposure. Cholestasis associated with CsA and HMGRIs may form the basis for decreased elimination and the resultant elevated systemic exposure. Furthermore, this toxicity is muscle fiber-selective and may be associated with impaired skeletal muscle energy metabolism.\r"

L651582 was tested for its ability to block receptor-stimulated calcium influx, arachidonic acid release, inositol phosphate and cyclic AMP (cAMP) generation. These signal transduction pathways are activated by muscarinic receptors transfected and expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells. L651582 blocked muscarinic m5 receptor-stimulated 45Ca++ influx and release of arachidonic acid at low micromolar concentrations. Muscarinic receptor-stimulated release of arachidonic acid was shown previously to be dependent on calcium influx and not intracellular calcium release suggesting L651582 may be useful as calcium channel blocker. At low micromolar concentrations, L651582 had little effect on muscarinic m5 receptor-stimulated release of inositol phosphates or cAMP accumulation. Moreover, L651582 had little effect on muscarinic m2 receptor-mediated inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation. Above 10 microM, L651582 inhibited all second messenger pathways tested and inhibited cell growth, suggesting its action may be less specific and toxic at these concentrations.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of probenecid on the pharmacokinetics of 2',3'-dideoxyinosine (ddl) and on the distribution of ddl to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and brain tissue were determined in rats during and after a 2-hr i.v. infusion of ddl, 125 mg/kg/hr. Probenecid-treated rats received a loading dose of probenecid followed by an i.v. infusion of probenecid initiated 1 hr before and continued during and for 2 hr after termination of the ddl infusion. Plasma concentrations of probenecid averaged 221 +/- 34 micrograms/ml upon termination of the ddl infusion and 258 +/- 34 micrograms/ml (mean +/- S.D., n = 4) 1 hr later. In the probenecid-treated animals, ddl concentrations were higher in plasma (1.5-fold), brain (1.5-fold) and CSF (5.4-fold) at the termination of the ddl infusion and postinfusion concentrations declined more slowly compared to controls. Postinfusion, the CSF/plasma and brain/plasma ratios steadily increased to a greater extent in the probenecid-treated rats compared to control animals. The time course of plasma, CSF and brain tissue concentrations were analyzed by nonlinear least-squares regression using two different compartmental models, one which neglected the direct exchange of drug between the CSF and brain parenchyma, whereas the other allowed for such exchange to occur and neglected direct vascular transfer of drug to brain tissue. Allowing exchange between the CSF and brain tissue gave slightly improved fitting of the data from both probenecid-treated and control rats.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "91259468\r", 
  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to investigate the possibility that arachidonic acid metabolites mediate D-2 dopamine (DA) receptor inhibition of striatal DA release. The phospholipase A2 inhibitor p-bromophenacyl bromide (BPB; 10 microM) increased electrically evoked overflow of endogenous DA from rat striatal slices and appeared to partially block the modulatory effects of the D-2 DA receptor agonist N-0437 on this release. However, BPB also increased spontaneous DA outflow in a dose-dependent manner. U-73122 (10 microM), another phospholipase A2 inhibitor, decreased evoked overflow of DA, did not affect the action of N-0437 but also increased spontaneous outflow of DA. In contrast, arachidonic acid (30 microM) produced no effects. In slices prelabeled with [3H]DA, exposure to BPB, U-73122 and nordihydroguaiaretic acid (a lipoxygenase inhibitor) significantly increased spontaneous outflow of tritium whereas the cyclooxygenase inhibitors aspirin and indomethacin did not. In low micromolar concentrations, BPB, U-73122 and nordihydroguaiaretic acid, but not aspirin and indomethacin, inhibited uptake of [3H]DA into striatal synaptosomes and binding of [3H]mazindol to the DA transporter. Only U-73122 affected D-2 DA receptor binding. Taken together, these results suggest that it is unlikely that arachidonic acid metabolites mediate the actions of release-modulating D-2 DA autoreceptors in the striatum. However, the results also suggest that certain inhibitors of arachidonic acid metabolism are relatively potent DA uptake blockers/releasers and that this action is unrelated to their inhibition of enzymes in the arachidonic acid cascade. Caution should be used when using BPB and nordihydroguaiaretic acid to study mechanisms involved in DA release, because these compounds may increase DA release and thereby appear to antagonize the effects of activation of presynaptic receptors.\r"

  ".W": "Nationwide surveillance of Rh hemolytic disease of the newborn (RhHDN) indicates that, after a substantial decline in incidence, reported rates reached a plateau in the late 1970s. We conducted a study designed to validate RhHDN surveillance data, to obtain corrected incidence estimates, and to identify potential reasons for the reported plateau. We obtained data from the Birth Defects Monitoring Program, a national surveillance system that collects data from public and private hospitals participating voluntarily. We asked hospitals for copies of the medical records for all infants discharged with a code for RhHDN and for a sample of the medical records of infants discharged with a code for other and unspecified hemolytic disease during 1986. The estimated incidence rate of RhHDN was 10.6 per 10,000 total births, with some regional variations. Our findings indicate that, despite the availability of an effective preventive measure, RhHDN continues to contribute significantly to infant morbidity and mortality in the United States.\r"

One of the critical components of that response is medical curriculum reform, with the intent to graduate adequate numbers of physicians to do primary care, to work with the underinsured and the uninsured, and to practice in rural areas. One state, Minnesota, has developed a unique response to these needs, demonstrating problem solving very much in keeping with many of the recommendations in the literature. Highlighted in this article is the University of Minnesota's Rural Physician Associate Program, a predoctoral curriculum innovation functioning for 20 years to help resolve the issue of physician maldistribution in the state. The Rural Physician Associate Program provides students with many of the skills needed to provide primary care, it is cost-effective, and it has brought a number of benefits to the participating communities.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE.--To determine the necessary length of stay for patients admitted to the hospital with an exacerbation of chronic pulmonary disease and to compare this with the length of stay assigned by the diagnosis related group system. DESIGN.--A cohort of patients were followed up prospectively after hospital admission to determine when complications, critical incidents, and the need for monitoring occurred. The medically derived necessary lengths of stay were statistically compared with the lengths of stay assigned by the diagnosis related group. Clinical factors were used to predict long vs short necessary lengths of stay. SETTING.--Two acute care hospitals: one was the principal and the other a major community teaching hospital. PATIENTS.--A consecutive sample of 83 patients who were 45 years of age or older and who required admission for treatment of chronic pulmonary disease. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES.--The occurrence and time of complications, critical interventions, and monitoring. RESULTS.--After 6 days in the hospital, 90% of patients were free of complications or the need for monitoring. However, 16 days elapsed before 90% of patients had been discharged from the hospital. The length of stay that was considered necessary for care averaged 6.9 days; the actual mean length of stay was 8.7 days. The correlation between each patient's ideal length of stay and the length of stay assigned by the diagnosis related group was low and was not statistically significant. Three clinical variables at the time of admission (high PCO2 levels, symptoms that were present for more than 1 day, and antibiotic treatment) were associated with the need for longer hospital stays. CONCLUSIONS.--The medically required length of stay for patients with an exacerbation of chronic pulmonary disease was between 6 and 7 days, on average. This length of stay, which was based on clinical events, differs from the length of stay that was calculated as a statistical norm by the diagnosis related group system. Clinical characteristics may help to identify patients who require a longer length of stay.\r"

  ".U": "91260071\r", 
  ".W": "A reduced thyrotropin (TSH) response to thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) has been reported in subjects with a history of alcoholism whereas prolactin (PRL) responses have generally been normal. One hypothesis proposed to explain the reduced TSH response is down-regulation of pituitary TRH receptors. If this is correct, PRL response should also be diminished. To account for the different dose-response characteristics of TSH/PRL we have given four dosages of TRH (25, 100, 500 and 800 micrograms) to eight noncirrhotic, male alcoholics abstinent from ethanol a minimum of 28 days and to seven male control subjects. Across the TRH dose range the alcoholic subjects exhibited reduced basal TSH (p = .01) and a reduced TSH response (p = .0023) but no differences in basal and stimulated PRL levels. Alcoholic subjects had higher basal T4, T3 and FT4I values than did control subjects but covarying for T4, T3 and FT4I did not change the significance of either TSH or PRL findings. No significant differences in estradiol, estrone, testosterone, cortisol or glucose were noted between groups. The present study confirms the observation of a lower TSH response to TRH in abstinent alcoholics and indicates that the lower response cannot be overcome by increasing TRH dosage. The similar PRL response between groups suggests normal lactotroph function in noncirrhotic abstinent alcoholics and argues against the pituitary TRH receptor down-regulation hypothesis.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the frequency and significance of antibody to hepatitis C virus (anti-HCV) in severe autoimmune chronic active hepatitis, we tested sera from 85 cortico-steroid-treated patients by an enzyme immunoassay. Seropositive patients were assessed for specific antibodies to hepatitis C virus-encoded antigens by recombinant immunoblot assay. The findings in patients with and without anti-HCV were contrasted, and the frequency of seropositivity was compared with that in patients who had other types of chronic liver disease and in normal adults. Only 5 of the 85 patients with autoimmune hepatitis (6%) were seropositive for anti-HCV, and only 2 of these patients were reactive by recombinant immunoblot assay. The frequency of seropositivity in autoimmune hepatitis was not significantly different from that in hepatitis B surface antigen-positive (9%) and cryptogenic (18%) disease, but it was significantly less than that in posttransfusion chronic active hepatitis (6% versus 75%; P less than 0.001). Two patients became seronegative after corticosteroid therapy; both had been nonreactive by recombinant immunoblot assay. Four of the seropositive patients entered remission during corticosteroid therapy, including three whose sera were nonreactive to virus-encoded antigens. We conclude that anti-HCV occurs infrequently in corticosteroid-treated severe autoimmune hepatitis and that antibodies detected by enzyme immunoassay may be nonreactive to hepatitis C virus-encoded antigens. Seropositive patients who are nonreactive by immunoblot assay may still respond to corticosteroid therapy and become seronegative during treatment.\r"
