Validity was assessed by comparing predictions of mortality risk produced by each HRA to estimates from the Framingham Heart Study and the Risk Factor Update Project. Correlations with both epidemiologic estimates indicated that instruments employing logistic regression or the Geller/Gesner methodology had the highest validity coefficients, while validity was lowest for self-administered general health status and lifestyle questionnaires. However, most instruments using the Geller/Gesner technique appear to systematically overestimate the probability of CHD mortality. For HRAs based on additive risk scales, validity was often attenuated by the crude categorization of some risk factors and by the omission of the effects of age from the scoring system.\r"

  ".W": "We calculated the long-term risks of death from smoking for individuals of various ages and smoking status in terms of the excess mortality contributed by smoking, over and above the baseline mortality from the same diseases caused by factors other than smoking using standard life table procedures. Since mortality data for specific smoking categories were available only from prospective studies in the late 1950s, we scaled these to the 1982 mortality levels. We assumed, for lung cancer, that the death rates for nonsmokers have not changed and, for other smoking-related diseases, that the risks of death for smokers relative to those for nonsmokers have not changed since the 1950s. Probabilities that result from alternative assumptions were also investigated and are presented. As many as one-third of heavy smokers age 35 will die before age 85 of diseases caused by their smoking. The probabilities of death from smoking when compared with other causes may be persuasive as public education tools. Their effective use for this purpose is affected not only by the deficiencies in the public's factual knowledge of the magnitude of the risks from smoking, but also by numerous apparent misconceptions relating to the interpretation of risk information. Risk data should be presented to the public in a manner that clarifies these misconceptions and facilitates their understanding of the overwhelming risk imposed by smoking.\r"

  ".W": "An outbreak of measles occurred in a high school with a documented vaccination level of 98 per cent. Nineteen (70 per cent) of the cases were students who had histories of measles vaccination at 12 months of age or older and are therefore considered vaccine failures. Persons who were unimmunized or immunized at less than 12 months of age had substantially higher attack rates compared to those immunized on or after 12 months of age. Vaccine failures among apparently adequately vaccinated individuals were sources of infection for at least 48 per cent of the cases in the outbreak. There was no evidence to suggest that waning immunity was a contributing factor among the vaccine failures. Close contact with cases of measles in the high school, source or provider of vaccine, sharing common activities or classes with cases, and verification of the vaccination history were not significant risk factors in the outbreak. The outbreak subsided spontaneously after four generations of illness in the school and demonstrates that when measles is introduced in a highly vaccinated population, vaccine failures may play some role in transmission but that such transmission is not usually sustained.\r"

  ".U": "87154066\r", 
  ".W": "Over the last decade there has been a marked increase in information on the epidemiology of psychiatric disorders, particularly major depression, in adults living in the community and in families. The ability to conduct large epidemiologic studies of psychiatric disorders is due to improvements in diagnostic precision and reliability in psychiatry and to the development of systematic methods for collecting information on signs and symptoms to make diagnoses. Results from a recently completed epidemiologic survey of psychiatric disorders in five urban communities in the United States and from several large-scale family genetic studies suggest that major depression is a highly prevalent disorder. It occurs in adults and children, and there is evidence for an increased rate in younger people. The average age of first onset is in young adulthood. Most depressions are untreated. The firm risk factors for major depression include being female; young (born after World War II); separated/divorced or in an unhappy marriage; and having a family history of major depression. There is a two-to-threefold increased risk for major depression if there is a family history of the disorder. The relevance of these findings to clinical practice and public health is discussed.\r"

There were slightly fewer cases of NGU than GCU. A case-control study of active duty soldiers showed that both Black and White circumcised subjects were 1.65 times as likely to have NGU as uncircumcised subjects (95% CI: 1.37-2.00).

Unfortunately, no valid and practical measurement system is available that will allow assessment of leisure time physical activity participation of large populations. Consequently, not only is it difficult to assess progress toward the 1990 goal, an accurate baseline from which to measure potential progress does not exist. This paper presents a time diary technique for measuring aggregate population physical activity participation and utilizes actual time diaries collected from adults by the Institute for Social Research in 1981 to arrive at a possible baseline. The results indicated that time diaries are a viable method for assessing aggregate physical activity behavior of large populations. American Adults were quite sedentary in 1981. Over a period of one week, 31% undertook no leisure time physical activity. Only 14 per cent expended more than 1600 kcals/week in leisure time physical activity, and 10 per cent met the DHHS physical activity requirements.\r"

After sex, age, income, education, residence (urban vs rural), and disease site and stage had been controlled, those who made copayments were found to have waited an average of 1.25 months longer (95 per cent confidence limit (cl) +/- .88) between initial suspicion of illness and obtaining a definitive diagnosis than those with full insurance coverage. Time from diagnosis until the beginning of treatment averaged .83 months longer (95 per cent cl +/- .41) for HMO members than those in fee-for-service.

The occurrence of incidental appendectomy exceeded that of appendicitis treated by appendectomy, with population-based rates of 1.13/1,000 and 0.97/1,000 person-years, respectively. Over 64 per cent of appendicitis cases occurred in persons under 25 years of age while 74 per cent of incidental appendectomies occurred in persons age 25 and over. Extrapolating to the nation, the data suggest that 254,250 incidental appendectomies might prevent 3,382 future cases of hospitalized appendicitis. The cost of the prevented cases is estimated as $6,764,000. The cost of the incidental appendectomies would be $20,340,000 if as many as 10 per cent of surgeons' fees were separately charged and twice as much if twice as many were so charged.

Eleven HBV exposures were observed and those exposed were given hepatitis B immune globulin. After 3.5 years, no remaining staff showed serological evidence of HBV infection but three of 61 susceptible students did so. The three students probably acquired the infection outside the school. At the conclusion of the project, one school located in the community decided not to institute a vaccine program for students or staff. The other school, located inside the mental retardation institution, established an organized vaccine initiative. Indications for use of hepatitis vaccine in schools should be individualized to accommodate for differences in student and staff interaction, physical design of the school, and number and behaviors of HBsAg carrier students.\r"

Intravenous inoculations of L. donovani promastigotes produced visceral infections characterized by a continuing increase in splenic parasite burdens and liver parasite burdens which peaked during the first few weeks of infection and gradually decreased as the disease became chronic. L. donovani could be isolated from the blood throughout the infection, and promastigotes were cultured from the spleens of rats inoculated intradermally. Thus, the multimammate rat appears to be a good reservoir host for these parasites.\r"

This study confirms and extends our preliminary results on the high specificity of some of these monoclonals for the L. braziliensis, L. mexicana, and L. donovani complexes. This study also demonstrates the relative stability of these molecular markers and the general usefulness of the method for parasite identification. Two hundred ninety-two of 420 isolates of ACL were classified as members of the L. braziliensis complex. Two hundred twenty-seven were L. b. braziliensis; these showed the widest geographical distribution (Brazil: Amazonas, Bahia, Ceara, Espirito Santo, Goias, Minas Gerais, Para, Paraiba, Rio de Janeiro, and Sao Paulo; Honduras: Santa Barbara and Yoko; Peru: Ancash, Piura, and Ucayali; and Venezuela: Cojedes, Distrito Federal, Lara, Portuguesa, Vale Hondo, Yaracuy, and Zulia). Forty-one stocks were identified as L. b. guyanensis (from North Brazil: Amazonas, Amapa, Para, and Rondonia). Twenty-one stocks were identified as L. b. panamensis (from Costa Rica: Alajuela, Guanacasten, Limon, Puntarenas, and San Jose; and Honduras: El Paraiso, and Olancho). Out of 128 isolates classified as members of the L. mexicana complex, 74 were differentiated as L. m. amazonensis (from Bolivia; Brazil: Amazonas, Bahia, Ceara, Goias, Maranhao, Mato Grosso do Norte, and Para; Peru: Pasco Forest and Van Humboldt; and Venezuela: Carabobo, Guarico, and Merida). Forty-four stocks were identified as L. m. venezuelensis (from Venezuela: Lara). Six stocks were L. m. mexicana (from Belize; and Mexico: Campeche [corrected] and Quintana Roo, Yucatan). One hundred ten isolates from AVL were identified as L. donovani chagasi (from Brazil: Bahia, Ceara, Maranhao, Minas Gerais, Mato Grosso do Sul, Piaui, Rio de Janeiro, and Sergipe; and Honduras: Valle). The implications of these results with respect to both the clinical and epidemiological data (including the detection of seven unusual characterized stocks) are discussed.\r"

  ".U": "87154109\r", 
  ".W": "Amino acid esters can destroy intracellular as well as isolated amastigotes of Leishmania mexicana amazonensis. In the present study we examined, using a tetrazolium reduction assay, the toxicity of the esters for amastigotes isolated from mouse lesions. Parasite killing by the \"prototype\" compound L-leucine methyl ester at 1 mM concentration and at pH 7.3 took place within 15-30 min. Time-lapse cinematographic observations showed that the amastigotes rounded up and became less phase-dense before they rapidly broke down. Ammonium chloride, ethylamine or monensin, known to raise the intracellular pH, reduced the sensitivity of the amastigotes to L-Leu-OMe. This finding suggests that an acidified compartment is involved in the destruction of the parasites. The leishmanicidal activity of a series of L-amino acid esters was also investigated. The ED50 (concentration for half maximal effect) for methyl esters was (in mM): Leu (0.62), Trp (0.96), Met (1.13), Glu (2.0), Phe (2.5), and Tyr (3.8). In contrast, the methyl esters of Ile, Val, Ala, beta Ala, Gly, Ser, His, and Pro were either inactive or weakly active at 15 mM. Benzyl esters were more active than their methyl homologs: the ED50 of the benzyl esters of Leu, Val, Ile, Gly, Ala, beta Ala, and Pro were, respectively, 0.07, 0.20, 0.22, 0.88, 1.5, 2.3, and 6.7 mM. Ranks of leishmanicidal activity may reflect differences in the rates of ester uptake and trapping by the amastigotes, in the specificity of the relevant hydrolytic enzyme(s), in the accumulation and metabolic fate of the released amino acids, or in the toxicity of the amino acid or alcohol released within the amastigotes.\r"

  ".U": "87154110\r", 
  ".W": "The life cycle of Leishmania mexicana mexicana in the gut of the sand fly, Lutzomyia abonnenci, was studied by light and electron microscopy. Development was suprapylarian with initial establishment of parasites in the bloodmeal (posterior midgut), and anterior migration of parasites to the cardia/stomodeal valve region beginning at 2.5 days post-infection. Flagellates were first observed in the esophagus at 3.5 days, in the posterior armature region of the pharynx at 5 days, and in the anterior pharynx at 7 days; but they were not detected in the cibarium or proboscis. Infection of the pylorus region of the hindgut and of the Malpighian tubules was also commonly observed. Three different morphological forms of L. m. mexicana developed in the gut: nectomonad promastigotes, short promastigotes, and paramastigotes. Nectomonads occurred primarily in the abdominal midgut after bloodmeal digestion, where they were oriented in longitudinal masses in the lumen, or interdigitated with epithelial microvilli via the flagellum. Short promastigotes found in the cardia/stomodeal valve region are described for the first time. These forms were smaller than nectomonads, showed an amplification of the kinetoplast, apposition of kinetoplast and nucleus, and were embedded in a gel-like matrix. To maintain position in the cardia, parasites commonly inserted the flagellum deep into microvilli or cytoplasm of the epithelium; adherence to the cuticular intima of the stomodeal valve was by flagellar modification and formation of hemidesmosome plaques. Paramastigotes occurred in the esophagus, were sometimes degenerated in appearance, and were attached via flagellar hemidesmosomes. Paramastigotes observed in the lumen of the pharynx were commonly degenerated and were not attached to the intima. L. m. mexicana was able to colonize the various gut habitats of Lu. abonnenci by a number of adaptations; this sand fly appears to be a suitable biological host for the parasite.\r"

However, none of 109 GDP-negative Japanese males without invasive amebiasis were positive on these serologic tests for syphilis. At least 2 bisexuals and 4 homosexuals were among those with invasive amebiasis. All of these biased males were positive on both TPHA and nontreponemal antigen tests. Four of the biased males had liver abscess and 2 had amebic dysentery or colitis. Bisexual or homosexual males were not found in the negative GDP group. These observations suggest that sexually transmitted amebiasis due to Entamoeba histolytica occurs among sexually biased males in Japan.\r"

Oocysts were identified in stools from 17.5% of 291 children seen at a rural dispensary and in 16.3% of stools from 533 children in an urban hospital. Children with cryptosporidiosis were identified throughout a 22-month period from October 1982 to July 1984, without seasonal predilection. Cryptosporidiosis was twice as common in infants greater than 6 months of age than in younger infants. Cryptosporidium oocysts were rarely found in stools of infants receiving only breast milk. The clinical presentation of children with cryptosporidiosis was similar to other patients with diarrhea who did not have cryptosporidiosis. No asymptomatic Cryptosporidium infections were detected among 71 family members of 31 children with cryptosporidiosis. Three of the 71 family members less than 3 years of age were found to have diarrhea and Cryptosporidium oocysts. In follow-up studies of 31 patients, oocysts persisted in stools for a mean of 14 days (range 5-31 days). Duration of oocyst excretion was directly correlated with duration of diarrhea. These findings suggest that Cryptosporidium is an important cause of acute self-limited diarrheal illness to Haitian children.\r"

Serial stool specimens were obtained from 8 infected individuals (5 children and 3 adults). Duration of oocyst shedding ranged from 8 to more than 50 days and continued in 5 individuals after diarrhea ceased. No relationship was found between duration of oocyst shedding and the age of the patient or duration or severity of diarrhea. Results of the investigation indicate that infected individuals may continue to excrete oocysts and, therefore, may remain infectious for days or weeks after gastrointestinal symptoms disappear.\r"

Result, together with those reported previously for 8 other strains (S. japonicum, China, Formosa, Japan, Philippines; S. mekongi, 2 substrains; Malaysian schistosome, 2 strains) permit a composite genetic characterization of 15 strains of Asian schistosomes at 9-18 presumptive loci. The proportion of polymorphic loci (P) and the mean heterozygosity per locus (H) were zero in all strains. Although this was expected for strains that had been in laboratory culture for up to 50 years, we expected to detect variation in strains based on 10-50 recently field-collected infected snails. We expected S. japonicum to be as variable as S. mansoni (P = 0.13 (0-0.33), H = 0.04, 18 loci, 22 strains) as it is believed to reproduce sexually, has an evolutionary history of several million years, inhabits a wide geographic range, coevolved with a genetically variable intermediate snail host, and has a diversity of mammalian hosts. No differences were detected between the 5 S. japonicum strains from Leyte and Luzon (Philippines), between the 3 S. mekongi strains, or between the 3 Malaysian schistosome strains; these groups and the remaining S. japonicum strains representing Mindoro (Philippines), China, Formosa, and Japan each have distinctive multilocus electromorphic patterns. Nei's genetic distances (D) were calculated to estimate interstrain and interspecific divergence. Interstrain genetic distances in S. japonicum averaged greater than 0.3; much higher than those reported previously for S. mansoni (D = 0.06, D(max) = 0.24). S. japonicum (Mindoro) was moderately differentiated from the Leyte-Luzon strains (D = 0.29, 12 loci). Estimates of the S. japonicum China-Philippine distance (D greater than 0.4, 11 loci) are high for conspecific populations and further studies of the still poorly characterized Chinese parasite may reveal that these are, in fact, separate species. S. japonicum is shown to be only distantly related to S. mekongi and the Malaysian schistosome (D greater than 1); the latter is closely related to, but genetically quite distinct from, S. mekongi (D = 0.61 +/- 0.275, 11 loci) and warrants recognition as a new species. The medical significance of the isogenic nature of the Asian schistosome strains and their evolutionary divergence are discussed.\r"

At least 87% of the total phosphorus originally present was comprised of 2-aminoethylphosphonic acid. During 11 days of embryonic development, alkylphosphonate-phosphorus decreased from 98% to 50% of the total phosphorus, indicating a possible role for phosphonate-phosphorus in the embryonic nutrition of these snails. Considering the relative uniqueness of the alkylphosphonates in nature, the very high concentration of these compounds in freshly laid eggs, and the reduction in their amount during embryonic development, the anabolic and catabolic pathways of alkylphosphonates may serve as sites for highly specific analogues in the control of these schistosomal vectors.\r"

Of 202 skin biopsies, 189 (94%) were positive for microfilariae of Onchocerca volvulus. Nodules were most common around the pelvic girdle and rare on the limbs or head. Microfilarial intensities, ranging up to 1,094 mf/mg of skin, were highest at the iliac crest and shoulder; they increased rapidly in childhood but then appeared to reach a plateau maintained through adult life. Nodule presence and number, especially at multiple sites, was significantly related to skin microfilarial intensity. Dermal manifestations of O. volvulus infection were widespread and severe, ranging from acute maculopapular eruptions to chronic, diffuse, and degenerative changes, even in young adults. However, high skin microfilarial intensities were found in asymptomatic individuals; conversely, lowest intensities were in those with severest maculopapular lesions, suggesting that host response was a major determinant of disease outcome. Microfilariae were detected in the cornea or anterior chamber of the eyes of one third of those examined in all age groups, but lesions of the posterior segment, including optic neuritis, chorioretinitis, and pigmentary abnormalities, were considered responsible for visual deficits in the population sample. Some pathologic changes in the anterior segment attributable to microfilariae were more common in the young than in adults but there was no preponderance of sclerosing keratitis in adults, contrary to expectations in hyperexposed individuals in a Sudan savannah zone. The best correlate of the presence of microfilariae in the eye was the intensity of infection in shoulder skin snips. Little value could be derived from data on outer canthus samples, either in terms of severity of ocular infection or disease. Microfilaremia was common (76%) but in only one case was attributed to O. volvulus; the remainder were due to Mansonella perstans.\r"

On days 21 or 28 after infection (AI) larval I. dammini were fed on the deer mice. Each of the P. maniculatus developed antibodies (up to 7 log2) to B. burgdorferi and B. burgdorferi was isolated from the blood of 1 deer mouse on day 51 AI. Nymphs resulting from these larvae were then allowed to feed on 10 uninfected P. maniculatus. All 10 of these tick-infected P. maniculatus developed antibodies (up to 7 log2) to B. burgdorferi, and B. burgdorferi was isolated from the blood of 1 of the 10 P. maniculatus 15 days after tick feeding and from the pooled organs of another of the tick-infected P. maniculatus. Six of the orally infected P. maniculatus developed clinical signs including ruffled hair coat, inappetence, reluctance to move, and lameness in the rear legs. All P. maniculatus tissues were grossly and histologically normal on necropsy.

Testing for the presence of a coagulation inhibitor revealed a pattern consistent with factor deficiency. Fibrin thrombi were not found at necropsy. The findings of high fibrin-fibrinogen degradation product levels and decreased antithrombin III levels, in association with decreased activity of multiple coagulation factors and thrombocytopenia, suggest that intravascular coagulation is a feature of this experimental infection. The demonstration of abnormal platelet function is also significant, as this could contribute to defective hemostasis despite the moderate thrombocytopenia which usually occurs in arenaviral disease.\r"

The vaccine strain was selected by cloning virus that produced only small plaques in vitro and showed reduced replication at high temperatures (temperature sensitivity). Although other candidate live dengue virus vaccines selected for similar growth characteristics have been attenuated for humans, two recipients of the 45AZ5 virus developed unmodified acute dengue fever. Viremia was observed within 24 hr of inoculation and lasted 12 to 19 days. Virus isolates from the blood produced large plaques in cell culture and showed diminished temperature sensitivity. The 45AZ5 virus is unacceptable as a vaccine candidate. This experience points out the uncertain relationship between in vitro viral growth characteristics and virulence factors for humans.\r"

  ".W": "Although proximal gastric vagotomy is widely performed as an elective treatment for duodenal ulcer, the incidence of recurrent ulcer is troublesome. There are several theories to explain recurrent ulcers, and important technical steps should be considered when performing proximal gastric vagotomy. The use of an intraoperative test may allow more accurate performance of the operation and more complete vagotomy of the parietal cell mass. This report describes the use of the endoscopic Congo red test in patients during proximal gastric vagotomy. The test allows rapid and accurate mapping of areas of the stomach with intact vagus and secretory nerves after operative vagotomy, and can be repeated several times if necessary to verify completion of the vagotomy. The use of universally available equipment and the potential for intraoperative and postoperative use are other attractive features of the test. Use of the endoscopic Congo red test provides physiologic evidence that vagus secretory nerve fibers traverse the right and left gastroepiploic nerves, leading us to believe that the gastroepiploic nerves should be routinely divided during proximal gastric vagotomy. In patients with recurrent duodenal ulcer requiring reoperation, the endoscopic Congo red test allows preoperative demonstration of the site of the intact vagal nerve trunks. The endoscopic Congo red test deserves further investigation and wider application during operations for chronic duodenal ulcer.\r"

Fewer than 25 percent of the patients weighed less than 50 percent above ideal body weight at 2 or 3 years. In our experience, horizontal gastroplasty was associated with an unacceptably high mechanical failure rate. Using strict criteria, weight loss was generally inadequate at 2 years and not sustained, even in patients with intact gastroplasty.\r"

In 16 of these patients (Group B), endoscopic biopsy specimens were taken from the minor and major curvatures of the stomach, from the jejunal part of the gastrojejunostomy, and from the duodenum. Mucosal gastrin concentrations measured were 0, 20.4 +/- 3 ng/g, and 30 +/- 7.1 ng/g, respectively. Ten of these patients (Group C) had a repeated gastroscopy with food stimulation of the duodenal pouch, using a balloon catheter in the lower duodenum. Serum gastrin concentrations after pouch stimulation did not differ significantly compared with basal values. No changes in the mucosal gastrin concentrations during pouch stimulation were seen. In conclusion, since no gastrin could be detected in the gastric mucosa and the mucosal gastrin concentration in the duodenum was 50 times lower than reported in other studies, the gastrin release measured after food stimulation could have been of extragastric or extraduodenal origin.\r"

A long-standing lower blood glucose level played an important role in the increments in food intake and dilatation of the stomach. At the same time, ulceration was seen in 83.3 percent of the animals that received balloons. We conclude that intragastric balloon therapy may not be an effective approach for managing morbid obesity in human subjects.\r"

We made a retrospective study of 25 patients with this disease in an attempt to evaluate the indicators of aggressive behavior. In our series, older patient age, nulliparity, rapid tumor growth, pain, and large size of tumors increased the suspicion of malignancy but were not always reliable indicators of malignancy. Skin ulceration, tumor necrosis, and infiltrating tumor margins were the most ominous characteristics. High-grade tumors, that is, those with increased cellularity, vascularity, mitotic figure, and pleomorphism, often indicated aggressive behavior. Mixed mesenchymal components were sometimes related to a malignant course. We found a 24 percent incidence of associated breast cancer. Carcinoma of the ipsilateral breast was found in four patients and later in the contralateral breast in two patients. Of our 25 patients, 10 (40 percent) had recurrence and 4 (16 percent) died from disease. Recurrences after treatment usually occurred within 3 years. Patients must be followed carefully for local recurrence or metastases, since the clinical course is not predictable. Forty percent of the lesions were diagnosed as being malignant. Local excision was associated with recurrence in six of eight patients and was clearly inadequate treatment. Quadrantectomy was effective for benign peripheral lesions when a generous margin could be obtained. From these data, we believe that mastectomy is indicated in all patients with malignant lesions and in those with large benign lesions.\r"

Transitional mucosa surrounding the tumor was identified in 90 cases. The extent varied from 0 to 17 cm (mean 3.1 cm). In addition, the appearance of multiple patch lesions of increased sialomucin production was confirmed at sites far removed from the tumor in 35 cases. A predominant sialomucin pattern was seen in the proximal resection margin in 14 cases (17.9 percent), occurring as an isolated patch in 6 (43 percent). Sialomucin was also seen in the distal resection margin in 15 cases (15.9 percent), occurring as a direct extension of transitional mucosa surrounding the tumor in 12 (80 percent). These findings suggest that sialomucin production is a primary phenomenon that occurs as part of a field change in the human colon that develops cancer, and that these changes may occur in a resection margin and, by inference, remain at an anastomosis after resection.\r"

Resection and anastomosis, with or without temporary diverting colostomy, practiced in the majority of emergency cases in the earlier years covered in this review, has been replaced in the past 10 years by resection without anastomosis. Transverse colostomy, first carried out as part of a three-stage procedure, has been partially replaced by descending colostomy in the past few years. A comparison of the findings at exploration in patient who underwent resection, anastomosis, and temporary transverse colostomy with the findings in those who had the Hartmann procedure showed a slightly higher incidence of free perforation or abscess in those who had the former procedure. The hospital stay was similar in the two groups, but time in the operating room and days of disability were much less in the resection group. Only 14 of the 23 patients who survived the Hartmann procedure underwent restoration of continuity, whereas all of those in the resection group did. Follow-up of the patients who had descending colostomy showed that only 6 of 11 surviving patients underwent resection and anastomosis, but that inflammation regularly subsided, and all those with continent sphincters under age 80 eventually had restoration of continuity. This is in contrast to a more than 20 percent incidence of permanent stomas in the transverse colostomy group, all of which were in patients under age 70.\r"

One such setting is intestinal ischemia. Identically prepared devascularized segments of rat intestine were treated with either intraluminal oxygenated perfluorocarbon (perfluorotributylamine) or physiologic saline solution. After timed sacrifice, blinded quantitative histologic evaluation for ischemic injury was performed. The perfluorotributylamine treatment groups had histologic scores indicative of less severe injury between 1 and 4 hours. These scores achieved statistical significance (p less than 0.05). We conclude that intraluminal oxygenated perfluorocarbons have a significant protective effect in this model of intestinal ischemia. This quantitative analysis is unique and is an important aspect of the preclinical evaluation of the perfluorocarbon preparations.\r"

A reduction of portal pressure after splenectomy with esophagogastric devascularization in 17 patients with idiopathic portal hypertension was significantly greater than that in 79 patients with liver cirrhosis (-21 +/- 4.1 percent versus -8.9 +/- 1.6 percent, p less than 0.01). Clearance of galactose from the blood, which approximates effective hepatic blood flow, was decreased after the nonshunting operation by 6.7 percent in five patients with liver cirrhosis (p value not significant). On the other hand, there was a 19.4 percent reduction (statistically significant) in galactose clearance in four patients with idiopathic portal hypertension (p less than 0.05). Based on these data, we suggest that in patients with idiopathic portal hypertension, the splenic circuit largely contributes to the portal hypertension, the effective hepatic blood flow, or both. We recommend a nonshunting operation for the treatment of esophageal varices from the hemodynamic viewpoint in cirrhotic patients.\r"

Herein, we have presented yet another use for the interposition polytetrafluoroethylene graft conduit, based on physiologically sound principles and a now proved successful outcome, namely as a surgical alternative for the patient with a hemodynamically unstable hemodialysis fistula resulting in arterial insufficiency. Poiseuille's Law regarding flow of liquids through a tube supports the concept on which our interposition graft is based: v = pi X P X R4/8 X 1 X n where v is the volume escaping per second, P the difference of pressure at the ends of the tube, R its radius, l the length of the tube, and n the coefficient of viscosity. Given the maintenance of all other parameters, if one increases the length of the tube through which blood is flowing, the volume of flow through said tube is simultaneously decreased, and the ischemic symptoms caused by arterial insufficiency are thereby ameliorated.\r"

We believe this operation is appropriate when local disease is advanced and clinically uninvolved neck nodes are likely to harbor occult metastatic disease, when resection of the primary tumor is through the neck, or when clinical disease in the neck is minimal. Patients with multiple palpable nodes, patients with nodes larger than 3 cm in diameter, patients with disease in the posterior triangle, and patients in whom radiotherapy to the neck has failed may be better served by radical neck dissection.\r"

In both groups eight patients needed supplementation with additional conduction blocks of 1-3 peripheral nerves. It is concluded that a nerve stimulator technique may increase the success rate of axillary brachial plexus block to some extent.\r"

It has been shown that in any attempt to assess the value of a form of clinical management, cases in which a nuchal cord was present in either twin must be disregarded and that attention must be paid to the techniques of analgesia/anaesthesia provided for delivery. There is a strong suggestion that the provision of an epidural for either Caesarean section or vaginal delivery is markedly beneficial to the second twin. There is also evidence to suggest that when vaginal delivery is conducted under an epidural, the acid-base status of the second twin is very likely to be as good as, or better than, that of its sibling, whereas that is most unlikely to be so among cases delivered without an epidural. Further benefit is conferred upon both twins if the bearing-down reflex is abolished. Attention is drawn to an apparently increasing frequency of abdominal delivery of the second twin following vaginal delivery of the first and to the consequent demand which this must make upon anaesthetic cover.\r"

She died following massive intestinal haemorrhage, intra-abdominal sepsis and probable disseminated intravascular coagulation. A diagnosis of neuroleptic malignant syndrome had been made, but treatment with dantrolene sodium was probably instituted too late to prevent the progress of the complications she had developed. This syndrome, which follows the use of phenothiazines or butyrophenones, is rare, potentially fatal and probably underdiagnosed. It has been likened to malignant hyperthermia, but a review of the literature points to many differences. Both dantrolene sodium and dopaminergic drugs (bromocriptine, amantidine and L-dopa) have been shown to be efficacious and their continued use, despite a failure in this case, is advocated until more is known about this syndrome.\r"

Approximately two-thirds of all consultants employed in the five specialties at National Health Service hospitals in England during 1966-83 were included in the study. Ill-health retirements among male anaesthetists were more than twice those expected on the basis of rates in the control group (p less than 0.001). The number of other early retirements between 60 and 64 was a third higher than expected (p less than 0.005). The number of deaths in post was also raised. For the smaller group of female anaesthetists there was not a statistically significant excess of ill-health retirements, but the number of early retirements between 60 and 64 was significantly greater than expected (p less than 0.005), as was the number of deaths in post (p less than 0.001).

Following control recordings of evoked potentials, either diazepam 20 mg or fentanyl 200 micrograms was administered intravenously. Evoked potentials were then recorded twice in the subsequent hour. No significant changes occurred in the latency or amplitude of somatosensory, visual or brainstem auditory evoked potentials. Although dose-related changes in evoked potential latencies and amplitudes have been demonstrated with both the inhalational and intravenous anaesthetics, these changes did not occur with diazepam or fentanyl used alone. An anaesthetic technique based on these two drugs would be suitable when intra-operative evoked potential monitoring is required to assess ischaemia and preservation of evoked responses.\r"

Sufentanil provided marked hemodynamic stability after an infusion and during the stress periods of incision and sternotomy. Two patients required supplemental nitrous oxide because of an increase in blood pressure greater than 20% of baseline. Mean plasma catecholamine concentrations varied widely among patients and increased, although not significantly, during intraoperative stress. Pharmacokinetic data best fit a two-compartment model. In infants younger than 10 months (group 1) and children older than 10 months (group 2) who were not surface-cooled, elimination half-lives were similar (mean +/- SD, 53 +/- 15 min vs 55 +/- 10 min) as were clearance values (27.5 +/- 9.3 vs 18.1 +/- 10.7 ml X kg-1 X min-1). However, the volumes of distribution were significantly smaller in group 1 compared with group 2 (1.6 +/- 0.46 vs 3.0 +/- 1.3 L/kg). In infants younger than 10 months who were surface-cooled (group 3) elimination half-life was longer (120 +/- 36 min) and volume of distribution larger (3.7 +/- 1.1 L/kg), but clearance rate was similar (21.5 +/- 5.0 ml X kg-1 X min-1) compared with age- and weight-matched infants (group 1).\r"

  ".W": "To test whether acute denervation alters the vascular effects of dopamine and dobutamine, we anesthetized 16 greyhounds and placed them on total cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Eight dogs received total spinal anesthesia before drug testing; eight dogs were tested in the absence of total spinal anesthesia. During dopamine and dobutamine infusions, venous capacitance [determined by the volume of the CPB venous reservoir (VR)] and mean arterial pressure (MAP) were monitored. The CPB pump flows remained constant throughout our studies. Every dog received six increasing doses of both drugs. In the absence of total spinal anesthesia, both dopamine and dobutamine increased VR (decreased venous capacitance) in a dose-dependent manner. Dobutamine decreased MAP in a dose-related fashion but dopamine had no significant effect on MAP. After total spinal anesthesia, both dopamine and dobutamine produced greater dose-related increases in VR (i.e., decreases in venous capacitance) than in the absence of spinal anesthesia. Dopamine increased MAP but dobutamine had no significant effect. These data demonstrate how dopamine and dobutamine differ in their effects on the arterial circulation in the presence or absence of spinal anesthesia. The acute denervation of spinal anesthesia altered venous and arterial dose-response relationships of both drugs. Finally, our study demonstrates the effectiveness of dobutamine and, perhaps even more so, dopamine as possible alternatives to ephedrine for the pharmacologic correction of the noncardiac circulatory sequelae of spinal anesthesia.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of two infusion rates of amrinone, a positive inotrope and vasodilator, were studied during high and low concentrations of either enflurane or isoflurane anesthesia in a canine model. The anesthetic concentrations used were: \"low\" = 2.1-2.2% enflurane or 1.7-1.8% isoflurane, and \"high\" = 3.4-3.5% enflurane or 3.0-3.1% isoflurane. The two infusion rates of amrinone were: \"low\" = 2 mg/kg plus 30 micrograms X kg-1 X min-1 and \"high\" = 4 mg/kg plus 100 micrograms X kg-1 X min-1. In the present study, amrinone, in sufficient doses, blunted the deleterious effects of enflurane or isoflurane on myocardial function, reduced systemic vascular resistance (SVR) and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, restored left ventricular dP/dtmax (LVdP/dtmax), and maintained cardiac index, even at the high concentrations of enflurane or isoflurane that caused marked cardiac depression. However, with reduced SVR, mean arterial pressure remained low. With lower enflurane or isoflurane, high concentrations of amrinone elevated LVdP/dtmax and heart rate above baseline, which might be of concern if myocardial oxygen supply were limited. No arrhythmias were observed at any time in this study. Amrinone did not increase plasma catecholamine levels with either anesthetic. Elevated amrinone plasma concentrations persisted for at least 1 hr after cessation of the high amrinone infusion and continued stimulatory effects on the cardiovascular system were observed. These results suggest that in selected patients amrinone may be beneficial in the short-term treatment of perioperative depression of cardiac performance.\r"

Exposure to 1% halothane for 4 hr in 21% O2 proved to be hepatotoxic in both sexes. Forty-eight hours after halothane exposure fatty vacuolization of hepatocytes was present in all animals. Histologically identifiable hepatic necrosis occurred in 60% of the guinea pigs exposed, along with concomitant increases in SGPT. Approximately one half of these responding animals had extensive centrilobular necrosis, which was still present 96 hr after halothane exposure. Females of the inbred strain 2 and males and females of strain 13 were the most susceptible to halothane-induced hepatic necrosis whereas the inbred Hartley strain was almost totally refractory to necrosis. Outbred Amana and male inbred strain 2 animals exhibited an intermediate hepatotoxic response. Comparison of the halothane-associated hepatic lesion with that induced by anoxic/ischemic mechanisms, (exposure to low (8%) oxygen during 1.7% enflurane anesthesia) showed obvious differences in the morphology of the hepatic necrosis and the apparent time course of lesion development. This guinea pig model of halothane-associated hepatotoxicity appears to be superior to previous animal models in that no pretreatment of the guinea pigs is required, both sexes are affected, and the resulting hepatic lesion is more persistent.\r"

Adenosine infusion (214 +/- 18 micrograms X kg-1 X min-1) decreased mean arterial pressure (MAP) by 42 +/- 1% from 80 +/- 1 to 46 +/- 1 mm Hg for an average of 29 +/- 5 min of hypotension. Hypotension was associated with a minor increase in heart rate (13 +/- 2%) and with prolongation of the PR interval (9 +/- 2%). ST-T depression did not occur except in one patient with a previous history of myocardial infarction. The adenosine-induced increase in cardiac index (42 +/- 9%, n = 7) was associated with a 63 +/- 10% decrease in systemic vascular resistance index (n = 7) while the pulmonary capillary wedge pressure remained unchanged. Adenosine metabolism was limited and there was no accumulation of the end metabolite, uric acid. Serum creatinine levels were normal in all patients postoperatively. We conclude that adenosine rapidly induces a stable and easily controlled hypotension in man without tachyphylaxis or rebound hypertension. There were no signs of renal or myocardial dysfunction except for dysrhythmias that occurred in two patients with a history of myocardial infarction.\r"

We found that with sevoflurane, tidal volume and the slopes of the CO2 response curves decreased and PaCO2 increased with increasing depth of anesthesia, as with other inhaled anesthetics. A compensatory increase in respiratory frequency was not enough to prevent a decrease in minute volume with increasing depth of anesthesia. At 1.1 MAC, sevoflurane produced almost the same degree of respiratory depression as halothane. At 1.4 MAC, sevoflurane produced more profound respiratory depression than halothane.\r"

Isoflurane caused dose-dependent decreases in LV and RV dP/dt, and in myocardial segment shortening in the presence of unchanged heart rate, unchanged or increased (RV) preload, and unchanged (RV) or decreased (LV) afterload. RV and LV functions were affected differently: at a mean aortic pressure of 70 mmHg (mean inspired isoflurane 1.2%), RV end diastolic dimensions and pressure remained unchanged, whereas those of the LV decreased. At a mean aortic pressure of 55 mmHg (mean inspired isoflurane 1.8%), RV end diastolic dimensions and pressure increased above control, whereas those of the LV remained unchanged. Within the RV, inflow and outflow tract were affected quantitatively similarly, but dyssynchrony developed in four animals. Isoflurane caused dose-dependent decreases in coronary and systemic vascular resistances, but no change in pulmonary vascular resistance. At the lower concentration of isoflurane, coronary blood flow did not fall despite decreased LV and RV dP/dt, unchanged heart rate, unchanged or decreased preload, and unchanged or reduced afterload. The data indicate that isoflurane is a myocardial depressant and a potent coronary vasodilator. At both concentrations, LV function was better preserved than RV function, most likely due to the different effects of isoflurane on RV (unchanged) and LV (reduced) afterload.\r"

Angiograms of the left coronary system were obtained in seven fentanyl-pentobarbital anesthetized dogs and quantitated with a computerized analysis system. Cross-sectional areas of the proximal, mid, and distal left anterior descending and proximal circumflex coronary arteries were obtained at three arterial pressures, and then the measurement repeated following administration of 0.75%, 1.5%, and 2.25% end-tidal isoflurane. At the same time coronary blood flow was measured using a 123Xe washout technique. Isoflurane was found to have no effect on epicardial coronary artery dimensions. No dilatation was observed throughout the range of isoflurane concentrations and coronary perfusion pressures investigated. However, despite the absence of epicardial coronary effects, coronary arterioles were dilated by both 1.5% and 2.25% isoflurane. Coronary blood flow corresponding to a myocardial oxygen consumption of 7.5 ml oxygen X 100 gm-1 X min-1 was calculated as 99 +/- 17 ml X 100 gm-1 X min-1 (mean +/- SD) during control conditions, and it increased to 150 +/- 26 ml X 100 gm-1 X min-1 at 1.5% isoflurane (P less than .004) and to 197 +/- 35 ml X 100 gm-1 X min-1 at 2.25% isoflurane (P less than .001). Although higher concentrations of isoflurane dilated intramyocardial arterioles, isoflurane had no effect on epicardial coronary arteries.\r"

An ameroid constrictor was implanted in dogs to stimulate the development of intercoronary collateral vessels. During an acute experiment 3-4 weeks following implantation, heart rate, mean arterial pressure, and total coronary flow were held constant, and flow distribution was measured with microspheres in the presence and absence of isoflurane. Contractile function of the collateral-dependent zone and myocardial lactate extraction were also measured. Isoflurane produced a decrease in collateral flow and a decrement in collateral zone contraction, while, at the same time, enhancing flow in the normally perfused zone. In a second series of animals, isoflurane was found to have effects similar to those of adenosine, an arteriolar dilator known to produce coronary steal. In contrast, neither halothane nor nitrous oxide caused flow alterations or dysfunction of the collateral-dependent zone.\r"

The stenoses reduced resting coronary blood flow by approximately 10% without affecting global or regional myocardial performance. During subsequent isoflurane administration, coronary blood flow fell markedly. In the areas supplied by the stenosed coronary arteries, segment length shortening decreased by 70% (P less than 0.01), and regional akinesis, paradoxical motion, or postsystolic shortening developed in 9 of 12 animals. In contrast, in the areas supplied by normal coronary arteries, myocardial segment length shortening decreased significantly less and did not show signs of dysfunction. In these non-ischemic areas at both concentrations of isoflurane, end diastolic and systolic dimensions were greater in the right than in the left ventricle, probably related to differences in right (unchanged) and left (reduced) ventricular afterloads. The data indicate that in the presence of coronary artery stenoses, isoflurane-induced hypotension may cause regional myocardial dysfunction suggestive of ischemia.\r"

Complete cerebral ischemia was produced in 31 dogs by temporary ligation of the aorta and venae cavae. In six dogs, 10 min of complete cerebral ischemia was followed by an infusion of lidoflazine 1.0 mg X kg-1 iv over 10 min. CBF and cerebral metabolic rate for oxygen (CMRO2) were measured pre-ischemia, and for 90 min post-ischemia. The results from these six dogs were compared with results previously obtained from eight untreated dogs under similar, but not identical, conditions. The CBF measured post-ischemia in the dogs administered lidoflazine did not differ from the CBF measured post-ischemia in the untreated dogs. Both groups showed an initial hyperemia post-ischemia, followed by significant decreases in CBF from control values by 35 min post-ischemia. The post-ischemic CMRO2 also did not differ between lidoflazine treated and untreated groups. In 25 dogs, 11 min of complete cerebral ischemia was followed by an iv infusion of either lidoflazine 1.0 mg X kg-1 or saline placebo. The same iv infusions were repeated at 8 and 16 h post-ischemia. Seven dogs were excluded from data analysis for failure to meet pre-established protocol criteria. Neurologic injury was evaluated in the remaining dogs at 48 h post-ischemia by an observer blinded to the treatment groups.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The lungs were ventilated separately with a double-lumen endobronchial catheter. After oxygen ventilation of both lungs for 30 min during intravenous barbiturate anesthesia, the test lung was rendered hypoxic by ventilation with 8% O2 in nitrogen. The control lung was ventilated continuously with 100% O2. Isoflurane was added to the inspired gas, so that end-tidal concentrations of 1% and 1.5% were obtained. Cardiac output (QT) was determined by thermodilution, and the distribution of blood flow between the lungs was assessed from the excretion of a continuously infused, poorly soluble gas (SF6). The hypoxic challenge during intravenous anesthesia resulted in a reduction in the fractional perfusion of the test lung from 54% to 41% of QT. Mean pulmonary arterial pressure increased by 46%, and pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) of the test lung more than doubled. Arterial oxygen tension fell from 375 mmHg (50 kPa) to 101 mmHg (13.5 kPa). Adding isoflurane to the inhalation gas, first at a concentration of 1%, then 1.5%, caused no further significant change in the distribution of pulmonary blood flow, although six of the eight subjects showed a small increase in test lung blood flow at isoflurane 1.5%. There was no change in PVR or in any other circulatory variable. Arterial blood gases remained essentially unaltered. When the hypoxic challenge was discontinued, all variables returned to control values.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Radioactivity was recorded with a gamma camera, and its distribution determined in the thorax, abdomen, and limbs. Arterial and central venous pressure, heart rate, and calf volume by plethysmography were measured. During epidural anesthesia with a sensory block up to T4/5, DHE (7.5 micrograms/kg) reduced the radioactivity, i.e., blood volume, in both the innervated (-5.9 +/- 3.5%) and denervated muscle/skin (-16.9 +/- 7%) regions, and increased it in both the intrathoracic (+7.0 +/- 2.3%), and splanchnic vasculature (+4.2 +/- 3.2). In contrast, E (6 micrograms X kg-1 X min-1) decreased the blood volume most markedly in the splanchnic region (-5.4 +/- 0.7%) and increased it in the thorax (+2 +/- 0.6%). All these changes were statistically significant. The combined effects were estimated to be equivalent to a transfusion of nearly 1.01 of blood. Both drugs reversed the hypotensive action of epidural anesthesia. During epidural anesthesia, DHE preferentially constricted the capacitance vessels in skeletal muscle and skin irrespective of the state of innervation, whereas E preferentially constricted the splanchnic vasculature. In the doses used, the two agents replenished in an additive fashion the central circulation during epidural anesthesia.\r"

Hepatic blood flow was measured using microspheres; hepatic oxygen supply and consumption was calculated from measured hepatic blood flow and oxygen content in hepatic arterial, portal venous, and hepatic venous blood. In all anesthetic groups, total hepatic blood flow did not change from the control value. Oxygen supply to the liver was decreased from air control values in all anesthetic groups, but there were no significant differences among anesthetic groups. Hepatic oxygen consumption was significantly lower in animals exposed to halothane and isoflurane versus air controls, whereas it was not significantly decreased in animals receiving thiopental or enflurane. The hepatic oxygen supply/consumption ratio was higher in the air control and the isoflurane groups than in other groups; however, no significant differences in this ratio were observed among the thiopental, halothane, and enflurane groups. Oxygen content in hepatic venous blood correlated well with hepatic oxygen supply/consumption ratio in all five groups. These results show that, during exposure to mild hypoxia, a sub-MAC dose of isoflurane maintains the relationship of hepatic oxygen supply to uptake better than thiopental, halothane, or enflurane. However, a subanesthetic dose of halothane did not aggravate liver hypoxia specifically, compared with thiopental or enflurane.\r"

  ".W": "The accuracy and stability of mixed venous saturation pulmonary arterial catheters under adverse physiologic conditions has not been assessed. Either a Shaw Opticath catheter (three-wavelength) or a Swan-Ganz oximetry TD catheter (two-wavelength) was calibrated in vitro and positioned in the pulmonary artery in each of ten mongrel dogs. The in vivo saturations were compared to measured saturations from anaerobically collected mixed venous blood analyzed with a reference cooximeter at each step in the protocol. Oxygen delivery was varied to obtain a broad range of mixed venous saturations (Sv-O2) by altering inspired oxygen concentration, isovolemic hemodilution, reducing cardiac output, and increasing afterload. Calculated oxygen consumption varied from 128 to 311 ml/min. Pre-insertion calibration for both catheter types compared favorably with the cooximeter prior to physiologic manipulations, although the three-wavelength catheter more closely approximated the cooximeter. The three-wavelength catheter tracked measured Sv-O2 accurately under adverse conditions for up to 10 h (R = .994; SEE = 2.2%). The two-wavelength catheter tended to drift under the same conditions (R = .808; SEE = 10.6%). At the conclusion of the experiment, the two-wavelength system was uniformly higher then the cooximeter by 5-31% with a mean of 21% (P less than or equal to .003 as compared with the initial difference by paired Student's t test). Pending further analysis of the tendency of the two-wavelength system to drift it would seem prudent to limit its clinical application.\r"

  ".W": "The authors determined the accuracy of the Ohmeda 3700 (version J) pulse oximeter in healthy volunteers rendered hypoxic (SaO2 from 60-98%) by breathing mixtures of O2 in N2. When equipped with an ear probe, the pulse oximeter reading (y) reliably predicted arterial saturation (x) under steady-state conditions (y = 1.05x - 4.66, r = 0.98) as well as when oxygen saturation was rapidly decreasing (y = 1.05x - 6.38, r = 0.96). Conversely, when equipped with a finger probe, the oximeter tended to significantly underestimate steady-state arterial saturation (y = 1.21x - 19.1, r = 0.98, P less than 0.001). In response to this information, the manufacturer modified the oximeter's software (version XJ1), resulting in improved agreement between oximeter readings and arterial values (y = 0.96x + 4.59, r = 0.99). Despite the close correlation between steady-state oximeter readings and arterial saturation, the 99% prediction limits for both the ear and finger probes (version XJ1) were +/- 8%. Finger probe readings did not reliably reflect radial arterial oxygenation during rapid desaturation (y = 0.55x + 45.2, r = 0.78). This may be related to the time required to \"arterialize\" the blood in the finger; during acute resaturation, we found that the ear- to finger-probe delay was 24.0 +/- 2.3 s (means +/- SE, P less than 0.001).\r"

The cyanide concentrations were significantly increased at 24 h in the light-exposed solution. In this group, 100% of the cyanide was released from sodium nitroprusside at 72 h exposure to light. However, cyanide concentrations showed no significant changes for 72 h in the light-protected solutions, which were either exposed to 500 foot candles fluorescent light or stored in a dark room. Less than 2.5% of the cyanide was released from sodium nitroprusside at 72 h in both of the light-protected groups. No significant differences in cyanide concentrations were observed at 8 h among the exposed or non-exposed solutions. After 24 h of exposure, the cyanide concentrations in the exposed group were significantly higher than those of the two light-protected solutions. However, there were no significant differences between the cyanide concentration in the light-protected solutions. These results substantiate the safety of sodium nitroprusside solution for 24 h if the sodium nitroprusside containing solutions are properly protected from light. An additional study performed showed that a significant amount of cyanide released from sodium nitroprusside was adsorbed to the surface of polyvinylchloride.\r"

Following a control period of fifteen minutes with confirmed circulatory variables, 1,375 mg calcium gluconate was infused over three minutes. Systemic mean arterial blood pressure and heart rate were recorded before, at one-minute intervals during, and for five minutes following the infusion. There was a brief increase of serum ionized calcium concentration (from 1.28 +/- 0.06 mmol/liter to 1.42 +/- 0.07 mmol/liter; p less than 0.001) maximum by one minute after infusion with return toward control by a further four minutes. This was accompanied by a significantly decreased mean arterial blood pressure (from 117 +/- 8 mmHg to 110 +/- 9 mmHg at three minutes; p less than 0.05) and heart rate (from 70 +/- 11 min-1 to 63 +/- 10 min-1 at three minutes; p less than 0.01). There was a significant correlation between the change in ionized calcium and that of the systemic arterial blood pressure (r = 0.68; p less than 0.01). No major side effects were recorded. The blood pressure reduction may theoretically be related to increased membrane stabilization of vascular smooth muscle cells, the acute increase in extracellular ionized calcium impairing calcium ions influx.\r"

Analysis of observations for lumen surface morphology revealed statistically significant interobserver differences, averaging 29.5% disagreement. Intraobserver differences were not statistically significant. Observer variability for arteriography should be considered in the process of evaluating patients for carotid endarterectomy.\r"

From these studies and those of other investigators, we conclude that the most significant in vivo factors influencing disopyramide binding in human serum are total disopyramide concentration, the concentration of alpha 1-acid glycoprotein, and the concentration of mono-N-dealkyldisopyramide. Significant variation in binding occurs in patients whose total disopyramide concentration is within the therapeutic range. The proportion of free disopyramide ranged from 16% to 54% in the sera of 50 cardiac patients whose total disopyramide concentration ranged from 0.5 to 5.8 mcg/ml. Since there is so much variation in the proportion of disopyramide that is free, and since it is the unbound form of the drug that is pharmacologically active, it is likely in patients whose arrhythmia responds to disopyramide therapy that unbound drug concentration will be a better indicator of drug efficacy and toxicity than will be total drug concentration. To test this hypothesis, we are investigating the relationship between steady state total and unbound disopyramide plasma levels in patients with supraventricular or ventricular arrhythmias, and pharmacologic response as determined by standard intracardiac electrophysiologic studies.\r"

In the group of 21 patients with \"positive or highly suggestive food history\" related to their bronchial complaints, 21 food challenges were performed. In the group of 86 patients with \"unknown food history,\" 122 ingestion challenges with foods causing a positive skin response were performed. Fifteen of the 21 patients with \"positive food history\" developed 15 (71%) bronchus-obstructive responses to foods ingested, while 45 of the 86 patients with \"unknown food history\" developed 68 (56%) bronchial responses to the food ingestion challenge. Twenty-three isolated immediate (within 2 hours), 11 isolated late (4 to 24 hours), 34 dual late (a combination of an immediate and a late), 6 isolated delayed (28 to 56 hours), and 9 dual delayed (a combination of an immediate and delayed) bronchus-obstructive responses were recorded. No significant correlation of the individual types of bronchial response to food ingested with other in vivo and in vitro diagnostic parameters were found. Although the exact pathogenetic and immunologic mechanisms underlying the particular types of bronchial response to foods are not yet fully clarified, the involvement of different types of hypersensitivity cannot be excluded. It could be concluded that the involvement of foods in bronchial asthma is more frequent than is usually expected. The diagnostic value of the food ingestion challenge seems to be superior to that of other diagnostic parameters. The definite confirmation of the role of a certain food, in patients with bronchial asthma, should therefore be provided by the food ingestion challenge demonstrating one of the clinical types of bronchus-obstructive response.\r"

Parents reported less disruption of family activities due to asthma and that the children had increased their use of asthma self-management techniques, resulting in improved management of asthma at home.

We report a prospective study to compare \"tilt test\" results between children with and without clinical volume depletion in a pediatric emergency setting. Children 4 to 15 years old seeking care at an urban pediatric emergency department were eligible. Children meeting the following criteria were classified as dehydrated: an acute history of vomiting or diarrhea and a volume depletion score greater than or equal to 4. The control sample was selected from children with minor complaints, and a volume depletion score less than 4. Blood pressure and heart rate were recorded at one-minute intervals by an automatic noninvasive blood pressure monitor for three minutes in the supine position. Subsequently, measurements were taken for two minutes in the standing position with the arm supported at heart level. Sixteen dehydrated and 21 normal children were enrolled; the groups were comparable in mean age, weight, sex, and oral temperature, but differed significantly in racial background. The mean orthostatic rise in heart rate was 29.1 beats per minute (+/- 10.7) in the clinically dehydrated group and 13.1 beats per minute (+/- 8.5) in the control group (P less than .001). There was no significant difference between the two groups with respect to the small decrease in systolic blood pressure (0.38 and 0.46 mm Hg).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

All previous methods of utilization prediction based on experiences of individual services or accident statistics have been either inaccurate, costly, or difficult to obtain in a relatively short period of time. Prediction of HEMS utilization requires consideration of many significant, simultaneous factors, in addition to patient needs based on population statistics. Through use of a survey of all hospital-based helicopter emergency service programs and published census data, this study analyzed factors relating to helicopter program volume and case mix, providing insight as to why previous methods utilizing total population were inaccurate. A more accurate yet simple and inexpensive method of utilization prediction for HEMS was developed.\r"

Direct trauma was the mechanism of injury for 33 patients, traction for 18, shoulder dislocation for six, and acromioclavicular separation for two. The injuries occurred on the left side in 33 (56%); the right side in 23 (39%), and bilaterally in three (5%). Eight patients (14%) suffered complete brachial plexus palsies, and 51 (86%) incurred partial palsies. Nine patients (15.2%) presented in shock. Severe associated injuries occurred in this group of patients and included multiple rib fractures, hemopneumothorax, pulmonary contusion, head injuries, and upper extremity fractures. Subclavian artery injuries occurred in three patients, axillary artery in two patients, and an internal carotid injury in one patient. Complete resolution of the palsy occurred in 25 patients, partial resolution occurred in 17 cases, and the brachial plexus palsy remained permanent in nine. Eight patients were lost to follow-up. Brachial plexus injuries frequently occur in association with severe trauma, are usually partial palsies, and resolve partially or completely in two-thirds of cases. In addition, 10% of these patients suffered major vascular injuries and 10% incurred significant chest trauma.\r"

After this rapid admixture, equilibrated temperatures were 29.1 and 34.0 C, respectively. The procedure also was performed using 35-day-old erythrocytes and 60-C saline. Samples were obtained for analysis immediately after admixture. There was no significant plasma hemoglobin elevation, indicating no significant hemolysis, in any sample at either temperature. Rapid admixture bloodwarming appears to be a technique in which erythrocytes and heated saline may be combined rapidly without causing significant hemolysis. However, further studies of red cell function and survival will be needed before this technique should be put into clinical practice.\r"

For all three types of portable radiographs, radiation exposure is a function of distance from the beam. However, at 40 cm (15 inches) away from the beam during a pC-S or pCXR and at 160 cm (63 inches) from a pAP-pelvis film, exposure is minimal. At these distances one would need to be exposed to more than 1,200 such radiographs to equal background environmental ionizing radiation. Medical personnel should not have to leave a patient care area for fear of undue acute and chronic radiation exposure while portable radiographs are performed in the ED. By using protective garments and standing appropriate distances away from the patient, continuous patient care can be maintained while portable radiographs are taken in the ED.\r"

We reviewed the literature to determine a rational basis for the management of the varicella-zoster virus-exposed hospital employee. Exposed employees include those with direct face-to-face contact with an infected person. The immune status should be determined in those employees with a negative or uncertain history of varicella infection by using a sensitive and specific technique such as the FAMA or ELISA tests. Employees with a positive history or a positive titer are immune and can return to work. Those with a negative titer are susceptible and should avoid patient contact from day eight to 21 following exposure. High-risk, susceptible contacts should be given varicella-zoster immune globulin. Varicella infection will become much less common after the release of varicella vaccine.\r"

  ".W": "Both obstructive sleep apnea and chronic lung disease can be associated with intermittent or chronic hypoxemia leading to pulmonary hypertension and cor pulmonale. When these problems coexist, it is possible that the cardiopulmonary effects are additive. We hypothesized that hemodynamic disturbances in patients with apnea and lung disease would be more severe than in those with apnea alone, and that hemodynamic improvement should follow apnea cure, but perhaps at a slower rate than in those with apnea alone. To test these hypotheses, we prospectively followed 24 patients with sleep apnea syndrome. They were divided into 3 nonrandomized groups. Nineteen patients had both apnea and lung disease. Nine of these agreed to curative tracheostomy (Group 1). The other 10 subjects (Group 2) refused tracheostomy but accepted noncurative therapies, including nocturnal oxygen (n = 9), uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (n = 2), and protriptyline (n = 4). Five subjects with apnea but without clinically obvious lung disease received tracheostomies (Group 3). Subjects were followed at yearly intervals (mean follow-up, 27.2 months) with radionuclide motion studies and, in 15 of 24 who consented, right heart catheterization. The 3 groups did not vary with respect to age, percent ideal weight, or severity of apnea symptoms. The severity of right-sided hemodynamic dysfunction in the group with apnea but no obvious lung disease was less than that in the 2 groups with lung disease. A substantial decrease in pulmonary artery pressure (p = 0.056) and significant improvement in right ventricular ejection fraction occurred in the tracheostomized group with both apnea and lung disease. Pulmonary vascular resistance decreased in both groups receiving tracheostomy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The urinary UA:Cr ratio increased overnight in patients with sleep-associated hypoxemia (+31.2 +/- 10.9%), whereas it decreased in the control patients with negative sleep studies (-13.6 +/- 4.6%; p less than or equal to 0.01) and in the normal volunteers (-23.2 +/- 5.8%). Repeat polysomnography revealed interval resolution of sleep-associated hypoxemia in 2 patients and significant improvement in a third. In every case, this clinical improvement was accompanied by a decrease in the overnight change in UA:Cr ratio. We report that urinary UA:Cr ratio increased overnight in a nonhomogeneous group of patients with sleep-associated hypoxemia.\r"

  ".W": "We studied the effects of digoxin, a compound that has an inotropic effect on the myocardium, on diaphragmatic function in 8 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. All the patients were in acute respiratory failure and were artificially ventilated. Diaphragmatic strength was assessed by measuring the transdiaphragmatic pressure generated at functional residual capacity during bilateral supramaximal electrical stimulation of the phrenic nerves. The latter were stimulated before and at 45 and 90 min after administration of digoxin (0.02 mg/kg infused for 10 min). In all the patients, cardiac output was measured by the thermodilution technique using a Swan-Ganz catheter placed in the pulmonary artery. Arterial blood gases and pH were maintained within normal range by mechanical ventilation. In all the patients, digoxin plasma levels reached the therapeutic range (mean values, 2.82 +/- 0.17 and 2.90 +/- 0.20 nmol/L at 45 and 90 min, respectively) after digoxin administration. Diaphragmatic strength improves significantly after digoxin administration, the transdiaphragmatic pressure for an identical phrenic stimulation increasing by 19.5% (p less than 0.001) on the average. This increase was noted 45 and 90 min after digoxin administration. We conclude that digoxin has a potent effect on diaphragmatic strength generation that may be beneficial in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease during acute respiratory failure. Furthermore, this inotropic positive effect of digoxin on the diaphragm, as previously observed for the myocardium, emphasizes the similarities between these 2 contractile tissues.\r"

Alterations in both the resting membrane potential and developed isometric force were determined. Addition of SP (10(-10) to 10(-4) M) caused a nonphasic, dose-dependent, sustained depolarization of airway smooth muscle cells, with the concomitant development of increased isometric force. In contrast, f-Met-Leu-Phe (10(-12) to 10(-6) M) induced a biphasic membrane response of airway smooth muscle cells, i.e., a dose-dependent rapid depolarization, followed by prolonged hyperpolarization. During the depolarization phase, a significant transient increase in the isometric force was observed. A selective N-formyl peptide antagonist, t-boc-phenylalanyl-leucyl-phenylalanyl-leucyl-phenylalanine, prevented the f-Met-Leu-Phe-induced changes in membrane polarity and increase in isometric force, as did amiloride (10(-5) M), the selective sodium channel blocker. However, these agents had no effect on SP-induced changes in membrane potential or isometric force. These findings suggest that airway smooth muscle of guinea pigs possess both N-formyl peptide and SP receptors but that occupation of these receptors by their respective agonists leads to functionally distinct responses.\r"

The data were analyzed using multiple regression techniques. We controlled for other variables that might affect the frequency of ER visits, including smoking by the children themselves and the presence of other irritants or allergens in the child's home. Passive smoking was positively associated with ER visits (p less than 0.01), but not with hospitalizations or abnormalities in pulmonary function. The frequency of days with symptoms of asthma per month was also directly associated with ER visits (p less than 0.02). The estimated mean annual increase in ER visits attributable to the presence of one or more smokers in the household was 1.34 +/- 0.50, an increase of 63% over nonsmoking households. The estimated annual health care cost for emergency care of children with asthma that can be attributed to passive smoking is 92 dollars (95% confidence interval from 24 to 160 dollars) for families with 1 or more smokers.\r"

Studies were obtained on 3 consecutive days after hospital admission and approximately 18 days after discharge. Greater He-O2 response ([Vmax50(He-O2)--Vmax50(air)]/predicted Vmax50) X 100, was associated with: less cigarette consumption (p less than 0.02), lesser frequency of chronic productive cough (p less than 0.02), more symptom-free intervals (p less than 0.02), and greater frequency of allergic rhinitis (p less than 0.03). Patients with greater He-O2 response (Group 1) reached maximal improvement in air flow by Hospital Day 2, whereas those with a lesser He-O2 response (Group 2) continued to improve throughout the observation period. The Group 1 mean peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) improved by 24% of predicted per day to maximum, which was significantly greater (p less than 0.025) than the 11% per day rate of improvement of Group 2. The He-O2 response remained relatively stable throughout the course of the study except for 3 patients who dramatically improved their response with therapy. A highly significant correlation, adjusted for regression to the mean, (r = 0.95, p less than 0.0001) was found between mean baseline percent predicted Vmax50 and the mean He-O2 response. After adjustment for regression to the mean, there was no significant relationship between the degree of prebronchodilator He-O2 response and increase in He-O2 response with bronchodilator.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The aim of this study was to assess the sensitivity of this method in detecting early airway abnormalities caused by smoking or occupational hazards. Respiratory mechanical parameters by the forced oscillation technique and maximal expiratory flow volume (MEFV) curves were obtained in a group of 82 workers from a gas manufacturing plant. In addition, the variations in the frequency dependence of total respiratory resistance between air breathing and a mixture of helium-oxygen (He-O2) were measured. All parameters were normalized for age, height, and weight. In order to compare the 2 types of testing, multiple linear regressions were performed with smoking or exposure as independent variables on one hand and parameters of the 2 types of testing on the other hand. This statistical procedure showed that 2 parameters of the forced oscillation technique constantly reached higher levels of significance than those of the MEFV parameters in the regression equations describing smoking history and occupational exposure: these were the frequency dependence of resistance and the change in frequency dependence between air and He-O2 breathing. When nonsmokers, ex-smokers, and smokers were considered separately, the degree of frequency dependence of resistance and the change in frequency dependence between air and He-O2 breathing were the only parameters that were significantly different between these 3 groups (one-way analysis of variance).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

A multivariate analysis showed that the initial N2 explained about 30% (p less than 0.001) of the decline in FEV1 in OS, but only 10% (p less than 0.001) in the 3 groups together. In fact, the link between delta N2 and fall in FEV1 was restricted to OS. Closing volume and maximal expiratory flow rates were not related to decline in FEV1. The link between uneveness of ventilation and subsequent loss of FEV1 is of physiopathologic interest.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "We examined the volume history effect on maximal expiratory flow (Vmax) in patients with asthma by comparing Vmax at 60% of VC from forced exhalation maneuvers begun just above FRC (partial, P) with those begun from TLC (maximal, M) and expressed the results as M-P ratios. In a clinic population with varying degrees of obstruction, we found that M-P ratios varied inversely with the severity of the obstructive process, i.e., the more severely obstructed patients had a fall in Vmax after a deep inhalation (DI). By contrast, equally severe obstruction acutely induced in subjects with mild asthma was associated with an increase in Vmax after a DI. There was no difference between the spontaneous versus the induced groups in degree of nonhomogeneity as assessed by single-breath nitrogen tests. Changes in specific airway conductance after a DI during spontaneous obstruction were in the same direction as the changes in Vmax, and the time course for restitution of airway caliber in subjects who showed bronchoconstriction after a DI was significantly longer than for those subjects who showed bronchodilatation. We conclude that in severe bronchial asthma with spontaneous obstruction, a DI produces an increase in severity that is opposite to the results found in acutely induced obstruction, and the time course for reestablishing baseline airway caliber is more prolonged. We suggest that mechanisms for and sites of obstruction vary between the 2 groups.\r"

Hypohydration was induced by administering chlorthalidone, and this resulted in a 4.5% loss of body weight. During hypohydration, lung volumes increased significantly. Interestingly, ventilatory lung function tests including peak expiratory flow rate, FEV1, maximal voluntary ventilation, and flow rates at low lung volumes also increased significantly and returned to normal upon rehydration. Diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide remained unchanged. The improvement in ventilatory lung function tests during hypohydration was surprising, and it is suggested that this was related to loss of water within and/or around the airways. This mechanism is opposite to that which occurs in pulmonary edema with excess lung water where reduction in flow rates occurs.\r"

These experiments were designed to repeat those observations and identify the mechanism(s) responsible for the effects of constant distending pressure on subsequent lung function. The compliance of the lungs of exteriorized fetal lambs at 130 to 133 days gestational age increased 2.5-fold after 1 h of 15 cm of distending pressure. However, subsequent ventilation of the lambs exposed to distending pressure and control lambs resulted in comparable sequential compliance and blood gas and pH measurements. Severity of lung disease as reflected by the peak inspiratory pressure needed to normalize Pco2 values decreased as surfactant-saturated phosphatidylcholine pool sizes increased (r values greater than 0.90) and minimum surface tensions of alveolar washes decreased, but the distention procedure did not change these relationships. Distention of the fetal lung did result in an apparent increase in pulmonary blood flow in the fetus and an increased leak of labeled albumin from the vascular space to the lung interstitium and airways during the 1-h period of ventilation after delivery. However, the leak of protein into the lungs exposed to the distending pressures was not increased during the period of exteriorization and distention, suggesting that distention sensitized the preterm lung to leak protein with subsequent mechanical ventilation. The leak of labeled albumin out of the airways was not changed by distention, and total lung water was not changed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "A morphometric study was made of the remaining lung of term lambs that had undergone left pneumonectomy at 60, 80, 100, or 120 days gestation. All pneumonectomy lambs showed some compensatory growth since right lung volume to body weight ratio was higher in all lambs after pneumonectomy than in term controls. In 3 lambs operated at 80, 100, and 120 days, respectively, however, compensatory volume increase was more complete than in the other lamb of each age pair or the 2 lambs operated at 60 days. Despite individual variation, the potential for compensatory lung growth seems greater in the canalicular and later stages than in the pseudoglandular. Measurements indicating distal air-space size (volume density of alveoli, volume density of alveolar duct, surface density of alveolar epithelium, numerical density of alveoli, and mean linear intercept) were similar in all animals, but total alveolar surface area and number increased proportionally to lung volume. The fact that the remaining lung compensates by increasing alveolar number rather than by enlarging air spaces is a model of human developmental abnormalities in which the alveolar number at birth is greater than normal (polyalveolar). At the intraacinar level, a higher than normal proportion of muscularized arteries was found in lambs operated early in gestation and in lambs with smaller compensatory lung growth: an inverse relationship was seen--the lower the lung volume the higher the proportion of muscular arteries. The cause for this is unknown, but may result from the relatively increased flow to a vascular bed smaller than that of two normal lungs.\r"

Unchanged were the ratios of lung protein/DNA, RNA/DNA, lipid/DNA, and cholesterol/DNA; lung phospholipid content; and serum concentrations of glucose and phospholipids.

The addition of hypoxic endothelium-derived medium resulted in a 60% increase in smooth muscle cell number after 24 h of exposure. Addition of medium from pulmonary endothelium exposed to normoxic conditions or medium derived from either hypoxic or normoxic aortic endothelium did not result in significant increases in smooth muscle cell number. Physicochemical characterization of the hypoxic pulmonary endothelial cell-derived factor(s) showed that it was resistant to heat and reducing agent treatment and stable between pH 3 and 10. The mitogenic activity decreased by 71% at pH 2 and by 68% after treatment with trypsin. The activity adhered to DEAE Sephadex. Gel filtration chromatography of the hypoxic-conditioned medium demonstrated 2 major peaks of smooth muscle cell growth factor activity corresponding to molecular weights between 6,000 and 14,000 and 20,000 and 65,000 daltons, respectively. These data suggest that this pulmonary endothelial cell-derived smooth muscle cell peptide mitogen(s) may be involved in the smooth muscle cell proliferative response seen with chronic alveolar hypoxia.\r"

Twenty anesthetized dogs were ventilated with a constant tidal volume (20 ml/kg) of 100% oxygen. Oleic acid (0.09 ml/kg) was injected into the right atrium while rotating the animals through 360 degrees in 4 stages. Animals in Group I (n = 5) remained supine for 10 to 120 min until the supine PaO2 fell below 200 mm Hg. Those in Group II (n = 4) were kept prone during this period. Dogs in Groups I and II were then turned supine or prone every 30 min 5 times. Cardiac output and pulmonary vascular pressures, functional residual capacity (helium dilution), and regional diaphragmatic motion (determined by dorsal and ventral diaphragmatic markers relative to markers on the chest wall seen on lateral chest radiographs taken at FRC and at end-inspiration) were obtained in each position. Eleven dogs were kept supine (Group III, n = 6) or prone (Group IV, n = 5) for 2 h after oleic acid infusion, after which intrapulmonary shunt (Qs/QT) and ventilation-perfusion heterogeneity were measured in the supine and prone positions using the multiple inert gas elimination technique.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Because activation of the complement system can generate C5a, a potent neutrophil chemoattractant, complement activation was assessed in both serum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid obtained from 10 patients with ARDS and compared with that from normal control subjects. Crossed immunoelectrophoresis was used to determine activation of the complement components C3 and properdin factor B (PFB), and radioimmunoassay was used to determine the presence of C5a. Complement activation was not detected either in the plasma or in the lung epithelial lining fluid of the control subjects. In contrast, evidence of C3 activation was found in the plasma of 50% of the patients with ARDS when initially studied; likewise, C3 activation, PFB activation, and C5a could all be detected in the epithelial lining fluid of all patients with ARDS with a single exception. Follow-up bronchoalveolar lavages revealed decreased amounts of C3 activation and C5a 2 to 7 days after the onset of ARDS, and the complement activation had resolved when the patients with ARDS had completely recovered. To determine if the C5a in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid could be responsible for the influx of neutrophils observed in ARDS, epithelial lining fluids obtained from both normal control subjects and from patients with ARDS were fractionated by molecular sieve chromatography. Two distinct fractions of chemotactic activity were found in the ARDS bronchoalveolar lavage fluid.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We hypothesized that the fifth component of complement (C5) on the cell surface may be required for activation of the alveolar macrophage to release neutrophil chemotactic activity. C5 was identified on guinea pig alveolar macrophages by epifluorescent microscopy, flow cytometry, and enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay of eluted macrophages. When cultured for 4 h with stimuli that induce the release of chemotactic activity or for 24 h without added stimuli, purified Fab' fragments of a goat anti-C5 antibody significantly inhibited the ability of macrophages to release chemotactic activity as determined by a blindwell chamber method (p less than 0.001, all comparisons). This inhibition of chemotactic activity was not detected when anti-C5 antibody was added after the culture period. In contrast, anti-C3 antibody had no inhibitory effect at 4 h or at 24 h (p greater than 0.2, all comparisons). Partial characterization of released chemotactic activity revealed it was of low molecular weight, partially lipid soluble, and not inhibited by C5a chemotactic factor inactivator. These studies suggest that C5 may have a regulatory role in the release of chemotactic activity by alveolar macrophages.\r"

All of the patients had abnormal shadows on their chest radiographs, and all had histologically confirmed sarcoidosis. Groups of 60 and 57 unrelated Japanese served as control subjects for HLA-A,B,C and HLA-D region antigens, respectively. The frequency of HLA-DRw52 was 79.2% (42 of 53) in the patient group compared with 50.9% (29 of 57) in the control group, and the difference was significant (chi 2 = 9.66, p less than 0.005, pc less than 0.05, relative risk = 3.69). On the other hand, no significant association was found with HLA-A,B,C antigens. When various clinical features of the patients were taken into account, there was a tendency for the frequency of DRw52 to be lower in the patients who were in an advanced stage or who had resisted treatment with steroids. Furthermore, 31 of the 32 patients without ophthalmic involvement were DRw52-positive, which was highly significant (96.9% as compared with 50.9% of the control group; chi 2 = 19.74, p less than 0.001, pc less than 0.01, relative risk = 29.93), whereas the frequency of DRw52 in the patients with ophthalmic involvement was almost the same as in the control group. These results suggest that HLA-DR antigens play a significant role in the pathogenesis of sarcoidosis, and there may be a heterogeneity in the clinical entity of sarcoidosis.\r"

Most of these subjects (24 of 26) had a BAL lymphocytosis. In 1985, we restudied 14 of these subjects. Each subject had a clinical evaluation, chest roentgenogram, pulmonary function tests, and bronchoalveolar lavage. Results show that only 1 subject had evidence of an episode of acute recurrent disease, and only 1 had clinically progressive disease; however, 6 complained of chronic cough and sputum production. There were some fluctuations in individual pulmonary functions, with a significant decrease in FVC during the 2-yr period. The total number of cells on repeated lavage was 55.20 X 10(6) +/- 41.10 X 10(6) (mean +/- SD). This was not statistically different from the results obtained 2 yr earlier (69.5 X 10(6) +/- 43.01 X 10(6)). The percentage of BAL lymphocytes was also similar between the 2 studies, with abnormal values (greater than 20%) in 13 of 14 subjects (47.2 +/- 19.2). The BAL lymphocyte subsets, measured by monoclonal antibody in 8 subjects, showed a wide range of values, with individual OKT4/OKT8 ratios remaining similar at both studies. There were no correlations between changes seen in individual pulmonary function and BAL lymphocytosis. We conclude that a high intensity lymphocytic alveolitis, which persists after an acute episode of farmer's lung, does not predict the outcome of the disease.\r"

However, the clinical relevance of the enumeration of cells in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from patients with IPF remains controversial. We therefore examined the correlations between BALF cellular constituents and both the histopathologic abnormalities and the subsequent clinical response to corticosteroid therapy in 26 newly diagnosed, untreated patients with IPF. The BALF lymphocytosis was associated with moderate-to-severe alveolar septal inflammation (p less than 0.0005) and with a relative lack of histologic honeycombing (p less than 0.05). On the other hand, BALF neutrophil and eosinophil contents did not significantly correlate with any of eleven particular histopathologic abnormalities, and BALF neutrophil and lymphocyte contents did not correlate with the degree of clinical impairment (quantitated by a composite score based on dyspnea, radiographic abnormalities, and physiologic impairment) upon presentation. However, BALF eosinophil content correlated significantly with the severity of clinical impairment, higher eosinophil counts being associated with more severe initial clinical impairment (p less than 0.01). Neither pretreatment BALF neutrophil nor eosinophil content was related to the frequency or magnitude of subsequent clinical change in 20 patients evaluated before and after 1 yr of corticosteroid therapy. In contrast, pretreatment BALF lymphocytosis was associated with significant subsequent clinical improvement (p less than 0.002).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The data show that when a diagnosis of BOOP was made, there was a higher total pathologic score for membraneous bronchiolitis (MB) and respiratory bronchiolitis (RB) than for UIP and SAD (p less than 0.005). This was due to peribronchiolar inflammation and the presence of loose connective tissue in the RB lumen. The pathologic changes in the interstitial space were less severe in SAD than in BOOP or UIP (p less than 0.005). Clubbing was more frequent in UIP (p less than 0.01), and symptoms were of shorter duration in BOOP (p less than 0.05).

  ".W": "Muscarinic cholinergic receptors have been classified into subtypes based on their high (M-1 subtype) or low (M-2 subtype) affinities for the nonclassic antagonist pirenzepine, and this classification has important experimental and therapeutic implications. Because muscarinic receptors are abundant in the airways where they mediate several different cellular responses, the goal of this study was to characterize the affinities of pirenzepine for the muscarinic receptors in bovine tracheal mucosa and smooth muscle. After isolating membrane particulates from mucosa and smooth muscle, as well as from bovine cerebral cortex (a known source of M-1 receptors), we used 3H-quinuclidinyl benzilate to label muscarinic receptors in the particulates and performed competition radioligand binding assays in the presence of either atropine or pirenzepine. Receptors from all 3 tissues (mucosa, smooth muscle, and cerebral cortex) were of a relatively uniform affinity for atropine (range of KI values: 0.8 +/- 0.4 X 10(-9) to 2.4 +/- 1.7 X 10(-9) M), as would be predicted for this classic muscarinic antagonist. By contrast, affinities for pirenzepine differed depending on the tissue. In cerebral cortex, the majority of receptors were of high affinity for pirenzepine (KI = 1.8 +/- 1.4 X 10(-8) M). In both mucosa and smooth muscle, receptors were of low affinity for pirenzepine (Kl = 4.8 +/- 0.4 to 6.9 +/- 3.8 X 10(-7) M). We conclude that muscarinic cholinergic receptors in bovine tracheal mucosa and smooth muscle are predominantly of the M-2 subtype.\r"

  ".W": "We examined the tissue distribution of pentamidine, both as free drug and encapsulated in liposomes, after intravenous (iv) and aerosol administration in healthy rodents. After iv injection, drug levels in the lung were increased as much as 34-fold by administration in liposomes. Concurrently, peak liver uptake was increased 4-fold and renal deposition reduced 3-fold. Liposome-mediated lung delivery was highly dependent on liposome size. Decreasing liposome mean diameter from 2.5 to 0.4 micron reduced lung uptake of pentamidine 90-fold while affecting extrapulmonary organ deposition to a much lesser degree. Aerosol delivery of pentamidine produced high, sustained lung levels, with no evidence of drug clearance from the lung between 1 and 48 h after administration. Extrapulmonary drug levels produced by aerosol delivery were negligible throughout this period. There were no significant differences in the organ distribution of aerosolized free versus liposome-encapsulated drug, apparently because of sequestration of pentamidine within the lung. Comparison of drug levels in material recovered by bronchoalveolar lavage suggests that aerosol delivery of pentamidine produces substantially higher deposition in the alveolar space than does iv drug injection. Light and electron microscopic (EM) examination of lung, kidney, and liver after iv or aerosol administration of liposomes revealed no tissue abnormalities, although isolated platelet clumps were noted in pulmonary capillaries by EM examination.\r"

The 2 delivery systems were studied on separate days using a randomized crossover design. Premetaproterenol pulmonary function results were very similar on both days. However, on the MDI-HC day, significantly greater bronchodilatation was observed; this was only detectable on PEFV maneuvers. Compared with those on the MDI day, postmetaproterenol PEFV rates on the MDI-HC day were approximately 11% higher (p less than 0.02); premetaproterenol to postmetaproterenol increments in PEFV rates were also larger on the MDI-HC day (p less than 0.05). These results can be explained by the phenomenon of airway hysteresis. The deep breath taken prior to performance of the FVC maneuver reduced bronchomotor tone in almost all subjects, thereby limiting the magnitude of possible change from inhaled bronchodilator. Partial flow-volume curves were not preceded by deep inspiration and were more sensitive in detecting bronchodilatation.\r"

Interstitial pneumonitis, though, is known to occur under such circumstances, but its pathogenesis is still debated between an infectious and a hypersensitivity mechanism. We report here 3 cases of pulmonary complications of BCG therapy evaluated by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). Cellular data obtained from all 3 patients were characterized by a markedly increased alveolar lymphocytosis. The T4/T8 ratio was elevated compared with that in normal subjects and with the T4/T8 ratio of circulating lymphocytes. Furthermore, alveolar lymphocytes were highly sensitized to PPD, as evaluated by their proliferation and their production of interleukin 2 in the presence of PPD. Mycobacteria were not found in the 3 patients. We conclude that interstitial pneumonitis occurring during BCG therapy could be explained by a hypersensitivity phenomenon, leading to an intense immune and lymphocyte-mediated response within involved organs.\r"

The literature was reviewed, and 209 patients 16.5 years or younger were found. All ten patients at Vanderbilt University Hospital (VUH) presented with endocrine manifestations of the tumor. Three patients had Cushing's, two patients had virilization, and five patients had features of both. In the literature, virilization, alone or with Cushing's, was the most common mode of presentation. Feminizing tumors were uncommon and nonfunctional tumors rare. The majority of patients were female. Features associated with malignancy included 17-KS levels greater than 40 mg/24 hr, diameter greater than 6 cm, weight greater than 500 g, and histologic evidence of diffuse growth pattern, vascular invasion, and tumor cell necrosis. Although uncommon, adrenocortical neoplasms should be suspected in children with Cushing's, virilization, feminization, or a combination of these. There has been an increased incidence reported in patients with hemihypertrophy, Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, hemangiomas, and nevi. Following endocrinologic evaluation, imaging studies should be performed. CT scan appears to be the most useful diagnostic tool. A posterior operative approach is recommended for suspected adenomas. An anterior thoracoabdominal approach is favored for suspected malignancies with uncompromised en bloc resection. There is no evidence that adjuvant therapy provides any additional benefit.\r"

Esophagectomy was possible in 89 patients (34%) and was associated with a 32 per cent mortality. This study updates the authors' experience with squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus in 311 patients seen from 1966 to 1985. Overall 5-year survival has increased to 6 per cent. Esophageal resection was accomplished in 104 patients (33%), with a 10 per cent operative mortality and 41 per cent complication rate. Multi-variant analysis disclosed that smoking, alcohol use, sex, race, and site of tumor did not influence survival. Actuarial survival rates following esophageal resection were 51 per cent at 1 year, 21 per cent at 2 years, and 13 per cent at 5 years. These survival rates were not influenced by adjuvant radiotherapy. Radiation therapy was used for attempted cure in 83 patients. Actuarial survival rates following curative doses of radiation were 29 per cent at 1 year, 15 per cent at 2 years, and 4 per cent at 5 years. These survival rates were significantly (P less than 0.001) lower than survival rates following esophagectomy. The quality of life following treatment was good or fair in 83 per cent of patients undergoing esophagectomy and good or fair in 64 per cent of patients receiving \"curative\" doses of radiation. The results of this review demonstrate that esophageal resection using the Lewis operation or transhiatal esophagectomy can be done with an acceptable operative mortality, results in prolonged survival, and improves the quality of life.\r"

There were 25 men and 20 women; the average age was 29.3 years. Twenty-six patients (57.7%) presented with pain, 19 reported a change in bowel habits, and 18 had gastrointestinal bleeding which led to diagnostic investigation. At the time of diagnosis, only two patients had lesions which could be classified as Dukes' A, eight were Dukes' B, 28 were Dukes' C, and the remaining seven had Dukes' D lesions with distant metastasis. Nineteen patients had poorly differentiated tumors; survival in this group averaged 1 year. In the 19 patients who had well or moderately well-differentiated tumors, survival averaged 4.3 years. Fifteen patients had unresectable tumors at the time of initial treatment, and survival in this group has averaged 1.5 years. Thirty patients had tumors which were considered to be resectable by the operating surgeon, and nine of these 30 patients are alive without evidence of recurrence for an average of 5.6 years. The prognosis of carcinoma of the colon in the young has been poor, with the major factors being the unfavorable histologic features of these tumors and the advanced disease at the time of presentation in these patients. Those few patients who present early in the course of their disease respond well to radical resection.\r"

Cecal, ascending, hepatic, and transverse lesions were most often associated with stage IV disease. Among the 1115 patients with long-term follow-up, 44 per cent with stage I disease, 37 per cent with stage II disease, 24 per cent with stage III disease, and 6 per cent with stage IV disease had survived for 5 years or longer. There were no differences when 5-year survival was correlated with site. This review provided no evidence that wide resection leads to increased long-term survival.\r"

The average age was 41.8 years, excluding two newborns with a congenital granular cell myoblastoma of the gingiva. The most common site of occurrence was the skin; seven tumors originated from the trunk and five from the extremities. Four lesions were found in the breast, three on the vulva, two in the axilla, two in the gum, two in the buccal cavity, two in the esophagus, and one each in the stomach, gluteus muscle, eyelid, and bronchus. Two patients had multiple synchronous lesions. These were bilateral hand lesions in one patient, and lesions of the breast and axilla in the other. A third patient had three separate lesions which arose over the course of 5 years, involving the bronchus, the gluteus muscle, and the buccal mucosa. An additional esophageal lesion was an incidental finding 3 years after excision of a granular cell tumor of the breast. All of the tumors were removed with local, simple excision, except for the 2-cm lesion in the stomach for which a wedge resection of the fundus was necessary and the bronchial lesion for which a wedge resection of the left upper lobe of the lung was performed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Patient's ages ranged from 34 to 84 years, with a mean of 56.2 years. One patient was excluded from analysis because thoracotomy with a pulmonary resection was performed during the same hospitalization. Thirty-seven patients underwent total mastectomy with complete axillary dissection, 30 underwent segmental mastectomy with complete axillary dissection, and five underwent total mastectomy alone. For each patient the chest wall and axilla were drained by means of one or two Jackson-Pratt (American Heyer Schulte Corp., Goleta, CA) closed suction drains. Prior to discharge, all patients were instructed in the proper technique of drain care and were directed to record the daily drainage. Patients were discharged when they were fully mobile, did not require injectable narcotics, and felt capable of taking care of the drains as outpatients. The length of postoperative stay ranged from 1 to 9 days (mean 2.9), with all but three patients being discharged by the fifth postoperative day. Patient acceptance of early discharge with drains was excellent. Drains were pulled on an outpatient basis, usually within 7 to 10 days after surgery. Complications were observed in twelve patients (18%), consisting of seromas (8 patients), cellulitis (2 patients), and minimal superficial skin necrosis (2 patients). All complications were managed easily on an outpatient basis. We conclude that early discharge with Jackson-Pratt drains remaining in place is safe, well tolerated by patients, and has tremendous potential for substantial cost savings.\r"

The authors found 22 patients who were operated on for gastric cancer between 1979 and 1982. Ages ranged from 69 to 90 years of age. The male-to-female ratio was 1:1. Twenty of 22 patients were found to have carcinoma. Eleven of 20 had regional spread to the perigastric nodes, transverse colon, omentum, spleen, and liver. Stage of disease was: stage I--four patients, stage II--five patients, stage III--eight patients, and stage IV--three patients. Two of 22 patients had lymphoma. The mean hospital stay was 17.1 days, but decreased to 12.4 days if no complications occurred. Postoperative complications were minimal and included pneumonia, urinary tract infection, wound infection, and dumping syndrome. There were two postoperative deaths (9%) due to sepsis and myocardial infarction, respectively. Six of the remaining 18 patients died within 1 year. Seven of 18 were alive after 2 years, and six patients survived greater than 36 months (33%). Of the six long-term survivors, two had stage III and one had stage IV disease at the initial exploration. The average survival was 23.5 months. The authors conclude that gastric resection should not be withheld in the elderly.

On follow-up, the risk of developing lung cancer was found to be associated with entry values for age, smoking, and ventilatory status by linear, proportional hazard, and log-linear adjustment techniques. Among cigarette smokers, the presence of airways obstruction was more of an indicator for the subsequent development of lung cancer than was age or the level of smoking. The risk for lung cancer also increased in proportion to the degree of airways obstruction. These data suggest that smokers with ventilatory obstruction are at greater risk for lung cancer than are smokers without obstruction.\r"

To act as prototypes, reactors were prepared with immobilized L-phenylalanine ammonia-lyase, an enzyme that metabolizes phenylalanine to trans-cinnamic acid and ammonia without the need for a coenzyme. We report the first application of phenylalanine ammonia-lyase reactors in an extracorporeal circulation system in a patient with phenylketonuria. A phenylalanine level of 1.82 mmol/L (for the last 6 years) decreased to 1.24 mmol/L after 5.5. hours of treatment, without the enzyme entering the circulation. Total phenylalanine depletion from blood and tissue stores was estimated at 1800 mg. The hemodialysis-like procedure proved to be without side effects, specific for phenylalanine, and suitable in the management of pregnant women with phenylketonuria and late-onset hyperphenylalaninemia. The extracorporeal use of enzyme reactors for temporary enzyme replacement represents a new, safe, and effective therapeutic modality.\r"

Fifty-seven percent of the males died of infectious mononucleosis, 29% developed acquired hypogammaglobulinemia, and 24% had malignant lymphoma. The mortality rate was 80%; 70% died by 10 years of age and 100% by 40 years. Thirty-two boys survive, most with malignant lymphoma, acquired hypogammaglobulinemia, or both. We hypothesized that the defective lymphoproliferative control locus on the X chromosome results in unregulated cytotoxic lymphocytic responses to the Epstein-Barr virus; hence, severe hepatitis and virus-associated hemophagocytic syndrome occur with the infectious mononucleosis phenotype. T-cell suppression of immunoglobulin secretion by B cells is responsible for acquired hypogammaglobulinemia. A sustained polyclonal B-cell proliferation probably converts to a monoclonal B-cell malignancy as a result of molecular alterations.\r"

Smoking is known to accelerate the metabolism of theophylline, but the effects of short-term abstinence or nicotine gum on theophylline metabolism have not been reported. We studied the effects of brief tobacco abstinence and nicotine gum on theophylline elimination in healthy volunteers. Abstinence from smoking for 1 week resulted in a 37.6% decrease in clearance and a 35.8% increase in half-life. Nicotine gum had no effect on theophylline clearance. Our data indicate that at least partial normalization of the enzyme-inducing effects of smoking can be seen after brief cigarette abstinence. For smokers who are taking theophylline chronically, their dose of theophylline will need to be reduced by one fourth to one third after brief tobacco abstinence. Plasma concentration monitoring may be necessary for optimal dosing of theophylline in such patients.\r"

In the chest-pain group, 655 patients (72%) had normal esophageal motility and 255 (28%) had abnormal motility. Nutcracker esophagus was present in 48% of abnormal tracings, suggesting that it is a manometric marker for noncardiac chest pain. Of the total chest-pain group, 243 patients (27%) had their pain reproduced during provocative testing (\"definite\" esophageal pain); 192 patients (21%) had baseline manometric abnormalities but no pain during provocative testing (\"probable\" esophageal chest pain). The highest percentage of positive provocative responses (34%) occurred in patients with nutcracker esophagus on baseline manometry. Manometric abnormalities were statistically commoner (p less than 0.001) in patients with dysphagia, occurring in 53%.

We defined risk status on the basis of blood pressure, smoking habit, and high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol level. For persons aged 20 to 60 years who are at low risk, we calculate a gain in life expectancy of 3 days to 3 months from a lifelong program of cholesterol reduction. For persons who are at high risk, the calculated gain ranges from 18 days to 12 months. Knowledge of the magnitude of the calculated benefits in increased life expectancy afforded by cholesterol reduction can assist persons in making decisions about dietary change.\r"

In the remaining eight patients, carcinoembryonic antigen levels remained at or returned to normal values and no clinical evidence of progression of the disease was detected. These results suggest that although serum carcinoembryonic antigen estimation is not a reliable diagnostic screening test for choroidal malignant melanoma, it may be useful for follow-up and monitoring of recurrences of the disease.\r"

In addition, the other two patients regained significant vision to 20/80 or better with a modified treatment regimen of acetazolamide, inhalation of 5% CO2 and 95% O2, and aspirin. No foveola-sparing cilioretinal arteries were present in any of the cases. We introduce the concept of reversible retinal ischemia following unsustained CRAO to account for these unexpected improvements in visual acuity.\r"

We have studied a subgroup of nine dysthyroid patients in whom the eyelid retraction occurs as a relative malposition of the globe and eyelid due to inferior rectus restriction. Our explanation of this phenomenon in nine patients is based on Hering's law. Increased innervation required for a fixating superior rectus muscle to overcome a severely restricted inferior rectus muscle causes an unrestricted levator muscle to open the eyelid abnormally wide relative to the globe. The retraction is best demonstrated with fixation of the involved eye. We have performed inferior rectus recession to correct this type of eyelid retraction in three of our patients.\r"

Two control subjects were matched to each patient, and for both patients and control subjects, the unique records-linkage system for residents of Rochester was used to obtain information about possible risk factors. A history of epilepsy or febrile seizures in the mother, febrile seizures, neonatal convulsions, cerebral palsy, head trauma, and viral encephalitis were significantly more common in patients than in control subjects (p less than 0.05). None of the prenatal or perinatal factors investigated were found to be associated with complex partial seizures, except for being small for gestational age at birth. This factor lost significance after adjustment for cerebral palsy.\r"

The 8 men, 6 of whom were homosexual, and 1 woman, a former intravenous drug user, presented with progressive weakness. Two had lymphadenopathy but all were otherwise asymptomatic. Six had chronic IDP and 3 had Guillain-Barre syndrome. In addition to an elevated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) protein level (mean, 193 mg/dl), most patients had cerebrospinal fluid pleocytosis (mean, 23 cells/mm3), a distinctive feature. All had reduced T4:T8 T-cell ratios. Results of nerve conduction studies were characteristic of demyelination. Nerve biopsies revealed intense inflammatory cell infiltrates and macrophage-mediated demyelination. The patients recovered either spontaneously or following treatment with corticosteroids or plasmapheresis. During a mean interval of 20 months after presentation, only 1 patient had developed acquired immune deficiency syndrome. Patients with HTLV-III infection have disordered immune function, and the mechanism of the development of the IDP is likely to be immunopathogenic. As a result of our experience, we suggest that all patients with IDP be tested for evidence of HTLV-III infection. We also found, although in uncontrolled trials, that treatment with either prednisone or plasmapheresis was followed by clinical improvement; since plasmapheresis is not likely to further depress cell-mediated immunity, we suggest that it be the initial therapy.\r"

  ".W": "The underlying mechanisms responsible for advanced Parkinson's disease's becoming refractory to dopamimetic therapies are unclear. Postmortem brain studies indicate that patients with Parkinson's disease have decreased basal ganglia gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) function in addition to profound striatal dopamine (DA) deficiencies. In experimental animals, GABA-utilizing striatal and nigral projection neurons appear to mediate motor behaviors arising from the stimulation of striatal DA receptors by agonists. We have examined the ability of directly and indirectly acting GABA-mimetic drugs to alter turning behavior elicited by administering apomorphine, a DA agonist, to rats with unilateral lesions of dopaminergic nigrostriatal neurons. Low doses of directly acting postsynaptic GABA agonists (progabide, 4,5,6,7-tetrahydroisoxazolo[5,4-c]pyridin--3-01) or a neuronal GABA transport inhibitor (SKF 100330-A) potentiate apomorphine-induced turning. Higher doses of these agents or acute inhibition of GABA catabolism inhibits turning. Our results suggest that low doses of certain GABA mimetics will improve the responses of patients with Parkinson's disease to concurrent DA receptor agonist therapy.\r"

All monkeys given 20 mg/kg of guanethidine, guanacline, or SAG showed a marked loss of neurons in the ganglia of the peripheral sympathetic nervous system. Treatment of macaques with 2 mg/kg of the guanidinium compounds resulted in patches of small-cell infiltrate, slight neuronal loss, and degenerative alterations in the sympathetic ganglia. Neuronal alterations in sympathetic ganglia of all treated monkeys were accompanied by a prominent heterogeneous infiltrate of mononuclear cells arranged primarily in a perivascular distribution and extending into the ganglionic neuropil. Peripheral sensory ganglia were unaffected. These histological findings are similar to those described in the guanethidine-induced immune-mediated sympathectomy, which has been extensively studied in the rat.\r"

Tobacco-induced nystagmus exhibited a latency of onset at 40 to 90 seconds, a duration of 10 to 20 minutes, and maximum slow-phase velocities at 2 to 3 minutes. We suggest that tobacco induces primary-position upbeat nystagmus through the excitatory effects of nicotine on the central vestibular pathways.\r"

  ".W": "Poliovirus is a neurotropic virus that selectively infects human motoneurons in vivo. The basis for the specificity of this infection is not fully understood. It has been suggested that this tropism occurs because motoneurons are the only neurons to express poliovirus receptors. We have examined this hypothesis by measuring the binding of 125I-labeled poliovirus type 1 to neural tissues. With this assay we have detected highly specific binding sites in human but not rodent neural tissue. Regional assays of binding in human central nervous system homogenates demonstrate that binding sites are not confined to motoneurons. Rather, they are widely distributed throughout the human neuraxis. Particularly in the forebrain, binding is more abundant in gray than white matter. For this reason, we performed tissue fractionation studies which indicate that poliovirus binding sites are enriched in synaptosomes, the subfraction of central nervous system gray matter tissue rich in synaptic endings. The preferential expression of poliovirus binding sites in synaptic endings may be an important factor in the motor tropism of this virus, inasmuch as the major category of neurons with synaptic endings outside the central nervous system are motoneurons; thus, particles of virus may preferentially bind to this cell type during poliovirus viremia.\r"

Static quantitative perimetry, flicker-fusion frequency, visual acuity, and videotaped neurological examinations were performed. Ten of the 12 patients showed mild to marked improvement. Vision improved in 7 patients, oculomotor function in 5, and motor function (power, coordination, gait) in 5. Improvements developed gradually within minutes of drug injection at doses as low as 2 mg, and gradually reversed around 2 to 4 hours after the peak drug effect. No effects were observed in 5 patients given saline injections. No serious side effects occurred in either the normal subjects or the patients receiving 4-AP. It is concluded that 4-AP lessens multiple neurological deficits in multiple sclerosis and, furthermore, that the K+ channel is functional in demyelinated central nervous system axons in humans. The improvements with 4-AP are substantial enough to be of transient therapeutic benefit in selected patients.\r"

The clinical diagnoses included uremic encephalopathy (2 patients), dysequilibrium syndrome (1), dialysis dementia (1), and brainstem hemorrhage (1). At postmortem examination, classic findings of WE were evident. The rarity of WE in patients on dialysis may in part be explained by studies indicating a genetic defect in transketolase activity. Patients on dialysis are also potentially at risk for thiamine deficiency because of anorexia, vomiting, and intravenous alimentation. Other factors altering thiamine requirements, such as glucose load or infections, may also contribute. Preventable and potentially curable, WE should be suspected in all patients on dialysis who have an unexplained neurological picture.\r"
