Magnesium-ATPase and alkaline phosphatase were normal in biopsy homogenates. Decreased activity of colonic sodium-potassium-ATPase may contribute to diarrhoea in some patients with tropical sprue.\r"

Clear bile ducts were shown in 99, of whom only 12 had diverticula (12%) (p less than 0.05). After allowing for the differences in age between the two groups, patients with choledocholithiasis were 2.6 times (95% CI: 1.14-5.93) more likely to have a periampullary diverticulum than patients without choledocholithiasis. In the remaining 80 patients, cholangiography was either not successful or not indicated. Further clinical follow up and/or investigation have failed to reveal duct stones in any and only 10 (13%) of these 80 patients had diverticula. Overall, 47 patients had diverticula: 25 (53%) had duct stones, four may have had stones and 18 had none. Three or more years after cholecystectomy 59% of patients with duct stones had diverticula, while only 13% with clear ducts had them. These results show a significant association between periampullary duodenal diverticula and choledocholithiasis.\r"

Rabbits received 2% (w/v) DFMO in drinking water for two days before undergoing a sham laparotomy, or a 90 minute mesenteric vascular occlusion of 20 cm of mid-intestine. DFMO fed and control rabbits were studied four, 24, 72, or 120 hours after this ischaemic intestinal injury. In controls, ischaemic injury caused shortened villi at four hours (p less than 0.01), diminished mucosal sucrase and alkaline phosphatase activities at 24 hours (p less than 0.05), but raised ODC (p less than 0.001) and thymidine kinase (p less than 0.01) activities at four hours with recovery by 72 hours. DFMO treatment significantly reduced ODC activity at all stages of the experiment and significantly inhibited the rise in activity observed after injury (p less than 0.01). Mucosal concentrations of the polyamines, spermidine and spermine, were similar in the sham operated groups; four hours and 24 hours after ischaemia, they increased in the DFMO animals (p less than 0.01) but fell (p less than 0.05) in those that did not receive DFMO. After ischaemic injury, DFMO treatment inhibited ODC but failed to influence recovery of villus structure or enzyme activities in the small intestine. We conclude that ODC and the polyamines, spermidine and spermine, are not key regulators of small intestinal repair after transient ischaemia.\r"

Samples from six children with CF failed to respond when challenged with the intestinal secretagogues acetylcholine (10(-3) M), prostaglandin E2 (1.4 X 10(-6) M) and dibutyryl cyclic AMP (10(-3) M), while control tissues exhibited rises in short circuit current of 28.1 (7.4) (6) microA/cm2, 23.4 (4.6) (6) microA/cm2 and 10.0 (2.0) (4) microA/cm2 respectively in response to these agents. The calcium ionophore, A23187 (3.8 X 10(-6) M), increased the short circuit current in all the control tissues (mean change = 10.1 (2.7) (5) microA/cm2) and induced a small response in some of the CF tissues. Both groups of tissues generated a rise in short circuit current associated with sodium linked glucose (10 mM/l) absorption (control = 32.6 (9.3) (6) microA/cm2, CF = 36.2 (13.9) (6) microA/cm2, p greater than 0.05). These results show that the defect in chloride transport observed in other epithelia in CF also exists in the jejunum and could contribute to the intestinal effects of the disease. The technique used should permit further studies of the basic defect and may be of diagnostic value.\r"

On the experimental day, subjects received sequential 15-minute intravenous infusions of angiotensin II in doses of 4, 8, and 16 pmol/kg/min. Following a 30-minute recovery period, subjects received sequential 15-minute infusions of phenylephrine in doses of 0.4 and 0.8 micrograms/kg/min. Right atrial pressure, mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, pulmonary artery pressure, mean systemic arterial pressure, and plasma levels of renin activity, aldosterone, angiotensin II, and immunoreactive ANF were obtained sequentially throughout the protocol. During the control day, vehicle was infused and plasma samples were obtained for hormone measurements. Infusion of angiotensin II and phenylephrine increased mean systemic arterial pressure in a stepwise fashion. Both right atrial pressure and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure increased significantly during both doses of phenylephrine, but only the highest dose of angiotensin II significantly increased atrial pressures. Plasma levels of immunoreactive ANF increased parallel with the changes in right atrial pressure and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, with significant increases occurring only at the highest dose of both pressors. Angiotensin II and aldosterone levels increased and renin activity decreased during infusion of angiotensin II. There were no significant changes in plasma levels of immunoreactive ANF during the control day. These studies demonstrate that infusion of vasopressors increases plasma levels of ANF, but only when the vasopressor effect is associated with significant increases in right atrial and pulmonary capillary wedge pressures. Atrial stretch is the most likely mediator of the increase in plasma levels of immunoreactive ANF during vasoconstriction.\r"

We also measured [3H]ouabain binding by myocardium and vascular tissue. Fresh, unprocessed plasma from healthy dogs during the first 6 weeks of benign one-kidney, one wrapped hypertension and from paired normotensive control dogs was layered over confluent primary cultured puppy aortic smooth muscle cells that had been sodium-loaded with monensin. In 26 paired assays of plasma from four pairs of dogs, cells incubated in the presence of plasma from hypertensive dogs had significantly reduced total (p less than 0.01) and ouabain-sensitive (p less than 0.001) 86Rb+ uptakes, but their intracellular sodium content did not differ from cells incubated in paired normotensive plasma. We no longer detected these uptake differences when passaged cells or cells cocultured with bovine endothelial cells were used for assay or when plasma was treated with protease inhibitors or boiled. However, boiled plasma increased the sodium content of the assay cells, suggesting an ionophorelike effect. Levels of pump inhibitory activity in plasma appeared to remain constant during Weeks 1 to 6 of hypertension. We found no evidence for altered numbers of pump sites in cardiovascular tissues from these hypertensive dogs. These findings support the hypothesis that plasma factors inhibit the membrane Na+-K+ pump in vascular smooth muscle cells in this form of hypertension. These plasma inhibitory factors apparently do not induce pump molecules.\r"

The release of all other fatty acids detected in the effluent was also reduced. The differences in fatty acid release were evident even when tissue levels of the fatty acids were similar or higher in SHR than in controls. The addition of evening primrose oil and fish oil into the diet partially corrected these defects. Evening primrose oil and fish oil both attenuated increases in blood pressure, but fish oil was more potent than primrose oil. Although both diets reduced vascular reactivity, primrose oil was more effective with lower doses of norepinephrine whereas fish oil blunted the effects of both low and high doses of norepinephrine. The possible mechanisms for the effects of primrose oil and fish oil on vascular reactivity are briefly discussed.\r"

  ".W": "In a search for factors contributing to the sustained blood pressure (BP) elevation in acutely volume-loaded animals, dextran dissolved in lactated Ringer's solution (20 ml/kg) was infused into 34 mongrel dogs over a period of 1 hour under pentobarbital anesthesia and changes in hemodynamic and humoral variables were monitored during its infusion and for 3 hours after its infusion. BP elevation during volume loading (from 114 +/- 3 to 128 +/- 3 [SEM] mm Hg) was attributed to an increase in cardiac output. After volume loading, some dogs maintained BP elevation whereas others did not. The former group showed an increase in total peripheral resistance, demonstrating a transformation of cardiac output to total peripheral resistance as a responsible factor in maintenance of the elevated BP. The plasma levels of norepinephrine, vasopressin, and plasma renin activity were not elevated, indicating that these vasoactive factors were not responsible for elevation of the BP or total peripheral resistance. The changes in the hematocrit, atrial natriuretic factor, urine volume, and urinary sodium excretion were identical in the two groups, and natriuresis was not prominent when total peripheral resistance was high. Pressor responses to norepinephrine and angiotensin II were potentiated 3 hours after stopping infusion in both groups, but this potentiation was not correlated with the increase in total peripheral resistance or mean BP. Thus, acute volume expansion produced resistance-dependent hypertension following the initial volume-dependent hypertension. It is unlikely that a vascular sensitizing natriuretic factor plays a role in the resistance-dependent BP elevation. The mechanism and physiological importance of hypersensitivity to vasoactive substances remain to be elucidated.\r"

IFN-gamma did not impair the transcriptional activation of c-myc gene, and it had only a slight destabilizing effect on the mature c-myc message.

Of the 68 residues, 4 are cysteines, and there are no sites for N-linked glycosylation. RANTES is expressed by cultured T cell lines that are Ag specific and growth factor dependent. RANTES expression is inducible in PBL by Ag or mitogen. In CTL, expression of RANTES decreases after stimulation with Ag and growth factors. Interestingly, RANTES was not expressed by any T cell tumor line tested. There is significant homology between the RANTES sequence and several other T cell genes, suggesting that they comprise a previously undescribed family of small T cell molecules.\r"

To initiate molecular genetic analysis of 96-kDa MAA, the gene encoding the Ag was transfected into mouse B16 melanoma cell clone B78H1. Formation of B78H1-transfectant colonies expressing a surface Ag reactive with mAb CL203.4 in an immunorosetting assay was dependent on addition of chromosomal DNA from human melanoma cells [primary (1 degree) transfer] or from Ag-expressing transfectant cells (2 degrees, 3 degrees, 4 degrees transfer). The mAb CL203.4-reactive species expressed by the transfectant cells is a glycoprotein with a molecular mass 93-kDa, within the range of 93 to 96-kDa observed for the endogenous human Ag. In the presence of tunicamycin, an inhibitor of N-linked glycosylation, both mouse melanoma transfectants and human melanoma cells express a 50- to 51-kDa antigenic species. Human alu family repeat sequences (h-alu) are present in the genomes of 3 degrees transfectant cells. Continued presence of these h-alu after dilution of extraneous human DNA by three cycles of transfection suggests their association with the transferred 96-kDa MAA gene. Use of a selective co-amplification procedure led to transfectant cells' increased expression of 96-kDa MAA and to commensurate increases in their content of presumed 96-kDa MAA gene-associated h-alu. Preferential DNA-mediated transferability of the 96-kDa MAA+ phenotype into B78H1 cells as compared with LMTK- mouse fibroblasts suggests host cell specificity of 96-kDa MAA gene expression.\r"

In this study, we have used mAb specific for Thy-1, J11d, Pgp-1, and the IL-2R, in addition to those for Lyt-2 and L3T4, to identify subpopulations of early fetal thymocytes. By using two-color flow cytometric analysis of cells obtained from fetal thymuses on sequential days of gestation, we have been able to follow the development of various subpopulations through early fetal ontogeny.

  ".W": "Antibodies specific for the immunizing Ag (Ab1) (Id+ Ag+) and Ab3 (Id+ Ag+ or Id+ Ag-) of the (Glu60 Tyr10 Ala30) (GAT) idiotypic cascade express similar pGAT public determinants in BALB/c and C57BL/6 strains. These determinants have been shown to be dependent upon both VH and Vkappa encoded segments. The VH of the BALB/c Ab1 (germ-line gene H10) and that of the C57BL/6 Ab1 (germ-line gene V186-2) are only 75% homologous, whereas VK are much more conserved. C57BL/6 mice were immunized with BALB/c Ab2 (anti-idiotypic) antibodies and monoclonal Ab3 were derived after fusion of immunized spleen cells with the nonsecreting hybridoma cell line Sp/2.0-Ag. From 13 cell lines, five clones (four Id+ Ag- and one Id+ Ag+) were isolated and the mRNA V regions sequenced. Immunization with BALB/c anti-idiotypes elicits expression of the same or closely related C57BL/6 VH and Vkappa genes as when C57BL/6 mice were immunized with GAT, although functional VH BALB/c equivalents have been isolated in the B6 strain. Our results suggest that manipulation of the repertoire via antigenic or idiotypic stimulation both lead to the expression of different genes in different strains. They further confirm that the immune system is largely degenerate, for both idiotype expression and Ag recognition.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of injections of bacterial LPS on the expression of class I and II products of the MHC in mouse tissues was investigated. MHC products were assessed in tissue homogenates by radiolabeled antibody binding and in tissue sections by indirect immunoperoxidase (IIP) staining. In mice given two i.p. injections of LPS from Escherichia coli or Salmonella minnesota, there were increases in class I and II MHC products in kidney, liver, heart, lung, and pancreas. Focusing on the changes in kidney, we demonstrated that the increase in MHC expression occurred in tubules and, in the case of class I, in glomeruli. LPS treatment also increased the deposition of Ig in glomeruli. Expressed on a standard curve, the total kidney class I and II expression was elevated approximately 10-fold. Time course studies indicated that increased class I expression could be induced by a single LPS injection, whereas class II induction required a second injection. The induction was influenced by the LPS sensitivity of the mice, being much greater in LPS-sensitive C3H/HeSn mice than in LPS-resistant C3H/HeJ mice. LPS induced class I and II Ag in nude mice and in mice with severe combined immunodeficiency, indicating that T cells were not required. Nevertheless, the effect of LPS was inhibitable by cyclosporine and by a mAb against IFN-gamma indicating that IFN-gamma was required for the MHC induction. We conclude that LPS induces an increase in expression and a redistribution of MHC products in kidney and in other tissues by a T cell-independent, cyclosporine-sensitive pathway. These findings are probably related to the known ability of LPS to mediate release of IFN-gamma and other cytokines.\r"

Our own previous investigations have shown that the decreased IL-2 secretion capacity in vitro of CD4+ cells in SLE is restored to normal when the cells are rested for a few days in culture. This suggested the presence of activated, exhausted T cells in the circulation. In this study, we report several observations concerning T cell function in SLE. 1) Decreased IL-2 secretion in vitro of PBL was found to correlate significantly with increased spontaneous IgG secretion of such cells; immunosuppressive treatment of 22 patients with steroids plus cyclosporin A led, to a large extent, to a correction of both abnormalities. 2) 9 of 18 patients with active disease (and low IL-2 secretion in vitro) had increased IL-2 levels in serum by ELISA; two sera contained IL-2 biologic activity, and chromatography of one serum showed IL-2 in a high molecular size complex (Mr approximately 50,000) dissociable with 6 M urea. The serum levels of IL-2R were also frequently increased, even in less active SLE. 3) In cell culture experiments, the IgG secretion by purified B cells from 6 of 9 patients with active SLE was increased by autologous T cells acting either alone (3 patients) or synergistically with rIL-2 (3 patients); the B cells from all 9 patients showed increased IL-2 responsiveness compared with blood donor B cells. Taken together, these results provide new evidence that increased T cell activation occurs and plays a role in SLE.\r"

  ".W": "In the present study, we have investigated the ability of human T cells to secrete IL-2, IL-4, and IFN-gamma. IL-4 and IFN-gamma were quantified with enzymatic immunoassays and IL-2 with a biologic assay by using the murine IL-2-dependent cell line CTLL-2. PBL, stimulated with Con A or with a combination of the phorbol ester 13-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-12-acetate and the Ca2+ ionophore A23187 secreted IL-2, IL-4, and IFN-gamma. The kinetics of the secretion of the three lymphokines was investigated with two CD4+ clones; one (GEO-2) that produced IL-2, IL-4, and IFN-gamma and another (HY640), that produced only IL-2 and IFN-gamma. Significant IL-2, IL-4, and IFN-gamma production was observed after only 8 h of activation. Maximal levels of IL-2 and IL-4 were found 20 h after the onset of the stimulation which subsequently decreased. In contrast, IFN-gamma levels continued to increase in a period up to 40 h and then leveled off. In spite of these differences in secretion, the kinetics of accumulation of mRNA did not differ. The IL-2, IL-4, and IFN-gamma mRNA were detectable 2 h after stimulation and continued to accumulate for a period up to 20 h. In a series of 22 CD4+ clones, 21 were able to secrete all three lymphokines upon stimulation. Almost all CD8+ clones were able to produce IL-2 and IFN-gamma, but only six of the 23 CD8+ T cell clones secreted IL-4. In addition, five CD4+ (allo)antigen-specific T cell clones were tested for IL-2, IL-4, and IFN-gamma secretion upon specific stimulation. Two alloantigen-specific and two tetanus toxoid-specific T cell clones secreted IL-2, IL-4, and IFN-gamma simultaneously, whereas one alloantigen-specific T cell clone secreted IL-2 and IFN-gamma, but not IL-4. A supernatant of the CD4+ T cell clone GEO-2, that contained high levels of IFN-gamma and IL-4, was unable to induce the low affinity receptor for IgE, CD23, on a Burkitt lymphoma cell line. However, after separation of IL-4 from IFN-gamma by using HPLC, the IL-4-containing fraction-induced CD23, which could be blocked by the fraction that contained IFN-gamma and by a polyclonal rabbit anti-IL-4 antiserum. Finally, the partly purified IL-4, that was devoid of IL-2, promoted the growth of the clone GEO-2.\r"

The data obtained revealed coordinate expression of IFN-gamma- and A6C5-binding capacity as well as competition in binding to chromosome 6-positive hybrids and normal cells, indicating that the A6C5-defined protein is by itself capable of high affinity IFN-gamma binding and, thus, is likely to constitute the major IFN-gamma R protein of distinct cell types. The receptor gene could be allocated to region 6q16 to 6q22, which also contains the c-ros oncogene. Genetic linkage of the IFN-gamma R gene to an oncogene located in a region of non-random chromosomal aberrations may have a causal relationship to the deregulated IFN-gamma R expression in several malignancies.\r"

All three of the lipid A varieties induced the production of TNF in a dose-dependent manner. Although comparable peak levels of TNF were produced (5 X 10(5) to 1 X 10(6) U/ml), treatments with LPS or diphosphoryl lipid A were lethal whereas those with MPL were not. A study following TNF in the mouse sera for up to 24 h after treatment with the lipid A types showed that serum levels of TNF peaked 90 min after the treatment, and that TNF levels induced by LPS treatment were maintained for several hours longer than those induced by lipid A or MPL. All three molecules also resulted in the production of IFN-gamma in the serum, which peaked at 4 to 5 h after treatment. After 90 min there were no significant differences in the levels of serum IFN-gamma in any of the groups of treated animals. However, as was observed with the TNF, the levels of IFN in animals treated with LPS persisted longer than those induced by MPL or lipid A. These results suggest that the non-toxic MPL as well as the toxic forms of lipid A can induce the production of TNF by macrophages. Furthermore, although it is essential, TNF alone is not necessarily sufficient to induce septic shock in mice.\r"

Activity of LK for induction of this activated macrophage effector function is abrogated by depleting the LK of IFN-gamma, yet IFN-gamma is incapable of inducing the activity by itself. To identify the factors in LK that serve as second signals for induction of resistance to infection, we exposed macrophages to the following cytokines available as recombinant or highly purified reagents: CSF-1, granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), IL-1, -2, -3, -4, and -5, and IFN-alpha/beta. None of these factors induced resistance to infection by themselves or in combination with each other; in the presence of 50 U/ml IFN-gamma, three cytokines were active: GM-CSF, IL-2, and IL-4. IFN-gamma was an essential component of the activation cascade but was insufficient by itself to induce the effector reaction. Cytokines that act as cofactors with IFN-gamma worked directly on macrophages and not through another cell in the peritoneal cell (PC) cultures. Activation of PC depleted of Thy-1.2+ cells (85 +/- 5% macrophages) and bone marrow-derived macrophages (100% macrophages) showed that 50% maximal doses of GM-CSF, IL-2, and IL-4 for these macrophage-enriched populations were not different than for untreated PC. Unlike other effector reactions of activated macrophages, bacterial LPS did not synergistically enhance the activity of any of the cytokines, alone or in combination with IFN-gamma. Antibody depletion of the active cytokines from LK, singly or in combination, failed to alter the dose response of the active factors in whole LK for induction of resistance to infection. Thus, multiple factors can provide the second signal for IFN-gamma in the induction of resistance to infection, namely, GM-CSF, IL-2, IL-4, and at least two additional undefined factors in whole LK. Resistance to infection may be the first example of an activated macrophage effector reaction that has an absolute requirement for more than one endogenous signal for its induction.\r"

After in vitro incubation with IFN-gamma the melanoma cell line MeWo did not acquire reactivity with anti-HLA class II antibodies, whereas its metastatic variant MeM 50-10 did. The differential susceptibility to induction of HLA class II Ag on the two cell lines cannot be accounted for by either differences in the number and affinity of IFN-gamma receptors or in the sensitivity to IFN-gamma, but most likely reflects an intrinsic property of each cell line. Serologic and immunochemical investigations with anti HLA-DR, DQ, and DP mAb have indicated that only HLA-DR Ag are induced by IFN-gamma on MeM 50-10 cells. Northern blot analysis with HLA-DR beta, DQ beta, and DP beta probes suggest that different mechanisms underlie the differential susceptibility to induction by IFN-gamma of the gene products of the HLA-D region. The regulatory mechanism(s) that control the expression of HLA class II Ag appear to be different from those controlling the expression of the melanoma-associated Ag tested, inasmuch as the modulation of the latter by IFN-gamma did not differ on the two melanoma cell lines.\r"

The VK-JK recombination site is unusual in that codon 96, normally derived from the JK gene segment, is deleted entirely, making the L3 one amino acid shorter than normal. Examination of the HyHEL-5 Fab-HEL x-ray structure suggests that the conformation of L3 is clearly important for Ag specificity. A comparison of the HyHEL-5 L3 with that of the structurally related antibody J539 indicates that the deleted residue significantly alters the conformation of the L3 turn. The H chain VH-DH join is also unusual; the VH junction site has probably occurred between the second and third nucleotides of codon 92, with the addition of five random nucleotides that encode for unusual amino acids Leu93 and His94. Although the conformation of H3 is different from what would be predicted from other H3 conformations and is clearly important to the complementarity of HyHEL-5 to HEL, the specific residues at the VH-DH join do not appear to directly contribute to Ag binding. It is not possible to attribute the main chain conformation of H3 to the particular sequence produced by the join; the structural features of H3 may be due to interactions with HEL and/or with other antibody residues.\r"

Phorbol ester (PMA), synergistically with calcium ionophore (A23187), caused 55% of the total PKC activity to associate rapidly with membranes where it remained for at least 20 min. When IgE-loaded cells were activated by Ag, maximally 30% of the cytosolic activity associated with membranes within 15 to 30 s, but most of this returned to the cytosol by 2 min. The small amount (3%) of PKC activity that remained associated with the membranes did so for at least 20 min but only if aggregation of the receptors was maintained. PKC translocation correlated with aggregation of receptors both at 30 s and at 10 min. However, only the translocation at 10 min and not that at 30 s correlated with receptor-induced exocytosis. In the absence of extracellular calcium (no exocytosis is observed), translocation at 30 s was diminished by 30% and at 10 min was completely absent. Cells depleted of PKC by 18-h treatment with PMA failed to degranulate in response to PMA and A23187 but responded partially (35%) when receptors were aggregated. We conclude that translocation of PKC is an early event that follows aggregation of IgE receptors but may not be essential for mediating the exocytotic mechanism induced by these receptors.\r"

Inhibitors of transmethylation, 3-deazaadenosine, and homocysteine thiolactone inhibited histamine secretion by both anti-IgE and calcium ionophore A23187, reflecting a requirement of secretion for overall integrity of cellular transmethylation. These agents induced small increases in cAMP concentration which are considered to make at most a minor contribution to this inhibition. The inability of methylation inhibitors to diminish anti-IgE-dependent increases in lung mast cell cAMP levels would suggest that not only does phospholipid methylation have no role in histamine secretion but also it does not participate in the activation of adenylate cyclase by this stimulus.\r"

One such tachykinin, substance P, has been reported to modulate immunologic responses. In this investigation, granulomas were examined for substance P. Granulomas were isolated from the livers of mice infected with murine schistosomiasis, and substance P was extracted. Immunoreactive substance P was detected by RIA. The authenticity of the molecule was confirmed by elution profile on HPLC. Immunoreactive substance P, identified by immunostaining, localized to eosinophils derived from collagenase-dispersed granulomas. Granulomas were then probed for expression of the gene for substance P (preprotachykinin). Preprotachykinin mRNA was localized to granuloma eosinophils by in situ oligonucleotide hybridization. It is concluded that substance P is present within the granuloma as a result of preprotachykinin production by eosinophils.\r"

This effect is not caused by IL-2 merely acting as a foreign protein and stimulating noncognate help; it requires biologic activity of the IL-2, as determined by studying the effect of inactive rIL-2, which has minimal biologic activity but which has retained its antigenicity. IL-2 does not appear to be working by an effect on priming of specific Th, and IL-2 cannot overcome an Ir gene controlled low T cell proliferative response. IL-2 may have a role to play in human vaccine development where a high titer antibody response to a subunit vaccine is required.\r"

  ".W": "Earlier papers in this series reported that the culture supernatant of splenic L3T4+, Lyt-2- T cells from susceptible CBA mice chronically infected with Trypanosoma cruzi contain a SS3 that can inhibit the induction of delayed-type hypersensitivity to a wide range of Ag. The SS is a glycoprotein with an apparent molecular mass of 30 to 60 kDa and is distinct from T. cruzi Ag, IL-1, IL-2, IL-3 or IFN-gamma. It also has no effect on Th cells for antibody, cytotoxic T cells or immediate-type hypersensitivity. In this paper, we report that SS can suppress the induction of proliferating T cells but not the presentation of Ag to a cloned T cell line (D10). It also has no effect on the induction of delayed-type hypersensitivity in vitro. SS is produced by a number of inbred mouse strains irrespective of their susceptibility to infection with T. cruzi (BALB/c, highly susceptible; CBA, susceptible; C57BL/10, resistant) but only CBA mice are sensitive to the suppressive action of SS. This is so whether the SS is derived from CBA, BALB/c, or C57BL/10. The sensitivity to SS is not a feature of the H-2k haplotype inasmuch as B10.BR and BALB/k mice (also H-2k) do not respond to SS. Attempts to purify SS with a range of biochemical techniques substantially enriched the specific activity but failed to produce a substance visualizable by analytical gel electrophoresis. IEF chromatography revealed SS activity spanning a pH range from 6 to less than 4. This suggests that SS is likely to be a minor heterogeneous component of the suppressive supernatant. The genetically highly restricted nature of its action is intriguing and may explain some of the contradictory reports in the literature on this subject.\r"

Fractionation of LPS-photo-cross-linked, reduced, and solubilized splenocyte extracts on two-dimensional polyacrylamide gels has allowed the identification of an 80-kDa LPS-binding protein with approximate pI of 6.5. This LPS-binding protein is present on partially purified populations of splenic B lymphocytes, T lymphocytes, and macrophages. It is also the dominant LPS-binding protein on the murine 70Z/3 B cell line and the YAC-1 and EL4 T cell lines but is not detectable on the undifferentiated murine Sp2/0 myeloma cell line. Of potential importance is the fact that the 80-kDa protein appears to be indistinguishable when photolabeled extracts of splenocytes from the C3HeB/FeJ (lpsn) and LPS-nonresponder C3H/HeJ (lpsd) mice are compared.\r"

  ".W": "In the course of studying the MHC restriction of minor lymphocyte stimulating (Mls) determinants, we observed that variation in the ability to present Mlsc determinants occurred with stimulator cells from different mouse strains that express the same class II MHC restricting elements; for example, one Iad-bearing strain, C3H.HTG, presented this non-MHC moiety, whereas another, C3H.OH, could not. As another example, the prototype Mlsb nonstimulatory H-2d stimulator cell, BALB/c, was shown to encode Mlsc even though it failed to trigger proliferation across this non-MHC barrier. In contrast, H-2d-compatible DBA/2 stimulator cells were capable of eliciting detectable levels of unprimed responder T cell proliferation across an Mlsc difference. Even when the BALB/c H-2d haplotype was replaced with the fully permissive H-2K halplotype, these BALB.K stimulator cells presented Mlsc (but not MHC) less effectively than H-2K-compatible C3H/HeJ stimulator cells. Analysis of the Mlsc-presenting capacity of stimulator cells obtained from (BALB.K x C3H) F1 x BALB.K first backcross and (BALB.K x C3H)F2 animals indicated that non-MHC-control influencing stimulatory ability of this non-H-2 Ag was multigenic. In addition, the capacity of DBA/2 to present Mlsa determinants more effectively than MHC-identical LT/ChReSv stimulator cells may indicate that the presentation of this Mls specificity is also influenced by non-MHC Ir genes. Thus the Mls phenotype of an animal should be considered the combined result of an Mls structural gene, the MHC haplotype, and multiple non-H-2 regulatory influences.\r"

  ".W": "We have examined the hypothesis that binding of P815 mastocytoma cells is a necessary step in lysis of these cells by macrophages which are both \"primed\" and \"triggered\" in vitro, Macrophages \"primed\" by conditioned media containing IFN-gamma, or by rIFN-gamma have an increased ability to bind P815. However, adding either heat-killed Listeria or endotoxin to trigger the primed macrophages has opposite effects on lysis and binding of P815. Lysis is increased. Binding is dramatically decreased. This is true when centrifugal forces of 200 x g, 400 x g, and 800 x g are used to disrupt P815-macrophage binding. Although 100% of P815 cells bound by cytotoxic macrophages are lysed, a large additional population of unbound P815 is also lysed. Detailed kinetic studies indicate that macrophages do not rapidly bind and lyse several cycles of P815. There is an initial lag period of 4 to 6 h before P815 lysis can be detected, and completion of lytic events then occurs within 12 to 14 h. Lysis of P815 bound to cytotoxic macrophages is slightly slower than lysis of the total population of bound and unbound P815. In contrast, D3.1, a cloned CD4+ T cell line, is tightly bound to macrophages but not lysed efficiently. When macrophages are simultaneously confronted with P815 and macrophage-bound D3.1, only the former are lysed. Altogether, the data indicate that P815-macrophage binding, as operationally defined by our assay, is not a necessary step for lysis. These results, by use of macrophages primed and triggered in vitro, are in contrast to previously reported experiments examining P815 binding and lysis by macrophages activated in vivo by infection with bacillus Calmette-Guerin.\r"

It was observed that monocytes secreted large amounts of TNF in each of these instances.

These findings are relevant for the understanding of FcR-mediated immune responses by monocytes and macrophages, for example antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and phagocytosis, and for disease states associated with circulating or tissue-fixed immune complexes.\r"

Although only a fraction (mean 37%) of the Tac peptides is mobile on any given cell, lateral diffusion of the Tac peptide can be measured in 94% of cells examined. In contrast, the 95-kDa peptide, T27, is 90 to 100% immobilized in cells labeled with OKT27. Immobilization of T27 also affects the lateral diffusion of the Tac peptide, because the Tac peptide is immobile in more than 30% of cells pretreated with OKT27 and then labeled with anti-Tac IgG. The effect is specific for OKT27 to the extent that pretreatment with an anti-HLA mAb does not immobilize the Tac peptide. It appears, then, that Tac and T27 peptide not only are in proximity on HUT-102-B2 lymphocyte membranes but also interact physically in situ.\r"

  ".U": "88285733\r", 
  ".W": "Seven T cell clones were established from mixed leukocyte cultures in which PBMC from two healthy donors and from one patient suffering from the hyper-IgE syndrome were stimulated by the irradiated EBV-transformed B cell lines JY or UD53. Five of seven T cell clones, after activation by co-cultivation with JY or UD53 cells, induced a low degree of IgE production by normal blood B cells. In one experiment in which the normal B cells could activate the T cell clones directly, IgE production was also observed in the absence of the specific stimulator cells. IgE production was also obtained with supernatants of the T cell clones collected 4 to 5 days after activation by their specific stimulator cells. In addition, the supernatants induced IgG, IgA, and IgM synthesis. All seven clones produced variable concentrations of IL-4 and IFN-gamma. The clones FA-28 and BG-39, which failed to induce IgE synthesis, produced, compared with the other clones tested, relatively high quantities of IFN-gamma (4700 and 2500 pg/ml, respectively). These high levels of IFN-gamma accounted for the lack of induction of IgE synthesis, because in the presence of a polyclonal anti-IFN-gamma antiserum, supernatants of FA-10 and BG-39 induced significant IgE production. In addition, the low degree of IgE production induced by supernatants of two other T cell clones (FA28 and BG24) was 15- and 3-fold enhanced, respectively, in the presence of the anti-IFN-gamma antiserum. IgE synthesis by normal B cells was also induced by rIL-4, indicating that IL-4 present in T cell clone supernatants was responsible for induction of IgE production. This notion was supported by the finding that IgE production induced by supernatant of BG-24 was strongly inhibited by a polyclonal anti-IL-4 antiserum. In contrast, IgG and IgA production induced by supernatant of BG-24 were not significantly affected by the anti-IL-4 antiserum. Only a slight inhibition of IgM synthesis was observed. Collectively, our results indicate that both recombinant and naturally produced IL-4 induce normal human B cells to synthesize IgE. However, final IgE production induced by T cell clone supernatants is the net result of the inducing and suppressive effects of IL-4 and IFN-gamma respectively, that are secreted simultaneously by the T cell clones upon activation.\r"

  ".W": "Three mouse mAb were derived which identified different populations of the approximately 700,000-Da tetrameric Ig of channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus). Immunoprecipitation analyses using the three mAb in various combinations showed that the catfish Ig population identified by each mAb was antigenically distinct. Each Ig population contained both classes of catfish L chains (F and G). Solid-phase binding assays indicated that the mAbs preferentially identified H chains rather than L chains. Comparative peptide mapping analyses of the H chains defined by each mAb indicated that H chains were different, although each had the same apparent mass (approximately 70,000 Da). This structural distinction was not based upon allotypic variation because the analysis of the serum from individual catfish showed the presence of each H chain in fish examined. Therefore, the different H chains represent different isotypes; each representing approximately 20% of the total serum Ig. There is at least one undefined additional H chain isotype found in the serum Ig population. Partial sequence information was obtained on the first variable framework region (FR1) of two of the three H chain isotypes. These results indicated that the variable region associated with each isotype was heterogeneous; two and sometimes three different residues were represented in the majority of positions. The sequence information also showed that the FR1 of one H chain was distinct from the other; there was less than a 50% match of the primary residues. The analyses suggest that the V region genes which code for the FR1 are differently associated with each H chain isotype. Finally, the relative levels of the three H chain isotypes were monitored during the temporal immune response of individual catfish to the dinitrophenyl hapten. These results indicated that one H chain isotype was preferentially expressed early in the immune response (approximately 3 wk) and remained the predominantly expressed isotype during the humoral immune response.\r"

In particular, the T15 antibodies that dominate the primary response are a minor part of secondary IgG antibodies, whereas 511 and 603 antibodies become a more prominent part of the PC-specific secondary response. These three anti-PC families differ only in L chain usage. We partially sequenced the IgH chain mRNA of a series of secondary T15 and 511 hybridomas to determine the role of somatic mutation and affinity maturation in these changes in clonal profile. None of the sequenced T15 antibodies showed somatic mutations or affinity increases. In contrast, all of the 511 antibodies had extensive somatic mutation and most had significantly increased affinity for nitrophenyl-PC. The failure of T15-expressing B cells to contribute to the secondary IgG response thus is likely to be explained by their inability to undergo (or tolerate) substantial somatic mutation and affinity maturation. We also noted that all 511 antibodies sequenced by us or others had an extra amino acid encoded at the VH-D junction by either N region addition or diversity of VH-D joining. Published sequences also show a 603 family-specific change at the VH-D junction. The frequency with which these changes, which appear obligate for PC binding, occur may determine the under-representation of these clonotypes in the primary anti-PC response. The affinity maturation in 511 antibodies after somatic mutation appears to account for their expansion in the secondary response.\r"

No such binding was found in dermal microvascular basement membranes. Studies of normal adult human skin using a rat mAb specific for C3g revealed the same pattern of epidermal basement membrane staining. Control polyclonal antibodies directed against C3, C3c, C5, IgG, IgA, or IgM showed no evidence of epidermal basement membrane binding or in situ deposits of immune complexes in samples of normal human skin that were all positive for C3d and C3g. Pre-adsorption of monoclonal or polyclonal anti-human C3d with purified human C3d completely blocked these reagents' epidermal basement membrane reactivity. Anti-human C3d epidermal basement membrane binding was not diminished by pre-treatment of substrate with antibodies directed against C3, C3c, C5, laminin, fibronectin, or type IV collagen as well as bullous pemphigoid, KF-1, or epidermolysis bullosa acquisita Ag. Direct immunofluorescence microscopy studies on 1 M NaCl split human skin showed that C3d and C3g were found in the base of the cleavage plane created within the lamina lucida. By immunoelectron microscopy, C3d was found along the base of the lamina densa and in the sublamina densa region of normal human epidermal basement membrane. Although anti-human C3d epidermal basement membrane binding was not altered by treatment of 6 micron skin sections with buffers of varying pH and ionic concentration, binding was abolished by treating dermal portions of salt split skin with 0.1 M dithiothreitol in 8 M urea. Studies of a patient with congenital C3 deficiency revealed that there was no binding of anti-human C3d or anti-human C3g to this subject's epidermal basement membrane. Moreover, treatment of this patient's skin with aged human serum containing C3d,g or purified human C3 did not restore epidermal basement membrane anti-human C3d binding. These studies demonstrate that C3d,g or a closely related C3 fragment is present in the epidermal basement membrane zone of normal human skin.\r"

However, most resting monocytes (75%) expressed only DR Ag. In the process of studying the expression of class II Ag on T cells, it was necessary to define and analyze the activated T cell state. Cell cultures activated with 0.3 ng/ml anti-CD3 had the highest expression of class II Ag on T cells, whereas those activated with 3.0 ng/ml anti-CD3 had the highest expression of IL-2R on T cells. Addition of IL-2 had no further effect on DR Ag expression on T cells but did up-regulate IL-2R expression. Reducing the initial monocyte concentration before activating T cells increased class II Ag expression on T cells without affecting IL-2R expression. The results obtained on T cell activation suggest that perhaps a lymphokine may be made by CD3-activated T cells which induces class II Ag expression on T cells.\r"

  ".W": "Bacterial superinfection in influenza A virus-related illness may in part be explained by virus-induced neutrophil dysfunction. We here provide evidence that this effect is related to abnormal calcium metabolism of virus-infected cells. Neutrophils exposed to influenza virus for 0.5 h at 37 degrees C showed depressed O2- generation and release of radiolabeled arachidonic acid upon stimulation with FMLP. The peak cytosolic Ca2+ level achieved by virus-infected neutrophils after FMLP stimulation was significantly depressed as is efflux of 45Ca2+. This deficient Ca2+ mobilization could not be attributed to alterations of inositol phosphate production or Ca2+ influx in response to FMLP, both of which were unaffected by prior virus infection. Given these findings, the immediate effects of influenza virus on neutrophil Ca2+ metabolism were examined. The virus itself caused a rise in cytosolic Ca2+ and an efflux of 45Ca2+ without any corresponding 45Ca2+ influx. Total cell Ca2+ however was not depleted as measured by atomic absorption. Influenza virus, therefore, causes neutrophil activation leading to significant perturbations in Ca2+ metabolism and later to impaired mobilization of Ca2+ stores. This system offers a model for phagocyte deactivation and an opportunity to define control mechanisms of signal transduction.\r"

  ".W": "Co-polymers composed of polyoxyethylene and polyoxypropylene have been shown previously to trigger histamine release from mouse peritoneal mast cells; this property quantitatively is directly related to the ionophorous ability of these compounds to cause a functional exchange of intracellular K+ for extracellular Na+ across the cell membrane. We investigated the effect of an inflammatory copolymer, T130R2, on human basophils. The data demonstrate that T130R2 can cause calcium-dependent histamine release from human basophils in vitro. Further, at concentrations that do not cause histamine release, this co-polymer markedly augments release by suboptimal concentrations of the lectin Con A or anti-IgE antibody and the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate but not the calcium ionophore A23187. Thus, these co-polymers induce mediator release from cells of both rodents and humans. In both instances it is likely that calcium-dependent cell triggering is the result of an influx of sodium ions with concomitant depolarization of the transmembrane potential. In common with the calcium ionophore A23187, the co-polymer T130R2 has the ability to synergize with stimuli which trigger the IgE receptor as well as those which directly activate the cellular calcium- and phospholipid-dependent protein kinase.\r"

Here we present a more detailed analysis of the Igh gene recombination in nine scid pre-B cell lines transformed by Abelson murine leukemia virus. We found 85% of the rearranged Igh alleles to contain abnormal Dh-Jh deletions of varying size. All of these deletions encompassed Jh elements and extended into the Igh enhancer region, occasionally involving the switch (S) region of the C mu gene. Some of these rearrangements removed most of the Dh elements, but none appeared to extend to the Vh genes. DNA sequence analysis of the two abnormally rearranged Igh alleles in one pre-B cell line showed that no Dh or Jh coding sequences were retained at the recombination sites though heptamer-like (CACTGTG) recognition signal sequences were present in the absence of nonamer (GGTTTTTGT) recognition signal sequences. These results imply that a deregulated recombinase activity may be responsible for the abnormal Dh-Jh deletions and the absence of Vh-Dh joining in established lines of Abelson murine leukemia virus-transformed scid pre-B cells.\r"

This DPw4 alpha-chain is identical to the conserved DP alpha-chains from DPw4 and DPw2 haplotypes, although the DPw4 beta-chain (referred to as DPw4b beta) differs from all reported DP beta-chain sequences. The DPw4b beta-chain differs from the reported DPw4 beta sequence (referred to as DPw4a beta) at three amino acid positions in the first domain (36, 55, and 56). The DPw4b beta-chain sequence differs from the DPw2 beta-chain sequence only at position 69 in the first domain, suggesting that the lysine at position 69 in DPw4b beta and the glutamic acid at position 69 in DPw2 beta contribute to the epitopes that define \"DPw4-ness\" and \"DPw2-ness,\" respectively. In addition, the patterns of sequence identities and differences among the DPw4b beta-, DPw4a beta-, DPw2 beta-, and DPw3 beta-chains suggest that the DPw4b beta sequence arose via a gene conversion event or a point mutation. The I-LR1 mAb, which was previously found to bind only to DPw2, DPw3, and DR5 molecules, binds to an L cell transfectant expressing the DPw4 alpha:DPw4b beta molecule. The DPw4b beta sequence provides the first evidence for structural heterogeneity within the DPw4 specificity.\r"

They appear to consist of various combinations of exons and introns, suggesting that they are derived from p55 IL-2R mRNA precursors. The configuration of exons in the splicing intermediates indicates that the murine and human gene organizations are similar and that the 3' end of intron 3 is well conserved between the two species. RNA mapping experiments using nuclear, cytoplasmic, and total RNA and probes derived from various parts of the p55 IL-2R gene support and extend the sequence data. They indicate that detectable amounts of immature p55 IL-2R mRNA are found specifically in the cell nucleus of the HT-2 cell line. Similar data were obtained for the Th cell clone 52.3 and the cytotoxic T cell line CTLL. All these results indicate that the T cell nucleus contains significant amounts of immature p55 IL-2R mRNA.\r"

The results indicate that the DR5 DQw1 and DRw6 DQw1 haplotypes have arisen by recombination between the DR beta 1 and DQ alpha loci. This contrasts with our previous analysis of DR4 DQ\"Wa\", DR3 DQ\"Wa\", and DR7 DQw3 haplotypes, all of which appear to have arisen by virtue of recombination between DQ alpha and DQ beta. Thus, there appear to be at least two different sites where recombination has occurred within the DR and DQ subregions. These differing patterns of recombination were interpreted in the context of the three major family groups of class II haplotypes, the DRw53, DRw52, and DR1/2 haplotype families. The data indicate that haplotypes from these family groups tend to undergo recombination at different locations. We propose that these differences in site of recombination are a reflection of differences in the molecular organization of the haplotypes belonging to each family group.\r"

  ".W": "The regulation of human low affinity FcR for IgE (Fc epsilon R2/CD23) and the soluble Fc epsilon R2 [IgE binding factor (BF)] of monocyte (U937), T (ED), and B (JIJOYE) cell lines was examined by anti-Fc epsilon R2 mAb (H107, Mab176) and the cDNA probe for Fc epsilon R2. The effect of IL-4 and IFN-gamma on Fc epsilon R2 regulation was variable among these three cell lines. IL-4 and IFN-gamma enhanced the Fc epsilon R2 gene expression and the production of Fc epsilon R2 and IgE-BF on U937, whereas IL-4 and IFN-gamma had no significant effect on the Fc epsilon R2 expression on ED. On JIJOYE, IL-4 enhanced the Fc epsilon R2 and IgE-BF production on both protein and mRNA levels. In U937 and JIJOYE cells, there was a marked increase of Fc epsilon R2 mRNA after combined stimulation with IFN-gamma and IL-4. However, in JIJOYE cells, there was a dissociation between the surface expression of Fc epsilon R2 and Fc epsilon R2 mRNA treated with IFN-gamma plus IL-4. In these cells. IFN-gamma even down-regulated the IL-4-induced expression of surface Fc epsilon R2. Stimulation of JIJOYE cells with both IFN-gamma and IL-4 resulted in the increase of the IgE-BF in the supernatant, suggesting that IFN-gamma enhanced the release of IgE-BF from Fc epsilon R2. The results indicated that Fc epsilon R2 and IgE-BF expression is regulated by IFN-gamma at least on two different levels: on transcriptional levels and the levels of cleavage of the surface Fc epsilon R2 to release soluble Fc epsilon R2 (IgE-BF). Ligands binding to the Fc epsilon R2 such as IgE and anti-Fc epsilon R2 mAb enhanced the surface expression of Fc epsilon R2 on these Fc epsilon R2(+) cell lines. This was mainly due to the surface accumulation of the receptors on JIJOYE and U937. However, the stimulation of ED by H107 and anti-Fc epsilon R2 mAb significantly enhanced the mRNA expression, indicating that Fc epsilon R2 synthesis may also be up-regulated by the specific ligands in some cell types.\r"

The latter is not modulated by antibody but is highly susceptible to induction by immune IFN-gamma on human carcinoma and melanoma cells. The mAb CL 207 does not mediate C- and cell-dependent lysis of human carcinoma and melanoma cells. Conjugation of daunomycin with mAb CL 207 causes a slight reduction of its immunoreactivity and affinity but does not affect its serologic specificity or the toxicity of daunomycin. In combination with IFN-gamma, the daunomycin-mAb CL 207 conjugate displays a selective in vitro and in vivo toxic effect on tumor cells that express the 96-kDa MAA. The synergistic effect of IFN-gamma and daunomycin-mAb CL 207 conjugate is specific. The in vivo toxicity is influenced by the interval between injection of human tumor cells into nude mice and that of IFN-gamma and daunomycin-mAb CL 207 conjugate. The present results suggest that the 96-kDa melanoma-associated Ag may be a useful model to investigate the combined use of IFN-gamma and mAb for the selective destruction of tumor cells.\r"

  ".W": "In an attempt to clarify the mechanisms underlying the lack of melanin formation in hair bulb melanocytes of chinchilla mice (genotype a/a, cch/cch, strain PW), we studied the effect of exogenous melanogenic stimulants such as theophylline (Tp), dibutyryl cyclic AMP (db-cAMP), and alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH) on the induction of melanization. Skin explants excised from the dorsa of chinchilla or lethal yellow C57BL/6J, Ay/a) mice at 7 to 9 days of age were cultured in the presence of Tp (2 mM), db-cAMP (2 mM), or alpha-MSH (1.0 microgram/ml). After 2 to 5 days, melanin formation was induced in hair bulb melanocytes of chinchilla mutant in response to both Tp and db-cAMP, but alpha-MSH did not produce new melanin formation. In contrast, yellow mutant increased the melanin formation in response to all stimulants. Electron microscopic studies demonstrated that while non-treated hair bulb melanocytes of chinchilla mutant contain a large number of stage II-III melanosomes without melanin deposition, a hair bulb treated with Tp exhibits the new formation of melanin within melanosomes that appears both as typical eumelanosomes with striated longitudinal matrices and as pheomelanosomes with vacuolar melanization. Quantitative analysis of melanin has revealed that in chinchilla mutant, Tp and db-cAMP induce a severalfold increase in the formation of both eumelanin [pyrrole-2,3,5-tricarboxylic acid (PTCA)] and pheomelanin (aminohydroxyphenylalanine), whereas alpha-MSH does not stimulate production of either melanin. In yellow mutant, db-cAMP induced a remarkable increase in eumelanin (PTCA), in contrast to the fewfold increase induced by alpha-MSH and Tp. All stimulants induced a slight increase in pheomelanin to a similar extent. These different reactions to melanogenic stimulation suggest a possible defect in the tyrosinase activation system within hair bulb melanocytes in chinchilla mutants.\r"

In addition, the amounts of these eumelanin monomers have been found to decrease along with the process of eumelanin polymer formation from coated vesicles to premelanosomes and finally to melanosomes among melanogenic subcellular compartments.

The cumulative 13CO2 excretion 4 hours after 13C-lactose intake was compared with the H2 breath excretion and with jejunal lactase activity. A physiologically significant relation was found between the cumulative 13CO2 excretion (at 4 hours) and lactase activity, 14.5% 13CO2 excretion being the best cutoff point for discrimination between patients with low and normal lactase activity. The 13CO2 breath test was found to be more sensitive (0.84 versus 0.68) and more specific (0.96 versus 0.89) than the H2 breath test in detecting low jejunal lactase activity. Concordant results of both breath tests performed simultaneously give a reliable picture of the lactose absorption status of the patient. Discordance in results of 13CO2 and H2 lactose breath tests, if not explained by history, indicates in which patients a jejunal biopsy should be performed. If lactase activity and morphology of the biopsy are normal, other causes of discordance must be investigated.\r"

The geometric standard deviation (GSD), reflecting the heterogeneity of the FALS, FITC, and resistive particle size signals, was almost identical: 1.69 +/- 0.03, 1.67 +/- 0.04, and 1.69 +/- 0.02, respectively, for spherical platelets from normal individuals. Platelet FALS signal distributions were compared with Coulter resistive particle size distributions by using platelet samples from 12 normal patients and 27 patients with thrombocytopenia. Significant correlation was found between mean FALS and mean resistive particle size (r = 0.83) and between GSD of FALS and GSD of resistive particle size (r = 0.74) with the platelet samples from the 39 subjects studied. These studies, which document the high degree of correspondence among these three independent measurements of platelet size, based on three entirely different principles, strongly suggest that platelet size is log normal distributed and that the GSD value shown above reflects actual heterogeneity in size. The FALS signal distribution was, however, found to be markedly influenced by changes in platelet shape and internal structure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Response to ventilatory loading was assessed by repeating the CO2 test with an inspiratory flow-resistive load (16 cm H2O/L/sec). During loaded and unloaded CO2 tests, respiratory effort was also assessed by measuring the pressure generated in the first 0.1 second (P0.1) of the subsequent inspiratory effort after brief manual occlusion of the inspiratory line. Ventilatory responses of the parents of victims of SIDS to chemical and mechanical stimulation were not significantly different from those of control parents. Responses in both groups were similar to previously reported normal values. There was a linear increase in ventilation (VE) in response to hypercapnia and hypoxia and in P0.1 in response to hypercapnia. We found expected increases in P0.1/PCO2 and decreases in VE/PCO2 slopes during loaded breathing in all subjects, but no difference between groups. We conclude that parents of SIDS victims have normal ventilatory chemosensitivity and respiratory drive.\r"

In contrast, mice immunized with cells not producing p60v-src or their derived proteins or with chicken ovalbumin did not show any significant resistance. These findings suggest that p60v-src can act as a specific transplantation rejection antigen in mice.\r"

Of the 56 patients, 36 (65%) were males and 20 (35%) were females with an age range of 14-82 years (mean, 48 years). The Apache II score ranged from 3-49 (mean, 19.4). There were seven types of diagnostic studies: CT of the head (28), CT of abdomen (35), CT of chest (four), angiography (nine), ventilation/perfusion scan (three), tomography (seven) and miscellaneous studies (15). The average trip time was 81 minutes, a range of 15-210, requiring an average of 3.3 personnel per trip. Ninety-four transported patients had ventilatory support, 26 had PA lines, and 26 transports required three or more IV infusion pumps. Sixty-eight per cent of all transports experienced serious physiologic changes of 5 minutes' duration defined as BP systolic or diastolic +/- 20 mm Hg (40%), pulse +/- 20 beats/minute (21%), ventilatory rate +/- 5/minute (20%), O2 saturation decrease by 5% or more (17%). There was a total of 113 serious changes requiring an increase in support of the patient during the transport. There were no significant differences when comparing diagnosis of patient or types of studies to the number of changes in the physiologic parameters, nor were there significant differences within a physiologic parameter when comparing patient types or diagnostic studies.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Mortality for the group was 2.9%. No deaths occurred in patients whose PTS was greater than 8, which was defined as the Critical Triage Point. The sensitivity of the PTS when used for triage at the critical triage point was 95.8%. The specificity of the PTS was 98.6%. The Pediatric Trauma Score appears to be highly accurate, reliable, predictable, and easy to use for assessing the severity of injury and hence is a straightforward modality for triage of injured children.\r"

  ".W": "All institutional reimbursement for inpatient care in the State of New Jersey is administered by the DRG methodology (Prospective Payment System). This system is essentially identical to federal Medicare. In 1983 our hospital was designated the Level I trauma center for southern New Jersey (population, 2.6 million). Prehospital triage guidelines based on anatomic injury were implemented, and, as a result, an annual 30% increase in severe trauma cases (ISS greater than 16) was realized. In late 1984 serious financial shortfalls were noticed, especially in the higher ISS cases. A 1-year study (1985) of all patients admitted through the Trauma Center to an intensive care unit was completed (523 patients; mean ISS, 15.16; ISS greater than 16, 37.8%). All patients were stratified to one of five ISS groups (A: ISS 1-8; B: ISS 9-15; C: ISS 16-24; D: ISS 25-40; E: ISS greater than 40). Average cost, reimbursement, ISS, LOS, and mortality were reviewed for the entire aggregate and each severity group. The system of ISS grouping was an accurate method of cost analysis, and prospectively, ISS grouping allowed prediction of length of stay and total hospital cost. In addition, these data allowed early fiscal management decisions and resource allocation. As a reimbursement system, DRG falls short of the cost of care for all ISS levels and groups. As severity of injury rose, costs increased in a linear manner, but reimbursement did not, resulting in a substantial financial loss. The net loss to the hospital in 1 year was $1.86 million.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We used a bilateral isolated in vivo canine gracilis muscle model in 15 anesthetized dogs. The experimental muscles had 4, 6, or 8 hours of ischemia and 1 hour of reperfusion. The contralateral gracilis muscle served as a control. Technetium 99m pyrophosphate (99mTc-PYP), an agent which localizes in injured muscle cells, was used to quantitate canine skeletal muscle damage. After 6 hours of ischemia and 1 hour of reperfusion, there was a significant increase of 215% of 99mTc-PYP uptake in the experimental vs the control muscle. Experimental muscle uptake was 8% greater than control after 4 hours and 405% more after 8 hours of ischemia and reperfusion. Segmental distribution of 99mTc-PYP uptake showed localization to be greatest in the middle of the muscle at the entry site of the gracilis artery. Electron microscopic evaluation also documented this area to have undergone the most severe injury. Distal portions of the muscle did not show increased damage. Our results show that 99mTc-PYP effectively quantitates skeletal muscle ischemia and reperfusion injury. The pattern of 99mTc-PYP uptake suggests that considerable injury is caused during reperfusion.\r"

  ".W": "Patients who undergo cardiopulmonary bypass experience derangements of complement activation, prostaglandin metabolism, and catecholamine secretion, which have all been posited to explain postoperative fluid retention and paroxysmal hypertension. Atrial natriuretic factor, a hormonal peptide released by the cardiac atria, regulates vascular volume by increasing sodium excretion and decreasing vasomotor tone and catecholamine synthesis. We examined its possible response to cardiopulmonary bypass in 23 patients (18 having cardiopulmonary bypass and, as a control group, five having thoracotomy) who underwent serial blood sampling to measure plasma atrial natriuretic factor levels before, during, and after operation. Thoracotomy alone had no effect on atrial natriuretic factor levels before, during, and after operation. Patients with cardiac valve lesions who had a higher incidence of arrhythmias and congestive heart failure showed elevated preoperative atrial natriuretic factor values (p less than 0.05). Normally, atrial natriuretic factor release is directly related to atrial filling pressure, but all patients having cardiopulmonary bypass revealed a paradoxical rise of atrial natriuretic factor during cardiopulmonary bypass (p less than 0.01) and a lack of correlation between atrial filling pressure and atrial natriuretic factor secretion in the early postoperative period. The atrial natriuretic factor response to pulmonary wedge pressure began to normalize 24 hours after operation. The unique reaction of this recently discovered cardiac hormone to cardiopulmonary bypass suggests its possible role in the pathophysiologic response to cardiac operation.\r"

In contrast, only 3 of 5 adult patients with acute, non-relapsing, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) had lytic anti-endothelial antibodies and only 1 of these recognised an antigen lost upon gamma interferon treatment. None of 32 control sera contained lytic anti-endothelial cell antibodies. These data suggest that HUS involves a disorder of immunoregulation and that a unique class of anti-endothelial cell antibodies is produced that may take part in the pathogenesis of vascular injury in HUS.\r"

Respiratory tract infections and acute lung rejection after HLT for cystic fibrosis were no more common than in other HLT patients. Of the 7 patients for whom suitable donor organs were not found, 3 died within 3 months of assessment. Initial severity of disease had been similar to that in the transplant group. The cost of assessment, operation, and 1 year's treatment after HLT is similar to that of medical treatment for such patients.\r"

The two principal end-points were clot lysis at 2 h, as assessed by angiography, and pulmonary reperfusion at 24 h, as assessed by perfusion lung scanning. All patients received the full dose of rt-PA but urokinase infusions were terminated prematurely (on average after 18 h) in 9 patients because of allergy in 1 and uncontrollable bleeding in 8. By 2 h, 82% of rt-PA-treated patients showed clot lysis, compared with 48% of urokinase-treated patients (p = 0.008; 95% CI for the difference = 10-58%). Improvement in lung scan reperfusion at 24 h was identical in the two treatment groups. The reduction in fibrinogen did not differ significantly between the rt-PA and urokinase groups (45% vs 39% at 2 h and 34% vs 40% at 24 h). The results indicate that in the dose regimens employed, rt-PA acts more rapidly and is safer than urokinase in the treatment of acute PE.\r"

The complication rate was high and included severe mucositis, xerostomia, and septicemia (fatal in two cases). Despite high local disease control, survival rate did not increase.

No patient previously had evidence of hematologic dysfunction or conditions known to be associated with aplastic anemia. No other cases of aplastic anemia were identified among 1463 patients undergoing liver transplantation for all other indications at the four centers participating in the study (chi-square = 415, P less than 0.001; 95 percent confidence interval for the incidence of aplastic anemia after transplantation for non-A, non-B hepatitis, 13 to 44 percent, vs. 0.00 to 0.13 percent for all other indications). The operative and postoperative treatment of these patients was not otherwise different, indicating that the aplastic anemia was a complication of the hepatitis, not of the transplantation procedure. Four of the nine patients died of complications due to infections. Three of the surviving patients have been followed for less than six months, one for one year, and one for two years. The two patients followed the longest have recovered marrow function to an appreciable degree, and two of the others have evidence of early recovery. We conclude that patients undergoing orthotopic liver transplantation for non-A, non-B hepatitis are at a high risk for the development of aplastic anemia.\r"

We studied 55 patients (ages, 1 month to 19 years) with a clinical diagnosis of sepsis and purpuric lesions who were in shock or had three or more other biologic risk factors. The mortality rate was correlated with the number of risk factors present on admission to the hospital (P = 0.03). Tumor necrosis factor alpha was elevated in 91 percent of the 35 patients tested, interleukin-1 in 21 percent of the 33 patients tested, and gamma interferon in 19 percent of the 32 tested. Alpha interferon levels were within normal limits in the 32 patients tested. Serum levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha were positively correlated with the number of risk factors (P less than 0.05) and negatively correlated with blood fibrinogen levels (P = 0.01). Tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin-1, and gamma interferon were significantly higher in patients who died than in the survivors. Alpha interferon levels were similar in the two groups. Serum concentrations of both interleukin-1 and gamma interferon were correlated with concentrations of tumor necrosis factor alpha. These data provide evidence that serum levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin-1, and gamma interferon correlate with the severity of meningococcemia in children. The findings may have implications for new therapeutic approaches.\r"

  ".W": "The regulation of the subclass of immunoglobulin secreted by B cells has been studied in vitro in polyclonal systems using mitogens, such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS), to bypass the requirement for cognate interaction between antigen-specific T and B cells. In these systems, interleukin-(IL)-4 induces the secretion of IgG1 (ref. 1) and IgE (ref. 2); IL-5 enhances the secretion of IgA, and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) enhances the secretion of IgG2a (ref. 5). Clones of murine TH cells can be divided into two subsets, TH1 and TH2 (ref. 6). Both subsets synthesize IL-3 and granulocyte-monocyte colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), but only TH1 clones produce IL-2, IFN-gamma, and lymphotoxin (LT) and TH2 clones produce IL-4 and IL-5 (ref. 7). We have examined the role of clones of antigen-specific TH1 and TH2 cells in the regulation of the subclasses of IgG antibody secreted by antigen-specific B cells. Our results show that both types of TH cells induce the secretion of IgM and IgG3, whereas clones of TH1 and TH2 cells specifically induce antigen-specific B cells to secrete IgG2a and IgG1, respectively. We also demonstrate that regulation of commitment to the secretion of a particular IgG isotype occurs in two distinct stages: cognate interaction between T and B cells and interaction between T-cell-derived lymphokines and B cells.\r"

Results were compared with data from 19 normal controls. Ten patients had left temporal, eight right temporal, and four bitemporal or generalized EEG discharges. There were no significant differences between patient and control values in any of 20 regions of interest. LCMRglu was depressed at the site of the epileptic focus: L/R ratio was 0.85 +/- 0.12 (p less than 0.003 compared with control), 0.92 +/- 0.08 (p less than 0.05), and 0.84 +/- 0.1 (p less than 0.001), respectively, in mesial, superior, and inferior temporal regions for patients with left temporal foci; 1.7 +/- 0.96 (p less than 0.04), 1.1 +/- 0.1 (NS), and 1.15 +/- 0.04 (p less than 0.001) for patients with right temporal foci. Patients with left temporal EEG foci had significantly lower values than patients with right temporal foci in left superior frontal and thalamic as well as left temporal regions, while patients with right-sided EEG foci had depressed LCMRglu (compared with patients with left temporal EEG foci) restricted to right mesial temporal lobe. The patients with left temporal foci tended to have longer seizure histories (22.7 +/- 5.4 versus 11 +/- 5.6 years; p less than 0.001). There was an inverse correlation between length of seizure history and mean LCMRglu (r = 0.38; 0.1 greater than p greater than 0.05). Our study suggests that LCMRglu is not depressed in regions beyond the epileptic focus when patients are not taking drugs known to decrease cerebral glucose metabolism.\r"

  ".U": "88289194\r", 
  ".W": "Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is a disorder characterized by a destructive thrombocytopenia. Since the demonstration of a humoral antiplatelet factor which causes a transient ITP when given to healthy volunteers, ITP has been thought of as an autoimmune disease. The target antigen seems to be heterogeneous; it is either a primary platelet membrane autoantigen or a secondary autoantigen absorbed on the platelet. The former was recently confirmed by the observation that serum and platelet eluates of patients with ITP bind to normal platelets, but not to Glanzmann's thrombasthenic platelets which are deficient in glycoproteins IIb and IIIa. The heterogeneity of ITP is also reflected in the difference in response to immunoglobulin prepared for intravenous administration (IVIG) treatment. In our multicenter studies for severe ITP (less than 30 X 10(9)/liter platelet count) in children, we observed the existence of at least two subgroups of ITP, namely rapid responders (greater than or equal to 30 X 10(9)/liter platelet at 72 hours after the start of IVIG) and slow responders (less than 30 X 10(9)/liter platelet counts at 72 hours). Rapid responders mostly showed a permanent increase of their platelet counts while slow responders often had a transient platelet increase. Slow responding children were therefore comparable with adults with ITP. Because the adult type of ITP occurs often in young women, fetal risk must frequently be addressed. The situation of neonatal ITP reflects both the antigenic and therapeutic heterogeneity of ITP. The severity of the disease probably depends on the character of the antigen and its related autoantibody.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Today almost all IgG preparations for intravenous use (IVIG) fulfill the basic requirements for a preparation given intravenously (sterility, pyrogenicity, antibody content but also anticomplementary activity, etc.). However, there are still marked differences among such preparations caused by the method of preparation: (1) Enzymatically treated IVIGs (by pepsin and plasmin) have a shorter biologic half-time and a disturbed IgG subclass composition; (2) in chemically treated IVIGs (beta-propiolactone, reduced or sulfonated IgGs) the IgG3 subclass is lacking and some of the Fc-related functions are altered; and (3) the IVIGs purified by anion exchangers are poor in the IgG4 subclass. The three main preparations sold in the United States (Gamimune N, Gammagard and Sandoglobulin) belong to the nonmodified preparations and, with the exception of the IgG subclass representation, show similar Fab- and Fc-related properties (antibody content, interaction with Fc receptors on monocytes, phagocytosis-promoting activity, etc.) In none of these preparations, an elevated level of undesired contaminants (prekallikrein activator, irregular anti-erythrocyte antibodies) are found.\r"

After 6 days of IVIG administration, the IgG serum levels reached an average of 11 to 12 g/liter, values usually seen in normal term infants. The mortality rate of the preterm infants with septicemia decreased from 44% in the infants receiving only antibiotics to 8% in the infants treated by IVIG together with the same antibiotic. The IVIG preparation was well-tolerated by all newborns. Blood gas analysis, clinical examination, monitoring of respiration, pulse and body temperature revealed no untoward reactions attributable to IVIG. Follow-up at an average age of 2.5 years showed no evidence of harmful effects of IVIG treatment in the neonatal period. In a recently concluded study no differences in the levels of various liver enzymes in infants treated with IVIG and in untreated infants was found 6 weeks after administration of IVIG. In another group of preterm infants with perinatal infections who received IVIG after birth, the serum IgG levels were determined at 3 to 4 and 6 to 8 weeks of age. At 3 to 4 weeks no difference was found in the serum IgG levels in infants with or without recurrent infections. At 6 to 8 weeks the serum IgG levels were slightly decreased in infants with recurrent as compared to those without recurrent infections.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In particular whereas antithymocyte globulin was associated with an increase in morbidity and mortality, the use of cyclosporin A has resulted in a decrease in the frequency of symptomatic infections. Several sources of CMV infection in transplant recipients are: immunosuppression secondary to drug therapy can result in reactivation of the latent infection present before transplantation; blood transfusion, either pretransplant red blood cell transfusion or blood required at the time of surgery can also result in transmission of CMV and primary infection; the transplanted kidney or heart, particularly in situations in which seropositive organs are transmitted into seronegatives can serve as the vehicle for transmission. Recent data suggest that transmission of organ donor CMV can occur even in seropositive recipients. The clinical manifestations of CMV infection in transplant recipients range from asymptomatic or mild mononucleosis syndromes to severe infection. It is generally accepted that primary infections in patients who were seronegative before transplantation are more severe than reactivated infections. Involvement of multiple organ systems has been common, with retinitis, pneumonitis and gastrointestinal manifestations occurring most commonly. A specific CMV infection of the kidney has also been described but its manifestations are variable. The association of CMV infections with rejection remains controversial in human transplantation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The trypanosomatid flavoprotein disulfide reductase, trypanothione reductase, is shown to catalyze one-electron reduction of suitably substituted naphthoquinone and nitrofuran derivatives. A number of such compounds have been chemically synthesized, and a structure-activity relationship has been established; the enzyme is most active with compounds that contain basic functional groups in side-chain residues. The reduced products are readily reoxidized by molecular oxygen and thus undergo classical enzyme-catalyzed redox cycling. In addition to their ability to act as substrates for trypanothione reductase, the compounds are also shown to effectively inhibit enzymatic reduction of the enzyme's physiological substrate, trypanothione disulfide. Under aerobic conditions, trypanothione reductase is not inactivated by these redox-cycling substrates, whereas under anaerobic conditions the nitrofuran compounds cause irreversible inactivation of the enzyme. When tested for biological activity against Trypanosoma cruzi trypomastigotes, many of the test compounds were trypanocidal, and this activity correlated with their relative ability to act as substrates for trypanothione reductase. The activity of the enzyme with these redox-cycling derivatives constitutes a subversion of its normal antioxidant role within the cell. For this reason these compounds may be termed \"subversive\" substrates for trypanothione reductase.\r"

The cDNA clones were then used to isolate human chromosomal genes. Among human genomic clones isolated by cross-hybridization with the rat cDNA for the alpha subunit of the inhibitory G protein Gi2, termed Gi2 alpha, a clone designated lambda HGi62 was found to contain a sequence that is highly homologous but distinct from any of the known G alpha sequences, and we have tentatively designated this sequence Gx alpha. We have searched a rat brain cDNA library with the Gx alpha sequence and isolated a cDNA clone containing a rat sequence similar to human Gx alpha. The cDNA contained a single open reading frame of 1065 nucleotides coding for a protein of 355 amino acids with a calculated molecular weight of 40,879. The amino acid sequence of rat Gx alpha shows 66% and 40% similarity with rat Gi2 alpha and rat Gs alpha (the alpha subunit of the stimulatory G protein), respectively. By RNA blot hybridization analysis, mRNA of approximately 3.2 kilobases was detected mainly in brain. Interestingly, the deduced amino acid sequence of Gx alpha predicts that the Gx alpha protein may be refractory to modification by pertussis toxin since the cysteine residue in the fourth position from the C terminus of pertussis toxin-sensitive G alpha is replaced by isoleucine.\r"

Although the functional half-lives of the mRNA for the various genes of this operon vary less than 2-fold, their relative rates of expression have been shown to vary by nearly 1000-fold. This variation could result from differing rates of translation initiation, from overlapping upstream translation, or from differential elongation rates due to the presence of codons for which the corresponding tRNAs are rare. To distinguish between these possibilities, we have cloned sequences surrounding the initiator codons of several of these genes and measured their ability to drive synthesis of hybrid lambda-beta-galactosidase proteins. The rates of expression of the hybrid genes thus produced correlate very well with the natural rates of expression of the corresponding phage genes, suggesting that the rate of initiation of translation controls the relative expression rates of these genes.\r"

To further define the structure and function of these ADP-ribosylation factors (ARFs), we isolated a cDNA clone (lambda ARF2B) from a bovine retinal library by screening with a mixed heptadecanucleotide probe whose sequence was based on the partial amino acid sequence of one of the soluble ARFs from bovine brain. Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence of lambda ARF2B with sequences of peptides from the ARF protein (total of 60 amino acids) revealed only two differences. Whether these are cloning artifacts or reflect the existence of more than one ARF protein remains to be determined. Deduced amino acid sequences of ARF, Go alpha (the alpha subunit of a G protein that may be involved in regulation of ion fluxes), and c-Ha-ras gene product p21 show similarities in regions believed to be involved in guanine nucleotide binding and GTP hydrolysis. ARF apparently lacks a site analogous to that ADP-ribosylated by choleragen in G-protein alpha subunits. Although both the ARF proteins and the alpha subunits bind guanine nucleotides and serve as choleragen substrates, they must interact with the toxin A1 peptide in different ways. In addition to serving as an ADP-ribose acceptor, ARF interacts with the toxin in a manner that modifies its catalytic properties.\r"

NTS sequences stimulate transcription from the rRNA precursor (pre-rRNA) promoter. Primer extension analysis of RNA from cells cotransfected with plasmids carrying NTS sequences of various lengths shows that the activity of the pre-rRNA promoter is directly correlated with the number of 240-base-pair repeats; NTS sequences upstream of these units also stimulate pre-rRNA transcription. The NTS effect might depend upon transcription from duplicated promoters present within the 240- and 330-base-pair repeats. The strength of the pre-RNA promoter correlates in each construct with the level of spacer transcription. The action of spacer sequences, although able to take place over a large distance, is not independent of orientation: stimulation of pre-rRNA transcription is abolished in plasmids carrying inverted NTS segments. Removal of a putative transcription termination site located upstream of the pre-rRNA promoter has no effect on pre-rRNA initiation nor does it substantially alter spacer enhancement.\r"

To study this regulation at the level of transcription, we have identified and sequenced the promoter of the human plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 gene. Nuclease protection experiments were performed by using endothelial cell mRNA and the transcription initiation (cap) site was established. Sequence analysis of the 5' flanking region of the gene revealed a perfect \"TATA box\" at position -28 to position -23, the conserved distance from the cap site. Comparative functional studies with the firefly luciferase gene as a reporter gene showed that fragments derived from this 5' flanking region exhibited high promoter activity when transfected into bovine aortic endothelial cells and mouse Ltk- fibroblasts but were inactive when introduced into HeLa cells. These studies indicate that the fragments contain the plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 promoter and that it is expressed in a tissue-specific manner. Although the fragments were also silent in rat FTO2B hepatoma cells, their promoter activity could be induced up to 40-fold with the synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone. Promoter deletion mapping experiments and studies involving the fusion of promoter fragments to a heterologous gene indicated that dexamethasone induction is mediated by a glucocorticoid responsive element with enhancer-like properties located within the region between nucleotides -305 and +75 of the plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 gene.\r"

We have investigated the effects of inhibitors of glycoprotein processing on specific T-cell functions, with the dual aims of examining the functional role of carbohydrate and of testing the usefulness of such compounds as immunomodulators. Treatment of a cloned murine helper T-cell line with these inhibitors differentially affects the proliferative response of the cell, depending upon the nature of the stimulus. Treatment with the plant alkaloid swainsonine, which inhibits the processing mannosidase II and causes the accumulation of glycoproteins bearing hybrid-type oligosaccharide structures, enhances the proliferative response of the T-cell clone to antigen and to the mitogen concanavalin A. Treatment with another plant alkaloid, castanospermine, which inhibits glucosidase I and causes the accumulation of glucose-containing high-mannose structures, has the opposite effect and inhibits the proliferative response of the T cell to antigen. Cell-surface oligosaccharide alteration does not affect antigen recognition, as judged by the lack of effect of either drug on interleukin 2 production following antigen stimulation. Cells treated with either alkaloid proliferate poorly to exogenous interleukin 2 and may have defective interleukin 2 receptor function. Swainsonine-treated cells apparently have compensatory alterations that can overcome the reduced responsiveness to interleukin 2. Antibody-binding studies indicate that normal quantities of many cell-surface molecules, including the T-cell receptor for antigen, are expressed by the treated cells.\r"

  ".W": "The Tac protein plays a role in high- and low-affinity interleukin 2 (IL-2) receptors. A mutational survey of this molecule identified several small segments in which the binding of IL-2 was particularly sensitive to amino acid substitutions. Two of the segments (residues 1-6 and 35-43) located in the exon 2-encoded region of the molecule overlapped the apparent binding sites of three monoclonal antibodies (anti-Tac, GL439, and H31) that block high- and low-affinity Tac-IL-2 interactions, thus supporting the hypothesis that these segments of the protein are at or near sites of receptor-ligand contact. In contrast, the apparent binding sites of antibodies (Hiei and H47) that selectively inhibit high-affinity IL-2 binding were mapped to a distinct location (residues 158-160) within the region encoded by exon 4 of the Tac gene. Since high-affinity receptors consist of a heterodimer of Tac and a second ligand-binding protein (p70), this portion of the Tac molecule may be involved in the interaction between the two receptor subunits. As expected, the binding sites of noninhibitory antibodies (7G7/B6, residues 140-144; H48, residues 170-211) did not overlap those segments in which IL-2-binding mutants were observed. These results provide a preliminary correlation of structure and function for the Tac protein that should prove useful in evaluating detailed models of the IL-2-receptor complex.\r"

It was found to contain several related sequences that activated T cells from humans primed to P. falciparum by natural exposure, to proliferation, and/or interferon-gamma release in vitro. T cells from approximately half of the donor group investigated responded to the intact protein, and 65% of these responders also responded to short synthetic peptides, probably representing a small number of partly overlapping T-cell epitopes. Thus, sequences from the C terminus of Pf155 may be suitable constituents of a P. falciparum subunit vaccine and also provide a basis for epitope-specific epidemiological studies relating cellular immune responses in vitro to clinical immunity and P. falciparum endemicity.\r"

  ".W": "Paramyosin (Sm97), a 97-kDa myofibrillar protein identified by the unusually monospecific antibody response induced by intradermal vaccination of mice with a complex soluble worm antigen preparation (SWAP) of adult Schistosoma mansoni administered with bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG), was purified and tested for its capacity to protect mice against challenge infection. When administered intradermally with BCG at total doses of only 4-40 micrograms per mouse, both the native molecule and a recombinant expression product containing approximately 50% of the whole protein were found to confer significant resistance (26-33%) against challenge infection, while 2 mg of unfractionated SWAP was required to induce similar levels of protection. In addition, paramyosin was shown to stimulate T lymphocytes from vaccinated mice to produce lymphokines [e.g., gamma interferon (IFN-gamma)] that activate macrophages to kill schistosomula. Neither schistosome myosin nor a heterologous paramyosin from a different invertebrate genus were protective, indicating a requirement for specific epitopes in the immunization. That the protection induced by paramyosin involves a T-cell-mediated mechanism was supported by the failure of anti-paramyosin antibodies to passively transfer significant resistance to infection to recipient mice. Lymphocytes from mice vaccinated with paramyosin were found to produce IFN-gamma in response to living schistosomula, suggesting that during challenge infection of vaccinated hosts, paramyosin (a nonsurface antigen) may elicit a protective T-cell response as a consequence of its release from migrating parasite larvae. Paramyosin-depleted SWAP was also found to be protective as well as stimulatory for T lymphocytes from SWAP-vaccinated mice, indicating that other antigens in this preparation may have immunoprophylactic potential. In summary, these results (i) suggest that the induction of T-cell-dependent cell-mediated immunity against soluble nonsurface antigens may be an effective strategy for immunization against multicellular parasites and (ii) in the case of schistosomes, identify paramyosin as a candidate vaccine immunogen in this category.\r"

During meiotic maturation, this maternal mRNA undergoes a 3'-polyadenylation, is translated, and is degraded. Injections of maturing oocytes with different antisense RNA's complementary to both coding and noncoding portions of t-PA mRNA all selectively blocked t-PA synthesis. RNA blot analysis of t-PA mRNA in injected, matured oocytes suggested a cleavage of the RNA.RNA hybrid region, yielding a stable 5' portion, and an unstable 3' portion. In primary oocytes, the 3' noncoding region was susceptible to cleavage, while the other portions of the mRNA were blocked from hybrid formation until maturation occurred. Injection of antisense RNA complementary to 103 nucleotides of its extreme 3' untranslated region was sufficient to prevent the polyadenylation, translational activation, and destabilization of t-PA mRNA. These results demonstrate a critical role for the 3' noncoding region of a dormant mRNA in its translational recruitment during meiotic maturation of mouse oocytes.\r"

In experimental models arginine enhances specific T cell antitumor immunity. The mechanism of these immunostimulatory effects of arginine on T cell function is unclear, and the scope and specificity of arginine's influence on other components of the effector immune response such as natural killer (NK) cells and macrophages are unknown. To evaluate the role of arginine in these responses, CBA/J mice (n = 100) were randomized to receive either 1% arginine supplementation or isonitrogenous (1.7%) glycine supplementation for at least 10 days. There was no significant differences in mean body weight between groups during feeding. Arginine supplementation significantly (p less than 0.05) enhanced cytotoxic T-lymphocyte development, poly IC-inducible NK activity, and the kinetics of interleukin-2 receptor expression on activated T cells. Basal- and endotoxin-induced macrophage interleukin-1 and superoxide production were not significantly influenced by supplemental arginine although macrophage cytotoxicity in response to gamma-interferon was augmented (p = 0.07). In subsequent in vitro studies we established that certain effects (NK, cytotoxic T-lymphocyte, and T cell activation) were reproducible after preincubation for 72 hours in pharmacologic levels of arginine. The data strongly suggest that arginine mediates a direct effect on components of the immune system, which results in enhanced production or use of lymphokines.\r"

This experiment determines whether these two phenomena can be used to selectively depress tumor growth and maintain host carcass. Sixty-two rats were inoculated with sarcoma and were infused for 10 days with isocaloric (60 kcal/day) TPN solutions at 100%, 16%, 10%, and 5% of normal nitrogen levels, either with (W) or isonitrogenously without (WO) the amino acids asparagine, glutamine, aspartic acid, and glutamic acid. W solutions contained 33% of these amino acids. Mean weights of 100 W tumors were significantly greater (p = 0.002) than all other groups. Total body weights minus tumor weights were similar in W versus WO animals at each rate of nitrogen infusion. Mean venous plasma concentrations of asparagine, aspartic acid, glutamine, and glutamic acid were similar in all eight groups. These data indicate that the same degree of tumor depression produced by nitrogen deprivation can also be produced by removal of asparagine, glutamine, and their precursors from nutrient solutions without adverse effects on carcass mass. The mechanisms involved are not readily explained by analysis of venous plasma amino acid concentrations.\r"

In order to evaluate inhibition of ADP and AA on platelet aggregation, we studied the effect of ticlopidine (TC) and aspirin (ASA) alone and in combination on plasma thromboxane levels, platelet deposition, and patency of small-diameter vascular grafts in a canine model. Thirty-four mongrel dogs were classified as thrombosis prone (TP) or thrombosis resistant (TR) on the basis of in vitro platelet aggregation to AA. Four groups were studied: group I, control; group II, TC (100 mg/kg/day); group III, ASA (3 mg/kg/day); and group IV, TC/ASA (same doses). PTFE grafts were implanted bilaterally in the carotid and femoral arteries Ticlopidine inhibited in vitro platelet aggregation to both ADP and AA but had no significant effect on plasma thromboxane (Tx) B2 production. Aspirin inhibited AA-induced platelet aggregation and significantly decreased TxB2 production. Aspirin inhibited AA-induced platelet aggregation and significantly decreased TxB2 levels in both TP and TR animals (p less than 0.01). Although TC and ASA significantly inhibited platelet deposition and improved 1-month patency in both TP and TR animals, maximal patency was achieved in the group in which TC and ASA were combined. We conclude that platelet ADP and AA pathways are important determinants of the thrombogenic potential in vascular graft performance in dogs and that combined inhibition of both pathways achieves maximal vascular graft patency.\r"

The purpose of this study was to examine the route of nutrient administration on bacterial translocation from the gut. Each of 90 female Fischer rats underwent placement of a central venous catheter and was randomized to one of three groups. Group I (control) received food and water ad libitum. Group II received standard TPN solution orally from a bottle sipper and drank the solution ad libitum. Group III underwent TPN via the central catheter by pair feeding of the animals with group II. Animals were fed for 2 weeks, and liver, spleen, mesenteric lymph nodes, blood, and cecum were aseptically obtained for culture. A statistically significant difference (p less than 0.014) was found between translocation rates of parenterally fed animals compared with enterally fed animals. Two thirds of the animals (18/27) fed parenterally had culture-positive mesenteric lymph nodes compared with one third (9/27) of the enterally fed group and none (0/30) of the control group. A statistically significant increase in the cecal bacterial count was demonstrated in the animals fed the TPN solution, independent of route. Parenteral nutrition promotes bacterial translocation from the gut by increasing the cecal bacterial count and impairing intestinal defense.\r"

The impact of isocaloric, isonitrogenous total enteral nutrition (TEN) versus total parenteral nutrition (TPN) on hepatic reprioritization was investigated in a prospective, randomized trial. Of the 59 patients with an abdominal trauma index (ATI) greater than 15 but not more than 40, 45 evaluable patients were followed. Results from 36 (18 TEN, 18 TPN) evaluable patients revealed that mean serum levels of acute-phase proteins increased, whereas mean serum levels increased to a greater extent in the TPN group. The maximal increase from baseline for the acute-phase response in both groups occurred at postinjury day 5 and was significantly higher for alpha 1-antitrypsin (alpha 1AT, p = 0.03) and orosomucoid (p = 0.02) in the TPN group. Nonacute-phase proteins reached a nadir at day 10 in the TPN group and increased in the TEN group; significant differences between TEN and TPN groups appeared for albumin (p = 0.004) and retinol-binding protein (RBP, p = 0.03); alpha 2-macroglobulin (alpha 2M) approached significance at day 10 (p = 0.07). When change from baseline values was compared, day 10 increases in alpha 2M were significantly higher (p = 0.04) in the TEN group. These data suggest that postinjury TEN attenuates reprioritization of hepatic protein synthesis in patients sustaining major trauma.\r"

  ".W": "In dogs the most effective oral dose of FK 506 for prevention of renal homograft rejection was 1.5 mg/kg/day. With maximum credit allowed at 90 days, survival was increased to 61.0 +/- 33.6 (SD) days compared with 13.0 +/- 4.1 in untreated control animals. Higher doses were toxic. The smallest dose that was used (0.5 mg/kg/day) prolonged survival after renal transplantation to 33.7 +/- 23.9 (SD) days. When the small dose of FK 506 was combined with 5 mg/kg/day of cyclosporine and 5 mg of prednisone, five of six canine kidney recipients lived for 90 days. These results were degraded by omission of any of the constituent drugs or reduction by half of the triple drug doses. Thirteen of the dogs treated with various drug regimens lived for 90 days, after which time treatment was stopped; 10 of the dogs eventually rejected the grafts, but three had continued graft function for 6 months or longer and may be permanently tolerant. Moreover, in dogs when 1 mg/kg of intramuscular FK was given to 19 kidney and seven liver recipients for 3 days on postoperative days 1 to 3, 4 to 6, or 7 to 9, the animals survived subsequently for 11 to more than 160 days. All but four of the grafts were eventually rejected, but the prolonged effect of a short course of delayed therapy suggests the possibility of tolerance induction. In cynomolgus monkeys and baboons, FK as a single drug was found to be immunosuppressive after kidney transplantation. Correlation in the dogs and primates between immunosuppression, toxicity, and FK blood levels was not possible because of presently imperfect standardization of assay and monitoring techniques. FK had serious side effects in dogs, but not so obviously in monkeys and not at all in baboons.\r"

Tungsten-treated isolated perfusion hearts (Langendorff, ventricular balloon, 37 degrees C) had negligible xanthine oxidase activity (less than 0.3 vs greater than 8.0 U/gm myocardium) and improved recovery of developed pressure (DP), contractility (+dP/dt), and compliance (-dP/dt) after 20 minutes of global ischemia (37 degrees C) and 40 minutes of reperfusion. Furthermore, the addition of dimethylthiourea, a freely diffusible O2 metabolite scavenger, but not equimolar urea, a non-O2 metabolite scavenger, improved recovery. High-dose urea improved recovery more than control but less than dimethylthiourea. Combining tungsten and equimolar urea improved recovery the same as dimethylthiourea. We conclude that: (1) inhibition of myocardial oxidase enzymes (including xanthine oxidase) improves recovery of ventricular function after ischemia and reperfusion in the isolated rat heart, (2) infusion (during reperfusion) of a permeable O2 metabolite scavenger (dimethylthiourea) but not equimolar urea improves recovery of ventricular function, (3) infusion of higher concentrations of urea improves postischemic function, and (4) myocardial reperfusion injury is distinguishable from ischemic injury.\r"

It has been proposed that the cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF)/cachectin is a primary mediator of these host responses. To test this hypothesis, we studied 16 tumor-bearing humans with normal renal and hepatic function, who received 24-hour continuous intravenous infusions of escalating doses of recombinant TNF (4 to 636/micrograms/m2/24 h). Serial measurements were made of vital signs and plasma concentrations of TNF, interleukin-1, adrenocorticotropic hormone, cortisol, iron, glucose, and C-reactive protein. Low doses of TNF had minimal metabolic effects, but infusions of greater than or equal to 545 micrograms/m2/24 hr (n = 8) resulted in fever, pituitary, and stress hormone release and acute phase changes. These alterations were compared with the changes that occurred in healthy humans (n = 13) receiving intravenous bolus injections of Escherichia coli endotoxin (4 ng/kg). TNF infusion in doses greater than or equal to 545 micrograms/m2/24 hr produced peak plasma TNF concentrations and metabolic responses that were similar to those after endotoxin injection. Interleukin-1 concentrations remained basal after TNF or endotoxin administration. TNF may represent the primary afferent signal that initiates many of the metabolic responses associated with sepsis and endotoxemia.\r"

  ".W": "Hepatic steatosis is one of the two principal hepatic complications of total parenteral nutrition (TPN), the other being cholestasis. While the cause is uncertain, an excess of carbohydrate calories in rats leads to an elevated portal insulin/glucagon (I/G) molar ratio, periportal fatty infiltration, and increased total hepatic lipid content. Insulin causes fatty acid biosynthesis, whereas glucagon causes hepatic release and inhibition of fatty acid synthesis. Thus we attempted to add glucagon to lower the I/G to see if this would affect the degree of hepatic fatty infiltration by encouraging hepatic fat mobilization. Adult rats (n = 21) received internal jugular catheters; Group 1 (n = 7) was given saline solution (3 ml/h) and chow ad libitum; Group 2 (n = 7), 25% dextrose-base (D25W) TPN solution; Group 3 (n = 7), D25W TPN + 33 micrograms/100 gm/day glucagon. At 7 days portal and peripheral venous blood samples were drawn for insulin and glucagon radioimmunoassay and blood glucose determination; livers were removed for histologic study and lipid determination. Blood glucose did not differ in any group. Hepatic lipid and peripheral and portal venous I/G were increased and periportal fatty infiltration was extensive in Group 2, whereas hepatic lipid and I/G were decreased and periportal fatty infiltration was absent in glucagon-infused rats (Group 3). An abnormally high I/G ratio in portal blood elicited by high-glucose TPN may be responsible, at least in part, for hepatic steatosis. By increasing hepatic lipid export, addition of glucagon to TPN may play a major role in decreasing hepatic steatosis.\r"

GLN-enriched parenteral nutrition was administered to male Wistar rats, and subcutaneous injections of EGF were given for 3, 6, and 7 days. Control animals were fed a non-GLN-containing solution. Other groups of animals received GLN or EGF alone. Mucosal samples were obtained from the jejunum, ileum, and colon for measurement of weight, DNA, protein, and mucosal thickness. Disaccharidase activity was measured in the jejunum. After 3 days, only animals that received both GLN and EGF had a significant increase in small-bowel mucosal protein and thickness relative to controls. A similar pattern was observed in the colon, where animals that received both agents had a greater mucosal thickness, DNA, and protein content than controls. At 7 days, animals that received EGF or GLN had greater nitrogen retention. In addition, animals that were treated with EGF had elevated sucrase and maltase activity compared with GLN-fed animals at this time. Animals treated with GLN and EGF tended to have increased sucrase activity relative to controls. GLN feeding was associated with increased mucosal DNA and protein contents throughout the intestine for the combined series. EGF increased mucosal DNA and protein in the small intestine but not in the colon. The effect of EGF on the protein content of the small-bowel mucosa was dose dependent. The effects of GLN and EGF on the small bowel and colonic mucosa were additive. These studies suggest that specific nutrients and hormones may be used in combination to decrease the mucosal atrophy that commonly occurs after gut disuse or disease.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of mechanical stretching on prostacyclin (PGI2) synthesis was studied by growing bovine aortic endothelial cells on flexible-bottomed culture plates that could be deformed by vacuum. A stress unit was used to exert an elongation of 24% at maximum downward deflection of the culture plate bottom. The experimental group was subjected to cycles of 10 seconds of elongation, 10 seconds of relaxation for 1, 3, or 5 days. The control group was subjected to similar incubations but without cyclic stretch. Twenty-four hours before collection, the medium was replaced with new medium that was devoid of serum. On days 1, 3, and 5, the 24-hour culture medium was collected (basal state). Arachidonic acid (20 mumol/L) was then added to each culture and incubated for 5 minutes at 37 degrees C. The medium was then collected to assess prostacyclin synthetic activity (stimulated state). Media were assayed for PGI2 and thromboxane A2 by radioimmunoassays for 6-keto-PGF1 alpha and thromboxane B2, the respective stable hydrolysis product. The results indicate that cyclic stretching, while not altering the basal production of PGI2, increases PGI2 synthetic capacity in a time-dependent manner. These data suggest that it may be inappropriate to extrapolate the mechanisms of in vivo PGI2 release from studies of endothelial cells in stationary culture.\r"

  ".W": "The intestinal phase of gastric acid secretion is mediated by the putative hormone entero-oxyntin. The release of the hormone has been demonstrated in both dog and rat models during an intestinal meal of liver extract. The maximal gastric acid response to pentagastrin is augmented by the presence of liver extract in the intestine; this phenomenon serves as a bioassay for entero-oxyntin. We tested the hypothesis that one or more amino acids in liver extract causes the release and/or action of entero-oxyntin. Anesthetized rats, prepared with bilateral cervical vagotomies, received jejunal perfusion of mannitol (control), liver extract, or an amino acid. Intravenous pentagastrin was administered simultaneously at a dose known to produce maximal gastric acid output in rats. Our results show that of the amino acids tested, only leucine produced a significant augmentation of maximal pentagastrin-stimulated gastric acid secretion when compared with controls.\r"

Five diabetic nerve lesions were quantitated by a \"blind\" protocol: intra-axonal glycogen deposits, axons with glycogen deposits, demyelinated axons, intact axoglial junctions in paranodal terminal myelin loops, and basal lamina thickness of vasa nervorum. Untreated diabetic control animals had significant and progressive increases in all five nerve lesions compared to nondiabetic controls (p less than 0.01). Whole pancreas transplants produced precise metabolic control of diabetes and prevented development and progression of all five diabetic nerve lesions throughout the 2-year study period. Pancreatic islet transplantation produced strict metabolic control and prevented diabetic neuropathy for the first 6 months, but then diabetes recurred and nerve lesions that were similar in severity to those in untreated diabetic rats developed. The finding that whole pancreas transplantation prevents diabetic somatic neuropathy adds to and extends our previous studies showing that whole-pancreas transplants prevent diabetic nephropathy.\r"

Since prediction of human beings at high risk for development of diabetes by immunologic and physiologic parameters is not possible at present, we investigated the feasibility of immunoprediction of diabetes in normoglycemic BB diabetes-prone (BBdp) rats. Peripheral blood lymphocyte counts (PBLC) accurately predicted future development of diabetes in a cohort of 50 BBdp rats (100% specificity, 95.8% sensitivity for PBLC less than 3800/mm3). We also assessed the fate of normal islets transplanted from MHC-compatible non-diabetes-prone Wistar Furth (WF) donors in the prediabetic milieu of BBdp hosts that were known on the basis of their PBLC destined either to become diabetic or to remain normoglycemic. In 13 BBdp rats in which diabetes was predicted the native pancreatic beta cells were eliminated at 35 days of age with streptozocin and replaced with transplanted WF islets. Neonatally induced tolerance of WF antigens prevented rejection. After successful islet transplantation, spontaneous diabetes occurred in 100% (5/5) of the rats in which the development of diabetes was predicted. The identical protocol in eight rats predicted not to have diabetes resulted in permanent normoglycemia in all. We conclude that normal islets are susceptible to anti-islet autoimmunity after transplantation in the prediabetic period.\r"

  ".W": "To evaluate the CO2-induced vasomotor reactivity of the cerebral vasculature, relative changes of blood flow velocity within the middle cerebral artery were measured by transcranial Doppler ultrasonography during normocapnia and various degrees of hypercapnia and hypocapnia. We studied 40 normal individuals and 40 patients with unilateral and 15 patients with bilateral internal carotid artery occlusions. When blood flow velocity changes as percent of normocapnic values were plotted against end-tidal CO2 volume percent, a biasymptotic curve (a tangent-hyperbolic function) gave the best fit of the scattergram. The distance between the upper and lower asymptotes was defined as cerebral vasomotor reactivity. In the normal individuals, mean +/- SD vasomotor reactivity was 85.63 +/- 15.96%. In patients with internal carotid artery occlusions, vasomotor reactivity was significantly lower than normal on both the occluded (mean 45.2%, median 50.4%; p less than 0.0001) and the nonoccluded (mean +/- SD 67.7 + 13.3%, p less than 0.01) sides in the unilateral group and on both sides (mean +/- SD 36.6 +/- 15.9% and 44.9 +/- 24.6%, p less than 0.0001) in the bilateral group. The difference between vasomotor reactivity for symptomatic and asymptomatic unilateral occlusions was also highly significant (mean 37.6% and 62.9%, p less than 0.006). Vasomotor reactivity was also significantly lower in patients with low-flow infarctions on computed tomography than in patients with normal scans (mean +/- SD 36.7 +/- 25% and 60.2 +/- 16.9%, p less than 0.008). A striking association of low-flow infarctions, ischemic ophthalmopathy, and hypostatic transient ischemic attacks was found with vasomotor reactivities of less than 34% or even paradoxical reactions.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To block the initial stimulation of testosterone production and prevent the risk of the so-called flare-up with this medication, we investigated short-term combination therapy with 1 mg of diethylstilbestrol (DES). Fourteen previously untreated patients with histologically proved metastatic prostatic carcinoma were treated with 1 mg DES po daily one week prior to the initiation of therapy with LHRH analogues depot injection of Zoladex (ICI 116630) and continued during four weeks after the first depot injection. LHRH depot form was maintained as long as patients experienced clinical benefit. Endocrinologic results show that in spite of 1 mg of DES a significant increase of testosterone is still observed in the first week after injection of the LHRH depot form. Hence, this combination is not useful to prevent endocrinologic and clinical flare-up in patients with prostate cancer treated with LHRH analogues.\r"

Invasive hemodynamic measurements were compared in both treatment groups and were used in concert with serial radionuclide monitoring of left ventricular function as patients were titrated to a therapeutic dose. Of the 22 patients randomized to intravenous NTG, there were 18 responders. Cardiac output significantly increased 28%, from 5.0 to 6.5 L/min at maximum effect. Mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) decreased from 19 to 12 mm Hg. Mean arterial pressure decreased 10% and heart rate was unchanged (82 beats/min pre-treatment, 81 beats/min post-treatment). Radionuclide determined ejection fraction (EF) increased an average of 0.13, from 0.45 to 0.58. Peak filling rate paralleled increases in EF, increasing from 2.2 to 3.4 EDV/sec at peak level. Hemodynamic and radionuclide responses in the intravenous NTP group were compared to those with NTG. Of 18 patients randomized to NTP, 15 responders increased cardiac output from 5.1 to 6.8 L/min, a 35% increase. PCWP was 18 mm Hg at baseline and 10 mm Hg at peak effect. Mean arterial pressure decreased 13%, which was not significantly different from the NTG group. Heart rate response was identical to that in the NTG group. Ejection fraction increased an average of 0.17, from 0.43 to 0.60. Similar improvements were seen in peak filling rate (2.09 to 3.3 EDV/sec). There were no baseline differences between the NTG and NTP groups. In these patients NTG and NTP demonstrated equal efficacy, with the majority of patients showing substantial improvement in acute hemodynamics and left ventricular function with either agent.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

This study was not designed to determine if intravenous thrombolytic therapy decreases the mortality of AMI; however, the findings in these patients after 1 year of follow-up do permit certain insights into the impact of early reperfusion and reocclusion on the clinical course of patients with AMI. The mortality rate at 6 and 12 months was not significantly different in patients treated with rt-PA compared with SK (7.7% and 10.5% rt-PA vs 9.5% and 11.6% for SK). The frequency of recurrent AMI, coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) was similar in the 2 treatment groups. There was no significant difference in 6- and 12-month mortality or in the rate of recurrent AMI in patients who received thrombolytic therapy before compared with after 4 hours of the onset of AMI symptoms. When the results were analyzed on the basis of the patency of the infarct-related artery, irrespective of thrombolytic agent used, for those patients with patent arteries 90 minutes after the initiation of therapy, there was a trend toward a lower 6-month (5.6% vs 12.5%) and 12-month mortality (8.1% vs 14.8%) (p = 0.07).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Unlike evolutionary maladaptation, our current discordance has little effect on reproductive success; rather it acts as a potent promoter of chronic illnesses: atherosclerosis, essential hypertension, many cancers, diabetes mellitus, and obesity among others. These diseases are the results of interaction between genetically controlled biochemical processes and a myriad of biocultural influences--lifestyle factors--that include nutrition, exercise, and exposure to noxious substances. Although our genes have hardly changed, our culture has been transformed almost beyond recognition during the past 10,000 years, especially since the Industrial Revolution. There is increasing evidence that the resulting mismatch fosters \"diseases of civilization\" that together cause 75 percent of all deaths in Western nations, but that are rare among persons whose lifeways reflect those of our preagricultural ancestors.\r"

  ".W": "It has been postulated that the widespread use of broad-spectrum cephalosporins might lead to increased bacterial resistance to such agents. To determine if such increased resistance to cefoperazone might be detectable, the susceptibility patterns of common clinical isolates to cefoperazone were examined from the Pathology Laboratories at Baptist Medical Center, Jacksonville, Florida, from 1981, prior to approval by the Food and Drug Administration, to the present. Gram-negative aerobic and facultative anaerobic organisms, staphylococci, and members of the Bacteroides fragilis group were included in the analysis. The data obtained were compared with results of similar published studies nationwide. No significant decrease in susceptibility to cefoperazone was detected for any gram-negative species examined. A steady increase in the percentage of staphylococci (both coagulase positive and especially coagulase negative) resistant to cefoperazone was demonstrable at this institution. This was a direct function of the concomitant rise in the percentages of staphylococci resistant to methicillin observed over the testing interval. Anaerobic susceptibility patterns of the members of the B. fragilis group were also relatively constant during this period of time. The concentrations of antibiotic inhibiting 50 percent (MIC50) and 90 percent (MIC90) of B. fragilis isolates as determined by an agar dilution technique were 16 micrograms/ml and 64 micrograms/ml, respectively, both in 1981 and in 1987. No change in the national susceptibility patterns of common bacterial isolates to cefoperazone was demonstrable in the five-year period during which the antibiotic has been available for clinical use.\r"

PATIENTS and METHODS: Extensive clinical data and cervical culture specimens for N. gonorrhoeae were obtained prospectively from 1,441 women between the ages of 18 and 50. Fifty clinical factors were evaluated by multivariate analysis. RESULTS: Of the 1,441 patients tested, 25 (1.7 percent) had a positive culture result. The majority of infected women were asymptomatic. The following five factors were found to be associated independently with gonococcal infection: (1) sex with a partner who may have had gonorrhea or a urethral discharge within the prior three months, (2) endocervical bleeding induced by the initial swab, (3) age at first intercourse less than or equal to 16, (4) method of payment (Medicaid), and (5) low abdominal or pelvic pain. Race, a univariate risk factor, was not associated with gonorrhea when these other factors were considered. The risk of infection for women with none, one, two, or three or more of these multivariate risk factors was 0.2, 0.8, 2.9, and 9.8 percent, respectively. CONCLUSION: Clinical data are helpful in identifying women at risk for gonorrhea. If resources are insufficient to evaluate all sexually active women, we suggest routine testing based on the presence of the multivariate risk factors identified.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: The intralesional administration of recombinant interferon alpha has led to resolution of genital warts in 50 to 70 percent of cases. However, continuous warts do not respond to such treatment, and human papillomavirus (HPV) infection of other anatomic sites remains untreated, so infection may continue to be transmitted. Since interferons have shown promise as effective therapies for genital warts, we decided to investigate the tolerance and efficacy of recombinant human interferon gamma in the treatment of refractory genital warts. PATIENTS and METHODS: Nineteen women and nine men with refractory genital warts were treated in an open-label, dose-response trial of intramuscular recombinant human interferon gamma. RESULTS: Complete responses were seen in two (7 percent) and partial responses were seen in 13 (46 percent). Of 12 women with concomitant cervical HPV infection, eight demonstrated resolution with therapy. Response rates were higher in those patients who had warts less than nine months (73 percent) prior to therapy and in women (63 percent). Responses were not associated with HPV type. Flu-like symptoms during treatment were frequent but well tolerated. Transient abnormal laboratory results were more frequent with daily administration than with three times weekly therapy. Eleven of 16 subjects treated with cryotherapy after treatment with interferon experienced long-term remissions. CONCLUSIONS: In ambulatory patients with refractory genital warts, recombinant human interferon gamma appears to be biologically active and to have few adverse effects. The high efficacy rate achieved in subjects treated with cryotherapy after treatment with interferon suggests that further studies of combination therapy with these modalities are warranted.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: It is likely that the relationship between lung volume changes and gas exchange in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and patients with sarcoidosis is different since the two conditions vary widely in histopathology and prognosis. Few studies, however, have examined this relationship. The goal of this investigation was to measure diffusing capacity and gas exchange in patients with IPF and sarcoidosis in whom the reduction of lung volume was equivalent. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In 21 patients with IPF and 20 patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis with comparable reductions in lung volume, the single breath diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide and gas exchange at rest and during exercise were compared. RESULTS: The relationship between lung volume and gas transfer differed in the two groups of patients. Resting and exercise gas exchange tended to be relatively normal and the diffusing capacity was higher in patients with sarcoidosis than in those with IPF. These differences could not be attributed to disparities in race, age, smoking habits, or the radiographic stage of sarcoidosis. CONCLUSION: The preservation of gas exchange in sarcoidosis as opposed to IPF, despite equivalent degrees of volume restriction, suggests that different pathophysiologic mechanism underlie the volume loss and gas exchange defects seen in these disorders. Furthermore, these findings suggest that diffusing capacity may not be a sensitive indicator of pulmonary pathology in sarcoidosis since lung volume can be altered independently of abnormalities in the diffusing capacity.\r"

False negativity occurs because capillary endothelia are not as rich as endothelia of larger vessels in this factor. To overcome this problem we enriched liver endothelium by preincubation with the factor. The source of false positivity is the presence of Fc receptors on freshly isolated capillary endothelia. These receptors may bind antibody to this factor through the Fc portion of the molecule. To overcome this problem we preincubated the cells with IgG not against VIII/vWF (irrelevant antibody) to cover Fc receptors. The results presented indicate that considerable improvement in the immunofluorescent staining of capillary endothelia can be achieved by application of our method.\r"

Ischemia during exercise in patients with coronary artery disease may manifest itself with elevation of cardiac filling pressure before the onset of electrocardiographic changes or chest pain. Thus, patients with ischemic heart disease might have an elevated circulating atrial natriuretic peptide after exercise. The present study investigated the effect of exercise on circulating atrial natriuretic peptide in patients with and without ischemic heart diseases. Group 1 was composed of five patients who had ischemic heart disease by clinical history, previous myocardial infarction, angina or angiographically proven coronary artery disease and positive electrocardiogram during exercise. Group 2 was composed of five patients without ischemic heart disease and negative electrocardiogram response. Heart rate, blood pressure, and atrial natriuretic peptide were measured during routine treadmill exercise testing using the Bruce protocol. Our results indicate that the rate of rise of heart rate (12.3 +/- 1.8 vs. 8.5 +/- 0.7 beats/min/min), blood pressure (7.1 +/- 1 vs. 4.2 +/- 0.8 mm Hg/minute), and atrial natriuretic peptide (4.1 +/- 1 vs. 1.4 +/- 0.3 pg/ml/min) was significantly elevated in patients with ischemic heart disease compared to the group 2 patients. These findings suggest that the disproportionate elevation of atrial natriuretic peptide after exercise in ischemia may be caused by elevation of cardiac filling pressure, which may provide a noninvasive method for the diagnosis of ischemic heart disease.\r"

The syndrome is preceded by lymphocytic insulitis that destroys pancreatic beta cells. The morphologic features of the spontaneous insulitis lesions are also observed within islets transplanted beneath the renal capsule of diabetes-prone and diabetic animals. This study reports the results of experiments in which immunohistochemical techniques were used to characterize the phenotype of the infiltrating mononuclear cells and detect the expression of class I and class II MHC antigens in native islets and islet transplants in diabetic and diabetes-prone BB/Wor rats. The infiltrates within native pancreatic islets and islet grafts were comprised predominantly of Ia+ cells (dendritic cells and macrophages) CD4+ cells (helper/inducer lymphocytes and macrophages), CD5+ (pan-T) cells and smaller numbers of CD8+ (cytotoxic/suppressor and NK) cells. Pancreatic and graft insulitis were accompanied by markedly enhanced class I antigen expression on islet and exocrine cells. Class II (Ia) antigens were not detected on normal islet cells, islets undergoing insulitis or on islet transplants subjected to immune attack. In islet grafts stained with polymorphic MAbs that distinguish Ia antigens of donor and host origin, Ia antigen expression was limited to infiltrating dendritic cells and macrophages of host origin. It is concluded that the phenotypes of infiltrating mononuclear cells that comprise the insulitis lesion in spontaneous BB/Wor diabetes, and the inflammatory attack on islets transplanted into diabetic BB/Wor rats are the same, that pancreatic islet and graft insulitis occur in the presence of enhanced class I antigen expression but in the absence of class II antigen expression, and that infiltrating Ia+ cells within islet grafts are exclusively of recipient (BB/Wor) origin and may explain the initiation of immune insulitis within grafts derived from donors of incompatible MHC.\r"

Anecdotal information from other investigators has indicated the presence of antibody to Maguari virus in human residents of south Florida. We attributed such antibody to either cross-reactivity with Tensaw virus, the only Bunyamwera serogroup virus known in south Florida, or to cross-reactivity to an antigenic subtype or variant of Tensaw virus. Five strains, identified as Tensaw virus when they were isolated from mosquitoes collected in south Florida more than 20 years ago, were retrieved from storage. They were compared by serum dilution-plaque reduction neutralization tests with Bunyamwera serogroup prototypes Tensaw, Maguari, Cache Valley, and Tlacotalpan viruses. The south Florida isolates were shown to be most closely related to prototype Tensaw virus and most distantly related to prototype Maguari virus. One isolate could not be distinguished from prototype Tensaw virus, and the other 4 appeared to be subtypes of prototype Tensaw virus. More than 300 serum samples from humans in south Florida were tested for neutralizing antibody to prototypes Tensaw and Maguari viruses and to 3 of the field isolates. Thirteen had antibody to prototype Tensaw virus only, 19 to prototype Maguari virus only, and 39 to both. Antibody to all but 6 of these 71 was attributed to infection with Tensaw virus, to a subtype of Tensaw virus, or to travel or birth outside the United States. It is likely that those with antibody to Maguari virus only had been infected with yet another subtype of Tensaw virus, although another, undiscovered, Bunyamwera serogroup virus may exist in south Florida.\r"

One of the components of the worm gut is a cysteine proteinase which degrades host hemoglobin ingested by the parasite. In this report the purified proteinase (SMw32) was used in ELISA and immunoblot analyses to study the specific antibody response during the course of an acute infection. We have found high titer IgG antibody in S. mansoni infected, but not uninfected, mice. The anti-proteinase response involves IgM, IgG1, IgG2a, and IgE isotypes. Total IgM and IgG levels increased by week 3 post-infection and remained elevated throughout the study (7 weeks). Increased titers (IgM, IgG) of specific anti-proteinase were also apparent by week 3 post-infection, long before fecal eggs were detectable. Mean anti-proteinase IgG stabilized at high titer by week 5 post-infection, while IgM titers decreased to near background levels. Anti-proteinase IgE was first detectable at week 4 and reached peak titers by weeks 6 and 7. The strong antibody response to the purified SMw32 proteinase is consistent with the early reactivity of S. mansoni infected mice and humans to a 31 kDa component of the worm gut described by others.\r"

  ".W": "Recent reports have suggested that duplex scanning is an ideal method to noninvasively assess the incidence of recurrent carotid stenosis. However, the timing and frequency of the follow-up studies are controversial. In the present study, 150 patients underwent 173 carotid endarterectomy procedures over a 2 year period. In the postoperative period, a total of 210 duplex studies were carried out on 117 carotid arteries. 21.4 percent of the 117 arteries studied had recurrent stenosis of 16 percent or greater at a mean postoperative follow-up of 15.2 +/- 3 months. Recurrent stenoses were detected early after operation; 96 percent were detected at or before 15 months postoperatively. Patients with recurrent stenoses remained stable and had infrequent symptoms. Several risk factors placed the patient at increased risk for recurrent carotid stenosis: presence of contralateral disease (defined as stenosis of 50 percent or greater), use of tacking sutures, and continued smoking in the postoperative period. Although it remains important for researchers to thoroughly investigate the natural history of atherosclerosis of the extracranial carotid artery, including those changes that occur after carotid endarterectomy, our results indicate that frequent duplex scanning in the first postoperative year is unnecessary and is not cost-effective. Duplex follow-up studies 1 and 12 months after carotid endarterectomy are sufficient for assessing the problem of recurrent stenosis in the first postoperative year.\r"

His conscious level remained depressed 36 hours after the infusion was discontinued but the sedation was completely reversed with flumazenil. An infusion was started because of the short duration of action of flumazenil, and continued for 8 days. The infusion was stopped seven times during this period and on each occasion except the last, his conscious level deteriorated but returned to normal when flumazenil was administered again. Plasma concentrations of midazolam and alpha-hydroxymidazolam were measured and found to be low during this period. Possible explanations for this finding are discussed.\r"

Limbal scrapings from all patients revealed abundant eosinophils. There was marked clinical improvement after topical cromolyn sodium 4% treatment. Since the limbus was the only structure involved, the diagnosis of \"allergic limbitis\" was made. We feel that the limbus is an overlooked structure during ocular examination. As in our three cases, the limbus may be the only area involved in ocular allergy. A careful examination of the limbus may provide important clues for the diagnosis of many ocular inflammatory conditions.\r"

  ".U": "88293050\r", 
  ".W": "The influence of growth hormone (GH) on protein metabolism and fuel utilization was investigated in eight paired studies of normal volunteers. GH (10 mg) was given daily during one period, and saline was injected during control studies. For 6 days, subjects received parenteral nutrition that provided adequate dietary nitrogen, vitamin, and minerals, but energy intake varied to provide 30-100% of requirements. On Day 7, the feedings were discontinued and an oral glucose load (100 g) was administered. The level of energy intake did not markedly influence the actions of GH. During nutrient infusions, GH caused positive nitrogen balance (1.0 +/- 0.3 g/m2/day vs. -1.2 +/- 0.3 in controls, p less than 0.001) and increased protein synthesis (16.8 +/- 0.7 g N/m2/day vs. 13.9 +/- 0.8, p less than 0.01). No change in the rate of protein breakdown or excretion of 3-methylhistidine occurred. GH was associated with an increase in insulin and insulin-like growth factor-I concentrations (IGF-I, 9.1 +/- 0.6 IU/ml vs. 3.3 +/- 0.5, p less than 0.001). After discontinuation of the parenteral nutrition and administration of the oral glucose load, glucose concentrations tended to be higher after GH; however, despite a two- to threefold increase in insulin response, muscle glucose uptake was attenuated (1.10 +/- 0.19 g/kg forearm vs. 1.64 +/- 0.30 in controls, p less than 0.05). Compared with control conditions, GH appeared to attenuate the increase in amino acid nitrogen efflux from muscle after the administration of oral glucose. These data demonstrate that the protein anabolic effect of GH, which occurs even during hypocaloric feedings, is related to multiple mechanisms that favor protein synthesis. These include the increase in plasma concentrations of GH, insulin IGF-I and fat utilization. GH administration results in a hormonal-substrate environment that favors nitrogen retention and protein synthesis. GH may be beneficial in promoting protein synthesis in surgical patients, particularly in association with hypocaloric glucose infusions that allow utilization of body fat as an energy source.\r"

  ".W": "The acute whole-body and peripheral tissue protein response to total parenteral nutrition (TPN) was evaluated before surgery in moderately malnourished patients with stable disease. A primed constant infusion of (U-14C) tyrosine was used in combination with simultaneous measurements of the leg exchange of amino acids, glucose, glycerol, and free fatty acids (FFA). Energy expenditure was measured by indirect calorimetry. Sixteen patients with stable disease and in need of nutritional support were randomized to receive TPN at rates either corresponding to resting requirements (nonprotein calories at 120% of REE with 0.2 g of N/kg/d) or at increased rates (200% of REE with 0.33 g of N/kg/d). Energy expenditure was not affected by the low rate of TPN, but increased with the high rate, with a thermic effect corresponding to 16% of basal levels. Tyrosine flux and incorporation rate into whole-body proteins (protein synthesis) were not altered by the low TPN rate, but increased with the high rate. Estimates of protein breakdown decreased, and tyrosine oxidation increased significantly with both rates of TPN. Protein synthesis was stimulated at the high dose rate only. However, a positive whole-body tyrosine balance (net protein synthesis) measured by the 14C tyrosine technique was associated with a continued negative tyrosine balance across the skeletal muscle compartment in the leg. The results demonstrate that TPN given at rates corresponding to resting needs of 0.2 g of N/kg/day is insufficient to promote protein synthesis in the majority of body proteins. Skeletal muscles may remain in negative protein balance even at high TPN loads. Our results reflect the difficulties of expanding lean body mass through intravenous nutrition in moderately malnourished patients--even those with stable disease.\r"

  ".W": "Failure of antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent infectious complications following colorectal operations is reported to occur in 5 to 10% of all cases. Factors such as the length of surgery and inadequate antibacterial coverage or duration predispose patients to higher rates of infectious complications. The pharmacokinetics of cefoxitin in eight patients undergoing colectomy, mucosal proctectomy, and endorectal ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) for chronic ulcerative colitis or familial polyposis coli were examined. Peak plasma concentrations were 40% higher than values reported in healthy volunteers. During the first dose, the plasma half-life of cefoxitin was similar to plasma half-lives reported in healthy volunteers; however, total body clearance was reduced five- to eightfold. These data suggest that the volume of distribution of cefoxitin was also markedly reduced. Fluid replacement during the operation produced lower cefoxitin peak plasma concentrations after the second dose. Cefoxitin clearance increased during the second dose after fluid replacement, but remained below that reported in healthy volunteers. These data suggest that fluid depletion resulting in decreased kidney perfusion contributed to a reduction in drug clearance. The amount of cefoxitin recovered in the urine during the 12-hour study period averaged 53%. Tissue concentrations of cefoxitin in proximal colon, distal colon, rectal mucosa, and rectal muscle tissue ranged from 0.2 to 9.3 mcg/g of tissue. The preoperative fluid status of the patient, the time of drug administration, and the amount of extra-renal drug elimination appear to be important factors, affecting the disposition of parenterally administered prophylactic antibiotics in patients undergoing colorectal operations.\r"

PMN locomotion was assayed using micropore filters. Analysis of the data by general linear modeling showed that PMN locomotion in TPN patients was significantly slower during the first 3 to 4 days postinjury. By sequential analysis, improved PMN function in the group not given TPN (NO TPN) occurred less than 95% of the time. TPN with amino acids and glucose may worsen and delay the recovery of PMN locomotory responses in blunt trauma, but the preference ratio of NO TPN:TPN for better PMN function was less than 95:5.\r"

We analyzed hospital resource consumption for 4289 patients with hypertension by outcome (ie, survivors vs mortalities). The 211 mortalities had a much greater intensity of hospital resource utilization and a substantial financial risk under diagnosis related group (DRG) pricing schemes compared with the 4078 survivors. Only mortalities within one week of admission to the hospital were profitable under DRGs. A long hospital length of stay (LOS) for mortalities was very unprofitable (mortalities with greater than 60-day LOS generated a $40,673 loss per patient). Patients admitted under emergency conditions who died tended to have a shorter hospital LOS and less financial risk under DRGs compared with those who were not emergency admissions and died. Mortalities referred from other clinical services tended to have greater resource utilization and financial risk under DRGs compared with nonreferred mortalities. These data suggest notable inequities in the DRG prospective payment system vis-a-vis patients who died with hypertension. They also demonstrated variables predictive of greater hospital resource utilization for patients who died with hypertension, including longer hospital LOS, nonemergency admission, and referral from another clinical service.\r"

Similar results were found in a subgroup of 35 hypertensive patients identically matched in terms of age, sex, and race with 35 normotensive subjects. Plasma levels of ANP were correlated significantly with age in normotensive subjects and with age and blood pressure in the hypertensive patients. In 12 hypertensive patients studied on a low (10 mmol sodium/day), on their usual sodium intake (around 120 mmol sodium/24 hr) and on a high (350 mmol sodium/day) intake, plasma ANP increased approximately twofold by the fifth day of the high sodium intake, but there was no significant difference between the plasma levels on their usual sodium intake and those on the fifth day of the low sodium intake. Supine mean blood pressure on the patients' usual sodium intake was 119.3 +/- 2.7 mmHg and was reduced to 110.0 +/- 3 mmHg by the fifth day of the low sodium intake (P less than 0.005).

Four fetal ultrasonographic variables and 17 maternal endocrine variables were studied in each woman.

The serum progesterone levels in the hormone supplemented group were on average 20% higher than in the placebo group but the difference was not statistically significant. However, the relation between the progesterone levels and the fetal outcome was not clear. Therefore it is not advisable to prescribe 17-OHP-C during early pregnancy to prevent a miscarriage.\r"

Unstimulated platelets were without effect, whereas freeze/thawed platelets substantially enhanced activation. Antifactor V antibodies did not diminish the enhancement. Platelets activated by thrombin, collagen, or calcium ionophore A23187 also enhanced factor Xa-catalyzed activation of factor VII. In contrast to their lack of effect upon freeze/thawed platelets, antifactor V antibodies abolished augmented factor VII activation induced by activated platelets. Adding exogenous factor Va to unstimulated platelets failed to enhance factor Xa-catalyzed activation of factor VII, nor did adding exogenous factor Va to activated platelets augment activation beyond that observed with activated platelets alone. These observations can be interpreted as follows: (1) factor Va does not function as a cofactor for factor Xa-catalyzed activation of factor VII; (2) anionic phospholipids are a known cofactor for factor Xa-catalyzed activation of factor VII, and freeze/thawed platelets probably enhance activation by making anionic phospholipids on disrupted platelet membranes available to function as a cofactor; (3) the presumed binding of factor Xa to exogenous factor Va on unstimulated platelets is insufficient in itself to augment factor Xa-catalyzed activation of factor VII; (4) activated platelets augment factor Xa-catalyzed factor VII activation because activation allows both factor Xa to bind to released platelet factor V(a) and makes available a surface membrane component, probably anionic phospholipids, with which the bound factor Xa interacts.\r"

Previous work has detected increased levels of circulating, TAC-soluble IL-2R (soluble TAC antigen) in the serum of most B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) patients. We detected soluble TAC antigen in B-CLL patients (mean of 3,332 U/mL v 410 for controls). Serum soluble TAC antigen levels increased with stage (mean value of 1,187 U/mL for stage 0 v 2,527 for stage 2 and 5,410 for stages 3 and 4). We next attempted to determine whether the elevated serum levels of soluble TAC antigen in B-CLL patients might result from shedding or secretion of the receptor from the circulating, malignant B cells. Purified, malignant B cells from B-CLL patients were capable of producing easily detectable soluble TAC antigen after 48 hours of in vitro culture (range of 60 to 1,563 U/mL). IL-2R production by CLL B cells was dose dependent in most patients over a concentration of 10 x 10(6) to 60 x 10(6)/mL. In contrast, there was little or no detectable soluble TAC antigen when highly purified T cells from the same patients were cultured. Finally, despite elaboration of soluble IL-2R by CLL B cells, membrane expression of B-cell IL-2R was detected in only six of 11 patients. Thus, the cellular source of the elevated serum IL-2R levels is the malignant CLL B cell. Taken together these data suggest that (a) the malignant CLL B cell is \"activated\" in terms of release of soluble IL-2R and may serve as a tumor marker in this disease and (b) the elevated levels of circulating IL-2R may be an associated factor in the cellular immunodeficiency noted in B-CLL patients.\r"

In contrast, the rate of PRPP formation in PK-deficient RBCs (n = 4) was markedly impaired at 1.03 +/- 0.39 nmol/min.mL RBCs. Impaired PRPP formation in these cells was not due to the higher proportion of reticulocytes. To study the mechanism of impaired PRPP formation, PK deficiency was simulated by incubating normal RBCs with fluoride. In normal RBCs, fluoride inhibited PRPP formation, caused adenosine triphosphate (ATP) depletion, prevented 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (DPG) depletion, and inhibited pentose phosphate shunt (PPS) activity. These results together with other data suggest that impaired PRPP formation is mediated by changes in ATP and DPG concentration, which lead to decreased PPS and perhaps decreased hexokinase and PRPP synthetase activities. Impaired PRPP formation may be a mechanism for the decreased adenine and pyridine nucleotide content in PK-deficient RBCs.\r"

Thirty-one of 42 patients with lupus anticoagulants associated with a variety of underlying conditions (74%) had evidence on crossed immunoelectrophoresis of anti-prothrombin antibodies. Twenty-four of 25 patients with an activated partial thromboplastin time exceeding 50 seconds and 14 of 15 patients with a prothrombin time exceeding control by more than two seconds had demonstrable anti-prothrombin antibodies. Three of the 31 patients with anti-prothrombin antibodies had essentially no measurable plasma prothrombin, a presumed result of accelerated clearance of prothrombin/prothrombin antibody complexes. Each of these patients had bled abnormally. The remaining patients with anti-prothrombin antibodies had neither substantial hypoprothrombinemia nor hemorrhagic manifestations, which confirms the non-neutralizing property of anti-prothrombin antibodies associated with the lupus anticoagulant. Since lupus anticoagulant immunoglobulins are known to react with phospholipids, the high prevalence of antibodies binding prothrombin led us to test the hypothesis of antibody polyreactivity. Adsorption of three lupus anticoagulant plasmas with insolubilized prothrombin markedly diminished evidence of both prothrombin/prothrombin antibody complexes and anticoagulant activity. Eluates of the insolubilized prothrombin contained IgG that not only bound prothrombin but possessed lupus anticoagulant activity.\r"

We show that CsA inhibits IARC 301 cell growth. CsA also prevents the constitutive secretion of IL-2 in this T-cell line by blocking transcription of the IL-2 gene. If exogenous IL-2 is added together with CsA for 3 days, the cells grow as well as untreated controls. Thus, under such conditions, CsA inhibits IARC 301 growth by preventing its endogenous constitutive IL-2 synthesis. This demonstrates that IL-2 stimulates the proliferation of this cell line by an autocrine pathway, in agreement with our previous data. We also show for the first time, that CsA not only can inhibit IL-2 production of T cells upon activation, but that it can also prevent ongoing constitutive IL-2 synthesis of a T-cell line. Autocrine growth stimulation of tumor cells by cytokines has been demonstrated in a few cases. CsA inhibits synthesis of several cytokines. Probing for the autocrine growth of tumor cells by studying the effect of CsA and its reversibility by cytokines on their proliferation may be simple and useful.\r"

  ".U": "88294315\r", 
  ".W": "In eighty-three patients with confirmed deep vein thrombosis, the fibrinolytic system was studied before and after a 10-minute venous occlusion. Blood was collected at least 3 months after the last acute episode, and PAI-1 antigen and activity, as well as tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) antigen, urokinase-type plasminogen activator (u-PA) antigen, and fibrinolytic activity were measured in these samples. During venous stasis, plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI) activity decreased in almost all patients (81 of 83), from a median value of 8.2 to 2.9 U/mL (P less than .001, Wilcoxon signed-rank test). Because PAI-1 antigen augmented from a median value of 16 to 19.2 ng/mL (P less than .001), the decline in PAI activity was attributed to an increase in t-PA antigen from a median value of 10 to 21.7 ng/mL (P less than .001). Neutralization of PAI activity thus reflects the patient's capacity to overcome basal inhibitory potential through t-PA release. Based on residual PAI activity after 10-minute stasis, patients were classified as good or bad responders (PAI activity below detection limit, ie, less than or equal to 1.0 and greater than 1.0 U/ml, respectively). Good responders had a significantly higher fibrinolytic response after stasis than bad responders (median euglobulin clot lysis time 60 v 180 minutes; dilute whole blood clot lysis time 60 v 120 minutes; fibrinolytic activity on fibrin plates 7.7 v 0 U/mL). Furthermore, good responders, as compared with bad responders, had higher t-PA release (median 16.5 v 11.5 ng/mL), lower basal PAI activity (median 4.8 v 11.2 U/mL), and lower basal PAI-1 (median 11 v 21 ng/mL) and u-PA antigen (median 7.9 v 9.0 ng/mL, P less than .02). Hypofibrinolysis, as defined by the inability of released t-PA to overcome PAI-1 basal inhibitory potential, was observed in 45 of 83 patients (54%) and resulted either from an insufficient release of t-PA or from an increased basal PAI activity.\r"

Peripheral venous plasma levels of fibrinopeptide A increased following the initiation of thrombolytic therapy from 2.7 nmol/L to a peak of 13.0 nmol/L at 30 minutes with streptokinase and from 1.1 nmol/L to a peak of 10.7 nmol/L at 90 minutes with tissue plasminogen activator. The amount of fibrinogen converted to fibrin I was determined by integration of the plasma level of fibrinopeptide A over time. The amount of fibrin I formed over the five-hour period from the start of drug infusion was approximately 10 mg/dL in response to either streptokinase or recombinant tissue plasminogen activator. We conclude that activation of coagulation occurs in response to thrombolytic therapy despite heparin administration. This thrombin action, though transient, would be sufficient to cause rethrombosis if localized and incompletely opposed by fibrinolytic activity.\r"

After immunoprecipitation with the anti-Rh(D) antibody and preparative gel electrophoresis, a homogenous preparation of the Rh(D) protein was obtained from two different erythrocyte samples (Blo and D--/D--), which have an increased density of Rh(D) antigen. Both preparations exhibited the same N-terminal sequence (S)-(S)-K-Y-P-R-S-V-R-R-(L)-L-P-L-X-A, indicating that different Rh(D)-positive red cells are carrying a similar Rh(D) protein. Comparative immunoprecipitation studies with the human monoclonal anti-Rh(D), (c), and (E) antibodies have also shown that Rh components from intact and papain-treated erythrocytes have similar apparent mol wt of 30 to 32 Kd and are buried in the lipid bilayer and are not readily available to the proteolytic enzyme. Further investigations by indirect affinity chromatography and one-dimensional peptide mapping of the Rh(D), (c), and (E) molecules immunopurified from a single red cell sample demonstrate that a common Rh haplotype encodes three distinct polypeptide chains carrying the Rh(D), (c), and (E) epitopes, respectively.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of recombinant human tumor necrosis factor alpha (rTNF-alpha) on human myelogenous leukemia clonogenic cells growing either in semisolid media or in suspension cultures was studied and compared with the effect on normal granulocyte-macrophage progenitors (GM-CFC). Exposure of cells to a range of rTNF-alpha doses including pharmacologically achievable plasma concentrations revealed a large heterogeneity in the response of leukemic clonogenic growth to rTNF-alpha. Only one of 13 specimens was highly resistant to rTNF-alpha. Eight of ten leukemic samples were significantly more sensitive than were normal GM-CFC, particularly within the in vivo achievable dose range (1 x 10(0) to 1 x 10(2) ng/mL). No significantly increased inhibition of either normal or leukemic clonogenic growth could be achieved by increasing the rTNF-alpha concentration above 250 ng/mL. Proliferation of leukemic clonogenic cells (L-CFC) was studied in suspension cultures. In five cases the clonogenic cells were significantly inhibited by rTNF-alpha while in one case no inhibition was observed. The inhibition of L-CFC growth by rTNF-alpha was dose dependent between 1 x 10(0) and 1 x 10(2) ng/mL. In suspension cultures, the TNF effect on L-CFC was a function of time of exposure, particularly with low concentrations of TNF. A remarkably higher inhibition of L-CFC as compared with the total leukemic population was observed in suspension cultures. Stimulation of L-CFC growth by rTNF-alpha was not observed. Normal GM-CFC were inhibited by alpha and gamma interferons (INF-alpha, -gamma) in a dose-related manner, with higher sensitivity of colonies than clusters. The response of GM-CFC to combination of recombinant IFNs and TNF was influenced by the size of clones scored and the source of colony-stimulating activity. The response of L-CFC to recombinant IFN-alpha and/or -gamma was highly variable, and sensitivity to one of the lymphokines did not predict for sensitivity to another. The response of L-CFC to combinations of rTNF-alpha and either IFN-alpha or IFN-gamma was complex, varying from synergistic to additive and indifferent. In three of six specimens, IFN-gamma acted antagonistically with rTNF-alpha, a phenomenon not observed with IFN-alpha. These observations suggest that the action of rTNF-alpha in acute myelogenous leukemia could be exploited therapeutically and the dose-time-response relationship should be considered in designing treatment schedules.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The authors' previous studies showed that the glycosaminoglycans present in rabbit bone marrow were composed of chondroitin 6-sulfate (79%) and hyaluronic acid (16%). Immunohistochemically the chondroitin 6-sulfate was demonstrated to be in bone marrow matrix constructing hematopoietic microenvironment. In this study the authors isolated and characterized these glycosaminoglycans in their macromolecular form (i.e., proteoglycans). Bone marrow of 3-month-old rabbits was defatted with organic solvents containing proteinase inhibitors at -20 degrees C, and proteoglycans were extracted from the defatted tissue with 4 mol/L guanidine HCl containing the proteinase inhibitors. After extensive dialysis of the extract against 7 mol/L urea, more than 90% of hexuronate-containing materials was recovered in the urea-soluble fraction. The proteoglycans were purified from the urea-soluble fraction by diethyl aminoethyl (DEAE)-Sephacel chromatography, CsCl density-gradient centrifugation, and Bio-Gel A-5m gel filtration, then were rechromatographed on DEAE-Sephacel and on Bio-Gel A-5m. The proteoglycans were separated into three molecular species with different mol wts that were assessed to be 46,000, 16,000, and 8,300 by sedimentation-equilibrium centrifugation. Amino acid analyses of these proteoglycans revealed that serine and glycine accounted for approximately 60% of the total amino acids common to the three proteoglycans. The glycosaminoglycan side chains of these proteoglycans were converted stoichiometrically into unsaturated 6-sulfated disaccharide by digestion with chondroitinase AC-II, indicating that they were fully sulfated chondroitin 6-sulfate. Their apparent mol wts were estimated by gel filtration on Bio-Gel A-0.5m to be 10,900, 14,400, and 7,700. Computation of these results, taken together with their biochemical composition, revealed that the largest proteoglycan, PG-II, consisted of four chains of the chondroitin 6-sulfate and the core peptide with mol wt of approximately 4,000. The smaller two proteoglycan subpopulations, PG-I and PG-III, consisted of a single glycosaminoglycan chain linked to a small peptide with mol wts of approximately 500 and 1,000, respectively.\r"

  ".W": "We examined the role of the T-cell antigen CD2 in the regulation of erythropoiesis by the lymphokine cascade. T-cell interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptors (p55) were induced via triggering of the antigen receptor-associated CD3 epitope. Before CD3 triggering T cells were preincubated with a CD2-blocking (Leu-5b) or isotype control antibody. T-cell pellets were employed during incubation to facilitate interaction between T-cell LFA-3 and CD2. CD2 blockade caused a 66% to 79% inhibition of p55 expression after three to six days of culture with IL-2. Next we assessed the effect of CD2 blockade on IL-2. Next we assessed the effect of CD2 blockade on IL-2-induced inhibition of BFU-E in autologous cocultures containing CD3-triggered T cells. IL-2 caused a dose-dependent inhibition (52% to 92%) of BFU-E in the presence but not in the absence of CD3-triggered T cells. T-cell CD2 blockade prior to CD3 triggering caused a 65% to 87% abrogation of IL-2-induced inhibition of BFU-E at 10 to 10(2) U/mL IL-2. Preincubation of CD3-triggered T cells with isotype control antibody had no effect on IL-2-induced erythroid inhibition. Day 3 supernatants from CD3-triggered T cells or CD2-blocked, CD3-triggered T cells established in the presence of IL-2 were next assessed for modulation of BFU-E. CD3-triggered T-cell supernatants caused a 77% +/- 9% inhibition of BFU-E. Blockade of CD2 caused a 95% abrogation of T-cell-mediated BFU-E inhibition. In addition, CD2 blockade reduced interferon-gamma (IF gamma) release (84 to 128 U/mL) from CD3-triggered T cells by 81% at day 3 of culture. In control experiments, the addition of IF gamma-neutralizing monoclonal antibody to CD3-triggered T-cell supernatant established in the presence of IL-2 caused 75% abrogation of IL-2 inhibition of BFU-E. We conclude that blockade of the CD2 T-cell determinant induces down modulation of (a) T-cell p55 IL-2 receptor expression, (b) IL-2-induced inhibition of BFU-E, and (c) IL-2-induced marrow T-cell IF gamma release. These data suggest that the T-cell CD2 determinant can exert a regulatory effect on the control of erythropoiesis by the lymphokine cascade.\r"

On stopping stimulation, recovery to resting levels occurred within 2 min. The response was not blocked by atropine or propranolol. Blood flow through two 19 gauge needles inserted into the corpus cavernosum increased in parallel with the pressure changes, indicating that arterial inflow increased. Stimulation of either hypogastric nerves or the sympathetic chain produced penile retraction but increased corpus cavernosal pressure. The response to pelvic nerve stimulation was partially blocked. It was concluded that both of these nerves contract penile erectile tissue within the corpus cavernosum and constrict arterial inflow.\r"

Each of the nine objects was placed on a ledge inside a dummy television screen next to the video screen, the food items alternating with the neutral objects, and 20 female patients with anorexia nervosa and 20 female controls matched for age were asked to adjust the size of the video recording to that of the real object. Although there was no overall difference in perceptual accuracy between patients and controls, both groups perceived the food items as being bigger than the neutral objects, the patients exaggerating the size of the food significantly more than the controls. These results imply that patients with anorexia might start eating more easily when admitted if their food were presented as small portions on large plates.\r"

Eighty two out of 91 conformable catheters were rated as comfortable compared with 68 of 87 control (p = 0.006). The average length of time in situ was 15.9 days for the conformable catheter compared with 12.9 days for the control (p = 0.001). The average number of bypasses a week with the conformable catheter was 1.1 compared with 1.3 for the control; this difference was not significant. Examination of 249 used catheters showed significantly fewer with intraluminal obstruction with struvite among the conformable than control catheters (1 (0.8%) versus 15 (11.5%); p less than 0.001). This new catheter for women is a substantial improvement over the Foley catheter and (except in urethral stricture) is suitable for all forms of drainage.\r"

About 24% fewer white cells than in normal subjects left the dependent foot of patients with venous hypertension, and this trapping of white cells, was reversed when the foot was raised; similar changes were not observed in normal subjects or patients with varicose veins. The trophic skin changes typically seen in patients with venous hypertension may be aggravated by damage caused by the repeated accumulation of white cells in the microcirculation.\r"

Children with food intolerance were shorter than other children. A difference in height of about 1.5 cm remained after adjusting for social and biological factors and some common symptoms in childhood using multiple regression. The number of different types of food avoided was associated with shortness in the food intolerant group but not in the non-food-intolerant group. Regardless of the underlying aetiology, these findings suggest that parents' complaints of food intolerance in their children should be taken seriously.\r"

  ".W": "The possible role of white blood cells in tissue ischaemia has attracted recent interest. White blood cells can block narrow vessels, particularly if perfusion pressure is reduced or if the cells become activated. To investigate the role of white blood cells in ischaemia microfiltration techniques were used to measure the flow properties of these cells in patients with severe leg ischaemia before and after amputation. Compared with controls white blood cells from patients showed impaired ability to flow through 8 micron and 5 micron pore filters. This applied to fractionated granulocytes and mononuclear cells as well as to unfractionated mixed white blood cells. White blood cells from blood draining the ischaemic leg had worse filterability than those from arm blood of the same patients. After amputation of the ischaemic leg there was definite improvement, the flow properties of the cells being no longer significantly different from controls. These abnormalities detected in white blood cells probably reflect activation of the cells by factors released in the ischaemic tissue. As activation alters the mechanical and adhesive properties of white blood cells, a vicious cycle of microcirculatory trapping at low perfusion pressure, activation, tissue damage, and further activation and trapping might contribute to the progressive worsening of tissue ischaemia.\r"

  ".U": "88294534\r", 
  ".W": "To establish the distribution of blood lipid concentrations and the prevalences of other risk factors for cardiovascular disease in Britain 12,092 men and women aged 25-59 in Glasgow, Leicester, London, and Oxford were studied. Subjects were selected by opportunistic case finding, in which patients consulting their general practitioner for any reason were offered a health check by appointment, or random selection from age-sex registers, in which an invitation for a health check was posted. The overall rate of response was 73%, being 91-94% by opportunistic case finding and 36-63% by random selection. At the health check subjects answered a brief questionnaire about risk factors for cardiovascular disease, and their height, weight, and blood pressure were recorded; a blood sample was taken for measuring plasma concentrations of cholesterol, triglyceride, high density lipoprotein cholesterol, and glucose. The mean cholesterol concentrations were 5.9 (SD 1.2) and 5.8 (1.2) mmol/l in men and women, respectively. In London the mean value was 5.5 (1.2) mmol/l for both men and women and was significantly lower than mean values in the three other centres, among which there were no significant differences. In men and women aged 25-29 concentrations were similar but they increased in men until the age of 45-49, after which they showed no further increase; in women concentrations did not increase until the age of 40-44 and by the age of 50-59 values were higher than in men. Mean triglyceride concentrations were significantly higher in men than in women (1.8 (1.4) v 1.3 (0.9) mmol/l, respectively), and trends with age were similar to those for cholesterol concentrations, except that at no age were values higher in women than in men. Mean triglyceride values overall were higher in Glasgow and London than in Oxford and Leicester. Body mass index was higher in Glasgow and London than in the other two centres and correlated with systolic and diastolic blood pressures and triglyceride concentration. In addition, subjects in Glasgow smoked significantly more than those in the other centres. These observations could contribute to the higher rate of coronary heart disease in Glasgow. Plasma lipid concentrations and the prevalences of other risk factors for cardiovascular disease were similar in subjects selected by opportunistic case finding and by random selection. In Britain cholesterol values have changed little during the past 12 years despite dietary recommendations and health education.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

The identification of risk factors included measurement of obesity, blood pressure, hypercholesterolaemia, and urinalysis, together with questions about family history, cigarette smoking, alcohol intake, and lifestyle. The patients with identified risk factors were invited to attend a lifestyle intervention clinic organised by the practice nurses and run by the health visitors, with the help of the local authority dietitian. Of 2646 (62%) patients who attended for screening, 78 (64%) of the 121 shown to have a high cholesterol concentration experienced a drop in cholesterol concentration. The mean fall in cholesterol concentration in the 78 patients who showed a positive response to intervention was 1.1 mmol/l. The study was intended as a possible flexible model for screening for coronary heart disease in general practice that could be complemented rather than replaced by opportunistic screening. The issues of organisation, cost, manpower, nonattendance, and effectiveness in a busy general practice environment are discussed.\r"

There were 5 males and 1 female whose mean age at presentation was 67 yrs. The common clinical features were spastic tetraparesis more marked in the lower limbs, spinothalamic and posterior column sensory deficits of varying degree and sphincter disturbance in advanced cases. OPLL was diagnosed on plain radiographs and cord compression ascertained by conventional and computer-assisted myelography. Somatosensory evoked potentials correlated with posterior column signs and appeared to reflect the clinical course following treatment. While the cord pathology in OPLL is similar to that of cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM), the pathogenetic mechanism probably differs in one aspect. Compression by OPLL is the determining factor in most cases whereas the combined presence of a congenitally narrow canal and spondylosis is essential for the development of CSM. Other contributory factors include coexisting spondylosis, a congenitally narrow canal, friction between cord and OPLL during neck movement and acute trauma. Cord damage is probably mediated by ischaemia which is due to disturbances of the microcirculation caused by the mechanical factors.\r"

Because the epiphyseal plates of the distal tibia and fibula are significantly weaker than surrounding ligaments, failure on stress occurs through the growth plates rather than through soft tissue. Growth-plate injuries can assume a distinct pattern based on the maturity of the physis. Leg length inequality and angular deformity are potential sequelae from significant injury to the ankle in the skeletally immature but, fortunately, occur infrequently. Soft-tissue injuries about the ankle are rare, but with advanced, rigorous training techniques a new pattern of overuse injuries appears to be emerging.\r"

All patients had been anaesthetised with fentanyl 40 micrograms.kg-1, supplemented with isoflurane, and pancuronium 0.15 mg.kg-1 for muscle relaxation. Three of the 15 patients (20 per cent) shivered, defined as intermittent or continuous, vigorous movements of chest or limb muscles. Patients who shivered had a VO2 of 159 +/- 16.4 ml.min-1.m-2 on arrival in the ICU which rose to a maximum value of 254 +/- 28.3 ml.min-1.m-2 by 150 min post-CPB. In contrast, patients who did not shiver had a significantly lower VO2 of 93.1 +/- 6.9 ml.min-1.m-2 on arrival in the ICU which rose to a maximal value of only 168 +/- 11.5 ml.min-1.m-2 by 180 min post-CPB. Maximal VO2 in both groups was reached when the nasopharyngeal temperature (NPT) was approaching normal. VCO2 paralleled the increase in VO2 in both groups. By four hours there was no significant difference between the two groups; however, the VO2 in both groups (160.5 +/- 21.3 ml.min-1.m-2 and 173.9 +/- 12.3 ml.min-1.m-2 respectively) was approximately twice values commonly measured in anaesthetized patients. Patients who shivered had a significantly higher heart rate and cardiac index and significantly lower SvO2. We conclude that the high VO2 and VCO2 associated with shivering causing increased myocardial work may be detrimental to patients who have impaired cardiac function post-coronary artery surgery (CAS).\r"

The hardware and software used in an image analysis system are presented. This system provides a rapid and highly accurate method for determining the amount of HO in a muscle. Using the mouse thigh pouch as an experimental system, this method demonstrated that quantities of new bone were formed in direct proportion to the amount of BMP/NCP implanted. This system can be used for measuring HO on roentgenograms or any other image, including computed tomographic (CT) scans, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and autoradiograms.\r"

In the patient with SCI, immobility and paralysis negatively alter healing. A fracture above the level of SCI, although not altered in healing, when treated by ORIF will facilitate transfer training and self care. Lower extremity fractures in SCI have a high incidence malunion, delayed union, or nonunion and are best treated by internal fixation. HO occurs in 11% of TBI patients, with the hip, shoulder, and elbow being common sites. Trauma dramatically increases the incidence of HO. In SCI, the incidence of HO is 20%, with most occurring in the hip region. A genetic predisposition to form HO is suspected but not proven.\r"

Forty-six episodes of infection were associated with exacerbation of NS; 41 of these excerbations remitted spontaneously without an increase in the dose of prednisone.

In three experiments, each of 11 healthy male volunteers performed CPAP at 20, 10 and 0 cm H2O for 2 h during continuous volume loading. Samples were drawn from a peripheral vein. Plasma concentrations of irANP were determined by a sensitive radioimmunoassay. Significantly lower concentrations of irANP were observed during 20 cm H2O CPAP than at 10 and 0 cm H2O. The concentrations of irANP did not differ significantly when individuals breathing with CPAP at 10 and at 0 cm H2O were compared. Our data suggest that CPAP at 20 cm H2O lowers the release of ANP in volume-expanded subjects. We hypothesize that this phenomenon may contribute to the fluid retention and renal dysfunction observed frequently during high CPAP levels. The decline in plasma concentrations of irANP may be the result of atrial compression by the distended lungs and of reduced venous return to the heart during CPAP.\r"

  ".U": "88296299\r", 
  ".W": "During cervical differentiation in 1- to 6-month-old rabbits, a marked increase was observed in the titer of serum estradiol, the number of secretory cells in the endocervix, and the granule content of these cells. Because these secretory granules are rich in carbohydrates it seemed likely that hormones regulate glycoconjugate biosynthesis in the endocervix. To investigate this possibility, the synthesis of O- and N-linked glycoproteins was studied in cell-free preparations from endocervical epithelium. The activity of N-acetylgalactosaminyl (GalNAc) transferase, the first enzyme in the pathway for O-linked oligosaccharide chain biosynthesis, measured in microsomes prepared from the developing cervix, was increased 8-fold. Oligosaccharyltransferase, the enzyme that catalyzes the first step in the attachment of N-linked oligosaccharide chains to proteins, was measured in microsomes prepared under the same conditions as those used for GalNAc transferase. The results of two independent assay methods revealed an estrogen-dependent 10- to 15-fold increase in oligosaccharyltransferase during cervical differentiation. Consistent with these developmental effects, ovariectomy of adult rabbits resulted in reduced (P less than 0.01) titers of serum estradiol and a 2-fold reduction in the specific activity of GalNAc transferase. When animals were treated with exogenous estradiol, GalNAc transferase activity returned to estrous control levels. The antagonistic action of progesterone on GalNAc transferase activity was verified using endocervical membranes from pseudopregnant animals. Similarly, oligosaccharyltransferase activity was reduced 2- to 3-fold when estrous animals were ovariectomized or made pseudopregnant. The treatment of ovariectomized animals with estradiol resulted in the restoration of oligosaccharyltransferase to estrous control values. Collectively, these results provide the first definitive evidence that hormones can regulate the activity of the enzymes involved in the attachment of O- and N-linked oligosaccharide chains to proteins in the endocervix.\r"

Clonidine treatment evoked a significant dose-dependent increase in urine output. A 20-fold elevation was noted after the highest clonidine dose (2 micrograms/rat). The observed diuresis was accompanied by enhanced sodium excretion, which with the highest dose (2 micrograms) of clonidine increased from 1.6 +/- 0.36 to 39.4 +/- 10.5 meq/liter (P less than 0.001). Plasma IR-ANF rose from 30.7 +/- 8.8 to 113.3 +/- 32.3 pg/ml plasma 5 min after the 0.5 micrograms clonidine dose (P less than 0.05), and urinary cGMP excretion was augmented from 8.49 +/- 4.29 to 27.7 +/- 5.0 pmol/min 1 h after 0.5 micrograms clonidine (P less than 0.05). Pretreatment with peripherally administered anti-ANF serum abolished the diuretic effect of intracerebroventricularly administered clonidine; urine output decreased from 1.49 +/- 0.41 to 0.42 +/- 0.21 ml/h. The urinary cGMP level after anti-ANF serum treatment fell from 25.0 +/- 7.56 to 7.1 +/- 3.5 pmol/min (P less than 0.05). Peripheral pretreatment with the alpha 2-antagonist yohimbine or the opioid antagonist naloxone partially abolished clonidine's diuretic impact: urine output dropped from 1.91 +/- 0.55 to 0.42 +/- 0.18 and 0.46 +/- 0.18 ml/h (P less than 0.05), respectively. At the same time, plasma IR-ANF decreased from 113.3 +/- 32.2 to 30.3 +/- 11.4 after yohimbine and to 24.6 +/- 12.1 pg/ml after naloxone treatment (P less than 0.05). These data suggest that ANF may be involved in the mechanism of diuresis of centrally applied clonidine, which appears to enhance ANF release through its central stimulation of opiate and alpha 2-adrenergic receptors.\r"

  ".W": "To identify and/or quantify type I T4 5'-monodeiodinase (5'-MD) immunologically, polyclonal antibodies were produced by immunization of rabbits with solubilized microsomal proteins (SMP) from rat liver. Pilot studies showed that the antibody binds to, but does not neutralize, rat liver enzyme. We have employed the polyclonal antibody to develop a 5'-MD enzyme binding-inhibiting assay (MBIA). For this purpose, active, inactive, or synthetic 5'-MD was preincubated with rabbit antibody and removed by Staphylococcus aureus protein-A (Staph-A). The 5'-MD-binding sites that were left on the Staph-A-bound rabbit antibody were assayed by adding active 5'-MD in fresh liver SMP. After centrifugation of Staph-A, the unbound 5'-MD enzyme activity was measured in the supernatant using [125I]rT3 in the presence of dithiothreitol. Incubation with 3.2 +/- 0.9 micrograms (mean +/- SEM; n = 4) rat liver SMP inhibited the binding of active 5'-MD to protein-A-bound antibody by 50%. Based on doses with similar 50% binding inhibitory activity, liver SMP were 2.3 times more potent than liver microsomes and 19 times more potent than liver homogenate; liver nuclei and mitochondria showed little or no inhibition of the binding of 5'-MD to antibody. The relative 5'-MD content of liver, kidney, pituitary, placenta, and cerebral cortex based on relative potency in the MBIA approximated 100:25:8:3:3. The threshold of the MBIA approximated 0.9 micrograms liver SMP/tube. The coefficient of variation approximated 2% within an assay and 6% between assays. To obtain a cDNA clone for 5'-MD we used the SMP antibody to screen a rat liver lambda gt11 cDNA expression library. Of 16 positive (antibody-reactive) clones that were isolated, the fusion proteins from only 2 (no. 23 and 54) inhibited the binding of 5'-MD in rat liver SMP to protein-A-bound rabbit antibody in a dose-dependent manner. Western blot analysis showed that the molecular size of liver protein encoded by clones 23 and 54 approximates 31K. Sequence analysis showed that clone 23 insert is 804 basepairs long, contains a single long open-reading frame, and is identical to clone 54. Southern blot analysis showed that clones 23 and 54 did not cross-hybridize DNA from other SMP antibody-positive clones. Northern blot analysis using clone 23 insert cDNA as the probe showed a hybridization band corresponding to a mRNA approximating 2.8 kilobases.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "To ascertain if reductions in fetal plasma cortisol cause increases in fetal plasma ACTH, we treated pregnant ewes or their fetuses with aminoglutethimide (10 mg/kg BW) and metyrapone (20 mg/kg BW) and measured the hormonal responses with RIAs. When given to fetuses (n = 9) at 0.90 +/- 0.01 gestation (term-145 days), the steroid synthesis inhibitors reduced fetal plasma cortisol from 35.1 +/- 11.9 to 18.5 +/- 6.2 ng/ml (P less than 0.01) and plasma ACTH increased from 37 +/- 7 to 189 +/- 74 pg/ml (P less than 0.02). Thus, late in gestation cortisol from the fetal adrenal suppresses basal fetal ACTH secretion. Blockade of steroid biosynthesis in pregnant ewes carrying intact fetuses at 0.76 +/- 0.02 gestation (n = 11) or adrenalectomized fetuses at 0.81 +/- 0.01 gestation (n = 6) also reduced cortisol and increased ACTH in fetal plasma. In intact fetuses cortisol declined from 9.4 +/- 2.0 to 3.6 +/- 0.9 ng/ml (P less than 0.05), and ACTH increased from 46 +/- 8 to 183 +/- 67 (P less than 0.01); cortisol declined in adrenalectomized fetuses from 2.1 +/- 0.4 to 1.1 +/- 0.3 ng/ml (P less than 0.01), and ACTH increased from 106 +/- 13 to 400 +/- 104 pg/ml (P less than 0.01). Cortisol infusions into intact and adrenalectomized fetuses prevented both the decline in steroid concentration caused by the biosynthesis inhibitors given to the ewe and the increase in fetal plasma ACTH concentration. These data indicate that reductions in plasma cortisol in adrenalectomized fetuses or intact fetuses at a time in development when the fetal adrenal produces little cortisol cause compensatory increases in fetal plasma ACTH concentration. The simplest explanation for these observations is that from approximately 0.70 gestation, basal fetal ACTH secretion is tonically inhibited by cortisol circulating in fetal plasma. This cortisol can originate from sources other than the fetal adrenal.\r"

Purified o-inhibin was a potent inhibitor of basal FSH secretion (IC50 = 3.4 pM) and 10 nM GnRH-stimulated FSH and LH secretion (IC50 = 8.8 and 18.4 pM, respectively). Purified o-inhibin had no effect on basal LH secretion. In this system, the androgens testosterone, 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone, and androstenedione slightly stimulated basal FSH secretion, and o-inhibin could reverse this stimulatory effect. By contrast, androgens suppress GnRH-stimulated FSH and LH secretion. In combination, androgens and o-inhibin provided greater inhibition of GnRH-mediated gonadotropin secretion than either did alone.\r"

TRH was present in freshly isolated islets and in newly formed fetal islets in culture. However, while the TRH concentration in freshly isolated islets measured by RIA followed the same ontogenic pattern as that in the total pancreas, peaking during the first week of life (78 pg/micrograms DNA on day 4) and decreasing thereafter to reach 4 pg/micrograms DNA on day 14, the TRH content of fetal islets in culture did not decrease with time (65 pg/micrograms DNA on day 1 and 80 pg/micrograms DNA after 3 weeks in culture). Similarly, using immunocytochemistry, immunoreactive cells were only seen at day 2 in freshly isolated islets. In contrast, in fetal islets, TRH cells were present throughout the culture period. In both experimental systems, TRH was localized in beta-cells. PAMase activity paralleled TRH concentration, peaking during the first week of life in freshly isolated islets and remaining unchanged in the fetal islets in culture. PAMase activity is, therefore, present in the endocrine pancreas. The results suggest that PAMase activity is a rate-limiting step in TRH biosynthesis in this tissue.\r"

  ".W": "The role of calcium (Ca) in the cellular action of arginine vasopressin (AVP) was examined in rat renal papillary collecting tubule cells in culture. AVP increased both the cellular free Ca concentration ([Ca2+]i) using fura-2, and cAMP production in a dose-dependent manner. AVP-induced cellular Ca mobilization was totally blocked by the antagonist to the antidiuretic action of AVP, and somewhat weakened by the antagonist to the vascular action of AVP. 1-Deamino-8-D-AVP (dDAVP). an antidiuretic analog of AVP, also increased [Ca2+] significantly. Cellular Ca mobilization was not obtained with cAMP, forskolin (a diterpene activator of adenylate cyclase), or phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate. The early phase of [Ca2+]i depended on the intracellular Ca pool, since an AVP-induced rise in [Ca2+]i was obtained in cells pretreated with Ca-free medium containing 1 mM EGTA, verapamil, or cobalt, which blocked cellular Ca uptake. Also, AVP increased 45Ca2+ influx during the initial 10 min, which initiated the sustained phase of cellular Ca mobilization. However, cellular cAMP production induced by AVP during the 10-min observation period was diminished in the cells pretreated with Ca-free medium, verapamil, or cobalt, but was still significantly higher than the basal level. This was also diminished by a high Ca concentration in medium. These results indicate that 1) AVP concomitantly regulates cellular free Ca as well as its second messenger cAMP production; 2) AVP-induced elevation of cellular free Ca is dependent on both the cellular Ca pool and extracellular Ca; and 3) there is an optimal level of extracellular Ca to modulate the AVP action in renal papillary collecting tubule cells.\r"

  ".W": "The mechanism by which gonadal steroids modulate GH secretion is not known. We have used the reverse hemolytic plaque assay to examine whether gonadal steroid-induced modulation of GH secretion is effected by changes in the population of somatotrophs and/or alterations in their secretory properties. Two groups of Sprague-Dawley rats were studied: group 1 (n = 6) comprised male (M), castrate (Cx), and testosterone-replaced castrate male (Cx + T) rats and group 2 (n = 5) consisted of male (M), female (F), and 17 beta-estradiol-replaced castrate male (Cx + E) rats. The number of plaque-forming cells (expressed as both absolute number and a percentage of all cells) was determined, and secretory status was assessed by measuring plaque areas in response to 0, 0.01, 0.1, 1, 10, and 100 nM GHRH. While mean basal GH plaque areas were similar among the treatment groups of group 1, the maximal GH plaque area was significantly decreased in Cx [16.8 +/- 2.4 vs. 26.4 +/- 3.9 X 10(6) microns2 (mean +/- SEM); P less than 0.05], but not in Cx + T (27.5 +/- 4.1 microns2) rats. The GHRH EC50 was unaffected by castration or T replacement. The percentage and absolute population of somatotrophs were reduced in Cx, but not in Cx + T, rats, while the numbers of lactotrophs remained unchanged in these treatment groups. For group 2, the mean peak GH plaque area was reduced in Cx + E (16.5 +/- 2.9 microns2; P less than 0.001) compared to that in M rats (36.2 +/- 2.3 microns2), but was not significantly different from that in F (13.0 +/- 1.5 microns2) rats. The EC50 was significantly (P less than 0.025) greater in Cx + E (10.9 +/- 2.3 nM) and F (7.9 +/- 1.6 nM) compared to M rats (2.8 +/- 0.7 nM). The absolute somatotroph and lactotroph populations were increased in Cx + E compared to M and F rats, as were the populations of other pituitary cell types. Testosterone enhances GH secretion by increasing the secretory capacity, but not the sensitivity, of somatotrophs to GHRH and by recruiting the function of a subpopulation of somatotrophs. Estradiol reduces the secretory capacity and sensitivity of somatotrophs to GHRH, but increases the population of somatotrophs, lactotrophs, and non-GH- and non-PRL-secreting cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Recent studies conducted in our laboratory have demonstrated that plasminogen activator (PA) is present in granulosa cells collected from the largest preovulatory follicle in the ovary of the domestic hen, and that its activity can be modulated by a variety of hormones in vitro. The present study was conducted to evaluate the intracellular mechanisms involved in the control of hen granulosa cell PA activity through the use of physiological and pharmacological agents. Treatment of granulosa cells with increasing doses (1, 10, and 50 ng/tube) of ovine LH resulted in a significant reduction of PA activity, which was accompanied by an increase in intracellular levels of cAMP. Furthermore, the effects of LH were potentiated by cotreatment with the phosphodiesterase inhibitor 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (0.1 mM). Exposure of cells to increasing concentrations of the adenylyl cyclase activator forskolin (0.005, 0.01, 0.05, and 0.1 mM) resulted in a significant reduction in PA activity at all doses given. Similarly, the presence of the cAMP analog 8-bromo-cAMP (0.005, 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 1.5, and 10 mM) caused a dose-dependent inhibition of PA activity from 0.005 to 1.0 mM, further suggesting the involvement of cAMP in the inhibitory regulation of hen granulosa cell PA activity. The induction of intracellular calcium mobilization through the use of the calcium ionophore A23187 (0.1, 0.5, 1, and 2 microM) resulted in a dose-dependent suppression of PA activity. By contrast, treatment of granulosa cells with the tumor-promoting phorbol ester phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA; 0.5, 5, 10, 25, and 50 micrograms/tube), a compound that activates protein kinase-C, stimulated PA activity in a dose-dependent fashion; a non-tumor-promoting phorbol ester (phorbol 13-monoacetate; 0.5, 10, and 50 ng/tube) was without effect. Coincubation of granulosa cells with a submaximal dose of PMA (5 ng/tube) and low concentrations of A23187 (0.001, 0.005, 0.01, and 0.05 microM) could not significantly enhance the stimulatory effects of PMA on PA activity; however, higher concentrations of the ionophore (0.1, 0.5, and 1.0 microM) completely abolished PMA-stimulated PA activity. The stimulatory effects of PMA could also be eliminated by cotreatment with a protein kinase-C inhibitor (H-7; 100 microM), a mRNA transcription blocker (actinomycin-D; 5 micrograms/tube), or a protein synthesis inhibitor (cycloheximide; 50 micrograms/tube).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

In the rhesus monkey after the same dose of FSH an increase in the number of Ap spermatogonia to 152% was found after 16 days. When a dose of 25 IU FSH was administered to cynomolgus monkeys three times per week for 16 days the number of Ap spermatogonia increased to only 131% of the control level. After all treatments no effect on the number of Adark (Ad) spermatogonia was found. It was concluded that the increased levels of plasma FSH caused a specific increase in the number of Ap spermatogonia. The increased number of A spermatogonia gave rise to an increase in the number of B spermatogonia after 16 days of treatment which in turn produced more spermatocytes between 16 and 28 days of treatment. If the FSH was administered for a period of 28 days the number of round spermatids also showed a 2-fold increase. These findings indicate a correlation between plasma FSH levels and the numbers of germinal cells in the seminiferous epithelium. In monkeys treated with 450 IU human CG daily no effect on the numbers of the A spermatogonia was observed.\r"

  ".U": "88296332\r", 
  ".W": "Somatostatin (SRIF) and GRFs play key roles in regulating GH secretion. We previously presented a model of SRIF-cAMP interaction; SRIF blocks rat (r) GH release without preventing its accumulation in a potentially releasable pool. This phenomenon may represent a mechanism whereby tonic SRIF inhibition and its subsequent reduction or withdrawal can modulate the magnitude if not the initiation of rGH pulses. Herein we test that model using human GRF-44 (hGRF-44). Tritium-prelabeled rat anterior pituitary fragments were perifused until stored [3H]rGH and [3H]rPRL release rates were stable. SRIF (10 or 25 nM), with and without hGRF-44 (3 or 10 nM), was added in short (1-h hGRF-44) and long (3-h hGRF-44) protocols; SRIF was then withdrawn while hGRF-44 was continued. Release of stored prelabeled [3H]rGH and [3H]rPRL was assessed by immunoprecipitation. Effects on PRL release were followed for comparison. SRIF-induced inhibition of release was only partially reversed by hGRF-44. At these concentrations and so long as SRIF was present, hGRF-44 could not stimulate the rate of hormone release to values above pre-SRIF basal rates. On the other hand, the amplitude of post-SRIF rebound release was increased by prolonging exposure to SRIF alone, by including hGRF-44 with SRIF, by increasing the amount of hGRF-44 included with SRIF, by prolonging exposure to hGRF-44 plus SRIF, and by using a smaller concentration of SRIF during exposure to hGRF-44. Interaction of hGRF-44-SRIF effects generated peak rates of hormone release after SRIF withdrawal which exceeded the maximum rates achieved using hGRF-44 alone in this system. Lactotroph responses were much smaller, but qualitatively resembled somatotroph responses. We conclude that the interplay of simultaneous hGRF-44 and SRIF effects can regulate the amplitude of rGH pulses. Although GRF can initiate physiological GH release, and GRF antisera can block GH pulses, we suggest that the surge of release that follows reduction of SRIF-induced inhibitory tone in vitro represents a potential mechanism that could contribute to the initiation of some pulses of release. Finally, we also present a theoretical model of secretagogue interactions at the cellular level to explain our results. The model is compatible with either a homogeneous cell population in which each secretory cell has multiple capabilities or a heterogeneous cell population composed of cell subgroups with complementary secretory abilities.\r"

To assess the role of metalloproteinase inhibitors in the ovulatory process, inhibitor activity was examined in human follicular fluid collected 2-4 h before ovulation. The relationship between inhibitor activity and steroid content was determined, and the inhibitors were partially purified and characterized. Inhibitory activity in follicular fluid (n = 25) correlated with both follicular estradiol (P less than 0.001) and progesterone (P less than 0.02) concentrations per follicle. Chromatographic separation of the follicular fluid on Sepharose 6B isolated two peaks of inhibitory activity. The inhibitor from the small mol wt (Mr) peak shared many of the properties of tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase. It was stable in response to heat (60 C) and methylamine (200 mM), and was destroyed by reduction and alkylation, a procedure reported to destroy previously characterized inhibitors. Partial purification by affinity and ion exchange chromatography demonstrated the inhibitor to be a glycoprotein with an approximate Mr of 28-29K. The large Mr inhibitor had an approximate size of 700K and exhibited many of the characteristics of alpha 2-macroglobulin, a serum-derived metalloproteinase inhibitor. It was sensitive to heat, methylamine, and reduction and alkylation. Thus, follicular fluid contains metalloproteinase inhibitor activity that is steroid related and may be hormonally regulated. Ovarian metalloproteinase inhibitors may act to regulate connective tissue remodeling during follicular rupture.\r"

The mechanisms subserving this synergism included the following. 1) FSH increased by 2.1-fold the number of specific high affinity low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors on granulosa cells, with no change in apparent binding affinity. 2) FSH augmented by 1.8- and 3.6-fold the maximal rates of [125I]iodo-LDL internalization and degradation, respectively, without altering half-maximally effective concentrations of LDL supporting these processes. 3) FSH increased significantly the mass (micrograms) of free and esterified cholesterol (measured by fluorometry) contained in granulosa cells. 4) FSH stimulated the intracellular accumulation of free [3H]cholesterol and [3H]cholesteryl ester from exogenous [3H]cholesteryl linoleate-labeled LDL and amplified [3H]progesterone secretion by granulosa cells exposed to this source of lipoprotein-borne sterol. 5) The stimulatory effects of FSH on LDL degradation and cholesterol side-chain cleavage activity were mimicked by other activators of granulosa cell cAMP production, e.g. forskolin and cholera toxin. We conclude that FSH and LDL synergistically enhance progesterone biosynthesis by swine granulosa cells via cellular mechanisms that result in significantly augmented binding, internalization, and degradation of LDL in concert with increased effectual utilization of sterol substrate in the cholesterol side-chain cleavage reaction. These observations are consistent with a key trophic role for FSH in regulating the sterol-metabolizing ability and steroidogenic differentiation of granulosa cells and indicate that such actions of FSH can be accounted for by activation of the cAMP-effector pathway.\r"

Treatment with suboptimal replacement doses of 0.15 and 0.75 micrograms T4/100 g BW.day produced a graded depression of plasma TSH in the PVN (P less than 0.02), but not in the sham (P greater than 0.8) groups. Adenohypophyseal 5'-D was depressed in both sham and PVN groups by the highest T4 dose. Plasma T4 was much lower in PVN than in sham rats given comparable doses of T4 (P less than 0.001), but plasma T3 was not significantly different. This suggests that an increase in peripheral T4 metabolism was produced by PVN lesions. Our data indicate that changes in adenohypophyseal 5'-D activity are not responsible for the decrease in plasma TSH in PVN-lesioned rats and that neither the PVN nor endogenous TRH plays a significant role in the regulation of anterior pituitary 5'-D activity.\r"

  ".W": "In order to define the roles of cAMP and inositol phosphates (IPx) in the mechanisms governing dopamine (DA)-regulated PRL release, we have carried out studies with enriched lactotrophs from dispersed anterior pituitaries of estrogen-treated rats. Changes in the intracellular levels of cAMP as well as IPx were determined in response to the acute addition or removal of DA. The withdrawal of DA from the incubation medium in cells cultured with DA (500 nM) for 24 h resulted in a rapid and significant increase in cAMP concentration from 1.29 +/- 0.098 to 3.89 +/- 0.199 pmol/dish. On the other hand, the administration of DA for 10 min to cells cultured without it resulted in a significant decrease in intracellular cAMP (from 3.04 +/- 0.208 to 1.62 +/- 0.057 pmol/dish). Similarly, PRL released into the medium was stimulated (95.1 +/- 9%) or inhibited (46.9 +/- 6%) after DA withdrawal or addition, respectively. Cells incubated 24 h with [3H]inositol and DA (500 nM) responded to DA withdrawal with a significant increase in the concentration of [3H]IPx (5148 +/- 199 vs. 8,376 +/- 164 cpm/dish), whereas acute DA administration had no effect on the level of [3H]IPx. The administration of 8-Br-cAMP (0.5 and 2.5 mM) and forskolin (10 microM) for 10 min to cells tonically cultured in the presence of DA had no effect on the intracellular concentration of [3H]IPx, although they decreased the relative proportion of [3H]IP3 fraction from 22.1% to 11.6%, 13.6%, and 9.6%, respectively. The administration of TRH (100 nM), either under tonic DA inhibition or 10 min after the transient removal of DA inhibition, resulted in a similar stimulation of IPx formation (from 5,625 +/- 155 to 21,830 +/- 100 and 24,870 +/- 80 cpm/dish, respectively). However, the release of PRL induced by TRH was potentiated 6-fold (38.2 +/- 2.17 vs. 227 +/- 41 ng/dish) by the transient removal of DA. These findings support the conclusions that: 1) DA receptors in lactotrophs are negatively coupled to adenylate cyclase as seen during the addition or removal of DA. 2) DA receptors are negatively coupled to phospholipase C; however activation is only seen upon the removal of DA. 3) The effect of DA withdrawal on the formation of IPx is not secondary to the activation of adenylate cyclase. 4) The potentiation of the PRL response to TRH after DA withdrawal does not involve increased production of IPx.\r"

We imposed a severe IRL on pentobarbital sodium-anesthetized dogs, followed by bilateral vagotomy, then by supplemental O2. IRL alone produced rapid shallow breathing associated with hypercapnia and hypoxia. After the vagotomy, the breathing pattern became slow and deep, restoring arterial PCO2 but not arterial PO2 toward the control values. Relief of hypoxia had no effect, and at no time was there any evidence of fatigue of the diaphragm as measured by the response to phrenic nerve stimulation. We conclude that an intact afferent vagal pathway is necessary for the tachypnea resulting from a severe IRL, neither hypoxia nor diaphragm fatigue played a role, and, although we cannot rule out stimulation of vagal afferents, the simplest explanation for the increased frequency in our experiments is increased respiratory drive due to hypercapnia.\r"

  ".W": "Static muscular contraction has been firmly established to reflexly increase cardiovascular and ventilatory function. Although group III and IV fibers with endings in muscle have been shown to comprise the afferent arm of this reflex arc, little is known about the nature of the contraction-induced stimulus causing the activation of these fibers. This stimulus has often been suggested to be a metabolic product of muscular contraction. We have therefore recorded the impulse activity of group III and IV afferents with endings in the triceps surae muscles of barbiturate-anesthetized cats while we injected into the femoral artery substances believed to be metabolic products of muscular contraction. We found that lithium and sodium lactate (400 mM; 1 ml) had little or no effect on the discharge of group III and IV afferents. Likewise, monobasic sodium phosphate (20 and 400 mM; 1 ml) and 2-chloroadenosine (50-100 micrograms) had only trivial effects on the discharge of these afferents. By contrast, lactic acid (25 and 400 mM; 1 ml) and arachidonic acid (0.5-2.0 mg) caused significant increases in the activity of group III and IV afferents. Most of the excitatory effect of arachidonic acid on the discharge of the afferents was prevented by indomethacin, a cyclooxygenase inhibitor. We conclude that of the substances tested in our experiments, lactic acid and some cyclooxygenase products, such as prostaglandins and thromboxanes, are the most likely to be responsible for any metabolic stimulation of group III and IV afferents during muscular contraction.\r"

However, the combined effect on rat epitrochlearis muscle permeability to 3-O-methylglucose (3-MG) of a maximal insulin stimulus followed by in vitro contractile activity of 1.24 +/- 0.06 mumol.10 min-1.ml intracellular water-1 was no greater than that of either stimulus alone. We found that this absence of an additive effect was caused by prolonged exposure to an unphysiologically high insulin concentration (20,000 microU/ml for 60 min), which, in addition to stimulating glucose transport, appears to prevent further increases in permeability to glucose. When the treatments were reversed and muscles were first stimulated to contract and then incubated with 20,000 microU/ml insulin, 3-MG uptake (mumol.10 min-1.ml intracellular water-1) increased from a control value of 0.26 +/- 0.03 to 1.80 +/- 0.15, compared with 1.04 +/- 0.06 for contractile activity alone, 1.21 +/- 0.08 for insulin, and 1.88 +/- 0.11 for exercise (swimming) plus insulin. Swimming plus in vitro contractile activity did not have a greater effect than contractile activity alone. Our results provide evidence that 1) the effect of exercise on muscle permeability to glucose is mediated solely by a process associated with contractile activity, and 2) it is advisable to avoid the use of unphysiologically high insulin concentrations in studies designed to elucidate in vivo actions of insulin.\r"

All three Bohr factors proved to be dependent on SO2, although to a lesser extent than reported in some of the recent literature. At SO2 = 50% and 37 degrees C, we found phi H = -0.428 +/- 0.010 (SE), phi C = 0.054 +/- 0.006, and phi HC = -0.488 +/- 0.007. The values obtained for phi H, phi C, and d log PCO2/dpH were used to calculate phi HC. Calculated and measured values of phi HC proved to be in good agreement. In an additional series of 12 specimens of human blood we determined the influence of PCO2 on phi H and the influence of pH on phi C. At SO2 = 50%, phi H varied from -0.49 +/- 0.009 at PCO2 = 15 Torr to -0.31 +/- 0.010 at PCO2 = 105 Torr and phi C from 0.157 +/- 0.015 at pH = 7.80 to 0.006 +/- 0.009 at pH = 7.00.

  ".U": "88298493\r", 
  ".W": "When systemic delivery of oxygen (QO2 = blood flow X arterial O2 content) is reduced, the systemic O2 extraction ratio [(CaO2 - CVO2)/CaO2; where CaO2 is arterial O2 content and CVO2 is venous O2 content] increases until a critical limit is reached below which O2 uptake (VO2) becomes limited by delivery. Patients with adult respiratory distress syndrome and sepsis exhibit supply dependence of VO2 even at high levels of QO2, which suggests that a peripheral O2 extraction defect may be present. We tested the hypothesis that endotoxemia might produce a similar defect in the efficacy of tissue O2 extraction by determining the whole-body critical systemic QO2 (QO2 c) and critical extraction ratio in a control group of dogs and a group receiving a 5-mg/kg dose of Escherichia coli endotoxin. QO2 c was determined in each group by measuring VO2 as QO2 was gradually reduced by bleeding. The VO2 and QO2 of an isolated segment of small intestine were also measured to determine whether O2 extraction was impaired within a local region of tissue. The dogs were anesthetized, paralyzed, and ventilated with room air. Systemic QO2 was reduced in stages by hemorrhage as hematocrit was maintained. The systemic and intestinal critical points were determined from a plot of VO2 vs. QO2. The mean systemic QO2 c and critical O2 extraction ratio of the endotoxemic group (12.8 +/- 2.0 and 0.54 +/- 0.11 ml.min-1.kg-1) were significantly different from control (6.8 +/- 1.2 and 0.78 +/- 0.04) (P less than 0.001), indicating that endotoxin administration impaired systemic extraction of O2. Endotoxin also increased base-line systemic VO2 [6.1 +/- 0.7 (before) to 7.4 +/- 0.1 (after)] (P less than 0.001). The critical and maximal intestinal O2 extraction ratios of the endotoxemic group (0.47 +/- 0.10 and 0.71 +/- 0.04) were significantly less than control (0.69 +/- 0.06 and 0.83 +/- 0.05) (P less than 0.001). In addition, intestinal reactive hyperemia disappeared in six of seven endotoxemic dogs, whereas it remained intact in all control dogs. Thus endotoxin reduced the ability of tissues to extract O2 from a limited supply at the whole body level as well as within a 40- to 50-g segment of small intestine. These results could be explained by a defect in microvascular regulation of blood flow that interfered with the optimal distribution of a limited QO2 in accordance with tissue O2 needs.\r"

  ".W": "To test the hypothesis that lung affected by acute bacterial pneumonia consumes significant amounts of O2, whole-body O2 consumption (VO2) was measured simultaneously by collection of expired gas (VO2exp) and by the Fick principle (VO2Fick) in five dogs with acute experimental pneumococcal pneumonia and in five uninfected controls. This approach is based on the premise that VO2Fick will not detect lung VO2, whereas the expired gas measurement represents the true whole-body VO2, including the lung. In controls VO2 exp averaged 110 +/- 20 ml/min (4.78 +/- 0.78 ml.min-1.kg-1), and VO2Fick was nearly identical at 114 +/- 21 ml/min (4.96 +/- 0.79 ml.min-1.kg-1). The VO2Fick in the pneumonia group was 127 ml/min, similar to both control group values when indexed for body weight (4.91 +/- 1.17 ml.min-1.kg-1). VO2exp, however, was 146 +/- 46 ml/min (5.74 +/- 1.57 ml.min-1.kg-1), exceeding VO2Fick by an average of 20 +/- 9 ml/min (P less than 0.01). This between-method difference of 20 +/- 9 ml/min (or 24 ml/min if the difference in the control group is assumed to apply to the pneumonia group) amounted to 13-15% of whole-body VO2 and can be attributed to VO2 in the lung, presumably by cells involved in the acute inflammatory response. Implications include the potential for significant underestimate of whole-body VO2 by the Fick method when used in the presence of lung inflammation and overestimate of blood flow to shunting or low ventilation-perfusion ratio lung units by the O2 method of measuring venous admixture-like perfusion. This observation may also explain the disproportionate hypoxemia sometimes seen in patients with severe pneumonia.\r"

To test this hypothesis, the relationship between pulmonary leukotriene (LT) synthesis in response to hypoxia and alterations in pulmonary hemodynamics was evaluated in pentobarbital sodium-anesthetized, neuromuscular-blocked, male, mongrel dogs. A reduction in the fraction of inspired O2 (FIO2) in vehicle-treated animals (n = 12) from 0.21 to 0.10 was associated with increases in LTC4 and LTD4 in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). After 30 min of continuous hypoxia, LTC4 and LTD4 increased from control values of 59.4 +/- 10.4 and 91.7 +/- 18.1 ng/lavage to 142.7 +/- 31.8 (P less than 0.05) and 156.3 +/- 25.3 (P less than 0.01) ng/lavage, respectively. Concomitantly, mean pulmonary arterial pressure (Ppa) and pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) were increased over control by 67 +/- 7 (P less than 0.001) and 62 +/- 7% (P less than 0.001), respectively. In contrast, in animals treated with diethylcarbamazine (n = 5), a leukotriene A4 synthase inhibitor, identical reductions in FIO2 were not associated with increases in LTC4 and LTD4 in BALF, although at the same time period, Ppa and PVR were increased over control by 60 +/- 13 (P less than 0.05) and 112 +/- 31% (P less than 0.05), respectively. These results, therefore, do not support the contention that leukotrienes mediate hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction in dogs.\r"

Before, during, and after HV, end-tidal PCO2 (PETCO2) was maintained at a given level between resting and 60 Torr. After cessation of HV, hyperpnea was seen in 179 out of a total of 195 runs but in the remaining 16 runs in 3 subjects hypopnea occurred, both ventilatory changes being followed by slow recovery to the pre-HV level. The time constant (tau) of the decay process of post-HV hyperpnea was calculated and compared between the follicular (F) and luteal (L) phases of menstruation. For post-HV hypopnea, tau was assumed to be zero. There was an inverse correlation between tau and PETCO2 during the test, the relation being similar in F and L. With a phase change from F to L, tau value at resting PETCO2 increased from 17.7 to 23.7 s. Resting PETCO2 decreased from 40.8 to 37.7 Torr, and minute ventilation (VE) increased by 10%. The increased tau in L was ascribable to the decrease in resting PETCO2 but not to the increased ventilatory activity during the pre-HV period (corresponding to the resting VE) that was probably produced by ventilatory stimulation with progesterone in L. From these results, it is inferred that the ventilatory influence of progesterone might not be exerted on the brain stem, which has been implicated as a locus of the afterdischarge mechanism.\r"

The system utilizes the principle of discontinuous gas collection at any selected point of the respiratory cycle facilitated by ultraspeed piezoelectric valves and includes provision for sample-hold characteristics. Two distinct modes of operation are supported. In phase-locked mode gas sampling is synchronous with breathing frequency. In scanning mode gas collection is asynchronous with breathing frequency. Phase-locked mode may be used for continuous monitoring of end-tidal gas concentrations, whereas scanning mode is intended for assessing the gas concentration profile throughout the respiratory cycle. The system may be applied to steady breathing encountered in mechanical ventilation at high frequency or during quasi-steady breathing observed in panting animals. Combined with a respiratory mass spectrometer, the system has been used for measurement of gas concentrations in alveolar gas mixtures at breathing frequencies ranging from 3 to 30 Hz that were otherwise not amenable to rapid measuring techniques.\r"

The upper airway was functionally isolated into a closed system.

The negative pressure pulses produced a reversible inhibition of inspiration in most trials with resultant increase in inspiratory duration (TI); no change was observed in peak diaphragmatic electromyogram (Dia EMG) or expiratory duration, whereas a decrease was seen in mean inspiratory drive (peak Dia EMG/TI). This prolongation of inspiratory duration and decrease in mean inspiratory drive with negative pressure pulses persisted at higher levels of CO2; the slopes of the test breaths were not significantly different from that of control breaths. These results suggest that upper airway negative pressure pulses are equally effective in altering the breathing pattern at all levels of CO2.\r"

Cyanide-insensitive respiration measurements were done in collapsed and contralateral lungs, as an index of intracellular free radical production. Rabbits' right lungs were collapsed for 7 days after which the animals were killed. We found that control rabbit lungs contained approximately 25 SOD units/mg DNA measured with 10(-5) M KCN (total SOD) and approximately 11 SOD units/mg DNA measured with 10(-3) M KCN (mitochondrial or MnSOD). Right lung collapse caused a 25% decrease in mitochondrial SOD activity after 7 days (P less than 0.05), whereas no significant changes occurred in right or left lungs' total SOD activity. In control rabbits cyt ox activity averaged approximately 0.009 mumol ferrocytochrome c.min-1.mg DNA-1. Right lung collapse caused a greater than 40% decrease in cyt ox activity after 7 days of collapse (P less than 0.05), whereas cyt ox activity in contralateral left lungs did not change. Pyruvate kinase activity, a marker for anaerobic glycolysis resulting from tissue hypoxia, increased 49% in collapsed right lungs (P less than 0.01). Cyanide-insensitive respiration was 83% higher in 7 day-collapsed lungs (2.28 +/- 0.66 microliters O2.min-1.g-1) compared with contralateral lungs (1.24 +/- 0.34, P less than 0.05), indicating increased O2-. and H2O2 production in this tissue after homogenization at normoxic PO2 (approximately 150 Torr).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Ascaris suum antigen effects on mean airflow resistance (RL) and bronchial arterial blood flow (Qbr) were studied in allergic anesthetized sheep with documented airway responses. Qbr was measured with electromagnetic flow probes, and supplemental O2 prevented antigen-induced hypoxemia. Aerosol challenge with this specific antigen increased RL and Qbr significantly. Cromolyn sodium aerosol pretreatment prevented antigen-induced increases in RL but not in Qbr. Intravenous cromolyn, however, prevented increases in Qbr and RL, suggesting a role for mast cell degranulation in both bronchomotor and bronchovascular responses to antigen. Antigen-induced increases in Qbr were not solely attributable to histamine release. Indomethacin pretreatment attenuated the antigen-induced increase in Qbr, thus suggesting that vasodilator cyclooxygenase products contribute to the vascular response. Antigen challenge significantly decreased Qbr after indomethacin and metiamide pretreatment, which suggests that vasoconstrictor substances released after antigen exposure also modulate Qbr; however, released vasodilators overshadow vasoconstrictor effects. Thus antigen challenge affects Qbr by locally releasing histamine and vasodilator prostaglandins as well as vasoconstrictor substances. These effects were independent of antigen-induced changes in systemic and pulmonary hemodynamics.\r"

To determine the impact of inflation during HFOV, sustained inflation was applied at pressures of 5, 10, and 15 cmH2O above mean airway pressure for 3, 10, and 30 s to 15 intubated, paralyzed, anesthetized rabbits after saline lavage to induce surfactant deficiency. Arterial blood gases were recorded in all rabbits while static compliance, resistance, time constant, and changes in functional residual capacity were recorded using the interrupter technique and plethysmograph in seven rabbits. Parameters were recorded before and 2 min after sustained inflation. Arterial PO2, compliance of the respiratory system, and functional residual capacity increased after sustained inflation at pressure levels of at least 10 cmH2O and 10-s duration. As the presence or duration of a sustained inflation was increased, oxygenation improved (P less than or equal to 0.01), but arterial PCO2 increased as longer sustained inflations were used (P less than or equal to 0.005). Sustained inflations of 5 cmH2O above mean airway pressure or of 3-s duration were ineffective. We conclude that either a critical pressure or duration of sustained inflation is needed to improve oxygenation and pulmonary mechanics during HFOV.\r"

This ECF acidosis was studied to determine whether it results from high PCO2, carbonic acidosis (accumulation of H2CO3), or lactic acidosis. Twenty rabbits were anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium, paralyzed, and mechanically ventilated with 100% O2. The cerebral cortex was exposed and fitted with thermostatted flat-surfaced pH and PCO2 electrodes. Control values (n = 14) for cortex ECF were pH 7.10 +/- 0.11 (SD), PCO2 42.2 +/- 4.1 Torr, PO2 107 +/- 17 Torr, HCO3- 13.8 +/- 3.0 mM. Control values (n = 14) for arterial blood were arterial pH (pHa) 7.46 +/- 0.03 (SD), arterial PCO2 (PaCO2) 32.0 +/- 4.1 Torr, arterial PO2 (PaO2) 425 +/- 6 Torr, HCO3- 21.0 +/- 2.0 mM. After intravenous infusion of AZ (25 mg/kg), end-tidal PCO2 and brain ECF pH immediately fell and cortex PCO2 rose. Ventilation was increased in nine rabbits to bring ECF PCO2 back to control. The changes in ECF PCO2 then were as follows: pHa + 0.04 +/- 0.09, PaCO2 -8.0 +/- 5.9 Torr, HCO3(-)-2.7 +/- 2.3 mM, PaO2 +49 +/- 62 Torr, and changes in cortex ECF were as follows: pH -0.08 +/- 0.04, PCO2 -0.2 +/- 1.6 Torr, HCO3(-)-1.7 +/- 1.3 mM, PO2 +9 +/- 4 Torr. Thus excess acidity remained in ECF after ECF PCO2 was returned to control values. The response of intracellular pH, high-energy phosphate compounds, and lactic acid to AZ administration was followed in vivo in five other rabbits with 31P and 1H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To demonstrate the relationship of increased CBF to brain O2 availability after AZ administration, a compensated fluorometer was used to study changes in the cerebrocortical redox balance in rabbits. Seven rabbits were anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium. Excitation light (366 nm) was conducted to the cerebrocortical surface of each animal by a 4-mm-diam fiberoptic light guide. Fluorescence emissions from cerebrocortical NADH (450 nm) were compared at different inspired O2 (FIO2) tensions. Reflected light (366 nm), which was used to determine a correction to the fluorescence signal, was separately quantitated and interpreted as an index of cerebrocortical blood volume. Reductions in FIO2 from 1.0 to 0.21, 0.14, 0.10, and 0.07 resulted in increases in both tissue blood volume and [NADH]. Intravenous AZ (25 mg/kg) increased cerebrocortical blood volume and reduced the [NADH], even during ventilation with 100% O2. The changes in brain redox balance caused by vasodilation with AZ were compared with those caused by vasodilatation with CO2. The NAD+/NADH redox state was a continuous function of FIO2 at all levels of arterial PCO2 (PaCO2), both before and after AZ administration. The improvement in cerebral O2 delivery caused by AZ-induced vasodilation was comparable to that caused by the vasodilatation that results from a PaCO2 elevation approximately equal to 12-15 Torr above normal. The slope of the relationship between [NADH] and FIO2 was similar at normal, low, and high levels of PaCO2. We conclude that AZ administration and PaCO2 elevation improve cerebral oxygenation by similar mechanisms.\r"

In the present investigation, energy expenditure is measured simultaneously with doubly labeled water and respirometry at low- and high-activity levels. Over 6 days, five subjects were measured doing mainly sedentary activities like desk work; their average daily metabolic rate was 1.40 +/- 0.09 (SD) times sleeping metabolic rate. Four subjects were measured twice over 3.5 days, including 2 days with heavy bicycle ergometer work, resulting in an average daily metabolic rate of 2.61 +/- 0.25 (SD) times sleeping metabolic rate. At the low-activity level, energy expenditures from the doubly labeled water method were on the average 1.4 +/- 3.9% (SD) larger than those from respirometry. At the high-activity level, the doubly labeled water method yielded values that were 1.0 +/- 7.0% (SD) lower than those from respirometry. Results demonstrate the utility of the doubly labeled water method for the determination of energy expenditure in the range of activity levels in daily life.\r"

ANF increased cellular cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) content and suppressed isoproterenol- and PGE1-elevated, but not basal, cAMP content. Pertussis toxin pretreatment, which maximally ADP-ribosylated Gi, the guanine nucleotide-binding protein that couples inhibitory receptors to adenylate cyclase and blocks receptor-mediated inhibition of adenylate cyclase, did not interfere with ANF suppression of isoproterenol- or PGE1-elevated cellular cAMP content. Preliminary incubation of fibroblasts with 8-bromo cGMP or phosphodiesterase inhibitors, including 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, Ro 20-1724, and cilostamide, however, prevented the ANF suppression of cAMP. MB 22948, an inhibitor that is partially selective for cGMP phosphodiesterase, did not block the effect of ANF. We conclude that in these cells, unlike other systems, ANF reduces cAMP content by activating a phosphodiesterase rather than by inhibiting adenylate cyclase.\r"

  ".W": "Rheumatoid factors (RFs) in humans have been studied intensively because of their association with autoimmune and lymphoproliferative diseases. Many human IgM-RFs express cross-reactive idiotypes (CRIs) and have homologous light chains, some of which are encoded by a single V kappa gene, termed V kappa 325. However, although antibody activity generally requires the interaction between heavy and light chain variable regions, much less is known about structural relationships among RF heavy chains. To delineate further the structural and genetic basis of RF autoantibody synthesis, we generated \"sequence-dependent\" reagents specific for the human heavy and kappa light chain subgroups, and used them to analyze a panel of 27 monoclonal RFs. In addition, these proteins were tested for the expression of a heavy chain-associated CRI (G6), and a light chain-associated CRI (17.109). The results showed that most 17.109-reactive RFs contain heavy chains of the VHI subgroup, which bear the G6 idiotypic marker. However, among the 14 17.109-reactive RFs, two have heavy chains of the VHII subgroup, and another two contain heavy chains of the VHIII subgroup. Previously, we have shown that 17.109 is a phenotypic marker of the human V kappa 325 gene. Accordingly, these results demonstrate that the same human V kappa gene can combine with several VH genes from different VH gene subgroups to generate RF activity.\r"

Because stimuli that enhance neutrophil adhesion also induce up-regulation of surface CR3, it is widely held that these two responses are causally related. We have dissociated CR3 display (immunofluorescence) from CR3 function (aggregation). Neutrophils isolated at 4 degrees C and rewarmed to 37 degrees C up-regulated surface CR3 twofold, but did not aggregate. The kinetics of FMLP-induced CR3 up-regulation were discordant with those of aggregation. In the absence of extracellular divalent cations, CR3 expression increased twofold after exposure to FMLP, but neutrophils did not aggregate. FMLP elicited 3.5-fold more aggregation than the ionophore A23187, yet less than one-half as much CR3 up-regulation. 3 mM sodium salicylate inhibited aggregation 55 +/- 4%, but had no effect on CR3 up-regulation. Conversely, 1 mM tetracaine completely inhibited CR3 up-regulation, while significantly enhancing aggregation. Neutroplasts expressed CR3, but did not up-regulate the receptor; in contrast, FMLP induced CR3-dependent aggregation of neutroplasts. We conclude that, although constitutive surface CR3 is required for neutrophil aggregation, the up-regulation of CR3 is neither necessary nor sufficient to promote cell-cell adhesion.\r"

  ".W": "Three different receptors for the Fc portion of IgG (FcR) have been characterized on human leukocytes. We have identified four healthy members of one family, whose blood phagocytic cells lack functional 72 kD high-affinity FcRI. Their monocytes were unable to bind the Fc portion of mouse (m)-IgG2a and of monomeric human IgG, and they were unreactive with two anti-FcRI monoclonal antibodies. Thus, FcRI is either absent, expressed at very low density, or is so structurally altered as to be unable to bind both its ligand and the anti-FcRI antibodies. The failure to bind the Fc portion of mIgG2a underlies the previously reported inability of these monocytes to support T cell mitogenesis on OKT3 stimulation. FcRI was not inducible upon incubation of their monocytes or neutrophils in gamma interferon. However, their monocytes were able to bind aggregated human IgG, and to phagocytose IgG-coated particles in vitro. Both functions could be blocked with a monoclonal antibody to the 40-kD low-affinity FcRII and therefore apparently were mediated exclusively through FcRII. This also demonstrates that FcRII can mediate phagocytosis independently. Despite the FcRI defect, these subjects had no circulating immune complexes, no evidence of autoimmune pathology and no increased susceptibility to infections.\r"

We examined the effect of endothelial cell growth factor (ECGF) and heparin on PAI-1 expression in human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) culture. The addition of ECGF and heparin to HUVEC cultures results in a 3-10-fold decrease in the PAI-1 activity secreted into the conditioned media. This effect is mediated at the mRNA level. A decrease in PAI-1 is also seen with higher concentrations of ECGF alone, but is greatly enhanced by the addition of heparin. No significant change in tPA antigen or mRNA levels was observed.\r"

Cleavage by purified gelatinase was very slow and could account for only a minor fraction of the activity of neutrophil supernatants. The collagenase preparation was more active. However, the unusual cleavage site, and the ability of fMet-Leu-Phe-stimulated neutrophils to cleave alpha 1-antitrypsin without releasing collagenase, suggests that collagenase is not responsible for cleavage by the cells, which, by implication, is due to an as yet uncharacterized metalloenzyme. Our results demonstrate that by releasing metalloproteinases, neutrophils could proteolytically inactivate alpha 1-antitrypsin at sites of inflammation. This provides an alternative to the previously documented mechanism of inactivation by neutrophil-derived oxidants.\r"

The clinical lesions were ulcers, gangrene, thrombophlebitis, hemorrhage, and cutaneous necrosis. Noninflammatory thrombosis of small dermal vessels was observed in all 8 biopsy specimens from gangrene lesions, 10 of 13 specimens from ulcer lesions, and 2 of 5 specimens from thrombophlebitis lesions. Necrotizing vasculitis was not significant in these biopsy specimens. Immunofluorescence findings included a positive lupus band test in lupus erythematosus-associated disease and nonspecific deposits in occasional cases. Focal noninflammatory intravascular coagulation is responsible for the microscopic and clinical skin lesions in these patients.\r"
