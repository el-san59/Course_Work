  ".W": "The reported incidence of aortic aneurysm after surgical repair or balloon angioplasty for aortic coarctation varies widely. To determine the incidence of aneurysm formation after surgery, preoperative and postoperative cineangiograms from 65 patients who underwent operation at age 1.5 +/- 3.4 years were examined. Repair included a prosthetic patch in 14 patients, end to end anastomosis in 28 and subclavian flap in 23. Aneurysm was documented by change in contour or irregularities in contour at the repair site or by abnormal dimensions at the repair site, defined by the ratio of the widest measurement at the repair site to the measurement of the aorta at the diaphragm. An aneurysmal bulge above the ductus diverticulum was identified in 14 (23%) of 60 patients preoperatively; the area showed no change 4.72 +/- 4.07 years after surgery. Significant changes at the repair site were seen in only three patients, all of whom had Dacron patch repair. One patient had a change in contour at the repair site, one had an abnormally high repair site to diaphragmatic aorta ratio and one had a progressive increase in this ratio. Thus, during childhood years, 3 (5%) of 65 patients were diagnosed as having aneurysm at the surgical repair site. In conclusion, 1) comparison with preoperative cineangiograms, especially for aneurysmal bulges above the ductus arteriosus, is essential before an aneurysm can be attributed to coarctation repair by any technique, and 2) aneurysm developed only in patients subjected to Dacron patch repair.\r"

  ".W": "Beta-adrenergic blockade represents a promising therapeutic approach to idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. Bucindolol, a new beta-blocker, showed favorable effects in a short-term (3 month) trial in idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. To assess long-term response, 20 study patients (7 of 9 patients previously assigned to the placebo group and 13 of 14 patients previously assigned to bucindolol therapy) received long-term bucindolol therapy and were followed up for a mean of 23 +/- 4 months (range 17 to 30). The mean patient age was 49 years (range 29 to 66) and the median duration of disease was 11 months (range 1 to 190). Ten patients were in functional class II and 10 were in class III; 15 patients were men. At the end of the common follow-up time, all 20 patients were alive, 17 continued to receive bucindolol (mean dose 176 mg/day, range 25 to 200), and 2 underwent cardiac transplantation. Left ventricular ejection fraction increased from a baseline value of 25 +/- 8% to 35 +/- 13% (n = 19 pairs, p less than 0.001). Functional class improved in 12, was unchanged in 5 and deteriorated in 3 (p = 0.056). Exercise time was maintained (9.4 +/- 3.1 versus 9.1 +/- 3.5 min, n = 19, p = NS), as was maximal oxygen uptake (19.2 +/- 4.9 versus 18.8 +/- 5.7 ml/kg per min, n = 19, p = NS). Thus, long-term bucindolol therapy leads to substantial increases in ejection fraction and to improved functional class while stable exercise performance is maintained.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "91201664\r", 
  ".W": "Although the mechanism is unknown, clinical trials have suggested that intravenous beta-adrenergic blockade may prevent early cardiac rupture after myocardial infarction. Previous studies have examined effects of beta-blockers on global left ventricular function after myocardial infarction; however, few data exist regarding their immediate effects on regional function or in patients after successful reperfusion. Therefore, 65 patients in whom thrombolysis with or without coronary angioplasty achieved reperfusion at 4.6 +/- 1.7 h from symptom onset were studied. Low osmolarity contrast ventriculograms were obtained immediately before and after administration of 15 mg of intravenous metoprolol (n = 54) or placebo (n = 11). Intravenous metoprolol immediately decreased heart rate (from 92 to 76 beats/min, p less than 0.0001), increased left ventricular diastolic volume (from 150 to 163 ml, p less than 0.001) and systolic volume (from 72 to 77 ml, p less than 0.0005) but did not change systolic and diastolic pressures. Although there was no difference in ejection fraction after metoprolol, centerline chord analysis revealed reduced noninfarct zone motion (from 0.41 to 0.12 SD/chord, p less than 0.05), improved infarct zone motion (from -3.1 to -2.9 SD/chord, p less than 0.01) and smaller circumferential extent of hypokinesia (from 30 to 27 chords, p less than 0.05). Patients with dyskinesia of the infarct zone had the most striking improvement in infarct zone wall motion. Because these changes occurred immediately after beta-blockade, they could not be attributed to myocardial salvage. No significant changes in heart rate, left ventricular volumes or regional wall motion were apparent in the control group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "To explore the effect of beta-adrenergic blockade on low heart rate-related (mental stress) ischemia, 19 patients with coronary artery disease were randomized into a double-blind crossover trial of metoprolol, 100 mg twice daily, and underwent serial mental stress/bicycle exercise studies. Mental stress-induced wall motion abnormalities occurred at a lower heart rate than exercise-induced wall motion abnormalities during placebo administration (81 +/- 16 vs. 123 +/- 20 beats/min, p less than 0.05). Metoprolol reduced the mean magnitude of exercise-induced wall motion abnormalities (2.8 +/- 2.0 vs. 1.6 +/- 2.4, p = 0.003); improvement was related to the magnitude of hemodynamic beta-blockade effect. Metoprolol did not significantly reduce the mean magnitude of mental stress-induced wall motion abnormalities (3.0 +/- 2.2 vs. 2.6 +/- 2.2), although individual responses predominantly either improved (50%) or worsened (29%). Unlike exercise, the magnitude of hemodynamic beta-blockade did not predict mental stress response and metoprolol did not block mental stress-induced blood pressure elevations. Patients with abolition of exercise-induced ischemia were more likely to have reduction of mental stress-induced ischemia. Patients whose ischemia worsened with metoprolol during mental stress had more easily inducible ischemia, as assessed by exercise-induced placebo wall motion abnormality, chest pain and prior myocardial infarction. Beta-blockade was associated with a lowering of ischemia-related hemodynamic thresholds compared with placebo. These results suggest that beta-blockade has a variable effect on low heart rate-related ischemia that may be due to a lack of effect on mental stress-induced blood pressure elevation in patients with easily induced ischemia or to effects on coronary vasomotor tone, or both.\r"

During the control drug-free state, all patients had inducible ventricular tachycardia, with a mean cycle length of 260 ms (range 190 to 400). During monotherapy with the IC agent the tachycardia remained inducible in each patient, but there was a significant increase in the cycle length to 340 ms (240 to 500) (p less than 0.001). The effective refractory period of the ventricle was not altered. Treatment with mexiletine (oral in 13 and intravenous in 1) was begun and electrophysiologic testing was repeated. Ventricular tachycardia in one patient was rendered noninducible and one patient had arrhythmia aggravation. The tachycardia in the remaining 12 patients remained inducible but its average cycle length increased further to 392 ms (340 to 460) (p = NS). Nine patients had rate slowing and the average cycle length of the ventricular tachycardia in this group was significantly increased (302 to 388 ms, p less than 0.05). The average effective refractory period was significantly increased during combination therapy (267 ms) compared with no drug therapy (235 ms) and therapy with the class IC drug alone (247 ms) (p less than 0.05). After a mean follow-up interval of 22 months, seven patients continue on the combined treatment and have no ventricular tachycardia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "91201667\r", 
  ".W": "The relation between anterograde blood flow through a coronary artery and the size of the perfusion bed it supplies is not known. Accordingly, the left circumflex coronary artery was cannulated and perfused with arterial blood in 12 open chest mongrel dogs. In Group I dogs (n = 7), the goal was to correlate the size of the perfusion bed with the magnitude of anterogradely derived myocardial blood flow. The size of the perfusion bed was measured with use of two-dimensional myocardial contrast echocardiography, whereas anterograde myocardial blood flow was determined by injecting radiolabeled microspheres directly into the artery. In Group II dogs (n = 5), the goal was to study the effects of altering coronary blood flow on both anterogradely and collateral vessel-derived myocardial flow within the perfusion bed. In these dogs, microspheres were injected directly into both the coronary artery and the left atrium at each flow rate. In Group I dogs, the left circumflex perfusion bed size, as defined by myocardial contrast echocardiography, decreased at lower anterograde myocardial blood flow rates. The change in perfusion bed size occurred at the lateral zones. There was a linear relation between the normalized perfusion bed size and the normalized anterograde myocardial blood flow: y = 0.45x + 54.2 (p less than 0.001, r2 = 0.77). These results were substantiated in Group II dogs, in which the size of the perfusion bed was approximated with use of radiolabeled microspheres. The size of the perfusion bed was most affected when anterograde myocardial blood flow decreased to less than approximately 33% of normal. At the lowest flow rates, there was a linear relation between anterograde blood flow versus the fraction of the left circumflex flow derived anterogradely: y = 2.41x + 0.22 (p less than 0.001, r2 = 0.90). The lower the level of anterograde flow, the greater was the blood flow derived from remote vessels. It is concluded that the size of the area perfused by a coronary artery is significantly influenced by the magnitude of anterograde blood flow through that artery. These findings may have important implications in experimental and clinical models of myocardial ischemia.\r"

  ".W": "To evaluate the feasibility of detecting denervated myocardium in the infarcted canine heart, the distribution of sympathetic nerve endings using I-123 metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) was compared with the distribution of perfusion using thallium-201, with the aid of color-coded computer functional map in 16 dogs. Twelve dogs underwent myocardial infarction by injection of vinyl latex into the left anterior descending coronary artery (transmural myocardial infarction, n = 6), or ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery (nontransmural myocardial infarction, n = 6). Four dogs served as sham-operated controls. Image patterns were compared with tissue norepinephrine content and with histofluorescence microscopic findings in biopsy specimens. Hearts with transmural infarction showed zones of absent MIBG and thallium, indicating scar. Adjacent and distal regions showed reduced MIBG but normal thallium uptake, indicating viable but denervated myocardium. Denervation distal to infarction was confirmed by reduced norepinephrine content and absence of nerve fluorescence. Nontransmural myocardial infarction showed zones of wall thinning with decreased thallium uptake and a greater reduction or absence of MIBG localized to the region of the infarct, with minimal extension of denervation beyond the infarct. Norepinephrine content was significantly reduced in the infarct zone, and nerve fluorescence was absent. These findings suggest that 1) MIBG imaging can detect viable and perfused but denervated myocardium after infarction; and 2) as opposed to the distal denervation produced by transmural infarction, nontransmural infarction may lead to regional ischemic damage of sympathetic nerves, but may spare subepicardial nerve trunks that course through the region of infarction to provide a source of innervation to distal areas of myocardium.\r"

However, to date no data are available concerning possible trauma of the transesophageal echocardiographic technique to the esophagus due to probe insertion, manipulation or direct ultrasound energy transmission. To test the hypothesis that transesophageal manipulations caused no traumatic or thermal injury to the esophageal mucosa, 12 animals were studied with continuous transesophageal echocardiography for a period of variable duration (mean 4.6 h +/- 51 min). The study group consisted of four monkeys (mean weight 5.7 +/- 0.6 kg and eight mongrel dogs (mean weight 29.8 +/- 1.4 kg). The eight dogs were studied during right heart bypass with full heparinization for 6.6 +/- 0.2 h, whereas the four monkeys were studied for 60 to 90 min in the absence of cardiopulmonary bypass and anticoagulation. Immediately after completion of transesophageal echocardiography in each case, the esophagus was entirely excised. Detailed macroscopic and microscopic examination of the esophagus revealed no significant mucosal or thermal injury. This preliminary animal study suggests that transesophageal echocardiography is safe for the esophageal mucosa in animals as small as 5 kg in weight, despite prolonged use and in the presence of systemic anticoagulation.\r"

All three patients who underwent emergency valve replacement survived. A fourth patient died 2 days after valvuloplasty without operative intervention. Fatal cardiac arrest complicated balloon aortic valvuloplasty in 13 patients (2.6%), including 7 with cardiogenic shock and 4 with refractory ventricular arrhythmias. Of the seven with shock, four had been treated with serial balloon inflations; dual balloons were used in three. In two of three patients studied at necropsy, the aortic valve was observed to be congenitally bicuspid.

  ".W": "Platelet-mediated obstruction of stenotic and endothelium-injured coronary arteries may be important in the abrupt progression from chronic stable to unstable coronary heart disease syndromes in patients. Transcardiac accumulation of thromboxane A2 and serotonin has been demonstrated in patients as chronic stable angina is converted to unstable angina. In this study in anesthetized open chest dogs with coronary artery stenosis and endothelial injury, thromboxane A2 and serotonin were shown to be important mediators of intermittent coronary obstruction caused by platelet aggregation and dynamic vasoconstriction. Furthermore, thromboxane A2 synthesis inhibitors and receptor antagonists and serotonin receptor antagonists, singly and together, provided substantial protection against repetitive platelet aggregation and dislodgment in canine models with coronary artery stenosis and endothelial injury even when systemic catecholamine concentrations were markedly elevated. These same observations apply in chronically instrumented, awake, unsedated dogs with coronary artery stenosis and endothelial injury in which recurrent platelet attachment and dislodgment cause cyclic flow alterations that may be prevented by thromboxane A2 synthesis inhibitors and receptor antagonists and serotonin receptor antagonists. Chronically instrumented dogs with coronary stenosis and endothelial injury in which recurrent platelet attachment and dislodgment occurred also developed neointimal proliferation of varying severity within 10 days to 3 weeks; the morphologic appearance of the neointimal proliferation was identical to that found in patients who develop restenosis after coronary angioplasty.\r"

Recent advances in the understanding of the biology of restenosis indicate that intimal hyperplasia of smooth muscle cells is the predominant cause for restenosis. Therefore, therapeutic agents that inhibit vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation should be candidate drugs to prevent restenosis. Heparin has documented antiproliferative effects on smooth muscle cells, and the availability of low molecular weight heparins that lack anticoagulant properties makes them ideal agents. Glucocorticoids have wide effects on inflammatory and wound healing events and inhibit smooth muscle cell growth in culture and in animal models of arterial injury. Recent laboratory data suggest that combination therapy with both low molecular weight heparin and hydrocortisone may be a powerful treatment regimen to limit restenosis.\r"

By preventing cell division after smooth muscle cell activation, antimitogenic therapy may inhibit the final common pathway in this complex chain of events and offset the apparent loss of local growth control. Colchicine, which causes metaphase arrest of cell division, has been shown in experimental studies to decrease the extent of atheromatous plaque formation and reduce the severity of arterial restenosis after balloon angioplasty. However, preliminary results from a randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial suggest that low dose colchicine (0.6 mg twice a day orally) does not prevent restenosis. The use of more potent antineoplastic agents is limited by the potential for life-threatening side effects. It is possible that these adverse effects can be averted by using novel drug delivery systems to administer antimitogenic therapy locally at the site of arterial injury or by using low dose synergistic combinations of antiproliferative agents. This review examines the potential role of antimitogenic therapy in the prevention of restenosis after coronary interventions and considers the possibility of an overlap of the therapeutic realms of interventional cardiology and medical oncology.\r"

  ".U": "91201683\r", 
  ".W": "Vascular smooth muscle cell hyperplasia is a major component of atherogenesis in various animal models. Angiopeptin, a cyclic octapeptide analogue of somatostatin, markedly inhibits myointimal proliferation in response to endothelial cell injury in the rat carotid artery, rabbit aorta and iliac arteries and in coronary arteries of transplanted rabbit hearts. Angiopeptin does not affect serum lipid profiles in nonhuman primates. It is unlikely, therefore, that its antiproliferative effect is mediated by alterations in cholesterol metabolism. Angiopeptin and other peptide analogues of somatostatin are potent inhibitors of growth hormone release and insulin-like growth factor-1 production. However, inhibition of smooth muscle cell proliferation in vivo is not a property common to all somatostatin analogues. This suggests that plasma growth hormone and growth hormone-dependent insulin-like growth factor-1 production are not physiologic stimuli for myointimal proliferation in vivo. Angiopeptin inhibits 3H-thymidine incorporation into rat carotid artery explants, suggesting a local effect on autocrine or paracrine mechanisms regulating cell growth. In view of its potent inhibitory effect on smooth muscle cell replication, angiopeptin may have clinical utility in preventing restenosis after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and in preventing accelerated coronary atherosclerosis after cardiac transplantation.\r"

  ".W": "Smooth muscle cell proliferation and formation of extracellular matrix are parts of the repair process after vascular injury. Similar processes occur after coronary angioplasty and, in approximately 33% of vessels, lead to intimal hyperplasia and vascular restenosis within 6 months after angioplasty. In a rat model of balloon catheterization, the proliferative response to balloon injury was reduced by 70% and the area of vascular wall covered by lesion formation was decreased by 45% in rats treated with the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor cilazapril. Other antihypertensive agents were much less active when tested for suppression of intimal hyperplasia after balloon injury: verapamil 0%, minoxidil 4% and hydralazine 34%. For cilazapril at the dose of 10 mg/kg per day, approximately 20% greater suppression of intimal hyperplasia was seen when the treatment was started 6 days before balloon injury. Treatment of rats from the time of balloon catheterization with both cilazapril (10 mg/kg per day) and heparin infusion (0.3 mg/kg per h) resulted in essentially complete (greater than 90%) inhibition of intimal hyperplasia. These data indicate that the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor cilazapril specifically inhibits the proliferative response to balloon injury and that heparin and cilazapril inhibit intimal hyperplasia through different mechanisms. The data also suggest that the use of pharmacologic combinations may have therapeutic usefulness to prevent late restenosis after coronary angioplasty.\r"

Symptomatic status and non-invasive evaluation have been used to study restenosis, but both lack specificity and sensitivity, particularly in patients with multivessel disease. Angiography remains the reference standard. Several arbitrary definitions have been used, some related to visual estimates of coronary stenosis and others to quantitative angiographic techniques. In another approach, linear modeling is used to assess minimal luminal diameter of lesions on restudy. Although angiographic studies have been essential in the study of restenosis, questions concerning the underlying mechanism and pathophysiology remain. The development of animal models that closely resemble human restenosis should allow evaluation of pathophysiologic mechanisms and development of new strategies to prevent the problem.\r"

Although stenting appears to be useful in treating abrupt closure after coronary angioplasty, its effectiveness in limiting the complex processes responsible for late restenosis is much less certain. Pathologic examination of stented human saphenous bypass grafts shows extensive deposits of platelets, fibrin and leukocytes along the stent wires within the 1st week and formation of a neointima of variable thickness after 3 months without evidence of foreign body reaction. The long-term effects of continuous barotrauma induced by the expanded stent remain unknown. It is difficult to assess the relative merits of the new devices, but stenting has several theoretic advantages. It seems less disruptive to the underlying architecture of the vessel wall and enjoys favorable theoretic and effective expansion ratios. Wide-spread clinical acceptance for stenting will depend on demonstrating that its safety, efficacy and cost efficiency are superior to those of balloon angioplasty.\r"

Patients with \"suboptimal\" angioplasty results (dis-section) who received a single stent seemed to have a higher thrombosis rate perioperatively (4 [4%] of 98), but no higher incidence of restenosis (7 [15%] of 46) than that of the total group of patients who received a single stent. Coronary stenting may be a valuable adjunct to coronary angioplasty in carefully selected patients. Complication rates are similar to those of routine angioplasty; however, angiographic restenosis may be reduced in certain subsets of patients.\r"

Discrimination of normal and atherosclerotic vessels by laser-excited fluorescence spectroscopy may offer a means of targeting plaque ablation, thereby reducing the frequency of restenosis and transmural perforation. In this study, with use of a 325 nm low power helium-cadmium laser, in vivo endogenous surface fluorescence was excited through a flexible 200 microns optical fiber within a 0.018 in. (0.046 cm) guide wire in contact with the intima of 268 vascular interrogation sites from 48 patients either during open heart surgery or during percutaneous catheterization procedures. Fluorescence spectra could be recorded in all patients in bloodless and blood-filled arteries. Endogenous surface fluorescence was analyzed measuring peak intensity, peak position and shape index of the spectra. Compared with normal wall, noncalcified and calcified coronary atheroma showed a 42% (p less than 0.001) and a 58% (p less than 0.001) decrease of peak intensity, and higher shape index (p less than 0.001 and p less than 0.01, respectively). In addition, peak position was shifted to longer wavelengths for noncalcified coronary atheroma (p less than 0.001). Compared with normal aorta sites, aortic plaques demonstrated a 46% decrease of peak intensity, longer peak position wavelengths (p less than 0.05) and a higher shape index (p less than 0.001). Using an atheroma detection algorithm, prospective analysis of aorta and coronary spectra showed a specificity of 100% for identifying normal sites and a sensitivity of 73% for recognizing atherosclerotic sites.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Using a xenon chloride (308 nm) excimer laser generator and 1.5 to 1.75 mm catheters, excimer laser angioplasty was attempted at 135 ns pulse width, 25 to 40 Hz repetition rate, 2 to 5 s laser delivery time and 30 to 60 mJ/mm2 energy fluence. Laser success (greater than 20% improvement in luminal diameter) was achieved in 138 (87%) of 158 lesions, with a reduction to less than 50% stenosis noted in 77 lesions (49%). Overall, laser-assisted balloon angioplasty success (less than 50% residual stenosis without major complication) was observed in 129 (91%) of 141 patients. Procedural complications (abrupt closure 1.3%, side branch occlusion 1.9%, intimal dissection 6.3%, embolization 1.3%, filling defect 1.3%, perforation 1.9% and spasm 1.3% and major complications (non-Q wave myocardial infarction 4.8%, emergency coronary bypass surgery 3.5% and death 0%) were infrequent and predominantly related to subsequent balloon angioplasty. In the early follow-up period (range 1 to 10 months, mean 7), 111 (79%) of the 141 patients remain asymptomatic, whereas symptoms have recurred in 27 (19%) and 3 patients (2.1%) have died. Thus, percutaneous coronary excimer laser angioplasty appears to be a feasible and safe procedure. Assessment of the impact of this technology on the acute complications of and restenosis rates after angioplasty awaits further follow-up analysis.\r"

The catheter used has a standard angioplasty balloon with a pattern of laser-produced holes, 25 microns in size, which generate streams of fluid under pressure. Studies of the routes by which marker substances enter diseased arterial tissue when infused by the perforated balloon after experimental angioplasty are described. A colored marker dye entered the new crevices and dissection planes created by the angioplasty, but did not extend greater than 2 cm either proximal or distal to the perfused segment. Horseradish peroxidase entered tissue not only from the lumen and adventitia as occurs with its infusion into normal tissue with the perforated balloon, but also extended from new crevices and dissection planes created by the angioplasty. Platelet aggregation, coagulation and cell proliferation, the likely causes of restenosis after angioplasty, originate in the sites of greatest tissue disruption and blood stasis. These postmortem studies suggest that active drugs are delivered to the arterial wall in a manner likely to be effective in preventing these events.\r"

A brief review of experimental evidence supports the hypothesis that the thrombogenicity of the injured arterial wall can be reduced by a suitable level of thermal denaturation or cross-linking of thrombogenic proteins. In addition, the concept of local pharmacologic therapy, which can be provided with laser balloon angioplasty at the site of arterial injury, is introduced. Preliminary in vitro and in vivo data suggest that guide catheter-injected albumin-heparin conjugates fabricated as water-insoluble microspheres remain adherent to the injured luminal surface and deeper arterial layers after physical trapping by the inflated balloon and subsequent laser/thermal exposure. The combination of initially adequate luminal morphology, reduction of the thrombogenicity of the injured arterial wall and application of local pharmacologic therapy with laser balloon angioplasty may eventually prove helpful in reducing the incidence of restenosis.\r"

  ".W": "Despite substantial basic and clinical efforts to address the problem of restenosis after percutaneous coronary intervention, effective preventive therapies have not yet been developed. Nevertheless, the accumulated information has provided much insight into the process of restenosis in addition to allowing standards to be developed for adequate clinical trials. The pathophysiology of restenosis increasingly appears to be distinct from that of primary atherosclerosis. Restenosis involves elastic recoil, incorporation of thrombus into the lesion and fibrocellular proliferation in varying degrees in different patients. Lack of an animal model that satisfactorily mimics restenosis is a major impediment to further understanding of the process. Clinical studies are hampered by difficulties in finding a single unifying definition of restenosis and by variable methods of reporting follow-up. Reporting of clinical outcomes of all patients in angiographic substudies would allow a more satisfactory interpretation of the results of clinical trials. Current noninvasive test results are not accurate enough to substitute for angiographic and clinical outcome data in intervention trials. In the majority of observational studies, only diabetes and unstable angina have emerged as consistently associated with restenosis; whereas most of the standard risk factors for atherosclerosis have a less consistent relation. Disappointingly, the new atherectomy and laser technologies have not affected restenosis rates. The one possible exception is coronary stenting, as a result of the larger luminal diameter achieved by the placement of the stent. In conclusion, although substantial continued effort is necessary to explore the basic aspects of cellular proliferation and mechanical alteration of atherosclerotic vessels, attention to the principles of clinical trials and observation are required to detect the impact of risk factors and interventions on the multifactorial problem of restenosis. Adequate sample sizes, collection of clinical and angiographic outcomes and factorial study designs hold promise for unraveling this important limitation of percutaneous intervention.\r"

  ".W": "The immediate result of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty is influenced by both plastic and elastic changes of the vessel wall. To evaluate the amount of elastic recoil after coronary balloon angioplasty, the minimal luminal cross-sectional area of the largest balloon used at highest inflation pressure was compared with the minimal luminal vessel cross-sectional area directly after final balloon deflation in 607 lesions (526 patients). Elastic recoil was defined as the difference between balloon cross-sectional area and minimal luminal cross-sectional area of the dilated coronary segment immediately after balloon withdrawal. A videodensitometric analysis technique was used to avoid geometric assumptions on stenosis morphology directly after angioplasty. Mean balloon cross-sectional area was 5.3 +/- 1.6 mm2 and minimal luminal cross-sectional area after angioplasty was 2.8 +/- 1.4 mm2. Reference areas before and after angioplasty did not differ (6.0 +/- 2.6 and 6.2 +/- 2.6 mm2, respectively). Univariate analysis revealed that asymmetric lesions, lesions located in less angulated parts of the artery and lesions with a low plaque content showed more elastic recoil. Lesions located in distal parts of the coronary tree were also associated with more elastic recoil probably related to relative balloon oversizing in these distal lesions.\r"

This review summarizes the potential applications of ultrasound imaging in the guidance of balloon angioplasty, atherectomy, laser ablation and stenting. Ultrasound differs from angiography and angioscopy in its ability to penetrate below the surface of the vessel lumen, demonstrating specific aspects about the distribution and composition of plaque. Because the different layers of the arterial wall have different acoustic properties, ultrasound catheters are able to define the layers of normal wall in comparison with plaque. Particularly in combination with therapeutic techniques designed to remove or ablate plaque, ultrasound may prove useful in maximizing the amount of plaque treated and minimizing trauma to normal vessel wall components. Combined imaging/therapeutic devices are in the pilot phase of development and show promise for enhancing the safety and efficacy of the catheter devices.\r"

  ".W": "Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioscopy with a flexible steerable microangioscope was performed in five patients undergoing repeat angioplasty. Recurrent lesions were assessed by angioscopy before and after the angioplasty procedure. The most common surface morphology observed in these restenosis lesions was that of white unpigmented lesions consistent with the proliferation of fibrous tissue. Also noted during angioscopy was the presence or absence of thrombus or dissection in association with the lesions either before or after angioplasty. Filmy wisps of tissue, presumably intimal flaps, were commonly visualized after angioplasty. There were no complications related to angioscopy or angioplasty in these patients. The surface morphology of restenosis lesions appears to be different from that of primary atherosclerotic lesions. The lesions in these five patients with restenosis were generally white and fibrotic in appearance, as opposed to the pigmented yellow to yellow-brown lesions commonly seen in undilated atherosclerotic lesions. It was also noted that the presence of intracoronary thrombus was strongly associated with the clinical syndrome of unstable angina. These findings support the hypothesis that restenosis lesions are the result of a reparative process consisting of smooth muscle cell proliferation and fibrosis.\r"

  ".U": "91201698\r", 
  ".W": "Provided collateralization is adequate, a chronic total coronary occlusion clinically imitates a 90% stenosis but is exempt from the risk of myocardial infarction. For angioplasty of vessels with chronic total coronary occlusion, technical difficulties and clinical risks are balanced against projected subjective benefit and amount of viable myocardium concerned. The primary success rate is approximately 65% and complications are rare because abrupt vessel reclosure may be common but is harmless. New Q wave infarction in that context has not been reported. The duration of occlusion is the most important predictor of success. The length of the occluded segment is also important. Recurrence averages 68% (21% reocclusion and 47% restenosis) and happens typically within 6 months. The high recurrence rate is due to competitive pressure exerted by collateral vessels and an often suboptimal local result. Even if the primary success rate of angioplasty in vessels with chronic total coronary occlusion can be improved by advanced technology and skill, the clinical yield will remain low compared with that of angioplasty of stenoses. Because low yield procedures must be low risk and low cost, there are definite limits to how sophisticated, risky and expensive new techniques can become. Derivatives of conventional balloon systems are likely to remain the equipment of first choice, perhaps complemented by mechanical drills. Although chronic total coronary occlusions are no clinical menace in contrast to stenoses, they frequently deserve revascularization and are the reason to select bypass surgery over angioplasty. These factors justify endeavors to improve recanalization techniques that help to refine coronary angioplasty of nontotal lesions, because total occlusion, albeit a different animal, is of the same species.\r"

Clinical evidence of restenosis occurred in 14 patients (70%), including 6 patients with sudden coronary death. Of the 20 patients, 14 (70%) had a cardiac cause of death and 6 (30%) had a noncardiac cause of death. Two major subgroups of histologic findings were observed: 1) intimal proliferation (60%), and 2) atherosclerotic plaque only (40%). Of the eight sites with atherosclerotic plaque only, six were eccentric lesions and two were concentric lesions. No morphologic evidence of previous angioplasty injury (cracks, breaks, tears) was observed in the eight patients with atherosclerotic plaque only. Proposed mechanisms for the development of intimal proliferation involve the reaction of smooth muscle cells and platelets, whereas elastic recoil of overstretched eccentric or concentric atherosclerotic lesions represents the most likely explanation for the findings in the latter subgroup. On the basis of these morphologic findings at angioplasty restenosis sites, specific treatment strategies for restenosis after coronary artery balloon angioplasty are proposed.\r"

Prominent among these endothelial roles is the production of a potent vasodilator or family of vasodilators termed the endothelium-derived relaxing factor, one of which has been identified to be nitric oxide or a closely related compound. Several diseases that commonly occur in patients undergoing coronary angioplasty alter many facets of endothelial function and may predispose to adverse clinical sequelae of angioplasty, including immediate thrombosis, restenosis and vascular spasm. Several features of the endothelium-derived relaxing factor, how it is altered by pathologic processes and how these considerations relate to the immediate and late postangioplasty periods are discussed.\r"

  ".W": "Coronary angioplasty has become a successful and widely used treatment for patients with coronary artery disease since its first clinical application in 1977. The primary success rate has improved despite the increase in procedure and case complexity. However, acute reocclusion and late restenosis, which constitute the most important problems after successful angioplasty, continue to occur in about 5% and 35% of patients within 3 to 6 months, respectively. Angioscopic and pathologic observations have suggested that a multifactorial pathophysiologic process accounts for acute reocclusion, involving marked thrombosis, intimal dissection, medial and subintimal hemorrhage, vascular recoil and vasocontriction. In contrast, chronic restenosis involves the development of fibrocellular intimal hyperplasia within a milieu created by vascular injury, platelet activation, thrombin generation and the release of mitogens. Although current pharmacologic approaches, which involve antithrombotic and anticoagulant therapy, have been largely ineffective in eliminating acute reocclusion and chronic restenosis, recent advances in the research in thrombosis, platelet receptors and smooth muscle growth regulation have allowed new therapeutic options to be tested in the experimental setting, with subsequent potential clinical applications in patients.\r"

Monoclonal antibodies and snake venom-derived or synthetic peptides directed against a common protein recognition sequence on the platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor are currently in the early stages of preclinical and clinical testing and hold promise of preventing abrupt closure and restenosis by inhibiting platelet function. Whether any of these agents will eventually be commonly used in clinical practice will depend on their effects on the complex pathophysiology of these problems and on their safety profile when administered to patients who are likely to receive other antithrombotic medications and who are instrumented for coronary angioplasty.\r"

The purpose of this study was to evaluate long-term effectiveness and to identify predictors of success of an intensive multidisciplinary program utilizing the time-calorie displacement diet, a low-fat, high-complex-carbohydrate diet, to promote and maintain reduced body weight. In 213 obese adults consecutively entering the program, including dropouts, weight loss averaged 6.3 kg (0.4 kg/week) and 16% of excess weight over 7 months of treatment. The 78 (37%) completing the recommended 15 visits lost a mean of 10.8 kg and 28% of their excess weight while under treatment. Weight loss was largely predicted by number of visits, which was more important than treatment duration. An increased number of visits was predicted by being married, being female, and reporting a usual diet low in snack foods. Of 147 patients contacted at posttreatment follow-up, 53% maintained their weight loss or continued to lose weight an average of 25 months later and 24% experienced weight rebound but were still below their pretreatment weight; only 23% regained their lost weight. Mean net weight loss from pretreatment to follow-up was 8.0 +/- 1.0 kg (mean +/- standard error of the mean). No factor significantly predicted posttreatment weight rebound. Results suggest that a nutritionally sound diet, prescribed in a multidisciplinary program and emphasizing life-style changes, can result in long-term weight control in a majority of patients treated.\r"

The purpose of this study was to investigate body composition, body fat distribution, and resting metabolic rate in obese men and women and to compare bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) with hydrodensitometry before and after 12 weeks of treatment in a VLCD program. Body composition was assessed by hydrodensitometry and BIA. Circumference measures were used to determine waist:hip and waist:thigh ratios. Seventeen subjects lost a mean of 24.2 kg. A mean of 75.5% of the weight loss was adipose tissue as measured by hydrodensitometry. BIA underestimated body fat percentage compared with hydrodensitometry in this obese population. Waist:hip and waist:thigh ratios showed a small but significant decrease, implying a decreased risk for diabetes and cardiovascular disease after weight loss. Resting metabolic rate, as measured by oxygen consumption, dropped 23.8% during the 12 weeks of the VLCD. The findings indicate that a VLCD can provide a rapid weight loss of more than 75% fat and a concomitant decrease in waist:hip and waist:thigh ratios. The findings also indicate that BIA may not be a useful tool in assessing fat loss in obese subjects. Finally, it appears that the decrease in resting metabolic rate that occurs during treatment with VLCD does not correlate with changes in lean body mass.\r"

The practitioners were chosen because they likely served pregnant women and/or women with young children. Items for the belief inventory were generated by surveying the beliefs of pregnant and nonpregnant adolescents and their families, teachers, and peers as well as by collecting beliefs heard from clients of social workers, nurses, and dietitians residing in the state of Tennessee. Using a modified q-sort, 26 statements were developed to survey dietitians practicing nationwide. Results indicate that beliefs about physiological needs during pregnancy, practices related to a healthy baby, and beverage recommendations were not significantly different across the regions designated by US Public Health Services (Standard Federal Administrative Regions). However, beliefs about cravings and folklore showed strong regional differences, with the Southeast regions and adjacent states differing significantly from other regions. The majority of beliefs are not supported by scientific information, and results support the need for each region to identify beliefs that could influence dietary patterns (eg, eating for two, eating only a few selected foods, restricting salt, taking vitamins to overcome an inadequate diet, and deciding pregnancy is a good time to lose weight). We recommend that dietetic practitioners become aware of clients' beliefs, support beliefs that are accurate according to current recommendations for pregnancy, and counsel clients about beliefs that are potentially detrimental to good nutrition during pregnancy.\r"

In general, no consistent relationship was found between method of infant feeding and postpartum weight loss. However, in the ADC group at 6 weeks and in the non-ADC group at 12 months, nonlactating women had lost more weight than had their lactating counterparts, in spite of the theoretical energy deficiency of breast-feeding women. Women who gained more weight during pregnancy consistently lost more weight following delivery, regardless of their prepregnancy weight. These results indicate that infant feeding method was not related to differences in postpartum weight loss between lactating and nonlactating counterparts.\r"

Mean serum total cholesterol (3.4 mmol/L), low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol (1.8 mmol/L), and triglyceride (0.8 mmol/L) levels were lower than expected values derived from the Lipid Research Clinics Population Studies prevalence data. Mean high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol (1.3 mmol/L) was comparable to expected values. Analysis of quantitative food frequency data showed that vegans had a significantly lower daily intake of total energy, percentage of energy from fat (31% vs 38%), total fat, saturated fat, monounsaturated fatty acids, cholesterol, and protein and a significantly higher intake of fiber than a sample of matched omnivore controls. Vegans' food intake was also compared with expected values, matched for sex and age, derived from the second National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and Continuing Survey of Food Intakes by Individuals 24-hour recall data. The vegan diet was characterized by increased consumption of almonds, cashews, and their nut butters; dried fruits; citrus fruits; soy milk; and greens. We conclude from the present study that a strict vegan diet, which is typically very low in saturated fat and dietary cholesterol and high in fiber, can help children and adults maintain or achieve desirable blood lipid levels.\r"

Seventy (35%) responded. Most R & D directors did not think they were responsible for improving the health of their consumers. A positive relationship existed between attitudes toward nutrition and nutrition marketing practices (P = .013). Forty-four reported that they marketed nutrition and planned to add nutritious menu items in the future. Forty-six reported that nutritious meal options represented 0 to 10% of total sales. Nutrition information was provided to consumers by 27 restaurant companies but such information often had to be requested. The American Heart Association was a popular source of nutrition and menu-planning information. Twelve companies employed a registered dietitian, and 14 used registered dietitians as consultants. Nutrition-related training for restaurant employees was limited. These findings indicate that dietitians have opportunities to market their skills in developing nutritious menu items and providing staff training. Also, dietitians should encourage consumers (especially those with special dietary needs) to let restaurant managers know their menu and nutrition information needs.\r"

Biochemical mechanisms that may contribute to alcohol craving include the stress response of the hypothalamic-pituitary adrenal axis, the endogenous opiate beta-endorphin system, neurotransmitter synthesis and release, hypoglycemia, and nutrient deficiencies. The macronutrient ratio of meals, the resulting insulin response, and nutrient blood levels can affect amino acid and nutrient transport across the blood-brain barrier. Researchers have reported that animals increase alcohol intake when fed nutrient-deficient diets or after stressful experience. A pilot study was designed to assess the effects of nutrition therapy added to a traditional rehabilitation program based on the 12-step program of Alcoholics Anonymous. One study group received traditional therapy; the other study group received traditional therapy and nutrition therapy consisting of modified menus and individualized nutrition counseling. Patients who received nutrition therapy reported significantly fewer hypoglycemic symptoms, lower sugar intake, less alcohol craving as well as significantly greater nutrient intakes; a greater number abstained from alcohol. These findings indicate that nutrition therapy can aid in the recovery from alcoholism.\r"

  ".W": "There is controversy regarding the ability of short term (2 to 3 days) cultured epidermal Langerhans cells (cLC) to process and present intact protein Ag to primed T cells. Some studies have shown that cLC are potent APC for both haptens and intact protein Ag, whereas in others cLC have been unable to process and present intact protein Ag. In an attempt to resolve this controversy, we tested the ability of Langerhans cells from several strains of mice to process and present intact protein Ag to T cell clones and T cell hybridomas. We found that both cLC and freshly prepared Langerhans cells from various Iak mice, including BALB.k mice, process and present intact protein antigens (i.e., hen egg lysozyme, cytochrome c, and OVA) to T cells. These functions are retained in cLC cultured for 7 days. In contrast, cLC from Iad mice do not process intact protein Ag, such as hen egg lysozyme and myoglobin, although they can present relevant peptides to specific T cells and are potent stimulators of allogeneic responses. Furthermore, cLC from (Iak x Iad)F1 mice process and present intact protein Ag to Iak-restricted T cells, but not to Iad-restricted T cells. Although cLC that processed and presented intact protein Ag to T cells exhibited enhanced class II MHC expression, they were, on a per cell basis, somewhat less efficient than were fresh Langerhans cells. Finally, we found that if Iad Langerhans cells are pulsed with intact protein Ag and then cultured for 3 days, they are then fully capable of inducing Ag- and MHC-specific T cell proliferation.\r"

  ".W": "CD27 belongs to a newly defined family of transmembrane R, including the nerve growth factor R, two distinct TNF R and CD40. The function of CD27 is unknown, but on the basis of structural and functional properties, we postulate that it plays a role in the events subsequent to T cell activation, possibly as a cytokine R. We have analyzed the mechanisms underlying the regulation of CD27 protein expression. Membrane expression of CD27 strongly increases after T cell activation via the TCR/CD3 complex or the CD2 molecule. In contrast, direct stimulation of protein kinase C by phorbol esters markedly down-regulates CD27 surface expression. This down-regulation most likely does not result from CD27 phosphorylation, because both anti-CD3 mAb and PMA induce hyperphosphorylation of CD27 on serine residues. Rather, membrane expression seems to be regulated primarily at the RNA level. Stimulation of T cells with anti-CD3 mAb strongly increases steady state CD27 mRNA levels, whereas PMA treatment greatly reduces these transcript levels. Dissection of the TCR/CD3-induced signaling pathways showed that cytoplasmic cAMP as well as Ca2+ concentrations contribute to the increase of CD27 expression. These data indicate that upon Ag-specific T cell stimulation, membrane expression of CD27 is regulated at the RNA level through the joint action of distinct TCR/CD3-associated signaling pathways.\r"

  ".W": "To investigate the requirements for CD2 expression in the activation of T lymphocytes via the CD3-TCR complex, we produced and characterized a series of CD2-variants of the IL-2 producing Jurkat leukemia cell line, J32 (surface phenotype, CD2+, CD3+, CD28+). These mutants were derived by radiation and immunoselection, and were cloned under limiting dilution conditions. A total of 3 out of 30 of these mutants selectively lost the expression of both CD2 surface molecules and CD2 mRNA, and retained the expression of the CD3-TCR complex and the CD28 molecule. A mitogenic combination of anti-CD2 antibodies (9.6 + 9-1) failed to stimulate activation of these variants as measured by mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ and by IL-2 production. The CD2- mutants stimulated with anti-CD3 or anti-TCR mAb revealed an 8- to 32-fold decrease in IL-2 production and IL-2 mRNA accumulation as compared with the parental cells. No alteration of CD3-TCR-induced mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ was observed in the CD2- mutants. Reconstitution of CD2 expression by gene transfer in two J32 CD2- mutants restored IL-2 production and IL-2 mRNA accumulation in responses to both anti-CD2 and anti-CD3-TCR mAb. These results are the first direct demonstration of the requirement for CD2 molecules in optimizing IL-2 response in human T cells stimulated via CD3-TCR complex.\r"

  ".W": "Coculture of resting human B cells with T cells stimulated with immobilized mAb to the CD3 molecular complex induces polyclonal activation and the production of Ig of all isotypes. The current experiments were carried out to determine the nature of the signals provided to B cells by the anti-CD3-activated T cells. For these experiments, fresh T cells or T cell clones were activated with immobilized mAb to CD3 and then fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde. Upon coculture, the fixed activated T cells or T cell clones induced B cell RNA synthesis and IL-2R expression, but only minimal DNA synthesis and no Ig production. Induction of B cell RNA synthesis by fixed activated T cells was not inhibited by mAb to the alpha-chain of the IL-2R, and was not enhanced by supplementing cultures with IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, or supernatants of mitogen-activated T cells. Upon the addition of IL-2, but not IL-4 or IL-6, to cultures of B cells and fixed activated T cells, sustained proliferation was noted along with the production of Ig. Control fixed T cells or T cell clones did not induce any of these responses. The presence of cycloheximide or cyclosporin A during the activation with anti-CD3 prevented T cells from developing the capacity to provide help for B cells. The use of mAb to a variety of cell surface molecules indicated that several T cell surface molecules including CD11a/CD18, CD44, CD54, and class I MHC molecules are involved in the induction of B cell responses. Among the mAb that inhibited B cell DNA synthesis and/or Ig production, only mAb to CD11a, CD18, or CD54 inhibited initial B cell activation as assessed by RNA synthesis. Even though mAB to CD11a/CD18 inhibited the capacity of fixed activated T cells to induce B cell responses, the finding that fixed activated CD18 deficit clones provided help for B cells indicated that expression of the beta 2 family of integrins by T cells was not necessary. These results indicate that activated T cells acquire the capacity to stimulate B cells polyclonally and induce cytokine responsiveness, proliferation, and Ig production by utilization of a variety of surface molecules. Moreover, these results indicate that the initial activation of the B cell is independent of the metabolic activity of the T cell and the production of cytokines.\r"

In the present report, HLA class II alleles of healthy donors were determined by serology and DNA typing to identify the HLA alleles controlling low or high immune responses to SCW. HLA-DR2-DQA1*0102-DQB1*0602(DQw6)-Dw2 haplotype or HLA-DR2-DQA1*0103-DQB1*0601(DQw6)-DW12 haplotype was increased in frequency in the low responders and the frequency of HLA-DR4-DRw53-DQA1*0301-DQB1*0401(DQw4)-Dw15 haplotype or HLA-DR9-DRw53-DQA1*0301-DQB1*0303(DQw3)-Dw23 haplotype was increased in the high responders to SCW. Homozygotes of either DQA1*0102 or DQA1*0103 exhibited a low responsiveness to SCW and those of DQA1*0301 were high responders. The heterozygotes of DQA1*0102 or 0103 and DQA1*0301 showed a low response to SCW, thereby confirming that the HLA-linked gene controls the low response to SCW, as a dominant trait. Using mouse L cell transfectants expressing a single class II molecule as the APC, we found that DQw6(DQA1*0103 DQB1*0601) from the low responder haplotype (DR2-DQA1*0103-DQB1*0601(DQw6)-Dw12) activated SCW-specific T cell lines whereas DQw4(DQA1*0301 DQB1*0401) from the high responder haplotype (DR4-DRw53-DQA1*0301-DQB1*0401(DQw4)-Dw15) did not activate T cell lines specific to SCW. However, DR4 and DR2 presented SCW to CD4+ T cells in both the high and low responders to SCW, hence the DR molecule even from the low responder haplotype functions as an restriction molecule in the low responders. Putative mechanisms linked to the association between the existence of DQ-restricted CD4+ T cells specific to SCW, and low responsiveness to SCW are discussed.\r"

Wild type and recombinant type III IgG Fc binding proteins induce a wide spectrum of proliferative responses ranging from non-mitogenic to potent responses. To understand the reason for these differences, three recombinant forms of a type III IgG Fc binding protein derived from a single human group C streptococcal strain, 26RP66, were generated. Form I bound human IgG and human serum albumin, form II bound IgG alone and form III bound human serum albumin alone. These functionally distinct forms were compared with the corresponding wild type preparation from the same strain for mitogenic potential. A mitogenic response was induced only with the form I recombinant or the native wild type protein. These proteins shared the functional characteristics of binding human serum albumin and IgG. Mixtures of the IgG binding (form II) and human serum albumin binding fragments (form III) failed to reconstitute the mitogenic potential of the full length proteins. These results demonstrate that the type III IgG Fc binding protein has mitogenic potential for human PBL that is not related to its ability to react with human serum albumin or IgG.\r"

Because susceptibility/resistance to demyelination in B10 congeneic mice maps strongly to class I MHC genes (D region) we tested whether expression of a human class I MHC gene (HLA-B27) would alter susceptibility to Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus-induced demyelination. Transgenic HLA-B27 mice were found to co-express human and endogenous mouse class I MHC genes by flow microfluorimetry analysis of PBL. In the absence of the human transgene, H-2stf, or v mice but not H-2b mice had chronic demyelination and persistence of virus at 45 days after infection. No difference in degree of demyelination, meningeal inflammation, or virus persistence was seen between transgenic HLA-B27 and nontransgenic littermate mice of H-2f or H-2v haplotype. In contrast, H-2s (HLA-B27+) mice showed a dramatic decrease in extent of demyelination and number of virus-Ag+ cells in the spinal cord compared with H-2s (HLA-B27-) littermate mice. In addition, none of the eight H-2s mice homozygous for HLA-B27 gene had spinal cord lesions even though infectious virus was isolated chronically from their central nervous system. Expression of HLA-B27 transgene did not interfere with the resistance to demyelination normally observed in B10 (H-2b) mice. These experiments demonstrate that expression of a human class I MHC gene can modulate a virus-induced demyelinating disease process in the mouse.\r"

Although in vivo activation of donor T cells in response to F1 alloantigens is thought to be critical to GVHD induction, direct evidence of activated donor T cells has been lacking in this model. In the present study, spleen cells from acute or chronic GVHD mice were studied for evidence of T cell activation at multiple intervals early after GVHD induction. Spleen cells from both acute and chronic GVHD mice exhibited striking elevations in spontaneous proliferation and IL-2 production, which were maximal 24 to 48 h after GVHD induction. Persistent lower levels of spontaneous in vitro activity were observed for spleen cells from mice tested 7 to 9 days after GVHD induction. In both forms of GVHD, increased spontaneous proliferation and IL-2 production were dependent on the presence of donor CD4+ T cells. These results strongly support the presence of activated donor T cells in vivo. Furthermore, these data imply that despite the significant differences in outcome, acute and chronic GVHD share a common early event.\r"

  ".U": "91201808\r", 
  ".W": "The anterior chamber of the eye is an immunologically privileged site. Recent evidence indicates that this privilege is an actively acquired immune state in which a unique form of systemic immune deviation exists, anterior chamber-associated immune deviation (ACAID). ACAID is characterized in part by the generation of Ag-specific splenic T lymphocytes that mediate suppression of induction and expression of delayed hypersensitivity and that suppress production of C-fixing antibodies. Delayed hypersensitivity and C fixation are usually associated with extensive nonspecific inflammation and innocent bystander tissue injury. It is, therefore, believed that ACAID represents physiologic adaptations of the immune system that mitigate wanton destruction of the anatomically delicate visual axis, thereby preserving sight, while at the same time providing selective immune protection. As a means of examining the potential contribution of the eye to ACAID induction, we have studied the immune properties of blood harvested from mice that had received BSA into the anterior chamber 48 h earlier. We found that an Ag-specific \"signal\" is present in the blood of these mice; when blood was transfused into naive syngeneic mice, regulatory cell populations were induced and the recipients were unable to display BSA-specific delayed hypersensitivity. Further analysis of this signal revealed it to be associated with the leukocyte fraction, but not with either the plasma or RBC components of whole blood. Among leukocytes, the suppression-inducing activity correlated positively with cells bearing the mature macrophage marker F4/80 and negatively with cells bearing Thy-1, surface Ig, and class II MHC molecules. These findings are discussed with regard to the potential intraocular sources of the ACAID-inducing signal and the possible mode of action of this factor.\r"

A single IL-1 injection also completely protected mice against a lethal dose of mTNF in the absence of GalN sensitization. The desensitization by IL-1 cannot be explained by a faster clearance of the challenge TNF. In addition, we demonstrate that the IL-1-induced desensitization was only observed when a functioning liver was present, that IL-1-pretreated animals did not show decreased numbers of hepatocyte TNF receptors, and that the amount of TNF-induced IL-6 was not reduced.\r"

Both naive (CD4+CD45RA+) and memory (CD4+CD45RO+) subsets of T cells were shown to produce similar amounts of IL-6 and TNF-alpha. In contrast the production of IL-1 alpha was found to be completely restricted to the CD4+CD45RO+ subset.

To study the relationship of peptide structure and immunogenicity in mice, we have prepared a series of melittin analogs varied in length and composition at the C-terminus. Immunogenicity of the analogs for IgG and IgE responses was found to correlate with two factors: a peptide length of more than 24 residues and the presence of a hydrophilic C-terminal region preferably with two to four cationic groups.

The [3H]LTB4-APA bound to plasma membrane-enriched preparations from PMNL was covalently cross-linked to membrane proteins with disuccinimidyl suberate. Solubilization and resolution by SDS-PAGE of proteins from [3H]LTB4-APA-labeled PMNL membranes revealed predominant labeling of a 60-kDa protein. Labeling of the PMNL membrane protein was inhibited by LTB4 and its analogs at concentrations similar to those inhibiting the binding of [3H]LTB4 to its receptor, with an identical rank order of potency of LTB4 greater than 20-hydroxy-LTB4 greater than LTB4-APA = 5(S),12(R)-dihydroxy-eicosa-14-cis-6,8,10-trans-tetraenoic acid much greater than LTD4 = LTC4. GTP suppressed the labeling of the 60-kDa PMNL membrane protein to an extent consistent with the decrease in receptor affinity for LTB4 induced by GTP. The stereospecificity of the affinity cross-linking reaction and the regulation by GTP support the identification of an approximately 60-kDa protein as the binding component of the PMNL receptor for LTB4.\r"

  ".W": "High titer autoantibodies to the Ku Ag, a DNA-protein complex containing 70- and approximately 80-kDa protein subunits (p70 and p80, respectively), are found in sera of certain patients with systemic lupus erythematosus and related disorders. Autoepitopes of the Ku Ag were identified and partially characterized by expressing fragments of the p70 and p80 cDNA as fusion proteins in bacteria. Systemic lupus erythematosus sera reacted on immunoblots with at least three epitopes of p70 (amino acids 560-609, 506-535, and 115-467), and three epitopes of p80 (amino acids 682-732, 558-681, and 1-374). These six antigenic regions had distinct amino acid sequences, and were also immunologically distinct, as determined by using immunoaffinity-purified auto-antibodies to particular epitopes. Detailed mapping of the strongly antigenic region near the C terminus of p70 revealed a complex conformational or discontinuous epitope, the antigenicity of which was abolished by deleting either amino acids 560-571 or 601-609. The C terminus of p80 may also contain a discontinuous or conformational epitope(s). Although only some sera reacted with p70 or p80 on immunoblots, all sera that immunoprecipitated the native Ku complex reacted with native Ku by ELISA, and inhibited the binding of mAb directed at epitopes of native Ku. Taken together, these studies indicate that anti-Ku autoantibodies target a diversity of independent epitopes located on p70, p80, and the intact Ku complex, and that a significant portion of the autoantibodies in most patients' sera is directed against conformational/discontinuous epitopes.\r"

  ".W": "We have previously biochemically characterized three separate sites on the fibronectin (Fn) molecule that interact with IgG. These studies have been extended to examine the interaction of Fn with other classes and subclasses of Ig. By ELISA, a preferential quantitative binding order of Fn to the major Ig classes and subclasses was obtained as follows: IgG greater than IgM greater than IgA, IgG1 greater than IgG3 = IgG4 greater than IgG2, and IgA1 = IgA2. Using fragments of Fn obtained by subtilisin digestion followed by IgM and IgA affinity chromatography, immunoblot analysis using monospecific antisera to separate regions of the Fn molecule, and amino acid sequence analysis, these studies indicate that polyclonal IgA and IgM interact with Fn in the same three regions and under the same ionic conditions as previously described for IgG. Site 1 is a 22-kDa fragment that commences at residue 1 of the Fn molecule. Sites 2 (16 kDa) and 3 (26-29 kDa) begin at residues 588 and 1597, respectively. Under physiological conditions a monoclonal antibody that recognizes site 1 completely inhibited the interaction of intact Fn with IgG, IgM, and IgA. Therefore, this is the only physiologically active site in the intact molecule. Aggregated but not monomeric IgG competitively inhibited the binding of Fn to IgG-coated microtiter ELISA plates; thus, this interaction can take place in a fluid-phase system. These results indicate that Fn can potentially interact with immune complexes and aggregates of all Ig in the circulation and thus may play a significant role in both their clearance and deposition in Fn-containing tissues, such as occurs in immune-complex-related disorders.\r"

To explore mechanisms involved in this increased phagocytosis, we adhered cultured human monocytes to surfaces pre-coated with CR1 ligand or control proteins and quantitated ingestion of sheep E opsonized with IgG alone. Three ligands for CR1 resulted in markedly enhanced phagocytosis of targets when compared individually to a panel of non-ligands, as determined by both the proportion of monocytes ingesting targets (percent phagocytosis) and by the number of targets ingested per 100 monocytes (phagocytic index). The ligands included purified C3b, iC3, and Fab fragments of 1B4, a monoclonal anti-CR1, which resulted in a percent phagocytosis of 56.3 (p less than 0.01), 59.0 (p less than 0.01), and 54.4 (p less than 0.02) and a phagocytic index of 281.2 (p less than 0.01), 281.1 (p less than 0.01), and 247.1 (p less than 0.02), respectively. Control proteins including human serum albumin, hemoglobin, Fab fragments of anti-fibronectin, anti-beta 2 microglobulin, and MOPC 21, and Fc fragments of 1B4 and MOPC 21 produced no significant stimulation of phagocytosis, nor did F(ab')2 fragments of monoclonal anti-CR3, M1/70. CR1-specific augmentation of target ingestion was apparent with monocytes cultured in serum-free medium for 1 to 7 days, but was not seen with freshly elutriated cells. Phagocytosis of unopsonized or IgM-coated targets was minimal. These results suggest that the adherent monocytes are primed by CR1 cross-linking for enhanced FcR-mediated phagocytosis even when the CR1 ligand is not present on the targets. This contrasts with the behavior of CR3, and demonstrated functional divergence between these C3 fragment receptors in the phagocytic process.\r"

  ".W": "In order to investigate 5-lipoxygenase enzyme regulation in neutrophils during an inflammatory reaction, we studied 5-lipoxygenase mRNA levels, as well as de novo enzyme synthesis, in resting and activated neutrophils isolated from normal individuals and patients with rheumatoid arthritis. The approach used was to analyze these activities in resting peripheral blood neutrophils of normal individuals on the one hand and in peripheral blood and matched synovial fluid neutrophils isolated from patients with rheumatoid arthritis on the other hand. Our first observation was that resting peripheral blood neutrophils of either normal individuals or patients show detectable levels of 5-lipoxygenase mRNA and are able to synthesize the enzyme de novo. Our second observation was that inflammatory activated neutrophils from synovial fluid reveal lower 5-lipoxygenase mRNA levels and enzyme synthesis than do the patient-matched peripheral blood cells. This is in spite of the fact that, for other proteins, synovial fluid neutrophils are equally or more active than their peripheral blood counterparts. We conclude that peripheral blood neutrophils are capable of synthesizing the enzyme, thus ensuring the turnover of the protein. Furthermore, complex regulatory mechanisms appear to take place in response to inflammation as it occurs in synovial fluids of patients with rheumatoid arthritis, leading to decreased mRNA levels and enzyme synthesis. Possible mechanisms of regulation are discussed and are presently under investigation.\r"

  ".W": "Extracellular ATP in concentrations of 0.5 to 2.5 mM modulates TNF-induced cytolysis of L929 cells in the presence of actinomycin D. When present throughout the entire assay period, it inhibits the TNF-induced cytolysis. ADP was less active whereas AMP and GTP were nonreactive. However, inhibition was also achieved by adenosine that was nearly as active as ATP. Yet, the inhibitory effect of ATP was not due to hydrolysis by ectoenzymes to form adenosine. Thus, the nonhydrolyzable ATP analogue adenyl(beta-gamma-methylendiphosphate) was equally effective in inhibiting TNF-induced cytolysis. Moreover, no conversion of ATP into adenosine was observed during the entire assay period. However, inhibition no longer occurred when the TNF and ATP containing medium was removed after 5 h and replaced by a fresh medium containing TNF and no ATP. We now observed substantial enhancement of the TNF-induced cytolysis by ATP. Finally, treatment with N6-(R-phenylisopropyl)adenosine or with aminophylline, which are thought to downregulate adenosine receptors and to prevent binding of ligands to adenosine receptors, respectively, abolishes adenosine and ATP-mediated inhibition. Again, substantial enhancement of the TNF-induced cytolysis was observed by ATP and only a minor effect by adenosine. The results together suggest that ATP interacts with purinoceptors on the plasma membrane and is capable to enhance and inhibit TNF-induced cytolysis under appropriate conditions. The outcome of the ATP-induced modulation may be influenced by adenosine receptors.\r"

  ".W": "We have investigated the effects of cAMP on Ig-induced human eosinophil activation. Stimulation of human normodense eosinophils with IgG- or secretory IgA (sIgA)-coated Sepharose beads induced cellular degranulation, as measured by the release of the granule protein, eosinophil-derived neurotoxin (EDN). Pretreatment with cAMP analogs (N6,O2,-dibutyryl adenosine-3,':5' cyclic monophosphate; 8-bromoadenosine 3':5' cyclic monophosphate; or N6-benzoyladenosine 3':5' cyclic monophosphate) or cAMP phosphodiesterase-inhibitors (theophylline or isobutylmethyl xanthine (IBMX] strongly inhibited Ig-induced human eosinophil degranulation. The beta-adrenoceptor agonists, isoproterenol and salbutamol, induced relatively low level increases in intracellular cAMP, and weakly suppressed EDN release induced by IgG-coated beads. However, cellular pretreatment with IBMX synergistically enhanced the inhibitory effects of isoproterenol or salbutamol on both IgG and sIgA-induced eosinophil degranulation. Similarly, PGE2 treatment increased intracellular cAMP concentrations in eosinophils and correspondingly inhibited the Ig-dependent cellular degranulation response: co-incubation with IBMX further enhanced both effects of PGE2. Finally, cholera toxin, which irreversibly activates the stimulatory guanine nucleotide-binding protein linked to adenylyl cyclase, strongly inhibited the release of EDN from IgG- or sIgA-stimulated eosinophils. The time-dependent accumulation of cAMP in cholera toxin-treated cells closely paralleled the time courses of inhibition of IgG- and sIgA-induced EDN release after toxin exposure. These data indicate that the cAMP-dependent signal transduction mechanism in eosinophils exerts a negative modulatory effect on the cellular degranulation responses induced by sIgA or IgG. The inhibitory effects of cAMP on eosinophil activation may provide an important physiologic and a clinically relevant therapeutic mechanism for limiting the release of eosinophil-derived cytotoxic proteins during certain allergic or inflammatory responses in vivo.\r"

NG-monomethyl-L-arginine (NGMMA), a specific inhibitor of the nitric oxide synthetase pathway, markedly augments Con A-induced proliferation of rat splenic leukocytes. Macrophages are necessary and sufficient for NGMMA-releasable-suppression, as indicated by a loss of suppression after either pretreatment of isolated splenic macrophages with NGMMA or their depletion by plastic adherence or L-leucine methyl ester. L- (but not D-) arginine overrides NGMMA-releasable suppression, and suppression is blocked by RBC as would be expected if nitric oxide were the effector molecule. Unlike rats, NGMMA did not augment Con A-induced proliferation of normal mouse splenic leukocytes. However, NGMMA did augment Con A-induced proliferation of mouse splenic leukocytes induced to contain suppressor macrophages by intravenous injection of Corynebacterium parvum, which suggests a quantitative, not qualitative, difference in suppressor macrophages between rats and mice. Nitrite production, as an indicator of nitric oxide synthesis, correlated with suppressor macrophage activity in rats and mice and was inhibited by NGMMA. Finally, NGMMA also markedly enhanced proliferation with every other mitogen examined (PHA, protein A, PWM, and LPS). It is concluded that immunoregulation of lymphocyte proliferation by suppressor macrophages is mediated, in part, directly or indirectly by products of the nitric oxide synthetase pathway.\r"

We found that dexamethasone selectively and coordinately inhibited expression of the following human metalloproteinases: interstitial collagenase, stromelysin, and the 92-kDa type IV collagenase, as well as TIMP. Both basal and LPS-stimulated cells exhibited similar degrees of inhibition, with greater than 50% decrease in secretion of all enzymes and TIMP observed at dexamethasone concentrations of greater than or equal to 10(-8) M in serum-containing medium. The effects of dexamethasone were mediated at a pretranslational level. In summary, our results indicate that glucocorticoids suppress the matrix-degrading phenotype that is characteristic of mature human mononuclear phagocytes, and block the effects of the most potent known signal for upregulation of metalloproteinase secretion. Similar actions in vivo would serve to limit tissue damage associated with the inflammatory response.\r"

These responses to SL-1 were examined in relation to diacylglycerol (DAG) generation, Ca2+ availability and activation of guanine nucleotide binding proteins to clarify the signal transduction pathways involved. Pertussis toxin inhibited the ability of SL-1 to both stimulate neutrophils directly and to prime neutrophils for subsequent responses induced by PMA, suggesting a role for one or more guanine nucleotide regulating proteins in both responses. SL-1 induced a rise in neutrophil DAG levels. DAG generation was inhibited by pretreatment of cells with pertussis toxin. Depletion of extracellular Ca2+ ablated O2- release induced by stimulatory levels of SL-1 but did not inhibit the priming effect induced by substimulatory concentrations of the lipid. Investigation of the activation of the neutrophil NADPH oxidase in a cell-free system revealed that the SL-1-priming effect was associated with translocation of the soluble cytosolic factors required for activation of the enzyme. Cytosolic factor translocation was not observed in pertussis toxin pretreated cells. Our results provide evidence for the role of a guanine nucleotide binding protein in both priming and direct activation of neutrophils by SL-1. This G protein regulates both SL-1-induced DAG generation and cytosolic cofactor translocation involved in neutrophil activation and priming. The multiplicity of effects of SL-1 on signal transduction pathways leading to phagocyte activation and priming may exert a profound influence on the pathogenicity of M. tuberculosis.\r"

In the present study, the immunologic status of immunized mice was evaluated by studying their ability to mount in vivo and in vitro plaque-forming cell responses to SRBC. SL3235-immunized mice exhibited marked suppression in their ability to generate anti-SRBC plaque-forming cell responses. Suppression was active and mediated by soluble factors as demonstrated by the capacity of immune cells to suppress the responses of normal cells in co-culture and across a membrane in transwell plates. Depletion of T cells from immune spleens did not alleviate the suppressive activity of the remaining cells. Depletion of splenic adherent cells resulted in partial alleviation of suppressive activity, demonstrating that mature macrophages are partly responsible for mediating the observed suppression. A sequential multi-step depletion procedure resulted in marked enrichment of a second suppressor cell population that was Mac1+, Thy-1.2-, surface Ig-, J11d-, non-adherent, non-phagocytic, and esterase negative. When cultured in vitro in the presence of L cell-conditioned medium, but not in the presence of Con A supernatant, these cells matured into typical macrophages within 72 h of culture. The cell population enriched for macrophage precursors (75%) retained the suppressive capacity of unfractionated splenocytes. Our data indicate that, in addition to the well-described involvement of mature macrophages in suppressing immune responses, bacterial infection may induce appearance of macrophage precursors that may also play an important regulatory role in the immune system.\r"

Furthermore, in this study we demonstrate the 66-kDa protein to be a potent inducer of lymphoproliferation in the patient immune to B. burgdorferi. Monospecific polyclonal antibodies and mAb demonstrate that each of these proteins was immunologically distinct. However, direct amino acid sequence of the 66- and 68-kDa Ag was almost identical and had a high level of sequence similarity to the GroEL heat-shock protein (Hsp60) of Escherichia coli and the 60-kDa immunodominant protein of Treponema pallidum. The amino terminal sequence of the 71- and 73-kDa proteins of B. burgdorferi was almost identical and these proteins had remarkable sequence similarity to the DnaK heat-shock protein of E. coli (Hsp70). It appears likely, therefore, that proteins related to the heat-shock family are potent immunogens of B. burgdorferi.\r"

In contrast to Mo, macrophages killed both species to an equivalent extent. Mo exhibited a greater candida-stimulated respiratory burst than did monocyte-derived macrophages, and the respiratory burst was required for the killing of both species. C. parapsilosis was killed much more easily than C. albicans by exposure to low concentrations of hypochlorite or monochloramine, MPO-dependent oxidants released by Mo but not macrophages, which lack MPO. With six different Candida strains there was a significant correlation between killing by Mo and susceptibility to hypochlorite (r = 0.926) or monochloramine (r = 0.981) (p less than 0.01 for each). Species differences in resistance to killing by Mo may be related to differences in sensitivity to MPO-derived oxidants, and the ability of C. albicans to resist the effects of these oxidants may be a virulence factor associated with this species.\r"

The CD8+ class I-restricted CTL response to CMV assists in preventing progression of CMV infection to life-threatening disease; however, the viral Ag recognized by CD8+ CTL are not well characterized. In general, virus-specific CTL recognize endogenously synthesized viral proteins processed and presented associated with class I MHC molecules. Although proteins or inactivated virions have been experimentally delivered to the cytoplasm to result in class I MHC presentation, this mode of Ag delivery to the class I processing pathway after natural viral entry has not been documented in humans. Our data demonstrate that the CMV-specific class I-restricted CTL response in individuals latently infected with CMV is predominantly specific for selected structural virion proteins introduced into the cell after viral penetration and efficient recognition occurs in the absence of de novo viral gene expression. This CTL response may provide a biological advantage for limiting the spread of infection after CMV reactivation because infected cells are lysed before viral assembly.\r"

Moreover, by examining the V gene usage in strains congenic at the Igh locus, we also determined that the strain-specific factor was encoded by sequences lying outside of the Igh locus. We decided to examine whether there are differences in Vh gene rearrangement between alleles in an F1 strain. To do this analysis we chose to examine the relative Ig H chain V region gene usage of pre-B cell lines derived from (C57BL/6 x BALB/c)F1 fetal liver cells by Southern blot analysis. We found a high frequency of Vh-gene rearrangements (77% of the alleles had VDJ rearrangements) and these rearrangements occurred to Vh-genes throughout the Vh locus and were not confined to the D-proximal Vh-genes as has been previously observed with lines from other mouse strains. The Vh-gene usage pattern is similar on both alleles indicating that at least one of the determinants of which Vh-gene is used is trans-acting and acts similarly on each allele. Furthermore, one allele, Ighb (donated by the C57BL/6 parent), rearranged Vh-genes more frequently than the other allele, Igha (donated by the BALB/c parent) suggesting that one of the determinants of Vh-gene rearrangement may be acting in an allele-specific manner.\r"

The equal band protein phenotype, in which equal quantities of the two species are expressed, had bands at both 4 and 2 kb. The polymorphic HindIII site was localized to an intron within the membrane cofactor protein gene between exon 1 (codes for 5'UT/signal peptide) and exon 2 (codes for the first short consensus repeat). Using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), sequences around this site were amplified and a single band of 260 bp was produced. In the U phenotype, the PCR product was restricted with HindIII into 200- and 60-bp fragments. In the L phenotype, there was no change in the size of 260 bp upon restriction with HindIII. For the equal band protein phenotype, the PCR product was partially cleaved. The 260-bp PCR product was subcloned and sequenced. DNA from the U phenotype demonstrated an intact HindIII site (AAGCTT), whereas in the DNA of the L phenotype, this site was altered because a \"G\" was substituted for a \"C\" (AAGGTT).\r"

Furthermore, PMA treatment resulted in reduced steady-state levels of CD4 mRNA and inhibition of the relative rate of transcription of the CD4 gene. Cells expressing transfected CD4 cDNA gene products modulated in response to PMA, however, re-expressed CD4 earlier than cells expressing the product of the wild-type CD4 gene. These data suggest that the cell surface expression of the CD4 molecule is probably down-regulated at the level of the protein, as well as the gene, and that inhibition of transcription may affect the kinetics of CD4 expression. These observations provide further insight into the mechanisms by which HIV affects expression of CD4.\r"

Previous in situ hybridization studies have shown that some subpopulations of these cells, cytotrophoblast cells within and exterior to placental villi, contain class I HLA mRNA. Those studies, performed under moderate conditions of stringency, did not determine which member(s) of the class I HLA gene family was transcribed. In this study, in situ hybridization experiments were conducted under conditions of high stringency using biotinylated antisense and sense RNA probes specific for HLA-G and HLA-E. HLA-G mRNA was identified in first trimester cytotrophoblast cells and in term chorionic membrane cytotrophoblast cells, but was low to undetectable in syncytiotrophoblast of both early and late gestation placentas. Placental villous mesenchymal cells in first trimester but not term placentas contained HLA-G transcripts. HLA-E mRNA was clearly identified only in small round cells present in first trimester decidua and term membranes. These experiments provide the first direct evidence for transcription of the HLA-G gene by cytotrophoblast cells in situ. Expression of this nonpolymorphic gene in place of HLA-A,B,C by trophoblast cells exposed to maternal blood and tissues may allow the juxtaposition of genetically disparate cells required for human pregnancy.\r"

The mechanisms of selection of VH genes expressed by differentiating B cells remain to be elucidated. We have made use of RNA-RNA in situ hybridization to probe the repertoire of VH gene-families assembled in peripheral B cells of normal adults. Cells were in vitro activated with mitogens and then hybridized to [35S]-labeled anti-sense RNA probes specific for C mu and C gamma genes, and for the six known human VH gene-families. We found that the numbers of cells expressing C mu and C gamma mRNA were similar to the total numbers of cells expressing members of the six VH gene-families. Therefore, the six known VH gene-families represent essentially the human VH locus. We also found that expression of VH gene-families does not closely correlate with their relative genomic complexity. This apparently biased expression may suggest that in some VH gene-families the ratio of pseudogenes/functional genes is particularly high, and/or that regulatory mechanisms play a major role in shaping the available VH gene repertoire in differentiating B cells.\r"

The present investigations used two-color flow cytometry to examine B lymphocytes from the spleens and lymph nodes of PC-mice and found decreased surface membrane expression of surface IgM (sIgM), transferrin receptors (TfR) and IgE FcR (CD23), increased expression of class II MHC, but normal expression of B220, Mel-14, Fc gamma RII, and Fc mu R. These changes were not related to the H chain class or the amount of Ig produced by the plasmacytoma. When cultured with IL-4, B lymphocytes from PC-mice increased their expression of sIgM and class II MHC, but not of CD23. Several findings implicate transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) in the mechanism that modulates receptor expression on B lymphocytes in PC-mice: a) ascites fluid from PC-mice contains large quantities of TGF-beta 1; b) supernatants of cultured spleen cells from PC mice contain up to eightfold more TGF-beta than is found with normal spleen cells; c) cloned plasmacytoma cells produce TGF-beta in vitro; and d) the abnormal phenotype of B cells from PC-mice, i.e., decreased CD23, sIgM, and TfR, and increased class II MHC, is induced on normal B cells cultured in the presence of TGF-beta 1. Because sIgM, TfR, class II MHC, and CD23 are molecules that play fundamental roles in the activation of normal B cells, their modulation by TGF-beta 1: a) identifies molecular mechanisms that could account for some of the known immunosuppressive properties of TGF-beta 1 and b) implicates TGF-beta in the pathogenesis of the polyclonal B cell immunodeficiency that is characteristic of plasma cell tumors.\r"

Although anti-CRP prevents target cell lysis, it does not block E:T cell conjugate formation. In parallel experiments, the number of conjugates observed in the presence of anti-CRP was normal, whereas the number of target cells killed by this same group of effector cells was greatly inhibited. Since an early stage of NK-mediated lysis requires calcium, conjugates can be synchronized by incubating effector and target cells in the absence of calcium. When conjugates were formed in the absence of calcium, and anti-CRP and calcium were then added to cultures at the same time, anti-CRP inhibited maximally. Anti-CRP continued to inhibit somewhat throughout the calcium-dependent stage but did not block lysis when added after the completion of calcium requiring events. Events that are blocked by anti-CRP must be required for the generation of NK cytotoxic factor because anti-CRP blocks the production of this factor. Once generated, however, anti-CRP does not block the activity of NK cytotoxic factor. This evidence indicates that anti-CRP blocks NK-mediated lysis at the calcium dependent stage of lysis. Events that follow this stage in the lytic process are also inhibited.\r"

This heterogeneity has been found to reflect structural polymorphism among the corresponding target Ag, thus defining HLA-A2 subtypes. A previous study (van der Poel et al. 1986. Human Immunol. 16:247) established the existence of a new HLA-A2.4 variant, A2-SCHU, that was distinguished from A*0206 (A2.4a) by HLA-A2-specific alloreactive CTL. The same CTL subdivided HLA-A2.1 Ag into two subgroups. In the present study, the molecular basis of this heterogeneity has been examined by double-label comparative peptide mapping analysis of differentially recognized A2.1 and A2.4 Ag. In addition, we have determined the complete sequence of polymerase chain reaction-amplified full length cDNA from A2-SCHU. The results show that: 1) A2-SCHU is indistinguishable from A*0206 by peptide mapping; 2) the cDNA sequence of A2-SCHU is identical to that of A*0206; and 3) two differentially recognized A2.1 Ag are both indistinguishable from A*0201 by comparative peptide mapping. These results indicate that differential recognition by alloreactive CTL can occur among structurally identical class I HLA Ag and suggest that allorecognition by such CTL may involve corecognition of endogenous peptides, presumably derived from polymorphic proteins.\r"

To elucidate the mechanism responsible for the abbreviated signaling requirement of peritoneal B cells, studies of intracellular Ca2+ and PKC were carried out. Measurements using the calcium sensitive dye, Indo-1, showed that base line levels of intracellular Ca2+ in peritoneal B cells were similar to those of splenic B cells, and that there was no change as a result of phorbol ester treatment. However, measurements of PKC based on the phosphorylation of histone showed enzymatic activity in peritoneal B cells to be about 60% greater than that of splenic B cells on a per microgram protein basis. Furthermore, this difference was accentuated by phorbol ester treatment, so that after 4 h, membrane and cytosol fractions from peritoneal B cells contained more than 5 times the PKC activity of the corresponding splenic B cell fractions because the down-regulation of PKC was relatively delayed in peritoneal B cells. This could not be accounted for by the onset of new PKC synthesis, but may relate to the finding that peritoneal B cells express more of the alpha-isoenzyme of PKC than splenic B cells, as shown by immunoblot analysis. Together with data from experiments using the PKC inhibitor 1-(5-isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine dihydrochloride(H7), these results suggest that PKC activity remaining hours after phorbol ester treatment may contribute to the unusual phorbol ester responsiveness of peritoneal B cells, and indicate that B cells from separate anatomic locations differ in terms of several parameters relating to the activity and behavior of PKC.\r"

There is much evidence to indicate that MHC class II molecules can bind to CD4; however, binding of intact class II molecules under physiologic conditions has been difficult to demonstrate. We investigated whether a previously reported human lymphokine, lymphocyte chemoattractant factor (LCF), which was described for its effects on human CD4+ lymphocytes and monocytes, could associate directly with CD4 and induce the generation of second messengers. In the present study, we demonstrate that CD4 affinity-purified natural and recombinant LCF induced a rise in intracellular calcium and increased inositol trisphosphate generation in normal human CD4+ lymphocytes and murine T cell hybridomas infected to express human CD4. Cell lines lacking human CD4 or expressing human CD4 molecules that lack the intracytoplasmic domain did not demonstrate a change in either calcium or inositol trisphosphate. The effect of LCF was blocked by coincubation with either anti-CD4 antibody or Fab fragments from anti-CD4 antibody. These studies demonstrate direct interaction of a lymphokine with CD4 and generation of second messengers as a result of the interaction.\r"

  ".W": "Engagement of the TCR initiates at least two transmembrane signaling pathways, the phosphatidylinositol pathway and a tyrosine kinase pathway. The T cell leukemic line Jurkat was used to study the relationship between the number of occupied TCR on the cell surface and the TCR-mediated activation of phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C. We characterized a series of Ti beta-chain transfectants of the Jurkat mutant J.RT3-T3.5, in which surface expression of the TCR is limited by expression of the TCR beta-chain. Calibrated flow cytometry was used to determine the number of binding sites for anti-CD3 mAb on the surface of these cells, which was less than 1.2 x 10(3) to 1.2 x 10(4) sites/cell. In the presence of lithium chloride, the accumulation of inositol phosphates (InsP) in these cell lines in response to saturating concentrations of anti-CD3 mAb was proportional to the calculated surface TCR number. This result was consistent with dose-response studies using anti-CD3 mAb in Jurkat cells, in which ligand concentration, rather than number of binding sites, was limiting. Increase in intracellular free calcium concentration was a sensitive indicator of TCR engagement and correlated with the level of TCR expression, but less closely than did InsP levels. Induction of the early lymphocyte activation marker CD69 by anti-CD3 mAb also correlated with surface expression of TCR. In order to test whether limitation of this signaling pathway by TCR number may be relevant to signal transduction in the wild-type cell, we compared PLC activity in Jurkat cells during soluble anti-CD3 mAb-induced internalization of the TCR and also in response to immobilized mAb. The net accumulation of InsP per min decreased linearly with TCR number during the rapid phase of TCR internalization, confirming the limiting role of TCR number in this system. When internalization was prevented by immobilization of the stimulus, there was no decrease in the net accumulation of InsP per minute over time. In a Jurkat cell line transfected with the heterologous human muscarinic receptor, subtype 1, the InsP response to a muscarinic agonist was unaffected by TCR internalization, indicating that the distal phosphatidylinositol pathway was not affected by prolonged stimulation of the TCR. We conclude that transmembrane signaling through the TCR may be regulated by the number of surface TCR-ligand complexes. This observation has implications for transmembrane signaling in both mature T cells and thymocytes.\r"

Two I-Ed-restricted epitopes were analyzed: hemagglutinin (HA) 111-119, which is processed by the exogenous/endocytic pathway, and neuraminidase (NA) 79-93, which has a requirement for cytosolic processing. NA 79-93 is presented from infectious but not non-replicative virus under ordinary conditions. This requirement for viral biosynthesis could be bypassed by using a soluble inhibitor of NA,2,3-dehydro-2-deoxy-N-acetyl neuraminic acid (DDAN), to facilitate cytosolic introduction of virus. APC exposed to UV virus/DDAN present HA and NA determinants derived directly from proteins of the input virus particles. This allows presentation of both endocytically and cytosolically processed epitopes in the same experiment using noninfectious virus. The inhibitor brefeldin A (BFA) was used to interrupt host protein transport at various times relative to virus/DDAN addition. We observed that BFA added simultaneously with virus blocked recognition of NA 79-93 but not HA 111-119. This distinction was found to be based upon different expression kinetics of the HA and NA determinants. Expression of NA 79-93 required 6 to 9 h, whereas HA 111-119 was presented by 1 h after Ag addition. When APC were incubated with BFA at intervals before virus addition, presentation of HA 111-119 was also blocked as a function of time. Data indicate that about 5 h of BFA treatment is needed to deplete host protein pools required for presentation of I-Ed-restricted T cell determinants processed from either endosomes or the cytosol.\r"

  ".W": "MHC proteins are polymorphic cell surface glycoproteins involved in the binding of peptide Ag and their presentation to T lymphocytes. The polymorphic amino acids of MHC proteins are primarily located in the N-terminal domains and are thought to influence T cell recognition both by influencing the binding of peptide Ag and by direct contact with the T cell receptor. In order to determine the relative importance of individual polymorphic amino acids in Ag presentation, a number of groups have taken the approach of interchanging polymorphic amino acids between different alleles of MHC protein in an attempt to define which of the polymorphisms influence peptide binding and which influence T cell recognition by direct contact with the TCR. The peptide OVA323-339 has been previously shown to bind to the MHC class II protein Ad and to have a much lower affinity for Ak, whereas the peptide hen egg lysozyme 46-61 binds well to Ak and poorly to Ad. In the present report, we have analyzed the ability of purified wild-type MHC class II proteins as well as the ability of three different hybrid molecules between Ad and Ak to bind and present these peptides. We find that the alpha-chain of the MHC class II protein plays a critical role in the binding of HEL46-61 and confers the specificity for binding OVA323-339, regardless of which beta-chain is present. We also find that the beta-chain region 65-67 does not control the specificity of peptide binding to the MHC protein, but is important in T cell responses to preformed MHC-peptide complexes, suggesting a role for this region in contacting the TCR.\r"

Although provision of an extracellular matrix (fibronectin, laminin, or matrigel) was essential, the cell cultures were not dependent on exogenously added growth factors (platelet-derived growth factor, epidermal growth factor with or without heparin) for continuous culture. Specific staining for endothelial cell (EC) markers (factor VIII, Ulex europaeus type 1 lectin) and the secretion of endothelin, a vascular EC product, were demonstrated. The KS cells secreted large amounts of cytokines (granulocyte-macrophage-CSF, TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, and especially IL-6). Conditioned media from the KS cells caused normal capillary EC to proliferate. The KS cells synthesized fibroblast growth activity in amounts sufficient to induce the proliferation of normal EC and fibroblasts. These data support the existence of a paracrine pathway of EC proliferation in KS and suggest that KS cells could sustain their own growth via an autocrine mechanism.\r"

  ".W": "C57BL/6 (B6) mice respond to immunization with acetylcholine receptor (AChR) from Torpedo californica as measured by T cell proliferation, antibody production, and the development of muscle weakness resembling human myasthenia gravis. The congenic strain B6.C-H-2bm12 (bm12), which differs from B6 by three amino acid substitutions in the beta-chain of the MHC class II molecule I-A, develops a T cell proliferative response but does not produce antibody or develop muscle weakness. By examining the fine specificity of the B6 and bm12 T cell responses to AChR by using T cell clones and synthetic AChR peptides, we found key differences between the two strains in T cell epitope recognition. B6 T cells responded predominantly to the peptide representing alpha-subunit residues 146-162; this response was cross-reactive at the clonal level to peptide 111-126. Based on the sequence homology between these peptides and the T cell response to a set of truncated peptides, the major B6 T cell epitope was determined to be residues 148-152. The cross-reactivity of peptides 146-162 and 111-126 could also be demonstrated in vivo. Immunization of B6 mice with either peptide primed for T cell responses to both peptides. In contrast, immunization of bm12 mice with peptide 111-126 primed for an anti-peptide response, which did not cross-react with 146-162. Peptide-reactive T cells were not elicited after immunization of bm12 mice with 146-162. These results define a major T cell fine specificity in experimental autoimmune myasthenia gravis-susceptible B6 mice to be directed at alpha-subunit residues 148-152. T cells from disease-resistant bm12 mice fail to recognize this epitope but do recognize other portions of AChR. We postulate that alpha-148-152 is a disease-related epitope in murine experimental autoimmune myasthenia gravis. In this informative strain combination, MHC class II-associated determinant selection, rather than Ag responsiveness per se, may play a major role in determining disease susceptibility.\r"

  ".W": "To assess the role of IL-1 in the development of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), the effects of in vivo treatment with IL-1 alpha or an IL-1 antagonist on the clinical course of EAE were evaluated. First, Lewis rats were immunized with guinea pig myelin in CFA and treated for 19 consecutive days with i.p. injections of recombinant human IL-1 alpha. Clinical signs of paralysis in the IL-1 alpha-treated groups were of longer duration and of greater severity compared to placebo injected controls. In addition, more weight loss was observed in the IL-1 alpha-treated groups compared to controls. This enhanced weight loss was not due to IL-1 alpha injections alone as CFA-treated rats injected with IL-1 alpha did not lose weight when compared to placebo injected, CFA-treated controls. Second, soluble mouse rIL-1R (sIL-1R), which binds both IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta, was given as an IL-1 antagonist. Treatment of guinea pig myelin/CFA immunized rats with sIL-1R for 13 consecutive days significantly delayed the onset of EAE, reduced the severity of paralysis and weight loss, and shortened the duration of disease. Treatment with sIL-1R was most effective in reducing EAE if administered for 15 consecutive days immediately after immunization. Shortened 5-day treatment regimens spanning days 1 to 5, days 6 to 10, or days 11 to 15 after immunization were less effective in reducing EAE. These data suggest that IL-1 may initiate or promote inflammation within the central nervous system. In addition, specifically blocking the biological activity of IL-1 in vivo by soluble receptors may prove beneficial for the treatment of autoimmune or inflammatory diseases.\r"

Immunopathologic studies of acute diabetes show that the islets are infiltrated by T cells and macrophages. It has been hypothesized that the islets are damaged by the secretion of cytokines such as IL-1 and TNF-alpha and that their function may be altered by IL-6. In this study, we utilized in situ hybridization to determine the expression of the IL-1, TNF, and IL-6 genes within the pancreas of the acute diabetic Biobreeding Worcester rat. These studies showed that cells expressing IL-1, TNF, and IL-6 were present within the islets and in the exocrine pancreas surrounding islets, ducts, and vessels and in an interstitial location. Cells expressing TNF and IL-1 mRNA were present in about 20% of the islets, whereas cells expressing IL-6 were present in about 4% of the islets. Islets containing TNF- or IL-1-positive cells contained about three positive cells per islet whereas only about one IL-6-positive cell was present per islet. In 26% of the islets peri-insular TNF-positive cells were found. Peri-insular IL-1 positive cells were seen in 14% of the islets and 8% showed peri-insular IL-6 positive cells. In nondiabetic 30-day old DP or 90-day-old DR rats intra-islet cytokine gene expression was not seen. Our studies support the view that cytokines are important in beta cell destruction.\r"

  ".U": "91201862\r", 
  ".W": "Interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein (IRBP), a retinal-specific Ag, induces experimental autoimmune uveitis in a variety of animals. We have previously shown that sequence 1169-1191 of bovine IRBP is the immunodominant epitope of this protein in Lewis rats and is highly immunogenic and uveitogenic in these rats. The active site of peptide 1169-1191 was determined by testing its truncated forms. The shortest peptide to be immunologically active was found to be 1182-1190 (WEGVGVVPD). To determine the role of individual residues of this sequence, we have tested the immunologic activities of nine analogs of peptide 1181-1191, in which each of residues 1182-1190 was substituted with alanine (A). The tested activities included the capacity to induce experimental autoimmune uveitis and cellular responses in immunized rats, as well as the capability to stimulate lymphocytes sensitized against IRBP or the parent peptide 1181-1191. Analogs that did not stimulate these lymphocytes were also tested for their capacity to competitively inhibit the proliferative response to 1181-1191. Analogs A(1184), A(1186), and A(1187) resembled 1181-1191 in their activities, whereas the other analogs exhibited remarkably reduced activities, with several patterns being noticed. Analog A(1182) was inactive in all tests. Analog A(1190) was very weakly uveitogenic and non-immunogenic, but it stimulated lymphocytes sensitized against IRBP or 1181-1191 when added at exceedingly high concentrations. Analogs A(1183) and A(1185) resembled A(1190) in being weakly uveitogenic and A(1185) was also found to be poorly immunogenic. In addition, relatively high concentrations of A(1183) and A(1185) were needed to stimulate lymphocytes sensitized against IRBP or 1181-1191. However, a different pattern of activities was exhibited by analogs A(1188) and A(1189). These peptides were uveitogenic and immunogenic, but failed to stimulate lymphocytes sensitized to IRBP or 1181-1191. Furthermore, A(1188) and A(1189), but not A(1182), also inhibited the response to 1181-1191 of a cell line specific toward this parent peptide. The data are interpreted to show that residues 1188 and 1189 are involved in the interaction of the peptide with the TCR, whereas residues 1182 and 1190 and, perhaps, 1183 and 1185, are pivotal for the binding of peptide 1181-1190 to the MHC molecules on APC.\r"

In contrast, normal control mouse strains do not produce detectable amounts of such RNA in their thymuses. Prior studies have attributed a defect in experimental tolerance in murine lupus to a bone marrow stem cell rather than to the thymic epithelium; in contrast, infectious retroviral expression has been associated with the thymic epithelium, rather than with the bone marrow stem cell. The present study was designed to determine whether the abnormal Mpmv expression associated with murine lupus mapped to thymic epithelium or to a marrow precursor. Lethally irradiated control and lupus-prone mice were reconstituted with T cell depleted bone marrow; one month later their thymuses were studied for endogenous retroviral RNA and protein expression. Recipients of bone marrow from nonautoimmune donors expressed neither 8.4-kb Mpmv RNA nor surface MCF gp70 in their thymuses. In contrast, recipients of bone marrow from autoimmune NZB or BXSB donors expressed thymic 8.4-kb Mpmv RNA and mink cell focus-forming gp70. These studies demonstrate that lupus-associated 8.4-kb Mpmv endogenous retroviral expression is determined by bone marrow stem cells.\r"

Moreover, it has been shown that susceptibility is determined by H-2As and that Th cells are required for the induction of these immunopathologic alterations by HgCl2. In the present study we showed that treatment in vivo with anti-IL-4 mAb completely abrogated the HgCl2-induced increase in total IgE and partially inhibited the increase in IgG1, but failed to suppress the increase in IgG2A. Furthermore, we showed that IL-4 influences the pattern of IgG subclass distribution among ANo1A of HgCl2-treated mice. Whereas treatment with anti-IL-4 mAb significantly reduced the titers of IgG1 ANolA, it increased those of IgG2A, IgG2B, and IgG3 ANolA. Thus, these results show that IL-4 contributes to the optimal formation in vivo of murine IgG1 and that it is involved in the autoantibody formation of a systemic autoimmune disease. The available evidence suggests that HgCl2 induces an increased production of IL-4 by Th2 cells. If this is correct, it implies that MHC class II alleles determine whether the preferential response to HgCl2 is made by Th1 or Th2 cells and, hence, the type of immunopathologic alterations ensuing.\r"

TGF-beta 1 markedly inhibited the activation and proliferation of myelin-basic protein-specific lymph node cells in vitro. This reduced the capacity of these cells to transfer EAE. In addition, administration of TGF-beta 1 in vivo consistently resulted in an improved clinical course, even when given during ongoing disease. Immunopathologic study demonstrated a marked reduction in central nervous system damage and expression of cell-surface lymphocyte function-associated Ag-1 and class II MHC molecules in TGF-beta 1-treated mice.

  ".W": "Despite an ever increasing body of information concerning general in vivo immune reactivity to exogenous Ag, relatively little is known concerning regional tissue influences on these responses. One expression of regionally distinct immune regulation is the deviant form of systemic immunity induced after the introduction of Ag, such as BSA, into the anterior chamber of the eye--anterior chamber-associated immune deviation (ACAID). ACAID is characterized by a selective, systemic immune deficiency in which both Ag-specific delayed hypersensitivity (DH) and complement-fixing antibody production are impaired by populations of Ts lymphocytes, although other immune effector modalities are preserved. Recent evidence demonstrates that the blood of mice that receive an anterior chamber injection of BSA 48 h earlier contains leukocytes capable of inducing cell-mediated Ag-specific efferent suppression of DH similar to that seen in mice with ACAID. Additional analysis of these bloodborne suppression-inducing leukocytes revealed them to express the mature macrophage/monocyte marker F4/80. On the basis of these findings, we wished to determine the source of the ACAID-inducing cells present in the peripheral blood of mice after anterior chamber inoculation of BSA. The data reveal that cells harvested from the normal eye are capable of selective induction of DH suppressive activity similar to that seen in ACAID. Interestingly, this property is unique to F4/80 expressing cells of the iris and ciliary body (I/CB). F4/80- I/CB cells do not possess this property. Although the F4/80 expressing cells that are present in extraocular sites do not constitutively possess ACAID-inducing properties, exposure of these cells to the anterior chamber microenvironment endows them with this ability. Finally, I/CB cells exposed to Ag in situ, via direct anterior chamber Ag inoculation, induce suppressed Ag-specific DH reactivity when infused into naive syngeneic recipients--a form of systemic immune deviation similar to that seen in mice with ACAID. The results presented here represent the first in vivo description of APC, altered by factors in a local microenvironment, that can initiate a systemic immune response characterized by Ag-specific immune suppression.\r"

Secretion of IL-1 beta comprises a biologic inactive precursor (molecular mass = 31 kDa) and a bioactive low molecular mass peptide (17 to 20 kDa). The questions of where IL-1 beta processing takes place and what is its relationship to secretion remain to be analyzed. Here we report the novel finding that lysates of murine macrophages contain two forms, with molecular masses of 31 and 35 kDa, of the IL-1 beta precursor that can be distinguished by their different electrophoretic mobilities under nonreducing conditions. The more rapid migration of the 31-kDa polypeptide was due to a disulfide-mediated protein folding, as concluded from the following evidence. The native 31-kDa polypeptide could be unfolded to a 35-kDa polypeptide by reduction, and it spontaneously refolded to the 31-kDa polypeptide when the reducing agent was removed. Refolding of the reduced 31-kDa polypeptide was blocked in the presence of iodoacetamide, indicating that alkylation of the protein prevented the re-oxidation of disulfides. Culture supernatants contained predominantly the 31-kDa polypeptide and the mature IL-1 beta with a low m.w. of 20,000. Little or no 35-kDa IL-1 beta was detected extracellularly. These data indicate that murine macrophages contain two populations of the IL-1 beta precursor, one of which can undergo a disulfide-mediated protein folding; they also suggest that oxidation of -SH groups may be critical for the proteolytic processing of the IL-1 beta precursor.\r"

The effects of the cytokine combinations on the five proteins varied; each protein exhibited a unique and specific pattern of response to the cytokine combinations. In Hep G2 cells, antichymotrypsin was induced by all four cytokines, IL-6, IL-1, TNF-alpha, and transforming growth factor beta 1 alone, and their effects in binary combinations could be attributed to additive or minimally synergistic interactions. Fibrinogen was induced only by IL-6 and this induction was inhibited by IL-1 alpha, TNF-alpha or transforming growth factor beta 1. Haptoglobin was also induced only by IL-6, but TNF-alpha was the only cytokine that inhibited this induction at all concentrations of IL-6. Each of the four cytokines alone down regulated production of AFP and albumin. However, binary combinations of the four cytokines were simply additive, for the most part, in inhibiting AFP production, whereas the inhibitory effects of combinations of cytokines on albumin production differed significantly from simple additive effects. These observations, taken together with studies of effects of cytokine combinations on other acute phase proteins, indicate that the various acute phase proteins respond differently to different combinations of cytokines and that the potential exists for highly specific regulation of synthesis of individual plasma proteins by cytokine interactions. These findings imply that the acute phase response in vivo represents the integrated sum of multiple, separately regulated changes in gene expression.\r"

By using mAb against the p55 and p75 TNF-R, NK cells were found to express both p55 and p75 upon activation, and both receptors were involved in the generation of lymphokine-activated killer cells activity. Proliferative activity of IL-2 stimulated NK cells was inhibited by anti-TNF-alpha mAb, indicating that endogenously produced TNF-alpha is important for optimal proliferation of NK cells. Furthermore, addition of rTNF-alpha increased the IL-2-induced proliferation of NK cells. mAb to p55 and p75 inhibited the IL-2-induced proliferation indicating that both TNF-R are involved in mediating this effect.\r"

  ".W": "This study examined mRNA levels and cell surface expression of IL-4 receptor (IL-4R) in murine T and B cells after incubation with IL-4. Northern blot analysis of mRNA levels of T cells isolated from mesenteric lymph nodes and spleen revealed that IL-4 induced a transient augmentation of IL-4R mRNA in a dose-dependent manner. Maximal levels of mRNA were detected as early as 5 h after initiation of culture. These data were complemented by studies examining the cell surface expression of IL-4R using an anti-IL-4R mAb. Resting T and B lymphocytes express IL-4R (T greater than B) and incubation of these cells with exogenous IL-4 increased IL-4R expression to a maximum after 24 h. This effect was abolished after addition of anti-IL-4 antibody. Continuous incubation of T cells in the presence of high concentrations of IL-4 resulted in a down-regulation of IL-4R expression. Addition of the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide blocked the induced increases in IL-4R expression, indicating the requirement for de novo protein synthesis. Both the levels of mRNA and cell surface expression of IL-4R were not affected by addition of exogenous IL-2, and IL-4 regulation of IL-4R expression was not influenced by the immunosuppressive drug cyclosporin A. These data demonstrate that in T and B cells, IL-4 induces a transient up-regulation of IL-4 mRNA levels that is subsequently reflected in increased numbers of IL-4R displayed on the cell surface. This regulation of IL-4R expression by IL-4 provides an important mechanism for amplification of IL-4-dependent activation pathways.\r"

  ".W": "We have investigated whether TNF-induced changes in human endothelial cell (EC) surface Ag expression are mediated by protein kinase C (PKC). This suggestion arose from the observations that PMA, a potent PKC activator, can mimic TNF by inducing expression of endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecule 1, intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), and class I MHC molecules on human EC. However, in contrast to the actions of PMA, TNF neither causes membrane translocation of PKC nor induces the phosphorylation of the myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate, two measures of PKC activation. Moreover, the PKC inhibitor staurosporine can block PMA-induced endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecule 1 expression at 4 h, but does not inhibit the actions of TNF. At 24 h, staurosporine itself induces intercellular adhesion molecule 1 and class I MHC, and acts additively with TNF. Twenty four hour treatment with PMA causes loss of PKC. We propose that at 24 h, staurosporine and PMA share a mechanism of action, namely diminution of PKC activity. However, 24 h treatment with TNF does not reduce the amount of PKC nor does it prevent activation of PKC by PMA. We conclude that TNF effects in EC are not mediated by PKC activation or inactivation.\r"

In TGF-beta-resistant OVA-7T cell clones, TGF-beta inhibited neither the growth of the T cells nor their secretion of granulocyte macrophage CSF. TGF-beta suppressed the expression of c-myc mRNA in OVA-7T-responder but not in OVA-7T-nonresponder cells. TGF-beta resistance was found to be due to a loss of TGF-beta high-affinity binding sites, with an absence of expression of the distinct 54-, 70-, 110-, and 250-kDa surface proteins that bind TGF-beta on TGF-beta-susceptible T cells. Loss of TGF-beta R may enable T cells to escape the negative feedback control provided by TGF-beta secreted from activated T cells during an immune response.\r"

By Western blot analysis, mAb AI206 only reacted with unreduced mAb YH206, whereas it did not react with reduced mAb YH206. Furthermore, mAb AI206 reacted with IgM subunit (180 kDa), F(ab')2 (110 kDa), and F(ab) (50 kDa) of pepsin-treated unreduced mAb YH206. Thus, mAb AI206 recognized the structure of F(ab) of mAb YH206. The mAb YH206 reacted with unreduced mAb AI206, F(ab')2 (110 kDa), and F(ab) (50 kDa) of pepsin-treated unreduced mAb AI206. It is presumed that mAb YH206 and mAb AI206 recognize each other in an unreduced condition but not a reduced condition. The recognition of such a conformational Id on F(ab) is important. Because mAb YH206 recognized the carbohydrate on YH206 Ag as well as the peptide on mAb AI206, the conformation on F(ab) of mAb AI206 may mimic the carbohydrate structure on YH206 Ag. In fact, YH206 antibody activity was induced in syngeneic mouse serum immunized with mAb AI206. These observations suggest that the internal image of YH206 carbohydrate Ag is preserved within the conformational Id on F(ab) of mAb AI206.\r"

To understand this phenomenon in molecular terms, it is important to obtain active, cell-free preparations. In extensive preliminary studies, we could not demonstrate Fc epsilon RI-mediated activation of PI-PLC in plasma membranes prepared by conventional methods from rat basophilic leukemia cells. We now report a stepwise approach involving preparation of cytoplasts from such cells and then hypotonic lysis of the cytoplasts to obtain active membrane vesicles. These membranes, best described as \"ghosts,\" appear to reseal after losing greater than 90% of their soluble, cytoplasmic components and contain receptors that when aggregated, activate PI-PLC to hydrolyze endogenous phospholipids. Per unit of plasma membrane, the ghosts retain approximately 25% of Fc epsilon RI-mediated stimulation of PI-PLC relative to the cells. This activity requires ATP, magnesium, phosphoenolpyruvate, and, to a limited degree, calcium. Although an adequate amount of phosphatidylinositol biphosphate is present, the predicted spike of (1,4,5)-inositol trisphosphate is not seen, and the predominant inositol phosphate isomer is (1,4)-inositol bisphosphate. This is the first report of Fc epsilon RI-mediated activation of PI-PLC in a cytoplasm-depleted system that demonstrates activation of endogenous enzyme acting on endogenous substrate. In addition, it is the first such report for any receptor of the Ig superfamily.\r"

There is considerable evidence that phagosome-granule membrane fusion is regulated by transient increases in intracellular ionized Ca2+. In previous studies, we found that a cytosolic Ca2(+)-dependent membrane-binding protein, annexin III, represents over 1% of the total protein of human neutrophils and promotes tight contact between membranes of isolated specific granules in vitro. To determine whether annexin III localizes to the region of phagosome-granule membrane fusion in vivo, we used a monospecific polyclonal antibody to stain fixed, permeabilized neutrophils that had ingested opsonized yeast. We found that annexin III concentrates in the region surrounding the phagosome. Annexin III was concentrated ninefold in the periphagosomal region compared with the cell body, as demonstrated by laser scanning confocal microscopy. Periphagosomal translocation of annexin III occurred whether yeast were opsonized with IgG, complement, or both, and persisted for at least 1 h after phagocytosis. This is not a general phenomenon, inasmuch as calmodulin was as abundant in the cell body as in the periphagosomal region. These findings imply that annexin III plays a specialized role in the metabolic and structural events that accompany phagocytosis.\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies with the anti-neutrophil/antichymotrypsin mAb 1-15 have identified an activation-associated, chymotrypsin-like activity within the membrane fraction of isolated human neutrophils (PMN). In the present study, the molecular and biochemical characteristics of mAb 1-15 Ag/proteinase were determined. On casein/acrylamide sizing gels, PMN membrane preparations were found to contain an Mr 58,000 to 84,000 band of Ca2(+)-dependent proteinase activity. Reducing and nonreducing SDS-PAGE of mAb 1-15-affinity-purified membrane proteins demonstrated specific recovery of an enzymatically active Mr 65,000 to 70,000 chymotrypsin-like Ag. The presence of a distinct membrane serine esterase of isoelectric point 6.3/Mr 65,000 to 70,000 was confirmed in active site-labeling experiments with the serine proteinase inhibitor [3H]diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP). Substrate-affinity chromatography with phe-Sepharose or FMLP-Sepharose provided partial purification of enzyme activity among Mr 65,000 to 70,000 FMLP- or phe-binding proteins. Enzyme inhibition was obtained by incubation with mAb 1-15, DFP, N-carbobenzoxyl-phe-chlormethyl ketone, or PMSF, but not tosyl-amide-phenylethylchlormethyl ketone, bestatin, aprotinin, or phosphoramidon. In HPLC analysis, [3H]DFP labeled proteinase was found to comigrate with one of three FMLP-affinity-labeled membrane peaks, but unlike the FMLP surface receptor the DFP-labeling membrane proteinase was not modified by endoglycosidase F. We conclude that the mAb 1-15 Ag, which appears to play a role in PMN activation, is a distinct, active, Mr 65,000 to 70,000 serine proteinase with affinity for substrate sites containing aromatic amino acids.\r"

  ".W": "For superoxide (O2-) responses of human neutrophils stimulated by FMLP, experiments were designed to assess the requirement of extracellular calcium [( Ca2+]o) for priming of O2- responses by platelet-activating factor (PAF), PMA, or ionomycin. Although priming by PMA did not require [Ca2+]o, there was, as expected, a requirement for [Ca2+]o for the optimal priming effects of PAF and ionomycin. The ED50 value for [Ca2+]o in the priming function of PAF was 105 microM. The [Ca2+]o-dependent priming with ionomycin was bimodal with two ED50 values for [Ca2+]o of 90 microM and 3.2 mM. Optimal priming by PAF required at least 4-min exposure of cells to [Ca2+]o. Cells primed by PAF exhibited faster initial rates of O2-production after addition of FMLP, but the duration of O2- production was not prolonged. Whereas PAF-primed responses to FMLP are usually associated with increases in intracellular calcium [( Ca2+]i) after addition of FMLP, two conditions were found in which O2- responses to FMLP in PAF-primed cells occurred in the absence of any detectable increase in [Ca2+]i. When cells were loaded with the calcium chelator, bis-(O-aminophenoxy)-ethane-H,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid, and then primed with PAF, normal amounts of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate were formed, but no increase in [Ca2+]i occurred after addition of FMLP even though the cells exhibited a fully primed O2- response; in Ca2(+)-depleted and ionomycin-permeabilized cells that were primed with PAF and then stimulated with FMLP, O2- was generated in amounts comparable to reference control (primed) cells, but there was suppressed production of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and no increase in [Ca2+]i after addition of FMLP to PAF-primed cells. These data confirm the requirement of [Ca2+]o for optimal priming of neutrophils by PAF and ionomycin (but not cells primed by PMA) and indicate that, under certain conditions, generation of O2- in response to FMLP in PAF-primed neutrophils can occur independent of any increase in [Ca2+]i.\r"

Immunoblot analyses showed that the M5 joint cross-reactive antibodies recognized two proteins of human synovium and cartilage of molecular mass 56 and 58 kDa. The cross-reactive antibodies binding to the 56-kDa protein were inhibited by purified vimentin in immunoblot inhibition experiments. M protein-specific antibodies from patients with acute rheumatic fever were also shown to cross-react with joint tissue in a pattern similar to the rabbit antisera.

Cyclosporin A (CsA), an immunosuppressive agent that inhibits Th cell function, was administered to woodchucks chronically infected with woodchuck hepatitis virus (WHV), and resulted in a decreased severity of chronic hepatitis and an increased viremia during the treatment. Adult woodchucks inoculated with WHV and given CsA for 14 wk had increased viremias, decreased acute phase liver injury, and developed chronic infections at a higher rate compared with immunocompetent woodchucks given virus alone (chronicity in seven of seven WHV + CsA + vs zero of nine WHV + CsA-; p less than 0.001). These results in a relevant animal model of hepatitis B virus infection indicate: 1) that liver injury in acute hepadnavirus infections is immune-mediated and not a direct cytopathic effect of virus replication; 2) that Th cells function in the inflammatory response and in the immunologic control of hepadnavirus infection; and 3) that suppression of Th cell function in acute hepadnavirus infection decreases liver injury but alters the outcome of infection in favor of chronicity. These results also suggest continued challenges in the application of CsA in liver transplantation for hepatitis B virus-induced diseases.\r"

  ".W": "The three types of IgG FcR (Fc gamma RI, Fc gamma RII, Fc gamma RIII) on human leukocytes play an important role in elimination of antibody-coated infectious agents. To further understand the role of the different Fc gamma R in mediating this killing, we examined the ability of human myeloid and lymphoid cells to kill the protozoan Toxoplasma gondii in the presence of antitoxoplasma IgG or bispecific antibodies. Although human myeloid cells (monocytes, macrophages, neutrophils, and eosinophils) all lysed unsensitized T. gondii, killing by these cells was significantly enhanced by opsonization with antitoxoplasma rabbit IgG. Human lymphocytes, however, did not lyse T. gondii unless the parasites were coated with antibody. The role of antibody and Fc gamma R in mediating ADCC of T. gondii was then examined using bispecific antibodies made by chemically cross-linking Fab fragments of antitoxoplasma antibodies to Fab fragments of antibodies specific for human leukocyte surface Ag, including Fc gamma R. Thus, simultaneous binding of these bispecifics to parasites and effector cells allowed an evaluation of killing when T. gondii were targeted to each Ag independently. Bispecifics which targeted T. gondii to Fc gamma RI, II or III enhanced lysis by monocytes. However, similar results were obtained with bispecifics targeting T. gondii to non-Fc gamma R Ag (CD11b or beta 2-microglobulin) on monocytes. Likewise, polymorphonuclear leukocytes mediated significantly more lysis in the presence of bispecifics linking T. gondii to Fc gamma RII, Fc gamma RIII, or the two non-Fc gamma R Ag CD11b and beta 2-microglobulin. Thus, although human myeloid cells did not require antibody-Fc gamma R triggering to kill T. gondii, antibody appeared to enhance lysis by capturing and directing the parasites to the effector cell surface. Human lymphocytes, in contrast, mediated significant lysis of T. gondii only in the presence of bispecifics targeting T. gondii to Fc gamma RIII, indicating a requirement for specific triggering of Fc gamma RIII for killing by large granular lymphocytes. Consequently, using bispecifics to compare targeting to specific Ag, both non-Fc gamma R and Fc gamma R, allowed determination of the role of antibody-Fc gamma R interactions in T. gondii killing. In addition, these studies demonstrate the potential of bispecifics in determining the role of specific Ag in killing of or infection by pathogens.\r"

The eight human hybridomas secrete either IgM kappa, IgA1 kappa, or IgA2 kappa antibodies. One HmAb binds bacteria of only one serotype. Five HmAb recognize non-overlapping clusters of 2, 3, or 10 different serotypes. The remaining two HmAb both recognize three serotypes. Two serotypes are recognized by both HmAb, and in addition both HmAb bind one more nonidentical serotype. These results suggest that in man, epitopes are immunodominant, different from serotype-specific determinants detected by conventional rabbit antisera. Screening of clinical isolates revealed that the HmAb recognize not only representative typing strains but also most isolates of the corresponding serotype. In addition, most of the isolates that were non-typable by polyclonal antisera were recognized by one of the HmAb. Fine specificity analyses revealed that all HmAb are highly specific for the isolated capsular polysaccharides (CPS) of bacteria within the corresponding cluster of serotypes. However, the avidity of a HmAb for the different CPS can differ significantly. Taken together, our results suggest that the unequivocal interactions between HmAb and CPS offer the basis for an alternative, better defined classification system, and that passive immunization with a limited number of HmAb may provide a feasible strategy for the protection against the majority of fatal, nosocomial infections with multidrug-resistant strains of K. pneumoniae.\r"

  ".W": "Lyme borreliosis is an infectious disease caused by the tick-borne spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi, which carries the potential for chronic infection. Ag on the etiologic Borrelia are currently being defined structurally and their ability to elicit immune responses delineated. EBV can be used to immortalize human B. burgdorferi-specific B cells from infected donors and generate antibodies against antigenic epitopes encountered in natural infection. A human mAb secreting EBV-transformed B cell line, D7, has been developed that is specific for a 93-kDa B. burgdorferi protein and has been used to characterize this potentially important Ag. D7 produces an IgG3 antibody that detects the 93-kDa Ag as well as smaller fragments at 46 kDa and lower molecular mass. The antibody detects similar epitopes on all B. burgdorferi isolates tested and on a Borrelia hermsii protein with molecular mass greater than 100 kDa but binds poorly to Treponema species. In contrast, polyclonal sera from Lyme disease patients show little binding to the homologous Ag in B. hermsii. Structurally, the 93-kDa protein is associated with the flagellum and may be firmly anchored in the protoplasmic cylinder. It is not solubilized by nonionic detergent treatment of the whole Borrelia. Antibodies against a comparable m.w. protein are present in sera from patients with both early and late infection. Thus, antibodies against this Ag are a sensitive and specific marker of Borrelia infection. This Ag is likely of structural importance and may represent a target of host defenses.\r"

Having previously characterized full-length cDNA clones derived from the 4.3-kb and 1.8-kb factor mRNA, we report here the isolation and eucaryotic expression of full-length cDNA clones coding for the 1.4-kb mRNA species. The 1266-bp cDNA codes for a polypeptide of 330 amino acids and contains two polyadenylation signals and a short poly(A)+tail. The protein is composed of a leader peptide followed by five short consensus repeat domains. It shows a hybrid structure with the last three domains being almost identical to the carboxy-terminal of the classical 150-kDa factor H molecule and the two first domains representing unique short consensus repeat structures. Eucaryotic expression in COS7 cells revealed two polypeptides derived from one cDNA clone that are also found in human serum. Differences between the cDNA clones within the last three domains indicate two distinct, possibly allelic sequences that, in addition, differ from the authentic 150-kDa factor H sequence. Southern blot results support the notion that the 4.3-kb factor H and the 1.4-kb factor H-related mRNA are transcribed from two separate but highly homologous genes.\r"

Several X box-binding activities have been discovered in nuclear extracts from a variety of cell lines. The critical question is: which of these are responsible for mediating X box function? This report provides a further characterization of NF-X, a highly specific X box-binding activity we described previously. The cell-type distribution, structural features, and binding site characteristics of NF-X are analyzed in detail, to facilitate comparison with other reported activities. Most importantly, the functional relevance of NF-X is assessed by scanning mutagenesis, and the results indicate that this complex is indeed involved in regulating MHC class II gene expression. With these data in mind, the relationship between NF-X and RF-X, an X box-binding activity reported to be absent in patients with severe combined immunodeficiency, is discussed.\r"

However, this inhibition is never complete. It has been postulated that escape from feedback may be a property of the Ly-1 B cell subset, whereas rearrangement of endogenous Ig genes may be completely inhibited in conventional B cells. This possibility was investigated in transgenic mice carrying a lambda transgene under the control of the H chain enhancer. It was found that kappa producing B cells in these lambda transgenic mice were for the most part, although not exclusively, of the conventional B cell phenotype. Examination of peritoneal exudate cells revealed that a large proportion of Ly-1 B cells also express kappa. Adoptive transfer of bone marrow from adult lambda transgenic mice, a source of conventional B cell precursors, resulted in the production of relatively high levels of serum kappa 2 to 3 mo after transfer into recipient SCID mice. A high proportion of donor B cells in the spleen produced endogenous kappa protein with or without co-production of lambda. It is concluded that precursors of both conventional and Ly-1 B cells can escape feedback inhibition of L chain gene rearrangement.\r"

  ".U": "91201897\r", 
  ".W": "Studies of the anti-tumor activity of TNF-alpha in vivo have been hampered by the need to administer systemically toxic doses of the cytokine to obtain a curative response. To facilitate studies of the effect of high local concentrations of TNF-alpha on tumor growth and host immunity, a newly induced murine sarcoma was transduced with the gene for human TNF-alpha and the biologic characteristics of these cells were examined. We identified high and low TNF-producing tumor clones which exhibited stable TNF secretion over time. Significant amounts of membrane associated TNF were found in a high-TNF producing clone as well. No difference in the in vitro growth rates between TNF-producing and nonproducing cell lines was observed. In contrast, in vivo studies demonstrate that although unmodified parental tumor cells grew progressively when implanted s.c. in animals, tumor cells transduced with the TNF gene were found to regress in a significant number of animals after an initial phase of growth. This effect correlated with the amount of TNF produced and could be blocked with a specific anti-TNF antibody. Regressions of TNF-producing cells occurred in the absence of any demonstrable toxicity in the animals bearing these tumors. TNF-producing tumor cells could function in a paracrine fashion by inhibiting the growth of unmodified, parental tumor cells implanted at the same site. The ability of tumor cells to regress was abrogated by in vivo depletion of CD4+ or CD8+ T cell subsets and animals that had experienced regression of TNF-producing tumors rejected subsequent challenges of parental tumor. Our studies thus show that tumor cells elaborating high local concentrations of TNF regress in the absence of toxicity in the host and that this process requires the existence of intact host immunity. Studies of the lymphocytes infiltrating the gene modified tumors and attempts to use TNF gene modified tumor infiltrating lymphocytes to deliver high local concentrations of TNF to the tumor site without inducing systemic toxicity are underway.\r"

  ".U": "91201898\r", 
  ".W": "p97 is a human tumor-associated Ag present on most melanoma cells that represents a possible target for immunologic attack. To evaluate the capacity of T cells reactive with this protein to promote elimination of melanoma cells expressing p97, a murine model was developed by transfecting a C3H/HeN melanoma with the p97 cDNA, generating p97-specific CD4+ T cells by in vivo immunization of C3H/HeN mice with a vaccinia/p97 recombinant virus followed by in vitro cloning with soluble p97 protein, and determining whether these CD4+ T cells could mediate rejection of pulmonary metastases. Characterization of the T cell clones demonstrated the presence of both I-Ak and I-Ek-restricted clones, although the majority of clones recognized p97 in the context of I-Ek. Analysis of clonal specificity using truncated p97 proteins revealed that at least three epitopes were immunogenic, and further studies with overlapping 15-amino acid peptides from a region of the p97 molecule defined by these truncated proteins identified an immunodominant epitope responsible for the majority of the I-Ek response. The T cell clones were not capable of directly recognizing the p97-expressing melanoma cells but responded to the tumor if syngeneic APC were present to process the tumor-derived p97 Ag. The therapeutic efficacy of these CD4+ T cell clones was evaluated in an adoptive therapy model in which mice bearing metastatic pulmonary lesions were treated by i.v. administration of the p97-specific cells. Despite the inability of the CD4+ clones to directly respond to or lyse the tumor cells, the clones were effective in promoting tumor eradication. In vitro studies demonstrated that this may have reflected secretion of lymphokines that activated macrophages to lyse the tumor. The results suggest that noncytolytic p97-specific CD4+ T cell clones can be effective in therapy of pulmonary melanoma metastases. Moreover, if human T cells reactive with the p97 protein could be generated, the expression of this tumor-associated Ag in melanoma cells might be adequate for such T cells to mediate a therapeutic antitumor response.\r"

To test this, 0.1 ml of semen from each of 102 patients was placed in 1.0 ml of 150 mosmol/liter eosin citrate fructose solution and incubated for 30 min at 37 degrees C. The percentage viability of the sperm cells was then determined. The results indicated that patients with two or more abnormal semen parameters had a significantly lower percentage viability while in the hypoosmotic solution (40.6 +/- 4.7%), in contrast to non-male-factor patients (69.0 +/- 1.6%). Donor sperm (N = 32) serving as controls (73.3 +/- 2.1%) had a viability in hypoosmotic solution similar to that of non-male-factor patients. The data suggest that sperm of male-factor patients are less able to survive the hypoosmotic stress conditions as shown by the percentage viability in hypoosmotic solution and emphasize the importance of using less stressful sperm processing methods for in vitro fertilization or insemination in these patients.\r"

The objective was to evaluate the in vitro bioassay potential of spermatozoa from these species, in terms of relative sensitivities to toxins in different qualities of water. An average sperm motility index (SMI) was calculated per treatment at 2, 4, and 6 hr, where SMI = fpm2 x % motility. Hamster SMI could be used to discriminate between HQ and IQ media at 4 and 6 hr (P less than 0.001), while rat SMI could be used to discriminate between HQ and IQ media at 6 hr (P less than 0.05). Mouse SMI did not differ between HQ and IQ media. The ability to discriminate between extremes in quality. HQ or IQ vs LQ, was equal between species (P less than 0.001). These results suggest that hamster spermatozoa provide the more sensitive in vitro bioassay model, while rat and mouse spermatozoa may be used for assay of extremes in water quality.\r"

The procedure involved the injection of 5-nl volumes of acidic Hepes-buffered medium at pH 2.5 using a microinjection instrument. Zona-drilled mouse oocytes had significantly higher rates of fertilization (60/99; 61%) than zona-intact oocytes (6/103; 6%) at an insemination concentration of 1 x 10(4) sperm/ml (P less than 0.001). The procedure did not induce parthenogenetic activation of oocytes and more than 97% of zygotes developed to the blastocyst stage. A similar rate of live progeny was observed when zona-drilled (38.0%) and control embryos (38.5%) were transferred to pseudopregnant recipients. Chromosome analyses were performed on zona-intact, zona-free, and zona-drilled oocytes inseminated with varying concentrations of sperm and analysed at the first cleavage division. Zona-free oocytes had high rates of polyploidy (greater than or equal to 40%) with varying insemination numbers but the zona-drilled oocytes did not reveal significant increases in the rate of polyploidy or aneuploidy when compared to controls. In the human studies, zona-drilled oocytes achieved higher rates of fertilization than zona-intact oocytes, with sperm numbers as low as 1 x 10(4)/ml (6/8; 75%). Polyspermic fertilization was observed in 1/2 and 2/6 of fertilized oocytes inseminated with 1 x 10(5) and 1 x 10(4) sperm/ml, respectively. With the low sperm concentration 2/4 of those which were normally fertilized developed to healthy blastocysts. These studies suggest that the zona-drilling technique as described can be performed without apparent harm to oocytes and generate normal embryos.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Patients receiving ondansetron had a higher rate of complete protection from emesis (40% v 30%, P = .07), a higher complete plus major response rate (65% v 51%, P = .016), a lower rate of failure (21% v 36%, P = .007), and a lower median number of emetic episodes (one v two, P = .005) than did those receiving metoclopramide. The median time to the first emetic episode was longer on ondansetron (20.5 v 4.3 hours, P less than .001). Adverse events occurred in 48% of patients receiving ondansetron and 69% of those receiving metoclopramide (P less than .001). Akathisia and acute dystonic reactions occurred only on metoclopramide; headache (controlled with acetaminophen) was significantly more frequent with ondansetron. Ondansetron is more effective, produces fewer adverse events, and is easier to administer than metoclopramide for the prevention of emesis associated with high-dose cisplatin chemotherapy.\r"

  ".W": "Five hundred forty-three patients with completely resected malignant melanoma who were considered to have a significant risk of developing recurrent disease were randomized to one of four study groups. One group received levamisole 2.5 mg/kg on 2 consecutive days weekly for 3 years, a second group received bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) for 3 years. A third group alternated 8-week courses of BCG and levamisole for 3 years and a fourth group underwent clinical assessment at the same frequency as the three treatment groups. The median duration of follow-up is 8.5 years. The percentage of reduction in the death rate and the recurrence rate in the treatment groups compared with the control group was calculated using the Cox proportional hazards model and adjusted for age, sex, and stage as covariants. The patients treated with levamisole were estimated to have a 29% reduction in both the death rate (P = .08) and the recurrence rate (P = .09) compared with patients receiving no further treatment. Fifty-five patients discontinued levamisole early because of gastrointestinal intolerance or arthralgia, myalgia, fever, and immune leukopenia. The patients treated with BCG alternating with levamisole experienced a 10% reduction in the death rate and a 6% reduction in the recurrence rate, and the patients treated with BCG alone experienced a 4% reduction in the death rate and a 3% increase in the recurrence rate compared with the control group. The degree of improvement experienced by the patients that were treated by levamisole is of sufficient magnitude to warrant further investigation of this dose of levamisole as adjuvant treatment in patients with melanoma.\r"

We report two brief weekly chemotherapy regimens designed specifically for elderly patients. Eligible patients were aged 65 to 85 years, had advanced-stage DLCL (diffuse mixed, diffuse large-cleaved or noncleaved, immunoblastic, or diffuse large-cell not otherwise specified). Advanced stage was defined as Ann Arbor stage III or IV or stage I or II with a mass greater than 10 cm or B symptoms. Low-dose doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, bleomycin, and prednisone (LD-ACOP-B) accrued 40 patients between March 1983 and September 1985; 65% achieved a complete response (CR), there were two toxic deaths, the actuarial failure-free survival (FFS) is 19%, disease-specific survival (DSS) 30%, and overall survival (OS) 28%, with a maximum follow-up of 6 years. The regimen of etoposide, doxorubicin, vincristine, bleomycin, and prednisone (VABE) accrued 32 patients between July 1985 and June 1987; 63% achieved a CR, there were two toxic deaths, and the actuarial FFS is 34%, DSS 45%, and OS 36%, with a maximum follow-up of 4 years. There is no difference in FFS, DSS, or OS between these two regimens. VABE caused more myelosuppression and infectious complications, although the toxic death rates were similar. We prefer LD-ACOP-B because follow-up is longer and toxicity is less.\r"

Complete remission (CR) was achieved in 50% of all patients and partial remission (PR) in 33%. Response rates did not differ by histology. Median follow-up is 46 months with 51% of patients alive at 3 years and 63% of CR patients free of disease at 3 years. Severe (grade 3) or worse hematologic toxicity was seen in 51% of all treated individuals, and 29% had severe mucositis. We failed to confirm the high response rates as originally reported.

Sixty-nine percent of the patients had received prior therapy with doxorubicin. The patients received 14 mg/m2 of mitoxantrone every 3 weeks. Nineteen (12%) of the NHL patients and two (7%) of the HD patients had complete responses (CRs). The combined CR and partial response (PR) rates were 37% (60 of 163) for NHL patients and 36% (10 of 28) for HD patients; the median duration of response was 323 days for NHL patients and 209 days for HD patients. The median survival times were 337 days for patients with NHL and 469 days for patients with HD. The median survival time for patients with low-grade NHL was 589 days compared with 298 days for patients with intermediate-grade NHL and 167 days for patients with high-grade NHL. The median time to treatment failure was 73 days for NHL patients and 98 days for HD patients. The major toxicity was myelosuppression, which was moderate and reversible. Nausea, vomiting, and alopecia were mild. There were two cases of congestive heart failure (CHF) considered related to treatment; both patients had received prior treatment with doxorubicin. In this group of heavily pretreated patients, mitoxantrone was effective and well tolerated. Responses were seen with mitoxantrone in patients who had relapsed after prior therapy with doxorubicin and in patients who had failed to respond to prior therapy with doxorubicin. Mitoxantrone should be evaluated in less heavily pretreated patients and should be considered for incorporation into combination chemotherapeutic regimens for the treatment of malignant lymphoma.\r"

  ".W": "We analyzed the records of 96 previously untreated patients with stage IV follicular low-grade lymphoma (FLGL) uniformly treated with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone, and bleomycin (CHOP-Bleo) chemotherapy from 1972 to 1982. The overall complete remission (CR) rate was 77%. At a median follow-up of 138 months, the 10-year cause-specific survival rate was 42% with a median survival of 100 months. Failure-free survival (FFS) was 15% at 10 years with a median FFS of 30 months. Multivariate analysis showed peripheral lymph node size (LN), degree of marrow involvement, and sex, in that order, to be important for FFS, while the number of extranodal sites (#ENS), LN, sex, and degree of marrow involvement were important for cause-specific survival. We devised a tumor burden (TB) model, incorporating #ENS, LN, and degree of marrow involvement. Three groups were identified with statistically significant differences in cause-specific survival and FFS. Those with low TB (one ENS exclusive of extensive marrow and nodal disease less than 5 cm) had a 10-year cause-specific survival of 73% compared with 24% for patients with high TB (greater than or equal to two ENS and nodal disease greater than or equal to 5 cm) (P less than .001) and 40% for those with intermediate TB (either greater than or equal to 2 ENS, or extensive marrow only, or nodal disease greater than 5 cm) (P = .050). Patients with low TB had a 10-year FFS rate of 32%, while the intermediate and high TB groups had 10% and 9% FFS, respectively (P = .003). Because sex was a very strong prognostic variable, we created a risk model for survival and FFS based on TB and sex. Females with low TB had the best prognosis (92% survival and 50% FFS at 10 years) and males with high TB had the worst outlook (median survival and FFS, 43 and 12 months, respectively). Other TB-sex combinations defined two groups with statistically significant differences in survival but comparable FFS. This model should aid in the design and analysis of future trials.\r"

  ".W": "The Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) conducted a study in which patients with advanced chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) were randomized between a regimen consisting of chlorambucil (30 mg/m2 orally day 1) and prednisone (80 mg orally days 1 to 5) (C + P) administered every 2 weeks and a more intensive regimen of cyclosphosphamide (300 mg/m2 orally days 1 to 5), vincristine (1.4 mg/m2 intravenously [IV] day 1), and prednisone (100 mg/m2 orally days 1 to 5) (CVP) given every 3 weeks. Treatment was continued for up to 18 months to maximal response. Of the 122 eligible patients, 60 received C + P, while 62 received CVP. With a median follow-up of 7 years, there were no significant differences in survival (4.8 v 3.9 years, P = .12), complete remission (CR) rate (25% v 23%; P = .83), or duration of response (2.0 v 1.9 years; P = .78) between C + P and CVP. Toxicity was modest despite the prolonged treatment. The long median survival of 4.1 years for stage III and IV patients is superior to that usually reported. This could stem from continuing treatment to maximal response rather than an increase in intensity of therapy. These results are comparable to those reported with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (CHOP) therapy by other investigators. The data suggest that intermittent C + P administered to maximal response continues to be the standard treatment approach for advanced CLL.\r"

  ".W": "Recombinant interferon alfa (rIFN-alpha) was given to 31 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in first on-therapy marrow relapse as the sole treatment (30 megaunits/m2/d intravenously x 10 days) before standard four-drug reinduction and during multiagent continuation therapy (30 megaunits/m2 subcutaneously x 3 consecutive days every 3 weeks). After 10 days of rIFN-alpha, there were two partial remissions (PRs); seven additional patients had either greater than or equal to 25% reduction in the percentage of marrow blast cells or hypoplastic marrow. Two patients had progressive disease with an increase in leukocyte counts. All patients experienced influenza-like symptoms, and there were isolated instances of severe abdominal pain and personality change. Dose-limiting toxicity comprised grade III/IV transaminase elevation (two patients) and syncope with personality change (one patient). Twenty-three of 31 children (74%) subsequently achieved marrow remission using standard agents. One patient was taken off study during teniposide (VM-26) and cytarabine (ara-C) consolidation due to toxicity. Continuation therapy including rIFN-alpha pulse was well tolerated in the remaining children; only one patient required rIFN-alpha dosage reduction (for CNS toxicity). rIFN-alpha toxicity did not necessitate reductions in doses of standard chemotherapy agents or significant delays in therapy. Five patients remain in remission at 26+ to 36+ months; 13 patients relapsed in marrow, one in the meninges (7 months), and one in meninges, mediastinum, and lymph nodes (2 months). Two children were removed from study for marrow transplant. In summary, high-dose rIFN-alpha alone had a modest antileukemic effect. In contrast to the clinical experience with combined rIFN-alpha and chemotherapy in adults, rIFN-alpha given in a pulse-like manner throughout continuation therapy did not compromise the intensity of the standard chemotherapy regimen.\r"

A total of 29 patients were enrolled: high-grade astrocytoma (12), brainstem glioma (nine), and primitive neuroectadermal tumor (three), ependymoma (two), germ cell (two), and spinal cord astrocytoma (one). Betaseron was given by IV infusion over 30 minutes 3 times per week (Monday-Wednesday-Friday [MWF]). Four dose levels were studied, and at least three patients were entered at each dose level. The treatment plan began with a three-step dose escalation for each patient over 6 weeks (initiation phase). The dose-escalation schema for the four dose levels was: 50-100-200, 100-200-400, 200-300-500, and 300-400-600 x 10(6) (M) IU/m2. Patients experiencing an objective response or stable disease after 6 weeks entered the maintenance phase at the final escalated dose, ie, 200, 400, 500, or 600 mlU/m2 (MWF). Common transient effects included chills, fever, and fatigue. Dose-limiting toxicities were hematologic, hepatic, and CNS. The maintenance maximum-tolerable dose (MTD) was 500 mlU/m2, ie, dose level 3. Response was assessed at completion of the initiation phase and at 2-month intervals during the maintenance phase. Objective partial responses were seen in patients with high-grade astrocytoma (two) and brain-stem glioma (two). Thus, four of 21 (19%) assessable patients had partial responses for a median of 4 months. Eight patients had stable disease for a median of 5+ (2 to 14+) months. Antineoplastic activity has been identified in children with high-grade astrocytomas and brainstem gliomas in a dose-intensive regimen.\r"

To further evaluate the importance of identifying patients with POG stage C neuroblastoma and to assess the efficacy and toxicity of adding concurrent radiation therapy (RT) to chemotherapy (CT) in these children, a randomized study was conducted. Eligible patients received cyclophosphamide 150 mg/m2 orally days 1 to 7 and Adriamycin (doxorubicin; Adria Laboratories, Columbus, OH) 35 mg/m2 intravenously (IV) on day 8 (CYC/ADR) every 3 weeks for five courses with or without RT to primary tumor and regional lymph nodes (24 to 30 Gy/16 to 20 fractions). Second-look surgery was advised to evaluate response and to remove residual disease. Continuation therapy alternated CYC/ADR every 3 weeks with cisplatin 90 mg/m2 day 1 followed by teniposide 100 mg/m2 day 3 (CDP/VM) for two courses each. Secondary CT with CDP/VM alone was available for patients not achieving complete response (CR) following induction treatment and second-look surgery. Of 29 eligible patients randomized to CT alone, 13 achieved CR, and nine are disease-free (NED) 1 to 52 months (median, 35 months) off therapy. Twenty-two of 33 eligible cases treated with CT/RT attained CR, and 19 are NED 1 to 77 months (median, 23 months) off therapy. Local and metastatic relapses occurred in both arms. Differences in CR, event-free survival, and survival rates were significant, P = .013, .009, and .008, respectively. Surgical compliance was excellent and complications uncommon. Therapy was tolerable in both groups but hematopoietic toxicity was more common in the CT/RT arm. We conclude that POG stage C neuroblastoma in children older than 1 year of age is a higher-risk group that should be identified, that CT/RT provides superior initial and long-term disease control compared with CT alone in this patient subset, and that the occurrence of metastatic failures in both treatment groups suggests a need for more aggressive chemotherapy.\r"

These lesions tended to be greater than 5 cm in diameter at diagnosis, invaded the spinal extradural space, and were of the extraosseous Ewing's sarcoma or undifferentiated sarcoma subtype in 55% (30 of 56) of the cases. Patients with tumors in clinical groups II, III, and IV were treated with radiotherapy (XRT) and vincristine-dactinomycin (VA) or VA plus cyclophosphamide (VAC) +/- doxorubicin. Clinical group I patients treated on IRS-II did not receive XRT, while those on IRS-I were randomized to receive VAC +/- XRT. Forty-four of the paraspinal patients (79%) achieved a complete response (CR) compared with 77% (1,260 of 1,632) for patients with disease in other sites. Twenty-seven patients (55%) subsequently relapsed (five local, three regional, four local and distant, and 14 distant).

Paraspinal patients had somewhat poorer survival than patients with disease in other sites, both in IRS-I and IRS-II; the percentage of paraspinal patients surviving 5 years was 50% and 52% for IRS-I and IRS-II, respectively, whereas these percentages were 55% and 63% for patients with disease in other sites. Histology did not influence the CR rate, but unexpectedly, patients who had embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) had the poorest overall survival rate. We concluded that patients with paraspinal lesions may require extended-field radiation therapy to reduce the high local failure rate and more intensive chemotherapy to achieve better local and systemic tumor control.\r"

  ".W": "The combined use of zidovudine (ZDV) and interferon (IFN) alfa-2a has been shown to have antiretroviral and antitumor potential benefit in the treatment of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS)-associated Kaposi's sarcoma (KS). However, the clinical use of this combination is frequently complicated by the overlapping myelotoxicity of these agents. We report here the results of a phase I/II study in which granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) was used for those KS patients who became neutropenic while receiving ZDV (1,200 mg/d) and IFN (9 x 10(6) U/d). Nineteen of 29 patients (66%) developed an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of less than 1,000 cells per cubic millimeter and were begun on GM-CSF. All experienced a prompt increase in the ANC. Those patients receiving GM-CSF/ZDV/IFN alfa-2a had an improved end of study ANC when compared with the ZDV/IFN alfa-2a group, but did not have an increased rate of tumor response, end of study CD4 cell count, or improvement in any other hematologic variable. The use of GM-CSF was not associated with increased toxicity and, in particular, was not associated with a change in serum human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) p24 antigen. Tumor response was noted in 50% of the assessable patients (33% overall) despite \"high-risk\" characteristics in 80%. Of the responding patients, seven were on GM-CSF and might have otherwise required an alteration in ZDV/IFN alfa-2a dose level. Further study of GM-CSF as an alternate to dose modification of this (ZDV/IFN alfa-2a) and other combination therapies for AIDS patients is warranted.\r"

  ".W": "Seventy-five patients with advanced epithelial ovarian cancer were treated with a combined modality regimen of systemic, induction chemotherapy followed by intraperitoneal therapy (IPT). All patients underwent initial surgery for staging and/or cytoreduction followed by cisplatin 20 mg/m2 intravenously (IV) for 5 days and cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m2 on day 4 every 3 to 4 weeks for two to four cycles. Patients were then evaluated for IPT and, if eligible, had an intraperitoneal (IP) catheter placed. IPT consisted of cisplatin 60 mg/m2 in 2 L on day 1 and IV cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m2 on day 2 every 3 weeks for three to six cycles. Patients who demonstrated a clinical complete response (CCR) were then referred for second-look laparotomy (SLL). Of 71 patients who completed the induction phase, 53 (75%) were eligible for IPT, and 49 patients entered the therapy phase. Toxicity of the combined modality approach was acceptable and did not differ from our previous experience using the same drugs systemically. Thirty-two of the 49 patients who completed IPT achieved a CCR, which was confirmed by SLL in 20 patients. Twenty recurrences were documented in the 32 CCR patients, 13 occurred in patients after SLL. Projected median survival of all patients is 38 months. Median survival correlated with amount of residual disease following initial surgery (23 months for bulky v 45 months for minimal residual; P less than .001) and with performance status ([PS]; 24 months for PS 2, 3 v greater than 46 months for PS O; P less than .001). Patients who presented with bulky tumors were less likely to reach the consolidation IPT phase. Incorporation of IP cisplatin into the first-line regimen for treatment of ovarian cancer does not appear to have major impact on the survival of all treated patients when compared with our historical control series. Combined IV and IPT cisplatin and cyclophosphamide is feasible with acceptable toxicity. Its impact on response and survival may be limited to only \"good-prognosis\" patients.\r"

  ".W": "Between 1981 and 1986, 200 consecutive patients with metastatic nonseminomatous testicular cancer were entered into the Swedish Norwegian Testicular Cancer (SWENOTECA) project from 14 hospitals. The treatment plan was four chemotherapy cycles (cisplatin, vinblastine, and bleomycin) followed by surgical resection of residual tumor masses. After a median observation time of 75 months, the overall 5-year survival rate was 82%. In a univariate analysis, the following parameters influenced the prognosis significantly: the extent of the disease (Medical Research Council [MRC] grouping); the prechemotherapy levels of serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH); the patients' age; the presence of extrapulmonary hematogeneous metastases; and/or particularly large lymph node metastases. Patients fared better when more than 3 weeks elapsed between orchiectomy and start of chemotherapy as compared with those who were treated within this interval. The place of treatment (a large oncology unit v smaller units) also represented a significant prognostic factor for patients with large-volume (LV) and very-large-volume (VLV) disease combined. Multivariate analysis (Cox regression proportional hazards model) performed in all 193 assessable patients showed the following adverse prognostic factors: high-volume metastatic burden, age older than 35 years, prechemotherapy AFP greater than 500 micrograms/L and/or HCG greater than 1,000 U/L, and an interval between orchiectomy and start of chemotherapy of less than 3 weeks. The place of treatment also significantly influenced the final outcome. If patients with LV and VLV disease were combined, the presence of two of the following risk factors represented an additional prognostic factor: AFP greater than 1,000 micrograms/L, HCG greater than 10,000 U/L, liver metastases, brain metastases, bone metastases, retroperitoneal tumor greater than or equal to 10 cm, and mediastinal tumor greater than or equal to 5 cm.\r"

At least two questions should be asked to evaluate the benefits of this practice for patients: Do frequent routine surveillance tests detect recurrences \"earlier\" in asymptomatic patients? and Does earlier treatment of these recurrences reduce morbidity or prolong survival? The practical import of surveillance with imaging and laboratory tests for recurrence in patients with cancer of the breast and colon is discussed. Reported autopsy data, findings at elective reoperation, and clinical data have been examined to ascertain the justification for routine periodic tests in the treated but asymptomatic patient. It is concluded that earlier detection of a local recurrence or of metastatic disease through periodic tests in the asymptomatic patient with breast or colon cancer rarely alters the treatment or the outcome. A notable exception is regular screening mammography following treatment for adenocarcinoma of the breast.\r"

Sixty-five patients underwent resection with the intention of using IORT if areas at high risk for local recurrence were apparent at surgery. For 20 patients undergoing complete resection with IORT, the 5-year actuarial local control and disease-free survival (DFS) was 88% and 53%, respectively. The results for 22 patients with pathologically documented residual carcinoma were less satisfactory with a 5-year actuarial local control and DFS of 60% and 32%, respectively. In this latter group, local control and DFS correlated with the extent of residual disease: patients with only microscopic disease had a 5-year actuarial local control and DFS of 69% and 47%, respectively, whereas for patients with macroscopic disease, these figures were 50% and 17%, respectively. For 18 patients undergoing complete resection without IORT or additional postoperative radiation therapy, the 5-year actuarial local control and DFS was 67% and 53%, respectively. Because local failure will occur in at least 30% of patients undergoing partial resection with or without IORT as well as patients undergoing complete resection of advanced tumors without IORT, additional postoperative radiation therapy should be considered.\r"

Clinical complete responses (CRs) or partial responses (PRs) to chemotherapy were seen in 26 of 40 patients (65%). Three patients with primary-site disease unresponsive to chemotherapy underwent resection of the primary lesion and neck dissection followed by radiation therapy (RT). Thirty-seven patients were referred after chemotherapy for RT +/- neck dissection. Thirty-one of 40 patient (78%) were rendered disease-free (no evidence of disease [NED]). With a median follow-up of 49 months (range, 31 to 76), the overall actuarial survival rate for the group was 58% at 2 years and 33% at 5 years. The failure-free survival rate was 42% and 33% at 2 and 5 years, respectively. Seven patients refused recommended TL throughout their course. This may have adversely affected survival results. A greater proportion of patients who achieved a CR or PR to chemotherapy remained disease-free compared with those who achieved less than a PR (P less than .001). Sixteen patients relapsed, 10 with locoregional disease. Six patients underwent TL, either for initial induction failure or at relapse, for an actual larynx-preservation rate of 34 of 40 patients (85%). If the seven patients who refused TL are included, the anticipated preservation rate is 27 of 40 patients (68%). Larynx preservation with combined chemotherapy and radiation is feasible and effective in patients with advanced, resectable squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCHN). This treatment approach requires a motivated patient, careful patient monitoring, and close interdisciplinary cooperation among oncologists.\r"

Of 29 assessable patients, four (14%) responded to the treatment for 44, 51+, 72, and 91 weeks; 10 (34%) achieved stable disease (S); while 15 (52%) had progressive disease (P). The total response (responses plus S) rate was 48%, with a median time to progression (MTP) of 26 weeks in these patients; the MTP for all 29 patients was 11 weeks. The toxic effects were mainly hematologic, with thrombocytopenia and granulocytopenia being mild at 400 mg/m2 and 450 mg/m2 doses. NO neurotoxicity or renal toxicity was encountered. These results suggest that CBCDA given at 400 mg/m2 or 450 mg/m2 every 4 weeks is marginally active in patients with recurrent malignant gliomas. Since hematologic toxicity is mild, a higher dose could possibly be given, and may increase the response rate.\r"

In order to evaluate the benefit of a gram-positive prophylaxis after BMT, we conducted a prospective, randomized trial of systemic vancomycin among 60 patients undergoing BMT for hematologic malignancies. Patients were randomized to receive (n = 30) or not receive (n = 30) prophylactic vancomycin 15 mg/kg every 12 hours from day -2 until resolution of neutropenia or until the first episode of fever. All patients were treated in laminar air-flow rooms, received sterile diet, total gut decontamination, and had central venous catheters placed surgically. Vancomycin was found to be highly effective in preventing gram-positive infections that occurred in 11 of 30 patients in the control group versus zero of 30 in the vancomycin group (P less than .002). All gram-positive infections occurring in the control group were symptomatic (nine septicemia and two local infections), and one patient with Streptococcus septicemia died with pneumonia. Thus, gram-positive prophylaxis was found to decrease infection morbidity after BMT. Moreover, the number of days with fever (P less than .001), and empiric antibiotic therapy (P less than .01) was reduced without added toxicity or cost. This study confirmed the high prevalence of gram-positive infections after BMT and emphasized the clinical benefits of an adapted prophylaxis.\r"

  ".W": "Although doxorubicin is one of the most commonly used antineoplastics, no studies to date have clearly related the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) to toxicity or response. The limited sampling model has recently been shown to be a feasible method for estimating the AUC to facilitate pharmacodynamic studies. Data from two previous studies of doxorubicin pharmacokinetics were used, including 26 patients with sarcoma and five patients with breast cancer or unknown primary. The former were divided into a training data set of 15 patients and a test datum set of 11 patients, and the latter patients formed a second test data set. The model was developed by stepwise multiple regression on the training data set: AUC (nanogram hour per milliliter) = 17.39 C2 + 163 C48-111.0 [dose/(50 mg/m2)], where C2 and C48 are the concentrations at 2 and 48 hours after bolus dose. The model was subsequently validated on both test data sets: first test data set--mean predictive error (MPE), 4.7%; root mean square error (RMSE), 12.4%; second test data set--MPE, 4.5%, RMSE, 9.2%. An additional model was also generated using a simulated time point to estimate the total AUC for a daily x 3-day schedule: AUC (nanogram hour per milliliter) = 44.79 C2 + 175.65 C48 + 47.25 [dose/(25 mg/m2/d)], where the C48 is obtained just prior to the third dose. We conclude that the AUC of doxorubicin after bolus administration can be adequately estimated from two timed plasma concentrations.\r"

Molecular genetic research has implicated loss of a tumor suppressor gene on the short arm of chromosome 11 as one of the pathways responsible for the development of the neoplasm. Preconception maternal (hair dyes) and paternal (occupation) exposures to environmental agents have been the subject of epidemiologic studies of possible risk factors. Histopathologic analyses have identified several different and less common tumor types among those previously aggregated under the WT rubric. WT itself has been subdivided into the so-called favorable histology (FH) and anaplastic forms, the prognosis being worse for the latter. Clinical research has standardized management by surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy (RT) and furthered the identification of risk factors. Patients can now be stratified according to tumor type and stage, and the intensity of treatment modulated accordingly; eg, RT at low doses is used in only 25% of National Wilms' Tumor Study (NWTS) patients without distant metastases. Before the NWTS, it had been given to almost all and at higher doses. Chemotherapy, whether given pre- or postoperatively, is based on dactinomycin and vincristine with Adriamycin [( ADR] doxorubicin; Adria Laboratories, Columbus, OH) added for high-risk patients. The currently used NWTS combined modality therapy for WT patients has dramatically improved survival rates; 95% now are alive 2 years after treatment. Remaining questions are the identification of the late effects of the treatments used and the further refinement of therapy to reduce iatrogenic complications to a minimum.\r"

Seropositivity for HTLV-I/II and HIV-1 was detected by whole-virus enzyme immunoassay, with Western blot confirmation. Of 1,800 subjects recruited from methadone maintenance and detoxification clinics, 207 (11.5%) were infected with HTLV-I/II. Seropositivity for HTLV-I/II varied by racial group, age, sex, and geographic location. Blacks had a higher (age- and location-adjusted) infection rate (17.1%) than Hispanics (8.7%) or whites (5.6%), and seropositivity showed a strong gradient with increasing age. Females had a slightly higher rate (14.0%) than males (10.0%), after adjustment for age and location. Among the seven locations, the rate varied from approximately 1% (Miami and Baltimore) to 20% (Los Angeles), although the former rates were based on relatively few subjects (47 and 65, respectively). Overall, the occurrence of coinfection by HIV-1 and HTLV-I/II did not occur more frequently than expected by chance.\r"

In the primary infertile women the age-adjusted prevalence rate of HIV-1 was significantly higher than in the fertile women (9.3% versus 0.7%) and in secondary infertile women (9.3% versus 2.1%). There was no difference in sero-prevalence of HTLV-1 among women with different fertility statuses, but a steady increase with age was seen. Concomitant infection with HTLV-1 and HIV-1 was observed in two women. In Gabon primary infertile women could be considered a risk group for HIV-1 infection.\r"

In this paper, we report the results of a national study in Italy on hospital stay for cohorts of patients hospitalized for the first time with HIV-related illnesses during the years 1984-86 and 1987-88. Using the Kaplan-Meier survival methods, we demonstrate a substantial decrease in the proportion of time spent in the hospital by patients newly diagnosed with AIDS (from 49% to 25%) in the latter study period. Treatment with zidovudine (ZDV), estimated only for 1988, emphasizes this trend even more. A reduction in hospital use also occurred for AIDS-related complex (ARC) and persistent general lymphadenopathy (PGL) patients. Possible reasons for this decrease in proportion of time spent in the hospital include longer life span of patients and expansion of outpatient care, as has already been reported in the United States.\r"

Neither compound prevented the infection despite dosing prior to virus inoculation. FLT was about ten times more potent than ZDV in delaying the appearance of SIVSM antigen in the monkeys. The serum half-life of FLT was longer than that of ZDV and ZDV was bound to plasma proteins to about 60% while FLT was virtually unbound. It is proposed that the in vivo difference in potency between ZDV and FLT could, at least partly, be explained as the combined effects of a longer plasma half-life and a higher free concentration of FLT and possibly a higher intracellular concentration of the triphosphate of FLT.\r"

This strain of mice develops FV-specific neutralizing antibodies that aid in reducing viremia and splenic virus titers but do not prevent splenomegaly and eventual FV-associated death. The virally exposed mice treated with ZDV did not develop splenomegaly or have detectable viremia after the last drug treatment. On day 21, a single animal had demonstrable virus in the spleen as determined by a focal immunoenzyme assay; 57% had detectable virus at 5 weeks, but non displayed splenic virus after 35 weeks. None of the animals died after the 35-week holding period, compared to 38% dying in placebo-treated mice. To detect low levels of the virus, or potentially latent virus, splenocytes were cocultivated with a cell line known to readily propagate FV, and the cells were subsequently passaged four times to amplify replication of the virus. After amplification, a significant increase was seen in the number of mice testing positive for virus. Thus, ZDV treatment initiated early after virus exposure was effective in preventing FV-induced splenomegaly and death, but did not prevent low levels of persistent retrovirus in the mice.\r"

Federal regulations are sufficiently flexible to allow demonstration of safety and efficacy of an investigational drug for this indication. The necessary element is that both safety and efficacy be demonstrated in an objective and reliable manner.\r"

Since MK tends to disseminate in immunocompromised patients, one might, therefore, expect to observe an increasing number of MK infections associated with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1). A systematic 60-month review of clinical, microbiologic, and radiographic data associated with MK was performed from two major referral centers in New Orleans. From June 30, 1983 through June 30, 1988, MK was isolated from 72 patients. Twenty-three of the 72 (31.9%) were found to be coinfected with HIV-1. Over the 5-year study period, the phenomenon of dual infection increased from 0 to 50%. Six cases of extrapulmonary infection were found among the HIV-1 patients as compared to 1 in 49 non-HIV patients (p = 0.003, Fisher's exact test). In addition, patients with dual infection had atypical chest radiographs, usually with interstitial infiltrates without cavitation. Most of these patients died within 12 months (90.9%). When treatment was administered at all, often it varied considerably from patient to patient despite the well-known in vitro efficacy of certain widely available anti-mycobacterial agents.\r"

The erythromycin and sulfisoxazole ratio of 1:3 was the most effective of several dose combinations tested. The established safety record from three decades of clinical use of this drug combination plus the broad spectrum of coverage for other causes of diffuse pneumonitis such as Chlamydia, Mycoplasma, and Legionella warrant further study of erythromycin-sulfisoxazole in AIDS patients.\r"

We identified 7 cases (2.0%) of needle biopsy associated tumor tracking, 3 in which the only tumor penetration in the gland was limited to the needle track. The maximal soft tissue extension from the biopsy site ranged from 0.1 to 1.2 cm. and approached the nearest soft tissue margin to within 0.5 mm. in 4 cases. In contrast to prior reports showing clinically evident tracking only with transperineal biopsies from high grade tumors, 6 of our 7 cases were of intermediate grade (in the glandular and tracking components) and 6 had transrectal biopsies. Needle biopsy associated tumor tracking occurred with core (14 gauge) and biopsy gun needles (18 gauge). An additional 13 cases (3.7%) showed some features of needle biopsy associated tumor tracking but they were equivocal. These findings have significant implications in light of recent proposals advocating serial mapping of prostate cancer using the biopsy gun with potential conservative observation of smaller tumors.\r"

Of these patients 11 died as neonates or infants, and autopsy in 9 revealed 6 cases of diffuse and severe renal dysplasia. In the 10 surviving patients renal insufficiency developed and a total of 13 nephrectomies and renal biopsies were performed. Renal dysplasia was noted in 9 specimens, but unlike the infant kidneys, the dysplastic changes involved less than 25% of the parenchyma in most cases. Renal failure in these 10 patients was caused by pyelonephritis and obstruction. In our estimation perinatal renal failure in patients with the prune belly syndrome results from renal dysplasia caused by an in utero insult, while in older patients pyelonephritis and obstruction are the causes. Careful treatment of reflux, obstruction and urinary tract infections may decrease the incidence of renal failure in patients with the prune belly syndrome who survive infancy.\r"

The bladder specimens of myelomeningocele stillborn fetuses showed a marked paucity of muscle bundles as well as a significantly diminished size of the muscle bundles. The myelomeningocele bladder specimens obtained from patients undergoing autopsy and those undergoing augmentation cystoplasty revealed significant interfascicular and pericellular infiltration of the smooth muscle by dense connective tissue. Quantitative morphometric analysis showed that the myelomeningocele stillborn fetuses have a significant increase in the volumetric content of connective tissue compared to control stillborn fetuses. The bladders of myelomeningocele patients who underwent autopsy or augmentation cystoplasty had a 3-fold increase in connective tissue when compared to normal controls. These findings reveal that structural changes in the histological components of the myelodysplastic bladder can be demonstrated not only in patients of varying ages undergoing autopsy or augmentation cystoplasty but also in the developing fetus. These findings enhance our understanding of the relationship of connective tissue proliferation to smooth muscle in the myelodysplastic bladder. We discuss the relationship of these findings to pathological detrusor morphology and detrusor dysfunction.\r"

Initial treatment should be directed toward decompression of the involved organ systems and definitive reconstruction should be deferred until the child is older, at which time the emphasis should be upon a simultaneous multisystem repair performed, whenever possible, in 1 stage.\r"

The microscopic distribution of photosensitizer fluorescence in the bladder wall was studied by laser fluorescence microscopy. Prior to PDT the bladder capacity and compliance were assessed by filling cystometry. Intravesical red light (675 nm.) from a copper vapour pumped dye laser was used to activate the photosensitizer using light doses of 20 to 200 J/cm2. Urodynamic and histologic changes were studied at intervals for up to three months. The fluorescence studies showed that AlSPc was eliminated from the deeper muscle layers more quickly than from the superficial layers of the bladder wall so that by 24 hours there was four times as much fluorescence from the mucosa and lamina propria compared to the deeper muscle. Control bladders illuminated with laser light alone showed no effects at these light doses. Animals treated 24 hours after sensitization showed a reduction in bladder capacity of up to 78% (20 J/cm2. light and 1.5 mg./kg.AlSPc). An initial reduction in compliance recovered in two weeks after low doses (0.5 mg./kg.) of AlSPc but was still abnormal at three months after higher doses (1.5 mg./kg.); though there was no long term histologic abnormality seen. Aluminium sulfonated phthalocyanine is a promising photosensitizer for bladder photodynamic therapy and using low doses of the drug it is possible to produce a superficial necrosis without muscle damage across a range of light doses. This heals by epithelial regeneration with no long term functional impairment. Direct absorption of this photosensitizer following intravesical administration seems unreliable.\r"

Four types of urophonograms were demonstrated according to the shape and characteristics. Types 1, 2, 3 and 4 were characterized by a diamond shape, irregular occurrences of sound spikes, the mixture of Types 1 and 2 and no remarkable sound spikes respectively. Types 1, 2, and 3 were found in BPH, while Type 4 was demonstrated in normal healthy male volunteers. After prostatectomy a high percentage of Type 4 was demonstrated. The frequency (Hz) of these sounds was around 650. Diamond shape sound showed higher value of power gain (dB) than irregular type sound. The wave length was around 0.50 (m). Comparison of urophonographic studies with conventional uroflowmetric investigation was undertaken. Urophonography was useful for investigations of dysfunctional voiding and lower urinary tract obstruction.\r"

  ".W": "PSK, a protein-bound polysaccharide Kureha, was tested for its ability to modulate the cytotoxicity of lymphocytes that act on autologous tumor cells and T24 human urinary bladder tumor cells in urinary bladder cancer patients in a 6-h 51Cr release assay. In vitro treatment of peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) with PSK for 18 hours resulted in an augmentation or induction of cytotoxicity against relatively resistant T24 cells in previously reactive and nonreactive cases, respectively. The PSK-treated PBL were able to kill more effectively tumor cells that were freshly isolated from the same cancer patients than non-treated PBL. The effects of PSK were noted with PBL as well as tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) and with PSK at concentrations of 10 to 100 micrograms./ml., while PSK at higher doses reduced their lytic activities. The addition of PSK to the assay at the same concentrations also enhanced the cytotoxicities. Autologous tumor killing (ATK) activities of both large granular lymphocytes (LGL) and T lymphocytes were enhanced by PSK. Treatment of PBL with PSK did not effect on the proportion of PBL binding to the tumor cells, while it augmented the cytotoxic activity. Cell-free supernatant of PSK-stimulated lymphocyte culture did not contain any detectable amounts of interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha), interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and interleukin-2 (IL-2). In addition, anti-IFN-alpha monoclonal antibody (MAb), anti-IFN-gamma MAb and anti-IL-2 MAb did not inhibit PSK-induced augmentation of cytotoxicity against T24. Oral administration of PSK (three gm./day) to patients with urinary bladder cancer daily for seven days before operation resulted in an augmentation of the cytotoxicity against T24 cells in five out of 10 patients and no change of the cytotoxicity in the other five patients. ATK activity was also enhanced by oral administration of PSK in three out of five patients. These results indicate that the antitumor activity of PSK may be in part mediated through activation of tumor killing system independent of IFN-alpha, IFN-gamma and IL-2.\r"

Based on these studies magnesium was claimed to be beneficial for calcium oxalate stone patients. However, hypomagnesuria is not a common phenomenon. To better understand the role of magnesium as an inhibitor of calcium oxalate crystallization in urine, we studied the effect of magnesium on calcium oxalate urolithiasis in rats on a regular diet and a hyperoxaluric protocol. Excess magnesium was administered to male rats on regular diet and a lithogenic protocol. Magnesium administration to hyperoxaluric rats did not result in significant changes in urinary excretion of calcium or oxalate or in calcium oxalate relative supersaturation. Urinary excretion of citrate was also not significantly altered. Some animals from both groups, those on magnesium therapy and those not on magnesium therapy had crystals deposited in their renal tubules. We conclude that excess magnesium has no significant effect on calcium oxalate urolithiasis in normomagnesuric conditions.\r"

It was determined that in the doses used, 4-MAPC failed to prevent testicular descent. Because 4-MAPC inhibited ventral prostate weight by only 53% (as compared to a 75% inhibition by castration), the failure of the 4-MAPC to prevent testicular descent could be due to its inability to completely inhibit tissue 5-alpha reductase activity. The results of this study do not mitigate against the role of other nonhormonal factors working in tandem with DHT in the induction of testicular descent in this animal model.\r"

We compared rats treated with placebo alone, sham operated rats, rats rendered surgically impotent and castrated rats with and without testosterone. Rats did not respond to placebo. The sham operated rats remained normal in all measured respects (2.66 erections/rat/30 minutes). Surgically impotent rats yawned normally but had no erections.

It was determined that while treatment with WIN inhibited the weights of the ventral prostate, seminal vesicles and penis when compared to those seen in castrate animals, the drug only caused a 19% (3/16) inhibition in the descent of the testes when compared to the control group (0/16; p = 0.112).

This action results in liquefaction of the coagulum. PSA is also present in the serum and can be measured reliably by either a monoclonal immunoradiometric assay or a polyclonal radioimmunoassay. The calculated half-life of serum PSA ranges from 2.2 to 3.2 days and the metabolic clearance rate of this tumor marker follows first-order kinetics. Digital rectal examination, cystoscopic examination and prostate biopsy all can cause spurious elevations of the serum PSA concentration. Conditions such as bacterial prostatitis and acute urinary retention also can falsely elevate the serum PSA level. Because approximately 25% of the patients with BPH only will have an elevated serum PSA concentration and BPH tissue contributes to this PSA value in a variable manner from patient to patient, it is unlikely that PSA by itself will become an effective screening tool for the early diagnosis of prostate cancer. However, if combined with digital rectal examination and/or transrectal ultrasound it may become a vital part of any early detection program. Prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia also may be associated with moderately elevated serum PSA levels. Although there is a direct correlation between the serum PSA concentration and clinical stage, PSA is not sufficiently reliable to determine the clinical stage on an individual basis. This finding also applies to pathological stage. As a result, the preoperative serum PSA concentration cannot be used to decide whether to recommend radical prostatectomy for potential cure. Low preoperative serum PSA concentrations in patients with previously untreated prostate cancers are predictive of a negative bone scan. Thus, in these select patients a staging bone scintigram may not be necessary. With respect to monitoring patients after definitive therapy, PSA is an exquisitely sensitive tumor marker. Irrespective of the treatment modality (radical prostatectomy, radiation therapy or antiandrogen treatment), PSA reflects accurately the tumor status of the patient and is prognostic of eventual outcome; this tumor marker is capable of predicting tumor recurrence months before its detection by any other method. PSA is also a most useful immunocytochemical marker. Its sensitivity and specificity to identify tissue of prostatic origin approach 100%. When compared to PAP, PSA is a more precise and meaningful marker in all clinical situations.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Salvage was successful in 88.7% of the kidneys explored and total nephrectomy was required in 11.3%. The success rate was based on early vascular control and reconstructive techniques of \"renorrhaphy,\" partial nephrectomy, vascular repair and coverage with omental pedicle flaps. Complications occurred in 9.9% of the cases but none resulted in renal loss.

Viable tumor comprised less than 1% of each surgical specimen. Our results support the view that initial treatment with interleukin-2 immunotherapy, followed by abdominal cytoreductive surgery if the peripheral metastases have regressed, may be preferable to the practice of performing abdominal cytoreductive surgery before administering interleukin-2 immunotherapy for patients with widely metastatic renal cell carcinoma.\r"

Metabolic acidosis, hypocitraturia and increased incidence of nephrolithiasis were induced by both drugs. However, the acidosis was milder with methazolamide administration. Normocalciuria was observed in 29 patients and was shown to be a result of low filtered calcium. Renal hypercalciuria in 16 patients was associated with elevated parathyroid hormone but nephrogenic cyclic adenosine monophosphate remained within normal limits. Citrate in the form of potassium citrate (4.3 mmol.) and sodium citrate (4.0 mmol.) did not correct the metabolic acidosis or hypocitraturia but consistently decreased fasting and 24-hour urinary calcium excretion in patients with renal hypercalciuria. This event did not occur in patients with normocalciuria or absorptive hypercalciuria. These results suggest that a small amount of citrate could reverse renal hypercalciuria without correcting the metabolic acidosis.\r"

The data in this series demonstrate that a miniaturized ureteroscopic system is of paramount importance in laser lithotripsy, allowing access into the ureter without dilation in the majority of patients (165 of 204). Lack of dilation is associated with a decrease in pain and postoperative hospitalization. Satisfactory stone fragmentation was accomplished in 198 of 204 procedures in this series with use of the laser alone. A low complication rate was observed. Endoscopic laser lithotripsy is a safe, reliable and cost-effective method of therapy for ureteral calculi in a community hospital setting.\r"

  ".W": "In an attempt to understand better the status of renal function after Kock pouch urinary diversion we conducted a prospective evaluation of renal function in 25 patients using the radionuclide 131iodine-hippurate. Studies were done before, and at 1 month and every 6 months for 30 months postoperatively. The radionuclide results were then compared to excretory urography and contrast study of the reservoir. Our renal function study included the determination of individual and total effective renal plasma flow (ml. per minute), the time to maximal radioactivity over the kidney (peak time in minutes) and a renogram. The mean total (both kidneys) effective renal plasma flow rates before (25 patients) and at month 1 (19), month 6 (14), month 12 (12), month 18 (6), month 24 (6) and month 30 (7) after operation were 385.5 +/- 112.2, 310.5 +/- 109.9, 362.7 +/- 69.2, 442.0 +/- 97.5, 468.2 +/- 82.5, 405.7 +/- 70.6 and 414.0 +/- 65.1, respectively. A comparison of individual and total effective renal plasma flow before and after operation revealed that only the change of the flow at each or both sides of the kidney before and at 1 month after the operation reached statistically significant differences, respectively (p less than 0.05, paired t test). Postoperatively 5 of 6 patients with hydronephrosis had abnormal peak time and a third segment on the renogram was performed on the corresponding side of the kidney. No reflux was noted on contrast study of the reservoir of any patient followed for up to 30 months. In conclusion, the radionuclide renal function evaluation showed a significant decrease of renal function 1 month after Kock pouch diversion, then it resumed and remained stable (neither improved nor deteriorated) for 30 months. Also the abnormal peak time and third segment on the renogram usually implicated a dilated upper urinary tract.\r"

Grade 1 tumors showed 33.3% aneuploidy with a mean bromodeoxyuridine positive stained ratio (labeling index) of 5.1 +/- 3.4%. Grade 2 tumors featured 51.7% aneuploidy with a mean labeling index of 8.9 +/- 7.7%. On the other hand, a markedly increased labeling index of 15.2 +/- 8.2% with aneuploidy was observed in all but 1 grade 3 tumors. When DNA ploidy and labeling indexes were compared according to the presence or absence of muscular invasion of tumors, all 16 muscle invasive tumors showed aneuploidy (mean labeling index 18.7 +/- 8.0%), while 17 of 40 nonmuscle invasive tumors showed aneuploidy (mean labeling index 8.6 +/- 5.4%). This labeling index difference was statistically significant (p less than 0.01).

The intermediate World Health Organization (WHO) grade II tumors were divided into supposedly benign and malignant forms of grades IIa and IIb, respectively. The 5-year survival was 92% for patients with grade IIa urothelial carcinoma, compared to 43% for patients with grade IIb tumors. The corresponding figures for grades I and III tumors were 100 and 44%, respectively. When excluding carcinoma in situ (5-year survival 50%) no patient with a noninvasive tumor (stage Ta) died of bladder carcinoma within 5 years, compared to 50% of those with invasive cancers (stages T1 to T4). We propose a new grading system in which grades I and IIa are embraced as grade A, grades IIb and III as grade B, and grade IV as grade C. The 5-year survival rate in the 3 grades was 94, 44 and 27%, respectively. Grade A seems to represent a type of tumor with universally favorable prognosis, in contrast to grades B and C. This offers practical advantages, since the former can be treated conservatively, whereas the latter need more urgent radical intervention, especially in patients in whom invasive growth is recorded.\r"

Step-section planimetry, previously assumed to be the most accurate means of volume measurement, exhibited a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.93. The elliptical volume, widely used as an alternative to planimetry, demonstrated a correlation coefficient of 0.90. The most accurate method to estimate prostate weight (r = 0.94) was a variation of the prolate spheroid formula, expressed as pi/6 (transverse dimension)2 (anteroposterior dimension). When different volume ranges were considered, this prolate spheroid formula provided the closest estimate of weight in glands of less than 40 gm. and those in the 40 to 80 gm. range. The most accurate method to estimate prostates weighing greater than 80 gm. was the formula pi/6 (transverse dimension)3.\r"

This operation can be performed on an outpatient basis and is extremely well tolerated by the patient. The results of the first 12 consecutive cases indicate that, with experience, the procedure can be performed within a reasonable time limit (90 to 205 minutes) and that the number of lymph nodes removed (right and left obturator fossae mean 7.6 and 7.1, respectively) is adequate.

  ".W": "Among 335 radical retropubic prostatectomies an antegrade dissection was used in 30 because of difficulty in developing the usual planes of dissection during apical dissection. The adequacy of tumor resection, preservation of sexual potency and urinary continence were compared in patients who underwent the antegrade dissection and those who underwent the standard retrograde nerve-sparing radical retropubic prostatectomy. Histopathological evaluation revealed no significant difference in the over-all completeness of tumor excision between the group having an antegrade dissection (16 of 30, 53% completely excised) and those having a retrograde dissection (177 of 305, 58% completely excised) (p = 0.62). Patients with clinically localized but pathological stage C disease undergoing an antegrade dissection and a nerve-sparing procedure had a significantly higher incidence of positive lateral margins (9 of 12, 75%) than the comparable group undergoing a retrograde dissection (40 of 99, 40%) (p = 0.02). The incidence of positive apical margins was similar in both groups, with 5 of 14 (36%) of the antegrade stage C cases (36%) having positive apical margins compared to 37 of 117 of the retrograde stage C cases (32%) (p = 0.65). Sexual potency was preserved in 5 of 6 patients (83%) treated with an antegrade dissection who had both neurovascular bundles preserved and were followed for at least 6 months, compared to 86 of 142 (61%) who underwent retrograde dissection (difference not significant, p = 0.26). Potency was preserved in 6 of 13 evaluable patients (46%) undergoing unilateral antegrade nerve-sparing procedure compared to 21 of 48 evaluable patients (44%) undergoing unilateral retrograde nerve-sparing procedure (p = 0.88). Of 22 patients followed for 1 year 21 (95%) have regained urinary continence. We conclude that the antegrade approach to radical retropubic prostatectomy provides results that are comparable to those achieved with the standard retrograde approach but that when an antegrade approach is chosen because of periprostatic fibrosis, bilateral preservation of the neurovascular bundles may result in a higher incidence of positive surgical margins.\r"

  ".W": "The influence of preservation or excision of the neurovascular bundles on return of sexual function is analyzed. Between 1982 and 1988, 600 men 34 to 72 years old underwent radical retropubic prostatectomy for prostate cancer. Of the 503 patients who were potent preoperatively and followed for a minimum of 18 months 342 (68%) are potent postoperatively. Three factors were identified that correlated with the return of sexual function: 1) age, 2) clinical and pathological stage, and 3) surgical technique (preservation or excision of the neurovascular bundle). In men less than 50 years old potency was similar in patients who had both neurovascular bundles preserved (90%) and patients who had 1 neurovascular bundle widely excised (91%). With advancing age of more than 50 years sexual function was better in patients in whom both neurovascular bundles were preserved than in patients in whom 1 neurovascular bundle was excised (p less than 0.05). When the relative risk of postoperative impotence was adjusted for age the risk of postoperative impotence was 2-fold greater if there was capsular penetration or seminal vesicle invasion, or if 1 neurovascular bundle was excised (p less than 0.05). These data indicate that the return of sexual function postoperatively in men more than 50 years old is quantitatively related to preservation of autonomic innervation. In these men when it is necessary to excise the neurovascular bundle on 1 side, consideration in the future should be given to approaches that may restore autonomic function through nerve regeneration, for example partial excision of the bundle or cavernous nerve grafts.\r"

When compared with US white men from the general population, both USC and LLU graduates had below expected deaths for all causes (USC, standardized mortality ratio [SMR] = 76; LLU, SMR = 56), although deaths due to cerebrovascular disease, airplane accidents, and suicides were elevated for USC (SMRs = 132, 360, and 218, respectively). The LLU graduates had a risk similar to that of the USC graduates for fatal cancer, with a mortality ratio (MR) of 0.92 (95% confidence interval, 0.67 to 1.26); but half the risk of fatal atherosclerotic disease, with MRs of 0.58 (0.46 to 0.73) and 0.66 (0.43 to 0.99) for coronary and cerebrovascular disease, respectively; and three times the risk of fatal airplane accidents. The overall mortality rate of LLU physicians was only 75% as high as that of the USC physicians and only 56% as high as that of the US male population at large. We attribute this reduced mortality mainly to the low cardiovascular mortality rates, which may be accounted for by the life-style of the substantial proportion of Seventh-day Adventists among LLU graduates.\r"

Family consent for intubation was requested following 44 (80%) of the 55 deaths that occurred during the 10-month study period. Of these requests, 32 (73%) were granted. Proportionately more white than black families consented and consent was positively related to autopsy permission. Fifty-three (75%) of 71 trainees completed a mailed questionnaire after their first intubation experience. Although each respondent found the experience helpful, many reported mixed feelings categorized as doubt about participating, apprehension and discomfort, respect for the body, appreciation for the opportunity, a sense of achievement, and feelings of comfort knowing that consent had been obtained. These findings confirm our initial hypothesis and suggest that (1) newly dead infants can be a valuable resource for teaching intubation skills, and (2) others considering a similar approach need to be aware of and sensitive to trainees' feelings.\r"

Ninety-three central venous catheters and 85 arterial catheters were studied in the surgical intensive care unit. Study catheters were pretreated with the cationic surfactant tridodecylmethylammonium chloride. The anionic antibiotic, cefazolin, was bonded before insertion of the catheters by immersing them in a 50-mg/mL solution. Fourteen percent of the 81 catheters in the control group were infected, compared with 2% of the 97 antibiotic-bonded catheters. Staphylococcus epidermidis was the most common organism obtained. There was no significant difference in the number of colonized or clinically inflamed catheter insertion sites. None of the 100 antibiotic immersion solutions yielded anything on microbiologic culture. We conclude that antibiotic bonding is an efficient, safe, and cost-effective method of reducing intravascular catheter infection in patients who are in intensive care units.\r"

Alternative curriculum students did not differ significantly from their traditional curriculum classmates on National Board of Medical Examiners, Part I and Part II total scores, although their subset scores on Part I did tend to be lower, reaching significance in one subset area. Differences in performance favoring the traditional curriculum were primarily seen in the early years of the program.

In contrast to inpatient nosocomial infections, infections transmitted in outpatient settings are neither systematically monitored nor likely to be detected by routine qi surveillance. To better define the spectrum of such events, we reviewed the literature to identify cases and clusters of infections associated with outpatient health care. In this review, we identified and epidemiologically characterized 53 such reports that occurred from 1961 through 1990. Transmission occurred in general medical offices, clinics, and emergency departments (23); ophthalmologists' offices and clinics (11); dental offices (13); and alternative-care settings (six). Our findings suggest that inpatient infection-control practices should be extended to outpatient health care settings by assigning specific responsibility for infection control and by adapting surveillance methods and prevention measures.\r"

Doppler \"color flow\" imaging promises to expand these applications. In many instances, duplex Doppler technology has replaced more invasive angiographic procedures for evaluation of suspected vascular abnormalities. Improved ultrasound duplex technology, combined with the relatively inexpensive, rapid, noninvasive aspects of ultrasonography has made it a valuable screening examination for suspected flow abnormalities.\r"

Alcohol use prevalences fit closely to a logistic curve used to model an epidemic process that assumed adolescents have random contacts with one another each year. An \"adequate contact\" will convert a nondrinker to drinking status if he/she is contacted; drinkers average .48 adequate contacts per year. Smoking prevalences were fit assuming both that the entire population was \"at risk\" and that some individuals were \"immune\": the mean contact parameter was .28 for smoking if no immune class was assumed and .77 if an immune class was assumed. Extensions of these epidemic process models could include individual differences in contact rates and transitions among several smoking or drinking statuses (e.g., non-user, experimenter, regular user and recovered user).\r"

The present study examined chemical usage and social-civil-productive functioning in 157 male and female chemically dependent adolescents at 6, 12 and 24 months after leaving an AA/NA-based treatment program. Results revealed that both treatment completers and noncompleters (those who left treatment prematurely against professional/medical advice) demonstrated less chemical use after their respective hospitalizations than before. Although significantly higher percentages of both male and female treatment completers were found abstinent/essentially abstinent at 6 months post discharge in contrast to noncompleters, abstinence rates, particularly for male subjects, declined sharply by 1 and 2 years after treatment. Results indicated that the AA/NA model is a promising approach in treating chemically dependent adolescents, but that much attention to relapse prevention methods is necessary.\r"

The total sample (N = 239) included 114 adult children of alcoholics and 125 sociodemographically comparable adults from nonalcoholic family environments. The sample was further divided into young- and middle-adult age groups and men and women. All respondents completed a self-report instrument that included standardized measures of psychological well-being, emotional distress, personality characteristics and psychological development. Results indicated that adult children of alcoholics did not differ from the comparison group on the majority of measures that assessed multiple aspects of psychological well-being and personality development. However, adult children of alcoholics scored significantly higher on the measures of anxiety and depression than did adults from nonalcoholic families. Few gender differences were obtained in the overall pattern of results. The findings are discussed in light of the generally negative clinical descriptions of adult children of alcoholics and the need to implement future research that will explain the apparent variability in the psychological functioning of adult children of alcoholics.\r"

  ".W": "Female DUI offenders who participated in a controlled, random assignment DUI intervention study, the Mississippi DUI Probation Follow-Up Project, were compared to their male counterparts on demographic, drinker status and recidivism variables. In comparison to men, women in the project were less likely to be married, more likely to be between 30 and 50 years of age, less likely to have less than a 9th grade education, less likely to be screened as a high-problem-risk drinker, less likely to have prior DUI and public drunkenness arrests and less likely to recidivate. The effects of short-term rehabilitation, 1 year's probation and administration of the Life Activities Inventory-Current Status Questionnaire (LAI-CSQ) on the long-term recidivism rates of women were examined. The analysis for screened low-problem-risk women was inconclusive due to lack of statistical power. However, the repeated administration of the LAI-CSQ was detrimental for screened high-problem-risk women and tended to be detrimental for women with fewer than 12 years of education. Implications for intervening with female DUIs are discussed.\r"

Four studies investigated agreement between subject and collateral questionnaire reports of drinking by adults over age 60 years (N = 83), and three of these studies also assessed agreement between daily subject and collateral prospective reports of subject drinking over 4 (Study 2) or 12 (Studies 3 and 4) week intervals. Subject and collateral questionnaire reports were significantly correlated. Excellent agreement was found for the group of subjects for self-monitoring reports of the number of drinking days and quantity of alcohol consumption per day, including reports of the temporal patterning of consumption, but variability in agreement existed across subject-collateral pairs. The discussion focuses on the conditions conductive to accurate measurement and on the importance of investigating predictor variables of individual differences in the accuracy of verbal reports of alcohol consumption.\r"

  ".W": "To assess the usefulness of medical examiner data in describing the relationship between alcohol use and fatal injuries, 1978-84 data from the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner (ME), State of Oklahoma, was examined. In each year in the study period, approximately 1,500 deaths resulted from unintentional injuries (UI) and 800 deaths resulted from intentional injuries (i.e., suicides and homicides). For persons who died on the same day they were injured, testing for blood alcohol ranged from 90% of homicide victims, to 73% of suicide victims and to 66% of UI victims. Alcohol was associated with 52% of homicides, 49% of UI and 40% of suicides. Alcohol was detected most often in samples from Hispanic men and from Native Americans of both sexes. This study suggests that state public health agencies and researchers should consider the use of ME data for epidemiologic information on the relationship between alcohol and injury-related mortality and for surveillance of these problems.\r"

  ".W": "Several proposals to change the existing structure of state alcoholic beverage control authorities have been advanced over the past 10 years in the United States. Most call for eliminating or substantially reducing the state's role in retail sales of alcohol, particularly distilled spirits and wines. In recent years the states of Iowa and West Virginia eliminated state monopolies for retail sales of wine, and now allow such sales by privately-owned licensed establishments. Using time-series methods, we assessed the effects of these policy changes on the alcoholic beverage market in each state. Privatization was associated with statistically significant increases in wine sales in Iowa and West Virginia, after controlling for an initial stocking effect and broader nationwide trends in alcohol sales in the 1980s. In addition, there was a net increase in absolute alcohol consumed in both states across all beverages (beer, wine and distilled spirits) associated with privatization.\r"

The study subjects were 228 black and white men and women, aged 24-51 years. On the two methods, the reported mean ethanol intake derived from each beverage, mean frequency of intake of each beverage and mean quantity for each beverage were similar. The relative rankings of individuals by the amount of ethanol for each beverage were also similar. The methods agreed less well on whether a particular beverage was ever consumed. The absolute amount of ethanol from each beverage agreed more closely between methods than did the percent of ethanol from each beverage. Results were similar for each race-sex subgroup. These findings suggest that analyses should use the reported amount of ethanol from each beverage, rather than converting to percentages or classifying according to the most used beverage. The good general agreement in the types and amounts of alcoholic beverages reported promotes some confidence in the relative validity of data from these two dietary methods for describing moderate alcohol intake in the general population.\r"

The data demonstrated similar subjective feelings after the low-dose diazepam and ethanol, but significantly greater effect after high-dose diazepam. Despite the similarities on subjective feelings, the low-dose diazepam challenge resulted in significantly more impairment than did ethanol on measures of memory, body sway and the evaluation of the passage of time. The similarities in subjective aspects of intoxication for ethanol and low-dose diazepam have potential implications for increasing our understanding of possible enhanced vulnerabilities for abuse of benzodiazepines among alcohol-abusing patients. The trend for similarities in subjective intoxication but greater impairment in motor and cognitive performance after low-dose diazepam compared to ethanol might indicate that subjects might be less aware of their actual levels of performance difficulties after the benzodiazepine. It is hoped that these data will help clinicians understand more about the quality of intoxication with benzodiazepines and the types of impairments likely to be observed.\r"

  ".W": "Syncytium formation, a feature of HIV-1-induced cytopathology, allows the virus to propagate through cell-to-cell spread. An assay has been developed to measure antibodies (syncytium inhibition, SI) that inhibit this process. Two cell lines were used: the indicator cells, which are not HIV-1 infected, bear CD4 receptors on their surface; the fusogenic HIV-1 infected cells, which do not release virus but are responsible for initiating syncytium formation, are free of CD4 receptors. Co-cultivation of about 10(5) of each of these cells induces the emergence of 70-100 multinucleated giant cells within 48 h. Sera from 34 children born to HIV-1-infected mothers were tested by western blot (WB) and SI assay. SI antibodies were detected in the blood of 15 (65%) of 23 WB-positive children and in none of 11 WB-negative children. There were striking differences in prevalence and titre of SI antibodies in children with lymphocytic interstitial pneumonitis (LIP) compared with those with opportunistic infections (OI). All 8 children with LIP had SI antibodies ranging in titre from 40 to greater than 320. By contrast, only 2 of 7 with OI had SI antibodies, in both of whom the SI titre was 20 (p less than 0.05). No sera from children who had seroreverted contained SI antibodies. The findings point to the need to identify the specific HIV-I peptides or epitopes responsible for syncytium formation since SI antibodies correlate with clinical outcome in children.\r"

Filarial-specific cellular responsiveness in amicrofilaraemic children born to infected mothers was lower than that in amicrofilaraemic children born to amicrofilaraemic mothers. No effect of paternal infection status was seen. The findings show that maternal infection is a risk factor for filarial infection in children and is associated with altered parasite-specific immune reactivity.\r"

Permethrin 5% cream was introduced as the only treatment in a programme to control scabies on an island of 756 inhabitants and involving workers recruited locally. Prevalence fell from 33% to less than 1% after every person was treated. As long as continued surveillance and treatment of newly introduced cases was maintained, prevalence of scabies remained below 1.5% for over 3 years. When supply of medication was interrupted for 3 weeks, prevalence rose to 3.6%. When control was lost after the US invasion of Panama, prevalence rose to 12% within 3 months. Bacterial skin infections decreased dramatically when scabies was controlled. Permethrin is safe and effective even in areas where this disease has become resistant to lindane.\r"

This compares with a prevalence of Duchenne muscular dystrophy of 2.48/100,000. The cumulative birth incidence of Becker muscular dystrophy (at least 1 in 18 450 male live births) was about one third that of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (1 in 5618 male live births), suggesting that the disorder is more common than previously thought.\r"

  ".W": "The efficacy and safety of tacrine (tetrahydroaminoacridine) plus lecithin were studied in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study. Patients with probable Alzheimer's disease were selected from those attending the memory clinic at a psychiatric hospital. Of the 89 patients included, 24 were withdrawn, 19 because of side-effects, 4 with other illnesses, and 1 for non-compliance. The active treatment was the maximum tolerated dose of tacrine up to 150 mg daily plus 10.8 g lecithin daily. Patients were randomly assigned to active or placebo treatment and crossed over after 13 weeks' treatment and 4 weeks' washout to the other treatment. The main outcome measures were the mini mental state examination (MMSE), the abbreviated mental test score (AMTS), and the carer's rating of the activities of daily living scale. Analysis for the 65 patients who completed the trial showed a significant beneficial effect of tacrine over placebo in the MMSE score (p less than 0.0001; 95% confidence interval for group change on tacrine over that on placebo 1.67-3.71); 29 (45%) patients showed an improvement of 3 or more points on tacrine compared with 7 (11%) during placebo. The findings with the AMTS were similar (p = 0.0001; 95% CI 0.36-1.38) but the ADL score showed no significant treatment effect. There was substantial variation in response among the subjects. Dose-dependent rises in serum liver enzymes were common but reversible. Tacrine produced an improvement in key outcome measures roughly equivalent to the deterioration which might have occurred over 6-12 months. The clinical relevance of the findings is a matter for individual judgment.\r"
