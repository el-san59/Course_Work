It is homologous to a human hepatoma glucose transporter and to E. coli membrane proteins that transport citrate (CitA), arabinose (AraE), and xylose (XylE), and, like these carrier proteins, WitA also contains 12 highly hydrophobic putative membrane-spanning regions. Gene disruption mutants constructed in two E. coli strains grew slowly or not at all, depending on genetic background, in M9 minimal medium containing alpha-ketoglutarate. Growth on alpha-ketoglutarate and uptake of alpha-[14C]ketoglutarate were restored by transformation with plasmids containing witA. These complementation studies indicate that WitA is an alpha-ketoglutarate transporter and should be renamed kgtP(alpha-ketoglutarate permease).\r"

This prospective, multicenter study examines the ability of glucose reagent teststrips to detect hypoglycemia when used under field conditions compared with simultaneously drawn control samples for laboratory glucose determination. Also examined was the accuracy of the teststrips in the laboratory glucose range less than or equal to 200 mg/dL. One hundred eighty-one pairs of data were analyzed. Hypoglycemia was defined as laboratory glucose less than or equal to 60 mg/dL. The teststrips correctly identified 31 of 33 patients in this range (sensitivity = 94%), and 125 of 148 patients without hypoglycemia (specificity = 85%). The two false negative readings were 70 and 90 mg/dL. Reagent teststrips were within +/- 40 mg/dL of the laboratory value in 70% of cases. The correlation coefficient (Spearman r) between teststrip and laboratory glucose in the range less than or equal to 200 mg/dL was .80. Using teststrip readings of 90 mg/dL or less as a measure of hypoglycemia yields 100% sensitivity with a specificity of 57%. We conclude glucose reagent teststrips are a useful adjunct for use in the prehospital setting and may be valuable for the detection of hypoglycemia.\r"

Doses ranged from 1/4 teaspoon to 4 tablespoons. Acute symptoms resolved within 7 hours. GHB was investigated as an anesthetic agent during the 1960s until seizures and lack of analgesia precluded its use. It was recently introduced in the health-food market as a food supplement for body builders with claims of anabolic effects by stimulating growth hormone release. GHB remains under investigational new drug status with the Food and Drug Administration and is illegal for over the counter sale. The Food and Drug Branch of the California Department of Health Services has prohibited further sale of this product in California as have health departments in Florida and South Carolina; however, new cases continue to be reported. Health professionals should be aware of the potential health hazards of GHB.\r"

Although case reports suggest significant contribution of contaminants to the morbidity and mortality of street drugs, most physicians' clinical experience and a comprehensive review of the clinical and forensic science literature demonstrate that impurities and additives play only a minor role in the majority of drug-related emergency department presentations. The strengths and weaknesses of several of the currently available drug abuse information data bases are reviewed, and qualitative information concerning the scope of contaminants that have been reported in preparations of cocaine, heroin, and phencyclidine is presented. More research is needed in this area, and a closer liaison between law enforcement, forensic scientists, and emergency physicians should be developed.\r"

Any suspicion of myocardial ischemia must be promptly evaluated and admitted. The American College of Emergency Physicians has recently published a standards document on the care of chest pain in the adult patient. The emergency physician must be familiar with this document. Once myocardial ischemia and other life-threatening causes are ruled out, one can consider that cervical disk disease may be the cause of chest pain. We present two cases of patients who presented to the emergency department with signs and symptoms consistent with cardiac ischemia. Both patients were found to have herniated cervical disks. Subsequent surgical repair completely relieved their symptoms. Evaluation of the literature shows that this entity was well described from 1950 to the 1960s. Most recent discussions do not mention disk herniation as even an infrequent cause of chest pain. If there is no life-threatening disease present, one should consider cervical disk disease.\r"

The mean annual case rate of malaria in this study group was more than three times the national rate. This may be ascribed to the notable ethnic diversity of the population. A history of travel to an area endemic for malaria was eventually elicited from all patients. The most common chief complaint was fever (56%) followed by abdominal pain (12%). Temperatures were elevated in 70% of the patients, with a mean temperature of 102.9 degrees F (39 degrees C). Gender was found to play a role in delaying diagnosis, with women accounting for 83% of a group of patients requiring multiple ED visits before diagnosis. The authors conclude that malaria must be considered when diagnosing patients in ethnically diverse populations. Gender may be associated with a delay in diagnosis. A careful travel history and a peripheral smear are aids in rapid diagnosis.\r"

Following any resuscitation and exclusion of other significant injuries, a clinical and radiologic diagnosis of the facial injuries should be undertaken including assessment of the fractured mandible. Initial therapy should be directed at temporary immobilization and pharmacologic treatment, followed by referral for appropriate definitive care.\r"

Past medical history was otherwise unremarkable; physical examination revealed paranoid ideation and asterixis. Laboratory evaluation was significant for metabolic acidosis with a calculated anion gap of 39. Liver enzymes were elevated, and lactic acid level was 9.5 mmol/L (normal: 0.5 to 2.2 mmol/L). White blood cell count was 23,100, but all cultures were negative, and all other diagnostic studies, including bilirubin, prothrombin time, and ammonia were normal. The patient recovered rapidly with hydration and administration of thiamine and magnesium. After psychiatric evaluation, a diagnosis of toxic delirium due to niacin and ethanol coingestion was made. This is the first case reporting toxic delirium and lactic acidosis due to niacin and ethanol coingestion. This occurred in the absence of significant hepatic impairment. Possible mechanisms for the observed derangements are discussed.\r"

DESIGN--Observational prospective study of age, sex, transthoracic impedance, site of cardiac arrest, ventricular fibrillation duration and amplitude, primary or secondary ventricular fibrillation, aetiology, number of shocks to correct ventricular fibrillation, and drug treatment. SETTING--A teaching hospital and a mobile coronary care unit with a physician. PATIENTS--70 consecutive patients (50 male, 20 female) mean age 66.5 years. INTERVENTIONS--Before the first countershock was administered transthoracic impedance using a 30 kHz low amplitude AC current passed through 8 cm/12 cm self-adhesive defibrillator electrode pads applied in the anteroapical position was measured. The first two shocks were 200 J delivered energy (low energy) and further shocks of 360 J (high energy) were given if required. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Countershock success and outcome from ventricular fibrillation. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS--First shock success was significantly greater in inhospital arrests (37/53) than in out-of-hospital arrests (5/17) and in those receiving antiarrhythmic treatment (13/15, 86.7%) v (27/51, 52.9%). Transthoracic impedance was similar in those who were successfully defibrillated with one or two 200 J shocks (98.7 (26) omega) and those who required one or more 360 J shocks (91.4 (23) omega). Success rates with two 200 J shocks were similar in those patients with \"high\" transthoracic impedance (that is, greater than 115 omega) and those with transthoracic impedance (less than or equal to 115 omega) (8/12 (67%) v 44/58 (76%]. Fine ventricular fibrillation was significantly more common in the patients with a transthoracic impedance of greater than 95 omega (41% (13/32] than in those with a transthoracic impedance less than or equal to 95 omega (13% (5/38]. Death during arrest was significantly more common in patients who needed high energy shocks (14/18 (78%] than in those who needed low energy shocks (16/52 (31%]. Multiple regression analysis identified ventricular fibrillation with an amplitude of greater than or equal to 0.5 mV, age less than or equal to 70 years, and arrests that needed less than or equal to two shocks for defibrillation, in rank order as independent predictors of survival to discharge.\r"

Myocardial infarction reached the right bundle branch more than 8 mm above the moderator band in all of group A, whereas myocardial infarction reached the right bundle branch less than 3 mm above the moderator band in only three patients in group B. Nine hearts in group A showed significant necrosis of the right bundle branch. In group B and in one case with transient right bundle branch block no necrosis was found. The occurrence of right bundle branch block was almost entirely explained by necrosis of the right bundle branch, but transient right bundle branch block did develop without necrosis of the right bundle branch.\r"

METHODS--Human endothelial cells cultured from the umbilical vein and isolated rat cardiac myocytes were treated with plasma from rats given adrenaline 30 minutes previously with pretreatment with calcium antagonists and without. The effect on indices of cell damage that suggest oxidation stress was determined. RESULTS--Pretreatment of rats with calcium antagonists before adrenaline administration largely inhibited the cytotoxic effects of their plasma on the two target cells used. Plasma taken from animals not pretreated with calcium antagonists caused release of oxidised glutathione from cells, a fall in intra-cellular reduced glutathione concentration, a fall in ATP production, and release of angiotensin converting enzyme from the endothelial cells. CONCLUSION--Calcium antagonists protect against the cardiotoxic effects of catecholamine by preventing the generation of plasma borne cytotoxic compounds, which are probably free radicals.\r"

Ten pressure perfused human hearts were examined in vitro with a 10 MHz (Diasonics) transducer and a 7.5 MHz (Vingmed/Sonotron) transducer. There was close agreement between ultrasound and pathological measurements of coronary artery luminal diameter. Qualitative changes in wall structure such as diffuse wall thickening and calcification were readily identified; however, the resolution of the transducers was not high enough accurately to measure wall dimensions in normal coronary arteries. Coefficient of variation measurements for intra and inter observer variability (5.2% and 6.9% respectively) showed excellent reproducibility. The technique was accurate in identifying atherosclerotic lesions, imaging arteries distal to an occlusion, locating deeply sited arteries, and identifying complete obliteration of an artery. Intraoperative video playback and transducer miniaturisation may minimise problems caused by cardiac movement and restricted access. With these developments intraoperative assessment of coronary artery disease may become a real possibility.\r"

Eight died from three days to three years after diagnosis (overall mortality 47%). The nine survivors, now aged 2-17 years, have been followed for one to 10 years (mean follow up five years) after infarction. The commonest causes of myocardial infarction in this series were anomalous origin of left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery (six patients (35%] and Kawasaki disease (five patients (27%]. The main symptoms of acute myocardial infarction were dyspnoea, vomiting, and difficulty feeding. Diagnosis was made in all patients by electrocardiography and confirmed by echocardiography, cardiac catheterisation, or at operation. All survivors were symptom free with excellent exercise capacity. The left ventricular ejection fraction in survivors ranged from 21% to 66%, and only one child was on regular cardiac medications. There were no cases of late sudden death. Twenty four hour Holter monitoring performed on survivors was normal (seven) or showed minor abnormalities only (one), suggesting that serious arrhythmia is rare after paediatric myocardial infarction. Myocardial infarction in children had a high early mortality; however, the incidence of serious arrhythmia was low in the survivors, who had a good exercise tolerance even when the left ventricular ejection fraction was low.\r"

Eight patients with ischemic heart disease and in sinus rhythm were studied for comparison. Though the serum digoxin concentration decreased significantly during exercise, the absolute reduction in heart rate was the same at rest and during exercise in patients with atrial fibrillation. Compared with the control patients in sinus rhythm, the heart rate in patients with atrial fibrillation was not adequately controlled during exercise by any serum digoxin concentration tested despite a reduction in heart rate with increasing digoxin concentration. The effects of digoxin on heart rate regulation in atrial fibrillation are complex and include direct effects on the myocardium as well as indirect effects mediated by modulation of the autonomic nervous system; the present results indicate that the drug is not displaced from the target organs by decreasing serum concentrations during exercise. In atrial fibrillation, because the demands on the filter function of the atrioventricular node are highly unphysiological, the effect of digoxin on heart rate during exercise is not adequate.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To study the mechanisms underlying the high venous pressure often seen in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy. DESIGN--Retrospective and prospective examination of the pattern of flow in the superior vena cava, cardiac echo-Doppler studies, and recordings of the jugular venous pulse. SETTING--A tertiary referral cardiac centre. PATIENTS PARTICIPANTS--23 patients with dilated cardiomyopathy, all with functional mitral and tricuspid regurgitation. RESULTS--Two patterns of venous pulse were seen: a dominant 'a' wave and 'x' descent, with systolic flow in the superior vena cava (group 1, n = 11), and a dominant 'v' wave with 'y' descent and diastolic flow in the superior vena cava (group 2, n = 12). A comparison of group 1 and group 2 showed: age (mean (SD] 58 (12) v 61 (6) years, left ventricular end diastolic dimension 7.0 (0.7) cm in both groups, right ventricular short axis 3.3 (0.6) v 3.6 (0.5) cm and long axis 7.3 (0.5) v 7.1 (0.7) cm, and duration of tricuspid regurgitation 350 (65) v 370 (50) ms. The RR interval (550 (100) v 680 (80) ms) and right ventricular filling time (150 (30) v 290 (50) ms) were significantly shorter in group 1. In all patients in group 2 right ventricular filling time was more than 200 ms with separate E and A waves on the tricuspid Doppler echocardiogram, while in all group 1 patients it was less than 200 ms with a single summation peak. In nine patients in group 1, the right ventricular filling time was limited by prolonged tricuspid regurgitation and in the remaining two by prolonged isovolumic relaxation time (215 (80) ms), so that it was consistently significantly less than that of the left ventricle. CONCLUSION--In patients with dilated cardiomyopathy, right ventricular filling time may be so short that it limits stroke volume. Such patients can be recognised by a dominant 'a' wave on the jugular venous pulse. Patients in whom the right ventricular filling time was longer showed a dominant 'v' wave. Both groups can present as \"congestive heart failure\".\r"

Nineteen episodes of atrial flutter were successfully converted to sinus rhythm. In the remaining two episodes atrial fibrillation was induced with spontaneous conversion to sinus rhythm within 12 hours in one episode and immediate DC cardioversion to sinus rhythm in the other. Intracardiac stimulation techniques were highly successful in this group and allowed reliable conversion to sinus rhythm without general anaesthesia and high energy cardioversion. In patients with atrial flutter associated with congenital heart disease intracardiac stimulation techniques should be tried first.\r"

To determine whether collagen shields produce histologic evidence of inflammation when implanted subconjunctivally, shields were implanted into four rabbit eyes and six guinea pig eyes and retained for 7 or 14 days. Two rabbit eyes and two guinea pig eyes served as controls. Seven days after implantation in the rabbit eyes foreign-body giant cells were present at the surface of the shield, and early deposition of connective tissue was evident around the shield. The inflammatory response at 14 days was similar but more intense. In the guinea pig eyes the collagen shields induced substantially less inflammation, and there was marked shield degradation at 14 days. The results suggest that the inflammatory response in rabbits may be species specific and that collagen shields may be of value as a drug-delivery system for antifibroblast drugs in other species.\r"

A total of 98% of the patients with blepharospasm and 100% of the patients with hemifacial spasm had significant relief of their symptoms; however, 11% of the former and 2% of the latter did not respond to the usual starting concentrations of the drug and needed stronger dosages for relief. The duration of relief varied widely in both groups. Up to 7% of patients had ineffective treatments but responded to subsequent injections. Analysis of variance and linear trend statistics showed that there were no changes in the mean duration of relief over the first several treatments for individual patients in either group. Side effects were transient and included ptosis, exposure keratitis, epiphora and strabismus.\r"

Both viscoelastics were aspirated at the end of surgery. Patients were examined before surgery and 1 and 14 days after surgery. Endothelial cell counts were obtained before surgery and 3 months after surgery in 34 patients (16 in the polyacrylamide group and 18 in the sodium hyaluronate group). There were no reports of a flat or shallow anterior chamber intraoperatively in either group. There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups in the incidence of corneal edema or iritis on any visit or in endothelial cell loss. Although there was a significant reduction in intraocular pressure across postoperative visits for the overall sample, there was no significant difference in pressure between the polyacrylamide and sodium hyaluronate groups. The results indicate that no untoward effects on corneal edema, endothelial cell count, iritis or intraocular pressure are to be expected when polyacrylamide is used as an aid to cataract surgery.\r"

RESULTS: The neonatal death rate was higher in the Indian population than in the provincial population during the study period; the difference between the two groups in the rate decreased markedly after 1982. The rates of stillbirth and infant death were also higher among the Indians, and the difference persisted during the study period. The incidence of low birth weight and the rate of stillbirth were highest in the youngest and oldest maternal groups in the provincial population; however, the pattern was markedly different among the Indians, teenaged mothers having the best outcomes. CONCLUSION: Further studies are needed to determine the relation between maternal age and fetal outcome among native Indians.\r"

Whether these functional defects are related to a structural remodeling of the myocardium that includes an interstitial and perivascular fibrosis, myocyte hypertrophy, and medial thickening of intramyocardial coronary arteries is uncertain. To address these issues, 14-week-old male spontaneously hypertensive rats with established hypertension and LVH were treated with low-dose (SLO group: 2.5 mg/kg/day, n = 11) or high-dose (SHI group: 20 mg/kg/day, n = 9) oral lisinopril for 12 weeks to sustain hypertension and LVH or to normalize arterial pressure and myocardial mass, respectively. When SHI and SLO groups were compared with age- and sex-matched 26-week-old untreated spontaneously hypertensive rats (n = 11) and normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats (n = 9), we found 1) normalization of blood pressure (p less than 0.005) and complete regression of LVH (p less than 0.005) in the SHI group and no significant blood pressure or LVH reduction in the SLO group, 2) complete regression of morphometrically determined myocardial interstitial and perivascular fibrosis in SHI and SLO groups (p less than 0.025) associated with normalization of diastolic stiffness, measured in the isolated heart (p less than 0.025), and 3) regression of medial wall thickening of intramyocardial coronary arteries only in the SHI group (P less than 0.005), accompanied by a normalization of coronary vasodilator reserve to adenosine (p less than 0.005). Thus, interstitial fibrosis and not LVH is responsible for abnormal myocardial diastolic stiffness, whereas medical wall thickening of intramyocardial resistance vessels, influenced by arterial pressure, is associated with impaired coronary reserve.\r"

Although considerable information exists regarding the morphological organization of the heart extracellular matrix, little is known about the regulation of the synthesis and accumulation of extracellular matrix components. A potentially significant factor in the cardiovascular system is mechanical stimulation including changes in physical tension and pressure. We recently have developed an in vitro model system to elucidate the effects of mechanical stretch on isolated populations of heart cells. In the present study, we have used biochemical and molecular biological techniques to analyze changes in collagen synthesis by cardiac fibroblasts in response to mechanical stretch. These studies show that the ratio of collagen type III to collagen type I increases in mechanically stretched cells. They also show that type III collagen mRNA levels are increased in response to cyclic mechanical stretch for durations as short as 12 hours. Type I collagen mRNA levels were not found to change under the stretch conditions used in this study. Our results emphasize the potential regulatory role of mechanical stimulation in the expression of specific genes in the heart and support previous studies indicating this to be an intriguing in vitro model of cardiac hypertrophy.\r"

The present study examined whether PAF might serve as a priming factor in endotoxin-induced tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF alpha) synthesis, cardiovascular shock, and lung injury in anesthetized rats. Intravenous infusion of PAF (1 pmol/kg/min for 60 minutes, n = 5) alone or endotoxin (0.1 micrograms/kg i.v. bolus, n = 5) failed to alter blood pressure, serum TNF alpha and thromboxane B2, platelet and leukocyte count, and hematocrit, nor was lung histology, myeloperoxidase activity, and water content changed. In contrast, the combined administration of PAF and endotoxin markedly elevated serum TNF alpha (1,359 +/- 362 pg/ml, n = 5, p less than 0.01) and thromboxane B2 (43 +/- 5 pg/100 microliters, n = 8, p less than 0.01) along with hypotension, hemoconcentration, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia. Most notably, the combined regimen caused neutrophil aggregation, adhesion, and accumulation into the lung parenchyma along with platelet-fibrin deposits in postcapillary venules, pulmonary edema, and increased lung myeloperoxidase activity. The role of PAF in this process was confirmed by 1) the prevention of the priming effect by pretreatment with the PAF antagonist BN 50739 (n = 5), and 2) the failure of lyso-PAF, the cardinal nonactive PAF-metabolite, to prime for endotoxin-induced production of TNF alpha (n = 4). These data suggest that PAF could serve as a key mediator in priming for endotoxin-induced tissue injury, especially the typical pulmonary pathophysiology of adult respiratory distress syndrome, a severe pathological outcome of septic shock, burns, and multiple organ injury.\r"

  ".W": "Although abnormal myocardial calcium homeostasis in the cardiomyopathic hamster (CMH) has been documented in the hypertrophic stage of the disease, the Ca2+ tolerance before the hypertrophic stage has not been investigated. We studied isovolumic contractile function in response to a variety of Ca2+ stresses including increases in perfusate [Ca2+] (Cao), the Ca2+ channel agonist Bay K 8644, and alpha- or beta-adrenergic agonists of isolated perfused hamster hearts from 24-45-day-old male CMH, BIO 14.6 strain, and age- and sex-matched F1B strain controls. The coronary flow at a constant perfusion pressure did not differ between two groups at baseline or after any Ca2+ stress. At a Cao of 1.0 mM, neither end-diastolic pressure (EDP) nor developed pressure (DP) nor half relaxation time (RT1/2) during stimulation at 1-3 Hz differed between the two groups; as Cao was increased up to 10 mM, CMH hearts showed a lower threshold for the occurrence of a Ca2+ overload profile: EDP and RT1/2 increased to a greater, and DP to a lesser, extent in CMH than in control hearts. To determine whether calcium influx via Ca2+ channels mediates the lower threshold for Ca2+ overload in CMH hearts, we measured resting pressure and scattered laser light intensity fluctuation (SLIF) in unstimulated hearts. Prior studies have shown that SLIF is generated by microscopic tissue motion caused by diastolic spontaneous sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ release and that SLIF amplitude reflects the extent of cell and sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ loading. The Ca(2+)-dependent increase in resting pressure in unstimulated hearts was highly correlated with an increase in SLIF, and this relation was steeper in CMH than in control hearts. CMH hearts also showed a reduced threshold for the occurrence of a Ca2+ overload profile in response to the adrenergic receptor agonists and the Ca2+ channel agonist during electrical stimulation in a Cao of 2.0 mM: maximum DP achieved with each agonist was significantly less and the dose-response curves to each agonist were shifted leftward in CMH versus control hearts. In CMH hearts EDP began to increase at a significantly lower concentration of each agonist, and the maximum extent of increase in EDP in response to all agonists was significantly enhanced compared with control hearts. In response to beta-adrenergic or Ca2+ channel agonists, neither resting pressure nor SLIF in unstimulated hearts increased in control or in CMH hearts. In contrast, in response to alpha-adrenergic stimulation, both SLIF and resting pressure increased to a greater extent in CMH than in control hearts.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

The conditioned medium at a 1:10 dilution induced a twofold increase in collagen and total protein accumulation in fibroblast cultures. At low concentration (1:50 dilution), the conditioned medium stimulated collagen accumulation preferentially; at high concentration (1:10 dilution), overall protein synthesis also was increased. The increase in type I collagen accumulation was associated with an increase in the steady-state level of alpha 1 (I) mRNA for collagen. The conditioned medium increased the production of types I and III collagen without affecting the proportion of collagen types in both fibroblast and smooth muscle cell cultures. Partial purification of the endothelial cell-derived factor disclosed it to be a heat-stable protein with an apparent molecular weight of 8-10 kDa. The stimulation of protein formation by this substance was not inhibited by antibodies against transforming growth factor-beta or the insulinlike growth factor I receptor.

Five dogs were studied during combined acute hypoxemia (PaO2, 37 +/- 1 mm Hg) and hypercapnic acidosis (PaCO2, 59 +/- 1 mm Hg; pH 7.20 +/- 0.01). Each dog was studied during infusion of 1) the intrarenal vehicle (n = 5), 2) the intrarenal alpha 1-antagonist prazosin (0.2 micrograms.kg-1.min-1, n = 5), 3) intrarenal [Sar1,Ala8]angiotensin II (70 ng.kg-1.min-1, n = 5), and 4) intrarenal prazosin and [Sar1,Ala8]angiotensin II (n = 4). Immediate induction of combined hypoxemia and hypercapnic acidosis after control measurements during intrarenal vehicle infusion resulted in a decrease in effective renal plasma flow and glomerular filtration rate, increase in renal vascular resistance, and decrease in filtered sodium load in the first 20 minutes of the blood gas derangement. Intrarenal administration of [Sar1,Ala8]angiotensin II failed to reverse the effects of the combined blood gas derangement on renal function. In contrast, intrarenal prazosin administration either alone or in combination with [Sar1,Ala8]angiotensin II abrogated the increase in renal vascular resistance, decrease in glomerular filtration rate, and fall in filtered sodium load. These studies identify a major role for alpha 1-adrenoceptors in the renal vasoconstriction during combined hypoxemia and hypercapnic acidosis.\r"

We investigated the actions of porcine/human endothelin-1 (ET-1) on the microvasculature of the guinea pig lung perfused at constant flow with Ringers-albumin. We measured the perfusion pressure, distribution of pulmonary vascular resistance (using the double occlusion method), lung weight change, and the pulmonary capillary filtration coefficient. At concentrations of greater than or equal to 10(-10) M, ET-1 produced dose-dependent increases in mean pulmonary artery pressure (EC50, approximately 10(-9.5) M), which were rapid in onset and biphasic (first phase peaking at 1-2 minutes; second phase peaking at 10-15 minutes) up to 60 minutes of the perfusion period. The vasoconstrictor response was sustained for the 60-minute perfusion period. The pulmonary vasoconstriction was inhibited by pretreatment with indomethacin (10(-5) M), the thromboxane A2 receptor antagonist SQ-29,548 (4 x 10(-6) M), or papaverine (10(-5) M). Nifedipine (10(-5) or 10(-7) M) had no effect on the first phase but prevented the second phase of the vasoconstriction. The vasoconstriction was primarily the result of a 10-fold increase in pulmonary venous resistance. Pulmonary edema developed after ET-1 challenge because of the venoconstriction and the resultant pulmonary capillary hypertension. However, the pulmonary capillary filtration coefficient was unchanged, indicating that pulmonary vascular permeability did not increase. ET-1 also had no effect on transendothelial 125I-albumin flux. The results indicate that ET-1 is a potent thromboxane-dependent venoconstrictor in the guinea pig lung.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Adrenergic constriction of skeletal muscle arterioles, particularly small terminal arterioles, is opposed by decreased blood flow or increased metabolic rate. Our previous studies indicate that neural constriction of large arterioles, which have both postjunctional alpha 1- and alpha 2-adrenoceptors, is mediated by alpha 1-receptors; small arterioles depend on alpha 2-receptors. Also, alpha 2, but not alpha 1, constriction is reduced by acidosis. Differential sensitivity of alpha 1 versus alpha 2 constriction to metabolic signals such as H+ may underlie the sensitivity of arteriolar adrenergic constriction to metabolic inhibition. To examine this hypothesis, we studied the effect of reduced perfusion on alpha 1- versus alpha 2-mediated constriction of large arterioles and venules. Intravital microscopy of rat cremaster skeletal muscle was used to obtain concentration-response curves for phenylephrine (alpha 1-agonist) and UK-14,304 (alpha 2-agonist). Thirty percent reduction in cremasteric artery flow by venous outflow obstruction had no effect on baseline diameter, indicating no effect on \"intrinsic tone.\" Reduced perfusion also had no effect on arteriolar or venular sensitivity to phenylephrine or venular sensitivity to UK-14,304 but significantly attenuated arteriolar response to UK-14,304. To examine a possible mechanism for the selective inhibition of alpha 2 constriction by acidosis, we determined the effect of acidosis on the partial alpha 1-agonist St587. Like alpha 2 constriction, St587-mediated constriction of arterioles was reduced during acidosis and was attenuated by nifedipine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Our previous studies in rat skeletal muscle have determined that neural constriction of large arterioles, which regulate blood flow and peripheral resistance, is mediated by alpha 1-adrenoceptors, whereas small arterioles, which determine effective capillary density, depend on alpha 2-receptors. During physical exercise, metabolic vasodilators from contracting skeletal muscle oppose neural vasoconstriction. By mechanisms that are not understood, adrenergic constriction of small arterioles is particularly sensitive to metabolic inhibition during imbalances in oxygen supply versus demand. This sensitivity may result from the reliance of small arterioles on alpha 2-receptors and a greater sensitivity of alpha 2 constriction to metabolic dilators. We previously demonstrated selective attenuation of arteriolar alpha 2 constriction during a reduction in the oxygen supply/demand ratio subsequent to decreased skeletal muscle perfusion. In the present study, intravital microscopy of rat cremaster skeletal muscle was used to examine the effect of increased oxygen demand on adrenergic constriction of arterioles. The effect of multiple frequencies of skeletal muscle contraction (via genitofemoral nerve stimulation) on alpha 1 (norepinephrine + rauwolscine) and alpha 2 (norepinephrine + prazosin) constriction was used to evaluate neural-metabolic interactions over a wide range of metabolic conditions. Low-frequency (less than or equal to 2 Hz) skeletal muscle contraction attenuated only alpha 2 constriction; contractions greater than or equal to 4 Hz attenuated alpha 1 constriction and further reduced alpha 2 constriction. Comparison of the frequency of contraction necessary to produce inhibition of 20% of maximal dilation indicated that alpha 2 constriction was approximately 10-fold more sensitive than alpha 1 constriction to \"metabolic\" inhibition. High-frequency, but not low-frequency, contraction also inhibited intrinsic tone. These data suggest that release of dilator substances during moderate exercise may preferentially attenuate alpha 2 constriction to produce small arteriolar dilation and increased capillary density. In contrast, metabolic signals associated with higher frequency muscle contraction may inhibit both intrinsic tone and large arteriolar alpha 1 tone so that blood flow and oxygen delivery increase to match the elevated oxygen demand of more heavily exercising muscle.\r"

  ".W": "Single, isolated rat ventricular myocytes were made hypoxic for 10 minutes and then reoxygenated. During hypoxia, there was a marked abbreviation of the mechanical twitch, without a decrease in its amplitude. Immediately after reoxygenation, both the time to peak shortening and the duration of relaxation were markedly prolonged, and they remained prolonged for 10-50 minutes. The alterations in contraction and relaxation were not associated with any change in the time course of either the transmembrane action potential or the cytosolic calcium transient, as recorded with the fluorescent probe indo 1. Intracellular pH, measured with a fluorescent probe (carboxyseminaphthorhodofluor), showed an acid shift during hypoxia and an alkaline rebound immediately after reoxygenation. The time courses of intracellular pH and contraction duration were not parallel during hypoxia or reoxygenation, and simulation of the alkaline pH shift by lowering PCO2 or superfusing NH4Cl (in the absence of exposure to hypoxia) did not quantitatively reproduce the prolongation of relaxation seen after reoxygenation. The prolongation of contraction after reoxygenation could be overridden by the beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol or the nonenzymatic phosphatase butanedione monoxime. We conclude that delayed relaxation after reoxygenation exists at the single cell level and is due to an alteration of the properties of the myofilaments. Intracellular pH is not the primary mediator of this alteration. We speculate that alteration of intracellular inorganic phosphate or covalent modification of the myofilaments might be involved.\r"

The general hypothesis investigated in this study is that previous beat contraction history occurs because of the perturbation of one or more biochemical processes with time courses that are long relative to one cardiac cycle. If this is true, then previous beat contraction history should depend on the interval between beats and, therefore, should extend beyond the previous beat to two, or even three, previous beats as heart rate is increased. Hemodynamic responses to random preload and afterload changes were measured in 11 anesthetized open-chest dogs on right heart bypass at three paced heart rates. Multiple linear regression was used to analyze these hemodynamic sequences and identify variables from the previous one, two, or three beats that were important in the mechanical history dependence of left ventricular function. The results of this analysis showed that under baseline conditions, all 11 hearts showed one beat of history dependence, with only two of 11 hearts showing a dependence on the previous two or three beats. At the highest heart rate, all 11 hearts still showed one beat of history dependence, but 10 of 11 hearts showed two beats of history dependence, and four of 11 showed three beats of history dependence (p less than 0.05). A general framework for the mechanism underlying these findings, which relates previous beat contraction history to the interval-dependent mechanical restitution phenomenon, is proposed and discussed.\r"

ET-1 (10(-7) M) induced about twofold to fourfold increases in the gene expression of myosin light chain 2, alpha-actin, and troponin I after 6 hours, which continued up to 24 hours. The ET-1-induced increases in mRNA levels for these muscle-specific genes were dose dependent (10(-9) to 10(-7) M). Run-on transcriptional assay showed that the changes in mRNA level for three muscle-specific genes were regulated, at least in part, at the transcriptional level. 12-O-Tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA), a potent protein kinase C activator, and the Ca2+ ionophore ionomycin also increased mRNA levels of three muscle-specific genes. ET-1, TPA, and ionomycin similarly induced the expression of c-fos after 30 minutes, which returned to an undetectable level after 6 hours. ET-1 remarkably and dose-dependently stimulated accumulation of total inositol phosphates in cardiomyocytes. Morphometrical evaluation showed that ET-1 significantly increased surface area of cardiomyocytes without cell proliferation. ET-1 also dose-dependently stimulated the synthesis of protein and DNA, which was unaffected by the L-type calcium channel blocker nicardipine. These data suggest that ET-1 induces hypertrophy of cardiomyocytes associated with the induction of muscle-specific gene transcripts through the possible involvement of protein kinase C activation or intracellular Ca2+ mobilization.\r"

SMCs were enriched with unesterified (free) cholesterol (FC) for 18-24 hours with medium containing human low density lipoprotein and FC-rich phospholipid (PL) liposomes. This procedure increased cholesterol mass without affecting PL mass, resulting in an increase in the FC/PL molar ratio compared with controls in cells (67% FC increase, p less than 0.001; 43% FC/PL ratio increase, p less than 0.01) and in SMC microsomes (52% FC increase, p less than 0.05; 43% FC/PL ratio increase, p less than 0.05). Cholesterol enrichment also increased unstimulated 45Ca2+ influx (p less than 0.001) and efflux (p less than 0.05). Cellular cholesterol content correlated in a linear fashion with these changes (influx: r = 0.722, p less than 0.01; efflux: r = 0.951, p less than 0.05). In addition, cytosolic calcium levels increased approximately 34% (p less than 0.01) with cholesterol enrichment. The cholesterol-induced increase in 45Ca2+ influx was reversible with time and demonstrated sensitivity to the channel blockers. Fluorescence anisotropy measured from 5 degrees C to 40 degrees C using the fluorophore diphenylhexatriene showed decreased membrane fluidity in microsomal membranes obtained from cholesterol-enriched SMCs compared with controls (p less than 0.02). These results suggest that the SMC plasma membrane is very sensitive to cholesterol enrichment with liposomes or human low density lipoprotein and that increases in membrane cholesterol content increase cytosolic calcium levels in SMCs, are associated with a decrease in membrane fluidity, and unmask a new, or otherwise silent, dihydropyridine-sensitive calcium channel that may be involved in altered arterial wall properties with serum hypercholesterolemia.\r"

  ".U": "91275326\r", 
  ".W": "Microneurographic measurements of muscle sympathetic nerve activity (SNA) have suggested that, during static exercise, central command is much less important than skeletal muscle afferents in causing sympathetic neural activation. The possibility remains, however, that the sympathetic discharge produced by central command is targeted mainly to tissues other than skeletal muscle. To examine this possibility, we recorded SNA with microelectrodes placed selectively in skin, as well as in muscle, nerve fascicles of the peroneal nerve during static handgrip maneuvers designed to separate the effects of central command from those of muscle afferents. To study the relative effects of cutaneous sympathetic activation on sudomotor versus vasomotor function, we simultaneously estimated changes in skin blood flow (laser Doppler velocimetry) and in sudomotor (electrodermal) activation in the region of skin innervated by the impaled nerve fascicle. Two minutes of static handgrip at 10%, 20%, and 30% of maximal voluntary contraction caused large and intensity-dependent increases in skin SNA. These increases in SNA immediately preceded the onset of muscle tension, accelerated progressively during sustained handgrip, and resolved promptly with the cessation of motor effort. The handgrip-induced increases in skin SNA were not maintained when handgrip was followed by arrest of the forearm circulation, a maneuver that maintains the stimulation of chemically sensitive muscle afferents while eliminating the influences of central command and mechanically sensitive muscle afferents. During normothermia, static handgrip at 30% maximal voluntary contraction caused sustained increases in skin SNA (+400 +/- 83%, mean +/- SEM, p less than 0.05) and in electrodermal activity (+276 +/- 56%, p less than 0.05) but only transient increases in estimated skin vascular resistance (+11 +/- 2%, p less than 0.05). When skin temperature was increased or decreased to a new stable baseline level, subsequent increases in skin SNA during handgrip were accompanied by sustained but directionally opposite changes in estimated skin vascular resistance, with exercise-induced vasodilation during hyperthermia but exercise-induced vasoconstriction during hypothermia. From these observations, we conclude the following: 1) static exercise markedly increases sympathetic outflow to skin as well as to skeletal muscle; 2) the increases in skin SNA, unlike muscle SNA, appear to be caused mainly by central command rather than by muscle afferent reflexes; and 3) this cutaneous sympathetic activation appears to be targeted both to sweat glands and to vascular smooth muscle, with the relative targeting being temperature dependent.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Rapid, reversible, specific, high-affinity and low-capacity binding sites were detected for the agonist, [3H]AVP, and the V1 selective antagonist, d(CH2)5 Tyr (Me)-[3H]AVP (V1 antagonist), radioligands. The V2 selective antagonist radioligand, d(CH2)5 D-Ile des-Gly NH2-[3H]AVP, showed very little binding even at very high concentrations. [3H]AVP and [3H]V1 antagonist specific binding attained equilibrium in 10 minutes at 37 degrees C. The Kd and Bmax values (mean +/- SEM) were [3H]AVP: Kd 1.44 +/- 0.18 nM; Bmax 5,253 +/- 590 sites/cell; [3H]V1 antagonist: Kd 0.96 +/- 0.10 nM; Bmax 6,869 +/- 485 sites/cell. Ki values for a series of AVP-related peptide analogues and antagonists determined by competitive inhibition of [3H]AVP binding were consistent with the saturation data. The results suggest that these cells possess a homogeneous population of V1 subtype AVP receptors. AVP increased [Ca2+]i in a concentration-dependent manner as judged by fura-2 fluorescence. This was completely attenuated by inclusion of the V1 antagonist. The maximal increase in [Ca2+]i evoked by AVP from a resting level of 60 +/- 5 nM was less (250 +/- 35 nM) in comparison to the maximal response evoked by angiotensin II (2,337 +/- 640 nM).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Ligation of this side branch would reduce the moduli of the higher harmonics when the length of the side branch was appropriate. Electrical analogy of vessels was used to analyze this phenomenon. This simulation can explain the ligation results we found in rats. It may also clarify the discrepancies between the prediction of the Womersley equation and the experimental results. We suggest that the aorta and the closely attached organ can produce coupled oscillation; theoretically, this structure is equivalent to a resonance circuit.\r"

  ".W": "Various tissues including heart express specific binding sites for endothelin. Endothelins have been reported to increase the force of contraction of cardiac muscle, presumably via specific receptors. Specific binding of endothelin to atrial tissue is particularly high. In spontaneously contracting rat atrial cells used in this study, all three isoforms of endothelin (endothelin-1, endothelin-2, and endothelin-3) decreased the rate of beating and caused an increase in inwardly rectifying K+ current in voltage-clamped whole cells. Endothelin-3 was the most potent isoform, and its effects on beating rate and K+ current were present at a concentration as low as 100 pM (Kd, approximately 1 nM). the atrial cells did not have the hyperpolarization-activated current (the pacemaker current), If. In excised inside-out patches, all three isoforms of endothelin activated a population of K+ channels with kinetic properties identical to those of acetylcholine (muscarinic)-activated K+ channels, and this was GTP dependent. Endothelin failed to decrease the beating rate or to elicit the K+ current in pertussis toxin-treated cells. These results indicate that endothelin has a potent negatively chronotropic effect by activation of the inwardly rectifying, muscarinic K+ channel and therefore could be an important regulator of heart function.\r"

  ".U": "91275330\r", 
  ".W": "This study investigations the phenomenon of sustained mechanical alternans (SMA) through the use of quantitative criteria. Discrete analysis is used to demonstrate that the hemodynamic variables during SMA are governed by a simple mathematical relation. The analysis shows that the value of the slope created by the two alternating beats on the stroke volume (SV)-end-diastolic volume (EDV) plane is gamma = (mu - 1) (1 + beta)/(mu - beta), where mu = SVs/SVw, and SVs and SVw denote the strong and weak beats, respectively, in the presence of one contractile state, and the beats associated with the higher and lower contractile states, respectively, in the presence of two alternating contractile states; beta = FVs/FVw, where FVs and FVw are the filling volumes after SVs and SVw, respectively. This equation is valid, whether SMA is exhibited in the presence of one or two contractile states and irrespective of the SV-EDV functional relation. Assuming constant afterload, a criterion based on this slope (gamma) is described to determine if SMA is caused by variations in EDV and FV. The slope of the SV-EDV curve in the presence of one contractile state (denoted as gamma) was determined directly (34 runs in eight dogs) by preventing FV in a beat, after a steady state, using a remote-controlled mitral valve. The slope gamma = 0.892 +/- 0.078 was found to agree with data in the literature. In 10 other dogs, mitral flow and aortic flow were measured in 55 series of SMA. In 51 series, gamma was greater than 1. Because the experimental slope in the presence of one contractile state, gamma, is smaller than or equal to 1, the possibility that one contractile state is involved in this series is rejected. On the other hand, when two contractile states are involved, the slope that the two successive beats create on the SV-EDV plane, gamma, is determined by connecting the two SV-EDV relations. This slope tends to be greater than 1. Thus, in these 51 series, SMA cannot be explained as a result of the Frank-Starling mechanism and variations in FV but as a result of two alternating contractile states. In the other four series, the value of gamma can be compatible either with the presence of one contractile state or with two alternating contractile states. This quantitative analysis enables the classification of the various types of SMA into subcategories with well-defined features. The quantitative analysis presented here shows that the common genesis of SMA is an alternating contractile state.\r"

However, an \"alpha 1-like\" transcript was detected using polymerase chain reaction with two sets of primers constructed to selected areas of the rat alpha 1-cDNA. These data suggest that beta-mRNA in canine blood vessels is in large excess of the alpha 1-mRNA. This discrepancy may be reflected in the relatively low number of Na+ pump sites in this tissue.\r"

  ".W": "When an automatic defibrillator is implanted, it is essential to determine the efficacy of the defibrillating system accurately, while balancing the need to keep the number of fibrillation episodes to a minimum. Two methods have evolved to assess defibrillation efficacy: 1) the \"defibrillation threshold,\" which requires few ventricular fibrillation episodes, and 2) the \"dose-response curve,\" which requires many ventricular fibrillation episodes and relates percent success to energy. The purpose of this study was to compare these two methods directly. Twenty open-chest anesthetized pigs had triplicate defibrillation threshold determinations. To produce a dose-response curve, six shocks then were delivered at 0.5, 0.75, 1.0, 1.25, 1.5, and 2.0 times the mean defibrillation threshold, in a balanced randomized order, during separate episodes of ventricular fibrillation. The data were fitted by logistic regression, conversions of the logistic regression, and a saturable exponential and nonsaturable growth exponential. A comparison was made of the mean defibrillation threshold and the 50% point on the dose-response curve (ED50) for each model, for each animal. In addition, the reliability of each measure was assessed by comparing the coefficients of variation. There was no statistical difference between the group defibrillation threshold (6.6 +/- 0.5 J) and group ED50 values (ED50 range of the models, 5.7 +/- 1.9 to 7.0 +/- 0.9 J). However, the variability about the defibrillation threshold was less than that of the ED50 values for all mathematical models except the true logistic equation, which was virtually the same.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Cardiac output, left ventricular function, and right ventricular function were evaluated before obtaining isolated myocytes for cell size measurements. Average heart weight increased 35% at 1 week and 86% at 1 month in rats with fistulas. In general, myocyte hypertrophy was due to a proportional increase in length and width (length/width ratio remained constant). This change was more evident in the large hearts from rats with 1-month fistulas. At both the 1-week and 1-month intervals, the hypertrophic response of right ventricular myocytes was slightly greater than that observed in the left ventricle or interventricular septum. Left ventricular systolic pressure and dP/dtmax were significantly reduced at 1 week but returned to normal after 1 month of overloading. Left ventricular end-diastolic pressure was increased approximately fivefold and twofold at 1 week and 1 month, respectively. Right ventricular systolic pressure and dP/dtmax were increased at both intervals examined. We conclude that severe volume overloading from a large aortocaval fistula in the rat is characterized by 1) depressed left ventricular function at 1 week followed by a large compensatory hypertrophy and near normal function at 1 month, 2) right ventricular pressure overload, and 3) changes in myocyte shape that resemble normal physiological growth.\r"

Subsequently, isolated cardiac myocytes were collected from the left ventricle, right ventricle, and septum for cell size measurements. Compared with sham-operated controls, percent dry weight was reduced in the liver and kidney but was unchanged in the lung. Heart rate, left ventricular systolic pressure, left ventricular dP/dtmax, and systolic aortic pressure were not changed in rats with fistulas. However, cardiac output, stroke volume, left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, and all measured parameters in the right ventricle were significantly increased. Mean cell volume and the ratio of heart weight to body weight were both elevated 92%. Cell volume, cell length, and cross-sectional area increased significantly in each heart region examined. Hypertrophy was more pronounced in cells from the right ventricle and the endomyocardium of the left ventricle. The percentage of cells with mononucleation or binucleation was not changed in any heart region of rats with fistulas. In summary, despite evidence of renal and hepatic congestion, most indexes of cardiac function were normal or elevated 5 months after creation of a large volume-overload-induced hypertrophy. Data from isolated cardiac myocytes suggested that cellular hypertrophy, rather than hyperplasia, was responsible for the increased cardiac mass.\r"

  ".W": "A controversial issue in exercise physiology is the relative contribution of central command versus afferent input from contracting muscles and baroreceptors in the regulation of sympathetic nerve activity (SNA) during exercise. Recent studies of exercising humans have suggested that central command increases cutaneous sympathetic sudomotor nerve activity but have challenged the concept that central command contributes importantly to increases in sympathetic vasoconstrictor nerve activity to skin and skeletal muscle. The purpose of this study was to examine the influence of central command on renal SNA and lumbar SNA during spontaneous locomotion in decorticate cats. Unanesthetized decorticate cats that developed locomotion spontaneously or during electrical stimulation of the subthalamic locomotor region were studied in the presence and absence of input from skeletal muscle and baroreceptor afferents. Spontaneous rhythmic locomotion in the unparalyzed state was associated with significant increases in mean arterial pressure (MAP) from 106 +/- 10 to 133 +/- 11 mm Hg (p less than 0.05) and increases in renal SNA of 301 +/- 100% (p less than 0.05). During spontaneous fictive rhythmic locomotion in paralyzed cats, there were also significant (p less than 0.05) increases in MAP (43 +/- 6%), renal SNA (183 +/- 32%), and lumbar SNA (223 +/- 83%). Baroreceptor denervation did not attenuate increases in MAP, renal SNA, and lumbar SNA during locomotion. During electrical stimulation of the subthalamic locomotor region in paralyzed cats, MAP increased by 43 +/- 17% (p less than 0.05), and renal SNA increased by 175 +/- 47% (p less than 0.05). These findings indicate that central command is capable of increasing sympathetic neural drive in unanesthetized decorticate cats. This increase in sympathetic drive occurs even in the absence of feedback from contracting muscles or from arterial and cardiopulmonary baroreceptors.\r"

  ".W": "We sought to determine the effects of acidic fibroblast growth factor (FGF) on ischemic and normal myocardium and to determine whether direct application of acidic FGF to the heart could promote angiogenesis. Eighteen dogs underwent placement of an ameroid constrictor on the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD). Three weeks later, a left internal mammary artery (IMA) pedicle was positioned over the LAD territory, with a sponge saturated with acidic FGF (n = 12) or saline (n = 4) interposed between the pedicle and the heart. Polytetrafluoroethylene fiber or collagen I sponges were used to deliver the acidic FGF. Weekly angiography of the IMA was performed in all dogs, but significant IMA to coronary collaterals were not demonstrable in any dog. Eight dogs had histological evidence of subendocardial infarction in the LAD territory (five acidic FGF, three control, p = NS). Striking smooth muscle cell hyperplasia was present in arterioles and small arteries exclusively in areas of subendocardial infarction in all of the acidic FGF-treated dogs but in none of the control dogs (p less than 0.05). Noninfarcted myocardium appeared normal in all dogs. In two additional dogs, ameroid constrictors were not placed on the LAD, such that acidic FGF-treated sponges were placed on normally perfused myocardium of the LAD territory. Histological evaluation of those hearts revealed normal myocardium, without evidence of myocardial infarction or smooth muscle cell hyperplasia. Thus, when acidic FGF is delivered to the myocardium via an epicardial sponge in dogs whose coronary flow is compromised, acidic FGF does not cause an angiogenic response in viable myocardium but causes vascular smooth muscle cell hyperplasia in areas subjected to ischemic injury.\r"

During this period, myofibrillar volume density declines sixfold as myofibrils are disassembled or degraded and are replaced by actin and alpha-actinin-positive, myosin-negative structures that resemble myofibrils but lack thick filaments. Such structures are termed minute myofibrils. The length of the sarcomeres in these altered myofibrils is significantly less than length values obtained from freshly isolated heart cells or from contracting myocytes. A number of high density cultures develop spontaneous, synchronous contraction during the second week of culture. Myofibrillar volume density is stabilized when beating begins, and no further decline is observed in the succeeding weeks of culture. Such contracting myocytes display myofibrils typical of normal heart with no visible evidence of minute myofibrils. The volume density of the transverse tubular system also declines significantly in both beating and nonbeating myocytes, and its reduction appears more closely correlated with cell spreading than with beating per se. No quantitative changes in volume density of mitochondria or sarcoplasmic reticulum could be documented, but the structural organization of the sarcoplasmic reticulum seems to be greatly influenced by the physiological state of the heart cell. The present observations document the importance of mechanical factors in regulating the integrity of the contractile apparatus in cardiac myocytes and emphasize the utility of the cultured heart cell to directly investigate structure-function relations in individual myocytes.\r"

Addition of either superoxide dismutase or MAbR15.7 protected against endothelial dysfunction. These results indicate that activated PMNs produce significant vasoconstriction and endothelial dysfunction in coronary arteries isolated from low-flow perfusion-reperfused hearts. These effects appear to be mediated primarily by superoxide radicals generated by activated PMNs that either inactivate or inhibit the synthesis and release of endothelium-derived relaxing factor. We conclude that activated PMNs are able to induce endothelial dysfunction by releasing free radicals and possibly other substances.\r"

MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Patients with septic shock and altered sensorium had higher circulating concentrations of ammonia (425 +/- 55 vs. 127 +/- 7 mmol/L) and the aromatic amino acids phenylalanine (122 +/- 19 vs. 74 +/- 3 mmol/L) and tryptophan (97 +/- 7 vs. 32 +/- 13 mmol/L), and lower levels of the branch-chain amino acid isoleucine (48 +/- 7 vs. 68 +/- 5 mmol/L) than patients with infections and normal sensorium (p less than .05). Aromatic amino acid levels correlated with APACHE II scores (R2 = .4, p less than .001) and mortality. APACHE II scores were higher in the septic shock patients (30 +/- 2 vs. 8 +/- 1, p less than .001), and these patients had a higher mortality rate (71% vs. 12%, p less than .01).

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE: To study efficacy and safety of hypertonic saline administration in the management of hyponatremic seizures. DESIGN: Retrospective, observational, cross-sectional study with factorial design. SETTING: In-patient population in a university hospital. PATIENTS: All children admitted with serum sodium concentrations less than 125 mmol/L. Sixty-nine episodes of severe hyponatremia in 60 children were reviewed. Forty-one of these children presented with seizures. INTERVENTIONS: Twenty-five of 41 seizure patients received an iv bolus of 4 to 6 mL/kg body weight of 3% saline. Twenty-eight patients were treated with a benzodiazepine and/or phenobarbital with or without the subsequent administration of hypertonic saline. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Thirteen treatment failures and ten instances of apnea occurred among the 28 patients treated with benzodiazepine/phenobarbital. Administration of hypertonic saline resulted in resolution of seizures and apnea in all cases. Those patients receiving 3% saline had a higher serum sodium increase rate from 0 to 4 hrs than the remaining patients (3.1 +/- 1.3 vs. 1.7 +/- 1.2 mmol/L.hr, p less than .01). None developed subsequent neurologic deterioration or clinical manifestations of osmotic demyelination syndrome. CONCLUSION: Treatment of hyponatremic seizures with routine anticonvulsants may be ineffective and is associated with a considerable incidence of apnea. A rapid increase in the serum sodium concentration by 3 to 5 mmol/L with the use of hypertonic saline is safe and efficacious in managing acute symptomatic hyponatremia.\r"

DESIGN: Prospectively collected previous database was examined by logistic regression analysis. SETTING: University medical center. PATIENTS: Sixty-two ICU patients. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The best stand-alone predictors for nosocomial pneumonia were bleeding from stress ulceration (p less than .001), the severity of illness present (p less than .001), and intramucosal acidosis in the stomach (p = .023), a metabolic indication of mucosal ischemia. Mechanical ventilation (p = .038) and the administration of antacids/cimetidine (p = .054) were also of stand-alone predictive value, but did not significantly improve the best predictive model for nosocomial pneumonia derived from the severity of illness present and the intramucosal pH in the stomach. CONCLUSIONS: The findings are consistent with the hypothesis that ischemic mucosal injury and its associated translocation of enteric bacteria and toxins might be more important in the pathogenesis of nosocomial pneumonia in the critically ill than the aspiration of contaminated nasopharyngeal secretions.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether oxygen consumption (VO2) is dependent on oxygen delivery (DO2) in adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and non-ARDS acute respiratory failure. DESIGN: Intervention study of a consecutive sample of patients admitted to the ICU with the diagnosis of acute respiratory failure. SETTING: Tertiary care center. PATIENTS: Thirteen consecutive patients with a diagnosis of ARDS and 11 with a diagnosis of respiratory failure not due to ARDS. Patients were monitored with an oximetric pulmonary artery catheter and mechanically ventilated. INTERVENTIONS: DO2 was decreased by the application of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) (20 cm H2O), and subsequently increased by an iv infusion of dobutamine (10 micrograms/kg.min). RESULTS: After the application of PEEP, DO2 decreased significantly in both groups. However, VO2 decreased significantly (p less than .01) only in the ARDS group. When dobutamine was infused, DO2 increased significantly (p less than .01) in both groups, but VO2 increased only in ARDS patients. DO2 correlated significantly with VO2 both in ARDS (r2 = .81, p less than .01) and in non-ARDS (r2 = .38, p less than .05) patients. The correlation coefficient was significantly higher for ARDS than for non-ARDS patients. Comparing the slopes of the regression lines, a stronger dependency of VO2 on DO2 was found in ARDS than in non-ARDS respiratory failure (p less than .001). The oxygen extraction ratio correlated with DO2 in non-ARDS patients (r2 = .49, p less than .05), but not in ARDS patients. CONCLUSIONS: VO2 is dependent on DO2 over a wide range of DO2 values in acute respiratory failure. This dependency phenomenon is much stronger in ARDS than in respiratory failure due to other causes. Due to the abnormal dependency of VO2 on DO2, changes in the oxygenation status may not be reflected by changes in mixed venous oxygen saturation in ARDS.\r"

Energy expenditure was measured by indirect calorimetry. SETTING: Medical ICU of The University of Texas Medical Branch Hospital, a university-based referral center. PATIENTS: Five uninjured critically ill patients. Four patients were hospitalized because of respiratory insufficiency and one because of myocardial infarction. Three patients died during their hospitalization. INTERVENTIONS: Metabolic studies were performed in each patient after an overnight (12-hr) fast. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Mean +/- SE glycerol and fatty acid rates of appearance were 4.5 +/- 1.0 and 11.5 +/- 0.8 mumol/kg.min, respectively. The ratio of fatty acid to glycerol rate of appearance was 2.9 +/- 0.5. Resting energy expenditure was 132 +/- 6% of predicted. CONCLUSIONS: An accelerated rate of lipolysis is part of the metabolic response to severe stress, regardless of its etiology. Because the rate of fatty acid release far exceeded energy requirements, fatty acids that were not oxidized as fuel were re-esterified to triglyceride, presumably in the liver.\r"

DESIGN: Retrospective review. SETTING: Tertiary neonatal ICU. PATIENTS: Four newborn patients with cardiorespiratory failure who developed signs of cardiac stun syndrome and electromechanical dissociation early in the ECMO course. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Initially, these patients had metabolic acidosis, chest roentgenograms showing pulmonary granularity and moderate cardiomegaly, and symptoms of severe respiratory distress. Cardiac dysfunction was apparent after ECMO was begun, with poor perfusion, pale color, narrow pulse pressure, and tachycardia despite normovolemia. Within 1 to 2 hrs, electromechanical dissociation occurred manifested by the absence of pulse pressure, palpable pulse, cardiac sounds, and apical impulse while on 50% to 70% bypass. All patients survived. INTERVENTIONS: Patients received ECMO, calcium gluconate, sodium bicarbonate, and dobutamine. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with cardiac stun syndrome have symptoms similar to severe respiratory distress syndrome, and may require ECMO support. In the ECMO patient, cardiac stun syndrome and electromechanical dissociation can be confused with low circuit volume, pneumothorax, or cardiac tamponade. Early recognition of electromechanical dissociation may improve care and outcome. Cardiac stun syndrome can be treated successfully with ECMO.\r"

The current study was performed to determine the role of cytokines and complement activation in the pathogenesis of endotoxin-induced mucosal injury and bacterial translocation, as well as to quantify the magnitude of endotoxin-induced intestinal mucosal permeability. RESULTS: The frequency of endotoxin-induced bacterial translocation was similar between normal outbred (88%), complement deficient (67%), and macrophage-hyporesponsive (55%) mice, indicating that neither complement nor macrophage activation is necessary for endotoxin-induced bacterial translocation to occur. As early as 2 hrs after endotoxin challenge, there was evidence of a greater than two-fold increase in ileal (p = .008) but not jejunal (p = .11) permeability as measured by the clearance of 51Cr EDTA. Both the increase in endotoxin-induced ileal permeability and the occurrence of bacterial translocation were largely prevented by pretreatment with allopurinol, a competitive inhibitor of xanthine oxidase. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that endotoxin-induced bacterial translocation, mucosal injury, and ileal permeability are mediated via activation of xanthine oxidase, and not through complement activation or the liberation of macrophage products.\r"

Arterial and renal venous free carnitine concentrations increased significantly in endotoxemia during the 5-hr experiment, but remained low and unchanged in the controls. Circulating acyl-carnitine concentrations underwent no essential changes in either group. Total, free, and acyl-carnitine concentrations decreased in endotoxic renal tissue. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that endotoxemia decreases carnitine concentrations in the renal cortex, but increases free carnitine concentrations in the circulation.\r"

Fourteen healthy adult cats (2.6 to 3.7 kg) without evidence of ocular disease were anesthetized with pentobarbital, paralyzed, and placed on mechanical ventilation. Direct continuous measurements of heart rate (HR), mean arterial pressure (MAP), CVP, CSF pressure, and intraocular pressure were recorded at zero end-expiratory pressure, and at 5, 10, and 15 cm H2O positive end-expiratory pressure, applied in random order. MAIN RESULTS: There were no significant changes in pHa, Paco2, HR, MAP, hematocrit, and temperature. Intraocular pressure increased significantly from 17 (during zero end-expiratory pressure) to 20 mm Hg at 10 cm H2O positive end-expiratory pressure; at 15 cm H2O positive end-expiratory pressure, intraocular pressure increased significantly to 21 mm Hg. CVP and CSF pressure increased significantly in parallel with intraocular pressure at 5, 10, and 15 cm H2O positive end-expiratory pressure. CONCLUSIONS: We speculate that similar responses occur in man, and may be undesirable in patients with already increased intraocular pressure, when higher levels of positive end-expiratory pressure are used.\r"

The aim of this study was to elucidate the potential of this new concept for treatment of profound hypovolemia and microcirculatory deterioration associated with sepsis and endotoxic shock. In a porcine model of acute hyperdynamic endotoxemia (elicited by continuous iv infusion of Salmonella abortus equi endotoxin for 3.5 hrs), small-volume resuscitation applying hypertonic-hyperoncotic solutions was analyzed for its effect on central hemodynamics, oxygen delivery (Do2), and regional blood flow. Fluid therapy was initiated when the pulmonary artery occlusion pressure (PAOP) tended to decrease (at 43 to 52 mins of endotoxemia), and consisted of 4 mL/kg bolus infusion of either 7.2% sodium chloride, 10% dextran, or 10% dextran in 7.2% sodium chloride; thereafter, PAOP was maintained by controlled infusion of 6% dextran-60. In a control group, 6% dextran-60 was given without preinjection of hypertonic-hyperoncotic solutions. RESULTS: On small-volume resuscitation, cardiac index significantly increased within 5 mins in all groups, while mean arterial pressure remained unchanged. Fluid requirements were significantly reduced after small-volume resuscitation and the hyperdynamic circulatory state was maintained until the end of the observation period; Do2 as well as blood flow to heart, kidneys, and splanchnic organs remained high. CONCLUSION: Small-volume resuscitation by means of hypertonic saline-dextran proved the most effective, and seems to be an attractive supportive therapy to prevent microcirculatory failure in sepsis and endotoxemia.\r"

Furthermore, to compare strategy-associated reproducibility with reference values obtained during long-term apnea. DESIGN: Crossover trial in patients; reference values from apneic animals. SETTING: University ICU and physiology laboratory. PATIENTS: Six consecutive male ICU patients (48 to 70 yrs) after major abdominal vascular surgery. Animals: two adult female sheep. INTERVENTIONS: Three ventilatory rates (8, 16, and 24 cycles/min) and 15-sec periods of apnea were selected for measurements in patients. In animals, continuous apnea was achieved with extracorporeal CO2 removal and apneic oxygenation. MEASUREMENTS: Measurements were performed using an appropriate pulmonary artery catheter and an ejection fraction/cardiac output computer prototype. The thermal indicator was injected automatically at four defined points of the ventilatory cycle, but triggered manually during apnea. MAIN RESULTS: At 8 cycles/min, there was a wide mean range of cyclic variable modulation, with a coefficient of variation of 11.6% and 23.2% for cardiac output and RV ejection fraction, respectively. Allowing for ventilatory phase or changing from 8 to 16 cycles/min reduced errors by half. Combining both procedures resulted in a coefficient of variation of 4.7% and 6.6% for cardiac output and RV ejection fraction, respectively. The best coefficient of variation values obtained during 15 secs of apnea in patients approached those variations in experimental apnea (coefficient of variation of 2.1% and 4.5% for cardiac output and RV ejection fraction, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: At low ventilatory rates, best results are achieved by averaging four phase-selected measurements. One-point measurements were less accurate and random point measurements less reproducible.\r"

SETTING: Voluntary community teaching hospital. PATIENTS: Fifteen patients, 78 +/- 6 (SD) yrs of age, admitted to the medical ICU over a 5-month period who had pulmonary artery catheters inserted as part of their routine care were studied. Thirteen patients were studied once, one patient twice, and one patient six times for a total of 21 sets of measurements. INTERVENTIONS: All patients had urinary bladder thermistor catheters inserted just before pulmonary artery catheterization. Simultaneous core temperatures were measured for the duration of pulmonary artery catheterization every 4 hrs by the pulmonary artery thermistor catheter, the bladder thermistor catheter, and by a tympanic membrane infrared probe set on its core temperature setting. The three devices were then compared with each other in vitro using a specialized constant water bath setup. Finally, two of the tympanic membrane infrared probes were compared with each other in 20 ambulatory emergency department patients. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Over 32 hrs of pulmonary artery catheterization, the pulmonary artery thermistor catheters and bladder thermistor catheters showed excellent agreement, with a bias of only -0.04 degrees C between the two. However, the bias comparing the tympanic membrane infrared probe with the pulmonary artery thermistor catheter was -0.38 degrees C, and the bias was -0.34 degrees C comparing the tympanic membrane infrared probe with the bladder thermistor catheter. The tympanic membrane infrared probe readings remained significantly higher than the pulmonary artery thermistor catheter or bladder thermistor catheter readings over the entire 32-hr period. The two tympanic membrane infrared probes compared with each other in emergency room patients showed excellent agreement (p less than .001). In the in vivo water bath setup, the tympanic membrane infrared probe on most of its settings again registered significantly (p less than .01) higher than both the pulmonary artery thermistor catheter and the bladder thermistor catheter. CONCLUSIONS: Pulmonary artery thermistor catheters and bladder thermistor catheters appear to give consistent, highly reliable bedside measurements of core body temperature in ICU patients. The currently available device that measures core body temperature from the tympanic membrane appears to give erroneously high readings, and should be used with caution.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of early excision and closure of burns on postburn hypermetabolism, measured as oxygen consumption (VO2). METHODS: Twelve patients with deep burns of 30% to 50% of total body surface underwent sequential excisions and wound coverage, beginning 1 to 3 days after burn. The majority of the deep burn was removed by day 7, but with the addition of a donor site area of 20% to 25% of total body surface. RESULTS: No decrease in VO2 was noted in relation to the percent removal of burn tissue. In addition, a transient further increase in VO2 was noted early after excision, especially with surgical procedures performed after 5 days. This response could not be attributed to wound manipulation-induced bacteremias. CONCLUSION: We conclude that early surgical excision and closure of burns in excess of 30% to 50% of total body surface do not decrease postburn hypermetabolism in proportion to the area closed. It is possible that remaining open wounds in the form of donor sites and nonexcised burn are sufficient to perpetuate the hypermetabolic process, once established.\r"

DESIGN: Logistic regression analysis of the different variables of the most important indices. SETTING: A general critical care medicine group practice in a university hospital. PATIENTS: A total of 630 critical care patients age 12 to 87 yrs were evaluated. The most important indices of severity of illness and the corresponding variables were recorded and the patient's course was followed for 3 months after ICU admission. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: One of our hypotheses was that the inclusion of an excessive number of variables to obtain the most common prognostic indices of mortality in critical care patients results in an underestimation of mortality and a redundancy of prognostic information. We performed a logistic regression analysis using the variables of the currently used indices of critical care prognosis: Acute Physiology Score, Simplified Acute Physiology Score, Acute Physiology Score-II, and Mortality Prediction Model. This mathematical approach resulted in a model of five variables: organ system failure, blood glucose, serum calcium, serum prothrombin activity, and serum osmolality. The score obtained from this model gave accurate prognostic criteria:sensitivity 91.2% and specificity 90%, using a cutoff point of 0.7; sensitivity 86% and, specificity 94%, using a cutoff point of 0.5. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that suitable statistical management of the discriminant prognostic variables allows reduction of the number of variables of the severity indices currently used, obtaining five more predictive variables.\r"

SETTING: A pediatric critical care unit. PATIENTS: Twelve patients age 2 days to 9 yrs and weighing 2.7 to 33 kg who required vasopressor therapy. Infusion rates for dobutamine ranged from 2 to 15 micrograms/kg.min. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Serum concentrations varied from 6.4 to 347 ng/mL (21 to 1151 nmol/L). Concentration was found to increase with dose. However, the relationship of clearance to steady-state concentration had a negative slope. Values for clearance varied from 32 to 625 mL/kg.min. Multiple analysis of variance on age, weight, and co-infused dopamine showed that these factors did not influence the relationship of clearance to steady-state concentration. Analysis to show an underlying model failed to differentiate Michaelis-Menten from nonlinear binding or mixed models on the basis of these data. CONCLUSIONS: Dobutamine pharmacokinetics do not appear to follow a simple linear model. Based on the current data, neither age nor the added infusion of dopamine affects the clearance of dobutamine.\r"

DESIGN: Retrospective review. SETTING: Surgical ICU patients in a Veterans Administration medical center. PATIENTS: Ten patients were studied from a total of 1,053 patients admitted to the surgical ICU between September 1985 and May 1989. INTERVENTIONS: Diagnostic abdominal paracentesis performed by the open or closed approaches. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Results are presented in three patient groups (A, B, and C): Group A (n = 4) had positive diagnostic abdominal paracentesis. Abdominal causes for the sepsis were found at reexploration. One of these four patients survived. Group B (n = 3) had negative diagnostic abdominal paracentesis. No abdominal septic source was found at reexploration; all three patients died. In group C (n = 3), diagnostic abdominal paracentesis was negative, patients were not reexplored, and all survived. Diagnostic accuracy correlated with three variables: a) the gross appearance and smell of the fluid, b) WBC count greater than 5000 or less than 500/mm3, and c) Gram stain demonstrating bacterial organisms. CONCLUSIONS: Diagnostic abdominal paracentesis proved accurate, reliable, simple, safe, and rapid in evaluating the abdomen in the postoperative septic patient. The use of this procedure should be considered in postoperative septic patients in whom an abdominal source for the sepsis needs to be excluded.\r"

DESIGN: A retrospective study in which logistic regression analysis was applied to data obtained during the first 144 hrs of ICU admission. SETTING: A university hospital medical ICU associated with a national AIDS treatment center. PATIENTS: Twenty-seven male patients with AIDS, P. carinii pneumonia, and respiratory failure who desired full supportive and resuscitative care. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Of 27 patients who met study criteria, 19 (70%) were nonsurvivors and eight (30%) were survivors. The relative risk of death was 2.2 times greater in patients who exhibited the combination of pH less than 7.35 and a base deficit greater than 4 mEq/L, at any time in their ICU course, than in patients who did not (95% confidence interval = 1.01, 4.81). Furthermore, the relative risk of death was 3.7 times greater in patients who required positive end-expiratory pressure greater than 10 cm H2O after 96 hrs of ICU care than in those patients who did not (95% confidence interval = 1.09, 12.33). Indices of oxygen transfer, severity of chest radiograph abnormalities, concurrent lung infections, and most laboratory studies on hospital admission were not different between the two groups nor predictive of hospital survival. CONCLUSIONS: When dealing with AIDS/P. carinii pneumonia/ICU patients, it is not possible to distinguish who will survive to hospital discharge based on information routinely available before ICU admission. Those patients with the greatest chance of survival demonstrate a significant decrease in the required level of respiratory support within the first 4 days of ICU care. The presence of a metabolic acidemia (pH less than 7.35 and base deficit greater than 4 mEq/L), at any time during the ICU course, is a poor prognostic sign. We suggest that such objective variables should be included in the development of any new outcome predictor model for this group of ICU patients.\r"

The implementation of such declarations for children is now possible in six states, including Texas, by specific statutory provisions. DESIGN: Retrospective study. SETTING: Pediatric ICU in a university hospital. PATIENTS: Records of patients who had a Texas Natural Death Act declaration, either discussed and signed or discussed only, were studied. Patients who had another vehicle of limiting care (e.g., a do-not-resuscitate order) were excluded from the study. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Reviewed characteristics included age, primary diagnosis, and concurrent complications. Also examined were who raised the issue of limiting care (parent or physician), the initial reaction of the other party, what support was withdrawn, what support was added, the final outcome (including the time from implementing limited care to death), and the description of witnesses. Discussions were held with parents of 17 patients, and 13 Natural Death Act declarations were actually implemented. In all but three instances, the patient died within 4 hrs from the time support was withdrawn. The main supports that were withdrawn were ventilators and catecholamines. In half of the cases, morphine sulfate was added for anticipated pain relief and sedation. All decisions were reached by close consultation between the family and the physicians, with the physicians raising the issue in 11 of the 17 cases and the family raising the issue in six cases. In 15 of the 17 patients, consultation with the Bioethics Committee was not necessary. The majority of difficulties involved resolving issues that beset patients with HIV infections, and finding appropriate witnesses as prescribed by the statute. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the Natural Death Act works well in situations involving dying children and their parents.\r"

SETTING: A medical ICU service of a military referral hospital. PATIENTS: All adult medical ICU patients were evaluated during a 12-month period. Of 464 admissions, 28 (6%) were found to have acquired a pneumothorax during their medical ICU stay. INTERVENTIONS: Nineteen (67.9%) patients with pneumothorax were diagnosed correctly on initial presentation of their pneumothorax. The remaining nine (32.1%) patients' pneumothoraces were misdiagnosed at initial presentation. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Tension pneumothorax occurred more frequently in patients with an initially misdiagnosed pneumothorax (33.3%) than in patients with pneumothoraces that were correctly diagnosed during their medical ICU stay (5.3%) (p less than .06). Thirteen variables chosen prospectively were examined using a chi-square statistic. The following four variables occurred statistically more often in nine patients with an initially misdiagnosed pneumothorax: a) mechanical ventilation required at the time of the development of pneumothorax (p less than .05); b) an atypical radiographic location of the pneumothorax (p less than .05); c) altered mental status exhibited at the time of pneumothorax presentation (p less than .05); and d) development of pneumothorax after peak physician staffing hours (p less than .02). CONCLUSIONS: Certain medical ICU patients appear to be at higher risk for the initial misdiagnosis of pneumothorax. Familiarity with factors predisposing to this problem should allow for a higher index of suspicion for the diagnosis of pneumothorax in critically ill patients and possibly improve the early detection of pneumothorax.\r"

All patients gave their written informed consent to participate in the study. INTERVENTIONS: Lidocaine at a dose of 2 mg/kg, diluted with normal saline to a total volume of 10 mL, was administered to eight patients by instilling the drug solution from a 10-mL syringe directly into the outer aperture of the endotracheal tube. All other study patients received lidocaine under bronchoscopic control through the work channel of the bronchoscope either a) deep endotracheally, b) into the right main bronchus, or c) into the right lower lobe bronchus. At 10 points in time after drug administration, blood samples were taken for measurement of lidocaine plasma concentration (using high-pressure liquid chromatography) and blood gas analysis. MAIN MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Therapeutic blood concentrations (greater than or equal to 1.4 micrograms/mL) could be achieved and toxic blood concentrations (greater than or equal to 6 micrograms/mL) could be avoided with all methods of administration. No significant difference was found between the different methods with regard to peak concentration, time to peak, onset and duration of therapeutic levels, or relative bioavailability. A significant (p less than .05) decrease in PaO2 to 75% of the baseline was seen with all methods used. CONCLUSIONS: Because no route of lidocaine administration was superior to the others, the simplest method (instillation into the endotracheal tube) should be used.\r"

SETTING: Newborn ICU in a children's hospital. PATIENTS: Twenty-four newborn infants (1 to 28 days old) who required endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation for operative procedures or postoperative ventilatory support. INTERVENTIONS: Flow-volume curves obtained by manual inflation of the lungs, followed by forced deflation by negative pressure, and by passive expiration, under sedation and pharmacologic paralysis. MEASUREMENTS: Deflation flow-volume curves and passive expiratory curves were measured. Pulmonary function testing before and after bronchodilator administration (n = 11) began midway during the study period. Term and preterm groups served as controls. MAIN RESULTS: Forced vital capacity (FVC) was decreased in all groups with surgical disease as follows: abdominal wall defects and necrotizing enterocolitis groups to 48.3% and 62.1% that of preterm, respectively; pulmonary hypoplasia group to 55.5% that of term (p less than .05). Maximal expiratory flow at 25% of FVC decreased in all groups: abdominal wall defects and necrotizing enterocolitis group, to 36.8% and 37.9% that of preterm, respectively (p less than .05); pulmonary hypoplasia group, 20.0% that of term (p less than .05). The ratio of maximal expiratory flow at 25% of FVC divided by FVC was significantly decreased in necrotizing enterocolitis and pulmonary hypoplasia groups compared with that of preterm and term groups, respectively, but not in the abdominal wall defects group. Maximal expiratory flow at 25% of FVC, but not FVC, increased significantly (36%, p less than .05) after bronchodilator nebulization, indicating the presence of airway reactivity. Respiratory system compliance was decreased significantly (p less than .05) in all surgical disease groups compared with the term group. CONCLUSIONS: Bronchial reactivity contributes to decreased maximal expiratory flow at 25% of FVC, a feature also seen in premature infants with respiratory distress syndrome who later develop bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Babies who require chronic ventilatory support after operation and who have developed reactive airways may benefit from the administration of bronchodilators during postoperative ventilatory management.\r"

Systolic BP by pulse oximetry was measured by observing the return of the plethysmographic waveform of the pulse oximeter as the BP cuff ipsilateral to the pulse oximeter probe was slowly deflated. Arterial occlusion pressure was measured by observing the return of the intraarterial waveform as the BP cuff ipsilateral to the arterial cannula was slowly deflated. SETTING: The study was performed during patient transport, intraflight. PATIENTS: Ten critically ill patients were studied. INTERVENTIONS: None MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Seventy-three sets of measurements were recorded. The best correlation (r2 = .99) was found between pulse oximetry and the arterial occlusion method. The indirect methods correlated better with each other than with direct intraarterial measurements. The noise and the vibrations of the helicopter did not significantly interfere with the operation of the pulse oximeter.

If apnea occurs in patients with myocardial infarction, hypoxemia induced by apnea might exaggerate insufficiency of oxygen supplied to the damaged myocardium. DESIGN: Prospective controlled study. SETTING: Critical care unit of a teaching hospital. PATIENTS: Forty-nine patients, average age 64 yrs (range 49 to 91). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Patient measurements were recorded on a polygraph using an apnea-monitor, pulse oximeter, pulmonary artery pressure monitor, and an ECG. All of the patients observed showed frequent apneic episodes. The apnea was especially frequent when the cardiac index was low. Capillary oxygen saturation of less than 90% (suggesting systemic hypoxia) was observed in 21 patients concomitantly with apnea. Occasionally, arrhythmias followed these episodes (premature supraventricular contractions [n = 10], premature ventricular contraction [n = 4], and ventricular tachycardia [n = 2]). CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that sleep apnea is common in the setting of acute myocardial infarction. It may be a factor predisposing to, or even causing, sudden death in patients with acute phase of myocardial infarction.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVES AND METHODS: Histamine2 (H2)-receptor antagonists and antacids have been the basic drugs for the prevention of stress bleeding in ICU patients during the past decade. Recently, drugs without major influence on gastric pH have been investigated in stress bleeding prophylaxis. Therefore, a meta-analysis (Mantel-Haenszel test) was undertaken to determine the efficacy of sucralfate in the prevention of macroscopically visible stress bleeding, as well as the influence of sucralfate on the frequency of pulmonary infections. RESULTS: The efficacy of sucralfate was compared with H2-antagonists in nine studies and with antacids in eight studies. Sucralfate was significantly more effective than H2-antagonists (typical odds ratio 0.532, 95% confidence interval 0.303 to 0.933) and equally as effective as antacids (typical odds ratio 0.868, 95% confidence interval 0.452 to 1.667). The pneumonia rates of those patients who were administered sucralfate were compared with the rates of those patients who were given H2-antagonists in five studies and with those patients who were given antacids in four studies. Pneumonia was a significantly more frequent occurrence under prophylaxis with H2-antagonists (typical odds ratio 0.498, 95% confidence interval 0.316 to 0.783) as well as with antacids (typical odds ratio 0.402, 95% confidence interval 0.235 to 0.687). CONCLUSION: Sucralfate is an effective drug for the prevention of stress bleeding that minimizes the risk of nosocomial pneumonia in long-term ventilated ICU patients.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND AND METHODS: To test the hypothesis that the effect of steroids on hydrochloric acid aspiration may be involved in the metabolism of eicosanoids, we investigated the effects of an iv bolus of prednisolone on the metabolism of 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid and 11-dehydrothromboxane B2 (11-dehydro-TxB2) in the rat model of acid aspiration. Wistar rats were randomly selected for three groups and treated with either a) an iv bolus of saline after intratracheal injection of saline (control group), b) an iv bolus of saline after intratracheal injection of acid (acid-saline group), or c) an iv bolus of prednisolone after intratracheal injection of acid (acid-prednisolone group). The concentrations of 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid and 11-dehydro-TxB2 in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid were measured by radioimmunoassay. RESULTS: The concentration of 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of either acid-saline group (804 +/- 129 pg/mL) or acid-prednisolone group (748 +/- 112 pg/mL) was significantly greater than that of the control group (143 +/- 27 pg/mL, p less than .01) 1 hr after the administration. The iv bolus of prednisolone caused a significant decrease in 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (acid-saline group 1027 +/- 43 pg/mL; acid-prednisolone group 514 +/- 62 pg/mL; p less than .01) and cell counts of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid 48 hrs after intratracheal injection of acid, while there was no significant change in 11-dehydro-TxB2. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that corticosteroid administration may contribute to the inhibition of the inflammatory process of lungs after acid aspiration by decreasing the release of 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid in the distal lung unit.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND AND METHODS: We studied the effect of volume resuscitation on lung fluid balance and systemic oxygen extraction during septic shock in eight anesthetized dogs. Sepsis was induced using a 2-hr continuous infusion of Escherichia coli endotoxin at 0.25 micrograms/min.kg. Relationships between oxygen uptake (VO2) and oxygen supply (DO2) were performed acutely during stepwise controlled decrements in cardiac output by progressive inflation of an intracardiac balloon. At each stage, DO2 and corresponding VO2 were measured independently and the individual critical DO2 level was referred to as the point below which the relationship held. The slope of such a constructed relationship was defined as the maximal oxygen extraction ratio. Lung fluid balance was assessed by measurements of extravascular lung water. All values were studied at baseline, after endotoxin insult, and after reversing hypotension by a 10% dextran infusion. RESULTS: Endotoxin infusion led to a shock state that associated hypotension (from 135 to 63 mm Hg) with increases in blood lactate (from 0.53 to 3.9 mmol/L). The mean critical DO2 and maximal oxygen extraction ratio were significantly altered from 7.9 to 17.8 mL/min.kg and from 0.81 to 0.38, respectively. After reversing hypotension by 28 mL/kg colloid infusion, the critical DO2 (11.4 mL/min.kg) and maximal oxygen extraction ratio (0.48) were significantly improved. However, restoration of normal values required a state of fluid overload by further dextran infusion (8 mL/kg). At the end of the fluid challenge, extravascular lung water significantly increased from 6.4 to 17.4 mL/kg. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that volume loading may reverse endotoxin-induced peripheral perfusion abnormalities. However, substantial pulmonary edema may occur, possibly jeopardizing the beneficial effects of fluid expansion.\r"

This procedure achieves excellent mechanical preparation of the colon, facilitates safe anastomosis, and avoids the disadvantages associated with multistaged operations. At our institution, 25 patients requiring urgent segmental resection of the left colon have undergone intraoperative colonic lavage. Primary anastomosis without fecal diversion has been performed in 21 of these patients. Obstruction of the large intestine was the indication for operation in 56 percent of the patients in this series. Ten patients (40 percent) required laparotomy for an acute intra-abdominal inflammatory process. No post-operative deaths have occurred in our series, and no patient has sustained clinically evident anastomotic leakage. A pelvic abscess developed in one patient after sigmoid colectomy for diverticulitis. Three patients required treatment for wound infection. Based on our results, we recommend resection with intraoperative colonic lavage and primary anastomosis as the preferred treatment for the majority of patients requiring nonelective segmental left colon resection.\r"

  ".U": "91275675\r", 
  ".W": "In order to decrease the urinary and sexual morbidity which follows radical pelvic lymphadenectomy for rectal cancer, we began selective preservation of the pelvic autonomic nerves. Between 1985 and 1987, 134 patients with rectal cancer underwent a curative resection (52 abdominoperineal resections, 82 sphincter-saving resections) with extended pelvic lymphadenectomy and selective pelvic autonomic nerve preservation (PANP). PANP was classified into five degrees depending on the extent of pelvic dissection. First-degree PANP indicates complete preservation of the nerves; second-degree PANP indicates destruction of the hypogastric plexus: third-degree PANP indicates partial preservation of the pelvic autonomic plexus; fourth-degree PANP indicates bilateral or unilateral preservation of only the fourth pelvic parasympathetic nerve; and fifth-degree PANP indicates complete destruction of the pelvic autonomic nerves. Most patients with first-degree PANP were able to spontaneously void 7-10 days following the operation. However, 78 percent (28/36) of patients with fifth-degree PANP had not regained bladder sensation by the third postoperative week and were discharged with an indwelling catheter; 58 percent (21/36) had not regained bladder sensation by the 60th postoperative day. The cystometric data indicate a progressive decline in bladder sensation and function with increasingly extensive pelvic dissection. However, preservation of only the fourth parasympathetic nerve (fourth-degree PANP) resulted in partial sparing of bladder sensation and voiding function. Evaluation of sexual function in males under 60 years of age revealed that only 31 percent (12/39) recovered erectile function and only 19 percent (6/39) recovered normal ejaculatory function in the first postoperative year. Most of these patients had complete preservation of their pelvic autonomic plexus (i.e., first-degree PANP). Four patients with partial PANP have recovered erectile function. Complete PANP is the best way to prevent urinary and sexual morbidity after rectal resection. The opposing goals of maximizing the chance for cure and minimizing morbidity must be individualized and balanced in each patient. Our data demonstrate that it is now possible to perform radical pelvic lymphadenectomy in the majority of patients with advanced rectal cancer with a minimum of voiding dysfunction. Preservation of sexual function in males is more difficult and depends on complete PANP and, as such, should be restricted to the group of patients with Dukes' A and B carcinomas.\r"

Fifteen patients underwent TES. An initial clinical and manometric assessment was carried out before and 1 month after the procedure. A psychologic evaluation was also performed by means of interviews and appropriate tests. Early improvement of symptoms was noted in 10 patients. The nonresponders were women with gross daily incontinence to solid stool. At anal manometry, resting tone and rectal sensation remained unchanged, whereas a significant increase of voluntary contraction was observed following TES (from 48 +/- 26 to 59 +/- 39 mm Hg, P = 0.03). Psychologically, TES led to a significant decrease of both latent and paranoid anxiety related to symptoms (P = 0.02). At a clinical reassessment 6 months later, one of the nonresponders became continent after a further course of TES. In conclusion, TES is well accepted by the patients, is followed by positive emotional response, and, by improving striated sphincter function, seems to be effective in the treatment of partial fecal incontinence.\r"

Half had been prospectively, randomly allocated to receive a 4-day schedule of preoperative pelvic radiotherapy followed by immediate surgery. There was a significant (P less than 0.01) difference in the distribution of tumors of various histopathologic grades between irradiated (XS) and unirradiated (S) patients and borderline differences in the predictive values of venous spread, tumor grading, and local spread. However, these differences were less marked in 180 tumors examined by one review pathologist. They were thought to be due to misinterpretation of changes induced by radiotherapy. No differences were detected in the distribution of tumors of various sizes and Dukes' stage in the XS and S groups. The review pathologist recorded a borderline (P = 0.049) difference in the distribution of tumors of various CEA staining patterns between the XS and S groups. In a Cox regression model. Dukes' staging remained the most important predictive variable for survival and pelvic recurrence in the XS and S groups. Dukes' staging was apparently unchanged by this schedule of preoperative radiotherapy, but Broders' grading may be unreliable. Any new clinicopathologic staging system for colorectal cancer should record when preoperative radiotherapy is delivered. More studies of radiotherapy effects are required.\r"

From the present studies, the genomic source of the adenomatous colonic lines appear to modify the effect of increased calcium on mucosal growth as demonstrated by differences in growth response in lines with and without the biomarker associated with genetic predisposition for some colon cancers, increased in vitro tetraploidy. Such observations suggested that other factors, including genomic differences, should be taken into consideration in the determination of the possible influences of calcium concentration on colonic mucosal proliferation.\r"

Nine of these were found to have Crohn's disease after histopathologic review of the colectomy specimens. Of the 46 patients with ulcerative colitis remaining for evaluation, two died postoperatively. Twenty-five patients were subsequently reoperated with rectal excision owing to intractable inflammatory activity (n = 22, one postoperative death) or owing to dysplasia (n = 3). Of 19 patients with their IRA still intact at time of follow-up, 15 patients (median disease duration 23 years) had a flexible sigmoidoscopy with multiple biopsies performed. The average length of the remaining rectum and sigmoid colon was 26 cm. No patient had findings of dysplasia, carcinoma, or DNA aneuploidy. None of the four remaining patients had developed dysplasia or carcinoma at the time of the latest regular rigid sigmoidoscopy. The risk of malignant transformation in this selected group of patients with ulcerative colitis operated upon with colectomy and IRA derived from an epidemiologically defined population seems to be low.\r"

The intrinsic PGE2 levels of the noncancerous mucosa were thus significantly higher for the MNNG group than for the control group at all weeks. At 40 weeks, the PGE2 levels of cancer lesions were significantly high compared with those of the noncancerous area. In the cancerous lesions, 6-keto-PGF1 alpha and PGF2 alpha decreased and TXB2 increased significantly at 40 weeks. The observations demonstrated that PGE2 was implicated as a promoter in the development and proliferation of carcinoma in MNNG-induced large bowel carcinogenesis in rats.\r"

In the present study we wanted to center our attention on electromechanical activities accompanying large evacuations via the colostomy, as we believe that they are an expression in myoelectric and pressure terms of the \"mass phenomenon\" described by radiologists. To do this, we designed an electromyographic recording probe to which we attached a conventional microtransducer probe, joining them by suction. With this method we made 24-hour recordings in eight patients with sigmoid colostomy. We witnessed five large evacuations. When the electric and pressure activities that occurred a few minutes before the evacuation were analyzed, we observed that there were two clearly different phases. The first, which we call \"Preliminary Phenomenon,\" consists of a series of contractions and spiking potentials averaging 5.6 minutes (SD 2.22); after this the \"Big Contraction\" appears, with mean pressure values of 127 mm Hg (SD 38.77) and mean electric values of 10.6 mV. The duration of this phenomenon averaged 24.93 seconds (SD 6.19), recorded almost simultaneously at the three recording sites studied. There is no doubt that these electro-pressure phenomena resulted in a mass transport, as we observed an intense evacuation via the colostomy in the five patients.\r"

  ".W": "Although numerous etiologic risk factors have been proposed, the pathogenesis of hemorrhoids remains unknown. The present investigation assesses the temporal distribution of hemorrhoids as depicted by physician visits, hospital discharges, and surgical procedures to provide further insight into potential etiologic risk factors. The analysis was based on five data sources: from the United States, the National Disease and Therapeutic Index (NDTI), the National Hospital Discharge Survey (NHDS), and the Commission on Professional Hospital Activities (CPHA); from England and Wales, the Morbidity Statistics from General Practice (MSGP) and the Hospital In-patient Enquiry (HIPE). Results demonstrated a consistent decline in all data sources from the United States. The decrease occurred in males and females similarly and was most striking in those aged 45-64 years. Physician visits and hospital discharges for hemorrhoids in England and Wales likewise declined although the decrease was not as dramatic. The consistency of the temporal distributions among the two countries, as well as among the different sources, suggests that the observed decline may, in fact, reflect an overall decrease in the occurrence of hemorrhoidal disease.\r"

  ".W": "A new aseptic colon resection by an invagination technique is presented. The bowel to be resected is invaginated down into the healthy intestine, and the anastomosis is sutured in one layer of continuous suture before transection by a diathermy wire, placed in the intestinal lumen via the anus. Sections of bowel that cannot be invaginated, e.g., because of a tumor, are first removed by transection between pairs of cable ties, which close the lumen. Twenty dogs were operated on without receiving prophylactic antibiotics. In 10, the intestine was transected between cable ties. An imprint, taken from the anastomosis and subcutis, was cultured. The bacterial count at the anastomosis exceeded 100 in only three cases; in the subcutis, this was the case in one dog. One wound infection developed. Serial barium enemas at 1, 2, 3, and 4 weeks revealed no anastomotic leakage. One early death because of a total anastomotic dehiscence was encountered, and two dogs were killed because of wound dehiscence and anastomotic stricture, respectively. It is concluded that, in dogs, the method is easily and safely performed, but further experimental studies are needed.\r"

We conducted a pilot study to determine the efficacy of its use in palliating advanced rectal cancer, to determine toxicity, and to establish objective outcome criteria. Six patients with very advanced, usually recurrent rectal cancer were treated with PDT after being photosensitized with Photofrin II. A protocol was established to measure clinical and radiologic response to therapy. A new intraluminal delivery system was incorporated. Five patients had both clinical and radiologic responses to therapy. In two patients we observed such significant responses that they cannot be accounted for on a photobiologic basis alone. One patient developed a significant sunburn after discharge. There was no major toxicity of bleeding or sepsis even at maximum doses (200 J/cm2). We are confident that PDT has a role to play in rectal cancer and speculate as to future applications.\r"

Patients underwent concentric needle electromyography (EMG), bilateral pudendal nerve terminal motor latency evaluation, anorectal manometry, and cinedefecography. The most common EMG finding in patients with fecal incontinence was decreased recruitment of motor units with squeezing and polyphasic motor unit potentials; these are consistent with an injury pattern. The most common EMG finding in the constipated patients was paradoxical puborectalis contraction. This latter abnormality was also a frequent finding in patients with rectal pain, as was prolongation of pudendal nerve latency. Paradoxical puborectalis contraction was diagnosed more frequently with EMG than with cinedefecography. Inter-examination correlation was best in the incontinent group between EMG and manometry. Cinedefecography had poor correlation with EMG in all patient groups but was valuable in the detection of additional pathology such as rectoanal intussusception and anterior rectocele. Electromyography including pudendal nerve terminal motor latency assessment is a valuable adjunct in the evaluation of disorders of evacuation. The information it yields is complementary to that offered by more routine physiologic examinations.\r"

The animals were divided at random into two groups (test and control). The animals in the test group were given intramuscular injections of diclofenac sodium at the dose of 3 mg/kg body weight at 24-hour intervals, and the control animals were given injections of an identical amount of 0.9 percent saline. The animals were sacrificed on the 3rd, 7th, and 14th postoperative days for macroscopic evaluation of the peritoneal cavity and of the anastomoses, tensile strength measurement, hydroxyproline determination, and histopathologic examination. The following results were observed: anastomotic dehiscence followed by peritonitis and death in five test animals (20.83 percent) and no control animals; decreased anastomotic tensile strength on the 7th day in test animals (P less than 0.05); delayed acute inflammatory response and onset of fibroblast proliferation in the test group; and similar hydroxyproline levels in both groups. On the basis of the results obtained, we conclude that diclofenac sodium had a negative effect on intestinal anastomotic healing.\r"

  ".W": "Vasopressin (VP) neurons in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) and medial amygdala (AME) are sensitive to changes in circulating levels of testosterone (T). To determine whether these cells are responsive to changes in glucocorticoid levels, in situ hybridization and quantitative autoradiography were used to measure VP mRNA in cells of the BNST and AME in rats that were adrenalectomized (ADX; 14 days) or ADX with dexamethasone (DEX) replacement. These treatments produced the predicted changes in VP gene expression in the medial parvocellular group of the paraventricular nucleus. The VP mRNA content within cells of the BNST or AME was unaffected by adrenalectomy. Treatment with DEX significantly decreased both the number and labeling intensity of VP cells in the BNST and AME. Measurement of plasma T in these animals showed that DEX treatment significantly lowered mean T levels compared with those in either sham-operated or ADX animals. Adrenalectomy alone did not significantly alter T levels. To determine whether DEX influenced VP gene expression via a glucocorticoid action or secondarily by a suppression of T, the above experiment was repeated with groups that were castrated and implanted with Silastic capsules containing T to maintain physiological levels of T. Administration of DEX again decreased both VP cell number and labeling intensity of cells in the BNST and AME in sham-implanted animals. However, VP gene expression was unaffected in those animals that received T capsules. Administration of corticosterone did not alter T levels or the number of cells in the BNST or AME. These results suggest that, in contrast to paraventricular nucleus neurons, adrenalectomy (14 days) is not a potent stimulus in altering VP activity in the BNST or AME. The DEX-induced decrease in VP gene expression is mediated by a secondary suppression of T levels. These results support the finding that gonadal steroids are essential in maintaining the biosynthetic integrity of VP neurons in the BNST and AME.\r"

  ".W": "A major role for Ca2+ and calmodulin in stimulus-secretion coupling has been suggested for several neuropeptides; however, the cellular mechanisms of GH-releasing hormone (GHRH) release have been little investigated so far. We have used a previously validated acute rat hypothalamic explant system in order to elucidate whether Ca2+ acts as a second messenger in the regulation of GHRH release, and whether calmodulin-dependent pathways are involved. Calcium dependence of somatostatin (SRIH) release was assessed in the same experiments. Calmodulin dependence of SRIH was not investigated in detail, as it has been established previously. The calcium-entry antagonist, verapamil, antagonized K(+)-stimulated GHRH and SRIH release in a dose-dependent manner, with maximal inhibition shown at 10(-4) M. The calmodulin antagonist W7 also blocked K(+)-evoked GHRH release in a dose-dependent manner, with significant inhibition in the dose range 5 X 10(-5) M to 2 X 10(-4) M; similarly, a more specific calmodulin inhibitor, the W7 derivative 5-iodo-C8 (W8), reversed K(+)-stimulated GHRH release, showing slightly higher potency than W7. W7 also reversed GHRH release in response to the calcium-ionophore A23187, although verapamil had no effect on A23187-evoked GHRH or SRIH release. Thapsigargin, which increases the efflux of Ca2+ from calciosomes, did not affect either GHRH or SRIH release at 10(-5) M or 10(-4) M. The basal release of GHRH was clearly suppressed by W7 and W8 (10(-4) M), whereas verapamil had no effect. We conclude that calcium influx is crucial for depolarization-induced GHRH and SRIH release. Calcium entrance in response to A23187 appears to be independent of verapamil-sensitive calcium channels. The lack of effect of thapsigargin suggests that increased intracellular Ca2+ from intracellular stores is not equivalent to an increase in Ca2+ influx. Both basal and depolarization-induced release of GHRH in this system are calmodulin dependent.\r"

Proteins synthesized and released into medium were analyzed by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and fluorography. Patterns of protein production by these isolated membranes remained relatively unchanged from days 23-72 with the exception of the products of yolk sac, which regress by day 35 of pregnancy. In general, chorion was the source of a number of basic-to-neutral proteins; allantois and amnion were the sources of more acidic proteins; and yolk sac was the source of serum-like proteins. A major low mol wt acidic protein, D4, was produced by all membranes and present in fetal membrane fluids. Protein D4 consisted of three isoelectric variants (isoelectric point 5.3-6.1) with identical mol wts (23,000 +/- 800) and was shown to react immunologically with antibovine placental retinol-binding protein (RBP) serum. Hence, protein D4 is a putative ovine placental RBP. The present study is the first to characterize and compare protein production by isolated ovine chorionic, allantoic, amniotic, and yolk sac membranes from day 23 through midpregnancy and identify the major low mol wt acidic protein produced by each membrane as a placental RBP.\r"

These patterns of LH/CG receptor mRNAs are yet different from that observed in human embryonic kidney 293 cells that have been transfected with a cDNA encoding for the rat luteal LH/CG receptor. In spite of the diversity in the number and sizes of LH/CG receptor mRNA transcripts, however, our data also show that the size of the cell surface receptor expressed in these three cells/tissues is identical. We further show that the most abundant LH/CG receptor mRNA present in MA-10 cells, a clonal strain of cultured Leydig tumor cells, is a 1.2 kilobase transcript which encodes for a truncated version of the LH/CG receptor corresponding to the extracellular hormone-binding domain. It does not appear, however, that this transcript is translated into a functional protein.\r"

A selective release of PYY and enteroglucagon from the rabbit colon has been described, raising the question of the exact localization of the two hormones in the rabbit colon. We have therefore examined the distribution of PYY and enteroglucagon as well as somatostatin in the rabbit colon using RIA and electron microscopic immunocytochemistry. PYY and enteroglucagon were present in high concentrations in the colorectal mucosa with peak concentrations in the left colon (PYY 544 +/- 87 pmol/g, enteroglucagon 152 +/- 10 pmol/g). Electron microscopic examination of the colonic mucosa demonstrated a large population (65%) of EC cells, a moderate population (30%) of L cells, and a small population (5%) of D cells. By immunogold labeling serotonin was localized to EC cells, PYY and enteroglucagon to L cells, and somatostatin to the D cell. Double immunogold labeling revealed PYY and enteroglucagon in all L cells examined (93 cells). A majority of the secretory granules (83%) were labeled by both PYY and glucagon antibodies, whereas a significant portion of granules (15%) was labeled by the PYY antibodies alone. The results demonstrate that L cells are the sole source of PYY and enteroglucagon in the rabbit colon and that L cells contain different populations of secretory granules. The existence of different secretory granules in L cells may explain the selective release of PYY and enteroglucagon observed in the rabbit colon.\r"

  ".U": "91275763\r", 
  ".W": "Insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I and -II are known to play a major role in fetal and early postnatal growth. The IGF binding proteins (IGFBPs) are thought to be important in modulating the actions of the IGFs. In this paper, the effect of malnutrition in the neonatal rat on serum IGFs and IGFBPs and hepatic IGFBP messenger (m) RNA was examined. Control (C) dams (n = 9) were allowed ad libitum intake, whereas restricted (R) dams (n = 9) were limited to 50% of ad libitum intake throughout lactation, which results in decreased milk production and malnutrition of pups suckling on restricted dams. A subset of pups were cross-fostered from the R-dams to the C-dams from days 15-19 postpartum (PP) to investigate the effect of nutritional repletion (refed). Pups were killed on days 8, 12, 15, and 19 PP and liver and blood collected. Serum IGF-I and -II concentrations were measured by RIA after acid-chromatography to remove IGFBPs. Serum IGFBPs were characterized by Western ligand blot. Hepatic mRNA for IGFBP-1, -2, and -3 were determined by northern analysis. Body weight (BW) of R-pups was significantly less than C-pups by day 10 PP (P less than or equal to 0.05), and mean BW at day 19 was 56% of the C-pups. Refeeding from days 15-19 resulted in a significantly greater rate of growth vs. R-pups (3.2 vs. 0.9 g/day), and mean BW of refed pups at day 19 PP was 75% of C-pups. Malnutrition caused a significant reduction in both serum IGF-I and -II after day 12 PP, while causing an elevation in serum IGFBP-2. IGFBP-1 and IGFBP-2 mRNA expression were not significantly affected at days 8 and 12, but were elevated in livers of day 15 and 19 pups. Malnutrition caused a delay in the development shift from IGFBP-2 to IGFBP-3, which normally occurs between day 15 and 19 in the rat. Refeeding raised serum IGF-I and -II levels to those found in the C-pups and a trend toward normalization of IGFBP profiles. In conclusion, IGFs and IGFBPs are differentially regulated during neonatal malnutrition. The decrease in IGF peptide and induction of IGFBP-1 and -2 may provide protective mechanisms by inhibiting growth during malnutrition.\r"

  ".W": "The human myometrium, in addition to the decidualized endometrium of the late luteal phase and of pregnancy, has been proposed as a second source of uterine PRL, since immunoreactive PRL was found in supernatants from myometrial explant cultures. We demonstrate here that: 1) the human (h) PRL gene is expressed in the myometrium in vivo; 2) myometrial PRL is identical to pituitary hPRL; 3) the encoding transcript differs from pituitary hPRL messenger (m) RNA but is homologous to decidual and IM-9-P3 lymphoid hPRL mRNA; and 4) the expression of myometrial hPRL mRNA is inhibited by progestin. hPRL mRNA was detected in freshly isolated myometrium by Northern blot hybridization and was larger than the pituitary message. Sequence and primer extension analyses revealed that the transcript is identical to pituitary hPRL mRNA downstream of the pituitary cap site and carries an extension of the 5'-untranslated region homologous to that of decidual/IM-9-P3 lymphoid hPRL mRNA. This mRNA species results from alternative transcription initiation and comprises exon 1a of the hPRL gene, which is not transcribed in the pituitary. hPRL mRNA steady state levels and hPRL secretion increased dramatically when myometrial explants were maintained in long term culture. In addition to the 23,000 mol wt form, myometrial explants synthesized a glycosylated hPRL variant (G-hPRL) which was approximately 500 Daltons larger than pituitary G-hPRL but of similar size as lymphoid G-hPRL (26,500). Lactogenic activity of myometrial conditioned medium paralleled that of pituitary hPRL in the Nb2 lymphoma bioassay and was neutralized by the addition of monoclonal antibody to hPRL. hPRL secretion and hPRL mRNA abundance were not affected by estrogen but were markedly reduced by medroxy-progesterone acetate, which was maximally effective at a dose as low as 10(-10) M.\r"

  ".W": "Aldosterone selectivity in mineralocorticoid target tissues has been suggested to be due to 11 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11-OHSD), which, by inactivating the endogenous glucocorticoids cortisol and corticosterone (CS), would allow aldosterone to bind to the mineralocorticoid receptor that has equal affinity for aldosterone and natural glucocorticoids. However, a recent immunohistochemical study failed to colocalize 11-OHSD and mineralocorticoid receptors in the kidney. The goal of this study was to determine 1) whether metabolism of CS occurs in the renal target cells of aldosterone, i.e. in cortical collecting duct cells, and 2) if it does so, whether this activity is sufficient to reduce intracellular CS levels to allow binding of aldosterone to the mineralocorticoid receptor. Cortical collecting duct cells were isolated by solid phase immunoadsorption, with a cell purity of approximately 98%. Metabolism of CS was studied in both freshly isolated cells and primary cultures grown as monolayers on permeable supports. Freshly isolated cells rapidly converted CS to 11-dehydro-CS, which was the only major metabolite detected. In intact collecting duct cells 11-OHSD had an apparent Km for CS of approximately 60 nM, a value more than 100-fold lower than the Km of 11-OHSD in the rat liver, and a maximum velocity of approximately 1.7 x 10(-14) mol/min.1000 cells. In cultured cells, when [3H]CS was applied to one side of the monolayer, almost all radioactivity on the opposite side was 11-dehydro-CS. The cells were able to almost completely metabolize CS passing through them for up to a concentration of 2.5 x 10(-7) M. Carbenoxolone, an inhibitor of 11-OHSD, reduced CS degradation by 88%. Neither freshly isolated nor cultured collecting duct cells converted [3H]11-dehydro-CS back to CS in a significant amount (less than 1%). These data provide functional evidence for 11-OHSD activity in renal aldosterone target cells and indicate that this enzyme might be a collecting duct-specific isoform of 11-OHSD which can sufficiently reduce intracellular CS concentrations to contribute to the apparent mineralocorticoid selectivity of the collecting duct.\r"

  ".U": "91275767\r", 
  ".W": "A series of four experiments was conducted to examine the previously described phenomenon that the thyroid gland is required for the breeding season to end in female sheep. Exp 1 tested the hypothesis that the thyroid is required because of its secretion of T4. Ewes thyroidectomized (THX) in the anestrous season either received T4 replacement or no further treatment; seasonal reproductive shifts were compared to those of thyroid-intact controls. All ewes were housed in conditions in which the end of the breeding season results from the expression of an endogenous annual rhythm. The ewes were ovariectomized and given constant-release estradiol (E) implants; reproductive state was assessed from serum LH levels to monitor seasonal shifts in response to E negative feedback. THX did not alter onset of the breeding season (LH rise) but, in the absence of T4 replacement, blocked its end (LH fall). T4 replacement reversed this effect of THX. Exp 2 tested the hypothesis that the thyroid is required only until the onset of the breeding season for reproductive activity to end at its normal time. THX after the breeding season began, however, sustained the elevation in LH, suggesting that the thyroid is required after reproductive onset for the breeding season to end. Exp 3 tested the hypothesis that THX causes a widespread disruption of steroid feedback responses. No effect of THX, however, was observed with respect to either the ability of an E rise to elicit the LH surge or the ability of E, or progesterone, to suppress LH secretion in the breeding season. Of the steroid feedback responses tested, THX altered only the seasonal shift in potency of E negative feedback. Exp 4 examined circulating T4 in thyroid-intact ewes over a 2-yr period. An annual cycle of serum T4 was detected; values reached a peak in winter (late breeding season) and a nadir in summer (late anestrus). Our findings support the concept that the thyroid gland plays a fundamental role in seasonal reproduction in the ewe. In this regard, secretion of T4 after the onset of reproductive activity is required for an endogenously generated change in the neuroendocrine axis that leads to an intensified E negative feedback and an end to the breeding season.\r"

  ".U": "91275768\r", 
  ".W": "We have previously described a series of C-terminally-clipped forms of PRL, the 21-23.5K PRL-like molecules (PLMs). Because we noted estrogen (E2) induction of PLMs and E2 also induces a pituitary glandular kallikrein, we have investigated the possibility that processing of PRL by kallikrein is responsible for the production of the PLMs. Subcellular fractionation of pituitaries from control or E2-treated female rats showed total kallikrein to be concentrated 1- to 4-fold and 6- to 20-fold in the granules (vs. original homogenate) from control and E2-treated animals, respectively. Cleavage of purified PRL by kallikrein resulted in the formation of large quantities of a number of the PLMs. Incubation of secretory granules derived from control or E2-treated animals under the same conditions showed no cleavage of PRL in the absence of a limiting granule membrane and a small production of the PLMs in the presence of a granule membrane. Production in the latter instance was slightly greater in granules derived from E2-treated animals. Addition of purified kallikrein to secretory granules from control or E2-treated animals in the presence or absence of granule membranes, resulted in the additional production of large amounts of only the smallest PLM (PLM 9), indicating a lack of cleavage of the two most C-terminal sites for the enzyme. Increasing the concentration of beta-mercaptoethanol to 0.64 M, to ensure monomerization of the granule PRL, had no effect on endogenous kallikrein activity of the number of products resulting from the addition of exogenous kallikrein to granules. In summary: 1) purified kallikrein can cleave purified PRL to form products which run with the same isoelectric point and mol wt values as the PLMs; 2) kallikrein is present in PRL secretory granules; 3) some PLM production occurs in a membrane-bound secretory granule fraction, but none occurs after removal of the membrane; this intragranular production, like cleavage of purified PRL with purified kallikrein, is dependent on the presence of a detergent and a reducing agent; 4) cleavage of granular PRL by exogenous kallikrein is limited to a single site and the more C-terminal sites are protected; and 5) protection of the C-terminus is not removed by intermolecular and intramolecular disulfide bond reduction. We conclude: 1) that pituitary glandular kallikrein is a strong candidate for the enzyme responsible for the production of the PLMs, and 2) that there is some element of PRL storage, other than intermolecular disulfide bonds, which involves the C-terminus of the molecule.\r"

Ovulatory efficiency was significantly reduced when rabbit ovaries were perfused with human CG (hCG) plus nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA) at 10(-5) or 10(-6) M, as compared to contralateral hCG-treated controls. The addition of NDGA to the perfusate inhibited hCG-induced ovulation in a dose-related manner. The percentage of ovulated ova and follicular oocytes achieving germinal vesicle breakdown did not differ significantly between NDGA-treated ovaries and contralateral controls. Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) production by the perfused rabbit ovaries reached its maximum 6 h after exposure to hCG and then declined. The addition of NDGA at 10(-5) M significantly inhibited hCG-stimulated LTB4 production by rabbit ovaries throughout the entire perfusion periods. The ovulatory efficiency in ovaries treated with hCG alone or with hCG plus NDGA correlated significantly with LTB4 production by perfused rabbit ovaries 6 h after exposure to hCG (alpha = 0.8893, P less than 0.01). Furthermore, the addition of LTB4 at 100 ng/ml to the perfusate reversed the inhibitory effects of NDGA on hCG-induced ovulation. However, exposure to NDGA affected neither progesterone nor estradiol production elicited by hCG administration. These results suggest that NDGA may block hCG-induced ovulation in vitro, probably via the inhibition of LTB4 production by rabbit ovaries.\r"

  ".W": "These studies were undertaken to test the hypothesis that stimulation of the central noradrenergic and adrenergic pathways activates the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis in vivo in the conscious sheep. Blood samples were taken at 10-min intervals over 4 h to establish the baseline state, and then each animal received an intracerebroventricular (icv) injection of NaCl (control animals) or catecholamine [norepinephrine (NE) or epinephrine (EPI)]. A more frequent rate of venous sampling was used for the 30-min period after the icv injection, after which time the 10-min rate of blood sampling was continued for another 3.5 h. NaCl (n = 4) caused no change in pituitary-adrenal secretion. In contrast, 10 micrograms NE (n = 4) caused acute 1.9- and 3.2-fold increases in mean plasma ACTH and cortisol levels over the 1 h period post injection, and 1.6- and 2.3-fold increments in their concentrations over the 4 h postinjection period. Although 10 micrograms EPI (n = 4) did not elevate mean plasma ACTH, it produced significant 1.7- and 1.5-fold increases in plasma cortisol during the 1- and 4-h periods post injection. However, when 100 micrograms EPI was injected (n = 4), acute 9.5- and 5.5-fold increases in plasma ACTH and cortisol were seen over the 1 h period post injection, and 6.1- and 4.2-fold increments in their plasma concentration were noted during the entire post-injection period. To determine the predominant site of action of the catecholamines, we also examined the ability of NE and EPI to release ACTH from cultured ovine anterior pituitary cells. NE and EPI (10(-9)-10(-6) M) stimulated the release of ACTH in a dose-dependent manner, but with maximal increments only 1.5-fold greater than the basal secretion. NE and EPI also increased the maximal ACTH response to CRF, but did not alter the maximal ACTH release induced by arginine vasopressin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Female rats were mated and thyroidectomized on the same day. Some animals were kept without treatment and killed on day 12 or 21 of gestation (T). Others were subsequently treated daily with 1.8 micrograms L-T4/100 g BW for either the first 12 days and then not treated from that time until day 21 [T+T4(I+0)] or else not treated for the first 12 days and then treated from days 12-21 [T+T4(0+II)]. A final group received treatment during the entire 21-day study [T+T4(I+II)] and was used as the control. The net maternal body weight increased until day 12 of gestation in T+T4(I+II) rats, but not in T animals. On day 21 net maternal body weight was significantly lower in T and T+T4(0+II) than in T+T4(I+II) rats. Lipoprotein lipase activity in the lumbar fat pads increased from days 0 to 12 of gestation and decreased on day 21, whereas in the heart the change was in the opposite direction, and these changes were greater in T+T4(I+II) rats than in T rats. Incorporation of [U-14C]glucose administered in vivo into liver [14C]fatty acids or [14C]glycogen was significantly lower in T rats than in T+T4(I+II) on either the 12th or 21st day of gestation. The response of plasma triglyceride, glycerol, or beta-hydroxybutyrate levels to 24 h of starvation was similar in 12-day pregnant rats regardless of whether they were treated with T4, whereas on day 21 the change was greater in T+T4(I+II) or T+T4(I+0) animals than in T or T+T4(0+II) animals. Results show that maternal hypothyroidism during the first half of gestation impaired the anabolic events occurring during this phase and compromised the normal catabolic response during late gestation even when T4 treatment was restored. However, once maternal metabolic stores were built up normally during the first half of gestation, maternal hypothyroidism during late gestation did not affect the mother's normal metabolic adaptation, including the accelerated response to starvation.\r"

Although AFP's physiological role remains an enigma, we have recently demonstrated mitogenic activity for AFP. Using a primary monolayer culture system, we have further investigated the proliferative activity of purified AFP. Porcine granulosa cells from small ovarian follicles were attached for 2 days in Ham's F-12-Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (1:1) and 5% fetal calf serum, followed by 6 days of culture in medium containing 0.25% plasma-derived serum plus 25 micrograms/ml low density lipoprotein with or without growth factors and/or purified human AFP. In this system AFP alone does not stimulate proliferation. However, when combined with epidermal growth factor (EGF) and insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I; 10 ng/ml each), AFP (5 micrograms/ml) significantly (P less than 0.01) enhanced growth factor-mediated proliferation 4.5-fold over that of medium controls. Equivalent doses of purified human serum albumin or transferrin demonstrated no effect. The effects of AFP were dose dependent, with significant (P less than 0.05) enhancement of proliferation (2.7-fold over controls) observed with as little as 0.313 micrograms/ml AFP. Increased proliferation was noticed as early as 24 h after the addition of AFP and by 48 h AFP, EGF, and IGF-I had significantly (P less than 0.05) increased proliferation over that seen in medium controls, cells treated with EGF plus IGF-I, or cells treated with 10% fetal calf serum plus EGF, and this trend continued linearly over 5 days of culture. AFP (5 micrograms/ml) significantly increased the proliferative response observed with increasing doses of EGF, IGF-I, or EGF plus IGF-I, but did not appear to alter the dose-response curves. AFP dose-dependently (1.25-5 micrograms/ml) and significantly (P less than 0.05) increased proliferation of porcine granulosa cells in response to platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and EGF (25 and 10 ng/ml, respectively), but not to PDGF alone. In contrast, AFP produced no further proliferation of porcine thecal cells in response to PDGF plus EGF. Binding of EGF, IGF-I, or PDGF to purified AFP could not be demonstrated. These results demonstrate that physiological levels of AFP, although not mitogenic alone, can significantly enhance the mitogenic activity of EGF plus IGF-I/PDGF and may function to modulate growth factor-mediated cell proliferation during development and neoplasia.\r"

In this study, we determined the effect of transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF beta 1) on cytotrophoblast differentiation. Monolayer cultures of pure cytotrophoblasts were exposed to 0.001-10 ng/ml TGF beta 1 with and without the presence of 10 ng/ml epidermal growth factor (EGF), an inducer of placental differentiation. Over 7 days of culture, in 11 separate experiments, phase contrast microscopy demonstrated marked inhibition of EGF-induced syncytial formation by TGF beta 1. Basal human (h)CG and h-placental lactogen (PL) release were reduced compared to control by fractions of 0.75 (TGF beta 1/control) and 0.54, respectively. EGF alone induced fractional (EGF/control) increases in hCG and hPL release of 2.46 and 2.68, respectively. However, this stimulation was significantly inhibited by 10 ng/ml TGF beta 1. Dose-response studies showed that maximal TGF beta 1 inhibition of EGF-stimulated hormone secretion occurred at 0.1 ng/ml or more TGF beta 1. Partial differentiation (syncytium formation) occurred despite the presence of TGF beta 1, suggesting a portion of cytotrophoblasts were committed to differentiation at the time of culture. We conclude that TGF beta 1 acts as a major inhibitor of trophoblast differentiation and concomitant peptide hormone secretion.\r"

  ".W": "The role of thyroid hormones in the testis is unclear, although recent evidence indicates they may be important for testicular development. Here we describe a novel method for increasing adult testicular size in the rat by induction of transient hypothyroidism during neonatal life. Rats were treated with a reversible goitrogen, 6-propyl-2-thiouracil from birth to day 25 when treatment was stopped, allowing return to a euthyroid state. At days 90, 135, 160, and 180, wt and DNA content of the testis, epididymis, ventral prostate, seminal vesicle, and those of some nonreproductive organs were determined, as well as serum levels of testosterone (T) and thyroid hormones. Despite decreased body wts in 90-day and older 6-propyl-2-thiouracil-treated rats, testis wt was increased by 40% and 60% at 90 and 135 days, respectively; maximal increase (80%) occurred at 160 days. These wt increases were accompanied by proportional changes in DNA content. Significant enlargements were also seen in other reproductive organs, but they occurred after a time lag and were smaller in magnitude. Interestingly, serum T levels showed no increase at any age. Weight and DNA content of nonreproductive organs, like body wts, were less than controls at all ages but thyroid hormone levels were normal. Thus, transient hypothyroidism in neonatal rats is associated with lasting enlargements in the ultimate size of testis and other reproductive organs in the adult. These changes are not related to excess T levels. The results indicate early critical influences of thyroid hormones on growth and development of the reproductive system and suggest an experimental model for inducing lasting enlargements in testis and reproductive organs. The model may also be useful for studying regulation of reproductive growth and final size.\r"

  ".W": "In the preceding paper it was shown that transient neonatal hypothyroidism induced by treatment of rats from birth to day 25 with the goitrogen 6-propyl-2-thiouracil (PTU) is associated with increases in testis wt and DNA content of up to 80% during adulthood. The testis changes were accompanied by similar, though less marked, increases in the wt and DNA content of epididymis and accessory organs. The purpose of this study was to assess sperm production in these enlarged testes and measure changes in sperm reserves in the epididymis. Testes and epididymides were obtained from control rats or rats given PTU from birth to day 25 (designated \"treated\") at 90, 135, 160, and 180 days of age. Daily sperm production (DSP), efficiency of sperm production (DSP/g testis), and epididymal sperm reserves were measured in all animals. Compared to controls, DSP of the treated rats was increased by 83%, 86%, 136%, and 132% at 90, 135, 160, and 180 days, respectively. Thus, in the treated rats, DSP, like testis wt, plateaued at day 160. In addition, efficiency of sperm production was increased by 15%-30% at all ages in treated animals. Epididymal sperm reserves were also increased in treated rats at all ages, but the correlation between DSP and epididymal sperm reserves was weak. Sperm motility and concentration in caudal epididymal fluid of adult males treated from birth to day 25 with PTU were normal. These males were fertile and sired litters in which pup wt and pup number were normal. These results indicate that neonatal hypothyroidism in rats is associated not only with increased testis size but also with increased efficiency of sperm production, resulting in increases in DSP of up to 140% in these animals during adulthood. Maximal sperm production is reached at 160 days of age in treated rats (compared to 100 days in controls), coinciding with the attainment of final testicular size. This system represents the first experimental model in which such large increases in sperm production can be produced. The neonatal PTU treatment does not appear to impair fertility or alter sperm characteristics when these animals become adults and may be a useful system with which to study factors which normally regulate sperm production.\r"

  ".W": "Insulin desensitization of amino acid uptake in HTC cells was induced by preincubation with 4 or 10 micrograms/ml insulin. Insulin binding after desensitisation was decreased by both insulin concentrations due to a 45-49% decrease in insulin receptor numbers. Desensitization with 4 micrograms/ml insulin increased the ED50 for half-maximal stimulation of amino acid uptake from 19.5 +/- 9.2 ng/ml in control cells to 84.0 +/- 8.3 ng/ml (P less than 0.0001). It also decreased the maximal insulin response of amino acid uptake from 1.40 +/- 0.10 to 1.14 +/- 0.10 nmol/mg protein, indicating the production of a mild postreceptor defect. Desensitization with 10 micrograms/ml insulin completely abolished this insulin response. When cellular receptors were down-regulated with 4 micrograms/ml insulin and restimulated with insulin in the presence of 0.03 mM ruthenium red (RR) or 10 mM Ca2+, both the insulin response and insulin binding were increased. Insulin binding was restored to levels comparable to those observed in control cells by an increase in receptor affinity. The ED50 of amino acid uptake decreased to 20.5 +/- 7.3 ng/ml insulin in the presence of RR and to 42.2 +/- 8.9 ng/ml in the presence of 10 mM Ca2+ (both P less than 0.0001 from down-regulated cells). In addition, the maximal insulin response increased from 1.14 +/- 0.10 to 1.40 +/- 0.10 and 1.45 +/- 0.10 nmol/mg protein, respectively. Preincubation with 10 micrograms/ml insulin prevented the effect of RR and Ca2+ on the recovery of insulin responses. These experiments suggest that insulin-desensitized cells undergo a progressive loss of their insulin response and that RR and Ca2+ provide useful reagents to investigate the mechanisms of this process because they can counteract the decrease in insulin response by increasing receptor affinity and receptor-effector coupling.\r"

The 20 pS conductance corresponds to conductances found in L-type calcium channels. This channel displayed voltage dependency and a sensitivity to BayK 8644. Addition of ACTH (10 nM) to the bilayer preparations promoted an increased open time for the 20-pS channel.

The rate of hepatic uptake of corticosterone from pooled normal rat serum was then measured. A general model of hormone transport that does not assume that hormone-protein complexes remain at equilibrium during transit through the hepatic sinusoids was used to ask whether this observed rate of uptake could be accounted for by a pool of free corticosterone that turns over very rapidly. Parameter values used in this analysis included the measured concentrations of albumin and corticosteroid-binding globulin in the serum, literature values for the rate constants describing the interactions of corticosterone with these proteins, and the value of the hepatic influx rate constant for free corticosterone determined in the present study. The rate of hepatic uptake of corticosterone from rat serum that we observed was very similar to the rate of uptake predicted by this model to occur via the pool of free corticosterone.\r"

  ".U": "91275781\r", 
  ".W": "Galanin is localized within specific cell types of the rat anterior pituitary gland (AP). Immunocytochemical studies at the light microscope level have shown that lactotrophs, somatotrophs, and thyrotrophs contain galanin in the intact female rat, whereas lactotrophs in the male AP do not. We recently reported that galanin and PRL release from estrogen-treated male and female pituitary cells in culture are coregulated by dopamine, TRH, and somatostatin. This suggested that galanin is stored within secretory granules, conceivably with PRL. Using postembedding immunocytochemistry at the ultrastructural level, the objectives of this study were to: 1) determine the subcellular location of galanin in the AP; 2) elucidate if galanin and PRL are colocalized within the same secretory granules; and 3) compare the cellular localization of galanin in the male and female AP. Male and ovariectomized female (OVEX) Fischer 344 rats were implanted with estradiol-containing or empty Silastic capsules for 2 weeks. Postembedding immunogold labeling was performed using rabbit (for galanin) and guinea pig (for PRL) generated antisera. Two different sizes of colloidal gold spheres were used to localize the hormones in the same tissue section. Galanin was primarily localized in secretory granules of adenohypophyseal cells. Based upon immunocytochemical results and morphological criteria, galanin was contained in somatotrophs but not lactotrophs in the male and OVEX AP. The AP of estrogen-treated rats contained more specific immunogold labeling for galanin than untreated rats. The increased immunoreactivity for galanin was notably associated with lactotrophs. After exposure to estrogen, galanin and PRL were colocalized within the same secretory granules of the male and OVEX pituitary cells. We conclude: 1) galanin is localized within secretory granules of the rat AP; 2) galanin and PRL are colocalized within secretory granules of the male and OVEX AP after estrogen treatment; and 3) galanin is localized in similar cell types in the male and OVEX AP, before and after estrogen treatment. These data provide a morphological basis for the coregulation of galanin and PRL secretion by hypothalamic factors.\r"

  ".W": "The marked modulation of lymphocyte function exerted by the hypothalamic decapetide LHRH prompted us to study the possible involvement of the neuropeptide in one of the major steps of lymphocyte proliferation, namely the expression of interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptor during in vitro treatment of rat lymphocytes with LHRH agonists (LHRH-A) or antagonists (LHRH-ANTA). The basal proliferative activity of splenocytes and thymocytes from proestrous female rats was significantly stimulated after incubation with LHRH and LHRH-A, but not LHRH fragments [LHRH-(1-3), LHRH-(1-5), and LHRH-(2-6)]. Similarly, in the absence of the mitogenic stimulus, IL-2 receptor expression was significantly stimulated in thymocyte and splenocyte cultures incubated with increasing doses of LHRH or its agonists. The amplification of Concanavalin-A-induced increase in blastogenic transformation of lymphocytes by LHRH was paralleled by a significant stimulation of IL-2 receptor expression. The specificity of such effect was demonstrated by 1) the failure of LHRH fragments [LHRH-(1-6)] to mimick the LHRH stimulatory effect; and 2) the complete reversal produced by simultaneous addition of a potent LHRH-ANTA on IL-2 receptor expression induced by LHRH. Moreover, basal and lectin stimulation of IL-2 receptor-positive cells were significantly inhibited by treatment with the LHRH-ANTA. These data clearly demonstrate that 1) LHRH induction of lymphocyte activation in vitro is accompanied by a specific increase in IL-2 receptor-positive cells; 2) endogenous lymphocyte LHRH may participate in stimulation of IL-2 receptor expression under both basal and stimulated conditions, suggesting that LHRH signaling at the lymphocyte may interact synergistically with intracellular mechanisms responsible for lymphocyte activation.\r"

  ".W": "Our previous studies on microdissected kidney tubule segments indicate that the failure of vasopressin (VP) to increase cAMP content in collecting ducts of mice with hereditary nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI mice) is due to abnormally rapid cAMP catabolism via cyclic-3',5'-nucleotide phosphodiesterases (PDE). Furthermore, the VP-stimulated cAMP accumulation can be restored by addition of PDE isozyme-specific inhibitors. To elucidate the biochemical basis of the NDI syndrome, we analyzed PDE activities in extracts from inner medullary tissues of NDI mice and from control mice separated with the use of ionex fast protein liquid chromatography on a Mono-Q column. In extracts of inner medullary tissues from either control or NDI mice, the low Michaelis-Menten constant (Km) cAMP-PDE activity specific for cAMP as a substrate (cAMP-PDE) was eluted from a Mono-Q column with linear sodium acetate gradient as peak 3 at Na-acetate concentration (0.75-0.93 M) and was well separated from fractions containing the Ca(2+)-calmodulin sensitive PDE. The cAMP-PDE activity in peak 3 was significantly higher in NDI mice (greater than delta + 100%) than in controls. The sensitivity to effect of cAMP-PDE isozyme-specific inhibitors, rolipram and cilostamide, indicates that peak 3 consists predominantly (approximately 75%) of the rolipram-sensitive PDE-IV isozyme and a minor portion (approximately 25%) of cilostamide-sensitive PDE-III isozyme in both control and NDI mice. Higher activity of PDE-IV in NDI mice was due to 2.4 times higher apparent maximum velocity compared to controls, whereas the apparent Km for cAMP was not different. Our results show that low Km cAMP-PDE activities, predominantly PDE-IV, are higher in inner medulla of NDI mice. We suggest that the higher activity of PDE-IV, and to a lesser degree perhaps also PDE-III, accounts for rapid cAMP hydrolysis, which prevents the increase of cAMP generated in the response to VP in collecting ducts of NDI mice.\r"

  ".W": "This study tested the hypothesis that arginine vasopressin (AVP) is involved in the regulation of basal ACTH secretion in the ovine fetus near term. In five fetuses challenged with AVP (1 microgram/ml, iv bolus) plasma ACTH concentrations increased to an 8-fold peak within 10 min of the preceding baseline (55 +/- 6 to 403 +/- 241 pg/ml). Cortisol in fetal circulation subsequently increased 2-fold (11 +/- 1 to 28 +/- 5 ng/ml) within 15 min of the AVP injection. The AVP-induced rise in plasma ACTH and cortisol concentrations was blocked when the fetus was pretreated with the AVP V1 receptor antagonist d(Ch2)5Tyr(Me)AVP. In a total of seven studies, antagonist (10 micrograms/kg estimated BW, iv bolus) was administered to three fetuses, aged 137-147 days gestation, followed 40 min later by the exogenous AVP challenge, as described above. After AVP antagonist treatment, basal ACTH and cortisol concentrations were not significantly different from the preinjection baseline levels (P greater than 0.05, by analysis of variance). Moreover, plasma ACTH and cortisol remained unchanged after the AVP challenge. To further define the role of endogenous AVP in basal ACTH and cortisol secretion, the AVP antagonist was administered (five studies in two fetuses) at 30-min intervals for a total of three injections per fetus. This extended AVP antagonist regimen also failed to alter fetal circulating concentrations of ACTH or cortisol (P greater than 0.05). Cortisol in the maternal circulation was not affected by any of the fetal AVP or AVP antagonist treatments. Lambs were born at 146 +/- 2 days gestation (n = 5), within the range for the normal duration of pregnancy. These data do not support the hypotheses that AVP is involved in the regulation of basal ACTH secretion in the fetal sheep during the 10 days preceding parturition. Rather, the ability of AVP antagonist to block the AVP-induced rise in plasma ACTH and cortisol in the fetus suggests that basal and stimulated ACTH secretion are under separate regulatory mechanisms.\r"

  ".W": "Insulin and insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) have been shown to regulate neuronal growth and differentiation. To investigate the possible role of tyrosine phosphorylation in the neurotrophic actions of these peptides, we examined the effects of insulin, IGF-I, and IGF-II on tyrosine phosphorylation in cultured fetal chick neurons. Tyrosine phosphorylation was detected by immunoblot analysis using antiphosphotyrosine antibodies. Under basal conditions five major phosphoproteins (170K, 140K, 115K, 103K, and 44K) and a number of minor proteins were detected by three separate antisera. In response to insulin, IGF-I, or IGF-II, an 87K membrane-associated protein (pp87) became phosphorylated on tyrosine in a rapid, dose-dependent manner. The Mr of pp87 was identical to that of the insulin and IGF-I receptor beta-subunits. Comparison of the dose-response curves for pp87 phosphorylation by insulin and IGF-I suggests that each peptide stimulated autophosphorylation of its own receptor beta-subunit. The maximal response obtained with IGF-I was approximately 10-fold higher than that obtained with insulin (3- to 5-fold), consistent with the larger number of IGF-I receptors in these cells. The maximal response obtained with IGF-II was 4- to 7-fold higher than that with insulin, suggesting that it acts through the insulin receptor as well. Tyrosine that IGF-II acts through the insulin receptor as well. Tyrosine phosphorylation of other proteins by the activated receptor kinases was not detected in neurons cultured for 5 days, however neurons cultured for only several h contained a predominant 70K protein (pp70) that was phosphorylated on tyrosine in response to all three hormones. Tyrosine phosphorylation of pp70 was maximal after 2-5 h in culture and was undetectable in neurons cultured longer than 24 h. The time course and dose dependence of pp70 phosphorylation in response to hormone paralleled that of insulin and IGF-I receptor autophosphorylation. These results demonstrate that both insulin and IGF-I receptors are active tyrosine kinases in fetal neurons, and that pp70 represents a potential endogenous substrate for the insulin and IGF-I receptor kinases. The transient phosphorylation of pp70 may be involved in the neurotrophic effects of insulin and insulin-like growth factors.\r"

  ".U": "91275787\r", 
  ".W": "There is evidence from previous studies that progesterone antagonists (antigestagens) modify estrogen responses at endometrial and myometrial levels without having affinity to the estrogen receptor (ER). The purpose of the present study was to investigate the influence of the antigestagen onapristone (ZK 98 299) on the uterus in ovariectomized (OVX) estradiol (E2)-substituted rabbits (3.0 micrograms/animal.day). The animals were treated for 8 days with different doses of onapristone (3.0, 10.0, and 30.0 mg/animal.day, sc). Uterine growth was not influenced by onapristone compared to that in OVX E2-substituted controls. However, morphological (light microscopy, transmission electron microscopy) and morphometric criteria indicated that there was a significant dose-dependent inhibition of the estrogen-induced gland formation within the endometrium and degenerative changes in glandular epithelial cells. By contrast, there were morphological signs of activation of the endometrial stroma (proliferation, increased capillarization, and vascularization, edema) above the level of E2-treated animals. A dose-dependent increase in the concentration of uterine cytosolic ER, nuclear ER, and ER mRNA (ER mRNA) was measured in uterine homogenates after onapristone treatment compared to values in OVX E2-substituted controls. Immunocytochemical analysis of ER in uterine sections suggests that the increase in ER after onapristone treatment took place predominantly in the myometrium and surface epithelium. To examine whether the observed interference was mediated via the progesterone receptor (PR), E2-substituted rabbits were treated, in a separate experiment, with onapristone (10.0 mg/animal.day, sc) and various doses of progesterone (1.0, 3.0, and 10.0 mg/animal.day, sc). Progesterone reversed all onapristone-induced changes, indicating that the observed effects were mediated via the PR. The data indicate that the antigestagen onapristone interacts with estrogen action in the absence of the natural PR ligand. The increase in ER and ER mRNA concentrations after onapristone treatment in OVX E2-treated animals suggests that this antigestagen abolished an inhibitory action of the unoccupied PR on ER biosynthesis.\r"

In the present study we examined the ability of the somatostatin octapeptide analog BIM23014 to modulate the in vitro growth of five human breast cell lines: HBL100, Hs578T, MDAMB231, T47D, and MCF7. BIM23014 inhibited the growth of the two steroid-dependent cell lines, MCF7 and T47D, in a dose-related manner. This inhibitory effect was only observed when MCF7 and T47D cells were cultivated in medium containing steroid-depleted serum. The growth of a MCF7 variant capable of growth in serum-free medium was also inhibited by BIM23014, indicating that serum factors are not required for this inhibition. In the serum-free medium, the addition of estradiol before or during treatment with BIM23014 abolished its inhibitory effects on cell growth. The studies including time course, competitive inhibition, and cross-linking of iodinated BIM23014 to its receptor revealed a specific binding on MCF7 cells and showed a single 57,000 mol wt protein band in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. These results support the hypothesis that BIM23014 inhibits the growth of steroid-receptor positive cells of human breast cancers through its own receptor in estradiol-free conditions.\r"

  ".U": "91275790\r", 
  ".W": "The mechanisms by which bacterial endotoxin [lipopolysaccharide (LPS)] stimulates the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPAA) have not been elucidated. The present study was designed to investigate the involvement of macrophages in plasma ACTH and corticosterone responses to LPS administration in rats using selective in vivo macrophage depletion. Intraperitoneal administration of subpyrogenic doses of LPS to normal rats resulted in elevated plasma ACTH and corticosterone concentrations, measured 2 h later. The response showed a remarkable steep dose relationship, with minimal effective doses between 0.5-1.5 micrograms (ACTH) and 0.5 micrograms or less (corticosterone)/kg BW. Plasma PRL, LH, and catecholamine (norepinephrine, epinephrine) levels were not significantly changed under the conditions used. Only at 6 h after LPS administration was a small elevation of norepinephrine noted. To deplete macrophages, rats were injected with liposomes encapsulated with dichloromethylene diphosphonate (Cl2MDP). Histochemical (acid phosphatase) and immunocytochemical techniques (monoclonal antibodies to rat macrophages coded ED1 and ED3) were applied to examine the efficiency of macrophage elimination by the Cl2MDP liposomes in cytospins of peritoneal exudates and in sections of the liver and spleen. Since cells of the macrophage lineage are considered to be the main source of IL-1 in the circulation, we also measured circulating levels of immunoreactive interleukin-1 beta (IL-1) concentrations in control and Cl2MDP liposome-treated rats by the use of a newly developed RIA. Reduced numbers of macrophages were seen in peritoneal lavages of Cl2MDP liposome-treated animals, whereas the morphological appearance and numbers of mast cells, granulocytes, and T-cells were unaffected. Similarly, macrophages were effectively eliminated in the spleen, mesenteric lymph nodes, and liver, as inferred from the reduction of macrophage staining in these organs. Plasma IL-1 concentrations could only be detected in response to a pyrogenic (2.5 mg/kg, iv) and not to a subpyrogenic (0.025 mg/kg, ip) dose of LPS. The increase in plasma IL-1 concentrations in response to the pyrogenic dose of LPS, reaching levels of 20-40 ng/ml in control rats, was blunted in animals treated with the Cl2MDP liposomes. Macrophage depletion by Cl2MDP liposomes did not affect either resting plasma corticosterone levels or the corticosterone response to ether exposure. At subpyrogenic doses of LPS, plasma ACTH and corticosterone responses were completely prevented by macrophage depletion. In contrast, at pyrogenic doses of LPS, plasma ACTH and corticosterone responses were not significantly affected by depleting macrophages. These data demonstrate that activation of the HPAA by a subpyrogenic dose of LPS is macrophage dependent. However, macrophage-independent mechanisms mediate activation of the HPAA in response to a pyrogenic dose of LPS.\r"

  ".W": "Treatment of MCF-7 cells, a human mammary carcinoma cell line, with phorbol ester [12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)] or calcium ionophore (A23187) was associated with striking effects on levels of estrogen receptor (ER) mRNA, specific binding of 17 beta-[3H]estradiol [( 3H]E2), and immunoreactive ER. TPA (10(-7) M) caused a time-dependent reduction of ER mRNA which was below the level of detection after 9 h. Similar effects of TPA appeared at levels of specific binding of [3H]E2 as well as immunoreactive ER. In contrast, TPA induced an increase in mRNA for beta-actin. Incubation of MCF-7 cells with increasing concentrations of TPA (10(-11)-10(-7) M) was associated with biphasic effects on ER mRNA and proteins. Levels of immunoreactive progesterone receptors (PR) were induced by E2 (10(-9) M) in a time-dependent manner. In the presence of TPA (10(-7) M), where ER levels were suppressed, no induction of PR was observed. Removal of TPA (10(-7) M) after 10 h (ER mRNA) or 22 h (ER proteins) of treatment was associated with a continued suppression of both mRNA and protein levels during the entire incubation period (48 h). Treatment with A23187 (2 x 10(-7) M) also caused a time-dependent down-regulation of levels of ER mRNA and proteins. These effects occurred somewhat more slowly than those of TPA. Levels of beta-actin mRNA were not changed by this treatment. These results indicate that changes in estrogen sensitivity are mediated by calcium-dependent protein kinases in human mammary carcinoma MCF-7 cells.\r"

  ".W": "Primary cultured cardiac myocytes from adult rats were used to elucidate the role of insulin and catecholamines in the development of insulin resistance in this tissue. Cardiomyocytes exhibited a stable response toward insulin up to at least 48 h in serum-free culture, as determined by measuring the effect of the hormone on initial rates of 2-deoxyglucose uptake. Culturing of cells in the absence of insulin for 6 and 19 h, respectively, resulted in a loss of insulin sensitivity and a reduced (33%) maximal responsiveness after 19 h of insulin deficiency. This was paralleled by a decrease in [14C]phenylalanine incorporation and an unaltered level of insulin binding. Insulin action was completely lost in cells cultured in the presence of cycloheximide for 19 h. When added to the culture medium for 4 h, both isoproterenol and (Bu)2cAMP decreased insulin binding by about 50%. Under these conditions maximal insulin responsiveness was not affected by isoproterenol but was reduced by 46% by (Bu)2cAMP. Nifedipine antagonized the inhibitory action of (Bu)2cAMP, but was ineffective when the culture period was extended to 19 h. Cardiomyocytes cultured in the presence of palmitate exhibited a largely reduced (67%) insulin responsiveness, which was only partly restored by inhibition of fatty acid oxidation. From these data we conclude that: 1) insulin deficiency induces insulin resistance due to decreased protein synthesis; 2) sustained, prolonged elevation of cAMP modulates insulin action by both Ca(++)-dependent and Ca(++)-independent mechanisms; and 3) free fatty acids antagonize insulin action by both metabolic and nonmetabolic pathways.\r"

Fasting and food restriction did not affect the T3 binding parameters in the brain areas studied. Both thyroidectomy and diabetes were accompanied by a reduction in T3 content in nuclei from both cerebral cortex and cerebellum, but a decrease in T3 binding sites was only observed in both brain areas of diabetic animals. No significant differences in the binding affinity values among the experimental groups were seen. The diabetes-induced decrease in T3 content and receptor number were completely reversed by insulin treatment. Studies with fractionated nuclei from cerebral cortex and cerebellum showed that diabetes resulted in a reduction in T3 content and the number of receptors in glial nuclei from both brain areas. Although T3 content was also decreased in neuronal nuclei, the receptor concentration in these nuclear preparations did not change in concentration or affinity under the same conditions. These observations indicate that glial cells, not only have T3-binding characteristics similar to those of neuronal cells, but the T3 receptor number is decreased in the diabetes state.\r"

The present studies were designed, therefore, to establish whether thecal/interstitial cells (TIC) from diethylstilbestrol-primed immature rats express more than one subtype of TGF beta mRNA and gene product and whether the levels of expression/production in vitro were regulated by LH/hCG. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis of total RNA indicated that TIC expressed both TGF beta 1 and TGF beta 2 mRNA. In response to hCG (200 ng/ml), TIC expressed TGF beta 2 mRNA levels that were 51% of control levels; TGF beta 1 mRNA levels were not altered. In response to cholera toxin (10(-9) M), TIC expression of TGF beta 2 and TGF beta 1 mRNA levels was 10% and 55% of control values, respectively. Western blot analysis established that both TGF beta 1 and TGF beta 2 were secreted in vitro. hCG and cholera toxin reduced secretion of TGF beta bioactivity by 55% and 90%, respectively. In summary, these results indicate: 1) TIC express both TGF beta 1 and TGF beta 2 mRNA; 2) TIC expression of TGF beta 2, but not TGF beta 1, mRNA is regulated by hCG in vitro; 3) TIC secrete both TGF beta 1 and TGF beta 2, and 4) TIC secretion in vitro of TGF beta activity is gonadotropin regulated.\r"

Equine relaxin has been previously purified by acetone extraction, gel filtration, and ion exchange chromatographies. In an attempt to develop a more rapid and efficient method for relaxin purification, the use of affinity chromatography coupled with HPLC was explored. Monoclonal antibodies were raised against highly purified equine relaxin; large quantities of antibody were obtained by ascites production and attached to a solid phase support. An extract of term equine placentas was passed through the affinity column and washed, and relaxin was eluted by a change in pH. The isoforms of equine relaxin were separated by HPLC using a C18 (ODS) reverse phase column and a linear gradient of 25-30% acetonitrile. Four major and several minor isoforms of equine relaxin were obtained. The isoforms share similar mol wt by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), are composed of subunits (SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions), and have similar charges (native PAGE). Five isoforms tested positive for biological activity in the mouse interpubic ligament bioassay. Equine relaxin was sequenced by Edman degradation, and the sequence was confirmed by fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry. The isoforms of equine relaxin were found to be due to heterogeneity of the C-terminus of the B-chain. Equine relaxin appears to be the smallest relaxin sequenced. The A-chain consists of 20 residues, and the B-chain has 28 residues, with a total mol wt of 5253. Equine relaxin shares the greatest sequence homology with porcine relaxin (67% identity).\r"

  ".U": "91275797\r", 
  ".W": "The in vivo release of ACTH by interleukin-1 alpha (II-1 alpha) is reportedly blocked by acute treatment with indomethacin (indo), suggesting an involvement of endogenous prostaglandins in the effect of cytokines on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. However, indo also increases plasma corticosterone levels, raising the possibility that inhibition of ACTH release is due to suppressive effects of hypercorticolemia rather than to blockade of the stimulatory effects of II-1 alpha. We observed that the iv administration of indo (10 mg/kg) 15 min before II-1 alpha completely abolished the rise in plasma ACTH levels caused by the peripheral injection of this lymphokine to intact rats. At the time of II-1 alpha injection, plasma corticosterone levels were 39 +/- 12 ng/ml in controls and 121 +/- 22 ng/ml in indo-treated animals (P less than or equal to 0.01). In contrast, implantation of intact rats with indo pellets (which delivered 30 micrograms drug/h) 28 h before II-1 only partially interfered with II-1-induced ACTH secretion. In these rats plasma corticosterone levels before II-1 alpha injection were 29 +/- 14 ng/ml in controls and 66 +/- 18 ng/ml in rats implanted with indo pellets (P less than or equal to 0.05). To determine whether the effect of indo was due to corticosteroid feedback or represented a modulating action of prostaglandins themselves, a similar series of experiments was carried out in adrenalectomized rats. In the absence of corticoid replacement therapy, acute treatment with indo did not measurably interfere with the stimulatory effect of II-1 alpha. In contrast, indo blunted, but did not abolish, the effect of II-1a in ADX rats pretreated with corticosterone or dexamethasone to normalize basal ACTH levels. We conclude that the acute ability of indomethacin to totally block II-1-induced ACTH secretion by intact rats appears to be primarily mediated through corticosteroid feedback. However, results obtained when a similar experiment was carried out in adrenalectomized/corticosteroid-treated rats suggest, although they do not prove, that the ability of II-1 alpha to activate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis may be partially dependent on the release of prostaglandins.\r"

  ".U": "91275800\r", 
  ".W": "In this study the ontogenesis of rat intestinal vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene expression was examined. When Northern and slot blot analyses were used to examine the expression of intestinal VDR mRNA in 15-, 18-, 22-, and 28-day-old rats, induction of VDR mRNA was not observed until 22 days postpartum. Since little is known, particularly in the neonate, concerning the in vivo regulation of VDR gene expression, we examined the possibility that glucocorticoids and/or 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25-(OH)2D3] could affect the developmental expression of the intestinal VDR gene. To examine the effect of glucocorticoids, rat pups received three sequential injections (one per day) of hydrocortisone (5, 2.5, and 2.5 mg/100 g BW). Hydrocortisone administration before day 14 or on days 19-21 was not effective in inducing VDR mRNA. However, a significant 3.8-fold increase in intestinal VDR mRNA was observed in rats injected with hydrocortisone from days 15-17. The hydrocortisone effective period coincides with the glucocorticoid-sensitive period of rat intestinal development. It should be noted, however, that the up-regulation of VDR was accompanied by an increase in actin mRNA, suggesting that the effect is not specific for VDR. Similarly, when rats were bilaterally adrenalectomized on day 17 (killed on day 22), a 4-fold decrease in VDR mRNA was observed, accompanied by a decrease in actin mRNA. However, when rats were injected with 1,25-(OH)2D3 (25 ng/day.100 g BW) from days 15-17, levels of intestinal VDR mRNA were significantly increased by 1.5-fold, and this change was specific for VDR mRNA. In summary, our results indicate that hydrocortisone and 1,25-(OH)2D3 can precociously induce intestinal VDR mRNA, suggesting the involvement of glucocorticoids and 1,25-(OH)2D3 in the regulation of VDR gene expression in the developing rat intestine. However, our results also indicate that the effect of glucocorticoids (unlike the effect of 1,25-(OH)2D3) is not specific for VDR mRNA, but may reflect general effects of glucocorticoids on intestinal maturation.\r"

  ".W": "Recent evidence suggests that hypothalamic neurosecretion of neuropeptide Y (NPY) may be required for the preovulatory LH surge in female rats. Results of immunoneutralization and portal blood collection studies have suggested that NPY may serve to enhance the response of gonadotropes to the stimulatory action of LHRH. To directly test this hypothesis, the effects of NPY on LHRH-stimulated LH secretion were assessed in proestrous rats that were anesthetized with pentobarbital (PB) to block endogenous LHRH neurosecretion. Female rats were fitted with atrial catheters on diestrus. On proestrus, hourly blood samples were collected from 0900-2100 h. At 1330 h, rats received PB (40 mg/kg BW) or saline. Every 30 min from 1400-1800 h, PB-treated rats received iv pulses of LHRH (15, 150, or 1500 ng/pulse) or saline along with concurrent pulses of NPY (1 or 10 micrograms/pulse). Plasma samples were analyzed by LH RIA. In PB-treated rats receiving vehicle pulses only, LH surges were completely blocked. Pulsatile LHRH treatments at 15, 150, and 1500 ng/pulse produced subphysiological, physiological, and supraphysiological LH surges, respectively. Simultaneous administration of NPY pulses with 15 ng/pulse LHRH produced significant dose-related potentiations of LHRH-stimulated LH surges (P less than 0.0001). Administration of NPY pulses with 150 ng LHRH/pulse also significantly enhanced LHRH-induced LH surges (P less than 0.05). NPY RIA of plasma confirmed NPY increments after treatments. These results demonstrate that NPY administration can potentiate pituitary responsiveness to LHRH stimulation, and are consistent with the hypothesis that one function of NPY is to operate as a neurohormonal modulator at the level of the gonadotrope during generation of the preovulatory LH surge.\r"

The aim of this study was to ascertain whether the positive effect on bone mass is also reflected in the quality of bone formed. The study was performed in a rat model using human PTH (hPTH). One hundred and twenty male Wistar rats, divided into 10 groups, were given either hPTH-(1-34) or hPTH-(1-84) in daily sc doses. Dose levels ranged from 0.11-3.00 nmol/100 g BW.day for a period of 30 days. At death all six lumbar vertebrae were obtained from each rat. A combination of methods was applied to these vertebral bodies in order to ascertain the effect of hPTH on vertebral bone volume, density, trabecular structure, and biomechanical competence. The results revealed a dose-dependent increase in total volume, dry weight, ash weight, and trabecular bone volume. Also, a dose-dependent increase in load values could be demonstrated. The increase in bone strength remained significant after normalization for both cross-sectional area and bone mass. This indicates that the increase in bone size and bone mass was not achieved at the expense of the quality of the bone present. When the two treatments were administered at the same molar dose level, no difference between hPTH-(1-34) and hPTH-(1-84) was revealed. On the basis of this study, it is concluded that PTH could prove to be a promising treatment in the management of osteopenic states.\r"

  ".W": "Dietary protein restriction causes GH resistance and decreases serum insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) concentrations. To determine whether pretranslational or translational defects are involved in the decline of serum IGF-I concentrations during protein restriction, we measured hepatic IGF-I mRNA abundance together with the serum IGF-I peptide response to exogenous GH after 1 week of protein restriction (5% casein in diet; P5) in hypophysectomized rats. We compared these responses with those of hypophysectomized rats fed a protein-sufficient diet (15% casein in diet; P15) and given exogenous GH. A single injection of rat GH (200 micrograms/100 g BW) produced a comparable IGF-I mRNA increment in both groups (at 6 h, 7.8 +/- 1.1 arbitrary units in P5 vs. 8.2 +/- 1.1 in P15), but failed to raise serum IGF-I normally in the P5 group (at 6 h, 90 +/- 15 ng/ml in P5 vs. 216 +/- 63 in P15; P less than 0.01). The post-GH decline of the 7.5-kilobase (kb) IGF-I mRNA abundance was faster in P5 than in P15 animals. In another experiment in intact rats subjected to protein restriction, injections of pharmacological doses of rat GH (400 micrograms/100 g BW.day) for 1 week restored liver IGF-I mRNA abundance to normal without normalization of serum IGF-I (403 +/- 91 vs. 713 +/- 53 ng/ml; P less than 0.01). Our data suggest that 1) the machinery involved in the transcription of the liver IGF-I gene is intact in protein-restricted rats, because these animals retain the ability to muster normal IGF-I mRNA responses to high doses of exogenous GH; 2) the stability of the 7.5-kb IGF-I mRNA is probably decreased by the protein restriction, as suggested by the faster decline of the 7.5-kb transcript in P5 than in P15 hypophysectomized rats; and 3) the discrepancy between normal liver IGF-I mRNA abundance and low serum and liver IGF-I peptide concentrations suggests that translational stalling of the IGF-I mRNAs or increased serum IGF-I clearance is involved in the low serum IGF-I concentrations during dietary protein restriction.\r"

  ".U": "91275805\r", 
  ".W": "Previous studies suggested that an extracellular steroid-binding protein, testosterone-estradiol-binding globulin (TeBG), can enter a variety of cells. Experiments were conducted to determine whether uptake of TeBG occurs by nonspecific fluid phase endocytosis or via a specific receptor-mediated process. In human breast carcinoma cells (MCF-7) maintained on serum-free medium, exposure to radiolabeled TeBG resulted in cellular uptake, which reached a plateau by 6 h and could be inhibited 80% by competition with unlabeled TeBG. Uptake was temperature dependent with cell-associated radioactivity at 37 C being 1.6-fold higher than at 4 C. Subsequent exposure of cells to pronase resulted in release of the cell-associated TeBG by 88% and 44% at 4 C and 37 C, respectively. After transfer to media devoid of TeBG, approximately 35% of cell-associated radioactivity was release into the medium at 37 C; it was not possible to distinguish whether this was released from the cell surface or from inside the cell. Investigation of the localization of TeBG-gold complexes by electron microscopy revealed that TeBG first binds to the plasmalemma. Within 15 min label appears in receptosomes, which fuse to form multivesicular endosomes. By 1 h all label is observed in multivesicular endosomes and lysosomes, most of which are in the Golgi zone. Localization of the internalized radioactivity using classical cell fractionation techniques showed it appears in a symmetrical band exhibiting the same buoyant density as the lysosomal marker acid phosphatase. The observations reported here show that: 1) TeBG binds to MCF-7 cells; 2) some of the bound TeBG is taken up via a mechanism with all the characteristics of receptor-mediated endocytosis; and 3) within these cells TeBG is localized in endosomes and lysosomes.\r"

  ".W": "Changes in heart rate, core temperature, and gross locomotor activity were recorded simultaneously by a wireless telemetry system for periods up to 60 min after intracerebroventricular (icv) administration of synthetic human CRF-(1-41) (CRF) or artificial cerebrospinal fluid in rats in their home cages. The telemetry system provides a highly sensitive method to monitor autonomic nervous system (ANS) activity without imposing restraint on the animal. CRF was administered at lower doses than hitherto used to study central effects on the ANS (0.03, 0.1, 0.3, and 1 microgram). Starting 10 min after icv injections, behavioral responses to CRF, i.e. grooming, locomotion, and digging, were determined by a time sampling method. Within 5 min after icv treatment, CRF, in a dose-related fashion, produced a significant increase in heart rate, core temperature, and behavioral activity. The absence of effect of 30 ng CRF, which already may be regarded as a supraphysiological amount, suggests that CRF does not modify ANS and behavioral activity under resting conditions. Tachycardiac responses in rats receiving 0.1 microgram CRF, icv, in the morning were more marked than those in rats given the same treatment in the late afternoon. In addition, the presumed intrinsic activity of the CRF receptor antagonist, alpha-helical CRF-(9-41) (alpha hCRF) at doses of 0.1, 1, 5, and 25 micrograms was evaluated. Intracerebroventricular injections of 0.1 and 1 microgram alpha hCRF failed to produce detectable effects. At the 5- and 25-micrograms doses, alpha hCRF dose-dependently induced tachycardia and behavioral activation, suggesting partial agonistic activity. Taken together, these results demonstrate that CRF does not play a role in the regulation of ANS and behavioral activity under resting conditions. The responses produced by icv injected supraphysiological amounts of CRF, however, may serve to model a stressful situation during which the massively released CRF induces similar effects on ANS and behavior, after reaching high local concentrations at brain sites involved in the mediation of these actions.\r"

  ".W": "The enhancement of metabolic rate by thyroid hormone in target tissues is accompanied by increased glucose utilization, which in skeletal muscle and many other tissues is regulated at the level of membrane transport. To elucidate the role of thyroid hormone as a regulator of glucose transport in skeletal muscle, we have examined its effects on the expression of the muscle/fat (insulin-regulatable) glucose transporter, a distinct glucose transporter isotype whose expression is limited to insulin-sensitive tissues and which appears to be the major glucose transport protein in skeletal muscle. Treatment of hypothyroid rats with L-T3 (T3; 100 micrograms/100 g BW.day for 6 days) increased the abundance of the muscle/fat glucose transporter protein in crude membranes from hindlimb muscle, assessed by immunoblotting, to 145 +/- 8% of the control value in animals fasted for 17-20 h before death and to 159 +/- 16% of the control value in animals fed ad libitum (mean +/- SE). In purified plasma membranes, this effect of thyroid hormone was greater (208 +/- 23% and 219 +/- 13% of control in fasted and fed animals, respectively). Similar increases were found in an intracellular membrane fraction. Levels of muscle/fat glucose transporter mRNA were also increased in hindlimb muscle from the T3-treated rats, to 261 +/- 17% and 316 +/- 23% of control values in fasted and fed animals, respectively. In contrast, the erythroid glucose transporter protein and its mRNA, which are only weakly expressed in skeletal muscle but strongly expressed in brain, were not substantially increased by T3 treatment in either tissue. In experiments comparing hypothyroid, euthyroid, and chronically T4-treated animals, muscle/fat glucose transporter protein and mRNA abundance in skeletal muscle were also found to be dependent on thyroid status. Thyroid hormone may, thus, be an important regulator of the muscle/fat glucose transporter in skeletal muscle.\r"

  ".U": "91275808\r", 
  ".W": "The presence of several endogenous molecular forms of human GH (hGH), including proteolytically cleaved two-chain forms, has been proposed to be related to the diverse biological activity of hGH. The present study characterized hGH degradation in the rat to determine how peripheral metabolism may influence the kinetics and pharmacology of exogenously administered hGH. In vitro studies indicated that hGH was proteolytically degraded by thyroid gland and skeletal muscle, but not liver and kidney homogenates. The proteolytic activity, localized to the 9000 x g pellet fraction, was characterized as a chymotrypsin-like serine protease using class-specific inhibitors. N-Terminal sequencing of hGH peptides formed by the thyroid gland and skeletal muscle indicated that cleavage sites were almost exclusively at Tyr/Phe-Xaa bonds, with similar points of cleavage observed in the two tissues. Immunoreactive two-chain forms of hGH were also formed. The two-chain molecules had similar cleavage sites, but differed in apparent mol wt when analyzed by nonreducing sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. To understand the potential significance of two-chain product formation, we compared the kinetics and degradation of hGH with those of a synthetic two-chain derivative of hGH (Des-1-8,135-145; 2-CAP). The in vitro tissue distribution of 2-CAP proteolysis was the same as that for hGH. The fragmentation pattern of 2-CAP was less complex when analyzed by reverse phase HPLC. The major peptide fragments formed from 2-CAP were chromatographically similar to those formed from hGH. The plasma kinetics of 2-CAP were compared to those of hGH with a RIA using polyclonal antiserum to hGH. After im and sc administration of 2-CAP (125 micrograms/kg), the area under the plasma concentration curve was 3.2- and 4.5-fold greater, respectively, than after administration of hGH (125 micrograms/kg). Both compounds had a greater area under the curve by the im than the sc route. 2-CAP had 2- to 3-fold greater bioavailability than hGH by the im and sc routes. Plasma from rats treated 30 min earlier with hGH im was immunoextracted and analyzed by Western blotting. A circulating immunoreactive fragment was detected which had similar electrophoretic mobility as a two-chain hGH product formed during the in vitro incubations of hGH with skeletal muscle and thyroid gland homogenates. The results indicate that hGH is proteolytically processed in peripheral tissue homogenates, with the formation of two-chain products. The greater bioavailability of 2-CAP suggests that metabolism of hGH to two-chain forms may influence the in vivo kinetics of hGH.\r"

  ".W": "Experiments were conducted to investigate the role of the brain angiotensin system in mediating the pressor effects of porcine relaxin in anesthetized female rats. Continuous intracerebroventricular infusion of a specific angiotensin II receptor antagonist (Sar1-Ala8-angiotensin II) completely negated the pressor response to centrally administered relaxin, but only partially suppressed the increase in blood pressure observed after iv injection of the hormone. These results indicate that the pressor effects of relaxin may be mediated, at least in part, by brain angiotensin. Rats with a compromised central angiotensin system were then treated in combination with a peripheral vasopressin (V1) receptor antagonist. Only after both treatments were the pressor effects of iv relaxin completely negated. These data imply that there is also a significant pressor action of relaxin which is independent of the brain angiotensin system. The most likely alternative is a direct action of relaxin on the neural lobe of the pituitary, to provoke the release of vasopressin.\r"

PTH binding was autoradiographically localized to the adrenal cortex, suggesting a specific effect. This binding of PTH was displaceable by cold PTH, but not by ACTH. No binding was observed in the adrenal medulla. In addition, PTH was shown to stimulate aldosterone secretion in a dose-dependent manner and to potentiate aldosterone secretion in response to angiotensin-II, such that PTH (10(-9)M) elevated the secretory rate from 58.6 +/- 6.8 to 110.9 +/- 19 pg/min.million cells in the presence of 10 nM angiotensin-II. The magnitude of the synergism between the two hormones depended on the concentrations of PTH and angiotensin-II as well as the time during which aldosterone secretion was measured. Within the first 15 min of stimulation, PTH increased the sensitivity to angiotensin-II, shifting the Ka for activation from 1.0 to 0.3 nM. In contrast, between 30-45 min of angiotensin-II stimulation, PTH elevated the maximal secretory response to angiotensin-II from 109 +/- 3.4 to 219 +/- 13.3 pg/min.million cells. By itself PTH elicited only a small increase in the intracellular Ca2+ concentration, as measured by aequorin luminescence in glomerulosa cells. In cells pretreated with angiotensin-II or 15 mM potassium, the intracellular calcium response to PTH was markedly potentiated. PTH was also found to cause a small increase in the cellular cAMP content. Thus, PTH stimulates aldosterone secretion from adrenal glomerulosa cells, both alone and in combination with angiotensin-II.\r"

  ".W": "Pituitary PRL messenger RNA levels in hens, measured by dot-blot hybridization, correlated directly with concentrations of plasma PRL, being 3-fold higher in incubating than in laying birds. Nest deprivation of incubating hens for 24 h caused a rapid decrease in both plasma PRL and pituitary PRL mRNA, which remained depressed thereafter. A single injection of vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) in laying hens resulted in an increase (P less than 0.05) in pituitary PRL mRNA whereas passive immunoneutralization of VIP in incubating hens resulted in a decrease (P less than 0.001) in pituitary PRL mRNA. The rapid decrease in pituitary PRL mRNA after nest deprivation or passive immunoneutralization of VIP was associated with a significant increase in pituitary PRL content, presumably a consequence of the decreased PRL secretion. In situ hybridization showed PRL mRNA to be localized in the cephalic lobe of the anterior pituitary gland in which most PRL cells, identified immunocytochemically, were found. Northern blotting studies showed that the pituitary gland contains a single 860 base(s) mature PRL mRNA transcript irrespective of physiological state or VIP manipulation. Both in situ and Northern hybridization studies confirmed that the amount of pituitary PRL mRNA was related directly to the concentration of plasma PRL. These observations are consistent with the view that in incubating hens hypothalamic VIP, in addition to acting as a PRL releasing hormone, also plays a major role in the regulation of the amount of PRL mRNA in the anterior pituitary gland.\r"

  ".W": "Eight- to 12-amino acid long peptides, representing fragments of transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF beta 1) and TGF beta 2 were selected on the basis of their potential immunogenicity and were used to generate polyclonal antibodies. Anti-TGF beta 1-(91-103) antibodies recognized specifically TGF beta 1, prevented TGF beta 1 binding to NRK-49F cells, and neutralized the biological activity of TGF beta 1 in adrenocortical cells (consisting in the inhibition of angiotensin-II-induced cortisol production). Antibodies raised against TGF beta 2-(65-73) appeared to recognize TGF beta 2 with a better affinity than TGF beta 1, but were unable to block the binding of either TGF beta 1 or TGF beta 2 to their receptors or to inhibit their biological activity. These observations are in line with a prominant role of the C-terminal domain of TGF beta 1 in its interaction with its receptor(s) and, hence, in its biological activity. Using anti-TGF beta 1-(91-103) antibodies, we could localize immunoreactive TGF beta 1-like material in the cortex of adult bovine adrenal glands. No reactivity was detected in the capsule or adrenal medulla. The reactivity was maximal in the zona fasciculata/reticularis and weaker in the zona glomerulosa. TGF beta-like material was present in a latent form in the conditioned medium from primary cultures of bovine adrenocortical cells. These cells secreted about 5 ng heat-activatable TGF beta-like material/24 h of culture.10(6) cells. Taken together with our previous reports that bovine adrenocortical cells possess high affinity TGF beta 1 receptors and secrete a TGF beta 1-like molecule under a latent form, the present observations further support the hypothesis that TGF beta 1 or a closely immunologically related protein acts as an autocrine regulator of adrenocortical steroidogenic functions.\r"

  ".W": "Interleukin-1 (IL-1), a monokine released by activated monocytes during the acute phase of the inflammatory responses, has been reported to enhance hypophyseal ACTH release mainly by stimulating hypothalamic CRF secretion. We investigated a possible direct effect of IL-1 beta on the adrenal gland of the rat. IL-1 beta was found to dose-dependently (4-8 micrograms/kg) raise corticosterone (B) blood concentration in hypophysectomized rats, without inducing any significant increase in the level of circulating ACTH. IL-1 beta did not affect B production by either isolated rat inner adrenocortical cells or fragments of adrenocortical autotransplants lacking chromaffin cells, but dose-dependently (10(-8)-10(-6) M) enhanced that by adrenal slices including both cortex and medulla. The secretory effect of IL-1 beta (10(-6) M) was completely blocked by both alpha-helical-CRF (10(-6) M) and corticotropin-inhibiting peptide (10(-6) M), two competitive inhibitors which (at these concentrations) were able to annul B response of adrenal slices to CRF (10(-6) M) and ACTH (10(-8) M), respectively. In light of many findings indicating that adrenal medulla contains and releases CRF and numerous POMC-derived peptides (including ACTH), the hypothesis is advanced that the mechanism underlying the direct secretory effect of IL-1 beta on the adrenal gland may involve the activation of an intraadrenal CRF/ACTH system.\r"

Des-IGF I and IGF I were studied for their effects on DNA and collagen synthesis in cultures of intact fetal rat calvariae and of osteoblast-enriched (Ob) cells from fetal rat parietal bone, and for their ability to bind to IGF receptors in Ob cells and to IGF binding proteins (IGF-BPs) from calvariae. Des-IGF I and IGF I increased [3H] thymidine incorporation into DNA, [3H]proline incorporation into collagen and noncollagen protein, and the mitotic index in intact calvariae. Both factors had similar actions in calvariae. Des-IGF I stimulated all parameters studied at 1 nM, and IGF I was effective on the labeling of DNA at 1 nM, but concentrations of 10 nM were required to observe changes in collagen and noncollagen protein synthesis and in the mitotic index. The effect of des-IGF I on collagen synthesis was independent from that on DNA synthesis, as it is known for IGF I, and both forms of IGF I were equally potent for their inhibitory effects on collagen degradation in calvarial cultures. In Ob cells, neither des-IGF I nor IGF I altered the incorporation of [3H]thymidine into DNA, but both factors at 10-100 nM increased [3H]proline incorporation into collagen to a similar extent. Receptor studies revealed a similar binding capacity for des-IGF I and IGF I to the IGF I receptor(s) in Ob cells, although at 0.2 nM des-IGF I was slightly more effective than IGF I. In contrast, des-IGF I was 100-fold less effective than IGF I for its ability to bind to partially purified IGF-BPs from cultured calvariae. In conclusion, des-IGF I enhances calvarial DNA and collagen synthesis and osteoblastic collagen synthesis to a somewhat greater extent than IGF I, in spite of a much lesser affinity for IGF-BPs.\r"

In the present study, the effects of TMB-8 on cytosolic free calcium [Ca2+]i levels in FRTL-5 rat thyroid cells were determined using the fluorescent dye, Indo-1. TMB-8 increased [Ca2+]i in a dose-dependent manner, with a maximum rise from 120 +/- 7 nM to 229 +/- 16 nM (90 +/- 5% increase) at 5 x 10(-4) M. This effect was considerably reduced in Ca2+ free buffer, demonstrating a dependency upon extracellular calcium influx but not upon membrane potential and which did not involve the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger. In Ca2+ free buffer TMB-8, at a dose which did not affect [Ca2+]i, completely prevented norepinephrine (10(-5) M) from mobilizing intracellular Ca2+. To determine whether TMB-8 affected differentiated functions, iodide uptake and efflux studies were performed with 125I. TMB-8 (10(-4) M) inhibited iodide uptake by approximately 40% without affecting efflux. At 10(-3) M TMB-8, efflux was also enhanced. These studies demonstrate that TMB-8 has at least two effects on [Ca2+]i, promoting calcium influx and preventing alpha-1 adrenergic mobilization from intracellular stores. TMB-8 also has multiple effects on 125I transport, both inhibiting influx and increasing efflux. The results emphasize the importance of characterizing the behavior of this compound in any cell system before using it as a biological probe.\r"

Mutagenesis of the selenocysteine codon to a cysteine codon produced a protein with lower deiodinase activity. The presence or absence of selenocysteine in Type II deiodinase, which differs from the Type I enzyme in a number of parameters, has not been determined. Gold inhibits the activity of both the Type I deiodinase and the only other known eukaryotic selenocysteine-enzyme, glutathione peroxidase. Substitution of cysteine for selenocysteine in Type I deiodinase reduced its sensitivity to inhibition by gold 500-fold. We found that gold thioglucose was a competitive inhibitor with respect to the iodothyronine substrate of both deiodinases. However, the Type II enzyme from brown fat and pituitary was 100 to 1000-fold less sensitive to gold than was Type I activity in liver and pituitary, similar to the results with the cysteine-substituted Type I enzyme. This suggests that Type II deiodinase contains cysteine instead of selenocysteine in the active site.\r"

We have studied the processing of a C-peptide-deleted precursor of neuropeptide Y (NPY) in which the precursor terminates in the sequence Gly-Lys-Arg and does not require any dibasic specific endoproteolytic processing. Following transfection of CHO cells with an expression plasmid encoding this mutated NPY precursor, between 50 and 80 percent of the synthesized NPY was secreted from stable transfectants as authentic amidated NPY as assessed by both a C-terminal amide specific radioimmunoassay and by isoelectric focusing. It is concluded that amidated peptides can be produced in non-endocrine cells provided they are presented with a precursor which does not have to be endoproteolytically processed.\r"

IL-1 stimulates the central nervous system production of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), growth hormone (GH), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), and somatostatin, and inhibits the secretion of prolactin and luteinizing hormone (LH). Interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) is a novel cytokine, recently purified, characterized, and cloned. IL-1ra is a pure endogenous antagonist of IL-1:IL-1 function is modulated not only by local levels of IL-1, but also by the levels of IL-1ra. We have localized by in situ hybridization histochemistry IL-1ra mRNA in rat brain, in areas of importance to neuroendocrine function, such as the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus, hippocampus, as well as cerebellum. These findings indicate that IL-1ra is produced in brain in areas of relevance to the regulation of neuroendocrine function and suggest that IL-1ra may modulate the neuroendocrine effects of IL-1.\r"

  ".W": "While the elimination of androgens of testicular origin can be easily achieved by orchiectomy or medical castration with LHRH agonists, the action of adrenal androgen precursors which are converted into the active androgen 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) in the prostatic tissue itself can be partially neutralized by antiandrogens which compete with DHT for binding to the androgen receptor. In order to increase the efficiency of androgen blockade, we have used 4-MA, an inhibitor of 5 alpha-reductase, the enzyme which converts testosterone into DHT, to reduce intracellular DHT concentrations and thus facilitate the action of the antiandrogen Flutamide. The present data show that the inhibitory effects of 4-MA (17 beta, N,N-diethylcarbamoyl-4-methyl-4-aza-5 alpha-androstan-3-one) and of the antiandrogen Flutamide are additive on prostatic growth and on androgen-sensitive prostatic binding protein mRNA levels in the rat, thus clearly suggesting that such a combination could provide the basis for a further improvement in the therapy of prostate cancer.\r"

  ".W": "Dwarf (dw/dw) rats exhibit a 40% reduction in body growth, isolated GH deficiency (less than 5% of normal pituitary content), and a decreased number of pituitary somatotrophs (15-20% of normal). Since GH-releasing factor (GRF) stimulates GH synthesis and secretion and somatotroph proliferation, and its effects are probably mediated by cAMP, we have assessed GH secretion and cAMP production in dw rat pituitaries in response to various GH secretagogues. Dispersed pituitary cells from dw rats were less sensitive (2.5-fold) to stimulation of GH secretion by GRF and showed a 25% reduction in the maximal GH response even after normalization of their reduced GH content. Intracellular cAMP was elevated 63-fold over basal levels in normal cells after 4 h in response to maximal GRF stimulation, but only 1.9-fold in dw cells, and even larger differences between the groups were found at earlier time points. The GH responses of dw cells to exogenous cAMP, however, were indistinguishable from normal. Forskolin, a direct stimulator of adenylate cyclase, elicited comparable maximal GH and cAMP responses, but an increased ED50, in dw cells. Activation of GS alpha by cholera toxin showed an increased ED50 and reduced GH and cAMP responses in dw cells, and marked decreases in these responses were observed in response to prostaglandin E1. Phorbol ester stimulation resulted in a reduced maximal GH response in dw cells without a change in sensitivity. These results provide evidence for a defect in the GRF signal transduction pathway associated with a decreased ability of GS alpha to stimulate adenylate cyclase in dw rat somatotrophs that may be causally linked to their GH deficiency.\r"

  ".U": "91275829\r", 
  ".W": "The effects of purified human sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) on androgen-sensitive cell proliferation were examined using a human prostatic cell line (LNCaP-FGC). Cells were grown for 5 days in medium supplemented with 10% charcoal-dextran-stripped human serum (10% CDHuS) and various concentrations of 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone (DHT). In 10% CDHuS, without SHBG, the proliferative response of these cells to androgens was typically biphasic. At low androgen concentrations, cell yields were increased in a dose-dependent manner, reaching maximal levels at 0.3 nM DHT. However, at high androgen concentrations, cell proliferation was inhibited. Addition of purified human SHBG to the medium reduced the effectiveness of DHT on both phases of the proliferative response in a dose-dependent manner. These effects of SHBG appeared to be due primarily to the high affinity binding of DHT by SHBG. Proliferative responses induced by the synthetic androgen methyltrienolone (R1881), which binds poorly to SHBG, were not affected by added SHBG. Furthermore, analysis of the protein binding of DHT revealed that cell proliferation correlated best with the concentration of DHT not bound to SHBG. The presence of SHBG in the medium also altered the uptake and metabolism of DHT. LNCaP-FGC cells rapidly metabolized DHT to a polar glucuronidase-sensitive conjugate of DHT. In 10% CDHuS, LNCaP-FGC cells conjugated virtually all of the added DHT during the 5-day experiment. However, in medium containing SHBG, the SHBG-bound DHT remained unconjugated; more than 90% of the DHT initially bound to SHBG was present in the medium at the end of the experiment as unconjugated DHT. Uptake of radiolabeled DHT by cells was also inhibited by SHBG. In summary, these experiments provide evidence that 1) SHBG-bound DHT is not a signal for DHT-induced cell proliferation and 2) SHBG inhibits the uptake and metabolism of DHT by LNCaP-FGC cells.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of hyperthyroidism on liver glutathione (GSH) metabolism was studied in fed rats after the administration of 0.1 mg T3/kg body wt, for 1-3 consecutive days. T3-calorigenesis resulted in elevated rates of O2 consumption by the liver, together with higher lipid peroxidative processes and GSH depletion, compared to the euthyroid state. The study of the enzymes related to GSH metabolism revealed no significant changes in the activity of glutathione peroxidase and glutathione reductase, with decreases (27-41%) in the activity of glutathione-S-transferases and marked elevation (133%) in that of gamma-glutamyl transferase, 3 days after T3 treatment. At this experimental time, the activity of the NADPH generating enzyme glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase was enhanced by 84% in the liver of T3-treated rats, compared to that in the controls. In these conditions, the canalicular efflux of GSH was not altered by T3, whereas net and fractional rates of sinusoidal GSH efflux were enhanced by 86% and 288%, respectively. The latter effect of hyperthyroidism was found in parallel with an enhancement in sinusoidal lactate dehydrogenase and protein release, suggesting that loss of GSH might be related to a permeabilization of the hepatocyte plasma membrane. Liver GSH turnover assessed after a pulse of [35S]cysteine resulted in a 209% increase in the fractional turnover rate in hyperthyroid rats over controls, under steady state conditions for both hepatic GSH pools, leading to a 62% enhancement in the respective turnover flux. Data suggest that the elevation in the sinusoidal GSH efflux from the liver and in the hepatic capacity to degrade the tripeptide are major mechanisms leading to GSH depletion in the liver of T3-treated rats. As the increased GSH use is not balanced by the elevation in GSH synthesis, a lower steady state level of GSH is attained in the liver.\r"

  ".W": "Cyclosporin-A (CsA) has greatly influenced the outcome of organ transplantation and has also been effective in the treatment of many autoimmune diseases. Unfortunately, it has deleterious effects on bone remodelling, causing a high turnover bone loss, with bone resorption exceeding bone formation. Salmon calcitonin (SCtn) has been shown to inhibit bone resorption in high turnover states such as Paget's disease and postmenopausal osteoporosis. In an attempt to attenuate the high turnover bone remodelling caused by CsA alone, we studied the bone mineral effects of CsA in combination with SCtn in male Sprague-Dawley rats. Group A (n = 20) received vehicle as control, group B (n = 20) received CsA (15 mg/kg BW) by daily gavage and SCtn vehicle sc, group C (n = 20) received SCtn (1.3 IU/kg BW) daily sc and CsA vehicle, and group D (n = 20) received a combination of CsA and Ctn daily, as described above. Rats were bled weekly for determination of circulating biochemical bone parameters. Eight rats from each group were killed on day 14 (short term), and the remaining rats were killed on day 28 (long term). Tibiae were removed for bone histomorphometry after death, which revealed a reduction of trabecular bone volume and an increase in osteoclast number induced by CsA alone. These changes were significantly attenuated by the combination of CsA and SCtn to resemble the histomorphometry of the control group. The inhibition of osteoclast number by SCtn is the most plausible mechanism by which the combination therapy attenuates the high turnover bone loss induced by CsA alone.\r"

  ".U": "91275833\r", 
  ".W": "We have used streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetes in rats to determine whether this represents a sustained stimulus to the adrenocortical system and whether STZ-diabetic rats are able to mount an acute stress response. Furthermore, we compared pituitary responsiveness to CRF and/or arginine vasopressin, and adrenal responsiveness to ACTH in STZ- vs. vehicle-treated rats. We also compared the efficacy of dexamethasone inhibitory feedback in STZ-diabetic and control rats. Our results show that STZ-treated rats chronically hypersecrete corticosterone (B) as evidenced by their decreased thymus weights, their increased urinary B excretion, and their elevated mean plasma B levels during the light hours of the day. Despite the evidence for sustained hypersecretion of B, STZ-treated rats showed greater and more prolonged ACTH and B responses to the acute stress of histamine injection. However, when tested separately, neither pituitary nor adrenal responsiveness to their secretagogues were increased in STZ-diabetic compared to control rats. Dexamethasone inhibition of stress-induced B secretion was tested using two different paradigms: pentobarbital-anesthetized rats were given iv injections of acid saline, and awake rats were given ip injections of histamine. In both experiments the STZ-treated rats were relatively resistant to glucocorticoid inhibition of stress responses. This finding, taken together with the exaggerated ACTH and B responses to stress, strongly suggests that the facilitatory effects of chronic STZ-diabetes are a consequence of changes in sensitivity of central neural components of the adrenocortical system to stimulatory and/or inhibitory inputs, in conjunction with changes in glucocorticoid feedback sensitivity.\r"

Breathing movements have been demonstrated in the fetuses of every mammalian species investigated and appear to be part of normal fetal development. In this review we focus on the methods of measuring FB and on some of the problems associated with these measurements and their interpretation. We also review fetal behavior, the role of the peripheral and central chemoreceptors in spontaneous FB, the fetal respiratory response to hypercapnia and hypoxia, and the transition to continuous breathing at birth. It is clear that in many ways the control of breathing movements in utero differs from that after birth. In particular, inhibitory influences are much more prominent before than after birth. Possibly this is due to the unique fetal situation, in which conservation of energy may be more important than any advantage breathing activity imparts to the fetus.\r"

In eight animals, the parasternal intercostals were denervated in interspaces 1-5. This procedure caused a marked increase in the amount of external intercostal and levator costae inspiratory activity, and yet the inspiratory cranial motion of the rib was reduced by 55%. On the other hand, the external intercostals in interspaces 1-5 were sectioned in seven animals, and the reduction in the cranial rib motion was only 22%; the amount of parasternal and levator costae activity, however, was unchanged. When the parasternals in these animals were subsequently denervated, the levator costae inspiratory activity increased markedly, but the inspiratory cranial motion of the rib was abolished or reversed into an inspiratory caudal motion. These studies thus confirm that, in the dog breathing at rest, the parasternal intercostals have a larger role than the external intercostals and levator costae in causing the cranial motion of the ribs during inspiration. A quantitative analysis suggests that the parasternal contribution is approximately 80%.\r"

Exposure to nitrogen dioxide (NO2) at 4 ppm for 3 h resulted in a significant increase in the amount of lipid peroxidation products in the alveolar lining fluid, with conjugated dienes the predominant species. Four-week supplementation with vitamins C and E before NO2 exposure markedly decreased the levels of conjugated dienes (control 804 +/- 103 pmol/micrograms total phospholipids vs. vitamin-supplemented 369 +/- 58, P = 0.003). Malondialdehydes, although detectable in the lavage fluid, contributed little to the total amount of lipid peroxidation products, and the levels were comparable in both groups. NO2 exposure in the absence of vitamin supplementation caused a significant decrease in the elastase inhibitory capacity (EIC) of the alveolar lining fluid in the control group but not in the vitamin-supplemented group [control 3.67 +/- 0.32 micrograms alpha 1-PI/micrograms porcine pancreatic elastase (PPE) vs. vitamin-supplemented 2.75 +/- 0.17, P less than 0.03]. The vitamin-supplemented group had a lower level of conjugated dienes and a higher EIC. Conversely, the control group had higher levels of conjugated dienes and a lower EIC in their lavage fluid. These studies demonstrate that lipid peroxidation occurs as an early event during oxidant exposure in the lungs of normal subjects. The appearance of lipid peroxidation products in the lavage fluid is associated with a decrease in the EIC of the alveolar lining fluid. Vitamins C and E diminish lipid peroxidation and preserve the EIC of the lower respiratory tract fluid during oxidant stress.\r"

  ".W": "It has been previously observed that the thermic effect of a glucose load is potentiated by prior exercise. To determine whether this phenomenon is observed when different carbohydrates are used and to ascertain the role of insulin, the thermic effects of fructose and glucose were compared during control (rest) and postexercise trials. Six male subjects ingested 100 g fructose or glucose at rest or after recovery from 45 min of treadmill exercise at 70% of maximal O2 consumption. Measurements of O2 consumption, respiratory exchange ratio, and plasma concentrations of glucose, insulin, glycerol, and lactate were measured for 3 h postingestion. Although glucose and fructose increased net energy expenditure by 44 and 51 kcal, respectively, over baseline during control trials, exercise increased the thermic effect of both carbohydrate challenges an additional 20-25 kcal (P less than 0.05). Glucose ingestion was associated with large (P less than 0.05) increases in plasma insulin concentration during control and exercise trials, in contrast to fructose ingestion. Because fructose, which is primarily metabolized by liver, and glucose elicited a similar postexercise potentiation of thermogenesis, the results indicate that the thermogenic phenomenon is not limited to skeletal muscle. These results also demonstrate that carbohydrate-induced postexercise thermogenesis is not related to an incremental increase in plasma insulin concentration.\r"

We performed paired experiments on chronically catheterized rabbits to compare left ventricular (LV) infusion with femoral venous (FV) infusion of L-[U-14C]lactate. Blood was sampled from both the femoral artery (FA) and right ventricle (RV) during both modes of infusion. The mean lactate specific activity measured for each combination (infusion site, sampling site) was (FV,FA) 4,380 +/- 452, (FV,RV) 4,370 +/- 471, (LV,FA) 4,364 +/- 239, and (LV,RV) 3,325 +/- 240 (SE) dpm/mumol. Lactate turnover calculated from the specific activity in the (LV,RV) mode was significantly higher than from the other three modes (P less than 0.001). Models of lactate turnover are discussed demonstrating that the (FV,FA) and analogous modes of infusion sampling measure the turnover rate of lactate molecules that cycle through the circulation. This estimate of turnover is less than the turnover rate by the whole organism to the extent that some produced lactate is metabolized locally without entering the general circulation. The turnover calculated by the (LV,RV) mode overestimates the turnover of circulating lactate and relates to whole body lactate turnover in a complex manner.\r"

During hypoxia, the phrenic neurogram was progressively depressed and became silent when arterial O2 content (CaO2) was reduced by 62 +/- 3% (SE). Gasping was seen in the phrenic neurogram when CaO2 was reduced by 78 +/- 1%. Medullary [K+]ec, an indicator of energy production failure due to O2 insufficiency, was 3.2 +/- 0.4 mM before hypoxia and was statistically unchanged at the onset of phrenic apnea during CO hypoxia (4 +/- 0.7 mM). By the onset of gasping, [K+]ec had increased to 6.1 +/- 1 mM, a value that tended to be different from control (P less than 0.1). After initiation of gasping, the rate of rise of [K+]ec increased, and [K+]ec reached a maximum value of 14.3 +/- 2.7 mM before hypoxia was terminated. With reoxygenation, [K+]ec returned to control levels within 20 min. On the basis of these results, we have drawn two major conclusions. 1) Hypoxic depression to the point of phrenic apnea does not appear to be caused by medullary energy insufficiency as measured by loss of [K+]ec homeostasis. 2) The rapid rise in [K+]ec in the medulla that characterizes severe hypoxia is closely associated with the onset of gasping in the phrenic neurogram, suggesting that gasping may serve as a marker for loss of medullary ionic homeostasis and thus onset of medullary energy insufficiency during hypoxia.\r"

On two occasions, eight males completed 2 h of intermittent cycle ergometer exercise (4 bouts of 17 min at 60% and 3 min at 80% of maximal O2 consumption/10 min rest) to reduce muscle glycogen concentrations (control values 711 +/- 41 mumol/g dry wt). During one trial, cycle exercise was followed by several hours of light upper body exercise in the heat without fluid replacement to induce HY (-5% body wt); in the second trial, sufficient water was ingested during the upper body exercise and heat exposure to maintain euhydration (EU). In both trials, 400 g of carbohydrate were ingested at the completion of exercise and followed by 15 h of rest while the desired hydration level was maintained. Muscle biopsy samples were obtained from the vastus lateralis immediately after intermittent cycle exercise (T1) and after 15 h of rest (T2). During the HY trial, the muscle water content was lower (P less than 0.05) at T1 and T2 (288 +/- 9 and 265 +/- 5 ml/100 g dry wt, respectively; NS) than during EU (313 +/- 8 and 301 +/- 4 ml/100 g dry wt, respectively; NS). Muscle glycogen concentration was not significantly different during EU and HY at T1 (200 +/- 35 vs. 251 +/- 50 mumol/g dry wt) or T2 (452 +/- 34 vs. 491 +/- 35 mumol/g dry wt). These data indicate that, despite reduced water content during the first 15 h after heavy exercise, skeletal muscle glycogen resynthesis is not impaired.\r"

Hepatic malonyl-CoA content decreases when glucose availability decreases such as during fasting or when the glucagon-to-insulin ratio increases such as during prolonged exercise or in response to insulin deficiency. To investigate the effect of glucose infusion on muscle malonyl-CoA during exercise, male rats were anesthetized (pentobarbital via venous catheters) at rest or after running (21 m/min, 15% grade) for 30 or 60 min. During exercise rats were infused with either glucose (0.625 g/ml) or saline at a rate of 1.5 ml/h. Gastrocnemius muscles and liver samples were frozen at liquid nitrogen temperature. Muscle malonyl-CoA decreased from 1.24 +/- 0.06 to 0.69 +/- 0.05 nmol/g with glucose infusion and to 0.43 +/- 0.04 nmol/g with saline infusion during 60 min of exercise. In the liver, glucose infusion prevented the drop in malonyl-CoA. This indicates that glucose infusion attenuates the progressive decline in muscle malonyl-CoA and prevents the decline in liver malonyl-CoA during prolonged exercise.\r"

Dietary protein intake was 2 g.kg body mass-1.day-1, and fat intake was adjusted to maintain body mass. Twelve male and 10 female collegiate rowers were randomly assigned to the treatment groups. Training was 40 min at 70% peak O2 consumption (VO2) (A.M.) and either three 2,500-m time trials to assess power output or interval training at 70-90% peak VO2 (P.M.). Mean daily training was 65 min at 70% peak VO2 and 38 min at greater than or equal to 90% peak VO2. Mean muscle glycogen content increased 65% in the HI group (P less than 0.05) but remained constant at 119 mmol/kg in the MOD group over the 4 wk. Mean power output in time trials increased 10.7 and 1.6% after 4 wk in the HI and MOD groups, respectively (P less than 0.05). We conclude that a diet with 10 g carbohydrate.kg body mass-1.day-1 promotes greater muscle glycogen content and greater power output during training than a diet containing 5 g carbohydrate.kg body mass-1.day-1 over 4 wk of intense twice-daily rowing training.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The subject, seated or lying supine on a force platform, performed breathing maneuvers in which rib cage volume (Vrc) and abdominal volume (Vab) were changed in varying proportions. The increment in the vertical force exerted on the platform and Vrc and Vab were measured over the course of each maneuver. The force signal was integrated twice with respect to time to obtain the change in the product of mass and height of the subject. This was multiplied by the gravitational acceleration to obtain the change in the gravitational potential (Ug). Simultaneous values of Ug, Vrc, and Vab were taken from the data, and the values of the coefficients for which the following equation best fit these values were determined: Ug = a1 Vrc + a2 Vab + (1/2)a11 Vrc2 + a12 Vrc Vab + (1/2)a22 Vab2. The coefficients a1 and a2 can be interpreted as the values of the expiratory gravitational forces on the rib cage and abdomen, respectively. In the seated posture, the force on the rib cage is expiratory and the force on the abdomen is inspiratory; the magnitudes of both are approximately 8 cmH2O. In the supine posture, both are expiratory forces of approximately 9 cmH2O. The coefficients of the quadratic terms in Ug are all positive, and the gravitational work per unit volume of chest wall expansion increases with increasing volume in both postures. The coefficients of the quadratic terms can be interpreted as gravitational contributions to the elastances of the compartments.\r"

To distinguish between alveolar corner vessels and alveolar septal vessels as a possible zone 1 pathway, we made in vivo microscopic observations of the subpleural alveolar capillaries in five anesthetized dogs. Videomicroscopic recordings were made via a transparent thoracic window with the animal in the right lateral position. From recordings of the uppermost surface of the left lung, alveolar septal and corner vessels were classified depending on whether they were located within or between alveoli, respectively. Observations were made with various levels of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) applied only to the left lung via a double-lumen endotracheal tube. Consistent with convention, flow through septal vessels stopped when PEEP was raised to the mean pulmonary arterial pressure (the zone 1-zone 2 border). However, flow through alveolar corner vessels continued until PEEP was 8-16 cmH2O greater than mean pulmonary arterial pressure (8-16 cm into zone 1). These direct observations support the idea that alveolar corner vessels rather than patent septal vessels provide the pathway for blood flow under zone 1 conditions.\r"

These experiments were undertaken to test whether fetal adenosine, normally present in high concentrations, suppresses lipolysis in utero and then falls after birth, permitting thermogenesis to begin. To test this hypothesis, we measured fetal plasma adenosine concentration [ADO] using high-performance liquid chromatography in 11 fetal sheep at 135-140 days gestation during simulated birth. During an initial control period, fetal [ADO] averaged 1.9 +/- 0.3 microM, about four times maternal [ADO] (0.4 +/- 0.1 microM, P less than 0.001). The fetus was then cooled by circulating cold water through a plastic coil encircled about the fetal torso. One hour later, when fetal core temperature had decreased 2.3 degrees C, fetal [ADO] averaged 2.8 +/- 0.5 microM, a 50% increase (P less than 0.05), while thermogenesis remained inactive. Next the fetal lungs were ventilated with O2 to raise arterial Po2 to greater than or equal to 150 Torr. Fetal [ADO] decreased only slightly, and thermogenic responses were modest. Finally, the umbilical cord was occluded. Fetal [ADO] decreased rapidly and 60 min later averaged 1.1 +/- 0.2 microM, 40% below initial control (P less than 0.05) and 57% below the previous period (P less than 0.001). As [ADO] fell, strong thermogenic responses became apparent, as indicated by seven- to eightfold increases in plasma glycerol (P less than 0.001) and a doubling in fetal O2 consumption (P less than 0.001). These results are consistent with the hypothesis that high fetal [ADO] inhibits thermogenesis before birth but then decreases after cord occlusion, allowing thermogenesis to begin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To test the possibility that exercise may counteract a life-extending effect of decreased availability of energy for certain biological processes such as cell proliferation, we examined the combined effects of exercise and food restriction on longevity of male rats. As before, wheel running improved average length of life, 978 +/- 172 vs. 875 +/- 175 (SD) days, for the sedentary controls (P less than 0.01) without increasing maximal life span. Paired-weight controls, food restricted (approximately 30% below ad libitum) to weight the same as the runners, showed increases in both average (1,056 +/- 144 days) and maximal life span. Food-restricted runners, with intake restricted to the same extent (approximately 30%), had an increased mortality rate over the first approximately 50% of their survival curve up to approximately 900 days of age; their average life span (995 +/- 226) was similar to that of the control group of runners and shorter than that of their paired-weight food-restricted sedentary controls (1,088 +/- 159 days, P less than 0.05). However, after approximately 900 days of age the food-restricted runners' survival became similar to that of the food-restricted sedentary groups, with a comparable increase in maximal life span. Thus the exercise did not counteract the increase in maximal life span induced by food restriction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The resistances were calculated by three different methods: 1) as the real part of the complex impedance obtained from regular ventilation data, 2) as the effective resistance of a two-compartment model fitted to the same data, and 3) as the resistance of a single-compartment model fitted to data obtained during sinusoidal ventilation at various frequencies. Alveolar pressures were measured by a closed-chest alveolar capsule technique and afforded a direct measure of airways resistance. All three resistance estimates were very similar and decreased markedly with frequency between 0 and 1 Hz. The real part of lung impedance at the higher frequencies investigated (around 5 Hz) closely approximated airways resistance, as predicted by the eight-parameter viscoelastic model of respiratory mechanics proposed by Bates et al.

Stoma density was 250 +/- 242 and 72 +/- 57 (SD) stomata/mm2 on peritoneal and pleural sides, respectively, and it was similar over the muscular and tendinous portion of the two surfaces. The maximum diameter ranged from less than 1 to approximately 30 microns, with an average value of 1.2 +/- 3.1 micron. The ratio of the maximum to the minimum diameter and the surface area averaged 2 +/- 1.4 and 0.7 +/- 2.4 micron 2, respectively. The maximum and minimum diameter and surface area values followed a lognormal frequency distribution, suggesting that stomata geometry is affected by diaphragmatic tension.\r"

To investigate this possibility, food passage rate (mouth-to-large intestinal lactulose transit) and absorption (xylose) were compared in a cross section of young men chosen to represent a wide range of daily physical activity and food intake. In 20 men (energy intake 1,272-5,342 kcal/day), resting mouth-to-cecum transit was faster in high caloric consumers (r = -0.69, P less than 0.01). In contrast, xylose absorption (n = 26; measured either as urinary xylose excretion or integrated breath H2 production from the sugar) was unrelated to food intake. Dietary fiber intake was uncorrelated with energy intake. This apparent human digestive strategy of rapid transit across the gut absorptive surface, without a sacrifice in absorption, parallels the adaptations made by several animal species similarly faced with increased energy demand at constant fiber intake. We therefore conclude that the hyperphagia of chronic exercise in humans may be linked with significant gastrointestinal adaptations.\r"

We hypothesized that the relative contribution of these two groups to expiration would affect diaphragmatic length and, hence, influence the subsequent inspiration. To address this question we measured the respiratory muscle response to expiratory threshold loading in spontaneously breathing anesthetized dogs. Prevagotomy, the increase in lung volume (functional residual capacity) and decrease in initial resting length of the diaphragm were attenuated by greater than 50% of values predicted by the passive relationships. Diaphragmatic activation (electromyogram) increased and tidal volume (VT) was preserved. Postvagotomy, effective expiratory muscle recruitment was abolished. The triangularis sterni muscle remained active, and the increase in lung volume was attenuated by less than 15% of that predicted by the passive relationship. Diaphragmatic length was shorter than predicted. VT was not restored, even though costal diaphragmatic and parasternal intercostal electromyogram increased. During expiratory threshold loading with abdominal muscles resected and vagus intact, recruitment of the rib cage expiratory muscles produced a reduction in lung volume comparable with prevagotomy; however, diaphragmatic length decreased markedly. Both the rib cage and abdominal expiratory muscles may defend lung volume; however, their combined action is important to restore diaphragmatic initial length and, accordingly, to preserve VT.\r"

Exercise training significantly increased muscle citrate synthase activity. Prevailing hyperglycemia was reduced during the 10-wk exercise training period in all T rats with fed-state glucose concentrations less than 300, and only 53% of Unt rats in these groups had reduced glycemia. GSIS was significantly higher in T less than 200 [2.4 +/- 0.7 (SD) ng/ml at 90 min] than in Unt less than 200 (1.5 +/- 0.3).

Sedentary (n = 11) and trained (n = 11) hindlimbs of similar size were perfused with a similar inflow (12.1 ml/min) at a similar oxygen content (18.1 ml O2/100 ml blood). Tetanic contractions (100 ms at 100 Hz) at 4, 8, 15, 30, 45, and 60/min were elicited in consecutive order. Initial tension was better maintained by muscles of trained animals at all frequencies above 4 tetani/min (P less than 0.05). Oxygen consumption (mumol.min-1.g-1) increased similarly in both groups at the lower contraction frequencies but was greater (P less than 0.05) in the trained [3.52 +/- 0.32 (SE)] than in the sedentary (2.44 +/- 0.31) group at 60 tetani/min. The peak oxygen consumption of the trained group (3.93 +/- 0.27) was 20% greater (P less than 0.05) than that of the sedentary group (3.28 +/- 0.28) when peak values for each animal, irrespective of the contraction condition, are compared.

Anesthetized sheep with lung lymph fistulas were utilized to access the three compartments of the lung relevant to studies of transpulmonary neutrophil migration. Serum, lung lymph, and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid were studied for neutrophil influx and chemotactic activity before and after administration of endotoxin by either an intravascular or inhaled alveolar route. Both groups developed significant neutrophil influx into the lymph and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid by 3 h postendotoxin. Those animals receiving intravascular endotoxin developed chemotactic gradients opposing neutrophil migration into the lung in contrast to animals receiving alveolar endotoxin, suggesting that neutrophil influx into the lung occurs by random migration.\r"

If so, there could be a difference between in vivo and in vitro arterial pH, the magnitude of which would be dependent on the venoarterial pH difference (v-aDpH). We tested this hypothesis in anesthetized dogs by changing v-aDpH by airway CO2 loading and by comparing arterial pH measured in vivo by a rapidly responding intravascular pH electrode with that measured in vitro by a conventional glass electrode. Using a multiple regression analysis, we found a small but significant contribution of venous pH to in vivo arterial pH, with a regression coefficient of 0.0718 (P less than 0.0001), suggesting a postcapillary increase of in vivo arterial pH. When carbonic anhydrase was inhibited by the administration of acetazolamide, the effect of venous pH on arterial pH was abolished, and a unique relationship between in vivo and in vitro arterial pH was established (regression coefficient 1.02; P greater than 0.05, comparison with unity). These results could be accounted for in a computer simulation of gas exchange among alveolus, plasma, and erythrocyte. We conclude that there exists a small but measurable postcapillary increase in arterial pH.\r"

Muscle ATP concentration was well maintained during hypoxia, and increased glucose transport activity was still present after 15 min of reoxygenation despite repletion of phosphocreatine. However, the increase in glucose transport activity completely reversed during a 180-min-long recovery in oxygenated medium. In perfused rat hindlimb muscles, hypoxia caused an increase in glucose transporters in the plasma membrane, suggesting that glucose transporter translocation plays a role in the stimulation of glucose transport by hypoxia. The maximal effects of hypoxia and insulin on glucose transport activity were additive, whereas the effects of exercise and hypoxia were not, providing evidence suggesting that hypoxia and exercise stimulate glucose transport by the same mechanism. Caffeine, at a concentration too low to cause muscle contraction or an increase in glucose transport by itself, markedly potentiated the effect of a submaximal hypoxic stimulus on sugar transport. Dantrolene significantly inhibited the hypoxia-induced increase in 3-O-methylglucose transport. These effects of caffeine and dantrolene suggest that Ca2+ plays a role in the stimulation of glucose transport by hypoxia.\r"

This method revealed a bimodal distribution of local vascular resistance vs. cumulative vascular volume under the zone 3 conditions studied. Our interpretation of the two modes of relatively high resistance is that they correspond to high resistance per unit volume segments of the arteries and veins upstream and downstream from the relatively low resistance per unit volume capillary bed. Thus an increase in the height of the upstream and downstream modes of the resistance distribution suggests constriction in small arteries and veins, respectively. Horizontal displacement of the modes along the cumulative volume axis suggests changes in the distribution of volume among the arteries, veins, and capillary bed. By use of these criteria, the results are consistent with the concept that each of the vasoconstrictor stimuli studied had a different longitudinal response pattern. Hypoxia constricted mainly small arteries, whereas serotonin constricted small and large arteries. Histamine constricted large and small veins, and norepinephrine constricted large and small veins and arteries.\r"

Because the lung periphery has distinctive responses to cholinergic agonists and a lower density of vagal fibers and cholinergic receptors than the central airways, we partitioned the respiratory resistance of the piglets between central airways (Rc) and peripheral airways and lung tissue (Rp) with bronchial catheters inserted in a retrograde manner. The piglets were anesthetized with alpha-chloralose and ventilated with positive airway pressure. Vagotomy did not change Rc or Rp in either the newborn or the 6-wk-old piglets. Vagal stimulation, on the other hand, increased both Rc (median increase 53% in the newborn and 72% in the 6-wk-old piglets) and Rp (54 and 42%, respectively). At all states of vagal tone, Rp increased as the lungs were inflated, suggesting a large contribution of tissue viscoelasticity to this resistance. Our results demonstrate that vagal bronchomotor tone is absent during mechanical ventilation with positive pressure in the developing piglet. However, vagal innervation of both central airways and tissue contractile elements is functionally competent at the time of birth in this species.\r"

In particular, we wondered whether induction of fatigue would result in rapid shallow breathing during inspiratory resistive loading. The breathing pattern during inspiratory resistive loading was measured for 5 min in the absence of fatigue (control) and immediately after induction of either inspiratory muscle fatigue or diaphragmatic fatigue. Data were separately analyzed for the 1st and 5th min of resistive loading to distinguish between immediate and sustained effects. Fatigue was achieved by having the subjects breathe against an inspiratory threshold load while generating a predetermined fraction of either the maximal mouth pressure or maximal transdiaphragmatic pressure until they could no longer reach the target pressure. Compared with control, there were no significant alterations in breathing pattern after induction of fatigue during either the 1st or 5th min of resistive loading, regardless of whether fatigue was induced in the majority of the inspiratory muscles or just in the diaphragm. We conclude that the development of inspiratory muscle fatigue does not alter the breathing pattern response to large inspiratory resistive loads.\r"

In this model, 12 cm of the cervical trachea were isolated using a double-cuffed endotracheal tube and injured with cotton smoke at near room temperature. Injury to the trachea was evaluated in twenty-five anesthetized sheep 4 (n = 3), 8 (n = 3), 24 (n = 3), 48 (n = 3), 96 (n = 3), and 192 (n = 2) h after smoke exposure and compared with sham control animals (n = 8).

Polymyxin B, a cyclic decapeptide antibiotic, inhibits the stimulation of glucose uptake in isolated muscle by contractile activity but also decreases tension development in electrically stimulated muscle. The purpose of this study was to determine whether polymyxin B also inhibits contraction-stimulated glucose uptake after in vivo administration of the drug and to examine the relationship between the effects of polymyxin B on tension development and its effects on contraction-stimulated glucose uptake. When polymyxin B was administered to rats in vivo, glucose uptake in muscle after electrical stimulation was decreased, despite the same amount of tension developed as in control rats, indicating an effect of polymyxin B on glucose transport independent of tension development. Our results also indicate that the postexercise increase in glucose uptake is a function of the tension developed by prior contractions. When muscles were perfused with medium containing polymyxin B, this relationship was disrupted. These results provide evidence that polymyxin B causes a decrease in muscle glucose uptake independent of its effects on tension development. The extent to which its effects on glucose uptake are also the result of a diminution in contractile force is uncertain.\r"

AR activity was measured with intramuscular hooked-wire electrodes implanted by means of a fiber-optic nasopharyngoscope. Correct placement of the electrodes was confirmed by discharge patterns during voluntary maneuvers. The AR usually exhibited respiratory-related activity during quiet breathing in all awake subjects. Tonic activity was frequently present throughout the respiratory cycle. The pattern of phasic discharge during wakefulness exhibited considerable intrasubject variability both in timing and level of activity. Phasic activity usually began in midinspiration and terminated in mid- to late expiration. Periods of biphasic discharge were observed in four subjects. Phasic discharge primarily confined to expiration was also commonly observed. During quiet breathing in wakefulness, the level of phasic AR activity appeared to be directly related to the time of expiration. The AR was electrically silent in the six subjects who achieved stable periods of non-rapid-eye-movement sleep. Rapid-eye-movement sleep was observed in three subjects and was associated with sporadic paroxysmal bursts of AR activity. The results during wakefulness indicate that vocal cord adduction in expiration is an active phenomenon and suggest that the larynx may have an active role in braking exhalation.\r"

Small volumes (0.5-1.0 ml) of Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate (KRB) were trapped in the distal air space of the isolated vascular-perfused left lung lobes while the airways were blocked by immiscible O2-carrying fluorocarbon. Lobe weight was lost or gained in response to colloid gradients and was raised by metabolic inhibitors but did not change with only fluorocarbon in the air space or in response to modifiers of epithelial ion transport. When serum was added to the KRB-colloid perfusion, weight loss occurred in the absence of a colloid gradient (3.4 ml/min) and was Na+ dependent (inhibited by luminal Na(+)-free KRB). The change in the concentration of blue dextran in liquid sampled by micropuncture from subpleural alveoli was smaller than expected from lobe weight under basal conditions or with a colloid gradient, even though the volume marker accurately detected edema formation (weight gain) induced by metabolic inhibitors. We conclude that 1) weight changes represent volume absorption from the air spaces, 2) serum stimulates a Na+ absorptive process, and 3) by exclusion, small airways and/or other subpopulations of alveoli are the site of this absorption.\r"

To obviate any subtle influences of development on Vmax aside from simple increases in surface area, we correlated Vmax with postmortem stereological assessments of alveolar surface area in the relatively mature lung of the 2-mo-old lamb (n = 14). We attempted to increase the range of surface area beyond its normal variability by injecting nine of the lambs with bleomycin, an antineoplastic agent with significant pulmonary toxicity in other species. Vmax, measured shortly after birth and then weekly, increased monotonically in all lambs. Despite their wide dispersion, Vmax and the stereological determinations correlated strongly at 2 mo of age, confirming that Vmax is a robust indicator of the surface area of the air-blood barrier. There was no significant difference in either measurement between the control lambs and those treated with bleomycin, suggesting that the newborn lamb is resistant to the effect of this agent.\r"

Total force application to the machine lever arm was determined via a strain gauge and computer interfaced system and was equated between trials. Compared with the I-70 trial, the I-35 trial was characterized by almost double the repetitions (13 +/- 1 vs. 6 +/- 0) and half the peak concentric torque for each repetition (12.4 +/- 0.5 vs. 24.2 +/- 1.0 Nm). After the sixth set, muscle glycogen degradation was similar between I-70 and I-35 trials (47.0 +/- 6.6 and 46.6 +/- 6.0 mmol/kg wet wt, respectively), as was muscle lactate accumulation (13.8 +/- 0.7 and 16.7 +/- 4.2 mmol/kg wet wt, respectively). After 2 h of passive recovery without caloric intake, muscle glycogen increased by 22.2 +/- 6.8 and 14.2 +/- 2.5 mmol/kg wet wt in the I-70 and I-35 trials, respectively. Optical absorbance measurement of periodic acid-Schiff-stained muscle sections after the 2 h of recovery revealed larger absorbance increases in fast-twitch than in slow-twitch fibers (0.119 +/- 0.024 and 0.055 +/- 0.024, P = 0.02). Data indicated that when external work was constant, the absolute amount of muscle glycogenolysis was the same regardless of the intensity of resistance exercise. Nevertheless the rate of glycogenolysis during the I-70 trial was approximately double that of the I-35 trial.\r"

Peptides were infused into the lobar artery under conditions of elevated pulmonary vascular tone by prostaglandin F2 alpha (PGF2 alpha, 20 micrograms/min). Pulmonary airway lobar dynamic compliance (Cdyn) and airway resistance (Re) were computed from simultaneously measured airway pressure and airflow entering the lobe through a Carlens endobronchial divider. PGF2 alpha infusion slightly reduced Cdyn (-20%) and increased Re (+11%) while lobar arterial pressure rose from 14 +/- 1 to 31 +/- 2 mmHg (n = 12). In these conditions, lobar artery infusion of SP (0.5-50 pmol/min) or CGRP (15-5,000 pmol/min) produced a dose-dependent decrease in the pressor response to PGF2 alpha, reaching -54 +/- 3 and -64 +/- 7%, respectively, without alterations in lung mechanics. On a molar basis, SP was more effective than CGRP; its vasodilatory effect was more rapid and of shorter duration. Higher CGRP infusion rates were not studied because of marked systemic hypotension. SP infused at 150, 500, and 1,000 pmol/min significantly reduced Cdyn by 12 +/- 2, 24 +/- 4, and 62 +/- 7%, respectively, but also induced a rise in lobar arterial pressure and a fall in systemic arterial pressure. The results show that both SP and CGRP are potent pulmonary vasodilators. In contrast to CGRP, which did not affect lung mechanics, high infusion rates of SP decreased Cdyn and increased Re.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

This study examined the effect of a constant duration (30 min) of cycle ergometer exercise at varied intensity levels [50 and 70% of maximal O2 consumption (VO2max)] on 3-h recovery of oxygen uptake (VO2). VO2 and respiratory exchange ratios were measured by open-circuit spirometry in five trained female cyclists (age 25 +/- 1.7 yr) and five untrained females (age 27 +/- 0.8 yr). Postexercise VO2 measured at intervals for 3 h after exercise was greater (P less than 0.01) after exercise at 50% VO2max in trained (0.40 +/- 0.01 l/min) and untrained subjects (0.39 +/- 0.01 l/min) than after 70% VO2max in (0.31 +/- 0.02 l/min) and untrained subjects (0.29 +/- 0.02 l/min). The lower respiratory exchange ratio values (P less than 0.01) after 50% VO2max in trained (0.78 +/- 0.01) and untrained subjects (0.80 +/- 0.01) compared with 70% VO2max in trained (0.81 +/- 0.01) and untrained subjects (0.83 +/- 0.01) suggest that an increase in fat metabolism may be implicated in the long-term elevation of metabolism after exercise. This was supported by the greater estimated fatty acid oxidation (P less than 0.05) after 50% VO2max in trained (147 +/- 4 mg/min) and untrained subjects (133 +/- 9 mg/min) compared with 70% VO2max in trained (101 +/- 6 mg/min) and untrained subjects (85 +/- 7 mg/min).\r"

  ".W": "Maximum O2 and CO2 fluxes during exercise were less perturbed by hypoxia in Quechua natives from the Andes than in lowlanders. In exploring how this was achieved, we found that, for a given work rate, Quechua highlanders at 4,200 m accumulated substantially less lactate than lowlanders at sea level normoxia (approximately 5-7 vs. 10-14 mM) despite hypobaric hypoxia. This phenomenon, known as the lactate paradox, was entirely refractory to normoxia-hypoxia transitions. In lowlanders, the lactate paradox is an acclimation; however, in Quechuas, the lactate paradox is an expression of metabolic organization that did not deacclimate, at least over the 6-wk period of our study. Thus it was concluded that this metabolic organization is a developmentally or genetically fixed characteristic selected because of the efficiency advantage of aerobic metabolism (high ATP yield per mol of substrate metabolized) compared with anaerobic glycolysis. Measurements of respiratory quotient indicated preferential use of carbohydrate as fuel for muscle work, which is also advantageous in hypoxia because it maximizes the yield of ATP per mol of O2 consumed. Finally, minimizing the cost of muscle work was also reflected in energetic efficiency as classically defined (power output per metabolic power input); this was evident at all work rates but was most pronounced at submaximal work rates (efficiency approximately 1.5 times higher than in lowlander athletes). Because plots of power output vs. metabolic power input did not extrapolate to the origin, it was concluded 1) that exercise in both groups sustained a significant ATP expenditure not convertible to mechanical work but 2) that this expenditure was downregulated in Andean natives by thus far unexplained mechanisms.\r"

  ".W": "In the mammalian lung, alveolar gas and blood are separated by an extremely thin membrane, despite the fact that mechanical failure could be catastrophic for gas exchange. We raised the pulmonary capillary pressure in anesthetized rabbits until stress failure occurred. At capillary transmural pressures greater than or equal to 40 mmHg, disruption of the capillary endothelium and alveolar epithelium was seen in some locations. The three principal forces acting on the capillary wall were analyzed. 1) Circumferential wall tension caused by the transmural pressure. This is approximately 25 dyn/cm (25 mN/m) at failure where the radius of curvature of the capillary is 5 microns. This tension is small, being comparable with the tension in the alveolar wall associated with lung elastic recoil. 2) Surface tension of the alveolar lining layer. This contributes support to the capillaries that bulge into the alveolar spaces at these high pressures. When protein leakage into the alveolar spaces occurs because of stress failure, the increase in surface tension caused by surfactant inhibition could be a powerful force preventing further failure. 3) Tension of the tissue elements in the alveolar wall associated with lung inflation. This may be negligible at normal lung volumes but considerable at high volumes. Whereas circumferential wall tension is low, capillary wall stress at failure is very high at approximately 8 x 10(5) dyn/cm2 (8 x 10(4) N/m2) where the thickness is only 0.3 microns. This is approximately the same as the wall stress of the normal aorta, which is predominantly composed of collagen and elastin. The strength of the thin part of the capillary wall is probably attributable to the collagen IV of the basement membranes. The safety factor is apparently small when the capillary pressure is raised during heavy exercise. Stress failure causes increased permeability with protein leakage, or frank hemorrhage, and probably has a role in several types of lung disease.\r"

The HDL were labeled with 131I in the apoproteins and with cholesteryl-[1-14C]oleate in the esters. The HDL were intravenously administered to endurance-trained (n = 10) and cage-sedentary (n = 10) rats. Blood samples were taken over the next 36 h while the rats were conscious and feeding. The trained rats had higher plasma HDL cholesterol (0.72 vs. 0.28 mM) and HDL apoprotein (461 vs. 267 mg/l) concentrations than the sedentary rats. The production or disposal rate of HDL cholesteryl ester was higher in the trained rats (1.36 mumol/h) than in the sedentary rats (0.72 mumol/h), whereas the production or disposal rate of HDL apoproteins was similar in the trained (0.64 mg/h) and sedentary (0.60 mg/h) rats. The residence time of the HDL cholesteryl esters (4.72 +/- 0.22 vs. 3.37 +/- 0.21 h) and HDL apoprotein (7.65 +/- 0.36 vs. 4.55 +/- 0.28 h) was longer for the trained than for the sedentary rats.

In phase space constructions from volume measurements, the respiratory behavior of the vagotomized rat is seen to be unimodal and periodic, whereas that of the vagi-intact animal is bimodal and sensitive to initial conditions and displays stretching and folding of trajectories. By use of the correlation integral, the dimension and entropy were estimated for the respiratory patterns of five urethan-anesthetized rats (before and after vagotomy) and two awake animals (resting, vagi intact only). The results indicate that the central respiratory pattern of the anesthetized vagotomized rat behaves primarily as a single degree-of-freedom oscillator, which can be moved into a regime of low-order chaos in the presence of feedback from pulmonary stretch receptors, contributing significantly to the variability observed in the respiratory pattern of the vagi-intact animal. A model designed to emulate the Hering-Breuer inflation reflex demonstrates that the inspiration-inhibiting action of the reflex interacting with the oscillator at a critical phase transition is sufficient to drive the central pattern generator output into low-order chaos.\r"

Chronic activation was delivered to the deafferented common peroneal nerve (no pain, no reflexes), and contractile properties were measured for peroneus longus muscle. After 4 wk of great daily amounts of treatment at moderately high pulse rates (30-40 Hz delivered during 50% of daily time), the peroneus longus became considerably weaker, demonstrated a longer time course of twitches and a slower rate of rise of tetanic force, and became less fatigable. Furthermore, its twitch-to-tetanus ratio decreased, and there was no longer any depression of electromyogram (EMG) amplitude during fatigue tests. After 4 wk of subsequent rest it was found that 1) twitch speed and maximum tetanic force had returned to nearly normal values, 2) fatigue resistance showed some return toward normal but was still significantly enhanced, and 3) no significant recovery had yet occurred of the altered twitch-to-tetanus ratio, the abolished EMG depression, or the slowed rate of rise of tetanic tension. During the poststimulation recovery period, the progressive increase of isometric twitch speed was not promoted by the administration of small daily amounts of high-rate stimulation (100-Hz bursts). The results support the conclusions that 1) the time course of recovery differs among physiological properties, 2) the EMG and force reactions that occur during a fatigue test are not strongly coupled, as demonstrated by the alterations of their relationship during poststimulation recovery, and 3) in cat's fast muscles, there is still no evidence for rate-specific effects of chronic stimulation on isometric twitch speed.\r"

On both ALM and placebo (PL) days, resting subjects breathed a hypoxic gas mixture (an inspired O2 fraction of 10.4-13.2%), which lowered resting arterial O2 saturation (SaO2) to 80%. After 15 min of rest there was a 3-min warm-up period of exercise at 50 W (light) on a cycle ergometer, followed by a step increase in load to 60% of the previously determined maximum power output with room-air breathing (moderate), which was maintained until exhaustion. With PL, SaO2 decreased rapidly with the onset of exercise and continued to fall slowly during moderate exercise, averaging 71.0 +/- 1.8% (SE) at exhaustion. With ALM, saturation did not differ from PL during air breathing but significantly exceeded SaO2 with PL, by 3.4% during resting hypoxia, by 4.0% at the start of exercise, and by 5.9% at exhaustion. Ventilation was not affected by ALM during air breathing and was slightly, although not significantly, increased during hypoxic rest and exercise. ALM was associated with an increased heart rate during room air breathing but not during hypoxia. Endurance time was 20.6 +/- 1.6 min with ALM and 21.3 +/- 0.9 min with PL. During hypoxic exercise, the potential benefit of greater saturation with ALM is apparently offset by other unidentified factors.\r"

PH, GGT, and Hyp were also observed in S and tibialis anterior muscle (TA) at 0, 3, 7, and 14 days of remobilization after 7 days of cast immobilization. The activities of PH and GGT decreased significantly in shortened S after an immobilization of 3 days and were low thereafter. Immobilization for 7 days caused a decrease in the content of the soluble collagen in shortened S. Remobilization resulted in a rapid increase in the activities of collagen marker enzymes and the soluble collagen in S. In stretched TA, the specific activities of PH and GGT were increased significantly after 1 wk of immobilization and returned to the control levels during the remobilization period. The content of soluble collagen was above the control level after immobilization and returned to control level during the remobilization period in stretched TA. There were, at most, slight changes in the total content of insoluble collagen in S and TA. The results suggest rapid changes in the fractional synthesis rate of procollagen but, at most, slow changes in the stable content of muscular collagen during cast immobilization and remobilization.

Genetic factors dominated environmental traits in intra- as well as extrathoracic tracheal width at RV. Extrathoracic tracheal width at TLC was also governed by genetic components. Intrathoracic tracheal depth (anteroposterior diameter), length, and cross-sectional area did not seem to be genetically controlled at TLC and RV. Intrathoracic tracheal cross-sectional area increased by 14.4% and became more elliptical from RV to TLC, owing mainly to an increase in tracheal depth (16.7%). Increments from RV to TLC in tracheal depth but not width correlated with increases in lung width, depth, and height. Intrathoracic trachea was elongated 14% in association with increase in lung height from RV to TLC. At TLC, extrathoracic tracheal width was larger than intrathoracic tracheal width, but this dimension did not differ at RV. These results indicate that genetic factors influence, at least at RV, the tracheal rings more strongly than membranous parts. Intrathoracic tracheal depth but not width increases during inspiration in accordance with increase in lung volume. Extrathoracic tracheal width widens more than intrathoracic trachea from RV to TLC.\r"

Hindlimb skeletal muscles innervated by the sciatic nerve were stimulated to contract with trains of supramaximal impulses (100 ms, 80 Hz) at a train rate of 1 Hz for 60 s, with an occluded circulation. Soleus, plantaris, and red and white gastrocnemius (WG) were sampled from control and stimulated limbs. All muscle masses were reduced with age (9-13%). Peak isometric tensions, normalized per gram of wet muscle, were lower throughout the stimulation in the aged animals (28%). The potential for anaerobic ATP provision was unaltered with age in all muscles, because resting high-energy phosphates and glycogen contents were similar to adult values. Anaerobic ATP provision during stimulation was unaltered by aging in soleus, plantaris, and red gastrocnemius muscles. In the WG, containing mainly fast glycolytic (FG) fibers, ATP and phosphocreatine contents were depleted less in aged muscle. In situ glycogenolysis and glycolysis were 90.0 +/- 4.8 and 69.3 +/- 2.6 mumol/g dry muscle (dm) in adult WG and reduced to 62.3 +/- 6.9 and 51.5 +/- 5.5 mumol/g dm, respectively, in aged WG. Consequently, total anaerobic ATP provision was lower in aged WG (224.5 +/- 20.9 mumol/g dm) vs. adult (292.6 +/- 7.6 mumol/g dm) WG muscle. In summary, the decreased tetanic tension production in aged animals was associated with a decreased anaerobic energy production in FG fibers. Reduced high-energy phosphate use and a greater energy charge potential after stimulation suggested that the energy demand was reduced in aged FG fibers.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Training was conducted five to six times per week for approximately 8 wk. During this time, VO2max increased (P less than 0.05) by 17.2%. Plasma volume (PV) measured by 125I increased (P less than 0.05) from 3,068 +/- 104 ml at 0 wk to 3,490 +/- 126 ml at 4 wk and then plateaued during the remaining four wk (3,362 +/- 113 ml). Red cell (RBC) mass (RCM) measured by 51Cr-labeled RBC did not change during the initial 4 wk of training (2,247 +/- 66 vs. 2,309 +/- 128 ml). As well, no apparent change occurred in RCM during the final 4 wk of training when RCM was estimated using PV and hematocrit (Hct). Collectively, PV plus RCM, expressed as total blood volume (TBV), increased (P less than 0.05) by 10% at 4 wk and then stabilized for the final 4 wk. During the initial phase of training, reductions (P less than 0.05) were also noted in Hct (4.6%), hemoglobin (Hb, 4.0%), and RBC count (6.3%). In contrast, an increase in mean cell volume (MCV, 1.7%) and mean cell Hb (2.3%) was observed (P less than 0.05). From 4 to 8 wk, no further changes (P greater than 0.05) in Hb, RBC, and MCV were found, whereas both mean cell Hb and Hct returned to pretraining levels.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to compare the rate of decline in blood lactate (La) levels in nine trained men [maximal O2 consumption (VO2max) 65.5 +/- 3.3 ml.kg-1.min-1] and eight untrained men (VO2max 42.2 +/- 2.8 ml.kg-1.min-1) during passive recovery from a 3-min exercise bout. Trained and untrained subjects cycled at 85 and 80% VO2max, respectively, to produce similar peak blood La concentrations. Twenty samples of arterialized venous blood were drawn from a heated hand vein during 60 min of recovery and analyzed in an automated La analyzer. The data were then fitted to a biexponential function, which closely described the observed data (r = 0.97-0.98). There was no difference in the coefficient expressing the rate of decline in blood La for trained and untrained groups (0.0587 +/- 0.0111 vs. 0.0579 +/- 0.0100, respectively). However, trained subjects demonstrated a faster time-to-peak La (P = 0.01), indicative of a faster efflux of La from muscle to blood. Thus the rate of decline in blood La after exercise does not appear to be affected by training. The faster decline previously reported for trained subjects may be due to the use of a linear rather than a biexponential curve fit.\r"

  ".W": "The mechanisms responsible for the initial rise in splanchnic vascular resistance with environmental heating are controversial, and those responsible for the subsequent fall in splanchnic resistance in the severely hyperthermic animal are unknown. Thus we examined the effect of environmental heating on plasma catecholamine concentration, splanchnic sympathetic nerve activity (SNA), and select blood chemistries. In one study, 25 male Sprague-Dawley rats (270-300 g) were assigned to one of five groups on the basis of their core temperature (Tc, 37, 39, 41, 43, or 44 degrees C) at death. Heart rate (HR), mean arterial pressure (MAP), and Tc were monitored during heat stress under alpha-chloralose anesthesia (12.5 mg.ml-1.h-1). At each predetermined Tc, an aortic blood sample was drawn and analyzed for mean plasma concentration of norepinephrine (NE), epinephrine (E), Na+, K+, and lactate. From 41 to 43 degrees C, NE and E rose significantly, and the animals became hyperkalemic and lactacidemic. In a separate study, we quantitated SNA from the greater splanchnic nerve during heat exposure of artificially respired animals anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium (50 mg/kg). MAP, splanchnic SNA, and Tc were recorded. Tc was elevated from 37.0 +/- 0.12 to 41.3 +/- 0.18 degrees C in 70 min by increase of ambient temperature to 38 degrees C in an environmental chamber. Splanchnic SNA was 54 +/- 8 spikes/s at a Tc of 37 degrees C and increased significantly as Tc exceeded 39 degrees C (P less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"
