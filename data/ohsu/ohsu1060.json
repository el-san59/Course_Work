  ".W": "Coronary hemodynamics, myocardial metabolism and left ventricular function at rest and after incremental atrial pacing were evaluated in 12 patients with stress-induced angina and ST segment depression, angiographically normal coronary arteries and no evidence of spasm, generally labeled as syndrome X, and in 10 normal subjects. At baseline study, great cardiac vein flow was comparable in patients and control subjects. During pacing, an equivalent rate-pressure product was reached in the two groups, but the slope of the relation between rate-pressure product and great cardiac vein flow was significantly less steep in patients than in normal subjects (0.0027 vs. 0.0054 ml/mm Hg.beat, p less than 0.001). Nevertheless, the left ventricular ejection fraction was comparable in both groups at rest (66 +/- 6% vs. 71 +/- 7%, p = NS) and during pacing (71 +/- 7% vs. 66 +/- 5%, p = NS). At baseline study, myocardial glucose extraction was more efficient in patients with syndrome X (p less than 0.05), but net myocardial exchange of pyruvate and alanine was, respectively, smaller and greater than in control subjects. Lactate was extracted to a similar extent in the two groups and in no instance was net lactate release observed during pacing or recovery. During pacing and recovery, patients with syndrome X showed net pyruvate release, unlike the control subjects in whom net pyruvate exchange was positive. In addition, patients with syndrome X continued to show net myocardial extraction of alanine during spacing and recovery, whereas normal subjects produced alanine throughout the study. Myocardial carbohydrate oxidation increased significantly during maximal pacing in normal subjects but not in patients, in whom it always remained below (p less than 0.01) the concurrent rate of myocardial uptake of carbohydrate equivalents (glucose, lactate, pyruvate, alanine). Myocardial energy expenditure was significantly lower in patients than in control subjects at maximal rate-pressure product levels (p less than 0.01). The metabolic pattern in patients with syndrome X therefore is not consistent with classic ischemia, although differences in the net exchange of circulating substrates (glucose, pyruvate, alanine) can be demonstrated. Thus, in patients with syndrome X, the symptoms, electrocardiographic signs and impairment in the increase in great cardiac vein flow during pacing coexist with preserved global and regional left ventricular function and myocardial energy efficiency.\r"

Data were compared with those in 30 normal control subjects of similar ages. Seventeen (57%) of the 30 patients with sickle cell anemia had evidence of abnormal left ventricular diastolic filling. Six of these 17 patients had a Doppler pattern consistent with \"restrictive\" filling, characterized by reduced early diastolic deceleration time (less than 110 ms) or an increased rate of decline of early flow velocity (EF slope greater than 7.4 m/s2), or both, as well as decreased late diastolic velocity-time integral (2.6 +/- 0.7 vs. 3.4 +/- 0.8 cm in normal subjects; p less than 0.05). Another 11 patients showed a Doppler waveform consistent with impaired relaxation, characterized by prolonged deceleration time (greater than 166 ms) or reduced EF slope (less than 3.8 m/s2), as well as increased late diastolic velocity-time integral (4.0 +/- 0.5 vs. 3.4 +/- 0.8 cm in normal subjects; p = 0.03). This Doppler echocardiographic analysis demonstrates that left ventricular diastolic filling patterns are altered in patients with sickle cell anemia and that these diastolic abnormalities may be present in the absence of symptoms of heart failure. These abnormal patterns suggest an intrinsic myocardial abnormality in patients with sickle anemia and may prove to be early markers of cardiac disease.\r"

There was a striking female predominance (82 women vs. 18 men; p less than 0.0005) despite an essentially equal number of female and male hospital admissions. There was a single statistically significant ECG correlate: a more vertical QRS axis in women (+14.1 degrees +/- 45.3 degrees vs. -5.6 degrees +/- 31.3 degrees; p = 0.034). The T waves were basically symmetric (68%), the influence of this factor usually altering the characteristically asymmetric T wave inversions of right bundle branch block (4 of 5) and left ventricular hypertrophy (21 of 36). Asymmetry was mainly associated with digoxin therapy (21 of 32 patients taking digoxin; p less than or equal to 0.0005) and a corrected QT (QTc) interval (0.433 +/- 0.095) shorter than with symmetric T wave inversions (0.507 +/- 0.074; p less than or equal to 0.0005) though not reaching the degree of shortening expected for digitalization. Twenty-eight patients admitted for acute myocardial infarction and 23 for a central nervous system disorder accounted for the majority of patients with symmetric T wave inversion. Fifteen of 18 patients who had coronary angiography had some degree of coronary artery disease: 3 had angiographically normal coronary arteries.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Systemic venous flow patterns are easily assessed by transthoracic echocardiography for evaluation of right heart dynamics. However, the transthoracic approach cannot be used in patients undergoing thoracic surgery. The present study describes a method for obtaining hepatic venous flow velocity with transesophageal Doppler echocardiography. Twenty-nine patients were studied with transthoracic echocardiography just before cardiac surgery and with transesophageal echocardiography during surgery. Hepatic venous flow velocity recordings were obtained in 14 of 29 patients with the transthoracic and in all 29 with the transesophageal approach. Timing of flow pattern was similar with the two methods, but recordings obtained with transesophageal echocardiography were inverted compared with those obtained with transthoracic echocardiography as a result of the difference in probe location in relation to flow direction. The time-velocity integrals obtained with the two techniques did not differ significantly; for the transthoracic and transesophageal approaches, they were, respectively, 7.3 +/- 3.4 versus 5.7 +/- 4.4 for systolic flow; 1.0 +/- 1.0 versus 0.5 +/- 0.6 for end-systolic flow reversal; 4.7 +/- 2.3 versus 3.7 +/- 1.7 for diastolic flow; 2.0 +/- 1.8 versus 1.5 +/- 1.5 for atrial flow reversal and 1.9 +/- 1.0 versus 1.7 +/- 1.1 for systolic/diastolic ratio. In conclusion, hepatic venous flow values are obtained more frequently and with better quality by transesophageal than by transthoracic echocardiography. The flow patterns and velocity integrals are similar with both methods and previous experience with transthoracic echocardiography should be applicable to the transesophageal technique. Transesophageal Doppler echocardiography therefore has potential for studying right heart dynamics during anesthesia and surgery.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of mitral regurgitation on pulmonary venous flow velocity was studied in 66 patients undergoing transesophageal echocardiography. Nine patients were studied intraoperatively before and after surgery, so that 75 pulmonary venous flow tracings were analyzed. Fifty-four patients had no significant (0 to 1+) mitral regurgitation and 21 had significant (2 to 3+) mitral regurgitation. Comparison of both groups revealed significant differences in the pulmonary venous flow pattern. In patients with no significant mitral regurgitation, the peak systolic velocity was higher (55 +/- 16 vs. -4 +/- 16 cm/s; p less than 0.0001) and the peak diastolic velocity was lower (43 +/- 13 vs. 59 +/- 17 cm/s; p less than 0.01) when compared with values in patients with significant mitral regurgitation. Consequently, the peak systolic/diastolic velocity ratio was significantly higher in the patients without significant mitral regurgitation (1.4 +/- 0.5 vs. 0.4 +/- 1.3; p less than 0.0001). The same trend was noted with respect to the systolic and diastolic velocity integrals. As the degree of mitral regurgitation increased, the peak diastolic velocity and diastolic velocity integral increased, whereas the peak systolic velocity and systolic velocity integral decreased. In patients with severe mitral regurgitation, the systolic flow became reversed (retrograde). The sensitivity of reversed systolic flow for severe mitral regurgitation was 90% (9 of 10), the specificity was 100% (65 of 65), the positive predictive value was 100% (9 of 9), the negative predictive value was 98% (65 of 66) and the predictive accuracy was 99% (74 of 75).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In patients with a prosthetic mitral valve, exercise resulted in an increase in mean transmitral gradient from 5 +/- 2 to 8 +/- 3 mm Hg. Calculated pulmonary artery systolic pressure increased with exercise from 41 +/- 19 to 70 +/- 32 mm Hg in the mitral stenosis group and from 28 +/- 8 to 39 +/- 15 mm Hg in patients with a prosthetic valve.

  ".W": "Left ventricular volume is a strong determinant of survival after acute myocardial infarction. The aim of this study was to determine which clinical and echocardiographic criteria assessed early after myocardial infarction would predict later left ventricular dilation. Forty-eight patients with uncomplicated transmural myocardial infarction had echocardiography 5 to 10 days after myocardial infarction and assessment of clinical variables including peak creatine kinase and sum of electrocardiographic ST segment elevation. Left ventricular dimensions were measured from the echocardiogram in the parasternal view and also in the apical four and two chamber views at the level of the mitral leaflets, papillary muscles and apex. A cardiac wall motion score was obtained by segmental analysis of the apical views. Echocardiographic left ventricular volume was measured after 1 year from the apical views with use of a Simpson's rule method. Initial clinical and echocardiographic variables were correlated with the left ventricular volume at 1 year. There was a significant relation between the initial four and two chamber end-diastolic dimensions and the left ventricular volume at 1 year, particularly for dimensions measured at the apical level (four chamber R2 = 0.66, p = 0.0001, two chamber R2 = 0.61, p = 0.0001). Other clinical variables, parasternal left ventricular dimensions and cardiac wall motion score were not significantly related to left ventricular volume. A powerful three variable model obtained by multiple regression and including the initial two chamber apical dimension, cardiac wall motion score and body surface area accounted for 82% of the variation in left ventricular volume at 1 year.\r"

To study these effects in vivo, 30 consecutive patients undergoing routine angiography were prospectively randomized to three groups of 10 patients each. Group A received diatrizoate (ionic, high osmolality), Group B ioxaglate (ionic, low osmolality) and Group C iohexol (nonionic, low osmolality). In vivo platelet alpha-granule release and fibrin-1 formation were measured by radioimmunoassay of beta-thromboglobulin and fibrinopeptide A in peripheral venous samples. Levels were estimated at three stages during the procedure: before and after left ventriculography and after coronary angiography. No differences were noted (p = NS) when the ratios of beta-thromboglobulin and fibrinopeptide A were compared among the three groups. These data suggest that the newer nonionic contrast media do not demonstrate enhanced systemic platelet activation or fibrin formation as compared with standard ionic contrast media. However, larger randomized clinical studies are necessary to conclusively establish the suggested thromboembolic potential of nonionic contrast media.\r"

Twelve cardiac transplant recipients underwent intracoronary infusion of substance P after routine annual investigations. All patients were well, with no evidence of rejection and with angiographically normal coronary arteries. Substance P was infused at 2 ml/min for 2 min into the coronary artery, starting at a dose of 1.4 pmol/min and increasing by doubling increments, and followed by isosorbide dinitrate (1 mg/min) infused over 2 min. Coronary artery diameter was measured in 23 vessel segments from 12 transplant recipients. The following doses were infused: saline solution (1 ml/min), substance P (0.7 [three patients], 1.4, 2.8, 5.6, 11.2, 22.4 pmol/min) and isosorbide dinitrate (1 mg/min). The mean percent increase in diameter (+/- SEM) in response to increasing doses of substance P was as follows: 0, 6.5 +/- 2.9%, 10.9 +/- 2.9%, 12.1 +/- 2.9%, 16.5 +/- 2.6%, 19.2 +/- 3.1% and 25.8 +/- 2.2%, respectively. Half maximal dilation was produced with 1.4 to 2.8 pmol/min of substance P; the maximal response (mean percent diameter change) was 22 +/- 2.5%. This was not significantly different from that achieved with isosorbide dinitrate. It is concluded that coronary endothelial function as assessed by response to substance P is preserved in cardiac transplant recipients with angiographically normal coronary arteries. Substance P may be a suitable agent for testing endothelial function in these patients.\r"

After tilting to +60 degrees, the atrial flutter cycle length shortened in all patients from 247.5 +/- 7 to 236.7 +/- 6.9 ms (range of shortening 1 to 21 ms, p less than 0.001). The Valsalva maneuver (strain of 40 mm Hg) shortened the flutter cycle length during the strain (phase 2) from 242.2 +/- 4.6 to 230.5 +/- 5 ms (range of shortening 2 to 19 ms, p less than 0.001). In 10 patients whose respiration was monitored, the flutter cycle length consistently prolonged during inspiration and shortened during expiration. Combined beta-adrenergic and muscarinic receptor blockade in six patients did not significantly alter the flutter cycle length at rest or the effects of the various maneuvers on the changes in flutter cycle length. This study revealed that the atrial flutter cycle length can be shortened by passive upright tilting, the strain phase of the Valsalva maneuver and expiration. Changes in flutter cycle length were independent of autonomic tone, implying that by decreasing cardiac volume, these maneuvers affect characteristics of the atrial flutter circuit, thereby producing dynamic changes in the rate of atrial flutter.\r"

Autopsy records (n = 5,871) from the medical examiner's files at Baltimore, Maryland and northern Virginia were examined and 495 persons (8.4%) were identified with positive toxicologic findings for cocaine. Of these, six subjects (1.2%) had total thrombotic occlusion, involving primarily the left anterior descending coronary artery. The mean number of adventitial mast cells per coronary segment and the degree of atherosclerosis were determined. These observations were compared with findings in age- and gender-matched subjects who died from cocaine overdose and in patients who had sudden cardiac death (acute thrombosis) without a history of illicit drug abuse. There were significantly more mast cells in subjects with cocaine-associated thrombosis than in the other groups. The number of mast cells showed a significant correlation with the degree of cross-sectional luminal narrowing (r = 0.68) in subjects with cocaine-associated thrombosis but not in subjects with sudden death due to thrombosis (r = 0.34, p less than 0.03). Subjects with cocaine-associated thrombosis also had significant coronary atherosclerosis without plaque hemorrhage (five had one or more vessels with greater than 75% cross-sectional area luminal narrowing) despite a mean age of 29 +/- 2 years. These findings suggest that adventitial mast cells may potentiate atherosclerosis and vasospasm, thrombosis and premature sudden death in long-term cocaine abusers.\r"

  ".W": "Concomitant susceptibility to atrioventricular (AV) node reentrant tachycardia has been demonstrated in certain patients having reentrant tachycardia utilizing accessory AV connections. For those patients undergoing accessory connection ablation, AV node surgical modification may be warranted during the same operative procedure. To assess indications for a combined operative procedure, this study evaluated potential predictors of subsequent spontaneous AV node reentrant tachycardia in patients undergoing ablation of accessory AV connections. Among 62 consecutive patients undergoing surgical ablation of an accessory AV connection, 13 (21%) manifested dual AV node pathways. The latter were identified preoperatively in five patients (four with concealed and one with bidirectional accessory connections) and postoperatively in seven (all seven with bidirectional accessory connections). In one patient with a bidirectional accessory connection, dual AV node pathways could not be demonstrated preoperatively, but AV node reentrant tachycardia was induced. Operative ablation of an accessory connection was successful in all patients. However, postoperatively, 2 of the 13 patients had inducible AV node reentrant tachycardia, 5 had AV node \"echo\" beats and 6 had no inducible arrhythmia. During 26 +/- 7 months of follow-up study, the two patients with inducible AV node reentrant tachycardia postoperatively had symptomatic AV node reentrant tachycardia. In addition, the one patient with inducible AV node reentrant tachycardia preoperatively had recurrence of this tachycardia 4 months after attempted surgical modification of the AV node. Consequently, although dual AV node pathways appear to be common in patients undergoing surgical ablation of an accessory AV connection (21%), only a small group (3 of 13) of these patients are at risk for subsequent clinical AV node reentrant tachycardia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Between July 1986 and May 1990, 4 of 70 patients (3 men and 1 woman; mean age 33 +/- 13 years) undergoing surgery for accessory pathway division were found to have an intermediate septal accessory pathway. The presenting arrhythmia was atrial fibrillation with rapid anterograde conduction over the accessory pathway in two patients and recurrent orthodromic reciprocating tachycardia in two patients. In all patients, the delta wave on the electrocardiogram (ECG) was inverted in lead V1, but two patterns of delta wave configuration were observed. In three patients (type 1 intermediate septal accessory pathway), the delta wave was upright in lead II, inverted in lead III and isoelectric in lead a VF; the transition from a negative to an upright delta wave occurred in lead V2. The fourth patient exhibited a different delta wave pattern (type 2 intermediate septal accessory pathway). The delta wave was upright in each of leads II, III and aVF; the transition from a negative to an upright delta wave occurred at lead V3. Intraoperative electrophysiologic study localized the atrial insertion of type 1 pathways to the midpoint of Koch's triangle close to the AV node.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Each had presented clinically with documented sustained ventricular tachycardia or out of hospital cardiac arrest not associated with acute myocardial infarction. In 23 patients (61%) (Group I) the arrhythmia became noninducible during an intravenous infusion of procainamide. Oral procainamide was subsequently administered and retesting was carried out after dose titration to match plasma concentration at the end of the intravenous study. Among the 23 patients in Group I the mean (+/- SD) plasma procainamide level was 7.2 +/- 2.8 micrograms/ml after intravenous dosing and 7.9 +/- 2.5 micrograms/ml after oral dosing (p = 0.09). In 15 (65%) of the 23 patients, sustained ventricular arrhythmia was inducible on oral therapy with comparable plasma procainamide levels (intravenous = 6.3 +/- 2.1 micrograms/ml, oral = 7.5 +/- 2.1 micrograms/ml). The other eight patients (35%) had concordant responses to repeat testing with comparable intravenous (mean 9.0 +/- 3.3 micrograms/ml) and oral (8.8 +/- 3.1 micrograms/ml) plasma procainamide levels. In the additional 15 patients (Group II) sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmia remained inducible on intravenous procainamide therapy and the patients were retested on oral therapy with similar plasma concentration (p = 0.05). In seven patients (47%) sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmia was noninducible on treatment with oral procainamide (mean plasma level 7.6 +/- 2.7 micrograms/ml) after failure of intravenous procainamide (mean plasma level 10.3 +/- 2.3 micrograms/ml).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

During a follow-up period of 29 +/- 25 months, six patients had a sudden death and eight patients had a nonsudden cardiac death. Nonsudden cardiac deaths included three surgical deaths (death within 30 days after the surgery; two in patients without and one in a patient with concomitant cardiac surgery), one arrhythmia-related nonsudden death (death within 24 h after an arrhythmic event despite initial termination of the arrhythmia by the implantable defibrillators) and four nonarrhythmic cardiac deaths. The actuarial survival rate free of events at 1, 2 and 3 years was 96%, 96% and 92%, respectively, for sudden death, 91%, 91% and 87% for sudden death and surgical mortality and 89%, 89% and 85% for total arrhythmic death (sudden death, surgical mortality and arrhythmia-related nonsudden death). Thus, in patients treated with an implantable defibrillator, 1) the rate of sudden death is low (8% at 3 years); 2) 50% of nonsudden cardiac deaths are causally related to arrhythmia (surgical mortality or arrhythmia-related nonsudden death); 3) the total arrhythmic death rate is substantially higher than the sudden death rate; and 4) benefits of an implantable defibrillator are overestimated by reported sudden death and nonsudden cardiac death rates. The benefits may be better represented by the total arrhythmic death and nonarrhythmic cardiac death rates.\r"

  ".W": "The clinical, surgical and morphologic findings in five cases of a rare form of straddling mitral valve are presented. Three patients were diagnosed by two-dimensional echocardiography, cardiac catheterization and angiocardiography and two had diagnostic confirmation at autopsy. All five cases shared a distinctive and consistent combination of anomalies: 1) dextrocardia; 2) visceroatrial situs solitus, concordant ventricular D-loop and double outlet right ventricle with the aorta positioned to the left of and anterior to the pulmonary artery; 3) hypoplasia of right ventricular inflow (sinus) with tricuspid valve stenosis or hypoplasia; 4) large right ventricular infundibulum (outflow); 5) malalignment conoventricular septal defect; 6) straddling mitral valve with chordal attachments to the left ventricle and right ventricular infundibulum; 7) severe subpulmonary stenosis with well developed pulmonary arteries; and 8) superoinferior ventricles with crisscross atrioventricular (AV) relations. The degree of malalignment between the atrial and ventricular septa was studied quantitatively by measuring the AV septal angle projected on the frontal plane. The AV septal angle in the two postmortem cases was 150 degrees, reflecting marked malalignment of the ventricles relative to the atria. This AV malalignment appears to play an important role in the morphogenesis of straddling mitral valve. As judged by a companion study of seven postmortem cases, the more common form of straddling mitral valve with a hypertrophied and enlarged right ventricular sinus had less severe ventricular malposition than did the five rare study cases with hypoplastic right ventricular sinus. A competent mitral valve, low pulmonary vascular resistance and low left ventricular end-diastolic pressure were found at cardiac catheterization in the three living patients who underwent a modified Fontan procedure and are doing well 2.2 to 5.8 years postoperatively.\r"

  ".W": "Nineteen procedures were performed in 17 children, aged 10 months to 17 years, using catheter radiofrequency applications for the management of malignant or drug-resistant supraventricular tachyarrhythmias. Diagnoses were junctional ectopic tachycardia in 1 patient, atrioventricular (AV) node reentrant tachycardia in 4 and accessory pathway-mediated tachycardia in 12. Accessory pathway locations were left lateral (n = 4), posteroseptal (n = 3), left posterior (n = 2), right posterolateral (n = 1), right posterior paraseptal (n = 1), right intermediate septal (n = 1) and right anterior (n = 1). Ablation of accessory pathways was performed using 20 to 40 W of energy. The catheter was passed retrograde to the left ventricle in patients with a left-sided pathway and anterograde to the right atrium in those with a right-sided or posteroseptal pathway. In the 12 patients with an accessory pathway, radiofrequency applications were successful in 11 pathways and failed in 2. There were no recurrences of accessory pathway-mediated tachycardia. Atrioventricular node reentrant tachycardia was treated by AV node modification using 15 W of energy applied until first degree AV block occurred. After radiofrequency catheter ablation, there was a prolonged AH interval, tachycardia was not inducible and tachycardia recurred in one patient. For the patient with junctional ectopic tachycardia, 15 to 18 W of energy was delivered at the site of the maximal His bundle electrogram until sinus rhythm and normal AV conduction appeared. After a recurrence, a second procedure abolished tachycardia and AV conduction. In summary, radiofrequency catheter ablation was initially successful in 17 of 19 procedures and ultimately curative in 14 (82%) of 17 patients with no serious complications. Radiofrequency catheter ablation appears to be a safe and effective method for the management of supraventricular tachyarrhythmias in children.\r"

Few data are available concerning pulmonary embolization in the pediatric patient with end-stage congestive heart failure. Sixty-two consecutive pediatric patients awaiting heart transplantation were monitored for evidence of acute pulmonary embolism. Acute pulmonary infarction was documented by ventilation-perfusion scan, pulmonary angiography or pathologic examination in six patients. The prevalence differed by diagnosis; 5 of 36 patients with dilated cardiomyopathy and 1 of 20 patients with congenital heart disease developed acute pulmonary embolism with infarction. No significant difference in age at the time of transplantation evaluation, duration of congestive heart failure, presence of cardiac arrhythmias or degree of cardiac dysfunction was seen between patients with and without pulmonary embolism. Two-dimensional echocardiography failed to detect the presence of an intracardiac thrombus in four of the six patients. Two patients who developed acute pulmonary infarction are alive after successful heart transplantation. The remaining four patients died within 6 weeks of initiation of anticoagulant therapy before transplantation could safely be performed. In summary, pediatric patients with end-stage congestive heart failure are at risk for acute pulmonary embolism. No specific clinical factor identified those patients who developed acute pulmonary infarction. Anticoagulant therapy is strongly recommended in the pediatric patient with poor ventricular function awaiting heart transplantation.\r"

  ".W": "The mechanism of action of moricizine, a new antiarrhythmic agent used in the Cardiac Arrhythmia Suppression Trial, is incompletely characterized. In addition, because moricizine is extensively metabolized, plasma moricizine concentration has an unknown relation to myocardial drug effect. Signal-averaged and standard electrocardiograms (ECGs) were used to monitor moricizine's myocardial effects in 16 patients with frequent ventricular premature complexes taking 600 to 900 mg daily. Three signal-averaged ECG variables were measured: total filtered QRS duration (fQRS), root-mean-square voltage in the terminal 40 ms of the QRS complex (V40) and the terminal low amplitude duration less than 40 microV (LAS). At steady state, plasma samples were collected and serial recordings of signal-averaged and standard ECGs were taken at 0, 1, 2, 4, 6 and 8 h after moricizine administration. A 24 h ambulatory ECG was recorded throughout the test period. Moricizine prolonged the fQRS (p less than 0.05) and decreased the V40 (p less than 0.05) of the signal-averaged ECG and prolonged the QRS (p less than 0.05) and corrected JT (JTc) intervals (p less than 0.05) of the standard ECG. The time course of the signal-averaged and standard ECG variables paralleled plasma moricizine concentration; that is, the maximal changes occurred at 1 to 2 h and declined to time 0 values at 8 h. The maximal changes were: fQRS (+8%), V40 (-33%), QRS (+8%) and JTc (+4%). Thus, dynamic changes were observed for intraventricular conduction (fQRS, QRS) and ventricular repolarization (JTc) over the dosing interval.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Six of the patients had previously failed to have permanent complete AV block created with direct current or radiofrequency catheter ablation. The AV node artery was cannulated with a 0.016 in. (0.041 cm) guide wire in all 12 patients. It was also possible to advance a 2.7F infusion catheter into the AV node artery in all patients. Transient AV block was induced by selective injections into the AV node artery of iced saline solution (8 patients) and of radiographic contrast agent (ioxaglate) (10 patients). The infusion of 2 ml of ethanol (96%) induced immediate complete AV block in all 10 patients who demonstrated AV block with ioxaglate. The escape rhythm exhibited a narrow QRS complex preceded by a His bundle deflection in nine patients and left bundle branch block in one patient. The immediate mean rate of the escape rhythm was 45.3 +/- 13.4 beats/min. In two patients who demonstrated reflux of contrast agent into the distal right coronary artery with selective injections into the AV node artery, transient ST segment elevation developed in the inferior electrocardiographic leads with the infusion of ethanol. There was no change in the left ventricular ejection fraction from the baseline value (0.53 +/- 0.12) to that measured after ablation (0.55 +/- 0.11) and no patient developed wall motion abnormalities.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to characterize the effects of late reperfusion on myocardial infarct shape and to quantitate associated changes in left ventricular volume. Reperfusion was delayed until there was no salvage of ischemic myocardium. Dogs underwent 6.5 h of left anterior descending coronary artery occlusion (n = 5) or 5.5 h of occlusion and 1 h of reperfusion (n = 5). Infarct shape was measured with pairs of ultrasonic crystals implanted circumferentially in the mid myocardium. Infarct stiffness was determined from end-diastolic pressure-segment length curves produced by aortic clamping. Left ventricular volume was measured with three pairs of endocardial ultrasonic crystals and the effect of infarct shape change on left ventricular volume was determined. Infarct size, expressed as a percent of the area at risk, was similar in reperfused (97 +/- 1%) and nonreperfused (98 +/- 1%) hearts. After coronary artery occlusion, infarct segments became akinetic and functional dilation, measured as end-diastolic ultrasonic crystal separation, increased to a similar extent in reperfused (24 +/- 7%) and nonreperfused (19 +/- 3%) hearts. In 13 additional dogs that underwent reperfusion and instrumentation with endocardial ultrasonic crystals for volume measurement, left ventricular volume increased 42 +/- 6% over the preocclusion level (p less than 0.001). Within minutes of reperfusion, the infarct stiffened, infarct dilation decreased to 1 +/- 4% over the baseline preocclusion level (p less than 0.05 vs. prereperfusion) and left ventricular volume decreased to 16 +/- 11% over the baseline level (p less than 0.01 vs. postocclusion). Thus, coronary artery reperfusion reverses initial infarct dilation. Changes in infarct dilation occur immediately after reperfusion and are accompanied by infarct stiffening and a decrease in left ventricular volume. Reperfusion can affect infarct shape and stiffness at a point in time when myocardial salvage is no longer possible.\r"

  ".U": "91236983\r", 
  ".W": "Assessment of left ventricular function is influenced by a number of hemodynamic factors. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the end-systolic regional wall stress-dimension relation in a series of 25 mongrel dogs. In Group A (n = 18) the regional wall stress-velocity of circumferential fiber shortening relation was measured before and after three interventions: volume infusion, metoprolol infusion and dobutamine infusion. The electrocardiogram, left ventricular pressure and its first derivative (dP/dt), arterial pressure and echocardiograms were recorded at baseline and after phenylephrine administration (to increase afterload). For each dog values for regional wall stress were plotted against the velocity of circumferential fiber shortening. For all dogs the relations were inversely linear (r = -0.65 to -0.98). Volume infusion increased end-diastolic volume (p less than 0.05) without shifting the slope or intercept of the relation, indicating its independence from preload. Dobutamine caused a shift in the intercept to the right but no change in slope and metoprolol shifted the relation to the left without altering the slope. The effect of ischemia and reperfusion on the end-systolic regional wall stress-length relation was examined in Group B (n = 7), at baseline, after 5 min of mid-left anterior descending coronary artery occlusion and after 10 min of reperfusion. Afterload was increased by hydraulic aortic occlusion. Regional wall stress was lowest at baseline, highest during ischemia and intermediate after reperfusion (100.2 +/- 32.1, 193.5 +/- 81.5, 141.9 +/- 67.6 kdyn/cm2, respectively, p less than 0.001). The end-systolic regional wall stress-length relation was linear during baseline, ischemia and reperfusion (r = 0.96, 0.95, 0.98, respectively, p less than 0.05). Ischemia caused an increase in the slope and a shift in the intercept to the right compared with baseline. Reperfusion represented an incomplete return toward baseline. This study demonstrates that the regional wall stress-velocity of circumferential fiber shortening relation is linear, independent of preload, incorporates afterload and is sensitive to changes in contractility. In addition, the regional wall stress-length relation can be measured in a nonhomogeneously contracting left ventricle and is predictably altered by ischemia and reperfusion. This relation may prove useful to determine whether alterations in regional systolic function result from changes in local load or contractility in the left ventricle with a regional wall motion abnormality.\r"

  ".U": "91236984\r", 
  ".W": "The term \"hibernating\" myocardium has been applied to chronic left ventricular dysfunction without angina or ischemic electrocardiographic changes in patients with coronary artery disease that is reversed by therapy that increases myocardial blood flow. To investigate the relation between coronary blood flow and ventricular function experimentally, graded reductions in coronary artery pressure were produced in isolated perfused rat hearts as contractile performance (peak systolic pressure and its first derivative [dP/dt]) and metabolic variables were measured using phosphorus-31 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. As coronary pressure and flow were reduced, significant reductions in myocardial oxygen consumption and contractile performance were observed, which returned to control levels when coronary artery pressure and flow were restored to baseline values. Two phases of metabolic abnormality were observed. With modest reductions in coronary perfusion, proportionate reductions in myocardial oxygen consumption and contractile behavior were accompanied by a slight reduction in creatine phosphate but no significant lactate production. With greater reductions in coronary artery pressure and flow, creatine phosphate decreased more, adenosine triphosphate levels and myocardial pH decreased significantly and myocardial lactate production increased. The balanced reductions in myocardial contractility and oxygen consumption without metabolic abnormalities traditionally associated with \"ischemia\" observed in the first phase provides evidence in normal hearts for resetting of the myocardial contractile behavior and oxygen consumption in the presence of reduced coronary flow (that is, hibernating myocardium). The data suggest that reductions in adenosine diphosphate and the index of the reduced form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) (lactate formation) do not explain the coupling between coronary artery pressure and flow and myocardial oxygen consumption as contractile performance decreases.\r"

  ".W": "Since the introduction of endoscopic sphincterotomy approximately 15 years ago, the indications for this procedure have expanded. Currently endoscopic sphincterotomy is the procedure of choice for management of retained common bile duct stones following cholecystectomy. It is also being used more frequently for choledocholithiasis with an intact gallbladder in high-risk patients and in some patients with acute gallstone pancreatitis. In patients recovering from an episode of gallstone pancreatitis, standard practice has been subsequent cholecystectomy with possible exploration of the common bile duct. To avoid surgery in high-risk patients, we propose that an elective endoscopic sphincterotomy may be a reasonable therapeutic option regardless of whether common bile duct stones are present at the time of ERCP. A prospective trial is needed to examine this issue since to date there is no literature on endoscopic sphincterotomy in the absence of choledocholithiasis for gallstone pancreatitis in patients with intact gallbladders.\r"

Nine men and one woman (age range, 48-74 years; mean, 60 years) were included in the study. Eight patients had undergone esophagography for gastrointestinal complaints and had lesions missed on the initial interpretation that were apparent on retrospective review after the patient had returned with more severe complaints and undergone repeat studies; two patients had refused treatment. The tumor was squamous-cell carcinoma in all. The treatment-free retrospective observation period ranged from 4 to 19 months (mean, 12.2 months) and was shorter for elevated (mean, 9.2 months) than for depressed lesions (mean, 16.8 months). The longitudinal diameter increased from 10-100 mm initially (mean, 30.5 mm) to 32-150 mm (mean, 74.9 mm). No correlation existed between the increase in size and histologic features. This documentation of the rapid increase in the size of esophageal carcinoma involving at least the submucosa confirms clinical impressions of the aggressive nature of this lesion and offers an explanation of why this disease is seldom detected at an early stage and long-term survival is so poor after the early stage of disease.\r"

We now report a study to determine if the survival advantage persisted after treating an additional 26 patients. Thirty-six patients with squamous-cell carcinoma of the esophagus treated with endoscopic laser therapy were compared to 20 controls identified by our hospital Tumor Registry. There was no difference between the groups with respect to age, sex, race, location of tumor, or clinical stage. More control patients (25%) had previously undergone surgery than laser patients (0%) (p less than 0.05). Survival analysis demonstrated a significant improvement in overall survival (p less than 0.05), with an improvement in median survival from 5.7 to 9.7 months (p less than 0.05). One-year survival was 38% in laser patients, compared to 20% in control patients. Our experience continues to demonstrate that endoscopic laser therapy is effective in prolonging life as well as palliating the symptoms of patients with squamous-cell esophageal carcinoma.\r"

(control group) or a continuous nasogastric antacid infusion at the rate of 0.5 ml/min along with an i.v. injection of cimetidine 100 mg/h (treatment group). Twelve patients were included in the control group and 13 in the treatment group. The mean gastric pH on therapy was significantly higher in the treatment group (7.88 +/- 0.37) than in the control group (5.00 +/- 0.55) (p less than 0.001), and the gastric pH was noted to be greater than 7 on 95% of the occasions in the treatment group and on 8.6% of the occasions in the control group. An overall control of bleeding was achieved in 92.3% of the patients in the treatment group and 50% of the patients in the control group (p less than .05). Thus, the failure of therapy was significantly more common in the control group than in the treatment group (p less than 0.05), and more patients of the control group had to undergo emergency surgery than that in the treatment group. None of the patients in the treatment group, but 16.6% of the patients in the control group, died during the study period in the hospital stay. We conclude that in patients with bleeding peptic ulcer an intensive medical therapy comprising hourly injections of cimetidine (or presumably of other H2 blockers) and continuous nasogastric antacid infusion can achieve sustained achlorhydria, better control of bleeding, and reduce the need for emergency surgery.\r"

The prevalence of gastric ulcer was lower but not significantly so. We deduced that the significantly lower prevalence of total peptic ulcer was directly related to the low prevalence rate of duodenal ulcer. We hypothesize that the reason for these differences was probably a higher prevalence of Helicobacter pylori-associated chronic atrophic gastritis with hypochlorhydria in the Peruvian patients. Hypochlorhydria decreases the predisposition to peptic ulcer (especially duodenal ulcer), and chronic atrophic gastritis may predispose an individual to gastric cancer.\r"

The final diagnosis of CP was established by echocardiography, chest computed tomography (CT), or cardiac catheterization.

Bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase are mildly elevated, transaminases often markedly so. The nature of the idiosyncratic injury appears variable, some cases having features of a hypersensitivity reaction, most being more suggestive of a toxic metabolic effect. Light microscopy shows a nonspecific hepatitis with portal and lobular activity, and focal hepatocellular injury that may progress to zonal or massive necrosis. The ultrastructural features in our case are typical of drug or toxin injury. This may be of value in distinguishing this entity from other forms of hepatitis, which is important in view of the frequent reversibility of this potentially lethal form of injury.\r"

However, a pathogenetic link between Klinefelter's syndrome and liver adenoma can be suggested in view of the following facts: Liver adenoma mostly affects women of child-bearing age using oral contraceptives. It is very rare in men, and affected men frequently have been treated with androgens. Both groups are characterized by a sex hormone imbalance. Also, the risk of breast cancer, another hormone-sensitive tumor, is greatly elevated in men with Klinefelter's syndrome, possibly due to sex hormone imbalance.\r"

Histologically, most of the main tumor, and all of the daughter nodules examined, showed sarcomatous changes (spindle- or fusiform-shaped and pleomorphic cells). Histologic examination of a whole slice of the main tumor disclosed a focus of adenosquamous carcinoma (cholangiocarcinoma) within the tumor. Frequent transitions between adenosquamous carcinoma areas and sarcomatous areas suggested that sarcomatous transformation occurred in cholangiocarcinoma and then grew to spread rapidly. Immunohistochemically, squamous carcinoma and, to a lesser degree, adenocarcinoma elements were strongly positive for keratin and epithelial membrane antigen, both being also weakly positive in sarcomatous cells, supporting that possibility. Vimentin was positive only in sarcomatous elements. Cholangiocarcinoma should be included in the list of hepatic tumors showing sarcomatous change.\r"

We have studied the surgical specimens in 94 cases of CD to characterize the anatomical features of stenosis. We found no differences between group A (patients with perforation) and group B (noncomplicated patients) as far as extent of lesion, number of stenoses, and the caliber of the stenotic bowel. In CD of the ileum, the wall thickness of the stenoses was significantly different: 12.0 +/- 3.4 mm in group A and 7.6 +/- 3.1 mm in group B (p less than 0.001). In colonic CD, the length of stenosis was significantly greater in patients with perforation. Duration of symptoms, age at surgery, and sex did not correlate with the increased thickness or with perforating complications. These observations suggest that the fibrotic gastrointestinal tract, poorly distensible, may increase the intraluminal pressure above the stenosis and in this way squeeze bowel content through mucosal fissures of the inflamed bowel. Evaluation and monitoring of wall thickness may help in prompting surgery before the disease is complicated by perforation.\r"

Ninety-seven ulcerative colitis patients were studied, in whom the extent of the macroscopic lesion was established either by colonoscopy (n = 75) or by resection (n = 22). Of these, 42 had proctosigmoiditis, 12 left-sided colitis, 12 subtotal colitis, and 31 total colitis. Nine well-tested features were used for the radiological classification of lesion extent. The radiologists were not given any clinical information. Seventy-eight patients (80.4%) were correctly classified by plain abdominal film (r = 0.86); the best concordance was achieved for proctosigmoiditis and total colitis (80.9 and 90.3%, respectively). In total colitis the most reliable radiological features were \"irregularity of the mucosal edge\" and \"increased thickness of the colon wall, \" which were present in 74.2 and 67.7%, respectively, of the correctly classified patients. The fourfold combination of these two features with \"loss of haustral clefts\" and \"empty right colon\" was present only in patients with total colitis, and at least one of these features was present in all but one of them. Conversely, all nine abnormalities were absent in 73.8% of patients with proctosigmoiditis. In conclusion, plain abdominal film is a reliable tool for judging the extent of lesion in active ulcerative colitis. It seems particularly accurate in total colitis, where, in the acute phases, it is most important to avoid invasive examinations.\r"

Simultaneous incorporation into liposomes of both a peptide recognized by Th lymphocytes and a lipophilic hapten and the IgG antibody responses to this hapten were assessed in outbred mice. DNP-aminocaproyl phosphatidylethanolamine (DNP-CapPE) is a well characterized T-independent hapten Ag. HA2 peptide derived from the hemagglutinin protein of influenza virus contains amino acid sequences recognized by Th and T cytotoxic lymphocytes. In addition, HA2 contains a sequence of hydrophobic amino acids near the carboxyl terminus, allowing its incorporation into liposomes. Results of immunization show that (i), when DNP-CapPE is carried by liposomes without the HA2 peptide, an IgM antibody response is induced, (ii) liposomes carrying both HA2 and DNP-CapPE elicit an IgG antibody response to DNP in a dose-dependent fashion for both HA2 and DNP, (iii) the liposomes must be processed intracellularly in order to elicit a response, (iv) the system leads to a memory response for DNP, and (v) all of the IgG subclasses are elicited. These data suggest that liposomes containing the HA2 peptide exhibit a T-dependent carrier effect for a T-independent Ag. The significance of these findings is discussed in conjunction with the characteristics of the liposome model used.\r"

A structurally diverse family of PI-PLC isoforms has recently been defined, and more than one isoform is frequently coexpressed in a single cell or tissue, suggesting that different forms may play distinct roles in cellular activation, proliferation, or differentiation. We show here that both PLC-alpha and PLC-gamma are expressed in rat splenic T cells and in Jurkat cells (a human T cell line). Activation of Jurkat cells with the combination of PMA and PHA leads to increased expression of PLC-alpha message and decreased expression of PLC-gamma message after 4 h of stimulation. The increase in PLC-alpha transcripts was detectable at 4 h, maximal at 6 h, and remained elevated for at least 24 h. The decrease in PLC-gamma message was transient, with a maximal effect at 4 h, and a return to basal levels by 6 h. Changes in PI-PLC transcripts were also induced by the combination of PMA and the calcium ionophore, ionomycin. These data demonstrate that the expression of transcripts for PLC-alpha and PLC-gamma can be differentially regulated during a cellular response, and raise the possibility that these two isoforms of PI-PLC subserve distinct functions in T cell activation.\r"

The latter signal transduction pathway is an important mediator of antigen receptor engagement. The initial event in this pathway is the activation of phospholipase C (PLC). The identity of the isozyme of PLC used in B cells and the mechanism by which it becomes activated are currently unknown. The cDNA encoding five different isozymes have been cloned. As a first step in identifying the isozyme of PLC that is coupled to mIgM, murine cDNA fragments for the five cloned PLC isozymes were generated by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), cloned, and used to screen a panel of B cell lines representing different stages of development for PLC mRNA expression. All the B cell lines tested expressed high levels of PLC alpha and PLC gamma 2 mRNA, whereas PLC beta and PLC delta mRNA expression were undetectable by both Northern blot and PCR analysis. PLC gamma 1 had a more complicated pattern of mRNA expression. PLC gamma 1 mRNA expression was lower than that observed for PLC alpha or PLC gamma 2 mRNA and varied widely among different cell lines. The pattern of PLC gamma 1 mRNA expression did not correlate with the developmental stage of the cell lines. The pattern of PLC gamma 1 protein expression in the panel of B cell lines correlated with the pattern of PLC gamma 1 mRNA expression. PLC gamma 1 expression was very low in several B cell lines, despite the fact that these cell lines show mIgM-stimulatable PLC activity. The variable and in some cases very low expression of PLC gamma 1 suggests that it may not be the form of PLC that is activated by mIgM. In contrast, PLC alpha and PLC gamma 2 were abundantly expressed in all B cell lines tested. This observation is consistent with the possibility that PLC alpha or PLC gamma 2 is activated by mIgM.\r"

In addition, 7D3 antibody inhibited TPA-induced thymocyte aggregation. 7D3 negative rat thymic lymphoma cells bound to 7D3 positive thymic epithelial cells and this binding was inhibited by 7D3 antibody, indicating that a part of thymocyte-thymic epithelial cell binding was mediated by the interaction of 7D3 Ag and undefined ligand to 7D3.\r"

In spleen cell adherent-lymphokine-activated killer cultures, 4H12 Ag was detected on a small subset of cells after 7 days culture and expression increased with time to 70% of the cells after 21 days culture. 4H12+ cells were large (up to 70 microns) and granular. The Ag was also detected in the cytoplasmic granules of some, but not all 4H12 surface positive cells. Coexpression studies indicated 4H12+ cells were predominantly positive for the NK1.1 and ASGM1 Ag, negative for the MAC-1 and F4/80 Ag, and +/- for the LGL-1 and CD3 Ag. Subsets of 4H12+/-, LGL-1+/- exhibited morphologic characteristics restricted to specific phenotypic subsets. The 4H12-/LGL-1+ subset was shown to contain the smallest, least granular cells, whereas the 4H12+/LGL-1+/- subsets contained the largest and most granular cells. Although 4H12 expression was negligible in the spleens of normal adult mice, spleen cells of neonatal and pregnant mice contained subsets of NK1.1+ cells that coexpressed 4H12. The 4H12+/NK1.1+ and 4H12-/NK1.1+ subsets displayed differential levels of NK1.1 expression. 4H12+ NK cells were NK1.1 low to high, whereas 4H12- NK cells were NK1.1 high only.

To clarify the mechanism by which cytochalasins enhance T cell proliferation, we examined which activation pathways and events in signal transduction were affected by cytochalasins. We also examined subsets of CD4 cells for a preferential response to cytochalasins. Cytochalasins enhanced the proliferation of CD4 cells induced by optimal doses of anti-CD3 antibody or suboptimal doses of anti-CD2 antibodies. Cytochalasins, at low concentrations, enhanced the rise in intracellular Ca2+ and production of IP3 in CD4 cells activated by anti-CD2 or CD3 antibodies. Cytochalasins also enhanced the modulation of CD3 induced by anti-CD3 antibody. These results suggest that cytochalasins enhance the proliferation of CD4 cells by affecting early events in signal transduction after activation through the CD3-Ti Ag-receptor complex or CD2 molecule. At the doses used, cytochalasins appear to interact with cytochalasin-binding sites in the cell membrane. Cytochalasins predominantly enhanced CD3-mediated proliferation in the CD29-subset of CD4 cells.\r"

Whether CD2-mediated activation is dependent on TCR/CD3 expression or signaling is controversial. We have re-explored this issue by using a series of CD2-transfected, TCR/CD3 surface membrane-negative human and mouse T cells. Our results clearly show that such T cells can be triggered for IL-2 secretion and increases in intracellular Ca2+ through the CD2 molecule in the absence of surface expression of TCR/CD3 complexes. These responses are only observed when cells express high levels of CD2 and there is a critical threshold of CD2 expression necessary for such activation in the absence of CD3. Concomitant expression of TCR/CD3 complex markedly lowers the level of CD2 required for activation via the latter pathway. These results provide a clear resolution of the controversy concerning the requirement for surface CD3 expression in T cell activation through CD2 and further suggest a possible role for CD2 in activation of TCR/CD3-negative cells.\r"

Sensitive and specific two-color flow cytometric assays were used to evaluate human lymphocytes from peripheral blood of SCID-hu mice. Kinetic studies presented in this report show long term T lymphopoiesis in SCID-hu mice. Approximately one-half of SCID-hu mice constructed with Thy and Liv tissue develop detectable levels of circulating human T cells by 4 mo after transplantation. The average level of circulating human cells in SCID-hu mice is generally less than 2% of the total lymphoid cells in the peripheral blood of these mice. Some SCID-hu mice with as high as 13% human lymphocytes, however, have been detected. Nearly all human cells in the peripheral blood of SCID-hu mice are CD3+ cells that express TCR-alpha beta. The percentages of gamma delta+, CD4+, CD8+, CD25+, CD69+, and Leu-8+ cells among CD45+ cells in SCID-hu blood are similar to the levels found in adult peripheral blood. On average, 74% of SCID-hu T cells express CD45RA and 18% express CD29. Functional studies demonstrate that cells from SCID-hu Thy/Liv grafts or human T cells from SCID-hu peripheral blood are functionally competent to respond to mitogens or allogeneic human cells in vitro. They are similar to fetal thymocytes or adult T cells, respectively, in these responses. These studies demonstrate that the SCID-hu mouse is a useful model for the analysis of human immune differentiation and function in vivo.\r"

  ".U": "91237079\r", 
  ".W": "Interphotoreceptor retinoid binding protein (IRBP) is a glycoprotein that localizes in the retina and induces inflammatory changes in this tissue in immunized animals. Certain IRBP-derived peptide determinants are also immunopathogenic, and we have previously shown that these determinants could be either immunodominant or cryptic. Lymphocytes sensitized against the cryptic peptides do not recognize whole IRBP in vitro, and yet these lymphocytes must recognize the protein in vivo to initiate the autoimmune pathogenic process. We have examined here two hypothetical explanations for this dissociation: 1) It is possible that when IRBP is processed in vitro, immunodominant peptide determinants compete with the cryptic ones and inhibit their interaction with the MHC molecules on the APC. This explanation was ruled out here by the finding that the immunodominant peptide 1179-1191 (\"W10\") did not inhibit the response to a cryptic one, 1158-1180 (\"R4\"), when added at equivalent and even moderately higher concentrations. 2) The second hypothesis proposes that the cryptic antigenic sites are not generated from IRBP by the APC in vitro, whereas enzymes in the retina digest the protein to yield fragments that generate these antigenic sites upon processing by the APC. In line with this hypothesis, we have found that cleavage of IRBP by certain endoproteinases (Asp-N, Glu-C, or V-8) produced molecules that were recognized in culture by lymphocytes sensitized to the immunopathogenic but cryptic peptide R4. This study, therefore, describes a putative Ag processing mechanism that results in IRBP recognition and, consequently, the initiation of an autoimmune process by lymphocytes sensitized against a cryptic peptide. Furthermore, experiments with R4 and other cryptic peptides have shown that cleavage fragments of up to 38 residues in length can be presented by APC, to stimulate lymphocytes sensitized against these peptides. No responses were stimulated, however, by fragments of 75 or more residues. The data thus provide new insights into the processing and presentation of cryptic peptide determinants by APC.\r"

  ".U": "91237080\r", 
  ".W": "In nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice, T cells play a major role in mediating autoimmunity against pancreatic islet beta-cells. We and others previously reported that age-related alterations in the thymic and peripheral T cell repertoire and function occur in prediabetic NOD mice. To study the mechanism responsible for these T cell alterations, we examined whether a defect exists in the thymus of NOD mice at the level of TCR-mediated signaling after activation by Con A and anti-CD3. We found that thymocytes from NOD mice respond weakly to Con A- and anti-CD3-induced proliferation, compared with thymocytes from control BALB/c, BALB.B, (BALB.B x BALB.K)F1, C57BL/6, and nonobese non-diabetic mice. This defect correlates with the onset of insulitis, because it can be detected at 7 to 8 weeks of age, whereas younger mice displayed a normal T cell responsiveness. Thymic T cells from (NOD x BALB/c)F1 mice, which are insulitis- and diabetes-free, exhibit an intermediate stage of unresponsiveness. This T cell defect is not due to a difference in the level of CD3 and IL-2R expression by NOD and BALB/c thymocytes, and both NOD CD4+ CD8- and CD4- CD8+ mature thymic T cells respond poorly to Con A. BALB/c but not NOD thymic T cells respond to Con A in the presence of either BALB/c or NOD thymic APC, suggesting that the thymic T cell defect in NOD mice is intrinsic to NOD thymic T cells and is not due to an inability of NOD APC to provide a costimulatory signal. The defect can be partially reversed by the addition of rIL-2 to NOD thymocytes. To determine whether a defect in signal transduction mediates this NOD thymic T cell unresponsiveness, we tested whether these cells elevate their intracellular free Ca2+ ion concentration in response to Con A. An equivalent Con A-induced increase in Ca2+ ion concentration in both NOD and BALB/c thymocytes was observed, suggesting a normal coupling between the CD3 complex and phospholipase C in NOD thymocytes. In contrast to their low proliferative response to Con A or anti-CD3, NOD thymocytes respond normally (i.e., as do BALB/c thymocytes) to the combinations of PMA plus the Ca2+ ionophore ionomycin and PMA plus Con A but weakly to Con A plus ionomycin. Our data suggest that the age-related NOD thymocyte unresponsiveness to Con A and anti-CD3 results from a defect in the signaling pathway of T cell activation that occurs upstream of protein kinase C activation.\r"

  ".W": "IL-1 treatment of human endothelial cells leads to the rapid phosphorylation of a Mr = 29,000 (P29) set of proteins to 18 times that of control cultures. Approximately 80% of the phosphorylated P29 (pP29) disappeared within 60 min although the remaining component was stable and remained for at least another 2 h. IL-1R antagonist protein blocked phosphorylation completely. Secondary treatment of IL-1 failed to increase the level of pP29 above that remaining after 1 h although other unrelated agonists that stimulated pP29 generation could. Removal of the cytokine and incubation of the cells in agonist-free medium for 2 h resulted in the total loss of the remaining pP29. Readdition of IL-1 2 h after washout restimulated P29 phosphorylation but only back to the lower level. Maximum rephosphorylation could not be attained until 16 h after IL-1 removal. Protein kinase inhibitors 1-(5-isoquinolinylsulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine and staurosporine, the calcium chelators bis(2-amino-5-methylphenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid tetraacetoxymethyl ester and EGTA, and the calmodulin inhibitor N-(6-aminohexyl)-1-naphthalene-sulfonamide had no effect on IL-I-induced phosphorylation. However, when cultures were treated with the protein phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid alone, the level of pP29 increased after 1 h and the presence of okadaic acid during prolonged IL-1 treatment blocked the decline in pP29. The protein synthesis inhibitors puromycin, emetine, and cycloheximide also blocked the decline in pP29 during IL-1 treatment. These data suggest that IL-1-stimulated P29 phosphorylation is made up of two components, one susceptible to prolonged down-regulation even in the absence of the cytokine and one refractory to desensitization but that remains active only in the presence of IL-1. IL-1-induced changes in pP29 levels may be dependent on the relative activities of protein kinase and protein phosphatase activities.\r"

The combination of rrSCF164 plus rhIL-7 stimulated increased colony numbers compared with the sum of colonies stimulated by rrSCF164 and rhIL-7 alone. Also, increased cell proliferation per colony was stimulated by the combination of rrSCF164 plus rhIL-7 compared with rhIL-7 or rrSCF164 alone. The colonies formed with rrSCF164 plus rhIL-7 and rhIL-7 alone contained exclusively pre-B cells, which expressed B220 Ag and cytoplasmic mu-chain, but were negative for surface Ig expression. Morphological examination of the cells in the colonies showed blast-like characteristics. rrSCF164 alone and in combination with rhIL-7 stimulated generation of B220+ cells in liquid culture of B220- cells, whereas rhIL-7 alone had no stimulatory effect on B220- cells. Both stem cell factor mRNA and bioactivity were detected in a mouse bone marrow-derived stromal cell line, termed OZ-11. We propose that stem cell factor is a stromal-derived factor that synergizes with IL-7 to stimulate the proliferation and differentiation of pro-B cells to pre-B cells, which become responsive to IL-7 alone.\r"

  ".W": "CD3- large granular lymphocyte (LGL) express constitutive levels of functional IL-2R beta. TGF-beta inhibited several IL-2R beta-mediated events in LGL, including IL-2-induced NK and lymphokine-activating factor activities, IFN-gamma gene expression and secretion, and IL-2R alpha expression. TGF-beta inhibited these IL-2-induced LGL functions in a dose-dependent and reversible manner. By contrast, TGF-beta had little effect on LGL IL-2R beta expression and TGF-beta receptors were not induced by IL-2. Studies were performed to examine binding and internalization of radiolabeled IL-2. These experiments demonstrated that the rapid binding and internalization of [125I]IL-2 was not altered in CD3- LGL pretreated with TGF-beta. These internalization studies indicated that the TGF-beta inhibition represented postreceptor-binding events in NK cells. Further studies were initiated to examine signaling events in CD3- LGL. When IL-2-induced tyrosine phosphorylation events were examined, significant inhibition was seen of selected phosphoproteins in TGF-beta-pretreated cells. In addition, the ability of TGF-beta to also inhibit IL-2 induction of LGL IL-2R alpha and IFN-gamma mRNA expression was consistent with the hypothesis that posttranscriptional mechanisms were unlikely to be affected by TGF-beta. Collectively, these data indicated that TGF-beta inhibited IL-2-induced CD3- LGL functions and suggested that TGF-beta inhibition occurs either at the level of specific tyrosine phosphorylation and/or IL-2-induced transcriptional control factors.\r"

Vascular smooth muscle cells of C3H/HeJ origin produced lower amounts of CSF-1 and IL-6, and GM-CSF was barely detectable. Production of these cytokines did not require the exogenous growth factors present in FCS and occurred, although at lower levels, in serum-free medium supplemented with insulin, transferrin, and albumin. Cloned lines of MRL +/+ vascular smooth muscle cells, with electron microscopic and immunochemical properties of vascular smooth muscle cells, produced CSF-1, IL-6, and GM-CSF, establishing that vascular smooth muscle cells were a direct source of CSF-1, IL-6, and GM-CSF. These observations highlight the need for experiments to directly address the question of whether vascular smooth muscle cells constitutively produce these cytokines under physiologic conditions in vivo and suggest that vascular smooth muscle cells may participate actively in inflammation by releasing cytokines that are active on lympho-hemopoietic and other cells.\r"

Using AF10 cells, whose growth was determined to be mediated by the autocrine action of IL-6, we found that RA reduction of IL-6R was concentration-dependent over a range of 10(-11) to 10(-5) M and corresponded to the ability of the retinoid to inhibit cell proliferation. The down-regulation of IL-6R number by RA was accompanied by reduced IL-6R mRNA expression. RA did not affect endogeneous IL-6 synthesis or secretion from AF10 cells. However, addition of exogenous rIL-6 could overcome RA-induced growth inhibition. Menthol, a structurally unrelated compound to RA, also suppressed IL-6R expression and, correspondingly, inhibited cell growth. Taken together, our results suggest that the antiproliferative action of RA on AF10 cells is caused by reduction of IL-6R expression and subsequent inhibition of IL-6-mediated autocrine growth. These findings suggest the possibility that down-regulation of IL-6R is a means by which RA can modulate immune function.\r"

T cells stimulated with PHA, ionomycin, or PMA alone failed to express IL-8 mRNA. However T cells stimulated with a combination of PMA and ionomycin or PMA and PHA expressed IL-8 mRNA in a PMA dose-dependent manner and maximally after 3 to 6 h of culture. Induction of IL-8 mRNA appeared to be specifically in the CD4+ T cell subset. Surprisingly, however, T cells were not induced to secrete significant levels of IL-8 polypeptide, even in the presence of accessory monocytes. In addition, immunoprecipitation analysis of PMA/ionomycin-treated T cell lysates detected only minor levels of cellular IL-8 Ag thereby suggesting that in T cells, the production of IL-8 was inhibited at the posttranscriptional level. By contrast, CD3- large granular lymphocytes (LGL) were both induced to express IL-8 mRNA and secrete biologically active IL-8 upon specific stimulation with IL-2 and ligand (anti-CD16 mAb) for the NK cell receptor for IgG-Fc (CD16), or upon nonspecific stimulation with PMA. IL-2 and anti-CD16 mAb synergistically induced IL-8 expression in LGL. Other nonactivating LGL-specific mAb did not induce LGL IL-8 secretion. The amount of IL-8 produced by activated LGL was donor variable, but generally 5 to 10 times less than that secreted by monocytes. The ability of LGL to release IL-8 and a large number of other cytokines further supports the hypothesis that LGL may contribute to both inflammatory and immunologic responses.\r"

IL-2 production in response to soluble anti-CD3 or to Con A required the addition of accessory cells. By contrast, the addition of IL-4 strikingly enhanced the production of IL-2 by plate-bound anti-CD3-stimulated T cells in the absence or the presence of added accessory cells. Furthermore, anti-IL-4 mAb inhibited IL-2 production by anti-CD3-stimulated T cells, which indicates that endogenously produced IL-4 was important in IL-2 production by T cells to plate-bound anti-CD3. The capacity of IL-4 to enhance and of anti-IL-4 to inhibit IL-2 production in response to plate-bound anti-CD3 was also observed with both unstimulated T cells and with T cells that had been previously stimulated with anti-CD3 antibody. When activated T cells were restimulated with anti-CD3, the effect of IL-4 in enhancing IL-2 production was detectable within 6 to 8 h after restimulation. The effect of IL-4 on IL-2 production was not due to prolongation of survival or to enhanced proliferation of T cells. Northern blot analysis showed that T cells treated with anti-CD3 plus IL-4 had more than 10-fold more IL-2 mRNA than did T cells treated with anti-CD3 plus anti-IL-4; this was observed within 6 h of stimulation under certain circumstances. The increased level of IL-2 mRNA by IL-4 was achieved without any change in message half-life, suggesting that IL-4 enhances transcriptional activation of the IL-2 gene in such cells. These results lead to the conclusion that IL-4 has a critical role in IL-2 production in response to accessory cell-independent stimuli (plate-bound anti-CD3 antibody), although it is not essential to IL-2 production in response to accessory cell-dependent stimuli (soluble anti-CD3 and Con A).\r"

  ".W": "The pregnant uterus contains TNF-alpha, a potent cytokine with pleotrophic effects. The uterus also contains numerous macrophages, which are well described sources of TNF-alpha. In order to determine if uterine TNF-alpha originated with these macrophages, patterns of macrophage tissue distribution and population densities were first established in rat uterine tissues from early, mid, and late stages of gestation by immunohistology. The potential of these and other uterine and placental cells to synthesize TNF-alpha was then tested by in situ hybridization with the use of biotinylated antisense and sense RNA probes. Although TNF-alpha mRNA was present during all stages of pregnancy, hybridization signals were highest in gestation day 15 tissues. The predominant TNF-alpha mRNA-containing cells were uterine epithelium, decidual cells, and placental trophoblast cells; these cells also contained immunoreactive TNF. Transcription of the TNF gene in the uterus and placenta was also documented by Northern blotting experiments, which showed that the transcript sizes for uterine, placental, and macrophage TNF mRNA were similar. Although stromal cells that were located in macrophage-rich uterine compartments (myometrium, metrial gland) contained TNF-alpha mRNA, the cells did not contain high levels of immunoreactive TNF-alpha. Thus, cells other than macrophages are likely to be the major contributors of TNF-alpha during uncomplicated pregnancy in the rat.\r"

In this report we present evidence that in addition to IL-4 Th2 cells also produce IL-1 alpha in its active form in the absence of APC. We have found that this cytokine is an autocrine growth factor, because proliferation of Th2 cells in response to several stimuli is inhibited by anti-IL-1 alpha or anti-IL-1R mAb, or by an IL-1 alpha antisense oligodeoxynucleotide. However, Th1 cells do not produce this cytokine. We have investigated the role of endogenous IL-1 alpha on the induction of c-myc and c-myb, two protooncogenes involved in T cell activation. Here we show that endogenous IL-1 alpha is involved in the activation of both protooncogenes. Our results suggest that a possible function of IL-1 alpha, and perhaps other growth factors, might be to sustain or amplify the initial second messengers derived through the TCR. The possible implications of this finding with respect to interactions between T cell subsets and B cells or macrophages are discussed.\r"

To date, it has been shown that the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX) up-regulates IL-2 expression in T cells by stabilizing its mRNA. In this report we have examined the effect of CHX on IL-2 at the transcriptional level. We have found that CHX has a positive regulatory function in IL-2 transcription, which is dependent on prior activation of this gene. This is not due to posttranslational conversion of inactive NFkB into its active form by CHX, because a clustered mutation in the kB-like sequence in the IL-2 enhancer that abrogates NFkB binding does not affect the up-regulation of IL-2 transcription. These results favor the hypothesis that, in addition to positive factors, negative elements regulate IL-2 transcription. Furthermore, we have tested the effect of CHX on IL-4 and granulocyte-macrophage-CSF transcription of both lymphokines. These results suggest that transcriptional up-regulation by CHX may be specific for IL-2 with respect to lymphokine expression.\r"

Five antibodies were selected for their ability to bind to chemotype deep rough (Re) LPS which has two 3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonic acid (Kdo) residues in its nonreducing end. Structurally verified oligosaccharides isolated from rough LPS and synthetic analogues of Kdo were used in an enzyme immunoassay inhibition test to determine the binding epitopes for the antibodies. According to their specificities, the antibodies could be divided into three groups. For two of the groups, the recognized structure was the alpha-Kdo (2----4) Kdo disaccharide and for one group the alpha-Kdo (2----4) alpha-Kdo beta-D-GlcN (1----6) alpha-D-GlcN tetrasaccharide, representing a partial structure of the Re LPS. Inhibition studies with synthetic analogues of Kdo showed that the anomeric configuration and the free carboxyl group of the Kdo residue are important features for antibody binding. Changes in the C-1 to C-6 region of the Kdo molecule do influence the antibody recognition considerably whereas changes in the exocyclic C-7 to C-8 region are of secondary importance. Calculation of the conformation of the inner core region showed that the alpha-Kdo (2----4) alpha-Kdo (2---- disaccharide was free and accessible in chemotype Re LPS, but that linkage of a L-glycero-D-manno-heptose to O-5 of the subterminal Kdo both changes the conformation of the Kdo-disaccharide and covers it thereby making it less accessible.\r"

  ".W": "In order to define the HLA-DR and DQ alleles, as well as the specific DQA1 and DQB1 chain genes involved in the anti-Ro/La autoantibody responses, RFLP analysis and sequence-specific oligonucleotide typing was carried out on 58 Caucasians and 48 American blacks with SLE or Sjogren's syndrome and anti-Ro antibodies. Among both Caucasian and black patients, the highest relative risk for the anti-Ro response (both with and without accompanying anti-La) was conferred by heterozygosity for the DQw2.1 (in linkage disequilibrium with HLA-DR3) and DQw6 (a subtype of DQw1) alleles compared with either 269 normal race-matched controls or 80 anti-Ro negative SLE/Sjogren's syndrome patients. Analysis of individual DQA1 and DQB1 chain alleles revealed that DQA1*0501 and DQB1*0201 were most frequent, followed by DQA1 and DQB1 alleles comprising DQw6. In patients not possessing DQw2.1 and/or DQw6 alleles, HLA-DQB1*0302 and HLA-DQA1*0401 (especially in blacks) were significantly increased. Nucleotide sequence analysis of these associated alleles showed that 100% of patients with anti-Ro had a glutamine residue at position 34 of the outermost domain of the DQA1 chain and/or a leucine at position 26 of the outermost domain of the DQB1 chain. Patients with anti-Ro plus La were more likely to have all four of their DQA1/DQB1 chains containing these amino acid residues than either anti-Ro-negative SLE patients or controls. These data implicate specific amino acid residues on both DQA1 and DQB1 chains located in the floor of the Ag binding cleft of the HLA-DQA1:B1 heterodimer and further suggest a role for \"gene dosage\" in the anti-Ro (+/- La) autoantibody response.\r"

Cathepsin B at pH 5.0 cleaved and released Ii from class II MHC alpha- and beta-chains. Cathepsin B digested Ii from alpha- and beta-chains in a dose-dependent fashion, yielding 23-, 21-, and 10-kDa fragments. Blockage of cathepsin B activity with leupeptin restored the 2D(nonequilibrium pH gradient gel electrophoresis/SDS) PAGE patterns of Ii and sialic acid-derivatized forms of Ii seen without the protease. The fragmentation pattern of cathepsin D treatment was different from that of cathepsin B, yielding 25-kDa intermediates.\r"

The accumulated data, together with a previously performed comparison of tryptic peptides, suggest that the two components are structurally distinct and possibly encoded by different genes. Indeed, a mAb, raised against a synthetic peptide that was made on the basis of the published carboxyl-terminal amino acid sequence of the human mb-1 gene product, specifically reacted with the 47-kDa but not the 37-kDa subunit.

Previous studies have clearly shown that heparin in the absence of antithrombin III also has the capacity to regulate C activity. The present studies examined the ability of purified human antithrombin III to regulate classical and alternative pathways of C, alone and in the presence of heparin. Antithrombin III alone inhibited generation of both pathways in a dose-related manner; antithrombin III at 8 micrograms/10(7) cellular intermediates inhibited generation of the classical and alternative pathway convertases by 60 and 42%, respectively. Antithrombin III and heparin augmented each other's capacity to inhibit generation of both convertases in a dose-related manner. Antithrombin III did not appear to inhibit on the basis of charge because it is only slightly anionic (isoelectric pH value, 5.0); instead, antithrombin III may have acted as a serine protease inhibitor of the proteolytic enzymes of the C cascades. Antithrombin III acted only to inhibit formation of the alternative pathway convertase but had no activity on terminal lysis by this pathway; similarly, antithrombin III inhibited preformed EAC1,4b,2a,3b but had no activity on classical pathway cellular intermediates containing additional components. Finally, antithrombin III inhibited consumption of factor B hemolytic activity in a reaction mixture that also contained factor D and C3b, suggesting that factor D activity was also inhibited. These studies demonstrate the capacity of antithrombin III to regulate C and suggest that, in concert with heparin, antithrombin III may play an important role in the regulation of C in vivo.\r"

  ".U": "91237098\r", 
  ".W": "In human neutrophils, the chemotactic tripeptide FMLP and the protein kinase C activator PMA stimulate the breakdown of 1-O-[3H]alkyl-2-acyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine ([3H]EAPC) and the formation of 1-O-[3H]alkyl-2-acyl-phosphatidic acid ([3H]-EAPA) and 1-O-[3H]alkyl-2-acylglycerol ([3H]EAG) via mechanism(s) that may involve the activation of phospholipase D. We have investigated the regulation of phospholipase D by determining the effects of elevation of intracellular levels of cAMP on receptor-mediated and PMA-induced breakdown of [3H]-EAPC and formation of products. Pretreatment of neutrophils with either 10(-3) M dibutyryl-cAMP or 10(-5) M PGE2, in the presence of 4 x 10(-4) M isobutylmethylxanthine (IBMX), inhibited FMLP- and leukotriene B4-induced breakdown of [3H]EAPC and formation of [3H]EAPA and [3H]EAG. Inhibition was apparent at all time points of stimulation examined (15-120 s). In addition, the mass of diradyl-phosphatidic acid was decreased in FMLP-stimulated neutrophils pretreated with PGE2 and IBMX. In contrast, pretreatment of cells with PGE2 and IBMX did not inhibit PMA-induced breakdown of [3H]EAPC and the formation of products at 3 and 10 min after stimulation. Furthermore, formation of 1-O-[3H]alkyl-2-acyl-phosphatidylethanol, produced by phospholipase D in the presence of ethanol by a transphosphatidylation reaction, was significantly inhibited by pretreatment of cells with PGE2 and IBMX in FMLP- but not PMA-stimulated neutrophils. This differential modulation by cAMP of receptor-mediated and PMA-induced activation of phospholipase D suggests agonist-dependent activation of separate pathways and/or activation of separate phospholipase D enzymes. Thus, cAMP elevation may exert inhibitory effects directly on the phospholipase D activated by FMLP and/or on sites proximal to the enzyme that are involved in signal transmission.\r"

This event is thought to be the rate-limiting step in the generation of the lipid proinflammatory mediators, the eicosanoids and possibly platelet-activating factor. For this reason, extracellular forms of PLA2 have been postulated to be a component of the inflammatory cascade in certain biologic settings. In the synovial fluid of patients with inflammatory arthritides, substantial amounts of PLA2 activity have been found, and subsequently, one enzyme was purified, cloned, and expressed. Here we show that the pure recombinant enzyme free of any proinflammatory contaminants elicits a dramatic inflammatory, arthritogenic response when injected into the joint space of healthy rabbits. Within 24 h, extensive leukocyte infiltration and hyperplasia of the synovial lining cells were observed, and prostaglandin production in the joint space increased. In comparison, pancreatic PLA2(2) had little activity in this system, whereas a very inflammatory cobra venom enzyme was intermediate in its effects. In view of the presence of the enzyme in inflamed joints, the fact that its synthesis and secretion can be induced by proinflammatory cytokines and its proinflammatory biologic activity, we suggest that synovial PLA2 plays an exacerbating role in acute episodes in chronic inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis.\r"

  ".W": "Patients with systemic autoimmune diseases such as SLE and rheumatoid arthritis have increased rates of morbidity and mortality caused by infection. Although this increased risk of infection has been primarily attributed to therapeutic immuno-suppression, some reports exist of defective polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) function in these patients. The purpose of the present work is to investigate the recruitment of PMN phagocytic function in a murine model of autoimmunity, the MRL/lpr mouse. PMN from MRL/lpr, but not from congenic MRL/n mice, exhibit a marked defect in the amplification of FcR-mediated phagocytosis stimulated by various inflammatory mediators. This defect is acquired and correlates with the onset of the autoimmune disease observed in this strain. In addition, MRL/lpr but not MRL/n PMN exhibit a defect in extravasation into the thioglycollate-inflamed peritoneum. Incubation of MRL/n PMN in MRL/lpr serum induces a defect in the amplification of PMN phagocytic function identical to that observed with MRL/lpr PMN. The activity in the serum that induces this defect is neutralized by an antibody to TGF-beta but not by control antibodies. Incubation of murine and human PMN with purified TGF-beta induces an identical defect in stimulated FcR-mediated ingestion. In addition, TGF-beta-treated MRL/n PMN fail to extravasate into the thioglycollate-inflamed peritoneum after injection into normal MRL/n recipient mice. In addition, direct injection of TGF-beta into MRL/n mice also reduces the percentage and number of PMN in the thioglycollate-stimulated peritoneal exudates of these mice. The defect in PMN extravasation and phagocytic function was not caused by failure of the defective PMN to modulate the expression of the adhesion molecules, Mac-1 and Mel-14. These data indicate that defects in PMN function can be observed in a murine model of autoimmunity and that spontaneous production of TGF-beta possibly may play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of the defective PMN function in this animal model.\r"

Using a model system for the degradation of a macromolecular connective tissue substrate, purified neutrophil elastase and cathepsin G were both individually able to degrade cartilage matrix proteoglycan and this degradation was blocked by the appropriate specific inhibitors. Neutrophil granule lysate also produced cartilage matrix degradation but little inhibition of degradation occurred when either elastase or cathepsin G inhibitor was used alone. However, a combination of elastase and cathepsin G inhibitors each at 100 microM or each at 10 microM blocked cartilage matrix degradation by 89% +/- 1 and 65% +/- 9 (mean +/- SEM, n = 3), respectively. The magnitude of the cartilage degradation mediated by neutrophil lysate, and its sensitivity to specific inhibitors, was reproduced using purified elastase and cathepsin G at the concentrations at which they are present in neutrophil lysate. Human neutrophils stimulated with opsonized zymosan degraded cartilage matrix in a dose-dependent manner in the presence of serum antiproteases. Supernatants from stimulated neutrophils cultured in the presence of serum did not degrade cartilage matrix, indicating that neutrophil mediated degradation in the presence of serum was confined to the protected subjacent region between the inflammatory cell and the substratum. A combination of elastase and cathepsin G inhibitors each at 500 microM or each at 100 microM blocked subjacent cartilage matrix degradation by stimulated human neutrophils by 91% +/- 3 and 54% +/- 8 (mean +/- SEM, n = 5), respectively, whereas either the elastase or cathepsin G inhibitor alone was much less effective. These studies demonstrate that neutrophil-mediated cartilage matrix degradation is produced primarily by elastase and cathepsin G. Furthermore, these results support the hypothesis that inflammatory neutrophils form zones of close contact with substratum that exclude serum antiproteases and that this subjacent degradation of cartilage matrix by stimulated neutrophils can be blocked by a combination of synthetic elastase and cathepsin G inhibitors.\r"

  ".W": "Elicitation of delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) responses by DTH effector T cells requires a prior phase of DTH initiation. This consists of an immediate hypersensitivity-like response mediated by Ag-specific DTH-initiating factors that are analogous to IgE antibodies in that they sensitize tissue mast cells for release of the vasoactive amine serotonin (5-HT). Experiments were conducted to determine whether IgE mAb injected i.v., or 5-HT injected locally, could initiate DTH. It was found that small doses of IgE (1 microgram/mouse), or of 5-HT (50 to 500 ng locally), which mediated small immediate responses, were optimal for DTH initiation. Even lower doses of IgE (10 ng/mouse), or of 5-HT (5 ng locally), which did not mediate macroscopically measurable immediate responses, were capable of DTH initiation. Higher doses of IgE (10 to 100 micrograms/mouse), which mediated large immediate responses, were not able to initiate DTH. A similar dose response for DTH initiation was found with IgG1 mAb, which is another mast cell-sensitizing isotype of Ig. The inability of high doses of IgE or IgG1 to mediate DTH initiation was probably caused by local release of large inhibitory amounts of histamine, because systemic treatment with the histamine-2 receptor antagonist cimetidine allowed high doses of IgE to initiate DTH. Thus, IgE and IgG1 antibodies could initiate DTH via release of small amounts of 5-HT, but simultaneous release of large amounts of histamine were inhibitory, probably via an effect on histamine-2 receptors of recruited T cells. We concluded the following: 1) IgE or IgG1 antibodies can initiate DTH; 2) DTH initiation need not be associated with macroscopically detectable early responses; 3) mast cell release of 5-HT acts positively whereas release of histamine acts negatively in murine DTH; 4) Ag-specific factors are not the only mechanism of DTH initiation.\r"

  ".W": "Neutrophils (PMN) stimulated with the chemo-attractant FMLP, with platelet activating factor (PAF), and with phorbol dibutyrate exhibited a three- to fivefold increase in phagocytosis of IgG-opsonized sheep E (ElgG). Enhancement of phagocytosis occurred even when stimulants were washed away before the ElgG were added, showing that they could prime PMN for enhanced phagocytosis. When PMN were loaded with MAPTAM, a cell permeant analog of EGTA that prevented any rise in [Ca2+]i, they showed no FMLP-stimulated phagocytosis but had a normal phagocytic response to PAF and phorbol dibutyrate. Addition of MAPTAM after FMLP priming abolished enhanced ingestion, even in the presence of optimal extracellular Ca2+. Thus, the [Ca2+]i rise that occurred on ligation of PMN IgG FcR by ElgG was required for FMLP-stimulated phagocytosis. We determined which FcR were involved in this [Ca2+]i rise and in FMLP-stimulated phagocytosis. Aggregated (agg-IgG) IgG and the anti FcRIII mAb 3G8 both caused increases in [Ca2+]i, removal of FcRIII with phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PIPLC) abolished the 3G8-dependent rise in [Ca2+]i without affecting the agg-IgG-dependent rise. Moreover, IV.3 (anti FcRII mAb) completely inhibited the agg-IgG-induced increase in [Ca2+]i in PIPLC-treated PMN, showing that ligation of FcRII is sufficient for a normal IgG-induced [Ca2+]i rise. FMLP-stimulated phagocytosis also was unaffected by PIPLC, suggesting that the rise in [Ca2+]i required for FMLP-stimulated phagocytosis could come from FcRII ligation. From these studies we conclude that there are two molecular mechanisms for IgG-mediated phagocytosis in activated PMN. One, stimulated by FMLP, is dependent on an increase of intracellular Ca2+ during the ingestion process; the other, activated by phorbol esters and PAF, is capable of effecting high levels of ingestion at very low concentrations of [Ca2+]i. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that ligation of FcRII by IgG opsonized targets is sufficient for this Ca(2+)-dependent mechanism of stimulated phagocytosis.\r"

  ".W": "Thrombospondin (TSP), a 450-kDa trimeric glycoprotein secreted by platelets and endothelial cells at sites of tissue injury or inflammation, may play an important role in polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) adherence to blood vessel walls before diapedesis. We have examined the adherence of PMN to TSP and compared it to adherence to other extracellular matrix proteins. PMN adherence to TSP-coated plastic was complete by 60 min with spreading completed by 2 h. The kinetics of adhesion and spreading on TSP were similar to that of vitronectin (VN), laminin (LN), and fibronectin (FN). Activation of PMN with the calcium ionophore A23187 or the chemotactic peptide FMLP increased PMN adherence to LN and FN, but not to TSP or VN, suggesting that PMN activation may differentially regulate expression of TSP and VN receptors as compared to LN and FN receptors. The specificity of PMN adherence to TSP was confirmed by competition with saturating amounts of TSP and inhibition with anti-TSP antibodies. mAb A6.1, which binds to the protease-resistant core of TSP, was the most effective in blocking PMN adherence to TSP. Using TSP proteolytic fragments, we demonstrated that the primary interaction of PMN with TSP was mediated through the 140-kDa COOH-terminal domain. Inasmuch as the 140-kDa fragment of TSP contains an Arg-Gly-Asp sequence similar to the cell recognition site of FN and VN, we determined whether RGDS peptides would inhibit PMN adhesion. RGDS did not significantly inhibit PMN adhesion to TSP, VN, or LN, but reduced PMN adhesion to FN by 50%. To determine if PMN adhesion to TSP was mediated by a beta 2 integrin receptor such as LFA-1, MO-1, or p150,95, we performed adhesion assays using PMN isolated from patients with leukocyte adhesion deficiency that lack beta 2 receptors. Leukocyte adhesion deficiency PMN exhibited normal adherence to TSP. In contrast, adherence to VN, LN, and FN was reduced by 95%. Therefore, adherence to TSP is probably not mediated by a beta 2 integrin receptor. These data contribute to the accumulating evidence that PMN can interact with extracellular matrix proteins through a CD11/CD18-independent process.\r"

Several viruses also penetrate the central nervous system through the blood stream via the brain EC. The studies reported here focus on understanding the principles and consequences of interactions among viruses, lymphocytes, and EC in the brain. As shown persistent but not acute infection by lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus enhances the expression of MHC class I glycoproteins on the brain EC of mice. This increase in MHC expression during viral infection does not seem to result from the release of cytokines. However, replicative virus is required, because UV inactivated virus fails to enhance MHC expression. Viral determinants appear on EC surfaces after infection and serve as targets for CTL directed lysis. In contrast, neurons (OBL 21 neuronal cell line), which express negligible amounts of MHC class I glycoproteins, show no gain in MHC markers during persistent viral infection and are not targets for virus-specific CTL killing.\r"

In contrast these mice can be protectively immunized against leukemogenic Friend virus complex using formalin-fixed F-MuLV virions in CFA. To determine which viral proteins were responsible for this immune protection, virion proteins prepared by SDS-PAGE and electroelution were used to immunize mice. Purified gp70 envelope protein in CFA was capable of inducing strong immune protection against the challenge with Friend virus complex in H-2a/a mice. Immunologic studies demonstrated that immunized mice developed a virus-specific T cell proliferative response and showed IgM to IgG Ig class switching of virus-neutralizing antibodies. These results indicated that genetically controlled immune nonresponsiveness to F-MuLV envelope Ag in H-2a/a mice could be overcome using denatured viral envelope protein together with a strong adjuvant.\r"

  ".W": "Lyme disease is a multisystemic illness caused by the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi. In the absence of specific antibody, the spirochete is resistant to the bactericidal activity of C, despite the capacity of B. burgdorferi to activate both C pathways. We examined the mechanism of serum resistance by measuring the deposition of C3 and terminal C components on B. burgdorferi in the presence and absence of immune IgG. In normal human serum antibody-sensitized borreliae bound similar amounts of C3, and similar or increased amounts of C8 and C9, in comparison to unsensitized bacteria. However, at comparable levels of C3, C8, or C9 uptake, only sensitized bacteria were killed. The requirement of antibody for killing could not be explained by differences in the rate of C deposition or by differences in the C9 to C8 ratio in the membrane attack complex (MAC). We found that bacteria incubated in C5-depleted human serum, but not in C6-depleted serum, were killed when this treatment was followed by antibody and the missing C components. Bacteria were also killed by reactive lysis (C5b-9) provided that antibody was present. Therefore, the effect of bactericidal IgG occurred at the stage of C5b binding to the bacterial surface. Elution studies of bound C9 indicated that the MAC was stably bound to the outer membrane of B. burgdorferi, whether or not the bacteria were treated with antibody. However, treatment with 0.1% trypsin released 48% of 125I-C9 from the surface of unsensitized borreliae and 24% from IgG-sensitized cells, demonstrating that the presence of the antibody changed the accessibility to trypsin of C9 in the MAC. These results indicate that the effect of antibody in the killing process is not to enhance the rate or extent of initial or terminal component binding, but rather to alter the bacterial outer membrane to allow effective MAC formation.\r"

Polyclonal Ad5-specific CTL were prepared by priming mice in vivo with live Ad5 virus followed by secondary in vitro stimulation of the spleen cells with virus-infected syngeneic cells. The Ad5-specific CTL were Db restricted in C57BL/10 and Kk restricted in C3H/HeJ. In BALB/c mice both Kd- and Dd/Ld-restricted CTL were detected. The polyclonal Ad5-specific CTL response in C57BL/10 mice is directed exclusively against the products of the E1A region, which comprises only 5% of the Ad5 genome. In BALB/c mice E1A is at best a very minor target Ag and in C3H/HeJ mice E1A is not recognized at all. Using the H-2 congenic mouse strains B10.BR (H-2k) and C3H.SW (H-2b) it was shown that the immunodominance of E1A is H-2 dependent. The 19-kDa glycoprotein encoded in the E3 region of Ad5, which binds to class I MHC in the endoplasmic reticulum and prevents its translocation to the cell surface, does not affect the specificity of the CTL response in C57BL/10 mice toward E1A. However, it affects the MHC restriction of the Ad5-specific response in BALB/c mice, selectively inhibiting generation of Kd-restricted CTL.\r"

The 44 uninfected individuals from the hyper- and mesoendemic areas, because of their considerable exposure to this disease, were classified as \"putatively immune.\" Intact nodules containing adult worms of Onchocerca volvulus were homogenized in the presence of protease inhibitors and fractionated into particulate and aqueous isotonic soluble antigens. Systematic analysis of these Ag fractions showed considerable amounts of Ig, presumably associated with Ag in the form of immune complexes. Individual specific antibody reactions from all 778 patients to nodule Ag were examined. Reactions to O. volvulus antigens by antibodies from patients with confirmed parasitic infections were almost exclusively restricted to IgG1 and IgG4 isotypes. Antigenic activity appeared to be primarily associated with low molecular mass (14 to 29 kDa) components. Some competitive blocking of antibody activities of other isotypes by IgG1 was observed, most notable was that of IgG3 and IgA. IgG4 and IgM activities were not significantly blocked.\r"

The study population was separated into five groups based on clinical status: N+F+, N+F-, N-F+, N-F-H+, and N-F-H-, where N = O. volvulus adults (nodule), F = microfiladermia, and H = history of O. volvulus infection. A subset of 44 individuals with high exposure to onchocerciasis from the N-F-H- group were critically evaluated and designated as \"putatively immune.\" IgG1 reactivity to O. volvulus Ag was elevated in the majority of infected persons, but not in putatively immune individuals. Specific IgG3 levels, however, were equally elevated in all groups. The majority of N+F- persons also had elevated IgG1 levels, but they were lower than those found in F+ persons. IgG3 reactivities to a group of antigens at 20 kDa (GP20) were seen in many uninfected persons and some N+F- persons. In contrast, most F+ persons, react to this Ag with IgG1 and not IgG3. A mangabey inoculated with the infectious larval stage of O. volvulus (L3), but showed no signs of infection, began to recognize GP20 at 2 wk postinoculation. Early recognition of GP20 was possibly elicited by the larval stage. Purified nodule Ag from N+F+ individuals contained GP20, however, identical nodule Ag prepared from N+F- individuals did not. These data suggest that GP20 Ag may be common to both uterine microfilaria and the infectious larval stages. The fact that GP20 is predominantly recognized by IgG3 in putatively immune persons and some N+F- persons suggests that this increased IgG3 activity may be important in acquired immunity to onchocerciasis.\r"

Secreted scy family peptides as a group, and MIP-1 alpha in particular, have inflammatory and mitogenic activities, and the family has been divided into CXC and CC subfamilies according to the spacing of conserved cysteine residues in the primary amino acid sequences. We have isolated and characterized a genomic clone encoding the CC subfamily member MIP-1 alpha. The organization of the murine MIP-1 alpha gene into three exons interrupted by two introns is identical to that found for other members of the CC subfamily (e.g., huLD78, muJE, huJE/MCP-1, muTCA3, and hul-309), which has been taken as evidence of evolution from a common ancestral gene. With the exception of the ratPF4 gene, which shares the two-intron/three-exon pattern typical of the CC subfamily, sequenced genes encoding CXC subfamily peptides (e.g., hulL-8 and hulP-10) include an additional intervening sequence that creates a fourth exon. Genomic nucleotide sequences 5' of the MIP-1 alpha cap site are highly homologous to corresponding regions of the human gene encoding a CC peptide variously designated as LD78/GOS19/pAT464, including consensus regulatory motifs in common, reinforcing the contention that MIP-1 alpha and LD78 may be interspecies homologs.\r"

The CD3- small lymphocytes appeared to have no granules based on light and electron microscopy and lack of right-angle scatter on the FACS; we thus refer to them as small \"agranular\" lymphocytes (SAL). The lytic activity against K562 is inhibited by treatment with either L-leucine methyl ester or EGTA, which are reported to effect granule-dependent killing. We suggest that the SAL have lytic molecules in their cytoplasm (which are sensitive to these treatments) but that these molecules are not organized into discrete granules as found in LGL. The CD3- SAL are phenotypically very similar to LGL and both SAL and LGL mediated equal and reproducible antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity. These observations force redefinition of the concept of NK cells to include both CD3- LGL and CD3- SAL.\r"

Four measures of anxiety and depression were used: Covi, Raskin, Affects Balance, and Symptoms Checklist-90 (SCL-90). Results showed that both treatment arms resulted in significant (P less than .001) decrease in observer and patient-reported anxious and depressed mood symptoms. Although both treatment arms were effective, patients receiving the drug showed a slightly more rapid decrease in anxiety and greater reduction of depressive symptoms. These findings confirm efficacy of both alprazolam and relaxation to reduce cancer-related anxiety and depression.

  ".W": "On study CCG-161 of the Childrens Cancer Study Group (CCSG), 631 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) at low risk for relapse were randomized to receive monthly pulses of vincristine-prednisone (VCR-PDN ) during maintenance therapy in addition to standard therapy with mercaptopurine (6MP) and methotrexate (MTX), and either cranial irradiation during consolidation or intrathecal (IT) MTX every 3 months during maintenance. All patients received six doses of IT MTX during induction and consolidation. With a minimum follow-up time of 4.25 years, 76.7% receiving VCR-PDN were in continuous complete remission at 5 years, in contrast to 63.9% receiving GMP-MTX alone (P = .002). The difference in relapse-free survival was due primarily to bone marrow relapse (P = .0008), and in boys also to testicular relapse (P = .003). Among the nonirradiated patients, the 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) was 79.4% for patients randomized to the VCR-PDN pulses, in contrast to 61.2% for the patients randomized to receive 6MP-MTX alone (P = .0002). Among the irradiated patients, the DFS was not significantly different. Of the four combinations of maintenance and CNS therapy studied, the highest DFS was achieved with VCR-PDN pulses and maintenance IT MTX.\r"

  ".U": "91237387\r", 
  ".W": "Twenty-five children with refractory solid tumors were given recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (rhGM-CSF) in escalated doses of 60 to 1,500 micrograms/m2 as 2-hour intravenous infusions, beginning 24 hours after myelosuppressive treatment with cisplatin and etoposide. Tolerance to rhGM-CSF was exceptional even at dose levels that exceeded the maximum-tolerated dosage (MTD) reported for adults. The agent produced dose-related increases in platelet and neutrophil counts, resulting in significantly shorter durations of severe neutropenia and thrombocytopenia (P less than .01 for each analysis). At the higher dosages (greater than or equal to 750 micrograms/m2), treatment with rhGM-CSF reduced the median number of days of antibiotic therapy for fever and neutropenia by approximately one half. We conclude that rhGM-CSF is well tolerated by leukopenic children in doses as high as 1,500 micrograms/m2. An MTD was not reached in this study. The ability of the growth factor to reduce severe neutropenia and thrombocytopenia suggests it will have an important role in the management of childhood solid tumors.\r"

Eighty-five long-term survivors of non-CNS cancers aged 6 to 16 years were classified into groups on the basis of CNS treatments: CRT-IT (n = 25), CRT-No IT (n = 11), No CRT-IT (n = 24), and No CRT-No IT (n = 25). Study I findings did not provide support for synergistic mechanisms; nonorthogonal analysis of variance showed interaction effects (CRT x IT) restricted to tactile-perceptual speed. However, main effects were significant for a single agent (CRT) across a wide range of measures. General intelligence, academic achievement, verbal knowledge and reasoning, and perceptual-motor abilities were found to be significantly lower among CRT-treated groups. Study II findings provided additional support for the role of CRT; Pearson correlations within the CRT-No IT group indicated significant negative associations between CRT dose estimates for cortical regions and perceptual-motor abilities.\r"

  ".U": "91237389\r", 
  ".W": "The objectives of this study were to determine (1) the role of selection before bone marrow transplantation (BMT), (2) the role of vincristine, melphalan, and total body irradiation (TBI) as consolidation of induction therapy for stage IV over 12 months at diagnosis, and (3) the role of immunomagnetic purging in metastatic neuroblastoma. Among 72 consecutive unselected patients, 10 were not grafted (four died at induction: two in complete remission [CR], two in partial remission [PR]); three had bone marrow progression before harvest; one had uncontrolled progression; and two had parental refusal). Sixty-two patients were grafted (23 in CR/very good PR [VGPR] and 39 in PR). Among the 62, 33 were consolidated with at least 90% excision of their initial tumor excised (53.2%), 15 with catecholamine secretions (24.2%), 22 with minor bone marrow involvement (35.5%), and 31 with positive bone scan (50%). Median observation time is 59 months. Progression-free survival (PFS) for the 10 excluded patients was 20% at 2 years and 0% at 4 years. PFS for the grafted population (n = 62) is 40% at 2 years, 20% at 4 years, and 13% at 7 years. No difference was observed between patients grafted in CR/VGPR or in PR. However, a group of 19 children was grafted resulting in complete normalization of metastasis (regardless of primary-site tumor status). In this group, PFS at 59 months was 38% with no relapses up to 7 years post-BMT. A group of 31 patients with no bone involvement at BMT was also identified. PFS at 5 years is 30% compared with 12% for bone-positive patients at BMT. Moreover, the 11 children presenting at diagnosis with no bone involvement (Evans stage IVS or stage C Memphis) and consolidated with BMT had PFS at 5 years of 50% with no late relapses. A subgroup of stage IV neuroblastoma patients older than 1 year of age at diagnosis may be curable with this therapeutic approach, and the use of multivariate analyses to search for prognostic factors is warranted in currently existing international registries.\r"

On the basis of two Pediatric Oncology Group (POG) studies, one a surgery plus conventional chemotherapy study (POG 8441) and the other an elective autologous transplant pilot protocol (POG 8340), there was no significant prognostic benefit of switching in remission from the surgery plus chemotherapy protocol to the transplant protocol (P = .91) or of switching in remission from the surgery plus chemotherapy protocol to any transplant (P = .75). The analysis is based on 116 patients achieving a complete or partial remission, 32 of whom received transplants on the pilot protocol, and 17 of whom received transplants outside the pilot protocol. While potential selection bias precludes cause-effect conclusions, these data strongly suggest that a large randomized trial of autologous bone marrow transplantation should be conducted before accepting this form of therapy as standard.\r"

Dose intensity (DI) of each drug was calculated as milligrams per square meter per week. Linear regression analyses showed that the Dls of VM26 and CDDP had the greatest influence on clinical outcomes (ie, proportion of major response, median survival, and median progression-free survival [PFS]), while those of CPM and DOXO were less significant. VCR had no influence on the three clinical end points. Although many protocols extended treatment to more than 1 year, none of these end points correlated positively with the duration of therapy. Twenty-one weeks appeared adequate for achieving superior response, median survival, and median PFS. These results suggest that maximal dose intensification of selective drugs over a short duration may improve the outcome of patients with poor-risk neuroblastoma.\r"

Apart from purely medical studies comparing (radical) mastectomy to less intruding surgical treatment, a number of studies (N = 18) have been published investigating the impact of breast-conserving treatment versus mastectomy on quality of life. We review these studies with respect to medical issues (treatment modality, stage of disease), methodologic issues (design, measurement moment, sample size), and results (psychologic discomfort, changes in life patterns, fears and concerns). It is concluded that there is no solid proof of a better psychologic adjustment after breast-conserving treatment and that there are no substantial differences between the different treatment modalities in changes of life patterns and fears and concerns. However, the results with respect to body image and sexual functioning favor the use of breast-conserving treatment.\r"

Although progestins have been the standard initial treatment for metastatic disease for the past 30 years, they are effective in only 20% of patients, and several large randomized trials have failed to demonstrate any benefit in the adjuvant setting. Alternative agents such as tamoxifen have shown modest activity. Few studies have investigated combinations of hormonally active drugs. Doxorubicin and cisplatin are the most active cytotoxic agents; a current randomized study is comparing the combination of these drugs with single-agent doxorubicin. Maximizing the effectiveness of established drugs, possibly with hematopoietic growth factors, and identifying alternative hormonal and cytotoxic agents with a sound scientific rationale will hopefully increase the effective treatment options for these patients.\r"

  ".W": "The study population included 136 patients with stage IA, IB, IIA, IIB, or IIIA1 Hodgkin's disease. The median follow-up is 7.5 years. Among the 30 patients with peripheral IA disease, all patients achieved a complete response (CR) with radiation therapy, and no patient has relapsed. Patients of other stages were randomized to receive radiation therapy or mechlorethamine, vincristine, procarbazine, and prednisone (MOPP). Among the 51 patients randomized to receive radiation therapy, 49 (96%) achieved complete remission, 17 (35%) have relapsed, and 10 (20%) have died. Fifty-two of the 54 (96%) assessable patients randomized to receive MOPP obtained CRs, seven (13%) have relapsed, and four (7%) have died. The projected 10-year disease-free survival of patients randomized to receive radiation therapy is 60%; for those randomized to receive MOPP, it is 86% (P2 = .009 in favor of MOPP). The projected 10-year overall survival for patients randomized to radiation therapy is 76%, and for MOPP-treated patients it is 92% (P2 = .051 in favor of MOPP). When the randomized patients with massive mediastinal disease or stage IIIA1 disease were excluded from the analysis, the disease-free (67% for radiation v 82% for MOPP) and overall survival (85% for radiation v 90% for MOPP) were not significantly different between the two arms. Subset analysis showed significant superiority of MOPP in the treatment of the following patient groups: stage IIIA1 or massive mediastinal disease, no B symptoms, initial erythrocyte sedimentation rate greater than 20 mm, four or more sites of disease, and younger than age 40 years. Preliminary analysis of this ongoing study shows that MOPP chemotherapy is at least as effective as radiation therapy in the treatment of the specific groups of early-stage Hodgkin's disease patients randomized. The final assessment of these two diverse treatment options will depend largely on the long-term survival and the incidence of early- and late-treatment complications for which patients are continuing to be observed.\r"

Four patients received indium-111 (111In)-labeled monoclonal antiferritin (QCI). Targeting was not observed in tumor-bearing areas. Instead, scans showed rapid accumulation of QCI in normal liver. Forty-five patients were injected with 111In-labeled polyclonal antiferritin (rabbit, pig, or baboon). Forty (89%) patients showed tumor uptake, with dosimetric estimates ranging from 300 to 3,000 cGy in 1 week for the subsequently administered yttrium-90 (90Y)-labeled antiferritin. Yttrium-labeled antibody caused hematologic toxicity. Treatment-induced toxicity was not observed in any other organ system. Intravenous autologous bone marrow cells, 18 days after the yttrium infusion, accelerated hematopoietic recovery in eight patients receiving 30 mCi or 40 mCi. Hematopoietic recovery after a 20 mCi 90Y-labeled antiferritin infusion was not influenced by an autologous bone marrow transplant. Two patients receiving 20 mCi and one patient receiving 50 mCi remained aplastic after transplantation for unknown reasons. In 29 assessable patients, a 62% response rate was observed; nine of the 18 responses were complete. Responses ranging from 2 to 26 months were more commonly noted in patients with small tumors and long disease histories. Dosimetric calculations did not predict for responses. Recurrences frequently occurred in new areas instead of areas exhibiting bulky disease at the start of the treatment. Complete responses after 90Y antiferritin were significantly (P less than .02) more frequent than in a previous study with iodine-131 (131I) antiferritin. Further improvements are needed to make this new treatment modality curative.\r"

  ".W": "Thirty patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) receiving chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (CHOP) were randomized to receive either subcutaneous recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (rGM-CSF) or no additional therapy. Recombinant rGM-CSF (at a dose of 10-20 micrograms/kg/d) was given on days 1 to 10 (early rGM-CSF) to the first five patients, but was changed to days 4 to 13 (delayed rGM-CSF) of each chemotherapy cycle in subsequent patients. Compared with the control group (N = 10), the delayed rGM-CSF group (N = 11) had higher mean nadirs of the absolute neutrophil count (0.36 v 0.89 x 10(9)/L; P = .009), shorter mean durations of neutropenia (4.9 v 1.3 days; P = .02), fewer chemotherapy cycles complicated by neutropenia and fever (67% v 27%; P = .001), fewer days hospitalized for fever and neutropenia (4.9 v 1.8; P = .004), fewer reductions in chemotherapy dosages, and less frequent delays in chemotherapy administration. No significant differences were observed between patients in the control group and those in the early rGM-CSF group (N = 5). Median levels of serum HIV-1 p24 antigen decreased to 18% and 17% of baseline values in control (N = 4) and rGM-CSF groups (N = 6), respectively, 1 week following administration of the first cycle of chemotherapy. In the third week after chemotherapy, median antigen levels remained below baseline in the control group, but rose to 243% of baseline values in the rGM-CSF group (P = .01), suggesting stimulation of HIV replication. The effect of this change in HIV activity on clinical outcome of treated patients could not be determined, and therefore the clinical significance of this finding remains unclear. Complete response rates of 67%, 70%, and 60% were observed in the control, delayed rGM-CSF, and early rGM-CSF groups, respectively, with corresponding survival times of 9.0, 11.4, and 8.0 months.\r"

  ".W": "Small-noncleaved-cell (SNC) lymphoma is a high-grade, biologically aggressive neoplasm notable for poor response to therapy, high relapse rate, and less than a 20% long-term survival. We treated 20 patients with SNC lymphoma with a novel chemotherapeutic regimen using intensive doses of chemotherapy at frequent intervals in the inpatient setting. All patients were previously untreated. Sixteen patients (80%) had stage IV disease. Most patients (95%) had at least one other characteristic associated with poor prognosis (bulky [greater than 10 cm] disease, multiple extranodal sites, poor performance status), and 85% had two or more characteristics associated with poor prognosis. Seventeen patients (85%) achieved a complete response (CR) to therapy, including all three patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated disease. There have been three relapses, all occurring less than 18 months after treatment, and two of three relapses occurred in patients who were unable to complete therapy. At a median follow-up of 29 months, 13 patients (65%) remain disease-free; the calculated 5-year actuarial disease-free survival is 60%. Toxicity, chiefly myelosuppression, was severe but manageable. There were two treatment-related deaths, both in elderly patients with poor performance status and advanced-stage disease. These data suggest that such a dose-intensive approach improves the response and survival of patients with SNC lymphoma.\r"

  ".W": "This investigation was undertaken to assess the apparent poor survival of older patients with Hodgkin's disease. The clinical course of Hodgkin's disease in 136 patients, 60 to 79 years of age, was compared with that of 223 patients, 40 to 59 years of age. The patients registered from November 1977 through December 1983 had not been previously treated, and were treated at eight cancer centers. When the prognosis of all patients was examined by age, a definite change in the pattern of survival first appeared in the 60- to 69-year-old cohort. The entire older group (60 to 79 years) experienced twice the risk of dying from Hodgkin's disease and four times the risk of dying from other causes than did the younger group. In both groups, stage of disease was the strongest factor in predicting adjusted survival. Delay in treatment and advanced stage at presentation were not characteristic of Hodgkin's disease in older patients as has been postulated. Older patients responded to therapy with a similar complete remission rate (84% v 88% in the younger group, P = .24). From this study, we conclude that (1) Hodgkin's disease in the older adult does not have a different natural history, its major risk factors are similar to those known in other age groups, and thus should be amenable to existing therapeutic approaches; and (2) the prognosis of older patients with Hodgkin's disease has been obscured in previous studies by the inclusion of deaths due to other causes in survival estimates.\r"

  ".W": "Pretreatment serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels were assayed in 288 patients presenting with small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) between 1976 and 1985. Patients were routinely staged by physical examination, chest x-ray, bone, brain, and liver scans, and bone marrow evaluation. Clinical response and survival were assessed following treatment with combination chemotherapy as part of four clinical trials. Patients with extensive disease (ED) presented with a higher incidence (108 of 147, 73%) of abnormally elevated LDH (greater than 193 IU/L) than those (65 of 141, 46%) with limited disease (LD) (P = 2 x 10(-6)). Forty percent of patients had an initial normal LDH level and a higher response rate (89 of 108, 82%; complete response [CR], 47%) than those with elevated values of LDH (119 of 156, 76%; CR, 29%). The CR rate varied inversely with the level of LDH in patients with LD (P = .026) but not in those with ED (P = .300). The median survival time and 1-year and 2-year survival rates for patients with elevated LDH were 39 weeks and 33% and 6%, respectively, whereas for those with a normal LDH level these were 53 weeks and 54% and 16%, respectively. Patients with LD and elevated levels of LDH manifested a higher relative death rate (1.63:1) when compared with patients with LD and LDH in the normal range (P = .0083). The survival of patients with ED did not differ between those with normal and elevated levels of LDH (P = .273). A significant survival advantage persisted for patients with LDH in the normal range following adjustments for extent of disease, performance status (PS), and treatment protocol (P = .044, log-rank analysis). In conclusion, serum LDH appears to be a significant independent pretreatment prognostic factor in patients with SCLC that correlates with stage of disease, response to treatment, and survival.\r"

Between May 1984 and August 1986, 107 patients with previously untreated squamous cell carcinoma were randomly assigned, after stratification by age (less than 50 v greater than 50 years), extent of parametrial involvement (unilateral v bilateral), and lymphangiographic findings (negative v positive) to pelvic radiotherapy (RT; arm A) or three cycles of chemotherapy (CT; bleomycin, vincristine, mitomycin, and cisplatin [BOMP]), followed by the same radiotherapy regimen (CT + RT; arm B). The groups were balanced by age, performance status, extent of parametrial involvement, bulkiness of cervical disease, nodal involvement, and presence of hydronephrosis. Minimal follow-up is 34 months. A complete local response was observed in 32.5% of the patients in arm A and in 47% of the patients in arm B (P = .19). Overall 5-year survival rates were 39% for the RT arm and 23% for the CT + RT approach (P = .02). Toxicity was severe in arm B and included fatal pulmonary toxicity in four patients. Locoregional and distant failures were similar in both groups. We conclude that, despite a satisfactory response rate, neoadjuvant BOMP chemotherapy adversely affects survival in stage III B cervical cancer and is associated with unacceptable toxicity.\r"

Unfortunately, the use of the drug delivered IP at high doses (20 mg/m2 in 2 L normal saline [NS]) on a monthly schedule is compromised by severe local effects secondary to the irritant properties of the drug. To reduce toxicity and take advantage of minimal systemic drug exposure following IP administration, we treated 28 patients with a lower drug concentration of mitoxantrone (10 mg/m2 in 2 L NS), but on a weekly or every other week schedule (total, 12 courses). Compared with the monthly program, this regimen caused less pain, allowed for a higher cumulative dose of mitoxantrone to be delivered, and resulted in less serious treatment-related morbidity. Four of 13 assessable patients (31%) whose largest tumor was less than or equal to 1 cm in diameter demonstrated a surgically defined response. All responding patients had failed previously or exhibited a minimal response to cisplatin. Despite the improved toxicity profile of this regimen, the overall response rate was similar to the monthly program, probably secondary to inadequate IP drug distribution in many patients. Future investigative efforts using IP mitoxantrone as therapy for ovarian cancer might focus on developing methods to improve drug delivery to all sites of tumor within the peritoneal cavity (eg, intraoperative therapy, increased treatment volumes, and antiinflammatory agents to reduce adhesion formation).\r"

In the present study, we evaluated the clinical significance of this new carbohydrate antigen, STN, in patients with epithelial ovarian cancer. With the use of a radioimmunoassay developed to detect STN antigen in serum, elevated (greater than or equal to 32.6 U/mL) antigen levels were observed in 50.0% of patients with ovarian cancer. In contrast, 3.8% of healthy individuals had STN antigen levels greater than or equal to 32.6 U/mL. In 9.6% of patients with benign gynecologic diseases and 0% of pregnant women, there were elevated levels of STN antigen. There was a significant difference (P less than .001) in STN antigen levels between patients with ovarian cancer and patients with benign gynecologic diseases, pregnant women, or the controls. The mean +/- SD for all evaluated samples of ovarian cancer was 109.2 +/- 146.8 U/mL. Both the mean values and the positive rate increased as the stage advanced. Classified according to the histologic type, the highest positive rate (61.0%) was observed in mucinous adenocarcinoma. The usefulness of STN antigen as a circulating tumor marker in ovarian cancer was estimated as follows: sensitivity 50.0%, specificity 93.5%, positive predictive value 72.2%, negative predictive value 84.7%, and diagnostic value 46.8%. Serum STN antigen levels were elevated in 12 of 33 patients with ovarian cancer who had serum CA 125 antigen levels less than 35 U/mL. While CA 125 antigen levels were elevated in 74.6% and STN antigen levels were elevated in 50.0% of the same population, the use of both assays indicated the sensitivity of detection of 83.8% in the population studied.\r"

The median follow-up time was 77 months. RNF was the first site of failure for 38 of the 1,624 patients (2.3%). The incidence of axillary failure for patients undergoing axillary dissection (AXD) who were irradiated to the breast only was 2.1% (nine of 420) for patients with negative nodes and 2.1% (one of 47) for patients with one to three positive nodes. The incidence of supraclavicular failure in these two groups was 1.9% (eight of 420) and 0% (zero of 47), respectively. The incidences of axillary and supraclavicular failure in patients without clinically suspicious axillary involvement who did not have AXD but were treated with RT were 0.8% (three of 355) and 0.3% (one of 364), respectively. Despite various combinations of salvage surgery, RT, and systemic therapy, only 47% of patients (18 of 38) achieved complete regional control after nodal relapse. We conclude that RNF is uncommon in patients treated to the breast alone following an adequate AXD when the axillary nodes are negative or when one to three nodes are positive. RNF is also uncommon in patients with a clinically uninvolved axilla treated with nodal RT without AXD. Symptoms of RNF can be controlled in most but not all patients. Further study is needed to determine if the benefits of RT in preventing a small number of symptomatic RNF outweigh the potential toxicity for any subgroup of patients.\r"

  ".W": "Between 1962 and 1984, a total of 433 patients were treated at Yale-New Haven Hospital with conservative surgery and radiation therapy (CS + RT) to the intact breast. As of January 1990, with a minimum assessable follow-up of 5 years and a median follow-up of 8.21 years, there have been a total of 50 breast recurrences resulting in a 5-year actuarial breast recurrence rate of 8%. Of all clinical factors tested, young age was the most significant prognostic factor for local recurrence (P less than .03). In addition, patients with pathologically involved lymph nodes were noted to have a lower local recurrence rate than patients with pathologically negative axillae (P less than .05). These findings were especially notable given the fact that the node-positive group had a higher percentage of T2 tumors and a higher percentage of patients in the young age group. These paradoxical findings, however, may be explained by the fact that 88% of the node-positive patients underwent adjuvant systemic therapy in the form of either systemic chemotherapy or hormonal therapy, while only 8% of node-negative patients underwent any adjuvant systemic therapy. When analyzed as a function of adjuvant therapy, those patients receiving adjuvant therapy had a lower local recurrence rate than those patients not receiving adjuvant therapy (P less than .08). We conclude that adjuvant systemic therapy impacts on the ipsilateral breast recurrence rate in patients treated with CS + RT. The implications of this study in light of the widespread use of adjuvant systemic therapy are discussed.\r"

  ".W": "The possibility that meningioma growth may be related to female sex hormone levels is suggested by several lines of evidence. Meningiomas are twice as common in women as in men, have been observed to wax and wane with pregnancy, and are positively associated with breast cancer. A physiological explanation for these phenomena is provided by the finding of steroid hormone receptors in meningiomas. However, unlike breast cancer, meningiomas are much more commonly positive for progesterone receptors than for estrogen receptors. The authors initiated a study on long-term oral therapy of unresectable meningiomas with the antiprogesterone mifepristone (RU486). Fourteen patients received mifepristone in daily doses of 200 mg for periods ranging from 2 to 31+ months (greater than or equal to 6 months in 12 patients). Five patients have shown signs of objective response (reduced tumor measurement on computerized tomography scan or magnetic resonance image, or improved visual field examination). Three have also experienced subjective improvement (improved extraocular muscle function or relief from headache). The side effects of long-term mifepristone therapy have been mild. Fatigue was noted in 11 of the 14 patients. Other side effects included hot flashes in five patients, gynecomastia in three, partial alopecia in two, and cessation of menses in two. Long-term therapy with mifepristone is a new therapeutic option that may have efficacy in cases of unresectable benign meningioma.\r"

  ".W": "A specific group of intrinsic dorsal midbrain tumors was identified in six children by computerized tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. Each patient presented with raised intracranial pressure as a result of hydrocephalus due to obstruction of the sylvian aqueduct. No patient had brain-stem signs referable to the tectal tumor initially or subsequently. All six children underwent cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) diversionary procedures. The radiological features were consistent and specific, with all patients showing tectal calcification or primary increased attenuation of the tectal plate on CT scans. In addition, lack of contrast enhancement was noted initially in four patients and eventually in all six patients. In all patients MR imaging showed a focal tectal tumor distorting the collicular plate with no cystic component and increased signal intensity on T2-weighted images. There has been no evidence of progression in these six patients in the follow-up period ranging from 8 months to 17 years (8 months and 2 1/2, 4 1/2, 8, and 17 years). Diversion of CSF has been the only surgical treatment and no patient underwent deep x-ray therapy. Five patients have had normal intellectual development. In contrast to the majority of previously described periaqueductal and tectal tumors, this group of lesions appeared to be truly benign. The authors suggest that patients presenting with these clinical and radiological features may be managed by CSF diversion, serial examination, and MR imaging.\r"

  ".U": "91237423\r", 
  ".W": "The authors reviewed the hospital charts of 415 pediatric patients treated for benign or malignant primary brain tumors over the past 20 years at the Children's Hospital Medical Center, Seattle. Patients' ages ranged from the neonatal period to 18 years. A shunt was placed in 152 patients (37%), 45 before and 94 after surgery. Confirmation of extraneural metastases was based on clinical and diagnostic examination. Factors analyzed as possibly influencing the occurrence of extraneural metastases were: 1) the shunt: type, valve, location, filter, and revisions; 2) extent of resection; 3) pathology; and 4) treatment regimen. Eight of the 415 patients developed extraneural metastases during life. All eight patients had a medulloblastoma (cerebellar primitive neuroectodermal tumor). These eight patients were separated into Group A (without a shunt) and Group B (with a shunt). In Group A (five patients), the mean interval from primary diagnosis to metastasis was 15 months. Two children had gross total resection of the tumor. The predominant location of metastases in Group A was: bone (two cases); cervical lymph nodes (one); lung/bone (one); and retroperitoneal pelvic mass (one). Three Group A patients had a simultaneous central nervous system (CNS) recurrence. Of the three Group B patients, two had a ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt and one a ventriculoatrial (VA) shunt; all were placed postoperatively. One Group B patient had a simultaneous CNS recurrence. No shunt revisions were performed in these three patients. The mean time from primary diagnosis to metastasis was 25 months. One patient had a total tumor resection. The predominant location of metastases was bone (one case), retroperitoneal pelvic mass (one), and abdominal cavity with ascites (one case). Only one patient in the entire series had a filter placed; this resulted in shunt obstruction and was removed 1 month following placement. It is concluded that cerebrospinal fluid shunts, regardless of type, location, revision rate, or filter insertion, do not predispose pediatric patients with brain tumors to develop extraneural metastases. A diagnosis of shunt-related metastases should be based on the development of intra-abdominal (VP shunt) or pulmonary (VA shunt) dissemination primarily with or without additional sites. The diagnosis of medulloblastoma is an important factor related to metastasis occurrence while the extent of resection and postoperative therapy are not influential.\r"

  ".W": "The authors report 10 cases of spontaneous pyogenic spinal osteomyelitis encountered within a 3-year period. There were six women and four men, ranging in age from 60 to 84 years. Six cases occurred at the thoracic level, three at the lumbar level, and one in the cervical spine. No patient was diabetic, immunocompromised, or receiving steroid therapy, and none had a history of endocarditis or intravenous drug abuse. No patient had undergone previous spinal surgery. There were no instances of coexisting tuberculosis or malignancy. Contemporaneous cases with known predisposing factors have been excluded from this report; however, three patients did have a recent history of somatic infection, one with known sepsis. All 10 patients had been previously misdiagnosed, frequently by neurosurgeons and orthopedists as well as by internists and family practitioners. Three had undergone inappropriate or unnecessary surgical procedures, and two had received inappropriate radiation therapy. Seven cases were caused by Staphylococcus species. Gram-negative bacteria, or anaerobic infections. In the other three, no bacteriological diagnosis was made, secondary to prolonged antibiotic therapy before surgery. Each patient had developed symptomatic neural element compression, spinal instability, or both by the time of their referral. The patients with subcervical pyogenic spinal osteomyelitis underwent transthoracic or retroperitoneal decompression and corpectomy with simultaneous autologous bone grafting, followed by 6 weeks of bed rest and 6 weeks of intravenous broad-spectrum or organism-specific antibiotic therapy. They were then mobilized in orthoses for an additional 6 weeks. In no case were foreign implants employed or further stabilization procedures necessitated. One patient required an additional 6 weeks of antibiotics for recalcitrant Pseudomonas colonization. Despite the patients' advanced age and the extensive surgical procedures, there was no mortality and no neurological morbidity. All patients were asymptomatic or demonstrated objective improvement upon discharge from the hospital. In this subset of patients with spontaneous pyogenic vertebral osteomyelitis, the only predisposing factor was advanced age.\r"

  ".W": "Dysfunction of spinal motor conduction during surgical procedures may not be reflected by changes in somatosensory evoked potential waveforms. A method of monitoring that allows direct and continuous assessment of motor function within the central nervous system during surgery would be useful. This paper describes one such method utilizing noninvasive electric cortical stimulation to evoke muscle activity (the motor evoked potential, or MEP) during surgery. The effect of isoflurane (superimposed on a baseline of N2O/narcotic anesthesia) on MEP's in response to cortical stimulation is specifically examined. Eight patients undergoing elective neurosurgical operations were included in the study. All patients received a background of general anesthesia and partial nondepolarizing neuromuscular blockade. The motor cortex was stimulated electrically via self-adhesive scalp electrodes. Electromyographic responses from multiple muscles were measured with subdermal electroencephalograph-type needle electrodes. Motor responses to stimulation were continually recorded on magnetic tape for off-line analysis. Once closing of the surgical incision was begun, a series of four to five stimuli of constant magnitude were applied to obtain \"baseline\" MEP responses. Patients were then ventilated with isoflurane for up to 8 minutes, during which time stimuli were continued every 15 to 20 seconds. Comparison was made of MEP responses for trials before, 1 minute after, and 5 minutes after the addition of isoflurane. All patients demonstrated reproducible motor responses to cortical stimulation during surgery. Addition of isoflurane [isoflurane)exp, less than or equal to 0.5%) to pre-existing anesthesia caused marked attenuation of MEP amplitudes in all patients within 5 minutes of its application, without affecting neuromuscular transmission as judged by direct peripheral nerve stimulation. It is concluded that: 1) monitoring motor system integrity and function with electric transcranial cortical stimulation during surgery is feasible when utilizing an N2O/narcotic anesthetic protocol; and 2) the quality of data obtained will likely suffer with the addition of isoflurane.\r"

Patients treated with irradiation plus MOPP had a statistically significant increase in overall survival rate at 5 years posttreatment compared to patients treated with radiation therapy alone (74% vs. 56%; p = 0.06, adjusted for race and gender). Although the overall study failed to show a statistically significant advantage for irradiation plus MOPP in event-free survival (p = 0.18), statistical significance was attained in children 5 years of age or older (p = 0.05). More severe hematological toxicities occurred in the group with irradiation plus MOPP; however, this hematotoxicity appeared to be tolerable and acceptable. These results suggest that patients may benefit from combined irradiation and chemotherapy following surgery for medulloblastoma.\r"

  ".W": "The goal of this study was to assess the effects of the dorsal root entry zone (DREZ) lesioning procedure, microsurgical DREZ-otomy (MDT), on spinal cord somatosensory function based on peri- and intraoperative clinical and electrophysiological data. The study was performed prospectively on a series of 20 patients suffering from either chronic neurogenic pain or spasticity. Physiological observations were made of the intraoperative evoked electrospinographic recordings as collected from the surface of the spinal cord. The MDT procedure produced analgesia or severe hypalgesia, moderate hypesthesia, and only slight deficits in proprioception and cutaneous spatial discrimination on the body segments operated on. These clinical data correlated well with evoked electrospinographic recordings, which showed a moderate effect of MDT on presynaptic compound action potentials recorded from the spinal cord (N11 and N21), a partial or even reversible effect on the cortical postcentral N20 wave, a more marked effect on the postsynaptic dorsal horn waves N13 and N24 related to large primary afferent fibers, and a disappearance of dorsal horn waves related to finer afferents (N2 and possibly N3). These data provide evidence for an acceptably selective action of MDT on spinal cord nociceptive mechanisms, and for a partial, often slight, involvement of the other somatosensory domains. The presence of abnormal evoked electrospinographic waves is discussed in relation to the mechanisms of neurogenic pain and spasticity. The hypothesis of a \"retuning\" of the dorsal horn as the mode of action of MDT is presented.\r"

Two men and one woman, aged 26 to 37 years (mean 31 years), had onset of complex automatism and generalized seizures in their second and fourth decades (mean age 22.7 years). They had been epileptic for 6 to 14 years (mean 8.3 years) before surgery. Preoperative electroencephalograms localized ictal epileptic activity to the left mesial temporal lobe in all cases, and neuropsychological testing revealed dominant temporal lobe dysfunction. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging demonstrated an anteromedial basal temporal encephalocele extending into the pterygopalatine fossa through a bone defect at the base of the greater sphenoid wing in the region of the foramen rotundum and pterygoid process, a discrete center of embryonal chondrification. At surgery, the encephaloceles were found in front of the uncus, and an area of gliosis extended from the encephalocele to the amygdalohippocampal region. All patients have been seizure-free following anterior temporal resection and amygdalohippocampectomy including the encephalocele. These three cases delineate a condition of disordered embryogenesis wherein a developmental anterobasal temporal encephalocele acts as the substrate for temporal lobe epilepsy. This lesion may be diagnosed preoperatively with MR imaging and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of late-onset temporal lobe epilepsy.\r"

Because endothelin synthesis is regulated at the messenger ribonucleic acid transcription level, the effect of actinomycin D, a ribonucleic acid synthesis inhibitor, was studied as a means of preventing vasospasm. It was found that treatment with intravenous actinomycin D for 5 days beginning on the day of SAH completely inhibited the development of vasospasm.

Acute subdural hematoma was produced by the slow injection of 400 microliters homologous blood into the subdural space overlying the parietal cortex in halothane-anesthetized rats. Brain damage was assessed histologically in sections at multiple coronal planes in animals sacrificed 4 hours after induction of the subdural hematoma. Pretreatment with D-CPP-ene (15 mg/kg) significantly reduced the volume of ischemic brain damage produced by the subdural hematoma from 62 +/- 8 cu mm (mean +/- standard error of the mean) in vehicle-treated control rats to 29 +/- 7 cu mm in drug-treated animals. These data demonstrate the anti-ischemic efficacy of NMDA antagonists in an animal model of intracranial hemorrhage in which intracranial pressure is elevated, and suggest that excitotoxic mechanisms (which are susceptible to antagonism by D-CPP-ene) may play a role in the ischemic brain damage which is observed in patients who die after acute subdural hematoma.\r"

Groups of animals were examined by angiography on each of 9 days after the injections of blood. An angiogram was obtained 15 minutes after the first injection of blood, 20 seconds after the intra-arterial injection of a maximum dilating dose of papaverine. All surviving animals showed basilar artery narrowing, which was greatest 24 hours after the hemorrhage, when the vessel diameter was reduced to 54% of the control value. The narrowing then decreased to a reduction of about 30%, which was maintained throughout the rest of the study period. A papaverine-resistant component of narrowing was not seen until the 3rd day. It increased progressively to Day 9 when it represented 63% of the total. This model has a number of features that are reminiscent of human cerebrovasospasm, including the fact that there is an initial phase of narrowing that is completely reversed by an intra-arterially administered vasodilator, and a second phase beginning on Day 3 which exhibits a progressively increasing papaverine-resistant component.\r"

Brain and plasma samples were analyzed by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography to determine the tissue and plasma concentrations of dexamethasone. Measurement of the release kinetics of dexamethasone from the ethylene-vinyl acetate polymers in an in vitro system showed that the drug was released in a controlled, tapering fashion. During the first 3 days of controlled release in vitro, 330 micrograms of a total content of 7.5 mg of dexamethasone was released into the medium. Analysis of tissue for drug levels demonstrated, however, that the interstitial delivery of this fractional amount of dexamethasone within the brain resulted in levels 19 times higher than those achieved by administering the full dose of 7.5 mg systemically over a 3-day period. Conversely, the systemic administration of dexamethasone resulted in plasma levels 16 times higher than those measured in the interstitial delivery of dexamethasone in the brain. Brain-water content determinations showed that the interstitial controlled release of the fractional amount of dexamethasone within the brain was as effective in controlling peritumoral edema as systemic administration of the full dose by serial intraperitoneal injections. The study demonstrates the following: 1) controlled-release polymeric carriers deliver biologically active dexamethasone in a sustained fashion; 2) very high concentrations of dexamethasone in brain tissue can be achieved using interstitial polymer-mediated drug delivery while minimizing plasma concentrations of this drug which are sometimes associated with serious systemic side effects; and 3) peritumoral brain edema can be effectively treated by the interstitial delivery of dexamethasone directly within the tumor bed.\r"

A specific estramustine binding protein (EMBP) is important for its cytotoxic action, and the presence of EMBP has previously been demonstrated in rat and human prostatic cancer tissue. Significant levels of EMBP were detected by radioimmunoassay in human brain-tumor tissue. The EMBP concentrations (expressed as ng/mg protein) in 16 astrocytomas (mean 2.6 ng/mg, range 0.5 to 6.2 ng/mg) and seven meningiomas (mean 5.1 ng/mg, range 0.3 to 9.3 ng/mg) were significantly higher than that found in four samples of epileptic brain (mean 0.7 ng/mg, range 0.5 to 1 ng/mg) and 18 samples of normal brain (mean 0.5 ng/mg, range 0.2 to 1.0 ng/mg). The uptake, metabolism, and antiproliferative effects of the prostatic anticancer agent estramustine have been previously demonstrated in cultured glioma cells. The presence of EMBP may suggest a selective binding and effectiveness in human brain-tumor tissue.\r"

  ".W": "Microdialysis is used in vivo for measuring compounds in brain interstitial fluid. The authors describe another application of this technique to the central nervous system, namely microprobe dialysis in the cisterna magna to study the dynamics of ion transport and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) formation in the rat. The choroid plexus is the major source of CSF, which is produced by active transport of Na from blood into the cerebral ventricles. Formation of CSF is directly proportional to the blood-to-CSF transport of Na. By injecting 22Na into the systemic circulation and quantifying its movement into CSF by microdialysis, one can reliably estimate alterations in the rate of CSF formation. The sensitivity of this system was determined by administering acetazolamide, a standard inhibitor of CSF production. Because acetazolamide is known to decrease CSF formation by 40% to 50%, the cisternal microdialysis system in animals treated with this drug should detect a corresponding decrease in the amount of 22Na dialyzed. This hypothesis is supported by the 22Na uptake curves for control versus treated animals: that is, by the acetazolamide-induced average diminution of about 45% in both the rate and extent of tracer accession to dialysate. Bumetanide, a loop diuretic, reduced by 30% the 22Na entry into dialysate. Microprobe dialysis of fluid in the cisterna magna is thus a minimally invasive and economical method for evaluating effects of drugs and hormones on the choroid plexus-CSF system.\r"

  ".W": "Tumor cells are characterized by abnormalities in growth and metabolism, including the autocrine secretion of certain growth factors. The authors have previously shown the presence of insulin-like growth factor receptors in tumors of the central nervous system (CNS) and in this study examine whether CNS tumors are capable of autocrine secretion of insulin-like growth factors in situ. To investigate the production of insulin-like growth factors I and II by CNS tumors, the authors have developed specific radioimmunoassays for these growth factors. In situ production of insulin-like growth factors was studied by immunoassay of CNS tumor cyst fluid aspirated at the time of surgery from 12 cystic tumors: seven primary brain tumors, four metastatic tumors, and one spinal schwannoma. For immunoassay, cyst fluid was treated overnight with acetic acid, then insulin-like growth factors were separated from binding proteins by a refined solid-phase technique, then dried and reconstituted in immunoassay buffer. Normal human serum and cerebrospinal fluid served as controls. Insulin-like growth factor I was detected in all 12 tumors studied. In contrast, insulin-like growth factor II was detected only in three low-grade astrocytomas, the spinal schwannoma (which had the highest insulin-like growth factor II level of all tumors studied), and three metastatic lung cancers. These results suggest that CNS tumors may be capable of autocrine production of insulin-like growth factors in situ. Furthermore, there appears to be a difference in the type of insulin-like growth factors produced by different types of CNS tumors. Preferential production of insulin-like growth factors may be an important marker of tumor differentiation and useful as a diagnostic tool.\r"

They possess vital significance in the ultimate synthesis of cellular proteins. A silver colloid staining technique for demonstration of NOR-associated proteins (Ag-NOR's) was applied to paraffin-embedded sections from 128 varied brain tumors and to chromosomal preparations from cultured brain-tumor cells. There was a statistically significant difference in the mean number of Ag-NOR's per nucleus between low-grade tumors (1.98/nucleus) and high-grade tumors (2.95/nucleus). It is suggested that the mean number of Ag-NOR's may represent the proliferative potential of brain tumors. Furthermore, high-grade tumors usually showed relatively large Ag-NOR's in a scattered distribution. In chromosomal preparations, the cultured cells displayed five to 12 Ag-NOR's on acrocentric chromosomes. Five of eight cell lines examined demonstrated ectopic Ag-NOR's. This simple staining technique can be easily applied to routinely processed paraffin-embedded sections and will become a useful tool for quick estimation of the proliferative potential of human brain tumors.\r"

The rupture most likely resulted from a small portion of aneurysm neck which remained unclipped, thereby leaving an area of structural weakness in the arterial wall at the site of clipping. The area of structural weakness predisposed the artery to rupture upon the addition of transmural pressure induced by balloon inflation during transluminal angioplasty. Caution is advised when performing transluminal angioplasty in the region of aneurysm clipping since the vessel lumen \"recreated\" during the clipping procedure may contain some residual and structurally incomplete aneurysm neck in the vessel wall.\r"

More cholesterol, nitrogen, fat and energy were excreted in the ileostomy effluents when the subjects consumed a brewer's spent grain supplemented, high fiber diet than when they consumed a low fiber diet. No significant change was found in the daily net sterol excretion. The six subjects with low daily excretion of bile acids (less than 1000 mg/24 h) had increased cholesterol and net cholesterol and decreased bile acid excretion per day, and lowered serum LDL-cholesterol and apoprotein B levels after supplementation with brewer's spent grain. We propose that subjects with low daily bile acid excretion are suitable models for studying the effect of dietary changes on sterol excretion and serum lipid levels. Increased fecal cholesterol excretion is suggested to be the primary mechanism for the serum LDL-cholesterol lowering effect of brewer's spent grain.\r"

Some premature human infants have low liver activities of gamma-cystathionase and presumably require preformed cysteine or cystine. Growing animals tend to have higher liver gamma-cystathionase activity, which makes them unsuitable as models to study effects of CSH precursors. Because propargylglycine (PPG) inhibits gamma-cystathionase specifically, rats infused with PPG as part of a TPN regimen were evaluated as a potential model. Two groups of rats (120-160 g) were infused for 15 d with TPN regimens, one without and one with PPG (40 mumols/d). A third group received the TPN-control regimen, with methionine added at toxic levels. Propargylglycine treatment significantly decreased plasma cystine and taurine concentrations and significantly increased plasma cystathionine concentration without affecting methionine concentration. Propargylglycine treatment significantly decreased brain, muscle, liver, intestine and stomach glutathione concentration without affecting erythrocyte or heart glutathione concentrations. Electron microscopic examination showed no abnormalities in heart and kidney of PPG-treated rats. Hepatocyte glycogen was lower in TPN-fed controls than in orally fed rats and was further reduced in TPN-PPG-fed animals. Growing rats infused with low doses of PPG show promise as an animal model to study a number of important issues concerning human sulfur amino acid metabolism.\r"

Levels of immunoreactive EGF in all regions of the small intestine of Fischer rats were comparable to our previous measurements in Sprague-Dawley rats, and these levels were unaffected by diet. In contrast, the EGF levels in the colon of the Fischer rats were approximately fivefold greater than those of the Sprague-Dawley rats. These higher levels of immunoreactive EGF in the colon decreased 63% with the addition of 10% wheat bran to the diet (P less than 0.02).

With the higher intake, Se levels were elevated. More Se was retained from selenomethionine than from selenite. After separation of the labeled proteins, it was apparent that the higher tissue Se contents were mainly due to nonspecific incorporation into a large number of proteins. We observed no differences between the two chemical forms with regard to the formation of the specific selenoproteins. The 10-fold increase in the Se supply led to a relatively small rise in the levels of these compounds. The results indicate that after ingestion of normal amounts of selenite nearly all of the element is present in the specific selenoproteins. With increasing doses a part is also incorporated nonspecifically into numerous other proteins. In the case of selenomethionine, a part of the element follows the same metabolic pathways, but a percentage is also deposited directly and nonspecifically into proteins in place of methionine.\r"

Twenty-four male weanling rats were fed either Cu-adequate (8.0 mg/kg diet) or Cu-deficient (0.4 mg/kg diet) diets until 9 or 11 wk of age. Copper-deficient rats had increased mitochondrial:myofibrillar ratios compared with Cu-adequate rats. Mitochondria were vacuolated. Cristae seemed fragmented and matrix seemed translucent and they tended to distort the myofibrils. Glycogen granules and lipid droplets were more frequently observed in Cu-deficient rats. When the Cu-deficient rats were examined separately, the larger hearts in the older rats had smaller mitochondrial:myofibrillar ratios, but had larger myofibrillar volume densities. Valves from Cu-deficient rats had less connective tissue and seemed fragmented in areas. In 9-wk-old Cu-deficient rats, there was a negative correlation between heart: body weight ratios and bicuspid valve scores, whereas 11-wk-old rats demonstrated the same relationship for tricuspid valves with myofibril volume density. These results suggest that there are two components contributing to cardiac hypertrophy in copper deficient rats: 1) an enlarged mitochondrial area and 2) myofibrillar enlargement. Hematocrit values did not seem to be related to cardiac hypertrophy.\r"

Ascorbic acid, nonprotein sulfhydryl compounds, Fe+2 and total ionizable Fe were measured in luminal contents. Nonprotein sulfhydryl concentration was positively correlated with, and the best predictor of, Fe absorption in -Fe rats.\r"

During the 5 mo of feeding, 10 in vivo measurements of intracolonic pH were recorded on each rat with a flexible electrode. The pH ranged from 7.8 to 8.0 near the anus and declined to 7.4 to 7.5 at 12 cm from the anus. The mean percentages of dry matter in the contents of the colon, divided into three approximately equal segments, were as follows: proximal colon, 35; middle colon, 45; distal colon, 58. Ammonia concentrations in luminal fluid rose significantly with higher protein intake in the cecum, proximal colon and distal colon. The concentrations in the distal colon ranged from 39 to 74 mmol/L, depending upon protein intake. Thymidine incorporation by distal colon mucosal cells was higher in rats fed 32% of energy as protein and 48% of energy as fat compared with rats fed 8% of energy as protein and 12% as fat. The evidence suggests that increased intestinal cell proliferation in rats fed the high protein, high fat diet was due to greater concentrations of ammonia in the large intestine resulting from the high protein intake and greater concentrations of non-ionized ammonia resulting from the higher pH associated with increased fat intake. The actual determinations and calculations of ionized to non-ionized ammonia concentrations were compatible with the assumption that the large intestinal cells absorbed more ammonia at higher fat intakes.\r"

The zinc concentrations were chosen with the intention of simulating zinc-deficient, adequate and excess extracellular conditions. Basal medium had no effect on cell zinc, metallothionein (MT) or MTmRNA for up to 48 h but reduced delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (delta-ALA-D) activity to 75% of the initial level by 3 h. The addition of zinc at 16 or 48 mumols Zn/L during the initial 3 h of culture did not prevent the decrease in delta-ALA-D activity. Reintroducing zinc at concentrations of 16 or 48 mumols Zn/L to hepatocytes after the initial 3 h of culture in basal medium significantly increased cell zinc, MT and MTmRNA levels and fully restored delta-ALA-D activity by 24 h. Medium zinc had no apparent effect on membrane integrity assessed as leakage of lactate dehydrogenase activity into culture media or de novo protein synthesis as examined by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of 35S-labeled proteins. Hepatocytes cultured in basal medium resisted losses in cell zinc concentration even when EDTA and bovine serum albumin were present in culture medium. Kinetic experiments using 65Zn suggest hepatocytes maintain zinc concentrations by reducing zinc efflux. The ability of hepatocytes cultured in basal (1 mumol Zn/L) medium to maintain cell zinc content and some zinc-dependent functions underscores the difficulty of producing zinc deficiency in primary hepatocyte culture.\r"

At 6 mo, tissue taurine content was significantly greater in the monkeys supplemented with taurine, but by 12 mo, there was no longer a significant difference. Activities of enzymes involved in taurine biosynthesis did not differ between the groups at any age. There was no difference in biliary bile acid class composition between the groups, but the proportion of bile acids conjugated with taurine reflected the tissue taurine content (i.e., was significantly greater in monkeys supplemented with taurine at 6 mo). This difference also disappeared by 12 mo. These results indicate that dependence on dietary sources of taurine persists for at least the first 6 mo but declines by 12 mo. Thus, dietary taurine content is reflected in the tissue taurine content and proportion of bile acids conjugated with taurine in infant rhesus monkeys at least until 6 mo of age, but the body taurine status in animals 12 mo old or older is not an indicator of previous status.\r"

There was a significant (P less than 0.0001) dose-dependent increase in serum gastrin from 102 to 173 ng/L, with increasing calcium. No other significant changes in serum gastrin were noted with the dietary changes. A long-term change in the level of serum gastrin, caused by dietary modification, will influence the trophic effect that gastrin has on colonic mucosa as well as on colon carcinomas. We speculate that calcium supplementation, although slowing colonic proliferation, might have an undesirable effect on the growth of early undetected colonic tumors.\r"

Quantitative autogradiography using [6-14C]glucose measured CMRGlc at the level of individual structures. Digital image techniques created stereograms of brain energy consumption from the autoradiographs. These techniques provided information about CMRGlc throughout the brain. Rats given the ethanol liquid diet drank constantly throughout the day and night. Neuropathological examination of brain revealed no abnormalities from ethanol consumption. Acute ethanol administration to control rats produced a decrease in CMRGlc throughout the brain that was most prominent in structures concerning auditory, visual, memory and motor functions. Chronic ethanol consumption did not reduce CMRGlc to the same degree as acute ethanol intoxication; in fact, it affected only a few structures. The removal of ethanol from chronic ethanol-treated rats for a period of 18 h caused CMRGlc to rise above control values throughout the brain. However, there were no seizures or other evidence of brain dysfunction.\r"

Solutions simulating ileal fluid were delivered at 0.4 mL/min at 38 degrees C via cannulae inserted at the cecal-colonic junction. Effluents were collected by cannulae inserted in the anus. In the first experiment, perfusion with the control solution or with the control solution having 35 mmol/L NaCl replaced by equimolar amounts of ammonium acetate, ammonium chloride or sodium acetate showed that only ammonium-containing solutions caused histological damage, loss of mucus, and significant losses of carbohydrate and DNA (P less than 0.05). The losses of carbohydrate and DNA expressed in microgram.cm-1.30 min-1 were as follows: control, 13.4 and 1.0; ammonium acetate, 31.8 and 1.6; sodium acetate, 16.0 and 0.6; ammonium chloride, 24.1 and 1.3, respectively. In the second experiment, perfusion with control fluid containing 35 or 70 mmol/L ammonium acetate at pH 6.8, 7.4 or 8.0 increased carbohydrate and DNA losses into the effluents compared with the pretest period (P less than 0.05), without significant effects related to influent pH. These studies are consistent with the concept that the life span of colon cells is shortened by concentrations of ammonia found in the colon under normal conditions and that ammonia enhances cell proliferation in the colon mucosa.\r"

To establish whether the mutation affects ceruloplasmin (CP) gene expression, we analyzed the steady state levels of CP mRNA in mutant and normal animals at various stages of development and following administration of copper and zinc. In fetal and neonatal animals, the expression of the CP gene is unaltered by the mutation or the copper deficiency in the pups of mutant dams. Copper and zinc administration to 7-d-old pups caused a significant increase (35%) in CP mRNA in all genotypes. In the adults that had accumulated 600-700 micrograms/g dry wt of copper in the liver, the CP mRNA level was normal, but pregnancy produced two-to fourfold elevation of the mRNA in both normal and mutant females. These results suggest that the toxic milk mutation does not affect the regulation of the CP gene and that the gene is not responsive to copper deficiency, copper administration or copper excess in the liver.\r"

A 1.5-kb cDNA representing the thioesterase domain of porcine fatty acid synthase was isolated from a lambda gt 11 liver cDNA library. Northern analysis with total RNA extracted from adipose tissue, liver, heart, lung, kidney and intestine revealed a single major fatty acid synthase mRNA species of 8-9 kb. The amount of fatty acid synthase mRNA in hepatic tissue was 25% of the amount in adipose tissue, which suggests that the liver may be a significant site of fatty acid synthesis in the pig. Fatty acid synthase mRNA abundance was significantly reduced in the adipose tissue (P less than 0.01) and the liver (P less than 0.1) by chronic daily administration (60 micrograms/kg) of rpSt. In addition, increasing the amount of dietary protein decreased (P less than 0.1) the abundance of fatty acid synthase mRNA in adipose tissue but had no effect on liver fatty acid synthase expression. In contrast, the abundance of adipose fatty acid binding protein mRNA was unaffected by rpSt or dietary protein. These data indicate that the reduction in the level of fatty acid synthase mRNA is a factor in the pSt-mediated suppression of fatty acid synthesis in porcine adipose tissue.\r"

Diabetes-prone BB rats that were pan-T(OX19+)-lymphopenic were fed a low diabetogenic diet during gestation and lactation. Progeny of these rats were fed a normal or autoclaved NIH-07 diet, or one of eight other diets based on the AIN-76A formulation, with modified protein sources as follows: hydrolyzed casein (HC), soybean meal, HC+ trypsin inhibitor (TI) in water (2 mg/mL, wheat germ, alfalfa seeds, Brewer's yeast, red lentils and a plant protein mixture. Feeding soybean meal increased the incidence of diabetes compared with the negative control, HC diet (47% vs. 12% incidence, P = 0.02). Wheat germ, alfalfa seeds and plant protein mixture resulted in an intermediate incidence of diabetes of 33%; the incidence was lower for Brewer's yeast and lentils (20% and 13%). Autoclaving (121 degrees C, 10 min) the NIH-07 diet or the presence of TI in drinking water had a minimal effect on diabetes frequency, suggesting heat-labile plant toxicants were not directly involved. Thus, certain dietary plant protein sources or associated agents may influence the development of spontaneous diabetes in the BB rat.\r"

Pindolol (200 micrograms/kg/day) was administered for either 23 or 30 days, beginning 1 week after, or the day of initial surgery, respectively. Coronary flow was measured, at day 30, using radioactive microspheres, during base-line and adenosine infusion (0.4 mg/kg/min) in anesthetized open-chest preparations. Heart weight of untreated 1K1C animals (9.13 +/- 0.73 g) was significantly greater than the controls (7.19 +/- 0.77 g). Myocardial mass of 1K1C (9.93 +/- 0.86 g) and sham controls (7.40 +/- 0.31 g) were unaffected by chronic pindolol for 23 days. Cardiac hypertrophy was prevented in 1K1C animals treated with pindolol for 30 days (7.53 +/- 1.28 g). Untreated 1K1C animals were hypertensive compared to sham controls (116 +/- 12 and 78 +/- 7 mm Hg) and neither pindolol regime affected blood pressure. Bradycardia was evident in all pindolol-treated animals. Base-line coronary flow was higher in the untreated 1K1C animals compared to untreated controls (228 +/- 43 vs. 182 +/- 31 ml/min/100 g). After chronic pindolol treatments, 1K1C base-line blood flows were reduced (158 +/- 48 and 175 +/- 59 ml/min/100 g, for 23- and 30-day protocols). Adenosine vasodilated flows were not different between the untreated 1K1C and sham animals and were not affected by pindolol treatment. Therefore, hypertension and cardiac hypertrophy were dissociable in this model when pindolol was administered from the onset of hypertension. This suggests immediate involvement of beta adrenergic activation in the development of hypertrophy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The pharmacological selectivity of the liver (+)-[3H]SKF-10,047 binding sites corresponds to that of sigma sites from rat and guinea pig brain. When the affinities of 18 different drugs at (+)-[3H]SKF-10,047 binding sites in membranes and solubilized preparations were compared, a correlation coefficient of 0.99 and a slope of 1.03 were obtained, indicating that the pharmacological selectivity of rat liver sigma sites is retained after solubilization. In addition, the binding of 20 nM [3H]progesterone to solubilized rat liver preparations was found to exhibit a pharmacological selectivity appropriate for sigma sites. A stimulatory effect of phenytoin on (+)-[3H]SKF-10,047 binding to sigma sites persisted after solubilization. When the solubilized preparation was subjected to molecular sizing chromatography, a single peak exhibiting specific (+)-[3H]SKF-10,047 binding was obtained. The binding activity of this peak was stimulated symmetrically when assays were performed in the presence of 300 microM phenytoin. The molecular weight of the CHAPS-solubilized sigma site complex was estimated to be 450,000 daltons. After solubilization with CHAPS, rat liver sigma sites were enriched to 12 pmol/mg of protein. The present results demonstrate a successful solubilization of sigma sites from rat liver membranes and provide direct evidence that the gonadal steroid progesterone binds to sigma sites. The results also suggest that the anticonvulsant phenytoin binds to an associated allosteric site on the sigma site complex.\r"

The sensitivity to ET-1 was significantly higher in 12-week-old spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) than in age-matched Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats. In contrast, the sensitivity was not different between SHR and WKY rats at 6 weeks of age, which was close to that of 12-week-old SHR. Receptor binding study in microsomal preparations of the aortas with [125I]ET-1 showed that maximum binding value for ET-1 receptor in 12-week-old SHR was only 1.5-fold greater than that in WKY rats and that there was no significant difference in the Kd values. K(+)-depolarization induced vasoconstrictive responses that were also augmented in 12-week-old SHR. Resting membrane potential of the aorta was significantly depolarized in tissues from 12-week-old SHR compared with age-matched WKY rats. The resting membrane potentials were similar in the aorta from 6-week-old SHR and WKY rats, and were between those of 12-week-old SHR and WKY rats. When the aortic strips from 12-week-old WKY rats were partially depolarized in high K(+)-solution or in the presence of ouabain (0.1 mM), the vasoconstrictor effect of ET-1 became similar to that on the strips from SHR in a normal solution. These results suggest that, although age-dependent changes appear to be complicated, the lower resting membrane potential may account considerably for the larger sensitivity to ET-1 in the aorta from 12-week-old SHR than that from age-matched WKY rats.\r"

Since staurosporine has been reported to induce differentiation in human neuroblastoma cells in vitro, we studied the effects of staurosporine on the amnesia induced by basal forebrain-lesion in rats. Staurosporine (0.05 and 0.1 mg/kg intraperitoneal) attenuated the impaired performance of water maze and passive avoidance tasks, even though the drug administration began 2 weeks after the lesion. Moreover, staurosporine (0.1 mg/kg) partially reversed the decrease of choline acetyltransferase activity in the fronto-parietal cortex induced by basal forebrain-lesion. These results suggest that staurosporine attenuates impairment of learning through reversal of damage to cholinergic neurons induced by basal forebrain-lesion. This evidence indicates that neurotrophic factor-like substances may be used in novel therapeutic approaches to Alzheimer's disease.\r"

  ".W": "Dopamine D2 receptors are known to regulate the release of catecholamines from neurons in the central and peripheral nervous systems. In the present study we have evaluated the effects of dopamine D2 agonists and antagonists on the release of endogenous norepinephrine and epinephrine stimulated by 50 microM nicotine in isolated bovine chromaffin cells in order to investigate whether isolated bovine chromaffin cells may contain functional dopamine D2 receptors. Dopamine (10(-4) and 10(-6) M), quinpirole (10(-5) M) and 2-amino-5,6-dihydroxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalene hydrobromide (10(-5) M) had no effect on the nicotine-stimulated release of norepinephrine or epinephrine from the bovine chromaffin cells. Pergolide (10(-6) M) and apomorphine (10(-4) M) produced a significant inhibition of nicotine-stimulated release of both norepinephrine and epinephrine from the chromaffin cells. The inhibitory effect of the selective dopamine D2 agonist pergolide on catecholamine release from the chromaffin cells was not reversed by 10(-6) M concentrations of the selective dopamine D2 receptor antagonists haloperidol, domperidone, metaclopramide, fluphenazine, flupentixol, (+)- or (-)-sulpiride, the dopamine D1 receptor antagonist SCH 23390 (10(-7) M) or the alpha receptor antagonist phentolamine (10(-6) M). These data suggest that the inhibition of nicotine-stimulated release of catecholamines from the bovine chromaffin cells is not a receptor-mediated effect. Further studies showed that the inhibitory effect of pergolide on catecholamine release in the bovine chromaffin cells was correlated with an inhibition of nicotine-stimulated 45Ca++ uptake and 22Na+ uptake into these cells. It is concluded that functional dopamine D2 receptors of the classical type do not exist on isolated bovine chromaffin cells.\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies have reported that maximally effective concentrations of the \"mixed\" alpha and beta adrenoceptor agonists, epinephrine and norepinephrine, cause greater amounts of mucin secretion than the \"pure\" beta adrenoceptor agonist, isoproterenol, and that this response requires extracellular calcium. The purpose of the present study was to examine directly the nature of the effect of the putative pure alpha adrenoceptor agonist, phenylephrine, on isoproterenol-induced mucin secretion and the role of extracellular calcium in this interaction. We used a graphical method which provides a procedure for determining whether interaction between two drugs is additive, antagonistic or synergistic to analyze this interaction. Submandibular glands were removed from male rats, divided into sections and placed in modified Hank's balanced salt solution. Mucin secretion was measured as acid precipitable disintegrations per minute after labeling the submandibular gland with [14C]glucosamine. Phenylephrine caused a small but significant secretion of mucin which was blocked partially by phentolamine and completely by propranolol. Phenylephrine caused a significant shift of the isoproterenol concentration-response curve to the left of the theoretical curve expected if two drugs act additively. Mucin secretion induced by isoproterenol alone was independent of extracellular calcium concentration; however, the combination of isoproterenol and phenylephrine caused a concentration-dependency on extracellular calcium.\r"

Serum levels of insulin were not significantly affected at 30 and 60 min after i.t. morphine, but plasma glucagon levels were significantly increased at both time points. Rectal temperature decreased significantly in mice given either saline or morphine i.t., but there was no significant difference between the two groups over time. Atropine (2 mg/kg), propranolol (10 mg/kg), prazosin (2 mg/kg) and methysergide (2 mg/kg) did not affect morphine-induced hypoglycemia. Naloxone (20 mg/kg) antagonized i.t. morphine. Mecamylamine (2 mg/kg) produced a moderate hypoglycemia in control mice, which appeared to be additive to that caused by i.t. morphine. Yohimbine (1-4 mg/kg i.p.) also produced a moderate hypoglycemia in control mice, but caused a dose-related antagonism of i.t. morphine.

Membranes exhibited specific enzymatic markers such as 5'-nucleotidase, Ca++,Mg(++)-adenosine triphosphatase and an ATP-dependent calcium uptake. Baboon skeletal microsomes bound specifically with high-affinity potent Ca++ channel blockers such as dihydropyridine, phenylalkylamine and benzothiazepine derivatives. Scatchard analysis of equilibrium binding assays with [3H](+)-PN 200-110, [3H](-)-desmethoxyverapamil [( 3H](-)-D888) and [3H]-d-cis-dilitiazem were consistent with a single class of binding sites for the three radioligands. The pharmacological profile of SR 33557, an original compound with calcium antagonist properties, was investigated using radioligand binding studies. SR 33557 totally inhibited the specific binding of the three main classes of Ca++ channel effectors and interacted allosterically with them. In addition, SR 33557 bound with high affinity to a homogeneous population of binding sites in baboon skeletal muscle.\r"

  ".W": "The gastric effect of bombesin, a homolog of the mammalian peptide found in breast milk, was studied in suckling, weanling and adult rats (11, 30 and 90 days old, respectively). Control gastric emptying was not different in the three age groups. When bombesin was given orogastrically in a saline vehicle, 30 min before a nonabsorbable radiolabeled marker (used to assess gastric emptying), a significant and dose-related inhibitory effect was observed in sucklings. In contrast to the data with orogastric peptide in saline, when bombesin was given orogastrically in rat milk 30 min before the marker, there was no effect on gastric emptying in sucklings. Inhibition of gastric emptying was again demonstrated in the sucklings when bombesin (0.6-30 micrograms) was given with an artificial rat milk substitute 30 min before the marker. In contrast, orogastric bombesin in rat milk or rat milk substitute had no effect on gastric emptying in weanlings or adults. While s.c. bombesin in saline did not alter gastric emptying in sucklings, s.c. administration of the peptide produced a significant and dose-related increase in gastric emptying in both weanlings and adults. These results support the concept that milk-borne peptides, such as gastrin releasing peptide, may be involved in regulation of gastric function in suckling rats.\r"

Here, we present N-(p-isothiocyanatophenethyl)spiperone (NIPS), a novel and highly selective irreversible inactivator of D2 but not D1 receptors. In in vitro studies, NIPS exhibited an apparent Ki of 10 nM for [3H]methylspiperone binding to D2 receptors in rat striatum. Preincubation of the striatal membranes with NIPS followed by extensive washing resulted in up to an 80% reduction of the D2 receptor maximum binding (Bmax). Coincubation with the D2 receptor antagonist domperidone could protect against this reduction. NIPS was additionally shown to irreversibly inactivate D2 receptor binding activity in cultured cells expressing the D2 receptor protein. In in vivo administration studies, using [3H]SCH 23390 and [3H]spiperone to assay D1 and D2 receptors in vitro, 24 hr after injection (s.c.) with 5 to 40 mg/kg of NIPS D2 receptor, Bmax was decreased by 58 to 76%, without a change in D2 receptor affinity. In contrast, there was no effect on D1 receptor Bmax or affinity. There was also a small (24%) reduction in frontal cortex 5-hydroxytryptamine2 receptors by 20 mg/kg of NIPS. However, there was no effect on alpha-1 or alpha-2 adrenergic receptors in the frontal cortex, or on muscarinic cholinergic or 5-hydroxytryptamine1A receptors in the hippocampus. After single doses of either 20 mg/kg of NIPS or 10 mg/kg of EEDQ, the D2 receptor recovery rate was much slower after NIPS (half-time of receptor recovery = 170 hr) than after EEDQ (half-time of receptor recovery = 76.7 hr).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

These peptides inhibit synthesis of platelet-activating factor and release of arachidonic acid from neutrophils and macrophages stimulated by phagocytosis or tumor necrosis factor. Antiflammins containing methionine are inactivated readily in the absence of reducing agents. Novel antiflammins containing alanine or norleucine in place of methionine are inhibitory without added reducing agents, but only when stock solutions are heated to 45 degrees C. Heating may favor hydrophobic interactions between peptide molecules, thereby activating the antiflammins. These peptides are less inhibitory when added after cell stimulation, suggesting that they interfere with the activation of phospholipase A2.\r"

  ".W": "[3H]Bradykinin (BDK) binds to two distinct binding sites (P less than .01, N = 12) in NG108-15 cell membranes; (site 1: Kd1 = 3.09 x 10(-10) M, Bmax1 = 242 +/- 24 fmol/mg protein) and (site 2: Kd2 = 1.94 x 10(-8) M, Bmax2 = 491 +/- 75 fmol/mg protein). Although site 1 comprises only 33 +/- 4% (N = 12) of the total binding site population, comparison of the binding affinity and functional potency for BDK agonist analogs exhibiting differential selectivity for the two sites reveals that this high affinity site is the receptor mediating inositol monophosphate (IP) production in this cell line. BDK-stimulated IP production undergoes a very rapid (5 min) desensitization that is characterized by both a loss in agonist potency (EC50 = 3.57 x 10(-9) M vs. 1.94 x 10(-10) M in controls; P less than .001, N = 12) and a decrease in amplitude of response (fold stimulation = 1.45 +/- 0.06 vs. 1.80 +/- 0.09 in controls; P less than .01, N = 12). Only the decrease in response amplitude is attenuated by down-regulation of protein kinase C by prior long term treatment of the cells with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA), indicating an involvement of protein kinase C activation in the desensitization process. Desensitization is accompanied by down-regulation of site 1 only (Bmax1 = 71 +/- 8 fmol/mg (N = 10; P less than .001 vs. controls)); Bmax2 and the Kd for BDK at both sites remain unchanged, further supporting the contention that site 1 is the functionally relevant receptor. In contrast to the functional data, long term TPA treatment does not attenuate the receptor down-regulation, indicating that the rapid desensitization involves both receptor-related and postreceptor mechanisms. The implications of this property of the BDK receptor for analog design and receptor classification are discussed.\r"

They filled out subjective effects questionnaires, ingested a capsule and then were free to leave. They also filled out questionnaires 1, 3 and 6 hr after leaving. During the first four sessions the drugs were identified to the subject before ingestion by letter code. During the next seven sessions the procedure was the same except the capsules were not identified to the subject. Six hours after receiving the capsule, subjects telephoned the experimenter to report their identification. When correct, they received a monetary bonus. If the identification was correct on five of the seven sessions, subjects entered the third phase. This phase had six additional training sessions as described previously. During the other six sessions that were intermixed, subjects received capsules that contained test drugs. Sixteen of 18 subjects learned the discrimination and 14 entered the third phase. They identified 2 mg of DZ, 1 mg of lorazepam and 10 mg of d-amphetamine as placebo and 2 mg of lorazepam as 10 mg of DZ. Over half of the subjects identified 5 mg of DZ and 50 mg of pentobarbital as 10 mg of DZ. DZ (10 mg) produced significant time-related changes on several subjective effect measures and these effects were typical of those produced by sedative-like drugs. The subjective effects of the test compounds were largely correlated with the drug identification. These results indicate that 10 mg of DZ can function as a discriminative stimulus in humans and this discrimination is dose-related and pharmacologically specific.\r"

The present study reports the effect of cocaine on the isolated coronary artery. Ring segments were prepared from the porcine left anterior descending coronary artery and suspended in tissue baths under isometric conditions. Cocaine was ineffective by itself in promoting contraction, but a cumulative concentration-response curve was obtained in the presence of DL-propranolol (1.3 x 10(-6) M); D-propranolol failed to promote cocaine-induced vasoconstriction. The maximum contractile response to cocaine was one-third of the response to histamine and was in the same range as the response to U46619, prostaglandin F2 alpha and norepinephrine. Phenylephrine had a weak effect. In the presence of DL-propranolol, the vasoconstrictive effect of cocaine was subject to rapid tachyphylaxis. Prazosin (5 x 10(-9) M), also in the presence of DL-propranolol, significantly displaced the cocaine concentration-response curve to the right and diminished contractile force by one-half. We conclude that cocaine-induced coronary vasoconstriction elicited in the presence of DL-propranolol can be mediated through local adrenergic mechanisms involving beta receptor antagonism and activation of both alpha-1 and alpha-2 adrenoceptors.\r"

  ".W": "This study was undertaken to determine whether the variation in the affinity of the alpha-1 adrenoceptors previously found for norepinephrine and phenylephrine in different arteries is also seen with other alpha-1 adrenoceptor agonists, and if so, if one part of the structure is particularly responsible for the variation. The potency and dissociation constants of eight agonists, both phenylethylamines and imidazolines, were determined in five rabbit arteries. In each artery the rank order of phenylethylamine agonist potency was epinephrine greater than norepinephrine greater than phenylephrine greater than deoxyepinephrine greater than methoxamine greater than dopamine. The same rank order of dissociation constants was found. For the imidazolines, the potency order was oxymetazoline greater than clonidine. For each agonist, there was a linear correlation between artery sensitivity and receptor affinity. None of the regression line slopes differed from each other. For each artery there was a linear correlation between phenylethylamine sensitivity and affinity. With the exception of the ovarian, which was lower, slopes of the regression lines in each group do not differ from each other. There were differences in the spread of the dissociation constants of the phenylethylamine derivatives among the arteries. The range of affinities was most marked with norepinephrine (greater than 40-fold) and least with epinephrine (approximately 4-fold). They suggest that agonist affinity governs the biological activity of at least the phenylethylamines on rabbit arteries mediated by the alpha-1 adrenoceptor. Variation in agonist affinity can explain the extent of the biological response. Differences in range of amine affinities in different arteries suggest that the agonist recognition site, although similar in the different arteries, is not identical and may be related particularly to some variation of the amine attachment site of the molecule. The results provide further support for the variable receptor affinity hypothesis.\r"

In this study we demonstrate that antibodies purified from the sera of rabbits sensitized to a trifluoroacetyl-protein adduct will cross-react with a trifluoroacetyl-phosphatidylethanolamine adduct. Trifluoroacetyl adducts of both rabbit serum albumin (TFA-RSA) and dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine (TFA-DOPE) were prepared. The TFA-RSA was coupled to an Affigel-10 affinity column to purify hapten-selective immunoglobulin (Ig) G antibodies (anti-TFA-RSA IgG) from the sera of rabbits given i.m. injections of TFA-RSA. The TFA-DOPE was purified by high-performance liquid chromatography and the structure confirmed with direct chemical ionization mass spectrometry. Lamellar liposomes containing a mixture of 5% TFA-DOPE, 71% DOPE and 24% dioleoyl-phosphatidylcholine, as well as hexagonal phase micelles containing 5% TFA-DOPE and 95% DOPE, were prepared by sonication. Anti-TFA-RSA IgG antibodies were added to each of these lipid mixtures for 30 min, fluorescein-conjugated goat-antirabbit IgG antibodies were added next for an additional 30 min and then binding of anti-TFA-RSA IgG antibodies to TFA-DOPE was quantified by flow cytometry. Anti-TFA-RSA IgG antibodies bound to TFA-DOPE only when it was incorporated into hexagonal phase micelles. These findings suggest that TFA-phosphatidylethanolamine adducts that reside in nonlamellar domains on the hepatocyte surface could be recognition sites for anti-TFA-adduct antibodies and potentially participate in immune-mediated hepatotoxicity.\r"

  ".W": "Withdrawal seizure prone (WSP) and withdrawal seizure resistant (WRS) mice were genetically selected to express severe or mild handling-induced convulsions (HIC), respectively, after cessation of chronic ethanol (EtOH) vapor inhalation. The studies reported here tested WSP and WSR mice to determine whether elevated HIC were seen after administration of acute doses of several drugs that depress central nervous system activity. The drugs tested were EtOH, pentobarbital, t-butanol, acetaldehyde, and diazepam. All drugs initially suppressed HIC in WSP mice. This suppression was followed by an exacerbation of HIC, suggestive of a state of rebound central nervous system hyperexcitability during acute withdrawal. Susceptibility to acute withdrawal seizures was clearly under genetic control, since WSR mice did not display acute withdrawal HIC to any appreciable extent. Acute EtOH withdrawal seizures did not require testing WSP mice repeatedly, as they could be seen upon a single HIC test 8 hr after EtOH injection. Results with acetaldehyde and t-butanol suggest that the formation of acetaldehyde may be sufficient, but is not necessary for the elicitation of acute EtOH withdrawal. Earlier studies had found that WSP mice displayed more severe withdrawal HIC than WSR mice after chronic treatment with t-butanol, phenobarbital, nitrous oxide, or diazepam. The genetic predisposition to chronic EtOH withdrawal HIC in WSP mice generalized to all central nervous system depressants acutely tested, suggesting that acute and chronic withdrawal to all these drugs is largely under the control of a common group of genes.\r"

Pretreatment with the receptor-inactivating agent N-ethoxycarbonyl-2-ethoxy-1,2-dihydroquinoline (1 and 2 x 6 mg/kg) progressively shifted the dose-response curve for NPA to the right, but PRL secretion was still maximally inhibited. Receptor inactivation elicited smaller (2-fold) dextral shifts in the ED50 for the partial agonists (+)- and (-)-3-(3-hydroxyphenyl)-N-n-propylpiperidine. These results are consistent with the presence of a sizable receptor reserve at the D2 receptor regulating PRL release in the anterior pituitary. Analogous results were obtained in vitro utilizing primary cultures of anterior pituitary cells. NPA potently inhibited basal PRL release in culture (ED50 0.06 nM, maximal inhibition 83%). Receptor alkylation with phenoxybenzamine (1 microM, 1 hr) did not affect basal PRL release but right-shifted the ED50 for NPA more than 6-fold and attenuated maximal inhibition (to 68%); both effects were significant (P less than .01). The extracellular accumulation of cyclic AMP (cAMP) stimulated by a combination of forskolin (1 microM) and 3-isobutyl-1-methyl xanthine (100 microM) required higher concentrations of NPA (ED50 0.36 nM), and the maximal effect was much smaller (46%). Phenoxybenzamine treatment did not alter either basal or forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation, but it reduced the maximal inhibitory response to NPA (to 13%) without shifting the ED50. Plots of receptor occupancy vs. response demonstrated a 60% receptor reserve for NPA inhibition of PRL release, but none for inhibition of cAMP production.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "In this study naltrindole (NTI) and its benzofuran derivative (NTB) were studied for their antagonist activity against various delta opioid receptor agonists in the tail-flick antinociceptive assay in mice. The antinociceptive ED50 of i.c.v. administered DSLET [(D-Ser2, Leu5, Thr6)enkephalin] was shifted about 4-fold by either s.c. NTB or i.c.v. NTI injection. On the other hand, the antinociceptive ED50 of i.c.v. administered DPDPE [(D-Pen2,D-Pen5)enkephalin] was shifted 1.4- and 1.8-fold with s.c. NTB and i.c.v. NTI administration, respectively, which were significantly lower than the shifts observed with DSLET. NTB did not alter the antinociceptive action of i.c.v. administered [(D-Ala2,D-Leu5)enkephalin], morphine sulfate, [(D-Ala2,MePhe4,Gly-ol5)enkephalin] or U-50,488H (trans(+/-)-3,4-dichloro-N-methyl-N-[2-(1-pyrrolidinyl) cyclohexyl]benzeneacetamide). At spinal sites, the antinociceptive ED50 of intrathecal (i.t.) administered DSLET was increased by 12.5-fold by s.c. NTB injection, whereas that of DPDPE was unaffected. NTB injection at this site also did not alter the antinociceptive action of i.t. administered [D-Ala2, D-Leu5]enkephalin, [(D-Ala2,MePhe4,Gly-ol5)enkephalin] or morphine sulfate. Pretreatment of animals with beta-funaltrexamine caused a large increase in the capacity of NTB to antagonize the antinociceptive activity of i.t. administered DSLET with little change in that of i.t. administered DPDPE. When cross-tolerance between DSLET and DPDPE was studied by i.c.v. injection of a single large dose of either DSLET or DPDPE 24 hr before the antinociceptive assay, there was no development of cross-tolerance between the two peptides. Based on these results, it was concluded that the antinociceptive action of DSLET and DPDPE may be mediated by different receptors, possibly delta opioid subtypes.\r"

  ".U": "91237556\r", 
  ".W": "This study utilized quantitative receptor autoradiography to examine the effects of repeated administration of antidepressants to rats on the binding of the beta adrenoceptor antagonist, 125I-iodopindolol (125I-IPIN) to either beta-1 or beta-2 adrenoceptors in various regions of brain. Antidepressants were selected to represent various chemical and pharmacological classes including tricyclic compounds (desipramine and protriptyline), monoamine oxidase inhibitors (clorgyline, phenelzine and tranylcypromine), atypical antidepressants (mianserin and trazodone) and selective inhibitors of the uptake of serotonin (citalopram and sertraline). Additionally, rats were treated with various psychotropic drugs that lack antidepressant efficacy (cocaine, deprenyl, diazepam and haloperidol). Repeated treatment of rats with desipramine, protriptyline, clorgyline, phenelzine, tranylcypromine or mianserin reduced the binding of 125I-IPIN to beta-1 adrenoceptors in many brain areas. Only in the basolateral and lateral nuclei of the amygdala did all six of these antidepressants significantly reduce 125I-IPIN binding to beta-1 adrenoceptors. In these amygdaloid nuclei, the magnitude of the reduction in the binding of 125I-IPIN caused by each of these drugs was comparable to or greater than the reduction in binding produced in any other region of brain. Reductions of binding of 125I-IPIN after antidepressant treatments were not consistently observed in the cortex, the area of brain examined most often in homogenate binding studies. Only the monoamine oxidase inhibitors caused reductions in the binding of 125I-IPIN to beta-2 adrenoceptors, and this effect was generally localized to the amygdala and hypothalamus. Repeated treatment of rats with citalopram, sertraline, or trazodone or with drugs lacking clinical antidepressant efficacy caused no significant effects on the binding of 125I-IPIN to either subtype of beta adrenoceptor in any region of brain. These results demonstrate that amygdaloid beta-1 adrenoceptors are particularly susceptible to regulation by certain antidepressant treatments and implicate the amygdala as an important site of action for antidepressants with pharmacological activity on noradrenergic neurons.\r"

  ".W": "In the present study we observed pronounced differences in the capacity of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) to induce dopaminergic neurotoxicity in several strains of mice. For example, there was no MPTP-induced decrement in neostriatal dopamine content in Ace Swiss-Webster mice and a 92% decrement in Taconic Farms C57 bl mice. Several parameters which could possibly explain this differential sensitivity to MPTP were studied. These include: 1) neostriatal monoamine oxidase-B (MAO-B) activity; 2) the capacity of neostriatal synaptosomes prepared from the mouse strains to accumulate 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+), the major metabolite of MPTP formed via oxidation by MAO-B; and 3) the neostriatal MPP+ content after MPTP administration to the mice. There were no significant differences in the Km values for MAO-B in the neostriatum among the strains of mice examined. Neostriatal Vmax values for MAO-B differed somewhat among the strains, with a low of 2915 +/- 172 nmol/g of tissue per hr (CD-1 mice from Charles River) and a high of 3884 +/- 203 nmol/g of tissue per hr (C57 bl mice from Taconic Farms). However, Vmax values for MAO-B in the mouse strains did not correlate significantly with the relative sensitivity of the strains to MPTP. There were no significant differences in the capacity of neostriatal synaptosomes prepared from the mouse strains to accumulate MPP+. Studies on the metabolism of MPTP after peripheral administration revealed that there was a significant (P less than .01) positive correlation between the relative sensitivity of the mouse strains to MPTP and their neostriatal MPP+ content after MPTP administration.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

All three peptidoleukotrienes elicited their responses in the presence of amiloride (10 microM) and were inhibited by serosal addition of the NaCl cotransport inhibitors bumetanide (100 microM) and furosemide (1 mM). The effects of the peptidoleukotrienes on Isc and transepithelial conductance were concentration-dependent with maximal effects occurring at 10 microM. Half-maximal effects were produced at 30 nM for LTC4, 50 nM for LTD4 and 450 nM for LTE4. The secretory responses to both LTD4 and LTE4 were antagonized in a concentration-dependent manner by the LTD4/LTE4 receptor antagonist, SK&F 104353 (2(S)-hydroxy-3-(R)-[(2-carboxyethyl)thio]-3-[2-(8 phenyloctyl)phenyl]propanoic acid). Complete inhibition of the LTD4 and LTE4 effects were observed at 0.1 microM SK&F 104353 and half-maximal effects were achieved at 0.6 nM SK&F 104353. At 10 microM SK&F 104353 only 50% inhibition of the LTC4-induced increase in Isc was observed. These results suggest the peptidoleukotrienes stimulate colonic Cl- secretion by receptor-mediated mechanisms and that receptors for LTC4 are distinct from those mediating the action of LTD4/LTE4.\r"

Male, Sprague-Dawley rats were trained to discriminate 10 mg/kg of cocaine HCI from saline in a two-lever discrimination procedure. Inhibitors of catecholamine and serotonin reuptake (GBR 12909, WIN 35,428 and mazindol), d-amphetamine, and the nonselective dopamine agonist, apomorphine, produced dose-dependent increases in cocaine-appropriate responding and fully substituted for cocaine. Cocaine methiodide, a charged, quaternary cocaine analog, did not substitute for cocaine. Neither pentobarbital, haloperidol nor SCH 23390 produced cocaine-like behavioral activity. Both D1- and D2-selective agonists with diverse structures partially substituted for cocaine, producing from 40 to 80% cocaine-appropriate responses. The D1 agonists studied were SKF 38393 and stereoisomers, SKF 75670 and CY 208-243. Dihydrexidine, a full D1 agonist for induction of adenylate cyclase activity, also only partially substituted for cocaine. The peripherally acting D1 agonist, fenoldopam, produced predominantly saline-appropriate responding that was unrelated to dose. The D2 agonists tested were pergolide, quinpirole, (-)-NPA, RU 24213, N-0434 and N-0437. The D2 antagonist haloperidol did not block the discriminative stimulus effects of cocaine. In contrast, the D1 antagonist SCH 23390 reduced the discriminative stimulus effects of cocaine by a maximum of 50%. These results suggest that both D1 and D2 receptors may play a role in the discriminative stimulus effects of cocaine but that stimulation of either dopamine receptor subtype alone is not sufficient.\r"

  ".W": "Incubation of the antiandrogen nilutamide with rat liver microsomes and NADPH, under anaerobic conditions, led to the formation of the nitro anion free radical, as indicated by electron spin resonance spectroscopy. The steady-state concentration of the nitro anion free radical was not decreased by SKF 525-A, carbon monoxide or metyrapone (3 inhibitors of cytochrome P-450) but was decreased by NADP+ or p-chloromercuribenzoate (2 inhibitors of NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase). Under aerobic conditions, the nitro anion free radical was reoxidized by oxygen, and the electron spin resonance signal was not detected. This redox cycle was associated with NADPH oxidation, consumption of oxygen, and formation of superoxide anion, hydrogen peroxide and glutathione disulfide. Under anaerobic conditions, nilutamide was further reduced to chemically reactive metabolites. Anaerobic incubation of [3H]nilutamide (0.1 mM) with rat liver microsomes and a NADPH-generating system resulted in the in vitro covalent binding of [3H]nilutamide metabolites to microsomal proteins; covalent binding required NADPH; it was decreased in the presence of NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase inhibitors (methylene blue, 2'-adenosine monophosphate) or in the presence of the nucleophile glutathione, but was unaffected by cytochrome P-450 inhibitors (SKF 525-A, CO). Covalent binding was decreased markedly under aerobic conditions. We conclude that nilutamide is reduced by microsomal NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase into a nitro anion free radical. In the presence of oxygen, this nitro anion free radical undergoes redox cycling with oxygen, and forms reactive oxygen species. In anaerobiosis, it is reduced further to covalent binding species.\r"

In the drug discrimination study, small doses of (+)-MK-801 occasioned saline-lever responding whereas larger doses occasioned responding on the MK-801 lever. Dexoxadrol substituted completely (greater than or equal to 90%) for the MK-801 discriminative stimulus in all subjects whereas dextrorphan and phencyclidine (PCP) substituted in only two of three subjects. Neither ketamine, (+)-N-allylnormetazocine, dextromethorphan nor the competitive excitatory amino acid antagonist CGS 19755 [cis-4-phosphonomethyl-2-piperidine-carboxylic acid] substituted for MK-801 in any of the monkeys. PCP, dextrorphan, dextromethorphan, (+)- and (-)-MK-801 decreased rates of lever pressing and increased errors in both components of the multiple acquisition, performance schedule. For each compound errors were increased in the acquisition component with doses smaller than doses required to increase errors in the performance component. In both procedures (+)-MK-801 was 10 times more potent than (-)-MK-801, although qualitatively similar results were obtained with the two enantiomers. PCP-like drugs have many effects in common, including their effects on learning and performance; however, with regard to discriminative stimulus effects this does not appear to be a homogenous pharmacological class, suggesting that change in excitatory amino acid-mediated neurotransmission might not be the only mechanism by which MK-801 and related compounds exert behavioral effects in nonhuman primates.\r"

We investigated changes which may occur during pregnancy in hepatic drug handling by comparing metabolic ratios of 15 pregnant epileptic women to 15 nonpregnant epileptic women, as well as 10 pregnant nonepileptic and 10 nonpregnant nonepileptic controls. We used the caffeine test to describe several enzyme activities: P450 1A2, xanthine oxidase, n-acetyltransferase and hydroxylation. For this end, ratios were calculated among a number of metabolites of the main demethylation pathway of caffeine. In addition, we measured D-glucaric acid excretion for specific characterization of antiepileptic drug metabolism. Paired comparison of epileptic women in late pregnancy and six to eight weeks post partum revealed statistically significant decreases in P450 1A2, xanthine oxidase and n-acetyltransferase activities, and a significantly increased hydroxylation activity during pregnancy. Twenty-one of the 30 epileptic women (70%) were found to be fast acetylators, whereas the normal distribution in the nonepileptic control groups was 50%. Excretion of D-glucaric acid was significantly increased in all epileptic patient groups as compared to the matched nonepileptic control groups. Importantly, it was also significantly increased in the pregnant nonepileptic control group as compared to the nonpregnant nonepileptic women. Overall, our results suggest that enzymatic pathways involved in antiepileptic drug metabolism tend to be increased during pregnancy as a potential cause for observed lower serum concentrations of these drugs.\r"

The abilities of PDE inhibitors to reverse the bronchoconstriction induced by serotonin in a beta-blocked anesthetized dog were compared simultaneously with their effects on cardiac contractile force (+dP/dt), heart rate and blood pressure. Aminophylline and enprofylline, two antiasthma drugs with nonselective PDE inhibitory activity, produced dose-dependent (ED50S = 2.3 and 0.58 mg/kg, respectively) and complete (95-100%) bronchodilation accompanied by profound increases in cardiac force, tachycardia and decreases in blood pressure. Similar effects were observed with forskolin, a potent adenylate cyclase activator. Imazodan and CI-930 (inhibitors of the cGMP-inhibitable cAMP-selective PDE isozyme designated PDE-III) induced pulmonary and cardiovascular effects virtually identical to the nonselective PDE inhibitors, but with greater potency (ED50S = 0.02 and 0.04 mg/kg). In contrast, rolipram and Ro 20-1724 (inhibitors of a cGMP-insensitive cAMP-selective PDE isoform commonly designated PDE-IV) induced bronchodilation in the dog (ED50S = 0.007 and 0.63 mg/kg, respectively) without causing significant changes in cardiac force or heart rate, even after predosing dogs with forskolin. However, rolipram and Ro 20-1724 were less efficacious than the other inhibitors in that they induced only partial (50-60%) bronchodilation. The results suggest that canine respiratory muscle tension is regulated by both PDE-III and PDE-IV. Inhibitors of PDE-IV produce bronchodilation in the described model with minimal concomitant cardiac side effects.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The antinociceptive effect of these drugs was determined using the mouse tail-flick test after depletion of norepinephrine or 5-HT by pretreatment with various neurotoxins. Reserpine (i.p.) depleted both norepinephrine and 5-HT. Selective degeneration of noradrenergic nerves was induced by N-(2-chloroethyl)-N-ethyl-2-bromobenzylamine (DSP-4, i.p.) or intrathecal (i.t.) 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA), whereas 5-HT was depleted by p-chlorophenylalanine (PCPA, i.p.) or 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine (5,7-DHT, i.t.). The antinociceptive action of E-2078 administered s.c. was significantly attenuated in mice treated with reserpine, DSP-4, 6-OHDA, PCPA or 5,7-DHT compared with that in non-neurotoxin animals. Antinociception induced by intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) and i.t. injection of E-2078 was reversed by reserpine, DSP-4 or PCPA. The antinociceptive action of morphine (s.c.) was attenuated by reserpine, DSP-4, 6-OHDA and PCPA, but not by 5,7-DHT. Antinociception produced by i.c.v. morphine was antagonized by reserpine, DSP-4 and PCPA. In contrast, morphine given i.t. was not affected by these neurotoxins. U-50,488E (s.c.)-induced antinociception was attenuated by reserpine, DSP-4, 6-OHDA, PCPA and 5,7-DHT. Intracerebroventricular U-50,488E was antagonized by reserpine, DSP-4 and PCPA, whereas i.t. U-50,488E was reversed only by reserpine and PCPA(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Other agonists at the NMDA recognition site, but not quisquilate or kainate, also contracted the LMMP, and glutamate-evoked contractions were competitively inhibited by selective NMDA receptor antagonists. Glutamate-evoked contractions were noncompetitively inhibited by MK-801 [(+)-5-methyl-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo-[a,d]cyclohepten-5,10-imine moleate], phencyclidine (PCP) and other compounds that bind to the PCP receptor, which is a binding site on the NMDA channel complex. Their potencies for this effect were highly correlated with their affinities for the PCP receptor. Glycine significantly shifted the glutamate concentration-response curve to the left. Glycine site antagonists caused a glycine-sensitive, noncompetitive inhibition of glutamate-evoked contractions, and their potencies for this effect were highly correlated with their affinities for the glycine binding site of the NMDA channel complex. Mg++ and Zn++ also noncompetitively inhibited glutamate-evoked contractions. The modulatory effects of glycine, Mg++, Zn++ and PCP receptor ligands were specific to glutamate-evoked contractions. MK-801 was highly selective for inhibition of glutamate-evoked contractions; MK-801 also inhibited nicotinic responses at a 500-fold lower potency. Two novel compounds are described that bind to the PCP receptor with high affinity and selectively inhibit glutamate-evoked contractions in the LMMP.\r"

  ".W": "The mu opioid receptors are unquestionably implicated both in supraspinal and spinal analgesia, but there is some controversy about the role of delta receptors in the control of pain at the supraspinal level. This could be due, at least in part, to the local or i.c.v. administration of the opioid agonists. It was therefore interesting to reassess the overall contribution of mu and delta opioid receptors in modulating nociceptive thermal stimuli in the hot plate-test in mice after i.v. injections of DAMGO (Tyr-D-Ala-Gly-(NMe)Phe-Gly-ol) and BUBU (Tyr-D-Ser(O-tert-butyl)-Gly-Phe-Leu-Thr(O-tert-butyl), two highly selective mu and delta receptor agonists, respectively, whose passage into the brain has been demonstrated recently. Both agonists induced dose-dependent, short-lasting (less than 30 min), antinociceptive responses that peaked 5 min after the administration of DAMGO and 10 min after the administration of BUBU. At these times, DAMGO [ED50: 1.26 mumols (0.65 mg)/kg] was 34 times more potent than BUBU [ED50: 42.5 mumols (34 mg)/kg] in the jump response and 13 times more potent in the paw lick. Apparent pA2 values of naloxone (0.004-0.1 mg/kg s.c.) antagonism for DAMGO and BUBU did not differ significantly, 6.95 +/- 0.054 and 7.28 +/- 0.030 for paw lick tests and 7.11 +/- 0.045 and 7.25 +/- 0.027 for jump tests, respectively. The slopes of the pA2 plots were close to the theoretical -1 value for competitive antagonism.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The effect of adenosine (ADO) on the recovery of cellular adenine nucleotides (AN) was evaluated in the cultured cells deprived of oxygen and substrates (ischemia) and in nonischemic cells (control). The primary cultured cells were obtained from microdissected rabbit proximal straight tubules. Ten-day-old cultured cells were made ischemic for 6 hr, and allowed to recover for 24 hr. At the end of ischemia, cells were incubated with ADO, theophylline (T), dipyridamole (D), coformycin (C) or combined agents for 3 hr. Total AN (TAN) were determined after 3 and 24 hr of recovery. The results, after 3 hr of incubation, suggest that in both control and ischemic cells, ADO is taken up by cultured cells and is preferentially converted to nucleotides. This effect is blocked by D, which inhibits ADO uptake, uninfluenced by C, which inhibits ADO deaminase and potentiated by T, which inhibits 5'-nucleotidase. After 24 hr of recovery, the beneficial effects of ADO alone or combined D, C, or T, on TAN were not seen in control cells. In contrast, in the ischemic cells, after 24 hr of recovery, ADO + T normalized ATP, ADP and TAN to the preischemic levels. T alone significantly increased ATP after 24 hr of recovery. To demonstrate further that the beneficial effect of T is due to inhibition of 5'-nucleotidase, cells were treated with adenosine alpha, beta-methylene diphosphate in the same manner as T. Combined ADO + adenosine alpha, beta-methylene diphosphate normalized ATP, ADP and TAN after 24 hr of recovery. This finding suggests that inhibition of 5'-nucleotidase improves postischemic AN.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In postprandial state, AS-4370 given 0.2 to 1 mg/kg i.v. or 1 mg/kg intraduodenally (i.d.) stimulated the antral and duodenal motor activity without affecting the colonic motor activity. Cisapride at 0.2 to 1 mg/kg i.v. or 1 mg/kg i.d. stimulated the motor activity in all sites of the GI tract from the stomach to the colon simultaneously. Metoclopramide, like AS-4370, stimulated the antral and duodenal motor activity, but its effect was less potent than that of AS-4370. AS-4370 did not stimulate the GI motor activity under treatment with atropine but stimulated it under vagotomy. Furthermore, AS-4370 did not potentiate the methacholine-induced antral contraction, whereas neostigmine at 10 micrograms/kg i.v. significantly enhanced it. AS-4370 at 1 mg/kg i.v. did not antagonize the inhibition of antral motor activity induced by i.v. infusion of dopamine (1 mg/kg/hr), whereas cisapride (0.5 mg/kg i.v.) and metoclopramide (1 mg/kg i.v.) antagonized it. In addition, the enhancement of GI motor activity induced by AS-4370 was not prevented by propranolol, prazosin, yohimbine, methysergide, ketanserin, ICS 205-930 or naloxone. 5- Hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) receptor desensitization induced by 5-HT (300 micrograms/kg/hr) in the antrum reduced the enhancement induced by AS-4370.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this investigation was twofold, 1) to clarify the pharmacological significance of various groups on the D-ring of grayanotoxin (GTX) and 2) to determine possible sites on GTX which are available for preparing pharmacological probes. All GTX derivatives were directly applied to the intracellular phase of internally perfused squid giant axons. A dose-response curve for each GTX analog was constructed using depolarization as an index and assuming a simple one-to-one stoichiometry. By comparing EC50 and the maximum depolarization caused by GTX analogs, the main factors affecting potency were found to be: the formation of 1) electrostatic interaction, 2) a hydrogen bond between groups on the D-ring of GTX and part of the Na channel protein and 3) balance between hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity in the GTX molecule. Biologically essential groups like those in the A- and B-rings were not recognized. A suitable site on GTX for synthesizing pharmacological probes is probably position C-17 of grayanotox-15-ene compound, because in chemical modification, bulkier groups can be introduced without a total loss of biological activity of GTX. Another possible site for modification is position C-14R, because this portion is on the molecular surface opposite biologically essential groups. It can be speculated that in GTX binding, possible molecular moiety of the Na channel facing the D-ring of GTX is rich in positively charged amino groups.\r"

Before treatment, each compound evoked full morphine-like stimulus effects in rats trained to discriminate saline and 3.2 mg/kg morphine. During treatment, training was halted and a dose of 10 mg/kg morphine administered every 12 h for 14-18 days. Repeated treatment with morphine increased the ED50 for stimulus control by etorphine, methadone or buprenorphine 2- to 4-fold and that for morphine 4.5-fold. Repeated treatment produced an insurmountable tolerance to the morphine-like stimulus effects of nalbuphine, so that a dose 150-fold higher than the initial ED50 evoked only 40% generalization. Treatment with a lower dose of morphine (10 mg/kg every 24 h) produced a short-lived surmountable tolerance to stimulus effects of nalbuphine. For etorphine, methadone and morphine, tolerance to morphine-like stimulus effects was accompanied by tolerance to rate suppressing effects. After treatment ended, the ED50 for stimulus control by etorphine, methadone or nalbuphine returned to initial values within 3 days; that for morphine, within 5 days; that for buprenorphine, within 10 days. These results demonstrate that repeated treatment with morphine produces cross-tolerance to compounds that exert morphine-like stimulus effects. Additionally, the results suggest that differences among these compounds in agonist efficacy may be revealed as differences in the degree of tolerance produced by morphine treatment.\r"

  ".W": "The mechanism of action of clebopride on the motility of guinea pig stomach was examined by the receptor binding assay for bovine brain membrane and by measuring gastric contractility and the release of acetylcholine from the stomach. The receptor binding assay revealed that clebopride bound to the D2 dopamine receptor with a high affinity and to the alpha-2 adrenoceptor and 5-HT2 serotonin receptor with relatively lower affinity, and not to D1 dopamine, alpha-1 adrenergic, muscarinic acetylcholine, H1 histamine, or opioid receptor. In strips of the stomach, clebopride at 10(-8) M to 10(-5) M enhanced the electrical transmural stimulation-evoked contraction and the release of acetylcholine. This enhancement was attributed to the blockade of the D2 dopamine receptor and alpha-2 adrenoceptor because: 1) Maximum responses obtained with specific D2 dopamine receptor antagonist, domperidone, and with specific alpha-2 adrenoceptor antagonist, yohimbine, were smaller than that with clebopride, and the sum of the effects of these two specific receptor antagonists is approximately equal to the effect of clebopride. 2) The facilitatory effect of clebopride was partially eliminated by pretreatment of the sample with domperidone or yohimbine, and the facilitatory effect of clebopride was not observed in preparations treated with the combination of domperidone and yohimbine. Clebopride also antagonized the inhibitory effects of dopamine and clonidine on the electrical transmural stimulation-evoked responses. These results indicate that clebopride acts on post ganglionic cholinergic neurons at D2 and alpha-2 receptors in this preparation to enhance enteric nervous system stimulated motility.\r"

  ".W": "In the present study, we have examined the effects of decreasing pH from 7.0 to 6.6 on the tension developed by direct activation of the myofilaments in chemically skinned fibers from guinea pig papillary muscles. We then compared the effects of the novel inotropic agents MCI-154, pimobendan and sulmazole, which have direct action on cardiac myofilaments, on the acidic pH-induced changes in responses of the contractile system to Ca++. The reduction of pH from 7.0 to 6.8 shifted the pCa (-log[Ca++] M)-tension relation curve to the right with no change in maximum tension. However, the reduction of pH from 7.0 to 6.6 shifted the pCa tension relation curve to the right and also depressed maximum force development. These effects were reversible by returning to neutral pH (pH 7.0), but were not overcome by increasing the free [Ca++] (decreasing pCa from 4.4 to 4.0). The amplitude of pMg-ATP (-log[MgATP]M)-tension curve in the absence of free Ca++ (Ca++ less than 1 nM, bell-shaped curve) was shifted downward by reducing pH from 7.0 to 6.6. MCI-154 (1-100 microM) reversed the acidic pH-induced decrease of tension development which was activated by pCa 5.8 in a concentration-dependent manner. Moreover, the acidosis induced reductions of maximum tension (pCa, 4.4) and pMgATP 6.0-activated tension (Ca++ less than 1 nM) were also reversed by MCI-154 (1-100 microM) in a concentration-dependent manner.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Receptor binding of the opioid receptor antagonist, [3H]diprenorphine, which has a similar affinity to the various opioid receptor subtypes, was characterized in subcellular fractions derived from either longitudinal or circular smooth muscle of the canine small intestine with their plexuses (myenteric plexus and deep muscular plexus, respectively) attached. The distribution of opioid binding activity showed a good correlation in the different fractions with the binding of the neuronal marker [3H]saxitoxin but no correlation to the smooth muscle plasma membrane marker 5'-nucleotidase. The saturation data (Kd = 0.12 +/- 0.04 nM and maximum binding = 400 +/- 20 fmol/mg) and the data from kinetic experiments (Kd = 0.08 nmol) in the myenteric plexus were in good agreement with results obtained previously from the circular muscle/deep muscular plexus preparation. Competition experiments using selective drugs for mu [morphiceptin-analog (N-MePhe3-D-Pro4)-morphiceptin] ), delta (D-Pen2,5-enkephalin) and kappa (dynorphin 1-13, U50488-H) ligands showed the existence of all three receptor subtypes. The existence of kappa receptors was confirmed in saturation experiments using [3H] ethylketocycloazocine as labeled ligand. Two putative opioid agonists, with effects on gastrointestinal motility, trimebutine and JO-1196 (fedotozin), were also examined. Trimebutine (Ki = 0.18 microM), Des-Met-trimebutine (Ki = 0.72 microM) and Jo-1196 (Ki = 0.19 microM) displaced specific opiate binding. The relative affinity for the opioid receptor subtypes was mu = 0.44, delta = 0.30 and kappa = 0.26 for trimebutine and mu = 0.25, delta = 0.22 and kappa = 0.52 for Jo-1196. Thus, Jo-1196 had some selectivity for kappa receptors compared to trimebutine. We conclude that there are similar types of opioid receptors in the myenteric plexus and the deep muscular plexus and that specificity of function of opioid nerves must depend on differential location of receptor types on particular neurons. The action of trimebutine and related drugs could vary depending upon their interactions with various gut opioid receptors having different physiological roles.\r"

Nitrous oxide caused a concentration-dependent decrease in contractility under all loading conditions, with minor changes in relaxation. The intracellular calcium transient was detected with the Ca(++)-regulated photoprotein aequorin. The change in aequorin luminescence on exposure to nitrous oxide suggests that the negative inotropic effect of nitrous oxide is due to a decrease in calcium availability with no effect on myofibrillar responsiveness to calcium.\r"

Animals received either vehicle or reserpine (1 mg/kg s.c.) on days 1 to 28 and, in addition, half of each of these groups were treated with vehicle and half were treated with SKF-38393 (5-10 mg/kg s.c.) on days 15 to 29. Quantitative autoradiographic measurement of D1 receptors labeled with [3H]SCH-23390 and D2 receptors labeled with [3H]spiroperidol revealed that chronic administration of reserpine increased the density of both receptor subtypes in the nucleus accumbens and caudate-putamen, but not in the substantia nigra. Chronic administration of SKF-38393 alone did not alter D1 receptor density in any of these regions. However, chronic administration of the agonist in reserpinized animals decreased D1 receptor density in the nucleus accumbens, but not in the caudate-putamen or substantia nigra, demonstrating that this partial agonist can selectively down-regulate D1 receptors when endogenous dopaminergic tone is removed. The chronic drug treatments also altered behavioral responses. Chronic administration of SKF-38393 alone produced sensitization of the oral dyskinesia response elicited by a challenge injection of the agonist, but no significant change in the grooming response. Acute administration of SKF-38393 in rats treated with reserpine for 14 days produced stereotypy which was not altered after chronic administration of the agonist. Surprisingly, chronic administration of reserpine alone produced a spontaneous oral dyskinesia, which was blocked dose-dependently by the D2-selective antagonist spiroperidol. These findings are discussed in terms of their relevance to Parkinson's disease and tardive dyskinesia.\r"

  ".W": "Our study had three purposes: 1) to determine whether 5-methyl-urapidil, topically applied to the ventrolateral medulla, produces hypotension by activating serotonin-1A (5-HT1A) receptors, 2) to determine whether 5-methyl-urapidil given i.v. produces hypotension in part by activating 5-HT1A receptors in the ventrolateral medulla, and 3) to determine the specific site within the ventrolateral medulla where 5-methyl-urapidil elicits a hypotensive response. In terms of the first purpose, 5-methyl-urapidil applied bilaterally to the intermediate area of the ventral surface of the medulla (1.2 micrograms/side) of chloralose-anesthetized cats produced a decrease in mean arterial pressure of -39 +/- 4 mm Hg (N = 8). Prior blockade of 5-HT1A receptors at this site with bilateral application of spiperone (30 micrograms/side) prevented the hypotensive effect of 5-methyl-urapidil (mean blood pressure now increased by 5 +/- 4 mm Hg). Pretreatment with the alpha-1 adrenoceptor antagonist, prazosin, did not prevent the hypotensive effect of 5-methyl-urapidil. In terms of the second purpose, spiperone applied bilaterally to the ventral surface of the medulla counteracted a significant portion of the hypotensive effect of 5-methyl-urapidil given by the i.v. route. The dose of 5-methyl-urapidil given intravenously was below the dose that produces alpha-1 adrenoceptor blockade. In terms of the third purpose, microinjection of 5-methyl-urapidil into central nervous system sites associated with the intermediate area was found to have its greatest hypotensive effect at the subretrofacial nucleus. Mean arterial pressure decreased by 74 +/- 14 mm Hg (N = 3) after bilateral microinjection of 25 ng of the drug.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "\"Graded\" metabolic stress was induced chemically in an ex vivo preparation of retina to examine the early events following metabolic inhibition that lead to acute toxicity. Toxicity was assessed histologically and by quantitation of endogenous gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) release. Blockade of glycolysis with iodoacetate or electron transport with potassium cyanide for 30 min (\"mild\" metabolic stress) produced histopathology and GABA release similar to that seen with glutamate agonist treatment. These effects were completely prevented by the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist [(+)-5-methyl-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo (a,d)cyclohepten,5,10-imine maleate (MK-801) and occurred in the absence of any net increase in extracellular glutamate or aspartate. More \"severe\" compromise of metabolism (iodoacetate plus potassium cyanide for 30 min) caused greater swelling and GABA release, which was only partially attenuated by competitive or noncompetitive NMDA antagonists and was accompanied by elevations in extracellular excitatory amino acids. Temporal studies of \"severe\" metabolic inhibition and the rise in excitatory amino acids demonstrated that, like \"mild\" metabolic inhibition, the early acute pathology was mediated exclusively by the NMDA receptor and occurred before elevation in excitatory amino acids. Tetrodotoxin and 6-nitro,7-cyanoquinoxaline,2,3-dion (CNQX) had little effect per se on reducing GABA release under conditions of \"severe\" metabolic inhibition; however, CNQX or tetrodotoxin in combination with MK-801 afforded greater protection than did MK-801 alone. Thus, activity at kainate/AMPA receptors and voltage-sensitive Na+ channels may be additional factors contributing to acute toxicity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The in vitro contractions of four successive branches of the rabbit middle cerebral artery to norepinephrine (NE), serotonin (5HT), histamine, and electrical field stimulation (EFS) were examined. Internal lumen diameters of the four branches (designated MCA, M1, M2, M3, proximal to distal) ranged from a mean of 270 microns in the MCA to 160 microns in the M3 segments. NE produced a small alpha adrenoceptor-mediated response in the MCA (12% of tissue maximum); this was diminished in the M1 segment and there was no evidence of alpha adrenoceptor-mediated responses in the M2 and M3 branches. NE contractions, mediated through low affinity sites (extraceptors), did not change with branch order. Maximal responses to 5HT (1 microM) were small and also diminished with branch order; the MCA and M1 contracted to 24 and 18% of tissue maximum, respectively. Negligible responses were obtained in M2 and M3. EFS resulted in contractions that were tetrodotoxin- and guanethidine-sensitive. Maximum EFS responses were 21% tissue maximum in the MCA, 13% in the M1, and less than 5% in the M2 and M3. In contrast, maximal contractile responses to histamine (100 microM) were at or near tissue maximum in all segments. Removal of the endothelium did not influence the size of the contraction to NE, 5HT or histamine in the MCA and M1 segments. Neither NE, 5HT, nor histamine caused relaxation responses in agonist or KCl-contracted segments. The results indicate a differential variation in responsiveness with increasing branch order in the rabbit cerebrovascular bed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Neutrophil-derived oxidants may be involved in inflammatory bowel disease. Stable oxidants formed by halogenation of primary amines (e.g., monochloramine, NH2Cl) are extremely potent and may be of major importance in the pathophysiological response in inflammatory bowel disease. We tested the effects of NH2Cl relative to other oxidants on muscle-stripped rat colon under short-circuit conditions. Serosal addition of the oxidants evoked a concentration-dependent increase in short-circuit current (Isc). The EC50 values were 3.2 microM for NH2Cl, 6.5 microM for HOCl and 6.5 microM for H2O2. Responses to NH2Cl and H2O2 were abolished by removal of Cl- or Ca++. Unidirectional 36Cl- flux measurements showed that both oxidants (50 microM) evoked significant decreases in net chloride absorption. Tetrodotoxin (0.5 microM) and atropine (0.5 microM) partially inhibited the initial phase of the response to 50 microM NH2Cl; tetrodotoxin completely inhibited and atropine partially inhibited the response to 50 microM H2O2. Piroxicam (5 microM) inhibited the increase in Isc to 50 microM NH2Cl and H2O2 by 20-45% and 90%, respectively. Serosal prostaglandin E2 levels were significantly increased after the addition of 50 microM NH2Cl and H2O2. The morphological response to NH2Cl consisted of changes in mucosal depth and crypt architecture. In conclusion, at concentrations found in inflamed tissue, both NH2Cl and H2O2 increase Isc probably by stimulating release of arachidonate metabolites and neurotransmitter(s). NH2Cl also may act directly on the epithelial cell to stimulate Isc and evoke Cl- secretion.\r"

  ".W": "Beta adrenergic antagonists have been demonstrated to show stereoselective affinity for serotonin (5-HT) receptors in the central nervous system, and competitively inhibit 5-HT transport of platelets, but have not previously been evaluated for their influence on either 5-HT receptors or 5-HT transport systems of vascular cells. We have reported stimulation of 5-HT uptake by subjection of endothelial (EC) and smooth muscle cells (SMC) to anoxia. We now report that (+/-)-propranolol inhibits 5-HT uptake by both room air- and anoxia-exposed EC and SMC in culture. The effect on SMC was more marked than that on EC and showed a similar inhibition as ketanserin. The relative inhibitory potencies of beta adrenergic antagonists and ketanserin on uptake of 5-HT by SMC were as follows: (+/-)-propranolol = ketanserin greater than alprenolol = pindolol greater than oxprenolol = atenolol. The beta adrenergic receptor agonist, isoproterenol, in the presence of isobutylmethylxanthine, an inhibitor of phosphodiesterase, produced a high elevation of cyclic AMP in SMC along with a cellular configurational change and partially inhibited uptake of 5-HT. Propranolol inhibited 5-HT uptake both in the presence and absence of isoproterenol plus isobutylmethylxanthine, suggesting that its inhibitory effect was not mediated through its interaction at the beta adrenergic receptor. Kinetic analyses of the effect of propranolol on 5-HT uptake indicated that propranolol reduced 5-HT uptake by noncompetitive inhibition. We conclude that beta adrenergic antagonists block vascular cell uptake of 5-HT through an action other than interaction with the beta adrenergic receptor.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Acetylcholine is present in a majority of submucosal neurons which project to the intestinal epithelium. In this study, we examined the role of acetylcholine and the actions of cholinomimetic drugs, such as carbachol (CCH), on ion transport across muscle-stripped sheets of mucosa-submucosa from the proximal jejunum of weaned piglets. Serosal administration of CCH (10 nM-100 microM) produced rapid increases in short-circuit current (Isc) which were attributed to net Cl secretion. Acetylcholine, bethanechol and (4-hydroxy-2-butynyl)-1-trimethylammonium m-chlorocarbanilate chloride were partially effective in increasing Isc. Atropine and selective muscarinic cholinergic antagonists produced dextral shifts in the CCH concentration-effect relationship with an order of relative potency of 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methyl piperidine methiodide (4-DAMP) greater than atropine much greater than pirenzepine greater than 11-[[[2-(diethylamino)methyl]-1-piperidinyl]acetyl]-5, 11-dihydro-6H-pyrido[2,3-b][1,4]benzodiazepine-6-one(AF-DX116). The muscarinic receptor blocker [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate (QNB) bound specifically and saturably to two sites in the mucosa-submucosa having equilibrium dissociation constants of approximately 10 +/- 3 and 890 +/- 120 pM and Bmax = 7 +/- 3 and 47 +/- 9 fmol/mg protein, respectively. Selective cholinergic antagonists competed for [3H]QNB binding with a rank order of affinity of 4-DAMP greater than hexahydrosiladifenidol much greater than AF-DX 116 greater than or equal to pirenzepine. Specific [3H]QNB binding sites were autoradiographically localized in the jejunal wall to the epithelium, submucosa, and muscularis propria. Electrical transmural stimulation (10-300 pulses/10 sec, 0.5 msec duration, 60 V stimulus strength) delivered to mucosal sheets produced tetrodotoxin-sensitive Isc elevations which were proportional to the number of impulses delivered. Mucosal Isc responses to electrical stimulation were attenuated by 10 microM hexamethonium, 1 microM atropine or autotachyphylaxis to CCH. Tetrodotoxin, at 0.1 microM, produced a 20-fold increase in the secretory potency of CCH. These results suggest that acetylcholine released from intramural neurons in porcine proximal jejunum produces transepithelial Cl secretion. Its effects may be mediated through interactions with two populations of muscarinic cholinergic receptors, located on neuronal and non-neuronal cells within the intestinal mucosa and submucosa, which serve to inhibit and promote Cl secretion respectively.\r"

Furthermore, there was a steady and statistically significant increase in serum ferritin levels with advancing disease stage, as well as a significant decrease in serum ferritin levels after nephrectomy for stages 1 and 2 disease. The intracellular content of ferritin as estimated by polyclonal antibody was dramatically increased in renal cancer tissue compared to normal parenchyma.

In patients with intracaval neoplastic extension precise definition of the superior aspect of the tumor thrombus is critical. Transabdominal ultrasonography, computerized tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and inferior venacavography are all currently used to evaluate the inferior vena cava in these patients. Intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography was used to image the inferior vena cava in 5 patients with renal cell carcinoma and intracaval neoplastic extension. In each patient transesophageal echocardiography correctly revealed the superior extent of tumor thrombus. In 3 patients tumor thrombus was found at a higher level by transesophageal echocardiography than by CT, MRI and inferior venacavography. In all patients tumor imaging by transesophageal echocardiography correlated well with the gross appearance and extent of tumor found at operation. Echocardiography also documented the absence of residual gross tumor after resection. Transesophageal echocardiography was also useful to assess left ventricular function. Although each of these patients had a pulmonary artery catheter as well transesophageal echocardiography can be useful in situations when right atrial tumor thrombus prevents right heart catheterization. This small series demonstrates that intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography can accurately evaluate the extent of tumor thrombus and provides a means to assess myocardial function complementary to the pulmonary artery catheter.\r"

No intrarenal or perinephric hematomas were observed and only 1 patient has had hypertension requiring medication. Renal colic from passage of stone fragments occurred in only 10% of the patients. An aggressive treatment policy using repeat treatments as necessary provides for superior results with this device without an incision or complication.\r"

We report our initial experience with the Benchekroun hydraulic valve in 9 patients. Five patients underwent creation of an ileocolic bladder: for myelodysplasia in 1, after cystectomy for bladder cancer in 2 and for exstrophy in 2. Two patients underwent conversion from an uncatheterizable Indiana pouch because of exstrophy (1) and interstitial cystitis (1). Two patients underwent small bowel augmentation of a small, poorly compliant bladder with an abdominal Benchekroun stoma: 1 had exstrophy and 1 had myelodysplasia. Patient age ranged from 7 to 63 years. Two patients had de novo creation of an ileocolic bladder, whereas 7 had bladder or previous bowel conduits incorporated in the continent reservoirs. At up to 20 months of followup all patients had diurnal and nocturnal continence, and none had experienced serious long-term complications. Problems were encountered in 5 patients. One patient had a valve fistula that was surgically revised. One patient experienced transient difficulty with catheterization when the reservoir was overdistended and a false passage developed. Three patients had stomal stenosis and require periodic dilation. We believe the Benchekroun hydraulic valve to be a useful adjunct in the construction of a continent urinary reservoir. It is easy to construct, provides reliable continence and is easy to catheterize. Furthermore, it may be applied to standard ileocolic bladders either de novo or as a salvage procedure for failed efferent limbs.\r"

In particular, we evaluated the usefulness of flow cytometry to identify patients who require adjuvant treatment among those with low grade and low stage disease (51% in this series). A multivariate analysis was done on 92 cases, considering patient age and sex, stage, grade and number of lesions (unifocal versus multifocal), site (renal pelvis versus ureter), presence of vesical tumors, recurrences along the urinary tract or in the bladder, type of operation and nuclear deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) ploidy (diploid versus tetraploid/aneuploid tumors). Only the stage (p = 0.001), grade (p = 0.001) and, to a lesser extent, the DNA pattern (p = 0.031), as well as the number of lesions (p = 0.061) were determinant for prognosis. In regard to the subgroup of 41 patients with grade 2 or less, stage P1 or less tumors, no significant difference in survival was demonstrated between diploid and nondiploid tumor patients. However, 7 of 10 patients from the latter group are still under observation. Therefore, our conclusions may have to be modified in the future.\r"

By histopathology the findings were classified as severe atypia corresponding to primary grade 3 carcinoma in situ, atypia not fulfilling the criteria for carcinoma in situ and no atypia. The DNA histograms were classified as diploid or aneuploid. Aneuploid cell populations in mucosal biopsies were found mainly in cases with aneuploid tumors of grade 3. Of the biopsies classified as concomitant carcinoma in situ 76% were aneuploid. In biopsies exhibiting less severe or no atypia aneuploidy was found in 41 and 10%, respectively. For these 3 morphological categories the distributions of the aneuploid cell populations were similar irrespective of the histopathological findings and they were also the same as that found in primary carcinoma in situ. We concluded that gross chromosomal aberrations may appear at an early stage of the tumor development and before changes recognizable by morphology. The similarity of the DNA profiles of the aneuploid cell populations, regardless of morphological findings, indicates that apart from gross chromosomal aberrations changes of the phenotype are necessary for the expression of morphological changes.\r"

A total of 57 bladder cancer patients was evaluated. MRI was performed with a superconducting magnet operating at 1.5 Tesla. The images acquired were multisections, having a fast spin-echo pulse sequence of less than a 14-second breath holding. Serial scans were performed before and immediately after Gd-DTPA venous injection. The findings on different imaging techniques were compared with the histological stagings. A proper diagnosis was made in 42 of 57 cases (73.7%) by Gd-DTPA-enhanced MRI, in 27 of 57 (47.4%) by CT and in 31 of 57 (54.4%) by transurethral ultrasonography when comparing the histological findings. The sensitivity and specificity for differentiating superficial and muscle-invasive tumor of each imaging method were, respectively, 96.2 and 83.3% in Gd-DTPA-enhanced MRI, 96.0 and 58.3% in CT, and 88.0 and 66.7% in transurethral ultrasonography. These data suggest that the staging of bladder cancer by Gd-DTPA-enhanced MRI appears to be superior and more accurate than the staging obtained by CT and transurethral ultrasonography.\r"

Patients with negative nodes (stage I) were placed in an observation registry with specified treatment strategy upon relapse. Of 264 stage I cancer patients 27 (10.2%) had recurrence: 5 of these 27 patients died after recurrence of the testicular malignancies, while 4 other nontumor-related deaths have occurred. Pre-lymphadenectomy staging characteristics observed to predict significantly node positivity are the results of radiological examinations, presence of tumor invasion, vascular invasion and tumor histology. In a multiple logistic regression analysis with these variables, misclassification still occurs in more than a fourth of the patients. Future refinements in diagnosis may allow for better prediction of these patients at risk to have positive lymph nodes and ultimately recurrence. Presently, if assessment of nodal involvement is the objective, noninvasive procedures are not an adequate substitute for surgical staging with modified lymphadenectomy.\r"

All significant upper tract pathology (4 renal cell carcinomas and 1 transitional cell carcinoma of the renal pelvis) identified by an IVP also was detected by ultrasonography. Of 5 clinically silent stones seen on an IVP 4 were identified by sonography. There were 13 patients (7.6%) with severe contrast medium allergies or renal failure who were readily evaluated with ultrasonography. Urologist-performed sonography can safely replace an IVP for routine evaluation of the urinary tract before prostatectomy. Moreover, sonography provided significant additional data on prostate size and post-void residual. However, the cost-effectiveness of upper tract imaging in patients before prostatectomy may be questioned.\r"

Two outcome groups were selected on the basis of survival after orchiectomy: a bad outcome group consisting of 66 patients who died of the disease within 12 months and a good outcome group comprising 37 patients who survived beyond 5 years. Tumors were classified histologically as well (17%), moderately (17%) or poorly (66%) differentiated. Tumor grade was a significant predictor of outcome, with 76% of poorly differentiated tumors in the bad outcome group and 65% of well differentiated tumors in the good outcome group (p less than 0.005). Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) ploidy analysis was performed on formalin fixed, paraffin embedded samples of the primary tumor to yield 97 final tracings that were classified using set criteria for DNA ploidy status. Over-all, 54% of the tumors were nondiploid (33% aneuploid and 21% tetraploid) and the remaining 46% were diploid. DNA ploidy status was a significant indicator of outcome (p less than 0.001), with 64% of diploid tumors in the good outcome group and 88% of the nondiploid tumors in the poor outcome group. Tetraploid tumors behaved no differently from other nondiploid tumors. We conclude that DNA ploidy status and tumor grading are significant independent predictors of outcome after orchiectomy and when combined yield important additional prognostic information.\r"

The 5-year actuarial rate was 4% for local recurrence alone, 5% for distant metastases alone, 2% for distant metastases in association with local recurrence and 3% for death of or with disease, while 10% of the men had elevated levels of prostate specific antigen without local recurrence or distant metastases. When the actuarial status at 5 years was evaluated by clinical stage there was local recurrence alone in 0% of men with a clinical stage A1 or B1 nodule, and 4% with stage B1, 7% with stage A2 and 8% with stage B2 disease. When evaluated by pathological stage at 5 years local recurrence alone was noted in 2% of men with organ-confined disease, 8% with specimen-confined disease and 8% in whom the disease involved the surgical margin, seminal vesicles or pelvic lymph nodes. Recognizing that two-thirds to three-quarters of all local recurrences occur within the first 5 years, these data suggest that the anatomical approach to radical prostatectomy is associated with local control rates that are equal to or greater than other series reported in the literature. However, without a randomized study it is impossible to compare one clinical series to another, and followup evaluations at 10 and 15 years will be necessary to confirm these findings.\r"

The predominance of E. coli in bacteremic urinary tract infections was observed regardless of whether indwelling urinary drainage devices were used. The finding that E. coli accounted for a greater proportion of bacteremic than nonbacteremic urinary tract infections indicates that bacteremia arising from the geriatric urinary tract is not simply a consequence of mechanical factors, such as urinary tract obstruction. Thus, further investigations are warranted to assess the specific contribution of previously defined E. coli virulence factors to the pathogenesis of urinary tract infections in such patients.\r"

Thromboembolic stockings, external sequential pneumatic compression stockings and anticoagulant agents, such as heparin sodium plus dihydroergotamine mesylate, have been suggested to decrease the risk of deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary emboli. A total of 74 evaluable patients undergoing a major urological operation was randomized to receive either thromboembolic stockings, external sequential pneumatic compression stockings, or heparin plus dihydroergotamine as prophylaxis against deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary emboli. 111Indium-labeled platelet scans, performed preoperatively and on days 1, 3 and 6 postoperatively, were used to diagnose deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary emboli. Mean patient age was 63 years and all but 1 operation was performed for neoplastic disease. Deep venous thrombosis was detected in 5 of 25 patients (20%) with thromboembolic stockings, 3 of 24 (12.5%) with external sequential pneumatic compression stockings and 2 of 25 (8%) with heparin plus dihydroergotamine. There was no difference in blood loss or complications among the groups. Although statistical significance among the treatment groups was not reached in this study, the trend to a decrease in deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary emboli with external sequential pneumatic compression stockings and heparin plus dihydroergotamine, and an absence of an increase in morbidity in these groups supports the use of these modalities to decrease the morbidity and mortality of deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary emboli.\r"

Cystoceles recurred in 3 patients, and enteroceles developed in 3 and recurred in 2. These findings indicate that cystoceles may cause voiding dysfunction and lack of symptoms of stress incontinence is unreliable in patients with cystoceles. In addition, cystoceles are associated with other symptoms, most of which actually resolve after operative repair.\r"

In a prospective study of 40 patients with definite multiple sclerosis (mean disease duration 5 years), urodynamic investigations (cystometry and pressure-flow study) were combined with neuro-urophysiological measurements (cortical evoked potentials and sacral reflex latencies). Patients with (13) and without (27) micturition complaints were investigated. Neurourodynamic abnormalities were seen in 35 of 40 patients (88%). The lower urinary tract proved to be afflicted by multiple sclerosis at an early stage of the disease. Early neurourodynamic investigations had clinical implications. All of the complaining and half of the noncomplaining patients showed urodynamic abnormalities upon which the need for further followup and eventual therapeutic intervention was based. We conclude that neurourodynamic testing of a urinary functional system can be worthwhile as part of the initial diagnostic evaluation in patients with proved multiple sclerosis.\r"

Of 5 (80%) partial Drash syndrome cases 4 (80%) were also intralobar nephrogenic rest positive. Neither group had perilobar nephrogenic rests identified. In a control population of Wilms tumor patients without the Drash syndrome only 39 of 274 (14%) with unilateral tumor had intralobar nephrogenic rests identified, whereas 26 of 92 (28%) bilateral cases had intralobar nephrogenic rests. There was a significantly higher rate of intralobar nephrogenic rests in complete and partial Drash syndrome cases than in the general Wilms tumor population (p less than 0.001). Wilms tumor patients with intralobar nephrogenic rests and the Drash syndrome present at a younger age and have a higher rate of bilaterality than rest negative Wilms tumor patients. The strong association of intralobar nephrogenic rests in the Drash syndrome approaches that found in the aniridia complex. However, in other syndromes associated with Wilms tumor, such as the Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome and hemihypertrophy, there is a high prevalence of perilobar nephrogenic rests. In view of the high incidence of intralobar nephrogenic rests in complete and partial Drash syndrome patients, it is probable that events leading to Wilms tumor in patients with the Drash syndrome occur at an early stage in nephrogenesis.\r"

All treatments were done with the standard Siemens Lithostar device in situ: no special adaptations for adequate positioning of children are required to target the stone precisely. A total of 42 calculi in 30 renal units was treated, requiring 50 ESWL sessions. The mean energy used was 16.4 kv. and the number of shock waves averaged 3,188. Mean fluoroscopy time per session was 1.5 minutes. In 26 of 50 sessions (52%) general anesthesia was needed for the child to remain perfectly still. A complete stone-free rate was achieved in 38 of 42 calculi (90.5%): after 1 session in 30 (71.4%), after 2 sessions in 6 (13.7%) and after 3 sessions in 2 (4.8%). Five staghorn calculi were treated with ESWL monotherapy. A complete stone-free result was obtained after 3 treatments in 2 patients, while 2 had residual fragments in the lower pole (5 mm. after 6 sessions and 11 months of followup in 1, and 7 mm. after 3 sessions and 3 months of followup in 1). A cystine staghorn stone necessitated open nephrolithotomy after 3 sessions without any fragmentation. One impacted sacroiliac ureteral stone required endoscopic laser lithotripsy. Except for these 2 failures no adjuvant procedures were needed. There were no intraoperative or postoperative complications and minor skin bruising at the coupling site after 3 treatments did not require any therapy. We conclude that electromagnetic ESWL with the standard Lithostar unit is a safe and effective method to treat calculi throughout the urinary tract in children.\r"

The arterial input, through 4 branches from the external pudendal arteries, is terminal and after birth supplies the outer and inner preputial surfaces in succession. Similarly, the venous return arises from small veins running transversely in the prepuce that connect to larger subcutaneous veins along the dorsal aspect of the shaft. Because the 2 preputial surfaces have a single blood supply they must be treated as 1 unit. Unfolding the prepuce leaves the former inner segment with only a terminal blood supply. The pedicle containing the superficial blood supply must remain attached to the skin flap or it will be devascularized. However, since this circulation goes exclusively to the flap, the more proximal portion of the prepuce that was raised to form the pedicle becomes ischemic when used as ventral cover. A double-faced flap avoids this complication.\r"

Exfoliated urinary cells are ideal for analysis by this method, which allows the identification of \"rare event\" abnormal cells. We evaluated the urine from 50 children who had undergone cystoscopy or were catheterized for other reasons. The urine was free of infection by urinalysis. Cytological analysis demonstrated normal or atypical cells in all patients. Of the patients 1 (2%) had greater than 2 of 500 cells analyzed with greater than 5C DNA and 4 (8%) had greater than 2 of 500 cells with greater than 5C double stranded nucleic acid. These data suggest that it may be \"normal\" for urine to contain \"rare event\" abnormal cells. The significance of this finding is unclear at present.\r"

One of our patients also had renal pelvic involvement, while 1 is the youngest (3 years old) patient reported and the first instance of bilateral eosinophilic ureteritis. Our review found that eosinophilic ureteritis largely occurs in atopic or hypereosinophilic syndromes, often with a traumatic history. Eosinophilic and idiopathic segmental ureteritis causes ureteral obstruction due to mural involvement. However, eosinophilic ureteritis never forms an intraluminal mass and is not associated with mucosal ulceration. In addition, we found no case reported with features that bridge the 2 conditions. We conclude that the clinical and pathological features of eosinophilic and idiopathic segmental ureteritis are sufficiently distinct to separate the 2 conditions.\r"

During the treatment period of six weeks, the growth rate of the prostatic tumors was measured. At the end of the treatment period the morphology of the tumors was also studied. It was found that medroxyprogesterone acetate is as effective as estradiol in inhibiting the growth of the Dunning prostatic carcinoma and that the combination of medroxyprogesterone acetate and estradiol was more efficient in that respect than estradiol alone. Morphometric evaluation of the tumor epithelium and stroma showed a decrement of epithelial growth in all treatment groups, while the groups treated with medroxyprogesterone acetate, both alone or in combination with estradiol, also showed an inhibited growth of the tumor stroma. It was concluded that medroxyprogesterone acetate probably has direct inhibitory effects on prostatic tumor cells in the Dunning model and that medroxyprogesterone acetate may act in an additive manner with estradiol.\r"

The present study was undertaken to evaluate the use of fibrin glue (\"Tisseel\", Immuno U.S., Inc.) for vasovasostomy and to compare this technique to conventional sutured vasovasostomy. Utilizing 60 male Sprague Dawley rats, a conventional two layered sutured anastomosis of vasovasostomy (30 rats) was compared to a fibrin glue technique of vasal anastomosis (30 rats). The fibrin glue technique was performed with two transmural sutures, was unstented, and utilized the biological glue to seal the anastomosis. The contralateral vas of each animal underwent vasectomy and reapproximation of unligated ends so that the rate of spontaneous recanalization could be accessed. Rats were sacrificed at 24 hours, one week, four weeks, and three months postvasovasostomy. The vasal specimens were evaluated for gross patency, presence and size of sperm granuloma, mean flow rates at varying infusion pressures, tensile strength measurements and histologic studies. Combining the one and three month groups, a similar patency rate was obtained by either technique; 83% (n = 18) for the sutured group, and 90% (n = 21) for the fibrin glue group. The rate of spontaneous recanalization of the contralateral vasa in the one and three month animals was 8% (n = 38). The mean flow rates obtained at high and low infusion pressures were not statistically different for the two techniques. The tensile strength of the glue anastomosis averaged 78% of the tensile strength achieved by the conventional sutured technique. The incidence of sperm granuloma after vasovasostomy was 28% for the fibrin glue group and 61% for the sutured group. Additionally, 67% of granulomas were small (less than 3 mm.) in the glue group, compared to only 36% in the sutured group. Histology revealed similar morphological changes in the area of anastomosis with either technique. Operative time for sutured vasovasostomy averaged 24 minutes, compared to an average of 11 minutes for the glue assisted vasovasostomy. The use of fibrin glue allowed the performance of a sperm tight patent anastomosis that had the advantages of reduced incidence of sperm granuloma formation, reduced operative time, and less microsurgical skill required to perform the anastomosis.\r"

The veins were studied histologically and immunohistochemically for serotonin, dopamine beta-hydroxylase, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, neuropeptide Y, substance P, calcitonin gene-related peptide, somatostatin, and [Leu]- and [Met]enkephalin. Histologically, the deep dorsal vein was found to be a large muscular vein with a thin endothelial lining. The tunica media was composed of an inner longitudinally and an outer circularly arranged smooth muscle layer. Numerous vasa vasorum (up to 30 in a single transverse section) were found in the tunica adventitia. The greatest density of nerves supplying the deep dorsal vein and vasa vasorum were neuropeptide Y-immunoreactive nerves followed (in a decreasing order) by vasoactive intestinal polypeptide- and dopamine beta-hydroxylase-immunoreactive nerves. Substance P-, calcitonin gene-related peptide- and somatostatin-immunoreactive nerves, but not serotonin-, [Leu]- and [Met]enkephalin-immunoreactive nerves, were occasionally found around the deep dorsal vein. All these nerve fibers were confined to the adventitial-medial border except neuropeptide Y-immunoreactive nerves which in addition penetrated the tunica media to the subendothelial layer of the deep dorsal vein. In contrast, neuropeptide Y-immunoreactive nerves supplying the vasa vasorum were always confined to the adventitial-medial border. The possible function of the medial innervation of the deep dorsal vein by neuropeptide Y-immunoreactive nerves is discussed.\r"

Thirty mice were scheduled for imaging at six, 14, 18 and 21 days after tumor implantation. Using a volume imaging coil, MRI demonstrated very early orthotopic tumors, the detection of which would otherwise have been impossible by clinical signs only. Sequential accurate assessment of tumor size was achieved by inflation of the bladders with a fixed volume of Gadolinium-DTPA contrast. The presence of established MBT-2 intravesical tumors was confirmed by gross pathology and light microscopy of the corresponding whole mount bladder sections. Histological examination of the corresponding tumor specimens revealed the presence of transitional cell bladder carcinoma which correlated very well with the topography and depth of tumor involvement as indicated on MRI. The The mice tolerated repeated MR imaging well. Early tumors at day 14 were detectable on MRI (with serial tumor growth to day 21), with no clinical signs of disease. In a subsequent study, response to intravesical tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) immunotherapy was monitored with serial MRI. The serial MR images from six tumor-bearing mice (three controls and three TNF-alpha treated) have been selected to illustrate the consistent findings of this study. Sequential MRI scans of TNF-alpha treated mice revealed retardation of tumor growth that correlated well with the corresponding histologic examination. The orthotopic tumor and MRI model described is ideal for preclinical evaluation of new potential intravesical chemotherapy and immunotherapy agents.\r"

  ".W": "To determine whether in a mouse model of ascending, unobstructed urinary tract infection an inoculum volume could be found that induces vesicoureteral reflux without causing renal injury, the occurrence of vesicoureteral reflux (identified by inspection, kidney culture, and histopathologic examination) was compared with the occurrence of renal trauma (identified by histopathologic examination and cultures of blood and spleen) in female Swiss Webster mice after transurethral inoculation with 50, 75, 100 or 150 microliters of a bacterial suspension containing India ink. Vesicoureteral reflux (which was more common the greater the inoculum volume) induced renal trauma even with small (50 microliters) inoculum volumes, accounting for the observed association of inoculum volume and renal injury. No single parameter of vesicoureteral reflux identified all refluxed or traumatized kidneys. Thus, careful attention to the avoidance of vesicoureteral reflux following inoculation, using multiple indicators of reflux, is needed if this model is to faithfully reproduce infections occurring in the nontraumatized human urinary tract.\r"

The glycoprotein fibronectin is associated with laminin and Type IV collagen in the bladder basement membrane. We characterized the interaction between T-24 cells, a cell line derived from an invasive transitional cell tumor, and fibronectin. The cells use the alpha 5 beta 1 heterodimeric integrin receptor complex to mediate adherence via the classical (RGDS) fibronectin binding site. The importance of the alpha 5 beta 1 receptor to T-24 function is unknown and under investigation.\r"

  ".W": "Mechanisms by which intravesical bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) treatment mediates antitumor activity are currently poorly understood. We have determined that both human bladder tumor (T-24) and mouse bladder tumor (MBT-2) cells are capable of internalizing the BCG and have characterized this process in vitro. The internalization of BCG by T-24 and MBT-2 cells was verified by histochemistry and electron microscopy. Time dependent internalization of BCG was observed with a maximum occurring at three hrs. Internalization was significantly inhibited by both incubation at 4C and cytochalasin B; conditions known to inhibit phagocytosis. Ultrastructural studies suggested that BCG were transported to membrane bound intracellular compartments and were degraded. The compartments containing the degraded mycobacteria labeled with the fluid phase marker HRP which is known to be transported to lysosomes in a variety of cell types. To determine if the internalization process occurred in vivo, we examined bladder washings of patients treated with intravesical BCG. The majority of the cells in the bladder washings were inflammatory cells which contained ingested BCG. In addition, internalized and degraded BCG were identified in urothelial cells. These data demonstrate that BCG are internalized by transitional epithelial cells both in vitro and in vivo. The internalization process is inhibitable by temperature and microfilament disruption. The potential therapeutic implications of this process and its relationship to antitumor activity of BCG therapy are currently being investigated.\r"
