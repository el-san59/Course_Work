Controversy surrounds the approach to zone II injuries; mandatory versus selective exploration. On the basis of an extensive literature review, the authors conclude that neither approach is obviously superior. A selective approach is safe in the asymptomatic and hemodynamically stable patient, provided that accurate invasive diagnostic means are immediately available. The mandatory approach is safe, reliable, and time tested. The greatest problem appears to be the accuracy of detection of cervical esophageal injuries: Radiologic evaluation may be inaccurate, rigid esophagoscopy carries a risk of perforation, and the injury may easily be overlooked during surgical exploration.\r"

Many factors involved in the initial resuscitation of the multiply injured patient, such as altered level of consciousness, hemodynamic instability, or inexperience and diagnostic oversight, may lead to missed injuries. Injuries may be missed at any stage of the management of the trauma patient, including intraoperatively, and may involve all regions of the body. Established protocols in the initial management of the multiply injured patient, such as the primary and secondary surveys of the Advanced Trauma Life Support Course, will minimize the chance of missing immediately life-threatening injuries in the emergency department. A careful intraoperative approach must be used in all patients, but especially in those with hemodynamic instability, so that all areas are examined for possible injury, rather than concentrating simply on what is known to be injured. Use of the tertiary survey, a careful re-examination of the multiply injured trauma patient, especially when he or she awakes, will help detect injuries missed during the initial evaluation. Injuries will be missed. Rather than dismissing these as occurrences that happen only to the inexperienced or incompetent, one should approach the multiply injured trauma patient with both special alertness and the humility necessary to search for diagnostic oversights. This approach will lead to early discovery of missed injuries and will minimize the consequences.\r"

Patients with an elevated blood pressure, an abnormal initial computed tomogram, or a history of diabetes mellitus were at a higher risk of stroke recurrence. In contrast, patients with an infarct of unknown cause were at a lower risk of stroke recurrence than patients with a defined stroke mechanism, such as lacune, embolism, or atherosclerosis. A multivariate model suggests that patients at the lowest risk for stroke recurrence have a low diastolic blood pressure, no history of stroke, no history of diabetes mellitus, and an infarct of unknown cause.\r"

It has been argued that viscous abnormalities simply reflect either elevated hematocrit or an acute-phase response to the stroke itself. To address these issues, we measured the factors that determine blood viscosity in a cross-sectional study of 430 subjects, including 135 with acute stroke, 89 with acute transient ischemic attacks of the brain, 115 with recognized risk factors for stroke, and 91 healthy controls. The at-risk group was balanced with the acute stroke group for types of risk factors and medication usage, and all four groups were balanced for age. The viscosity of whole blood at low rates of shear and the plasma viscosity were significantly elevated in both groups with cerebrovascular symptoms and in the at-risk group compared with the healthy controls. The severity of hyperviscosity was stroke group greater than transient ischemic attack group greater than at-risk group greater than healthy controls. Increased viscosity of whole blood was associated with an elevated plasma fibrinogen concentration and with a decreased albumin/globulin ratio. This study provides evidence that blood hyperviscosity is present not only in subjects with acute brain infarction, but also in those with risk factors for stroke, and that these abnormalities are, to a considerable degree, chronic.\r"

The atrial fibrillation group included a higher frequency of women, older subjects, and those with a severe neurologic deficit, abnormal computed tomogram, and elevated heart rate. The 1-month case-fatality rate in the atrial fibrillation group was 27% while that in the group without atrial fibrillation was 14%. The 6-month case-fatality rates in the two groups were 40% and 20%, respectively. The risk of death attributable to atrial fibrillation, adjusted for the effect of other prognostic factors, was significant at 1 month (relative risk = 1.55) and at 6 months (relative risk = 1.74). The causes of death were equally distributed in the two groups during both the acute and subacute phases. We conclude that atrial fibrillation is a negative prognostic factor in patients hospitalized for acute stroke. Nevertheless, cerebral embolism alone does not completely explain the increase in mortality for stroke patients with atrial fibrillation. Other associated pathogenetic mechanisms must also be taken into account.\r"

We analyzed the 316 patients with classic lacunar syndromes. Among these, 181 (57%) had pure motor hemiparesis, 63 (20%) sensorimotor syndrome, 33 (10%) ataxic hemiparesis, 21 (7%) pure sensory syndrome, and 18 (6%) dysarthria-clumsy hand syndrome. No striking differences were found among the risk factors for the lacunar subtypes, but differences were found between lacunar stroke as a group and other types of infarcts. Compared to 113 patients with large-vessel atherosclerotic infarction, those with lacunar stroke had fewer previous transient ischemic attacks and strokes. Compared to 246 with cardioembolic infarction, patients with lacunar stroke more frequently had hypertension and diabetes and less frequently had cardiac disease. We found a lesion in 35% of the lacunar stroke patients' computed tomograms, with most lesions located in the internal capsule and corona radiata. The mean infarct volume was greater in patients with pure motor hemiparesis or sensorimotor syndrome than in those with the other lacunar stroke subtypes. In patients with pure motor hemiparesis and infarcts in the posterior limb of the internal capsule, there was a correlation between lesion volume and hemiparesis severity except for the few whose infarct involved the lowest portion of the internal capsule; in these patients severe deficits occurred regardless of lesion volume. Taken together, the computed tomographic correlations with the syndromes of hemiparesis showed only slight support for the classical view of a homunculus in the internal capsule.\r"

With the exception of three patients, all 104 patients received antifibrinolytic treatment. Delayed clinical deterioration from acute hydrocephalus occurred in seven (29%) of the 24 patients with acute hydrocephalus on admission and in six (8%) of the remaining 80 patients. Serial lumbar puncture was performed in 17 patients. Twelve (71%) of the 17 patients treated with serial lumbar puncture, including 10 (77%) of the 13 patients with delayed deterioration from acute hydrocephalus after admission, achieved improvement in the level of consciousness. Four of these 17 patients (4% of all 104 patients) required an internal shunt. No patient deteriorated from coning following serial lumbar puncture. The rebleeding rate within 12 days after subarachnoid hemorrhage in hydrocephalic patients with serial lumbar puncture was not higher than the rate in those without hydrocephalus (two [12%] of 17 versus nine [13%] of 71). Neither meningitis nor ventriculitis was observed. We conclude that if neither a hematoma with a mass effect nor an obstructive element exists, cerebrospinal fluid drainage with serial lumbar puncture is a good alternative to ventricular drainage in patients with acute hydrocephalus after subarachnoid hemorrhage.\r"

Mortality of patients with conjugate eye deviation was higher (41%) than for the general stroke population (34%), but this difference was not statistically significant (p less than 0.179). Looking at mortality and disability together, we found the outcome of patients with conjugate eye deviation to be significantly worse (p less than 0.001). Deviation of the eyes occurred more frequently to the right (65%) than to the left (35%). In the patient group with eye deviation to the left, mortality was significantly higher (64%, p less than 0.001) than in the group with eye deviation to the right (25%); only two patients of the former group (n = 28) could return home. Compared to the Tilburg epidemiological study of stroke, the group with eye deviation to the left did significantly worse, both for mortality alone (p less than 0.001) and for mortality and disability together (p less than 0.001). The group with eye deviation to the right did significantly worse only for mortality and disability together (p less than 0.01). Our results indicate that conjugate eye deviation is a prognostic factor for poor short-term mortality and disability in stroke patients, especially when the eyes are deviated to the left.\r"

Twenty-three percent (82 of 353) had atrial fibrillation or flutter on their admission electrocardiogram. This group differed significantly from that with sinus rhythm in three respects: 1) They were older (p less than 0.01); 2) they had more severe current stroke deficit as evidenced by lower limb power (p less than 0.05) and Mini-Mental State Score (p less than 0.001), higher incidence of homonomous hemianopia (p less than 0.05), and lower incidence of lacunar syndrome stroke (p less than 0.001); and 3) they had a significantly higher incidence of cardiomegaly and congestive heart failure (p less than 0.01). Functional outcome was insignificantly better in the group with sinus rhythm. During a mean follow-up period of 18 months, mortality was significantly higher in the group with atrial fibrillation (p = 0.001). Proportional hazards modeling, however, showed that the apparently poorer survival in those patients with atrial fibrillation could be explained by factors other than cardiac rhythm, such as age, Mini-Mental State Score, level of consciousness, and interstitial edema on admission chest radiograph. Thus, atrial fibrillation was not an independent predictor of survival after stroke.\r"

Contractions evoked by 10(-5) M serotonin were attenuated by cromakalim in a concentration-dependent manner (p less than 0.05). The diameter of untreated superior cerebellar arteries remained almost constant with increasing perfusion pressure. However, in the presence of cromakalim vessel diameter increased with increasing perfusion pressure. At concentrations of 3 x 10(-6) M, cromakalim also inhibited basal myogenic tone and dilated unstimulated arteries (p less than 0.01).

  ".W": "To provide further evidence that the multiple cerebral infarcts found in rats following photochemical damage to the carotid artery are caused by emboli and to eliminate the systemic hypotension and heating of the blood reported with the previous photochemical embolic stroke model (rose bengal and a green laser), I have modified the photochemical technique. Brain pathology was studied in 18 Wistar rats following carotid artery irradiation with a red laser (632 nm) at powers ranging from 100 to 800 mW/cm2 for 10 or 20 minutes following the injection of the photosensitizing dye Photofrin II. Multiple cerebral arterioles were occluded by platelet aggregates containing frequent erythrocytes and leukocytes, identical to the thrombotic material in the carotid artery but different from the platelet aggregates seen in the carotid artery and the brain in the rose bengal model. Eighty infarcts were distributed randomly throughout the brain ipsilateral to the nonocclusive carotid thrombus. Significant heating (0.5 degree C or more) of the blood occurred only with laser powers higher (1,600 mW/cm2) or laser irradiations longer (25 minutes) than those used in the improved model of embolic stroke. This model mimics one mechanism of stroke in humans and provides a means to study systematically the morphological evolution of small cerebral infarcts.\r"

  ".W": "We tested the hypotheses that with the onset of cerebral ischemia, massive cellular sodium influx does not occur until adenosine triphosphate is fully depleted and that on reperfusion, neuronal sodium efflux does not occur until adenosine triphosphate is fully restored. We examined the temporal relationships among transcellular sodium, energy metabolism, and intracellular pH with sodium and phosphorus magnetic resonance spectroscopy in a new, hemodynamically stable, brain stem-sparing model of reversible, complete cerebral ischemia in eight anesthetized dogs. Inflation of a neck tourniquet after placement of glue at the tip of the basilar artery resulted in decreased blood flow to the cerebrum from 29 +/- 5 to 0.3 +/- 0.5 ml/min/100 g. Medullary blood flow was not significantly affected, and arterial blood pressure was unchanged. Sodium signal intensity decreased and did not lag behind the fall in adenosine triphosphate. After 12 minutes of ischemia, reperfusion resulted in a more rapid recovery of sodium intensity (12.4 +/- 4.8 minutes) than either adenosine triphosphate (16.5 +/- 3.7 minutes) or intracellular pH (38.9 +/- 1.8 minutes). Because intracellular sodium has a weaker signal than extracellular sodium, the decreased sodium intensity is interpreted as sodium influx and indicates that sodium influx does not require full depletion of adenosine triphosphate. Rapid recovery of sodium intensity during early reperfusion may represent sodium efflux, although increased plasma volume and sodium uptake from plasma may also contribute. If our interpretation of the sodium signal is correct, delayed recovery of adenosine triphosphate may be due to the utilization of adenosine triphosphate for the restoration of transcellular sodium gradient.\r"

  ".W": "We assessed the value of pretreatment with clentiazem (8-chlorodiltiazem), a diltiazem derivative with cerebroselective properties, on the consequences of surgical occlusion of the middle cerebral artery via a transorbital approach in 38 rabbits. Nineteen rabbits received 1.7 (n = 5), 5 (n = 8), or 15 (n = 6) mg/kg clentiazem orally four times a day for 24 hours before and 48 hours after occlusion. Upon sacrifice, a segment of the right middle cerebral artery distal to the occlusion and a corresponding segment from the nonoccluded left middle cerebral artery were mounted on myographs for in vitro study of their reactivity to histamine, acetylcholine, serotonin, norepinephrine, and electrical stimulation of intramural sympathetic nerves. Morphometric measurements of 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride-stained brain slices permitted us to estimate infarct volume. Pretreatment with 1.7, 5, and 15 mg/kg clentiazem significantly reduced infarct volume (p less than 0.05, p less than 0.01, and p less than 0.01, respectively). Mean infarct volume of the 15 mg/kg-treated group was only 4% that of the untreated group. There were no postoperative deaths in any treated group compared with a death rate of 36% in the untreated group. Mean values for vascular smooth muscle contractility to histamine and relaxation to acetylcholine were significantly enhanced in vessels from treated rabbits. These studies indicate that pretreatment with clentiazem offers cerebral protection and significantly reduces infarct volume as well as arterial wall damage beyond the occlusion.\r"

  ".W": "The basilar artery is one of the three major sources of blood supply to the circle of Willis. To investigate the effects of basilar artery occlusion, we surgically exposed and coagulated the basilar artery in 25 rats. Basilar artery occlusion at any single point between the foramen magnum and the circle of Willis in 11 rats did not produce histologically detectable infarcts in the brain at 12-24 hours. Two-point occlusions of the basilar artery in 12 rats produced variable infarcts between the occlusion sites but no ischemic lesions elsewhere. After either single- or double-point occlusions, the proximal basilar artery refilled within 2-3 minutes. When the basilar artery was occluded above and below the origins of the anterior inferior cerebellar arteries, the artery segments between the occlusion points initially collapsed but refilled within 2-3 minutes in two rats. Basilar artery occlusions invariably suppressed cortical somatosensory evoked potentials by greater than 50%. Regardless of whether a brain stem infarct developed, somatosensory evoked potential amplitudes recovered to greater than baseline levels by 4 hours in seven of 17 rats and returned to baseline levels by 24 hours in every rat tested. We conclude that the occluded basilar artery receives extensive retrograde collateral blood flow and that somatosensory evoked potentials are exquisitely sensitive to basilar artery occlusion but are insensitive to whether brain stem infarcts develop.\r"

Emboli introduced into the rabbit aorta via the left renal artery consisted of clotted whole blood, platelets, atheromatous material, fat, or air. The ultrasound examination was carried out continuously during the studies using a multifrequency transcranial Doppler apparatus with a 2-MHz probe, a sample volume of 15 mm, at a depth of 15 mm. The intensity of the Doppler spectrum was measured and displayed as a 15-shade color scale, each shade representing a 3-dB difference. The diameter of the aorta at the site of the ultrasound examination was similar to the diameter of the middle cerebral artery in humans. All 125 emboli introduced were clearly detected because they caused a Doppler signal at least 15 dB greater than that of the surrounding blood. These results show that the potential for emboli detection using Doppler ultrasound in the clinical situation is now considerable.\r"

We compared microscopic MR images of rat brains after focal cerebral ischemia with evidence of histological damage found on corresponding silver-impregnated or cresyl violet-stained brain sections. Ten male Wistar rats were subjected to permanent unilateral occlusions of the right middle cerebral and common carotid arteries under halothane anesthesia. Twenty-four hours later the area of injury on MR images amounted to 26% of the total slice area, whereas only 9% of the total slice area was necrotic on histological sections from the same animals. The infarcted areas on tissue sections were surrounded by regions of selective neuronal injury in the cerebral cortex and occasionally in the hippocampus. The area of injury on MR images was larger than the combined areas of infarction and selective neuronal injury on histological sections. Areas of increased T2 values on MR images extended medially into noninfarcted striatum and laterally and dorsally into noninfarcted cortex. The lateral and dorsal areas on MR images frequently coincided with cortical areas in which considerable selective neuronal injury was present in the upper cortical layers. We hypothesize that the abnormal areas on MR images above histologically normal brain tissue represent the ischemic penumbra. If true, this is the first demonstration of the ischemic penumbra by MR imaging and may reflect our use of Wistar rats, a new image analysis technique, and ultra-high resolution MR imaging.\r"

Blacks were at higher hospitalization risk than whites for hemorrhagic cerebrovascular disease (relative risk = 2.4, 95% confidence interval = 1.3-5.8), cerebral thrombosis (relative risk = 1.9, 95% confidence interval = 1.2-2.9), and nonspecific cerebrovascular disease (relative risk = 1.6, 95% confidence interval = 1.2-2.2) but at lower hospitalization risk for extracranial occlusive disease (relative risk = 0.4, 95% confidence interval = 0.2-0.7). Blood pressure had a similar relation to all types of cerebrovascular disease in both races, but there were disparities in the relations of other atherosclerosis risk factors to different types of cerebrovascular disease. Educational attainment had little relation to hospitalization for extracranial occlusive disease, a finding that reduces the likelihood that selection bias explains the racial disparity. These data show unexplained racial differences in the type and location of cerebrovascular disease. The differences are important in understanding the pathogenesis of cerebrovascular disease and have practical clinical implications.\r"

Outcome after cerebral infarction differed by ethnicity. The 1-month mortality rate was similar in whites and blacks and least in Hispanics. Whites had a slightly greater risk of recurrent stroke or death than blacks or Hispanics until 6 months after infarction, when their risk stabilized, while the risk in blacks and Hispanics continued to rise for the entire year of follow-up. By 1 year, the rate of recurrent stroke or death was 34.8 +/- 4.2% in whites, 31.1 +/- 3.6% in blacks, and 21.4 +/- 4.8% in Hispanics (p = 0.04). Differences were found in the distribution of various stroke risk factors in the three ethnic groups. A Cox proportional hazards model demonstrated that the ethnic differences in stroke risk factors and infarct subtype were responsible for the ethnic differences in outcome. An abnormal first electrocardiogram was a risk factor for stroke recurrence or death in all three ethnic groups, while a nonlacunar infarct subtype and a history of diabetes were significant only in Hispanics. Understanding the associations of stroke determinants with ethnicity may lead to more focused secondary prevention of recurrent stroke.\r"

The stroke risk factors included in the profile are age, systolic blood pressure, the use of antihypertensive therapy, diabetes mellitus, cigarette smoking, prior cardiovascular disease (coronary heart disease, cardiac failure, or intermittent claudication), atrial fibrillation, and left ventricular hypertrophy by electrocardiogram. Based on 472 stroke events occurring during 10 years' follow-up from biennial examinations 9 and 14, stroke probabilities were computed using the Cox proportional hazards model for each sex based on a point system. On the basis of the risk factors in the profile, which can be readily determined on routine physical examination in a physician's office, stroke risk can be estimated. An individual's risk can be related to the average risk of stroke for persons of the same age and sex. The information that one's risk of stroke is several times higher than average may provide the impetus for risk factor modification. It may also help to identify persons at substantially increased stroke risk resulting from borderline levels of multiple risk factors such as those with mild or borderline hypertension and facilitate multifactorial risk factor modification.\r"

Following its application to the surface of the middle cerebral artery, the retrograde axonal tracer True Blue accumulated in parasympathetic neurons of the sphenopalatine ganglion and the internal carotid ganglion. The latter is strategically located where the internal carotid artery enters the cranium. Fibers from the sphenopalatine ganglion reach the internal carotid artery in the cavernous sinus region after running as rami orbitales. Before reaching the internal carotid artery, the fibers bypass aberrant sphenopalatine ganglia, with the most distant, the cavernous ganglion, being located in the cavernous sinus region. True Blue also accumulated in sensory neurons of the ophthalmic and maxillary divisions of the trigeminal ganglion and in sensory neurons of the internal carotid ganglion. Fibers from the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal ganglion reach the internal carotid artery as a branch through the cavernous sinus, bypassing the cavernous ganglion. Fibers from the maxillary division also bypass the cavernous ganglion after reaching it via a recurrent branch of the orbitociliary nerve. Thus, the cavernous ganglion forms a confluence zone for parasympathetic and sensory fibers in the region. In addition, parasympathetic and sensory fibers leave the confluence zone to follow the abducent and trochlear nerves backward to the basilar artery and tentorium cerebelli, respectively. Clinical implications are discussed.\r"

Dextromethorphan-treated animals (n = 10) showed less lactate formation during ischemia than untreated animals (n = 11, p less than 0.001). During reperfusion, the lactate level in the treated group was reduced (p less than 0.05). Tissue pH declined less in the treated group during ischemia (p less than 0.01). There was no difference in the phosphocreatine/inorganic phosphate peak height ratio between groups. During ischemia, the N-acetylaspartate resonance peaks decreased in both groups. Histologic damage assessed in the hippocampal CA1 region 7 days after the ischemic insult was more severe in the untreated group (p less than 0.05). There was a significant correlation between end-ischemic tissue pH and hippocampal damage (r = -0.73, p less than 0.05). In the dextromethorphan-treated animals, 90% of the rats survived compared with 47% of the untreated animals (p less than 0.05). These results support findings in previous studies that dextromethorphan attenuates ischemic damage.\r"

These values were significantly different from those at baseline and from the responses of 10 control rabbits given equivalent intracarotid saline infusions. Twelve other rabbits were made leukopenic by treatment with 1.5 mg/kg i.v. mechlorethamine 72 hours prior to study. Mean +/- SEM leukocyte count decreased from 6,320 +/- 73/mm3 to 1,890 +/- 66/mm3 without any change in the leukocyte differential or erythrocyte and platelet counts. Intracarotid infusion of saline into seven of the leukopenic rabbits caused no changes. In the other five leukopenic rabbits, infusion of 400 microliters air caused air embolism but did not produce the anticipated declines in cerebral blood flow or the cortical somatosensory evoked response, both of which remained indistinguishable from baseline values and responses in the seven saline-treated leukopenic controls. Similarly, air-embolized arterioles showed nonsignificant dilatation in leukopenic rabbits. Our data suggest that the decreases in both cerebral blood flow and brain function seen after air embolism require the presence of leukocytes.\r"

Previous studies have documented cerebroprotective effect in animal models of both focal and global ischemia. The present study was undertaken to define the postischemic \"window\" of therapeutic efficacy for this agent. Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to permanent proximal middle cerebral artery occlusion, combined with an initial 30-minute period of halothane-induced hypotension (50 mm Hg). (S)-Emopamil (20 mg/kg) was administered intraperitoneally either 20-30 minutes prior to middle cerebral artery occlusion or 1 hour, 2 hours, or 3 hours following occlusion. Treated groups received a second similar dose 2.5 hours later and twice daily for 2 days thereafter. Brains were perfusion-fixed on the third day. Planimetric analysis of hemotoxylin and eosin-stained coronal brain sections documented a cortical infarct averaging 72.9 +/- 33.3 mm3 (mean +/- SD) in untreated rats. Cortical infarct volume was reduced by 48% (to 37.6 +/- 27.6 mm3) when therapy was initiated 1 hour postischemia (p less than 0.05). When treatment was deferred to 2 hours postichemia, mean cortical infarct volume was reduced by 34%, but this difference did not attain statistical significance. Infarct volume in rats with treatment initiated at 3 hours postischemia was indistinguishable from that in controls. Striatal infarct volume was similar in all groups. These results document a postischemic therapeutic window of cerebroprotection for (S)-emopamil lying between 1 and 2 hours after middle cerebral artery occlusion.\r"

Male gerbils were treated with either 0.2 ml vehicle (0.05N HCl) or 10 mg/kg i.p. U-74006F 10 minutes before the induction of ischemia and again immediately after the initiation of reperfusion. In the first series of experiments, the brain concentration of vitamin E, which was unaffected by ischemia without reperfusion, was decreased after 2 hours of reperfusion by an average of 60% in vehicle-treated animals compared with sham-operated animals; in the U-74006F-treated gerbils, the 2-hour postischemic vitamin E loss was only 27% (p less than 0.002 different from vehicle-treated animals). In the second series, unilateral carotid artery occlusion produced a decrease in the cortical extracellular calcium concentration from 1.05 mM before ischemia to 0.11 mM by the end of the ischemic episode in both vehicle- and U-74006F-treated gerbils. After 2 hours of reperfusion, the calcium concentration had recovered to only 0.22 mM in the vehicle-treated animals compared with 0.56 mM in the U-74006F-treated group (p less than 0.01). Cortical blood flow, mean arterial blood pressure, and blood gases did not differ significantly between the two treatment groups. Administration of only the immediate postreperfusion dose (i.e., no pretreatment) also significantly improved the recovery of cortical extracellular calcium. The results indicate that U-74006F inhibits postischemic lipid peroxidation as assessed by the preservation of brain vitamin E and that, secondary to this membrane-protective effect, the processes responsible for the reversal of ischemia-triggered intracellular calcium accumulation are preserved.\r"

To determine arterial intimal platelet accumulation in each cat, we injected [111In]oxine-labeled platelets intravenously immediately before injecting the various experimental solutions. Animals were sacrificed 2 or 4 hours following the injection of labeled platelets. Irrigation with washed red blood cells produced a significantly greater intraluminal accumulation of platelets than irrigation with saline (p less than 0.05). Plasma tended to have less of an effect on platelet accumulation than washed red blood cells, but this difference was not significant. These data suggest that the adventitial blood fraction responsible for intimal platelet accumulation in cerebral arteries following subarachnoid hemorrhage may be derived mainly from the red blood cell fraction.\r"

The intraluminal and extraluminal sides of a cylindrical section of rabbit basilar artery were isolated completely. By loading with 0.75 g of tension, the resting condition of each preparation was made constant. The intraluminal side was perfused at a constant flow of 8 ml/min and under an intraluminal pressure of 8 mm Hg. When 30 mM KCl was administered intraluminally the preparation showed marked contraction, whereas only slight contraction was observed with extraluminal administration. When 2 x 10(-7) M 5-hydroxytryptamine was administered, no significant differences in contraction could be detected between the intraluminal and extraluminal routes. Application of 10(-6) to 10(-4) M acetylcholine after precontraction with 30 mM KCl resulted in much stronger dilatation upon intraluminal application. Thus, it was demonstrated that under certain conditions significant differences exist in the responses of rabbit basilar arteries to vasoactive agents applied intraluminally or extraluminally. This system can detect the effects of vasoactive agents administered intraluminally and extraluminally at a high level of sensitivity and shows good reproducibility as a means of analyzing vascular functions and characteristics.\r"

The \"risk period\" for this insult is the first 3-4 postnatal days. We hypothesized that this risk period for hemorrhage is related to rapid perinatal maturation of the germinal matrix vasculature and employed the newborn beagle pup model for the study of this maturation. Newborn beagle pups (n = 30) were anesthetized and systemically perfused with buffered formalin; the brains were removed and prepared for immunohistochemical study. Sections stained with Bandeiraea lectin demonstrated that there was no difference in germinal matrix vessel density between postnatal days 1 and 4. Germinal matrix sections were also stained for antibodies to alpha-smooth muscle actin, collagen IV, collagen V, desmin, factor VIII-related antigen, fibronectin, glial fibrillary acidic protein, laminin, transferrin, and vimentin. Vasculature staining by alpha-smooth muscle actin was not noted until postnatal day 10, and differential staining was detected for antibodies to laminin and collagen V. Quantification of staining intensity by confocal microscopy demonstrated a significant increase in both extracellular matrix components at postnatal day 4 compared with day 1 (p less than 0.05 for both). These basement membrane proteins may add sufficient structural integrity to germinal matrix vessels to prevent capillary rupture and thus intraventricular hemorrhage.\r"

A subsequent, prospective review of 100 patients undergoing cranial magnetic resonance imaging showed the presence of similarly bifurcated superior sagittal sinuses in two.

However, under certain circumstances, this test may show unwanted negative or weak results, even though the red cells (RBCs) and serum being tested are ABO incompatible with each other. The present study investigated the potential effect of delayed centrifugation or reading on the IS crossmatch test performance. When the centrifugation step of the IS crossmatch between group O sera and group A1 RBCs was delayed for 2 minutes, 5 of 200 crossmatches showed no agglutination with only trace (n = 2) or moderate (n = 3) hemolysis, and one crossmatch showed only weak, macroscopic agglutination, but moderate hemolysis. All six sera contained A antibodies that were lytic in vitro and, therefore, probably were capable of causing in vivo hemolysis of transfused A1 RBCs. Delaying the reading of the IS crossmatch test for 2 minutes had no apparent effect on test performance. These data demonstrate the importance of technologists' recognition of hemolysis as a positive result on IS crossmatches, especially if the performance of the centrifugation step of the test is delayed. Furthermore, the unwanted negative agglutination results were abolished by suspending the group A1 RBCs in saline containing EDTA. The authors' laboratory has modified its IS crossmatch procedure so that donor RBCs are routinely suspended in saline containing EDTA before testing. This procedural change should increase the safety of the IS crossmatch.\r"

Of the 3858 units of blood collected, 112 (2.9%), obtained from 64 donors, had an alanine aminotransferase (ALT) activity over 45 IU per L; of these, 39 had a single ALT elevation. The incidence of ALT increase was 2.01 per 100 units, or 5.1 per 100 donors, per year. The pattern of elevated ALT was followed in 72 donors, 54 of whom were from the 64 cited above. At the second blood donation (BD2), about 5 months later, 62.5 percent had a normal ALT value, and most (91%) retained those values at blood donation 3 (BD3). However, 19 (70.3%) of the 27 whose ALT levels had not returned to normal at BD2 had an increased value at BD3. These results led to the formulation of the following algorithm to improve the management of blood donors; at the first donation, the ALT assay is done after the blood collection, but, at the next donation, the ALT level is measured before donation if the preceding ALT activity had been abnormal. If ALT is elevated, blood is not collected. Three consecutive ALT elevations are a criterion for permanent exclusion of the donor.\r"

No nef antibody was found in seronegative at-risk individuals or seronegative controls, but 44 (47%) of 92 HIV-1-seropositive persons had nef antibodies. These findings do not support the existence of frequent HIV-1 infection in seronegative at-risk individuals.\r"

  ".W": "Homologous blood transfusions have been associated in both animals and humans with an increased risk of acute postoperative infectious complications. Eighty-four patients who underwent hip replacement surgery and were transfused with 2 or 3 units of blood were analyzed to determine whether those receiving homologous transfusions had different outcomes than those receiving autologous blood only. Only patients free of other risks for postoperative infection were studied. Those receiving homologous blood had a 32 percent (16/50) rate of proven or suspected infections, which was significantly higher than the 3 percent (1/34) rate in patients receiving autologous blood (p = 0.0029). Wound infections accounted for only a minority (6/17) of the proven or suspected infections, which suggests that nonsurgical factors contributed to these complications. The patients identified as being infected required significantly more antibiotic therapy (mean, 7.6 days) and lengthier hospital stays (mean, 15.5 days) than the patients who remained free of evidence of infection (means: 2.3 days of antibiotics and 12.3 days in the hospital) (p = 0.0001 for each variable). Other potential risk factors for infection, such as duration of surgical procedure, advanced patient age, amount of blood loss, type of anesthesia, surgeon performing the operation, use of a cemented versus porous-coat prosthesis, leukocytopenia, anemia, and underlying medical diagnosis, did not account for the differences in infection rates seen in those receiving homologous and autologous transfusions. These results confirm previous reports of an increased risk of postoperative infection in patients receiving homologous transfusions. Homologous transfusion may contribute to an increased risk of infection by immunologic modulation of the recipient.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The total association index (TAI) of the RMA, expressing the number of RBCs adhering to or phagocytosed by 100 monocytes, indicated a potent inhibitory activity of DLE in the test system. TAI values of 100.4 +/- 20.1 (mean +/- SD) in the control sample, consisting of RBCs coated in vitro with anti-D, dropped to 4.0 +/- 2.1 when DLE was present in the assay medium at a concentration of 0.5 U per mL. Similar results were obtained with RBCs coated with IgG antibodies in vivo. The inhibition was dose dependent and was associated with a thermolabile component of DLE. This study establishes that DLE can modulate monocyte function by inhibiting the recognition of IgG sensitized red cells.\r"

  ".W": "The fourth component of human complement (C4) is one that is essential to the antibody-mediated classical activation pathway. C4d, present on all normal and most patient red cells (RBCs), may be detected by the human antisera anti-Rodgers (Rg) and -Chido (Ch). A study has been made of the Rg/Ch antigens on normal and patient RBCs in an attempt to understand the mechanism by which C4 is bound to normal RBCs in the absence of RBC antibodies (Abs). Because RBCs from C1q-deficient patients express Rg/Ch, it seems that C1q is not essential for C4 binding. Treatment of normal RBCs with proteolytic enzymes, including trypsin, eliminated positive reactions with anti-Rg/Ch even though the C4d fragment is considered to be resistant to cleavage by trypsin. By correlating agglutination reactions with numbers of bound C4d and C3d molecules, it is evident that both C4d and C3d were affected by trypsin treatment and that anti-Rg/Ch were not capable of agglutinating RBCs with less than 50 molecules of bound C4d. It is concluded that trypsin-sensitive and -insensitive RBC membrane structures may both act as acceptors for C4. RBCs with null phenotypes of the major blood group systems all expressed Rg/Ch antigens, so none of the structures that carry these antigens act preferentially as acceptors for C4.\r"

For insight into the clonal distribution of human RBC autoantibodies, serum fractions from 28 individuals with various forms of autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AHA) and two nonanemic individuals with positive direct antiglobulin tests were separated by isoelectric focusing (IEF), and RBC binding in each fraction was quantitated with a solid-phase radioimmunoassay. IEF fractions of serum from normal volunteers and patients with nonimmune hemolytic anemia served as controls. These studies indicate that RBC antibodies are found in a restricted number of IEF fractions in sera from some patients with immune hemolytic anemia. IEF fractions containing RBC-binding activity vary among patients with idiopathic AHA, and distinct patterns of binding activity are found in serum from some patients with AHA associated with alphamethyldopa and procainamide or with B-cell immunoproliferative diseases. These findings suggest that the mechanism leading to autoantibody production may differ among patients with the various forms of immune hemolytic anemia.\r"

However, most plateletpheresis concentrates are collected in ACD, and CMV antibody testing of ACD-stored products has not been systematically evaluated by PLA. Sera and ACD-stored platelet concentrate bag segments from 104 donors were tested by PLA and by a solid-phase fluorescence immunoassay (FIAX) as a reference standard for CMV-IgM and CMV-IgG antibodies. Sera were stored at both 4 and 22 degrees C and were tested on Days 1 and 5 of storage; segments were tested daily for 5 days. Of 63 donor samples (61%) that tested negative for CMV-IgG by FIAX, there were two false-positive results in bag segments by PLA testing, one on Day 1 and the other on Day 2 of storage. PLA testing was consistently positive in sera and segments in the 40 donors (38%) who tested positive for CMV-IgG by FIAX. Potential false-negative PLA results occurred in five bag segments derived from one donor whose serum gave equivocal CMV-IgG results on FIAX. The sensitivity and specificity of the PLA assay were 100 percent for donor sera tested at both 4 and 22 degrees C and 91.5 and 98.4 percent, respectively, for platelet bag segment tests. Although no donors positive for CMV-IgM were identified, 15 (14.4%) had equivocal IgM anti-CMV test results.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Donor room staff were surveyed at three donor centers, using confidential questionnaires, to identify their concerns and to evaluate factors associated with reduced anxiety toward autologous donors. Among respondents (n = 93), 58 percent had patient care experience within the last 5 years, which correlated with diminished concern about phlebotomizing cardiac patients (r = .21; p = 0.04). Fifty-seven percent of respondents had drawn blood from greater than 50 autologous donors. Surprisingly, the experience of drawing blood from relatively large numbers of autologous donors did not correlate with increased confidence in phlebotomizing pediatric, cardiac, and elderly patients (r = -.04; p = 0.75). Those respondents who felt that they had adequate medical support agreed with more liberal donor criteria and were more confident about phlebotomizing pediatric, cardiac, and elderly patients (r = -.32; p = 0.001). Those respondents who believed most strongly in the benefits of autologous transfusion had the least anxiety toward donors who were medically more complex (r = .39; p = 0.0001). It is concluded that, contrary to what might be expected, phlebotomizing large numbers of autologous donors does not reduce the anxiety of staff members when they encounter donors with complex medical problems. Factors that do reduce anxiety include dependable physician and other medical support services, previous experience in direct patient care, and knowledge of the benefits of autologous transfusion.\r"

A 51Cr red cell survival study performed 2 weeks after surgery yielded zero survival of Gerbich-positive cells after 24 hours. A monocyte-driven, antibody-dependent, cell-mediated cytotoxicity assay performed on both pretransfusion and posttransfusion serum samples and on concentrated serum showed less than 1 percent specific lysis of Gerbich-positive cells. This did not correlate with the indication of clinical significance predicted by the 51Cr study.

She was immunocompetent and was not treated with any immunosuppressive agents such as corticosteroids, chemotherapy, or irradiation therapy. The implicated donor was thought to be her daughter, who was homozygous for an HLA haplotype that was shared with the recipient: A24, Bw52, CBL, DR2. This is the most common haplotype in the Japanese population. This case and others in the Japanese literature indicate that the transfusion of fresh, nonirradiated blood that contains immunocompetent lymphocytes and peripheral hematopoietic precursor cells from HLA-homozygous donors can be lethal to the recipient.\r"

In this system, separated plasma is delivered to two staphylococcal protein A-Sepharose columns, which are coupled to an elution monitor. Columns are eluted sequentially and regenerated to maximize IgG removal. Successful removal of the inhibitor was accomplished in all six hemophiliacs on seven occasions, as well as in a patient with acquired von Willebrand disease. All patients whose inhibitors were lowered to less than 10 Bethesda units achieved measurable factor levels when factor concentrate replacement was given. Immunoadsorption facilitates efficient removal of inhibitors, which allows factor replacement therapy.\r"

Of note is the fact that a number of new donor screening tests, such as those for antibody to HIV, HBcAg, hepatitis C virus, and human T cell lymphotropic virus type I, have recently been implemented. In addition, rapid advances in the medical history screening of tissue donors and tissue procurement, processing, and preservation continue. Viral inactivation studies are also being undertaken.

After three days of intravenous therapy patients could be switched to oral ofloxacin. Microbiologic eradication occurred in 97 percent and clinical cures in 97 percent of the patients treated with ofloxacin. There were three probable drug-related adverse events. In the second comparative study 38 patients with pyelonephritis were randomized to receive IV ofloxacin with the option of switching to oral ofloxacin after three days. IV ceftazidime was given to 30 patients with pyelonephritis with the option of switching to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) after three days. Microbiologic cures were experienced by 97 percent of the ofloxacin patients and by 100 percent of the ceftazidime patients.

The data in this publication will review clinical trials in urologic infections as well as the literature which dates from January 1983 through February 1989. The database includes over four hundred reports from nineteen foreign countries and involves data from more than 21,000 patients. The data from the United States were accumulated in clinical trials conducted between 1984 and 1988. Ofloxacin has certain attributes that make it a potentially useful drug in the treatment of urologic infections. These include the high bioavailability from oral administration and the fact that the product is excreted almost entirely by the kidney, primarily as the active parent compound. Urinary levels of ofloxacin two to four hours postadministration can achieve concentrations above 600 micrograms/mL after a single 400-mg dose. Urinary levels twenty-four hours after a single dose are noted to be typically around 50 micrograms/mL. Both of these concentrations are well above the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC90) for uropathogens, which might be below 1 microgram/mL for many uropathogens. With respect to the prostate, ofloxacin penetrates prostatic tissues well and can achieve concentrations of approximately 4.5 micrograms per gram of prostate tissue as a mean peak level. Prostate levels ten hours postdose will typically be approximately 2.7 micrograms per gram of prostatic tissue. These levels exceed the MIC90 for the majority of prostatic pathogens as well.\r"

  ".W": "Four different clinical categories of prostatitis are recognized at present: acute bacterial prostatitis, chronic bacterial prostatitis, nonbacterial prostatitis, and prostatodynia. Treatment results of chronic bacterial prostatitis have, in the past, been rather poor. In addition to local factors (e.g., prostatic calculi), the poor results may well be due, in part, to lack of penetration of the various drugs used into the prostatic tissue and fluid, mostly because of unfavorable lipid solubility, degree of ionization, protein binding, and unfavorable pH gradients from the plasma to prostatic fluid. All of these factors determine the diffusion of a drug into prostatic tissue and fluid. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of the various drugs used and the concentration of the drugs actually obtained in the prostate, combined with the influence of pH, inoculum size, and effect of prostatic fluid and prostatic extract on MIC, are important factors in determining at least the theoretical efficacy of various drugs in the treatment of chronic bacterial prostatitis. The new fluoroquinolones have excellent penetration into both animal and human prostates and very low MIC for the infecting organisms and should, from a theoretical standpoint, be ideal in the treatment of chronic bacterial prostatitis. Few clinical studies have been done, and only prospective, randomized clinical trials will determine the relative efficacy of the various quinolones in the treatment of chronic bacterial prostatitis.\r"

The genitourinary tract is the primary site of infection in about 40 percent of cases, and urinary tract instrumentation and catheterization are implicated in about 80 percent of genitourinary tract nosocomial infections. Catheter-associated urinary tract infections are a frequent source of serious patient morbidity, urosepsis, and even death. The pathogenesis, risk factors, consequences, and preventive measures concerning nosocomial urinary tract infections are reviewed, and specific guidelines for catheter management are offered.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the presence of chest wall and mediastinal invasion by lung cancer and to establish the origin of chest tumors, we studied 12 patients with intrathoracic tumors by using chest CT combined with artificial pneumothorax. Six patients had primary lung cancer, two had metastases, and one each had neurofibroma, pericardial cyst, chondroma of the rib, and malignant mesothelioma. All 12 tumors abutted the chest wall or mediastinum and could not be separated by conventional CT. Between 400 and 800 ml of air was injected into the pleural space before a second CT scan was obtained. No invasion was found at surgery in cancers that were separated from chest wall or mediastinum on CT scans. Surgery revealed chest wall invasion in three patients in whom the CT scans showed that the tumor was not separated from the chest wall. Only one patient with a tumor that was not separated from the mediastinum on CT did not have mediastinal invasion: in this case, only adhesions were found at surgery. Thus, in the eight patients with primary lung cancer and metastasis, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were 100%, 80%, and 88%, respectively. In four patients with mediastinal or pleural tumor, CT combined with pneumothorax was useful for establishing the origin of tumors. In all, 11 of the 12 patients were correctly evaluated by using this method. No complications occurred, except for mild chest discomfort in one patient. This study suggests that chest CT combined with artificial pneumothorax is useful for the evaluation of the extension of lung cancer into the chest wall and mediastinum and for the diagnosis of the site of origin of intrathoracic tumors.\r"

To better define the CT appearance of pulmonary lymphoma, we undertook a retrospective review of 31 patients with recurrent or secondary non-Hodgkin lymphoma or Hodgkin disease and lung parenchymal involvement on CT scans. Diagnoses were confirmed either by lung biopsy or by disease regression or progression with appropriate therapy. The CT scans were evaluated for the following findings: (1) nodules less than 1 cm, (2) a mass or masslike consolidation greater than 1 cm with or without cavitations or bronchograms, (3) alveolar or interstitial infiltrates, (4) masses of pleural origin, (5) peribronchial or perivascular thickening with or without atelectasis, (6) pleural effusions, and (7) hilar or mediastinal lymphadenopathy. The most common CT finding was a mass or masslike consolidation larger than 1 cm, seen in 21 (68%) of the 31 patients. The second most common finding was nodules less than 1 cm (19 patients). Sixty-eight percent of patients had three or more of the CT abnormalities. Lymphoma involving the lung parenchyma causes a variety of CT findings, the most common being a mass or masslike consolidation. Two-thirds of patients have more than one type of CT finding simultaneously.\r"

  ".W": "Contrast-enhanced dynamic CT was used prospectively to diagnose and locate the site of active arterial intraabdominal hemorrhage in 18 patients. Active arterial extravasation was confirmed by angiography in five patients and by immediate surgery in nine. Two patients not undergoing surgery or angiography required multiple blood transfusions to correct rapidly falling hematocrit due to a coagulopathy. One patient died of hypovolemic shock, and autopsy confirmed a large acute retroperitoneal hematoma. Another patient with a splenic laceration and massive hemoperitoneum on CT had no active bleeding at the time of surgery, which was delayed 1 hr from the time of the CT. All patients were clinically thought to be hemodynamically stable and had systolic blood pressures greater than 110 mm Hg at the time of CT. In seven patients, hypotension developed either during (two patients) or immediately after (five patients) CT scanning, necessitating either immediate surgery or angiographic embolization. Contrast-enhanced dynamic CT is valuable in the diagnosis and localization of active arterial intraabdominal hemorrhage. Identification of the anatomic site of this potentially life-threatening hemorrhage is critical in determining whether immediate laparotomy or angiographic embolization is the preferred method of treatment.\r"

Supine films from 44 cases of pneumoperitoneum were randomly interspersed among supine films from 87 control subjects without free air, and the films were reviewed for the presence or absence of various signs of pneumoperitoneum, including Rigler's sign (gas on both sides of the bowel wall), the falciform ligament sign (gas outlining the falciform ligament), the football sign (gas outlining the peritoneal cavity), the inverted-V sign (gas outlining the medial umbilical folds), and the right-upper-quadrant gas sign (localized gas in the right upper quadrant). One or more of these signs were present in 26 cases (59%) of pneumoperitoneum, including the right-upper-quadrant gas sign in 18 cases (41%), Rigler's sign in 14 cases (32%), and the falciform ligament and football signs in one case each (2%). Unfortunately, there were frequent errors in the interpretation of the right-upper-quadrant gas sign and Rigler's sign, with a total of 11 false-positive cases (13%). Further analysis of the true-positive right-upper-quadrant gas signs showed that these gas collections were always triangular or linear with an inferolateral to superomedial orientation and, if triangular, a concave superolateral border. In the true-positive Rigler's signs, the bowel wall thickness ranged from 1 to 8 mm, whereas the false positives all had a bowel wall thickness of 1 mm or less. Proper interpretation of the various signs of pneumoperitoneum on supine films should lead to more accurate diagnosis of this condition.\r"

Surgeons relied solely on the clinical examination to detect biliary disease. Today, no evaluation of the gallbladder would be complete without the performance of an imaging study. Radiology has gone through several eras in the imaging of gallstones. The plain film era, 1895-1924, was characterized by techniques that improved soft-tissue detail, allowing better detection of radiopaque stones. The contrast media era, 1924-1960, was initiated by the invention of IV cholecystography. In 1925, oral cholecystography was developed. During the era of expanding technology, 1960-1979, percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography, scintigraphy, and sonography came into use. The therapeutic era began in the 1980s.\r"

The multiple nodular densities and erosions disappeared after the patients were treated with total parenteral nutrition. The other abnormalities remained unchanged on follow-up examinations.

Twenty-five consecutive patients were included in the study. All patients underwent radical hysterectomy or total abdominal hysterectomy and had detailed histologic evaluation of the parametrium. Ten had pathologic evidence of parametrial invasion; in the remaining 15, no parametrial invasion was identified pathologically. MR findings were compared with pathologic findings in all cases. For determining parametrial involvement, MR imaging had an accuracy of 88%, a sensitivity of 100%, and a specificity of 80%. Our results suggest that MR imaging is a reliable means of assessing parametrial invasion by cervical cancer.\r"

Initially, eight human cadaveric prostatic urethras were stented to evaluate the ability of the stent to dilate the lumen. In all cases, the device attained its unconstrained diameter immediately on placement. Subsequently, stents were placed in the prostatic urethra of 12 dogs and followed up for 1 month (four dogs), 3 months (one dog), and 6 months (seven dogs). Five bare straight-end prostheses, one nylon-covered straight-end device, and six flared-end stents were used. Three of the bare straight-end stents migrated during the follow-up, whereas the nylon-covered and flared-end stents did not. Stent diameters greater than 1.3 times the urethral diameter caused moderate to marked edema and inflammation. After 6 months, white deposits were found on the solder points, presumably from electrolysis. Our experience suggests that placement of Gianturco self-expanding stents may be a useful method of dilating and maintaining the luminal diameter of the prostatic urethra, although care must be taken to select the proper stent size.\r"

Compared with concentric (shortening) muscle actions subjected to the same relative work load, eccentric actions have lower oxygen consumption requirements, fewer activated motor units, and less lactate production. This study was conducted to determine if T2-weighted MR could show any difference in muscles performing these specific types of actions and, therefore, be useful for physiologic investigations of eccentric and concentric actions. Five subjects performed exhaustive exercise by doing isolated concentric actions (raising a dumbbell, flexing at the elbow) and eccentric muscle actions (lowering a dumbbell, extending the contralateral arm). T2-weighted MR images of the arms were obtained immediately before and after exercise. Muscles that performed concentric actions had increases in signal intensity, whereas muscles that performed eccentric actions showed little or no change. T2 relaxation times increased significantly (p less than .01) in all volunteers, but T2 relaxation times for the muscles that performed concentric actions were significantly higher than those for muscles that performed eccentric actions (p less than .01). Therefore, T2 times increased with both concentric and eccentric actions, but the images failed to show the changes in the muscles that performed the eccentric actions. These data demonstrate that assessment of T2 values can be used to distinguish between muscles that perform concentric actions and those that perform eccentric actions, and this phenomenon may be useful for further physiologic investigations of these specific types of muscle actions.\r"

The advantages of the PLA device include high tensile strength and the induction of a rapid proliferative tissue response resulting in a shorter rehabilitation period than with conventional surgical repair. We reviewed 16 MR examinations performed in 10 patients 3-35 months after repair to characterize the MR appearance. All 16 T1-weighted sagittal images revealed a thickened fusiform tendon with streaks of moderate signal within the tendon corresponding to the PLA device and its surrounding collagenogenic response. The double-echo T2-weighted axial images at the mid tendon level demonstrated progressive changes in the signal pattern of the central portion of the tendon that reflected the maturation of the healing tendon. All tendons repaired with PLA implants were uniformly hypertrophied relative to the contralateral normal side because of the induced proliferative collagenogenic ingrowth. Two follow-up MR examinations were performed in six patients and showed mean reductions in tendon caliber of 24% and 30% at the mid and inferior levels. MR imaging of the Achilles tendon repaired with PLA implants shows a diffusely thickened tendon with streaks of signal within the tendon that distinguish it from tendons repaired by conventional techniques.\r"

The radiologic studies of 13 infants who died with evidence of inflicted injury were reviewed. Thirteen distal metaphyseal fractures were identified. Histologically, nine of these fractures were noted to be healing and four showed no evidence of healing. The nine healing injuries were accompanied by statistically significant thickening of the zone of hypertrophic cartilage. Seven of these demonstrated localized areas of hypertrophic cartilage extension; in six of these, corresponding radiolucent extensions of the growth plate into the metaphysis were seen. The extensions tended to be single and focal with minimal osseous injury and broad and multiple with extensive injury. No similar extension was visible in the four acute injuries. Because metaphyseal injuries are notoriously difficult to date, the presence of a reliable radiologic indicator of healing metaphyseal fracture can be important in the evaluation of infant abuse. Because the radiologic findings reflect the histologic alterations, extension of the growth-plate cartilage into the metaphysis may have implications for estimating fracture age.\r"

We describe five children younger than 2 years of age with osteomyelitis of the talus who had a limp and a paucity of constitutional symptoms. Conventional radiography and scintigraphy were the imaging techniques used. The usual radiologic features include soft-tissue swelling and an osteolytic defect in the talus without sequestrum formation of periosteal reaction. Bone scans were positive in all cases and led to the localization of the lesion in two patients. Definitive diagnosis was made in all cases only after needle aspiration or open biopsy and curettage. Increased awareness of this unusual lesion and its subtle early radiologic manifestations will allow prompt diagnosis and treatment.\r"

  ".U": "91165746\r", 
  ".W": "Estimates of the risks associated with the use of radiologic contrast agents frequently are based on a subjective review of some of the numerous articles that have been published on the subject. We have chosen instead to synthesize the existing evidence in an objective, quantitative way by statistically combining the data from individual studies through meta-analysis. Although meta-analysis is subject to whatever biases may exist in the underlying data, and may inappropriately pool data from studies with significant differences, the estimates draw proportionately from each original study and, in addition, gain considerable precision owing to the increased amounts of data considered. Using this technique, we analyzed the data from all available original reports appearing since 1980. Crude rates derived from all reports were used to estimate risks with high-osmolality media. Weighted rate differences based on comparative studies only were used in the estimation of the reductions in risk obtainable with low-osmolality media. The risk of death with high-osmolality media was 0.9 per 100,000 uses (95% confidence interval, 0.3-2.6 per 100,000). The difference in risk produced by using low-osmolality media was 0 (95% confidence interval, -1.1 to 1.1 per 100,000). The risk of severe reactions associated with high-osmolality media was 157 per 100,000 uses (95% confidence interval, 144-172 per 100,000). The reduction in risk that can be obtained by the use of low-osmolality media was estimated to be 126 per 100,000 (95% confidence interval, 110-142 per 100,000). This meta-analysis shows that the risk of death is very low with either type of contrast material and that there is no difference between them. Severe nonfatal reactions with high-osmolality media, although more frequent, are still rare; approximately 80% of them can be prevented by using low-osmolality media.\r"

  ".W": "The three most difficult problems in making picture archiving and communication systems (PACS) a clinical reality in radiology are image archiving, very high-resolution display stations, and high-speed networking. This article considers high-speed image transmission through a high-capacity network. Our laboratory has tested several commercially available high-speed networks over the past year. Only one of these networks (UltraNet) has adequate throughput and capacity potential necessary for our PACS. The focus of this experiment is to determine the throughput and capacity characteristics of this star topology networking scheme as they relate to the operation of a PACS in the clinical environment. A large-scale test was done to gauge network performance for three networking configurations modeling those in a PACS: duplex, parallel, and relay. Ten computers used in our PACS (Sun 3 and 4 computers) were connected with UltraNet. For point-to-point throughput (half-duplex model), the network delivers up to 3.1 megabytes/sec for Sun 3 computers and 6.8 megabytes/sec for the Sun Sparcserver 490. As regards capacity considerations (parallel model), five parallel image transfer processes generated a maximum of 13.9 megabytes/sec through the network. Only a slight degradation in individual process throughput was observed (1.4%). With regard to shared access to high-contention resources on the PACS network (e.g., archive servers), this network demonstrated equal sharing of server networking capacity between the various client computers. With the encouraging results of this experiment, we believe that the UltraNet network will be sufficient for the image communication requirements of our PACS. We are proceeding with the implementation of UltraNet as the high-speed backbone of our extended PACS network.\r"

Ratios of weight relative to height, such as the body-mass index (weight/height), may be used as indirect measures of obesity and correlate with more direct measures of adiposity. Using data from the First National Health and Nutrition Examination Study, 1971 to 1974, standardized percentile curves of body-mass index for white children and adolescents were developed. These curves may be used to monitor the body-mass index of white children and adolescents longitudinally and for comparing an individual with others of the same sex and age.\r"

Such associations have remained, however, generally modest in magnitude, suggesting that stress and support may be only proxy measures for a deeper, more central aspect of childhood psychosocial experience. One aspect of young people's lives that could plausibly mediate the effects of stress and social support on health is the sense of stability and \"permanence\" in ongoing life experience. We developed a standardized psychometric instrument for measuring a \"sense of permanence\" and employed the measure in a prospective 1-year study of health outcomes among 89 adolescent mothers and their infants. Psychosocial and demographic factors were significantly predictive of maternal, but not infant, health outcomes, and the sense of permanence appeared to operate as a \"final common pathway\" in the influence of psychosocial variables on health and illness end points. Results of the study underscore the importance of continuity and stability in childhood and suggest that changes in an individual's sense of permanence may underlie the previously documented health effects of stressful life events and social support.\r"

  ".W": "The recent advent of new advertising campaigns for infant formulas aimed at the general public via television commercials, newspapers, free formula coupons, and lay periodicals has disrupted a comfortable symbiotic relationship between infant food manufacturers and the medical profession that has endured for more than 50 years. In the late 19th century, physicians were concerned about the advertising claims of these products and generally felt that indications and directions for their use should be the province of the physician. Between 1929 and 1932, the American Medical Association, through its Committee on Foods and \"Seal of Acceptance,\" essentially required the entire formula industry to advertise only to the medical profession. Since 1932, the US formula industry has developed into a $1.6 billion market. In 1988, Nestle (absent from the US infant formula industry since the 1940s) acquired the Carnation Company and launched an advertising campaign to the general public for its formula products. Bristol Myers/Mead Johnson, in cooperation with Gerber Products Company, quickly followed suit. These actions threaten to once again remove the realm of infant feeding from the exclusive supervision of the medical profession. The new multimedia public advertising campaigns may increase the cost of infant formula to the general public and have a negative impact on the incidence of breast-feeding. In addition, formula advertising campaigns will likely increase the danger of advertising hyperbole and affect the level of financial support by formula companies for scientific meetings, medical research, education, and social events at medical meetings.\r"

It has been suggested that antibiotic therapy prior to surgery might minimize this risk. We reviewed our experience with ventriculitis in newborns with myelomeningocele and its relationship to antibiotic usage and time of back closure. Of 186 newborns, ventriculitis developed in 13 (7%), and there was no observed difference by time of back closure, clinical severity of infant at birth, status of myelomeningocele sac at birth, or type of delivery. There was a significant association between antibiotic usage and ventriculitis among the infants with delayed surgery, of which only one (1%) of 73 receiving broad-spectrum antibiotic prophylactic therapy developed ventriculitis compared with five (19%) of the 27 who did not receive antibiotics. Our data support the suggestion that antibiotic treatment is effective in minimizing the risk of ventriculitis among infants with myelomeningocele undergoing surgery after 48 hours of age.\r"

The 45 respondents and parents completed separate questionnaires concerning how they felt about receiving stimulant medication. Eighty-nine percent of the children felt that the medication was helpful and 78% liked or were indifferent to it despite a high rate (85%) of reported side effects. The five children (11%) who responded that they would stop taking stimulant medication if they could were more likely to perceive the medication as unhelpful and were receiving standard methylphenidate hydrochloride rather than a long-acting preparation. We conclude that children's perspectives on medication should be elicited directly and sustained-release medication may be more acceptable to children with attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder.\r"

Capillary refilling time in 30 normal infants 2 to 24 months of age was 0.81 +/- 0.31 seconds. Capillary filling time was then measured in 32 infants with diarrhea admitted to the hospital and correlated to the degree of dehydration as estimated from the difference in weight from the time of hospital admission to the weight after rehydration. A turgor time of 1.5 seconds or less was found to be indicative of a less than 50-mL/kg deficit or of a normal infant; 1.5 to 3.0 seconds suggests a deficit between 50 and 100 mL/kg, and more than 3 seconds suggests a deficit of more than 100 mL/kg.\r"

There was a significant difference between postgraduate level-1 and level-3 residents who completed the program in several areas: feelings of overall competence in office management, choosing a practice location, office staff, appointment system, billing system, office computer, fee schedules, telephone management, and setting up an office laboratory. Exposure to a practice management program during residency training may better prepare future pediatricians for a successful practice.\r"

Breast-feeding rates were 44.3% among Anglo-Americans, 13.5% among blacks, and 26.6% among Mexican-Americans. Mexican ethnicity, education levels among Anglo-Americans, and marital status were associated with the initiation of breast-feeding. Odds ratios for breast-feeding were 1.94 (95% confidence interval, 1.10 to 3.43) times higher in Mexican-American compared with black women, and 1.94 (95% confidence interval, 1.34 to 2.83) times higher in married than unmarried women. Anglo-American ethnicity and education, as main effects, were not significantly associated with breast-feeding, but their interaction was. Among Anglo-American women (in comparison with black women), the odds ratios of breast-feeding increased with education level, ranging from 1.84 for those with less than an eighth grade education to 7.46 for those with some college. In contrast to recent findings suggesting that education was more important than ethnicity in predicting breast-feeding, the odds of breast-feeding among Anglo-American compared with black women depended on the level of maternal education, but the odds of breast-feeding for Mexican-American vs black women did not depend on education.\r"

Manometric tracings were compared with those from eight children with idiopathic megacolon and from 10 children without esophageal disease or constipation. Amplitude of esophageal contraction waves was significantly higher in children with Hirschsprung's disease than in the other two groups. Swallows that were followed by simultaneous contractions or double-peaked waves were also more common in the group with Hirschsprung's disease (subjects with Hirschsprung's disease, subjects with megacolon, and controls; 57%, 10%, and 8%, respectively). Lower esophageal sphincter characteristics did not differ among the three groups. The increase in simultaneous contractions and double-peaked waves persisted in those children who were reexamined following surgery for Hirschsprung's disease, whereas wave amplitudes fell to a level similar to that observed in the other groups. These data suggest that gastrointestinal motor dysfunction in persons with Hirschsprung's disease is not restricted to the colon, and that some of the observed abnormalities in esophageal motility do not reflect nonspecific responses to megacolon or colonic obstruction.\r"

Only one sister, who presented with microcephaly and developmental delay, showed signs of dysplasia of the midline structures (ie, septum pellucidum and corpus callosum) and a large intracranial cyst. Neither sister showed any signs of thirst, even when osmolality exceeded 337 mmol/kg. In both patients, the vasopressin secretion did not respond to either osmotic or nonosmotic stimuli or was suppressed by a water load. Plasma osmolality values returned to normal after treatment with forced hydration and a vasopressin analogue, desamino-D-arginine vasopressin. These findings indicate a severe defect in the hypothalamic osmoreceptors that control thirst and vasopressin secretion. To our knowledge, this is the first report of such a disorder in two sisters.\r"

Patients were monitored for evidence of infection for the next 3 weeks. Ten children (mean: age, 6.2 years; Injury Severity Score, 31.2; and Glascow Coma Score, 5.4) admitted with severe trauma had the percentage of circulating lymphocyte subpopulations (pan-T cell marker T101, CD4, CD8, and B cells) measured on day 1 and then weekly for 3 weeks. Fourteen (56%) of the 25 children had no reaction to any of the skin tests (anergic). Eleven (79%) of 14 anergic patients became infected, while three (27%) of 11 of the nonanergic children became infected. There were no significant changes in pan-T cell marker T101, CD4, or CD8 lymphocyte populations in the 3 weeks following injury; however, absolute numbers of circulating B cells dropped significantly by day 7. These data indicate that children with severe trauma who are anergic are significantly more susceptible to infection. Unlike the results reported previously in adult trauma patients, these children had no significant fluctuations in T-cell populations; however, there was a significant decrease in circulating B cells in the first week. The use of the delayed-type hypersensitivity skin test can aid in identifying which patients are at an increased risk for nosocomial infection.\r"

Fourteen human immunodeficiency virus-infected pediatric patients, all of whom had adequate nutritional status, underwent endocrine evaluation. Growth hormone and cortisol responses to glucagon stimulation were adequate. Despite this, eight of the 12 subjects had low somatomedin C levels. Although all patients were clinically and biochemically euthyroid, 36% (5/14) demonstrated elevated baseline and peak thyrotropin levels in response to thyroid releasing hormone, suggesting a state of compensated hypothyroidism. Although the importance of these findings is unclear, it is possible that subtle alterations of thyroid regulation may contribute to failure to thrive in some pediatric patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus and may represent a potentially correctable defect.\r"

PATIENTS AND METHODS: In situ hybridization using the BamH1-W fragment of EBV DNA was performed using labial salivary gland biopsy specimens from 14 patients with SS (eight with primary SS and six with secondary SS) and 39 control subjects. Furthermore, labial salivary gland biopsy specimens from 12 patients with SS (seven with primary SS and five with secondary SS) and 24 control subjects were submitted to the polymerase chain reaction to detect EBV DNA. RESULTS: In situ hybridization detected EBV DNA in epithelial cells of labial salivary gland biopsy specimens from four of eight (50%) patients with primary SS, zero of six patients with secondary SS, and three of 39 (8%) control subjects. The difference between patients with primary SS and control subjects was statistically significant (p less than 0.02). The polymerase chain reaction detected EBV DNA in six of seven (86%) patients with primary SS, three of five (60%) patients with secondary SS, and seven of 24 (29%) control subjects. The difference between patients with primary SS and control subjects was statistically significant (p less than 0.01). CONCLUSION: Both newly developed techniques showed that the presence of EBV DNA was significantly increased in patients with primary SS in comparison with control subjects. In all the positive SS patients who underwent in situ hybridization, epithelial cells of the labial salivary gland were the target of EBV infection. Our results suggest that this virus may play a role in the pathogenesis of SS. We cannot yet determine whether EBV is directly responsible for the destruction of the gland, or if its presence is a secondary event following gland injury.\r"

We compared these patients to a large group of methotrexate-treated rheumatoid arthritis patients in order to uncover potential factors explaining the occurrence of herpes zoster. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data from 187 patients taking methotrexate were reviewed and compared with data from another nine patients who developed herpes zoster while taking the drug for rheumatoid arthritis, all from the same university-based arthritis clinic. Literature pertinent to infection in rheumatoid arthritis patients treated with methotrexate is reviewed. RESULTS: Herpes zoster occurred in 14.5 cases per 1,000 patient-years in our methotrexate-treated rheumatoid arthritis patients, as compared with the general population incidence of 1.3 to 4.8 cases per 1,000 patient-years. The infection was unrelated to duration of methotrexate usage, prednisone treatment, or the co-existence of diabetes mellitus, but appeared to occur in patients with high titers of rheumatoid factor and an overall longer duration of rheumatoid arthritis. There were no cases of systemic dissemination or recurrence of herpes zoster despite 27.4 years cumulative follow-up on continued methotrexate therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Herpes zoster may occur more frequently in patients with rheumatoid arthritis treated with low-dose methotrexate than in the general population. Herpes zoster in rheumatoid arthritis patients treated with methotrexate appears to be self-limited, benign, and statistically related to methotrexate use in the presence of longer-term rheumatoid disease.\r"

The potential association of EG with allergy and related mast-cell release of mediators led us to evaluate the ability of an antihistamine drug to modify the course of the disease. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Six patients with protracted gastrointestinal symptoms were diagnosed with EG because of histologic evidence of predominantly eosinophilic infiltrates in the gastrointestinal mucosa. Each patient was treated in an open trial for 12 months with ketotifen (Zaditen), an antihistamine of the H1 class that is known to stabilize mast cells. RESULTS: All six patients improved clinically; four also gained weight. Total serum IgE levels decreased after 4 to 6 months of therapy. Clearing of eosinophilic infiltrates was documented in the four patients who underwent follow-up mucosal biopsies. CONCLUSION: We conclude that ketotifen treatment represents a safe and effective alternative to traditional systemic corticosteroid therapy for treatment of EG.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: To assess the need for services in occupational medicine, we determined the prevalence of reported occupational exposures in patients seen in the primary care setting. In addition, we evaluated the validity of our survey instrument. PATIENTS AND METHODS: All patients (n = 1,112) seen over a 3-month period of time in the Primary Care Clinic at the Iowa City Veterans Affairs Medical Center were considered eligible for this study. A survey instrument was developed to obtain specific information regarding occupational exposures. The questionnaire was administered to 534 or 48% of all eligible patients. The validity of the survey instrument was evaluated by comparing chest radiographs in subjects with a history of exposure to asbestos, coal dust, or silica to those in patients who were not exposed to any of these agents. RESULTS: We found that almost 75% of the patients reported prior occupational exposure to at least one potentially toxic agent, and over 30% claimed exposure to at least four potentially toxic agents. The validation study indicated that the reported exposure history for asbestos, coal dust, and silica is significantly associated with anticipated changes on chest radiographs. These findings suggest that this easily administered survey instrument is valid for pneumoconiotic dust exposures and may also be valid for other potentially toxic exposures. CONCLUSION: Data from our study indicate that patients seen in the ambulatory care setting may have clinically significant occupational exposures that are relevant to their medical condition.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: Although multi-disciplinary geriatric assessment of elderly patients has been shown to be effective in identifying new diagnoses and previously unknown disabilities and in decreasing hospitalization and mortality, time and financial constraints prevent most internists and office practitioners from using this approach with their older patients. Several instruments to screen older persons for functional disability have been proposed, but there are limited data regarding their utility or effectiveness in clinical medicine. This study developed a short, patient-completed screening assessment instrument (the Functional Assessment Screen), compared it to a standard, multi-disciplinary geriatric evaluation, and determined the screening instrument's ability to predict future use of home care services in a group of elderly patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The screening instrument was piloted retrospectively using data from patients seen in the previous 2 years at a hospital-based geriatrics clinic in Wisconsin. Using these results, a revised instrument was developed and mailed to 80 consecutive new patients who presented to the clinic for multi-disciplinary geriatric assessment and primary care. These patients were interviewed 18 months later to determine use of home services, institutionalization, and death after the initial visit. RESULTS: Fifty-eight of 80 eligible patients (72%) completed both the clinic evaluation and 18-month follow-up. The patients were an elderly (mean age of 76), frail (average of three medical diagnoses), functionally disabled group (dependent in an average of 3.7 instrumental activities of daily living and 2.7 activities of daily living). Nine of the 58 enrolled patients (15%) were institutionalized, five (9%) died, and 31 (53%) required new home services after 18 months. The screening variables were sensitive but less specific than clinic providers' judgment in identifying abnormalities in social, economic, or physical health status. The relative risk of eventual home service use was elevated in patients reporting poor health status (relative risk of 3.5, 95% confidence interval [CI] 9.9 to 1.2), and dependency in housework (relative risk of 3.0, 95% CI 5.1 to 1.7), shopping (relative risk of 2.6, 95% CI 4.7 to 1.5), meals (relative risk of 2.4, 95% CI 3.4 to 1.7), dressing (relative risk of 2.2, 95% CI 3.0 to 1.6), or bathing (relative risk of 2.2, 95% CI 3.2 to 1.5). Home services were used in 16% of patients with no positive responses to a subset of four of the screening questions; usage rose to 22% with one positive response, and to 89% (relative risk of 4.5, 95% CI 9.2 to 2.1) with two or more positive responses. CONCLUSIONS: This screening instrument identified a group of elderly patients at much higher risk for increased home service use than other patients in a geriatrics clinic. If validated in other populations, such an instrument may identify frail, elderly patients in office practice at high risk for use of home services. These patients could be targeted for more complete multi-disciplinary geriatric assessment to identify and treat disease and disability responsible for increased service use and declining health.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: Small non-cleaved-cell lymphoma (SNCL) \"Burkitt's type,\" a rapidly growing lymphoma, has been rare among adults in the United States, but has greatly increased in incidence with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome epidemic. This report details the results of treatment of adult SNCL with a series of protocols originally designed for the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between July 1973 and May 1987, 29 adults with newly diagnosed SNCL were treated at Memorial Hospital with intensive chemotherapy originally designed for ALL: the cyclophosphamide L-2, L-10, L-17, and L-20 protocols. Nine patients had positive serologies for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. One patient with all measurable disease resected was not evaluable for response. RESULTS: Sixteen of 28 evaluable patients (57%) achieved a complete remission with treatment. With follow-up as long as 153 months (median, 47 months), 50% of all patients and 59% of patients with negative or unknown HIV serologies have survived and are probably cured. Patients with an initial serum lactic acid dehydrogenase (LDH) level of greater than 500 U/L had a significantly shortened survival as compared with those with a lower serum LDH. Other pretreatment patient characteristics associated with a shortened survival of borderline statistical significance were high National Cancer Institute stage (C, D) and bone marrow involvement. These results are similar to those for ALL and lymphoblastic lymphoma and are comparable to those for American SNCL in the literature. CONCLUSIONS: Approximately one half of adults with SNCL are curable with intensive chemotherapy. More intensive chemotherapy with hematopoietic growth factor and/or autologous bone marrow or peripheral stem cell support may increase curability.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: To determine the incidence, characteristics, and outcome of infection in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and risk factors that may lead to infection. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We reviewed infections that occurred in 86 consecutive patients with MDS who received care from 1968 to 1986 at a university-affiliated Veterans Affairs Medical Center. Time lines charting the course of each patient with MDS were created and included infections, MDS subgroup at the time of presentation and at the time of each infection, peripheral neutrophil counts, and therapies for MDS. RESULTS: Infections occurred at a rate of nearly one per patient year of observation. Infection rates were associated with MDS subgroup as follows: refractory anemia with or without ringed sideroblasts (RA +/- RS) less than refractory anemia with excess blasts (RAEB) less than RAEB in transformation (RAEB-T). The group of RA +/- RS patients who had erythroid abnormalities but minimal or no dyspoiesis of other cell lines had the lowest rate of infections. Infection rates were higher in patients with less than or equal to 1,000 neutrophils/microL blood than in patients with greater than 1,000 neutrophils/microL blood for each classifiable MDS subgroup. Neutrophil concentration and MDS subgroup were independent risk factors for infection in patients with MDS. Bacterial pneumonias and skin abscesses were the most common infections. Infection was the most common cause of death during MDS, accounting for 64% of deaths, and was more common than transformation to acute leukemia as a cause of death. CONCLUSION: Infection is a common, life-threatening problem in patients with MDS. Neutropenia and MDS subgroup are each risk factors for infection. Clinicians should aggressively evaluate patients with fever and MDS for infection, especially pneumonia and skin infections.\r"

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study populations included 383 patients referred to the University of Virginia and 325 patients referred to the Massachusetts General Hospital for evaluation of chest pain. All patients underwent both cardiac catheterization and exercise thallium-201 stress testing between 1978 and 1981. RESULTS: In the University of Virginia cohort, at each level of thallium-201 abnormality (no defects, one defect, more than one defect), ST depression and patient age added significantly in the detection of multivessel disease. Logistic regression analysis using data from these patients identified three independent predictors of multivessel disease: initial thallium-201 defects, ST depression, and age. A model was developed to predict multivessel disease based on these variables. As might be expected, the risk of multivessel disease predicted by the model was similar to that actually observed in the University of Virginia population. More importantly, however, the model was accurate in predicting the occurrence of multivessel disease in the unrelated population studied at the Massachusetts General Hospital. CONCLUSION: It is, therefore, concluded that (1) nonimaging variables (age and exercise-induced ST depression) add independent information to thallium-201 imaging data in the detection of multivessel disease; and (2) a model has been developed based on the exercise thallium-201 stress test that can accurately predict the probability of multivessel disease in other populations.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: Clinical and radiographic examinations are commonly used for estimating severity and titrating therapy of chronic congestive heart failure. The purpose of this study was to establish the relationship between findings on history, physical examination, chest roentgenogram, and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty-two consecutive patients with chronic congestive heart failure, referred for evaluation for heart transplantation, were studied; all patients underwent history, physical examination, upright chest roentgenogram, and cardiac catheterization. The mean left ventricular ejection fraction was 0.19 +/- 0.06. Patients were divided into three groups according to their PCWP: Group 1, normal PCWP (less than or equal to 15 mm Hg, n = 19); Group 2, mild to moderately elevated PCWP (16 to 29 mm Hg, n = 15); Group 3, markedly elevated PCWP (greater than or equal to 30 mm Hg, n = 18). RESULTS: Physical and radiographic signs of congestion were more common in the groups with higher PCWP, but they could not be used to reliably separate patients with different filling pressures. Physical findings (orthopnea, edema, rales, third heart sound, elevated jugular venous pressure) or radiographic signs (cardiomegaly, vascular redistribution, and interstitial and alveolar edema) had poor predictive value for identifying patients with PCWP values greater than or equal to 30 mm Hg. These findings had poor negative predictive value to exclude significantly elevated PCWP (greater than 20 mm Hg). Radiographic pulmonary congestion was absent in eight (53%) patients in Group 2 and seven (39%) in Group 3. In patients in Group 2 and 3, those without radiographic congestion were in a better New York Heart Association functional class (3.5 +/- 0.5 versus 2.8 +/- 0.6, p less than 0.01). There was good correlation between right atrial pressure and PCWP (r = 0.64, p less than 0.001). A normal right atrial pressure had no predictive value, but a pressure greater than 10 mm Hg was seen in all but one patient with a PCWP value greater than 20 mm Hg. CONCLUSION: Clinical, radiographic, and hemodynamic evaluations of chronic congestive heart failure yield conflicting results. Absence of radiographic or physical signs of congestion does not ensure normal PCWP values and may lead to inaccurate diagnosis and inadequate therapy. It is not known whether therapy aimed at normalizing PCWP is superior to relieving clinical and radiographic signs of congestion.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: To determine if bone mineral density is decreased in postmenopausal women treated with 1-thyroxine, and, if any decrease is observed, whether it is related to overtreatment with thyroid hormone, to deficiency of calcitonin, or to other factors. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study consisted of 19 postmenopausal women between 50 and 75 years of age treated with 1-thyroxine for 5 years or longer, and 19 matching control subjects with no thyroid disease. Bone mineral density of the spine and hip was measured by dual-photon absorptiometry. Plasma calcitonin concentrations and serum thyroid hormone levels were determined by radioimmunoassays. RESULTS: The 1-thyroxine-treated women had lower bone density in the lumbar spine (1.013 g/cm2 [95% confidence interval, 0.945 to 1.081] versus 1.134 g/cm2 [1.026 to 1.242], p = 0.043); in the femoral neck (0.736 g/cm2 [0.694 to 0.778] versus 0.809 g/cm2 [0.747 to 0.872], p = 0.040); in Ward's triangle (0.576 g/cm2 [0.530 to 0.623] versus 0.694 g/cm2 [0.617 to 0.770], p = 0.011); and in the trochanteric area (0.626 g/cm2 [0.581 to 0.672] versus 0.722 g/cm2 [0.651 to 0.794], p = 0.027). The maximal increase in calcitonin following calcium infusion was 1.37 ng/L (95% confidence interval, -0.44 to 3.17) in the 1-thyroxine-treated patients versus 18.8 ng/L (95% confidence interval, 10.0 to 27.5) in normal women, p less than 0.001. The average dose of 1-thyroxine was 120 micrograms/day; 16 of the 19 patients had normal serum thyroxine levels. However, TSH levels were low in 13 of the 19, suggesting that 1-thyroxine treatment was supraphysiologic. Seven of the 19 patients had a history of hyperthyroidism in the distant past; these patients, considered separately, had significantly reduced bone density in the hip. The other 12 patients, considered separately, did not have a statistically significant loss of bone density. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term 1-thyroxine therapy is associated with decreased density of the spine and hip. Since subclinical hyperthyroidism, decreased calcitonin responsiveness, and a history of hyperthyroidism were demonstrated in some or all of these patients, these factors must be considered as possible causes of the decreased bone density.\r"

PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a retrospective cohort study, 13 patients with primary hypothyroidism were identified among 382 consecutive PTCA cases in 1987. Twenty-two euthyroid PTCA control subjects and 13 hypothyroid patients who underwent coronary artery bypass surgery (CAB) were identified for comparison. RESULTS: Hypothyroid and euthyroid PTCA patients had similar mean ages, numbers of prior and recent acute myocardial infarctions, diseased coronary arteries, coronary arteries dilated, and serum cholesterol levels. There were no significant differences in procedure-related mortality (0% versus 0%); coronary artery dissection (23% versus 23%); reocclusion (8% versus 5%); bradycardia (0% versus 0%); heart failure (0% versus 5%); hypotension (31% versus 27%); myocardial infarction (8% versus 0%); gastrointestinal dysfunction (0% versus 0%); neuropsychiatric disturbance (15% versus 9%); hyponatremia (23% versus 23%); hypothermia (0% versus 0%); or fever (15% versus 5%). Hematoma formation tended to be more frequent in the hypothyroid group (38% versus 18%, p = 0.18). Similar results were obtained when the subgroup of more severely hypothyroid patients (thyrotropin level more than 20 mU/L, n = 7) was examined. Compared to hypothyroid CAB patients, hypothyroid PTCA patients had less incidence of heart failure (0% versus 31%, p less than 0.025); neuropsychiatric disturbance (15% versus 54%, p less than 0.025); hyponatremia (23% versus 62%, p less than 0.05); gastrointestinal dysfunction (0% versus 23%, p less than 0.025); and fever (15% versus 62%, p less than 0.001). CONCLUSION: PTCA can be performed in hypothyroid patients without increased mortality or major morbidity, and when appropriate, may be preferred to bypass surgery for coronary revascularization in patients intolerant of full thyroid hormone replacement.\r"

The diagnosis of systemic mast cell disease was made in view of bone marrow and liver biopsies. A transient circulating heparin-like anticoagulant was noted. The occurrence in a short period of these two unusual conditions, given previous knowledge of hematologic disorders associated with germ cell tumors, suggests that the present association is not a coincidence. Systemic mast cell disease should be considered among the hematologic disorders associated with a germ cell tumor.\r"

To date, hundreds of cycles of therapy have been given without a significant incidence of renal failure. We report herein two cases of acute, nonoliguric renal failure in patients receiving intraperitoneal (IP) carboplatin as chemotherapy for advanced ovarian carcinoma. Each patient had received extensive previous treatment with cisplatin. The baseline serum creatinine levels in the patients were 0.9 and 1.1 mg/dL, respectively. After four cycles of IP carboplatin in Patient 1 and five cycles of IP carboplatin in Patient 2, the serum creatinine levels abruptly rose to 9.0 and 9.5 mg/dL, respectively, within a week after administration of therapy. No other primary etiologies for acute renal failure could be identified in either patient. One patient required hemodialysis briefly. Renal biopsy specimens were obtained from both patients. Patient 1 had focal and moderate interstitial nephritis with mild periglomerular fibrosis. Patient 2 had an edematous interstitium with a diffuse mononuclear cell infiltrate, focal interstitial hemorrhage, and toxic changes in proximal and distal tubules on electron microscopy. Treatment with oral prednisone at 1 mg/kg/day with a rapid taper over 4 weeks was done in both cases with the serum creatinine levels eventually dropping to 4.6 and 2.0 mg/dL, respectively. Acute interstitial nephritis and renal failure to this extent have not been previously reported with carboplatin therapy. The literature regarding carboplatin is reviewed with respect to the pathophysiology of its nephrotoxicity.\r"

The necessity for rapidly restoring coronary artery perfusion and the time constraints governing clinical decisions may prevent endocarditis from being diagnosed before pharmacologic or mechanical thrombolysis. This report describes the first documented cases of coronary angioplasty in two patients with acute myocardial infarction caused by bacterial endocarditis, and reviews the literature on coronary artery complications of bacterial endocarditis. The first patient developed a coronary artery mycotic aneurysm at the dilatation site; the second experienced a small intracerebral hemorrhage following reperfusion. It is, of course, unwise to generalize from two cases, but we believe that in patients who are most likely to have endocarditis as the cause of acute myocardial infarction, the impulse to follow conventional strategies for coronary reperfusion should be tempered by thoughts of possible consequences.\r"

This patient had experienced a delayed transfusion reaction 4 months earlier after receiving least incompatible packed red cells for gastrointestinal bleeding. His blood could not be crossmatched because of the development of multiple antibodies to homologous blood given during previous surgery and several episodes of gastrointestinal hemorrhage. Following initiation of EPO therapy, there was a prompt and persistent increase in the reticulocyte count from a baseline of 1.6% to a maximum of 8.6%. This was accompanied by maintenance of the hematocrit between 32% and 38.5% despite withdrawal of seven units of autologous blood over the 45-day treatment period. Poor venous access and availability of blood bank personnel, not hematocrit level, were the limiting factors that determined how frequently blood could be collected. We conclude that EPO stimulated erythropoiesis in this patient with underlying anemia of chronic disease and facilitated harvest of autologous blood for elective surgery.\r"

Along with rising costs of medical care, there has been a resurgence in interest in the quality of health care, and a considerable body of literature on the monitoring and evaluation of health services has been produced. Quality assurance programs frequently evoke negative and skeptical responses from many physicians for a variety of reasons. Crucial to the potential effectiveness of quality assessment methods is the setting of standards. Physician clinicians should be strongly encouraged to participate directly and seriously in the development of standards. The quality assurance process should be viewed by physicians as an opportunity to recapture the control of the profession and to demonstrate to patients, in an objective manner, the legitimate high quality of care rendered.\r"

U. urealyticum colonization was associated with maternal age, parity, racial-ethnic group, martial status, income, education, smoking, number of sexual partners, and colonization with Trichomonas vaginalis, Mycoplasma hominis, and bacterial vaginosis. After adjustment for medical and sociodemographic factors in a multivariate analysis, there was no difference in the mean birth weight or proportion of low-birth-weight infants delivered by women who carried U. urealyticum and those who did not. U. urealyticum colonization at 23 to 26 weeks was not associated with preterm rupture of membranes, preterm labor, or preterm delivery. A positive vaginal culture for U. urealyticum in midgestation does not predict those women at risk for preterm labor, preterm delivery, preterm premature rupture of membranes, or delivery of a low-birth-weight infant.\r"

In this multicenter, randomized, double-blind clinical trial, pregnant women with U. urealyticum were treated with 333 mg of erythromycin base or placebo three times daily, starting between 26 and 30 weeks' gestation and continuing through 35 completed weeks of pregnancy. Women with urinary tract infection or Neisseria gonorrhoeae infection were excluded from the trial, and women with Chlamydia trachomatis or group B streptococci were excluded from these analyses. Erythromycin did not eliminate U. urealyticum from the lower genital tract.

In this study we examined the effect of epidermal growth factor on proliferation of normal human ovarian epithelial cells in monolayer culture. We found that epidermal growth factor stimulated twofold to fourfold increases in proliferation in epithelial cells from each of five normal ovaries (p less than 0.01). In addition, Scatchard analysis of binding of epidermal growth factor tagged with iodine 125 indicated the presence of high-affinity receptors in all of the ovarian epithelial cells and ovarian cancer cell lines. The number and affinity of receptors was similar in the normal epithelium and cancer cell lines, and there was no relationship between epidermal growth factor receptor number and responsiveness to epidermal growth factor. We conclude that human ovarian epithelial cells normally express epidermal growth factor receptors and that epidermal growth factor acts as a mitogen for these cells. Although the mitogenic response to epidermal growth factor often is attenuated in ovarian cancer cell lines, loss of responsiveness to epidermal growth factor does not appear to be due to decreased receptor expression.\r"

There were no group differences in overall net changes or in rates of change over the 5-year period. However, two short-term group differences were noted: a decrease in coital desire among women not planning sterilization between baseline and follow-up year 4, compared with increases for both sterilization groups, and an increase in coital frequency at the first follow-up year only in the tubal sterilization group. These data indicate that there are no detrimental effects and some short-term benefits of both sterilization procedures on female marital sexuality.\r"

Because of technical limitations previous studies were confined to the uterine artery and its main branches. With the development of color Doppler and transvaginal ultrasonography we can now identify blood flow in various small vessels in the placental bed. This study was performed to assess the ability of color Doppler ultrasonography to evaluate subtrophoblastic blood flow by color identification in the early phase of normal pregnancy from 5 to 9 weeks' gestation. Results show that the characteristic increase in diastolic blood flow is evident as early as 5 weeks' gestation.\r"

We examined the relationship between maternal characteristics and the risk of delivering a small-for-gestational age infant in 2228 women who participated in the University of California, San Diego Prenatal Nutrition Project between 1978 and 1988. A multivariate analysis indicated that significant risk factors for small for gestational age were cigarette smoking (odds ratio, 3.18), a low rate of maternal weight gain (odds ratio, 2.96), black ethnicity (odds ratio, 2.60), pregravid underweight (odds ratio, 2.36), Asian ethnicity (odds ratio, 1.88), primiparity (odds ratio, 1.85), and low maternal height (odds ratio, 1.63). These findings are contrasted with those previously published on preterm deliveries in the same cohort. We conclude that with the exception of black ethnicity and low maternal weight gain, different maternal characteristics were significantly associated with small-for-gestational-age and preterm birth in this population.\r"

In addition, 69% of those women with no history of genital tract infection but with laparoscopic evidence of past pelvic infection had significant levels of circulating antisperm antibodies. Electroimmunoblots of sperm preparations probed with the sera of women who had either known or presumed upper genital tract infection revealed a uniformly recognized 69 kd antigen. In contrast, women with circulating antisperm antibodies before primary upper genital tract infection recognized up to five distinct sperm antigen determinants of 27, 54, 131, 146, and 174 kd. It is a distinct possibility that genital tract infections may lead to immunopotentiation of antisperm antibodies that could affect fertility.\r"

In the East Flanders Prospective Twin Study, placental tissue of twin and triplet sets, in some of which one or both members were stillborn and macerated, has been stored at -20 degrees C. Of all these fetuses, sex and zygosity could be determined accurately on the placental deoxyribonucleic acid. We tested the possibility of nongenetic changes in deoxyribonucleic acid that result from maceration or tissue degradation over time in storage on placental samples from monochorionic twins in which only one member was stillborn and macerated. The deoxyribonucleic acid variants in these monozygotic twins were identical whether or not either cotwin was macerated. Thus deoxyribonucleic acid variants can be determined accurately on the placental tissue of macerated fetuses, even after prolonged freezing.\r"

In white women who were delivered of infants who weighed greater than or equal to 3000 gm, average weight gain was 5.3 pounds at 9 to 10 weeks' gestation, 10.5 pounds at 11 to 20 weeks, 24.2 pounds at 21 to 30 weeks, and 35.1 pounds at 31 to 40 weeks. Weight gain among black women delivered of infants who weighed greater than or equal to 3000 gm was 4.2 pounds at 9 to 10 weeks' gestation, 14.8 pounds at 11 to 20 weeks, 24.5 pounds at 21 to 30 weeks, and 33.9 pounds at 31 to 40 weeks. Weight gain was highly variable at all gestational ages in both black and white women. Weight gain in both black and white women delivered of infants with weights greater than or equal to 3000 gm was linear at a rate of about 0.66 pounds per week from 8 through 20 weeks' gestation and linear at a rate of 1.06 pounds per week after week 20.\r"

  ".W": "In this study the effects of hormone replacement therapy on cardiac function in healthy postmenopausal women were evaluated by Doppler echocardiography that was performed before (T1) and 2.5 months after the initiation of hormone replacement therapy (T2) in the peak estrogenic phase. The following parameters of aortic flow were measured: peak flow velocity, acceleration time, and ejection time. Additional parameters were calculated: flow velocity integral and mean acceleration. The study group included 24 postmenopausal women aged 43 to 60 years (mean 51.6 years). The control group consisted of 19 postmenopausal women aged 46 to 60 years (mean 53.5 years) who were not receiving hormone replacement therapy and who underwent the same evaluation. There were no changes in all Doppler parameters between T1 and T2 in the control group. However, in the study group there were significant increases in peak flow velocity (108.3 +/- 16.7 cm/sec at T1 vs 123 +/- 20.7 cm/sec at T2; p = 0.002), flow velocity integral (17.7 +/- 3.9 vs 21.5 +/- 4.7 cm; p = 0.0003), mean acceleration (11.5 +/- 1.9 vs 13.1 +/- 2.6 m/sec/sec; p = 0.001), and ejection time (324 +/- 37.6 vs 348.8 +/- 40.7 msec; p = 0.002). There was no change in acceleration time (94.8 +/- 6.6 vs 95 +/- 10.9 msec). These results demonstrate that estrogens increase both stroke volume and flow acceleration. The latter probably reflects a combination of enhanced inotropism and vasodilatation. We assume that the cardioprotective effect of hormone replacement therapy in postmenopausal women may be due not only to changes in lipid profile but also to direct effects of estrogens on central and peripheral hemodynamic parameters.\r"

All nine patients with intraamniotic infection had amniotic fluid glucose values less than 10 mg/dl. Three patients with amniotic fluid glucose levels less than 10 mg/dl but without chorioamnionitis were delivered of infants within 72 hours of admission. The mean amniotic fluid glucose level of patients with intraamniotic infection (5 +/- 2.4 mg/dl) was significantly lower than in those without intraamniotic infection (39.8 +/- 18.42 mg/dl). All patients with amniotic fluid glucose values less than 10 mg/dl had either bacteria and/or white blood cells on Gram's stain. Two patients without chorioamnionitis had white cells on Gram's stain and amniotic fluid glucose values greater than 10 mg/dl. It appears that amniotic fluid glucose is more sensitive and more specific than Gram's stain in the diagnosis of intraamniotic infection. All 12 patients with low amniotic fluid glucose values were delivered of infants within 72 hours as the result of either the presence of infection or the progression of labor.\r"

This reduction in fetal breathing may play a role in the production of pulmonary hypoplasia in some of these patients. Further studies are needed to investigate whether ruptured membranes are associated with a reduction in fetal breathing at earlier gestational ages.\r"

The administration of ketamine alone, midazolam alone, or a combination of midazolam and ketamine allowed for the successful performance of a gynecologic examination in 81% of previously uncooperative women. No adverse effects of the medications were noted. We conclude that sedation of difficult-to-examine, mentally handicapped women can be safely performed in the outpatient setting, thus avoiding the need for general anesthesia and its inherent risks.\r"

  ".U": "91165901\r", 
  ".W": "Several reports have suggested that persons with an unexplained maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein elevation at 15 to 20 weeks' gestation are at an increased risk for a variety of other pregnancy complications (e.g., preeclampsia) and adverse perinatal outcomes (e.g., fetal death, low-birth-weight infants). However, ascertainment biases could explain some of these reported findings, and predictive value of unexplained elevated maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein levels in the prediction of pregnancy complications seems limited. If elevated second-trimester levels were truly predictive of pregnancy complications, we reason that third-trimester levels could prove even more useful. We thus studied late second-trimester and early third-trimester (24 to 36 weeks' gestation) maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein levels with the same enzyme immunoassay we use to evaluate routine second-trimester (15 to 20 weeks' gestation) levels. Values rose up to 32 weeks and fell slightly thereafter. Variance was greater than at 15 to 20 weeks but not so great as to preclude clinical usefulness in the third trimester. Of 279 women with a normal (0.4 to 2.49 multiples of the median) maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein value at 15 to 20 weeks' gestation, 270 (96.8%) showed levels in the same range later in gestation; however, none of six singleton pregnancies with unexplained maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein levels greater than 2.50 multiples of the median at 15 to 20 weeks' gestation showed maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein levels in this range at 24 to 36 weeks' gestation. The relationship between second- and third-trimester maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein levels in abnormal pregnancies remains to be elucidated in a large sample. Thus we are conducting not only cohort but also cross-sectional studies. Preliminary findings suggest that women with preterm premature rupture of membranes or with premature labor show elevated late second-trimester and early third-trimester maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein levels; however, larger sample sizes are necessary.\r"

These variables were measured: interventricular septal thickness, ratio between the peak velocities during early passive ventricular filling and active atrial filling at the level of the atrioventricular valves, peak velocities, and the time to peak velocity at the level of the ascending aorta and the pulmonary artery. The values obtained were compared with our reference limits for gestation. A significant increase of interventricular septal thickness that was unrelated to maternal glycosylated hemoglobin levels was evidenced. Early passive ventricular filling/active atrial filling ratios were significantly lower in fetuses of diabetic mothers than in control fetuses. These differences were significantly related to interventricular septal thickness. No significant modifications were found in either aortic or pulmonary peak velocities or in time to peak velocity values. These findings suggest that in spite of an adequate metabolic control an interventricular septal hypertrophy that affects cardiac diastolic function develops in fetuses of diabetic mothers.\r"

Besides vasodilatory substances, endothelium also generates vasoconstrictors, including endothelin. We evaluated the capacity of placental tissue from normal pregnant women to express endothelin gene and to generate endothelin. Placental tissue expressed a single 2.3 kb preproendothelin messenger ribonucleic acid and produced comparable amounts of endothelin 3, Big endothelin 1, and endothelin 1 and a minor quantity of endothelin 2. To investigate the possible influence of placental endothelin production on plasma levels of the peptide, plasma endothelin concentrations were measured in normal pregnant women at delivery and were found to be numerically higher than those measured in nonpregnant subjects. Urinary excretion of endothelin, taken as a marker of the renal synthesis of the peptide, tended to increase, although not significantly, in the first 14 weeks of pregnancy. This trend continued throughout pregnancy, resulting in a significant increase from the second trimester to delivery.\r"

Five pregnancies were electively aborted and three other fetuses died in the neonatal period. Twenty-six (72%) of the remaining 36 live-born neonates are developmentally and clinically normal at 3 to 18 months of age. Twenty-one of these 26 had isolated mild ventriculomegaly as the only ultrasonographic finding. The other 10 live-born infants are developmentally impaired, and five of these 10 had mild ventriculomegaly as the only prenatal ultrasonographic abnormality. In conclusion, these data show that fetuses with mild ventriculomegaly have a lower incidence of associated anomalies and a better outcome than fetuses with more severe ventricular dilatation, as reported in the literature. The majority of fetuses with mild ventriculomegaly as an isolated finding and a normal karyotype are developing normally.\r"

This study used data from the 1980 National Natality Survey and National Fetal Mortality Survey, merged with an American Hospital Association annual survey for the same year, to determine whether the frequency of intrapartum fetal death in low-risk women varied by the hospital setting for birth. Stratified analysis was used to assess the relation of level of hospital for delivery with intrapartum fetal death, with control for potential confounding factors. As the level of available perinatal technology decreased, the frequency of intrapartum fetal death increased (odds ratio, 2.0 for Level II and 3.3 for Level I, as compared with Level III hospitals). Even when early neonatal deaths were considered, perinatal mortality remained lowest at Level III facilities (odds ratio, 1.6 for Level II and 2.7 for Level I, as compared with Level III hospitals). The components of intrapartum surveillance that are most effective in the reduction of perinatal mortality have not been identified.\r"

Intracystic flocculation, which typically was deposited on the sloping part of the cyst, gave a characteristic liquid interface that was regarded as ultrasonographic evidence of torsion. All cases with evidence of torsion were managed surgically post partum, and in all patients this complication was confirmed. The remaining nine cases were followed up by repeated ultrasonograms, and in all patients disappearance of the cyst was documented within the first 6 months of life. The mean size of cysts with evidence of torsion was 5.41 +/- 0.25 cm, and the mean size of those without torsion was 4.33 +/- 0.3 cm (p less than 0.01). Histologic examination of the surgical specimen in the cases with evidence of torsion revealed follicular cysts in three cases and necrotic ovarian cysts with no specific epithelial findings in the remaining three. We recommend continuous ultrasonographic assessment of antenatally diagnosed cysts and believe that the choice of treatment depends on the appearance of the cyst and its evolution throughout pregnancy.\r"

The orthostatic response after pregnancy was much more labile than that during the third trimester. These findings have important descriptive implications for the understanding of the human response to orthostasis during pregnancy, as well as clinical implications for patients at risk of uteroplacental insufficiency and for working women during pregnancy.\r"

Ectopic pregnancies are diagnosed earlier these days because of the improvement in diagnostic means and the increasing awareness of the condition. It seems that there is a dramatic change in the clinical presentation of this disease; it used to be a grave and life-threatening condition, and now it is a more benign presentation. The vast majority of the diagnosed ectopic pregnancies are unruptured. This has stimulated various investigators to attempt nonsurgical methods of treatment such as systemic administration of methotrexate or RU 486 (mifepristone) or local injection of methotrexate, potassium chloride, or prostaglandins under laparoscopic or ultrasonographic guidance. Most of these conservative, nonsurgical measures proved efficient in 80% to 90% of cases. Expectant management, which was practiced in some cases, proved to be equally successful. We believe that the ideal mode of treatment in early unruptured ectopic pregnancy is still to be determined. The answer probably lies in proper selection.\r"

For reference, samples were obtained from 20 nonpregnant women in the early (days 0 to 3), mid (days 4 to 8), and late (days 9 to 14) luteal or follicular phase. Maternal serum levels of inhibin (mean +/- SEM) in early (6 to 12 weeks) gestation (36.4 +/- 2.6 U/ml, n = 36) were significantly (p less than 0.01) higher than those in serum from nonpregnant women in the mid (23.9 +/- 2.5 U/ml, n = 19) or late (11.3 +/- 0.6 U/ml, n = 19) luteal phase. Inhibin levels in maternal serum fell to 15.9 +/- 1.4 U/ml (n = 24) in mid (14 to 20 weeks) gestation and then gradually increased during late (21 to 40 weeks) gestation to peak levels of 49.4 +/- 5.1 U/ml (n = 9) at 36 to 37 weeks. Inhibin levels declined in parallel with human chorionic gonadotropin concentrations during the first trimester (r = 0.587 at p less than 0.01). Significant positive correlations (p less than 0.001) were observed between serum levels of inhibin and 17 beta-estradiol (r = 0.560), progesterone (r = 0.648), and human placental lactogen (r = 0.715) during mid and late (20 to 40 weeks) gestation. Inhibin levels in umbilical vein serum (38.5 +/- 1.3 U/ml, n = 5) were not different from those in umbilical artery serum (39.4 +/- 3.6 U/ml) but were significantly (p less than 0.01) lower than those in maternal serum (50.9 +/- 5.3 U/ml), which was obtained at the time of delivery. By day 5 of puerperium, serum levels of inhibin in the maternal vein were extremely low (2.3 +/- 0.1 U/ml, n = 7); these levels were nearly one fifth lower than follicular phase levels of 10.9 +/- 3.4 U/ml (n = 38). We propose that maternal inhibin in early gestation is secreted from the corpus luteum of pregnancy but that increasing inhibin levels during mid and late gestation result from inhibin that is produced by the placenta. The lack of an umbilical arterial-venous gradient for inhibin and the higher levels of inhibin in maternal serum argue against a fetal source of inhibin in the maternal circulation. The physiologic function of inhibin that is produced by the corpus luteum and by the placenta remains to be determined.\r"

In the cases with pure paternal origin, all of the restriction fragment length polymorphisms were homozygous, although those of the fathers were heterozygous at 15 loci. In the four cases that mimicked hydatidiform mole but were diagnosed as hydropic change of villi, both paternal and maternal inheritance were noted. In the four pregnancies with blighted ovum, both paternal and maternal inheritance were shown in three cases; and in one case with a balanced translocation between chromosomes 13 and 14, only paternal inheritance was noted.

This study was designed to explore these possibilities. After a 1-hour control period, 10 near-term chronically catheterized ovine fetuses were infused intravenously with 4 L (greater than 100% of fetal weight) of either isotonic saline solution or lactated Ringer's solution over 4 hours. Fetal arterial pressure was significantly elevated by 7 mm Hg throughout the infusion (p less than 0.00001). Venous pressure underwent a transient rise (4.8 mm Hg) at 20 minutes of infusion and remained elevated (2.7 mm Hg) during the rest of the infusion (p less than 0.00001). Fetal urine flow increased by an average of 5.7 +/- 0.4 ml/min throughout the infusion (p less than 0.00001) and accounted for 34.1% +/- 2.6% of the infused volume. Estimated fetal extracellular fluid volume increased by 17.7% +/- 1.8% of the infused volume. Because fetal fluid retention, urine flow, and amniotic fluid volume changes accounted for only half of the infused fluid, the remainder of the infused volume must have crossed the placenta and entered the maternal circulation. Given the above changes in vascular pressures, this requires a filtration coefficient of the placenta 50 to 100 times the previously reported values. Thus we conclude that relatively small changes in fetal vascular pressures dramatically alter the filtration capacity of the ovine placenta and transplacental volume flow.\r"

  ".W": "Candida albicans is a dimorphic yeast that causes vaginal infections after its transition from a budding yeast to a germinating hyphal form. We report here that physiologic concentrations of beta-endorphin, a neuropeptide with immunomodulating activity produced during stress or physical exercise, stimulates germ tube formation in C. albicans. The percent of germination was proportional to the endorphin concentration, over the 5 x 10(-12) to 5 x 10(-10) mol/L range tested. beta-Endorphin modified by removal of the 4-carboxy-terminal amino acids and (D-Ala2)-beta-endorphin, a peptide with a protease-resistant amino terminal end, were equally effective in stimulating germination. In contrast, N-acetylated beta-endorphin did not stimulate germination. Antisera to beta-endorphin also completely blocked beta-endorphin-stimulated germ tube formation. Two clinical isolates of C. albicans were also responsive to beta-endorphin. Stimulation of germ tube formation by beta-endorphin occurred only in sera from ovulating women. Germination in sera from women using oral contraceptives, in sera from men, or in glucose beef extract broth was not influenced by beta-endorphin. Thus C. albicans may be able to recognize and respond to neuroendocrine signals in ovulating women.\r"

  ".W": "Symptomatic hypovolemia in preeclampsia is often treated by volume expansion. However, the effect of this treatment on placental blood flow is unclear. In the present study the hypothesis was tested that slow volume expansion, imposed on volume-depleted rats, does not compromise placental blood flow. Mild hypovolemia was induced in rats in late pregnancy by 24 hours' thirsting. The resulting gradual dehydration was associated with a 7% reduction in blood volume. These rats were then subjected to blood volume expansion by a continuous infusion with a plasma substitute. Volume expansion increased blood volume by 32% and cardiac output by 73%. The extra cardiac output was distributed to kidneys, carcass, and portal bed. Placental blood flow decreased by 31%. The pattern of response was comparable to the one previously observed in normovolemic rats. However, the magnitude of the changes was larger, probably associated with a delayed or impaired diuretic response. These data suggest that volume expansion therapy in mildly hypovolemic pregnant rats elicits an exaggerated hemodynamic response as compared with normovolemic rats, including placental compromise.\r"

Placentas were also analyzed for pentamidine concentration as were fetal brain, liver, and kidney tissues. Significant placental transfer of the drug was found, with pentamidine reaching all fetal compartments studied. Notably, by the twelfth hour fetal brain tissue achieved pentamidine concentrations that were not significantly different from those of maternal serum at the second hour of the experiment. This is an interesting observation because adult mouse and rat brains were found to be unexposed to the drug.\r"

There is no national health policy that provides the context to redesign the health care system or even plan its incremental improvement. The self-interest ethos of the 1980s allowed decades of health and social advances to be rescinded with hardly a whisper of outrage. The more sophisticated our medical technology became, the more indifferent was the response to the real health needs of our society. Neither a society nor a health care system can survive without virtue or a cause that supersedes individual interests. Our health care cannot progress without an articulated purpose, a common vision expressed as policy that eliminates ambiguity of purpose, ambivalence towards performance standards, conflicts of principles, and contradictions of goals. The challenge calls for great leadership--to define policies that reverse the decline in both the indices of health and the political will to address the public good. To attempt less would allow this country's health care system to go down any road the vagaries of our political process take it.\r"

Collected on an ongoing basis, a standardized nursing data base will enable nurses to compare data across populations, settings, geographic areas, and time. Public health nurses will be able to evaluate and compare services.

METHODS: Using data from a 1986 national telephone survey, we performed a content analysis of subjects' verbatim reports as to why they lacked an RSAC (n = 5,748). RESULTS: The 16.4 percent of respondents who lacked an RSAC gave the following reasons: 1) financial problems, 8 percent; 2) local resource inaccessibility, 5 percent; 3) not wanting a regular source of ambulatory care, 61 percent; and 4) transitory loss of their regular source of ambulatory care, 18 percent. However, some sociodemographic subgroups reported substantially more problems with access barriers, and these disparities were often not detected by the global measure, RSAC. The poor were not more likely than the non-poor to lack an RSAC (odds ratio [OR] = 0.8; 95% confidence interval, [0.6, 1.1]), but were much more likely to lack an RSAC for financial reasons (OR = 5.2 [2.6, 10.6]). Similarly, rural respondents were not more likely than urban dwellers to lack an RSAC, but were more likely to lack an RSAC because of local resource inaccessibility (OR = 5.8 [2.8, 11.9]). CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the global measure, RSAC, is not an accurate indicator of whether population subgroups have access barriers to obtaining a source of continuity care.\r"

METHODS: We analyzed data from the RAND Health Insurance Experiment (HIE), a community-based study of the use of health services. Insurance claim forms for all fee-for-service patients who completed the study were examined for all visits coded as being seen by a chiropractor. Services provided and patient-specified symptoms were taken from these forms. Population-based use rates were calculated for each HIE site. Use rates and services were calculated separately for first visits and repeat visits. RESULTS: There were 5,279 persons who contributed 19,021 person-years of exposure during the study; 395 different persons used 7,873 chiropractic services for a visit rate of 41 per 100 person-years and rate of use of 7.5 percent. Forty-two percent of all visits were for pain in the back. Spinal manipulation accounted for 61 percent of all services provided. Compared to non-users, users tended to be White, middle-aged, married, and high school educated. Seven-fold geographic variations in the use of chiropractic services were seen. CONCLUSIONS: Chiropractors deliver a substantial amount of health care to the US population, and there are significant geographic variations in the rate and intensity of use of chiropractic services.\r"

Little prospective evidence is available which quantifies the burden of morbidity and disability during these years. METHODS: In three community-based cohorts of persons age 65 and older, chronic conditions and disability were evaluated for the three years prior to death in 531 persons who had three annual assessments and then died within one year of the third assessment. Number of chronic conditions, prevalence of disability in activities of daily living (ADLs), and prevalence of disability on a modified Rosow-Breslau scale were determined for these decedents and compared to 8821 members of the cohorts known to have survived. RESULTS: Prevalence rates of disease and disability increased during the follow-up for both decedents and survivors, with decedents generally having higher rates than survivors. Disability rates prior to death, but not the number of diseases, increased with increasing age at death. The odds ratio for disability in ADLs at any of the three assessments for decedents versus survivors ranged from 3.0 to 4.2 in the three communities. In each community the odds ratio for ADL disability was higher in women decedents versus survivors than in men decedents versus survivors. CONCLUSIONS: These results have important implications for disability levels in future older populations in which death is projected to occur at increasingly higher ages.\r"

This study was designed to determine the yield of cholesterol screening in this community. METHODS: Screening took place in eight community sites. Serum total cholesterol was measured using a rapid capillary technique. Blood pressure was taken according to national guidelines and the average of two to three measurements were used. Standard interviews were used to determine the presence of cardiovascular risk factors by history. RESULTS: Of the 562 individuals screened, 44.9 percent had cholesterol levels requiring referral for follow-up care. Of those with total cholesterol greater than or equal to 6.21 mmol/L, 66.4 percent were previously undetected and more than half also had blood pressure levels greater than or equal to 140/90 mmHg on screening; 45 percent of all participants had blood pressure greater than or equal to 140/90 on screenings. Of those with a history of elevated total cholesterol levels, none had levels below 5.17 mmol/L at the time of screening. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple risk factors are highly prevalent in the urban Black community during cholesterol screening programs. Findings suggest the need for cholesterol programs incorporating blood pressure screening in the urban Black community.\r"

Therefore, the effects of average drinks per day and drinking pattern (defined as the independent and interactive effects of quantity and frequency) on blood pressure were compared. METHODS: Data were obtained from a random sample survey of 1,635 household residents in Erie County, New York. Alcohol-blood pressure relationships were examined using multiple regression analyses that controlled for the potentially confounding influence of 13 additional risk factors for elevated blood pressure. RESULTS: Consistent with prior research, a positive relationship was found between average drinks per day and diastolic and systolic blood pressure. Analyses examining the effect of drinking pattern indicated that drinking frequency had a positive effect on both diastolic and systolic blood pressure, whereas drinking quantity did not affect either. Furthermore, there was little evidence that the frequency-by-quantity interaction affected blood pressure. CONCLUSIONS: Low average alcohol intake and low blood pressure were associated with infrequent drinking, rather than with frequent drinking of small amounts of alcohol. Results suggest that the standard practice of averaging alcohol consumption may obscure important effects of drinking frequency on health.\r"

METHODS: Data obtained from birth certificates and interviews on 1,230 women with singleton live births were analyzed to evaluate the potential influence of caffeine consumption during the first trimester on fetal growth. RESULTS: The crude odds ratio for intrauterine growth retardation in infants of women reporting heavy caffeine consumption (greater than 300 mg/day) was 3.86 (95% CI = 1.80, 8.40) which decreased to 2.90 (95% CI = 1.23, 6.87) after controlling for confounding factors. The adjusted odds ratio for low birthweight and heavy maternal caffeine consumption was also elevated (OR = 2.05; 95% CI = 0.86, 4.88). Women who reduced their caffeine intake from greater than 300 mg/day to less than that early in pregnancy had lower risks of delivering infants with either intrauterine growth retardation or low birthweight than women who continued to consume that amount. Preterm delivery appeared to be unrelated to caffeine consumption. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together with studies reporting similar findings, these results suggest that heavy caffeine consumption increases the risk for fetal growth retardation.\r"

METHODS: To determine the role of screening in this increase, trends in the incidence of in situ and invasive carcinoma of the breast were evaluated using records of the metropolitan Atlanta SEER program between 1979 and 1986. From a sample of records, evidence of symptoms and mammographic screening prior to diagnosis was recorded. RESULTS: The average annual age-adjusted incidence of invasive disease rose 29 percent among Whites and 41 percent among Blacks. Incidence increased in all age groups. A trend towards earlier detection of invasive disease was found. Asymptomatic tumors accounted for only 40 percent of the increased incidence among whites and 25 percent of the increased incidence among blacks, with mammography as the principal contributing procedure. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that increased detection accounts for some but not all of the rising incidence of breast cancer in the United States.\r"

METHODS: A field trial among 732 randomly selected adults ages 25 to 65 years was conducted to assess the validity of the risk scores produced by four widely used HRAs. RESULTS: Self-reported HRA risk scores for cigarette smoking and relative weight were generally accurate, but correlations between physiological measurements and scores for blood pressure, cholesterol, and physical activity were always lower than .51. Correlations between epidemiologic estimates of the probability of CHD death and HRA total risk scores ranged from .13 to .75; partial correlations adjusting for age, race, and gender ranged from .12 to .47. CONCLUSIONS: The HRAs chosen for the field trial exhibited modest correlations with the CHD mortality risk predicted by the epidemiologic model. Mathematical errors made by respondents completing self-scored instruments and lack of knowledge regarding physiologic status decrease the accuracy of HRA risk estimates.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND: In October 1987, a red tide due to P. brevis affected the North Carolina coast for the first time. The purpose of our study was to describe the clinical and epidemiological features of neurotoxic shellfish poisoning (NSP), an illness caused by eating shellfish contaminated with the neurotoxins of P. brevis. METHODS: Active surveillance was established for cases of NSP. A descriptive study of the NSP cases was then completed. RESULTS: Forty-eight persons, who had eaten oysters at 20 meals, met the case definition. A variety of gastrointestinal tract and neurological symptoms were reported. The illnesses were generally mild and of short duration, and there were no deaths. Forty-one (85 percent) affected persons lived in five communities located within a 70-kilometer area along the coast. Cases occurred from October 27 to December 9; 27 (56 percent) of the cases occurred before the first closure of affected shellfish waters on November 2. There was a significant increase in the illness attack rate with an increase in the number of oysters eaten. CONCLUSIONS: Routine monitoring of coastal waters for P. brevis is needed to facilitate earlier recognition of red tides, closure of affected areas, and education of the public before substantial exposure to contaminated shellfish occurs.\r"

METHODS: Trends in the incidence of primary bone cancers, including the incidence of osteosarcomas were examined among residents of New York State, exclusive of New York City. Average annual osteosarcoma incidence rates in fluoridated and non-fluoridated areas were also compared. RESULTS: Among persons less than 30 years of age at diagnosis, bone cancer incidence among males demonstrated a significant increase since 1955, while incidence among females has remained unchanged. A significant decrease in bone cancer incidence rates since 1955 was observed among both males and females age 30 years and over at time of diagnosis. Osteosarcoma incidence rates have remained essentially unchanged since 1970, among both younger and older males and females. The average annual age adjusted incidence of osteosarcomas (1976-1987) in areas served by fluoridated water supplies was not found to differ from osteosarcoma incidence rates in non-fluoridated areas. CONCLUSIONS: These data do not support an association between fluoride in drinking water and the occurrence of cancer of the bone.\r"

METHODS: This acute-treatment, dose-ranging study used a randomized, double-blind, parallel design. Patients with supine diastolic blood pressure of 110 to 140 mm Hg after 30 minutes of bedrest received an oral dose of labetalol. Supine blood pressure and heart rate were measured manually and recorded hourly for four hours after dose. Diastolic blood pressure of 100 mm Hg or less or a 30-mm Hg reduction in diastolic blood pressure was considered a treatment success. RESULTS: Two hundred fifty-five patients were evaluated for inclusion, and 36 patients (19 women and 17 men; mean age, 44 years; age range, 23 to 67 years) were studied. The most frequent reason for exclusion was a spontaneous decrease in diastolic blood pressure to less than 110 mm Hg (31%) with bedrest. There were 12 patients in each treatment group. Compared with baseline, the 100-mg dose significantly (P less than .05) reduced heart rate at three and four hours after dose, and the 300-mg dose significantly (P less than .05) reduced heart rate at one, two, and three hours after dose; the 200-mg dose did not significantly affect heart rate. All doses produced a significant decrease in systolic and diastolic blood pressures at one, two, three, and four hours after dose compared with baseline. There were no statistically significant differences between treatment groups with regard to systolic or diastolic blood pressure or heart rate at baseline or one, two, three, or four hours after dose. At two hours after dose, diastolic blood pressure control was observed in 75%, 58%, and 67% of patients receiving 100, 200, and 300 mg, respectively (P = .903). At four hours after dose, diastolic blood pressure control was observed in 50%, 64%, and 67% of patients receiving 100, 200, and 300 mg, respectively (P = .755). A comparison of treatment success rates between the two time periods showed a waning of response with the 100-mg dose of labetalol at hour 4 compared with hour 2 (P less than .05). No adverse effects were observed. CONCLUSION: Labetalol provides safe and effective treatment for hypertensive urgencies when administered orally in doses of 100 to 300 mg.\r"

  ".W": "STUDY OBJECTIVE: Previous reports have emphasized that thrombolytic therapy for acute myocardial infarction should be initiated within three or four hours of symptom onset to obtain the best clinical outcomes. However, our clinical impression was that late arrivers, who often do not receive thrombolytic therapy, have a good short-term prognosis. Therefore, we investigated the relationships among the elapsed time from symptom onset, thrombolytic therapy, and short-term prognosis in acute myocardial infarction patients. The research hypothesis was that late arrivers have a better in-hospital prognosis because they have less severe disease that may involve spontaneous thrombolysis. DESIGN: Observational cohort study based on reviewing medical records and emergency department service logs. SETTING: 500-bed teaching hospital with medical school affiliation in northeastern Ohio. TYPE OF PARTICIPANTS: Four hundred consecutive patients with acute infarction confirmed by chest pain and positive ECGs or elevated cardiac enzymes. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Patients arriving early (elapsed time less than or equal to 1.5 hours) were more likely to be in Killip class III or IV (P = .04) or to have hypotension (P = .0004); and they experienced twofold increased odds of ventricular tachycardia (P = .007), cardiac arrest (P = .03), or death (P = .01). Patients arriving late (elapsed time greater than 3.5 hours) were more likely to have a history of angina (P = .002) and had a better short-term prognosis. CONCLUSIONS: Time of ED arrival after onset of acute myocardial infarction symptoms distinguishes two patient groups that differ in their risk of in-hospital complications. Late arrivers have better short-term prognoses and less (acutely) severe disease, and may have less need for thrombolytic therapy because of possible spontaneous thrombolysis. Patients with prior angina may need education on seeking care if their symptoms change.\r"

This study was undertaken to determine if upper tract PID occurred more frequently than previously reported in patients remote from surgical sterilization. DESIGN: Retrospective review of hospitalized patients with the primary discharge diagnosis of PID. SETTING: Urban, university hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Three hundred sixty-four hospitalized patients with the primary discharge diagnosis of PID over a six-year study period. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Patients' age; gynecologic histories and diagnoses; and laboratory, clinical, and surgical findings were noted. Twenty-three cases of acute PID were identified in 21 patients previously sterilized (6%). Nine of the 23 cases had systemic toxicity warranting surgical evaluation; 18 of the 23 cases were admitted from the emergency department. Mean statistical characteristics of the study group were age, 27.3 +/- 0.8 (SE) years; time interval from sterilization, 49.8 +/- 7.4 months; WBC 15,000 +/- 1,200; and temperature, 38.0 +/- 0.2 C.

PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: Adult patients presenting to the ED at an urban teaching hospital for laceration repair. Exclusion criteria included patients less than 18 years old, having received analgesics, with suspected alcohol or substance intoxication, and in whom laceration repair was complicated by treatment of a more serious medical condition. DESIGN AND INTERVENTIONS: This was a randomized, controlled trial. After giving informed consent, patients were randomly assigned to receive standard laceration repair without music (control) or standard laceration repair with music. Patients assigned to the music group chose an audio tape from 50 available styles and artists. Patients received the music through a headset, and they controlled the volume. Intradermal lidocaine was used in all patients. Data were collected on heart rate, blood pressure, and respirations just before and immediately after wound repair. Psychological variables included the state subscale of the Spielberger State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), a visual analog pain scale rating, and a brief questionnaire. STAI and pain scale ratings were analyzed with Wilcoxon's rank-sum test with an alpha error of .05. RESULTS: Thirty-eight patients (19 per group) completed the protocol. Pain scores were significantly (P less than .05) lower in the music group (mean, 2.09) than in controls (mean, 3.31). Anxiety after the procedure was reduced in both groups, but STAI reduction scores were not significantly different between groups (music, 17.7; control, 18.5). Seventeen of 19 patients (89%) rated music \"very beneficial,\" and 100% said they would use music again. CONCLUSION: Music provides a safe, inexpensive, and effective adjunct for the management of pain in the ED but does not significantly affect anxiety.\r"

The emergency medical services system, with 55 around-the-clock ambulances and 550 paramedics, is single-tiered and responds to more than 200,000 emergencies per year. TYPE OF PARTICIPANTS: We studied 3,221 victims of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest on whom paramedics attempted resuscitation. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Ninety-one percent of patients were pronounced dead in emergency departments, 7% died in hospitals, and 2% survived to hospital discharge. Survival was significantly greater with bystander-witnessed arrest, bystander-initiated CPR, paramedic-witnessed arrest, initial rhythm of ventricular fibrillation, and shorter treatment intervals. CONCLUSIONS: The overall survival rates were significantly lower than those reported in most previous studies, all based on smaller communities; they were consistent with the rates reported in the one comparable study of a large city. The single factor that most likely contributed to the poor overall survival was the relatively long interval between collapse and defibrillation. Logistical, demographic, and other special characteristics of large cities may have affected the rates. To improve treatment of cardiac arrest in large cities and maximize the use of community resources, we recommend further study of comparable metropolitan areas using standardized terms and methodology. Detailed analysis of each component of the emergency medical services systems will aid in making improvements to maximize survival of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.\r"

DESIGN: An ongoing cardiac arrest surveillance system to calculate the annual bystander CPR rates from 1976 through 1988. Two hundred sixty-seven taped recordings of calls reporting cardiac arrests to nine emergency dispatch centers during 1988 were reviewed and timed. SETTING: King County, Washington, excluding the city of Seattle. PARTICIPANTS: Two hundred sixty-seven persons with out-of-hospital cardiac arrests receiving emergency medical services. Arrests in doctors' offices, clinics, or nursing homes were excluded. INTERVENTIONS: Dispatcher-assisted telephone CPR. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The rate of bystander CPR increased from 32% (1976 through 1981) to 54% (1982 through 1988) after implementation of the dispatcher-assisted telephone CPR program, although an increase in survival could not be demonstrated. The median time for dispatchers to identify the problem was 75 seconds; to deliver the early protocols, 19 seconds; to deliver the ventilation instructions, 25 seconds; and to deliver compression instructions, 30 seconds. The total time to deliver the entire CPR message was 2.3 minutes. The most frequent cause for delay was unnecessary questions (57%) with questions about patient age asked most frequently (32%). Other causes included the caller not being near the patient (29%) and deviations from protocol (22%). CONCLUSION: In a metropolitan emergency medical services system, a dispatcher-assisted telephone CPR program was associated with an increase in bystander CPR. Delays in proper delivery of telephone CPR can be minimized through training.\r"

METHODS: This case series examined the survival, success, and complication rates of surgical cricothyrotomy. A specially trained flight nurse retrospectively reviewed all prehospital, emergency department, inpatient, autopsy, and outpatient follow-up records. RESULTS: Fifty-five consecutive patients in whom surgical cricothyrotomy was attempted by a flight nurse during a two-and-one-half-year period were studied. Patients ranged in age from 9 to 76 years. The airway was not cannulated successfully by a flight nurse in two patients. In two patients, the tube was not in the cricothyroid space (one in the upper tracheal rings, and the other in the larynx). In three patients, packing was insufficient to stop bleeding from around the operative site; and in three the tube became occluded by blood in the emergency department. Finally, two patients developed subglottic stenosis. CONCLUSION: Surgical cricothyrotomy in the field can be performed reliably by specially trained nurses. Because only the most critically ill or injured patients with unmanageable airways are subjected to this procedure, a significant complication rate can be anticipated.\r"

The purpose of this study was to determine the time to establish an intraosseous infusion and the success rate at the scene and en route to the hospital using this model. DESIGN: Prospective study. SETTING: Three prehospital scenarios: classroom (scene); a medic unit traveling at 25 mph and making slow, steady turns (turns); and a medic unit traveling at 30 to 35 mph with sudden stops and starts (stop and go). TYPE OF PARTICIPANTS: Paramedics and emergency medicine residents. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Successful placement of the IO needle was confirmed by the aspiration of marrow or the free flow of 5 to 10 mL of normal saline without extravasation into the surrounding tissue. The procedure was timed from skin entry to establishment of infusion. All participants were successful in establishing IO infusion, with 84.8% of infusions achieved in less than one minute in all settings. The scene had somewhat shorter mean and median times and a higher first-attempt success rate, but the differences between scenarios were not significant. CONCLUSION: Using a simulated model, IO access can be established successfully in the prehospital setting. The minimal time delay in establishing IO infusion may make it an appropriate technique for use at the scene or en route to the hospital.\r"

SETTING: Prehospital in a busy, urban emergency medical services system. TYPE OF PARTICIPANTS: Fifty consecutive patients presenting with documented hypoglycemia (ChemStrip BG less than or equal to 80 mg/dL) and symptoms of decreased level of consciousness, syncope, or seizure were enrolled. MEASURES AND MAIN RESULTS: Data collected included pretreatment (ChemStrip BG) and post-treatment serum glucose (hospital assay) as well as assessment of level of consciousness by a quantitative measure, the Glasgow Coma Score, and by a qualitative scale (0 to 3). The mean pretreatment blood glucose of 33.2 +/- 23.3 mg/dL increased after treatment to 133.3 +/- 57.3 mg/dL. Qualitative level of consciousness increased from a mean of 1.26 +/- .96 to 2.42 +/- .94 and Glasgow Coma Score increased from a mean of 9.0 +/- 4.19 to 13.04 +/- 3.68. The mean time until response was 8.8 minutes in those who responded to both level of consciousness criteria 82% (41 of 50). Glucagon administered for hypoglycemia resulted in a glucose increase in 98% (49 of 50) with headache as the only side effect noted in 4% (two of 50) of patients (P less than .0001). CONCLUSION: Glucagon is safe and effective therapy for hypoglycemia in the prehospital setting.\r"

DESIGN: The study was a statewide, cross-sectional, and prospective. It used premethod, post method and 60-day evaluations addressing both cognitive knowledge and attitude toward the method. Subjects were required to complete a 20-question cognitive examination and a ten-point satisfaction inventory. Each study site was randomly assigned a method by a computer-generated table. SETTING: The study involved 11 sites, systematically distributed throughout Michigan. TYPE OF PARTICIPANTS: 111 Michigan licensed paramedics. RESULTS: CAI subjects scored an average of 79.6% on the post-test, while lecture and video subjects scored 70.5% and 68.9%, respectively. At 60 days, CAI subjects scored 70.9%, while lecture and video subjects averaged 59.4 and 59.1, respectively. The difference among the scores was significant post method (P = .01) and at 60 days (P = .02). The subject method preference was lecture, video, and CAI premethod; lecture, CAI, and video immediately post method; and lecture, CAI, and video at 60 days. CONCLUSION: Although lecture was the preferred method, CAI was best able to impart knowledge and enhance participant knowledge retention.\r"

  ".W": "STUDY OBJECTIVE: To determine the level of medical care required for mass gatherings and describe the types of medical problems encountered in a major winter event. DESIGN: Standard charts were available for 3,395 encounters. Interviews with medical staff showed that the few unrecorded encounters were for very minor medical problems. A four-tiered triage system (low, moderate, urgent, and emergent) developed before the Games was applied to each chart retrospectively by a single emergency physician. Chi-squared tests were used to test significant differences. SETTING: This winter sporting and entertainment event had 12 urban and rural venues. Medical staff (98 physicians, 161 nurses, and 337 first-aid attendants) were based in 28 advanced life support (ALS) clinics. The medical service operated for four weeks. TYPE OF PARTICIPANTS: There were 1.8 million spectator-days. Patients included spectators, athletes, and support staff. INTERVENTIONS: First-aid attendants referred patients to the clinics, where nurses conducted initial assessments and referred patients to physicians at the venue, or more rarely, to local hospital emergency departments. Paramedic ambulances were stationed at the venues. The triage system was not used for patient management. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Only 40 urgent and one emergent medical problems were encountered. The majority of patients could have been managed by trained nurses working alone under standing orders. Fifty patients were transported to the hospital by ground ambulance and three by helicopter. No significant differences were found in the low acuity levels experienced at indoor urban venues, outdoor urban venues, and the rural cross-country ski venue. The Alpine ski venue was characterized by significantly higher acuity and a long prehospital transfer phase. CONCLUSION: Owing to the low acuity encountered and the availability of Calgary's ALS ambulance service, we concluded that physician-based ALS teams were not required for patient management at the urban venues. Such teams were found to be required at the rural Alpine ski venue. Other reasons for using physicians are discussed, as is development of a standard triage system for mass gatherings.\r"

In the presence of acceptable indications and a favorable benefit to risk ratio, this form of therapy, when successful, has served as a useful adjunct in the management of these disorders. In deep-vein thrombophlebitis, lysis of the thrombus before permanent pathological changes (eg, organization, scarring) have occurred can prevent venous valvular dysfunction and postural venous hypertension and its complications, especially the postphlebitic syndrome. In the more severe forms of acute pulmonary embolism, thrombolytic therapy, when applied early after symptom onset, decreases morbidity and is likely to prevent a chronic increase in pulmonary vascular resistance and persistent pulmonary hypertension. In peripheral arterial thrombo-occlusive events, early restoration of flow through thrombolysis has been shown to limit ischemic damage and serve as a useful supplement to angioplasty or surgery. Thrombolytic therapy has been used less extensively in acute strokes. Here the danger of reperfusion causing bleeding into a softened area of brain undergoing infarction has slowed its evaluation for this disorder; its application to stroke remains experimental.\r"

  ".W": "The tracheobronchial vasculature is controlled by adrenergic, cholinergic, and peptidergic nervous mechanisms. Sympathetic nerves release norepinephrine and neuropeptide Y (NPY), which are both constrictor agents, the latter being long-lasting. Parasympathetic nerves release acetylcholine and usually vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP), both of which are vasodilators, VIP being the longer lasting. These motor nerves are controlled by many reflex inputs. Activation of pulmonary C-fiber receptors by irritants and inflammatory mediators causes a powerful vasodilatation, mainly via sympathetic motor nerves. Cardiac and chemoreceptor reflexes also influence airway vascular tone. Sensory nerves in the airway mucosa are responsible for local axon reflexes in response to irritants and inflammatory mediators. These nerves contain neuropeptides such as substance P (SP), neurokinins A and B (NKA, NKB), and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP). All these neuropeptides are powerful vasodilators. Thus, inflammatory conditions in the lungs such as asthma cause vasodilation by local direct action of mediators, by axon reflexes, and by central nervous reflexes. The vasodilation could lead to mucosal edema. Thus, airway vascular responses have to be added to bronchoconstriction and mucus secretion as part of the mucosal pathology of asthma.\r"

In contrast, SP has no significant effect on macromolecule secretion from secretory cells in tracheal explants, probably because of epithelial suppression. Our study using an isolated gland preparation has also indicated that VIP potentiates mucous glycoprotein secretion induced by cholinergic stimulation through an interaction between muscarinic and VIP receptors in secretory cells. However, VIP failed to induce any significant glandular contraction or relaxation, indicating a lack of VIP receptors or a difference in the subtypes of muscarinic receptors in myoepithelial cells in submucosa glands.\r"

These peptides have potent effects on airway caliber, blood vessels, and secretions, raising the possibility that they may be involved in airway diseases such as asthma. Vasoactive intestinal peptide and peptide histidine methionine are potent bronchodilators and may be neurotransmitters of nonadrenergic bronchodilator nerves. In asthma, if these peptides are broken down more rapidly by enzymes from inflammatory cells, this might contribute to exaggerated bronchial responsiveness. Neuropeptides that are found in sensory nerves, such as substance P, neurokinin A, and calcitonin gene-related peptide, have inflammatory effects and might also contribute to the pathology of asthma if released from sensory nerve endings by an axon reflex. These findings may have important therapeutic implications for the future.\r"

  ".U": "91166131\r", 
  ".W": "The neuromuscular mechanisms underlying airway hyperresponsiveness have been reviewed on the basis of studies of the changes induced by ozone inhalation in dogs. In vivo, there is increased, nonspecific airway hyperresponsiveness based on studies of the response to inhaled acetylcholine or histamine. The underlying inflammatory mechanism involves release of LTB4 and/or other chemotactic agents from epithelial or lumenal cells, ingress of macrophages, neutrophils, and platelets from the blood vessels between the muscle and epithelium, and migration of mast cells into the epithelium. The hyperresponsiveness seems to depend upon the influx of neutrophils and actions of thromboxane A2 released from the neutrophils. In vitro, there is increased responsiveness to field stimulation of cholinergic nerves and to acetylcholine (not to KCI) in tracheal strips. These effects can be mimicked by a thromboxane A2 analog (U44619). In the sucrose gap, the TxA2 analog does not affect the excitatory junction potential, but in low concentration it increases and prolongs a series of fading membrane oscillations closely related to the contractions. We consider these oscillations to reflect ongoing release and/or action of acetylcholine. In high concentrations the analog causes a small depolarization and a tonic contraction, but it does not enhance the sensitivity to acetylcholine. TxA2 may be acting either presynaptically or postsynaptically or both to produce these effects; however, changes in release of an epithelial-derived relaxing factor do not seem to be involved. We conclude that TxA2 actions probably underlie hyperresponsiveness developed in vivo and in vitro after ozone inhalation.\r"

  ".U": "91166132\r", 
  ".W": "The enzyme neutral endopeptidase (NEP) is bound to the membranes of selected cells in the airways that have receptors for tachykinins. The location of the enzyme, along with its selectivity of substrates (tachykinins are a preferred substrate), allows the enzyme to cleave tachykinins that come close to the cell-surface receptors. By cleaving and thus inactivating tachykinins released during stimulation of the sensory nerves, NEP limits the degree of neurogenic inflammation. Neutral endopeptidase exists in the basal cells of the airway epithelium, nerves, smooth muscle, glands, blood vessels, and perhaps other cells. Thus, the enzyme modulates smooth muscle contraction, gland secretion, cough, vascular permeability, and neutrophil adhesion. Decreased NEP activity occurs with epithelial removal, during respiratory viral infections, and during exposure to irritants (e.g., cigarette smoke and toluene diisocyanate). Delivery of recombinant NEP (rNEP) by aerosol suppressed cough responses during neurogenic inflammation. We suggest that decreased NEP activity will result in exaggerated neurogenic inflammation and may play an important role in inflammatory diseases in airways. Furthermore, drugs that cause up-regulation of NEP may play a therapeutic role by suppressing neurogenic responses. Replacement therapy with rNEP may be useful in diseases where inflammatory peptides (e.g., tachykinins, bradykinin) play a role in pathogenesis.\r"

Late asthmatic reactions are associated with a transient increase of bronchial responsiveness and, at the same time, with an increase of neutrophils followed by eosinophils, and of LTB4 and albumin in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Late asthmatic reactions, increased bronchial responsiveness, and increase of neutrophils, eosinophils, LTB4, and albumin concentration in bronchoalveolar lavage induced by exposure to TDI are all prevented by pretreatment with prednisone but not with the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agent indomethacin. Aerosolized steroids (beclomethasone and dexamethasone isonicotinate) completely inhibit late asthmatic reactions induced by TDI, whereas theophylline has a partial, and verapamil, ketotifen, and cromolyn have no protective effect. These results suggest that late asthmatic reactions induced by TDI may be caused by airway inflammation, and that anti-inflammatory steroids should be recommended in the prophylaxis of TDI asthma.\r"

  ".W": "It is now well recognized that a change in osmolarity of the periciliary fluid is a potent stimulus to airway narrowing and may be a common cause for provoking an attack of asthma. This has led to the use of nonisotonic aerosols to document bronchial hyperresponsiveness in patients with clinical asthma. These aerosols are generated by ultrasonic nebulizers, and the most commonly used are water, hyperosmolar sodium or potassium chloride, and dextrose. An increase in specific airway resistance of 100% or a reduction in FEV1 of 20% is considered as an abnormal response to these aerosols. There are a number of factors that affect the airway response to these aerosols, and these include the osmolarity of the solution and its ionic content and pH. In addition responses may be affected by a previous challenge or medication. It is not known precisely how these aerosols act to induce airway narrowing, but it is not by a direct action on smooth muscle. It is thought that a change in osmolarity of the airways causes the release of inflammatory mediators, which then act to narrow the airways. For this reason challenge by nonisotonic aerosols is different from challenge by histamine and methacholine and may be preferable for the diagnosis of asthma and assessment of its treatment.\r"

In this report we briefly review the effects of several inflammatory mediators, including eicosanoids, platelet-activating factor, and histamine, as well as the effects of plasma proteins and tachykinins that may be secondarily released because of the presence of inflammatory mediators on endothelial and epithelial permeability. We then consider physical mechanisms whereby the resulting airway luminal liquid could amplify the response of an airway previously constricted because of smooth muscle contraction. Specifically, liquid in the interstices between epithelial projections that are formed during muscular contraction could amplify the degree of luminal compromise by (1) further decreasing luminal cross-sectional area by occupying space, and (2) providing an additional source of inward recoil because of the surface tension of the air-liquid interface.\r"

We believe that the morphologic and functional evidence now strongly support a purposeful and biologically significant interaction between these two cell types. This interaction has physiologic consequences and appears to be able to regulate such local events as chloride ion secretion by epithelial cells of the intestinal and respiratory tracts in experimental models. In this way, the mast cell and nerve may be considered as a functional homeostatic regulatory unit. The extent to which this unit may be involved in maintenance of normal integrity of mucous membranes or other structures, in health and in disease, is not clear at the present and will require considerably more investigation and elucidation. However, the concept of such an interaction is an interesting one and may bring new approaches of a therapeutic and diagnostic nature to bear on some old problems. The observations reviewed in this report that psychologic conditioning may itself cause mucosal mast cell degranulation and mediator release in the rat is significant. We consider that this evidence of central nervous system control of mast cell degranulation is an extension of the idea that mast cells and nerves communicate.\r"

It has been reported to induce a long-lasting, if modest, increase in hyperreactivity in both experimental animals and humans. Evidence (albeit often indirect) suggests increased levels associated with bronchial hyperreactivity or the related \"late-phase reaction\" of asthma. In experimental animals, specific inhibitors of PAF can suppress both allergen and PAF-induced hyperreactivity as well as the late-phase reaction to allergen. The mechanism by which PAF induces hyperreactivity is unknown, but the potent effects of PAF on the eosinophil, a cell characteristic of the inflammatory processes often associated with asthma and hyperreactivity, may be important. A number of potent and selective PAF antagonists are now available. The crucial test for the hypothesis that PAF has a role in human airway hyperreactivity will be the testing of substances such as these in appropriate double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials.\r"

The burns ranged from 1 to 25 per cent total body surface area and were comparable in both groups. The mean age in each group was 30 years. Thirty patients were successfully treated with Biobrane, and their average hospital stay was 9.1 +/- 5.4 days compared with 9.2 +/- 8.6 days for the topically treated group. The mean hospital cost for dressings and supplies for the Biobrane group was $360 +/- $90 compared with $310 +/- $190 for the topical group. Four patients (12%) required Biobrane removal during their hospitalization, one due to increasing burn depth and three due to purulent fluid collections beneath the Biobrane. These burns were subsequently treated with topical antimicrobial agents and healed primarily. The mean total hospital stay for this group was 18.0 +/- 11.9 days with the costs being much higher secondary to the initial cost of the Biobrane, the costs associated with topical antibiotic therapy, and extended hospital stay. Although there was a decrease in nursing time and a subjective decrease in patient discomfort associated with using synthetic dressing, no benefit was found in either decreasing hospital stay or total cost of hospitalization and supplies used for inpatients treated at this institution.\r"

The emergency management of the acutely incarcerated or strangulated hernia of the groin using this approach has not been addressed. During a 30-month period, all patients with a diagnosis of acute incarceration of a groin hernia (n = 28) were surgically managed using either the anterior approach (AA) (n = 14) or the preperitoneal approach (PA) (n = 14). Two patients with strangulated intestine in the AA group required an additional midline incision for bowel evaluation and resection. Intestinal evaluation was easily accomplished through the same incision in four patients in the PA group. The preperitoneal approach also allowed proximal control of incarcerated or strangulated viscera, thus avoiding excessive manipulation of gangrenous or necrotic intestine, potential spillage of infected contents into the peritoneal cavity, and entry of bacteria, toxins, potassium, and the metabolic waste products of anaerobic metabolism into the systemic circulation during hernia reduction. There have been no recurrences in either group, and minor complications, such as wound infection and cellulitis, in the two groups are not statistically different.\r"

There was no significant difference in birth weight, days on the ventilator, days to first feeding, and postoperative days in the hospital. There were nine complications in nine patients (30%) with primary repair and four complications in two patients (20%) with staged repair. Two infants died after primary repair (6.7%), and one (10%) died after staged closure. It was concluded that silastic silo repair and primary fascial closure are both acceptable alternatives. Primary closure is attractive whenever possible to avoid additional operations.\r"

  ".W": "The charts of all patients with colonic volvulus at the University of Louisville Hospitals between 1983 and 1988 were reviewed. A total of 45 patients were identified, and there were 17 with cecal volvulus and 29 with sigmoid volvulus (1 had both). Two-thirds of the patients were either demented, bedridden, or used constipating drugs. Initial nonoperative decompression was achieved in 26 of 29 patients with sigmoid volvulus but in only three of nine patients in which it was attempted with cecal volvulus. Two of these recurred, and 16 of the 17 cecal volvulus patients underwent operation. One-third of the sigmoid volvulus patients had at least one recurrent episode on the index admission. Fourteen of the 29 had an operation, and half of these patients died following surgery. Fifteen sigmoid volvulus patients chosen to be treated with successive nonoperative treatment had no mortality. Mortality was higher following emergent (4 of 5) than elective (2 of 9) operation for sigmoid volvulus, and one of three died after operation for a successfully decompressed first episode. Mortality for nonoperative reduction of an early recurrence was zero of four patients, while operative mortality for recurrence was two of seven (all had successful preoperative deflation). There was no mortality or recurrence in four patients with cecal volvulus treated by cecopexy alone, but all three patients died in whom tube cecostomy was performed. Two of nine patients died following right hemicolectomy. These data suggest that if an elective operation is to be performed for sigmoid volvulus, it should be done following one or more recurrences and that nonoperative decompression can be safely performed on successive occasions.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Pneumoperitoneum is usually the result of hollow viscus perforation with associated peritonitis. Nonsurgical spontaneous pneumoperitoneum incidental to intrathoracic, intra-abdominal, gynecologic, iatrogenic, and other miscellaneous causes not associated with perforated viscus have been documented in the literature. Seven cases of spontaneous pneumoperitoneum admitted over 3-year period to Grady Memorial Hospital, Atlanta, Georgia are reported. Six patients with pneumoperitoneum underwent exploratory laparotomy when clinical examination suggested an acute abdomen; no intra-abdominal pathology was documented in any of these patients. A seventh patient, on ventilatory support, was managed conservatively after performing a diagnostic peritoneal lavage that was negative. There were no cases of radiographically misdiagnosed pneumoperitoneum. Pneumoperitoneum, preceded by a reasonable incidental cause in a patient with a adequate abdominal examination, may warrant continued observation thus avoiding an unnecessary laparotomy.\r"
