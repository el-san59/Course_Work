  ".W": "Monocytes have been demonstrated to play an important role in acute serum sickness (AcSS) nephritis. Because accumulation of monocytes within the glomeruli could be the result of local lymphokine production, we studied migration inhibition factor (MIF) activity in supernatants from glomerular cultures, analyzed its temporal relationship with monocyte and lymphocyte accumulation, and tested the effect of anti-T lymphocyte monoclonal antibody on local MIF production. AcSS was induced in 12 rabbits, and one additional rabbit had antigen elimination without proteinuria. Single nephrectomy was performed at the time of antigen elimination in all animals; the remaining kidney was removed four days (4 rabbits) or 14 days afterwards (5 rabbits). In glomerular cross sections (gcs), lymphocytes were identified using monoclonal antibody M108, and monocytes by nonspecific esterase stain (ES). MIF activity was determined in supernatants of cultures of isolated glomeruli by the agarose microdroplet method. Peak of MIF activity (84.3 +/- 2.6%, SEM) was observed the first day of proteinuria in association with peak of lymphocyte infiltration (1.15 +/- 0.1 lymphocytes/gcs) and monocyte infiltration (2.4 +/- 0.3 mean ES score/gcs). MIF activity diminished by day 4 (66.0 +/- 6.3%) and reached control levels by day 14 (12.8 +/- 3.2%). There was a significant correlation between lymphocyte infiltration and MIF activity (r = 0.776, P less than 0.0001) as well as between MIF activity and monocyte accumulation (r = 0.858, P less than 0.0001). In five additional rabbits with AcSS, glomeruli were isolated, treated successively with M108 and normal rabbit serum, and supernatants harvested from 24-hour cultures were tested for MIF activity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

After decalcification femur sections were placed in either 0.1 or 0.01 M AlCl3 or a solution of similar pH without Al for 24 hours. Following 28 days of implantation in subcutaneous pouches the aluminum content was 3232 +/- 1020 and 51 +/- 6 mg/kg in the matrix pretreated with 0.1 and 0.01 M AlCl3. At the same time period following implantation the matrix calcium content was 794 +/- 539 and 3038 +/- 692 mmol/kg in the 0.1 and 0.01 M AlCl3 pretreated groups versus 4252 +/- 579 mmol/kg in the control group (P less than 0.01). In the control group bone histology showed extensive osteoblastic and osteoclastic remodeling, tetracycline labeling and bone formation. In contrast all of these histological features were virtually absent in aluminum treated matrix. Aluminum-induced resistance of bone matrix to collagenase degradation and restoration of bone inductive properties with chelation suggests that aluminum forms intermolecular cross links between collagen fibrils. Aluminum-induced cross links of collagen fibrils and/or its effects on bone inductive proteins present in bone matrix could explain the mechanism by which aluminum induces osteomalacia.\r"

  ".W": "To explain mechanisms responsible for derangement of insulin release in uremia, we investigated glucose metabolism through three different tests in 14 patients with end-stage chronic renal failure. These tests were: intravenous glucose tolerance test with 0.33 g/kg of glucose solution (IVGTT); IVGTT with 0.5 g/kg of glucose solution (IVGTT2); IVGTT during aminophylline infusion (IVGTT + A). Twelve of the patients had IVGTT repeated after two to four months of thrice-weekly regular hemodialysis (IVGTT3). In each test we measured plasma glucose (G), immunoreactive insulin (IRI) and C-peptide. We also calculated glucose constant decay (K), insulin production (IRI area), insulinogenic index (IGI), and insulin resistance index (RI). Twenty-nine healthy volunteers formed the normal controls for IVGTT. As compared to controls, during IVGTT uremic patients showed significantly lower values in K, IRI area and IGI, and showed a significant RI value increase. During IVGTT2, IRI are values were higher than during IVGTT but IGI and K values were unchanged. During IVGTT + A both IRI area and IGI values were higher than during IVGTT. After hemodialysis treatment (IVGTT3) K, IRI areas and IGI increased significantly as compared to the predialysis period. K increase after hemodialysis correlated directly to IGI increase and inversely to RI changes. IGI increase during IVGTT3 was directly correlated to IGI rise during IVGTT + A. From these data we infer that defective insulin release in uremia is due to a decrease of beta-cell glucose sensitivity rather than to their functional exhaustion. An impaired adenyl cyclase-cAMP system may have an important role in the pathogenesis of this abnormality.\r"

  ".W": "PGE2 production by glomeruli is increased in a variety of glomerular diseases. Potentially, this process may affect mesangial cell protein synthesis and mesangial cell growth. Thus studies have been undertaken, using cultured human mesangial cells, to assess the effects of PGE2 on proline uptake, protein synthesis and cell proliferation. In the presence of 140 mM NaCl, incubation of mesangial cells with 0.01 to 1 microM PGE2 for 72 hours resulted in a marked decrease of 14C proline uptake, but did not modify 14C leucine uptake. Substitution of choline to sodium inhibited 14C proline uptake by 85% which became independent of PGE2, indicating that this PG specifically altered sodium-dependent proline uptake. Inhibition of this component reached 35 to 50% with 1 microM PGE2. The inhibitory effect of PGE2 on sodium-dependent proline uptake required a lag time of 48 hours, and was suppressed by ouabain, an inhibitor of Na+, K+ ATPase activity. PGE2 did not modify the Vmax of the transport system (1.007 vs. 1.023 nmol/mg/min) but increased (P less than 0.01) its Km (1.179 vs. 0.823 mM). 8-bromo-cyclic AMP also inhibited sodium-independent proline uptake, and PGE2 markedly increased cyclic AMP production. Taken together, these results suggested that PGE2 acted via cyclic AMP stimulation. PGE2 under identical conditions (1 microM, 72 hr incubation) produced a decrease in collagen synthesis estimated by the relative rate of collagen production after incubation of mesangial cells with 14C proline (percentage of 14C radioactivity in collagenase-sensitive proteins over total proteins). PGE2 also diminished the intracellular free proline pool. More generally, PGE2 inhibited cell proliferation and cell total proteins.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We studied the mechanism of hyperkalemia (5.7 to 6.7 mmol/liter) in four men with post-infectious glomerulonephritis. All four patients had clinical findings consistent with acute glomerulonephritis (edema, hypertension, proteinuria, hematuria, and an elevated ASO titer) and a renal biopsy performed in three of the patients confirmed the diagnosis. In comparison to normal subjects (N = 18), plasma aldosterone (5.4 +/- 1.6 vs. 22.8 +/- 2.6 ng/dl, P less than 0.005) and plasma renin activity (0.3 +/- 0.2 vs. 4.3 +/- 0.6 ng/ml/hr, P less than 0.005) were reduced. Hyperkalemia resolved within one to two weeks in two patients as the nephritis resolved and diuresis ensued, and aldosterone and renin levels obtained at follow-up visits were normal. Hyperkalemia persisted despite furosemide-induced diuresis in the other two patients, but resolved with fludrocortisone treatment. Thus, hyperkalemia in patients with acute glomerulonephritis is a manifestation, in part, of hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism. It is ameliorated by mineralocorticoid therapy and improves spontaneously with resolution of the glomerulonephritis.\r"

The nonresponder state correlates with impaired monocyte function, decreased interleukin-2 (IL-2) production of T cells, and an upregulation of the IL-2 receptor system. In the present study we examined anti-HBs production after hepatitis B vaccination and the in vitro expression of IL-2 receptors in nondialyzed patients with various degrees of chronic renal failure. Forty-four patients with impaired renal function were immunized with 2 micrograms recombinant hepatitis B vaccine and boostered after one and six months. Prior to the first injection IL-2 receptor expression of activated T cells was studied by an in vitro proliferation assay. Sixty-four healthy subjects served as controls. After completion of the third vaccination 55.0% of the patients acquired antibody titers greater than 10 U/liter. The seroconversion rate did not differ between patients with lower (less than 3.5 mg/dl) and higher (greater than 3.5 mg/dl) creatinine levels. In nonresponders IL-2 receptor expression (stimulation index, SI = 10.09 +/- 1.80) was elevated compared to healthy controls (SI = 4.62 +/- 0.35, P less than 0.002) or patients who responded with a high antibody titer (greater than 50 U/liter, SI = 3.12 +/- 0.43, P less than 0.001). Patients who produced low antibody titers (less than 50 U/liter) also presented with enhanced IL-2 receptor expression. These data show that an impaired antibody production following hepatitis B vaccination and an enhanced IL-2 receptor expression of T cells may already be present in early stages of chronic renal failure.\r"

Following the discovery that beta 2-microglobulin was the major protein of this amyloid, we isolated and radiolabelled uremic plasma beta 2-microglobulin. After intravenous injection, gamma-camera images of selected joint areas were obtained from 42 patients who were on regular hemodialysis therapy. Positive scans involving the shoulder, hip, knee and carpal regions were found in 13 of 14 patients treated for more than 10 years and 10 of 16 patients treated for 5 to 10 years. Patients treated for less time had negative scans. Specificity was indicated by negative scans in non-amyloid inflammatory lesions in control hemodialysis patients. Up to 48-fold tracer enrichment was detected in excised AB-amyloid containing tissue as compared to amyloid-free tissue. These findings suggest that circulating radiolabelled beta 2-microglobulin is taken up by the amyloid deposits. This method may non-invasively detect tissue infiltrates of amyloid. It may also permit prospective evaluation of the efficacy of prophylactic dialysis strategies which are designed to prevent or delay the onset of this complication of long-term dialysis.\r"

Renal volume was significantly greater in the HBP compared to the NBP group (males HBP 624 +/- 47 vs. NBP 390 +/- 43 cm3, P less than 0.0005; females HBP 446 +/- 32 vs. NBP 338 +/- 24 cm3, P less than 0.002). Since increased renal volume is due to increased cysts, the results indicate that the early high incidence of hypertension in ADPKD correlates with the renal structural abnormalities in this disorder.\r"

Administration of conjugated estrogens resulted in a significant shortening of the bleeding time in six out of seven patients with a maximum effect 7 and/or 14 days following treatment. Both TxA2 (measured as thromboxane B2, TxB2) and beta-TG release in bleeding time blood were significantly higher following administration of conjugated estrogens as compared to placebo administration. No difference was seen in endothelial PGI2 (measured as 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha) formation when patients were treated with conjugated estrogens as compared to placebo administration over the 28 day observation period. We conclude that in patients with chronic renal failure, infusion of conjugated estrogens results in a significant shortening of the bleeding time together with an increase in platelet reactivity, as indicated by an increase of TxA2 and beta-TG concentration in the microvasculature. No effect was seen on PGI2 production, thereby excluding a major effect on vascular prostaglandin metabolism.\r"

Plasma volume (125I-albumin), glomerular filtration rate and extracellular fluid volume (51Cr-EDTA) were measured. Colloid osmotic pressure and albumin concentration were measured in plasma and in subcutaneous interstitial fluid (suction blister technique). The ratio between plasma volume and interstitial fluid volume was reduced in patients with edema compared with group 1 (P less than 0.05). The interstitial colloid osmotic pressure (mm Hg) was significantly reduced (P less than 0.05) in group V compared with the other groups (V: 4.3 +/- 1.1, I: 7.9 +/- 1.7, II: 7.5 +/- 1.8, III: 6.6 +/- 1.5, IV: 6.6 +/- 1.1), but the transcapillary colloid osmotic gradient in patients with edema was comparable with the remaining subjects.

This reduction was mainly due to enhanced lymph flow. The wash-down of subcutaneous interstitial protein indicated increased capillary filtration, but at the same time limited the increase in net filtration pressure and thereby prevented progressive edema formation in diabetic nephropathy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Endothelin stimulated PDGF release at 12 hours and the effect was sustained for 36 hours. This effect was associated with the enhanced induction of mRNAs encoding PDGF A- and B-chain. Endothelin also induced mitogenesis in human mesangial cells which was accompanied by activation of phospholipase C with increased inositol phosphate turnover. These data suggest a mechanism by which endothelin may regulate mesangial cell function in disease states.\r"

We studied functions and regulation of a Na+/Ca2+ exchanger in cultured human glomerular mesangial cells. Fura-2-loaded confluent monolayers reacted to removal of ambient Na+ with an immediate, transient elevation of [Ca2+]i, assessed by single/dual wavelength fluorometry. Peak [Ca2+]i was inversely correlated with the extracellular Na+ concentration. Ca2+ influx was the sole mechanism implicated, as the [Ca2+]i rise was prevented by EGTA. The process was inhibited by 1 mM amiloride, but not by blockers of voltage-operated Ca2+ channels. Re-addition of Na+ resulted in a rapid decrease of [Ca2+]i, indicating bimodal operation of the exchanger. Na(+)-loading the cells with monensin and ouabain enhanced Ca2+ uptake. Prior stimulation of [Ca2+]i with the thromboxane A2 mimetic, U-46619, or angiotensin II also increased Ca2+ uptake upon subsequent Na+ removal, suggesting induction of the exchanger by vasoconstrictors. Moreover, the magnitude of agonist-induced [Ca2+]i transients was amplified by Na+ removal, indicating that the exchanger modulates the effects of vasoconstrictors. These results demonstrate that an inducible Na+/Ca2+ antiporter is operative in resting and stimulated human mesangial cells, further confirming their smooth muscle origin and potential regulatory role on glomerular hemodynamics.\r"

  ".W": "Both macrophages and glomerular mesangial cells have the potential to synthesize interleukin 1 (IL-1), however, their respective contributions to IL-1 production in anti-GBM glomerulonephritis (GN) are unknown. To address this problem, IL-1 production by glomeruli from rabbits with macrophage-associated anti-GBM GN (passive autologous anti-GBM GN [PAGBMGN]) and macrophage independent (heterologous phase) anti-GBM GN was studied. Macrophage-infiltrated nephritic glomeruli produced IL-1 bioactivity which was inhibitable by an anti-IL-1 antibody, and had a molecular weight consistent with rabbit IL-1. Glomerular IL-1 production in PAGBMGN was markedly augmented (1.43 +/- 0.79 U/10(3) glomeruli [gloms]/24 hr) compared to normal glomeruli (0.13 +/- 0.06 U/10(3) gloms/24 hr, P less than 0.05) or glomeruli from rabbits with macrophage independent GN (0.11 +/- 0.07 U/10(3) gloms/24 hr, P less than 0.05). IL-1 production by glomeruli from leukocyte depleted rabbits with PAGBMGN (0.16 +/- 0.07 U/10(3) gloms/24 hr) was not significantly elevated compared to normal glomeruli. Glomerular macrophages from rabbits with PAGBMGN produced more IL-1 (3.62 +/- 1.63 U/10(3) cells/24 hr) than blood monocytes (0.51 +/- 0.30 U/10(3) cells/24 hr) or alveolar macrophages (0.24 +/- 0.12 U/10(3) cells/24 hr) from the same animals. These results show that in experimental anti-GBM GN where injury is macrophage dependent, IL-1 production is also macrophage dependent and infiltrating glomerular macrophages are the major source of IL-1. Further, as glomerular IL-1 production was not significantly augmented in GN in the absence of macrophages, glomerular deposition of immunoglobulin and complement alone do not stimulate significant IL-1 production by intrinsic glomerular cells in experimental anti-GBM GN.\r"

  ".W": "To assess whether myoglobin adversely affects renal adenylate pools, rats were infused with purified myoglobin (50 mg/100 g body wt) for two hours and renal ATP, ADP, and AMP levels were measured in the absence of shock, after 25 minutes of hemorrhagic shock (55 to 60 mm Hg) or 30 minutes post-recovery. In the absence of shock, myoglobin lowered ATP by 24% (assessed 65 min post-infusion) without affecting renal blood flow (RBF). This effect was completely blocked by deferoxamine (DFO) treatment and it could not be reproduced by ribonuclease infusion (a non-Fe containing, but filtered, protein). Myoglobin + shock caused a three- to fourfold greater decline in ATP than did shock alone despite comparable RBFs. Shock plus myoglobin, but neither one alone, induced substantial S1/S2 proximal tubular morphologic damage and a severe reduction in creatinine clearance, confirming synergistic injury. Ribonuclease completely reproduced myoglobin's effect on shock-induced adenylate profiles. DFO +/- hydroxyl radical scavenger therapy (Na benzoate) did not block the myoglobin shock effect on adenylate pools. Post-shock adenylate recovery was not compromised by myoglobin pre-treatment. If renal artery occlusion (RAO), rather than shock, was used as the ischemic challenge, myoglobin had no discernible impact on adenine nucleotide content. This study concludes that: 1) myoglobin modestly lowers baseline adenylate pools due to an Fe dependent mechanism; 2) myoglobin drastically accentuates shock-induced adenylate depletion by a non-hemodynamic/non-Fe dependent mechanism; 3) myoglobin nephrotoxicity cannot be attributed solely to tissue iron loading; and 4) the RAO model can completely mask important influences on ischemic cellular energetics.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

However, data on the effect of PD on insulin secretion are not consistent, and were derived indirectly by measurements of blood levels of insulin during intravenous glucose tolerance test (IVGTT) or with hyperglycemic clamp technique. Direct evidence for an effect of PD on insulin secretion by pancreatic islets is not available, and the potential mechanisms through which PD may affect insulin secretion are not known. We performed IVGTT, examined in vitro insulin secretion by pancreatic islets, and evaluated various factors involved in insulin secretion in PD and pair weighed (PW) rats. PD animals had fasting hyperglycemia and normal plasma insulin levels, and displayed abnormal IVGTT as compared to PW rats. Both initial and late phases of D-glucose-induced insulin secretion from islets were markedly and significantly (P less than 0.01) lower than from islets of PW rats. In contrast, D-glyceraldehyde-induced insulin release in PD rats was similar to that of PW rats. [H3]2-deoxyglucose uptake by islets and their cyclic AMP content after exposure to D-glucose, D-glyceraldehyde or forskolin were not different among the two groups of animals. Insulin content in PD islets was modestly but significantly (P less than 0.01) higher than PW islets. In PD islets, ATP content and the ATP/ADP ratio at basal state and after incubation with 16.7 mM D-glucose were significantly (P less than 0.01) lower and resting cytosolic calcium was significantly (P less than 0.01) higher than in PW islets.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

At a median time of three months after transplantation clearances of inulin (GFR) and paraaminohippuric acid (ERPF) were measured, and serum urea and creatinine concentrations were determined. The absolute values for GFR (72 +/- 13 ml/min) and ERPF (369 +/- 76 ml/min) in the donors were significantly higher than those of the recipients (37 +/- 22 and 196 +/- 72 ml/min, respectively). The absolute values of GFR and ERPF were significantly correlated with the body surface areas of the recipients. Thus, in relation to body surface area, the GFR, 68 +/- 11 ml/min/1.73 m2, and ERPF, 348 +/- 65 ml/min/1.73 m2, of the donors did not differ from those of the recipients, 68 +/- 20 and 375 +/- 90 ml/min/1.73 m2, respectively. Because of the greater body mass, the serum creatinine concentrations of the donors were significantly higher than those of the recipients, whereas the serum urea concentrations were significantly higher in the recipients. The results suggest that transplantation of an adult kidney to a child results in a functional adaptation to the smaller body size of the recipient, and that this adaptation occurs within three months after transplantation.\r"

To evaluate the validity of this concept in non-insulin-dependent diabetics, we measured the maximal velocity of Na+/Li+ countertransport in red cells in 18 male diabetics suffering from proteinuria due to biopsy proven diabetic glomerulosclerosis (GFR: 51 [range 27 to 146] ml/min/1.73 m2), 17 male diabetics with normoalbuminuria, and in 18 sex-, age-, and body mass index-matched healthy control subjects. Na+/Li+ countertransport was identical in patients with and without diabetic nephropathy, 0.43 (0.24 to 0.92) versus 0.44 (0.20 to 0.83) mmol/(liter cells x hr), but was elevated compared to control subjects, 0.32 (0.09 to 0.73; P less than 0.05). Arterial blood pressure was elevated in patients with nephropathy (162/92 +/- 21/9 mm Hg) compared to normoalbuminuric patients (132/82 +/- 15/7) and control subjects (133/83 +/- 14/7 mm Hg; P less than 0.001). Our study does not support the hypothesis that the risk of diabetic nephropathy in non-insulin-dependent diabetes is associated with a genetic predisposition to hypertension. Diabetes per se seems to enhance Na+/Li+ countertransport activity.\r"

  ".W": "The detection of type I primary hyperoxaluria is based on the finding of exceedingly high oxalate excretion which is associated with increased glycolate excretion. The differential diagnosis of this disease may become a difficult task once end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and anuria have supervened. The various procedures thus far proposed to obviate this circumstance are complex, inaccurate or not reproducible. In this paper we propose the accurate liquid chromatographic determination of glycolate in blood and dialysate as a means to detect type I primary hyperoxaluria in patients on maintenance hemodialysis (RDT). The method is based on the enzymatic conversion of glycolate to glyoxylate coupled with alpha-keto acid derivatization with phenylhydrazine. The resulting phenylhydrazone is then resolved by high-performance liquid chromatograph (HPLC). With this method, plasma glycolate in 12 healthy controls was 7.8 +/- 1.7 mumol/liter, almost twentyfold less than previously reported. Five dialysis patients with high serum oxalate, of whom four with primary hyperoxaluria and one with Crohn's disease and presumed enteric oxalate hyperabsorption, were checked by this method and compared to nine patients with oxalosis-unrelated ESRD. The patients with hyperoxalemia were also evaluated for their response to pyridoxine therapy. The measurement of glycolate in blood drawn prior to and at the end of the dialysis session as well as in the dialysate soundly discriminated the patients with type I hyperoxaluria from all the other dialysis patients. Glycolate measurement was shown to be much more powerful than oxalate in that patients with oxalosis-induced ESRD exhibited an almost two hundred and fiftyfold increase compared to the oxalosis-unrelated patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Twenty-four patients with chronic renal failure, stabilized on hemodialysis, were treated with recombinant human erythropoietin. Before treatment, all patients were anemic (mean Hct = 23.7%). Hematocrits reached normal levels (36.5%) after three months of treatment. Brain event-related potentials and neuropsychological tests were used to assess changes in brain and cognitive functions associated with the correction of anemia. Assessments were done prior to and after three and twelve months of rHuEPO treatment. The P3 component of the event-related potential increased in amplitude significantly with treatment, while its latency was unaffected. Of the four neuropsychological tests administered, scores on two improved significantly with treatment, and the other two approached significance. Taken together, these findings suggest that the correction of anemia to hematocrits near normal in uremic patients by rHuEPO treatment improves brain and cognitive function by raising levels of sustained attention, thus increasing speed and efficiency of scanning and perceptual-motor functions and enhancing learning and memory. These findings also suggest that anemia, either directly or indirectly, may impair brain function.\r"

Since cultured rabbit collecting duct cells constitute a convenient system for in vitro studies, we have examined whether these cells secrete IGF-I. Culture medium conditioned by collecting duct cells was concentrated by reverse phase chromatography and applied to a Sephadex G100 column equilibrated in a denaturing buffer. Two major species with apparent molecular weights of 7.5 and greater than 25 kilodaltons (kD) were identified by IGF-I RIA. A smaller amount of 10 kD species was also observed. Further characterization of 7.5 kD IGF-I immunoreactive species by reverse phase HPLC showed that it eluted in a single peak. To determine whether the higher molecular weight species possessed IGF-I binding activity, appropriate fractions were desalted, incubated with [125I]IGF-I (thr59) for two hours at 30 degrees C and applied to a Sephadex G100 column equilibrated in a non-dissociating buffer. The major peak of radioactivity was confined to a high molecular weight region; there was no radioactivity in the fractions corresponding to 7.5 kD. Western ligand analysis of unreduced conditioned medium identified two IGF-I binding species of 25 and 30 kD, similar in size to species observed in normal rabbit serum. 125I-IGF-I binding as assessed in a charcoal adsorption assay could be displaced by IGF-I and IGF-II but not by insulin. Further characterization of the 10 kD peak of IGF-I immunoreactivity indicated that it did not possess IGF-I binding activity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "This study was undertaken to develop a model of immune complex (IC)-mediated glomerulonephritis (GN) in the nonhuman primate that could be used in subsequent studies to examine critically the role of the erythrocyte complement receptor (E-CR) in the pathogenesis of IC-mediated disease. Cynomolgus monkeys were chosen for study because they constitutively express E-CR levels that are either less than, equal to, or greater than that seen in normal man. After immunization with bovine gamma globulin (BGG), the GN induction protocol was begun in 10 cynomolgus by initiating daily i.v. administration of BGG in amounts sufficient to achieve or exceed antigen/antibody equivalence (assessed by the quantitative precipitin assay) for precipitating antibody present in the plasma volume. We found that within eight weeks of daily BGG administration of all the cynomolgus developed IC-mediated GN, irrespective of the initial E-CR level of the animals. However, the high E-CR cynomolgus tended to receive the higher BGG doses because of higher initial antibody levels to BGG. When the total number of glomerular deposits (determined by morphometric studies) per total BGG dose for each animal was plotted against the initial CR/E of that animal, there was a tendency for the animals with higher CR/E levels to have a lower number of glomerular deposits/BGG dose (r = 0.62, P = 0.06). Also, the total number of glomerular deposits correlated with the severity of the GN. During the early weeks of the GN induction protocol, the IC that formed in vivo (assessed by infusion of 125I-BGG) bound in large amounts to the circulating erythrocytes of the cynomolgus with medium or high E-CR levels. However, when tested after the onset of heavy proteinuria, which occurred between weeks 5 and 8 of daily BGG administration, the IC that formed in the circulation bound only poorly to circulating erythrocytes. By this time the E-CR levels had declined to 43 +/- 9% of initial values (P less than 0.01). This study demonstrates that: 1) A workable model of IC-mediated GN has been developed in the nonhuman primate. 2) During the induction of GN, CR/E and the ability of the erythrocyte to bind IC in vivo are decreased significantly. This suggests that an intact E-CR system could play a role in the protection against IC-mediated disease. However, further study will be needed to test that hypothesis critically. The present model should be useful in such studies.\r"

We measured growth factor activity and concentration in renal cyst fluid, urine, and serum obtained from mice with congenital polycystic kidney disease (cpk). In affected mice, both growth factor activity of urine and the urinary EGF concentration were much lower than unaffected littermate controls even when corrected for creatinine concentration. Although the growth factor activity was much lower in affected mice, there were significant differences in the regional distribution of EGF in animals with cysts. Both growth factor activity and EGF concentration were greater in cyst fluid when compared to urine. Growth factor activity in cysts was completely inhibited by anti-EGF antibody using BALB/MK epithelial keratinocytes as targets. The expression of EGF mRNA in kidneys from affected mice was markedly decreased when compared to littermate controls. These results suggest that decreased EGF production and local differences in EGF concentration may contribute to cyst formation.\r"

Yet the natriuresis after AUN is known to be related to an increase in the plasma concentration of a gamma-melanocyte stimulating hormone (gamma-MSH)-like peptide. In anesthetized rats, sham AUN had no effect on contralateral UNaV, and plasma immunoreactive (IR) gamma-MSH concentration was 10.6 +/- 3.0 (SD) fmol/ml. In rats with intact renal innervation, UNaV more than doubled after AUN (P less than 0.001), and IR-gamma-MSH was increased to 14.9 +/- 4.6 fmol/ml (P less than 0.025). Unilateral renal denervation led to the expected increase in ipsilateral and decrease in contralateral UNaV, and neither sham AUN nor AUN of the denervated of innervated kidney influenced UNaV. In all three of these groups, IR-gamma-MSH concentration was reduced below the sham or post-AUN values seen in rats with innervated kidneys, to 4.9 +/- 3.3, 3.8 +/- 3.4, and 2.8 +/- 3.5 fmol/ml, respectively (P less than 0.001 for all). These results suggested that removal of renal afferent nerve input by renal denervation lowered basal IR-gamma-MSH activity and prevented the stimulated level normally seen after AUN. To examine the effect of stimulating afferent renal nerve activity, we carried out UPE, a maneuver known to increase ipsilateral afferent renal nerve traffic through activation of renal mechanoreceptors, as well as cause a natriuresis from the contralateral kidney.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We have studied the capacity of cultured glomerular visceral epithelial cells (GEC) to act as effective APC and compared this capacity with that demonstrated by peritoneal macrophages. Affinity-purified and in vitro propagated rat GEC were exposed to hen egg lysozyme, keyhole limpet hemocyanin, and cationic ferritin. As effector cells, we used antigen-specific T cell hybridomas; the level of antigen presentation was assessed by determining the level of interleukin 2 (IL-2) present in tissue culture supernatants. Cytokine-treated GEC were capable of processing and presenting all antigens in a dose-dependent manner. Crucial for antigen presentation were intracellular processing of antigen and the presence of Ia on the cell surface. Our findings indicate that GEC can act as effective APC, and further suggest that this capacity may be relevant to cell-mediated immune injury at the level of the glomerular capillaries in vivo.\r"

  ".W": "The present in vitro microperfusion study examined whether chlorpropamide (CPM) has a direct effect on hydraulic conductivity (Lp x 10(-6) cm/atm.sec) and 14C-urea permeability (Pu x 10(-5) cm/sec) in the middle and distal inner medullary collecting duct (IMCD) obtained from acutely water-loaded Wistar rats and rats homozygous for diabetes insipidus (DI). CPM (10(-4) M) added to the bath fluid increased the Lp in the water-loaded Wistar rats from -0.05 +/- 0.13 to 6.25 +/- 0.74 (p less than 0.01) and in the DI rats from 0.05 +/- 0.01 to 5.95 +/- 0.84 (p less than 0.01), but had no effect when it was added to the perfusate. CPM stimulated Lp in a dose-dependent manner with the threshold effect at 10(-6) M. However, the addition of CPM (10(-4) M) to submaximal concentration of VP in the bath fluid did not increase the Lp. Furthermore, CPM was unable to block the inhibitory action of PGE2 on the vasopressin (VP)-stimulated Lp. On the contrary, PGE2 blocked the CPM-stimulated Lp. CPM (10(-4) M) in the peritubular fluid was able to cause a significant rise of the Pu from 13.5 +/- 0.8 to 17.3 +/- 1.0 reversibly, which represented 16% of maximum stimulated effect produced by 50 microU/ml of VP. Thus, pharmacological doses of CPM added to the peritubular side have a direct effect on terminal IMCD increasing water and urea permeability in the absence of VP, but this drug does not potentiate the VP-stimulated water transport in the IMCD. Our results were unable to confirm the hypothesis that CPM potentiates the VP-antidiuresis by the inhibition of PGE2 action in the rat IMCD.\r"

SP-40,40 is a recently described serum protein which appears to inhibit the formation of cytolytic MAC in a manner analogous to S protein/vitronectin. SP-40,40 is homologous to proteins originally isolated from rat and ram seminal fluid (sulfated glycoprotein 2 and clusterin, respectively). By current convention, these proteins are considered clusterin homologues. The objective of this study was to examine the participation of rat clusterin in passive Heymann nephritis. Using an antibody to rat clusterin as an immunofluorescent probe, clusterin deposits were demonstrated along the glomerular capillary wall in an identical pattern to rat C3 and C5b-9. Decomplementation using cobra venom factor prevented proteinuria and intraglomerular MAC formation. The epimembranous clusterin were not detected in the complement-depleted animals. The role of clusterin in the mediation of glomerular injury remains unknown, but it is probably related to in situ formation of the terminal complement cascade where it may play a regulatory role.\r"

  ".W": "A number of different physiological factors and systems have been suggested to be responsible for the natriuretic effect following acute isotonic volume expansion (VE). The variation in suggestions may depend on the prevailing status of the systems governing fluid and electrolyte balance before VE, on the expansion medium and on the rate and degree of VE. A study was performed to determine whether the previously documented attenuating effect of dopamine receptor blockade on natriuresis induced by VE is dependent on the degree of hypervolemia. Anesthetized rats were pretreated with the dopamine receptor blockers haloperidol (1 mg.kg-1 body weight, i.p.), SCH 23390 (30 micrograms.hr-1.kg-1 i.v.) or vehicle and then subjected to VE at 2, 5 or 10% of body weight per hour. VE at 2, 5 and 10% increased sodium excretion in vehicle-pretreated animals 6-, 29- and 130-fold, respectively. In the haloperidol-pretreated animals the natriuretic response (accumulated sodium excretion) to VE was attenuated by 67% (P less than 0.05), 46% (P less than 0.05) and 22% (NS) at the three degrees of expansion, respectively. The corresponding attenuation in SCH 23390-treated animals were 60% (P less than 0.05), 56% (P less than 0.05) and 19% (NS), respectively. The gradual decrease in attenuation indicates that at varying degrees of hypervolemia, different physiological systems contribute differently to the renal natriuretic response. The dopamine system seems to be relatively more important in promoting natriuresis at the lower (physiological) range of hypervolemia whereas in the high range other factors have a greater impact.\r"

Under isometric conditions, rHuEPO caused a contraction of this vasculature in a concentration range between 10 U/ml and 200 U/ml. A maximal active wall tension of 1.52 +/- 0.19 mN/mm was obtained under a rHuEPO dose of 200 U/ml. In Ca2+ free solution, the pressor response to high rHuEPO-concentrations was attenuated, and the response to low rHuEPO concentrations was abolished. In the presence of verapamil, phentolamine and saralasin, rHuEPO-induced contractions were not affected significantly. A dose-dependent vasodilatation of mounted vasculature to acetylcholine (ACh) indicated that endothelium remained intact in our preparations. rHuEPO-induced vessel contraction was not abrogated after an enzymatical removal of endothelium by collagenase, confirming that the described contractile responses are endothelial independent. These findings suggest that a direct vasopressor effect of rHuEPO on proximal resistance vessels may contribute to development of hypertension seen in rHuEPO-treated hemodialysis patients.\r"

Brush border and basolateral membranes were capable of 73 and 49% degradation of VIP after 20 minutes, and the degradation was totally prevented by bacitracin. There was 66 and 87% specific binding of 125I-VIP to brush border and basolateral membranes, respectively. 125I-VIP binding to renal membrane was displaced in a dose dependent fashion by unlabeled VIP with half maximal displacement at 2 x 10(-7) M. Other related peptides failed to displace VIP. Scatchard analysis showed one single class of receptors for VIP in both membranes with similar Kd (0.5 x 10(-7) M), but higher number of binding sites (Bmax) in the basolateral membranes than in the brush border membranes (22.0 vs. 4.4 pmol/mg protein), respectively. Forty-eight percent of VIP binding to brush border membranes could be explained by cross contamination of these membranes with basolateral membranes. We examined the effect of VIP on Na-H antiporter, Na-dependent glucose uptake and Na-dependent phosphate uptake by isolated proximal tubule suspension. In acid loaded proximal tubules VIP (10(-6) M) inhibited total and amiloride-sensitive 22Na uptake by 35 and 75%, respectively, as compared to control. On the other hand VIP failed to inhibit Na-dependent methyl alpha-14C-glucopyranoside and Na-dependent 32phosphate uptake. VIP failed to stimulate cyclic AMP generation by proximal tubule suspension while PTH showed the expected stimulation. Our results demonstrate the presence of specific binding for VIP in highly purified cortical membranes and suggest an effect of VIP to inhibit the Na-H antiporter by a mechanism independent of cyclic AMP.\r"

  ".W": "Intracellular hydrogen ion (H+) buffering power, conventionally defined as the amount of acid or base that would have to be introduced into the cell cytosol to decrease or increase ipH by one pH unit, is generally said to increase as intracellular pH (ipH) decreases. This implies that the cell has a lesser capability to resist acute acid or base perturbations at its steady state ipH than at any lower ipH. We re-examined this notion, reasoning that the logarithmic nature of the pH unit could limit the validity of the conventional expression of buffering power in imparting physiologic insight into the mechanisms of cellular H+ homeostasis. The mathematical derivation of the formula, delta i[NH4+]/delta ipH, conventionally used to estimate buffering power using the NH4Cl technique, revealed that this parameter is, by design, inversely proportional to the exponential of ipH. This a priori dependence on pH dictates an increase in buffering power with decreasing ipH, and thereby interferes with the assessment of the physiologic capability of the intracellular milieu to buffer protons at different ipH levels. To circumvent this problem, buffering power was defined as the amount of hydrogen ions that would have to be added to or removed from the cell to effect a change in the concentration of H+ in the cell cytosol of 1 mM (a term heretofore referred to as the cell H+ buffering coefficient). The mathematical derivation of the formula used to calculate the cell H+ buffering coefficient, delta i[NH4+]/delta[H+]i, does not suffer from an a priori dependence on ipH.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The receptor had higher affinity for the cobalamin-transcobalamin complex (holo-TC) than for transcobalamin (apo-TC). Basic amino compounds known to interfere with tubular reabsorption of proteins did not inhibit the binding.

Eight patients with CRF and seven matched controls underwent hypertonic saline infusion to explore the relationship of thirst and plasma AVP with plasma osmolality. Differences in urea concentration between the two groups were controlled for by correcting measured osmolality to a urea of zero. Linear regression analysis of the relationships between plasma AVP and thirst with plasma osmolality (corrected for urea) was performed. Mean results were: control, pAVP = 0.26 (pOsmc - 283.7) versus CRF, pAVP = 0.72 (pOsmc - 282.0); and control, thirst = 4.0 (pOsmc - 279.4) versus CRF, thirst = 3.5 (pOsmc - 281.8). The apparent sensitivity (slope) of AVP release was greater in severe CRF than in normal controls (P = 0.04). There was no significant difference between the groups in thirst sensitivity, threshold for thirst onset and threshold for AVP release. Osmoregulated thirst was normal in severe CRF, but increasing osmolality leads to higher concentrations of AVP than would be expected.\r"

To distinguish the differences of the HBV DNA in macrophage, T and B cells among HBVMN patients with or without corticosteroid treatment, serial studies at different time points were investigated. HBV DNA appeared as an \"episomal\" molecule as with 3.2 kb in macrophage, T and B cells. This molecule disappeared after 12 months among HBVMN patients without corticosteroid treatment. HBV DNA, by contrast, appeared as episomal form even three years later in T cells, with frequent proteinuria among HBVMN patients with corticosteroid treatment. This finding indicates that the use of corticosteroids leads to a potential risk of enhancing HBV viral replication in T cells. We studied 24 HBVMN patients who had previously received corticosteroid treatment and had persistent proteinuria, who were administered combination therapy with adenine arabinoside for two weeks and thymic extract (Thymostimulin) for six months to decrease urine protein loss and obtain seroconversion. These 24 patients had heavy (22 of 24, 91.6%) or mild (2 of 24, 8.4%) proteinuria prior to adenine arabinoside and thymostimulin treatment. All 24 patients demonstrated HBV DNA in mononuclear cells and simultaneously exhibited sera positive with HBsAg and HBeAg. In contrast, after treatment only one case (4.2%) had heavy and two cases (8.4%) mild proteinuria; HBV DNA was demonstrated in macrophage (4 of 24, 16.7%), T cells (9 of 24, 37.5%), and B cells (6 of 24, 25%) as well as serum (24 of 24, 100%) prior to treatment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Twenty-four hour urinary ET-1-L1 excretion in patients with renal disease (358 +/- 68 ng, mean +/- SE) was significantly (P less than 0.005) greater than that of normal subjects (77 +/- 5 ng). In patients with renal disease. ET-1-L1 clearance (CET) exceeded creatinine clearance (CCR); CET/CCR (305 +/- 81%) was significantly (P less than 0.005) greater than that of normal subjects (43 +/- 13%). The 24-hour urinary excretion of ET-1-L1 in patients with renal disease showed significant correlation with that of N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (r = 0.587, P less than 0.05), beta 2-microglobulin (r = 0.614, P less than 0.01) and albumin (r = 0.484, P less than 0.05). Intravenous infusion of saline (500 ml) in seven normal subjects did not affect urinary ET-1 excretion rate. These data suggest that urinary excretion of ET-1 derives mainly from renal tubular secretion at least in patients with renal disease, and that degradation and/or reabsorption of ET-1 at the tubular site may also contribute to the renal handling of ET-1. Therefore, urinary excretion of ET-1 should serve as a potential marker for renal injury.\r"

The role of these ligand pairs in cytotoxicity against somatic cells is less well established. While LFA-3 is expressed by all cells in the kidney, ICAM-1 expression is low in normal kidneys but is increased in allograft rejection. An in vitro cytotoxicity assay was used to examine the relative importance of the two adhesion ligands in immune damage against kidney cells in rejection. HLA-A2 specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) recognition of cultured human kidney cells (HKC), of predominantly renal tubular cell origin, was studied. Immunofluorescence studies showed that both induced and uninduced HKC target cells expressed ICAM-1, MHC class I and LFA-3, but only MHC class I and class II antigens and ICAM-1 were significantly upregulated by cytokine induction. Effector cells expressed LFA-1 and LFA-2 but little or no ICAM-1 and LFA-3. Cytokine induction of ICAM-1 expression on HKC target cells increased their susceptibility to lysis. Monoclonal antibody against ICAM-1 or LFA-1 produced the greatest inhibition of HKC lysis, and their effects were not additive.

Using latex, zymosan and staphylococcus as phagocytic challenge, the utilization of glucose-I-C14 and the generation of reactive oxygen species was measured in these patients. In uremic, non-dialysis dependent patients, the response to phagocytosis was significantly reduced when creatinine exceeded 6 mg/dl and prior to initiation of dialysis (mean serum creatinine 9.3 +/- 0.3 mg/dl) was less than half that of patients with normal renal function (P less than 0.01). In a prospective study of 15 patients initiated on dialysis, the metabolic response of their leukocytes was assessed sequentially. In eight patients, initiation of dialysis with cuprophane (Cu) membrane lead to a further decline (60%) in their metabolic response to phagocytosis at the end of four weeks of dialysis compared to pre-initiation of dialysis (P less than 0.01), whereas in seven other patients, dialysis with non-complement activating membranes did not result in a significant decline. Prospective cross-over studies of chronic hemodialysis patients corroborated these findings; eight patients dialyzed with new CU membranes had a significant decline of their metabolic response to phagocytic challenge acutely at the end of each dialysis and in pre-dialysis samples after two weeks of Cu dialysis, whereas their response returned back to baseline after two weeks of dialysis with non-complement activating membrane. In prospective and cross sectional studies, a decreased response to phagocytic stimulus was a predictor of hospitalization, primarily for infectious reasons.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "91163134\r", 
  ".W": "Bypass to the pedal arteries was performed with use of the operating microscope and standard microsurgical technique in 37 patients with severe, chronic ischemia of a lower extremity. Twenty-one patients (57%) had three or more cardiovascular risk factors, and 22 (59%) had diabetes. Preoperative arteriography identified a pedal artery suitable for bypass in all but one patient. The greater or lesser saphenous vein was used in all patients, most frequently as a nonreversed, translocated vein graft. An arm vein was used as part of a composite graft in only one patient. No early deaths occurred, and only one patient had a perioperative myocardial infarction. Although five grafts occluded within 30 days, four were successfully revised, and 36 patients had a patent graft at the time of dismissal from the hospital. At 1 year, the primary graft patency rate (patency without revision) was 60.8%, and the secondary patency rate was 68.8%. One early and six late amputations were performed; the cumulative 1-year limb salvage rate was 82.4%. Grafts with an intraoperative flow rate of 50 ml/min or more had a better patency rate than those with a lower flow rate. The presence of diabetes did not adversely affect long-term patency. Of the 34 patients who were alive at the time of this report, 27 (79%) had a functional foot that allowed ambulation, had no rest pain, and had no substantial loss of tissue. Pedal bypass should be considered for critical, chronic ischemia, even if the patient has an increased surgical risk and advanced distal atherosclerotic disease.\r"

In a multiple logistic regression analysis, the independently significant predictors of the presence of extracranial CAS were, in decreasing order of significance, duration of smoking of cigarettes, hypertension, age, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Serum cholesterol, triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and apolipoprotein A-I did not show an independent effect. Although low-density lipoprotein cholesterol was an independent predictor of the presence of extracranial CAS, its effect as a predictor was far outweighed by the effects of the duration of smoking of cigarettes and a history of hypertension.\r"

  ".W": "After percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, 3 to 7% of patients have in-hospital coronary closure, and the risk of subsequent myocardial infarction is high, even with an urgent bypass operation. Disrupted coronary morphologic integrity, particularly with large dissections, may be associated with an increased risk of acute coronary closure. A percutaneously placed coronary vascular stent may rapidly alleviate acute or threatened coronary closure and could reduce morbidity. Between October 1989 and June 1990, placement of a balloon-expandable, flexible metallic coil (Gianturco-Roubin) coronary stent was attempted 16 times in 15 Mayo Clinic patients--for treatment of actual or threatened abrupt coronary closure in 10 patients, for primary treatment of a lesion judged to be at high risk for dissection with conventional balloon angioplasty in 1, and for elective treatment of restenotic lesions in 5. Placement of the stent was successful in 15 attempts (94%). Associated complications, which were uncommon, were similar to those noted after balloon angioplasty. No early deaths occurred, and no patient required coronary artery bypass grafting. Stents were successfully placed in both urgent and elective circumstances in native coronary arteries and saphenous vein grafts, and they were used in primary atheromatous and restenotic lesions. Our initial experience with this metallic coil stent indicates that it is efficacious for vascular disruption that is threatening or causing coronary closure after angioplasty. Furthermore, elective placement of a stent may be safely undertaken in patients with high-risk coronary lesions or recurrent restenotic lesions. The long-term outcome in all groups of patients who receive coronary stents is unknown.\r"

Recently, a new balloon catheter with an \"hourglass\" shape and specially designed guidewires and dilators has become available (Inoue balloon). The design of this balloon provides ease of manipulation and self-stabilization across the mitral valve during inflation. These features should decrease the incidence of complications associated with the procedure. Preliminary results in 12 consecutive patients who underwent percutaneous mitral balloon valvuloplasty with the Inoue balloon are presented. The mitral valve area increased from 0.92 +/- 0.21 cm2 before the procedure to 1.75 +/- 0.40 cm2 after the procedure. No complications occurred from the procedure, including no increase in severity of mitral regurgitation or creation of an atrial septal defect. Further follow-up is necessary to determine the long-term efficacy with this new balloon. Nonetheless, the preliminary results are encouraging.\r"

The ability of this drug to inhibit the growth of malignant cells and to control gastrointestinal hemorrhage will prompt additional clinical trials. Because some of these patients may have thrombocytopenia, platelet dysfunction, or a coagulopathy, we studied tests of platelet function and blood coagulation in 15 patients before and after 14 days of therapy with octreotide acetate at a dosage of 500 micrograms three times daily. We found no substantial change in the results of these tests, and no patient experienced bleeding or thrombosis. These results suggest that octreotide acetate does not adversely affect platelet function or the coagulation system in humans.\r"

Chromosome studies were successful in 86 patients, 37 (43%) of whom had a chromosome abnormality. At diagnosis, 4 of 28 patients (14%) had an abnormal clone; the incidence was 78% in PPVMM and 100% in leukemia-myelodysplastic syndrome. Among the 63 patients with successful chromosome studies during the first 10 years of disease, 27% had an abnormal clone. In contrast, of the 23 patients who had the disease for more than 10 years, 87% had an abnormal clone. Chromosome abnormalities were found in 11 of the 60 patients who either were untreated or underwent only phlebotomy and in 26 of the 44 patients who were treated with myelosuppressive agents. Trisomy 8, +9, and 20q- were found in some patients early during the course of their disease and also among untreated patients. These chromosome abnormalities seem to be related to the natural course of PV rather than to therapy. Patients with a chromosomally abnormal clone at the time of diagnosis of PV had a poorer survival than did those with only normal metaphases. Cytogenetic results did not predict evolution of the disease, but they did provide clues to hematologic phenotype, duration of the disease, and consequences of myelosuppressive therapy.\r"

The standard treatment has been benzodiazepines. An association has been reported between stiff-man syndrome and epilepsy, insulin-dependent diabetes, and a variety of organ-specific autoimmune disorders. Antibodies directed against glutamic acid decarboxylase and against pancreatic islet cells have been detected in the serum and cerebrospinal of patients with stiff-man syndrome. These findings suggest that stiff-man syndrome may be an autoimmune disease. Preliminary reports indicate that patients with stiff-man syndrome have a favorable response to plasma exchange and corticosteroid therapy.\r"

Various diseases, such as allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, bronchiectasis, and cystic fibrosis, have been associated with the formation of bronchial casts and should be considered in the differential diagnosis. Although most previously reported cases have been associated with some type of pulmonary disease, our patient had no evidence of an underlying pulmonary disorder.\r"

The patient's history was remarkable for type II diabetes, for which glipizide therapy had been initiated 2 months earlier. No other medications were being taken at the time the paroxysms of pain began. During the episodes of pain, both examination of the abdomen and abdominal roentgenograms revealed normal findings. Initial assessment, including ultrasonography and computed tomographic scanning of the abdomen, upper gastrointestinal and colon roentgenograms, and esophagogastroduodenoscopy, revealed no cause of the pain. Empiric trials of famotidine, sucralfate, and antacids failed to relieve the pain. Both urine and fecal specimens collected after an attack demonstrated substantially increased coproporphyrins. The glipizide regimen was discontinued; 2 months later, the stool coproporphyrins had decreased to normal levels. At follow-up more than 1 year later, the patient had had no recurrence of abdominal pain. Although other orally administered hypoglycemic agents and other sulfa compounds have been reported to precipitate acute attacks of porphyria, to our knowledge this is the first such case associated with glipizide. We suggest that glipizide be added to the list of medications to be avoided in patients with porphyria.\r"

Existing tests use EBV antigens produced in EBV-infected lymphoblastoid cells, but the virus replicates poorly in these cells. Serum samples from 18 patients diagnosed as having nasopharyngeal carcinoma were screened by western blot analysis, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and immunofluorescence tests for antibodies to the EBV-coded alkaline deoxyribonuclease (DNase), thymidine kinase, and membrane antigen (gp340/220) produced in recombinant baculovirus or bovine papillomavirus systems. Each protein was a useful diagnostic marker for nasopharyngeal carcinoma, although in the gp340/220 ELISAs there was substantial overlap for both IgG and IgA antibodies between serum samples from nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients and those from healthy donors seropositive for EBV. The EBV thymidine kinase was the most sensitive predictor of nasopharyngeal carcinoma; all such samples showed both IgG and IgA antibody responses to this protein and all gave clearly distinct titres from those of the EBV-seropositive donors in the IgA test. Each of the recombinant systems described is suitable for use in large-scale screening programmes for the early diagnosis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma.\r"

Ten atopic subjects were selected for the study on the basis of an immediate fall in forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) of at least 15% and a least a doubling dose fall in their PC20-histamine (the concentration of histamine needed to reduce FEV1 by 20%) after antigen challenge. Baseline PC20-histamine was determined before the ingestion of a single oral 40 mg dose of ICI 204.219 or matched placebo. 2 h later subjects were challenged with aerosolised allergen; FEV1 was measured for the next 6 h then PC20-histamine was remeasured. Two subjects did not complete the study for reasons not related to the trial medication. ICI 204.219 significantly attenuated the early and late phase bronchoconstriction to inhaled allergen (mean treatment difference in area under the FEV1-time curves 2529 [95% Cl 1085-3972] delta %FEV1.min; p less than 0.005: and 3537 [528-6545] delta %FEV1.min; p less than 0.03) and suppressed the allergen-induced increase in non-specific bronchial reactivity (mean treatment difference 1.03 [0.34-1.71] doubling dilutions of histamine; p less than 0.01). These findings suggest that ICI 204.219 may be a disease-modifying agent in asthma. Further studies are under way to evaluate its clinical efficacy.\r"

  ".W": "Angelman's syndrome and Prader-Willi syndrome are both causes of mental retardation with recognisable, but quite different, clinical phenotypes. Both are associated with deletions of chromosome 15q11-13, of maternal origin in Angelman's and paternal in Prader-Willi. Prader-Willi can arise by inheritance of two chromosomes 15 from the mother and none from the father (uniparental maternal disomy). In 2 patients with Angelman's syndrome we found evidence of uniparental paternal disomy. The phenotypic effects of maternal and paternal disomy of chromosome 15 are very different and inheritance of two normal 15s from one parent does not lead to normal development--strong evidence in man for genomic imprinting, in which the same gene has different effects dependent upon its parental origin.\r"

  ".W": "There is extensive pharmacological and physiological evidence that endothelin-1 influences airway calibre. In mammals, endothelin receptor occur on airway smooth muscle, local storage and release of the peptide have been demonstrated, and inhalation of endothelin-1 induces bronchoconstriction. To investigate the relation between endothelins and asthma the expression of this peptide in endobronchial biopsy specimens was examined immunohistochemically with an antiserum against endothelin-1. Biopsy specimens from 17 asthmatic patients and 11 atopic and non-atopic healthy controls revealed striking differences, with endothelin expression being evident in airways epithelium and vascular endothelium in 11 of the 17 asthmatic patients but in only 1 of 11 controls. These results suggest that endothelins may play a part in the exaggerated bronchomotor tone of asthma.\r"

Our prospective study of HIV seroprevalence among 2724 pregnant women in an inner-city area of Baltimore, USA, showed that if these guidelines had been applied only 57% of HIV-seropositive women would have been detected. By offering counselling and HIV testing to all pregnant women, the detection rate was raised to 87%. We conclude that screening directed at women who admit risk factors is not effective in identifying HIV-infected women and that routine HIV screening should be offered to all pregnant women.\r"

None of these patients responded to chemotherapy. The proportion of patients responding to therapy and 50% patient survival rose with in-vitro drug sensitivity. 11 specimens showing extreme drug resistance to the agents prescribed for the patient were subjected to drug sensitivity tests of drugs not prescribed; patients showing some sensitivity to these drugs had better survival than did those with extreme drug resistance to all drugs tested. The DiSC assay can also be used to identify new agents worth testing in clinical trials, and cross resistance profiles of new agents may indicate what combinations might be useful.\r"

  ".U": "91163220\r", 
  ".W": "We have recorded the duration of lactational anovulation and amenorrhoea in a well-nourished group of Australian women who breastfed their babies throughout the study. The data enabled us to compare the theoretical cumulative probability of conception among breastfeeding women who had unprotected intercourse irrespective of their menstrual status with that of those who had unprotected intercourse only during lactational amenorrhoea. Breastfeeding alone is not an effective form of contraception, since all the women in our study resumed normal ovulation while still breastfeeding. However, among women who have unprotected intercourse only during lactational amenorrhoea but adopt other contraceptive measures when they resume menstruation, only 1.7% would have become pregnant during the first 6 months of amenorrhoea, only 7% after 12 months, and only 13% after 24 months. Thus for our women it would be possible to extend the Bellagio Consensus Conference guidelines which stated that lactational amenorrhoea can only be relied on as a contraceptive for the first 6 months post-partum in women who are fully or almost fully breastfeeding. The lactational amenorrhoea method can be relied on for excellent contraceptive protection in the first 6 months of breastfeeding, irrespective of when supplements are introduced into the baby's diet; for women who continue to breastfeed the method can also give good protection for up to 12 months post partum. Once menstruation has returned, other forms of contraception are essential to prevent pregnancy.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND AND METHODS. We assessed community trends in the awareness, treatment, and control of hypercholesterolemia (defined as a serum cholesterol level greater than 6.21 mmol per liter [240 mg per deciliter]) during the 1980s in the Minneapolis-St. Paul (Twin Cities) metropolitan area. Twin Cities residents 25 to 74 years old participated in independent, cross-sectional, population-based surveys of risk factors for cardiovascular disease in 1980-1982 (n = 3365) and 1985-1987 (n = 4545). RESULTS. Mean serum total cholesterol levels, as adjusted for age, decreased significantly (P less than 0.01) from 1980-1982 to 1985-1987 in men (from 5.30 mmol per liter [205 mg per deciliter] to 5.16 mmol per liter [200 mg per deciliter]) and women (from 5.19 mmol per liter [201 mg per deciliter] to 5.04 mmol per liter [195 mg per deciliter]). The prevalence of hypercholesterolemia as adjusted for age decreased significantly (P less than 0.05) in men (17.8 to 15.1 percent) and women (17.1 to 13.6 percent). The ratio of total cholesterol to high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol was unchanged during this period, because of a concurrent decline in the level of HDL cholesterol. Participants with hypercholesterolemia in the 1985-1987 survey were more likely than those in the 1980-1982 survey to be aware of their condition (32.6 vs. 25.4 percent), to be treated with lipid-lowering agents (4.3 vs. 1.9 percent), and to have their condition controlled (1.9 vs. 0.3 percent). Among those who reported treatment by a physician for hyperlipidemia, changes were observed in the type of treatment recommended. A significant increase (P less than 0.05) was noted from 1980-1982 to 1985-1987 in the percentage of men being treated for hyperlipidemia with lipid-lowering medication (5.2 vs. 11.6 percent) and with exercise programs (10.3 vs. 20.1 percent). In women being treated for hyperlipidemia, a nonsignificant increase was noted in the use of lipid-lowering medication (8.2 vs. 13.9 percent), and a significant increase (P less than 0.05) was observed in the number of exercise prescriptions (4.1 vs. 12.0 percent). CONCLUSIONS. We found a substantial decline in the prevalence of hypercholesterolemia in the Twin Cities between 1980-1982 and 1985-1987 that may be attributed to changes in lifestyle, such as diet and exercise, and to a lesser extent to more aggressive intervention with lipid-lowering drugs by physicians.\r"

Since then, similar observations of attenuated circadian amplitude in response to critical stimuli have been limited to unicells, insects and plants. Our recent demonstration that the phase of the human circadian pacemaker could be inverted using an unconventional three-cycle stimulus led us to investigate whether critically timed exposure to a more moderate stimulus could drive that oscillator towards its singularity. Here we report that exposure of humans to fewer cycles of bright light, centred around the time at which the human circadian pacemaker is most sensitive to light-induced phase shifts, can markedly attenuate endogenous circadian amplitude. In some cases this results in an apparent loss of rhythmicity, as expected to occur in the region of singularity.\r"

A short amino-acid sequence at the carboxy terminus of the gamma chain of fibrinogen is recognized by gpIIb-IIIa and peptides containing this sequence are selectively crosslinked to residues 294-314 of gpIIb. Here we show that an 11-residue peptide from this region of gpIIb inhibits platelet aggregation and binding of fibrinogen to platelets and to purified gpIIb-IIIa, and that it interacts directly with fibrinogen. These results implicate this segment of gpIIb-IIIa in the ligand-binding function of the receptor. Moreover, as this region is highly conserved among integrins, it may have a general function in ligand recognition by this broadly distributed family of adhesion receptors.\r"

Integrin binding to extracellular ligands regulates cell adhesion, shape, motility, intracellular signalling and gene expression. Mechanisms that regulate integrin function are, therefore, central to the participation of integrins in a diverse set of cellular events. Here we report the identification of TASC, a monoclonal antibody to a novel epitope on the integrin beta 1 subunit, which inhibits cell adhesion to vitronectin but promotes adhesion to laminin and collagen types I and IV. We show that developing retinal neurons that have lost responsiveness to laminin regain the ability to bind laminin in the presence of TASC. Thus, beta 1-class integrins are likely to occupy multiple affinity states that can be modulated at the cell surface.\r"

Here we report what seems to be the first direct cloning and characterization of a complementary DNA encoding a peroxisomal membrane protein of relative molecular mass 35,000 (Mr35K) that restores the biogenesis of peroxisomes and complements the defect of peroxisomal functions in the mutant Z65.\r"

  ".U": "91163639\r", 
  ".W": "In recent years there has been considerable interest in the role of retinoic acid (RA) in vertebrate-limb pattern formation. When RA is applied to the anterior of the chick wing bud, a mirror-image duplication of the limb pattern develops that is identical to the pattern resulting from grafts of posterior tissue (zone of polarizing activity, or ZPA). It has been proposed that position along the anterior-posterior axis in the chick limb is specified by a gradient of a diffusible factor produced by the ZPA. The ZPA-mimicking action of RA has led to the hypothesis that exogenously applied RA acts by providing graded spatial information across the anterior-posterior limb axis. An alternative interpretation is that RA changes anterior cells into ZPA cells, which in turn provide the actual pattern-duplicating stimulus; there is already some preliminary evidence that this occurs. A hybrid interpretation has also been suggested whereby ZPA cells are formed in response to RA exposure and then begin to release retinoids that act as graded spatial cues. We have used a functional assay to test anterior chick wing-bud cells for ZPA activity after exposure to RA. The results of our studies indicate that the action of RA is to change anterior cells into ZPA cells. Further, our results indicate that it is unlikely that RA-treated anterior cells then begin producing RA in such a way as to provide a graded positional signal.\r"

In chick limb formation, it is thought that retinoic acid is released from the zone of polarizing activity (ZPA) and the concentration gradient of retinoic acid formed from the posterior to the anterior provides positional cues for digit formation. Implantation of a bead containing retinoic acid at the anterior margin of the limb bud induces a mirror-image symmetrical duplication of the digit pattern similar to that observed when the ZPA is grafted into the anterior margin of the host limb bud. Also, the level of endogenous retinoic acid (25 nM on average) is higher in the posterior one third of the limb bud. We found that when the bead containing either retinoic acid or an analogue but not the ZPA, was implanted in the anterior margin of the chick limb bud, expression of the retinoic acid receptor type-beta gene was induced around the bead within 4 h. These results indicate that exogenous retinoic acid is not identical with the ZPA morphogen. As the anterior tissue exposed to retinoic acid has polarizing activity, we conclude that the primary function of exogenous retinoic acid is to induce polarizing activity in the limb bud.\r"

  ".U": "91163641\r", 
  ".W": "Galactose oxidase is an extracellular enzyme secreted by the fungus Dactylium dendroides. It is monomeric, with a relative molecular mass of 68,000, catalyses the stereospecific oxidation of a broad range of primary alcohol substrates and possesses a unique mononuclear copper site essential for catalysing a two-electron transfer reaction during the oxidation of primary alcohols to corresponding aldehydes. Recent evidence arguing against a Cu(III)-Cu(I) couple implies the existence of a second redox-active site proposed to involve pyrroloquinoline quinone or a tyrosine radical. We now report the crystal structure of galactose oxidase at 1.7 A resolution. This reveals a unique structural feature at the copper site with a novel thioether bond linking Cys 228 and Tyr 272 in a stacking interaction with Trp 290. We propose that these molecular components stabilize the protein free-radical species essential for catalysis and thus provide a 'built-in' secondary cofactor. This feature may represent a new mechanism for mediating electron transfer in metalloenzymes in the absence of exogenous cofactors.\r"

  ".U": "91163860\r", 
  ".W": "The rate of delivery by cesarean has increased steadily in the United States since the 1970s. The reasons for this increase are not fully established. Improved diagnosis of maternal and fetal complications, medicolegal concerns, and the changing age composition of childbearing women have been cited as contributing factors. To assess whether advanced maternal age by itself is an indicator for a primary cesarean delivery, we analyzed data from the vital records of all female residents of King County, Washington 35 years and older (N = 2985) who had a live singleton birth in 1986 or 1987. These women were compared with a sample of women 20-29 years old (N = 6140) who gave birth in the same time period and geographic area. Primiparous and multiparous women 35 years and older were at a similar increased risk of cesarean (relative risk = 1.6, 95% confidence interval 1.1-2.4). Primiparous women of all ages experienced more complications of pregnancy and labor and higher cesarean delivery rates. However, among primiparous mothers with no recorded complications, older women were at significantly increased risk of cesarean birth (relative risk = 2.5, 95% confidence interval 1.8-3.5). This analysis suggests that advanced maternal age alone may influence a physician's decision regarding method of delivery, thereby placing some older women at an unnecessary risk of cesarean.\r"

  ".W": "To determine whether cesarean delivery is associated with a better outcome than vaginal delivery for infants weighing less than 1500 g (very low birth weight), we examined neonatal mortality and the incidence of intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) in 1765 very low birth weight inborn infants admitted to seven neonatal intensive care centers. The cesarean rate was 32.5% for infants weighing 501-750 g and 52.4% for infants weighing 751-1000 g. The neonatal death rate was 53.1% for infants weighing 501-750 g delivered by cesarean, compared with 64.3% for vaginally born infants (P = .046). However, for infants weighing 1001-1250 g, the neonatal death rate for infants delivered by cesarean was 14.4%, compared with 7.8% for infants born vaginally (P = .02). The incidence of IVH was significantly lower in infants born by cesarean than in those born vaginally only in the 1251-1500-g birth weight interval (11.8 versus 18.9%; P = .03). Compared with women delivering vaginally, those delivered by cesarean were more likely to attain a higher mean gestation, to have preeclampsia, and to have a breech presentation, and less likely to be in labor. After adjusting by logistic regression for gestational age, preeclampsia, breech presentation, presence or absence of labor, and for center effects, the odds ratio for neonatal death was 1.00 (95% confidence interval 0.71-1.41); for IVH, the odds ratio was 0.85 (95% confidence interval 0.61-1.19). These data suggest that after accounting for certain maternal and fetal factors, cesarean delivery is not associated with a lower risk of either mortality or IVH.\r"

Toluene-induced renal tubular acidosis occurred in over half of these women and was clustered among long-duration abusers. The renal acidosis placed the mother at risk for hypokalemia, with associated cardiac dysrhythmias and rhabdomyolysis. Beta-mimetics and intravenous fluid for preterm labor therapy potentially exacerbated the electrolyte abnormalities. Among 21 newborns exposed to toluene in utero, preterm delivery, perinatal death, and growth retardation were significantly increased. Delivery during uncorrected maternal acidosis further compromised these infants. As children, growth retardation and developmental delay were common findings. Recognition of the unique obstetric and medical characteristics of the toluene-abusing woman is needed if complications are to be averted and perinatal outcomes improved.\r"

The mean maternal age, race, and parity of these three groups did not differ significantly. The patients with preeclampsia had significantly less excretion of total calcium (129.7 +/- 18.7 mg/24 hours) (mean +/- SEM) than normotensives (283.9 +/- 12.3) or those with gestational hypertension (233.2 +/- 22.3) (P = .0001). The mean arterial pressure and excretion of total protein were significantly increased in the preeclampsia group (P = .0001). Using the receiver operator curve, a urine calcium threshold of 12 mg/dL was chosen as predictive for the development of preeclampsia, with a sensitivity of 85%, specificity of 91%, and positive and negative predictive values of 85 and 91%, respectively. Urinary calcium levels below 12 mg/dL may help distinguish preeclampsia from other hypertensive disorders of pregnancy.\r"

Pregnancy-induced hypertension was defined as two or more occurrences after 20 weeks' gestation of a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 105 mmHg or greater or an increase of 20 mmHg or greater from the baseline MAP. The rate of PIH in the diabetic population was 15.4% and was significantly associated with nulliparity, poor glycemic control in the first and second trimesters, and advanced White class. Neonatal outcome was not significantly altered in the presence of PIH. We speculate that improved glycemic control throughout pregnancy might reduce the rate of this complication in diabetic patients.\r"

  ".W": "The differences in both the biology of pregnancy and the content of routine care between gravidas with and without diabetes mellitus lead to important differences in the potential utility of both ultrasound examination and maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (MSAFP) screening. However, both diagnostic methods have become standards of care for these patients, without critical evaluation. This study examines the utility of both ultrasound and MSAFP in diabetic women. Four hundred thirty-two women with diabetes mellitus antedating pregnancy were examined sonographically between 12-23 weeks' gestation. Of these, 393 were also screened with MSAFP determinations. At delivery, 32 of these fetuses were found to have 38 major congenital malformations. All fatal or potentially life-threatening defects had been diagnosed in utero by sonography before 24 weeks' gestation. Ultrasound had a positive predictive value of 90% and a negative predictive value of 97% for identification of major birth defects before 24 weeks' gestation. There were 14 MSAFP values greater than 2.0 multiples of the median, and nine of these patients elected to undergo amniocentesis. Maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein screening had a positive predictive value of 17% and a negative predictive value of 94%. No malformations were detected through MSAFP screening that had not been diagnosed by sonography. No malformations missed sonographically were detected by MSAFP screening, and none of the amniocenteses were helpful diagnostically. We conclude that MSAFP screening is of minimal utility for diagnosing major congenital malformations in a high-risk population examined universally by an experienced sonographer.\r"

The majority of perforations occurred on the fingers of the nondominant hand. Multivariate analysis with logistic regression indicated that cesarean delivery (odds ratio 3.52), any vaginal laceration or episiotomy (odds ratio 4.95), and chief resident status (odds ratio 3.00) were the major risk factors for surgical glove perforation. Surgical technique by assistants, especially in complex cases, is as important as that of the primary surgeon in regard to glove perforations.\r"

Magnetic resonance imaging provided excellent detail of intracranial anatomy in all cases. In four of the 13 fetuses, the MRI diagnosis differed from that of ultrasound and ultimately proved correct. In another three, MRI added greatly to the ultrasound diagnosis by delineating intracranial anatomy more precisely. In the remaining six cases, MRI confirmed the ultrasound impression. For circumstances in which the ultrasound diagnosis is unclear or antenatal intervention might require exact knowledge of anatomical detail, the additional information provided by MRI may justify its cost.\r"

The sensitivity of nuchal skinfold thickness for Down syndrome detection was 75% (12 of 16 cases). When adjusted for the incidence of Down syndrome in the general population (one in 710 births), the positive predictive value of nuchal skinfold thickness for Down syndrome detection was one in 13. The observed sensitivity, false-positive rate, and predictive value suggest that amniocentesis should be offered when a nuchal skinfold thickness of 6 mm or greater is observed between 14-21 weeks' gestation.\r"

In this report, aggressive therapeutic amniocentesis restored amniotic fluid volume to normal in both sacs in all pregnancies. Fetal hydrops resolved in three of five (60%) of the fetuses affected. Pregnancy was extended a mean 80 +/- 33 days (+/- 2 SD) and perinatal survival was 79%. These findings contrast dramatically with the virtual 100% mortality reported in the literature with no therapy. Repeated aggressive amniocentesis effectively reversed the physiology of twin-twin transfusion syndrome and should be the treatment of choice for acute hydramnios, which previously had no recommended therapy.\r"

In this study we report our experiences with aggressive decompression of megacystis in 11 patients, the value in selected cases of sequential evaluations of fetal urine biochemistry, and the success of intrauterine bladder shunting procedures in appropriately chosen patients. Our data suggest that a single fetal urine determination may be insufficient to declare irreversible damage. Following decompression, improvement in urine biochemistry or its lack may be more likely representative of ultimate outcome. Decompression by either needle aspiration or intrauterine shunting is warranted in carefully selected cases and can save fetuses that are otherwise very likely doomed.\r"

We hypothesized that alterations in umbilical venous blood flow velocities are present in fetuses with abnormal umbilical arterial circulation, and further, that changes in inferior vena cava blood flow velocities occur with, and might explain, these variations in umbilical venous blood flow velocities. Umbilical venous and inferior vena cava blood flow velocities were examined in 15 normal fetuses and in 59 fetuses with abnormalities that included absent end-diastolic umbilical artery blood flow velocities (N = 21) or abnormal heart rates (N = 27). Inferior vena cava velocities were also analyzed in 11 other fetuses with anomalies or known growth or placental abnormalities who had abnormal umbilical venous blood flow velocities. In normal fetuses, variations in umbilical venous velocities occurred during fetal activity or with fetal breathing; however, no variation in velocity corresponded with heart rate. Eleven of 21 fetuses with absent end-diastolic velocities in the umbilical artery demonstrated decreases in umbilical venous velocities (\"venous pulsations\") during arterial diastole. Blood flow velocities in the reverse direction, from the right atrium into the inferior vena cava with atrial contraction, were significantly greater in these fetuses than in those without umbilical venous pulsations (27.5 +/- 14.9% and 7.5 +/- 5.7% of total forward flow velocity, respectively; P less than .001). Venous pulsations were also seen in fetuses with abnormally fast or slow heart rates; reverse flow with atrial contraction in the inferior vena cava was likewise greater than normal in these fetuses.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The laparoscopic procedure was aborted or the cyst was aspirated in 38% of the cases, and partial or complete excisions were attempted in 33 and 29%, respectively. The characteristics of the masses were as follows: less than 8 cm 67%, cystic 62%, unilocular 48%, and unilateral 81%. All four \"benign\" characteristics were present in 31% of the cases found to be malignant, and three of four characteristics were present in 24%. Laparotomy was performed at the time of laparoscopy in 17% of cases, after laparoscopy in 71% with an average interval of 4.8 weeks, and not at all in 12%. Fifty-seven percent of the cases were invasive epithelial malignancies, whereas 29% were tumors of low malignant potential. At least 50% of the patients had stages II-IV. We conclude that attempted laparoscopic excisions of adnexal masses that are subsequently found to be malignant are not uncommon, and that the presence of so-called \"benign\" characteristics does not preclude malignancy. Attempts at partial or complete excision are common, as are delays in subsequent definitive surgery. The stage of disease is often advanced, and all histologic types of malignancy are encountered. We advocate careful evaluation of this practice, with development of strict guidelines to ensure optimal patient care.\r"

Squamous cell carcinoma antigen was pathologic in 47%, aminoterminal propeptide of type III procollagen in 40%, CA 125 in 13%, CA 15-3 in 30%, and TAG 72 in 9% of the 91 patients with squamous cell carcinoma. The squamous cell carcinoma antigen, aminoterminal propeptide of type III procollagen, and CA 125 correlated with the clinical stage. The predictive value of a pathologic squamous cell carcinoma antigen was 78% and that of a negative result 68%. Squamous cell carcinoma antigen and aminoterminal propeptide of type III procollagen further increased the detection rate by approximately 20% from that obtained by squamous cell carcinoma antigen alone. In 16 patients with advanced disease, squamous cell carcinoma antigen correlated with the behavior of the disease in eight, aminoterminal propeptide of type III procollagen in nine, and CA 125 in six patients. Pathologic squamous cell carcinoma antigen, CA 125, CA 15-3, TAG 72, and aminoterminal propeptide of type III procollagen appeared in 11, 32, 31, 31, and 47% of 19 patients with adenocarcinoma, respectively. Squamous cell carcinoma antigen is clinically useful in squamous cell carcinoma but poor in adenocarcinoma, for which the other markers are better. Squamous cell carcinoma antigen, CA 125, and aminoterminal propeptide of type III procollagen may be used for monitoring the behavior of advanced squamous cell carcinoma.\r"

From December 1988 to March 1990, 27 patients underwent ultrasonic surgery; nine patients had vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN) and 18 had condylomata acuminata. All surgical procedures were done under general anesthesia, with two patients requiring hospitalization for perineal care and pain control after extensive vulvar surgery. Recurrent or persistent disease occurred in four patients with condylomata acuminata and in two with VIN, with a mean follow-up of 50 weeks. Reepithelialization was completed within 5 weeks and no patients developed vulvar scarring. Adequate samples for histopathologic review were obtained in 26 patients. Identical histologic grading occurred in all 13 patients who had preoperative vulvar biopsies and an adequate aspiration specimen. Ultrasonic surgery permits precise and rapid removal of epithelial lesions with rapid healing, minimal patient discomfort, excellent cosmetic results, and histopathologic documentation.\r"

  ".W": "CA 19-9, a side branch of the Lewis blood group system, is a sialylated Lewis A antigen that is highly expressed by many adenocarcinomas of the digestive tract. The mullerian duct-derived mucosa of the uterus and fallopian tubes also synthesizes Lewis blood group antigens. To test whether the expression of CA 19-9 is enhanced in carcinomas of mullerian duct origin, we performed immunohistochemical staining for CA 19-9 in normal tissues from 33 women and in adenocarcinomas from 88 patients. In the normal uterine cervix, CA 19-9 was expressed in the cytoplasm of scattered glandular cells in 26 of 29 specimens. It was observed in the apical regions of mucosal cells in six of 26 normal endometrial samples and two of 13 normal fallopian tube specimens. These results are consistent with the presence of antigen CA 19-9 on a secretory product of the nondiseased mucosa of the mullerian duct. In adenocarcinomas of the endocervix, endometrium, and fallopian tubes, CA 19-9 was found in seven of 11, 57 of 71, and five of six samples, respectively. Progressive loss of differentiation was accompanied by disruption of subcellular localization of CA 19-9 and its secretion toward the glandular lumina. In well-differentiated regions of tumors, the antigen was detected mainly at the luminal surface of cancerous glands, whereas the staining was mostly cytoplasmic or vacuolar in less differentiated areas. The degree of CA 19-9 expression was inversely related to tumor differentiation (P less than .001).\r"

Preoperatively, there was no difference in pressure transmission ratios between urethral pressure profiles associated with leakage of urine and those without urine leakage. Postoperatively, there were differences in pressure transmission ratios between leak and nonleak profiles in the sitting full and supine positions (P less than .001). We could not determine a threshold pressure transmission ratio that was more characteristically associated with leakage of urine. Finally, preoperative pressure transmission ratios were not associated with surgical success, but the higher the postoperative pressure transmission ratio, the more likely the surgery was to be successful (P = .023). In addition, the greater the difference between preoperative and postoperative pressure transmission ratios, the more likely was a cure (P = .011). The pressure transmission ratio may not be helpful in discriminating leak from nonleak dynamic urethral pressure profiles, and there may not be a threshold pressure transmission ratio below which patients characteristically leak urine. However, comparison of preoperative and postoperative pressure transmission ratios is helpful in determining the adequacy of surgical correction of the anatomical defect associated with genuine stress incontinence.\r"

Ninety-four patients underwent submucous resection alone and 62 patients underwent endometrial ablation with or without submucous resection.

Among the ablation group, 22.5% experienced recurrence of increased bleeding and 8.1% had another surgical procedure. After 6 years of follow-up, 91.3% of the patients had not required further surgery. Twenty-one patients became pregnant after submucous resection, with 18 infants delivered. No patients who underwent endometrial ablation became pregnant. This modality of treatment appears to be effective over the long term, although effectiveness appears to diminish with time.\r"

  ".W": "Women who receive little or no prenatal care are at increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcome. Although many of these women are disadvantaged and presumably at increased risk for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, few data are available to describe risk behaviors and infection prevalence in this population. To better characterize HIV infection in unregistered inner-city parturients in Atlanta, we offered routine voluntary screening for HIV antibody and requested HIV risk-behavior profiles on all unregistered and registered parturients seen at Grady Memorial Hospital from July 1, 1987 to June 30, 1988. Of the 834 unregistered and 7356 registered parturients screened, significantly more unregistered parturients were seropositive on enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blot testing, 12 (1.4%) versus 26 (0.4%) (odds ratio 4.06; 95% confidence interval 1.93-8.43). Five unregistered and 15 registered parturients were seropositive by repeat enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay testing but were Western blot-negative. Significantly more unregistered parturients reported both a history of intravenous drug use, 4.4 versus 1.5% (odds ratio 3.09; 95% confidence interval 2.10-4.54), and crack cocaine use, 3 versus 0.8% (odds ratio 3.96; 95% confidence interval 2.42-6.44). Significantly more unregistered parturients acknowledged risk factors for HIV infection, 14.3 versus 9.9% (odds ratio 1.46; 95% confidence interval 1.19-1.80). Nearly all registered and 86% of unregistered parturients consented to HIV testing. Nearly all parturients completed HIV risk-behavior questionnaires. These data suggest that unregistered inner-city parturients in Atlanta are at greater risk of being HIV-infected and are more likely to report risk behaviors for infection.\r"

The prevalence of group B Streptococcus was 18.6%, and was greatest in (predominantly Caribbean) Hispanics from New York City, followed by blacks, whites, and other (predominantly Mexican) Hispanics. Group B Streptococcus was more common among older women and women of lower parity, and less common among women living with their partner compared with those living alone. Current smoking was associated with a decreased risk of colonization, and group B Streptococcus was less common among women with more education. Increased risk was seen only with extreme increases in sexual activity including both frequent intercourse and multiple partners during the previous year. The risk of colonization was greater when there was concurrent colonization with Candida sp, but group B Streptococcus was not associated with carriage of Chlamydia trachomatis, Ureaplasma urealyticum, Trichomonas vaginalis, and Mycoplasma hominis. External genital erythema and scaling, purulent vaginal discharge, and pH greater than 5 were associated with increased colonization. Although these associations can raise the clinical index of suspicion for group B streptococcal colonization in a given patient, the study data did not enable us to select a small group of women with a very high probability of colonization. We conclude that selective screening is not useful in detecting group B streptococcal colonization in pregnancy.\r"

No significant effects induced by noise exposure could be registered in these variables. Fetal and uterine blood circulation was also examined with a duplex pulsed Doppler system. No changes were seen on the fetal side as measured from the descending aorta in blood flow velocity (cm/second) or pulsatility or resistance indexes in either normotensive or hypertensive pregnancy. The only change observed was an increase in fetal heart rate in normotensive pregnancy. However, this increase could not be confirmed by cardiotocographic registration and is not clinically important. Uterine blood circulation was recorded from the proximal uterine artery on the placental side, and no effect of exposure was seen on pulsatility or resistance indexes.\r"

Placental insufficiency was defined by antenatal Doppler ultrasound analysis of the umbilical artery waveform, which was used to categorize the subjects according to whether their systolic-diastolic ratios were normal, moderately raised, or severely raised. Mean platelet life span in fetuses affected by placental insufficiency was only 60% of the normal fetal platelet life span (P less than .001). In addition, affected fetuses had a higher rate of platelet turnover, reflected in an elevated plasma glycocalicin concentration (4.06 +/- 0.19 versus 3.28 +/- 0.15 microgram/mL for severe placental insufficiency and control fetuses, respectively; P less than .01). Platelet life span did not differ between the moderate and severe placental insufficiency groups.

There was a significant relationship between the fetal biophysical profile score and cord arterial as well as cord venous pH. However, there was no identifiable relationship between S/D and cord arterial or venous pH. The efficacies of the biophysical components alone (nonstress test [NST] and fetal biophysical profile) and in combination with S/D to predict fetal acidosis were determined. The NST had the best sensitivity (100%) and negative predictive value (100%). The fetal biophysical profile had the best specificity (91%), positive predictive value (62%), and overall efficiency (90%). The S/D had the lowest sensitivity (66%), specificity (42%), positive predictive value (16%), negative predictive value (88%), and overall efficiency (45%). The addition of S/D to the NST or fetal biophysical profile did not improve diagnostic accuracy. These data suggest that the NST should be used as a primary test for the antepartum detection of fetal acidosis, whereas the fetal biophysical profile is a reasonable adjunct test. The umbilical artery S/D, as determined by continuous-wave Doppler velocimetry, has no value as a primary method or an adjunct in the antepartum detection of fetal acidosis.\r"

Serum beta-hCG levels decreased in all patients, and the resolution time from injection to undetectable beta-hCG levels was 14-120 days. In spite of declining serum beta-hCG and unruptured tubal pregnancy, two patients subsequently requested definitive treatment for their ectopic pregnancies and underwent surgery. Four of six women found to have a living embryo in their gestational sacs required a repeat methotrexate injection; one of these also required a local potassium chloride injection. The tubal pregnancies resolved in nine patients treated with methotrexate alone. During resolution, we noted a gradually increasing resistance index of the blood flow in the region of the gestation, but the tube became distended to 4.4 +/- 0.4 cm before gradually decreasing in size. No complications or side effects were encountered. These findings suggest that intratubal transvaginal methotrexate administration can provide a safe alternative to surgical treatment for patients with early unruptured tubal ectopic pregnancy. However, the presence of a living embryo makes the ectopic pregnancy more resistant to methotrexate treatment.\r"

  ".U": "91163889\r", 
  ".W": "Primary peripheral arterial vasodilation with relative underfilling of the arterial circulation occurs in early pregnancy and leads to several consequences, including decreased systolic and diastolic blood pressures, enhanced cardiac output secondary to afterload reduction, stimulation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis, nonosmotic stimulation of thirst and vasopressin release, and renal sodium and water retention with expansion of the extracellular fluid and plasma volume compartments. These are events known to occur in all states of arterial vasodilation. Pregnancy has, however, several unique features. Primary arterial vasodilation generally is associated with no change or a decrease in renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate and failure to escape from the sodium-retaining effects of aldosterone. In early pregnancy, renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate increase by 30-50% in parallel with the peripheral arterial vasodilation but before plasma volume expansion. No known vasodilator exhibits such a profound effect on renal hemodynamics. Vasodilating prostaglandins may contribute to, but cannot explain, this remarkable enhancement of renal hemodynamics in early pregnancy. Therefore, a highly potent, as yet undefined, systemic and renal vasodilator must be unique to pregnancy. The increased glomerular filtration rate and filtered sodium load with enhanced distal tubular sodium delivery allows escape from aldosterone, an effect not observed in other states of arterial underfilling. This vasodilator may also account, at least in part, for the vascular resistance to angiotensin known to occur in normal pregnancy. This hypothesis for the normal physiology of pregnancy sets the stage for understanding the pathogenesis of preeclampsia-eclampsia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The most important lesson to be learned from the histopathology is that one should not accept a diagnosis of a benign cartilaginous tumor of the jaws. Treatment of these lesions should consist of wide surgical excision and consideration of adjunctive or palliative radiotherapy, especially in the maxilla. It should also be noted that recurrences may develop 10 to 20 years later, and follow-up should be lifelong.\r"

Results of this study showed that the average age for the initial eruption of third molars was 15 years in male subjects and 13 years for female subjects. The incidence of eruption showed a steep rise after the age of 16 years for male subjects and 14 years for female subjects. By the age of 19 years, all third molars had erupted into the oral cavity. The eruption of lower third molars was generally ahead of the upper third molars for all age groups. The results of this study suggest that (1) the timing of third molar eruption is strongly influenced by the availability of mandibular trigone space, (2) the attrition and shrinkage of the dental arch, probably as the result of nonrefined highly fibrous diets, produce larger mandibular trigone spaces, and (3) the early eruption of third molars observed in the present study may be due to the nature of the diet used and the vigorous employment of the masticatory apparatus (from infancy) by the subjects examined.\r"

Tumors stained uniformly for keratins and, on occasion, focally for vimentin. Tumors were nonreactive with antibodies to glial fibrillary acidic protein and, with few exceptions, to muscle-specific actins and S-100 protein. Clear cell and papillary histologic variants were seen as potential diagnostic pitfalls. If used with hematoxylin-and-eosin-stained sections, limited potential is seen for this antibody panel in surgical pathology. Myoepithelial cell-associated antigens are expressed to a very limited extent in MECs.\r"

Spindle cell carcinoma is an anaplastic dimorphic neoplasm with poor prognosis. It has a special predilection for the upper aerodigestive tract. This is to our knowledge the first report of spindle cell carcinoma developing in an odontogenic cyst. Cervical lymph node metastasis showing typical histologic features of spindle cell carcinoma was detected 8 months postoperatively.

Grossly and histologically, the surgical specimen consisted of a thin-walled, fluid-filled cyst lined by squamous epithelium that varied in appearance from benign to invasive squamous cell carcinoma. The findings supported a differential diagnosis of branchial cleft carcinoma (BCCA) versus cystic growth of a lymph node metastasis from an occult malignancy. On this basis, guided biopsies of the upper aerodigestive tract were performed, with strong suspicion of a tonsillar bed lesion. Microscopic examination revealed the primary tumor within tissue excised from the left tonsillar fossa. Comparison of the current case with cases of BCCA and cystic tonsillar metastases from the literature illustrated the potential pitfalls in rendering a diagnosis of BCCA. Recognition of this lesion as a distinctive clinical variant of oropharyngeal carcinoma is warranted.\r"

Precise movement from 0 to 25 mm of oscillation was accomplished in increments of 1 mm. Four test objects were imaged during x-, y-, and z-axis movement of the tube head. Pinhole camera and star test pattern images were used to measure focal spot size for each increment of motion. Images of a resolution plate and a section of dry mandible were used to evaluate levels of resolution objectively and subjectively for each increment of motion. Results indicate that the size of the effective focal spot increases predictably with increasing increments of tube motion accompanied by a corresponding loss of resolution. Movement of the tube along the x- and y-axis relative to the plane of the film produced similar losses of resolution and were much greater than loss associated with z-axis movement.\r"

Follow-up studies also indicated the potential of magnetic resonance imaging to demonstrate fluctuation of inflammatory changes in the TMJ.\r"

Understanding the interactions between the systemic health problems and disease trends of the elderly and their oral health has helped the dental profession gain greater insight into treatment strategies tailored to their needs. Evaluation of the patient's systemic health is critical to identifying complicating factors that can interfere with or be exacerbated by dental treatment. Understanding these disease trends can also sensitize the dentist to the presence of previously undiagnosed oral signs of systemic disease. In addition to the patient's systemic health, oral and dental status and individual expectations and desires must be considered when developing a treatment plan. In considering all of these variables, optimal treatment can be rendered to restore function and aesthetics in a manner that will help maintain and improve the patient's health and psychologic well-being.\r"

CVCs were in place for a total of 4233 days. CVCs were used for blood sampling, administration of blood products and infusions of intravenous immune globulin, parenteral nutrition and medications. Complications included catheter-related infections (8 episodes; with a rate of 1.9/1000 CVC days), occlusions (15 episodes) and unplanned catheter removals (9 episodes). Reduced CD4+ T cell counts were not predictive of CVC infection. The CVC infection rate in our pediatric acquired immunodeficiency syndrome patients was similar to rates reported in children with cancer and adults with cancer and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.\r"

The adhesion-negative phenotype may be due to the absence of the pap DNA sequences which encode these adhesins or to a phase variation event induced by in vitro culture. In the present study the frequency of pap and pil homologous DNA was determined by dot blot analysis with probes specific for the respective sequence using E. coli strains from children with recurrent pyelonephritis with and without renal scarring. The frequency of pap was 79% in the strains isolated from the nonscarring group compared with 39% in the strains from the scarring group (P less than 0.001). The Gal alpha 1-4Gal beta phenotype was expressed by 89% of the pap-positive strains from the nonscarring group compared with 71% in the scarring group (P less than 0.05). In addition 13 of 77 of the pap-positive E. coli strains agglutinated sheep erythrocytes but not the Gal alpha 1-4Gal beta latex beads; a reaction attributed to reactivity with the Forssman glycolipid. DNA sequences homologous with pil were found in 95% of all strains and there was no significant difference between the nonscarring and the scarring groups. The low frequency of Gal alpha 1-4Gal beta specific strains in the scarring group was therefore due to the absence of pap-homologous DNA sequences and to a reduced rate of phenotypic expression among pap-positive scarring strains. There was no support for a relationship between type 1 fimbriae and renal scarring.\r"

The contralateral ears were randomized to receive either myringotomy alone or no surgery. Clinical, otoscopic, tympanometric and audiologic examinations were performed before the study and 2 to 4 weeks later, then at 3-month intervals for up to 2 years and at 36 months after surgical randomization. Medical therapy and antibiotic prophylaxis were used whenever indicated. While the ventilating tubes remained functional (mean duration, 10 months) the ears with a tube had significantly fewer episodes of otitis media than their contralateral ear (P less than 0.001; 95% confidence intervals -0.7, -1.7) and had more hearing improvement (P = 0.005; 95% confidence intervals, -5.9, -1.2). After tube extrusion there was a tendency for surgically treated ears to have more otitis and worse hearing, but not at a significant level. Tympanosclerosis, retraction and atrophy were more common in ears that received tubes. The majority of ears treated medically also improved. There is need for a more cautious and selective use of ventilating tubes.\r"

Neutralization with specific antisera to Shiga-like toxins I and II (SLT-I, SLT-II) revealed that in 6 of these household contacts only SLT-I was present in stool, in 10 only SLT-II was present and in 9 both toxins were found. Thirty-three percent of the hemolytic uremic syndrome families in which 2 or more members were studied had more than 1 household member with free fecal toxin in stool. None of the household contacts was found to have E. coli 0157:H7 in feces. Serum samples were available in 77 household contacts; 75% (58 of 77) had serum neutralizing titers of greater than or equal to 1:4 to 1 or both toxins. In those contacts for whom paired sera were available, seroconversion was found in 10 of 24 (42%). These data show that household contacts of children with hemolytic uremic syndrome are commonly colonized with Shiga-like toxin-producing E. coli and seroconversion to Shiga-like toxins occurs frequently in family members of children with hemolytic uremic syndrome.\r"

A bacterial infection was identified in 57 (77%), a viral infection was seen in 25 (34%) and 18 (24%) had mixed viral-bacterial infections. The bacterial pathogens most frequently identified were Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae found in 61 and 15% of patients, respectively. The viral pathogen most frequently recovered was respiratory syncytial virus (12%). Evidence of Chlamydia pneumoniae strain TWAR and Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection was found in 12 and 4% of cases, respectively. Overall a potential pathogen was identified in 60 (81%) children, with evidence of polymicrobial infection in 30 cases (40.5%). The study provides information on the relative role of different infectious agents in the etiology of severe pneumonia in children in a developing country.\r"

Age-adjusted smoking prevalence rates were 23.2%, 22.6%, and 33.5% for Mexican-Americans, Cuban-Americans, and Puerto Ricans, respectively. Age-specific rates indicated that all Puerto Rican women under the age of 40, Mexican-American women in their 40's, and Cuban-American women in their 30's had smoking prevalences higher than the national average for women. Although most Hispanic women were relatively light smokers, prevention and cessation interventions need to be developed for Puerto Rican women of childbearing age who demonstrated high smoking prevalences.\r"

The findings of this study confirm that primary nursing does result in a higher quality of nursing care than team nursing and that nurse retention is improved in primary nursing. In addition, this study shows that, both directly and indirectly, primary nursing reduces costs when compared to team nursing.\r"

Thirty-four postoperative coronary artery bypass graft patients were randomly exposed to three lung hyperinflation breaths at one of five volumes (tidal volume, 12cc/kg, 14cc/kg, 16cc/kg, and 18cc/kg of lean body weight) using a ventilator followed by 10 s of suctioning repeated for a total of three times. There was a mean increase in MAP (13.71 torr), CO (12.2%), PAP (4 torr), and Paw (23.5 torr) above baseline over the three sequences. The mechanism for the increase in MAP with lung hyperinflation may be attributed to transient increases in intrathoracic pressure, resulting in increased left ventricular preload and CO.\r"

In addition, three methods to measure dyspnea intensity in children were tested and compared. Breathing on a \"bad breathing day\" was used as a proxy variable to represent dyspnea. The most frequent description of how breathing feels on a bad day was \"it is hard to breathe.\" Words chosen most frequently from a checklist of sensations were \"wheezy,\" \"short of breath,\" \"tight,\" and physical sensations such as \"throwing up,\" \"hurting,\" and \"stuffiness.\" The children's feelings on a bad breathing day were categorized as negative moods or emotions, a wish for change, or physical symptoms. Ratings of breathing on \"good\", \"bad,\" and \"usual breathing\" days on word descriptor, visual analogue, and color scales provided evidence of concurrent validity for the three measures of dyspnea intensity. The most frequent strategies used to cope with dyspnea were medications, change in position, decreased activity, fluids, relaxation, distraction, and social support. The findings were very similar to those previously described for an adult sample.\r"

K1, K4, and K5 measurements were taken 4 to 72 hours (M = 30) after admission when vital signs had stabilized. Data were collected using a random-zero (RZ) sphygmomanometer for indirect blood pressure and radial intraarterial cannula for direct blood pressure. The sequence of measurement was randomized and variables shown to alter blood pressure values were controlled. There was no overall significant difference in K1, K4, and K5 blood pressures among the three methods. These results suggest that when clinicians monitor variables such as the frequency response of arterial lines and peripheral vascular resistance, indirect blood pressure methods are reliable for use with stabilized trauma patients.\r"

Tympanic temperature was measured with an infrared thermometer and oral temperature with a predictive thermistor thermometer. Measurements at the two sites were similar in pattern and moderately well correlated. Tympanic temperature was somewhat more sensitive to the effects of an intervention influencing body temperature. The tympanic-oral temperature offset was relatively stable over time, with tympanic readings having a smaller range of values at each measurement. Tympanic temperature measurement variation was fairly small, with 92% of readings reproducible within 0.5 degree F (0.3 degree C); comparable oral data were not available. The findings suggest that the tympanic site offers some advantage, but that either tympanic or oral readings would be satisfactory for routine intermittent monitoring of body temperature during the perioperative period.\r"

Data were analyzed using autocorrelation, a form of time series analysis. A cyclic pattern of temperature was observed in three of the five subjects. The length of time of the cycles were two, three, and six hours. Incubator air temperature did not exhibit similar cyclicity, and it is therefore assumed that incubator operation is not responsible for the observed cyclic variation in infant temperature.\r"

These changes lead to increases in collagen and proliferation of fibrous tissue throughout the heart. Cardiac dysfunction following radiotherapy is surprisingly common and may be due to pericardial, myocardial, valvular, conduction system, or coronary artery disease. Greater awareness of cardiotoxicity has prompted changes in radiation techniques that appear to reduce clinical cardiovascular complications.\r"

  ".W": "IPVR is a rare clinical entity that was first diagnosed during life in 1955. In the past 35 years, only 69 patients have been reported. With increasing clinical awareness, as well as use of PDE, the confirmation of its clinical diagnosis has become easier and more accurate without having to take recourse to invasive cardiac studies as in the past. For this reason, it is becoming increasingly apparent that IPVR is not so rare as has been suggested in the past. IPVR is more common in men than in women, in whites than blacks, and in the young than the elderly. The mean age of IPVR patients is 27 years (range, 4 to 85). The majority of the patients are asymptomatic and the diagnosis is usually suspected upon the discovery of a crescendo-decrescendo, low-pitched, early to mid diastolic murmur in the second and third left intercostal space, which increases during inspiration, particularly in the presence of a hyperdynamic right ventricle and in the absence of peripheral circulatory phenomenon of aortic regurgitation. The ECG often shows right axis deviation, incomplete right bundle branch block, and rarely, right ventricular hypertrophy and strain. However, a normal ECG does not preclude its diagnosis. Approximately 30% of the IPVR patients have normal 12-lead ECGs. The diagnosis may be further suggested by the posteroanterior chest roentgenogram when dilated and large central pulmonary arteries are noted to pulsate vigorously (hilar dance) on chest fluoroscopy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Each neuron in the bag cell clusters synthesizes several peptides derived from a single prohormone and packages them into separate vesicles. These vesicles are then differentially localized in specific neuronal processes, thus segregating peptides destined for autocrine and hormonal release sites. Therefore in this system, protein trafficking through the secretory pathway organizes multiple peptide neurochemical messengers to efficiently regulate simple behaviors.\r"

However, with the use of magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography in humans, it has now been demonstrated that painful heat causes significant activation of the contralateral anterior cingulate, secondary somatosensory, and primary somatosensory cortices. This contrasts with the predominant activation of primary somatosensory cortex caused by vibrotactile stimuli in similar experiments. Furthermore, the unilateral cingulate activation indicates that this forebrain area, thought to regulate emotions, contains an unexpectedly specific representation of pain.\r"

These cells are arranged topographically in a motor map on which the vector (amplitude and direction) of the coded movement varies continuously with location. How this spatial representation becomes a temporal code (frequency and duration) in the motoneurons is unknown. During a gaze shift, a zone of neural activity moved continuously on the map from an initial location, defining the vector of the desired gaze shift, to a final \"zero\" position containing neurons that were active during fixation. Thus, the spatial-temporal transformation may be accomplished by control of gaze throughout the spatial trajectory of activity on the motor map.\r"

A purine-rich oligonucleotide bound in the major groove of double-helical DNA antiparallel to the Watson-Crick purine strand. Binding depended upon the concentration of multivalent cations such as spermine or Mg2+, and appeared to be relatively independent of pH. Two models with specific hydrogen-bonding patterns for base triplets (G.GC, A.AT, and T.AT) are proposed to explain the sequence specificity of binding. The two models differ in the conformation about the glycosyl bond (syn or anti) and the location of the phosphate-deoxyribose backbone in the major groove of DNA. This motif broadens the structural frameworks available as a basis for the design of sequence-specific DNA binding molecules.\r"

Long-term survival of vector-transduced human cells was demonstrated in recipient animals. Expression of vector-derived ADA restored immune functions, as indicated by the presence in reconstituted animals of human immunoglobulin and antigen-specific T cells. Retroviral vector gene transfer, therefore, is necessary and sufficient for development of specific immune functions in vivo and has therapeutic potential to correct this lethal immunodeficiency.\r"

The premorbid data included individual physical, psychosocial, and workplace factors. During slightly more than 4 years of follow-up, 279 subjects reported back problems. Other than a history of current or recent back problems, the factors found to be most predictive of subsequent reports in a multivariate model were work perceptions and certain psychosocial responses identified on the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI). Subjects who stated that they \"hardly ever\" enjoyed their job tasks were 2.5 times more likely to report a back injury (P = 0.0001) than subjects who \"almost always\" enjoyed their job tasks. The quintile of subjects scoring highest on Scale-3 (Hy) of the MMPI were 2.0 times more likely to report a back injury (P = 0.0001) than subjects with the lowest scores. The multivariate model, including job task enjoyment, MMPI Scale-3, and history of back treatment, revealed that subjects in the highest risk group had 3.3 times the number of reports in the lowest risk group. These findings emphasize the importance of adopting a broader approach to the multifaceted problem of back complaints in industry and help explain why past prevention efforts focusing on purely physical factors have been unsuccessful.\r"

The flexicurve technique had an intraobserver variability of 3-4 degrees of movement, was not significantly influenced by intrasubject variability, and provided measurements typically within 6 degrees of radiographic measurements. The data suggest that the flexicurve technique is less biased than the inclinometric method.

The presence of nerves was studied with silver impregnation, immunofluorescence, and avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex (ABC) immunostaining. Heterologous antisera to protein gene product (PGP) 9.5, substance P, calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), and galanin were used to stain nerves. After silver impregnation, nerve-like structures were observed perivascularly. Such nerves located close to blood vessels were also immunoreactive for PGP 9.5, a more general cytoplasmic neural marker, whereas only few perivascular small varicosities were seen with antisera to substance P and galanin and none with antiserum to CGRP. In addition, PGP-9.5-, substance-P-, and galanin-immunoreactive nerves were occasionally seen very near to fat globules. Very few peptide-immunoreactive nerve varicosities were seen with immunofluorescence, and none of the PGP-9.5-immunoreactive nerves that were observed with ABC immunostaining were immunoreactive for neuropeptides as well. One mechanism for pain production could be mechanical compression of fatty tissue, but it is considered more likely that nerves in this particular tissue are mainly involved in local vasoregulation and that they are not sensory nociceptive nerves.\r"

After the intrathecal (subarachnoid) application of 0.2 ml of either the diluent in the control group (N = 2) or chondroitinase in the study group (N = 4), no neurologic deficit was detected. Compared with the control group, no morphologic changes at the light microscopic level were induced in the spinal cord by chondroitinase. No neurophysiologic differences were detected between tibial nerves after exposure to 1 ml of the diluent (control, N = 8) or chondroitinase (the other leg) for 4 weeks, nor did the study group, compared with the control group, show any morphologic changes in the tibial nerves. Because the concentration of chondroitinase ABC tested was approximately 40 times higher than might be used clinically for chemonucleolysis, the present study indicates a wide margin of safety for unwanted side effects on nerve tissue.\r"

Six typical configurations of the vascular anatomy could be classified to explain the type of vascular complications occurring at the L3-4 and L4-L5 disc levels. The sagittal diameter of the three lowest lumbar discs varied from 33 to 56 mm, indicating the importance of this parameter as an intraoperative guideline for the spine surgeon.

  ".W": "Nerve root compression has been suggested as one important pathogenetic factor in low-back pain syndromes and sciatica. The underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms are, however, incompletely known, partly because of the lack of experimental data on this topic. In the present study, a model for experimental compression of the porcine sacrococcygeal cauda equina is presented. The model consists of surgical exposure of the cauda equina and compression of the cauda equina toward the ventral aspect of the spinal canal by an inflatable balloon fixed to the spine. This compression system was shown to have a high accuracy in pressure transmission from the balloon to the cauda equina. The gross and microscopic neural anatomy and the vascular anatomy of the porcine cauda equina were analyzed with light microscopic and ink-perfusion techniques. The porcine cauda equina showed a close anatomic resemblance to the human lumbosacral cauda equina. The presented model offers unique possibilities for experimental studies on nerve root compression injury because of the easy surgical exposure and the sufficient length of the nerve roots. In separate studies, this model, along with investigations of solute transport to the nerve tissue and of impulse propagation, has been used to analyze the effects of acute, graded compression on blood flow and edema formation in the cauda equina. The porcine cauda equina would also be particularly suitable for chronic compression studies because any neurologic deficit acquired would be restricted to the tail.\r"

  ".W": "The inability to predict outcome in patients with low-back pain seriously impedes clinical trials and leads to inappropriate or unnecessary treatment. This prospective study investigated the value of multivariable mathematical models to predict the 1-year clinical course of 109 patients with low-back trouble (LBT). Discriminant analysis was used to determine predictive models for outcome groups at 1 month, 3 months and 1 year. The variables selected in the analyses were subsets of 29 items from a clinical interview at presentation. These included anamnestic features of the first episode as well as symptomatic details and results from clinical tests for the current spell. The derived models successfully discriminated outcome groups with estimates of sensitivity and specificity ranging from 63 to 99%. When models from one set of patients were tested for predictive accuracy by the application of them to a different set, nonrecovery and satisfactory improvement were predicted with a 76-100% success rate. The results affirmed the importance of considering combinations of interrelated variables for prediction and discrimination in LBT. This work has demonstrated that outcome can be predicted successfully by the use of mathematic models based just on presentation data. The ability to determine homogenous groups in respect to outcome is seen as an important aid to therapeutic research; further work will enable refinement of these models for general clinical use and for incorporation into computer-based interview systems.\r"

The mean follow-up was 3.1 years. Most patients with incomplete neurologic lesions showed postoperative improvement and were upgraded one or two steps in the Frankel scale. No patient showed neurologic deterioration after surgery. In all patients, bony union occurred. Loss of reduction of more than 5 degrees occurred in 41% of the patients. Because of this high rate of loss of reduction in patients and the low degree of flexion-bending loading and torsional stability in biomechanical evaluation in vitro of the Slot-Zielke device on human cadaveric spines, an additional posterior stabilization of the spine after an anterior approach for anterior- and middle-column fractures should be considered.\r"

Functioning, mood disturbances, and overall quality of life were recorded with established self-assessment instruments. Physical dysfunction levels were moderate, being proportionate to neurologic impairment. Psychosocial functions, mood states, and quality-of-life perceptions did not differ from those of a control population sample. Psychosocial function and mood disturbances varied greatly during the first 4 years after injury, but patients' later recordings expressed predominantly a balanced emotional state and a rewarding social life. Progress in this direction consisted of clearly lessened physical dysfunction 1 year after injury and better psychosocial function and well-being after 2 years, whereas patterns of social activities and contacts became gradually less inhibited during a 4-year period after injury. Analysis of complications in patients' histories that affected function and mood showed severe pain to be the only complication that related to lower quality-of-life scores. Urinary incontinence and infection and autonomous dysreflexia related to inhibited self-care performance; spasticity related to impaired ambulation and feeding skills. Gainful employment was the only demographic factor linked to high quality-of-life scores.\r"

  ".W": "This report investigates dimensions of hand and foot preference in 159 girls with idiopathic scoliosis diagnosed after the age of 8 years, 1,522 girls with clinically straight spines, and 132 with minor truncal asymmetry. It was found that, although there was no significant difference in hand or foot preference for individual items between scoliotic groups and controls, there was a statistically significant tendency for children with any degree of asymmetry to show uniform lateralization in the sense of consistency of side preference. Another, smaller group showed a tendency for scoliosis to be associated with clearly visible facial asymmetry, which itself correlated with handedness. It was concluded that theories of scoliosis need to include the frequently ignored minor observations, such as the well-known fact of lateralization of the curve, if they are to describe the condition completely. Because the asymmetry of cerebral lateralization is known to be genetically determined and because it is thought to result in other skeletal asymmetries, such as skull and limb inequality, it seemed reasonable to investigate the primary cause of that gross asymmetry, idiopathic scoliosis.\r"

  ".W": "All 813 patients with idiopathic scoliosis who completed their first Schroth physiotherapeutic rehabilitation program at the Katharina Schroth Hospital between 1984 and 1987 were reviewed. The patients were divided into four age groups. In Group I (10-13 years, N = 278), vital capacity in patients treated for the first time improved by 18.94% (445 ml). In Group II (14-17 years, N = 264), the average increase in vital capacity after initial treatment was 16.33% (497 ml). In Groups III (18-24 years, N = 123) and IV (greater than 24 years, N = 148), the corresponding increases were 15.11% (501) and 13.77% (394 ml), respectively. In the 256 patients receiving repeat treatment, the increases in vital capacity in the respective age groups amounted to just more than half those in the patients treated for the first time. The average increase in chest expansion was more than 20% in all groups at all measuring points. These findings show that a course of inpatient treatment by the Schroth method can lead to an increase in vital capacity and chest expansion so that, even in adult scoliosis patients, effective treatment of the associated restrictive ventilatory disorder is possible.\r"

Animals with less severe deformities had little measurable restriction of pulmonary function, did not develop respiratory failure, and grew normally.\r"

Depending on a center's geographic location and patient mix between penetrating and blunt trauma, participation in a system may be a liability or an asset. In general, inner-city hospitals tend to see more indigent patients and to have sizeable financial losses. At the same time, they provide an invaluable service to any community, and their ability to do so must be preserved. The two important issues of malpractice and uncompensated care threaten to destroy the very concept of trauma care and therefore pose a serious threat to the health care profession. Solutions are possible, but it will take a significant public awareness and education campaign to elicit the support and initiate the programs that will ensure that every injured patient has an opportunity to receive the best of trauma care. Inner-city hospitals are both a financial burden and a community savior.\r"

Wound ballistics is a special case of terminal ballistics. Although wound ballistics is at best sets of approximations, its principles enter usefully into an evaluation of a gunshot wound and its treatment. A special consideration in these cases is their medicolegal aspects. At a minimum, the medical team receiving the patient should exert care not to destroy the clothing and in particular to cut around and not through bullet holes, to turn over to law enforcement officials any metallic foreign body recovered from the patient, and to describe precisely, or even to photograph, any entrance or exit wounds.\r"

For practical purposes, diagnostic peritoneal lavage and CT scanning are the diagnostic studies most commonly used in patients without obvious indications for celiotomy after blunt or penetrating abdominal trauma. Diagnostic peritoneal lavage is invasive, rapidly performed, cheap, and accurate and has a primary role in documenting intra-abdominal bleeding or contamination in hypotensive patients with blunt trauma or selected stable patients with penetrating stab wounds. It misses small and large injuries to the diaphragm and cannot rule out injury to retroperitoneal structures. Computed tomography is noninvasive, time consuming to perform, expensive, and accurate and has a primary role in defining the location and magnitude of intra-abdominal injuries in stable patients with blunt trauma or with penetrating trauma to the flank or back. In many hospitals, it misses gastrointestinal perforations or ruptures. Both studies may be needed in the same stable patient, and both should be available and used in a complementary fashion in the modern trauma center.\r"

The best we can hope for probably is controlled chaos. We do believe that we have generated an improved plan, that the plan is known, and that it is being revised continuously. We can no longer rely on our goodwill and good intentions to manage mass casualties in a disaster. There are too many factors that can reduce our ability to provide medical care in this situation. Hospital planning is essential. The hospital should be represented on the emergency preparedness committee so it is knowledgeable about the various plans throughout the city. Each plan must be practiced and critiqued to identify potential problems. Hospital staff must be kept current on the various plans to understand the communication, authority, responsibility, security, and medical control for each plan. We have instituted a video program outlining the various tasks for each hospital department for each disaster plan. This format allows the personnel in these departments to review their responsibilities continually in a concise manner and allows practice of disaster preparedness without implementing an entire disaster drill. Table 1 provides a quick review of the areas and questions we found to be problems when implementing our disaster plan.\r"
