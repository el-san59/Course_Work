  ".W": "1. We measured urinary excretion rates of dopamine (3,4-dihydroxyphenethylamine) and dopa (3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine) and the spillover rate of dopa into arterial blood during dietary salt loading in conscious Dahl salt-sensitive and salt-resistant rats with intact or denervated kidneys. 2. Dopa spillover was calculated from the steady-state clearance of intravenously infused L-[3H]dopa and arterial levels of endogenous dopa. 3. Daily excretion rates of dopa and dopamine increased by about sixfold during salt loading in both rat strains. Bilateral renal denervation delayed these increases and the natriuretic responses. 4. During dietary salt loading, dopa spillover increased to approximately the same extent as simultaneously measured dopamine excretion. 5. The results suggest that increases in urinary excretion of dopamine during dietary salt loading can be accounted for by increases in the release of dopa into the bloodstream and that the renal nerves contribute to the dopa and dopamine excretory responses.\r"

Eleven carotid body-intact (CBI) and six chronic carotid body-denervated (CBD) ponies were studied during normoxia (fractional inspired O2 concn [FIO2] = 0.21) and two levels of hypoxia (FIO2 approximately 0.15 and 0.12; 6-10 min/period). Four CBI and five CBD ponies were also hilar nerve (pulmonary vagal) denervated. Mean VE responses to hypoxia were greater in CBI ponies (delta arterial PCO2 = -4 and -7 Torr in CBI during hypoxic periods; -1 and -2 Torr in CBD). Hypoxia increased the rate of rise and mean activity of integrated diaphragm EMG in CBI (P less than 0.05) and CBD (P greater than 0.05) ponies relative to normoxia. Duration of diaphragm activity was reduced in CBI (P less than 0.05) but unchanged in CBD ponies. During hypoxia in both groups of ponies, total and mean activities per breath of transversus abdominis were reduced (P less than 0.05) without a decrease in rate of rise in activity. Time to peak and total duration of transversus abdominis activity were markedly reduced by hypoxia in CBI and CBD ponies (P less than 0.05). Hilar nerve denervation did not alter the EMG responses to hypoxia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To compare the respiratory muscle responses to changes in CO2, 10 ventilator-dependent preterm infants (gestational age 28 +/- 1 wk, postnatal age 40 +/- 6 days, weight 1.4 +/- 0.1 kg) were passively hyperventilated to apnea and subsequently hypoventilated. Electromyograms from the genioglossus, alae nasi, posterior cricoarytenoid, and diaphragm were recorded from surface electrodes. Apneic CO2 thresholds of all upper airway muscles (genioglossus 46.8 +/- 4.3 Torr, alae nasi 42.4 +/- 3.6 Torr, posterior cricoarytenoid 41.6 +/- 3.2 Torr) were higher than those of the diaphragm (38.8 +/- 2.6 Torr, all P less than 0.05). Above their CO2 threshold levels, responses of all upper airway muscles appeared proportional to those of the diaphragm. We conclude that nonproportional responses of the respiratory muscles to hypercapnia may be the result of differences in their CO2 threshold. These differences in CO2 threshold may cause imbalance in respiratory muscle activation with changes in chemical drive, leading to upper airway instability and obstructive apnea.\r"

In these experiments, a spectrophotometric method of determining pHi was developed, and the method was then used to study muscle pHi regulation during CO2-induced changes in extracellular pH (pHb). Studies were performed in vitro on 27 diaphragm muscle strips obtained from adult hamsters. pHi was measured from the ratio of the absorbances of the acid (lambda = 530 nm) and alkaline (lambda = 460 nm) forms of a vital dye, neutral red, using the unstained diaphragm spectrum as a reference blank. A standard neutral red calibration curve constructed from eight diaphragm muscle homogenates indicated that the absorbance ratio was highly linear, with pH over the range 6.00-8.00. In intact muscle strips gassed with 95% O2-5% CO2, pHb was 7.45 +/- 0.03 (SE) and pHi was 7.00 +/- 0.01 (SE). When the muscle was aerated with CO2 concentrations from 3 to 30%, pHb and pHi changed rapidly and reached a steady state in 10-15 min. However, when pHb ranged from 6.80-7.80, pHi changed little from the value observed when pHb was 7.40. When pHb was less than 6.80 or greater than 7.80, changes in pHi and pHb were quantitatively similar. The results suggest that, in the isolated diaphragm, overall pHi is stable and effectively buffered over a wide range of CO2-induced changes in buffer solution pH.\r"

A two-channel roller pump and a four-way valve allowed switching the gas exchanger into and out of the extracorporeal circuit which controlled the brain stem perfusion. When isocapnic hypoxia (arterial PO2 range 18-59 Torr) was limited to the brain stem, a decline in ventilation was consistently found. In 12 cats 47 steps into and 48 steps out of central hypoxia were made. The ventilatory response was fitted using least squares with a model that consisted of a latency followed by a single-exponential function. The latencies for the steps into and out of hypoxia were not significantly different (P = 0.14) and were 32.3 +/- 4.0 and 25.1 +/- 3.6 (SE) s, respectively. The time constant for the steps into hypoxia (149.7 +/- 8.5 s) was significantly longer (P = 0.0002) than for the steps out of hypoxia (105.5 +/- 10.1 s). The time constants for the increase and decrease in ventilation after step changes in the central arterial PCO2 found in a previous study (J. Appl. Physiol. 66: 2168-2172, 1989) were not significantly different (P greater than 0.2) from the corresponding time constants in this study (for 7 cats common to both studies). Theories of the mechanisms behind hypoxic ventilatory decline need to account for the long latency, the similarity between the time constants for the ventilatory response to O2 and CO2, and the differences between the time constants for increasing and decreasing ventilation.\r"

Using a wedged bronchoscope technique, we measured collateral system resistance (Rcs) before and after challenges with aerosolized Na2EDTA. An isotonic solution (4% Na2EDTA, 0.28 osmol/kg) increased Rcs 91 +/- 21%. Na2EDTA increased Rcs in a dose-dependent fashion after challenges of increasing concentration (0, 1, 3, and 6%) or duration (15, 30, 60, and 90 s) with 6% Na2EDTA. Atropine (1 mg/kg iv) significantly (P = 0.01) attenuated the response to an aerosol challenge with distilled H2O. Atropine did not significantly (P = 0.35) alter the response to a challenge with 4% Na2EDTA. Challenge with 6% Na2EDTA (0.42 osmol/kg) increased Rcs to a significantly greater (P less than 0.01) extent than did challenge with 6% CaNa2EDTA (0.37 osmol/kg, 250 +/- 55 vs. 29 +/- 11%, respectively). We conclude that Na2EDTA induces bronchoconstriction in the canine lung periphery in a dose-dependent fashion. As suggested by the Na2EDTA-CaNa2EDTA comparison, hyperosmolality of the solution alone cannot explain this phenomenon. The mechanism does not depend on muscarinic activity and appears to involve chelation of calcium.\r"

In this study using the same preparation, bilateral 50- to 100-nl kainate injections just below the RVLM surface better localized these responses topographically. The physiological responses to unilateral 10-nl kainate injections were then correlated with anatomic location determined by fluorescent microbeads (0.5 micron diam). Many sites were associated with no effect, a few rostral and caudal sites with increased phrenic activity, and cluster of sites with decreased phrenic activity often to apnea, decreased CO2 sensitivity, and decreased responses to carotid sinus nerve stimulation. Blood pressure was unaffected. These sites, within 400 microns of the surface, were ventral to the facial nucleus, ventrolateral to the nucleus paragigantocellularis lateralis, caudal to the superior olive, and rostral to the retrofacial nucleus. They appeared to be within the recently described retrotrapezoid nucleus, which contains cells with respiratory-related activity and projections to the dorsal and ventral respiratory groups. Cells within this site appear able to provide tonic input to respiration and to affect peripheral and central chemoreception.\r"

At altitude, whole blood P50,vv remained almost unchanged, whereas P50,st and 2,3-DPG increased significantly (+4 Torr; 3.5 mumol/g hemoglobin). BCCO2 was elevated significantly at altitude. Serum erythropoietin increased transiently fourfold, iron utilization increased, and serum iron decreased by 66%. Reticulocyte counts increased, but other hematological parameters were unchanged. In density-separated erythrocytes, P50,st and 2,3-DPG increased with decreasing cell density but were higher in fractions with comparable reticulocyte counts in cells prepared at altitude than in those from control studies. Our data show that, despite the increase in 2,3-DPG and the decrease in average erythrocyte age, the in vivo hemoglobin-O2 affinity remains unchanged. P50,st values reflect the elevation of 2,3-DPG, and approximately 50% of the increase in both parameters can be ascribed to the increase in the number of reticulocytes and young erythrocytes.\r"

MCC was used as an indicator of elevated [Ca2+] in the muscles, and injury was estimated from histochemical analysis of muscle cross sections by determining the numbers of intact fibers per unit area in the muscles. Elevations in MCC in the soleus and vastus intermedius muscles over time postexercise were inversely related (P less than 0.05) to the number of intact fibers per square millimeter in the respective muscles after downhill walking. Verapamil administration attenuated the elevation in MCC and injury in histochemical sections resulting from the downhill walking in soleus muscle, but intraperitoneal injection of the chelators EDTA or ethylene glycol-bis(beta-aminoethylether)-N,N,N',N'- tetraacetic acid significantly attenuated the increases in MCC and injury to both the vastus intermedius and soleus muscles in the downhill walkers. The chelators appear to exert their \"protective\" effects within the specific muscles that show the injury and do not significantly affect serum [Ca2+]. It is concluded that increases in MCC occur during exercise-induced fiber injury and that elevations in cellular Ca2+ may have a role in the etiology of the injury process.\r"

  ".W": "The afferent arm of the reflex are responsible for the pressor response to static contraction is comprised of group III and IV fibers. The nature of the contraction-induced stimulus activating these fibers remains unclear. Evidence suggests that most group III afferents are sensitive to mechanical stimuli, whereas most group IV afferents are sensitive to metabolic stimuli. Recently, in anesthetized cats, stimulation of group III mechanoreceptors has been shown to have a role in the reflex pressor response to static contraction. In skin, the sensitivity of thin fiber mechanoreceptors to distortion of their receptive fields has been shown to be increased by both cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase products of arachidonic acid metabolism. Therefore, in barbiturate-anesthetized cats we recorded the responses of group III muscle afferents to static contraction before and after arachidonic acid (1-2 mg ia) and/or indomethacin (5 mg/kg iv). Arachidonic acid increased the responses of group III afferents (n = 11) to contraction by 265% (from 0.17 +/- 0.07 to 0.62 +/- 0.24 impulses/s; P less than 0.025). Indomethacin decreased the responses of group III afferents (n = 9) to contraction by 61% (from 1.00 +/- 0.37 to 0.39 +/- 0.16 impulses/s; P less than 0.025). Arachidonic acid given after indomethacin increased the responses of two of four group III afferents to contraction. We conclude that both cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase products of arachidonic acid metabolism sensitize group III muscle afferents to static contraction.\r"

  ".U": "90256671\r", 
  ".W": "In adult humans the ventilatory response to sustained hypoxia is biphasic, characterized by an early increase followed by a decline to an intermediate plateau. Recently, we have shown that this decrease in hypoxic sensitivity is long lasting, because up to 1 h of room air breathing is required for complete recovery of the initial hypoxic response (J. Appl. Physiol. 64: 521-528, 1988). It is not known whether this posthypoxia decrease in ventilatory response is general or specific only to hypoxic stimuli. We therefore examined responses to CO2 before and after hypoxia. The ventilatory response to 5 min of normoxic CO2 breathing was evaluated in eight normal adults on 2 days: 5 min before and after 25 min of normocapnic hypoxia (arterial O2 saturation +/- 80%) and 5 min before and after 25 min of room air breathing (control day). During hypoxia, ventilation (VI), after an initial increase, declined significantly. At the end of hypoxia, abrupt exposure to room air transiently dropped VI to values that were significantly below base line. On each experimental day, the first and second exposure to CO2 increased ventilation by a similar amount, averaging, respectively, 8.46 +/- 0.9 and 8.84 +/- 0.92 (SE) l/min on the hypoxic day and 8.24 +/- 0.96 and 7.65 +/- 0.94 l/min on the control day. All the hypercapnic increases of VI were accomplished through similar changes of breathing pattern with similar time courses. We conclude that sustained hypoxia does not affect the ventilatory response to CO2, but it selectively depresses hypoxic sensitivity.\r"

Training increased cycle ergometer peak VO2 by 23% and decreased the respiratory exchange ratio during the final 30 min of exercise from 0.89 +/- 0.01 to 0.85 +/- 0.01 (SE) (P less than 0.001). Plasma glucose turnover during exercise decreased from 44.6 +/- 3.5 mumol.kg fat-free mass (FFM)-1.min-1 before training to 31.5 +/- 4.3 after training (P less than 0.001), whereas plasma glucose clearance (i.e., rate of disappearance/plasma glucose concentration) fell from 9.5 +/- 0.6 to 6.4 +/- 0.8 ml.kg FFM-1.min-1 (P less than 0.001). Oxidation of plasma-derived glucose, which accounted for approximately 90% of plasma glucose disappearance in both the untrained and trained states, decreased from 41.1 +/- 3.4 mumol.kg FFM-1.min-1 before training to 27.7 +/- 4.8 after training (P less than 0.001). This decrease could account for roughly one-half of the total reduction in the amount of carbohydrate utilized during the final 30 min of exercise in the trained compared with the untrained state.\r"

The incidence and type of complications in the two groups were nearly equal; indomethacin-treated patients had no increase in complications related to bleeding. Postoperative bleeding into drains was marginally greater in the indomethacin group, although the difference was not statistically significant.

Monoclonal antibody II 7C2 also stained the cytoplasm or nucleus, or both, of a varied number of hepatocytes from nine patients with chronic hepatitis B virus infection, suggesting that the antigenic epitope related to hepatitis B core antigen (HBcAg) crossreacted with II7C2. The other two monoclonal antibodies, III2F3 and IV3E5, stained significantly larger numbers of mononuclear cells in cases of chronic active hepatitis B than in chronic persistent hepatitis B, or hepatitis B related liver cirrhosis. III2F3 stained significantly larger numbers of mononuclear cells in non-A, non-B chronic active hepatitis than in chronic persistent hepatitis B or hepatitis B related liver cirrhosis. These results indicate that TNF alpha is produced and secreted by infiltrating mononuclear cells in focal inflammatory areas of the liver, and suggest that TNF alpha may have a role in the inflammatory activity of chronic liver disease.\r"

By using highly purified cell populations, we demonstrate that the only cell population in resting spleen capable of causing this inhibition is NK1.1+. Although resting CD8 cells lack inhibitory activity, purified CD8 cells precultured with Con A and IL-2 inhibit anti-Qa-1 CTL. This inhibition is specific for the Qa-1b Ag expressed on the inhibitor cells, is not due to cold target competition, and is thus similar to that ascribed to veto cells. Although NK cells from resting spleen inhibit the generation of Qa-1-specific CTL, NK cells precultured in the presence of Con A and IL-2 show an approximate 30-fold increase in veto activity.

The selective inhibitory effect on TH1 clones suggested that the two helper T lymphocyte subsets might utilize different TCR-associated signal transduction mechanisms. In the present study, we demonstrate that this distinction was not due to a gross difference in the level of TCR expression by TH1 and TH2 clones. Inhibition of TH1 proliferation by anti-CD3 mAb appeared to depend on calcium for maximal effect, suggesting that a substantial elevation of intracellular free calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) might not occur after ligation of the TCR complex of TH2 clones. Calcium ionophore inhibited IL-2-dependent proliferation of both subsets, suggesting that receptor/ligand systems which stimulate elevated [Ca2+]i would be expected to inhibit proliferation. Although elevated [Ca2+]i and generation of inositol phosphates were readily detected in TH1 clones, these second messengers were not detected following stimulation of TH2 clones via the TCR complex. In addition, lymphokine production by TH1 clones was more sensitive to inhibition by cholera toxin, 8-bromoadenosine 3':5'-cyclic monophosphate, and cyclosporin A than was lymphokine production by TH2 clones. Collectively, these results suggest that TH1 and TH2 clones utilize distinct TCR-associated signal transduction mechanisms for lymphokine gene expression. The difference in signaling mechanisms suggests a potential pharmacologic target for intervention in situations where inappropriate activation of TH1 or TH2 cells occurs in vivo.\r"

In vivo depletions of these T cell phenotypes revealed that delayed-type hypersensitivity to cellular and protein Ag were mediated by CD4+ effector cells, whereas CD8+ cells down-regulated such responses. Similar depletions in mice prior to sensitization with the hapten 1-fluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene demonstrated a more complex pattern of cell participation in contact sensitivity (CS) responses. Depletion of CD4+ cells resulted in strikingly enhanced ear swelling, indicating not only an important effector role for CD8+ cells but also a down-regulatory role for some CD4+ cells; depletion of CD8+ cells revealed that some CD4+ cells also act as CS effectors. In vitro depletion of immune lymph node cells with the same mAb before adoptive transfer confirmed CS effector roles for both subsets, and also suggested that at least some CD4+ suppressors act on the efferent limb of the CS response, perhaps by down-regulating the activity of CD8+ effector cells. Partial in vivo depletion with small amounts anti-CD4 mAb and subsequent flow cytometric analysis of residual CD4+ cells was consistent with the hypothesis that CD4+ CS effector cells express a higher density of the CD4 antigen than do CD4+ suppressor cells, raising the possibility that these two functionally distinct CD4+ populations might be separable on the basis of their surface expression of CD4.\r"

Two of these clones secreted N alpha-benzyloxycarbonyl-L-lysine thiobenzyl ester serine esterase activity after stimulation with JY cells. The cytotoxic activity of these two clones was blocked by a mAb specific for HLA-A2. Moreover, these two TCR-gamma delta+ clones selectively lysed human fibroblast line M1 and murine P815 cells transfected with DNA fragments encoding HLA-A2 but not those transfected with HLA-B7 encoding DNA, indicating that these clones recognize HLA-A2. Analysis of the recognition of HLA-A2 by using target cells transfected with mutated HLA-A2 encoding genes revealed that the nature of the amino acid at position 152 of the molecule is critical for recognition of the TCR-alpha beta+ as well as the TCR-gamma delta+ CTL clones since replacement of Val for Ala at that position resulted in abrogation of recognition of one TCR-gamma delta+ and one TCR-alpha beta+ clone and substitution of Val for Glu affected recognition of all clones. Substitution of Leu for Trp at position 156 abrogated recognition by one TCR-gamma delta+ and one TCR-alpha beta+ T cell clone, but recognition by the other clones was not changed.

Fixation in Mota's basic lead acetate allowed detection of all mast cells. However, after formalin fixation only 10.8 +/- 1.3%, range 4.7 to 17%, n = 8 remained detectable (i.e., formalin \"resistant\"). Therefore, the vast majority of human lung mast cells lose their metachromatic staining after formalin fixation (i.e., are formalin \"sensitive\"). Mast cells were then separated on the basis of diameter by countercurrent elutriation and on the basis of density by discontinuous Percoll gradients. Histochemically distinct populations of mast cell types emerged in all lungs studied. The proportion of formalin-resistant mast cells increased as a function of diameter: less than 5% at diameters of less than or equal to 11 mu and densities less than or equal to 1.063 g/ml, to 30 to 40% in cells of diameters greater than or equal to 16 mu and densities greater than or equal to 1.100 g/ml. Maximum anti-IgE challenge of nearly homogeneous formalin-sensitive mast cells (94.3 +/- 2.1% purity, n = 6) caused the generation of both leukotriene C4 (64.6 +/- 26.4 pg/mast cell) and PGD2 (114.8 +/- 37.5 pg/mast cell). Six- to eight-fold enrichment of formalin-resistant mast cells did not significantly alter the histamine release response or profiles of arachidonate metabolites. Similar results were obtained for the nonimmunologic stimulus ionophore A23187. We conclude that two histochemically distinct subpopulations, of mast cells are present in human lung suspensions. Although formalin-sensitive cells account for almost 90% of lung mast cells, formalin-resistant cells are separable by their large diameters and higher densities. Both subtypes show similar histamine release responses and arachidonate oxidation profiles.\r"

Given these multiple activities, it was proposed that the protein be renamed IL-9. The analysis of P40 genomic clones reported here shows that the human and mouse P40 genes consist of 5 exons spread over approximately 4 kb of DNA and organized in a similar fashion in both species. The two genes exhibit a high degree of identity in the coding sequence and in the 5' untranslated regions, which contain, among other consensus motifs, a conserved sequence for the binding of AP-1. Expression of human P40 was studied in PBMC. Treatment of the cells with PMA and a calcium ionophore induced strong expression of a 0.7-kb P40 mRNA. No message was detected in unstimulated cells or in cells stimulated with LPS or Staphylococcus aureus, indicating that P40 expression is not constitutive and suggesting that the gene is not easily activated in B lymphocytes and in monocytes. By contrast, T cell mitogens such as PHA or anti-CD3 antibodies induced a substantial P40 expression that was further enhanced in the presence of PMA. Cell fractionation experiments indicated that, under these conditions, the protein is preferentially induced in CD4+ T cells. The induction of P40 by anti-CD3 antibodies suggests that P40 production is part of the normal T cell response to antigenic stimulation.\r"

The cells released a large quantity of labeled compounds into the extracellular medium. When the cells were preincubated for 10 min with PMA at concentrations from 10 to 1000 ng/ml, zymosan- and Con A-stimulated compound release was greatly enhanced. PMA also potentiated arachidonic acid release when cells were stimulated with the calcium ionophore A23187. However, under the same conditions, PMA treatment blocked agonist- and ionophore-mediated phosphoinositide hydrolysis in cells prelabeled with [3H]inositol. Thus, PMA treatment appears to have dissociated agonist-induced arachidonic acid liberation (index of phospholipase A2) from phosphoinositide hydrolysis (index of phospholipase C), suggesting that these two coupling processes can occur in a parallel and independent manner in mouse peritoneal macrophages. Furthermore, the ligand-induced arachidonic acid release from PMA-treated macrophages was shown to be directly dependent on the extracellular calcium concentration. Considering that in PMA-pretreated cells, receptor-mediated phosphoinositide breakdown and intracellular calcium mobilization were abolished, our data suggest that the extracellular calcium influx that takes place after receptor-ligand interaction may be a required event for arachidonic acid mobilization in mouse peritoneal macrophages.\r"

IFN-gamma has been reported to increase the intracellular concentration of calcium ([Ca2+]i) and modulate protein kinase C activity in murine macrophages, but the signal transduction pathways induced by IFN-gamma in human cells and their functional significance are poorly understood. Our study examined the hypothesis that an increases in [Ca2+]i and protein kinase C activation are required for functional responses to IFN-gamma. The U937 cell line was used as a model of an IFN-gamma responsive cell. IFN-gamma caused a rapid and concentration-dependent increase in [Ca2+]i, which was partly inhibited by calcium-free medium, diltiazem, and TMB-8. IFN-gamma induced a fourfold increase in the concentration of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate. Induction of HLA-DR, Fc gamma R, CR3, and Mo3e Ag expression by IFN-gamma was blocked by concentrations of TMB-8 that inhibited an increase in [Ca2+]i, but not by protein kinase C inhibition by H-7 or inhibition of calmodulin with W-7. Ionomycin did not enhance Ag expression and PMA induced the expression of only the Mo3e Ag. We conclude that IFN-gamma induces antigenic expression on human U937 cells by a mechanism dependent on, but not limited to, an increase in intracellular calcium, which is likely due to inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate generation.\r"

  ".W": "Alveolar macrophages (AM) differ from other macrophage (m phi) populations in their profile of eicosanoids synthesized from arachidonic acid (AA)3. Little information is available regarding possible differences in the regulation of AA metabolism among various m phi populations. In our study, we compared the ability of cultured resident rat AM and peritoneal m phi (PM) to release and metabolize AA in response to exogenous activators of protein kinase C (PKC). When stimulated with PMA, prelabeled PM released free [3H]AA in a dose-dependent manner over the concentration range 1 to 100 nM. As assessed by HPLC, PMA-stimulated PM metabolized AA to a variety of predominantly cyclooxygenase products. The dose-dependent synthesis of PGE2 by unlabeled PM stimulated with PMA was confirmed using RIA. The ability of PMA to trigger AA release and metabolism in PM was a function of its capacity to activate PKC, as indicated by the following: 1) an additional activator of PKC, oleoyl acetylglycerol, also triggered PM AA metabolism, whereas phorbol didecanoate, which lacks the ability to activate PKC, did not; 2) two structurally unrelated inhibitors of PKC activation (staurosporine and sphinganine) both abrogated PMA induced AA release in PM; and 3) pretreatment for 18 h with high dose PMA (used to deplete cellular PKC), but not phorbol didecanoate, rendered PM refractory to subsequent PMA stimulation of AA release. In contrast to PM, AM cultured in identical fashion failed to release or metabolize AA in response to either PMA or oleoyl acetylglycerol. PM and AM were also compared for their ability to release extracellular superoxide anion in response to PMA; once again, PM exhibited significantly greater release than did AM. Inasmuch as this unresponsiveness to activation of PKC distinguishes AM from other m phi populations, we conclude that it is a unique consequence of m phi differentiation in the lung. Moreover, because both AA metabolism and the respiratory burst are affected, this refractoriness appears to reflect a defect at some proximal level in PKC-mediated signaling.\r"

  ".W": "In this study we investigated the effects of long wave ultraviolet light (UVA) and various doses of protoporphyrin (PP) on the release of histamine from rat peritoneal and cutaneous mast cells. We also correlated these results with morphologic characteristics and viability of the cells. PP at a dose of 30 ng/ml plus UVA-induced negligible histamine release from rat peritoneal mast cells (RPMC), but was able to suppress the ability of the cells to release histamine in response to subsequent exposure to the calcium ionophore A23187, compound 48/80, or the combination of Ag and IgE. This functional change was associated with an increase in cell size, and cell lysis that gradually occurred during 24 h in culture. PP at a dose of 3 ng/ml plus UVA also significantly inhibited secretogogue-induced histamine release from rat peritoneal mast cells, but this dose was not associated with significant changes in morphology or viability. These various effects of PP plus UVA were also observed with mast cell preparations obtained by the enzymatic dispersion of rat skin. The suppression of secretogogue-induced histamine release in rat peritoneal mast cells treated with PP (3 ng/ml) and UVA could not be reversed by culturing the cells in the dark for 24 h in the absence of PP. Unlike the direct cytotoxic histamine releasing action of high doses of PP plus UVA, the suppressive effect of low PP doses could not be inhibited by catalase, but could be reduced by the absence of calcium. Our results indicate that PP plus UVA has dual effects on mast cells, apparently involving distinct mechanisms. This implies the possibility that PP and UVA at appropriate doses could be used in photochemotherapy of mast cell-mediated skin diseases.\r"

  ".W": "In addition to previous evidence for the roles of T cell-dependent immunity and delayed-type hypersensitivity in acquired resistance to systemic candidosis in mice, in the present study we have investigated the relative contributions of L3T4+ and Lyt-2+ lymphocytes in the protective immunity induced by vaccination with low virulence Candida albicans cells. We have also addressed the issue of the mode of Candida Ag recognition by specific T cells leading to cytokine release. Spleen cells from immunized mice produced high levels of IFN-gamma in vitro in response to Candida Ag, and this activity was abolished only by the combined treatment of the responder population with anti-L3T4 and anti-Lyt-2.2 mAb plus C. Positively selected L3T4+ and Lyt-2+ cells also produced IFN-gamma in vitro, provided accessory cells (plastic-adherent and Thy-1- Ia- splenocytes, respectively) were added to the lymphocyte-yeast cell cocultures. The production of IFN-gamma by purified L3T4+ and Lyt-2+ cells was inhibited by addition of the respective anti-class II and anti-class I H-2 antibody to the cultures. In vivo, administration of anti-L3T4, anti-Lyt-2.2 mAb or a combination of both significantly impaired the resistance of immunized mice to challenge with virulent C. albicans, as manifested by increased recovery of the yeast from the mouse kidneys. A similar effect was observed upon neutralization of endogenous IFN-gamma by treatment with rat mAb. These results suggest that both L3T4+ and Lyt-2+ T cells play a role in acquired immunity to systemic C. albicans infection, and that their activity may involve IFN-gamma-mediated stimulation of candidacidal mechanisms.\r"

  ".U": "90257355\r", 
  ".W": "Our study was performed to investigate whether macrophages become activated during an infection with Salmonella typhimurium and, if so, whether these activated macrophages kill S. typhimurium faster than resident macrophages. Mice received i.v. injections with a sublethal number of S. typhimurium; on about day 12 of the infection the numbers of bacteria in the liver and the spleen were maximal. During the infection, activation of peritoneal macrophages could be demonstrated on the basis of three criteria, i.e., the ability to inhibit the proliferation of Toxoplasma gondii, an enhanced production of H2O2 and an increased expression of Ia Ag. The rate of in vitro intracellular killing of S. typhimurium by these activated macrophages was not increased compared to that for resident macrophages. To determine the growth of S. typhimurium in activated mice a nalidixic acid-resistant mutant strain, called S. typhimurium 510R, was used. The net growth rates of the mutant S. typhimurium 510R in the spleen of S. typhimurium 510-activated and normal mice were similar. However, in the liver of S. typhimurium 510-activated mice the number of S. typhimurium 510R did not change during 3 to 48 h after injection. The role of specific antibodies during the initial phase of the infection was negligible, because only low levels of antibodies were detected during the first 15 days of infection and the growth rates of S. typhimurium 510 in the spleen and liver of mice with high titers of antibodies were not significantly different from the rates in normal mice. The results of this study demonstrate that although macrophages become activated during an infection with S. typhimurium, these cells do not display an enhanced bactericidal activity in vitro and in vivo no significant effect on the growth rate of S. typhimurium in the spleen and a bacteriostatic effect in the liver is found. Hence macrophage activation is probably not very important in the host defense against S. typhimurium.\r"

  ".W": "Host genetic determinants of resistance or susceptibility to a retrovirus-induced immunodeficiency syndrome, termed MAIDS, were evaluated in Fv-1b mice infected with the mixture of ecotropic, MCF, and defective murine leukemia viruses designated LP-BM5 murine leukemia viruses. Genes of the MHC were shown to exert a major influence on the development of disease and the extent of virus spread in mice infected as adults. Strains bearing the b, f, k, q, r, and s haplotypes were moderately to highly susceptible to MAIDS whereas mice of the d haplotype were the most resistant. Resistance to disease was strongly associated with inhibition of mink cell focus-inducing virus spread and, to a lesser extent, with inhibition of ecotropic virus expression. Mapping studies localizing resistance associated with the d haplotype to H-2Dd were confirmed by the demonstration that B6 mice carrying this gene as a transgene or by recombination were resistant to disease. Penetrance of resistance to disease associated with expression of H-2Dd was markedly influenced by MHC genes mapping to the left of H-2D and by non-MHC loci such that some strains bearing this gene were highly susceptible to MAIDS. The combined effects of MHC and background genes among 40 strains examined yielded a remarkably wide spectrum of disease phenotypes with the onset of advanced disease ranging from 10 wk to 72 wk postinfection. Resistance to disease in moderately to highly resistant strains was shown to develop with age. Unexpectedly, the disease resistant phenotype was found to be a recessive trait.\r"

In the present study the dynamics of IL-2 production was delineated during the infection, and the effect of rIL-2 treatment on granulomatous responsiveness was examined. IL-2 production in soluble egg Ag-stimulated spleen cells of mice was detectable at 6, peaked at 8 and waned by 20 wk of the infection. In contrast, Con A stimulus elicited high levels of IL-2 production by 8 wk which remained nearly unchanged throughout the infection. Administration of rIL-2 to acutely infected, anti-L3T4 mAb-treated, or chronically infected mice reversed the diminished or modulated granulomatous responses without restoring the ability for endogenous IL-2 production. Transfer of spleen cells of anti-L3T4 mAb-treated, chronically infected mice did not indicate a role for Ts cells in the impaired production of IL-2 in recipients. These data suggest that lack of IL-2 production can play an important role in the immunoregulation of the granulomatous response.\r"

TCN-1 and TCN-2 recognized Ag in tissue culture trypomastigotes but not in the amastigotes, epimastigotes, or metacyclic trypomastigotes using immunoblot assays and immunofluorescence. In addition, clones Y-H6, MV-13, and Silvio X-10/4 of T. cruzi revealed a unique banding pattern characteristic of each clone. In Silvio X-10/4, the mAb recognized four distinct bands ranging from 121,000 to 203,000 whereas in Y-H6 and MV-13 they identified bands ranging from 138,000 to 222,000. Characterization of neuraminidase by two-dimensional PAGE revealed the polypeptides that make up the enzyme to have isoelectrical points ranging from 6.55 to 7.30. Immunofluorescence and C-mediated lysis assays showed that the mAb reacted with a subset of trypomastigotes representing 28% of the total parasite population. Functional studies showed that the mAb enhanced infection of cultured cells by trypomastigotes. Our experiments confirm previous findings with polyclonal Ab and are in accordance with the hypothesis that neuraminidase modulates infection through a negative control mechanism.\r"

Here we analyze the transcription from the murine invariant chain gene and delimit the cis-acting sequences which confer IFN-gamma responsiveness in human fibroblasts. The major start of transcription of the gene is located 29 bp 3' of a TATA box and 85 bp 5' of the single ATG codon which opens the reading frame. To identify the regulatory elements of the murine IN promoter which respond to IFN-gamma, the 5' flanking region of the gene including its capsite and 85 bp of coding region have been cloned in front of the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) gene. Examination of this construct and various 5' and 3' deletion mutants for IFN-gamma inducibility in transient transfection assays revealed that DNA sequences between -261 and -189 were essential and sufficient for the induction. Removal of sequences between -215 and -189 reduced inducibility of the IN-promoter and abolished the capacity of the element to transmit inducibility to a heterologous promoter. Single or multiple base changes in other parts of the element also abolished inducibility. Cotransfection of a 350 molar excess of the IFN-gamma response element with an inducible IN-CAT chimeric construct blocked inducibility, suggesting positive regulation. A protein binding to the central part of the IFN-gamma response element was detectable in gel retardation experiments; it was active only in extracts from IFN-gamma-treated cells.\r"

  ".W": "In the process of analyzing the contribution of nonproductive alpha- and beta-chain gene rearrangements to the allelic exclusion of TCR gene expression, we have found a novel type of aberrant alpha-gene rearrangement. In one alpha-allele of the mouse KB5-C20 T cell clone, a J alpha gene segment has been abutted precisely to a sequence that does not display any homology to known V and D gene segment. The appended sequence originates from within the V alpha locus and is located, in the germ-line, 1 kb upstream of a member of the V alpha 2-gene segment subfamily. No recombination signal sequences have been found contiguous to the recombination point. These observations indicate that in normal T lymphocytes, TCR alpha-genes may be affected by aberrant rearrangements similar to those that predominate in human T cell tumors containing chromosome 14 inversion or translocation. Furthermore, compilation of published data and cloning and sequencing of three additional alpha-alleles has allowed us to examine the status of alpha-loci in nine mouse T cell clones expressing functional alpha beta-heterodimers. Interestingly, in contrast to the situation observed at the beta-locus, only 1 of 18 analyzed alpha-alleles has retained a germ-line unrearranged configuration. In addition, in each T cell clone, alpha-rearrangements on homologous chromosomes were unevenly distributed over the J alpha region and shown to generally involve neighboring J alpha gene segments.\r"

  ".U": "90257366\r", 
  ".W": "The majority of antibodies directed against p-azophenylarsonate (Ars) protein conjugates elicited during secondary immune responses of A/J mice bear a heritable cross-reactive Id (CRIa or IdCR) which corresponds to the utilization of a unique combination of variable region gene segments that can differ by somatic mutations. One such monoclonal anti-Ars antibody, 44-10, bears IdCR as defined by rabbit antisera but does not react with two anti-idiotypic mAb, 5Ci and AD8, which react with all primary (unmutated) IdCR+ antibodies and some secondary response IdCR+ antibodies. We therefore determined the complete sequence of antibody 44-10, which differs from the germline encoded (unmutated) IdCR+ antibody 36-65 at four positions in the H chain V region (VH): position 55 in the second complementarity determining region, 100 and 107 (D-gene junctions) and 110 (in JH2). The 44-10 L chain is unmutated. Sequence analyses of five other secondary immune response anti-Ars IdCR+ antibodies chosen on the basis of sharing one or more of the amino acid substitutions found in 44-10, were correlated with idiotypic expression of this set of antibodies. The results suggest that the mutation at VH position 55 (Asn----Lys) is responsible for loss of the 5Ci idiotope. To substantiate this hypothesis, oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis of the germline encoded (unmutated) IdCR+ antibody was used to produce two mutants, one with VH Lys 55 and the other containing residues at positions 100, 107 and 110 identical to those found in 44-10. Id binding studies on these mutants confirm that 5Ci idiotope loss is due to conformational changes resulting from a mutation at VH position 55. This mutation also results in loss of the AD8 idiotope in the structural context of antibody 44-10.\r"

Different hybridomas tended to express VH genes of the same family when the cognate Ag had the same or similar carbohydrate structures; i.e., the VH genes of the J558 family (group 1) were preferentially expressed in the mAb directed to various gangliosides that have NeuAc alpha (or NeuGc alpha) 2-3 and/or 2-8 linkage (71%), the most common linkage of sialic acid residues in the gangliosides of higher animals, and the hybridomas directed to sulfated glycolipids also expressed mainly the VH genes of the J558 family (80%). In contrast, the five mAb directed to various gangliosides with NeuAc alpha 2-6 linkage were exclusively encoded by the VH genes of Q52 family (group 2, 100%), and three antibodies directed to gangliosides with a NeuAc alpha 2-9 linkage all expressed genes of J606 family (group 6, 100%). The VH family usage was largely correlated with the linkage of sialic acid residues in the cognate carbohydrate Ag, but was not correlated at all with the difference in the fine specificities toward the core neutral carbohydrate chain, to which the sialic acid residues were attached. These findings suggest that the VH gene family in these anticarbohydrate antibodies is selected, depending primarily on the linkage of the sialic acid residues in carbohydrate Ag; these residues form the immunodominant sugar residue in the respective antigenic determinant.\r"

  ".W": "We have previously shown the ability of different cytokines to induce antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) in murine cells in vitro. In addition we found that the administration to mice of IL-2-induced cells which mediated ADCC and that these cells were phenotypically similar to the cells induced in vitro. In the present study we tested the ability of various cytokines, including IL-1, TNF, IFN-alpha, and IFN-gamma to induce ADCC in vivo. We found that both IFN-alpha and IFN-gamma induced ADCC in the livers and spleens of C3H/Hen-treated mice and that these cytokines together with TNF enhanced the IL-2-induced ADCC in vivo. In C57BL/6 mice which, as previously shown, exhibit relatively low ADCC activity, IFN-alpha and IFN-gamma increased the IL-2-induced ADCC only when 100,000 U of IL-2 were used for priming. The effect of IFN-alpha on ADCC was dose dependent and was optimal after the administration of 200,000 U of the cytokine given three times a day for 3 days. Similar to the cells induced in vivo by IL-2, the precursors of the cells mediating ADCC were asialo GM1+ whereas the effectors were mainly nonadherent, Thy-1+ cells. IFN-alpha-generated cells mediating ADCC in the liver and spleen and, when combined with IL-2, ADCC was induced in the thymus as well. This effect of IFN-alpha on the induction of ADCC was exploited in an immunotherapy model in which we found that IFN-alpha significantly enhanced the antibody-mediated antitumor effect on established B16 melanoma liver micrometastases. Furthermore, when IL-2 and IFN-alpha administration was combined with the administration of mAb, a significantly reduced number of established 6- to 8-day B16 melanoma liver macrometastases and prolonged survival of tumor-bearing mice were seen. These studies imply that the administration of appropriate cytokine combinations may be a useful adjunct to the administration of mAb for the treatment of cancer in humans.\r"

  ".W": "Successive coculture of Lewis lung carcinoma (3LL) cells with T cell-derived lymphokines and LPS-activated macrophages has led to the acquisition of 3LL tumor variants (macrophage-resistant 3LL tumor variants (3LL-R)), manifesting a highly reduced sensitivity to the cytotoxic potential of T cell-derived lymphokines and LPS-activated macrophages and TNF-alpha. However, when 3LL-R cells are cocultured with Poly I:C-activated macrophages or with conditioned medium derived from these effector cells a significant lysis is observed. TNF-alpha participates in the cytolytic process of Poly I:C-activated macrophages as anti-TNF-alpha antibodies abolish the cytotoxic effect of these effector cells. In addition, class I IFN is involved because IFN-alpha and IFN-beta act synergistically on TNF-alpha mediated lysis of 3LL-R cells within 18 h. Moreover, anticlass I IFN antibodies abolish the cytolytic capacity of Poly I:C-activated macrophages. Hence, Poly I:C-induced macrophage-mediated cytolysis of 3LL-R cells may result from 1) the induction of macrophages by Poly I:C to secrete high amounts of TNF-alpha and class I IFN and 2) a synergism between IFN-alpha/IFN-beta and TNF-alpha on lysis of 3LL-R cells. This synergism does not result from a class I IFN-mediated enhancement of TNF-alpha receptor expression on 3LL-R cells. Therefore, the sensitivity of 3LL-R cells to TNF-alpha-mediated lysis in the presence of class I IFN is most probably regulated at the post-TNF-alpha receptor level. Furthermore, treatment of mice with Poly I:C strongly reduces the metastatic capacity of 3LL-R tumor cells, suggesting the participation of macrophages in the eradication of the established metastasis. Hence, TNF-alpha-resistant 3LL-R tumor cells may serve as a useful tool for the detection of alternative macrophage-related cytotoxins leading to the destruction of neoplastic cells both in vitro and in vivo.\r"

  ".W": "Intratumoral heterogeneity has been proposed as a possible basis for immunotherapeutic failure when tumor-specific agents such as tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) are employed for cancer therapy. To examine this issue, highly specific oligoclonal MHC class I-restricted cytolytic TIL grown in bulk culture from patient 397 were used to immunoselect a TIL-resistant variant tumor from the autologous cultured melanoma line 397-mel. Four cycles of immunoselection produced tumor 397-R4, a variant completely resistant to 397 TIL but not to allogeneic LAK cell lysis in 4-h 51Cr release assays. By flow microfluorometry analysis, this tumor variant had not lost MHC molecules, adhesion molecules, or a variety of tumor-associated Ag expressed by the parent tumor but showed decreased expression of many Ag examined. Failure of 397-R4 to cold target inhibit TIL lysis of 397-mel suggested that cell-surface modification was at least one mechanism causing TIL resistance. The inherent lysability of 397-R4 was equal to 397-mel, as confirmed by lectin-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, lysis by non-MHC restricted allogeneic TIL, and lysis by a second line of 397 TIL grown independently from tumor 397. Treatment of 397-R4 with IFN-alpha or IFN-gamma, +/- TNF-alpha for 72 h before cytolytic assays enhanced TIL lysis of this target slightly, and enhanced surface expression of MHC class I and II molecules and the adhesion molecule ICAM-1. The resistant phenotype of 397-R4 was evident in all clones of 397-R4 examined and has been maintained in serial culture for over 13 mo and through passage in nude mice, suggesting that such stable tumor variants may provide an in vivo escape mechanism from specific immune reagents such as TIL. Evolving patterns of TIL culture clonality over time, as well as the spontaneous emergence of different clones in two long term TIL cultures grown under identical conditions from the same source of cryopreserved tumor, were documented by analyzing TCR gene rearrangements and suggest that TIL from different culture passages or lines may be used to overcome resistant tumor subpopulations.\r"

This study compared the cation-stimulated adenosine triphosphatase enzyme (ATPase) activities of platelets from allergic (n = 18), potentially allergic (asymptomatic, positive skin test, n = 5) and normal patients (n = 10), all of whom were without symptoms at the time of the study. Platelets were separated by centrifugation, were sonicated, and were assayed for cation-dependent ATPase activity by spectrophotometry. The mean Na+,K(+)-ATPase activity (in nanomoles per microgram protein per minute) of allergic subjects (0.94 +/- 1.28) was significantly lower than that of normal subjects (3.93 +/- 1.58). No Na+,K(+)-ATPase activity was detectable in platelets from eight of the allergic subjects. The Na+,K(+)-ATPase activity of potentially allergic subjects was intermediate between those of the allergic and normal subjects. A significant negative correlation (p less than 0.01) was observed between serum IgE levels and platelet Na+,K(+)-ATPase values, thus suggesting a relationship between the reduced platelet Na+,K(+)-ATPase and IgE immunoglobulin. No such differences were observed for the Ca+(+)- and Mg+(+)-stimulated ATPases. In vivo dysfunction of the plasma membrane Na+,K(+)-ATPase enzyme in allergic subjects could have profound effects on levels of intracellular cations and thus platelet activation and function.\r"

Glomerular filtration rate, as assessed by plasma creatinine and clearance of both creatinine and 51Cr-EDTA, was normal in most patients, and was little affected by restoration of normocalcaemia. Renal concentrating capacity, as determined by the desmopressin test, was abnormally low in 14 of 19 patients, but increased significantly after surgery. It is concluded that serious renal damage is seldom encountered in present-day HPT patients, but that a treatable decrease in renal concentrating capacity often exists.\r"

An analysis of the molecular species showed an even greater extent of change than was observed by fatty acid composition analysis. The quantity of 18:2(n-6)/18:2(n-6) molecular species [18:2(n-6) in C-1 position/18:2(n-6) in C-2 position] in cardiolipin decreased when rats were fed lipids that were depleted of an essential fatty acid but not deficient in essential fatty aids (eicosatrienoic acid did not appear). The decrease in 18:2(n-6)/18:2(n-6) species in cardiolipin was most pronounced in rats fed sardine oil, in which the ratio of (n-3) to (n-6) polyunsaturated fatty acids was 0.2.

The test diets were isocaloric and provided 41% of total energy as fat. Coinciding with 3-9% higher maternal body weight gain throughout the lactation period with the menhaden oil diet, the suckling rats in the experimental group at the ages of 3-9 d gained 5-10% more weight than did their control counterparts. When compared with corn oil, maternal dietary menhaden oil induced not only a higher weight percentage but also higher concentrations (microgram/mL) of EPA, DHA and total (n-3) fatty acids in milk, plasma, platelets and erythrocytes of neonates. These changes were accompanied by lower arachidonic and linoleic acid levels. EPA and DHA were detected in all three blood components of the control group, whose corn oil diet contained linolenic acid but not longer chain (n-3) fatty acids. This finding, together with the higher DHA to EPA ratios found in the three blood components than in the milk of the experimental group, suggests that neonatal rats possess the enzymes necessary for producing DHA from EPA and linolenate by desaturation and elongation mechanisms.\r"

Nevertheless, the mean weights of the kidneys from cod liver oil-fed animals were significantly higher than those of all other dietary groups. Platelets of rats from the groups receiving the animal fat contained significantly lower levels of linoleic acid, 18:2(n-6) [a precursor of arachidonic acid, 20:4(n-6)], than did platelets from rats receiving the fat of vegetable origin. Although the soybean-, canola- and cod liver oil-fed animals received substantial quantities of (n-3) fatty acids [alpha-linolenic acid, 18:3(n-3); eicosapentaenoic acid, 20:5(n-3); and docosahexaenoic acid, 22:6(n-3)], only the platelets of the latter two groups contained detectable levels of these fatty acids along with their products of elongation/desaturation/retroconversion. Platelets of the cod liver oil-fed group contained significantly less arachidonic acid, a major precursor of eicosanoids, than did those from all other dietary groups. However, platelet arachidonic levels also varied markedly among the other dietary groups. Diet-induced fatty acid changes observed in platelets of various dietary groups may influence platelet responses, including secretion, aggregation and biosynthesis of eicosanoids.\r"

  ".U": "90257716\r", 
  ".W": "Both cysteinesulfinate-independent and cysteinesulfinate-dependent pathways are involved in the catabolism of cyst(e)ine by freshly isolated rat renal cortical tubules. Sulfate and thiosulfate were shown to be the major sulfur-containing products that accumulated in incubations of renal tubules with 1 mmol/L or 25 mmol/L [35S]cyst(e)ine. Thiosulfate is an intermediate in the oxidation of the sulfide produced by the cysteinesulfinate-independent catabolism of cyst(e)ine by desulfhydration pathway(s), whereas sulfate is formed both by further oxidation of thiosulfate and by oxidation of the sulfite formed by the cysteinesulfinate-transamination pathway. Incubation of renal tubules with propargylglycine inhibited gamma-cystathionase activity by 85%, and this resulted in a 46% decrease in sulfate production and a 68% decrease in thiosulfate production when the treated renal tubules were incubated with 1 mmol/L [35S]cyst(e)ine. Addition of 25 mmol/L unlabeled cysteinesulfinate to create a diluting/trapping pool for [35S]cysteinesulfinate formed from [35S]cysteine resulted in a 53% decrease in [35S]sulfate production in incubations with 1 mmol/L cysteine. Thus, some cyst(e)ine catabolism probably occurred by a cysteinesulfinate-dependent pathway. No production of taurine or hypotaurine was detected in incubations with cyst(e)ine. Thus, cysteinesulfinate formed from cysteine was further catabolized primarily to sulfate instead of to taurine and hypotaurine. Most cyst(e)ine catabolism by the epithelial cells of the renal tubule probably can be accounted for by two pathways: 1) the beta-cleavage of cystine catalyzed by lambda-cystathionase and 2) the formation and transamination of cysteinesulfinate catalyzed by cysteine dioxygenase and aspartate aminotransferase.\r"

For rats fed a nonpurified diet and consuming 26 micrograms of folic acid daily, the respective concentrations of these total folates, short-chain folates and thymidylate synthase bindable folates were, in nmol/g, 10.2, 2.5 and 3.5 in liver, 3.9, 1.8 and 2.0 in kidney, 4.2, 1.2 and 1.0 in bone marrow, 2.3, 0.6 and 0.2 in adrenal, 2.1, 0.3 and 0.5 in spleen, 2.1, 0.9 and 0.8 in jejunal smooth muscle, 1.2, 0.9 and 0.2 in jejunal mucosa, 1.0, 0.3 and 0.6 in testis, 0.7, 0.1 and 0.2 in heart, 0.3, 0.1 and 0.1 in skeletal muscle, 0.5, 0.1 and 0.3 in brain and 0.7, 0.002 and 0 in erythrocytes. The predominant pteroylpolyglutamate chain length was 6 residues in all tissues except kidney, jejunal mucosa, skeletal muscle and brain, in which the value was 5 residues. A folate-deficient diet (30 ng/d) fed for 3 wk resulted in a depression in the total folate concentration of all tissues (except brain); the depression was generally greater for short-chain than for long-chain folates and was accompanied by a lengthening of the pteroylpolyglutamate chain. Opposite results followed folate excess of 4 to 5.4 mg/d. The fractional change in the folate concentration of the individual tissues, following perturbation of dietary folate, did not vary greatly among tissues.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Coke-oven workers are occupationally exposed to relatively high levels of PAH and are at increased risk for lung cancer. Three blood samples were collected from each of the 56 coke-oven workers exposed to PAH and 44 unexposed workers employed in a steel-rolling factory of the same plant. In addition, PAH levels were measured in ambient air by personal sampling, and the excretion of 1-hydroxypyrene in urine was also measured on 3 consecutive working days. All participants were interviewed regarding working conditions, personal hygiene, and smoking habits. The results showed that the coke-oven workers were exposed to substantial concentrations of atmospheric PAH (1-186 micrograms/m3), including benzo[a]pyrene (0.1-7.8 micrograms/m3) and pyrene (0.6-23.6 micrograms/m3). Both benzo[a]pyrene and pyrene were shown to be representative for the whole group of PAH. Forty-seven percent of the coke-oven workers had detectable levels of PAH-DNA adducts in their white blood cells, compared with 30% of the controls. In both groups, smokers had significantly higher levels of PAH-DNA adducts than did nonsmokers. At one site, we found the correlation positive between DNA adducts and the duration of exposure (r = .47, P = .005). Generally, the correlation was not significant between PAH-DNA adducts in blood and the concentration of PAH in the air and 1-hydroxypyrene in urine.\r"

The tumor was transplanted subcutaneously, the drugs were administered peritumorally. Gamma-interferon treatment starting two days after tumor implantation resulted in a dose-dependent growth inhibiting effect. Tumor necrosis factor alpha was only effective at the highest concentration. Different combinations of the drugs have additive or synergistic antiproliferative effects. The combination of both highest doses completely inhibited tumor growth without any obvious toxic effects on the rats. Rechallenge of the cured rats with a tumor piece in the contralateral flank did not result in a tumor specific immune response. Shortening of the treatment period to two weeks resulted in an increased lag-period, but finally all tumors started to grow. Furthermore, the anti-tumor effect was dependent on tumor volume at start of therapy. Monotherapy could not inhibit tumor growth of an established tumor. The combination with both highest doses, however, inhibited tumor growth even when treatment was started at a tumor volume of two to five cm3. Treatment with gamma-interferon and tumor necrosis factor is most effective at low tumor burden. These studies suggest that clinical application of these drugs is most effective in an adjuvant setting.\r"

None of the sutures predisposed to infection and there was wide variability but no correlation in urine pH. Although initially the polydioxanone incited a greater inflammatory response, by six months all three sutures were similar. The absorption of polydioxanone was slower than chromic catgut suture, but similar to the absorption of polyglactin. There was no significant difference in calculogenic potential between the suture materials tested over a six-month period. Based on this study in rats, polydioxanone suture would appear to be equal to catgut and polyglactin suture in bladder surgery.\r"

  ".W": "Previously, kidneys from three-week-old cpk/cpk C57/B16 mice were found to contain elevated mRNA levels for the basement membrane components collagen IV and laminin [1]. Here primary cultures of kidney epithelial cells derived from cpk/cpk C57/B16 mice were established and the production of these proteins in culture was studied. Primary cultures of cpk/cpk mouse kidney epithelial cells were observed to have a more polygonal, flattened morphology than cells from unaffected littermate kidneys. The rate of collagen IV and laminin biosynthesis was determined by means of [35S] labelling studies followed by immunoprecipitation. Collagen IV and laminin biosynthesis are elevated by approximately twofold or more in primary cultures derived from 20-day-old cpk/cpk mice, as compared with parallel primary cultures derived from their unaffected littermates. Similarly, laminin B1 chain mRNA is elevated in primary cultures derived from 20-day-old cpk/cpk mice. In primary cultures derived from younger (day 11) mice, similar differences in the rates of both collagen and laminin biosynthesis were not observed between the two culture types. These observations are consistent with the previously reported age-dependent differences observed in laminin and in collagen IV gene expression in both cpk/cpk and wild-type mouse kidneys, and suggest that the regulation of overproduction of these proteins is due to an alteration in the kidney cells and not due to systemic factors.\r"

  ".W": "The urinary excretion of kappa light chains, beta 2-microglobulin and albumin was examined in patients with newly diagnosed and long-standing insulin-dependent (IDDM) and non-insulin-dependent (NIDDM) diabetes mellitus, and compared to age-matched control subjects. Patients with IDDM diagnosed within two months, presented with normal albumin excretion, whereas the concentrations of beta 2-microglobulin and kappa light chain in urine were higher than in control subjects. The initiation of insulin therapy reduced, but did not completely normalize, the elevated rate of kappa light chain excretion. Patients with IDDM of long duration showed increased urine excretion of kappa light chains and albumin. In keeping with the findings in IDDM, patients with newly diagnosed NIDDM (within one year) showed increased urinary excretion of kappa light chains compared with control subjects. There was, however, no further increase in light chain excretion with longer duration of NIDDM. To study the effect of short-term hyperglycemia on urinary protein excretion, 12 normal subjects participated in a three-step hyperglycemic clamp study, during which their plasma glucose concentration was raised by +50, +125 and +300 mg/dl. The urine excretion of albumin and beta 2-microglobulin rose progressively with each hyperglycemic clamp step, whereas that of kappa light chain excretion was unaffected by hyperglycemia. We conclude that increased urinary excretion of kappa light chain is a consistent finding in all types of diabetes mellitus, and can be observed even when the albumin excretion is normal. Since the serum concentration of kappa light chain is normal in diabetes, the increased urinary excretion of kappa light chains must be of renal origin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Vascular endothelial cell damage plays a central role in the pathogenesis of the hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), resulting in intravascular platelet activation and thrombotic microangiopathy. A deficiency of the antiaggregatory prostacyclin (PGI2) has been postulated by experiments under ex vivo conditions. However, this observation has not been confirmed in vivo. The pathophysiological contribution of thromboxane (Tx)A2, a potent vasoconstrictor and platelet-aggregating prostanoid which is predominantly produced by platelets, has not been elucidated so far. In order to quantitate endogenous formation of TxA2 in children with HUS, plasma concentrations of the enzymatic metabolite 11-dehydro-TxB2 of TxA2 and urinary excretion rates of three major TxA2 metabolites, TxB2, 11-dehydro-TxB2 and 2,3-dinor-TxB2 were analyzed using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. PGI2 biosynthesis was assessed by measuring urinary excretion of an index metabolite of its systemic production, 2,3-dinor-6-keto-prostaglandin (PG) F1 alpha, and an index of its renal production, 6-keto-PGF1 alpha. TxA2 biosynthesis was markedly elevated in the acute phase of HUS. This activation could be detected for a longer period of time than the presence of thrombocytopenia. Concomitantly in the acute phase, renal PGI2 formation was significantly elevated and systemic PGI2 formation was elevated in 50% of the patients. These data indicate that TxA2 formation is increased in the acute phase in patients with HUS. This enhanced biosynthesis is consistent with increased platelet activation, whereas the increased PGI2 biosynthesis reflects predominantly renal endothelial cell damage.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of an abrupt rise in bicarbonate concentration on cytoplasmic pH was studied in human platelets suspended in a Tyrode's buffer. Addition of bicarbonate raised extracellular pH but simultaneously caused pronounced cytoplasmic acidification. This effect may be due to combination of bicarbonate with hydrogen ions in extracellular fluid to form carbonic acid, which is converted by carbonic anhydrase to water and carbon dioxide. Bicarbonate ions do not diffuse rapidly across cell membranes, whereas carbon dioxide is highly diffusible and can combine with water in the cytoplasm, forming carbonic acid and reducing the intracellular pH. In accord with this explanation cytoplasmic acidification by bicarbonate was antagonised by acetazolamide (an inhibitor of carbonic anhydrase). Cytoplasmic acidification could contribute to adverse effects of intravenous sodium bicarbonate in patients with severe acidaemia. These findings add weight to the body of opinion that such treatment is both illogical and dangerous.\r"

Sequence analysis of transcripts encoded by the V alpha 12.1 region showed rearrangements to a limited number of J alpha region segments.

We have examined whether, during normal muscle development, myoblasts--mononucleate muscle precursor cells--can cross the basal lamina that surrounds each multinucleate muscle fibre. We marked myoblasts in vivo by injecting replication-defective retroviral vectors encoding LacZ into muscle tissue and analysed the fate of their progeny by the expression of beta-galactosidase. A dual labelling method with broad application to retroviral lineage-marking studies was developed to ensure that most clusters of labelled cells were clones derived from a single precursor cell. Most of the myoblasts that were infected at a late stage of rat hindlimb development, when each fibre with its satellite myoblasts is individually encased in a basal lamina sheath, gave rise to clones that contributed to several labelled fibres. Our results show that myoblasts from healthy fibres migrate across basal lamina during normal development and could contribute to the repair of fibres damaged by injury or disease.\r"

  ".W": "The class of immunoglobulin is defined by the constant region of its heavy chain. When a B lymphocyte switches the class of heavy chain it produces, the constant region of mu-type heavy chain is replaced; this occurs through a DNA rearrangement that brings the gene segment encoding the new constant region close to the VDJ segment encoding the variable region. The pre-B-cell line 18-81, which switches from heavy chain mu to gamma 2b production in culture, occasionally abnormally rearranges the heavy chain locus so that DNA sequences between the switch regions of mu and gamma 2b are inverted. Because looping-out is an intermediate step in generating an inversion, the switch rearrangement could occur by looping-out and deletion. Provided that recombination is reciprocal, this would produce a circle of DNA. Indeed, circular DNA molecules have been isolated as products of rearrangement among gene segments encoding the variable regions of the T-cell receptor and of the immunoglobulin heavy chain and light chain. But whereas the breakpoints for the variable region rearrangement are precisely defined, the breakpoints for any given heavy chain class switch are scattered over a length of greater than 6 kilobases, including both switch regions. We have now isolated circular DNA containing the sequences deleted by class-switching, thereby showing that the immunoglobulin heavy chain class switch occurs through looping-out and deletion.\r"

Previously, we showed that linear plasmids with 108 base pairs of C4A4 DNA (YLp108CA) efficiently acquired telomeres, whereas plasmids containing 28-64 base pairs of C4A4 DNA also promoted telomere formation, but with reduced efficiency. Although many of the C4A4 termini on these plasmids underwent recombination with a C4A2 terminus, the mechanism of telomere-telomere recombination was not established. We now report the sequence of the C4A4 ends from the linear plasmids. The results provide strong evidence for a novel recombination process involving a gene conversion event that requires little homology, occurs at or near the boundary of telomeric and nontelomeric DNA, and resembles the recombination process involved in bacteriophage T4 DNA replication.\r"

This incidence is higher than that reported from other studies of critically ill patients who were not mechanically ventilated. Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that three variables (higher rates of infusion, greater tube-feeding osmolality, and change of tube-feeding product) were statistically significant predictors of diarrhea incidence. Antibiotic use and serum albumin levels were not predictors. In a stepwise multiple regression analysis, the duration of diarrhea was predicted by frequency of diarrhea, within the first 5 days of tube-feeding onset, tube-feeding product osmolality, and rate of tube-feeding infusion. Serum albumin levels and frequency of diarrhea beyond 6 days of tube-feeding onset did not predict duration of diarrhea. Higher osmolality and infusion rates of tube-feeding products did contribute to prediction of both incidence and duration of diarrhea.\r"

  ".W": "Thrombolytic agents are being used with increasing frequency to produce reperfusion of acute myocardial infarction in humans. This study was designed to assess the potential of a magnetic resonance (MR) contrast agent, the manganese chelate of N,N'-bis(pyridoxal-5-phosphate) ethylenediamine-N,N'-diacetic acid (DPDP), in differentiating between reversible and irreversible myocardial injury during reperfusion. Ischemia was produced in rats by occlusion of the left coronary artery for either 15 minutes (n = 10) or 2 hours (n = 10), followed in both cases by 30 minutes of reperfusion. Signal intensity (SI) was measured before and after (every 15 minutes for 1 hour) the administration of Mn-DPDP. Prior to intravenous injection of the contrast agent, no significant difference in SI was observed between normal and reversibly or irreversibly injured myocardium. Mn-DPDP produced greater enhancement of SI of the irreversibly injured region compared with normal myocardium. There was no differential enhancement of the reversibly injured region compared with normal myocardium. Thus, Mn-DPDP is useful in discriminating reversible from irreversible injury in reperfused myocardium.\r"

  ".W": "Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of the kidneys was performed in 14 patients with a severe form of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS), a major public health problem in Far Eastern Asia. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first report of renal assessment with MR imaging in HFRS. Three MR imaging studies were done while patients were in the oliguric phase, 19 were done during the diuretic phase, and three were done during the convalescent phase. The authors differentiated the cortex and the medulla in all 21 T1-weighted examinations and all 25 T2-weighted examinations. Seven T1-weighted examinations (33%) and 20 T2-weighted examinations (80%) showed low signal intensity along the outer portion of the medulla, which thus enabled differentiation from the inner medulla. Low signal intensity along the medulla (especially the outer medulla) on T2-weighted images, possibly representing medullary hemorrhage, is fairly constant and characteristic on MR images of the kidneys in patients with HFRS.\r"

OPLL was demonstrated as a low-signal-intensity band between the bone marrow of the vertebral body and the dural sac on T1- and T2-weighted images. Continuous cervical OPLL was easier to diagnose than segmental cervical OPLL. T2-weighted images were more useful for detection of ossification of the ligaments. OYL was recognized as an impression on the posterior dural sac. Formation of bone marrow within an area of ossification, shown as increased or intermediate signal intensity, was observed in 56% of the cases of continuous OPLL, 11% of the cases of segmental OPLL, and none of the cases of OYL. The degree of cord compression was more severe in continuous OPLL. Degeneration of the disk was frequently associated with both types of OPLL.\r"

Analysis of the DNA cleavage patterns for dimers of the Fe.EDTA-proteins corresponding to GCN4 residues 222 to 281 and 226 to 281 revealed that the NH2-termini were in the major groove nine to ten base pairs apart and were symmetrically displaced four to five base pairs from the central C of the recognition site. This result is consistent with the Y-shaped scissor grip-leucine zipper model recently proposed for a class of DNA binding proteins important in the regulation of gene expression.\r"

In situ hybridization on serial sections was used to prove that most hippocampal pyramidal neurons contain both APP-751 and APP-695 mRNA species. The APP-751/APP-695 mRNA ratio is generally increased during Alzheimer's disease, as shown by RNA gel blot analysis. Moreover, there was a strong linear relation between the increase in APP-751/APP-695 mRNA ratio in pyramidal neurons and the density of senile plaques within the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex. Thus, the increase in APP-751/APP-695 mRNA provides a molecular marker for regional variations in plaque density between individuals diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease by the commonly used composite criteria.\r"

The binding proteins for cyclosporin A and FK506, cyclophilin and FKBP, respectively, are peptidyl-prolyl-cis-trans isomerases, or rotamases. One proposed mechanism for rotamase catalysis by cyclophilin involves a tetrahedral adduct of an amide carbonyl and an enzyme-bound nucleophile. The potent FKBP rotamase inhibitor FK506 has a highly electrophilic carbonyl that is adjacent to an acyl-pipicolinyl (homoprolyl) amide bond. Such a functional group would be expected to form a stabilized, enzyme-bound tetrahedral adduct. Spectroscopic and chemical evidence reveals that the drug interacts noncovalently with its receptor, suggesting that the alpha-keto amid of FK506 serves as a surrogate for the twisted amide of a bound peptide substrate.\r"

Investigations have demonstrated myelin basic protein (MBP)-reactive T cells that were activated in vivo in MS patients, suggesting that MBP may be a target antigen in MS. The variable (V) region of the T cell receptor (TCR) beta chain was examined among 83 T cell lines from both MS patients and healthy subjects that were reactive with the immunodominant region of human MBP (residues 84 to 102) or with a second immunodominant region of MBP (143 to 168). V beta 17 and to a lesser extent V beta 12 were frequently used in recognition of MBP(84-102) among different individuals. In contrast, V beta 17 was very infrequent among lines reactive with MBP (143-168). These data demonstrate shared TCR V beta gene usage for the recognition of immunodominant regions of the human autoantigen MBP. Such TCR structures may be used as targets for specific immunotherapy in MS.\r"

Immunohistochemical and biochemical studies have indicated that the amyloid subunit in HCHWA-D is antigenically related to and homologous in sequence with the amyloid beta protein isolated from brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease and Down syndrome. The amyloid beta protein is encoded by the amyloid beta protein precursor (APP) gene located on chromosome 21. Restriction fragment length polymorphisms detected by the APP gene were used to examine whether this gene is a candidate for the genetic defect in HCHWA-D. The data indicate that the APP gene is tightly linked to HCHWA-D and therefore, in contrast to familial Alzheimer's disease, cannot be excluded as the site of mutation in HCHWA-D.\r"

A deficiency of this processing event may ultimately prove to be the etiological event in Alzheimer's disease that gives rise to senile plaque formation.\r"

Thorough investigation of the entire biliary tree was necessary to identify associated biliary disease, which included biliary-enteric anastomotic stricture, intrahepatic stricture, excluded sectoral bile duct from iatrogenic injury and reflux of abnormally contaminated intestinal contents. Extensive reconstructions of the biliary tract were performed upon three patients. Recurrence of the abscess occurred once after percutaneous and once after surgical drainage and was managed by drainage of the associated excluded sectoral bile duct or fistulojejunostomy. Operative drainage of hepatic abscess after prior biliary operation may be preferable to percutaneous techniques to provide definitive surgical management of associated pathologic findings of the biliary tract.\r"

DESIGN: Randomized, placebo-controlled, and double-blind study. SETTING: Outpatient clinic of a government referral-based research hospital. PATIENTS: Volunteer sample of 34 patients with asymptomatic HIV infection who had CD4 counts of 400 cells/mm3 or more, positive peripheral blood mononuclear cell cultures for HIV, or p24 antigenemia. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomly assigned to receive either IFN-alpha or placebo, 35 x 10(6) units per day subcutaneously. Doses of IFN-alpha or placebo were modified according to predefined laboratory and clinical criteria. Therapy lasted at least 12 weeks. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Seventeen patients were randomly assigned to each group. The two groups had similar mean CD4 counts at study entry. Thirty-five percent of patients assigned to receive IFN-alpha withdrew from the study because of toxicity. The average daily dose of IFN-alpha was 17.5 x 10(6) units. All patients receiving IFN-alpha reported flu-like symptoms; other toxicities included granulocytopenia (55%) and elevated liver enzyme levels (45%). While receiving IFN-alpha, 7 patients (41%) became HIV culture negative (three or more consecutive negative peripheral blood mononuclear cell cultures taken at least 2 weeks apart). In contrast, 2 patients in the placebo group (13%) became culture negative while on study (P = 0.05). During the treatment period, CD4 lymphocyte percentages were sustained at or above the baseline level in patients receiving IFN-alpha and declined slightly in patients receiving placebo. Of the 32 study patients followed after study (range, 5 to 33 months), no patients in the IFN-alpha group developed an acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-defining opportunistic infection, compared with 5 patients in the placebo group (P = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of early-stage HIV infection with IFN-alpha can result in a decrease in frequency of viral isolation. Although its use may be accompanied by dose-dependent toxicities, IFN-alpha may have a role in slowing progression of HIV disease.\r"

DESIGN: Open, phase-I study with randomization between two preparations of interferon-alpha. SETTING: Outpatient clinic of a cancer research center. PATIENTS: Forty-three patients with Kaposi sarcoma associated with AIDS. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were treated with interferon-alpha, 4.5, 9, or 18 million U/d, and zidovudine, 100 or 200 mg orally every 4 hours. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Neutropenia was the major dose-limiting toxicity. Fatigue, liver enzyme elevation, anemia, and thrombocytopenia were dose-limiting in some patients. Maximum tolerated dosages for interferon-alpha 2a with zidovudine, respectively, were 4.5 million U/d with 200 mg every 4 hours or 18 million U/d with 100 mg every 4 hours. An interferon-alpha n1 [corrected] dosage of 9 million U/d with zidovudine dosages of either 100 or 200 mg every 4 hours induced dose-limiting toxicity in most patients. Of 37 evaluable patients, 17 (46%; 95% CI, 30% to 62%) showed complete or partial tumor regression. Antitumor effects occurred more frequently in patients with baseline CD4 counts above 200 x 10(6) cells/L (65%) than in patients with lower baseline counts (30%, P = 0.05). Effects on CD4 cells were related to both initial CD4 count and interferon dose. Increased skin test reactivity and decreased serum human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) p24 antigen and virus recovery from blood cells were seen. CONCLUSIONS: Combined therapy with interferon-alpha and zidovudine can be safely administered to patients with AIDS and Kaposi sarcoma. The observed effects on tumor growth, HIV replication, and immune function support further studies of the combination in patients at various stages of HIV infection.\r"

MAIN RESULTS: Screening in the community detects new overt thyrotoxicosis or hypothyroidism in approximately 0.5% of the general population. The yield is best among women over 40 years of age (1%) and is lowest among young men (0%). Case-finding (testing clinic patients who are seeing a physician for unrelated reasons) has a better yield and is less expensive than screening in the community. Patients hospitalized with acute illnesses do not benefit from routine thyroid function testing. However, patients who are admitted to specialized geriatric units because of general disability, failure to thrive, and other indications may benefit. In various studies, from 2% to 5% of patients admitted to geriatric units have treatable thyroid disease. The serum total thyroxine, free thyroxine index, free thyroxine, and sensitive thyrotropin assay are all effective as initial tests for screening. The sensitive thyrotropin assay is less cost-effective than the other choices. RECOMMENDATIONS: Case-finding in some women over 40 years of age can be useful. Patients admitted to specialized geriatric units may also benefit from routine testing. Thyroid function tests are not indicated for community screening programs or for patients hospitalized with acute medical or psychiatric illnesses.\r"

  ".W": "Penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) of Listeria monocytogenes were detected by their ability to bind to [2,3-3H]benzylpenicillin. Five proteins with Mrs of 95,000, 84,000, 80,000, 76,000, and 49,000 were detected. PBPs 1 to 4 had a high affinity for [2,3-3H]benzylpenicillin and were relatively scarce (80 to 150 molecules per cell). In contrast, PBP 5 was more abundant (600 molecules per cell) but had a low affinity for [2,3-3H]benzylpenicillin. L. monocytogenes has a relatively high natural resistance to cephalosporins. Competition experiments showed that cephalosporins bound very poorly to PBP 3 but were good inhibitors of PBPs 1, 2, and 4, which were completely blocked at concentrations well below the MIC. Analysis of a spontaneous imipenem-resistant mutant revealed that resistance was likely due to an altered PBP 3 with a reduced affinity for [2,3-3H]benzylpenicillin. These results suggest that PBP 3 is a primary lethal target for beta-lactams in L. monocytogenes.\r"

  ".W": "The pharmacokinetics and serum killing curves of amikacin, which was administered by a 30-minute intravenous infusion of single doses of 7.5 mg/kg and then 15 mg/kg, were investigated in six healthy volunteers who received the two doses in a crossover study with a washout period of 20 days. The serum killing curves were determined for four bacterial species: Escherichia coli, Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter cloacae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. All strains were serum resistant, and the bactericidal activity was analyzed by separating the early phase (first 5 h) and the late phase (24 h) of the killing curve. For the early phase, the bactericidal activity was evaluated by correlating an index of surviving bacteria with amikacin concentrations. This methodology allowed determination of two parameters: the maximal effective concentration and the lowest effective concentration. For the late phase, the threshold values separating bacteriostatic and bactericidal activities were lower than 10 mg/liter for each strain. The concentration dependence of amikacin bactericidal activity was confirmed for Escherichia coli and Enterobacter cloacae and, to a lesser extent, for Serratia marcescens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Correlation of these data with amikacin pharmacokinetic data in volunteers indicated that a daily dose of 15 mg/kg may be effective in the treatment of Escherichia coli and Enterobacter cloacae infections. For Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Serratia marcescens, the partially time-dependent activity probably necessitates two daily administrations and combination with another antibiotic.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To examine the relations among tissue plasminogen activator antigen, plasminogen activator inhibitor, the lupus anticoagulant, and anticardiolipin antibodies in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus. DESIGN--Prospective study of blood samples (a) from selected patients with systemic lupus erythematosus whose disease was and was not complicated by a history of thrombosis or recurrent abortions, or both, and (b) from a series of healthy controls with a similar age and sex distribution. SETTING--University based medical clinic. SUBJECTS--23 Patients with definite systemic lupus erythematosus (American Rheumatism Association criteria), of whom 11 (eight women) aged 26-51 had a history of thrombosis or recurrent abortions, or both, and 12 (10 women) aged 23-53 had no such history. 15 Healthy subjects (10 women) aged 25-58 served as controls. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Tissue plasminogen activator concentrations, plasminogen activator inhibitor activities, detection of the lupus anticoagulant, and values of anticardiolipin antibodies in the two groups of patients and in the patients with a history of thrombosis or abortions compared with controls. Other measurements included concentrations of proteins that are known to change during the acute phase of systemic lupus erythematosus--namely, fibrinogen, C3 and C4, and C reactive protein. RESULTS--Patients with a history of thrombosis or abortions, or both, had significantly higher values of tissue plasminogen activator and plasminogen activator inhibitor than patients with no such history. A significant correlation between tissue plasminogen activator and plasminogen activator inhibitor (r = 0.80) was found only in the patients with a history of complications of their disease. The lupus anticoagulant was detected in six of the 11 patients with a history of thrombosis or abortions when tested by measuring the activated partial thromboplastin time but was found in all 11 patients when tested by measuring the diluted activated partial thromboplastin time. Nine of these 11 patients had raised values of anticardiolipin antibodies. The findings showed no relation to the activity of the disease. CONCLUSIONS--A significant correlation between tissue plasminogen activator concentrations and plasminogen activator inhibitor activities was found only in patients whose systemic lupus erythematosus was complicated by a history of thrombosis or recurrent abortions. The findings show that these patients have raised plasminogen activator inhibitor activities, and the frequent association between these raised activities and the presence of the lupus anticoagulant suggests that the two may be linked.\r"

DESIGN--Continuing care and follow up until 31 March 1989 of all newly diagnosed diabetic patients registered at one hospital between 1 June 1981 and 31 May 1987. SETTING--Muhimbili Medical Centre, Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. SUBJECTS--1250 Newly diagnosed diabetic patients seen over a six year period. 272 (21.8%) Had diabetes requiring insulin, 825 (66.0%) diabetes not requiring insulin, and 153 (12.2%) diabetes of uncertain type. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Survival rates during each year of follow up. RESULTS--205 (16.4%) Patients were known to have died, 126 (61.5%) in hospital and 79 (38.5%) in the community. At least a further 71 patients were likely to have died. The five year survival rates (95% confidence intervals) for patients with diabetes requiring and not requiring insulin were 71% (62% to 80%) and 84% (80% to 89%) respectively for known deaths and 60% (51% to 69%) and 82% (77% to 86%) respectively for known plus probable deaths. 49 (3.9%) Patients died at the time of presentation. Severe diabetic ketoacidosis and infection were responsible for most deaths in patients with diabetes requiring insulin. Infection was responsible for 24% of deaths in patients with diabetes not requiring insulin and was the main cause of death in the group with uncertain type of diabetes. Cardiovascular and renal causes were responsible for 24% of hospital deaths of patients with diabetes not requiring insulin. Diabetes requiring insulin, young age, and ketonuria at presentation were associated with a significantly worse five year survival on multivariate analysis. On univariate analysis underweight, female sex, low educational background, and manual occupations were additional factors with a worse prognosis. CONCLUSION--Diabetes in sub-Saharan Africa is, in many patients, a serious disease with a poor prognosis. Most deaths, however, are due to preventable causes. More effort is therefore required to increase public awareness of diabetes and to improve patient detection, management, and follow up.\r"

We wanted to evaluate plasma levels of ANP and plasma volume in relation to renal ANP receptor density and affinity in rats 6 weeks after induction of diabetes. Plasma levels of immunoreactive ANP were significantly higher in hyperglycemic diabetic (75.2 +/- 8.3 pg/ml) than in control animals (34.7 +/- 8.1 pg/ml; p less than 0.01). Administration of insulin to keep diabetic rats normoglycemic normalized plasma levels of immunoreactive ANP (30.5 +/- 5.2 pg/ml). In contrast, plasma volume did not show significant differences among the groups (hyperglycemic diabetes, 46.6 +/- 3.8; normoglycemic diabetes, 42.4 +/- 3.2; controls, 43.2 +/- 2.0 ml/kg body wt). No correlation was found between plasma levels of immunoreactive ANP and plasma volume. By autoradiography a significant reduction in the number of renal cortical ANP receptors was observed in hyperglycemic diabetic rats as compared with controls. At variance, ANP receptor affinity did not change either in the cortex or in the medulla in hyperglycemic diabetics in comparison with control animals. The pathophysiological implication of cortical ANP receptor down-regulation was underscored by the blunted response of glomerular filtration rate to ANP infusion in diabetic animals as compared with controls.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Awake mongrel dogs chronically instrumented with dimension crystals, Doppler flow probes, and distal pneumatic occluders on the circumflex coronary arteries were subjected to transient 2-minute circumflex occlusions (n = 9) under constant heart rate (120 beats/min). Left ventricular end-diastolic pressure increased by 60% (from 10 +/- 1 to 16 +/- 2 mm Hg), and dP/dt decreased by 8% (from 2,048 +/- 130 to 1,885 +/- 110 mm Hg/sec); systemic hemodynamics were unaltered. Epicardial coronary diameter proximal to the site of occlusion decreased by 4.37% (from 3.62 +/- 0.25 to 3.46 +/- 0.29 mm, p less than 0.05). Constriction began 15-20 seconds after the onset of ischemia and progressed to maximum in 1-2 minutes. Combined alpha- and beta-receptor blockade (n = 8) with phentolamine (2 mg/kg) and propranolol (1 mg/kg) or cyclooxygenase inhibition (n = 5) with indomethacin (7.5 mg/kg) did not attenuate the ischemia-induced vasoconstriction response. Transient 2-minute occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery (n = 6) also elicited significant epicardial vasoconstriction in the circumflex coronary artery in the first minute (from 3.88 +/- 0.31 to 3.81 +/- 0.31 mm, p less than 0.05); the constriction was attenuated subsequently by an increase (25.5%) in circumflex flow. When left anterior descending occlusion was repeated (n = 6) with circumflex flow held constant, the ischemia-induced circumflex constriction was augmented; diameter decreased 3.7% (from 3.83 +/- 0.29 to 3.69 +/- 0.29 mm, p less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

This is a severe defect characterized by failure of conotruncal and aorticopulmonary septation of the embryonic heart tube. As a result, no separation into the aortic and pulmonary arteries occurs, and there is a common outflow tract. The hearts with persistent truncus arteriosus had a 26% greater ventricular to whole embryo weight, which indicated that the ventricles were enlarged. Both the low-threshold T-type (ICa.T) and the 1,4-dihydropyridine-sensitive L-type (ICa.L) Ca2+ currents were present in the ventricular myocytes from hearts at day 11 of incubation. However, day 11 hearts with persistent truncus arteriosus showed a twofold reduction in the peak magnitude of ICa.L at a test potential of + 10 mV without a concomitant reduction in the number of L channels detected by 1,4-dihydropyridine antagonist [(+)[3H]PN200-110] and agonist (Bay K 8644) receptor binding. The results indicated that an L channel regulatory mechanism other than protein synthesis was affected. These changes are consistent with responses to conditions of excessive hemodynamic burden that have been characterized in adult hearts.\r"

Isolated rat heart was preperfused in the presence of 1.4 microM liposome-bound fatty acid binding protein for 15 minutes, followed by 30 minutes of ischemia and 30 minutes of reperfusion. Our results indicated better preservation of myocardial high-energy phosphate compounds (including ATP and creatine phosphate), reduced creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase release from the heart, and improved coronary flow in hearts treated with fatty acid binding protein compared with untreated controls. Fatty acid binding protein enhanced reacylation of arachidonic acid into phospholipids, thereby preserving membrane phospholipids and reducing free fatty acid contents during ischemia and reperfusion. In addition, fatty acid binding protein-bound long-chain free fatty acids and their thioesters as well as carnitine esters were increased in the cytosolic compartment of the heart. These results suggest that fatty acid binding protein may be used as a possible therapeutic agent to improve myocardial function during reperfusion of ischemic heart.\r"

  ".W": "The positive inotropic response to angiotensin I and II in cardiac tissue of most mammalian species, as well as the exact site in the heart for conversion of local and systemic angiotensin I into angiotensin II, remains to be elucidated. In isolated cat papillary muscles, angiotensin I and angiotensin II (0.1 nM to 1 microM, 35 degrees C, 1.25 mM Ca2+) increased, in a dose-dependent manner, peak twitch tension with typical slight prolongation of twitch duration. This typical response did not necessitate the presence of an intact endocardial endothelium (EE), as a similar response was observed in muscles where the EE had been damaged by a 1-second exposure to 0.5% Triton X-100. After addition of captopril, an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, the positive inotropic response to angiotensin I was completely abolished, both in the presence and the absence of an intact EE. Hence, the heart possesses angiotensin converting enzyme, which mediates the positive inotropic response to angiotensin I. An intact EE was not a prerequisite for this response; thus, myocytes as well as nonmyocytes may be possible locations (in addition to the EE) for angiotensin converting enzyme. In the presence of an intact EE, and after addition of captopril, the positive inotropic response to angiotensin II was significantly diminished (desensitization). By contrast, in the absence of an intact EE, but also after addition of captopril, the positive response to angiotensin II was potentiated (sensitization). Both desensitization and sensitization (in the presence or absence of an intact EE, respectively) of the response to angiotensin II induced by the addition of captopril were inhibited by indomethacin, a cyclooxygenase inhibitor, suggesting a role for prostaglandins.\r"

Serum PGI2 half-life and total serum Apo A-I levels were lower in the CAD group than in the control group. PGI2 was least stable in patients with unstable angina and the acute phase of myocardial infarction. In these patients, the molar ratio of Apo A-I to Apo A-II and HDL-associated Apo A-I levels were decreased, and free Apo A-I levels were increased. After in vitro incubation of HDL with increasing amounts of Apo A-II, Apo A-I in HDL was displaced by Apo A-II, with the parallel decrease in stability of PGI2. Free Apo A-I cannot stabilize PGI2. HDL-associated Apo A-I, whose amount is affected by Apo A-II, stabilized PGI2 and correlated well with stability of PGI2 in patients with CAD and control patients. Decreased PGI2 half-life may play an important role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and thrombus formation in the coronary arteries, especially thrombus formation during an acute coronary event.\r"

  ".W": "Plasma cross-linked fibrin-degradation products were analyzed using a D-dimer (DD) immunoassay in patients with deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or acute myocardial infarction (MI) treated with fibrinolytic therapy, and the results were correlated with clot lysis documented angiographically. In 13 patients with DVT, the mean DD concentration increased 10-fold (1,074 +/- 252 to 10,333 +/- 1,004 ng/ml) during therapy, but neither the peak level nor the DD concentration integrated over the course of therapy correlated with clot lysis. Since plasma DD can derive from degradation of soluble plasma fibrin as well as from thrombi, the contribution of the former was estimated by in vitro incubation of the pretreatment plasma with plasminogen activator. Subtraction of this value from the measured posttreatment DD concentration provided a \"corrected\" level that represented DD originating from lysis of thrombi. This modification resulted in improved correlation of DD levels with clot lysis. The mean corrected peak DD was higher in patients with successful thrombolysis (8,780 +/- 1,352 ng/ml) compared with patients without lysis (3,075 +/- 589 ng/ml, p less than 0.001). There was a moderate correlation between the volume of clot lysed and the corrected peak DD (r = 0.62) and a higher correlation with the corrected DD integrated over the course of treatment (r = 0.97). By contrast, the corrected DD concentrations were near zero in patients treated for MI with or without thrombolytic reperfusion, suggesting that fibrin in small coronary thrombi did not contribute significantly to total plasma DD during therapy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "In rats, atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) reduces sympathetic nerve activity (SNA) reflexively by sensitizing cardiac mechanoreceptors with inhibitory vagal afferents. We performed three series of experiments in 26 normal young men to document whether ANF inhibits SNA in humans and if so, to determine potential mechanisms for this phenomenon. First, we recorded muscle SNA before and during brief infusions of ANF, vehicle (saline solution), and sodium nitroprusside, titrated to achieve reductions similar to those produced by ANF in diastolic pressure and central venous pressure, and we also assessed the effect of ANF on sympathetic nerve responses to a cold pressor test (CPT). Second, we determined the effect of ANF on Doppler-derived measurements of cardiac output and responses to hypotensive (-40 mm Hg) lower-body negative pressure (LBNP) and its sudden cessation. Third, we applied nonhypotensive (-15 mm Hg) LBNP to selectively unload cardiopulmonary baroreceptors, and we released LBNP to stimulate these inhibitory afferents during sequential infusions of nitroglycerin, vehicle (saline solution), and ANF. Our key findings were that 1) reductions in arterial and central venous pressures during ANF infusion were not accompanied by anticipated reflex increases in muscle SNA; 2) ANF blunted the increase in SNA with CPT; 3) ANF increased stroke volume and cardiac output; and 4) sympathoneural responses to both the application and the sudden cessation of nonhypotensive LBNP were attenuated, not augmented, by ANF. Changes in plasma norepinephrine concentrations reflected these sympathetic nerve responses to ANF. These results do not support the concept that ANF inhibits sympathetic outflow reflexively in humans by increasing discharge from cardiac mechanoreceptors with inhibitory vagal afferents but are consistent with either a central or a ganglionic sympathoinhibitory action of ANF. ANF could facilitate hypotension and natriuresis in humans by attenuating the reflex sympathetic response to baroreceptor deactivation.\r"

  ".W": "Previous in vivo studies have shown that vasopressin, which releases the endothelium-derived relaxing factor and constricts coronary smooth muscle, produces augmented constriction of coronary microvessels perfused by mature collaterals. We hypothesized that chronic perfusion through collaterals produces endothelial dysfunction in the recipient vasculature. Mature collaterals were stimulated in mongrel dogs by the ameroid constrictor technique. After 3-6 months, rings of conduit vessels (obtuse marginals) were studied in organ chambers, and coronary microvessels (100-220 microns) were studied in a pressurized, no-flow state with a microvessel imaging apparatus. Eleven dogs were used as controls. Large vessels were preconstricted with prostaglandin F2 alpha to 30-70% of the maximum potassium chloride tension, and microvessels were preconstricted to 20-60% of the baseline diameter with the thromboxane mimetic U46619. Relaxations to the receptor-mediated agents acetylcholine and ADP were markedly impaired in collateral-dependent coronary microvessels, whereas relaxations to nitroglycerin were enhanced compared with microvessels from control dogs. Relaxation to the calcium ionophore A23187, which releases the endothelium-derived relaxing factor through nonreceptor-mediated mechanisms, were similar in control and ameroid microvessels. Constriction to vasopressin was augmented in collateral-dependent microvessels compared with controls. Responses to all agonists were similar between control and collateral-dependent large vascular rings. In conclusion, chronic perfusion through collateral vessels selectively impairs receptor-mediated endothelium-dependent relaxations and augments constriction to vasopressin in the coronary microcirculation. These findings may have important implications regarding neurohumoral regulation of perfusion to collateral-dependent myocardium.\r"

First, the reaction mixture was chromatographed on a column containing Sepharose linked to the peptide that had been used as immunogen for antibody 59D8; scu-PA-59D8 Fab' conjugate and unconjugated 59D8 Fab' were retained but not unconjugated scu-PA. Then, the eluate from the peptide-Sepharose column was chromatographed on a column containing Sepharose linked to benzamidine, which acts as a ligand for two-chain urokinase. The molecular weight of the scu-PA-59D8 Fab' conjugate was approximately 100 kDa when electrophoresed on a nonreducing sodium dodecylsulfate-polyacrylamide gel. Enzymatic assay after purification revealed that more than 97% of the scu-PA present in the conjugate retained the single-chain form. The Fab' portion of the conjugate functioned in a manner indistinguishable from that of native antibody 59D8. In an in vitro assay for lysis of fibrin monomer, the fibrinolytic potency of scu-PA-59D8 Fab' was 33-fold more than that of tissue plasminogen activator (p less than 0.001), 230-fold more than that of unconjugated scu-PA (p less than 0.0001), and 420-fold more than that of urokinase (p less than 0.0001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

ANOVA analysis indicated significant differences between subjects for all Cmax/dose and AUC/dose measurements. No significant difference between doses were noted for these parameters except for AUC/dose for 1,3-glyceryl dinitrate. The ratio of metabolites (1,2-metabolite/1,3-metabolite) for the 0.4 mg dose was significantly different from the ratios for the doses of 1.6 mg or higher. Measurements of the combined residence time parameter suggest nonlinearity in nitroglycerin absorption and metabolism processes of AUMC/AUC between the 0.4 and the 13 mg doses. Consistent results were observed in the AUC ratios of metabolites for 0.4 mg doses of nitroglycerin between oral and sublingual administrations, suggesting that the increased metabolite ratio noted for sublingual nitroglycerin may reflect differences in dose, rather than differences in route of administration.\r"

Interstitial fluid penetration was studied by the suction-induced blister technique. Fleroxacin and its two major metabolites, N-demethyl and N-oxide, were analyzed in plasma and urine by HPLC. Single-dose absorption parameters (absorption rate constant, normalized peak plasma drug concentration, and time to reach peak concentration) and total urinary excretion indicated that fleroxacin was absorbed more slowly and more completely in patients with cystic fibrosis than in control subjects. Fleroxacin volume of distribution tended to be smaller in patients with cystic fibrosis and it reached statistical significance after a single dose when normalization for lean body mass was applied. When normalized for lean body mass, the formation clearance of N-demethyl fleroxacin and N-oxide fleroxacin was significantly greater in patients with cystic fibrosis than in control subjects (p less than 0.05). These data concur with those of others showing an induction of drug-metabolizing enzymes in cystic fibrosis. Renal clearances of fleroxacin and its metabolites were significantly increased in cystic fibrosis (p less than 0.05), and this seems to be explained by a decreased tubular reabsorption of these compounds. The differences seen in the pharmacokinetics of fleroxacin in cystic fibrosis support the theories of generalized induction of drug metabolism and of a defective renal tubular reabsorptive process of drugs in cystic fibrosis.\r"

Drug levels were determined by HPLC in plasma, cerebrospinal fluid, and urine after administration of the drugs either intravenously or as an oral liquid given with antacid. ddA was metabolized rapidly and quantitatively to ddI to such an extent that ddA was undetectable in the plasma even during continuous intravenous administration of ddA. The plasma kinetics of ddI were generally monoexponential and were characterized by a half-life of 38 minutes. This probably does not accurately reflect the kinetics of the active species of ddI, which appears to be 2',3'-dideoxyadenosine triphosphate, formed intracellularly. Oral bioavailability was 38% for oral liquid given with antacid. The total body clearance averaged 1.00 L/kg/hr, with a volume of distribution of 1.01 L/kg. Approximately 36% of the intravenous dose could be recovered unchanged in the urine. The level of ddI in the cerebrospinal fluid 1 hour after drug infusion averaged 21% of that of the simultaneous plasma level. It is concluded that ddI has pharmacokinetic properties that are amenable to its clinical use.\r"

The P(v-a)CO2 gradient in this group was 9 +/- 1 compared with 4 +/- 1 torr in 18 patients with a normal P(v-a)CO2 gradient (p less than .001) (normocarbic group). PvCO2 was 41 +/- 2 torr in the hypercarbic group compared with 35 +/- 2 torr in the normocarbic group (p less than .05). No difference was noted in PaCO2. Venous arterial pH and HCO3- gradients were of greater magnitude in the hypercarbic group, -0.05 +/- 0.003 and 2.4 +/- 0.3 mEq/L compared to -0.02 +/- 0.004 (p less than .001) and 1.1 +/- 0.2 mEq/L (p less than .001), respectively. CI in the hypercarbic group was 2.3 +/- 0.2 compared to 3.0 +/- 0.2 L/min.m2 in the normocarbic group (p less than .05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The infants were part of a larger double-blind national study. Birth weight ranged from 0.88 to 1.55 kg, and gestational age was between 27 to 32 wk. There were six infants in the surfactant group and nine in the placebo group. Pulmonary mechanics were studied before and at 2, 24, 60, and 96 h after surfactant or sham instillation using a pneumotachometer and an esophageal balloon catheter. The variables studied were dynamic compliance (Cdyn), pulmonary resistance, work of breathing, tidal volume, and minute ventilation. Infants in the surfactant group showed an immediate and significant (p less than .05) improvement in gas exchange ratio, decreased mean airway pressure (9.7 +/- 0.9 to 7.9 +/- 0.4 cm H2O) and airway resistance (133 +/- 6.3 to 92 +/- 14.9 cm H2O/L.sec) (p less than .05). Changes in Cdyn were noted only at 24 h after surfactant instillation. In the control group, gradual improvement occurred after the initial deterioration. The findings suggest that the immediate improvement in oxygenation after surfactant instillation is the result of factors other than changes in lung compliance, such as improved ventilation/perfusion and better capillary stability with decreased leakage of fluid into alveoli.\r"

We tested the hypothesis that glucose protects the gastric mucosa by direct repletion of glycogen stores. We compared the effects of enteral glucose with enteral lipids in the rat restraint model. The rats were given equal volumes of 0.9% saline, 20% lipids, or 25% glucose during a 4-h period of restraint stress. The effects of each treatment on gastric residual volume and luminal pH, as well as on stress lesion formation were measured. Both enteral nutrients significantly reduced the number of mucosal lesions compared to saline. In conjunction with their protective effect, both nutrients significantly increased both gastric residual volume and luminal pH. As stress-induced prolonged gastric contractions are related to mucosal injury in this model, the nutrient solutions may have been protective in part because they increased gastric volume and prevented mechanical trauma to the mucosa. We conclude that tube feedings do not prevent stress ulceration by glucose's repletion of local glycogen stores, as lipids and glucose were equally effective. Both increased intragastric volume and increased intraluminal pH associated with administration of enteral nutrients may contribute to their protection of the gastric mucosa from stress ulceration.\r"

Portal hypertension was produced in male Sprague-Dawley rats by two-stage ligation of the portal vein. Sham-operated rats were used as controls. Two weeks later, intestinal injury was produced by in vivo perfusion with 5 mM chenodeoxycholic acid for 30 min. Intestinal injury was assessed by quantitative morphometry and by measuring intestinal water and mannitol absorption. Portal hypertension resulted in more injury in the distal perfused intestine as manifested by increased villus tip denudation [portal hypertensive 52.5 +/- 9.6 (SEM) vs controls 28.1 +/- 5.7 microns, P = 0.05). Additionally there was a significant decrease in the unperfused duodenal villus height in portal hypertensive rats (portal hypertensive 755 +/- 22 vs controls 848 +/- 28 microns, P less than 0.02). Portal hypertension had no significant effect on the increase in mannitol absorption or water secretion caused by chenodeoxycholic acid perfusion. This study suggests that portal hypertension alters small intestinal mucosa and increases susceptibility to injury.\r"

Patients who had CBZ removed had a significant increase in seizures that was maintained for 4 weeks after the end of drug reduction, and 10 of these 23 patients had to restart therapy with CBZ. There was no significant change in seizure numbers in the other groups. Two patients discontinued from VPA had to restart the drug; none had to restart PHT.

He developed high titers of antinuclear antibodies (ANA) and anti-DNA antibodies, and hypocomplementemia.

The second patient, a 28-year-old woman, had been followed for idiopathic leukopenia for 3 years and had previously experienced fever and lymphadenopathy from PHT. After 4 months of divalproex therapy, she developed confusion, joint pain, and a dramatic increase in seizure frequency. She also developed high titers of ANA and anti-DNA antibodies and hypocomplementemia, along with a further decrease in white blood cell (WBC) count. These responded to steroid therapy and withdrawal of divalproex. Three months later, reintroduction of divalproex was followed by a return of ANA in low titer, which resolved after discontinuation. We believe that VPA may have caused true SLE in these patients, one of whom was probably predisposed.\r"

Mean total and free carnitine levels were significantly lower in patients with polytherapy; acylcarnitine was significantly higher for VPA monotherapy and the ratio of acyl- to free carnitine was significantly higher in all patients receiving VPA. Ammonia, uric acid, and bilirubin were the only tests selectively impaired with VPA. A significant correlation was found between serum ammonia and VPA dosage. Glucose, beta-lipoproteins, triglycerides, acetacetate, and beta-hydroxybutyrate were unchanged in the four groups. Sex and age appeared to interact with total and free carnitine values. Adverse drug reactions were apparently unrelated to carnitine metabolism impairment. Only a few patients had abnormal carnitine values.

  ".W": "Changes in acid-base balance have a major influence on ion transport in the ileum. The goals of the present study were to delineate (a) the specific transport processes most affected by changes in acid-base metabolism, (b) the individual roles of pH, PCO2, and concentration of HCO3- in modulating ion transport, and (c) the relationship between acid-base sensitive and other ion-transport systems. Ion transport and electrical parameters were measured in rabbit ilea in vitro under short-circuit conditions with systematic variations of pH, PCO2, and concentrations of HCO3-. Increasing HCO3- concentrations, with constant PCO2 and increasing pH, caused a decrease in electroneutral Na+ and Cl- absorption. At 5 mmol/L HCO3-, net fluxes of Na+ and Cl- were 5.9 +/- 1.4 and 4.5 +/- 1.1 microEq.cm-2.h-1, while at 50 mmol/L HCO3-, net Na+ and Cl- fluxes were 0.7 +/- 0.7 and 0.2 +/- 0.6 microEq.cm-2.h-1. Transepithelial HCO3(-)-gradient experiments suggested that serosal HCO3- was the principal factor. Changes in PCO2 showed a complex biphasic response, increasing net Cl- flux as PCO2 increased from 11-30 mm Hg in 5 mmol/L HCO3-; net Na+ flux increased as PCO2 was changed from 36 to greater than 100 mm Hg in 22 mmol/L HCO3-. In contrast, increasing pH in a bicarbonate-free N-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-N'-2 = ethane sulfonic acid buffer did not significantly alter Na+ transport. Acid-base stimulated Na+ absorption was inhibited by 10(-3) mol/L amiloride, but not by bumetanide, consistent with the involvement of Na(+)-H+ exchange rather than Na(+)-Cl- cotransport. Epinephrine did not increase Na+ absorption under acid-base stimulated conditions, but glucose did, suggesting that the rate-limiting step for electroneutral absorptive processes under these conditions occurs at the apical rather than the basolateral membrane. Combining all experiments, a significant correlation existed between net flux of Na+ and HCO3- concentration (r = -0.72, P less than 0.05) and between net flux of Na+ and pH (r = -0.68, P less than 0.01). Chloride absorption was correlated with pH (r = 0.72, P less than 0.01). These results suggest a profound regulatory role for acid-base balance in electroneutral Na(+)-Cl- transport in rabbit ileum in vitro.\r"

Forty-one subjects underwent a gastric intubation. Pentagastrin (6 micrograms.kg-1.h-1 IV) significantly increased gastric lipase concentration and output. Stimulated gastric lipase output in seven normal subjects was 12,598 +/- 2036 U/h (by using tributyrin as substrate). Outputs where higher (P less than 0.02) in 17 patients with pancreatic insufficiency who were not drinking alcohol, but were not significantly different in nine patients who continued to drink (20,413 +/- 1778 U/h and 21,953 +/- 4973 U/h, respectively). On the other hand, high gastric lipase outputs were found in eight patients with duodenal ulcers and no evidence of pancreatic dysfunction (23,180 +/- 262 U/h). The time required to reach maximal lipase output (peak output) following pentagastrin stimulation was the same in all groups (approximately 38 minutes) except for the group of patients with pancreatic insufficiency who did not drink alcohol, in whom it was significantly reduced (approximately 26.5 minutes). Secretory patterns of gastric lipase and pepsin were closely comparable. Gastric lipase secretion could be increased in several clinical conditions and particularly in patients with pancreatic insufficiency caused by alcoholic chronic pancreatitis who have been abstinent for a long time.\r"

  ".W": "Receptor-dependent and -independent regulation of gastrin secretion from cultured human antral G cells was investigated. Human antral mucosal cell preparations that were enriched for G cells were obtained by sequential incubations with collagenase and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, centrifugal elutriation, and short-term culture. After a 2-day incubation period, gastrin- and somatostatin-containing cells accounted for 15% and 5%, respectively, of the total adhered-cell population. Forskolin, A23187, and beta-phorbol 12 myristate 13-acetate stimulated basal gastrin secretion from cultured human G cells in a concentration-dependent fashion. These results indicate that gastrin release could be mediated by elevations in cytosolic cyclic adenosine monophosphate levels, calcium influx, or activation of protein kinase C. A direct stimulatory role for bombesin- and gastrin-releasing peptide was supported by experiments showing concentration-dependent enhancement of gastrin release by bombesin from 0.01 fmol/L to 10 nmol/L. The putative bombesin antagonist [Leu13-psi-CH2NH-Leu14] bombesin augmented basal gastrin levels by itself and produced weak inhibition of bombesin-induced gastrin secretion from human antral G cells. Somatostatin potently suppressed forskolin- and bombesin-mediated gastrin release but did not significantly alter basal gastrin levels. These results suggest that bombesin and somatostatin directly activate and inhibit G-cell function via specific and sensitive receptors. Furthermore, the adenylate cyclase and phosphatidyl inositide second messenger systems seem to be intracellular mediators of gastrin secretion from human antral G cells.\r"

This study was designed to determine if enprostil protected against alcohol damage. A double-blind, randomized, cross-over study was performed on eight healthy adult men. After an overnight fast, a gastroscope was inserted and the antral mucosa was sprayed with a 10-mL test solution containing either enprostil (70 micrograms) or its vehicle (control). After 15 minutes, mucosal injury was scored (0-5), and the mucosa was sprayed with 100 mL 80% ethanol. Mucosal injury was scored after a further 15, 20, 25, and 30 minutes. The entire experiment was recorded on video film, which a second endoscopist used to score the damage independently. The two experiments were separated by an interval of 1 week. There was close agreement between the two endoscopists (r = 0.9385), and their scores were averaged. Using Friedman's two-way analysis of variance, a highly significant (P less than 0.00004) increase in injury was demonstrated following enprostil pretreatment. The Wilcoxin signed rank test showed the differences to be significant (P less than 0.05) at every time point. We conclude that enprostil, rather than protecting the human antral mucosa from alcohol injury, appears to potentiate this injury and may itself be damaging in therapeutic concentrations. This unexpected result cannot yet be explained but demands caution in the clinical use of enprostil.\r"

Blood samples were also taken simultaneously from the pulmonary vein and the pulmonary capillary bed, as well as from the pulmonary artery and the left atrium, in 25 patients (11 control subjects, 5 patients with mitral stenosis and 9 patients with atrial septal defect). There was no difference in plasma atrial natriuretic polypeptide levels between the pulmonary capillary bed and the pulmonary vein in these 25 patients.

Accordingly, considerable interest exists to develop immunotherapeutic or immunoprophylactic agents for this pathogen. In vitro as well as in vivo studies in animal models have demonstrated that LPS serotype-specific antibodies against P. aeruginosa confer protection. Thus, cell wall-derived LPS P. aeruginosa vaccines have been developed for active immunization. Toxic side effects from LPS and relatively slow immune response to active immunization in patients needing rapid protection have led to the development of high-titered anti-P. aeruginosa immunoglobulin G preparations. Passive immunotherapy with these polyclonal antibody preparations has shown promising results in animal models and in clinical pilot studies. More recently, murine and human monoclonal antibodies against P. aeruginosa have been developed. These preparations offer the potential advantage over polyclonal globulin preparations of low protein dosages and virtually unlimited supply.\r"

The de novo synthesis and secretion of plasma proteins characteristic for differentiated primate hepatocytes were sustained under these culture conditions. Immunocytochemical staining for a non-A, non-B hepatitis-associated antigen revealed expression of this cytoplasmic marker during the culture period, indicating a persistence of the infection in vitro. Tissue culture medium derived from the hepatocyte cultures was used to inoculate a nonimmune chimpanzee. The animal subsequently displayed an increase in the serum levels of alanine aminotransferase, the development of histopathologic alterations indicative of viral hepatitis, and the appearance of liver cell cytoplasmic tubules diagnostic for non-A, non-B hepatitis. Concentrated tissue culture medium examined by electron microscopy contained virus-like particles with an average diameter of 39-46 nm, which exhibited an envelope and inner 37-nm core structure.\r"

The combination of anti-TNF monoclonal antibody and oral ciprofloxacin at a suboptimal dose of 2.5 mg/kg/day resulted in a 100% survival rate in neutropenic animals (16/16), while ciprofloxacin alone produced only a 67% survival rate (10/15) during the 7-day period of neutropenia (P less than .05).

Since the kinetics of killing by these agents differ and each may influence the outcome of the other, it is difficult to evaluate combination effects in vitro. Conditions were developed to measure killing of group B streptococci (GBS), type III strain M732, by an opsonic mixture with IVIG, fresh serum, and human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNL) with or without penicillin. Bacterial killing was observed with the opsonic IVIG mixture, penicillin, and the opsonic IVIG mixture plus penicillin at 1 h. The effect of the combination was greater than the sum of the effects of two separate incubations. The enhanced killing was evident for up to 18 h. By 24 h, the killing by the combination was no greater than that by penicillin alone. A similar pattern of GBS killing was observed with cord blood PMNL, six different GBS type III strains, and pretreatment of GBS with either IVIG or penicillin. These effects suggest that the combination of IVIG and penicillin has potential for use in the treatment of neonatal GBS infections.\r"

Blastogenesis and production of interleukin-2 (IL-2) by peripheral blood mononuclear cells showed a significant correlation when streptolysin O but not when soluble worm antigenic preparation (SWAP) was used as stimulus. This suggested independent regulation of these responses to SWAP. Thirteen subjects showed SWAP-restricted suppression of blastogenesis but not IL-2 production by adherent cells. Compared with 24 other S. mansoni-infected subjects, they had depressed blastogenic responses to SWAP but comparable SWAP-induced IL-2 production and responsiveness to exogenous IL-2. This study indicates that IL-2 production is not the site of action of parasite antigen-restricted suppressor adherent cells in chronic S. mansoni infection.\r"

While acute exposure to 5 mM Li was without effect, 10 mM, 25 mM and 50 mM Li significantly decreased AVP-stimulated cAMP formation. In contrast, cells grown in 5 mM Li for 72 hours which caused no morphologic changes enhanced cAMP formation (fmol/microgram protein) in response to both 10 nM AVP (114.5 +/- 9.2 vs. 71.6 +/- 7.4, P less than 0.005) and 100 nM AVP (182 +/- 14 vs. 120 +/- 8.3, P less than 0.001), N = 16. A similar enhancement was observed when cAMP formation was stimulated by a post-receptor agonist, cholera toxin. The role of eicosanoids was examined with 5 microM meclofenamate which reversed Li-enhanced cAMP formation in response to both AVP and cholera toxin. To define the eicosanoid responsible, cyclooxygenase products were measured. Prostaglandin E2 and thromboxane B2 synthesis were unchanged by Li, but the production of prostacyclin was significantly (P less than 0.02) increased. Prostacyclin (3 microM) mimicked the effect of Li to enhance the response to 10 nM AVP as cAMP levels increased from 100 +/- 11 to 173 +/- 13, P less than 0.05. The experiments suggest that acute exposure of Li at concentrations of 10 mM or greater inhibit cAMP formation but prolonged Li exposure enhances cAMP formation by increasing the formation of prostacyclin.\r"

In contrast to these delayed effects, coincubation of PMO with S. epidermidis resulted in a significant increase in both LTB4 and LTC4 synthesis above that of controls, with 6.33 +/- 1.20 ng LTB4/10(6) cells (P less than 0.01) and 2.06 +/- 0.68 ng LTC4/10(6) cells (P = 0.014) being generated by three hours. The generation of these lipoxygenase products was both time and dose dependent, and the rapid production and release of the potently chemotactic LTB4 is consistent with the observed clinical response, where a rapid influx of PMN into the peritoneal cavity occurs during episodes of peritonitis, while the generation of LTC4 may contribute to the hyperemia and interstitial edema. In contrast, although there was a time dependent rise in cyclooxygenase product generation by unstimulated cells, a dose dependent inhibition of synthesis was clearly demonstrated when cells were incubated with bacteria, with a mean 40% reduction in generation of PGE2 and a mean 34% reduction in TXB2 generation (P = 0.01 and P less than 0.025, respectively). It was demonstrated that the inhibition was not due to lack of available substrate and that the generation of eicosanoids was unrelated to phagocytosis, bacterial/PMO contact or bacterial surface characteristics. Instead, the observed effect of S. epidermidis on the PMO was attributable to a secreted bacterial product.\r"

The effect of cyclosporin A treatment on rat liver phosphoenolpyruvate-carboxykinase and hepatocyte glycogen synthetase and phosphorylase activity was therefore investigated. Glycogen synthetase (total enzyme activity and the active I-form) was elevated in hepatocytes of rats undergoing immunosuppressive treatment with cyclosporin A. Glycogen phosphorylase activity showed no difference compared to hepatocytes from control rats. Activity of phosphoenolpyruvate-carboxykinase in liver homogenates was significantly enhanced after cyclosporin A treatment. Thus, it appears that cyclosporin A treatment stimulates gluconeogenesis, and glucose is used as substrate for glycogen synthesis in vitro. Differences of in vitro and in vivo experiments might be explained by long-term induction of phosphoenolpyruvate-carboxykinase and the short-term effects of cyclosporin A on glycogen synthetase.\r"

  ".W": "Hemodialysis (HD) patients have a high incidence of hyperlipidemia. Hypertriglyceridemia is the most frequent abnormality encountered. It results mainly from a defect in the degradation of triglycerides. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of a fish oil (Max-EPA) rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), such as eicosapantenoic acid (EPA), on lipid abnormalities of hemodialysis patients. Thirteen hyperlipidemic HD patients were investigated (7 males, 6 females; mean age 57 years; mean duration of HD 72 months). None were diabetic or treated with antihypertensive drugs. All patients had hypertriglyceridemia (greater than 200 mg/dl) and an increase (greater than 1) in the ratio of serum apolipoprotein B to serum apolipoprotein A1 (ApoB/ApoA1). They received for one month, 6 g/day of Max-EPA providing 1 g of EPA. After treatment, serum triglyceride levels fell by 38% from 231 +/- 40 (SD) mg/dl to 140 +/- 38 mg/dl (P less than 0.01). Total cholesterol did not change significantly (before therapy 241 +/- 33 mg/dl, after therapy 249 +/- 38 mg/dl). Apolipoprotein A1 levels (116 +/- 17 mg/dl) were not modified after therapy, 117 +/- 11 mg/dl. Apolipoprotein B decreased significantly from 182 +/- 26 mg/dl to 150 +/- 21 mg/dl after treatment (P less than 0.01). The ApoB/ApoA1 ratio showed a significant decrease from 1.56 +/- 0.26 to 1.3 +/- 0.16 after therapy (P less than 0.01). Also, the greatest reductions were found in the patients who had both the highest serum triglyceride levels and the highest ApoB/ApoA1 ratios. No side effects were observed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "90265064\r", 
  ".W": "Several lines of evidence suggest that tyrosine formation is impaired in renal failure. The concentration of tyrosine is decreased and the phenylalanine/tyrosine ratio is increased in plasma and in skeletal muscle cells. After an oral or intravenous load, the rise of plasma phenylalanine is augmented, the clearance is decreased, oxidation is diminished and the corresponding rise of plasma tyrosine level is blunted. Tyrosine elimination and oxidation are not altered in uremia. The defect in tyrosine formation may be especially important in uremic patients on a low protein diet supplemented with tyrosine-free essential amino acid preparations and in subjects on artificial nutritional support. Thus, tyrosine should be regarded as a conditionally essential amino acid in renal failure and should be supplied exogenously, at least in these patient groups. Oral tyrosine supplementation was shown to replete plasma and intracellular pools and improve nitrogen balance in chronic renal failure patients on a low protein diet. However, because of poor solubility in aqueous solutions, tyrosine cannot be included in the free form in amino acid solutions for parenteral nutrition. To circumvent stability or solubility problems, tyrosine containing dipeptides and/or N-acetyl-tyrosine may serve as tyrosine sources for parenteral supply. Renal failure does not affect alanyl-tyrosine hydrolysis, and there is an immediate increase of plasma tyrosine concentration after peptide infusion. Elimination and hydrolysis of glycine-tyrosine is retarded in renal failure, but the clearance exceeds clinically relevant infusion rates. After infusion of N-acetyl-tyrosine, no increase in plasma tyrosine is seen, and the half-life N-acetyl-tyrosine is grossly prolonged in uremia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "90265065\r", 
  ".W": "Of the total pool of muscle free intracellular amino acids, glutamine represents about 60%. During catabolic stress, a marked reduction (50%) of this pool occurs; the depletion is not reversible by nutrition or other therapeutical endeavors. Since free glutamine is unstable in solutions, the question is whether maintenance of this pool and improvement of the nitrogen economy is feasible by intravenous provision of synthetic, stable glutamine-containing dipeptides. In vivo studies in man and animals provide firm evidence that a synthetic glutamine containing dipeptide, L-alanyl-L-glutamine (Ala-Gln), is readily hydrolyzed following intravenous administration. The results also indicate a safe and efficient use of Ala-Gln as a source of free glutamine for parenteral nutrition. In clinical studies, nitrogen balance was more positive in catabolic patients receiving a peptide supplemented solution as compared with control patients given isonitrogenous, isoenergetic TPN. Preoperative muscle glutamine concentrations were essentially maintained in the peptide group and markedly decreased in the control group. It is inferred that the increased intestinal requirement of metabolic fuel during catabolic stress is matched by an enhanced demand on muscle glutamine, resulting in intracellular glutamine depletion. Thus, the delivery of adequate amounts of glutamine is essential to maintain the integrity of intestinal mucosa, to preserve the muscle glutamine pool, and to improve overall nitrogen economy during conditions of stress.\r"

The levels in 47 patients were a median of 2.5 times higher than those in controls matched for age and sex (240 [range 25-1245] vs 97 [7-1040] mg/l). Among patients with familial hypercholesterolaemia apo(a) levels were higher in those with (n = 48) than in those without (n = 72) ischaemic heart disease (283 [18-1245] vs 144 [7-741] mg/l); both in univariate and multivariate analysis serum apo(a) was the most significant variable distinguishing between the groups. Despite reducing LDL cholesterol by 30%, treatment with cholestyramine or pravastatin did not reduce apo(a) levels in these patients. These findings support the concept that apo(a) concentration is a genetic trait predisposing to ischaemic heart disease and imply that it may be useful in the identification of familial hypercholesterolaemia patients at high risk of coronary disease.\r"

However, the capacity of this seemingly innocuous agent to produce acute renal failure is not well recognized. We report herein the clinical course of 8 cases of mannitol-induced acute renal failure. In addition, we reviewed all previously reported cases of mannitol-induced renal failure. In the present series, acute oliguric renal failure developed within 3.5 +/- 1.1 (mean +/- SD) days after receiving daily and total mannitol doses of 189 +/- 64 g and 626 +/- 270 g, respectively, over 3.5 +/- 1.5 days. The peak serum creatinine was 5.7 +/- 2.7 mg/dl and peak osmolal gap was 74 +/- 39 mOsm/kg water. Renal tubular epithelial cells containing vacuoles were seen in the urinary sediments of 6 patients. Renal function improved rapidly upon discontinuation of mannitol and/or removal of mannitol by hemodialysis. In those previously reported cases in which the baseline renal function was normal, acute renal failure developed after receiving total mannitol doses of 1171 +/- 376 g. The peak osmolal gap was 107 +/- 17. In contrast, in those with underlying renal compromise, renal function worsened after a total mannitol dose of 295 +/- 143 g. The pathogenesis of mannitol-induced renal failure is not yet established but may be associated with renal vasoconstriction produced by high concentrations of mannitol. This may be averted in clinical practice by monitoring the osmolal gap, rather than serum osmolality alone, when using mannitol infusions for the treatment of intracranial hypertension.\r"

In addition, we used the formalin-formic acid procedure on brains from mice infected with the virus of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. Formic acid proved superior to phenol in respect to both disinfection and tissue preservation, almost completely eliminating virus infectivity in sections that were histologically indistinguishable from formalin-fixed material. The inclusion of a formic acid step in routine formaldehyde tissue fixation will thus provide histologic sections of excellent quality, and virtually eliminate the risk of handling infectious material in the subsequent neuropathologic processing of tissues from patients with CJD.\r"

The NFTs were immunoreactive with both antibodies, but staining for tau was more pronounced. As identified by this reactivity, all the Guamanian ALS and PD cases examined showed spinal cord NFTs. The posterior horn had the most and the anterior horn the least. In the posterior horn the NFTs were located mainly in the marginal areas. Large anterior horn cells showed few, if any, NFTs. In addition to perikaryal NFTs, we observed tau-reactive neurites. Our results provide evidence that spinal cord NFTs are not uncommon in Guamanian ALS and PD on Guam and that they are more numerous than previously found with conventional methods.\r"

We describe our experience with 5 infants under 1 year of age with malignant partial seizures and deteriorating developmental status. All were experiencing frequent daily seizures that did not respond to 1st-line antiepileptic medications at high therapeutic serum levels and considerable medication toxicity. Three infants had complete resection of epileptic tissue (frontal corticectomy and prefrontal lobectomy) and are seizure-free. Two underwent partial resection (lateral temporal lobectomy, frontal corticectomy with anterior callosotomy) and have experienced a significant reduction in seizure frequency. Surgery did not result in any significant neurologic deficit or lead to compromise of developmental status. From these data, we tentatively conclude that excisional surgery can be performed safely in selected infants with medically uncontrolled malignant partial seizures and may significantly improve long-term seizure status. Referral to a tertiary center specializing in early childhood epilepsy surgical evaluation may be considered in these circumstances.\r"

One of the patients had epilepsia partialis continua secondary to the encephalitis. In this patient, the spectra demonstrated a high lactate resonance intensity (not seen in the normal, contralateral hemisphere) corresponding to an estimated local concentration of about 7.5 mM. We speculate that the observed decrease in the N-acetyl compound resonance may be a biochemical correlate of the neuronal loss characteristic of this disease. The results establish that excessive accumulation of lactate can occur in the human brain as a result of seizure activity even in the absence of ischemia. Thus, bioenergetic compromise may be 1 predisposing factor to the death of excitable cells in the epileptogenic area.\r"

The drug was easy to take and well tolerated, the only significant side effect being a reversible myopathy. Two similar compounds, simvastatin and pravastatin, exert comparable effects on serum lipids, including modest reductions in triglycerides and increases in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. The use of these drugs seems likely to exert a beneficial effect on atherosclerosis.\r"

IGF-1 levels were measured in 12 and fell into the normal range in 10. Prolactin was suppressed in six hyperprolactinaemic patients but was unaltered in normoprolactinaemic acromegalic patients. Post-prandial hyperglycaemia with impaired insulin secretion was noted in all patients, and one patient required oral hypoglycaemic agents. Octreotide did not affect thyroid function. CT scans from before and after six months of treatment demonstrated minimal tumour shrinkage in only two patients. Octreotide was well tolerated with no serious haematological or biochemical disturbance and no evidence of malabsorption. Two patients developed gallstones. Octreotide is effective in acromegaly. The development of gallstones is the only serious adverse event we have encountered.\r"

After introduction of the machine, the physicians began to order individual tests performed in the office rather than chemistry panels performed by the reference laboratory. There was no change in the frequency or costs of testing. Frequency of visits for hypertension and visits for all other reasons did not differ. The level of blood pressure control was the same before and after introduction of the machine. Thus, in this study, introduction of an office chemistry machine resulted in greater revenues to the clinic without changing quality of care or increasing the overall cost of treatment.\r"

  ".U": "90266802\r", 
  ".W": "Plasmacytoid T-cell lymphoma (PTL) is a rare lymphoma with unique morphologic, immunologic, and clinical features. Thus far, only three cases have been reported, each terminating in myeloid leukemia. The macrophage/monocyte rather than T-cell origin of \"plasmacytoid T-cells\" in reactive lymph nodes has been suggested in the past, but there has been no extensive investigation to demonstrate whether the PTLs are also of this lineage. The authors now report on a patient with PTL who had a long history of clinically stable idiopathic myelofibrosis. Immunocytochemical staining of the neoplastic plasmacytoid cells, with a large panel of monoclonal antibodies used on fresh-frozen and paraffin-embedded tissue sections, showed that the neoplastic cells expressed several macrophage/monocyte-associated markers, i.e., CD31, CD36 (thrombospondin receptor), and CD68 (KP1). Other markers of the macrophage/monocyte lineage (e.g., CD11b, CD11c, CD16) were absent. The neoplastic cells lacked B-cell-associated antigens and lacked most T-cell-associated markers, with the exception of CD2 and CD4. These findings are in close agreement with those of previous studies on normal plasmacytoid T-cells and support the macrophage/monocytic origin of PTL. Molecular hybridization studies provided additional support for the nonlymphoid origin of the plasmacytoid cells by demonstrating the absence of T-cell-receptor beta-chain and immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene rearrangements in the neoplastic cells. The results of the authors' studies indicate that \"plasmacytoid T-cell lymphoma\" associated with a chronic myeloproliferative disorder is of macrophage/monocyte lineage.\r"

An attempt was made to define a subset of stroke patients at risk for this syndrome on the basis of their clinical features. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty-one consecutive patients with stroke and transient ischemic attacks were assessed. Tests used for the laboratory diagnosis of the antiphospholipid syndrome included four phospholipid-dependent coagulation tests for detection of the lupus anticoagulant, and two enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays for antibodies to phospholipid. RESULTS: Three of 51 patients (6%, 95% confidence intervals 0% to 12.0%) had a lupus anticoagulant and the clinical features of the antiphospholipid syndrome. Seven patients had clinical features suggestive of the syndrome but negative laboratory tests. Those patients who were clinically unlikely to have this syndrome also had negative laboratory tests. CONCLUSION: In a series of 51 unselected patients presenting with stroke and transient ischemic attacks, three had the antiphospholipid syndrome. The clinical features of this syndrome are helpful in identifying this group of patients. The role of the lupus anticoagulant in the pathogenesis of stroke remains to be defined.\r"

After challenge with nebulised water and sodium cromoglycate there were significant decreases in specific conductance compared with those found after challenge with normal saline. After rechallenge with nebulised water there was no deterioration in lung function. Although sodium cromoglycate caused a deterioration in lung function in these infants, it protected their airways from challenge with nebulised water.\r"

Second, the patient's blood sample showed that the ratio of CD8+ cell (suppressor/cytotoxic T lymphocyte) to all lymphocyte population was increased to 0.61, as compared with the normal value of 0.12 to 0.16; however, absolute number of CD4+ T cell (helper/inducer T lymphocyte) was not decreased (1800/mm3). Furthermore, this patient had two tumors arising from the thymus, a major organ of the immune system, although its functional activity could not be determined. Based on these findings we believe that Kaposi's sarcoma in his case developed under the immunodeficient condition associated with a predominant increase of CD8+ cells that might have an intimate relation to the thymoma.\r"

The treatment group (18 patients) received 25% albumin supplementation to achieve and maintain serum albumin levels of 25 g/L (2.5 g/dL) or greater, while the nontreatment group (22 patients) received no concentrated albumin. There was no clinical benefit from albumin therapy when assessing mortality (39% vs 27%, treatment vs control) or major complication rate (89% vs 77% of patients). There were also no significant differences in length of hospital stay, intensive care unit stay, ventilator dependence, or tolerance of enteral feeding, despite significant elevations of albumin in the treatment group. The costly use of exogenous albumin as treatment for hypoalbuminemia in this patient population does not appear to be justified.\r"

All therapeutic regimens, including carbamazepine and/or phenytoin were associated with low levels of circulating thyroxine (T4), free thyroxine (FT4), and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, and with low values for the free androgen index, and phenytoin and carbamazepine plus phenytoin were associated with high serum concentrations of sex hormone-binding globulin. These hormone parameters were unaffected by valproate monotherapy. It seems probable that accelerated hormone metabolism is responsible for the hormonal changes found in patients treated with carbamazepine and/or phenytoin. However, every drug regimen studied also had depressant and/or stimulatory effects on the function of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis. The diverse endocrine effects of different antiepileptic drug regimens should be considered when starting antiepileptic drug therapy.\r"

Acute isotonic saline loading (intravenous bolus at 10 mL/kg plus continuous infusion at 0.25 mL/kg/min 30 min prior to and maintained throughout experiment) significantly augmented urine output (UV) and urinary Na+ excretion rate (UNaV) by 31% and 91%, respectively. Radial mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) were not affected by volume expansion. Anaritide at doses higher than 0.3 micrograms/kg reduced MAP in a dose-dependent fashion in euvolemic monkeys. In contrast, reduction in MAP was observed only at the highest dose (20 micrograms/kg) of anaritide in hypervolemic monkeys. The hypotensive responses to anaritide at 20 micrograms/kg in euvolemic and hypervolemic animals were similar (-26 +/- 5 v -24 +/- 5 mm Hg, respective maximum changes in MAP). UV and UNaV were increased by anaritide at 3 to 20 micrograms/kg in both euvolemic and hypervolemic monkeys; however, the increases at each effective dose of anaritide were greater or tended to be greater in hypervolemic rhesus monkeys compared with euvolemic rhesus monkeys. Compared to vehicle responses, HR was not affected by anaritide in either group of animals. In conclusion, acute extracellular hypervolemia potentiates the renal but suppresses the hypotensive responses to anaritide in conscious rhesus monkeys.\r"

Elevation of blood pressure in Dahl S rats was accompanied by an increase of vascular PGI2 synthase activity. The enzymatic activity was positively correlated to the blood pressure value. Similarly, impaired vascular capacity to generate PGI2, which was observed in prehypertensive Dahl S rats, was restored to the control level of Dahl R rats with the elevation of blood pressure. These data indicate that vascular PGI2 synthase activity is increased with blood pressure elevation, thereby contributing to the restoration of vascular capacity to generate PGI2 in Dahl S rats.\r"

  ".U": "90268103\r", 
  ".W": "Endothelial cells (EC) synthesize and secrete von Willebrand factor (vWF), a multimeric glycoprotein required for normal hemostasis. Within human endothelial cells, vWF multimers of extremely high molecular weight are stored in rod-shaped organelles known as Weibel-Palade bodies. Inflammatory mediators, such as interleukin-1, induce in vitro a variety of procoagulant responses by EC, including the secretion of stored vWF. We postulated that other inflammatory mediators might act to balance this procoagulant reaction, thereby assisting in the maintenance of blood fluidity during immune activation. Both gamma-interferon (gamma-IFN) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) were found to act independently and cooperatively to depress the stimulated release of vWF from EC. Analysis of stored vWF in either gamma-IFN and/or TNF-treated EC demonstrated a loss of high molecular weight multimers while immunofluorescent studies documented a loss of visible Weibel-Palade bodies. This suggests that gamma-IFN and TNF interfere with normal vWF storage. gamma-IFN acted in a dose-, time-, and RNA-dependent fashion, and its inhibition of vWF release was reversible with time. No effect of gamma-IFN on EC was noted when anti-serum to gamma-IFN was added. Unlike gamma-IFN, alpha-interferon did not effect EC vWF. Therefore, gamma-IFN and TNF may be important in decreasing vWF release during inflammatory or immunologic episodes.\r"

We describe and correlate the clinical, histopathologic, phenotypic, and genotypic findings in two patients with malignant lymphoma presenting with hepatosplenic disease. The morphologic pattern of lymphoma was that of a sinusal/sinusoidal infiltration in spleen, marrow, and liver. This morphologic characteristic was associated with the presence of a productive clonal rearrangement of the T-cell receptor (TCR) delta gene. Lymphoma cells expressed a CD3-TCR-gamma delta- phenotype. They were also double negative (ie, CD4-CD8-) and lacked the CD5 and CD7 antigens. In one patient, tumor progression was associated with phenotypic changes that resulted in a CD3-TCR-gamma delta- phenotype with the same delta-gene rearrangement as initially. These observations suggest the existence of a new type of peripheral T-cell lymphoma characterized by its hepatosplenic presentation, and by the sinusal/sinusoidal tropism and the TCR-gamma delta phenotype of the malignant cells.\r"

After disruption by nitrogen cavitation, a cytosol and a membrane fraction were obtained by sucrose-Percoll density centrifugation. The plasma membrane fraction contained cytochrome b558 and was free of microsomal or mitochondrial cytochromes as determined by low-temperature absorbance spectroscopy. Cell-free NADPH-oxidase activity from monocytes and neutrophils was reconstituted with cytosol and membranes in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulphate. By comparison with neutrophils, the cell-free NADPH-oxidase from monocytes showed a two- to threefold lower specific activity. The NADPH-oxidase was reconstituted with neutrophil membranes and monocyte cytosol, and vice versa. The Km for NADPH was always lower when monocyte cytosol was used. These experiments indicate that the membrane-bound components of the NADPH-oxidase from neutrophils and monocyte are similar and that levels of NADPH-oxidase components in the cytosols differ. Interferon gamma-treatment of the monocytes had no effect on the specific activity of the cell-free NADPH-oxidase.\r"

These proteins have distinct 2-D maps, as seen after 125I-labeling tyrosine residues (chloramine-T procedure), and even more strikingly after labeling primary amine residues (Bolton-Hunter procedure). Of the more than 20 iodopeptides visualized, only five migrated identically when preparations of RhD and LW were directly compared, suggesting that RhD and LW are different proteins that may share some common protein domains. N-glycanase treatment of the iodopeptides did not modify the 2-D map of the RhD protein but greatly affected the LW map, further indicating that LW, but not RhD, carries N-linked carbohydrate chains. After deglycosylation the LW map was different from the RhD map, confirming that the RhD and LW polypeptides are different proteins. These findings demonstrate that LW is neither a glycosylated form of Rh protein nor is Rh a precursor of LW.\r"

These data are used to assess the relative biological effectiveness (RBE) for 252Cf neutrons compared with 137Cs gamma radiation. Tumours treated were of common stage but were of bulky or barrel shape suitable for \"radiosurgical\" therapy. Dose-response curves were constructed, and additional data from the literature used to analyse the curve shape. The photon dose-response curve is complex on a logarithmic plot, whereas the 252Cf neutron curve is exponential. This indicates that the RBE can be different depending on the number of implants, schedule and size of dose delivered per session. The RBE values were approximately 8.0 at low doses or for multiple implants but they may rise to approximately 16 at larger doses or for single 252Cf implants.\r"

The width of the physical (i.e. dosimetric) penumbra involves an additional contribution from secondary electron spread. Using a suitably defined measure of penumbra width, the separate widths due to photons and secondary electrons are additive in quadrature. Secondary electron spread functions were measured using photographic dosimetry for 60Co gamma rays and for 4, 8 and 16 MV X rays. The results suggest that, under typical treatment conditions, secondary electron spread may be the predominant contributor to the penumbra at effective generating voltages exceeding 10 MV. The implications for selection of beam energy in precision small-field radiotherapy are discussed briefly.\r"

Consequently, the diagnosis is often overlooked, resulting in inappropriate treatment and a disastrous outcome.

The 98 amino acid (aa) N-terminus, the midportion of the N-terminus consisting of aa 31-67 of the 126 aa ANF prohormone (ie, pro ANF 31-67), and the C-terminus (aa. 99-126, ANF) were found in high concentrations in the pleural fluid of all of these patients. The concentrations of the N-terminus (ie, pro ANF 1-98), and pro ANF 31-67 in pleural fluid were nearly equal to their concentration in plasma of these patients. Their plasma levels were more than double the plasma concentrations of pro ANFs 1-98 and 31-67 in 54 persons without congestive heart failure. These preliminary findings demonstrate that all 126 amino acids of the ANF prohormone are present in pleural fluid of patients with congestive heart failure since both the 98 aa N-terminus and the C-terminus (aa 99-126) are present. Whether or not the N-terminus, which contains diuretic and natriuretic peptides, secretion into pleural fluid helps clear the fluid present in the lung in congestive heart failure could not be determined from the present investigation.\r"

In tuberculous pleuritis, pleural lymphocyte blastic response and IFN tau production were higher than those of peripheral lymphocytes, whereas in tuberculin-positive nontuberculous patients, peripheral lymphocyte response and IFN tau production were higher than those of pleural lymphocytes. Tuberculous pleural fluid lymphocytes underwent greater blastic transformation and produced more IFN tau than pleural lymphocytes of tuberculin-positive nontuberculous patients, whereas the opposite occurred in peripheral lymphocytes. In tuberculin-negative nontuberculous patients, there was no lymphoblastic response in either the pleural fluid or peripheral blood. These results concur with the concept of immunologic compartmentalization. In tuberculous pleuritis, there would be clonal expansion of PPD-responding T-lymphocytes in the pleural compartment. This expansion of PPD-specific lymphocytes would not occur in nontuberculous pleuritis, but lymphocytes sensitized to other antigens would accumulate in the pleural compartment.\r"

These studies demonstrated the existence of complex cytokine networks by which inflammatory cells regulate fibroblast function and fibroblasts, in turn, feed back to regulate inflammatory cell function. They also demonstrated that, in this complex network, the effect of an individual cytokine varies with the state of activation of the target cell, the presence of other cytokines in the local microenvironment, and the ability of the target cell to produce bioactive autocoids such as prostaglandins. Aspects of this cytokine network are discussed and a testable hypothesis for granuloma and abscess formation is detailed.\r"

Treatments were maintained for 4 wk. Galactose feeding was associated with a 21.5% reduction in MNCV (P less than 0.001), which was almost completely prevented by ponalrestat. Galactose-fed mice showed an 81% increase in Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase (P less than 0.01), an effect completely prevented by aldose reductase inhibition. Treatment of a separate galactose-fed group with sorbinil (300 mg/kg diet) also attenuated the MNCV deficit and prevented the increased Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase activity associated with galactosemia. Accumulation of galactitol in the nerves of galactose-fed mice was prevented by aldose reductase inhibition, but there were no alterations in myo-inositol levels in the sciatic nerves of any group.

  ".W": "There is controversy over the efficacy of aldose reductase inhibitors in preventing the development of peripheral nerve lesions in experimental diabetes. This study was designed to show whether long-term (28-wk) inhibition of aldose reductase by ponalrestat influences structural changes in peripheral sensory nerve in rats with chronic streptozocin-induced diabetes. Sciatic nerve levels of sorbitol and fructose were significantly reduced but not completely normalized by ponalrestat treatment. myo-Inositol levels, which tended to decrease in diabetic rats, were significantly increased by ponalrestat treatment and exceeded the level in nondiabetic control rats (P less than 0.01). Ponalrestat treatment significantly increased nerve conduction velocity over the 28 wk of treatment (P less than 0.05), but levels remained well below those of control rats. Structural analysis of sural nerve of diabetic rats disclosed significant preventive effects of ponalrestat on the reduction in myelinated nerve fiber size and fiber occupancy. Axon-fiber size ratio was also preserved in the ponalrestat-treated group. However, diffuse deposition of glycogen and increased glycogenosomes within axons were not influenced by ponalrestat treatment. In contrast to the effect on myelinated nerve fibers, morphometry of unmyelinated nerve fibers did not reveal a significant effect of ponalrestat treatment. These results suggest that chronic treatment with an aldose reductase inhibitor has beneficial effects on the peripheral sensory nerve of experimentally diabetic rats. The effects were primarily on myelinated rather than unmyelinated nerve fibers.\r"

  ".W": "The role of hepatic gamma-glutamyltransferase in the breakdown of circulating glutathione was studied in the perfused guinea pig liver. Hepatic gamma-glutamyltransferase activity in the guinea pig is sevenfold higher than in the rat and is comparable to its activity in man. Guinea pig livers were found to remove, in a single pass, 50% to 90% of glutathione (10 to 50 mumol/L) added to the portal perfusate. Removal of portal glutathione was totally dependent on the activity of gamma-glutamyltransferase and led to the near quantitative appearance of cysteinyl-glycine and cysteine in the caval perfusate. Glutathione removal by the intact liver followed saturation with a Michaelis constant (Km) of 59 mumol/L for glutathione and a maximum velocity of 235 nmol glutathione/min/gm of liver weight. The capacity of the guinea pig liver to remove circulating glutathione was estimated to be sevenfold to 10-fold higher than its net rate of output of glutathione into the circulation. Inhibition of gamma-glutamyltransferase activity in the perfused liver led to threefold to sixfold increases in the hepatic output of glutathione into the circulation, indicating that more than two thirds of glutathione transported extracellularly is broken down. Data obtained demonstrate a major role of hepatic gamma-glutamyltransferase, both in the removal of portally carried glutathione and in the degradation of glutathione molecules released by the liver itself into the sinusoids. These findings suggest the existence of an intraorgan transport of glutathione in the liver, whereby periportal cells could provide glutathione precursors to pericentral cells.\r"

  ".W": "Antibodies against cytochrome P-450 are found in some children with autoimmune hepatitis (antiliver/kidney microsome 1) and in patients with ticrynafen hepatitis (antiliver/kidney microsome 2). For an immune reaction against cytochrome P-450 to possibly destroy the hepatocytes, one must assume that cytochrome P-450 is present on the plasma membrane surface of hepatocytes. In a first series of experiments, plasma membranes were prepared with a technique based on the electrostatic attachment of isolated hepatocytes to polyethyleneimine-coated beads. After vortexing, beads were coated with a very pure plasma membrane fraction. Microsomal contamination, judged from the specific activities of glucose-6-phosphatase or NADH-cytochrome c reductase, was less than 1%. Nevertheless, the specific content (per milligram of protein) of CO-binding cytochrome P-450 was 20% of that in microsomes; the specific benzo(a)pyrene hydroxylase activity was 25%, and ethoxycoumarin deethylase 11%. Immunoblots showed the presence of cytochromes P-450 UT-A, UT-H, PB-B, ISF-G and PCN-E, the last three isoenzymes being inducible by, respectively, phenobarbital, 3-methylcholanthrene and dexamethasone. In a second series of experiments, nonpermeabilized isolated hepatocytes from untreated rats were incubated with anticytochrome P-450 antibodies. Immunofluorescence and immunoperoxidase staining confirmed the presence of cytochromes P-450 UT-A, PB-B and ISF-G on the membrane. In a last series of experiments, human antiliver-kidney microsomal 1 antibodies were found to react specifically with rat liver plasma membrane cytochrome P-450 UT-H (IID subfamily). We conclude that several cytochrome P-450 isoenzymes are present, active and inducible on the plasma membrane surface of hepatocytes. It is therefore conceivable that immunization against plasma membrane cytochrome P-450 might lead to the immunological destruction of hepatocytes in some patients.\r"

  ".W": "Earlier work with rat arteries has resulted in a widely held assumption that resistance artery smooth muscle will not contract on exposure to a reduced transplasmalemmal sodium gradient. In view of the well-recognized low sensitivity of rat tissue to cardiac glycosides, we have investigated the effects of altering the transplasmalemmal sodium gradient on vascular smooth muscle tone by using human resistance arteries. Incubation of arteries in low sodium or in ouabain to inhibit active sodium efflux for 1 hour increased the contractile response to caffeine stimulation; this finding indicated enhanced calcium buffering by the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Prolonged incubation in ouabain in the presence of phentolamine or diltiazem resulted in a concentration-dependent increase in the tone of resting human resistance arteries. Reduction of the transplasmalemmal sodium gradient by incubation in low sodium buffer effected an increase in tone similar to that obtained in the presence of ouabain. These results suggest that alteration of the transplasmalemmal sodium gradient may increase the vascular smooth muscle tone of human resistance arteries by altering intracellular calcium handling. This is a new finding in human resistance arteries and may involve inhibition and, indeed, reversal of sodium-dependent calcium efflux. A concentration-dependent potentiation of tone was found after the addition of ouabain to submaximally activated arteries. Sodium-calcium exchange may also play a pivotal role in this mechanism.\r"

Since beta 2M was discovered to form amyloid fibrils in patients undergoing long term, chronic hemodialysis and monomeric beta 2M levels in plasma of these patients are highly elevated, and since hemodialysis-related factors that increase beta 2M production are unknown, we evaluated beta 2M production by mononuclear phagocytes under a variety of conditions. We utilized a novel enzyme-lined immunoabsorbant assay to quantitate beta 2M release. Adherence of macrophages onto polystyrene or Cuprophan membranes does not induce beta 2M synthesis or release. In contrast, interaction of macrophages with lipopolysaccharide, gamma-interferon, tumor necrosis factor, or interleukin 1 induces synthesis or release. In contrast, interaction of macrophages with lipopolysaccharide, gamma-interferon, tumor necrosis factor, or interleukin 1 induces synthesis and release of beta 2M, indicating that beta 2M synthesis is increased during macrophage activation. Exposing leukocytes or macrophages to changes in osmotic or oncotic pressure induces a rapid release of beta 2M and interleukin 1 into the cellular medium. These results suggest that during hemodialysis, beta 2M production is more likely to result from endotoxin contamination, or osmotic and oncotic changes, rather than direct interaction of mononuclear phagocytes with cellulosic membranes.\r"

In addition, we assessed the role of vagal afferent pathways in the abdominal muscles' response to ventilatory chemostimulation by examining abdominal EMG activity (EMGab) before and after bilateral cervical vagotomy in five animals. Phasic expiratory EMGab was observed in 11 of 12 piglets during eupnea. Hypercapnia was associated with a sustained augmentation of minute EMGab (444 +/- 208% control). In contrast, hypoxia consistently augmented (1 min, 193 +/- 33% control) then diminished (5 min, 126 +/- 39% control) minute EMGab. Vagotomy resulted in a decline in peak moving time average EMGab by approximately one-half (48 +/- 18% control); the abdominal muscles' response to ventilatory chemostimulation, however, was qualitatively unchanged. We conclude that 1) expiration during eupnea in anesthetized newborn piglets is associated with phasic EMGab; 2) both hypercapnia and hypoxia augment minute EMGab; however, only hypercapnia is associated with sustained augmentation; and 3) although vagal afferents have a role in modulating the base-line level of EMGab, other extravagal mechanisms appear to determine the pattern of EMGab in response to ventilatory chemostimulation.\r"

To determine whether silica particles contribute directly to this increased permeability, we measured paracellular permeability of rat alveolar epithelium after exposure to silica, in vitro, using markers of the extracellular space. Silica (Minusil) markedly increased permeability in a dose- and time-dependent manner. This was not the result of cytolytic injury, because lactate dehydrogenase release from monolayers exposed to silica was not increased. Pretreatment of the silica with serum, charged dextrans, or aluminum sulfate blocked the increase in permeability. Scanning electron microscopy demonstrated adherence of the silica to the surface of the alveolar epithelial cells. Thus silica can directly increase permeability of alveolar epithelium.\r"

The great cardiac vein PCO2 increased from a control value of 52 +/- 2 to 132 +/- 28 (SD) Torr during CPR, whereas the arterial PCO2 was unchanged (39 +/- 4 vs. 38 +/- 4). The coronary venoarterial PCO2 gradient, therefore, increased remarkably from 13 +/- 2 to 94 +/- 29 Torr. The simultaneously measured great cardiac vein lactate concentrations increased from 0.24 +/- 0.06 to 7.3 +/- 2.34 mmol/l. Much more moderate increases in the lactate content of aortic blood from 0.64 +/- 0.25 to 2.56 +/- 0.27 mmol/l were observed. Increases in great cardiac vein PCO2 and lactate were highly correlated during CPR (r = 0.91). After successful CPR, the coronary venoarterial PCO2 gradient returned to normal levels within 2 min after restoration of spontaneous circulation. Lactate content was rapidly reduced and lactate extraction was reestablished within 30 min after CPR. These studies demonstrate marked but reversible acidosis predominantly as the result of myocardial CO2 production during CPR.\r"

Cardiac output (Qc) and pulmonary tissue volume (Vti) were measured by a rebreathing technique with the inert gas Freon 22, and O2 consumption (VO2) was determined by the closed-circuit technique. Arterial blood gases (PaO2, PaCO2) were analyzed by a micromethod, and alveolar gas (PAO2) was analyzed during quiet breathing with a mass spectrometer. The findings were as follows. 1) Immersion in a cold bath had no significant effect on Qc compared with the value measured at Tw = 34 degrees C, whereas immersion in a hot bath led to a considerable increase in Qc. Vti was not affected by immersion at any of the temperatures tested. 2) A large rise in metabolic rate VO2 was only observed at Tw = 25 degrees C (P less than 0.001). 3) Arterial blood gases were not significantly affected by immersion, whatever the water temperature. 4) O2 transport during immersion is affected by two main factors: hydrostatic pressure and temperature. Above neutral temperature, O2 transport is improved because of the marked increase in Qc resulting from the combined actions of hydrostatic counter pressure and body heating. Below neutral temperature, O2 transport is altered; an increase in O2 extraction of the tissue is even calculated.\r"

The purpose of this study was to develop equipment for local hydrogen clearance measurements with a modified eight-channel platinum electrode to assess changes in local skeletal muscle capillary blood flow induced by hyperoxemia and ritanserin (0.035 mg/kg) during hyperoxemia. Laser-Doppler flowmetry was used for regional microflow measurements. Two groups of six anesthetized and artificially ventilated rabbits were studied: group I with normoxemia and hyperoxemia [arterial PO2 (PaO2) 48 kPa; 360 Torr] and group II before and after ritanserin with hyperoxemia (PaO2 46 kPa; 345 Torr). In group I, hyperoxemia induced a mean local hydrogen clearance decrease of 22% while laser-Doppler flowmetry signal decreased 31%. In group II, ritanserin induced a 125% mean local hydrogen clearance increase compared with hyperoxemia (or 37% compared with group I normoxemia); laser-Doppler flowmetry signal increased 30%. The sum distribution of local hydrogen clearances shifted to the left during hyperoxemia and to the right after ritanserin. The conclusion from this study is that local and regional microflow changes can explain the effects of hyperoxemia and ritanserin on skeletal muscle oxygenation.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of hypo- and hyperosmolarity on the function of isolated human airways were studied. Changes in osmolarity induced an increasing bronchoconstriction that was proportional to the magnitude of the change in osmolarity. Hypertonicity-induced airway narrowing resulted when buffer was made hypertonic with sodium chloride or mannitol but not with urea. The airways showed no tachyphylaxis to repetitive exposure to hypo- and hypertonic buffer of 200 and 600 mosM, respectively. The bronchoconstriction was not secondary to stimulation of H1 or leukotriene C4/D4 receptors or the release of prostaglandins in the preparation. The bronchoconstriction in hypotonic buffer was totally dependent on extracellular calcium, whereas in hypertonic buffer the bronchoconstriction seemed partially dependent on intracellular calcium release. Isoprenaline prevented the bronchoconstriction in hyper- or hypotonic buffer of 450 and 250 mosM but not in buffer of 600 and 150 mosM. It is concluded that hypo- and hypertonic buffers lead to bronchoconstriction via different mechanisms, which relate to influx of extracellular calcium in hyposmolar buffer and probably to release of calcium from intracellular stores in hypertonic buffer. In strongly hypertonic buffer, part of the bronchoconstriction may be due to osmotic shrinkage. The relevance of our data for the mechanism of bronchoconstriction after inhalation of hypo- or hypertonic saline depends on whether changes in osmolarity around the airway smooth muscle occur in asthmatics but not in normal subjects, and this has not yet been established.\r"

We hypothesized that similar increases in LTC4, detected in the lung parenchyma and pulmonary vascular compartment during cyclooxygenase blockade with indomethacin (INDO), would be observed during an equal increase in pulmonary arterial pressure caused by acute alveolar hypoxia (HYP, 100% N2) or platelet-activating factor (PAF, 10 micrograms into the pulmonary artery). Rat lungs were perfused at constant flow in vitro with an albumin-Krebs-Henseleit solution. Mean pulmonary arterial pressure (n = 6 per group) increased from a base line of 10.9 +/- 1.2 to 15.8 +/- 2.1 (HYP + INDO) and 15.5 +/- 1.9 (SE) Torr (PAF + INDO). LTC4 levels increased only in response to PAF + INDO; perfusate levels increased from 0.4 +/- 0.07 to 5.3 +/- 1.1 ng/40 ml, and lung parenchymal levels increased from 1.9 +/- 0.07 to 22.8 +/- 5.3 ng/lung. Diethylcarbamazine (lipoxygenase inhibitor) reduced PAF-induced lung parenchymal levels of LTC4 by 68% and pulmonary hypertension by 63%. We conclude that 1) LTC4 is not a mediator of hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction and 2) intravascular PAF is a potent stimulus for LTC4 production in the lung parenchyma.\r"

PETCO2 was the end-tidal PCO2. PACO2 was calculated using a reconstruction of the alveolar oscillation of PCO2 obtained from the end-tidal \"plateau\" in PCO2. PADCO2 was calculated as for PACO2 except that the effects of dead space were incorporated. PJCO2 was calculated from an empirical relationship involving PETCO2 and tidal volume. Six subjects were studied at rest and during cycle ergometry at 50 and 100 W while breathing a variety of gas mixtures. Arterial samples were drawn for determination of true PaCO2. The differences for each method between estimated and true PaCO2 at rest and at 50 and 100 W were as follows: PETCO2, -1.35 +/- 2.64, 1.67 +/- 2.31, and 2.67 +/- 2.02 (SD) Torr; PaCO2, -2.15 +/- 2.73, -0.80 +/- 2.18, and -0.35 +/- 2.31 (SD) Torr; PADCO2, -1.55 +/- 2.54, 0.25 +/- 2.16, and 0.63 +/- 2.26 (SD) Torr; and PJCO2, -1.41 +/- 2.30, 0.12 +/- 1.79, and 0.08 +/- 1.96 (SD) Torr.

Gonadotropin immunoreactivity was measured using a conventional RIA (I) and an ultrasensitive immunofluorometric method (F). Bioactive (B) LH was assessed by the mouse interstitial cells in vitro bioassay, and B-FSH using the immature rat granulosa cell assay. Acute GnRH stimulation of adult men (n = 6) increased LH levels measured by the different methods 4.3- to 5.3-fold. The B/I ratio of LH increased from 2.34 +/- 0.21 to 3.71 +/- 0.36 (mean +/- SEM) at 120 min (P less than 0.05), but no change was found in the B/F ratio. After ovariectomy of premenopausal women (n = 6), the LH levels increased in 1 week 4- to 6-fold, the B/I ratio from 1.85 +/- 0.22 to 2.59 +/- 0.24, and the B/F ratio from 1.78 +/- 0.22 to 2.90 +/- 0.30 (P less than 0.05 for both). In addition, the LH levels were measured during GnRH agonist treatment of ovarian carcinoma (n = 8), endometriosis (n = 8), and prostatic carcinoma after orchiectomy (n = 8). In the two former groups, serum B-LH decreased in 1 month to undetectable levels (less than 0.5 IU/L), and in the prostate cancer patients to 1.2 (0.8-1.9) IU/L (log mean and range of +/- SEM). The concomitant decline of I-LH was to 1.5-1.9 IU/L in the agonist-treated female patients, and that of F-LH to 0.10-0.15 IU/L; in the prostate cancer patients, respectively, these values were 7-8 and 0.3-0.7 IU/L. The B/I and B/F ratios during the agonist treatments could only be calculated in the prostate cancer patients (in the others, B-LH became undetectable). The B/I ratio decreased from 2.34 +/- 0.5 to 0.14 +/- 0.03 (P less than 0.01), but no suppression was found in the B/F ratio from a pretreatment value of 3.6 +/- 0.8. B-, I-, and F-FSH levels were measured in the GnRH agonist-treated orchiectomized prostate cancer patients. The pretreatment level of B-FSH was 154 (137-175), that of I-FSH was 38.0 (34.4-42.0), and that of F-FSH was 39.8 (35.3-44.9) IU/L. The B/I ratio of FSH was 3.76 +/- 0.49, and the B/F ratio was 3.53 +/- 0.59. The mean B-FSH level decreased during treatment by 87-93.5%, that of I-FSH by 98%, and that of F-FSH by 91.5% (P less than 0.01 for all).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

We have examined the metabolic effect of recombinant human IFN gamma (0.001-500 U/mL) on thyroglobulin (TG) synthesis and secretion in cultured human thyrocytes. Thyrocytes dispersed from human Graves' thyroid tissues were cultured in the presence of TSH with or without IFN gamma. IFN gamma alone had not effect on either basal TG secretion or de novo TG synthesis, as measured by immunoprecipitation. At 100 U/mL and above, IFN gamma inhibited TSH-induced TG secretion into the medium. At 500 U/mL, IFN gamma inhibited TSH- or dibutyryl cAMP-induced TG synthesis at the gene transcription level, as evidenced by the decrease in steady state TG mRNA. IFN gamma had no effect on either basal or TSH-induced cAMP release by the thyrocytes, suggesting that the inhibitory effect occurs at a site distal to cAMP formation. These data demonstrate that IFN gamma directly inhibits TSH-stimulated TG gene expression and TG secretion. This provides further evidence that IFN gamma has a metabolic effect on thyroid hormone synthesis.\r"

Although the regulation of endometrial PRL secretion has been extensively studied, little is known about myometrial and fibroid PRL. This study investigated the effects of the GnRH agonist (GnRH-a) leuprolide acetate depot, administered in vivo, on fibroid and myometrial PRL secretion by explant cultures. Tissue was obtained from 17 patients enrolled in a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial. Explant cultures of fibroid and myometrium were established in defined serum free media and harvested media assayed for PRL and total protein. Fibroid PRL secretion was substantially greater than myometrial PRL secretion. Fibroid PRL secretion increased with time whereas myometrial PRL secretion did not. Fibroid, but not myometrial, PRL secretion in GnRH-a treated patients was significantly lower when compared to controls. Fibroid protein secretion was not affected by GnRH-a administration in vivo. Progesterone supplementation in vitro inhibited fibroid PRL secretion; estrogen and GnRH-a in vitro had a minimal effect. Western blot analysis showed a small proportion of PRL secreted by fibroids to be glycosylated. These results demonstrate: 1) PRL secretion is greater from fibroids than myometrium; 2) fibroid PRL secretion in vitro is specifically reduced after 24 h after in vivo treatment with GnRH-a; 3) estrogen or progesterone in vitro does not reverse the suppression by in vivo administration of GnRH-a; and 4) GnRH-a in vitro has no effect on fibroid PRL secretion.\r"

After baseline thyroid function tests, saturated solution of potassium iodide (SSKI; 10 drops; 300 mg iodide) was administered daily for 120 days, and serum T4, T3, and TSH concentrations were assessed 15, 30, 60, 90, 120 days and 2-4 months after SSKI was discontinued. Iodide perchlorate discharge tests were carried out before SSKI administration, and TRH tests were performed on the last day of iodide administration. Two SAT subjects developed clinical evidence of hypothyroidism with markedly elevated serum TSH concentrations, and SSKI was discontinued on days 60 and 90, respectively. Thirteen of 18 SAT patients had at least 1 abnormal thyroid function test (iodide perchlorate discharge test, elevated serum TSH concentration, and abnormal TSH response to TRH) compared to 2 of 12 TX patients. These findings strongly suggest that euthyroid subjects with a previous history of SAT are prone to develop iodide-induced hypothyroidism, suggesting that subtle abnormalities in the thyroid organification of iodide and subsequent thyroid hormone synthesis persist years after the episode of SAT.\r"

Plasma concentrations of hANP-like immunoreactivity (LI) from normal subjects and patients with mild CHF (class I), as classified by the New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional criteria, did not differ (15 +/- 1 vs. 16 +/- 1 pmol/L, mean +/- SE), whereas plasma levels of hANP-LI in patients with moderate and severe CHF significantly (P less than 0.01) increased in relation to the severity of CHF (class II, 44 +/- 4 pmol/L; class III, 116 +/- 24 pmol/L; class IV, 141 +/- 21 pmol/L). Reverse-phase HPLC and gel permeation chromatography coupled with RIA for hANP revealed that the circulating forms of hANP-LI consisted of alpha-hANP, beta-hANP, and gamma-hANP in CHF, whereas alpha-hANP predominated in normal plasma. The percentage of beta-hANP in total hANP-LI as calculated from the chromatograms by gel filtration was greater in severe CHF (NYHA class III and IV) than those in mild CHF (NYHA class I and II), and apparently exceeded those of other forms. Successful medical treatment for CHF resulted in a marked reduction of total plasma hANP-LI levels with a concomitant disappearance or reduction of beta-hANP in 14 patients examined. These data suggest that beta-hANP and gamma-hANP are secreted from the failing human heart, possibly resulting from the augmented synthesis and/or the altered processing of hANP precursor in cardiocytes, and that circulating beta-hANP may serve as a potential marker for the severity of CHF in man.\r"

To further evaluate this hypothesis we have investigated the influence of glycyrrhetinic acid (GA), the mineralocorticoid-active constituent of liquorice, on plasma cortisol and cortisone in 10 healthy young normotensive volunteers. Pure GA (500 mg/day), administered orally from days 3-10 of the study, exerted pronounced mineralocorticoid activity. Ingestion of GA resulted in an elevated urinary excretion of free cortisol and virtually unchanged plasma cortisol levels in the presence of markedly decreased levels of both plasma cortisone and urinary free cortisone. These results provide direct clinical support for the hypothesis that GA induces an inhibition of the activity of 11 beta-dehydrogenase, resulting in a blockade in the conversion of cortisol to cortisone.\r"

  ".U": "90270375\r", 
  ".W": "To examine the hypothesis that the secretion of free alpha-subunit (FAS) can serve as an alternative to LH as a neuroendocrine marker of gonadotroph stimulation by GnRH in euthyroid humans, we have investigated the relationship of pulsatile FAS secretion in euthyroid GnRH-deficient men (n = 10) before and after exogenous GnRH stimulation and in normal men under the influence of endogenous GnRH secretion (n = 18). Before GnRH exposure, the GnRH-deficient men showed a complete absence of both LH and FAS pulses. During the initial 7 days of GnRH exposure, all GnRH-deficient men exhibited pulsatile release of FAS by the third day, whereas the appearance of pulsatile release of LH and FSH was more variable. Long term administration of GnRH led to pulses of LH and FAS that were 100% concordant with a demonstrable dose-response relationship between GnRH and FAS, which was quantitatively similar to but more exuberant than that for LH. All doses of GnRH that produced LH pulses within the normal adult range yielded supraphysiological FAS pulses. Analysis of distribution histograms of interpulse intervals and pulse amplitudes of LH and FAS in both normal and GnRH-deficient subjects demonstrated no significant difference between these glycoproteins in interpulse intervals in either the normal or GnRH-deficient groups or in the pulse amplitudes in the GnRH-deficient subjects. There was, however, a significant difference (P less than 0.01) between the distribution histogram of LH and FAS pulse amplitudes in normal men. We conclude that the pulsatile secretion of FAS in euthyroid men 1) is determined by GnRH secretion, 2) is the initial glycoprotein to be secreted in a pulsatile fashion from the gonadotroph during early GnRH exposure in GnRH-deficient men, 3) demonstrates a dose-response relationship to exogenous GnRH which is more robust than that of LH in GnRH-deficient men receiving GnRH, and 4) can, therefore, serve as a complementary and powerful tool with LH for the study of GnRH neurosecretory dynamics.\r"

  ".W": "To elucidate the mechanism of decreased 131I uptake by the thyroid gland in patients with subacute thyroiditis and painless thyroiditis, human thyroid follicles were cultured with interleukin-1 (IL-1), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF alpha), and/or interferon-gamma (IFN gamma), and the effects of these cytokines on thyroid function were studied in vitro. When human thyrocytes were cultured in RPMI-1640 medium containing 0.5% fetal calf serum and TSH for 5-8 days, the cells incorporated 125I, synthesized de novo [125I]iodotyrosines and [125I]iodothyronines, and secreted [125I]T4 and [125I]T3 into the medium. IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta inhibited 125I incorporation and [125I]iodothyronine release in a concentration-dependent manner. The minimal inhibitory effect was detected at 10 pg/ml. Electron microscopic examination revealed a marked decrease in lysosome formation in IL-1-treated thyrocytes. TNF alpha and IFN gamma also inhibited thyroid function in a concentration-dependent manner. Furthermore, when thyrocytes were cultured with IL-1, TNF alpha and IFN gamma, these cytokines more than additively inhibited thyroid function. Although the main mechanism of 131I uptake suppression in the thyroid gland in subacute thyroiditis is due to cellular damage and suppression of TSH release, our present findings suggest that IL-1, TNF alpha, and IFN gamma produced in the inflammatory process within the thyroid gland further inhibit iodine incorporation and at least partly account for the decreased 131I uptake by the thyroid gland in destruction-induced hyperthyroidism.\r"

  ".W": "The circadian pattern of serum TSH in normal children, aged 5-18 yr, is characterized by a nocturnal surge and is presumably related in some way to a biological clock within the central nervous system. To look for patients deficient in the nocturnal TSH surge, we studied 52 children with hypothalamic-pituitary disorders. Thirteen of the children were hypothyroid, as judged by subnormal serum free T4 (FT4). The hypothyroid patients had a mean nocturnal TSH surge of 22% (range, -30% to +114%), significantly less than that of normal controls (mean, 124%; 95% confidence limits, 47-300%; n = 96; P less than 0.01). Only 1 of the hypothyroid children had a value for the nocturnal TSH surge (114%) that was within the normal range. Nineteen of the 52 patients with hypothalamic-pituitary disorders had subnormal nocturnal TSH surges; their mean iodothyronine values were significantly less than those of the 33 patients with normal surges [total T4, 73 +/- 4 (mean +/- SE) vs. 109 +/- 3 nmol/L (P less than 0.01); FT4, 13 +/- 1.0 vs. 19 +/- 0.5 pmol/L (P less than 0.01)]. These data demonstrate a clear association of a deficient nocturnal TSH surge and low iodothyronine concentration in children with hypothalamic-pituitary disorders. We performed both TRH tests and nocturnal TSH surge tests in 11 of the children with central hypothyroidism; TRH was abnormal in only 2, while the nocturnal surge test was abnormal in 10 of the 11. We suggest that the nocturnal surge of TSH is important for maintenance of thyroid function and conclude that the nocturnal TSH surge is a much more sensitive test than the TSH response to TRH for the diagnosis of central hypothyroidism.\r"

  ".W": "After arterial denudation by external rubbing of the left main renal artery, we assessed renal plasma flow rate (RPF) and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in left and right kidneys of Munich-Wistar rats before and after intravenous infusion of acetylcholine (ACH), atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), or nitroprusside (NP). In the right kidney RPF and/or GFR increased in response to both endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF)-dependent (i.e., ACH) and -independent vasodilators (i.e., ANP and NP); on average, RPF rose by 22 +/- 4% (P less than 0.005), 19 +/- 10% (P less than 0.005), and 37 +/- 12% (P greater than 0.05), respectively. By contrast, in the left kidney RPF failed to increase after ACH (falling by 23 +/- 10%, P less than 0.001) and rose only in response to ANP and NP. To further evaluate the main renal artery's contribution to renal vasodilation, ACH and another EDRF-dependent agent, histamine, were infused through a micropipette into either the proximal or distal portions of the endothelium-intact renal artery. Proximal infusion of ACH led to increases in RPF and GFR, on average by 8 +/- 2% (P less than 0.025) and 10 +/- 3% (P less than 0.01), while bypassing the arterial endothelium by distal infusion failed to increase RPF and GFR, which fell by 24 +/- 6% (P less than 0.025) and 22 +/- 6% (P less than 0.005), respectively. Similarly, proximal infusion of histamine increased RPF by 12 +/- 3% (P less than 0.05), while distal infusion was virtually without effects on plasma flow. Micropuncture study during intravenous ACH infusion revealed significantly higher afferent and efferent arteriolar resistances and lower ultrafiltration coefficients in denuded versus nondenuded kidneys. These data indicate that the main renal artery is a major regulator of renal blood flow and vascular resistances. Similar to other endothelium-derived substances, EDRF may be elaborated mainly by large vessels and may act on the downstream microcirculatory systems, which determine organ blood flow and transcapillary fluid transfer.\r"

  ".W": "Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) tumor progression can involve partial or complete conversion to a more treatment-resistant non-small cell (NSCLC) phenotype. In a cell culture model of this phenomenon, we have previously demonstrated that insertion of the viral Harvey ras gene (v-Ha-ras) into SCLC cell lines with amplification and overexpression of the c-myc gene induced many NSCLC phenotypic features. We now report that the v-Ha-ras gene can also induce morphologic, biochemical, and growth characteristics consistent with the NSCLC phenotype in an N-myc amplified SCLC cell line, NCI-H249. We show that v-Ha-ras has novel effects on these cells, abrogating an SCLC-specific growth requirement for gastrin-releasing peptide, and inducing mRNA expression of three NSCLC-associated growth factors and receptors, platelet-derived growth factor B chain, transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-alpha), and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGF-R). TGF-alpha secretion and EGF-R also appear, consistent with the induction of an autocrine loop previously shown to be growth stimulatory for NSCLC in culture. These data suggest that N-myc and v-Ha-ras represent functional classes of genes that may complement each other in bringing about the phenotypic alterations seen during SCLC tumor progression, and suggest that such alterations might include the appearance of growth factors and receptors of potential importance for the growth of the tumor and its surrounding stroma.\r"

These PPTPase activities were unaffected by alloxan diabetes. Acute administration of insulin to normal animals also did not change PPTPase activity in liver plasma membranes or endosomal membranes. Although alloxan diabetes did not affect PPTPase activity measured with artificial substrates or with epidermal growth factor receptors, a decrease in insulin receptor dephosphorylation was noted. Dephosphorylation of hepatic receptors from normal and diabetic rats by membrane PPTPase from control rats was similar. These results indicate that alloxan diabetes does not lead to a generalized effect on hepatic PPTPase activity, although a substrate-specific decrease in activity with the insulin receptor may occur.\r"

  ".W": "Crohn's disease represents part of a spectrum of inflammatory bowel diseases characterized by immune regulatory defects and genetic predisposition. T cell antigen receptor V gene usage by T lymphocytes was investigated using four MAbs specific for various V gene products. One MAb (Ti3a), reactive with V beta 8 gene products, detected increased numbers of T cells in a subset of Crohn's disease patients as compared with normal controls and ulcerative colitis patients. In family studies there was no apparent inherited predisposition to the use of V beta 8 genes, and there was no association between a restriction fragment length polymorphism of the V beta 8.1 gene and Crohn's disease. The V beta 8+ T cells were concentrated in the mesenteric lymph nodes draining the inflammatory lesions and belonged to both the CD4+ and CD8+ T cell subsets. In contrast, lamina propria and intraepithelial T cells were not enriched in V beta 8+ T cells, suggesting that these cells were participating in the afferent limb of a gut-associated immune response. The expanded V beta 8+ T cells in Crohn's disease appear to result from an immune response to an as yet unknown antigen.\r"

  ".W": "To define the immunoregulatory mechanisms underlying serum IgE levels found in patients with filariasis, we studied polyclonal IgE production by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from 15 patients with filarial infections, with a focus on the role of interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) in the generation and regulation of the response. Spontaneous in vitro IgE production was elevated in 10 of the 15 patients (836-6,464 pg/ml; normals, less than 500 pg/ml). Addition of filarial parasite antigen to PBMC cultures significantly stimulated polyclonal IgE production in an antigen dose-dependent manner in 10 of 12 patients tested (P less than 0.001). The essential role of IL-4 in the generation of this response was demonstrated when simultaneous addition of anti-IL-4 completely inhibited antigen-stimulated IgE production in all 10 patients studied. An inhibitory role of endogenously produced IFN-gamma was also indicated when the addition of anti-IFN-gamma to the cultures significantly augmented filarial antigen-stimulated IgE production by 33-1,238% in these same patients. Addition of 10-1,000 U/ml of recombinant human IFN-gamma to PBMC completely inhibited parasite antigen-induced IgE production. This study demonstrates that filarial antigen-stimulated IgE production in patients with filariasis is mediated by IL-4 and down regulated by IFN-gamma and suggests that the amount of IgE produced depends on the relative quantity of IL-4 and IFN-gamma generated by parasite-specific T cells.\r"

This represents an enrichment for this Id (seen in only 52% of SLE patients generally). Eight of these 22 SLE patients also have anti-Sm antibody activity. Sm partially inhibits the antibody binding of p24 gag suggesting immunologic cross-reactivity between the retroviral antigen p24 gag and the autoantigen Sm. Anti-Id 4B4 also inhibits p24 gag antibody binding by as much as 40%. Finally the monoclonal antibody 4B4 showed cross-reactivity to Sm and p24 gag. The following points emerge from our studies: (a) SLE patients make antibodies to p24 gag of HIV-1, (b) there is a relationship between immunity to p24 gag and a conserved idiotype, and (c) anti-Sm antibodies can cross-react with p24 gag.\r"

  ".W": "Retinoblastoma is a malignant intraocular tumor that primarily affects small children. These tumors are primitive neuroectodermal malignancies, however some of them show morphologic evidence of differentiation into photoreceptors. Phototransduction cascades are a series of biochemical reactions that convert a photon of light into a neural impulse in rods and cones. The components of these cascades are uniquely expressed in photoreceptors and, although functionally similar, distinct components of these cascades are expressed in rods and cones. Using HPLC anion exchange chromatography, Western blot analysis, and specific monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies, we found that the cone but not the rod cGMP phosphodiesterase is functionally expressed in all six primary retinoblastomas examined and in three continuous retinoblastoma cell lines. Morphologic evidence of differentiation did not correlate with the expression of the enzyme. Furthermore, GTP analogues could activate the phosphodiesterase activity suggesting that an intact phototransduction cascade is present in the tumors. The presence of the cone phototransduction cascade in retinoblastoma confirms that this tumor has biochemically differentiated along the cone cell lineage.\r"

  ".W": "To further the understanding of the role of T cells in immunity to the parasite Toxoplasma gondii, antigen-specific T cell clones were generated using peripheral blood mononuclear cells from seropositive individuals. Whole parasites were used to stimulate a proliferative expansion of antigen-reactive cells, followed by limiting dilution cloning in the presence of irradiated, autologous PBMC and rIL-2. Three parasite antigen-specific T cell clones expressing the CD3+ phenotype were selected for further characterization. Phenotypic analysis with monoclonal antibodies revealed two clones reactive with CD8 (RTg1 and RTg3) while the other (RTg2) phenotyped as CD4+, CD8-. When tested in a proliferation assay using a panel of different T. gondii proteins, clone RTg1 reacted with a single large protein (Mr greater than 180,000) as well as smaller components (less than 12,000), clone RTg2 reacted with a protein of Mr = 28,000 and clone RTg3 reacted with a protein of 116,000 plus smaller components (less than 12,000). Only the 28,000 = Mr antigen recognized by RTg2 was reactive on Western blot with autologous donor antisera. All three clones produced IFN-gamma and IL-2 in varying amounts upon antigenic stimulation in the presence of irradiated APC. Moreover, one clone RTg1, exhibited direct parasite cytotoxicity, inhibiting extracellular T. gondii by greater than 70% when incubated at an effector/target ratio of 40:1. This clone was alpha, beta TCR heterodimer positive and exerted its cytotoxic parasiticidal activity in the apparent absence of MHC restriction. The results provide evidence for the existence of circulating antigen-specific cytotoxic T cells in normal humans who are toxoplasma antibody seropositive.\r"

  ".W": "Cytokines produced by mononuclear cells are important regulatory and effector molecules and evidence has been presented to support a role at least for tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) in host defense against Leishmania. In the present study, we examined the production of TNF-alpha and interleukin 1 (IL-1) by resting and IFN-gamma-primed peripheral blood monocytes infected in vitro with Leishmania donovani. Monocytes produced neither IL-1 nor TNF-alpha during challenge with Leishmania. Cells preinfected with Leishmania synthesized normal amounts of TNF-alpha, but had diminished production of IL-1 in response to stimulation with either S. aureus or lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The induction by S. aureus or LPS of IL-1 beta mRNA accumulation in infected cells was normal despite diminished intracellular or supernatant IL-1 protein and bioactivity. Thus, inhibition of IL-1 production by Leishmania most probably reflected diminished translation of IL-1 beta mRNA. Pretreatment of cells with IFN-gamma abrogated infection-induced inhibition of IL-1 production and primed cells for the production of both IL-1 and TNF-alpha upon subsequent exposure to Leishmania. These results indicate that L. donovani has evolved the capacity to infect mononuclear phagocytes, without stimulating the production of two potentially host-protective monokines. The ability of IFN-gamma to prime monocytes to produce TNF-alpha and IL-1 in response to infection with Leishmania and to prevent inhibition of IL-1 production may have implications for immunotherapy with this lymphokine.\r"

Proteolytic activation of fVIII by thrombin results in fVIIIa heterotrimers lacking B domains (A1, A2, A3-C1-C2). In this study, immunoaffinity purified fVIII was further fractionated by mono S or mono Q chromatography to prepare heterodimers containing a light chain and an A1-A2-B heavy chain (fVIII 166/76) or an A1-A2 heavy chain (fVIII 82/76). Mass analysis of scanning transmission electron microscopic (STEM) images of fVIII 166/76 indicated that heterodimers (mass 237 +/- 20 kD) had irregularly globular core structures 10-12 nm across, and frequently displayed a diffuse, occasionally globular to ovoid satellite structure extending 5-14 nm from the core, and attached to it by a thin stalk. Factor VIII 82/76 molecules (mass 176 +/- 20 kD) had the same core structures as fVIII 166/76 molecules, but lacked the satellite structure. These findings indicate that A1-A2 domains of heavy chains and the light chains of the fVIII procofactor molecule are closely associated and constitute the globular core structure, whereas the B domainal portion of heavy chains comprises the peripheral satellite appendage. Factor VIII core structures commonly displayed a finger-like projection near the origin of the B domainal stalk that was also a consistent feature of the free heavy chains (mass 128-162 kD) found in fVIII 166/76 preparations. Factor VIII light chain monomers (mass, 76 +/- 16 kD) were globular to c-shaped particles 6-8 nm across. These chains commonly possessed a v-shaped projection originating from its middle region, that could also be observed at the periphery of fVIII core molecules. Factor VIIIa preparations contained heterotrimers (mass 162 +/- 13 kD) that had the same dimensions as fVIII core structures, lacked the B domainal appendage, and sometimes possessed the same core features as fVIII molecules. Molecular species corresponding to heterodimers (mass, 128 +/- 13 kD) and unassociated subunit chains (40-100 kD) were also observed in fVIIIa preparations, suggesting that heterotrimers have an appreciable tendency to dissociate, a phenomenon that could explain the decay of fVIIIa activity after thrombin activation of fVIII.\r"

The binding of lymphocyte function-associated (LFA) antigens 1 and 2, with their respective ligands, intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and LFA-3, which are expressed on the surface of nonlymphoid cells, has been shown to be critical for lymphocyte adhesion. To determine whether basal cell carcinomas (BCCs) can escape immunodetection as a result of the inability of cytotoxic T lymphocytes to bind tumor cells, the expression of adhesion molecules on numerous BCCs, before and after exposure to interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), was examined. Ninety-three percent of 30 freshly excised invasive BCCs did not express ICAM-1 and 73% of 11 BCCs did not express LFA-3. However, the normal-appearing basal keratinocytes in epidermis overlying nests of BCC, did express ICAM-1, particularly when a marked LFA-1+ and LFA-2+ dermal lymphocytic infiltrate was present. After BCC tissue was incubated in vitro with IFN-gamma the expression of ICAM-1 was induced on 85% of tumors studied. Thus tumor cells did not possess an absolute inability to express adhesion molecules; rather the constitutive absence of such molecules may be due to insufficient in vivo cytokine levels necessary to induce expression or a barrier preventing cytokines from reaching and interacting with tumor cells. We conclude that the absence of ICAM-1 and LFA-3 adhesion molecules is a mechanism by which BCCs can avoid immunosurveillance.\r"

Two other patients had stable disease and two had a minor response. The median duration of objective response was 32 weeks (range, 4 to 72); median survival for the 16 patients was 72 weeks. Hematologic toxicity was significant, with 88% developing a nadir granulocyte count of less than 1,000 cells per microliter (median, 300 cells per microliter), and 53% a nadir platelet count of less than 100,000 cells per microliter (median, 68,000 cells per microliter). Seven patients (44%) developed neutropenic fever, and three (18%) developed an increase in serum creatinine greater than 1.5 mg/dL during the course of treatment. This combination of chemotherapy was active; however, an increased response rate was not observed above that reported for other combinations. Response duration, or overall patient survival, on this intensive regimen was similar as compared with other published therapeutic trials of this disease entity.\r"

Clinical studies have attempted to establish a dose-response relationship to define optimal dosage ranges for induction of effector cell function and host response in patients with cancer. We conducted a randomized trial to test the in vivo biologic activity of five daily dosages ranging from 3 to 3,000 micrograms/m2, administered by daily 2-hour bolus injection or by continuous infusion for 14 days. We demonstrate comparable immunobiologic effects of recombinant IFN gamma (rIFN gamma; Biogen, Inc, Cambridge, MA) administered by these two schedules at the various dosages tested, and have defined a relationship of dose to biologic response over this 3-log10 dose range. Oligo 2'5' adenylate synthetase (2'5'As) induction, natural-killer (NK) cell activity, and T-cell subset distribution (heightened T helper/suppressor ratio) showed the most consistent treatment-associated changes and the greatest immunobiologic effects at dosages of 300 to 1,000 micrograms/m2. Mononuclear cell DR and DQ antigen expression showed no consistent dose-related treatment effect. The relevance of the phenotypic, functional, and enzymologic effects observed in this trial to any clinical antitumor effects of IFN gamma in cancer therapy must now be established.\r"

The purified 123I-Ro 16-0154 was found to be stable in rat brain preparations and to be metabolized in rat liver preparations. Its pharmacologic properties were comparable to those of flumazenil. The biodistribution in rats (1 hr postinjection) resulted in a high brain-to-blood ratio of 16. Clinical studies revealed images of the benzodiazepine receptor density in the brain. Since the receptor labeling was markedly reduced by injection of flumazenil, it was considered to be specific. Storage defects due to pathologic cerebral blood flow and changed receptor density were detected; this shows the potential usefulness of the substance for diagnostic purposes, e.g., the differential diagnosis of various forms of epilepsy.\r"

  ".W": "To compare the use of rice-based oral rehydration solution (R-ORS), with the introduction of food immediately after rehydration (\"early feeding\"), using standard glucose-based oral rehydration solution (G-ORS) in the management of acute diarrhea, we conducted a four-cell randomized, controlled trial among 200 hospitalized Egyptian infants between 3 and 18 months of age. During the rehydration phase (first 4 hours), three groups were given G-ORS and a fourth group was given R-ORS. During the subsequent maintenance phase, the control group was given a soy-based, lactose-free formula (G-ORS + SF), a second group (G-ORS + RF) was given a rice-based formula, and a third group (G-ORS + rice) was given boiled rice. The fourth group (R-ORS + SF) continued to receive R-ORS for the first 24 hours of the maintenance period, followed by a soy-based lactose-free formula. During the first and second 24 hours of the maintenance period, infants in the three treatment groups had a lower mean stool output in comparison with the control group (p = 0.006 and 0.03, respectively). The mean total stool output in the R-ORS + SF group was significantly lower than in the control group (p = 0.02). There were no statistically significant differences among the four groups in the mean duration of diarrhea. We conclude that (1) infants who were given R-ORS had reduced total stool output (by 35%) compared with the control group and (2) feeding of boiled rice or a rice-based formula immediately after rehydration therapy was as efficacious as treatment with R-ORS alone for 24 hours, followed by feeding with a soy-based, lactose-free formula.\r"

  ".W": "Because rice remains the most available carbohydrate in developing countries, where chronic diarrhea is most prevalent, we compared the in vitro hydrolysis and clinical tolerance of rice glucose polymer with those of corn glucose polymer. Rice glucose polymer hydrolysis to D-glucose and short-chain polymers (polymers with two to four glucose units and those with five or more units) was similar to that for corn glucose polymers during incubation with saliva or duodenal aspirates. However, rice glucose polymers yielded more short-chain products than corn glucose polymers during incubation with pooled mucosal homogenates (p less than 0.01). In vivo tolerance testing of 16 infants with chronic diarrhea confirmed that rice glucose polymers were well tolerated and, compared with corn glucose polymers, achieved a higher maximal increase of serum glucose concentration (36.6 +/- 7.3 vs 27.6 +/- 10.3 mg/dl; p less than 0.02), a shorter time to peak serum glucose concentration (34.0 +/- 10.2 vs 52.5 +/- 25.7 minutes; p less than 0.02), and a greater area under the serum glucose response curve at 30 minutes (538 +/- 131 vs 1035 +/- 501 cm; p less than 0.02). We conclude that rice glucose polymers are rapidly hydrolyzed in vitro and in vivo and are more rapidly absorbed than are corn glucose polymers in children with chronic diarrhea.\r"

Cytochrome c oxidase and other respiratory chain enzyme activities were normal biochemically. The patient also had renal tubular dysfunction, including isosthenuria, decreased urine-concentrating ability, and excessive excretion of potassium and magnesium. In addition, he had hyperreninemia and hyperaldosteronism but no hypertension. The renal dysfunction was thought to have resulted from a primary defect in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle, mimicking Bartter syndrome. In contrast to previously described cases of cytochrome c oxidase deficiency with de Toni-Fanconi Debre syndrome, the patient had less intensive muscle abnormalities. A renal biopsy specimen showed ultrastructural changes in mitochondria that were similar to those seen in biopsy specimens of muscle. A large-scale deletion (8.8 kilobases) in mitochondrial DNA was found in biopsy specimens of muscle and kidney.\r"

Indomethacin administration led to an instantaneous decrease in all infants of temporal mean flow velocity in the superior mesenteric artery, which was maximal 10 minutes after administration of indomethacin, followed by a more sustained recovery, slightly greater than baseline values, 12 hours after indomethacin treatment. Simultaneously determined temporal mean flow velocity of the anterior cerebral artery, used as an indicator of changes in cerebral blood flow, had a similar pattern as in the mean flow velocity in the superior mesenteric artery (r = 0.49; p less than 0.001). Our data suggest that indomethacin lowered blood supply to the bowel, similar to its action on cerebral blood flow.\r"

Among 2690 infants studied, 91% received at least one drug; 99% of infants weighing less than 1500 gm were exposed to drugs, compared with 90% of infants weighing more than 1500 gm. Among treated infants, the median number of drugs received was eight; the number of drugs administered was inversely related to birth weight and directly related to both length of hospital stay and the complexity of the infant's clinical condition. Within categories of length of hospital stay, the number of drugs received per day was greatest during the first week in the neonatal intensive care unit and fell to a relatively stable lower level during the second week. The most commonly used single drug was gentamicin (71% exposed), followed by sodium chloride (60%), potassium chloride (59%), heparin (58%), and packed erythrocytes (45%). Between 1978-1979 and 1985-1986 the prevalence of use increased substantially for some drugs (ampicillin, morphine, calcium salts, and acetates of sodium and potassium) and decreased for others (kanamycin, sodium bicarbonate, and blood products). These data document the dynamic nature of drug therapy in the neonatal intensive care unit and provide information that can guide cost-benefit assessments in this setting.\r"

The proliferation of the EC was determined by 3H-thymidine incorporation into the EC. The expression of HLA-DR antigen on the surface of the EC was detected by an indirect immunofluorescent method using a fluorescent flow cytometer. When GSTM was added at the start of the EC culture, GSTM at a low concentration could inhibit the proliferative response of the EC to endothelial cell growth supplement. Furthermore, when the EC were cultured with recombinant interferon-gamma (rIFN-gamma) and GSTM, GSTM was also able to suppress the HLA-DR antigen expression on the surface of EC induced by rIFN-gamma. On the time-kinetic study of the effects of GSTM on the HLA-DR antigen expression induced by rIFN-gamma, the pretreatment of GSTM was able to suppress the HLA-DR antigen expression, whereas GSTM did not affect the HLA-DR antigen expression already induced by rIFN-gamma. Our findings suggest that the therapeutic effects of gold compounds in patients with rheumatoid arthritis may be attributed to the interference of the proliferation and HLA-DR antigen expression of the EC.\r"

Our results suggest that pressures greater than or equal to 45 mm Hg, which we also observed during standing and walking, can cause synovial ischemia and hypoxia manifest in a perfusion/metabolic demand mismatch. Monitoring changes in SF concentrations of uric acid did not provide consistent evidence for accelerated purine degradation following periods of inadequate perfusion. Overall, our results suggest that synovial blood flow can be compromised by modest elevations in intraarticular pressure in the range encountered during daily activity in patients with knee effusions.\r"

However, the MT induced proliferative responses of the same BMC were similar in healthy controls and patients with RA. Neither the proliferative response nor the proteoglycan depletion was influenced by the presence of HLA-DR4 in the donor, whether patients with RA or healthy control. The proliferative responses of the RA BMC seemed to correlate inversely with the proteoglycan depletion.

We used this immunoassay to investigate the possible association between HCV infection and hepatocellular carcinoma in black and white residents of Los Angeles County, California. Serum samples from 51 patients (12 black and 39 white) in Los Angeles County with hepatocellular carcinoma and 128 control subjects (1 black and 127 white) were tested for the presence of anti-HCV. In addition, samples were tested for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), antibodies to the hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc), and antibodies to HBsAg (anti-HBs). Our results indicate that the presence of anti-HCV was a significant risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma; the relative risk was 10.5 (95% confidence limits = 3.5, 31.3). Hepatocellular carcinoma risk was also significantly related to the presence of one or more of the hepatitis B virus (HBV) markers, primarily HBsAg and anti-HBc, and the relative risk was 7.0 (95% confidence limits = 3.1, 16.1). HCV and HBV independently contributed to hepatocellular carcinoma development. Significantly increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma was demonstrated in individuals with HCV (relative risk = 4.8) or HBV (relative risk = 4.4) serologic markers alone. A synergistic effect on risk was observed when both hepatitis B and C viral markers were present in peripheral blood (10 cases vs. no controls). We estimate that approximately 47% of hepatocellular carcinoma occurring in black and white residents of Los Angeles County could be attributed to prior HCV and/or HBV infections: 9% were related to HCV alone, 20% to HBV alone, and 18% to occurrence of both HCV and HBV infections.\r"

  ".W": "A eukaryotic growth medium (Program Development Research Group Basal Growth Medium) was developed for CO2-independent maintenance and propagation of human and nonhuman tumor cell lines representing diverse histologies (e.g., cancers of the brain, colon, lung, ovary, and kidney, as well as leukemia and melanoma). It was also shown to be suitable for the maintenance and propagation of nontumor cells of human and nonhuman derivation. The medium derives its buffering capacity primarily from beta-glycerophosphate, exhibits a stable physiologic pH of 7.3-7.4, and is optimized to facilitate growth in atmospheric CO2. It is also useful in cellular growth and cytotoxicity assays based on either the metabolic reduction of tetrazolium reagents or protein staining. The 50% inhibitory concentration values obtained with carmustine, doxorubicin, and tamoxifen in cell lines maintained in the new medium under atmospheric CO2 were closely comparable to those obtained with these drugs against cells maintained in RPMI-1640 under a 5% CO2 environment.\r"

  ".W": "Outbreaks of acute hepatitis occurred in Huitzililla and Telixtac, two rural villages 70 miles south of Mexico City, Mexico, in late 1986. The first outbreak began in Huitzililla in June of that year, 1 month after the start of the rainy season. A census revealed 94 icteric case subjects, for an attack rate of 5%; two women died. Attack rates were higher for persons older than 15 years (10%) than for younger persons. A case-control study showed that illness was highly associated with water-related factors. The second outbreak began in August 1986 in Telixtac. There were 129 case subjects, for an attack rate of 6%; one woman died. Epidemiologic findings were similar to those in Huitzililla, except that most disease transmission was not linked to unsafe water sources. None of 62 case subjects in Huitzililla and only 2 of 53 case subjects in Telixtac tested had serological evidence for recent infection with hepatitis A or B. Two of eight stool samples from Huitzililla and one of the eight stool samples from Telixtac were positive by immune electron microscopy for 32- to 34-nm viruslike particles similar to those seen in cases of enterically transmitted non-A, non-B hepatitis from Asia. To our knowledge, these investigations document for the first time the epidemic transmission of enterically transmitted non-A, non-B hepatitis virus in the Americas.\r"

Serial computed tomographic scans of the abdomen are a valuable adjunct in confirming the diagnosis of bilateral adrenal hemorrhage, which manifests as round or oval adrenal masses of high density that subsequently decrease in both size and density. The diagnosis should be suspected in any complex highly stressful illness, in the postoperative period, or in the presence of a coagulopathy in conjunction with hypotension, fever, or electrolyte disturbances. Herein we describe five patients in whom the computed tomographic scans suggested or confirmed the presence of bilateral adrenal hemorrhage. In three of the five patients, the presence of a circulating lupus anticoagulant was demonstrated. Once the diagnosis of adrenal hemorrhage is suspected, steroid replacement therapy should be initiated promptly.\r"

  ".W": "A radioimmunoassay was used to detect antibodies to hepatitis C virus (anti-HCV) in 154 patients with haemophilia. Prevalence of anti-HCV was associated with exposure to clotting factor concentrates. 76 of 129 (59%) who had received factor VIII or IX had anti-HCV: 42 of 55 (76%) who required over 10,000 units of concentrate annually had anti-HCV, compared with 34 of 74 (46%) who required less, and 0 of 25 patients who had never received concentrates. Anti-HCV were significantly more common in patients seropositive for antibodies against human immunodeficiency virus (anti-HIV) or with markers of previous hepatitis B infection than in those without anti-HIV or hepatitis B markers (88% vs 39% and 75% vs 46%, respectively). 5 of 23 (22%) haemophiliacs treated only with heated concentrates had anti-HCV compared with 71 of 106 (67%) patients who received unmodified products. 35 patients with chronic liver disease underwent liver biopsy: histological examination showed features associated with post-transfusion hepatitis in 24, all of whom were anti-HCV-positive; of the other 11 patients with no histological features of non-A, non-B hepatitis, 5 were anti-HCV-positive. HCV appears to be the major predisposing factor for most non-A, non-B hepatitis and chronic liver disease in haemophilia.\r"

Tissue plasminogen activator was found, by antibody inhibition techniques, to be the activator of fibrinolysis in homogenates of control peritoneum (n = 6). Homogenates of control (n = 10) and inflamed peritoneum (n = 10) were analysed. Plasminogen activating activity was much lower in inflamed peritoneum (median 0.07 IU/cm2) than in control tissue (median 12.0 IU/cm2) (p less than 0.001). Levels of tissue plasminogen activator and alpha 2-antiplasmin were similar in both control and inflamed tissue. Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, not detectable in control peritoneum, was present in inflamed tissue and might be the reason for the reduction in functional fibrinolytic activity.\r"
