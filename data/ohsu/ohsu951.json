  ".W": "The presence and properties of serum autoantibodies against beta-adrenergic receptors in patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy were studied using synthetic peptides derived from the predicted sequences of the human beta-adrenergic receptors. Peptides corresponding to the sequences of the second extracellular loop of the human beta 1- and beta 2-adrenergic receptors were used as antigens in an enzyme immunoassay to screen sera from patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (n = 42), ischemic heart disease (n = 17), or healthy blood donors (n = 34). The sera of thirteen dilated cardiomyopathy patients, none of the ischemic heart disease patients, and four of the healthy controls monospecifically recognized the beta 1-peptide. Only affinity-purified antibodies of these patients had a inhibitory effect on radioligand binding to the beta 1 receptor of C6 rat glioma cells. They recognized the receptor protein by immunoblot and bound in situ to human myocardial tissue. We conclude that a subgroup of patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy have in their sera autoantibodies specifically directed against the second extracellular loop of the beta 1-adrenergic receptor. These antibodies could serve as a marker of an autoimmune response with physiological and/or pathological implications.\r"

Immature myeloid marrow cells (blasts and promyelocytes) have a higher level of this activity than do mature myeloid marrow cells (bands and polys). This activity, which is not detectable in the peripheral blood cells of normal individuals, is at least 50-fold higher in CML marrow blasts and promyelocytes than that found in marrow blasts and promyelocytes of normal individuals. This activity was inhibited by in vivo incubation of immature myeloid cells with the phosphatase inhibitor, sodium orthovanadate (0.2 mM), and by adding orthovanadate (20 mM) directly to cytoplasmic proteins of myeloid cells. Interferon-alpha (1,000 U/ml) reduced the effects of the CML myeloid cell cytoplasmic protein on the electrophoretic mobility of nuclear protein-DNA complexes. These data suggest that a unique phosphatase may be involved in the abnormalities in CML which are modulated by interferon-alpha.\r"

The MBP control region contains multiple cis-acting elements, shown by in vivo and in vitro assays, which are responsible for its unique pattern of transcription. Using synthetic DNA fragments spanning the MBP control region, we have analyzed nuclear proteins obtained from newborn (2-3 d), young adult (18-30 d), and adult (60 d) animals; these nuclear proteins form DNA-protein complexes with the MBP regulatory region. Brain extracts from young adult and adult mice showed enhanced binding activities with the sequences supporting transcriptional activation in glial cells. Deletion analysis of the proximal activating sequence located at position -14 to -50 with respect to the RNA initiation site resulted in identification of a small region, located between nucleotides -14 to -37, which is required for formation of the complexes. Southwestern assay revealed a major 39-kD protein from young adult brain extract that recognizes the sequences between nucleotides -14 to -37. An additional minor 37-kD protein, derived from young adult brain extract, was also found to be associated with this proximal activating region. Of particular interest is the observation that the minor 37-kD protein became more abundant in the extract derived from adult brain, whereas the major 39-kD protein became less abundant. The possible role of these proteins in cell/stage-specific transcription of MBP is discussed.\r"

This glycoprotein is expressed on the surface membrane of cells infected with HIV. It has, therefore, been suggested that a soluble form of CD4 might be used as a targeting agent to deliver toxins selectively to cells infected with HIV. We demonstrate that CD4-Pseudomonas exotoxin A (PE) conjugates inhibit the proliferation of gp160-transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells and block HIV replication in virus-infected H9 cells. However, this inhibition of HIV replication appears to be incomplete since virus replication occurs following removal of the toxin conjugates from these cultures. Moreover, CD4-PE conjugates delay but do not inhibit HIV replication in human peripheral blood lymphocytes. These studies suggest that such conjugates should be assessed only as potential adjunctive therapies in the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.\r"

  ".W": "Recent studies indicate that short-term cholesterol feeding causes vascular hyperreactivity and/or increased tone in certain vascular beds. The present study in rats examined the effect of 3 wk of cholesterol-supplemented diet (CSD) on renal hemodynamics. We tested the hypothesis that LDL oxidized in vivo is causally related to increased renal vascular tone by adding the antioxidant drug probucol to the CSD (CSD + P). Micropuncture of surface nephrons in the CSD rats demonstrated that single nephron glomerular filtration rate (SNGFR) and single nephron afferent plasma flow (QA) were markedly lower than in normal rats, whereas glomerular capillary pressure (PGC), afferent arteriolar resistance (RA), and single nephron filtration fraction (SNFF) were higher. In the CSD + P animals, almost all of these hemodynamic abnormalities were absent. TXB2 and PGE2 were increased in proximal tubule fluid and urine in the CSD rats, but normal in the CSD + P group. Infusion of a TXA2 receptor antagonist into the suprarenal aorta of CSD rats caused a rapid return to normal of RBF (renal blood flow), GFR (glomerular filtration rate), SNGFR, QA, RA, PGC, and Kf (ultrafiltration coefficient). Our observations demonstrate that cholesterol feeding leads to renal vasoconstriction, which appears to be mediated largely by increased TXA2 production. The fact that probucol prevented the hemodynamic abnormalities as well as the increased TX production is consistent with the hypothesis that LDL oxidized in vivo initiates events leading to TX mediated vasoconstriction.\r"

GP IIb-IIIa, vWF, and Fn are essential for normal platelet adherence to subendothelium. We added peptides to normal citrated whole blood before perfusion over human umbilical artery subendothelium and evaluated platelet adherence morphometrically at high (2,600 s-1) and low (800 s-1) wall shear rates. We also examined the effects of the peptides on platelet adhesion to collagen in a static system. At the high wall shear rate, RGDS and GQQHHLGGAKQAGDV caused dose-dependent reduction in the surface coverage with spread and adherent platelets. Amino acid transposition and conservative substitutions of RGD peptides and the AGDV peptide significantly inhibited platelet adherence at 2,600 s-1. By contrast, the modified RGD peptides and AGDV do not affect adhesive protein binding to platelets. None of the native or modified RGD- or fibrinogen gamma-chain peptides significantly inhibited either platelet adherence to subendothelium at 800 s-1 or platelet adhesion to collagen. Our findings demonstrate that peptides that interfere with adhesive protein binding to GP IIb-IIIa inhibit platelet adherence to vascular subendothelium with flowing blood only at high wall shear rates. Platelet adherence to subendothelium at high wall shear rates appears to be mediated by different recognition specificities from those required for fluid-phase adhesive protein binding or static platelet adhesion.\r"

Family studies suggest that this substitution was inherited from the individual's father who also produces abnormally migrating pro alpha 2(I) collagen chains and shares some of the abnormal skeletal features. This single base change creates a new Bsu36 I (Sau I, Mst II) restriction site detectable in genomic DNA by Southern blot analysis when probed with a COL1A2 fragment. The analysis of 52 control individuals (103 chromosomes) was negative for the new Bsu36 I site, suggesting that the substitution is not a common polymorphism.\r"

  ".W": "A membrane-bound cytochrome b, a heterodimer formed by a 91-kD glycoprotein (heavy chain) and a 22-kD polypeptide (light chain), is an essential component of the phagocyte NADPH-oxidase responsible for superoxide generation. Cytochrome b is absent in two subgroups of chronic granulomatous disease (CGD), an inherited disorder characterized by the lack of oxidase activity. Mutations in the cytochrome heavy chain gene, encoded by the CYBB locus in Xp21.1, result in the X-linked form of CGD. A rare subgroup of autosomal recessive CGD also lacks cytochrome b (A- CGD), but the genetic defect has not previously been identified. In order to search for possible mutations in the cytochrome light chain locus, CYBA, the structure of this gene was characterized. The CYBA locus was localized to 16q24, and the approximately 600-bp open reading frame determined to be encoded by six exons that span approximately 8.5 kb. Three unrelated patients with A- CGD were studied for evidence of mutations in the light chain gene. One patient, whose parents were first cousins, was homozygous for a large deletion that removed all but the extreme 5' coding sequence of the gene. The other two patients had a grossly normal light chain transcript on Northern blot of mononuclear cell RNA. The light chain transcript was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction and sequenced. One patient was a compound heterozygote for two alleles containing point mutations in the open reading frame that predict a frame shift and a nonconservative amino acid replacement, respectively. The second patient, whose parents were second cousins, was homozygous for a different single-base substitution resulting in another nonconservative amino acid change. These results indicate that A- CGD can results from defects in the gene encoding the 22-kD light chain of the phagocyte cytochrome b.\r"

This disruption stimulates epidermal lipid synthesis which is associated with the rapid restoration of stratum corneum lipids and barrier function. The aim of this study was to determine the role of cutaneous cholesterol synthesis in the barrier recovery. Here we show that topical lovastatin, a competitive inhibitor of HMG CoA reductase, inhibits cholesterol synthesis. After acetone disruption of the barrier, the normal rapid return of cholesterol to the stratum corneum and recovery of barrier function is impaired in animals treated topically with lovastatin. When lovastatin animals are simultaneously treated topically with either mevalonate, the immediate product of HMG CoA reductase, or cholesterol, the final end product of the pathway, the recovery of the barrier is normalized. Lovastatin resulted in the delayed secretion and abnormal appearance of lamellar bodies. These results provide the first evidence demonstrating that cholesterol synthesis is required for the maintenance of barrier structure and function and suggests a crucial role for cholesterol synthesis in allowing for terrestrial existence.\r"

We have also shown that apo B is secreted as a phosphoprotein and that phosphorylation is increased in hypoinsulinemic nonketotic diabetes. The present studies were conducted to determine whether the ability of insulin to inhibit apo B secretion is related to alterations in apo B turnover and whether insulin itself affects apo B phosphorylation. Pulse-chase studies with [35S]methionine in primary cultures of hepatocytes from normal rats in the absence and presence of insulin show that the secretion of apo B100 and apo B48 are inhibited by insulin and that this inhibition may be due in part to enhanced intracellular degradation. In addition, there is a second intracellular apo B48 pool which is not insulin regulated or degraded. In experiments in which hepatocytes were incubated with [32P]orthophosphate, insulin decreased 32P incorporation into apo B100 (42%) with only small effects on apo B48 (11%). The small insulin effect on apo B48 may relate to an insulin-insensitive apo B48 intracellular pool. These studies show that insulin can affect the intracellular turnover, secretion, degradation, and phosphorylation of apo B and emphasize the differential regulation of apo B100 and apo B48 with regard to these parameters in rat liver.\r"

The recent isolation and expression of the full-length cDNA encoding alpha-GalNAc facilitated the identification of the molecular lesions in the affected brothers from family D, the first cases described with this autosomal recessive disease. Southern and Northern hybridization analyses of DNA and RNA from the affected homozygotes revealed a grossly normal alpha-GalNAc gene structure and normal transcript sizes and amounts. Therefore, the alpha-GalNAc transcript from an affected homozygote was reverse-transcribed, amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and sequenced. A single G to A transition at nucleotide 973 was detected in multiple subclones containing the PCR products. This point mutation resulted in a glutamic acid to lysine substitution in residue 325 (E325K) of the alpha-GalNAc polypeptide. The base substitution was confirmed by dot blot hybridization analyses of PCR-amplified genomic DNA from family members with allele-specific oligonucleotides. Furthermore, transient expression of an alpha-GalNAc construct containing the E325K mutation resulted in the expression of an immunoreactive polypeptide which had no detectable alpha-GalNAc activity.\r"

Epidemiologic data has linked the syndrome to intake of L-tryptophan (L-TRP) from one specific manufacturer, but the precise etiologic compound(s) must be established by replication of the syndrome in an appropriate animal model. In this study, implicated L-TRP, United States Pharmacopeia (USP) grade L-TRP, or vehicle was administered by gavage in a blinded fashion for 38 d to female Lewis rats at doses comparable with those ingested by patients who developed the eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome. Animals receiving implicated L-TRP, but not those receiving USP grade L-TRP or vehicle, developed histologic signs consistent with fasciitis and perimyositis, specific pathologic features of human L-TRP-EMS. Peripheral blood eosinophilia was not observed. Hypothalamic corticotropin releasing hormone mRNA levels were lower and plasma corticosterone levels tended to be lower in the animals that received implicated L-TRP. Plasma L-kynurenine was higher in both L-TRP-treated groups compared to the vehicle-treated animals. The female Lewis rat is known to be susceptible to a wide variety of inflammatory diseases. Identification of specific inflammatory changes in this rat following exposure to implicated L-TRP indicates that this animal model will be important in subsequent investigations into the etiology, pathogenesis, and treatment of human L-TRP-EMS.\r"

NO mediates the action of substances that induce endothelium-dependent relaxation and plays a role in regulating blood pressure. In this study we investigated whether NO is involved in the pathogenesis of the bleeding tendency associated with renal failure. Rats with extensive surgical ablation of renal mass develop renal insufficiency due to progressive glomerulosclerosis. Like uremic humans, rats with renal mass reduction and uremia have a bleeding tendency that manifests itself by a prolonged bleeding time. We found that N-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA), a specific inhibitor of NO formation from L-arginine, completely normalized bleeding time when given to uremic rats. L-NMMA injection also increased ex vivo platelet adhesion but did not affect ex vivo platelet aggregation induced by adenosine diphosphate, arachidonic acid, and calcium ionophore A23187. The shortening effect of L-NMMA on bleeding time was completely reversed by giving the animals the NO precursor L-arginine, but not D-arginine, which is not a precursor of NO. It thus appears that NO is a mediator of the bleeding tendency of uremia.\r"

Spearman's correlation coefficient revealed moderate correlations between energy expenditure and corresponding levels of self-assessed leisure-time physical activity for each single-item question (r = 0.14 to 0.41). For purposes of measuring prevalence of physical activity, the energy expenditure variable was used to categorize individuals into activity levels. The single-item questions were found to have Spearman's correlations with the categorical measures ranging from 0.11 to 0.37 for leisure-time activities. Generally higher correlations were found for males and younger age groups (18-34 years). The relationships were interpreted as being weak relative to an expected correlation of 0.75 for criterion validation.

The prevalence of depressed mood for the total population was 5.2%. Women exhibited a significantly higher mean depressive symptom score and a prevalence rate almost twice that of men. Depressive symptoms were associated with several risk factors in both sexes, including age, self-perception of current health status, number of reported chronic diseases and medications and amount of exercise. However, the relationship between physical illness and depressive symptoms appeared to differ by sex with respect to the nature of the disease or disability and the type of medication currently used. These findings indicate that the risk of depression does not diminish with age among the elderly as other studies have suggested.\r"

  ".W": "Routine maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (MSAFP) screening for neural tube defects is considered by many to be standard obstetrical care, and recently many have encouraged this test to screen for Trisomy-21 (Down's syndrome). We questioned whether, after a normal MSAFP screen, the risk of Trisomy-21 decreases enough to warrant modifying the recommended age for genetic amniocentesis for Down's syndrome. A logistic regression was developed which, using reported values for sensitivity and specificity for MSAFP detection of Trisomy-21 and assuming a constant threshold risk in opting for amniocentesis, indicates that genetic amniocentesis for Trisomy-21 may be deferred in some women who have a normal MSAFP screening. Sensitivity analysis of varying thresholds for a normal MSAFP demonstrates that a 37 year old woman with a median MSAFP level has the same risk for Trisomy-21 as an unscreened women who is 4.5 years younger. An abnormal MSAFP is useful in screening for neural tube defects and possibly for Trisomy-21. A normal MSAFP may allow for delaying the potentially risky amniocentesis in otherwise low-risk pregnancies.\r"

  ".W": "Relations between lipoprotein indices and the waist/hip ratio (WHR) were examined in normoglycemic subjects (124 women and 63 men). Among women, an atherogenic lipoprotein pattern was strongly associated with WHR. The relation was greater than that of the lipoprotein pattern with either the body mass index or the subscapular/triceps ratio, and was independent of these adiposity measures. The association between low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-cholesterol) and WHR was much stronger in thinner women than in those more obese (r = 0.64 vs r = 0.22, p = 0.001 for difference). Men had a more atherogenic lipoprotein pattern than women; however, with allowances for WHR the lipoprotein patterns were similar. These findings suggest that: (1) WHR is more strongly related to plasma lipoproteins than other adiposity measures; (2) there is effect modification by the extent of adiposity for the relation between LDL-cholesterol and WHR; and (3) the adipose distribution may be important in explaining lipoprotein differences between men and women.\r"

The kappa statistic for concordance of the retrospective and baseline reports was used as a summary measure of the individual's ability to reproduce his or her earlier diet report. Reproducibility was estimated for total diet, represented by 83 foods, and for 9 subsets of foods of epidemiologic interest. In bivariate and multivariate analyses, reproducibility was strongly related to stability of diet; those whose diets changed least over the 15-year period had greatest diet reproducibility. Greater total diet reproducibility was also found among men with higher education, among women of less than 110% desirable weight reporting no special diet and among women reporting no medications. Consistent with current models of memory, the retrospective report of diet was strongly related to the current report of diet. Agreement between the retrospective and baseline diet reports was greater than agreement between the current and baseline diet reports. This indicates that, as a proxy for past diet, the retrospective report of diet is superior to the current report. Similar relationships were found for the 9 subset of foods.\r"

In this study we use nonparametric multiple logistic regression to examine the relationship between gestational age, neonatal size and neonatal death. On its own, gestational age was nonlinearly associated with neonatal death. This nonlinearity disappeared with the addition of birth weight, crown heel length and head circumference. Birth weight, head circumference and crown heel length all had significant nonlinear associations with neonatal death in univariate analysis. With all factors in the model, birth weight and head circumference were nonlinearly associated with neonatal death and crown heel length was linearly associated with neonatal death. The complex relations between gestational age, neonatal size and neonatal death were explored with greater ease with nonparametric logistic regression.\r"

We investigated the utilization of preventive services in two prepaid Medicaid Competition Demonstration programs in Santa Barbara County, Calif., and Jackson County, Mo. (containing the city of Kansas City). Care in the demonstration sites was compared with care given in similar counties functioning under a traditional fee-for-service Medicaid system--Ventura County, Calif., and St Louis, Mo. We tested the hypothesis that preventive care would be less in the capitated demonstrations. 2735 Children's and 3389 adult's charts were abstracted for care received during the calendar year 1985, after the prepaid demonstration had been in place for more than 1 year. No significant differences were found between the demonstration and comparison counties in the proportion of children with complete DPT or OPV immunizations at 1 year of age, with 56% complete in both California counties and 69 and 65% complete in Jackson County and St Louis, respectively. Regression analysis demonstrated a slight, but statistically significant trend towards more immunizations in the demonstration counties. Pap smear use in women of 15-44 years of age was little different in the California counties, but significantly greater in the Jackson County demonstration in Missouri (64 vs 45%). Physician breast examinations were somewhat more likely to occur in the prepaid, case managed demonstration counties. Capitated, case managed systems for the AFDC Medicaid population appear to result in no diminution of preventive services. Substantial problems exist in this, as in other poor populations, in childhood immunizations.\r"

The results of 12 studies have now been reported and produced differing results and conclusions. Because of the discrepancy in results and the importance of the issue we undertook a review of the studies and performed a meta-analysis. In all, 9 independent studies satisfied the criteria for selection, 6 case-control design and 3 longitudinal. Using standard meta-analysis techniques, the overall pooled odds ratio for all the studies was 0.68 for the crude results (95% CI 0.58-0.78) and 0.73 for the adjusted results (95% CI 0.61-0.85). The graphical odd-man-out method produced a 94% interval of 0.70-0.72. The pooled odds ratio of the case-control studies was lower than for the longitudinal studies. However, subdividing studies by the type of case source produced a pooled odds ratio for studies using hospital-based cases of 0.49 (95% CI 0.39-0.63) which was considerably less than that of studies using population-based cases: 0.95 (0.78-1.16). This difference was unlikely to have explained by bias due to selection of controls. We suggest that OCP use may not have a \"protective effect\" on the development of RA but may prevent the progression to severe disease by modifying the disease process.\r"

  ".U": "91056351\r", 
  ".W": "As part of an ongoing epidemiologic study, the death rate and causes of death during 1975 through 1984 were determined in Pima Indians who resided in the Gila River Indian Community (GRIC) in 1965 and later. Death certificates were available for 677 of the 681 deaths. In 78% of the deaths, the underlying cause recorded on the death certificate agreed with the cause determined after review of all available relevant records. The age- and sex-adjusted average annual death rate for the GRIC population (1639/100,000) was 1.9 times (95% CI 1.7-2.0) the 1980 rate for the U.S. all races (878/100,000). In Pima males, whose death rate was substantially higher than that of Pima females, the age-adjusted death rate was 2.3 times that in U.S. males, all races. Moreover among males 25-34 years of age, the Pima death rate was 6.6 times that for the U.S. all races. Diseases of the heart and malignant neoplasms caused 59% of U.S. deaths in 1980, but only 19% of GRIC deaths. By contrast, the age- and sex-adjusted mortality rate in the GRIC Pima was 5.9 times the rate of the U.S. all races for accidents, 6.5 times for cirrhosis, 7.4 times for homicide, 4.3 times for suicide, and 11.9 times for diabetes. Tuberculosis and coccidioidomycosis were important causes of death in the Pima, for whom infectious diseases was the tenth leading cause of death. The findings indicate that programs to improve the adverse mortality experience of the GRIC population should emphasize factors related to fatal accidents, alcoholic cirrhosis, homicide, suicide, diabetes mellitus, and infectious diseases. Young Pimas, especially the males, should be the primary focus of such preventive efforts. These findings and recommendations probably apply to many Native American populations.\r"

The reports consisted of single-page, computer-generated summaries of scores derived from either the AIMS (Arthritis Impact Measurement Scales) or the MHAQ (Modified Health Assessment Questionnaire) health status questionnaires. A total of 1920 subjects from 27 community practice sites were randomly assigned to three study groups in each practice: intervention, attention placebo and control. Results showed that 55% of the physicians found the reports to be at least moderately useful as an aid to patient management, primarily for improving the doctor-patient relationship. However, no detectable differences among the three groups were seen in terms of medication compliance, number of physician visits, number of referrals, frequency of major medication changes, attitudes towards the physician, patient satisfaction or change in health status over 1 year. The failure to demonstrate objective benefits of health status reports in this study may be due to physician unfamiliarity with health status scores, failure to link the report with an office visit, the relative stability of clinical status in the subjects over 1 year and the relatively short time-frame of the study.\r"

Insufficient data were available from these studies to analyze possible relationships between baldness and CAD risk factors themselves. Overall, the data reviewed suggest that a small risk of CAD due to baldness may exist, but this risk is smaller than that of well-known CAD risk factors such as smoking and hypertension. Future research should emphasize proper control for age and CAD risk factors.\r"

The mean number of the nine habits exhibited was four. The total number of habits did not correlate well with serum cholesterol, as 27% of the individuals with none of the nine fat intake habits had blood cholesterol values greater than 6.2 mmol/L (239 mg/100 mL), while only 17% of the individuals with seven habits had the high level of cholesterol. These nine habits explained less than 10% of the variability of serum cholesterol values.\r"

Ideally, the goals and objectives are well defined at the outset, and these guide the development of the survey content and statistical design. Because the needs for information are so great, criteria need to be developed for evaluating which topics will be included in the survey and what tests will be used. In planning the NHANES III, the evaluation criteria used were the scientific merit of the topic, its public health importance, its practical utility to the government, and the feasibility of implementing it within the survey's mode of operation. After the topics to be covered in a survey have been selected, questionnaires and examination protocols are developed, pilot tested, and revised prior to implementing the survey. Procedures are established for providing for informed consent and assuring the confidentiality of findings.\r"

New and developing nonclinical indicators include the relative dose response (RDR) test or a modification (MRDR) of it, conjunctival impression cytology (CIC), and isotope dilution to estimate total body reserves. These methods, all of which are promising, require additional work to verify their sensitivity, specificity, and predictive power as indicators of relative states of vitamin A depletion for individuals and populations under the many varied conditions commonly associated with an inadequate vitamin status. Currently, the most reliable assessment of vitamin A nutriture is likely when a combination of methods is used.\r"

The recommended daily allowance (RDA) for vitamin D in the United States of 200 IU (5.0 micrograms) is reasonable for adults who receive some exposure to sunlight; however, in the absence of any exposure to sunlight, this recommendation may be 2 to 3 times lower than that actually required to satisfy the body's needs. Vitamin D was first measured by bioassays. However, bioassays became obsolete in light of the revelation that vitamin D must be activated first in the liver to 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OH-D) and then in the kidney to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25(OH)2D] before becoming biologically functional. Current assays measure circulating concentrations of vitamin D, 25-OH-D or 1,25(OH)2D. The serum vitamin D concentration is of value for determining the role of sunlight in producing vitamin D in skin and as a provocative test to determine the absorption of vitamin D in patients with malabsorption syndromes. The serum concentration of 25-OH-D is most valuable for determining the overall vitamin D status of an individual, since it is an average of dietary and sunlight-induced vitamin D. The measurement of the serum 1,25(OH)2D concentrations has been most useful in evaluating disorders in calcium and bone metabolism related to acquired and inborn errors in the conversion of 25-OH-D to 1,25(OH)2D.\r"

Fasting urinary calcium:creatinine ratios may hold promise as an easy, inexpensive method to indicate recent calcium status. Calcium status may best be assessed by integrated measures of calcium assimilation, such as total-body calcium. Although bone-mass measurements do not correlate well with recent dietary intakes of calcium, long-term adequacy of calcium intake influences bone mass. Whether low calcium intakes lead to calcium deficiencies depends on one's ability to adapt and conserve calcium. The relationship between calcium status and a particular disease state, such as osteoporosis, hypertension, or colon cancer, cannot be established until a reliable indicator of calcium status is found.\r"

  ".W": "Plasma zinc concentration has been denigrated as a measure of zinc status because it responds to metabolic conditions unrelated to zinc status and because it is insensitive to changes in dietary zinc. The insensitivity of plasma zinc to reductions in dietary zinc reflects the tremendous capacity of the organism to conserve tissue zinc by reductions in zinc excretion and/or reductions in the rate of growth. Changes in plasma zinc concentrations do not seem to occur until the capacity to reestablish homeostasis by reducing excretion and/or growth has been exceeded. Reductions in dietary zinc beyond the capacity to maintain homeostasis lead to utilization of zinc from a small, rapidly turning over pool. This pool is located, at least in part, in the bone, liver, and plasma. Loss of a small, critical amount of zinc from this pool leads to the rapid onset of both biochemical and clinical signs of zinc deficiency. Thus, plasma zinc is a valid, useful indicator of the size of this exchangeable pool of zinc. Plasma metallothionein concentrations may prove useful for identifying poor zinc status. Plasma metallothionine concentrations reflect hepatic concentrations and, therefore, are reduced when the dietary zinc supply is low. However, since hepatic metallothionein concentrations rise in response to stress, plasma metallothionein concentrations are increased in this state when the plasma zinc concentrations are also likely to be low. Thus, measurement of both plasma metallothionein and plasma zinc concentrations could differentiate a low plasma zinc due to dietary zinc deficiency from a low concentration due to stress, infection, or other metabolic conditions.\r"

Newer analytical techniques, especially high-performance liquid chromatography, allow determination of reduced (ascorbic acid), oxidized (dehydroascorbic acid), or total amounts of vitamin C in biological specimens or foods. Plasma levels of vitamin C forms are easily determined but may not reflect tissue content as well as leukocyte levels. The vitamin C content of leukocyte cell types varies severalfold and, unlike plasma, leukocytes may contain an appreciable fraction of dehydroascorbic acid. The effects of sex, age, cigarette smoking, drugs, and physiological factors on vitamin C levels are better known for plasma than leukocytes. To realize the potential of leukocytes as measures of vitamin C status, continued work is needed in standardizing the methodology and interpretive guidelines and simplifying the technique for blood processing. The search for specific functional markers of vitamin C deficiency should continue. Candidate markers may involve pathways of carnitine or collagen metabolism, immunocompetence, or antioxidant defense.\r"

Iron deficiency, chronic disease and thalassemia traits are the three leading causes of microcytic anemia. The true cause of anemia must always be sought so that the prevalence estimates of iron deficiency are accurate and so that appropriate treatment can be initiated for the anemic individual. In both the clinical setting and in surveys, the most frequent differential diagnosis of microcytic anemia will involve distinguishing between iron deficiency and chronic disease. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), zeta-sedimentation rate (ZSR), and C-reactive protein (CRP) are elevated in a variety of diseases. These indicators may help differentiate the anemia of chronic disease from iron deficiency, so that iron deficiency is not overestimated in hospitalized and aged populations. The red cell distribution width (RDW) appears to be elevated to a greater extent in iron deficiency than in chronic disease or thalassemia traits. RDW and CRP are two of several indicators of iron status in the third National Health and Examination Survey (NHANES III).\r"

Investigators have therefore developed survey methods, physiological markers, and mechanical or electrical monitors for use in the field. The development of the doubly labeled water method for measuring energy expenditure and increased availability of room indirect calorimeters has recently made it possible to evaluate these field techniques. Some of the recently developed mechanical and electrical monitors have been found to be valid for the measurement of energy expenditure, but even the best provide measures that are too variable to be useful on an individual basis.\r"

Each of these approaches has advantages and limitations. Biochemical evaluation has the potential of being the most objective and quantitative. Indicators that have been or might be used include plasma hormone responses to reduced protein intake, plasma levels of specific proteins or specific amino acids, urinary excretion of specific amino acids and other nitrogen-containing compounds, anthropometric and physical measurements of body muscle mass, and functional tests of muscle strength. Several measurements can be combined to produce nutritional indices of broader potential value. The importance of concomitant infection and inflammation, with its many effects on protein metabolism, cannot be ignored in making these assessments. Unfortunately, no single test or group of tests can be recommended at this time as a routine and reliable indicator of protein status. Nonetheless, our increasing knowledge of the metabolism and functions of proteins, together with the recent use of noninvasive stable isotope techniques and of sophisticated physicochemical measurements, provides encouragement that more appropriate indicators are in the offing.\r"

Indices for vitamin B-6 status can be separated into direct and indirect measures. Among the direct measures, plasma pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) is considered the most relevant. However, measurement of plasma pyridoxal or total vitamin B-6 and urinary 4-pyridoxic acid are also recommended. Indirect measures of vitamin B-6 include the assessment of urinary excretion of xanthurenic acid following a tryptophan load. This is a valid functional index for otherwise healthy persons. Evaluation of erythrocyte transaminase activity and stimulation with PLP provide an estimate of vitamin B-6 intake over an extended period of time. In addition to biochemical measures, determination of vitamin B-6 and protein intake are necessary. Present evidence suggests plasma PLP, urinary 4-pyridoxic acid, at least one indirect measure, and the intake of vitamin B-6 and protein are needed to properly assess vitamin B-6 status. The levels of plasma pyridoxal and erythrocyte PLP are newer measures of status and, with further refinement of methodology, may provide additional insight into vitamin B-6 status.\r"

The first stage of folate depletion can be assessed by measuring serum folate levels, which drop prior to tissue depletion, and which are paralleled by a reduction in red blood cell (RBC) folate. Functional changes associated with abnormalities in biochemical pathways can be monitored by the deoxyuridine suppression test. Cell division, including erythropoiesis, becomes impaired in the same time sequence as changes in biochemical functions, as evidenced by abnormal erythrocyte morphology and a reduction in hemoglobin concentration. In addition to inadequate dietary folate intake, key factors that may impair folate utilization and thus status include alcohol consumption, smoking, and specific drugs. Folate requirements may increase during various phases of the life cycle due to physiological stresses such as pregnancy and lactation. Folate status may also be compromised during adolescence and in senescence for diverse reasons that require special emphasis on factors such as biological maturity and socioeconomic status, as well as chronic use of alcohol, drugs, and smoking.\r"

These systems provide highly useful information, but also present significant methodological challenges relating to representativeness, quality control, and indicator sensitivity/specificity. As the importance of nutritional risk factors for chronic disease is increasingly recognized, the concept of nutrition surveillance must be expanded beyond maternal and child nutrition to include nutrition-related behaviors and risk factors in adolescents and adults. The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), coordinated by CDC, collects telephone survey data that include information on nutrition-related issues such as overweight, weight-loss practices, and cholesterol screening. In addition, a school-based surveillance system is being established by CDC in coordination with state education agencies to assess adolescent health behaviors, including nutrition.

There is no best indicator, best measure of an indicator, or best analysis of an indicator in a generic sense. The definition of \"best\" depends ultimately on what is most appropriate for the decision that must be made. This paper gives examples.\r"

Survey findings have implications for policies and programs related to food production and marketing, food safety, food assistance, and nutrition education. Until 1965, these surveys measured household food consumption only, but subsequent surveys were expanded to include food intakes by individuals in the sample households. Since 1985, small-scale continuing surveys of food intakes by individuals have been conducted during the years between the large decennial surveys. The 1-d recall was used in the first dietary intake survey. Then, to capture day-to-day variation in diets, 3 d of intake data, 1-d recall and 2-d records, were collected in 1977-1978, 1987-1988, and 1989. Prior to the 1977-1978 dietary intake survey, USDA embarked upon an intensive program of extramural research that was designed to improve methodologies for surveying individuals' dietary intakes. Since 1975, many major investigations have been completed and results have been incorporated in current survey procedures. Studies included testing of varied recall and diary methods, approaches for validating survey data, debriefings of survey respondents and interviewers, intersurvey comparisons, and testing of panel approaches with in-person, telephone, and mail contacts.\r"

An automated system is also used to update the survey nutrient data base with new information released from the Nutrient Data Bank. This system includes three supplementary data sets (primary nutrient data set, recipe file, and table of nutrient retention factors) and a computer program for calculating nutrient content of mixed food items based on nutrient content of their ingredients. Updates are performed at the beginning of new surveys to incorporate the most up-to-date nutrient values.\r"

Instruments were designed to measure population-based food insecurity and to ask respondents to provide information about their socioeconomic status and disabilities as well as the extent to which they have formal or informal assistance in obtaining food. The need to collect this information has been linked to a state-wide effort to target city nutritionally needy elderly for home-delivered meals. Findings have been that food insecurity in the inner-city homebound is linked to loss of mobility as well as to poverty and lack of in-home food assistance. Minority elderly whose questionnaire responses indicate food insecurity include diabetics whose disease control is adversely affected by irregular eating. When methods of home assessment have been used to examine the extent to which a home-delivered meals program meets the nutritional needs of recipients, it has been possible to demonstrate that meals recipients show less food insecurity than a comparison group on waiting lists to receive meals.\r"

The first phase of the research used qualitative methods to derive a socially-appropriate definition of hunger. Thirty-two women in Upstate New York were interviewed regarding their experience with food problems and hunger. The interviews were analyzed using the constant comparative method. Results indicated that women had a narrow and a broad concept of hunger. The narrow concept focused on going without food for a specified period of time and the physical sensation of hunger. The broad one included two dimensions: household and individual hunger. Each had quantitative, qualitative, psychological, and social components. The second phase of the research used survey methodology to examine the validity and reliability of items designed to measure the conceptual definition of hunger. The survey was administered to 189 women in Upstate New York who participated in programs designed for low-income households or households in need of food. The second phase confirmed the conceptualization of hunger developed in the first phase. A subset of valid and reliable items that represented each of the major dimensions and components of hunger was identified as being useful for monitoring and assessing hunger.\r"

Study II involved a cross-sectional survey of 377 male outpatients attending two clinics at the St. Louis Veterans Administration Medical Center. Study III involved a cross-sectional survey of 424 community-dwelling elderly in Houston, Texas. Internal consistency reliability coefficients ranged between 0.47 and 0.60, and test-retest reliability coefficients ranged between 0.65 and 0.71. Validity was established by using the NRI to predict the use of health services, as well as by correlating it with a variety of anthropometric, laboratory, and clinical markers of nutritional status. The utility of the NRI for future applications is discussed.\r"

From a review of the literature on HIV regulatory genes and from preliminary mathematical models of HIV dynamics at four levels (host population epidemiology, the immune system, gene regulation within infected cells, and selection of mutants) we have arrived at the theory that in the etiology of HIV the HIV cytopathic effect may actively be caused by a viral regulatory gene product. The most likely candidate is the rev regulatory protein. Rev and the analogous rex protein from HTLV-I (human T cell leukemia virus) both have two active sites with similar function: one site locates the protein in the nucleus/nucleolus, and the other site interacts with viral mRNAs, facilitating their export from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Rev seems to have a third functional site near the 3' end. We conjecture that this site may be responsible for the cytopathic effect. We think that rev acts on cellular genes that normally induce senescence and cell death during development, or T-cell maturation, or on terminal differentiation. We propose that mathematical and computer models of the immune system could be used to explore whether suppression of the cytopathic action of the rev protein could be of therapeutic benefit in restoring the ability of the immune system to clear HIV or at least to extend latency. We also suggest how immune deficiency disease might be created as laboratory artifact in animal populations.\r"

In this article we give mathematical equations of threshold conditions that connect infectivity, length of host survival, and frequency of acts conducive to transmission.

This protein is expressed by a doubly spliced mRNA encoding an additional protein, p21rex. p27rex has been shown to increase the amount of unspliced viral mRNAs encoding envelope and capsid proteins. To assess a possible contribution of p21rex to the rex regulation, a point mutation was introduced into the p21rex initiation codon. Expression of env and gag plasmids, transfected in Jurkat cells, was dependent only upon p27rex expression and was not affected by the absence of p21rex. Consequently, the rex regulation of the HTLV-1 structural genes can be solely attributed to the p27rex protein.\r"

CMV-related neurologic disease was suspected on clinical grounds and was subsequently confirmed by CMV culture from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and/or CMV in situ hybridization on specific specimens. All four patients showed CSF pleocytosis with predominance of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs). Retrospective analysis of the results of CSF examination, performed in 143 of 241 patients with neurologic symptoms, showed pleocytosis in 58 of 143 patients. Predominance of PMNs was found in seven patients, including the four with CMV polyradiculomyelitis. It is concluded that in HIV-1 seropositive patients with a clinical diagnosis of polyradiculomyelitis, a predominance of PMNs in CSF could be an indication that the condition is CMV related. This should lead to early diagnosis and institution of specific antiviral therapy.\r"

HIV-1 was isolated by coculturing of patient peripheral blood mononuclear leukocytes (PBMCs) with normal blood donor target PBMCs that had been stimulated with phytohemagglutinin and interleukin-2. The HIV-1 isolation success rate at Walter Reed increased progressively each year from 1986 to 1989. In 1989, HIV-1 was isolated from a single blood specimen from patients in Walter Reed stages 1-2, 3-4, and 5-6 in 75% (49/65), 90% (37/41), and 97% (30/31) of cases, respectively. None of 22 blinded negative control specimens was positive. PBMC cultures from late stage patients regularly became positive within 7 days (92%), compared to only 46% of positive cultures from early stage patients. For most patients, the lowest number of serially diluted PBMCs that resulted in a positive culture was 30,000 patient PBMCs, but the range was 300 to 3 million cells. HIV-1 was isolated less frequently from plasma (5/18, 28%). Plasma viremia was detected only in patients with relatively high titers of infected PBMCs. Forty-six blood specimens from \"at-risk\" seronegative adults were also cocultured; none was positive.\r"

  ".W": "Because the period from infection to clinically apparent disease is long, variable, and changing as new therapies are developed and applied, AIDS data are inadequate for tracking current values of critical parameters of HIV infection epidemics: prevalence of infection, rate of acquisition of new infections (incidence rate), and direction and rate of change of infection incidence over time (acceleration). These \"vital signs\" of infection epidemics can be tracked using serial cross-sectional seroprevalence data, however. From October 1985 through September 1989, more than 2.3 million applicants for U.S. military service were screened for antibody to HIV. The overall seroprevalence was 1.31 per 1,000 (3,014/2,300,675). Seroprevalences were highest near urban centers of the AIDS epidemic and were independently associated with age, race/ethnicity, and gender. Based on age seroprevalence trends, it was crudely estimated that at least one of 2,000 young men and one of 7,000 young women are infected with HIV annually in the U.S. Infection incidence rates, estimated from age and temporal trends, were estimated to be highest among black males (1.40/1,000/year) and lowest among white females (0.03/1,000/year). Poisson regression analysis of seroprevalence trends suggested that infection incidence rates accelerated among black females during the first 3 years of screening. Since selection factors undoubtedly changed over the period, estimates based on these data probably underestimate actual values in the general population, particularly near urban AIDS epicenters. Nonetheless, even crude estimates of these critical values, particularly among adolescents and young adults, are useful to guide policy development, to allocate resources, and to monitor program effects.\r"

Rather, relapse from safer sex techniques is now the predominant predominant kind of high-risk sex, accounting for approximately two thirds of all prevalent high-risk sex in the 1988 wave of data collection. Predictors of relapse from safer sex are identified, and these are discussed in terms of their implications for preventing relapse from the exclusive practice of safe sex. In communities that have already manifested widespread behavioral risk reductions and in which HIV infection is highly prevalent, finding ways to prevent relapse of behavioral risk reductions will be the next important challenge in the fight against acquired immune deficiency syndrome.\r"

None of these sera reacted with native HIV-1 antigens or synthetic peptides homologous to gp41. Sera with an indeterminate HIV-2 Western blot did not react with gp36-derived synthetic peptides. Although 10 of them also displayed an indeterminate HIV-1 Western blot, no serum sample reacted with two gp41-derived synthetic peptides or proved to be positive when they tested for p24 antigen.

  ".W": "The effects of L-tyrosine (L-TYR) on the anorectic activity of several mixed-acting sympathomimetics were determined during the dark cycle in rats made hyperphagic by food deprivation. L-TYR (200 mg/kg) significantly potentiated the anorectic activity of phenylpropanolamine, (-)-ephedrine and (+)-amphetamine by 48, 50 and 37%, respectively. When the dose of L-TYR was varied (25-400 mg/kg), a significant dose-dependent relationship was noted. The observed potentiation was positively correlated with increases in brain TYR concentrations; blockade of L-TYR uptake into the brain by the coadministration of L-valine prevented this potentiation. Various other L-amino acids, as well as D-TYR, failed to mimic the potentiating action of L-TYR. As determined by alpha-methyl-p-TYR pretreatment, the L-TYR-induced potentiation was dependent upon increased catecholamine synthesis. Although various other mixed-acting sympathomimetic anorexiants were similarly potentiated by L-TYR, the direct-acting beta-2 adrenoceptor anorexiants, salbutamol and methoxyphenamine, were not. These results indicate that L-TYR specifically potentiates the anorectic activity of the studied mixed-acting sympathomimetics and are consistent with the requirement of the central conversion of L-TYR to catecholamines via TYR hydroxylase for this response. The possibility that the effect of mixed-acting sympathomimetics is normally limited by the availability of L-TYR is suggested.\r"

  ".W": "Chronic morphine treatment elicits a variety of immunosuppressive effects in mice. Most of the work describing this immuno-suppressive activity of the opioid is based on in vitro assessments of the performance of certain components of the immune system in morphine-treated animals. Relatively little has been done by way of tracking the effects of chronic morphine treatment on immunologic parameters in the intact animal. Therefore, this study used several classic in vivo determinations of immune function in mice treated chronically with morphine. Morphine pellet (75 mg) implantation led to a significant inhibition (91%) of paw swelling in a picryl chloride-induced delayed type hypersensitivity response. Uptake of iododeoxyuridine in an in vivo lymphocyte proliferation assay and splenomegaly in a graft vs. host reaction were also significantly suppressed by morphine pellet implantation (34 and 52%, respectively). Coimplantation of a naltrexone pellet (10 mg) completely reversed the suppressive responses to morphine in each assay. Naltrexone alone had no significant effect in any of the assays. The suppressive effects of morphine were less pronounced in adrenalectomized mice in the graft vs. host assay (51% vs. 9% reduction in morphine-pelleted shams relative to morphine-pelleted adrenalectomized mice). These findings indicate the pathophysiologic significance of the previously reported suppression of in vitro correlates of immune function in morphine-pelleted mice. The results further demonstrate that the immunosuppressive effects observed after morphine pellet implantation are naltrexone reversible and suggest that activation of the adrenal is one potential mechanism for this effect.\r"

High-performance liquid chromatography determinations revealed that all CRE 10904 (p.o. or i.v. administered) was rapidly sulfo-conjugated in dogs and rats, and glucurono-conjugated in pigs. The (O-sulfonyl)-CRE10904 metabolite (or simply CRE 11296) rapidly appeared in plasma, reached a concentration peak at about 40 min and disappeared with a half-life time of about 3 hr. The urinary excretion of CRE 11296 was correlated with the natriuretic activity of CRE 10904. Moreover, CRE 11296 was a powerful natriuretic compound in rats and dogs and, even in pigs, i.v. CRE 11296 induced transient natriuresis (just before its rapid hydrolysis and glucurono-conjugation). Studies in human red blood cells revealed that: 1) CRE 11296 was a potent inhibitor of the [Na+,K+,Cl-]-cotransport system (IC50 of 1.5 +/- 0.3 x 10(-5) M; mean +/- S.E.M. of 5 experiments), slightly more powerful than furosemide (IC50 of 2 x 10(-5) M), 2) it was the only diuretic drug potently inhibiting the [K+,Cl-]-cotransport system (IC50 of 2.1 +/- 0.6 x 10(-5) M; N = 3) and the [Cl/HCO3-] exchanger (IC50 of 4.5 +/- 1.0 x 10(-5) M; N = 3) and 3) CRE 10904 and its glucuronide were much less potent Cl- transport inhibitors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "In the isolated perfused rat mesenteric vascular bed pretreated with guanethidine and precontracted with methoxamine, periarterial nerve stimulation elicited a frequency-dependent and endothelium-independent vasodilation. The sustained vasodilation was slow-onset and reversible. It was resistant to propranolol or atropine but sensitive to tetrodotoxin and capsaicin suggesting that this is a nonadrenergic-noncholinergic vasodilation and is a neurogenic response. The vasodilation was abolished by anti-serum against calcitonin-gene related peptide (CGRP) in a concentration-dependent manner. These data suggest that the non-adrenergic-noncholinergic vasodilation is mediated by endogenous CGRP released from the primary sensory nerve terminals upon electrical stimulation. In addition to the vasodilator action, CGRP also inhibited nerve stimulation-induced and norepinephrine-induced vasoconstriction at extremely low concentrations. The inhibitory action of CGRP appeared to be mediated by postsynaptic mechanisms inasmuch as evoked norepinephrine release was not affected by CGRP when the vasoconstriction produced by norepinephrine or periarterial nerve stimulation was attenuated greatly by CGRP. These observations suggest that the vascular tone of the resistance vessels can be regulated by primary sensory nerve-derived CGRP.\r"

  ".W": "We have investigated the effects of potassium channel opening drugs on the ATP-dependence of ATP-sensitive K+ channel activity and on contractile activity in rat and guinea pig ventricular myocytes. The results show that cromakalim (BRL34915), and RP49356, agents reported to open ATP-sensitive K+ channels, do so by shifting the intracellular [ATP] required to cause half-maximal inhibition of channel activity (ki) to higher [ATP]. In guinea pig ventricular myocytes at 37 degrees C, the ki was shifted from 79 to 152 microM by 40 microM cromakalim and, in rat myocytes at room temperature, the ki was also shifted to higher [ATP] by 50 microM RP49356. The effect of externally applied RP49356 on the contractile activity of intact rat ventricular myocytes was investigated. At 100 microM the drug was without effect in the presence of normal bathing solution containing 10 mM glucose. When glucose in the bathing medium had been replaced by 2-deoxyglucose for 84 +/- 2 min, 100 microM RP49356 decreased the twitch amplitude to 23 +/- 4% of control. The negative inotropic effect of 100 microM RP49356 increased with time after perfusion with 2-deoxyglucose, and the negative inotropic effect diminished on reperfusing with glucose; 83 +/- 3 min after reperfusing with glucose, twitch amplitude was decreased by only 52 +/- 6% on exposure to 100 microM RP49356. These results suggest that the effect of the potassium channel opening drugs on contractility and electrical behavior will depend critically on the intracellular [ATP]. The results provide an explanation of how potassium channel openers may become clinically useful as cardioprotective agents without interfering with normal function.\r"

In BBMV, DQ-2556 was more effective in cis-inhibiting the uptake of NMN in the rat than in the dog. No effect was seen in the rabbit. DQ-2556 had no effect on brush border transport systems for organic anions or dipeptides and basolateral transport systems for organic cations or anions in dogs, rabbits and rats. In contrast, cephaloridine, a nephrotoxic cephalosporin, inhibited NMN and p-aminohippurate uptake in dog BBMV and basolateral membrane vesicles, respectively. Cephaloridine had no effect on the other organic ion transport systems in the species being tested. A dose-response curve was constructed for DQ-2556 inhibition of NMN transport in rat BBMV. An IC50 value of 2.5 mM was obtained. In counterflow studies DQ-2556 did not demonstrate trans- stimulation of tetraethylammonium uptake. Kinetic studies revealed that DQ-2556 increased the Km value of NMN from 130 to 190 microM, while having no effect on the Vmax value (1.72 nmol/min x mg of protein vs. 1.75 nmol/min x mg of protein in the presence of DQ-2556). These data are most consistent with DQ-2556 being a low affinity competitive inhibitor of NMN transport in rat BBMV.\r"

This study was designed to investigate the in vivo effects of benzodiazepine molecules on several macrophage functions. Benzodiazepines injected i.p. exerted a long-lasting inhibition on phagocyte oxidative responsiveness, still detectable 48 hr after injection. This action was dose-dependent, optimally effective at 1 mg/kg and observed at the site of injection within peritoneal cells as well as at a distance, within splenocytes. It was restricted to peripheral and mixed-type molecules whereas the central-type compound, clonazepam, was ineffective, in good keeping with the molecular specificity of the receptor present on murine macrophages. The fact that benzodiazepines exerted similar effects in Nude mice highly suggests that their in vivo inhibitory activity was not T cell-dependent. The peripheral benzodiazepine Ro5-4864 injected i.p. inhibited the capacity of macrophages to produce interleukin-1, tumor necrosis factor and interleukin-6. Clonazepam remained ineffective. These results demonstrate an in vivo immunosuppressive property of peripheral and mixed but not central -type benzodiazepines affecting characteristic phagocyte functions involved in host-defense mechanisms as well as in inflammatory response.\r"

To address the potential mechanism(s) by which opiate-receptor antagonists may exert their protective actions in cerebral ischemia, metabolic and biochemical changes were measured in brain of rats pretreated with the opiate-receptor antagonist nalmefene or vehicle and subjected to 60 min of global ischemia followed by 2 hr of reperfusion. 31P and 1H magnetic resonance spectroscopy were used to follow the metabolic changes during ischemia and reperfusion, after which brain tissue was frozen in situ. Biochemical assays included free fatty acids, thromboxane B2, ascorbate, vitamin E and amino acids. Nalmefene-treated animals showed more rapid and complete recovery of cellular bioenergetic state (as indicated by the phosphocreatine to inorganic phosphate ratio), tissue acidosis and lactate levels during reperfusion than placebotreated controls. Ischemia/reperfusion caused significant increases of fatty free acids and thromboxane, associated with significant decreases of ascorbate and glutamate; nalmefene pretreatment limited each of these changes. The degree of metabolic improvement as reflected by recovery of high energy phosphates and reduction of lactic acidosis were highly correlated with changes in tissue levels of arachidonate and glutamate. Thus, the beneficial effects of opiate-receptor antagonists in cerebral ischemia may be due, in part, to an ability to enhance metabolic recovery with associated, reduction in phospholipid hydrolysis and excitotoxin release.\r"

Charybdotoxin was the only blocker studied which did not alter K+ current kinetics; it produced a simple block (K1 approximately 1 nM) which appeared to be independent of voltage or channel state (open, closed or inactivated). Tetraethylammonium slowed inactivation of K+ currents, consistent with the notion that blocked channels cannot inactivate. Verapamil and methoxyverapamil produced time-, voltage- and concentration-dependent \"inactivation\" or block of open channels during depolarizing pulses, with negligible block of closed channels at negative holding potentials. Capsaicin, chlorpromazine, phencyclidine, quinidine and tetrahydroaminoacridine both increased the rate of inactivation and decreased the peak K+ current. These characteristics suggest that both open and closed channels can be blocked, but that open channels are blocked preferentially. Nifedipine, like most other blockers, increased the rate of K+ current decay, but, unlike other blockers, resulted in two distinct kinetic components of current decay under some conditions. Because nifedipine is uncharged, the voltage and time-dependence of its block cannot be ascribed to a traditional ionic blockade mechanism. Mechanisms of K+ channel block are compared with block of Ca++ channels by calcium \"antagonists\" and block of Na+ channels by local anesthetics. Interactions between gating kinetics and K+ channel blockade seem to be the rule rather than the exception.\r"

We have compared the vascular effects of arginine and some of its N-substituted derivatives on the perfusion pressure (Pp) of the isolated rat kidney preparation preconstricted with phenylephrine. Irrespective of the stereochemistry, high doses (10(-4) mol) of L- and D-arginine HCl produced a slight vasodilation. In contrast L- and D-arginine free base, at similar doses, further increased renal Pp. N-substituted L-arginine compounds, however, decreased Pp dose-dependently. Their order of potency (ED50) was as follows: N-alpha-benzoyl-L-arginine ethyl ester (BAEE, 3.8 x 10hm6 mol) greater than N-alpha-benzoyl-L-arginine methyl ester (2.5 x 10(-5) mol) greater than L-arginine ethyl ester (2.7 x 10(-5) mol) greater than L-arginine HCl (10(-4) mol). Methylene blue (10(-5) M), hemoglobin (10(-5) M) and NG-mono-methyl-L-arginine (5 mumol) antagonized the vasodilation elicited by infusion of BAEE. Similarly, injection of xanthine oxidase/xanthine (100 mU) reversed BAEE-induced renal vasodilation, but had no effect on dilation elicited by infusion of atrial natriuretic peptide. These data demonstrate that substituted arginine compounds are more potent renal vasodilators than L-arginine and their potency depends on the nature of the substitution. These compounds exert their effect, at least in part, via an endothelium-dependent mechanism. We conclude that exogenous L-arginine is a poor substrate for EDRF generation in the kidney, and that it may cause release of EDRF by another mechanism, possibly related to a change in the pH of the medium.\r"

This effect was not region specific as protection was observed in the cortex, hippocampus and striatum 1 week after the administration of a single dose of MDMA. MDL 11,939 also showed some efficacy at reducing the deficits in 5-HT concentrations and tryptophan hydroxylase activity produced by multiple administrations of MDMA. Protection against the neurotoxicity required the administration of MDL 11,939 within 1 hr of MDMA indicating 5-HT2 receptor activation was an early event in the process leading to terminal damage. Examination of the effect of the 5-HT2 receptor blockade on the early neurochemical alterations induced by MDMA revealed an inhibitory effect on MDMA-stimulated dopamine synthesis. Analysis of these data and the associated changes in dopamine metabolites indicates that 5-HT2 receptor antagonists block MDMA-induced neurotoxicity by interfering with the ability of the dopamine neuron to maintain its cytoplasmic pool of transmitter and thereby sustain carrier-mediated dopamine release.\r"

Plasma creatinine, creatinine clearance, urinary osmolality and fractional excretion of sodium were used to test the effectiveness of the drug. S-312-d (0.01-0.1 mg/kg b.wt. i.v.) administration before ischemia offered dose-dependent protection against the functional impairment induced by ischemia. This effect was accompanied by an increase in the survival rate of ischemic rats. S-312-d given after ischemia was not effective. The renal cortical edema induced by ischemia was significantly reduced by pretreatment with S-312-d. The increase in renal tissue calcium content observed after ischemia was also suppressed by S-312-d. Comparison with other established calcium blockers indicated S-312-d to be a good candidate for protection against ischemic ARF.

  ".W": "Renal handling, metabolism and effects on kidney function of naproxen and its l-enantiomer were examined in the isolated perfused rat kidney (IPK). Urinary excretion rate of naproxen was much lower than the filtration rate, indicating extensive reabsorption. Naproxen is accumulated considerably in the IPK. This accumulation is concentration-dependent and is probably the result of active secretion of naproxen. Considerable amounts of desmethyl-naproxen were formed in the IPK. The kinetic behavior of the l-enantiomer of naproxen did not differ from naproxen. Addition of 37.5 to 3750 micrograms naproxen caused a decrease in urinary flow, glomerular filtration rate and fractional excretion of sodium, chloride, potassium, magnesium and calcium. The presence of prostaglandin E2 in the perfusate fully opposed the effects of naproxen on kidney function. Addition of 375 micrograms l-enantiomer of naproxen did not influence kidney function. Addition of very high doses (1 x 10(5) micrograms) of naproxen and its l-enantiomer to the IPK caused diuresis and increased the fractional excretion of sodium, chloride, potassium, glucose and calcium. We conclude that the pharmacokinetic behavior and the metabolism of naproxen in the IPK is probably not stereoselective; that relatively low doses of naproxen exert a specific, stereoselective effect on kidney function caused by inhibition of the prostaglandin E2 synthesis and that high doses of naproxen exert a nonstereoselective effect on kidney function.\r"

  ".W": "The biliary excretion of morphine and its metabolites by guinea pigs after s.c. injection of morphine (25 mg/kg) was determined by high-performance liquid chromatography procedures. The amounts of morphinone (MO), morphinone-glutathione adduct (MO-GSH), morphine and morphine-3-glucuronide excreted over a 4-hr period were 1.27, 9.35, 1.13 and 7.54% of the administeral dose, respectively. In addition, trace amounts of morphine-GSH adduct and morphinone-cysteine adduct, derived from MO-GSH, were detected. Although MO-GSH formation from MO proceeded nonenzymatically with a relatively high rate, GSH S-transferases participated in the reaction, especially at lower GSH concentrations. Pretreatment of the animals with diethyl maleate and lithocholic acid-3-sulfate decreased the total biliary excretion of MO. On the other hand, pretreatment with naloxone increased the excretion of total MO. In vitro experiments using liver cytosolic preparations showed that lithocholic acid-3-sulfate inhibited the enzymatic formation of MO from morphine and of MO-GSH from MO. The effects of naloxone on MO formation in vitro were more complex. A reaction was stimulated at low and suppressed at higher concentrations. The results indicated that MO-GSH formation from morphine is inhibited by lithocholic acid-3-sulfate through actions on both morphine 6-dehydrogenase and GSH S-transferases. Low levels of naloxone were found to stimulate the morphine 6-dehydrogenase-mediated dehydrogenation of morphine to MO.\r"

  ".U": "91056449\r", 
  ".W": "Pravadoline is a new chemical entity with analgesic activity in humans. This report describes the pharmacology of pravadoline and compares the activity of pravadoline with that of two major classes of analgesics, the opioids and the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Like the NSAIDs, pravadoline inhibited the synthesis of prostaglandins (PGs) in mouse brain both in vitro (IC50, 4.9 microM) and ex vivo (ED50, 20 mg/kg p.o.) and displayed antinociceptive activity in rodents subjected to a variety of chemical, thermal and mechanical nociceptive stimuli. Administration of pravadoline prevented the writhing response induced by i.p. administration of acetylcholine (ED50, 41 mg/kg p.o.) or PGE2 (ED50, 24 mg/kg p.o.) and prolonged the response latency induced by tail immersion in hot water at a temperature of 55 degrees C (minimum effective dose, 100 mg/kg s.c.). In the rat, treatment with pravadoline prevented acetic acid-induced writhing (ED50, 15 mg/kg p.o.), brewer's yeast-induced hyperalgesia (Randall-Selitto test) (minimum effective dose, 1 mg/kg p.o.), the nociceptive response induced by paw flexion in the adjuvant-arthritic rat (ED50, 41 mg/kg p.o.) and bradykinin-induced head and forepaw flexion (ED50, 78 mg/kg, p.o.). The antinociceptive activity of pravadoline cannot be explained by an opioid mechanism, because pravadoline-induced antinociception was not antagonized by naloxone (1 mg/kg s.c.) and pravadoline did not bind to opioid receptors at concentrations up to 10 microM. However, like the opioid analgesics, pravadoline diminished the electrically induced twitch response of mouse vas deferens preparations, but, in contrast to opioids, this action of pravadoline was not attenuated by naloxone. The possibility is discussed that this effect of pravadoline upon isolated tissues may contribute to its antinociceptive activity. In contrast to NSAIDs, pravadoline was more potent ex vivo as an inhibitor of the formation of PGs in brain vs. stomach. In addition, pravadoline failed to produce gastrointestinal lesions when administered p.o. to rats or mice, and did not possess significant anti-inflammatory activity at antinociceptive doses. Also unlike NSAIDs, pravadoline inhibited rat gastrointestinal transit when administered at doses similar to those which were antinociceptive. The overall pharmacologic profile of pravadoline suggests that the compound may be capable of managing more diverse or more severe pain than is achieved by anti-inflammatory analgesics, without producing side effects commonly associated with either the opioid or the nonopioid analgesics.\r"

In anesthetized rats, naloxone (2.5-10 mg/kg i.v.) potentiated the pressor responses to epinephrine (2 micrograms/kg). Naloxone (5 mg/kg) significantly potentiated the pressor responses to norepinephrine (1-4 micrograms/kg), phenylephrine (10-50 micrograms/kg) and the reflex pressor responses to a 60-sec carotid occlusion. On the contrary, naloxone did not potentiate the arterial pressure responses to methoxamine (100 micrograms/kg), angiotensin (0.5-2 micrograms/kg) and isoproterenol (1 micrograms/kg). Pithing or acute adrenalectomy did not alter the naloxone-induced potentiation of the pressor responses to norepinephrine (0.125-0.5 micrograms/kg). 6-Hydroxydopamine pretreatment abolished completely the naloxone-induced potentiation of the pressor responses to norepinephrine (0.25-1 micrograms/kg). In isolated rat atria, naloxone (1.4 and 2.8 x 10(-5) M) potentiated the chronotropic responses to norepinephrine (1.5-6 x 10(-8) M). It is suggested that naloxone potentiates cardiovascular responses to sympathomimetic amines by interacting with presynaptic adrenergic mechanisms which could additionally contribute to its pressor effects in acute hypotensive conditions.\r"

  ".U": "91056452\r", 
  ".W": "We reported previously that in the presence of appropriate blocking agents [3H]ethylketocyclazocine selectively labels a non-mu, non-delta, non-kappa binding site with opioid receptor characteristics. We now report that chronic treatment with the opiate antagonist naltrexone dramatically increases the number of these binding sites in rat brain, as well as the number of mu, delta and kappa receptors. This finding further supports the concept that the [3H]ethylketocyclazocine site is an opioid receptor and previously reported evidence indicating that it might be the beta-endorphin-specific epsilon receptor that has been hypothesized to exist for some time. The affinity of naltrexone for the putative epsilon site in vivo appears to be similar to its affinity for mu and delta receptors, since a single 30-mg naltrexone pellet was sufficient to induce a maximal rate of up-regulation for all three types of sites. In contrast, a maximal rate of kappa receptor up-regulation requires at least four naltrexone pellets and, therefore, the affinity of naltrexone for this site in vivo appears to be considerably lower than for the other sites. Unexpectedly, we found that the naltrexone-induced increase in binding to all four types of receptors continued to increase through 60 days of naltrexone exposure, the longest treatment period examined, and that the increases in receptor binding were linear with exposure time. This finding is contradictory to the generally held view that antagonist-induced opioid receptor up-regulation in brain increases asymptotically, leveling off after a relatively brief treatment period.\r"

  ".W": "Abecarnil (ZK 112119; isopropyl-6-benzyloxy-4-methoxymethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate), a novel beta-carboline with high affinity for central benzodiazepine (BZ) receptors, has been shown recently to be a potent anxiolytic and anticonvulsant in animal models whereas lacking ataxia-producing effects, a profile typical for a partial agonist at BZ receptors. In the present study abecarnil was tested in dogs after acute and chronic administration. Pharmacokinetic studies showed that abecarnil was eliminated rapidly after i.v. or p.o. administration, but elimination was delayed substantially after s.c. injection. After i.v. injection, the drug penetrated rapidly into the cerebrospinal fluid, but maximum concentrations reached in cerebrospinal fluid were only 6 to 8% of those in plasma. Anticonvulsant potency of abecarnil in dogs was studied by means of seizures induced by i.v. infusion of pentylenetetrazol. After i.v. administration of single doses, abecarnil was about half as potent as diazepam, dose-dependently increasing the pentylenetetrazol threshold by doses of 0.1-1 mg/kg. In contrast to diazepam, most dogs injected with abecarnil at anticonvulsant doses showed no ataxia. During chronic s.c. administration of abecarnil for 6 weeks, the anticonvulsant efficacy of the drug increased markedly during the first week(s) of treatment, possibly indicating drug accumulation in the brain. During the subsequent weeks of treatment, there was a slight reduction in anticonvulsant potency. No withdrawal symptoms were observed after cessation of the 6-week administration period. Furthermore, injection of the BZ antagonist Ro 15-1788 (flumazenil), 1 mg/kg i.v., after 5 weeks of treatment did not precipitate withdrawal symptoms except slight tremor in two of seven dogs studied.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The effects of cholinesterase inhibitors, cholinergic agonists, dopaminergic agonists and dopaminergic antagonists on the hyperactivity produced by the muscarinic cholinergic antagonist scopolamine were evaluated in mice. Scopolamine (0.3-10 mg/kg) produced a dose-related increase in locomotor activity, with a peak effect at 3.0 mg/kg. The cholinesterase inhibitor physostigmine (0.03-0.175 mg/kg) was without effect on locomotor activity when administered alone, whereas the cholinesterase inhibitor tetrahydroaminoacridine hydrate (0.3-10 mg/kg) decreased locomotor activity. Both physostigmine and tetrahydroaminoacridine hydrate attenuated the effects of scopolamine. Administered alone, the cholinergic agonists oxotremorine (0.01-0.3 mg/kg) and RS86 (0.1-3.0 mg/kg) produced dose-related decreases in locomotor activity, whereas pilocarpine (0.3-10 mg/kg) had no effect on locomotor activity. None of these three muscarinic agonists significantly attenuated the hyperactivity produced by scopolamine. Administered alone, the dopaminergic agonists quinpirole (0.003-0.1 mg/kg), S-(-)-3-(3-hydroxyphenyl)-N-n-propylpiperidine (0.3-10 mg/kg) and SKF 38393 (8-64 mg/kg) had no significant effect on activity, whereas apomorphine (0.3-10 mg/kg) and d-amphetamine (0.1-3.0 mg/kg) increased activity. Quinpirole, apomorphine and S-(-)-3-(3-hydroxyphenyl)-N-n-propylpiperidine produced dose-related reversals of the increases in locomotor activity produced by scopolamine. The hyperactivity effects of d-amphetamine were approximately additive with scopolamine, whereas SKF 38393 did not significantly affect scopolamine. The mixed D1/D2 dopaminergic antagonist haloperidol (0.003-3.0 mg/kg) and the selective D1 antagonist SCH 23390 (0.01-0.3 mg/kg) produced dose-related decreases in locomotor activity when administered alone, and also produced dose-related reversals of the hyperactivity produced by scopolamine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The exogenous administration of GSH, while not modifying hepatic GSH content, increased liver MT levels in basal and starved rats but not in stressed rats. Liver and serum cysteine levels were increased by GSH administration, a process partially reverted by the irreversible inhibitor of gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, alpha-amino-3-chloro-4,5-dihydro-5-isoxazoleacetic acid. Mouse and rat liver MT levels were also increased by buthionine sulfoximine, an inhibitor of GSH synthesis, indicating that GSH is not a necessary precursor of MT. In addition, the hepatic MT content was increased by the administration of cysteine in a dose-response manner. These results suggest that hepatic MT synthesis is elevated by increased cysteine pools, and that MT, GSH and cysteine levels are somehow inter-related. MT, besides GSH, may be contemplated as a putative intracellular reservoir of cysteine in the liver of adult rats.\r"

  ".W": "Inflammatory bowel disease is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the gastrointestinal tract that includes ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Leukotriene B4 is thought to be a prominent proinflammatory mediator in these diseases, in that leukotriene B4 levels are increased in the colonic mucosa of inflammatory bowel disease patients and there is increased polymorphonuclear leukocyte infiltration of these tissues. We evaluated the efficacy of 7-[3-(4-acetyl-3-methoxy-2-propylphenoxy)-3,4-dihydro-8-propyl -2H-1-benzopyran-2-carboxylic acid (SC-41930), a potent, orally active leukotriene B4 receptor antagonist, in a model of inflammatory bowel disease. Colonic mucosal inflammation was induced in rats, guinea pig and rabbits by rectal instillation of a dilute solution of acetic acid. Twenty-four hours later, mucosal levels of myeloperoxidase (a marker enzyme for neutrophil infiltration) and extravasation of i.v. administered Evans blue dye (a marker of vascular disruption and increased permeability) were measured. Tissues were also evaluated histologically. The animals received either SC-41930 or vehicle, intrarectally, 30 min after or 1 hr before and 1 hr after the acetic acid. When given 30 min after acetic acid instillation SC-41930 prevented the rise in myeloperoxidase and dye extravasation observed in the acetic acid inflammed tissue. The SC-41930-treated tissues were less edematous and had fewer neutrophils within the subepithelial space. Median effective dose (ED50) values for vascular protection were approximately 20 mg/kg for both rat and guinea pig. ED50 values for inhibition of granulocyte accumulation were 20 mg/kg for rat, 24 mg/kg for guinea pig and 30 mg/kg for rabbit. These data indicate that SC-41930 is effective locally to prevent acute colonic inflammation.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of aging on hepatic drug conjugation in 5- to 6-, 12- to 13- and 22- to 23-month-old female Fischer 344 rats was examined. The overall disposition of acetaminophen including the formation and elimination kinetics of its sulfate and glucuronide metabolites were used as in vivo probes. The effects of aging on selected in vitro drug metabolizing enzyme activities and on the pattern of phenol and bile salt sulfotransferase isoenzymes were also determined. Aging decreased the total clearance of acetaminophen and the partial clearance of acetaminophen to acetaminophen sulfate by 36 and 47%, respectively. Increasing age also resulted in a reduced partial clearance of acetaminophen to the glucuronide- (24%) and to the glutathione-derived conjugates (29%). UDP glucuronosyltransferase activity toward 1-naphthol, morphine and testosterone was unaffected by advanced age, whereas there was a significant correlation between increased age and increased UDP glucuronosyltransferase activity toward estrone. Cytochrome P-450 concentration and glutathione-S-transferase activity toward 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene were unchanged by aging. Oxidative demethylase activity toward p-nitroanisole was decreased 18% and sulfotransferase activities toward p-nitrophenol, acetaminophen and glycolithocholate were decreased 27, 12 and 12%, respectively, in the 22- to 23-month-old rats, compared to the 5- to 6-month-old animals. In contrast to the age-related feminization in the pattern of sulfotransferase isoenzyme activities that occurs in male rats, there was no effect of aging on the pattern of phenol and bile salt sulfotransferase isoenzyme activities in female rats.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "DuP 753 and PD123177 are two nonpeptide angiotensin II (AII)-specific ligands, which show high affinities for two respective and distinct subtypes of AII binding sites, i.e., AII-1 and AII-2 sites, respectively, in the rat adrenal gland, brain and uterus. The objective of this study is to identify the functions of these subtype binding sites in the adrenal, sympathetic ganglia, brain and vascular smooth muscle. In conscious rats, DuP 753 at 1, 3 and 10 mg/kg i.v. but not PD123177 at 30 and 100 mg/kg i.v. inhibited the AII-induced aldosterone increase. In the isolated perfused rat adrenal gland, DuP 753 at 10(-6) and 10(-4) M but not PD123177 at 10(-3) M blocked the AII-induced epinephrine secretion. In control and chemically sympathectomized pithed rats, the pressor and tachycardiac responses to AII were blocked by DuP 753 at 10 mg/kg i.v. but not by PD123177 at 100 mg/kg i.v. In conscious rats, DuP 753 at 10 mg/kg s.c. but not PD123177 at 100 mg/kg s.c. inhibited the AII-induced water drinking. In the rabbit aorta, DuP 753 at 10(-6) M but not PD123177 at 10(-4) M inhibited the contractile effect of AII. In conscious renal artery-ligated hypertensive rats, DuP 753 but not PD123177 at 0.1 to 10 mg/kg i.v. lowered blood pressure. In summary, a function of the PD123177-sensitive AII binding site (AII-2) has not yet been identified. However, the DuP 753-sensitive site (AII-1) appears to mediate the AII-induced responses such as adrenal aldosterone and catecholamine secretion, release of catecholamine from sympathetic ganglia, drinking and vasoconstriction.\r"

In rat aortic strips, SR 33557, like nifedipine, verapamil and diltiazem, caused a significant and simultaneous inhibition of potassium-induced 45Ca++ influx and contractile responses (nifedipine greater than SR 33557 greater than verapamil greater than diltiazem). SR 33557 also antagonized Ca(++)-induced contractions in K(+)-depolarized aorta preparations (pA2:9.08 +/- 0.03) and is the first calcium channel antagonist, structurally not related to 1,4-dihydropyridines, to inhibit competitively contractions induced by BAY K8644. In spike-generating vascular smooth muscle (rat portal vein), contractures evoked by noradrenaline (4 microM) or KCl (100 mM) were reduced by all four antagonists, the pharmacological potency being nifedipine greater than SR 33557 greater than verapamil greater than diltiazem. Unlike SR 33557, nifedipine, verapamil and diltiazem showed a parallel enhancement of frequency of spontaneous contractions in rat portal vein in spite of a concentration-related reduction in amplitude. By using rabbit atrial preparations, spontaneous right atrial rate and electrically stimulated (120/min) basal contractions of left atria were used as indices of chronotropy and inotropy. The potency series for negative chronotropic effects was nifedipine greater than SR 33557 greater than verapamil greater than diltiazem. For negative inotropic effects the potency order was verapamil greater than nifedipine greater than SR 33557 greater than diltiazem, respectively. Thus, SR 33557 should depress heart rate to a greater extent than ventricular contractility. These results suggest that SR 33557 is a potent calcium entry blocker that (unlike verapamil and diltiazem) is particularly selective for vascular smooth muscle and devoid of any potent negative inotropic actions.\r"

  ".W": "delta 9-Tetrahydrocannabinol, the primary psychoactive constituent in marihuana, has been studied extensively for the last 20 years; however, the mechanisms responsible for cannabinoid activity in the central nervous system are not well understood. Although it is thought that lipophilicity plays an important role in the actions of cannabinoids, studies have not been conducted to determine whether a relationship exists between the lipophilicity and behavioral potency of cannabinoid analogs. Two procedures were used to obtain n-octanol/water partition coefficients (Po/w) of naturally occurring and synthetic cannabinoids: reverse-phase high-pressure liquid chromatographic estimation of Po/w and computer calculation of Po/w based on molecular structure. The Po/w value for delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol obtained in this study, 9.44 x 10(6), is much greater than previously reported values obtained using shake-flask methodology, yet it is in agreement with the computer calculation based on molecular structure or molecular volume. The lipophilicity of the analogs determined in this study ranged from Po/w values of 3.92 x 10(2) to 1.93 x 10(11). All pharmacologically active cannabinoid compounds were extremely lipophilic (log Po/w values greater than 4.5). Several structural alterations were found to exert considerable influence on the lipophilicity of cannabinoid analogs. Increasing the length of the side chain in a homologous series of analogs results in an increase in lipophilicity of approximately 3-fold for each CH2 group added. Introduction of a single hydroxyl group decreased lipophilicity 3- to 40-fold, depending on the site of attachment. The behavioral potency of active analogs was not found to be correlated to lipophilicity. Therefore, data obtained in this study suggest that lipophilicity is a component, but not a primary determinant of pharmacological activity in the cannabinoids.\r"

The kinetics of net HCO3(-)-Cl- exchange were monitored using a stopped-flow rapid reaction apparatus, under conditions in which HCO3(-)-Cl- exchange was rate-limiting for pH equilibration across the red cell membrane. DP was found to be a rapidly acting, potent inhibitor of HCO3(-)-Cl- exchange, with an apparent I50 of 4 microM. DP produced a mixed competitive-noncompetitive inhibition of HCO3-Cl- exchange. Greater than 50% of the inhibitory effect occurred within 20 msec of DP-red cell interaction, consistent with DP binding to an outward-facing site on the cell membrane. Interaction of red cells with DP was associated with a pH-dependent decrement in the equilibrium Donnan H+ ratio. Because HCO3(-)-Cl- exchange is crucial in vivo for ensuing rapid pH equilibration across the red cell membrane, these effects of DP may have important implications, particularly in the development of high-dose DP regimes for use as an adjunctive agent in cancer chemotherapy.\r"

  ".W": "The present study used the irreversibly binding enkephalin analog, [D-Ala2,Leu5,Cys6]enkephalin (DALCE) in an effort to determine whether selective agonist and antagonist properties could be demonstrated at hypothesized types of opioid delta receptors previously termed the deltanoncomplexed and the deltacomplexed sites. These putative subtypes of delta receptors have been functionally distinguished on the basis of involvement (i.e., deltacomplexed) in the modulation of mu-mediated effects such as antinociception. Intracerebroventricular administration of DALCE or the reference delta and mu agonists, [D-Pen2,D-Pen5]enkephalin (DPDPE) and morphine, to mice all produced antinociception in the warm-water tail-flick test in a dose- and time-related manner. Maximal effects with DALCE were seen at +10 min and significant antinociception could be detected for approximately 1 hr; DALCE was 3- and 90-fold more potent than i.c.v. morphine and DPDPE, respectively. The antinociceptive effects of i.c.v. DALCE and DPDPE, but not those of morphine, were antagonized by the selective delta antagonist, N,N-diallyl-Tyr-Aib-Aib-Phe-Leu-OH, suggesting that the antinociception associated with the peptides was mediated through a delta receptor. DALCE pretreatment up to 24 hr before testing, a time at which this compound did not produce antinociception, significantly blocked the i.c.v. DPDPE antinociceptive effect as well as that of DALCE itself, but not that of morphine, suggesting long-lasting DALCE antagonism at a delta receptor. Modulation of morphine antinociception was demonstrated with subeffective doses of i.c.v. DPDPE or [Met5]enkephalin, but not with subeffective doses of i.c.v. DALCE.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "91056468\r", 
  ".W": "Vascular smooth muscle tone is continuously modulated in vivo by the functional interaction of a variety of vasoconstrictor and vasodilator stimuli. Endogenous substances such as epinephrine simultaneously activate alpha adrenergic receptors that elicit muscle contraction and beta adrenergic receptors that relax the muscle. This study characterizes the beta adrenergic response in the isolated rabbit aorta precontracted with 1 microM phenylephrine. The beta adrenergic agonist isoproterenol (0.03-10 microM) produces a biphasic response that is composed of a rapid relaxation followed by a slower regaining of tension, which is identified as desensitization. An exploratory kinetic model that describes both the relaxation and the desensitization as first-order processes provides a good fit to the experimental data. The parameters used to describe the isoproterenol response are: 1) the observed rate constant for relaxation and its magnitude (krel and R, respectively), 2) the observed rate constant for desensitization and its magnitude (kdes and D, respectively) and 3) the observed delay in the onset of the desensitization response (td). Both the krel and the fractional relaxation were dependent on concentration of isoproterenol in a saturable manner (EC50 = 0.017 and 0.067 microM, respectively). No concentration dependence was observed for kdes, fractional desensitization and td (the average values +/- S.E.M. of these parameters are (4.7 +/- 0.2). 10(-3) sec-1, 0.83 +/- 0.02 and 191 +/- 6 sec, respectively). This work demonstrates that a kinetic approach is necessary to characterize the desensitization response and is also very useful in characterizing the kinetic and steady-state parameters of the relaxation response.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Furthermore, these GHB-induced electroencephalogram-behavioral changes can be blocked by anticonvulsant drugs, which are specific in their action against petit-mal seizures. These effects of GHB on electroencephalogram and behavior may well be due to an effect of exogenously administrated GHB on GHB-mediated systems in the brain. GHB has many properties of a neuromodulator including the existence of receptors with a specific affinity for this compound. A synthetic structural analog of GHB, NCS-382, possessed anticonvulsant activity against several animal models of seizure and, in particular, against that induced by GHB administration. NCS-382 was also shown to be an antagonist at GHB receptor sites and blocked the neuropharmacologic effects induced in the striatum and hippocampus by GHB administration. In particular, NCS-382 inhibited the increase in cGMP levels and in inositol phosphate turnover induced by GHB in hippocampus. Furthermore, in vivo dialysis demonstrated that NCS-382 blocked the increased release of dopamine in striatum after GHB administration in vivo. Thus, this ligand appears to be the first described antagonist substance for GHB receptor(s). These results suggest that NCS-382 may represent a harbinger for a new class of anticonvulsant drugs that most probably act by modifying the endogenous GHB system.\r"

  ".W": "Lungs from guinea pigs passively sensitized with an affinity-purified IgG1 antibody produce both leukotriene (LT)D4 and thromboxane (Tx)B2 upon ex vivo antigen challenge. This study was undertaken to determine the possibility of endogenously generated peptido-LTs being a prerequisite for Tx synthesis. In immunoglobulin G1-sensitized lungs, exogenous LTD4 induced TxB2 production with a median effective dose of 4.1 nM, whereas the response to LTE4, LTB4 or platelet-activating factor was relatively weak. Although LTC4 was as potent as LTD4 in stimulating TxB2 generation, LTC4's dose-response curve was shifted significantly to the right by AT-125, an irreversible gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase inhibitor, suggesting that at least a part of LTC4 sensitized lungs with antigen (0.01-30 micrograms/ml ovalbumin) for 20 min precipitated a significant amount of LTD4 production. The levels of LTD4 range from 8 to 26 nM (without taking LTD4 recovery into consideration). This level is 2- to 7-fold greater than the median effective dose value observed with exogenous LTD4. Moreover, pretreatment of sensitized lungs with ICI-198,615 a specific LTD4 antagonist, blocked equally both antigen (IC50 = 0.01 microM)- and LTD4 (IC50 = 0.017 microM)-induced TxB2 production. When sensitized lung fragments were treated with 5 mM AT-125, ICI-198,615 was effective in preventing not only antigen-but also LTC4-dependent production of TxB2 (IC50 = 0.018 and 0.021 microM, respectively). In contrast, neither WEB-2086, a platelet-activating factor antagonist, nor pyrilamine, a histamine antagonist, inhibited antigen and LTD4 responses (IC50 greater than 30 microM). Unlike its effect on antigen response, ICI-198,615 was unable to block Ca2+ ionophore-induced TxB2 production.2\r"

Repeated dosages may alter the mechanisms involved with such circadian-dependent toxicity. Weekly i.v. injections of CDDP (5 mg/kg) or CBDCA (50 mg/kg) were given over 2 months to 288 male B6D2F1 mice standardized by an alternation of 12 hr of light and 12 hr of darkness at any one of three circadian dosing times (0, 8 or 16 hr after light onset--HALO). Survival; body weight; complete blood cell counts; histologic lesions in kidney, liver, spleen, bone marrow and intestinal tract; platinum concentration in kidney, spleen and colon were determined every 2 weeks throughout treatment. Thrombocytopenia was 10-fold larger following CBDCA as compared with CDDP. Severe bone marrow necrosis was cumulative following CDDP, but reversible following CBDCA. Leukopenia and bone marrow lesions were, respectively, half as severe following the dosing of either drug at 16 HALO compared with 0 or 8 HALO. Cortical tubular necrosis was observed in CDDP-treated mice. It was cumulative and half as extensive after drug dosing at 16 HALO, as compared with 0 or 8 HALO (P less than or equal to .05). Total Pt accumulation in all three tissues was 3- to 4-fold higher following repeated dosages of CDDP as compared with CBDCA. Tissue Pt uptake was halved after CDDP or CBDCA dosing at 16 HALO as compared with 8 HALO (P less than or equal to .01). Dosing either Pt complex at the appropriate time is even more critical if administrations are to be repeated. Mechanisms appear to involve the circadian rhythm-dependent ability of target tissues to take up the drug.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of diltiazem (d-cis-diltiazem) on the ischemic myocardium was compared with that of l-cis-diltiazem, an optical isomer having less potent calcium channel-blocking action, in the isolated, perfused working rat heart. Ischemia decreased mechanical function and tissue levels of ATP and creatine phosphate, and increased tissue levels of nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA), AMP and lactate. Reperfusion did not restore mechanical function, but restored incompletely the levels of metabolites (except NEFA) that had been altered by ischemia. The ischemia-induced changes in NEFA were prevented by d-cis-diltiazem completely and by l-cis-diltiazem incompletely. Other metabolic changes induced by ischemia were attenuated by d-cis-diltiazem but not by l-cis-diltiazem. In heart pretreated with d-cis- or l-cis-diltiazem, both the mechanical function and the levels of metabolites recovered during reperfusion, the degree of recovery with both drugs being similar. These results indicate that not only d-cis-diltiazem but also l-cis-diltiazem has an anti-ischemic action probably due to inhibition of the tissue NEFA accumulation. These results also suggest that the mechanism of the protective effect of d-cis-diltiazem on the ischemic myocardium is not entirely due to the calcium channel-blocking action. Treatment with low Ca2+ (1.0 mM CaCl2) also attenuated the ischemia-induced changes. The interval between reoxygenation and start of function in the reperfused heart that had been treated with low Ca2+ was significantly longer than that with d-cis- or l-cis-diltiazem. The effect of these isomers to shorten this interval may contribute to their common anti-ischemic action.\r"

  ".W": "The present study compares the effects of different hypnotics acting at omega 1/omega 2 sites (zolpidem, zopiclone, flunitrazepam and triazolam) on 35S-t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate (35S-TBPS) binding to well-washed rat cerebral membranes, in the presence of 1M NaCl. Under these conditions, all compounds enhanced 35S-TBPS binding in the 0.05 to 10 microM range with EC50 values and maximal enhancement of: zolpidem, 84 nM and 36%; flunitrazepam, 8 nM and 41%; zopiclone, 171 nM and 51%; triazolam, 2 nM and 42%. Under these conditions, gamma-aminobutyric acid enhanced 35S-TBPS binding with an EC50 of 240 nM and a 38% maximal increase. The EC50 values for the stimulation of 35S-TBPS binding are well correlated, with (r = 0.97) the affinity of these compounds at omega 1/omega 2 sites, and are in the same concentration range. This enhanced binding was due to an altered apparent affinity for the 35S-TBPS recognition site without any change in the number of sites (Scatchard analysis). The effect of zolpidem and other hypnotics was antagonized by flumazenil. This was an apparently competitive antagonism in the case of zolpidem or flunitrazepam, whereas for zopiclone, increasing the concentration of the hypnotic did not overcome the antagonism. Bicuculline only partially antagonized the hypnotic-induced enhancement of 35S-TBPS binding. This antagonism was more effective for zopiclone (-57%) than for either zolpidem (-33%) or flunitrazepam (-30%). Zolpidem and the other hypnotics studied induced a fast component of dissociation which was not observed in the control membranes. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that omega 1/omega 2 agonists increase the frequency of openings of the chloride ionophore, with both gamma-aminobutyric acid-A receptor-dependent and -independent mechanisms.\r"

Prepubescent male rats (25 days of age) were maintained on an alcohol liquid diet or were pair-fed a control diet until early adulthood and selected indices of sexual maturation were examined at weekly intervals. To determine whether sexually immature animals were more sensitive to the effects of alcohol than adults, fully mature male animals were exposed to an identical period of alcohol exposure and comparisons were made between the two groups. The results demonstrated that alcohol significantly affected many of the primary indices of puberty and sexual maturation. The normal pubertal increases in serum testosterone levels, the weights of the testes and secondary sex organs and beta-endorphin levels in the hypothalamus were substantially reduced in alcohol-exposed animals compared with controls. In contrast to these results, the effects of alcohol on reproductive endocrinology in the fully mature animal were transitory and of considerably less magnitude. After a 2-week alcohol-free period, male rats exposed to alcohol during development were bred with drug-naive primiparous females. Although the same number of pregnancies resulted from matings between alcohol-exposed males and drug-naive females compared with controls, litter sizes were significantly smaller in alcohol-derived offspring than in controls. In all other respects, such as body weights, sex ratios, mortality rates and gross developmental features (eye opening, incisor eruption and testes descent), alcohol-derived offspring were identical with controls. Upon closer examination, however, significant disturbances were detected in alcohol-derived male offspring.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

This assay method measured rhG-CSF in rat serum with greater sensitivity than a bioassay. Also, a good agreement between enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and bioassay was observed with rat serum samples after administration of rhG-CSF. The pharmacokinetics of rhG-CSF were investigated in male Sprague-Dawley rats using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay at four different doses from 1 to 100 micrograms/kg. For i.v. administration, the serum rhG-CSF concentration-time curves were best described by a biexponential equation. Over the dose range studied, no changes in volume of distribution were observed. However, a reduction in rhG-CSF clearance and prolongation of half-life (beta) were noted as the dose of rhG-CSF increased. For s.c. administration, a markedly lower serum peak rhG-CSF concentration was observed, but after 2 to 3 hr, rhG-CSF concentration was higher than that following i.v. administration. Administration s.c. also caused nonlinear increases in the serum concentration. Bioavailability after s.c. administration was 0.509 to 0.704.\r"

The purpose of this study was to examine longer postagonist intervals and to determine the maximum interval between agonist administration and antagonist challenge at which precipitated withdrawal can be observed. During this study 6 nondependent male volunteers who reported using opiates an average of 4 times per week received naloxone challenges (10 mg/70 kg i.m.) at 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, or 72 hr after single i.m. injections of morphine (18 mg/70 kg or 30 mg/70 kg). Each interval was tested independently in random order. Naloxone reliably precipitated withdrawal signs and symptoms at 6 and 12 hr postmorphine. Withdrawal symptoms were greatly diminished in intensity at 24-hr postmorphine and were not elicited at postmorphine intervals longer than 24 hr. Withdrawal precipitation persisted somewhat longer than pupillary constriction because pupils had returned to predrug diameters by 24 hr postmorphine but, generally, there appeared to be correspondence between offset of agonist effects and dissipation of precipitated withdrawal. This study extends observations about the time course of acute physical dependence effects which begin within minutes after acute morphine exposure, dissipate within 36 hr, are associated with the onset and offset of agonist effects and do not require chronic opioid administration.\r"

Our objectives were to determine the age-related changes in canine epicardial and guinea pig papillary muscle transmembrane potentials and to determine the age-related effects of lidocaine on these tissues. Standard microelectrode techniques were used. We found the neonatal canine epicardial action potential plateau to be more positive and rounded and the action potential duration to be longer than that of the adult epicardium. In contrast, guinea pig papillary muscles did not show any differences in neonatal and adult transmembrane potentials. Significant age-related differences in the use-dependent effects of lidocaine were found in the canine epicardial tissue. The neonatal epicardium reached a steady-state level of block more rapidly and recovered from this block more slowly when compared to the adult epicardium. The guinea pig papillary muscles showed no age-related differences in the kinetics of use-dependent lidocaine block. These data suggest that age-related differences in the voltage-time course of the action potential plateau and repolarization may be largely responsible for the age-related differences seen in lidocaine's effects on canine epicardium.\r"

A scale comprised of 10 precipitated abstinence signs, the Benzodiazepine Precipitated Abstinence Scale, was developed, which yielded linear flumazenil log-dose response lines with significant slopes in dogs dependent on diazepam, nordiazepam and flunitrazepam. The effects of 18, 36 and 72 mg/kg of flumazenil in otherwise drug naive dogs were studied. In naive dogs, the most prominent effect of flumazenil was to reduce activity. All benzodiazepines studied produced dependence that was characterized by signs of precipitated abstinence; however, the intensity and quality of abstinence varied from one benzodiazepine to another. Precipitated abstinence in dogs treated chronically with diazepam and flunitrazepam was characterized by a dose-related increase in clonic convulsions and Benzodiazepine Precipitated Abstinence Scale scores. This pattern differed from that seen in nordiazepam- and alprazolam-dependent dogs, which showed a comparable flumazenil dose-related increase in clonic convulsion but only a modest increase in Benzodiazepine Precipitated Abstinence Scale scores. Oxazepam and lorazepam produced dependence that was less intense than that seen with the other benzodiazepines. Plasma levels of the benzodiazepines and their metabolites were repeatedly determined after single doses and during addiction cycles. Nordiazepam accumulated in diazepam- and nordiazepam-dependent dogs and alpha-OH alprazolam accumulated in alprazolam-dependent dogs. Other drugs and metabolites did not. These observations suggest that: 1) different benzodiazepines or their metabolites produce different types of physical dependence, suggesting that they or their metabolites have different mechanisms and sites of action; 2) plasma cumulation of the benzodiazepines or their active metabolites is an important factor in the genesis of physical dependence; and 3) metabolism of benzodiazepines plays an important role in their dependence-producing capacity, and because of differences in the way species metabolize benzodiazepines, the type of dependence produced in different species may differ.\r"

Against mu agonists, NalBzoH is a potent antagonist with a prolonged duration of action corresponding to its extremely slow rate of dissociation from mu receptors in binding assays. In the present studies, NalBzoH also antagonized mu analgesia, reversing both mu 1 and mu 2 analgesia independently elicited by intracerebroventricular or intrathecal [D-Ala2,MePhe4,-Gly(ol)5]enkephalin injections. It also antagonized kappa 1 analgesia elicited by U50,488H, and delta analgesia produced by intrathecal [D-Pen2,D-Pen5]enkephalin. Yet, at higher doses, NalBzoH alone produced analgesia in the tail-flick, hot plate and writhing assays. Neither the mu-selective antagonist beta-funaltrexamine, the delta-selective antagonist naltrindole, nor the kappa 1-selective antagonist norbinaltorphimine reversed NalBzoH analgesia in the tail-flick test. Analgesia observed with systemically administered NalBzoH was reversed easily by the antagonist WIN44,441 when it was given intracerebroventricularly, but not intrathecally. These observations confirm the opioid nature of NalBzoH analgesia and imply a supraspinal mechanism of action. In contrast, intrathecal, but not intracerebroventricular WIN44,441 reversed analgesia from systemic U50,488H quite potently. Thus, NalBzoH antagonizes mu, delta and kappa 1 actions while retaining its ability to elicit analgesia through a novel and distinct supraspinal kappa 3 system.\r"

  ".W": "Single or multiple doses of the potent dopamine releaser, methamphetamine (METH), increases the content of neurotensin (NT)-like immunoreactivity (NTLI) in the substantia nigra of the rat brain by 2- to 3-fold. Concurrent blockade of D-1 receptors with METH treatment completely antagonized the increase in nigral NTLI content induced by this drug. These results suggest that activation of D-1 receptors by endogenous dopamine results in an increase in the level of NTLI in the substantia nigra. The present study was performed to characterize further the mechanisms underlying dopaminergic regulation of nigral NT systems. Prior selective destruction of the nigrostriatal dopamine pathway completely prevented the increase in nigral NTLI content induced by treatment with METH, which suggests that the effects of METH on nigral NT systems are mediated by the nigrostriatal dopamine projections. However, unlike METH, treatment of rats with the direct-acting, D-1-selective agonist, SKF 38393, did not alter nigral NTLI content but when combined with stimulation of D-2 receptors, a significant increase in the level of NTLI occurred. Surprisingly, activation of only D-2 receptors caused a significant decrease in nigral NTLI content. These data suggest that although activation of D-2 receptors alone has an effect opposite to that of the D-1 subtype, in combination with D-1 stimulation they facilitate the effect of D-1 receptors on nigral NT systems. In addition to the effects of direct or indirect stimulation of dopamine activity on nigral NT levels, basally released dopamine also appeared to regulate the level of NTLI in the substantia nigra. Thus, interruption of tonic dopamine activity by reserpine-induced depletion of dopamine significantly reduced the level of NTLI in the substantia nigra. The role of D-1 receptors in this tonic dopaminergic regulation of nigral NT systems was evident when concurrent activation of D-1, but not D-2, receptors with reserpine treatment prevented or reversed the decrease in NTLI content caused by dopamine depletion. Additional evidence for the D-1-mediated tonic regulation of NT systems in the substantia nigra was that blockade of D-1 receptors with SCH 23390 decreased the nigral NTLI content but blockade of D-2 receptors with sulpiride had no effect.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of adenosine, adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) and ATP analogs on basal gastric somatostatin-like immunoreactivity (SLI) release was studied using the vascularly perfused rat stomach. The release of gastric SLI was stimulated by adenosine (0.6-60 microM) concentration dependently, while the release of immunoreactive gastrin was inhibited by 1 and 10 microM adenosine. The stimulatory action of adenosine was probably mediated by adenosine receptors because the receptor antagonist, 8-phenyltheophylline, abolished the action of adenosine. In addition, the adenosine-induced release of SLI was not mediated by a cholinergic or beta-adrenergic mechanism, since atropine, hexamethonium or propranolol did not block the action of adenosine. Dipyridamole enhanced the adenosine-stimulated, but not 2-chloroadenosine-induced SLI release. Since the adenosine analog, 2-chloroadenosine, is resistant to the adenosine uptake mechanism, it is likely that adenosine-stimulated release of gastric SLI is due to the activation of extracellular receptors. ATP also stimulated gastric SLI release. The analogs alpha,beta-methyleneadenosine triphosphate and diphosphate, which are resistant to metabolic breakdown, did not stimulate basal SLI release, while gamma,beta-methyleneadenosine triphosphate, which can be metabolized, increased the release of SLI. In addition, the ATP-induced release of SLI was abolished by 8-phenyltheophylline. Therefore, the action of ATP is likely to be a result of its metabolism to adenosine.\r"

Benzodiazepines such as diazepam, nitrazepam and chlordiazepoxide (CDP) impaired the passive avoidance response when administered before training, but not when administered immediately after training or before the retention test. CDP also impaired latent learning in the water finding task. State-dependent learning was not observed with CDP at the dose used. A benzodiazepine inverse agonist, Ro 15-4513, and a benzodiazepine antagonist, Ro 15-1788, completely and partially reversed, respectively, the disruptive effects of CDP on learning and memory at the doses which did not enhance learning and memory. The disruptive effects of CDP on learning and memory were partially antagonized by a choline esterase inhibitor, physostigmine, and by a blocker for muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, scopolamine, at the doses which increase acetylcholine release. These results suggest that benzodiazepines induce disruptive effects on learning and memory through benzodiazepine receptors, and that benzodiazepine-induced impairment of learning and memory is, at least in part, the result of the dysfunction of the cholinergic neuronal system.\r"

Following a 1-min cold water swim stress, rats previously injected in both hind paws with vehicle showed a transient elevation of paw pressure threshold, which was much greater in inflamed than in noninflamed paws and returned to control levels within 15 min. This preferential antinociception was significantly pronounced and prolonged in rats previously injected bilaterally with a cocktail of the enkephalinase inhibitors thiorphan (0.2 mg intraplantar) and bestatin (0.2 mg intraplantar). The enhancement of stress-induced antinociception by thiorphan/bestatin was dose-dependently antagonized by tertiary naloxone (0.125-2 mg kg-1 s.c.). Evidence for a peripheral site of action of enkephalin-like peptides in this model was provided by the antagonism of the actions of thiorphan/bestatin by quaternary naltrexone (10-20 mg kg-1 s.c.). Systemic administration of the orally active enkephalinase inhibitor SCH 34826 (5-40 mg kg-1 i.p.) was also able to dose-dependently potentiate the preferential stress-induced antinociception in a naloxone (1 mg kg-1 s.c.) reversible manner.\r"

  ".W": "To investigate the role of opioid mechanisms in the regulation of cerebral monoaminergic neurons, male Wistar rats were continuously infused with naltrexone via an Alzet osmotic minipump, or were sham-implanted, for 14 days. Twenty-four hours after removal of the pumps or sham implants, the rats were given s.c. morphine (3, 10 or 30 mg/kg) or saline and were sacrificed 2 hr postinjection. Eight brain regions were assayed for dopamine, 5-hydroxytryptamine, noradrenaline and their respective metabolites. Chronic naltrexone treatment per se caused only small changes in cerebral monoamines. Morphine elevated dose-dependently the cerebral concentrations of the acidic dopamine metabolites, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid and homovanillic acid, as well as that of the 5-hydroxytryptamine metabolite, 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid, and that of the noradrenaline metabolite, free 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylethyleneglycol. In naltrexone-pretreated rats these elevations were significantly larger. Furthermore, in the naltrexone-pretreated rats 10 mg/kg of morphine significantly decreased the concentration of the dopamine metabolite 3-methoxytyramine both in the striatum and in the limbic forebrain, whereas in the control rats the 3-methoxytyramine content fell first after the 30-mg/kg dose and only in the striatum. Thus, both the stimulatory and the inhibitory effects of morphine on cerebral monoaminergic neurons seem to be potentiated by chronic naltrexone treatment. These data suggest that the activity of cerebral monoaminergic systems is to some degree regulated by an endogenous opioid input. When that input is chronically blocked, the basal metabolism of monoamines is not much altered but the systems' responsiveness to agonist challenge is increased.\r"

By 5 min after intravenous bolus injection of a physiologically inactive amount (450 ng, 10 microCi) of [3H]-6F-DA, 3H was concentrated in all the organs compared with that in blood or plasma. In the sympathetically innervated organs, most of the radioactivity was in [3H]-6F-DA and [3H]-6-fluoronorepinephrine [( 3H]-6F-NE), whereas in the blood, plasma and excretory organs most of the radioactivity was in noncatechol compounds such as O-methylated and conjugated metabolites. In sympathetically innervated organs, tissue/blood ratios exceeded 1.0 at all time points between 5 and 120 min after injection of [3H]-6F-DA and increased progressively (from 8 to 60 in myocardium), whereas the tissue/blood ratios in the kidney and liver increased by less than 2-fold during this interval. In all the studied tissues, the proportion of total tissue 3H that was due to [3H]F-NE increased progressively while that due to [3H]F-DA declined, consistent with conversion of [3H]F-DA to [3H]F-NE in vesicles in sympathetic nerve endings.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Constant i.v. infusion of both 18F-(-)-CF and 3H-(+)-CF in tracer amounts showed a marked difference in the tissue level of 18F-(-)-CF among various brain structures, whereas the values for 3H-(+)-CF were lower and much less variable. Co-infusion of unlabeled (-)-CF (1 mg/rat) did not change the tissue binding of 3H-(+)-CF in any brain structure, but reduced that of 18F-(-)-CF to the same level as 3H-(+)-CF. These results demonstrate an identical nonspecific tissue binding for (+)- and (-)-CF in vivo, and suggest that (+)-CF can be used to measure the \"nonspecific\" component of (-)-CF binding in brain. A nonlinear analysis of the 3H-(+)-CF data indicated the presence of both \"instantaneous\" and time-dependent components in nonspecific tissue binding and that nonspecific binding varied 1.5-fold in different brain structures. The combined 3H-(+)-CF and 18F-(-)-CF data were fitted to a four-compartment model, which includes parameters for capillary transport, \"instantaneous\" and time-dependent nonspecific tissue binding, as well as receptor association and dissociation. The receptor-association rate constant varied considerably in various structures of cerebrum (2.0-8.7 min-1), whereas receptor dissociation was estimated within a narrow range (0.12-0.17 min-1). The receptor binding potential (receptor association/dissociation) ranged between 12.7 and 56.2 and was in good agreement with previous estimates in vitro.\r"

  ".U": "91056492\r", 
  ".W": "The 5-HT2 (serotonin) receptor has traditionally been labeled with antagonist radioligands such as [3H]ketanserin and [3H]spiperone, which label both agonist high-affinity (guanyl nucleotide-sensitive) and agonist low-affinity (guanyl nucleotide-insensitive) states of this receptor. The hallucinogen 1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl)-2-aminopropane (DOI) is an agonist which labels the high-affinity guanyl nucleotide-sensitive state of brain 5-HT2 receptors selectively. In the present study, conditions for autoradiographic visualization of (+/-)-[125I]DOI-labeled 5-HT2 receptors were optimized and binding to slide-mounted sections was characterized with respect to pharmacology, guanyl nucleotide sensitivity and anatomical distribution. In slide-mounted rat brain sections (+/-)-[125I]DOI binding was saturable, of high affinity (KD approximately 4 nM) and displayed a pharmacologic profile typical of 5-HT2 receptors. Consistent with coupling of 5-HT2 receptors in the high-affinity state to a guanyl nucleotide regulatory protein, [125I]DOI binding was inhibited by guanyl nucleotides but not by adenosine triphosphate. Patterns of autoradiographic distribution of [125I]DOI binding to 5-HT2 receptors were similar to those seen with [3H]ketanserin- and [125I]-lysergic acid diethylamide-labeled 5-HT2 receptors. However, the density of 5-HT2 receptors labeled by the agonist [125I]DOI was markedly lower (30-50%) than that labeled by the antagonist [3H]ketanserin. High densities of [125I]DOI labeling were present in olfactory bulb, anterior regions of cerebral cortex (layer IV), claustrum, caudate putamen, globus pallidus, ventral pallidum, islands of Calleja, mammillary nuclei and inferior olive. Binding in hippocampus, thalamus and hypothalamus was generally sparse. Of note, choroid plexus, a site rich in 5-HT1c receptors had a high density of [125I]DOI binding sites but [3H]ketanserin binding in this region was low. Studies in which [125I]DOI binding to 5-HT2 receptors was blocked with spiperone revealed persisting robust [125I]DOI binding in choroid plexus, which was guanyl nucleotide-sensitive and displayed a pharmacologic profile consistent with its binding to 5-HT1c receptors. These studies suggest that [125I]DOI may be useful as a radiolabel for visualizing the agonist high-affinity state of 5-HT2 receptors and for visualizing 5-HT1c receptors.\r"

Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 237: 919-925, 1986; Gilbert et al., J. Infect. Dis. 159: 945-953, 1989). We have assessed the influence of polyaspartic acid on the early alterations induced in kidney cortex by gentamicin, namely the lysosomal phospholipidosis and the increase in cell turnover. We used an infused rat model in which animals received a total dose of 100 mg/kg of gentamicin over 12 hr. Renal cortex was examined 2 hr (day 0) and 48 hr (day 2) after treatment. All animals received an injection of [3H]thymidine (200 microCi i.p.) before sacrifice. Coadministration of polyaspartic acid (drug-polypeptide mass ratio 1:2.5) did not modify the drug serum levels, as recorded during or shortly after the infusion. Yet, it was associated with 1) an increased (approximately 35%) drug cortical content at day 0; 2) a significant protection against both biochemical (decrease of sphingomyelinase activity at day 0; increase of lipid phosphorus content at day 2) and morphological (enlargement of lysosomes and deposition of myeloid bodies at day 2) signs of lysosomal phospholipidosis in proximal tubular cells; and 3) an almost complete protection against increased cell turnover (mostly in proximal tubules) in cortex at day 2, as assessed by the measurement of [3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA and the enumeration of S-phase cells after histoautoradiography. In addition, morphological studies revealed a larger number of apical vacuoles in proximal tubular cells of animals receiving polyaspartic acid alone (but not in combination with gentamicin), and the deposition of osmiophilic, homogenous material in the lysosomes of animals receiving the combination of gentamicin and polyaspartic acid. Together with the results reported in two companion papers (Kishore et al., J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 867-874, and 875-885, 1990), these results provide evidence that protection afforded by polyaspartic acid extends to the earliest cellular alterations described in kidney for gentamicin, namely the lysosomal phospholipidosis, suggesting that this protecting agent exerts blocking effect from this step in the cascade of events relating drug cortical accumulation to renal toxicity.\r"

  ".W": "Coadministration of polyaspartic acid protects rats against aminoglycoside-induced nephrotoxicity, with respect to functional and pathological changes as well as to early signs of renal alterations (lysosomal phospholipidosis of proximal tubular cells, increased proliferation of proximal tubular and peritubular cells), without reduction, but actually by increasing the drug cortical content (Williams et al., J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 237: 919, 1986; Gilbert et al., J. Infect. Dis. 159: 945, 1989; Beauchamp et al., 1990). Because aminoglycoside accumulation in kidney cortex involves their segregation in lysosomes, we have examined the possibility of formation of intracellular aminoglycoside-polyaspartic acid complexes that would render the drug less toxic. We found that in vitro polyaspartic acid (MW 9-15,000) 1) binds gentamicin with an optimum at acidic pH (5.4), 2) displaces it from negatively charged liposomes and 3) restores the activity of gentamicin-inhibited lysosomal phospholipase A1 toward phosphatidylcholine included in negatively charged liposomes. In parallel, we also observed that at pH 7.0, polyaspartic acid binds and displaces gentamicin from purified brush-border membrane vesicles, causing an apparent decrease of affinity of gentamicin for these membranes, which was falsely interpreted by Williams et al., J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 237: 919, 1986 as \"competition for a common membrane binding site.\" Assuming that, after its administration in vivo, polyaspartic acid gains access to lysosomes of proximal tubular cells, as many low molecular weight proteins and polypeptides do, our results suggest that protection against gentamicin-induced nephrotoxicity is obtained by the binding of the aminoglycoside to the polyanion in lysosomes, preventing thereby the development of phospholipidosis and therefore interfering with the cascade of events leading from drug accumulation to nephrotoxicity.\r"

  ".U": "91056495\r", 
  ".W": "Poly-L-aspartic acid (poly-L-Asp) protects rats against gentamicin (GM)-induced nephrotoxicity (functional and pathological changes) and early cortical alterations (phospholipidosis and increase in cell turnover) without decreasing, but actually increasing, the renal accumulation of the drug. We suggested that this protection occurs through the complexation of GM by poly-L-Asp, after their pinocytosis and accumulation in the lysosomes of the renal cortex (Kishore et al., J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 867-874, 1990). Here we examine further our proposal by comparatively assessing poly-L-Asp (as provided by the Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO; MW 9-11,000), with two other polyanionic peptides, viz, poly-L-glutamic (poly-L-Glu; MW 14,300) and poly-D-glutamic (poly-D-Glu; MW 20,000) acids obtained from the same supplier. In vitro, all three polyanions showed a similar capacity to bind GM, to displace it from anionic phospholipids at acid pH and thereby to decrease the inhibitory potency of GM toward lysosomal phospholipase A1. In vivo, however, only poly-L-Asp and poly-D-Glu were able to prevent the development of GM-induced renal lysosomal phospholipidosis as assessed by key biochemical criteria (increase in lipid phosphorus and decrease of acid sphingomyelinase activity) and by examination of the lysosomal content in the electron microscope (accumulation of myeloid bodies). Based on these criteria, poly-L-Glu completely failed to protect. In vitro, poly-L-Glu was 13- to 17-fold more susceptible to hydrolysis by liver lysosomal extracts at pH 5.4 after 48 hr incubation, as compared to poly-L-Asp and poly-D-Glu, respectively. Assuming that all three polyanions tested are transported and accumulated in lysosomes of renal cortex to the same extent and that their respective rates of hydrolysis therein compare to that measured in vitro, these results suggest that stability of polyanions in lysosomes is an essential requisite for protection against GM-induced phospholipidosis and thus strengthens our earlier proposal that the site of action of poly-L-Asp must be in lysosomes. Although protecting from phospholipidosis, poly-D-Glu, however, caused a so far undescribed lysosomal storage disorder consisting of the accumulation of osmiophilic, nonlamellar material. This study, therefore, also demonstrates that not all polyanions resistant to lysosomal enzymes can be used as nephroprotectants, inasmuch as these, as is the case for poly-D-Glu, may cause renal alterations on their own.\r"

Rat albumin was cationized at pH = 7.8 with hexamethylenediamine, and the isoelectric point of the protein was raised from 5.5 to approximately 8. The cationized protein was monomeric based on mobility during sodium dodecylsulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. After radiolabeling, the cationized rat serum albumin (RSA) was taken up by isolated rat or bovine brain microvessels, whereas radio-labeled native RSA was not taken up by the capillaries in vitro. The brain volume of distribution of the 3H-cationized RSA increased linearly over a 5-hr period after an intravenous injection of the isotope and reached a value of 46 +/- 3 microliter/g (mean +/- S.E.) by 5 hr, whereas the brain volume of distribution of the 125I-native RSA was constant during the 5-hr time period (9.3 +/- 0.7 microliter/g, which is equal to the brain blood volume). The cationized and native RSAs were administered daily (Monday through Friday) at a dose of 1 mg/kg subcutaneously to groups of rats for 4- and 8-week periods. This dosage regimen resulted in no discernible toxicity, based on the findings of normal weight gain, normal tissue histology and normal serum chemistry. Therefore, cationized rat albumin may be used in future studies that use the repetitive administration of cationized rat albumin chimeric peptides for the evaluation of the transport of these substances through the blood-brain barrier in vivo.\r"

  ".W": "The actions of the nonpeptide kappa-opioid receptor agonists, U 50488H (1-100 microM) and U 69593 (50-200 microM), on guinea pig hippocampal CA3 neurons were investigated in vitro by means of intra- and extracellular recording techniques. The compounds reduced the efficacy of synaptic transmission at the mossy fiber-CA3 synapse, and, simultaneously, enhanced the neuronal direct excitability. Intracellular recordings from CA3 neurons suggested two components underlying the drugs' excitatory actions: 1) Due to an apparent decrease in membrane leak conductance, the compounds enhanced the neuronal input resistance in a dose-dependent fashion. 2) The fast after-hyperpolarization following spontaneous or evoked action potentials was found to be substantially impaired in the presence of the drugs. In addition, extra- and intracellular recordings provided evidence that, by reducing the fast sodium conductance, both compounds exerted a local anesthetic action. The effects of U 50488H were antagonized neither by naloxone (2-50 microM) nor by the kappa-opioid receptor antagonist, nor-binaltorphimine (10-20 microM), indicating that the drug-induced effects represent unspecific actions not linked to activation of opioid receptors.\r"

Morphologic changes, a microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) immunohistochemical study and quantitative autoradiographic study using [3H]phorbol 12, 13-dibutyrate ([3H]PDBu) were evaluated in the hippocampus after ischemia. KB-5666 (3-50 mg/kg, i.v.) showed protective effects against neuronal death of the CA1 subfield 5 min before ischemia, immediately or 1 hr after ischemia, but not 4 hr after ischemia. KB-5666 (i.p.) also showed protective effects in a dose-dependent manner immediately after ischemia. Furthermore, KB-5666 dose-dependently prevented a marked decrease in microtubule-associated protein 2 immunoreactivity in the dendritic fields of the CA1 pyramidal cells after ischemia. The [3H]PDBu binding activity in the stratum oriens and the stratum lacunosum-moleculare of the CA1 subfield was reduced by 19 and 30%, respectively, 7 days after ischemia. [3H]PDBu binding sites were unchanged in the stratum oriens in the CA3 subfield. By contrast, in the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus, the [3H]PDBu binding activity increased by 15%. KB-5666 (i.v.) prevented a decrease in the [3H]PDBu binding activity in the stratum oriens and stratum lacunosum-moleculare of the CA1 subfield and an increase in the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus. These histologic, immunohistochemical and receptor-autoradiographic data indicate that KB-5666 protects the brain from both cellular and functional consequences of ischemia.\r"

  ".W": "Parkinson's disease is commonly treated with orally applied levodopa (l-dopa). However, because this treatment modality is associated with a number of undesirable side effects, some due to plasma fluctuations, we have developed a slow-release polymer system that can be used to deliver l-dopa continuously for extended periods of time in vitro (greater than 600 days) and in vivo (at least 225 days) in rats. In vitro l-dopa release was evaluated using polymer matrices with appropriately selected parameters (loading and geometry), and zero-order (linear) release of l-dopa was observed for more than 600 days (in highly loaded, noncoated material first-order kinetics), in some instances in mg quantities per day. This was achieved even in polymer matrices, which did not possess a dissolution limiting barrier. Scanning electron-microscopic analysis suggests that the mechanism of release is dissolution through channels and pores within the polymer matrix. To assess in vivo release, l-dopa was quantified in plasma from rats given s.c. implants of l-dopa polymer matrices using high-performance liquid chromatography. We observed release of l-dopa for a period of at least 225 days after an initial burst of release. Continuous release of l-dopa from s.c. implanted slow-release polymer matrices has several advantages over oral delivery: 1) l-dopa plasma fluctuations are eliminated, 2) patient compliance issues are reduced and 3) the gastrointestinal tract is circumvented, thus requiring a lower dose.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

It is reported here that RTX, like capsaicin, acts selectively on primary sensory neurons in rats to produce ultrastructural alterations and calcitonin gene-related peptide depletion. To evaluate RTX actions on capsaicin-sensitive nociceptors of vagal origin in the lung, the activation and desensitization of the pulmonary chemoreflex in both rats and cats were examined. In rats, RTX (2 ng-5 micrograms/kg i.v.) failed to elicit the full reflex triad (apnea, systemic hypotension and bradycardia); RTX did, however, desensitize the pulmonary chemosensitive receptors to capsaicin and phenyldiguanide. This effect is not achievable upon acute capsaicin treatment. RTX pretreatment (300 micrograms/kg s.c.) of rats also abolished the neurogenic edema formation, another response mediated via capsaicin-sensitive vagal fibers, in rat trachea to challenge either by capsaicin or ether. The effect of electrical stimulation of vagal nerve was not impaired after RTX injection, indicating that RTX desensitized only the capsaicin-sensitive pathway whereas the parasympathetic pathway remained unaltered. In cats, unlike in the rat, the full pulmonary chemoreflex occurred in response to 0.1 micrograms/kg RTX. It is concluded that RTX is a selective probe for capsaicin-sensitive neural pathways but the spectrum of action of the two compounds is not identical. The failure of RTX to provoke the pulmonary chemoreflex in the rat, which is the main limiting factor in the use of capsaicin, suggests a further advantage to the use of RTX for probing capsaicin-sensitive neural pathways.\r"

Reestablishment of arterial flow is considered to be the ideal treatment, yet substantial tissue loss can occur before this is accomplished. Using a rat hindlimb model we investigated whether the administration of 100% oxygen would decrease tissue hypoxia from acute arterial occlusion. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were used, and Po2 recordings were taken from the gastrocnemius muscle by use of an oxygen electrode. Baseline muscle Po2 was recorded, and then the femoral artery was occluded. Repeat recordings were made after 20 minutes of ventilation with room air and after an additional 20 minutes of ventilation with 100% oxygen (N = 10). Control groups consisted of animals undergoing occlusion but continued on room air (N = 3) and animals undergoing sham occlusion but receiving the period of 100% oxygen ventilation (N = 3). Femoral artery occlusion produced a reduction in muscle Po2 from 28.0 +/- 1.4 to 6.1 +/- 2.0 (mean +/- SEM, p less than 0.001). Ventilation with 100% oxygen reversed the tissue hypoxia produced by occlusion (27.3 +/- 2.0, p less than 0.001). The administration of 100% oxygen without femoral artery occlusion resulted in a higher tissue Po2 than the occluded + oxygen group (94 +/- 12 vs 27.3 +/- 2.0, p less than 0.001). Mean arterial blood pressure increased in the experimental group concomitant with the administration of 100% oxygen, but there was no correlation between final blood pressure and final tissue oxygen tension.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Femoral polytetrafluoroethylene grafts were implanted bilaterally in a paired fashion (n = 22). Detailed local hemodynamic measurements were made by use of color Doppler ultrasound imaging at 1, 4, 8, and 12 weeks after implant. Measurements included volumetric flow rate and Doppler-derived spectral window (percent window) as a measure of turbulence. Amplitude and velocity of vessel wall movement were also measured. Volume of perivascular tissue vibration quantitated kinetic energy transfer through the vessel wall. Volumetric flow rate (end to end, 1013 +/- 70 ml/min; end to side, 1015 +/- 72 ml/min), percent window (end to end, 6.6% +/- 0.6%, end to side, 5.6% +/- 0.4%) and volume of perivascular tissue vibration (end to end, 19.6 +/- 1.2 ml, end to side, 16.3 +/- 1.8 ml) were statistically equivalent in the two graft types (end to end vs end to side p greater than 0.05). Both graft types developed venous intimal-medial thickening of a similar magnitude: end to end, 0.35 +/- 0.05 mm, end to side, 0.43 +/- 0.09 mm, normal vein 0.070 +/- 0.004 mm (analysis of variance [ANOVA] p less than 0.001, p less than 0.01 for end to end or end to side vs control, end to end vs end to side p greater than 0.05 by Student-Newman-Keuls test). The best correlations with venous intimal-medial thickening were obtained from inverse percent window (r = 0.84, p less than 0.001) and volume of perivascular tissue vibration (r = 0.68, p less than 0.001). In the end to end configuration the relative amplitude of venous wall movement decreased, and the relative velocity of wall motion increased over time. We conclude that in the circumstances of this high flow arteriovenous graft model the end-to-end venous anastomosis does not significantly differ from the end-to-side venous anastomosis in terms of flow stability, turbulence, or kinetic energy transfer. The magnitude of the hyperplastic response is statistically equivalent for the two anastomotic types, but the pattern is somewhat different, possibly providing evidence for differences in stress distribution. Differences in the relative amplitude and velocity of vessel wall movement suggest that anastomotic geometry may affect the way in which kinetic energy is dissipated at the graft/vessel interface.\r"

  ".W": "Reports of reconstructive surgery for peripheral vascular disease have been relatively uncommon in patients with end-stage renal disease. Between 1980 and 1989, 39 patients with end-stage renal disease underwent revascularization of 56 limbs. Fifty-two primary infrainguinal and four secondary infrainguinal bypass grafts were performed. In addition, nine thrombectomies were performed. At the time of surgery 37 patients were on dialysis; three had functioning kidney transplants. The indications for revascularization were gangrene, rest pain, or ulceration in all except three limbs with disabling claudication. Reversed, nonreversed, or in situ vein was used in 25 of the 52 primary infrainguinal revascularizations performed. Polytetrafluoroethylene was used in 25. Two procedures used a combination of polytetrafluoroethylene and vein. The primary patencies for all infrainguinal procedures at 1 and 2 years were 77% and 68%, respectively. Four perioperative deaths occurred in the infrainguinal group (7.7%). An additional death occurred after thrombectomy for late graft closure. Three deaths were a result of myocardial infarction. One patient on peritoneal dialysis developed uncontrolled sepsis. At 3 years 39% of patients were alive, and 84% of the limbs were salvaged. Among the cases studied no group was identified that represented unacceptable operative risk. Results compared well with reported patencies for patients subjected to infrainguinal revascularization procedures. Limb revascularization in patients with end-stage renal disease may be performed by use of similar criteria to those used for other patients with peripheral vascular disease.\r"

  ".W": "The complexity of infrarenal aortic reconstruction increases when bypass grafts to revascularize associated renal and visceral arteries are needed. Lesions in these vessels, however, are usually limited to their aortic orifices and therefore are amenable to retroperitoneal transaortic endarterectomy. A combined infrarenal aortic reconstruction and transaortic endarterectomy of the renal/visceral vessels was used in 18 (16%) of 120 patients undergoing elective infrarenal aortic reconstruction over a 2-year-period. Transaortic endarterectomy was performed primarily for renal preservation in 11 patients with bilateral, high-grade renal artery stenoses and abnormal renal function (serum creatinine greater than or equal to 1.9 mg/dl). In seven patients transaortic endarterectomy was performed as a secondary procedure during the course of complex reconstruction of aneurysmal or occlusive aortic disease. Mean serum creatinine, which was elevated preoperatively in 14 (78%) patients (3.3 mg/dl), decreased significantly after the operation (2.0 mg/dl, p less than 0.01). A single death occurred in the 18 patients undergoing transaortic endarterectomy. Renal function preservation can be achieved by renal revascularization in patients with bilateral renal artery stenoses and decreased renal function. The retroperitoneal approach to aortic reconstruction and the use of transaortic endarterectomy allows correction of most renal/visceral vessel involvement in complex aortic revascularization procedures.\r"

  ".W": "The indications, morbidity, and efficacy of combined reconstruction of the abdominal aorta and visceral arteries (renal and superior mesenteric; excluding suprarenal aortic aneurysms) were analyzed retrospectively in 29 consecutive patients who underwent surgery from June 1984 through February 1990. Seventeen men and 12 women ages 32 to 76 years (mean, 66 years) were studied. Follow-up was complete in all patients to either death or calendar year 1989 to 1990 (mean, 31.9 months; range, 2 to 66 months). All patients underwent bypass of angiographically proven severe lesions of one renal artery (19 patients), both renal arteries (8 patients), or the superior mesenteric artery and renal arteries (2 patients), in concert with synthetic distal aortic replacement for occlusive disease (10 patients) or aneurysm (19 patients). Indications for renal artery repair included severe hypertension in 13 patients, ischemic renal insufficiency in 8 patients, and lesion morphology alone in 8 patients. Operative mortality rate was 3 of 29 (10.3%), and each death was the result of multisystem organ failure. Nonfatal complications occurred in 11 of the 26 survivors (42%), and this group differed significantly from the uncomplicated 15 patients only in having a higher mean preoperative serum creatinine (2.5 +/- 1.1 mg/dl vs 1.6 +/- 0.9 mg/dl, p = 0.04, t test). The mortality rate of patients with preoperative serum creatinine greater than or equal to 2.0 mg/dl, was 15.4% (2/13 patients), compared to 6.2% (1/16) in patients with creatinine less than 2.0 mg/dl. Three late deaths occurred (2 stroke, 1 cancer). Hypertension control improved in 64% of patients overall, and in 7 of 9 patients whose major operative indication was renovascular hypertension. Renal function remained stable or improved in 12 of 15 patients (80%) with renal insufficiency, but 3 patients progressed to require dialysis. Long-term graft patency was demonstrated by angiography or on duplex scan in all studied survivors (21 patients). Although operative risks are clearly increased compared to less complex vascular procedures, careful patient selection and management will yield a favorable outcome in most patients with such combined lesions.\r"

Indications for surgery included symptoms of vertebrobasilar insufficiency in 16 (52%), upper extremity ischemia in six (19%), both vertebrobasilar insufficiency and extremity ischemia in four (13%), and stroke and/or hemispheric transient ischemic attacks in four (13%) patients. One patient (3%) had angina pectoris caused by \"coronary-subclavian steal.\" Formal bypass grafts were performed in 28 (90%) cases by means of polyterafluoroethylene (24), Dacron (2), or saphenous vein (2), and carotid-subclavian transposition was performed in three (10%) cases. Synchronous procedures included carotid endarterectomy (4), carotid-carotid bypass (1), and axillobrachial bypass (1). There was no operative mortality. Thirty-day primary patency was 97%. Follow-up has ranged from 1 to 121 (mean, 42) months. Three grafts (polytetrafluoroethylene) have occluded during follow-up yielding long-term primary patency of 92% at 5 years and 83% at 8 years. Relief of symptoms was initially achieved in 30 (97%) patients. Recurrent symptoms have developed in six (20%) patients from 2 to 55 (mean, 26) months after surgery, including two with occluded and four with patent grafts. Symptom-free survival is 89% at 1 year, 84% at 2 years, and 71% at 7 years of follow-up.

  ".W": "Five hundred thirty-nine patients with no symptoms of cerebral ischemia undergoing coronary artery bypass were preoperatively evaluated for presence of carotid stenosis by noninvasive methods (duplex scanning and ocular pneumoplethysmography-Gee). Overall prevalence of carotid stenosis greater than 75% was higher (8.7%) than that generally reported. Age greater than 60 years was significantly related to presence of carotid stenosis greater than 75% (11.3% vs 3.8%, p = 0.003). Risk factors such as hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and smoking were not predictive for carotid stenosis, postoperative stroke, or death. Carotid stenosis greater than 75% (odds ratio 9.87, p less than 0.005) and coronary artery bypass redo (odds ratio 5.26, p less than 0.05) were both independent predictors of stroke risk. Patients were divided into four groups: group 1, minimal or mild degree of carotid stenosis (less than 50%), not submitted to prophylactic carotid endarterectomy (432 patients, 80.1%); group 2, moderate degree of stenosis (50% to 75%), no prophylactic carotid endarterectomy (60 patients, 11.2%); group 3, severe carotid stenosis; (greater than 75%), submitted to prophylactic carotid endarterectomy (19 patients, 3.5%), group 4, severe carotid stenosis (greater than 75%) no prophylactic carotid endarterectomy (28 patients, 5.2%). Patients in group 4 had significantly higher stroke rate (14.3%) compared to the other three groups (1.1%) (p = 0.0019). The finding of carotid stenosis greater than 75% in patients over 60 years of age was associated with occurrence of stroke in 15% of cases. Carotid screening is helpful to determine patients at increased risk of stroke and should be performed in patients greater than 60 years.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Between 1978 and 1988, 215 patients with an average age of 67 years, underwent 246 carotid endarterectomies. Two hundred ten (85.4%) patients were symptomatic, and 36 (14.6%) were asymptomatic. Six patients (2.4%) had a postoperative stroke, and all had immediate reoperation. One of these patients died (30 day mortality rate, 0.4% for the series), and two (0.8%) recovered completely, whereas three (1.2%) had a mild permanent neurologic deficit. Two patients (0.8%) had nonfatal myocardial infarction. Mean follow-up of 42.2 months (range, 1 to 126 months) was achieved. At 5 and 8 years actuarial survival rates of 82% and 66% and stroke-free survival rates of 67% and 37% were observed. Actuarial stroke free rates of 90% at 5 and 8 years were noted. By introducing and observing guidelines that required preoperative study of most clearly defined classes of patients before admission for surgical treatment, the average length of stay for carotid endarterectomy was lowered from 9.5 days in the first 5 years of the study to 5.8 days in the second 5 years (p = 0.001). Average hospital charges, expressed in constant dollars, decreased from $3113 in the first 5 years to $2620 in the second 5 years (p = 0.02) despite an 88% inflationary increase in medical consumer price index. This experience shows that the length of hospitalization of patients with carotid endarterectomy can be reduced and the cost of admission lowered without untoward effect on perioperative morbidity and mortality rates.\r"

A high-resolution photochromic tracer technique was used to visualize the flow in orthogonal planes and to determine the axial wall shear stress profiles for both steady and pulsatile flows over a range of physiologically relevant conditions. The flow field showed qualitative similarities to those seen in curved vessel: rapidly moving fluid from the graft section affects the bed of the host vessel, that is, the wall opposite the anastomosis, eventually advancing down the host vessel in a spiraling motion. A small mobile separation zone was noted at the toe of the anastomosis. Comparison of wall shear stress profiles with previously reported preferential sites for the development of intimal hyperplasia supported a low wall shear stress and/or flow separation pathogenesis hypothesis. One notable exception was the bed of the host artery that appeared to be subjected to a complex hemodynamic environment.\r"

  ".U": "91056631\r", 
  ".W": "One hundred two patients undergoing abdominal aortic reconstructive surgery were prospectively, randomly allocated to two groups, one of which was monitored with a central venous catheter and the other with a pulmonary artery catheter. Patients with uncompensated cardiopulmonary or renal disease were excluded from the study. General anesthesia was administered for the surgical procedure, and the patients were followed through hospital discharge. No statistically significant differences occurred between the two groups with regard to morbidity (perioperative cardiac, pulmonary or renal sequelae), mortality rate, duration of intensive care, postoperative hospital stay, or cost of hospitalization. The one statistically significant difference between groups was the professional fee charged for anesthetic care, which was higher for patients with pulmonary artery catheters than for those with central venous catheters. In conclusion, we prospectively gathered data from most patients presented for abdominal aortic reconstructive surgery. Our data seem to indicate that the choice of central venous catheter or pulmonary artery catheter monitoring makes little difference in outcome after abdominal aortic reconstructive surgery, and that for many patients pulmonary artery catheters are not necessary to give appropriate, adequate care. Because of the size of the sample, however, declarations of epidemiologic significance would be unfounded. Therefore large-scale, multicenter studies addressing such outcomes remain necessary.\r"

Four hundred fifty-seven lesions were measured before and after a 26-month interval by computer-based quantitative angiography. The primary outcome variable was within-patient mean change in percent area stenosis. Mean low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels decreased from 7.32 +/- 1.5 to 4.45 +/- 1.6 mmol/L. The mean change in percent area stenosis among controls was +0.80, indicating progression, while the mean change for the treatment group was -1.53, indicating regression (P = .039 by two-tailed t test for the difference between groups). Regression among women, analyzed separately, was also significant. The change in percent area stenosis was correlated with low-density lipoprotein levels on trial. We conclude that reduction of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels can induce regression of atherosclerotic lesions of the coronary arteries in patients with familial hypercholesterolemia. The anticipation of benefit from treatment applies to women and men alike.\r"

Changes in blood lipid, lipoprotein-cholesterol, and apolipoprotein levels were maintained, and at 4 years significantly more drug-treated subjects demonstrated nonprogression (52% drug- vs 15% placebo-treated) and regression (18% drug- vs 6% placebo-treated) in native coronary artery lesions. Significantly fewer drug-treated subjects developed new lesions in native coronary arteries (14% drug- vs 40% placebo-treated) and bypass grafts (16% drug- vs 38% placebo-treated). These results confirm CLAS-I findings and indicate that regression can continue for 4 years.

  ".W": "This article describes the validity and utility of screening tests for total cholesterol levels in school-age children to predict those who, when adults, will have cholesterol levels that the National Cholesterol Education Program suggests need continuing surveillance and intervention. Two thousand three hundred sixty-seven children aged 8 to 18 years were examined on several occasions and were followed up to ages 20 to 30 years. Of children with cholesterol concentrations exceeding the 75th percentile on two occasions, 75% of girls and 56% of boys would not qualify for intervention as adults by the National Cholesterol Education Program criteria. Of children with cholesterol levels exceeding the 90th percentile on two occasions, 57% of girls and 30% of boys would not qualify for intervention as adults. Because the efficacy, safety, acceptability, and cost of treatment for high cholesterol concentrations in childhood is evolving, the need for universal screening of childhood cholesterol levels must be considered carefully in view of the number of children with high levels of cholesterol who, as adults, do not meet the criteria for intervention suggested by the National Cholesterol Education Program.\r"

  ".W": "Because some authorities have proposed blood cholesterol screening for children to prevent coronary heart disease, we reviewed published studies to estimate the potential risks and benefits of such screening. Childhood cholesterol levels are a poor predictor of high cholesterol levels in young adulthood and will be an even poorer predictor of coronary heart disease later in life. There is no evidence that blood cholesterol levels can be lowered more easily in children than in adults, and it seems unlikely that cholesterol reduction in childhood will be much more effective at preventing coronary heart disease than cholesterol reduction begun in middle age. Screening and interventions to lower blood cholesterol levels for millions of children would be expensive, could lead to labeling and family conflicts, and may cause malnutrition and increased noncardiovascular mortality. Because the benefits of cholesterol screening are unlikely to exceed these risks, we conclude that children should not be screened for high blood cholesterol levels.\r"

  ".U": "91056655\r", 
  ".W": "In prospective epidemiologic studies of coronary heart disease, a single measurement of cholesterol is made to assess its relationship to the risk of coronary disease. Statistical theory states that if this measurement is subject to within-individual variability, the strength of the relationship will be underestimated. This is empirically shown for the example of plasma cholesterol. For the Lipid Research Clinics Follow-up Study population (comprising 2170 white men over 30 years of age), the age-adjusted coronary heart disease mortality regression coefficient increases from .453 to .496 if the average of two cholesterol measurements is used instead of a single measurement. Since the correlation between the two repeated cholesterol measurements is .815, an increase in the regression coefficient up to .556 would be expected if the true cholesterol values were available. Thus, epidemiologic studies have substantially underestimated the strength of the relationship between cholesterol levels and the risk of coronary disease by calculating the relationship on the basis of a single cholesterol determination.\r"

A broad consensus to this effect has led to the establishment of the National Cholesterol Education Program. Although the available evidence fully justifies this program, its practical application to the American public has generated a series of new questions that must be explored. For example, it can be questioned whether reduction in coronary risk through lowering cholesterol levels extends to both sexes and all age groups. For people with high cholesterol levels, dietary modification is undoubtedly the first step of management, but the fraction of people responding adequately to dietary change remains to be determined. Finally, indications for drug therapy and choice of drugs need further exploration, particularly in the area of cost vs benefit. Thus, continuing research must be carried out in parallel with clinical and public health application of cholesterol education.\r"

In this paper, we studied six generations (51 people) of the family of a 24-year-old man with osteogenic sarcoma of the mandible. Twelve malignancies in 11 people, including several rare tumors, were revealed. Mean age of presentation was 24 years old. Nine of the 11 patients died of disease. One developed a second primary. Two tumors presented in the head and neck. Transmission was autosomal dominant. The karyotypes of two family members were normal. Identification of Li-Fraumeni syndrome in a family is important in determining appropriate follow-up for the patient and family. Such families are models for studying carcinogenesis.\r"

Most acute Bell's palsy cases demonstrate facial nerve enhancement, usually in the distal internal auditory canal and labyrinthine/geniculate segments. Other segments demonstrate enhancement less often. Gadolinium enhancement occurs regardless of the severity of the paralysis and can persist after clinical improvement of the paralysis. The findings of this study corroborate other evidence that the segments of the facial nerve most often involved in Bell's palsy are the only segments that are most often enhanced with gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging. The role of gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging in the management of Bell's palsy patients is discussed.\r"

Sialolithiasis is the usual etiology in cases of parotitis, although occasionally severe recurrent parotid infections are superimposed on underlying Sjogren's disease. Total parotidectomy with facial nerve dissection has been used in such cases in our department and has proved to be an excellent way to manage this disease. A summary of our results indicate that the recurring infections were eradicated and that the complication rate is tolerable, considering the magnitude of the problem. We feel that it is better to use surgical management early rather than wait for the formation of fistulae or abscesses.\r"

Closure of the air-bone gap to within 10 dB was seen in 100% of the patients. There was no significant sensorineural hearing loss, vertigo, or facial weakness.

Obstruction of the endotracheal tube with a mucous plug occurred in one case. The apneic technique described in this paper provides a laser operative field free of an endotracheal tube, virtually eliminating the danger of a laser fire. It is a relatively safe and effective means of performing laser laryngeal surgery. In addition, the Laser-Flex endotracheal tube appears to be an acceptable alternative to a metallic tape-wrapped endotracheal tube.\r"

Autogenous and easily accessible, it is a suitable substance to cover the vestibule in total stapedectomy, and to seal around the prosthesis in small-fenestra stapedotomy. The incidence of complications from the use of perichondrium in this manner is exceedingly low. We report a case where tragal perichondrium in the oval window resulted in the proliferation of cartilage. The cartilage displaced the stapes prosthesis, resulting in a conductive loss. Although the chondrogenic potential of perichondrium is known, we are not aware of other reports implicating this as a cause of failure in stapes surgery. The pertinent clinical and experimental literature regarding chondrogenesis is reviewed. This information suggests that the formation of cartilage from perichondrium in the oval window might be influenced by mechanical trauma and tissue orientation.\r"

When the nerve could be seen, gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging accurately revealed the lesion site as well as the known extent, which in some cases was not predicted by topognostic testing. This technique appears to provide accurate lesion-site testing and may have importance in surgical planning. Currently used topognostic tests of facial nerve function are frequently inaccurate and can only determine the most proximal lesion site when there are multiple or extensive lesions. The focal nerve enhancement seen in nerve injury, globally increased signal intensity within the temporal bone after trauma, and increased signal intensity within the dura after surgery can occasionally mask nerve lesions and may be confused with tumors.\r"

This combination of signs and symptoms has been reported under two clinical entities: Bazex's syndrome and tripe palm. This paraneoplastic syndrome is of interest to head and neck surgeons due to the location of the primary tumor, the site of metastatic disease, and the ability to cure the cutaneous disease by surgical removal of the primary tumor. In our patient, a squamous cell carcinoma of the lung not detectable on chest x-ray presented as a cervical mass accompanied by cutaneous changes on the palms and fingernails. Recognition of the relationship of the dermatologic changes to malignancy of a specific body region eventually led to the detection of the primary tumor. The characteristics of these paraneoplastic syndromes were reviewed in this report.\r"

Seven scans revealed middle ear and mastoid disease; three scans were consistent with central nervous system (CNS) pathology; and eight scans demonstrated no abnormalities. CT scanning was found useful in localizing otopathology and diagnosing CNS toxoplasmosis, aural polyps, osteomyelitis, mastoiditis, and middle ear effusion due to hypertrophic lymphoid tissue. The authors conclude that AIDS patients with sensorineural hearing loss should undergo contrast-enhanced brain CT scans to rule out CNS pathology; AIDS status does not alter criteria for CT scanning in patients with conductive hearing loss; and that images of the nasopharynx should be included on temporal bone CT scans of patients with conductive hearing loss in order to exclude eustachian tube obstruction by hypertrophic lymphoid tissue.\r"

Using monoclonal antibodies and the immunoperoxidase staining technique we have investigated the effect of Merthiolate, Cialit, formaldehyde/Merthiolate, and formaldehyde/Cialit preservation techniques on monomorphic determinants of class II transplantation antigens in human tracheal allografts. Unpreserved grafts were found to express class II antigens. These antigens were totally destroyed after 7 days in formaldehyde and 42 days in Cialit and Merthiolate. Preservation in Cialit and Merthiolate showed a gradual disintegration of the histological structures. In contrast, buffered formaldehyde did not appear to alter the histological structure of the tracheal graft. Irrespective of the mode of preservation, the cartilaginous tissue appeared to persist virtually unaffected. No essential differences were observed between the immunological staining of tracheal grafts preserved in Cialit and Merthiolate.\r"

The system identifies potentially life-threatening conditions on the basis of laboratory findings and then generates appropriate warnings and transmits them to clinicians. Use of the system has led to a significant increase in the proportion of patients in life-threatening situations who have received appropriate care (50.8% before implementation vs. 62.5% afterward, P less than 0.05). Among patients with hypokalemia, falling potassium levels, hyperkalemia, hypokalemia during treatment with digoxin, hyponatremia, falling sodium levels, hypernatremia, hypoglycemia, or hyperglycemia, the average length of time spent in the life-threatening situation has decreased from 30.4 to 15.7 hours (P less than 0.05) and the average length of stay has decreased from 14.6 to 8.8 days (P less than 0.05). There has been little change in the proportion of patients with findings indicating metabolic acidosis who have received appropriate care (32.3 vs. 34.6%). We conclude that CLAS has an important role in patient care at our hospital.\r"

The current study reports therapeutic efficacy for ketorolac ophthalmic solution (an NSAID) in the prophylaxis of angiographic aphakic CME (ACME) after cataract surgery without concurrent corticosteroids for the first time. Fifty patients with bilateral cataracts were enrolled in this placebo-controlled, paired-comparison, double-masked study. Eleven patients had evidence of angiographic ACME on postoperative day 40. Two of these patients demonstrated bilateral ACME, one patient had ACME in the NSAID-treated eye, and eight patients demonstrated ACME in the placebo-treated eye. This is a statistically significant difference favoring drug treatment. The signs of anterior ocular inflammation were greater in the eyes with ACME. This study suggests prophylactic treatment of ACME may be possible without the risks of concurrent corticosteroid toxicity. In addition, a higher incidence of ACME in black patients (22%) is observed in this study than has been recognized previously.\r"

The authors measured serum testosterone, estradiol, DHEA-S, and sex hormone binding globulin levels in 26 men and 22 women with type I diabetes from the Wisconsin Epidemiologic Study of Diabetic Retinopathy (WESDR), a population-based study of diabetic complications. The mean age was 23 years and the mean duration of diabetes was 14 years. Subjects with proliferative or preproliferative retinopathy (greater than or equal to retinopathy level 51-80) were matched by duration of diabetes (+/- 2 years) and sex to subjects with minimal or no retinopathy (less than or equal to retinopathy level 21). Seven stereoscopic retinal photographs of each eye were obtained and photographs were read by the University of Wisconsin Reading Center. Serum testosterone concentrations were significantly higher in male diabetic subjects with proliferative retinopathy (648 +/- 36 ng/dl) than in male diabetic subjects with minimal or no retinopathy (512 +/- 43 ng/dl) (P = 0.017). No other statistically significant differences in sex hormones between subjects with and without proliferative retinopathy were observed. Although these results should be regarded as preliminary because of the small number of subjects, they support the hypothesis that testosterone concentrations may be associated with the development of retinopathy in type I diabetic patients.\r"

Uveitis was the most common ocular manifestation seen. All patients had positive results from FTA-ABS tests, whereas only 68% had reactive serum VDRLs. Two of five patients tested for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody were reactive. The authors recommend routine FTA-ABS and VDRL screening in patients with uveitis or unexplained ocular inflammation. They also recommend testing for HIV antibody in luetics and aggressive treatment with high-dose aqueous penicillin for syphilis.\r"

Five patients had mucocutaneous lesions typical of secondary syphilis. All five patients treated with antibiotics had prompt improvement in visual function and resolution of the fundus lesions. The ophthalmoscopic and angiographic appearance of these posterior fundus lesions was sufficiently characteristic to suggest a diagnosis of secondary syphilis. Modification of the host response to syphilis by human immune deficiency virus (HIV) infection may be partly responsible for this peculiar fundus picture.

The authors studied the progression of onchocercal chorioretinitis in 57 patients from 1 to 3 years. Changes were documented from detailed ocular examinations, fundus photographs, and fluorescein angiograms, and included live intraretinal microfilariae, intraretinal hemorrhages, cotton-wool opacities, intraretinal pigment, white and shiny intraretinal deposits, retinal pigment epithelial window defects, and atrophy. Depigmentation at the edge of chorioretinal scarring progressed at a rate of up to 200 microns per year. Ivermectin or mebendazole treatment did not appear to alter the progress of depigmentation at the edge of chorioretinal scars. These observations suggest that onchocercal chorioretinitis is associated with early changes in the retina and retinal pigment epithelium, and that disease in the posterior segment may progress rapidly.\r"

The anatomy of the normal and the anophthalmic orbits was compared. Computed tomographic scans were made either in the sagittal and the coronal plane or in the sagittal and transverse plane. The authors discovered a sagging and retraction of the superior muscle complex and a downward and forward redistribution of orbital fat. Finally, an upward displacement of the distal end together with a retraction of the inferior rectus muscle was found. These phenomena were measured and appear to cause a rotatory displacement of orbital contents from superior to posterior and from posterior to inferior which is best demonstrated in the sagittal plane. This redistribution of orbital contents can explain the sequelae of the anophthalmic orbit. No signs of orbital fat atrophy could be demonstrated. With this knowledge, the proper treatment of patients with a postenucleation socket syndrome is ascertained.\r"

While the authors advocate orbital decompression for dysthyroid optic neuropathy, advancement of the lateral orbital wall can easily be performed as an adjunct to the two- or three-wall decompression procedure. Advancement appears to increase the overall decompressive effect by providing a potential space where lateral expansion can occur and by enlarging the bony orbital volume.

  ".U": "91057069\r", 
  ".W": "Using data from the National Center for Health Statistics and the World Health Organization, child injury death rates in the US were compared to those of Canada, England and Wales, France, Netherlands, and Norway. Except for the 1981 Canadian figure, overall US childhood injury mortality was greater than childhood injury mortality rates of all countries studied during each year from 1980 to 1986. Injury mortality steadily declined in most other countries, whereas the US rate appears to be increasing. Attention to specific causes reveals that much of the difference is explained by motor vehicle injuries and homicide, but in every childhood age group US death rates due to drowning, firearms, homicide, poisoning, and fire are among the highest. Excess US injury mortality is largely attributable to deaths among children younger than 5 and older than 14 years of age, the most vulnerable groups in all countries. Especially high rates among US minorities account for little of the observed differences; for many injuries, the mortality rate of US nonblacks is several times those reported by the comparison nations. Behavioral strategies are inadequate to deal with excess death rates of this magnitude. Limiting exposure through regulation of handguns, greater use of public transportation, and affordable and accessible day care are among the measures that should be implemented.\r"

International comparison is made difficult by statistical bias, but although excess injury mortality is decreasing in France, rates are higher than in most advanced European countries. Many regulations have been enacted during the past 30 years to reduce the economic and social burden of injuries, but political will is insufficient to establish a consolidated national program and enforcement of existing legislation is inadequate. Evaluation of preventive and educational programs is less than optimal; many attempts have not met basic methodologic requirements. The situation is improving, partly because of growing social concern. New regulations are in preparation, but solution of this major public health problem also demands behavioral change, which is much more difficult to effect than other measures. Greater commitment to research, proper evaluation of sound programs, and enforcement of existing law doubtless would reduce the excess morbidity and mortality resulting from unintended injuries to children.\r"

  ".W": "In this paper we present the leading causes of fatal childhood injury in the United States. We examine three types of explanations for why injury rates are so high in the United States compared with what they could be and actually are in a number of industrialized European countries. Our conclusions are based on what we learn when we look at specific injury problems and apply that knowledge to the field of childhood-injury prevention as a whole. To decrease the number of fatal injuries to children, we should: 1. Recognize injuries as a major public health problem. Injuries have been perceived not as problems to be solved but as \"accidents\" which are determined by fate, not understandable, and consequently not preventable. In addition, injuries have not been addressed in the multidisciplinary fashion that typifies the successful public health approach to other problems. 2. Address intentional injury as part of the problem. Intentional injury has been treated as a separate field entirely and not addressed scientifically as a public health problem. One consequence of this is that injuries due to firearms have been addressed most frequently as a problem of \"unintentional injury.\" As a result, 93% of all firearm injuries, ie, those which are intentional, have not been studied or addressed adequately. This situation is like studying motor vehicle injuries but excluding drunk driving and speeding as contributing factors, or like studying acquired immunodeficiency syndrome but ignoring anal intercourse or intravenous drug use. 3. Develop and support organizations that can plan and coordinate effectively a national approach to injury control.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "91057073\r", 
  ".W": "The international standing of the United States in postneonatal mortality has deteriorated from third in 1950 to sixteenth in 1986. The high rate among United States blacks is not the reason for the poor United States standing: ten other countries had lower rates than that for United States whites. Recent trends show a slowdown in the decline in postneonatal mortality between 1970 to 1981 and 1981 to 1986 in Canada, England and Wales, Netherlands, and the United States. Norway actually experienced increases during the latter period. Only France showed an acceleration in its decline during the 1980s. Canada has maintained the most rapid rate of decline between 1950 and 1986. Although all countries examined here reported Sudden Infant Death Syndrome as the leading cause of postneonatal deaths, there was twofold variation among the countries in the Sudden Infant Death Syndrome rate. Similarly, congenital anomalies, the second leading cause of death, showed a 50% range in mortality rates. Infections accounted for less than 10% of all postneonatal deaths. A reasonable approach to assessing the magnitude of preventable mortality in the postneonatal period is to use mortality from all causes except congenital anomalies among normal birth weight infants. United States whites had a lower \"preventable\" postneonatal mortality rate than Denmark, England and Wales, and Scotland, but a higher rate than Sweden. United States blacks, on the other hand, had by far the highest rates. Disaggregating the United States rates further into three broad maternal risk groups, there was a doubling of rates with increasing level of maternal risk. About half the postneonatal deaths among normal birth weight infants could be prevented if the entire population experienced the rates of the lowest maternal risk group.\r"

Statistics are presented and interpreted, with discussion on which disorders should be included in assessing the impact of infection on morbidity and mortality. Figures and international rankings change according to the inclusiveness of the definition chosen. There is need for epidemiologic and statistical research to make comparisons of mortality more clear. Morbidity is also important because of high incidence, frequent hospitalization, and a heavy social cost. Policy and services in France that relate to control and treatment of infection are described, as are shortcomings that call for further efforts.\r"

During the same period, mortality among older children has also decreased, with the decline evident in all leading causes. Only among people aged 15 to 19 years have recent trends been less than encouraging, with the number of fatal traffic accidents in particular remaining stable or increasing. Although there is room for continued improvement, the widely held belief that the health status of Norwegian children is good is supported by the trends in mortality.\r"

Graft loss of 10 percent or more occurred in 17 patients (33 percent)--due to infection in 16. Skin-graft loss was a minor problem in patients with less than 20 percent total body surface area (TBSA) burn (Ag: 0 of 6, NB: 1 of 6, RL: 1 of 5). The use of either antimicrobial (Ag or NB) resulted in less graft loss (1 of 14) than RL (4 of 6; p less than 0.05) in the 20 to 40 percent TBSA burn group. Large burns (greater than 40 percent) had a very high incidence of at least 10 percent graft loss (67 percent) regardless of treatment. Infection in the area of graft loss was caused by antibiotic-resistant organisms or yeast in 50 percent of the Ringer's lactate group and the entire neomycin plus bacitracin group. No graft infections were caused by resistant organisms or yeast in the silver nitrate group. This study demonstrates that topical antimicrobial agents reduce infection-related skin-graft loss in patients with medium-sized (20 to 40 percent TBSA) burns and that neomycin plus bacitracin is associated with rapid emergence of drug-resistant organisms whereas silver nitrate is not.\r"

We examined three infants with premature metopic synostosis; one infant also had microcephaly trisomy 13 and curious overriding of the coronal sutures. The three-dimensional CT scans demonstrated obliteration of the metopic suture inferiorly. Histologic sections of this suture showed complete bony stenosis. The same pattern was found in all three infants, including the two infants with trigonocephaly who did not have trisomy 13 or microcephaly. In the trisomy 13 infant, the overlapped inferior coronal suture was obliterated on CT examination. However, histologic sections in this region showed a merging of bone; there was no synostosis. In summary, three-dimensional CT re-formation correlated with metopic suture histology. \"Stenotic\" fusion existed in all infants with trigonocephaly, those with normal and abnormal karyotypes, with and without microcephaly. However, three-dimensional CT re-formation of the trisomic infant showed opacification of the coronal suture in the areas of greatest overlap, whereas histology revealed a curious bone remodeling pattern, possibly a precursor to \"deformational\" craniosynostosis.\r"

This study was designed to test our clinical impression that early fronto-orbital (\"frontal bone\") advancement could have an adverse effect on frontal sinus development and consequently on forehead aesthetics. A retrospective study was conducted on 11 patients who had undergone fronto-orbital advancement and also had a long period of follow-up at the Institute of Reconstructive Plastic Surgery at New York University. The longitudinal cephalometric data were compared with unoperated controls. With one exception, no patient who underwent bilateral fronto-orbital advancement developed a frontal sinus, and all such patients had a flattened brow contour when compared with unoperated patients, of whom 82 percent developed at least one frontal sinus. Of the three patients who underwent unilateral fronto-orbital advancement for plagiocephaly (flattened forehead), two developed a frontal sinus but only on the unoperated side and one developed bilateral frontal sinuses. The two patients with unilateral frontal sinus development had a particularly obvious deformity resulting from normal glabellar projection on the unoperated side and a flattened contour on the operated side. Fronto-orbital advancement affects forehead aesthetics and should be performed only in infant patients with moderate to severe deformities. patients with plagiocephaly whose deformity is sufficiently severe to warrant surgery should preferably undergo bilateral fronto-orbital advancement (by the technique described) rather than unilateral advancement in order to avoid the brow asymmetry that results from unilateral frontal sinus development.\r"

Its properties of marked hydrophilicity, a negative surface charge, and extensive porosity combined with a calcium graft coating suggested favorable osteoconductive properties. Four sites of the rabbit craniomaxillofacial skeleton were evaluated by placement of both inlay and onlay implants. Postoperative assessment at 60, 120, and 240 days consisted of histologic evaluation by tetrachrome staining of calcified sections. At 60 days, extensive osseous ingrowth into the inlay implants had occurred extending up to 2000 microns. The onlay implants, however, exhibited more limited ingrowth extending only 100 to 200 microns into the material. Over the ensuing 120- and 240-day postoperative periods, the average depth of bony ingrowth did not progress in either the inlay or onlay specimens over that observed at 60 days. Differences also were noted between the inlayed skeletal sites, with increased marrow at the recipient site resulting in increased bony ingrowth. The material appears to be biocompatible, with no evidence of infection, inflammatory reaction, or bone resorption observed around any of the implants. The implants exhibited a significant osteoconductive capability that was most manifest when implants were exposed to bleeding cortical/marrow surfaces as inlay grafts.\r"

Using 62 beagle puppies as subjects, we tested the hypothesis that raising mucoperiosteal flaps does not interfere with craniofacial growth. We further hypothesized that the size of the area of bone exposed following palatoplasty does affect subsequent craniofacial growth. The animals were divided into four groups: two control groups (unoperated and unrepaired) and two experimental groups. In the first experimental group, two-flap palatoplasty was used to close the surgically induced palatal defect, leaving narrow strips (0 to 2.5 mm) of bone exposed lateral to the flaps. In the second group, one flap was raised to close the defect, leaving a wide area (5 to 6 mm) of palatal bone exposed on one side. Thirty-four direct craniometric measurements were analyzed. Animals that had elevation of both mucoperiosteal flaps with narrow strips of denuded bone on both sides had less severe craniofacial growth aberrations than those in which the defect was left unrepaired or was repaired with one mucoperiosteal flap leaving a wider area of bare bone exposed. These findings suggest that raising mucoperiosteal flaps is less detrimental to craniofacial growth than leaving large areas of exposed palatal bone.\r"

Critical bone support is most often deficient inferomedially. CT analysis of orbital volume in cases where eye position was unsatisfactory reveals that displacement of bone grafts is one mechanism of the unsatisfactory result. Other mechanisms include undercorrection and bone-graft resorption. In order to minimize postoperative bone-graft displacement, titanium implants were used to span large defects in the internal orbit to provide a platform for bone-graft support. Twenty-six implants were placed in immediate and 12 were placed in late orbital reconstructions. More reliable bone-graft position resulted. Two late infections have occurred resulting in implant removal in a 3-year period.\r"

Fifteen adult patients, of whom nine were previously treated with limited success at 577 nm (group A), and six untreated patients (group B) were included in the study. For the group A patients, treatment with 585 nm produced successful clearance of the birthmark. For the six patients in group B, parallel treatment of different sites of the same lesion coupled with skin biopsies and histologic examination revealed that a change in the wavelength from 577 to 585 nm allowed the laser light to penetrate from the midreticular dermis into the subcutaneous fat. This explained the clearance achieved at 585 nm and not at 577 nm.\r"

  ".W": "Breast reconstruction after mastectomy is valuable, yet only a small percentage of eligible patients ever have reconstruction. Little has been done to determine why so few patients proceed with reconstructive surgery. A homogeneous population of mastectomy patients, some of whom underwent breast reconstruction while others did not, were surveyed regarding their attitudes about breast reconstruction. A total of 245 women were surveyed. One-hundred and fifty-eight (64 percent) responded, 71 of whom had been reconstructed while 87 had not. Comparison of the responses of the two groups suggests factors that play a role in determining whether the mastectomy patient will accept or decline the option of breast reconstruction. Considerations that made it less likely that a woman would pursue reconstruction included advanced age at the time of mastectomy, concern about complications from further surgery, uncertainty about outcome, and fear about the effect of reconstruction on future problems with breast cancer. Marital status, receiving chemotherapy, or knowing a patient who had a bad result from reconstruction did not affect the decision. An awareness and understanding of these factors may be helpful to physicians in counseling patients and in increasing the number of women who enjoy the benefits of breast reconstruction.\r"

The present study evaluates lymphocytic response to silicone as expressed by the demonstration of immunologic memory, or changes in specific lymphocyte subpopulations. Thirty-six female Lewis rats (250 gm body weight) were used as test animals. Group 1 (n = 12) was injected subcutaneously with 2.5 ml Freund's Complete Adjuvant (FCA) alone. Group 2 (n = 12) was injected with 2.5 ml FCA sonicated with silicone gel. Group 3 (n = 6) was injected with 2.5 ml FCA, and at 4 weeks, gel-filled silicone implants were placed subcutaneously. Group 4 (n = 6) was injected with 2.5 ml FCA sonicated with silicone gel, and gel-filled silicone implants were placed at 4 weeks. An additional group of six rats (group 5) served as control for the experimental animals, and a group of four rats (group 6) served as naive control. Groups 1 and 2 were sacrificed at 4 weeks, and splenic lymphocytes were obtained for lymphocyte transformation assays performed against silicone. Assays also were run with the addition of the known mitogens Con A, PHA, LPS, and pokeweed. Cytofluorographic analysis of pan-T, T-helper, T-suppressor, and B-cell populations was performed.

In our experience with the lateral arm fasciocutaneous flap, we have found that the fascia alone is an excellent source of tissue for free flap transfer. A thorough investigation of the microscopic, gross, and radiographic anatomy of the lateral arm fascia was undertaken by the study of 25 fresh cadavers. Vascular pathways were mapped, their locations were analyzed, and then they were correlated with the elevation, design, and transfer of the flap. The lateral arm has a large fascial component located anterior and posterior to the lateral intermuscular septum, which itself lies between the triceps and the brachialis and brachioradialis muscles. It is perfused by the posterior radial collateral artery (PRCA), one of the terminal branches of the profunda brachii. This vessel (PRCA) provides at least four fascial branches from 1 to 15 cm proximal to the lateral epicondyle, the largest of which is located an average of 9.7 cm superior to the lateral epicondyle. Fascia up to 12 x 9 cm may be used with good axial perfusion. The histologic cross sections demonstrate the complex anatomy of the fascia itself, as well as its relation to the nutrient vessels. We have applied the lateral arm fascial flap in five cases of upper extremity reconstruction. We have also found this flap valuable in preservation of underlying anatomic detail for total reconstruction of the ear and nose when local tissue and more conventional flaps were not available.\r"

A single low dose of intraoperative steroid is effective in reducing flap edema; previously recommended doses are probably excessive.\r"

Comparisons of blood flow to the deep surfaces of the flaps showed that blood flow to muscle in musculocutaneous flaps increased rapidly during the first 24 hours and then plateaued, while that to subcutaneous tissue plus fascia in fasciocutaneous flaps demonstrated a gradual and steady increase. The most rapid decline in bacterial counts at the undersurface of both flaps occurred within 24 hours, dropping significantly lower within musculocutaneous flaps. In addition to such surface properties of muscle as tissue ingrowth, rapid early augmentation of muscle blood flow may be largely responsible for superior bacterial suppression observed beneath musculocutaneous flaps.\r"

The results indicated that the survival length of the skin flaps was 4.5 +/- 0.2 cm in the control group and 6.8 +/- 0.3 cm in the OKY-046-treated group, hence exceeding the control value by more than 50 percent, which was statistically significant. A laser speckle flow-meter showed that the OKY-046-treated flaps had significantly greater blood flow as compared with the control group both at 1 and 48 hours after operation. Whereas the blood flow values were significantly lower at 48 hours than at 1 hour after operation in the control group, no such reduction was noted in the OKY-046-treated group. On the other hand, while plasma TXB2 was found elevated at 1 hour postoperatively in the control group, such a response to the surgical intervention was blocked and the plasma TXB2/6-keto prostaglandin (PG) F1a ratio was decreased in the OKY-046-treated group. These results clearly indicated that OKY-046 suppressed a plasma thromboxane elevation induced by surgery, it augmented the flap blood flow, and it thereby increased flap survival length, suggesting that the drug might be helpful clinically and that further investigation must be carried out concerning its application.\r"

After resection of the lymphedematous mass, U-shaped flaps were made from the suprapubic region anteriorly and the posterior scrotal skin posteriorly. The denuded penis was transposed to its original place by passing it through a buttonhole incision made on the anterior flap. The testicles were placed and fixed in pouches prepared between the anterior and posterior flaps. The patient had an acceptable postoperative outcome both in testicular function and habitual sexual activities.\r"

In order to expand the territory, a combined tensor fasciae latae musculocutaneous flap and sartorius musculocutaneous flap was devised. This flap was successfully used to resurface a large defect in the lower leg as a distally based musculocutaneous flap. The advantages of this flap are its extremely large territory, the fact that total necrosis of the flap cannot occur, and that as a proximally or distally pedicled flap it is suitable for large defects in the abdominal wall, lower leg, and gluteal region.\r"

The graft is compressed by pressure that is equivalent to the negative pressure of the suction drain. This method can apply uniform and constant pressure on the graft. Moreover, the graft can be observed through a transparent drape so that the existence of hematomas can be detected easily.\r"
