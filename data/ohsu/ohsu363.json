  ".W": "Rational design of novel as well as improved cellular biocatalysts by genetic manipulation of cellular metabolism has recently attracted considerable interest. A wide range of bacteria have been genetically modified by integrating new enzymatic functions into their metabolic network. A central problem in the aerobic growth of any cell culture is the maintenance of dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations above growth-limiting levels especially in high cell-density fermentations which are usually of a fed-batch type. The optimal rate of nutrient addition (and consequently the productivity) is ultimately limited by the rate at which cells can aerobically catabolize the carbon source without generating growth-inhibitory metabolites such as lactate and acetate. All approaches thus far have concentrated on improving the oxygen mass transfer rates by manipulating various environmental parameters. We have isolated the gene for a haemoglobin-like molecule, expressed by the aerobic bacterium Vitreoscilla in poorly-oxygenated environments, and expressed it in Escherichia coli. The recombinant cells contain enhanced haem as well as active haemoglobin, and they grow faster and to considerably greater cell densities than comparable plasmid-containing cells which do not express haemoglobin. This haemoglobin increases the rate of oxygen use, especially when dissolved oxygen is less than 5% of air saturation.\r"

Phenytoin was added to the PB regimen if seizures persisted for 10 minutes after beginning therapy. The cumulative convulsion time (total time spent in active convulsive movements) was shorter for the PB group than for the DZ/DPH group (median, 5 versus 9 minutes, p less than 0.06); the response latency (elapsed time from initiation of therapy to the end of the last convulsion) was also shorter for the PB group (median, 5.5 versus 15 minutes, p less than 0.10). The median cumulative convulsion time is between 0 and 14 minutes shorter for the PB regimen than for the DZ/DPH regimen (95% confidence interval). Similarly, the median response latency for the PB regimen is between 1 minute longer and 20 minutes shorter than that for the DZ/DPH regimen (95% confidence interval). The frequencies of intubation, hypotension, and arrhythmias were similar in the two groups. Eleven of 18 patients in the PB group responded to phenobarbital monotherapy. We conclude that the PB regimen is rapidly effective, comparable in safety, and enjoys certain practical advantages in comparison with the DZ/DPH regimen.\r"

Eight of these ten patients later participated in an open escalating-dose (to 1.75 mg/d) trial of bethanechol. Patients' drug responses were assessed by neuropsychological examination and informant measures of activities of daily living, mood disturbance, and abnormal behavior. Bethanechol appears to have a narrow therapeutic window for positive effects; low doses did not reliably alter patient functioning, moderately increased doses appeared to have a palliative effect on patient mood and behavior, and the highest dose was detrimental to patient functioning. Bethanechol does not appear to ameliorate the dementia of AD, but may exert a mildly positive effect on patient behavior and mood.\r"

After the creation of defects of controlled sizes in the interproximal regions of a dried mandible, subsequent radiographs were taken with the help of an occlusal stent. The radiographs were then digitized, and the images were enhanced by frame summation and averaging to reduce electronic noise. Further standardization was facilitated by the use of a step wedge on each radiograph and a computer program to correct variations in processing and exposure. The results show that defect resolution depended not only on the diameter of the defect but also on the mass of the adjacent bone. The smallest detectable lesion was 0.5 mm in diameter in the interproximal region of the premolars. In addition, a change in depth of 1 mm could be detected at the base of three-walled infrabony defects.\r"

Blood samples were drawn preoperatively, immediately after the extractions, before suture removal, and immediately following removal of the intraoral silk sutures. The samples were cultured in prereduced and aerobic media suitable for quantitative colony counts. Fourteen of 16 patients yielded positive blood cultures following tooth extractions. One of 20 patients yielded a positive blood culture following suture removal. Even though the incidence of bacteremia following intraoral suture removal is relatively low (5%), this study suggests that intraoral suture removal is not a benign procedure for those persons who are considered high-risk cardiac patients.\r"

For surgeons who intend to become involved in its repair or reconstruction, it is mandatory to understand the full range of anatomic, physiologic, and diagnostic considerations prior to embarking upon a surgical course. Proper eyelid function depends upon the integrity of its constituent parts, including the margin, tarsus, muscle, and globe apposition. The lacrimal pump mechanism is produced by proper eyelid function and structure, and must be adequately assessed. The puncta and canaliculi are delicate structures and must be manipulated with care and gentleness. The lacrimal sac is a static structure that serves as a collecting sphere but also may be forced to evacuate its contents into the nasolacrimal duct by the \"squeezing\" action of the investing tendons. Proper tendon position must be maintained after surgery or trauma to facilitate this action. The nasolacrimal sac may be damaged after facial fractures or blocked from intranasal conditions. If the blockage cannot be relieved, it must be bypassed by performing a dacryocystorhinostomy. The use of long-term, indwelling silicone intubation catheters greatly facilitates the successful reconstruction of the lacrimal drainage system. Proper attention to all of these points will be appreciated by the patient.\r"

  ".U": "88123664\r", 
  ".W": "Blunt and penetrating trauma to the orbital region can have a devastating effect both functionally and cosmetically for the orbit. Penetrating injuries to the orbit should be suspected whenever there is a history of trauma to the regions of the eyelids. Meticulous inspection of the eyelids and globe should be undertaken, and if there is any suspicion of a foreign body retained within the orbital soft tissues, then a CT scan should be obtained. It is possible that the foreign body is not opaque, and exploration of the soft tissues may be indicated. Blow-out fractures of the orbit should be explored and repaired when the evidence clearly indicates that a blow-out is present. This includes the clinical presence of diplopia, evidence of muscle entrapment with forced duction testing, and CT scan showing orbital wall fracture with explosion of the orbital contents into the paranasal sinuses. If these signs or symptoms are equivocable, then a waiting period of 10 to 14 days is indicated to rule out the presence of a nerve palsy, which should improve. However, a CT scan showing a large blow-out defect of the orbit should be repaired regardless of the clinical signs at the time because of the late sequelae of enophthalmos and hypophthalmos. It is very difficult to secondarily repair an orbit that is contracted owing to loss of volume from an orbital blow-out fracture. Procedures of this sort involve the reintroduction of autogenous fat into the orbital contents and are very difficult technically. Although orbital fractures should not be routinely explored, each should be viewed with its own merit and an aggressive approach developed if there is clinical evidence of a blow-out fracture.\r"

The management of endocrine orbitopathy continues to be directed toward relief of symptoms. A multidisciplinary approach, involving the endocrinologist, ophthalmologist, otolaryngologist-head and neck surgeon, and oculoplastic surgeon is often required to achieve the best outcome.\r"

Prevalence of GSE in childhood did not substantially decrease in the last 15 years in all European countries, where GSE is still more common in infantile age and presents frequently gastrointestinal symptoms. A decrease has been reported in childhood in several United Kingdom areas and in Finland, where the clinical presentation is changing, shifting upward with age and coming closer to the adult type of the disease. The following clinical problems have been reported in the recent literature: enamel hypoplasia; monosymptomatic short stature; arthritis and other immunologic diseases; association with diabetes, atopy, Iga deficiency, and probably Down's syndrome. Delay in puberty and other peculiar problems of the disease have been described in adolescents. Tests assessing the permeability of the small intestine and the blood levels of antigliadin antibodies have recently gained success as noninvasive tools for the diagnosis of the GSE. The gluten should be withdrawn from the diet and the challenge with gluten should be performed not before 12 months of gluten-free diet with an accurate timing of the biopsy on the basis of the antigliadin and antireticulin antibodies, to avoid clinical and growth damage. Celiac children do require a permanent gluten-free (and not poor) diet. In reality, too many celiac adolescents are off-diet.\r"

During the past decade, from clinical studies and animal models, much has been learned about the pathogenesis of rotavirus diarrhea. These findings provide a sound basis for the use of rational oral fluid therapy, early feeding, and avoidance of drugs during active management.

  ".W": "The presence of rectal or genital infection with Chlamydia trachomatis in children is frequently considered an indicator of sexual abuse. The diagnosis of chlamydial infection in these children has been complicated by the use of antigen detection methods instead of culture. We report five cases in which the use of chlamydial antigen detection tests in the evaluation of suspected child abuse gave false positive results. An enzyme immunoassay was used in two cases (Chlamydiazyme; Abbott Diagnostics) and a direct fluorescent antibody test was used in the remaining three cases (Microtrak; Syva). The sites examined were the urethra, vagina and rectum. In all cases chlamydial cultures obtained several days later with no interim antibiotic therapy were negative. Four of the five children examined were probably victims of sexual abuse. The enzyme immunoassay and direct fluorescent antibody tests have been evaluated primarily for urethral and cervical cultures from adults; neither test has been approved or evaluated for rectal or genital sites in children. At these sites use of both tests may be associated with a large proportion of false positives caused by contamination with fecal flora which can cross-react with the antibodies used in the test. These tests also have limited utility in populations where the prevalence of chlamydial infection is low (less than 10%), as has been reported for sexually abused children. Because of the medicolegal implications only \"gold standard\" methods (i.e. culture) performed by a competent laboratory should be used in evaluating chlamydial infection in sexually abused children.\r"

The dosage of cefaclor was 40 mg/kg/day administered orally in equally divided doses at 12-hour intervals. Tympanocentesis before treatment yielded specimens that contained Streptococcus pneumoniae or Haemophilus influenzae or both in 55% of specimens. Branhamella catarrhalis was isolated from 21% of specimens. Culture of material from the ear canal of patients with spontaneous perforation of the tympanic membrane of less than 24 hours duration yielded pneumococci or H. influenzae or both in 38% of specimens and staphylococci in 31%. Patients were scheduled for follow-up examinations at 5 or 6, 10, 30, 60 and 90 days. Of the 175 children 151 were evaluable at 10 days. There were 123 patients with both tympanic membranes intact at the time of diagnosis. There were 6 (10%) treatment failures of therapy in the 59 patients assigned to 5 days of therapy and 4 (6%) failures and 1 (2%) early relapse in the 64 assigned to 10 days of therapy (difference not significant). There were 28 evaluable patients with spontaneous perforation. There were 8 (53%) failures in the 15 children assigned to 5 days of therapy and only 1 (8%) failure in the 13 children assigned to receive 10 days of therapy (P = 0.016, Fisher exact test). Rates of reinfection and persistent middle ear effusion at 10, 30, 60 and 90 days follow-up were not significant different in patients assigned to 5 to 10 days of therapy. In patients with acute otitis media with intact tympanic membranes we have not been able to show any advantage of the standard duration of 10 days of therapy over a shortened course of 5 days. A 5-day course of antibiotic therapy does not appear to be sufficient for children with acute otitis media and spontaneous purulent drainage.\r"

Despite the preoperative presence of a palpable pyloric mass in 192 (89%) of the patients, 174 (81%) had a diagnostic imaging procedure. Similar high rates of imaging studies were noted when the records of patients with hypertrophic pyloric stenosis from 1980 and 1984 were reviewed at three other institutions. Palpation of a hypertrophied pylorus is diagnostic of hypertrophic pyloric stenosis. Careful physical examination makes diagnostic imaging unnecessary in the majority of infants with symptoms suggesting hypertrophic pyloric stenosis. Diagnostic imaging for suspected hypertrophic pyloric stenosis should be used only for those infants with persistent vomiting in whom careful and repeated physical examinations fail to detect a palpable pyloric mass.\r"

Charts of all children (N = 51) admitted to Cook County Hospital for treatment of lead poisoning in 1981 to 1983 were reviewed for data on age, blood lead level, hemoglobin concentration, MCV, transferrin saturation and zinc protoporphyrin level. The mean lead level was 86 micrograms/dL and the range was 63 to 190 micrograms/dL. Children with transferrin saturation values less than 7% had a mean MCV of 56 microL, hemoglobin of 8.9 g/dL, and zinc protoporphyrin of 693 micrograms/dL; for those with saturations of 7% to 16%, the values were 61 microL, 10.1 g/dL, and 581 micrograms/dL, respectively; the children with saturations greater than 16% had normal mean MCVs and hemoglobin concentrations (74 microL and 11.4 g/dL) and a mean zinc protoporphyrin value of 240 micrograms/dL (P less than .0005). Multiple linear regression was used to correct for effect of age, and transferrin saturation remained the most important predictor of MCV, hemoglobin, and zinc protoporphyrin levels; the addition of lead did not improve the models. Results of this study suggest that iron deficiency is strongly associated with some of the observed toxicities of lead. Also, lead poisoning can exist without producing microcytosis or anemia, and zinc protoporphyrin concentration may not be a sensitive indicator of lead level in the absence of iron deficiency.\r"

Three data sets, derived from parent reports and Medicaid records concerning 281 Medicaid-eligible, young developmentally disabled children from nine representative counties in the state were studied. Approximately 56% of these children had used EPSDT, and 44% had not. Findings from the first data base, a parent questionnaire, indicated no differences between the two groups in terms of age at diagnosis, access to routine or specialized health care, or reasons for inability to obtain needed care. The second database, the screening summaries from the EPSDT sites, contained reports on 108 children. Many of the required procedures were not performed on these children. The final data set, the Medicaid claims records, was used to assess whether appropriate medical follow-up occurred in response to the screening encounter. Only 62% of the screenings with a referral had a Medicaid visit within 1 year of screening and only half of the referrals that resulted in a follow-up visit had a diagnosis that confirmed the reason for referral. Recommendations for improving the health and developmental screening of disabled children are presented and the policy implications of these findings are discussed.\r"

  ".W": "We evaluated the utility of recording neural signals, such as auditory brainstem responses, as potential new criteria for treatment of neonatal jaundice. Findings from recent studies of auditory brainstem responses and behavior of jaundiced infants reinforce the notion that asymptomatic and even symptomatic neurotoxicity caused by bilirubin may occur relatively frequently at relatively low serum bilirubin concentrations. Evidence suggests that this is transient and reversible. Whereas current criteria for the prevention of kernicterus are based on the idea that bilirubin entry to the CNS should be averted, the existence of transient subclinical and clinical bilirubin-induced neurotoxicity suggests that the focus of prevention might be shifted to events beyond the blood-brain barrier. With the use of \"finer tools\" to detect neurotoxicity, it may be possible to recognize a prior stage of neurotoxicity, described here as \"transient subclinical bilirubin-induced neurotoxicity.\" Recordings of neural signals might be used as either predictors of kernicterus or as immediately available \"outcomes\" or end points with which biochemical predictors (serum bilirubin and \"unbound\" bilirubin concentrations) might be correlated, to determine their relative value as predictors of entry of bilirubin to the CNS. It is suggested that the results of studies to determine the relative risks associated with the various predictive criteria, namely, a prospective cohort analysis, may not be available for many years and that randomized controlled trials of new criteria for exchange transfusion are even further removed from reality.\r"

While there is a variable recurrence risk after generalized tonic-clonic and partial seizures, certain types, such as absence seizures, have a high recurrence risk. Studies disagree on whether all patients with a first seizure require treatment, especially considering the side effects that can accompany anticonvulsant drugs. If the diagnosis is uncertain, waiting for a second seizure before starting treatment is usually a good idea. Electroencephalography should be done and, depending on results, followed by electrocardiography, a fasting glucose test, and/or computed tomography. If the diagnosis is certain, computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging is useful in ruling out structural lesions as the cause of the seizure. The dosage of an anticonvulsant drug that is appropriate for the patient can then be determined by slowly increasing the dosage of one drug at a time until the patient becomes seizure-free without clinical toxicity.\r"

This approach is dubbed protein \"footprinting\" in analogy with DNA \"footprinting.\" Protein footprinting was superior to competitive-binding assays and as good as in vitro mAb-selected variant analysis in differentiating among mAbs with various specificities to a given protein. Proteolytic digestion of the antigen prior to mAb binding drastically reduced mAb binding resulting in poor differentiation among mAbs. In contrast, protein footprinting showed that some mAbs retained the ability to immunoprecipitate such fragments. Thus footprinting could be used for localization of mAb epitopes on a protein and proved also to be an effective means of distinguishing among mAb-selected variants differing in single epitopes. Conformational changes caused by heat-denaturation or the binding of anti-antibody to an antigen-antibody complex could also be detected by footprinting.\r"

  ".W": "Although the growth potential of the pancreatic islet beta cells is limited, glucose, cAMP, and certain polypeptide growth factors have been reported by other workers to exert modest stimulatory effects on beta-cell replication. To further assess means through which beta-cell growth can be stimulated, selected oncogene constructs linked to a rat insulin promoter were introduced by means of electroporation into free islet cells prepared from fetal rats and adult hyperglycemic obese (ob/ob) mice. The uptake and expression of the added oncogenes were sufficiently efficient to exert effects on beta-cell physiology in short-term experiments (less than or equal to 4 days). Stimulation of islet cell [3H]thymidine incorporation was observed after transfection with src alone or the combination of myc and ras. The effect observed in the fetal islet cells with src was more pronounced than any effect previously reported. Transfection with the src oncogene resulted in phosphorylation of lipocortin I and was paralleled by an increased immunofluorescence against src-like immunoreactivity in a majority of the electroporated cells. It is concluded that electroporation can induce sufficiently efficient expression of added oncogene constructs to study their effects on cells that are not readily transformable into continuously growing cell lines. Furthermore, the results suggest that beta-cell replication might be manipulated extrinsically by inserting appropriate growth-promoting genes into these cells.\r"

Together, the five cell types examined here had a total of 205 distinguishable NM proteins with 125 of these proteins unique to a single cell type. The remaining NM proteins were shared among cell types to different degrees. Polyclonal antisera, obtained by immunization with total NM proteins as antigens, preferentially stained the nuclear interior and not the exterior IF. These observations suggest that the NM proteins, localized to the interior of the nucleus, vary in a cell-type-specific manner.\r"

When these cells formed a polarized epithelium, the antigen was concentrated at the apical plasma membrane. It was also found intracellularly in vesicles and vacuoles. When HT-29 cells were undifferentiated and unpolarized, the antigen was not expressed significantly at the plasma membrane but was found concentrated in the membranes of intracellular vacuoles. Cells not yet organized into an epithelium may thus synthesize a membrane protein specific for their future apical membranes and store it intracellularly until the polarization process takes place. Intermediary stages of differentiation were occasionally recognized. They are characterized by a small number of cells surrounding an intercellular lumen. These lumina displayed apical membrane features (the presence of the apical antigen, of some microvilli, and of junctional complexes), although the cells were not fully differentiated. The differentiation process in HT-29 cells is apparently similar to that observed during embryonic development of the intestine. Therefore, HT-29 cells represent a useful model system to study epithelial differentiation in vitro.\r"

In mammalian liver, glutamine synthetase is cytosolic and its distribution is restricted to a few hepatocytes around the terminal venules. These cells do not express carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase I. Using immunocytochemistry, we show here that there is little or no zonation of glutamine synthetase in avian liver. Rather, it is broadly distributed to most hepatocytes, much like carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase I in mammalian liver. In situ hybridization with a cloned glutamine synthetase cDNA probe showed the distribution of glutamine synthetase mRNA in both mammalian and avian liver to correspond to the distribution of immunoreactive protein. Neither glutamine synthetase nor carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase I and ornithine transcarbamoylase (EC 2.1.3.3) are strictly zoned in liver of the Texas tortoise or of an Argentine tree frog, both of which possess a complete urea cycle but which may also rely on glutamine synthetase for ammonia detoxication. These latter results suggest that the mutually exclusive expression of either carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase I or glutamine synthetase may be unique to mammalian liver.\r"

Wild-type centromere DNA from chromosome III (CEN3) exhibits a nuclease-resistant chromatin structure 220-250 base pairs long, centered around the conserved centromere DNA element (CDE) III. A point mutation in CDE III that changes a central cytidine to a thymidine and completely disrupts centromere function has lost the chromatin conformation typically associated with the wild-type centromere. A second conserved DNA element, CDE I, is spatially separated from CDE III by 78-86 A + T-rich base pairs, which is termed CDE II. The sequence and spatial requirements for CDE II are less stringent; alterations in CDE II length and sequence can be tolerated to a limited extent. Nuclease-resistant cores are altered in dimension in two CDE II CEN3 mutations. Two CDE I deletion mutations that retain partial centromere function also show nuclease-resistant regions of reduced size and intensity. The results from a number of such altered centromeres indicate a correlation between the presence of a protected core and centromere function.\r"

These results suggested that CMT and tissue-culture-derived trypomastigotes (TCT), which also activate the alternative pathway poorly, might produce a molecule capable of interfering with factor B binding to C3b. We now demonstrate that CMT and TCT lysates, as well as molecules spontaneously shed from CMT and TCT but not Epi, accelerate decay of 125I-labeled factor Bb from the alternative-pathway C3 convertase (C3bBb) assembled on zymosan or Epi and also accelerate decay of the classical-pathway C3 convertase (C4b2a) on sheep erythrocytes. Parasites metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine spontaneously shed a limited number of radioactive components ranging in molecular mass from 86 to 155 kDa for trypomastigotes and 25 to 80 kDa for Epi. Decay-accelerating activity within supernatants is inactivated by papain and is coeluted with 35S-containing polypeptides on FPLC anion-exchange chromatography, suggesting that the active constituents are protein molecules. Molecules with decay-accelerating activity may explain the developmentally regulated resistance to complement-mediated lysis in infective and vertebrate stages of the T. cruzi life cycle.\r"

Previous studies showing that a chemotactic response can be observed for the mutant raised questions about the role of methylation in the bacterial memory. To clarify the role of methylation, the redistribution of bacteria in stabilized defined gradients of aspartic acid was monitored by light scattering. There was no redistribution of the mutant cells in nonsaturating gradients of aspartic acid, but over the same range these mutant bacteria were observed to respond and to adapt during tethering experiments. In large saturating gradients of aspartate, slight movement of the mutant up the gradient was observed. These results show that dynamic receptor methylation is required for the chemotactic response to gentle gradients of aspartic acid and that methylation resets to zero and is part of the normal wild-type memory. There are certain gradients, however, in which the methylation-deficient mutants show chemotactic ability, thus explaining the apparent anomaly.\r"

  ".W": "We studied the effects of a zinc-inducible metallothionein-ras fusion gene (MTrasT24) in cultured rat liver epithelial (RLE) cells on expression of two genes induced during liver carcinogenesis in vivo: gamma-glutamyltransferase [(5-glutamyl)-peptide:amino acid 5-glutamyltransferase, EC 2.3.2.2] and glutathione S-transferase-P (RX:glutathione R-transferase, EC 2.5.1.18). Expression of MTrasT24 increased steady-state RNA levels of gamma-glutamyltransferase and glutathione transferase-P 6- to 100-fold and 1.6- to 6-fold, respectively; in contrast, levels of alpha-tubulin RNA fell slightly or were unchanged. RNA gel blots verified that gamma-glutamyltransferase and glutathione transferase-P RNAs were of the appropriate size, and results from immunocytochemistry on transfected cells demonstrated that RLE cells carrying MTrasT24 synthesized immunoreactive, appropriately localized gamma-glutamyltransferase and glutathione transferase-P. Zinc induction studies indicated that gamma-glutamyltransferase and glutathione transferase-P RNA levels were directly dependent on MTrasT24 RNA levels. These data suggest that expression of gamma-glutamyltransferase and glutathione transferase-P expression are part of a reorientation of cellular gene expression during carcinogenesis and that activated ras expression, like chemical carcinogens, can bring about this change.\r"

The wild-type agglutinin is polydisperse, due to variable degrees of glycosylation, and migrates on native gels with an apparent mass of greater than 400 kDa, whereas under denaturing conditions it appears somewhat smaller. The mnn1 agglutinin is also heterogeneous but has a lower molecular mass due to the presence of shorter N- and O-linked polymannose chains. Both agglutinins are converted sequentially by proteolysis to active fragments of approximately equal to 150 and 60 kDa, but the rate of proteolysis of the more highly glycosylated wild-type agglutinin is much slower than that of the mnn1 agglutinin. The 60-kDa fragment was isolated by HPLC and found to contain 46% carbohydrate as mannose, all of which was linked to serine and threonine. Thus, the N-linked oligosaccharides are restricted to that part of the agglutinin molecule that presumably anchors the agglutinin in the cell wall.\r"

To investigate whether a similar transport process exists in other tissues with high transmembrane fatty acid fluxes, initial rates (Vo) of [3H]oleate uptake into isolated rat adipocytes were studied as a function of the concentration of unbound [3H]oleate in the medium. Vo reached a maximum as the concentration of unbound oleate was increased (Km = 0.30 +/- 0.03 microM; Vmax = 2470 +/- 90 pmol/min per 5 X 10(4) adipocytes) and was significantly inhibited both by phloretin and by prior incubation of the cells with Pronase. A rabbit antibody to the rat liver plasma membrane fatty acid binding protein inhibited adipocyte fatty acid uptake by up to 63% in dose-dependent fashion. Inhibition was noncompetitive; at an immunoglobulin concentration of 250 micrograms/ml Vmax was reduced from 2480 +/- 160 to 1870 +/- 80 pmol/min per 5 X 10(4) adipocytes, with no change in Km. A basic (pI approximately equal to 9.1) 40-kDa adipocyte plasma membrane fatty acid binding protein, isolated from crude adipocyte plasma membrane fractions, reacted strongly in both agar gel diffusion and electrophoretic blots with the antibody raised against the corresponding hepatic plasma membrane protein. These data indicate that the uptake of oleate by rat adipocytes is mediated by a 40-kDa plasma membrane fatty acid binding protein closely related to that in liver and gut.\r"

The 56-kDa species has been purified independently of the colinear 63-kDa species. Like a mixture of the two proteins, the 56-kDa protein binds single-stranded DNA in the presence of dTTP, catalyzes DNA-dependent hydrolysis of dTTP, and has helicase activity. In contrast to the mixture, the 56-kDa protein cannot catalyze template-dependent RNA primer synthesis. In the absence of a DNA template, both the 56-kDa protein and the mixture of the two species synthesize low levels of diribonucleotide. A putative \"zinc finger\" present near the amino terminus of the 63-kDa protein but absent from the 56-kDa protein may play a major role in the recognition of primase sites in the template.\r"

  ".U": "88124849\r", 
  ".W": "Disulfide bonds are thought to serve a stabilizing role in extracellular globular proteins, but little is known about the modes of stabilization or their mechanisms. Thermodynamic data presented here demonstrate that an engineered 3-97 disulfide bond previously shown to stabilize T4 lysozyme in vitro against irreversible thermal inactivation also stabilizes the molecule against reversible thermal unfolding. In this paper, we explore the relationship between the disulfide's thermodynamic contribution to protein folding and its role in providing resistance to irreversible thermal inactivation. In T4 lysozyme (C54V/C97S), a non-crosslinked mutant lacking the two cysteines found in the wild type, sensitivity toward irreversible thermal inactivation increases dramatically at temperatures above the melting temperature of the molecule. In addition, most of the lost activity can be restored by denaturation/renaturation with guanidine hydrochloride. In contrast, the crosslinked mutant T4 lysozyme (13C-97C/C54V) inactivates relatively slowly, even above its melting temperature, and the lost activity is not restored by denaturation/renaturation. These observations suggest that the predominant inactivation pathways for non-crosslinked T4 lysozymes are conformation related, while those for the crosslinked variant are insensitive to the conformational route and thus are susceptible only to slower processes of a chemical nature. We also show that multiple mutants, constructed to contain the 3-97 disulfide plus a temperature-sensitive lesion, are more stable than the wild type to irreversible inactivation even though they are less stable to reversible thermal unfolding. These findings together suggest that the 3-97 disulfide provides stability to irreversible inactivation primarily via a pathway that is independent of its thermodynamic contribution. The 3-97 disulfide may stabilize T4 lysozyme by restricting the unfolded state to a class of more compact structures with less exposed hydrophobic surface, compared to the unfolded states of non-crosslinked T4 lysozymes. The results have implications both for the use of the stabilizing potential of disulfide bonds in protein engineering and for their roles in protein function and evolution.\r"

(ii) U4, U5, and U6 snRNPs bind, apparently simultaneously. (iii) U4 snRNP is released to generate a spliceosome that contains U2, U5, and U6 snRNPs together with the RNA intermediates in splicing. U1 snRNP was not detected in association with any of these complexes. A parallel analysis of the spliceosome found with an adenovirus precursor mRNA substrate yielded an identical snRNP composition with one additional, unidentified RNA species, called X.

The two cytoskeletal proteins were observed to localize in dot structures that corresponded to the cell-substratum contact sites (focal contact) of the cytoplasmic surface of the plasma membrane. The induction of these cytoskeletal changes was specific for tumor promoters. High-resolution microscopy revealed that calspectin was intensely concentrated in ring-like structures surrounding actin dots. It was also located within the areas of actin dots, but to a lesser extent. Trifluoperazine and other phenothiazine derivatives inhibited the formation of those dot structures that appeared after the addition of PMA. Some serine protease inhibitors were also demonstrated to influence cytoskeletal changes by PMA. Our results provide evidence that calspectin is closely associated with actin filaments in dot structures induced by PMA. Possible mechanisms for these cytoskeletal changes produced by PMA are discussed.\r"

CFU-GM were isolated from cyclophosphamide-treated mice by Ficoll-Hypaque density centrifugation followed by counterflow centrifugal elutriation. The resulting population had a cloning efficiency of 62-99% in cultures containing conditioned medium from pokeweed mitogen-stimulated spleen cells and 55-86% in the presence of a plateau concentration of purified recombinant murine GM-CSF. Equilibrium binding studies with 125I-labeled GM-CSF showed that normal bone marrow cells, casein-induced peritoneal exudate cells, and purified CFU-GM had a single class of high-affinity receptor with an approximate Ka of 10(8)-10(9) M-1. CFU-GM expressed an average of 3783 +/- 4 receptors per cell; normal bone marrow cells, 1518 +/- 242 receptors per cell; and peritoneal exudate cells, 2025 +/- 216 receptors per cell. Affinity crosslinking studies demonstrated that 125I-labeled GM-CSF bound specifically to two species of Mr 180,000 and 70,000 on CFU-GM, normal bone marrow cells, and peritoneal exudate cells. The Mr 70,000 species is thought to be a proteolytic fragment of the intact Mr 180,000 receptor. The present studies indicate that the GM-CSF receptor expressed on CFU-GM and mature myeloid cells are structurally similar. In addition, the number of GM-CSF receptors on CFU-GM is twice the average number of receptors on casein-induced mature myeloid cells, suggesting that receptor number may decrease as CFU-GM mature.\r"

We tested predictions of a model in which these telomeric repeats provide a substrate for the addition of more repeats by a terminal transferase-like mechanism that, in concert with DNA polymerase and primase, effectively counterbalances the loss of DNA due to degradation or incomplete replication. For individual chromosome ends in yeast, the mean length of any given telomere was shown to vary between different clonal populations of the same strain and to be determined by the initial length of that telomere in the single cell giving rise to the clone. This type of variation was independent of the major yeast recombination pathway. The length heterogeneity at each telomeric end increased with additional rounds of cell division or DNA replication. Lengths of individual telomeres within a single clone varied independently of each other. Thus, this clonal variability is distinct from genetic regulation of chromosome length, which acts on all chromosome ends coordinately. These in vivo phenomena suggest that lengthening and shortening activities act on yeast telomeres during each round of replication.\r"

To identify the mechanism of immunity, we used monoclonal antibodies specific for either the CD4 or CD8 molecule to selectively deplete sporozoite-immunized mice of T-cell subsets. Though in vivo depletion of CD4+ T cells did not reduce immunity, depletion of CD8+ T cells abolished protection. Monoclonal antibody treatment did not affect anti-sporozoite antibody levels. Our data indicate that cytotoxic T cells are critical for immunity to large numbers of sporozoites and suggest that vaccine development should be reoriented toward stimulating cellular as well as humoral immunity.\r"

The purified protein, OBF1 (origin binding factor), showed specific binding to ARS120. The 26-base-pair OBF1-protected sequence was sufficient for the recognition and binding of the protein, since the mobility of a DNA fragment containing the synthetic binding site was retarded in agarose gels when incubated with OBF1. By performing competition experiments with a number of different ARSs, we showed that OBF1 binds tightly to some but not all ARSs. Interestingly, OBF1 does not appear to have a discernible affinity for ARS1 or the ARSs associated with mating type loci, HML alpha and HMRa, which are substrates for a DNA-binding activity reported by others. Since OBF1 appears to bind to DNA associated with a number of ARSs, we suggest that this protein may have a function related to ARS activity, perhaps in the initiation of DNA replication at selected ARSs.\r"

Clones of rubisco activase cDNA were isolated immunologically from spinach (Spinacea oleracea L.) and Arabidopsis thaliana libraries. Sequence analysis of the spinach and Arabidopsis cDNAs identified consensus nucleotide binding sites, consistent with an ATP requirement for rubisco activase activity. A derived amino acid sequence common to chloroplast transit peptides was also identified. After synthesis of rubisco activase in vitro, the transit peptide was cleaved and the protein was transported into isolated chloroplasts. Analysis of spinach and Arabidopsis nuclear DNA by hybridization indicated a single rubisco activase gene in each species. Leaves of spinach and Arabidopsis wild type contained a single 1.9-kilobase rubisco activase mRNA. In an Arabidopsis mutant lacking rubisco activase protein, mRNA species of 1.7 and 2.1 kilobases were observed under conditions of high-stringency hybridization with a wild-type cDNA probe. This observation indicates that the lesion in the mutant arises from an error in mRNA processing.\r"

Injections of the sense strand or of an unrelated RNA did not alter the normal increase in activity of the enzyme. These results are in accord with our inability to detect RNA-duplex \"melting\" activity in 1-cell mouse embryos.

We investigated the utility of high-voltage electroporation as a method for genetic transformation of intact bacterial cells by using the enteric pathogen Campylobacter jejuni as a model system. This report demonstrates that the application of high-voltage discharges to bacterial cells permits genetic transformation. Our method involves exposure of a Campylobacter cell suspension to a high-voltage exponential decay discharge (5-13 kV/cm) for a brief period of time (resistance-capacitance time constant = 2.4-26 msec) in the presence of plasmid DNA. Electrical transformation of C. jejuni results in frequencies as high as 1.2 x 10(6) transformants per microgram of DNA. We have investigated the effects of pulse amplitude and duration, cell growth conditions, divalent cations, and DNA concentration on the efficiency of transformation. Transformants of C. jejuni obtained by electroporation contained structurally intact plasmid molecules. In addition, evidence is presented that indicates that C. jejuni possesses DNA restriction and modification systems. The use of electroporation as a method for transforming other bacterial species and guidelines for its implementation are also discussed.\r"

Transformation frequencies of 50 and 1000 transformants per microgram of DNA per 2 x 10(7) spheroplasts were obtained for circular and linear vector DNA, respectively. In the majority of transformants, the vector was integrated at a single chromosomal site, in either single copy or tandem duplication, as determined by Southern hybridization analysis of electrophoretically separated chromosomes and of restriction-endonuclease-cleaved DNA. The predominant form (82%) of vector integration was by nonhomologous recombination; the remainder carried the plasmid at the homologous heat shock gene locus. No evidence for gene conversion or gene replacement was obtained in 28 transformants. Hygromycin B phosphotransferase activity and resistance to hygromycin B were roughly correlated with the copy number of the integrated vector at the homologous location. Transforming DNA was stably maintained during mitosis and meiosis. This transformation procedure and associated vector should permit the cloning of genes by direct complementation in U. maydis.\r"

  ".W": "To gain insight into factors associated with the excessive accumulation of beta-amyloid in the Alzheimer disease (AD) brain, the present studies were initiated to distinguish between a unique primary structure of the AD-specific amyloid precursor mRNA vis a vis other determinants that may affect amyloid levels. Previous molecular cloning experiments focused on amyloid derived from sources other than AD cases. In the present work, we cloned and characterized amyloid cDNA derived directly from AD brain mRNA. Poly(A)+ RNA from AD cortices was used for the preparation of lambda gt11 recombinant cDNA libraries. An insert of 1564 nucleotides was isolated that included the beta-amyloid domain and corresponded to 75% of the coding region and approximately equal to 70% of the 3'-noncoding region of the fetal precursor amyloid cDNA reported by others. On RNA blots, the AD amyloid mRNA consisted of a doublet of 3.2 and 3.4 kilobases. In control and AD cases, the amyloid mRNA levels were nonuniform and were independent of glial-specific mRNA levels. Based on the sequence analysis data, we conclude that a segment of the amyloid gene is expressed in the AD cortex as a high molecular weight precursor mRNA with major coding and 3'-noncoding regions that are identical to the fetal brain gene product.\r"

The presynaptic granule cell and the postsynaptic Purkinje cell were voltage- or current-clamped simultaneously, and the excitatory postsynaptic current induced by the granule cell was examined. The neurons and monosynaptic excitatory connections were identified as in our earlier study. Several pairs of granule and Purkinje cells were stained with Lucifer yellow and propidium iodide, respectively, and their morphology was examined after electrophysiological recording. The monosynaptic excitatory postsynaptic current was suppressed by 1 mM kynurenate, an antagonist for excitatory-amino acid receptors, but was little affected by 0.2 mM DL-2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate, a selective antagonist of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors. Glutamate and aspartate induced inward current in the Purkinje cells. These currents were suppressed by kynurenate at 1 mM. DL-2-Amino-5-phosphonovalerate at 0.2 mM suppressed the inward current induced by 100 microM aspartate but did not affect the inward current induced by 10 microM glutamate. These results are consistent with the idea that glutamate, or a glutamate-like substance, but not aspartate is the transmitter released at the synapse between granule and Purkinje cells and that non-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor channels are functioning in the postsynaptic membrane.\r"

This stimulation reflects an increase in apical membrane Na+ permeability and a stimulation of the basolateral membrane Na,K-exchange pump. Considerable indirect evidence has suggested that the apical natriferic effect of insulin is mediated by activation of protein kinase C. However, no direct information has been available documenting that insulin and protein kinase C indeed share a common pathway in stimulating Na+ transport across frog skin. In the present work, we have studied the interaction of insulin and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), a documented activator of protein kinase C. Preincubation of skins with 1,2-dioctanoylglycerol, another activator of protein kinase C, increases baseline Na+ transport and reduces the subsequent natriferic response to PMA. Preincubation with PMA markedly reduces the subsequent natriferic action of insulin. This effect does not appear to primarily reflect PMA-induced internalization of insulin receptors. The insulin receptors are localized on the basolateral surface of frog skin, but the application of PMA to this surface is much less effective than mucosal treatment in reducing the response to insulin. Preincubation with D-sphingosine, an inhibitor of protein kinase C, also reduces the natriferic action of insulin. The current results provide documentation that insulin and protein kinase C share a common pathway in stimulating Na+ transport across frog skin. The data are consistent with the concept that the natriferic effect of insulin on frog skin is, at least in part, mediated by activation of protein kinase C.\r"

Variant amino acids from R-ras p23 regions 1-30, 52-57, 67-78, 1-30 and 67-78 together, and 112-124 were substituted for the corresponding Ha-ras p21 amino acid regions 1-4, 26-31, 41-52, 1-4 and 41-52 together, and 86-98, respectively. Rat fibroblasts transfected with genes encoding these position-12 valine-substituted chimeric Ha-ras proteins displayed the same properties of morphological transformation and anchorage-independent growth as Ha-ras T24 oncogene-transformed fibroblasts. However, substitution of variant amino acids from the 80 C-terminal residues (amino acids 138-218) of R-ras p23 for the corresponding p21 amino acids (residues 112-189) inactivated the transforming activity of position-12 valine-substituted p21. The converse substitution of Ha-ras p21 C-terminal residues into R-ras p23 did not result in transformation by position-38 valine-substituted p23. These data are discussed in terms of the structure of ras proteins and the nature of interactions determining the specificity of effector function.\r"

In striking contrast to many other anaerobic-specific genes, which require DNA to be negatively supercoiled for expression, we have found that inhibition of DNA gyrase activity enhances expression from the gene (fdhF) encoding the selenopolypeptide of FDHH. Fusions of the 5' flanking region of fdhF and the structural gene of lacZ were used to determine fdhF expression under varying conditions. Chemical inhibitors and a temperature-sensitive mutant allowed in vivo inhibition of gyrase activity. In each case, concomitant with gyrase inhibition there was a substantial increase in the induction of fusion protein synthesis. This enhancement of expression is observed for the intact fdhF gene residing on the chromosome as well as the fusion gene in a multicopy plasmid. Inhibition of gyrase activity will partially overcome the inhibition of fdhF expression due to nitrate but does not allow fusion protein synthesis in the presence of oxygen.\r"

Treatment of HL-60 cells with 5' d(AACGTTGAGGGGCAT) 3', complementary to the initiation codon and the next four codons of c-myc mRNA, inhibited c-myc protein expression in a dose-dependent manner. However, treatment of HL-60 cells with 5' d(TTGGGATAACACTTA) 3', complementary to nucleotides 17-31 of vesicular stomatitis virus matrix protein mRNA, displayed no such effects. These results agree with analogous studies of normal human T lymphocytes [Heikkila, R., Schwab, G., Wickstrom, E., Loke, S. L., Pluznik, D. H., Watt, R. & Neckers, L. M. (1987) Nature (London) 328, 445-449], except that only one-third as much oligomer was needed for a comparable effect. Proliferation of HL-60 cells in culture was inhibited in a sequence-specific, dose-dependent manner by the c-myc-complementary oligomer, but neither the oligomer complementary to vesicular stomatitis virus matrix protein mRNA nor 5' d(CATTTCTTGCTCTCC) 3', complementary to nucleotides 5399-5413 of human immunodeficiency virus tat gene mRNA, inhibited proliferation. It thus appears that antisense oligodeoxynucleotides added to myc-transformed cells via culture medium are capable of eliciting sequence-specific, dose-dependent inhibition of c-myc protein expression and cell proliferation.\r"

This tRNA(Phe) transcript can be specifically aminoacylated by yeast phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase and has a Km only 4-fold higher than that of the native yeast tRNA(Phe). The Km is independent of Mg2+ concentration, whereas the Vmax is very dependent on Mg2+ concentration. Comparison of the melting profiles of the native and the unmodified tRNA(Phe) at different Mg2+ concentrations suggests that the unmodified tRNA(Phe) has a less stable tertiary structure. Using one additional DNA oligomer, a mutant plasmid was constructed having a guanosine to thymidine change at position 20 in the tRNA gene. A decrease in Vmax/Km by a factor of 14 for aminoacylation of the mutant tRNA(Phe) transcript is observed.\r"

CD2+ hybridomas produce interleukin 2 in response to combinations of anti-CD2 mAbs 9.6 and 9-1 and, in the presence of mAb 9-1, to sheep erythrocytes or to the LFA-3 antigen. Furthermore, hybridomas expressing a mutant CD2 molecule that has lost mAb 9.6 binding do not exhibit the enhanced response to antigen or the ability to respond to LFA-3 plus mAb 9-1, but these hybridomas retain the ability to respond to combinations of anti-CD2 mAbs.

The deletion of 23 amino-terminal or carboxyl-terminal amino acids or the insertion of 5 amino acids at position 143 substantially decreases the polymerizing activity of the HIV reverse transcriptase made in E. coli.

Our results demonstrate that beta-amyloid mRNA is produced by neurons in the nucleus basalis of Meynert and cerebral cortex and that nucleus basalis perikarya from Alzheimer patients consistently hybridize more beta-amyloid probe than those from controls. These observations support the hypothesis that increased expression of the beta-amyloid gene plays an important role in the deposition of amyloid in the brains of patients with Alzheimer disease.\r"

Intact Gal-Gal pili, CNBr-II, and synthetic peptides R5-12 and R65-75 engendered antibodies that bound the homologous pilin protein and prevented urine and renal colonization in most vaccine recipients. Protection correlated with serum anti-pilus IgG ELISA titers greater than or equal to 1:250. The efficacy afforded by synthetic peptides R5-12 and R65-75 in vaccinated mice indicates that linear \"antigenic\" determinants in separate cyanogen bromide fragments encode \"protective\" epitopes. Peptides R93-104, R103-116, and R131-143 lacked efficacy, indicating that not all regions of the sequence are serologically equivalent. The crossreactivity of the peptide antisera for different Gal-Gal pilins was also assessed and correlated with the sequence homology of the corresponding regions. Antiserum to peptide R65-75, which corresponds to a region of unconserved sequence in heterologous pilins, bound only the homologous pilin. Thus, it specifies a type-specific protective epitope. Antiserum to synthetic peptide R5-12, which corresponds to a region of conserved sequence, bound Gal-Gal pilins from seven of eight pyelonephritis strains, indicating that it specifies a crossreacting protective epitope.\r"

Amyloid-beta-protein mRNA appears to be expressed in all hippocampal neurons, but at different levels of abundance. In the central nervous system of monkey and normal aged human, image analysis shows that neurons of the dentate gyrus and cornu Ammonis fields contain a 2.5-times-greater hybridization signal than is present in neurons of the subiculum and entorhinal cortex. In contrast, in the Alzheimer disease hippocampal formation, the levels of amyloid-beta-protein mRNA in the cornu Ammonis field 3 and parasubiculum are equivalent. These findings suggest that within certain neuronal subpopulations cell type-specific regulation of amyloid-beta-protein gene expression may be altered in Alzheimer disease.\r"

All antisense RNAs inhibited the appearance of functional receptors in the oocyte's surface membrane for at least 1 week. This inhibition was specific because the antisense RNAs did not block the expression of the Cl- channels, also encoded by Torpedo electroplaque mRNA. Experiments with incomplete antisense RNAs and a synthetic oligonucleotide indicate that covering the ribosome binding site or the initiation codon in the mRNA is not a necessary requirement for efficient blocking. Thus, the use of antisense RNAs combined with the Xenopus oocyte system provides a novel approach to screen cDNA libraries for the genes coding for multisubunit neurotransmitter receptors.\r"

MK-801 caused a progressive, long-lasting blockade of current induced by N-methyl-D-aspartate (N-Me-D-Asp). However, during the time that N-Me-D-Asp responses were inhibited, there was no effect on responses to quisqualate or kainate, suggesting that N-Me-D-Asp receptors and kainate/quisqualate receptors open separate populations of ion channels. Binding and unbinding of MK-801 seems to be possible only if the N-Me-D-Asp-operated channel is in the transmitter-activated state: MK-801 was effective only when applied simultaneously with N-Me-D-Asp, and recovery from MK-801 blockade was speeded by continuous exposure to N-Me-D-Asp [time constant (tau) approximately equal to 90 min at -70 to -80 mV]. Recovery from block during continuous application of N-Me-D-Asp was strongly voltage dependent, being faster at positive potentials (tau approximately equal to 2 min at +30 mV). Mg2+, which is thought to block the N-Me-D-Asp-activated ion channel, inhibited blockade by MK-801 at negative membrane potentials. In single-channel recordings from outside-out patches. MK-801 greatly reduced the channel activity elicited by application of N-Me-D-Asp but did not significantly alter the predominant unitary conductance. Consistent with an open-channel blocking mechanism, the mean channel open time was reduced by MK-801 in a dose-dependent manner.\r"

The ability of trp repressor to retard the electrophoretic mobility of an operator DNA fragment depends on the pH of the gel system. Above the pI of the protein, little retardation of DNA is observed, although complex formation can be detected by other assays. As the pH of the gel is lowered, retardation is enhanced. The apparent dissociation constant for the interaction between trp repressor and trpEDCBA operator fragments is 0.5 nM under the conditions used here. Nonspecific binding occurs with only about 200-fold weaker affinity. The stoichiometries of specific and nonspecific complexes were determined directly by using trp repressor labeled in vivo. High-affinity operator binding requires a single dimer of trp repressor. DNase I-protection analysis (\"footprinting\") was used to confirm the dissociation constants and to locate the binding site.\r"

The in vivo hydrogen donor for ribonucleotide reductase is not known.

The inactivated gene was inserted into the E. coli chromosome and mapped to about 18.5 min. A gene replacement technique was used to obtain a strain, A407, that lacked glutaredoxin by radioimmunoassay and by enzymatic assay with ribonucleotide reductase. Glutaredoxin was found not to be essential for viability of E. coli. Thioredoxin is also not essential for viability, as had been shown earlier, but a double mutant lacking glutaredoxin and thioredoxin could not be obtained by P1 transduction on a defined medium, indicating that either thioredoxin or glutaredoxin is essential. In rich medium, very slowly growing, unstable transductants were obtained that at high frequency gave rise to better growing cells. One such isolate, A410, was shown to still lack glutaredoxin and thioredoxin.\r"

Other characteristics of W neg such as muscle trauma or soreness and increased total heat production and cutaneous blood flow, however, may be counter-therapeutic and even hazardous. The purpose of this review is to describe the physiology and therapeutic implications of W neg. Because the body of knowledge with respect to the therapeutic effects of W neg is relatively scant compared with W pos, clinical trials are needed to establish the indications, contraindications, possible limitations, guidelines for prescription, and therapeutic efficacy of W neg.\r"

The specimens were embedded in celloidin and sectioned at 20 microns, and every tenth section was stained with hematoxylin and eosin. A computer reconstruction technique was applied to produce three-dimensional representations of the orbicularis oris muscle. The orbicularis oris muscle in the normal fetal sample with discernible lip fibers (N = 15) increased symmetrically in both fiber density and complexity from 12 to 21 weeks. Metrically, muscle volume and thickness growth curves were consistent with qualitative observations. In contrast, the unilateral cleft lip and palate fetal specimens with discernible lip fibers (N = 3) exhibited a 3.5-week delay in overall muscle development, asymmetrical fiber distribution, and abnormal fiber insertions. However, quantitatively, no significant (p greater than 0.05) differences were noted in orbicularis oris muscle thickness or volume between the normal and cleft lip and palate fetal specimens through 21 weeks. Findings suggest that orbicularis muscle deficiency, noted clinically in cleft lip and palate neonates, may be a result of perinatal functional dysmorphogenesis rather than congenital mesenchymal reduction or deficiency.\r"

Wet bone weights at the time of grafting and at sacrifice in control animals (group I) were compared to three experimental groups. Histologic sections of the developing and resolving pseudosheath and skin envelope were performed. A self-inflating 5-mil-thick silicone expander was used for soft-tissue expansion over the rabbit snout. Bone grafts were subsequently placed in this site. Elliptical snout excision without expansion (group II) demonstrated no statistically significant difference in bone graft survival when compared to controls (group I) (p = 0.350). Full tissue expansion followed by immediate bone grafting (group III) within the pseudosheath cavity likewise demonstrated no statistically significant difference in bone graft survival when compared to controls (group I) (p = 0.500); however, when full tissue expansion was followed by delayed (2 weeks) bone grafting to allow for resolution of the giant cell inflammatory reaction of the pseudosheath (group IV), a statistically significant increased bone graft survival was achieved (p less than 0.001). The study demonstrates that the increased vascularity in the pseudosheath and in the expanded soft-tissue envelope significantly increased bone graft survival only when bone grafting was delayed.\r"

For certain regions such as the joints, the superficial nature of these structures is ideal for the application of localized radiofrequency coils, enabling considerably improved signal, spatial resolution, and detectable contrast. The multiplanar capability is often invaluable in assessing such regions as the weight-bearing surfaces of the hips. It has been shown to be the most sensitive single test for diagnosing avascular necrosis, and has yielded very high resolution images of the internal architecture of the joints and soft tissues in an entirely noninvasive manner and without the need for the administration of exogenous contrast agents. Short TE images are quite useful in evaluating fatty background regions of interest, such as the bone marrow and subcutaneous tissue, whereas long TR and TE studies are frequently more suitable for soft tissue pathology. The lack of ionizing radiation and the continued failure of intensive research to disclose any deleterious effects at the levels used for clinical diagnostic imaging make this tool especially appealing for application to the pediatric population. With the continual development of new pulsing sequences, contrast agents, and further advances in imaging/spectroscopic correlation, magnetic resonance imaging of the musculoskeletal system is ensured of a solid role in the clinical diagnostic evaluation of the pediatric population.\r"

Ultrasound has a proven record of accuracy and safety in addition to its easy access and low cost. MRI has promise, however, in providing crucial information in patients with underlying medical or surgical conditions that would ordinarily require ionizing radiation for evaluation. Currently, MRI is helpful in evaluating gross fetal anomalies and disturbances of fetal growth and development when ultrasound is limited by oligohydramnios or maternal obesity. Further experience is required to determine the value of spectroscopy and quantitative relaxation times regarding fetal metabolism and fetal well-being. Technologic improvements and software updates will reduce imaging time and increase spatial resolution, thus rendering MRI more competitive with existing imaging techniques. The ultimate role, however, that MRI will have in the evaluation of the fetus is currently undefined.\r"

  ".W": "Any child with urinary tract infection needs a radiologic work-up to determine his or her potential risk for sustaining renal damage. VCUG, either fluoroscopic or isotopic, should always be performed. If the infection responds to treatment and the VCUG is normal, ultrasonography should be performed. However, when the VCUG demonstrates reflux, radionuclide scan or, less preferably, excretory urography is indicated to assess renal parenchymal damage and function. When a urinary tract infection does not respond to treatment, ultrasonography or CT scan should be obtained to check for renal or perirenal abscess. If the findings are normal, medical treatment to control the infection is indicated. Further evaluation of the urinary tract may be temporarily delayed. In an infant with urinary tract infection and sepsis, renal ultrasonography is indicated. If the sonogram is normal, VCUG can be delayed until the infant responds to medical treatment. If ultrasonography is abnormal, VCUG and radionuclide scan such as 99mtechnetium DTPA with furosemide to evaluate gross morphology and function should be obtained. Complicated medical problems, such as urinary tract infection in combination with a history of intravenous drug abuse or with findings of fever and a mass, deserve immediate evaluation with ultrasonography or CT scan. A patient with fever of unknown origin and normal urine culture should have a radionuclide scan using gallium67 citrate or indium111-tagged leukocytes, both of which can demonstrate an extrarenal or unsuspected intrarenal site of infection. A variety of imaging modalities are available today for investigating urinary tract infections in the pediatric patient. Used intelligently, singly or in combination, these examinations provide information for the clinical evaluation as well as short-and long-term management of infections, their causes and complication, and their effect on renal function.\r"

This article presents our approach to interventional techniques in children of different ages, specifying our methods of sedation, patient monitoring, and selection or modification of equipment. We present our experience with nonvascular and vascular intervention. In the nonvascular group, we have focused on genitourinary and gastrointestinal procedures, outlining the techniques we have found to be safe and effective. Percutaneous aspiration, drainage, and biopsy can be successfully accomplished in the majority of cases, even in the smallest child. Over this same period, the indications for vascular intervention have dramatically increased. Embolization has become an important asset for treatment of vascular malformations, management of hemorrhage, and medical renal ablation. In our institution, embolization is now the preferred method in many cases previously considered only amenable to surgery. Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and the use of fibrinolytic therapy are considered effective in all age groups, but continue to have limited indications in the pediatric population. It is our hope that this experience will stimulate others to continue development of pediatric interventional techniques, thereby making them more widely available to children of all ages.\r"

  ".W": "\"What is growth anyway? Can one talk about positive growth in childhood, neutral growth in maturity, and negative growth in old age?\" Our goal is to help promote normal positive growth in infants and children. To achieve this, we must be cognizant of the morphologic changes of both normal and abnormal bone formation as they are reflected in the radiographic image of the skeleton. The knowledge of the various causes and the pathophysiologic mechanisms of the disturbances of bone growth and development allows us to recognize the early radiographic manifestations. Endocrine and metabolic disorders affect the whole skeleton, but the early changes are best seen in the distal ends of the femurs, where growth rate is most rapid. In skeletal infections and in some vascular injuries two-or three-phase bone scintigraphy supercedes radiography early in the course of the disease. MRI has proved to be very helpful in the early detection of avascular bone necrosis, osteomyelitis, and tumor. Some benign bone tumors and many bone dysplasias have distinct and diagnostic radiographic findings that may preclude further studies. In constitutional diseases of bone, including chromosomal aberrations, skeletal surveys of the patient and all family members together with biochemical and cytogenetic studies are essential for both diagnosis and genetic counseling. Our role is to perform the least invasive and most informative diagnostic imaging modalities that corroborate the biochemical and histologic findings to establish the definitive diagnosis. Unrecognized, misdiagnosed, or improperly treated disturbance of bone growth can result in permanent deformity usually associated with disability.\r"

However, differentiation of benign from malignant processes has not always been possible. Because early diagnosis may have immense clinical implications, the possibility that endorectal US can be used to diagnose early prostate cancer has been suggested. The authors prospectively evaluated with endorectal US 80 small (less than 1.5 cm) peripherally oriented hypoechoic lesions in 79 patients with a normal or questionably abnormal digital rectal examination. In all patients at least two biopsies per lesion were performed. The transperineal sonographically guided biopsies were performed with both cytologic and core biopsy techniques. Seventeen of the 80 lesions (21.3%) were malignant. These findings suggest a low, but perhaps clinically significant, rate of diagnosis of small prostate cancers. While these data are interesting, they are insufficient to recommend use of endorectal US as a screening tool for prostate cancer.\r"

The most common cause of dementing illness is Alzheimer disease (enlarged cerebrospinal fluid spaces, focal medial temporal lobe abnormal signal intensity, cortical iron). Since the initiation of MR imaging, important questions are being asked about the role of white matter disease (signal hyperintensities) in primary degenerative dementia and the nosology of vascular dementia. Parkinsonian disorders are characterized by generalized brain atrophy and dopaminergic site (e.g., putamen, pars compacta of the substantia nigra) iron or pigmentary accumulation best visualized in disease that responds poorly to dopamine replacement therapy. A key role of imaging in the elderly is the noninvasive exclusion of mass lesion (e.g., hematoma, neoplasm). MR imaging is exquisitely sensitive for the detection of the two common abnormalities that cause focal neurologic deficit in the elderly--infarction and intracerebral hematoma.\r"

MR imaging proved superior to other modalities in demonstrating parenchymal spinal cord injuries and cervical intervertebral disk herniation. Although both T1- and T2-weighted studies appear necessary to evaluate the anatomic relationship of the spinal cord, thecal space, intervertebral disks, and surrounding osseous and ligamentous structures, T2-weighted sequences were more sensitive than T1-weighted studies for detection of spinal cord injury. CT myelography was superior to MR imaging in demonstrating cervical spine fractures. In most cases, myelography revealed no information that was not apparent from both CT and MR imaging studies. Preliminary experience with MR imaging of acute cervical spine trauma suggests that it should be the study of choice in symptomatic patients who are otherwise clinically stable.

Recent research shows that although work effort is affected adversely by the generosity of welfare programs, effects on family structure appear quite weak, most welfare experiences are relatively short, and the majority of women who grew up in homes heavily dependent on welfare do not rely on those programs when they are young adults.\r"

  ".W": "Dengue viruses occur as four antigenically related but distinct serotypes transmitted to humans by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. These viruses generally cause a benign syndrome, dengue fever, in the American and African tropics, and a severe syndrome, dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome (DHF/DSS), in Southeast Asian children. This severe syndrome, which recently has also been identified in children infected with the virus in Puerto Rico, is characterized by increased vascular permeability and abnormal hemostasis. It occurs in infants less than 1 year of age born to dengue-immune mothers and in children 1 year and older who are immune to one serotype of dengue virus and are experiencing infection with a second serotype. Dengue viruses replicate in cells of mononuclear phagocyte lineage, and subneutralizing concentrations of dengue antibody enhance dengue virus infection in these cells. This antibody-dependent enhancement of infection regulates dengue disease in human beings, although disease severity may also be controlled genetically, possibly by permitting and restricting the growth of virus in monocytes. Monoclonal antibodies show heterogeneous distribution of antigenic epitopes on dengue viruses. These epitopes serve to regulate disease: when antibodies to shared antigens partially neutralize heterotypic virus, infection and disease are dampened; enhancing antibodies alone result in heightened disease response. Further knowledge of the structure of dengue genomes should permit rapid advances in understanding the pathogenetic mechanisms of dengue.\r"

The result is hypoinsulinemia, hyperglycemia, ketoacidosis, and death. Diabetes usually begins by the sixth month of age but can occur earlier when young NOD mice are infused with lymphocytes from older NOD donors. When newborn or adult NOD mice were infected with a lymphotropic virus they did not become diabetic. The interaction between viruses and lymphocytes is pivotal in aborting diabetes, as established by experiments in which lymphocytes from virus-infected donors failed to transfer diabetes. In contrast, lymphocytes from age- and sex-matched uninfected donors caused disease. Therefore, viruses and, presumably, their products can be developed to be beneficial and may have potential as a component for treatment of human diseases. Further, these results point to the utility of viruses as probes for dissecting the pathogenesis of a nonviral disease.\r"

Whereas in Europe and in most of the Americas transmission of HIV-1 has occurred predominantly among homosexual men and intravenous drug abusers, in Africa a distinct epidemiologic pattern has emerged that indicates that HIV-1 infection is mainly heterosexually acquired. Heterosexual transmission appears to be increasing in some parts of Latin America and the Caribbean, and possibly in the United States. In addition to HIV-1, at least one other human retrovirus, namely HIV-2, has been implicated as a cause of AIDS in Africa and Europe. Factors that influence heterosexual transmission of HIV-1 include genital ulcerations, early or late stages of HIV-1 infection in the index case, and possibly oral contraception and immune activation. The rate of perinatal transmission is enhanced when the mother's illness is more advanced. AIDS and HIV-1 infection may have a significant impact not only on public health, but also on the demography and socioeconomic conditions of some developing countries. Programs for the prevention and control of AIDS should be an immediate priority in all countries.\r"

  ".W": "Infection with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is frequently complicated in its late stages by the AIDS dementia complex, a neurological syndrome characterized by abnormalities in cognition, motor performance, and behavior. This dementia is due partially or wholly to a direct effect of the virus on the brain rather than to opportunistic infection, but its pathogenesis is not well understood. Productive HIV-1 brain infection is detected only in a subset of patients and is confined largely or exclusively to macrophages, microglia, and derivative multinucleated cells that are formed by virus-induced cell fusion. Absence of cytolytic infection of neurons, oligodentrocytes, and astrocytes has focused attention on the possible role of indirect mechanisms of brain dysfunction related to either virus or cell-coded toxins. Delayed development of the AIDS dementia complex, despite both early exposure of the nervous system to HIV-1 and chronic leptomeningeal infection, indicates that although this virus is \"neurotropic,\" it is relatively nonpathogenic for the brain in the absence of immunosuppression. Within the context of the permissive effect of immunosuppression, genetic changes in HIV-1 may underlie the neuropathological heterogeneity of the AIDS dementia complex and its relatively independent course in relation to the systemic manifestations of AIDS noted in some patients.\r"

This amount is small compared with total U.S. medical spending. The economic impact of AIDS on San Francisco, New York, and some other cities, however, is likely to be more serious.

The monocyte serves as a reservoir for HIV and is relatively refractory to its cytopathic effects. HIV can exist in a latent or chronic form which can be converted to a productive infection by a variety of inductive signals.\r"

The x-ray crystal structures of seven of the mutant lysozymes were determined at high resolution. In each case, replacement of the proline resulted in the formation of an extended alpha-helix. This involves a large conformational change in residues 81 to 83 and smaller shifts that extend 20 angstroms across the protein surface. Unexpectedly, all ten amino acid substitutions marginally reduce protein thermostability. This insensitivity of stability to the amino acid at position 86 is not simply explained by statistical and thermodynamic criteria for helical propensity. The observed conformational changes illustrate a general mechanism by which proteins can tolerate mutations.\r"

The antibody completely abolished nuclear labeling with [3H]thymidine induced by platelet-derived growth factor and bombesin, but not by fibroblast growth factor, epidermal growth factor, insulin, or serum. The findings strongly suggest that PIP2 breakdown is crucial in the elicitation and sustaining of cell proliferation induced by some types of mitogens such as platelet-derived growth factor and bombesin.\r"

Four loops are involved in interactions with bound guanosine diphosphate: one with the phosphates, another with the ribose, and two with the guanine base. Most of the transforming proteins (in vivo and in vitro) have single amino acid substitutions at one of a few key positions in three of these four loops plus one additional loop. The biological functions of the remaining five loops and other exposed regions are at present unknown. However, one loop corresponds to the binding site for a neutralizing monoclonal antibody and another to a putative \"effector region\"; mutations in the latter region do not alter guanine nucleotide binding or guanosine triphosphatase activity but they do reduce the transforming activity of activated proteins. The data provide a structural basis for understanding the known biochemical properties of normal as well as activated ras oncogene proteins and indicate additional regions in the molecule that may possibly participate in other cellular functions.\r"

A chain terminating mutation early in the trs gene resulted in an increase in transcription of viral messenger RNA as measured by nuclear transcription experiments, but only one major species of viral messenger RNA (1.8 kilobases) was detected, and little or no viral structural proteins were made. Thus, the trs gene product is essential for expression of virus structural proteins but, at the same time, may have a negative trans-regulatory role in transcription.

In this study autocrine stimulation of the PDGF receptor was observed in v-sis-transformed normal rat kidney (NRK) cells. In contrast to receptor activation in normal cells, autocrine activation of PDGF receptors in v-sis-transformed cells occurred in intracellular compartments, disrupting receptor processing and diverting receptors and their precursors to a chloroquine-sensitive degradation pathway. These findings show that intracellular activation of receptors by autocrine mechanisms may play a role in cell transformation.\r"

In an acidemic patient, an elevated AG usually indicates the presence of an organic acidosis, rhabdomyolysis, nonketotic hyperglycemic coma, uremia, or certain intoxications. An increased AG with alkalemia suggests severe alkalosis with hemoconcentration or use of anionic antibiotics (eg, carbenicillin) or salts of organic acids (eg, citrate). An elevated AG with a normal serum pH could be an artifact caused by prolonged exposure of the serum sample to air before processing. A decreased AG with a normal serum pH may indicate hypoalbuminemia, cationic paraproteinemia, halide poisoning, or lithium intoxication. The delta AG/delta HCO3 ratio and the urinary AG may also be quite useful in analyzing complex acid-base disorders.\r"

Moreover, normal gastrointestinal activity limits its usefulness in evaluating the abdomen. Labeling leukocytes with Indium-111 oxine is a time-consuming, technically involved process, yet the images obtained at 24 hours will usually reveal sites of inflammation or infection. Although the techniques have similar sensitivities, the higher specificity of In-111 makes it the superior agent for many clinical situations. When there are localizing signs or symptoms or a reason to suspect a specific body region, CT or ultrasonography is the imaging modality of choice. Guided needle aspiration can then be performed and is usually diagnostic. Radionuclide imaging with either Ga-67 or In-111 is available as an adjunct if needle aspiration cannot be performed or is inconclusive. Since it provides total-body surveillance, radionuclide imaging is particularly useful for screening when there are no localizing signs and in cases of occult sepsis or fever of unknown origin. If positive, it can direct further imaging with CT or ultrasound.\r"

  ".W": "In spite of the development of successive generations of more powerful antibiotics, sepsis remains a common cause of death in the surgical patient. This fact is not surprising, since it is of little importance which organism is causing the infection if the patient's intrinsic antibacterial defenses cannot respond. Realization of the limitations of antibiotic therapy has prompted many investigators to study the immune and inflammatory systems with the ultimate goal of improving host defenses and increasing survival. In this article the local and systemic antibacterial defense systems have been reviewed. It is clear that the immunocompromised state is associated with multiple defects of the humoral and cellular components of both the nonspecific host defense system and the specific immune defense system. However, although consensus has not been reached on either the mediators responsible for the immunocompromised state or the prognostic and clinical significance of many of the described defects, work in this field is progressing rapidly. Nonetheless, knowledge that the host's antibacterial defense systems can be aided by good surgical technique, nutrition, appropriate use of antibiotics, and the sterile care of invasive catheters, lines, and tubes is critical in the prevention of fatal infections in the immunocompromised patient. When more information becomes available concerning the complex interrelations between the various cellular and humoral components of the host defense systems and their mediators and the symbiotic relations between man and his bacterial flora, it should be possible to develop specific strategies for the clinician to use to reduce the risk of infection in the high-risk surgical patient. Thus, in the future it may not be unusual for the clinician to alter the immunologic system of the host by the use of immunomodulators or vaccines to increase the host's resistance to infection. On the other hand, by manipulating the complex interrelations between the host and the indigenous bacterial flora, it may be possible to prevent the development of opportunistic infections originating from the gastrointestinal tract.\r"

The only interventions that have been proved to reduce the risk are standardized insertion and maintenance technique by an intravenous-therapy team, preinsertion skin preparation with chlorhexidine gluconate, and the use of topical antibiotics at the insertion site. The goal of the physician should be to prevent catheter infection, because the treatment of established infection can be difficult and costly.

  ".U": "88127486\r", 
  ".W": "The definitive role of catheter drainage in the therapy of abscesses has not yet been totally elucidated. The resolution rate of intra-abdominal infection with catheter drainage is highly variable, depending on the inclusion criteria employed. Certain infections are very effectively treated (i.e., abscesses that are single, not communicating with abdominal viscera, noncancerous, and bacterial) with simple catheter drainage, whereas others (i.e., infected pancreatic tumor phlegmon) prove to be much more resistant to simple catheter drainage. When all intra-abdominal \"abscesses\" are collected, the success of catheter drainage ranges from 47 per cent to 73 per cent. The wide variation should be seen not so much as a reflection of differences in technical ability of the radiologist to introduce a catheter, but rather as emblematic of the highly variable nature of the cause of intra-abdominal infection and the definition of an abscess. Hospitals with a large number of complex problems such as malignancy, transplant and other immunosuppressed patients, and referrals of patients with complex long-standing intra-abdominal infections are likely to have a much lower rate of success with percutaneously placed catheters than are those institutions that derive their series from post-traumatic or primary diseases such as appendiceal or diverticular disease. In the former series, a higher morbidity and mortality rate would be expected from any form of treatment when compared to a series from a practice based on more primary care problems. Intra-abdominal infections are a heterogeneous set of processes, and the role of interventional radiology in the diagnostic and therapeutic approach cannot be underestimated. In planning for the care of a patient with a presumed intra-abdominal infectious process, percutaneous aspiration of a fluid mass is an effective tool for establishing the diagnosis of an abscess. The brief introduction of a catheter has rarely led to contamination of an otherwise sterile collection. However, it often effects dramatic symptomatic relief if the fluid collection is infected. It has therefore been an evolving recommendation to employ the techniques of interventional radiology aggressively in a diagnostic capacity. Subsequently, therapeutic interventions can be undertaken in joint agreement among the physician, surgeon, and radiologist. The diagnosis and treatment of intra-abdominal infections can often times be carried out in a relatively easy and non-morbid manner that effects cure in a significant percentage of patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Prostacyclin (PGI2) has some effects that may be beneficial in the alleviation of hypoxia. We studied 18 anesthetized dogs that were divided into three groups: (1) Six dogs acted as controls and did not receive OA or PGI2, (2) six dogs received OA but no PGI2, and (3) six dogs were first given OA and 1 hour later an infusion of PGI2 (100 ng/kg/min) was started and continued for 4 hours. All dogs were killed at the end of the study and their lungs were removed for weighing and preparation for microscopic examination. Compared with controls, OA caused a low cardiac output, high systemic and pulmonary vascular resistance, and increased right-to-left intrapulmonary shunt. The group that received OA and PGI2 demonstrated a well-maintained cardiac output and a low systemic vascular resistance. Right-to-left intrapulmonary shunt, however, increased in these dogs compared with the dogs not given PGI2. All animals given OA had similar wet/dry lung weights and histologic appearances. Our results suggest that the only beneficial effect of PGI2 in OA-induced lung injury is to improve the stagnant hypoxia, but this is associated with an aggravation of the hypoxic hypoxia. The result of these competing effects appears to be a mild overall improvement in oxygen delivery as suggested by the slightly higher mixed venous PO2 in the group that received PGI2.\r"

Second, an autoradiogram of electrophoresed I125-labeled platelets showed that only beta 2-M but not other I125-labeled membrane proteins could be eluted. Although HLA antigens were poorly labeled by I125 and could not be detected on the autoradiogram, the eluted HLA antigens could be detected by anti-HLA monoclonal antibody and immunoblotting techniques. No loss of plasma membrane integrity was observed by transmission electron microscopy after chloroquine treatment of platelets. The results indicate that chloroquine selectively elutes HLA antigens and their noncovalently associated beta 2-M without affecting other integral platelet membrane proteins.\r"

In 91 of these recipients, a prophylactic parenteral antibiotic (cefoperazone) was administered and closed wound drainage was used. Of these 91 patients, 33 received azathioprine/prednisone immunosuppression, whereas cyclosporine/prednisone with or without azathioprine was used in the remaining 58. The incidence of wound infections was significantly reduced from 12 per cent (4/33) in the azathioprine group to 1.7 per cent (1/58) in the cyclosporine group (p less than 0.01). When conventional immunosuppression (azathioprine/prednisone) is employed in renal transplantation, triple antibiotic prophylaxis that includes an aminoglycoside is most effective in preventing wound infections. A single non-nephrotoxic antibiotic, cefoperazone, offers similar protection in the cyclosporine/prednisone-treated renal transplant recipient.\r"

There are misleading conditions, however, that can cause firm lesions in the testicle.

We encountered five different benign testicular masses within a twelve-month period. We present our findings and comments on some of the difficulties in dealing with these.\r"

Two hundred fifty-four patients were entered and 229 evaluated for compliance of the spatial localization of the prostate through review of the simulation and port films. In 78 per cent this was satisfactory, whereas in 12 per cent it was unsatisfactory, and another 10 per cent were not evaluable. The principle cause of an unsatisfactory rating was failure to adequately cover the prostatic target volume, especially the apex which was found to be variable in location. Routine use of retrograde urethrocystography is urged as part of the localization method in patients to receive definitive external beam radiation therapy for prostate cancer. The role and impact of quality assurance programs for radiotherapy in cooperative clinical study groups is reviewed and discussed.\r"

In two additional patients, rejection was proved by concordant renal transplant biopsy as well as by compatible clinical and laboratory data. In the remaining two patients, in whom no biopsy was done, clinical and laboratory data showed no evidence of rejection. The mean T2 of the seven pancreata undergoing rejection was significantly elevated (86 msec) compared with the mean T2 of the two transplants not undergoing rejection (59 msec) (p less than .002). These preliminary results suggest that MR may be useful in the noninvasive diagnosis of pancreatic rejection.\r"

Pathologic examination of the gallbladder was available in 55 (45%) of the 121 patients; of these, 49 (89%) had abnormal gallbladders. Ninety-three of the 121 patients had one or more radiologic examinations of the gallbladder: 77 had sonograms, 80 had cholangiograms, and 18 had CT scans. Seventy-five (62%) of the 121 patients had abnormal gallbladders on histologic examination or had positive findings on one or more imaging study. By excluding 25 patients who had histologic changes of borderline significance and/or patients who had thick-walled gallbladders attributable to end-stage liver disease, we concluded that 50 (41%) of the 121 patients had intrinsic abnormalities of the gallbladder. Thirty-two (26%) had gallstones, 18 (15%) had probable primary sclerosing cholangitis involving the gallbladder, and five (4%) had benign or malignant neoplasms. Our study indicates that gallbladder abnormalities are common among patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis, and sonography is the most useful technique for evaluating these conditions.\r"

However, because of its high sensitivity and ability to document physiologic abnormalities, scintigraphy has been the procedure of choice. Scintigraphy, however, lacks specificity; its value lies mainly in serving to distinguish torsion from nontorsion. The purpose of this study was to supplement scrotal scintigraphy with sonography to determine if the combination improves diagnosis and management compared with scintigraphy alone. Forty-three scrotal scintigrams and sonograms were performed on 40 consecutive patients with acute scrotal symptoms. The interpretation of the scintigram was altered by sonography in six (14%) of the combined scans, directly affecting clinical management. In three patients with acute hydroceles diagnosed by sonography, exploratory surgery was avoided despite scintigraphic findings suggesting testicular torsion. Scintigraphy was normal in two patients with spontaneous testicular detorsion, whereas sonography showed recent spermatic-cord torsion that required subsequent orchiopexy. In a patient with epididymitis and orchitis, sonography showed a complicating scrotal abscess, which was not apparent on scintigraphy and which required antibiotic treatment. The addition of sonography to the scintigraphic evaluations of children with acute scrotal abnormalities changed the diagnosis and clinical management in 14% of the patients studied.\r"

Sonographic features consistent with diffuse swelling of the ovarian parenchyma and follicular enlargement in the cortical zone were detected in eight patients and were considered highly suggestive for torsion of the ovary. Surgery revealed ovarian torsion in seven of these cases and hemorrhagic ovarian cyst in one case. A cystic or complex ovarian mass was detected by sonography in five additional cases, and ovarian torsion was included in the differential diagnosis. Surgery revealed ovarian torsion in four of these cases and hemorrhagic ovarian cyst in one. A 100% sonographic sensitivity for space-occupying disease of the ovary was obtained with a positive predictive value of 88% for the diagnosis of ovarian torsion. The specificity of the method was 93%. Sonography appears to be an excellent method to evaluate patients with suspected torsion of the ovary.\r"

  ".W": "Balloon pulmonary valvotomy was attempted in eight children with cyanotic congenital heart disease and pulmonic stenosis who were scheduled for a palliative procedure (shunt). In seven patients the balloon could be positioned across the pulmonary anulus, and valvotomy was performed. Five of the patients had tetralogy of Fallot with multiple levels of pulmonary outflow obstruction. For all patients in whom the balloon could be properly positioned the valvotomy was successful, as judged by arterial hemoglobin saturation, which increased from 72% +/- 5% to 83% +/- 5% (p less than .005). Valvotomy was followed by an immediate rise in mean pulmonary artery pressure (12.6 +/- 2.8 to 18.3 +/- 4.8 mm Hg, p less than 0.05) and a decline in hematocrit level at 2 months (54% +/- 5% to 47% +/- 4%, p less than 0.05). There was no mortality or complication from the valvotomy, and the need for a systemic to pulmonary artery shunt was eliminated in six of eight patients. Follow-up has ranged from 0.5 to 2.8 years. This trial indicates that balloon pulmonary valvotomy can be safely performed and is effective palliation in selected patients with cyanotic heart disease that is not suitable for primary repair. The increased pulmonary flow may improve oxygenation and growth of the pulmonary arteries without the need of a systemic to pulmonary artery shunt.\r"

  ".U": "88130626\r", 
  ".W": "Dipyridamole cardiac imaging is a useful alternative technique to exercise stress testing in the evaluation of patients with ischemic heart disease. Intravenous dipyridamole is still in the investigational phase, while oral dipyridamole is widely available. The hemodynamic effects of dipyridamole include an increase in coronary blood flow (due to coronary vasodilation) which is in excess of the increase in myocardial oxygen consumption and cardiac output. The disparity in the increase in coronary blood flow relative to the cardiac output results in an increase in myocardial thallium activity and an increase in the myocardial/background activity ratio. The quality of the thallium images is better or similar to that of exercise thallium images. The optimal dose of intravenous dipyridamole is 0.56 mg/kg, and of the oral dose it is 300 to 400 mg, although higher doses may be necessary in some patients. Analysis of the thallium images has been to a large extent based on visual inspection of the planar images. Delayed images are helpful to establish the nature of the perfusion abnormalities (transient or fixed). The process of redistribution is based on disparate rates of washout from the normal and abnormal zones. The sensitivity and specificity of dipyridamole thallium imaging, whether intravenous or oral, have been shown in a number of studies to be quite adequate and comparable to that achieved during exercise thallium imaging. Dipyridamole two-dimensional echocardiography has also been used in the detection of coronary artery disease; transient (new or worsening of preexisting) wall motion abnormalities have been found to be a specific marker of coronary artery disease. Transmural as well as regional coronary steal phenomena have been postulated as the mechanism for dipyridamole-induced regional wall motion abnormalities. Compared to exercise two-dimensional echocardiography, dipyridamole echocardiography provides high-quality studies and in higher proportions of patients. The results of dipyridamole thallium imaging have also been extremely important in identifying high-risk patients after acute myocardial infarction or patients with peripheral vascular disease undergoing elective vascular surgery; the presence of a dipyridamole-induced perfusion abnormality identifies patients at high risk for future cardiac events. Thus, dipyridamole cardiac imaging is helpful in the diagnosis of coronary artery disease and in risk stratification.\r"

  ".W": "Factors contributing to the development of exercise-induced painful ischemia, such as actions of the central nervous system and catecholamines, have been well identified, but the mechanisms by which nonexercise-related silent episodes of ischemia are provoked are unknown. Possible mechanisms receiving much study in recent years are those having the potential to influence the myocardial oxygen supply-demand relation. Beta-adrenergic receptor stimulations, by increasing myocardial oxygen demand through augmentation of heart rate and contractility (beta 1), may mediate responses that cause ischemia or perpetuate ischemic episodes induced by other means. Other receptors (beta 2) may mediate coronary and peripheral vascular constriction, limiting myocardial oxygen supply and further increasing myocardial oxygen demand. Studies have investigated the effect of beta blockade on ischemic episodes in patients with a variety of clinical forms of coronary heart disease. Beta blockade has been shown to reduce the frequency and duration of silent and painful ischemic episodes in patients with effort angina and rest angina. The data suggest that heart rate and perhaps other changes observed with use of beta blockade play an important role in silent ischemia; heart rate at specific times throughout the day, particularly in the late A.M., and the increase in heart rate seen in conjunction with silent ischemic episodes are all decreased with administration of beta blockade. Results of a recent study focusing only on silent ischemia showed that beta-blocker treatment with metoprolol, compared with placebo, significantly reduced total silent ischemic time (frequency and duration of episodes) in all periods examined.\r"

However, despite a strong theoretical rationale for their use and promising experimental data, these agents have not reduced infarct size in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in the large clinical trials performed to date. Their role as adjunctive therapy in combination with reperfusion needs to be examined. Diltiazem has been demonstrated to reduce angina and reinfarction in the 2-week period after AMI in patients receiving multidrug therapy. Results of the single large trial of a calcium antagonist (verapamil) for secondary prevention after AMI were negative; however, several well-designed studies are currently ongoing.\r"

  ".W": "The benefits of beta blockade in acute and postmyocardial infarction are well documented. More than 50 placebo-controlled trials have been performed, involving more than 40,000 patients with short- or long-term follow-up. In long-term follow-up studies in approximately 20,000 patients, mortality was reduced by 21% and reinfarction by 24%. When high-risk patients were assessed separately, the reduction in mortality after early intervention was significantly greater than in low-risk patients. The trial medication was withdrawn in approximately 24% and 28% of patients in the placebo and beta-blocker groups, respectively, in the major trials. In addition to reduction of mortality and reinfarction rates, benefits have clearly been demonstrated in prevention of arrhythmias and thromboatherosclerotic complications. Significantly more patients had hypotension and bradycardia with beta-blocker treatment than with placebo; no clear-cut difference between the placebo and beta-blocker groups was found for atrioventricular block or congestive heart failure when patients with these conditions were excluded. In the Stockholm Metoprolol Trial, 3 years of metoprolol treatment in about 300 patients after myocardial infarction prolonged both survival and time spent completely asymptomatic, in an optimal functional state, or both. Patients receiving metoprolol spent less time disabled after serious atherosclerotic complications, including bypass surgery. Long-term beta blockade after myocardial infarction reduces mortality and morbidity in 80% of patients by 21% and 24%, respectively, but causes adverse reactions in approximately 10%. With proper selection of patients and the type and dose of beta blocker, survival without atherosclerotic complications or adverse effects can be prolonged.\r"

Frequent ventricular premature complexes and evidence of ischemia either spontaneously or on treadmill are also markers for early morbidity and mortality in patients who are discharged from the hospital after acute myocardial infarction. The degree of left ventricular dysfunction is the strongest predictor of mortality; patients who have both left ventricular dysfunction, frequent premature ventricular beats and evidence of ischemia are at the highest risk of mortality after hospital discharge. It appears likely that all 3 of these risk factors interact and that therapy to reduce morbidity and mortality after myocardial infarction should aim at the amelioration of each of these risk factors. A model for the interaction of these risk factors is proposed and an approach to treatment for patients at high risk of mortality after hospital discharge after myocardial infarction is suggested.\r"

The order of treatments was determined by random allocation and patients, clinicians and research staff were blind to allocation. In patients with deteriorating condition, the treatment period was terminated and outcome measures were obtained. If deterioration occurred during the first period, the patient was crossed over without the code being broken. Seven patients required premature termination of study periods because of increasing symptoms of CHF. All 7 were taking placebo at the time (p = 0.016). Small differences in dyspnea (p = 0.044), walking test score (p = 0.055), clinical assessment of CHF (p = 0.036) and ejection fraction (p = 0.004) favored the digoxin treatment group. Patients with more severe CHF were more likely to benefit from digoxin administration. It was concluded that oral digoxin, in doses titrated to produce a serum level of 1.54 to 2.56 nmol/liter, improved quality of life and functional exercise capacity in some patients with CHF in sinus rhythm.\r"

Entry criteria were a diastolic blood pressure between 90 to 115 mm Hg, forced expiratory volume in 1 second between 40 and 80% of predicted value, increasing by 15% or more after salbutamol inhalation and the need for occasional bronchodilator therapy. Prophylactic medication for asthma was given at a constant dosage for 1 month before the study and throughout the study.

  ".W": "The use of ambulatory blood pressure monitoring has gained popularity because it is not subject to those limitations associated with traditional sphygmomanometry (inaccuracy of blood pressure readings, low number of readings, and failure to represent daytime blood pressure readings). In the present study, we provide evidence that the 24-hour mean blood pressure obtained through intraarterial blood pressure measurements in ambulatory patients provides a more accurate diagnosis (and perhaps a prognosis) of hypertension than that provided by cuff-obtained casual blood pressure measurement. Furthermore, despite a reduction in the amount and in the accuracy of the information obtained, blood pressure data provided by noninvasive blood pressure monitoring are also more accurate diagnostically than cuff-obtained casual blood pressure measurements. In 15 essential hypertensive patients in whom celiprolol, 400 mg once daily, was compared with placebo in a randomized double-blind crossover study, the use of noninvasive 24-hour automatic blood pressure monitoring showed that in responsive patients, celiprolol induced a sustained reduction in systolic and diastolic blood pressure throughout the 24 hours. The blood pressure reduction was also apparent during the night, despite the concomitant occurrence of a slight tachycardia. These findings demonstrate that once-daily administration of celiprolol provides an effective lowering of the 24-hour blood pressure profile. This dosing schedule can therefore be regarded as appropriate for antihypertensive therapy.\r"

At the end of each treatment period, blood pressure, heart rate, renal plasma flow, glomerular filtration rate, plasma renin activity, plasma aldosterone and plasma norepinephrine were measured after administration of saline solution and intravenous metoclopramide. Compared with placebo, celiprolol significantly reduced mean blood pressure, heart rate and plasma norepinephrine. Plasma renin activity showed a tendency toward a reduction during celiprolol treatment, which was not associated with changes in plasma aldosterone. Despite the decrease in mean blood pressure, renal plasma flow did not change, so that renovascular resistances were significantly reduced. Glomerular filtration rate was unchanged and the filtration fraction showed a trend toward a reduction during celiprolol treatment. Percent decrements of renovascular resistances and of mean blood pressure induced by celiprolol tended to correlate with changes in plasma norepinephrine. Metoclopramide did not influence the hemodynamic (systemic and renal) effects of celiprolol nor plasma renin activity and plasma norepinephrine, and it increased aldosterone levels to a similar extent before and after administration of celiprolol.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Patients with ischemic heart disease, alcoholic and peripartum cardiomyopathy were excluded. There were 38 deaths (48%) during the 18-month (mean) follow-up. Patients underwent determination of left ventricular ejection fraction by radionuclide scan, echocardiography, cardiac catheterization and myocardial biopsy. Only left ventricular ejection fraction determined by radionuclide study correlated significantly with time to death in nonsurvivors (r = 0.38, p less than 0.05). Multivariant analysis and Cox multivariate regression analysis revealed that the single consistent determinant of prognosis was radionuclide-determined ejection fraction. It was an excellent predictor of survival to 3 months (p less than 0.0001) and a reasonable predictor of survival to 6 months (p less than 0.05). There was no variable that efficiently predicted survival for any period greater than 6 months. In 15 of 70 patients (21% of the entire group), clinical status and radionuclide ejection fraction improved after assessment but only one of these had an ejection fraction less than or equal to 0.10. No patient with a radionuclide ejection fraction greater than or equal to 0.20 died within 6 months of assessment. For those with ejection fraction between 0.11 and 0.19, survival after cardiac transplantation exceeded that of the natural history of their disease; this suggests that transplantation should be undertaken within 6 to 12 months of assessment. Left ventricular ejection fraction less than or equal to 0.10 predicts an extremely poor prognosis (6-month survival was 17%) and such patients should be transplanted with minimal delay.\r"

However, alterations in pancreatic glucagon secretion have also been associated with alterations in diabetes mellitus. For this reason, pancreatic alpha- and beta-cell responses to glucose load were measured in 25 anorexic patients both before and after treatment. The baseline glucose challenge failed to suppress plasma glucagon levels in the patients. However, in the control subjects and patients after treatment, glucagon levels were suppressed after glucose ingestion. Plasma glucose levels during the baseline challenge were significantly higher than those of the control subjects; however, after treatment glucose responses were nearly normal. Finally, insulin responses at baseline and after treatment were lower in the patients than in control subjects. These results suggest that the impaired glucose tolerance manifested by anorexic patients may be attributable to significant alterations in both pancreatic alpha- and beta-cell secretions and in pancreatic alpha-cell and glucose interrelationships.\r"

Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections of pancreas were evaluated by immunohistochemical techniques (avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex [ABC] method). Twenty-one of 25 malignant primary tumors were reactive, and all 16 metastatic sites expressed the B72.3 antigen. In contrast, all cases of pancreatitis and normal pancreas were either weakly reactive or nonreactive. Ten malignant and two benign pancreatic fine-needle aspirates provided results similar to those seen with fixed tissues. Because MAb B72.3 has selective reactivity for primary and metastatic pancreatic cancer, it may be of value as a diagnostic adjunct in cytologic examination or for radioimmunodetection of regional and/or distant metastases of adenocarcinoma of the pancreas.\r"

In the mucosal lesions of LPLE in GVHD, the major population of infiltrated lymphocytes in the areas of upper lamina propria (Lp), basal cell layer (Bc), and epithelium above the basal cell layer (Ep) were T-cells (Leu-1+, Leu-4+) and expressed the phenotype associated with suppressor/cytotoxic T-cells (Leu-2a+) rather than helper/inducer T-cells (Leu-3a+). Some of the infiltrated lymphocytes in the areas of Lp, Bc, and satellite cell necrosis (SCN) bore interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptor. HLA-DR antigen was expressed on keratinocytes in the LPLE lesions. Immunoelectron micrographs showed various degrees of degeneration of keratinocytes to which Leu-2a+ cells attached, whereas those with accidentally attached Leu-3a+ cells preserved normal structures. These findings suggest that cellular immunity mediated by cytotoxic T-cells may play a major role in the pathogenesis of oral LPLE in GVHD.\r"

Because of the importance of recognition of resistant pneumococci, a state-wide clinical laboratory survey was conducted to determine the accuracy of susceptibility testing for this isolate. Of 111 laboratories completing the survey, only 26 performed the 1-microgram oxacillin disk test as recommended by the National Committee for Laboratory Standards (NCCLS). When laboratories were analyzed according to hospital size, the proficiency in performing the proper susceptibility testing was 55% (6 of 11) for hospitals with more than 400 beds versus 3% (2 of 58) for hospitals with fewer than 100 beds (P less than 0.0001 by Fisher's exact test). This contrasts with reported surveys by the College of American Pathologists (CAP), and reasons for this are explored. Guidelines for laboratory testing of S. pneumoniae are reviewed, and additional study of clinical proficiency with attention to laboratory size is recommended.\r"

A presumptive diagnosis was made by cytochemical stains, alpha-naphthyl acetate esterase, and alpha-naphthyl butyrate esterase. The diagnosis was established by electron microscopic platelet peroxidase studies of the peripheral blood blast cells and supported by flow cytometry and immunoalkaline phosphatase studies. Specific monoclonal antibodies directed against platelet glycoproteins Ib (6D1) and IIb/IIIa (10E5), which have not been described frequently in analyzing leukemia, were used for flow cytometry and direct immunoalkaline phosphatase technique. Cytogenetic studies demonstrated a deletion of the long arm of chromosome 6 with breakpoints at bands q15 and q23, and ring chromosome 6 (p25, q27). The diagnosis of megakaryoblastic leukemia requires accurate cytochemical stains, platelet peroxidase by electron microscopic examination, and studies employing specific monoclonal antibodies directed against platelets and megakaryoblasts. The exact origin of the circulating megakaryoblasts in these cases is not known and needs additional investigation.\r"

During cardiac catheterization, captopril (0.5 to 1.0 mg/kg) was administered by nasogastric tube. For the entire group, mean systemic blood flow, pulmonary blood flow, and the pulmonary-to-systemic blood flow ratio did not change significantly after captopril administration. However, in the seven patients in whom baseline systemic vascular resistance was greater than 20 U/m2, captopril decreased the pulmonary-to-systemic blood flow ratio. In contrast, in the three patients in whom baseline systemic vascular resistance was less than 20 U/m2, captopril increased the pulmonary-to-systemic blood flow ratio. We conclude that captopril acutely decreases the pulmonary-to-systemic blood flow ratio in infants with large left-to-right shunts who have elevated systemic vascular resistance. Renal function must be monitored closely when using captopril.\r"

Four reviewers independently assessed each study, without knowledge of authorship, according to 35 criteria, 14 of which were considered critical for this type of study. Reviewer ratings were summed so that any study could receive a potential score of 140 for all criteria and 56 for the critical criteria. Only one study met more than 75% of all the criteria, whereas four studies met 75% of critical criteria. Two studies found short-course antibiotic therapy significantly less effective than conventional therapy. The remaining 12 had insufficient sample size to warrant the conclusion that the two therapies were equivalent. We conclude that there is insufficient evidence to warrant the use of short-course antibiotic therapy for urinary tract infection in children and that a much larger study, with attention to some of the details described, is warranted.\r"

Fever and local and systemic reactions were monitored. Switching to known acetaminophen was permitted if the patient's temperature was 38.9 degrees C or higher or for moderate pain. Overall, the reaction score of acetaminophen recipients was significantly less than that of placebo recipients. The rates of occurrence of fever and fussiness and the degree of pain at the injection site were significantly reduced by acetaminophen administration. Children who received acetaminophen were less likely to be switched to \"open\" acetaminophen than placebo recipients. It is concluded that prophylactic acetaminophen as given in this study had a moderating effect on fever, pain, and fussiness after diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and pertussis immunization.\r"

A unique method of TAC application was used that consisted of applying the medication to the inner margins of the wound cavity and allowing it to stand for several minutes prior to the application of a TAC-saturated gauze pad to the wound surface. Of 670 sutures placed, 637 (95%) were done without eliciting pain. The TAC topical anesthetic was more than 95% effective in providing complete anesthesia for wounds located on the face and lip; it was equally efficacious in anesthetizing larger wounds (greater than or equal to 5 cm in length and/or greater than or equal to 5 mm in depth). No adverse reactions resulted from the application of TAC. A single wound healing complication occurred in 103 patients. TAC is a safe, effective method for anesthetizing minor lacerations of the skin in children. Its painless method of application relieves patient discomfort and maximizes patient compliance during the repair procedure, both of which enhance the accurate approximation of lacerated tissue.\r"

In this study, radionuclide scanning was compared with ultrasound (US) and serum thyroglobulin (Tg) concentration as a method of determining the cause of CH in 50 newborns. Mean serum Tg values were significantly lower in athyrotic children (7.9 pmol/L) than in either those with goitrous (149.1 pmol/L) or ectopic (60.5 pmol/L) glands, but there was marked overlap among all three groups. With the interpreter \"blinded\" to the radionuclide diagnosis, a cervical gland could be delineated reliably on US. All 12 goiters and five of five normal glands were identified. In contrast, the correlation between US and radionuclide scanning was poor in patients in whom there was no cervical thyroid tissue. Ultrasound failed to identify 13 lingual glands and was reported as normal in four of 12 children with no radionuclide uptake in the neck and biochemical hypothyroidism. Two children with absent thyroid glands on scanning were biochemically euthyroid. The serum of two others who had normal results of radionuclide studies showed persistent hypothyroidism. Thyroid scanning remains the most accurate diagnostic modality to determine the cause of CH. Serum Tg and cervical US have not been established as reliable alternatives.\r"

The advantages of CT over conventional contrast examinations in these conditions include direct visualization of the bowel wall, detection of extramural disease, definition of the type and severity of such disease, visualization of all of the abdominal structures in one examination, and the noninvasive nature of the procedure. The current role of CT in diagnosis and management of these disorders varies. In diverticulitis, we believe CT should be used as the primary method of investigation, as well as for evaluation of complications. If surgical resection is not contemplated, the CT diagnosis should be confirmed by CE. In most cases of appendicitis, the diagnosis is still most accurately made clinically; radiographic evaluation should be reserved for cases with atypical clinical presentations. We advocate the use of CT as the first diagnostic procedure in these patients; if CT does not offer conclusive evidence of the diagnosis, contrast enema can be performed. In Crohn's disease, conventional barium studies remain the examinations of choice for diagnosis; CT should be used to evaluate possible complications and as a guide for proper management. Inflammatory colitides other than Crohn's disease primarily affect the mucosa, and are therefore best evaluated by barium enema; CT offers little additional information in these disorders. In all cases, conventional contrast studies and CT should be considered complimentary rather than exclusive procedures. In difficult cases, both examinations may be needed for complete evaluation.\r"

  ".W": "After a diagnosis of advanced carcinoma, a 77-yr-old female underwent gastrectomy. A 6 X 5 cm ulcerative mass in the angle was shown to be differentiated adenocarcinoma in the surrounding wall, and malignant lymphoma in the bottom. Carcinomatous infiltration was limited to the muscularis mucosae. Neither generalized lymphoma nor locoregional lymph node metastasis of either neoplasm was noted. A survey of 35 Japanese patients, including our own case with the two coexistent neoplasms in the stomach, revealed that the male-to-female ratio was 2.3:1, with no significant difference between the mean age of the sexes. The prevalence of adenocarcinoma in its early stage (60% of 35 patients) and of a histologically differentiated type (85% of 27 patients) of adenocarcinoma is quite different from that of usual Japanese gastric carcinoma, and it may suggest that there are some factors influencing the coexistent development of both neoplasms.\r"

When compared with a control group receiving triple immunosuppression with cyclosporine, azathioprine, and prednisone, the OKT3, azathioprine, and prednisone group had significantly fewer acute rejections during the first month (6% v 50%; P less than 0.01), and the mean time of onset of the first rejection was significantly delayed (day 47 v day 8; P less than 0.01) in the OKT3 prophylaxis group. OKT3 was administered intraoperatively safely and without complications on the day of transplantation. The well-reported first dose reaction to OKT3 was similar in these patients when compared with patients receiving OKT3 for treatment of rejection. Anti-OKT3 antibody development occurred in half of the patients receiving OKT3, and did not prevent the subsequent use of OKT3 in these patients, whose rejections following OKT3 prophylaxis were steroid reversible. There were no deaths among the patients receiving prophylactic OKT3, and during a 15-month follow-up, only three of 34 kidneys were lost for any reason. In addition to its use for primary and steroid-resistant rejection, OKT3 may be useful early after transplantation to prevent rejection.\r"

A febrile first-dose reaction to OKT3 was common; no severe pulmonary complications were encountered. Other toxicities of OKT3 therapy were observed later in the treatment course. Most severe were the occurrence of aseptic meningitis in four patients (3%), and seizures in eight (6%). Seizures occurred only when OKT3 was given to patients with nonfunctioning grafts due to acute tubular necrosis. Infections were the only significant late adverse sequelae of OKT3 therapy and occurred more frequently after multiple exposures to the drug (53%) than after a single exposure (22%). IgG antibodies to OKT3 developed after 45% of exposures to the drug in the 74 patients in whom appearance of anti-OKT3 antibodies was monitored. In two patients (3%), anti-OKT3 antibodies were detected before the end of the OKT3 treatment course, neutralizing the immunosuppressive property of the drug. In five patients (7%), strong anti-OKT3 antibody responses were present at the time of subsequent rejection, which precluded reuse of the drug. In 17 other cases, no or only a weak anti-OKT3 response was detectable at the time of rejection following initial OKT3 exposure. Retreatment with OKT3 was successful in reversing rejection in 15 cases (88%). No untoward sequelae were noted after reexposure to OKT3, except the high incidence of subsequent infections.\r"

  ".W": "With refinements in technical aspects of whole organ pancreas transplantation, allograft rejection is currently the major cause of graft failure. The monoclonal antibody OKT3 has emerged as a highly effective antirejection therapy in renal and hepatic allograft recipients, but its efficacy in pancreas transplantation remains to be determined. During a 12-month period, 28 vascularized whole organ pancreas transplants were performed with pancreatico-cystostomy. Sixteen episodes of allograft rejection were treated with monoclonal antibody OKT3. Indications for OKT3 use included steroid- or antilymphocyte globulin (ALG)-resistant allograft rejection in isolated pancreas (n = 8) or simultaneous kidney-pancreas (n = 8) transplants. A total of 34 rejection episodes occurred in the 16 patients (mean, 2.1; range, one to five). The diagnosis of rejection was based on clinical criteria, a reduction in urinary amylase clearance, radionuclide scanning, hyperglycemia, or associated renal allograft dysfunction in combined engraftments. Postoperative immunosuppression consisted of cyclosporine, prednisone, azathioprine, and prophylactic ALG. OKT3 was administered for a full 14-day course concomitant with low-dose steroids, azathioprine, and cyclosporine. The mean age of the patient population was 32.1 years (range 24 to 39) with a mean duration of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) of 20.9 years. Monoclonal antibody therapy was instituted in two clinical settings: early rejection (within 3 months of transplant, n = 10); and late rejection (after 3 months, n = 6). OKT3 successfully reversed allograft rejection in ten (62.5%) cases, including six early (60%) and four late (66.7%) episodes. In isolated pancreas transplants, OKT3 therapy reversed pancreas allograft rejection in only two patients (25%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Two patients received the antibody as the initial treatment of GVHD, and 22 patients received the antibody after failure of initial treatment with corticosteroids, cyclosporine, antithymocyte globulin (ATG), or combined ATG and cyclosporine. Antibody was administered at four dose levels, beginning at approximately 0.015 mg/kg/d and increasing by threefold increments. The initial doses of antibody were nearly always associated with fever and chills, and treatment had to be discontinued in one patient because of intolerable side effects. Improvement in skin disease could be reliably achieved at a dose of 0.15 mg/kg/d, but threefold higher doses appeared to be necessary for improvement in the liver or gut. In no case was there complete resolution of all manifestations of disease, and all patients surviving after antibody treatment required additional immunosuppressive treatment. Four patients developed Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated lymphoproliferative disorders within seven to 18 days after starting antibody therapy. The overall risk of this complication in patients not given anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody is less than 1%. Anti-CD3 antibody represents an effective immunosuppressive agent for treatment of acute GVHD, but this treatment is associated with a substantial risk of EBV-associated lymphoproliferative disorders.\r"

This study determined the efficacy of the Isolator relative to the Bactec System (Johnston Laboratories, Inc, Towson, MD) for the culture of dialysates from CAPD patients with peritonitis. On the basis of clinical criteria, 31 episodes of peritonitis were included for our study. Dialysate was inoculated into an Isolator and Bactec 6B and 7D bottles. A causative agent was isolated by the Isolator in 29 of 31 episodes, by the Bactec in 29 of 31, and by one or both techniques in 30 of 31 episodes (overall sensitivity 97%). The Isolator failed to detect a Pseudomonas luteola and the Bactec failed to detect a coagulase-negative staphylococcus. Coagulase-positive and negative staphylococci represented 58.1% of the isolates. The Isolator detected 21.4% (six of 28) of the isolates 24 to 72 hours earlier than the Bactec; the Bactec was faster in this regard in 3.6% (one of 28). Time to positivity for the remaining 21 cultures was the same in both systems. Isolate identification and antimicrobial sensitivity was available 24 hours earlier using the Isolator in 96.4% (27 of 28). The Isolator was more rapid and as sensitive as the Bactec system in detecting causative organisms of peritonitis in CAPD patients.\r"

  ".W": "Epidemiologic studies evaluating arterial pulse wave velocity together with blood pressure indicate that: (1) salt intake has an independent effect on arteriolar tone and arterial wall properties, with the former indirectly and the latter directly contributing to increased arterial stiffness with age; and (2) normotensive adult subjects who follow a low sodium diet have reduced arterial stiffness and this effect is independent of blood pressure. Conversely, in elderly persons with isolated systolic hypertension, isotonic saline infusion causes a predominant increase in systolic pressure due to an increase in the stiffness of the arterial wall. The diuretic indapamide produces a decrease in blood pressure without significant change in brachial artery diameter. The result indicates a shift of the pressure-diameter curve, reflecting for the first time in humans a pharmacologic effect of the drug on arterial vessel. Furthermore, diuretic drugs may increase arterial distensibility and compliance in hypertensive patients, but this effect seems to be more pronounced in older than in younger subjects. In the latter, either activation of the sympathetic nervous system or potassium depletion, or both, might counteract the improvement in arterial distensibility caused by blood pressure reduction and sodium depletion. Based on epidemiologic, clinical, and pharmacologic studies, this critical review suggests that, in patients with essential hypertension, changes of sodium intake in diet or administration of diuretics, or both, affect the status of large arteries independently of blood pressure changes.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of indapamide, a nonthiazide diuretic, on urinary electrolytes, renal hemodynamics, and tissue inorganic phosphate was examined in normal anesthetized rats, as well as on vascular reactivity in vitro. Intravenous injections of 0.5 ml/kg of 1 x 10(-5), 1 x 10(-4), and 1 x 10(-3) M indapamide solutions reduced mean arterial pressure from 123 to 114, 130 to 113, and 128 to 114 mm Hg and the plasma phosphate concentrations from 6.4 to 4.2, 6.6 to 4.8, and 7.0 to 4.5 mg/dl, respectively. Similarly, there was a dose-dependent effect of indapamide on fractional excretion of phosphate, which increased from 17 to 44, 24 to 53, and 18 to 75 percent in animals receiving increasing doses of indapamide. This effect of indapamide on the external phosphate balance was associated with significant reduction of kidney cortex and skeletal muscle total inorganic phosphate. In contrast, fractional sodium excretion augmented by 2.6, 2.5, and 2.5 percent, respectively, at each dose of indapamide. This compound also reduced significantly the contractions of strips of rabbit aorta and mesenteric artery elicited by norepinephrine (0.01 to 1.0 micrograms/ml). These results suggest that indapamide-induced reduction of blood pressure could be mediated by an effect of this drug on phosphate balance, and probably on vascular reactivity.\r"

The essential properties of these different systems, their pharmacologic features, and their regulation by various agonists (beta- and alpha-adrenergic angiotensin-type peptides, etc.) must be considered both for an understanding of the pathophysiology of hypertension and for its treatment.\r"

Twenty-four-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring using an ICR model 5200 portable recorder and evaluation of general well-being were performed prior to and at the end of three months of therapy with indapamide 2.5 mg given once daily, or captopril 12.5 to 50 mg given twice daily. Indapamide and captopril were equally effective in controlling blood pressures in clinic and during 24-hour activities. Although general well-being and subjective symptomatology improved with both treatments, the only significant difference between the two drugs was improvement in the sleep dysfunction scale with indapamide (p less than 0.02). The results shown in this study suggest that both indapamide (2.5 mg) once daily and captopril (12.5 to 50 mg) twice daily are suitable drugs for initial therapy of active patients with mild to moderate hypertension. A fixed once-daily dosage of an antihypertensive agent may, however, increase patient compliance and convenience.\r"

However, due to different cultural and social backgrounds, lifestyles, and so on, the tolerability may differ from one population to another and the conclusions drawn from a population cannot be extrapolated to people of other countries. For these reasons, the well-being of patients, as well as the tolerability of indapamide, a non-thiazide diuretic, have been investigated in patients with hypertension of mild and moderate degree from different parts of Italy with a satisfactory blood-pressure response to this drug (-22.8 +/- 0.6/-17.1 +/- 0.5 mm Hg). Simultaneous to the significant blood-pressure reduction, the only significant change among the metabolic effects was a slight reduction in plasma potassium levels (-0.37 +/- 0.03 meq/liter). The tolerability was, on the whole, very good with a tendency toward an improvement of well-being in patients, the majority of whom were already asymptomatic before starting the treatment.\r"

Both sodium handling and the renin-angiotensin system are involved in the aging process. Among the available classes of antihypertensive agents, the eventual deterioration of renal function induced by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in bilateral stenosis and stenosis of a single functioning kidney suggests that changes in glomerular pressure may participate in the changes of renal function. In essential hypertension and other conditions, it is possible that at a certain stage an increase in intraglomerular capillary pressure plays a role in the acceleration of the loss in renal function. As a consequence, it is proposed that in treating hypertension we should aim at reducing systemic blood pressure together with an attempt to reduce intraglomerular pressure using agents that act predominantly on post-glomerular resistance in order to have renal protection.\r"

The dramatic reductions in the incidence of cerebrovascular events and congestive heart failure among patients receiving antihypertensive therapy have not been paralleled by similar reductions in cardiac morbidity or mortality. Several lines of evidence now point to the possibility that adverse metabolic changes are induced by certain antihypertensive drugs. These changes may offset, negate, or even reverse the potential benefit afforded by successful blood pressure control.\r"

Such deleterious effects on a cardiovascular risk factor could limit the long-term benefit of an antihypertensive treatment. Indapamide is a nonthiazide antihypertensive agent that appears to respect the glucose tolerance in hypertensive patients. The present study was conducted to assess the effects of indapamide 2.5 mg in 10 hypertensive non-insulin-dependent diabetic patients treated for a one-year period. Glucose tolerance was evaluated using a 50-g oral glucose test, with measurements of plasma glucose and insulin before and after treatment. At the end of the one-year treatment, both systolic and diastolic blood pressure were significantly reduced, whereas there was no significant alteration in either plasma glucose or plasma insulin levels. Thus, indapamide appears as an effective antihypertensive agent in the diabetic patient, with no adverse effects on the glucose tolerance.\r"

The role of hypertension as a cardiovascular risk factor has been confirmed in the elderly population by the increase in cerebrovascular accidents, and by the incidence of myocardial infarction with the rise in blood pressure. The relationship between elevated diastolic and systolic blood pressure and mortality rates in the elderly is also well documented (Framingham). Effective treatment of hypertension significantly reduces the risk of associated complications: cardiovascular death, congestive heart failure, and stroke. However, the goal of antihypertensive therapy in the elderly should be not only to reduce morbidity and mortality rates, but also to do so without adverse effects on the functional well-being of patients.\r"

No significant difference in the weight distribution between fetuses with Down syndrome and control fetuses, corrected for gestational age, was found. By contrast, fetuses with trisomy 18 had a significantly lower weight distribution compared with that of the control fetuses (p less than 0.001). A linear relationship was found in normal fetuses between maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein values and fetal weight at a given gestational age.

An examination of the number of movements per hour demonstrated that fetuses at 24 to 26 weeks' gestation moved on the average 53.4 +/- 1.6 times/hr, which was significantly different from 26 to 28 weeks' gestation when fetuses made 46.2 +/- 1.4 movements/hr. When examined on an hourly basis, fetuses in both age groups demonstrated a significant increase in the number of movements overnight from 2300 to 0800 hours. Intermovement intervals were also examined. Ninety-nine percent of intervals less than 6 minutes in both age groups contained movement. The longest observed quiescent interval was 24 minutes in both age groups. These data suggest that the incidence of fetal body movements is different than that observed in fetuses during the last 10 weeks of gestation. Fetuses at 24 to 28 weeks' gestation exhibit a diurnal pattern of fetal movement and move more frequently than do older fetuses. However, these movements are of a sporadic nature and relatively short duration. Thus these fetuses do not appear to have well-defined periods of rest and activity.\r"

Only wound infections in the study population were predictive for therapeutic outcome. Four of the five patients who received mezlocillin and none of the three patients who received clindamycin and gentamicin with wound infections were associated with therapeutic failures. This suggests mezlocillin may not be as effective as clindamycin and gentamicin in successfully treating wound infections. The number of vaginal examinations in patients sectioned for cephalopelvic disproportion was associated with increased febrile morbidity, suggesting that an excessive number of vaginal examinations should be avoided in the laboring patient.\r"

The appearance of the fundus, external eye, visual fields, tear secretion, blood pressure, and pulse were recorded. Adverse symptoms were elicited using a menu-type questionnaire and an overall judgment of therapy was recorded. Carteolol was as effective as timolol in reducing intraocular pressure. There were significantly fewer patients reporting adverse events overall (P = .019), and eye irritation specifically (P = .02), in the group treated with carteolol.\r"

In this study human blood monocyte (BM)-derived giant cells were generated by lymphokine stimulation in vitro. Their immunophenotype and ultrastructural morphology resembled that of MGCs occurring in vivo. Mitotic activity within MGCs could not be established either in vitro or in vivo. Enzyme equipment of MGCs was elevated in comparison with monocyte-macrophages. In comparison with unfused monocyte-macrophages, MGCs did not reveal a higher level of interleukin-1 production or cytostatic activity. They showed, however, a 20-30-fold increase in the production of oxygen-free radicals in response to zymosan. Transcription of the proto-oncogene c-fms was enhanced in short-term cultivated BM and was rapidly down-regulated in MGCs after fusion had occurred. It is concluded that MGCs represent highly stimulated cells of monocyte-macrophage lineage at a terminal stage of maturation.\r"

  ".W": "Contraction is an important phenomenon in wound repair and hypertrophic scarring. Studies indicate that wound contraction involves a specialized cell known as the myofibroblast, which has morphologic characteristics of both smooth muscle and fibroblastic cells. In order to better characterize the myofibroblast, the authors have examined its cytoskeleton and surrounding extracellular matrix (ECM) in human burn granulation tissue, human hypertrophic scar, and rat granulation tissue by indirect immunofluorescence. Primary antibodies used in this study were directed against 1) smooth muscle myosin and 2) nonmuscle myosin, components of the cytoskeleton in smooth muscle and nonmuscle cells, respectively, and 3) laminin and 4) fibronectin, extracellular glycoproteins mediating cell-matrix attachment in smooth muscle and nonmuscle cells, respectively. Myofibroblasts can be identified by their intense staining of actin bundles with either anti-actin antibody or NBD-phallacidin. Myofibroblasts in all tissues stained for nonmuscle but not smooth muscle myosin. In addition, nonmuscle myosin was localized as intracellular fibrils, which suggests their similarity to stress fibers in cultured fibroblasts. The ECM around myofibroblasts stains intensely for fibronectin but lacks laminin, which suggests that a true basal lamina is not present. The immunocytochemical findings suggest that the myofibroblast is a specialized nonmuscle type of cell, not a smooth muscle cell.\r"

  ".W": "Plasma gelsolin is one of two extracellular proteins that bind actin, a major body protein, with high affinity. The authors performed a series of experiments to determine whether tissue injury leads to actin release and the formation of circulating actin-gelsolin complexes. Two functions of plasma gelsolin, filament-nucleating and filament-severing activity, were used to measure total and free gelsolin concentrations, respectively. Both gelsolin and gelsolin-actin complexes nucleate actin assembly, whereas only free gelsolin severs actin filaments. Therefore, nucleation reflects the total gelsolin concentration, severing, the free gelsolin concentration, and the difference, gelsolin-actin complexes. Injection of F-actin in the rat caused a reduction in the free, but not total, gelsolin levels, consistent with the formation of circulating actin-gelsolin complexes. Oleic acid (50 mg/kg) administered intravenously in rats, a treatment that causes acute hemorrhagic pulmonary necrosis, caused the free gelsolin concentration to fall to a greater extent than the total gelsolin concentration, which indicated the presence of circulating actin-gelsolin complexes. Lower doses (9-27 mg/kg) in rabbits caused a qualitatively similar but smaller change in the free gelsolin level. Plasma gelsolin was immunoprecipitated at times when actin-gelsolin complexes were present, as determined functionally, and bound actin was demonstrated by immunoblotting with an anti-actin antiserum. These studies show that considerable amounts of actin are released into the extracellular space during acute lung injury and that circulating actin-gelsolin complexes can be detected in the peripheral blood.\r"

  ".U": "88131259\r", 
  ".W": "Electron-microscopic and immunohistochemical studies performed during pancreatic carcinogenesis in hamsters demonstrated that hypertrophy and hyperplasia of centroacinar cells were the earliest changes occurring in the pancreas. These altered centroacinar cells differentiated into either endocrine-type cells or elongated agranular cells with remarkably long cytoplasmic processes (CyPs). These CyPs seemed gradually to overlie and underlie the adjacent acinar cells and resulted in progressive degeneration and loss of acinar cells, which subsequently were replaced by altered centroacinar cells. The initially rather tiny and slender CyPs were characterized by the expression of blood group substances, which were also found in the surface of altered ductal cells. Because these antigens could not be demonstrated in normal pancreatic cells, they seemed to represent specific markers for altered ductal/ductular (centroacinar) cells. In no instance was there evidence of dedifferentiation of acinar cells into ductlike cells. The present data, along with our previous findings, demonstrate that centroacinar cells are the foundation for pseudoductular structures and are the progenitor cells of tumors arising from them.\r"

  ".W": "Expression of T-cell antigens by Reed-Sternberg (RS) cells has not been detected in most studies of Hodgkin's disease (HD). The authors employed an improved method of fixation (paraformaldehyde-lysine-periodate), which sharply defined cell borders and revealed T-cell antigens on RS cells in 8 of 30 (27%) cases of HD. Antigen-specific staining was confirmed by immunoelectron microscopy. RS cells expressed T11 (8/8 cases), Leu-3 or T4 (4/8 cases), Leu-4 or T3 (3/8 cases), but not other T-cell specific antigens (Leu-1, T8, T6, 3A1). RS cells were negative for leukocyte common antigen (LCA/T200), in contrast to positive LCA/T200 staining of RS-like cells in T-cell lymphomas. RS cells in all HD cases were positive for Ki-1 and/or Leu-M1 antigens. The percentage of RS cells expressing T-cell antigens was less than 20% (2 cases), 20-50% (3 cases), or greater than 50% (3 cases). This percentage and the specific T-cell antigens expressed varied in tissues from different sites in each of 2 cases. Expression of T-cell antigens by RS cells was found in nodular sclerosis (6 of 20 cases) and mixed cellularity (2 of 5 cases) but not in lymphocyte predominance (2 cases), lymphocyte depletion (1 case), or unclassified types (2 cases). Two cases of nodular sclerosis contained areas of necrosis surrounded by sheets of lacunar cells (syncytial variant of NSHD). Two other cases were associated with cutaneous lymphoma. One of these cases was mixed cellularity HD, which appeared to be confined to the skin. In a second case, tumor cells of similar phenotype (T4+, Ki-1+) were found in skin and lymph nodes of a patient with coexistent mycosis fungoides and HD. These results are consistent with an origin of RS cells from T cells in some cases of nodular sclerosing and mixed cellularity HD. They also suggest that the same cell type, an activated helper T-cell, is involved in the pathogenesis of both skin lesions and lymphadenopathy of some patients with coexistent mycosis fungoides and HD.\r"
