SETTING: Level I trauma center, city/county institution. TYPE OF PARTICIPANTS: Patients with hollow visceral organ injury following major blunt or penetrating trauma whose diagnostic peritoneal lavage was negative by lavage red blood cell and lavage white blood cell were negative. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Fifty-one patients with injury isolated to one or more hollow visceral structures underwent diagnostic peritoneal lavage; 28 were positive based on aspirate, lavage red blood cell count (greater than 100,000/mm3), or lavage white blood cell count (greater than 500/mm3). Of the remaining 23 patients, each of 11 with isolated small bowel injury had LAM greater than or equal to 20 IU/L and six of these had LAP levels greater than or equal to 3 IU/L. All six patients with colon injury and two of the patients with gallbladder injury had LAM less than 20 IU/L and LAP less than 3 IU/L. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with hollow visceral injury and otherwise normal diagnostic peritoneal lavage, elevation in LAM is highly specific for isolated small bowel injury. Lavage enzyme determinations appear unhelpful in the detection of colonic injury. We recommend routine enzyme determinations of lavage effluent as a marker for isolated small bowel injury.\r"

Results of all intra-abdominal evaluations were recorded. MAIN RESULTS: Significantly greater numbers of patients with SGOT and/or SGPT elevated to more than 130 IU/L had associated intra-abdominal injuries as compared with patients with enzyme elevations of less than 130 IU/L (52% versus 8%). All 18 patients with liver injuries had one or both enzymes elevated to more than 130 IU/L. Higher enzyme levels were more frequently associated with liver injury. CONCLUSIONS: Elevation of serum levels of the study enzymes is a marker for intra-abdominal injury. Levels in excess of 130 IU/L are relative indicators of abdominal computed tomography scan. Levels of less than 130 IU/L are unlikely to be associated with liver injury.\r"

DESIGN: Retrospective case-control analysis. SETTING: University of California San Diego Medical Center. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Between January 1985 and July 1988, 3,223 blunt trauma patients were admitted, with complete records available on 3,011. Using a \"best fit\" multiple logistic regression, BD less than or equal to -6 was the single most important indicator of AI (P less than or equal to .0001), and the odds ratio for AI increased with each category of increasing severity of BD. Admission hypotension, major chest injury, pelvic fracture, and field hypotension (in odds ratio order) also were significantly associated with AI. CONCLUSION: BD is a powerful indicator of AI. A normal BD does not exclude AI, but the presence of a BD less than or equal to -6 in a blunt trauma patient should be considered a strong indication for objective evaluation of the abdomen (ie, diagnostic peritoneal lavage).\r"

DESIGN: All cases at a Level I trauma center between January 1, 1986, and March 31, 1989, were reviewed retrospectively. SETTING: Level I trauma center, university hospital. TYPE OF PARTICIPANTS: All patients with acute blunt abdominal trauma admitted to this Level I trauma center. INTERVENTIONS: The patients' charts were reviewed with emphasis on mode of diagnosis, treatment, and outcome. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Twenty-one patients had bladder rupture. All 21 had hematuria with more than 50 RBCs/high-power field, 17 gross and four microscopic. Twenty patients underwent retrograde cystography, which accurately identified bladder rupture, and one was found at laparotomy for other injuries. Seven patients had CT of the abdomen and pelvis, which failed to demonstrate bladder rupture. There were no associated urethral injuries in any of the patients with bladder rupture. CONCLUSION: Significant (more than 50 RBCs/high-power field) hematuria is the principal indication for evaluation for blunt bladder injury, and retrograde cystography is the diagnostic procedure of choice. CT is neither sensitive nor specific enough as primary diagnostic modality.\r"

DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of all injury reports from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, and the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. RESULTS: For the period of 1978 through 1987, there were 694 reported injuries from explosions during tire servicing; 143 of them were fatal, resulting mainly from truck tires. Because the three data sources used different methods for case finding and covered different time periods, the actual number of such injuries was probably greater. Head injuries accounted for 78% of the deaths and 24% of nonfatal injuries. The proportion of injuries occurring during tire inflation declined from 51% in 1978 to 33% in 1987 (P less than .05). Fatal injuries involving single-piece rim wheels increased during the 1980s as multipiece rim wheels were phased out by the trucking industry. CONCLUSIONS: Exploding truck tires and wheel rims cause serious injuries. The use of safety cages during inflation as required by a 1980 Occupational Safety and Health Administration standard appears to have reduced injuries during truck tire inflation. The use of helmets during servicing may further reduce serious injuries.\r"

SETTING: The emergency departments of eight medical centers across the state of Illinois, including representatives from urban, rural, teaching, and community facilities. TYPE OF PARTICIPANTS: All motorcycle crash victims presenting less than 24 hours after injury for whom helmet information was known. Data were collected from April 1 through October 31, 1988. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Fifty-eight of 398 patients (14.6%) were helmeted, and 340 (85.4%) were not. The nonhelmeted patients had higher Injury Severity Scores (11.9 vs 7.02), sustained head/neck injuries more frequently (41.7 vs 24.1%), and had lower Glasgow Coma Scores (13.73 vs 14.51). Twenty-five of the 26 fatalities were nonhelmeted patients. By logistic regression, the lack of helmet use was found to be a major risk factor for increased severity of injury. A 23% increase in health care costs was demonstrated for nonhelmeted patients (average charges $7,208 vs $5,852). CONCLUSION: Helmet use may reduce the overall severity of injury and the incidence of head injuries resulting from motorcycle crashes. A trend toward higher health care costs was demonstrated in the nonhelmeted patients.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE: Transportation, whether by air or ground, exposes the injured patient to mechanical shocks and vibrations. These forces and their hazardous potential remain largely unknown. The purpose of this study was to identify, characterize, and compare the forces generated during patient transport in helicopter and ground ambulances. METHODS: Forces generated during transport were measured using an instrumented, low mass triaxial accelerometer fixed to a standard backboard. Measurements were recorded in three axes with an adult subject immobilized on the board during experimental ambulance and helicopter trials. Acceleration waveforms were analyzed in each mode of transport. RESULTS: Forces for both ground and air transport ranged 0.07g to 0.19g root mean square, and 0.32g to 0.83g mean peak. The vibrational forces in the helicopter were fairly discrete, located at 6.6, 19.5, and 39 Hz, and axis dependent. Ground ambulance vibrations were more diffuse, occurring below 1 Hz and between 10 and 15 Hz. Crest factor analysis shows that shocks were more uniform in the helicopter than on the ground, especially in the anterior-posterior axis. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that transportation by helicopter subjects supine patients to greater lateral and vertical forces, but smaller head to toe forces, than ground transportation (P less than .05). In general, the forces to which a backboarded subject is subjected during transport range from 0.32g to 0.83g, vary by direction, and are more predictable for air than for ground transport. The clinical significance of these measurements requires further study.\r"

INTERVENTIONS: Volunteers were measured in standing and supine positions. MEASUREMENTS: Occipital offset; height; weight; and head, neck, and chest circumferences were measured for each subject. MAIN RESULTS: The amount of occipital offset required to achieve neutral position varied from 0 to 3.75 in. (mean, 1.5 in.). Mean occipital offset for men (1.67 in.) was significantly greater than that for women (1.31 in.) Easily obtained body measurements did not accurately predict occipital offset. CONCLUSION: Immobilization on a flat backboard would place 98% of our study subjects in relative cervical extension. Occipital padding would place a greater percentage of patients in neutral position and increase patient comfort during transport.\r"

DESIGN: Retrospective review of aeromedical registry data and clinical chart review. MEASUREMENTS: Aeromedical trauma transfers made during a four-year period were studied. The TRISS method was used to determine predicted survivals for DTP patients, patients transferred after a four-hour delay, and patients transferred promptly. RESULTS: The observed survival for 469 aeromedically transferred patients with blunt trauma was the same as that predicted by TRISS analysis (394 vs 392.5). Survival for 86 patients with DTP was also the same as predicted (62 vs 61.6). Outcomes for nonDTP patients and for 92 patients experiencing a delay in transport of four hours or more were also the same as predicted. CONCLUSION: Early versus delayed decision to transfer patients with blunt trauma did not appear to influence overall outcome. These data suggest that minor delays in recognizing the need to transfer patients with blunt injuries to a trauma center for definitive care may be offset by rapid, skilled transfer and highly specialized trauma care and support the hypothesis that regional trauma center care after initial evaluation and resuscitation elsewhere can be effective even when the timing of transfer is not ideal.\r"

DESIGN: Prospective, cross-sectional, paired measurements of SpO2 against SaO2. SETTING: This evaluation was done in the prehospital setting. INTERVENTIONS: A pulse oximeter with digital probe was used to measure SpO2 in 30 patients. Arterial blood gases were drawn in the field while the pulse oximeter was in use, and oxygen saturation (HbO2) was measured by CO-oximetry. MAIN RESULTS: There was no significant difference between SpO2 (94.6 +/- 5.4%) and HbO2 (94.9 +/- 5.1%) (P = .495, beta less than .2). There was a strong correlation between SpO2 and HbO2 (r = .898). The bias between SpO2 and HbO2 was -0.3, with a precision of 2.4. When SpO2 was 88% or more, HbO2 was 90% or more in every case. Mean carboxyhemoglobin was 1.3 +/- 0.9%, and mean methemoglobin was 0.9 +/- 0.3%. There was no significant difference between the pulse oximeter heart rate and the ECG heart rate (P = .223, beta less than .2). CONCLUSION: We conclude that pulse oximetry is sufficiently accurate to be useful in the field when SpO2 is more than 88%. It is potentially useful in patients with clinical signs of acute hypoxemia and in patients receiving interventions that may produce acute hypoxemia. Further work is needed to evaluate the accuracy of pulse oximetry in the settings of elevated carboxyhemoglobin, methemoglobin, and very low saturations.\r"

Abdominal ultrasound can be deceptive in evaluating interstitial ectopic pregnancies. Transvaginal ultrasonography is more sensitive in the diagnosis of early ectopic pregnancy. Knowledge of the application and limitations of both transabdominal and transvaginal ultrasound will assist the emergency physician in the timely evaluation of this potentially lethal condition.\r"

DESIGN: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled intervention study. PATIENTS: One hundred thirty-three adult patients with either asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who presented to the emergency department with asthma or wheezing. INTERVENTIONS: All patients received therapy with both aerosolized metaproterenol and intravenous methyl-prednisolone. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either a loading dose of aminophylline followed by a routine infusion (n = 65) or an equal volume of placebo as a loading dose and infusion (n = 68). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: At discharge from the emergency department, the median serum theophylline concentration for the aminophylline group was 54 mumol/L (9.7 mg/L). The two groups showed no differences (P greater than 0.2) in measurements of forced expiratory volume at 1 second (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC), or peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) at baseline or at 60 or 120 minutes after aminophylline administration. Neither patient satisfaction nor physician assessment of response to therapy differed between the two groups. There was no difference (P greater than 0.2) in the frequency of side effects, except for a trend toward a higher frequency of nausea (P = 0.13) in the aminophylline group. There was, however, a threefold decrease in the hospital admission rate for patients treated with aminophylline (6%) compared with placebo recipients (21%) (P = 0.016). CONCLUSION: Aminophylline, in doses producing levels just below the commonly accepted therapeutic range, appears to decrease hospital admissions in patients with acute exacerbation of asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. This finding, if confirmed in larger studies, may represent a substantial cost savings.\r"

  ".U": "91307190\r", 
  ".W": "OBJECTIVE: To determine the point at which adverse quality-of-life effects engendered by an aggressive cholesterol-lowering strategy dictate the use of a less aggressive approach. DESIGN: Decision analysis was used to compare the effects of the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) guidelines, an aggressive program, with those of the Canadian Task Force on the Periodic Health Examination (CTF) guidelines, a more conservative program. Quality-adjusted life expectancy was calculated for a theoretical cohort of middle-aged men treated according to each program using Markov cohort analysis. MEASUREMENTS: Guidelines were applied to the population of the Lipid Research Clinics Coronary Primary Prevention Trial (LRC-CPPT), under the assumption that cholesterol levels had the distribution of the age- and sex-matched general population. Outcomes were calculated using a three-state (health, coronary heart disease, and death) Markov model. State transition probabilities were calculated using bivariate (age and cholesterol) proportional hazards and logistic regression functions. MAIN RESULTS: The result was a \"toss-up\"; the number of expected quality-adjusted life years was similar for both programs at all time intervals, although the conservative program was consistently slightly favored. The result was very sensitive to the disutility of dietary therapy (threshold value, 0.0014 compared with the baseline estimate of 0.02) but was also affected by the time frame of the analysis and the rate at which adverse effects of treatment decline. CONCLUSIONS: Even small disutilities associated with treatment may outweight the benefits of aggressive cholesterol-lowering strategies. Research should be directed toward measuring these disutilities and finding ways to reduce their size. Incorporation of the disutility of treatment into policy formulation may result in less interventionist and less costly policies.\r"

SETTING: Veterans Affairs hospital. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred and five patients with endoscopically verified duodenal ulcers. INTERVENTION: Patients received either ranitidine, 300 mg/d, or ranitidine, 300 mg/d, plus \"triple therapy\" (2 g/d of tetracycline, 750 mg/d of metronidazole, and 5 or 8 bismuth subsalicylate tablets per day). Triple therapy was administered for only the first 2 weeks of ulcer treatment. MEASUREMENTS: Videoendoscopic assessment of ulcer status was done until ulcer healing was complete. Evaluations were done after 2, 4, 8, 12, and 16 weeks of therapy. MAIN RESULTS: Ulcer healing was more rapid in patients receiving ranitidine plus triple therapy than in patients receiving ranitidine alone (P less than 0.01). The cumulative percentages of patients with healed ulcers in the group receiving ranitidine plus triple therapy and in the group receiving ranitidine alone were as follows: 37% and 18% after week 2; 74% and 53% after week 4; 84% and 68% after week 8; 96% and 80% after week 12; and 98% and 84% after week 16. CONCLUSION: Combined therapy with anti-H. pylori agents and ranitidine was superior to ranitidine alone for duodenal ulcer healing. Our results indicate that H. pylori plays a role in duodenal ulcer disease.\r"

DESIGN: Case-control study. SETTING: Tertiary care, referral-based medical center. PATIENTS: Of 28,978 intravenous urographic contrast media procedures done from July 1987 to June 1988, 49 patients experienced moderate to severe anaphylactoid reaction. Medical records from these 49 reactors were compared with those from a control group matched for gender, age, and date and type of contrast study who received intravenous urographic contrast media without adverse reaction. MAIN RESULTS: Patients exposed to beta-adrenergic blockers or with asthma comprised 39% (19 of 49) of reactors, compared to 16% (13 of 83) of matched controls (odds ratio, 3.43; 95% CI, 1.45 to 8.15; P = 0.005). Exposure to beta-blockers was 27% among reactors and 12% in matched controls (odds ratio, 2.67; CI, 1.01 to 7.05; P = 0.036). Asthma was found in 12% of reactors and 4% of controls; after correction for beta-blocker use, asthma was also associated with increased risk for anaphylactoid reaction (odds ratio, 4.54; CI, 1.03 to 20.05; P = 0.046). Compared with nonasthmatic patients not taking beta-blockers, asthmatic patients were at greater risk for anaphylactoid reaction with bronchospasm (P = 0.02). Five of 13 reactors receiving beta-blockers became hypotensive, and three needed hospitalization. Compared with nonasthmatic patients not taking beta-blockers, patients exposed to beta-blocking drugs were almost nine times (odds ratio, 8.7; CI, 0.81 to 93.5; P = 0.075) more likely to be hospitalized after an anaphylactoid reaction. CONCLUSION: Increased risk for moderate to severe anaphylactoid reaction from intravenous urographic contrast media exists in patients receiving beta-adrenergic blockers or with asthma. These patients are appropriate target populations for efforts to reduce risk before intravenous urographic contrast media are administered.\r"

DESIGN: Retrospective data analysis. SETTING: A 485-bed county hospital. PATIENTS: One hundred and one consecutive patients with cocaine-related chest pain admitted to the hospital to rule out myocardial infarction. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The quality of the chest pain frequently suggested myocardial ischemia. Dyspnea was common (56%). The onset of chest pain occurred during cocaine use in 21% of patients, within 1 hour of use in 37%, and after 1 hour of use in 42%. Admission electrocardiographic findings were interpreted as normal in 32% of patients; as acute myocardial injury in 8%; as early repolarization variant in 32%; as left ventricular hypertrophy in 16%; and as \"other\" in 12%. Forty-three percent of patients had ST-segment elevation meeting the electrocardiographic criteria for use of thrombolytic therapy, but such elevation was usually due to the early repolarization variant. The initial total creatine kinase was elevated more than 3.3 mu kat/L (200 U/L) in 43% of patients, and an elevated total creatine kinase was recorded at some time during the hospital course in 47% of patients. The creatine kinase MB fraction was less than 0.02 in all patients. Myocardial infarction was ruled out in all patients. No patient experienced in-hospital cardiovascular complications. CONCLUSION: The quality of acute chest pain related to cocaine use is indistinguishable from that experienced in acute myocardial ischemia. Abnormal or normal variant electrocardiographic findings are common in patients with chest pain related to cocaine use, but nevertheless the incidence of acute myocardial infarction is low. The ST-segment and T-wave changes can mimic acute myocardial injury and are most likely normal findings in young black men that can be readily recognized in the emergency department. Most of these patients do not require admission to an intensive care unit.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: To determine whether there is sufficient information in the medical literature to guide appropriate treatment of hypertensive women. DATA IDENTIFICATION: Epidemiologic surveys of hypertension, clinical trials of antihypertensive therapy, and studies of selected adverse effects of antihypertensive agents were identified through a computerized search using MEDLINE and by identifying all studies cited in current medical textbooks as supporting evidence for the guidelines for the treatment of hypertensive individuals. All epidemiologic studies selected were cross-sectional or longitudinal, multicenter, population-based surveys. All clinical trials were large, randomized studies comparing one or more antihypertensive agents with a placebo or nonplacebo control group. Epidemiologic studies and clinical trials were reviewed to assess the quantity and quality of information available regarding important aspects of hypertension in women. Data pertaining to epidemiology, natural history, results of treatment, and two significant side effects of antihypertensive treatment were examined. RESULTS OF DATA ANALYSIS: The prevalence of hypertension is greater in black women than in black men and is about equal in white women and men. Because women outnumber men in the population, there are more hypertensive women than men. The attributable risk percent (the proportion of end points that could be eliminated by removing hypertension) for cardiovascular complications of hypertension is higher for women than men. Clinical trials show clear benefit of therapy for black women but no clear benefit for white women; some studies suggest that treatment of white women is harmful. Lipid profiles and their relation to ischemic heart disease differ for women and men; there is currently no information on the effects of antihypertensive agents on serum lipids in women. Few data have been published on the frequency of sexual dysfunction in treated hypertensive women. CONCLUSIONS: Hypertension in women and its related cardiovascular outcomes are a major public health problem. Clinical trials of antihypertensive therapy do not fully support current guidelines for the treatment of hypertensive women. Research concerning adverse effects of antihypertensive agents has largely excluded women from consideration; further studies are required to guide appropriate treatment.\r"

DATA SOURCE: Relevant articles were identified through a search of MEDLINE using the following indexing terms: primary immunodeficiencies (and subclassifications), and human immunomodulators (and subclassifications). STUDY SELECTION: Articles were critically reviewed and included if relevant. DATA SYNTHESIS: The primary immunodeficiency disorders are classified according to functional abnormalities, specifically, abnormalities in early cellular maturation, differentiation, regulatory cell function, enzymatic function, and cytokine responses. Such a classification clarifies the potential role of biologic response modifiers in primary immunodeficiency disorders. Intravenous gammaglobulin and histamine-2 (H2)-receptor blockers modify regulatory cell function; retinoids modify abnormal cellular differentiation, gene transfer and enzyme replacement can be applied in disorders characterized by specific functional gene abnormalities; and interferons modify abnormal cytokine responses. Interleukin-2, thymic hormones, transfer factor, and levamisole appear to affect multiple functional defects. CONCLUSIONS: Biologic response modifiers are currently important ancillary tools in the treatment of immunodeficiency disorders, and their therapeutic role will become even more important in the future. Multi-center cooperative trials of new and existing agents are needed to fully define their roles and efficacy in the treatment of these disorders.\r"

PARTICIPANTS: Senior family medicine and internal medicine residents in Canada and in ten geographically representative American states. MAIN RESULTS: American and Canadian residents had similar levels of professional satisfaction and almost universally agreed on the ethical obligation to provide care to persons of all social circumstances, but U.S. residents were more likely to perceive a serious access problem in their country (75% compared with 18%) and to think that current controls on the medical profession interfere with patient care (81% compared with 58%; P less than 0.001). In addition, U.S. residents were more likely than Canadian residents to believe that primary care salaries were too low (78% compared with 38%) and that salaries of medical subspecialists (57% compared with 17%) and surgeons (85% compared with 28%) were too high. In general, residents preferred their own country's predominant health care system. Whereas 87% of U.S. physicians supported private fee-for-service health care, 85% of Canadian physicians supported government-funded national health insurance. Nonetheless, 42% of U.S. physicians supported and only 17% strongly opposed national health insurance as an alternative approach. About two thirds of respondents from both countries opposed a salaried national health service. CONCLUSIONS: American residents perceived greater problems with access, overall intrusions into medical practice, and fee disparities than did their Canadian counterparts. They preferred private fee-for-service health care, but few strongly opposed government-funded national health insurance as an alternative approach to the health care needs of the United States.\r"

The sulfonamides, the first effective antibacterial agents, were marketed in an era of relatively few regulations. Although investigators at times designed controlled trials to evaluate use of the drugs, both researchers and practitioners generally prescribed them for severe infections, despite a lack of conclusive data as to their efficacy. The clinical usefulness of sulfonamides for a given condition often became known through uncontrolled case studies and comparisons with historical control groups. Given the relaxation of FDA regulations, this method of drug evaluation may again become more commonplace.\r"

This enhancement was dose dependent within a therapeutic range of AmB levels (0.1 to 3.0 mg/liter). Macrophages cultured in the presence of AmB had enhanced surface expression of Ia antigen; phagocytosis of unopsonized zymosan, opsonized Staphylococcus aureus, or erythrocytes opsonized with C3bi or immunoglobulin G paradoxically appeared to be reduced, but results did not achieve statistical significance. AmB appears to activate macrophages and may do so via direct effects on the plasma membrane.\r"

In addition to unchanged drug, two catabolites, 5'-O-glucuronide (GAZT) and 3'-amino-3'-deoxythymidine (AMT), were detected in plasma within 30 min. GAZT exhibited a kinetic profile similar to that of AZT, with an elimination half-life of approximately 1 h, while AMT was more variable, with an apparent half-life of 1.6 +/- 1.5 h. Approximately 90% of the total administered dose was recovered in urine within 24 h as AZT, GAZT, AMT, and the 5'-O-glucuronide of AMT. AZT and AMT demonstrated similar cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) penetration 1 h after AZT treatment, while GAZT poorly crossed the blood-brain barrier. Concomitant administration of probenecid greatly altered the pharmacokinetics of AZT, GAZT, and AMT, resulting in prolongation of their apparent elimination half-lives, increased concentrations in plasma, and marked reduction in renal clearances. In addition, the CSF/plasma concentration ratios for AZT and its catabolites were greatly increased, suggesting that probenecid inhibits efflux of AZT and its catabolites from CSF to plasma. The substantial levels of AMT in plasma suggest that this catabolite affects the pharmacodynamic properties of AZT in relation to its activity against human immunodeficiency virus replication and cytotoxicity to host cells. Enhanced AMT levels in plasma in the presence of probenecid may decrease the therapeutic efficacy of the AZT-probenecid combination.\r"

The Tet determinants were transferred by conjugation into a plasmid-free Enterococcus faecalis recipient at frequencies of 10(-6) to 10(-9) transconjugants per donor, as follows: Tcr, 6 strains; Tcr-Mnr, 14 strains; both Tcr and Tcr-Mnr, 6 strains; no detectable transfer, 4 strains. Classes L (Tcr phenotype) and M and O (Tcr-Mnr phenotype) of the Tet determinants were identified by DNA-DNA hybridization experiments. The Tet L determinant was plasmid-borne in 18 strains and was chromosomal in 2 strains. Tet M was chromosomal in 27 strains and plasmid-borne (pIP1534) in 1 strain; pIP1534 also carried Tet L. Tet M was located on Tn916-like elements in 22 strains and on a Tn916-modified element in 1 strain. Tet O was detected in only one strain in which it was plasmid-borne. Both Tet L and Tet M determinants were carried by 19 strains. One strain carried, in addition to chromosomal nonconjugative Tet L and Tet M determinants, a conjugative Tcr-Mnr marker which did not correspond to any Tet determinant tested in this study. These results attest to the genetic complexity of tetracycline resistance in E. faecium strains.\r"

With penicillin G, piperacillin, imipenem, and six cephalosporins, the susceptibility levels were similar for both beta-lactamase-positive and -negative strains. By using spectrophotometric and microbiological assays, the beta-lactamase from three strains hydrolyzed ampicillin, amoxicillin, penicillin G, cloxacillin, and, partially, cephalothin. Ticarcillin and piperacillin were partially hydrolyzed in the microbiological assay. There was no activity against five other cephalosporins or imipenem. Isoelectric focusing of the enzyme showed a pI of 8.8. Tazobactam was the best inhibitor of the enzyme, followed by clavulanic acid, sulbactam, and cefoxitin, while EDTA and p-chloromercuribenzoate had no activity. All beta-lactamase-positive strains became susceptible to amoxicillin and ampicillin with 1 micrograms of clavulanic acid per ml. With the same inhibitor, there was a reduced but significant effect for ticarcillin but no effect for penicillin G or piperacillin. Sulbactam had no effect and tazobactam was effective only at 2 micrograms/ml on amoxicillin and ampicillin. The beta-lactamase of C. jejuni seems to be a penicillinase with a role in resistance for only amoxicillin, ampicillin, and ticarcillin.\r"

Resistance to inorganic Hg2+ ranged from 0% among the unnamed third biovariant complex of Mycobacterium fortuitum to 83% among M. chelonae-like organisms. With cell extracts and 203Hg(NO3)2 as the substrate, mercuric reductase (HgRe) activity was demonstrable in six of eight taxonomic groups. HgRe activity was inducible and required NADPH or NADH and a thiol donor for optimai activity. Species with HgRe activity were also resistant to organomercurial compounds, including phenylmercuric acetate. Attempts at intraspecies and intragenus transfer of HgRe activity by conjugation or transformation were unsuccessful. Mercury resistance is common in rapidly growing mycobacteria and appears to function via the same inducible enzyme systems already defined in other bacterial species. This system offers potential as a strain marker for epidemiologic investigations and for studying genetic systems in rapidly growing mycobacteria.\r"

  ".U": "91307256\r", 
  ".W": "We have previously observed that the antimalarial drug amodiaquine impairs the human polymorphonuclear neutrophil (PMN) oxidative burst in vitro. However, the drug acted at a concentration of 100 micrograms/ml, far higher than that which is achievable therapeutically. Since amodiaquine is extensively metabolized into monodesethyl amodiaquine, we investigated whether the metabolite modified PMN functions at lower concentrations than amodiaquine does. Monodesethyl amodiaquine strongly depressed PMN chemotaxis and phagocytosis at concentrations as low as 10 micrograms/ml. This inhibition was reversed by washing out the drug. The PMN oxidative burst was markedly depressed by monodesethyl amodiaquine, whatever the assay technique (luminol-amplified chemiluminescence, lucigenin-amplified chemiluminescence, myeloperoxidase activity) or stimulus used (opsonized zymosan, phorbol myristate acetate, formylmethionyl leucyl phenylalanine). There were extreme interindividual variations in sensitivity to the depressive effect of monodesethyl amodiaquine when the PMN oxidative burst was assayed in terms of luminol-amplified chemiluminescence or lucigenin-amplified chemiluminescence. PMN samples were divided into two groups on the basis of the MIC of the drug: 60% of the samples were \"highly sensitive,\" being strongly inhibited at concentrations as low as 0.1 micrograms/ml (obtained during therapy), whereas the \"moderately sensitive\" samples were inhibited at concentrations of 10 micrograms/ml and above. The difference between the two groups was highly significant. This PMN sensitivity to the inhibitory effect of the drug was not related to intrinsic oxidative metabolism. Our data indicate that monodesethyl amodiaquine, the main metabolite of amodiaquine, has a far stronger inhibitory effect on various PMN functions in vitro than the parent drug, warranting relevant in vivo studies.\r"

Inoculation of 10(7) CFU of either S. pneumoniae 1629 or S. pneumoniae 7 produced a fatal pneumonia in nontreated mice 2 to 3 days after infection. Oral therapy was commenced 1 h after infection and was continued three times a day for 2 days. The doses used in mice produced peak concentrations in serum and lung tissue similar to those measured in humans. Ciprofloxacin failed to eliminate either strain of pneumococcus from mouse lungs at any of the doses tested (40, 80, or 160 mg/kg of body weight) by the end of therapy (33 h). Mice that received ciprofloxacin at 160 mg/kg were clear of S. pneumoniae 7 5 days later, whereas persistence and regrowth of S. pneumoniae 1629 resulted in the death of 20% of animals treated with ciprofloxacin. Therapy with cefaclor (20 mg/kg) produced an effect similar to that of ciprofloxacin. In contrast, amoxicillin (10 and 20 mg/kg) and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (10/5 and 20/10 mg/kg) were significantly (P less than 0.05) more effective in eliminating both strains of S. pneumoniae from the lungs by the end of therapy and, by 168 h, had prevented mortality in 80 to 100% of treated animals. The efficacy of ciprofloxacin against these experimental pneumococcal respiratory infections was poor, despite good penetration into lung tissue, and is a reflection of the low in vitro activity of the quinolone against S. pneumoniae, one of the most common pathogens in community-acquired pneumonia.\r"

The kinetics in the blisters followed the serum concentration-time curve with a delay but with a similar elimination half-life of 2.4 h. The kinetics in the 40-microliters blisters followed closely the theoretically calculated concentrations of the peripheral compartment of a two-compartment model. In contrast, the concentrations in the 120-microliter blisters increased less rapidly, lower peaks were achieved, and concentrations decreased with a significantly longer delay. A very similar area-specific flow or clearance rate of 1.6 microliters.h-1.mm-2 was calculated for the interface area between the serum compartment and either the small or large blisters. The observed rapid mass transfer between serum and blister fluid suggests similar oscillations of concentrations in serum and in small interstitial fluid compartments.\r"

  ".U": "91307259\r", 
  ".W": "High-level resistance to quinolones has previously been shown to occur in Campylobacter spp. both in vitro and in patients treated with quinolones. We have selected isolates that are resistant to quinolones by plating cells from a susceptible C. jejuni strain, UA535, on medium containing nalidixic acid at 32 micrograms/ml. Fluctuation analysis indicated that resistance occurred by mutation at a frequency of 5 x 10(-8) per cell plated. Unlike what is observed with other gram-negative organisms, the nalidixic acid-resistant mutants demonstrated high-level cross-resistance (MIC, greater than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml) to newer quinolones, including ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, and temafloxacin, yet remained susceptible to coumermycin A1 and several other unrelated antibiotics. Mutants with an identical resistance phenotype could also be selected from UA535 with ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin at a similar frequency. To study the mechanism of quinolone resistance, DNA gyrases were purified from C. jejuni UA535 and two resistant mutants by heparin-agarose and novobiocin-Sepharose chromatography. After the respective enzyme concentrations were adjusted to equivalent units of activity in the DNA supercoiling reaction, the DNA gyrases from the resistant mutants were found to be 100-fold less susceptible than the wild-type enzyme to inhibition by quinolones. Subunit switching experiments with purified A and B subunits from the wild type and one of the quinolone-resistant mutants indicated that an alteration in the A subunit was responsible for resistance. These results show that a single-step mutation can occur in vitro in the gene encoding DNA gyrase in C. jejuni, producing clinically relevant levels of resistance to the newer quinolones.\r"

This assay is sensitive in the clinically relevant range (2 to 40 micrograms/ml) and analyzes plasma, serum, and cerebrospinal fluid specimens; bioassay results correlate with results obtained by high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). Bioassay and HPLC analyses of spiked plasma, serum, and cerebrospinal fluid samples (run as unknowns) gave good agreement with expected values. Analysis of specimens from patients gave equivalent results by both HPLC and bioassay. HPLC had a lower within-run coefficient of variation (less than 2.5% for HPLC versus less than 11% for bioassay) and a lower between-run coefficient of variation (less than 5% versus less than 12% for bioassay) and was more sensitive (lower limit of detection, 0.1 micrograms/ml [versus 2 micrograms/ml for bioassay]). The bioassay is, however, sufficiently accurate and sensitive for clinical specimens, and its relative simplicity, low sample volume requirement, and low equipment cost should make it the technique of choice for analysis of routine clinical specimens.\r"

  ".W": "Seven 6-alkoxypurine arabinosides were synthesized and evaluated for in vitro activity against varicella-zoster virus (VZV). The simplest of the series, 6-methoxypurine arabinoside (ara-M), was the most potent, with 50% inhibitory concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 3 microM against eight strains of VZV. This activity was selective. The ability of ara-M to inhibit the growth of a variety of human cell lines was at least 30-fold less (50% effective concentration, greater than 100 microM) than its ability to inhibit the virus. Enzyme studies suggested the molecular basis for these results. Of the seven 6-alkoxypurine arabinosides, ara-M was the most efficient substrate for VZV-encoded thymidine kinase as well as the most potent antiviral agent. In contrast, it was not detectably phosphorylated by any of the three major mammalian nucleoside kinases. Upon direct comparison, ara-M was appreciably more potent against VZV than either acyclovir or adenine arabinoside (ara-A). However, in the presence of an adenosine deaminase inhibitor, the arabinosides of adenine and 6-methoxypurine were equipotent but not equally selective; the adenine congener had a much less favorable in vitro chemotherapeutic index. Again, this result correlated with data from enzyme studies in that ara-A, unlike ara-M, was a substrate for two mammalian nucleoside kinases. Unlike acyclovir and ara-A, ara-M had no appreciable activity against other viruses of the herpes group. The potency and selectivity of ara-M as an anti-VZV agent in vitro justify its further study.\r"

Among the inhibited strains, several were resistant to the tested beta-lactam antibiotics or to aminoglycosides. The activity of sparfloxacin was not influenced by the medium that was used; lowering of the pH to 5 had a marked effect on the MICs for two strains each of Enterobacter cloacae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and one strain each of Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus; the MBC of sparfloxacin was within 1 to 2 dilution steps of the MIC for the strains that were tested.\r"

Viable cell counts were performed by standard procedures after 1, 6, and 24 h of contact with the antibiotic at different concentrations. A bactericidal effect (99.9% killing) was observed against sessile bacteria after 24 h with concentrations of only 10, 1, and 0.1 mg/liter, while against planktonic bacteria it was also noted at concentrations of 0.01 and 0.001 mg/liter, and the effect was observed after 6 h with the three highest concentrations. When the results for five strains were studied by analysis of variance at 6 and 24 h, the main variable was the antibiotic concentration, followed by the culture conditions, e.g., planktonic or sessile bacteria, the strain tested, and the time of contact. A decreased pH of 5.4 did not affect the action of amoxicillin. The bactericidal effect of the combination of amoxicillin and metronidazole was additive against sessile H. pylori.\r"

The use of monotherapy with intravenous ciprofloxacin (200 to 300 mg every 12 h) was evaluated against combined therapy with piperacillin plus amikacin in febrile granulocytopenic patients with solid tumor or lymphoma. The study was discontinued prematurely because patients treated with ciprofloxacin had a significantly lower overall success rate than patients treated with piperacillin plus amikacin (31 of 48 patients [65%] versus 48 of 53 patients [91%], P = 0.002). Patients with gram-positive coccal bacteremia had a particularly poor outcome: therapy failed for six of eight patients (75%) treated with ciprofloxacin, while therapy failed for none of four patients treated with piperacillin plus amikacin. Death from primary infection during initially randomized protocol therapy occurred in 7 of 48 patients (14.5%) treated with ciprofloxacin and in 3 of 53 (6%) treated with piperacillin plus amikacin.

Freshly obtained guinea pig and rat antigen-specific lymphocytes were compared with rat T-lymphocyte cell lines cultured for a long period of time. Incorporation of AMB into multilayered vesicles significantly reduced its effect relative to that of Fungizone on cultured T-cell lines, as reported by others for mammalian cells. In contrast, the effects on freshly obtained antigen-specific lymphocytes were different. Fungizone inhibited proliferation of antigen-specific lymph node cells freshly obtained from immunized guinea pigs at fungicidal concentrations, and incorporation into multilayered lipid vesicles did not have much of a protective effect. Higher concentrations of Fungizone were required to inhibit proliferation of fresh rat lymph node cells, but incorporation into multilayered lipid vesicles still did not have much of a protective effect. Some T lymphocytes in the peripheral circulation of guinea pigs and in the lymph nodes of rats were more resistant to liposomal AMB than another more sensitive T-lymphocyte population was. Proliferation of lymphocytes in response to mitogens was inhibited less than that in response to specific antigen was. Thus, sensitivity to AMB depended on the species, the strength of the stimulus used to activate the lymphocytes, and on some other property of the lymphocytes, possibly their state of differentiation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

These strains were relatively resistant to benzylpenicillin, amoxicillin, and ampicillin (MICs, greater than or equal to 64 micrograms/ml); susceptible to amoxicillin-clavulanate (2:1) (MICs, less than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml); and moderately susceptible to cephalothin and cephaloridine (MICs, 0.12 to 16 micrograms/ml). The addition of 1 microgram of potassium clavulanate, a beta-lactamase inhibitor, per ml resulted in a significant increase in the susceptibilities of these strains to penicillins but not to cephalosporins. Potassium clavulanate had no effect on non-beta-lactamase-producing strains. Enzyme production was constitutive since activity was not increased when cells were cultivated in the presence of benzylpenicillin. Enzyme activity was strongly inhibited by potassium clavulanate, sulbactam, and iodine; weakly inhibited by cloxacillin, imipenem, and moxalactam; but not inhibited by aztreonam, EDTA, or p-chloromercuribenzoate. By gel infiltration, the enzyme had an estimated molecular mass of 29 kDa. Isoelectric focusing of the partially purified enzyme gave a major beta-lactamase band at pH 5.50 and a minor band at pH 5.60. Plasmids were not detected in any of the 11 beta-lactamase-positive strains. This enzyme is considered to belong to class 2a of the Bush classification scheme.\r"

One mutant, designated MP051, was selected for further study. Quinolone MICs for MP051 were 4- to 16-fold higher than those for MP050; nonquinolone MICs were unchanged. The DNA gyrase isolated from MP051 was 24-fold less sensitive to inhibition of supercoiling by ciprofloxacin than the DNA gyrase isolated from MP050 was. Inhibition studies on reconstituted combinations of heterologous gyrase subunits showed that the decreased inhibition was dependent on the A subunit of DNA gyrase from MP051. Further evidence that this decreased inhibition was due to a gyrA mutation was provided by analysis of Escherichia coli gyrA gene expression in S. marcescens heterodiploids containing pNJR3-2, a broad-host-range gyrA gene probe. Quinolone susceptibilities of MP051 heterodiploids containing the wild-type E. coli gyrA gene decreased to those of MP050, while quinolone susceptibilities of MP050 containing the same plasmid were unchanged. These results indicate that spontaneous quinolone resistance in MP051 was due to a mutation in gyrA.\r"

  ".W": "The utility of spiramycin for preventing transplacental transmission of toxoplasmosis and the efficacy of conventional macrolides against Toxoplasma gondii are subjects of active debate. An in vitro microassay was developed to determine the relative inhibitory activity against T. gondii of 24 conventional macrolides derived from erythromycin and tylosin (14- and 16-membered macrolides, respectively). Macrolides and T. gondii RH tachyzoites were added to monolayers of BT cells grown in 96-well plates. Plates were incubated for 20 h at 37 degrees C, and the growth of T. gondii was then measured by the selective incorporation of [3H]uracil in trichloroacetic acid-precipitable material during an additional incubation of 20 h. Dose-response curves and 50 and 90% inhibitory concentrations (IC50 and IC90, respectively) were determined for each drug. Microscopic examination was performed on stained replicates of the infected monolayers, and the relative toxicities of the drugs for host cells were determined. Spiramycin and tylosin showed only limited activity against T. gondii (IC50 of 20.16 and 20.00 micrograms/ml, respectively). Erythromycin and azithromycin had a better anti-Toxoplasma activity with IC50 of 14.38 and 8.61 micrograms/ml, respectively, whereas drugs like desmycosin, dirithromycin, and roxithromycin had no detectable activity. Although many macrolides inhibited intracellular proliferation of T. gondii, azithromycin was the only macrolide demonstrating prolonged inhibitory activity on the replication of intracellular tachyzoites. We conclude that conventional 14- and 16-membered macrolides often interfere with the growth of, but may not kill, T. gondii RH tachyzoites in vitro.\r"

These modifications produced compounds with in vitro activities which were generally similar to that of erythromycin.

Potent GR69153 activity was also demonstrated against Moraxella catarrhalis, pneumococci, beta-hemolytic streptococci, gram-positive anaerobes, and most species of coagulase-negative staphylococci. The activity of GR69153 was generally two- to fourfold greater than that of ceftazidime. Resistance level GR69153 MICs for 90% of strains tested (greater than or equal to 32 micrograms/ml) were found most often among Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter spp. and Morganella morganii strains. GR69153 did not significantly inhibit enterococci, Xanthomonas maltophilia, the Bacteroides fragilis group, Corynebacterium jeikeium, or Listeria monocytogenes. GR69153 was bactericidal and was generally beta-lactamase stable, and MICs were only slightly increased by high inoculum concentrations. Activity was enhanced in an iron-deficient medium, and a modest MIC difference attributed to iron availability was noted between standard agar and broth test results. GR69153 was confirmed to be a potent, catechol-substituted cephalosporin with a spectrum slightly wider than that of ceftazidime, but it was less active than cefpirome or imipenem against some gram-positive pathogens and anaerobes.\r"

  ".W": "The incidence of cytomegalovirus disease, the most important infectious complication of renal transplantation, was reduced in renal allograft recipients by a regimen of prophylactic high-dose oral acyclovir. To analyze the pharmacologic aspects of our prophylactic approach, we evaluated safety, pharmacodynamics, and in vitro susceptibility data. One hundred four recipients of cadaveric renal allografts received either oral acyclovir (n = 53) in doses of up to 3,200 mg/day or a placebo (n = 51) for 12 weeks posttransplant. Leukocyte count and serum creatinine were selected as markers of laboratory safety and were evaluated pretransplant, at study midpoint (creatinine only), and at study completion. Concentrations of acyclovir in plasma were determined to verify the ability of the dosing strategy to achieve predicted values. Viral resistance was assessed by calculation of in vitro 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50s) of acyclovir for the cytomegalovirus strains collected from the subjects. Our results showed no difference in leukocyte count or serum creatinine between the acyclovir and placebo recipients. Plasma acyclovir concentrations were maintained within the expected limits and did not differ between patients who developed cytomegalovirus disease and those who did not. The mean acyclovir IC50s for cytomegalovirus isolates were 42.6 mumol/liter in the acyclovir recipients and 48 mumol/liter in the placebo recipients. We conclude that the clinical benefit of high-dose oral acyclovir therapy occurred despite plasma drug concentrations below the mean IC50 for the patient viral isolates. Furthermore, the use of the regimen did not produce leukopenia, adversely affect renal function, or alter the susceptibility of cytomegalovirus strains to acyclovir. This approach and dose adjustment scheme may be appropriate for other immunocompromised patients at risk for cytomegalovirus infection and disease.\r"

  ".W": "We retrospectively analyzed amikacin pharmacokinetics in 28 patients (mean age, 47.4 +/- 13.6 years) who received high-dose chemotherapy during a neutropenic febrile episode. Patients received an experimental protocol of high-dose anticancer chemotherapy. Amikacin pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated from two or more concentrations in serum around a single dose by the method of Sawchuck and Zaske (J. Pharmacokinet. Biopharm. 4:183-195, 1976). Predicted parameters were calculated by using standard methods. The observed amikacin volume of distribution and clearance were significantly greater and the elimination half-life was longer than predicted (0.38 +/- 0.13 versus 0.25 liter/kg [P = 0.0001], 1.51 +/- 0.92 versus 1.17 +/- 0.38 liters/h/kg [P = 0.012], and 3.8 +/- 2.4 versus 2.9 +/- 1.1 h [P = 0.011], respectively). Multivariate analysis revealed that albumin correlated negatively and creatinine correlated positively with the volume of distribution and the elimination half-life. Creatinine and the percentage below the ideal body weight correlated negatively and hematocrit correlated positively with clearance. Administration of dosage regimens based on predicted pharmacokinetic parameters yielded subtherapeutic amikacin concentrations in serum in our patients. Because of the increased dosage requirements and the need for adequate antibiotic treatment in this population, we suggest guidelines for empiric dosing for patients with advanced cancer receiving intensive chemotherapy.\r"

  ".W": "The Nine Mile, S Q217, and Priscilla isolates, representative of the three major genetic groups of Coxiella burnetii, are known to differ in their susceptibilities to antibiotics. Mechanisms potentially responsible for these differences were investigated. Accumulation of antibiotics by infected L929 cells and purified isolates was measured. In addition, C. burnetii plasmid-transformed Escherichia coli HB101 cells were used to study the possibility that different C. burnetii plasmids are responsible for disparate antibiotic susceptibilities of the isolates. L929 cells recently or persistently infected with the Priscilla isolate exhibited a significantly reduced accumulation of [3H]tetracycline as compared with that in L929 cells infected with either the Nine Mile or S Q217 isolates; accumulation of this drug was greater in cells recently infected each isolate. In contrast, L929 cells recently or persistently infected with the different isolates accumulated [3H]norfloxacin to an equivalent extent. [3H]tetracycline accumulation was approximately the same among the purified isolates. However, as measured by both scintillation and spectrofluorometry, norfloxacin accumulation was significantly diminished in the purified Priscilla isolate. pH had no apparent effect upon isolate permeabilities. The presence of C. burnetii QpH1 or QpRS plasmids did not alter the antibiotic susceptibility of E. coli. Collectively, these results indicate that differential susceptibilities to tetracyclines or fluoroquinolones in C. burnetii isolates may be the result of distinct mechanisms involving altered host-cell (tetracyclines) or isolate-specific (fluoroquinolones) permeabilities.\r"

Ninety-two were evaluable (46 in each group). Middle ear fluid samples obtained for culture before therapy grew Haemophilus spp. in 30% of cases, pneumococci in 29% of cases, and Moraxella catarrhalis in 15% of cases. beta-Lactamase-producing bacteria were found in 37% of patients. Clinical failure occurred in four loracarbef-treated patients and one amoxicillin-clavulanate-treated patient (P = 0.361). Recurrence of acute otitis media was more common in the 2 to 3 weeks after loracarbef treatment (eight patients) than it was after amoxicillin-clavulanate therapy (three patients), but not significantly so (P = 0.197). Thus, combined failure and recurrence occurred in 12 loracarbef-treated patients and four amoxicillin-clavulanate-treated patients (P = 0.052). Gastrointestinal side effects occurred in 13 loracarbef-treated and 21 amoxicillin-clavulanate-treated patients (P = 0.13). Diaper rash was more common with amoxicillin-clavulanate (22 patients) than with loracarbef (10 patients; P = 0.016). Satisfactory results were achieved with both antibiotics, and adverse effects, although common, were minor.\r"

Three groups of patients received imipenem-cilastatin (500/500 mg) intramuscularly every 12 h: group I consisted of eight patients with a creatinine clearance (CLCR) of greater than 50 ml/min (range, 51 to 84 ml/min; mean, 65.8 ml/min); group II consisted of three patients with a CLCR of 20 to 50 ml/min; and group III consisted of two patients with a CLCR of less than 20 ml/min. Imipenem and cilastatin concentrations were measured at steady state on day 5. Mean peak and trough plasma imipenem concentrations were 5.28 +/- 1.78 and 1.43 +/- 0.76 micrograms/ml in group I, 6.25 +/- 0.78 and 2.50 +/- 0.00 micrograms/ml in group II, and 14.3 +/- 0.71 and 6.85 +/- 1.06 micrograms/ml in group III, respectively.

The estimated fractions of a parenteral dose that were excreted into the gastrointestinal tract were 0.37 for cefoperazone, 0.11 for ceftriaxone, 0.03 for ceftazidime, and 0.002 for cefepime. All four cephalosporins significantly decreased the number of aerobic gram-negative rods in the feces, and virtually all gram-negative rods were eliminated at high doses of cefoperazone, ceftazidime, and ceftriaxone. Furthermore, at high doses these three compounds led to a significant increase of the outgrowth of resistant Citrobacter freundii. The outgrowth of Candida albicans was increased at high doses of cefoperazone and ceftriaxone, whereas ceftazidime and cefepime did not have this effect. The most profound changes in the gastrointestinal ecology were observed during treatment with high doses of cefoperazone. The results suggest that the colonization resistance of the gastrointestinal tract can be substantially decreased by parenteral treatment with cefoperazone and, to a lesser extent, with ceftriaxone and ceftazidime.\r"

Six of eight patients presenting with symptoms suggesting duodenal disease had invasive cancer. Four of these six patients died after surviving a mean of 13 months after diagnosis. In contrast, none of the six patients diagnosed after screening with upper gastrointestinal endoscopy has had invasive carcinoma. Early diagnosis and long-term surveillance of asymptomatic patients with familial adenomatous polyposis affords the opportunity to diagnose and treat duodenal tumors at an early stage, thereby, avoiding the dismal prognosis once invasive cancer has developed.\r"

We evaluated the safety and efficacy of extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy (ESWL) in 16 patients with complicated biliary stones treated prospectively over a 24-month period. Successful stone fragmentation was achieved in 15 patients (94%) using a Dornier HM3 lithotripter (average of 2290 shocks at 22 kV). Three patients (19%) required a second ESWL treatment. Biliary clearance of stone fragments was spontaneous in seven (43%) of the patients and required additional treatment in eight (57%) of the patients. Complications from ESWL were minor and included transient hematuria and ecchymoses at the skin entry site. Extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy failed in one patient (6%) with a biliary stricture and surgery was required. At hospital discharge, all patients were asymptomatic and stone free. Treatment with ESWL appears to be a safe and effective adjunct for selected patients with complex biliary stone disease.\r"

  ".W": "To evaluate the efficacy of a selective approach to biliary pancreatitis, we reviewed the outcomes in 276 consecutive patients undergoing operations for this diagnosis during a 7-year period. Initial conservative therapy resulted in elective operations in 63% and urgent operations in 37%. Only 10 patients (3.6%) required primary pancreatic operations, 50% of them as emergencies. The proportion of common duct surgical explorations fell from 70% of those operated immediately after hospital admission to 20% by the third hospital day. Overall mortality was 1.8% but was increased to 30% in patients having an initial pancreatic operation. We conclude that a selective approach to biliary pancreatitis allows the operation to be performed electively in most patients and is associated with a low mortality and an acceptable length of stay. Most common duct stones pass spontaneously permitting cholecystectomy alone.\r"

This report concerns 110 children (mean age, 6.2 years; range, 6 months to 14 years) with Henoch-Schonlein purpura. Seventy-two (65%) had abdominal pain associated with nausea and vomiting, bloody stool, and upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Sixty patients with abdominal pain were evaluated and treated conservatively. However, 12 patients underwent laparotomy. Six underwent unnecessary appendectomy for wrongly diagnosed appendicitis. Bowel resection was performed in one patient for an obstructive ileal lesion. Six additional patients had intussusception; surgery was required in three, while barium enema reduction was successfully accomplished in three others. Massive gastric hemorrhage required ligation, vagotomy, and pyloroplasty in two instances. One child with severe scrotal pain, hemorrhage, and swelling underwent unnecessary scrotal exploration. Four additional patients with similar symptoms avoided operation after a testicular scintiscan demonstrated good blood flow. A high index of suspicion and early diagnosis of Henoch-Schonlein purpura based on clinical, roentgenographic, and laboratory findings may avoid unnecessary operations in most cases. However, life-threatening complications (hemorrhage, obstruction, and intussusception) may occur and require operative intervention. All of the patients survived.\r"

Forty immunocompromised patients and 169 nonimmunocompromised patients with acute diverticulitis were identified. Free perforation into the peritoneal cavity occurred in 43% (17/40) of immunocompromised patients and 14% (24/169) of nonimmunocompromised patients. Operations were performed in 58% (23/40) of immunocompromised patients and 33% (55/169) of nonimmunocompromised patients. Postoperative morbidity was 65% (15/23) in immunocompromised patients and 24% (13/55) in nonimmunocompromised patients; postoperative mortality was 39% (9/23) and 2% (1/55), respectively. We conclude that acute diverticulitis in the immunocompromised patient is a complicated problem; there is a greater risk of free perforation and need for surgery than in the nonimmunocompromised patient. Furthermore, the prognosis for immunocompromised patients who undergo surgery is worse than that for nonimmunocompromised patients.\r"

Fifty-eight (48%) of the procedures were performed on patients who fulfilled the criteria for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. The patients were predominantly male (94%). Single risk factors included homosexuality (73% of cases), intravenous drug abuse (8%), and previous blood transfusions (8%). Four patients (5%) had multiple risk factors; risk factors were denied by seven patients (8%). The mean age at surgery was 41.6 years (range, 22 to 67 years). Surgical conditions that rarely affect the population without the human immunodeficiency virus presented diagnostic challenges. Altered physiologic responses to even routine conditions were observed. Thirty-day morbidity rates for emergency (group A) and elective (group B) procedures were 19% and 9%, respectively. This included seven surgical deaths (13%) in group A and one in group B (2%). Patients undergoing 92 of 112 procedures (82%) not associated with surgical mortality were followed up. Patients who were dead at follow-up had mean procedure-survivals of 19 weeks (group A) and 21 weeks (group B) for 33 procedures. Those who remained alive had a mean procedure-survival of 86 weeks for 59 procedures. No single prognosticator could be correlated with outcome, although the combination of hypoalbuminemia with a history of opportunistic infection(s) was associated with short survival. Emergency and elective procedures can be performed in the patient with human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome with acceptable morbidity and mortality. Procedures are indicated to extend patient life or to improve quality of life.\r"

Treatment methods included resection and in situ replacement grafting in seven patients, resection and extra-anatomic bypass in five patients, and resection-ligation in one patient.

Overall, good results were achieved in five patients (38%), while poor results were noted in the remaining eight patients (62%). The determinants of outcome were aneurysm location or rupture, the presence of established infection, and the virulence of the infecting organism. In 10 (77%) of the 13 aneurysms, Salmonella species, Bacteroides fragilis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa accounted for all deaths, ruptures, and suprarenal aneurysm infections. These data suggest that patients with primary infections of the abdominal aorta or iliac arteries continue to present with advanced infections or aneurysm rupture that result in a high mortality.\r"

  ".W": "Dipyridamole thallium scanning was routinely performed on 68 consecutive patients who presented for elective aortic surgery. All 68 patients were judged by clinical assessment to be at low risk for perioperative cardiac complications. In addition, 42 of 68 patients had a history of myocardial infarction, stable angina, or abnormal echocardiographic findings (group 1). Twenty-six of 68 patients did not have a history of myocardial infarction, angina, or abnormal echocardiographic findings (group 2). In group 1, 34 of 4 patients had positive results on dipyridamole thallium scanning, and 15 of these patients were found to have critical coronary artery disease on subsequent cardiac catheterization; nine underwent immediate coronary artery bypass grafting, and six had their coronary artery disease treated medically and their vascular operations cancelled. The remaining 27 patients in group 1 underwent elective operations, with six (22%) of 27 sustaining postoperative cardiac complications. None of the group 2 patients was found to have critical coronary artery disease. All patients in group 2 underwent aortic operation without cardiac complication. Routine dipyridamole thallium scanning detected a 22% (15 of 68) incidence of critical coronary artery disease overall. There was a 36% (15 of 42) incidence of critical coronary artery disease in group 1 patients vs 0% in group 2 patients (95% confidence interval, 21% to 50%). We conclude that the use of dipyridamole thallium scanning in low-risk patients for cardiac screening prior to elective aortic operations is beneficial in selected patients who have a history of myocardial infarction, angina, or abnormal echocardiographic findings, but is not necessary in patients with no history of coronary artery disease.\r"

We retrospectively investigated the value of preoperative irradiation in preventing pancreatic fistula formation. Of 76 consecutive patients who underwent pancreaticojejunostomy by mucosa-to-mucosa anastomosis with a stent catheter after pancreatoduodenectomy, 22 had received preoperative irradiation. The irradiation field included the anastomotic site. In two patients, accidental dislocation of the stent catheter was the apparent cause of fistula formation, but the other 21 patients in the irradiated group developed no fistula. In contrast, nine (17%) of 53 patients in the nonirradiated group developed fistulas. In the irradiated group, preoperative selenomethionine Se 75 scintigraphy revealed a cold area corresponding to the pancreas body, which was included in the irradiation field. Thus, a putative decrease in exocrine function at the pancreatic anastomotic site could explain why fistula formation was prevented by preoperative irradiation.\r"

Within 1 hour, the serum concentrations after topical administration equaled the serum concentrations after intravenous administration, and the concentration time curves declined in parallel.

Because they often present either as unexplained, asymptomatic masses or with vague constitutional symptoms, splenic inflammatory pseudotumors can raise suspicion for a primary splenic neoplasm, such as lymphoma. Splenectomy is the treatment of choice.\r"

We reviewed seven cases that demonstrated the diagnostic difficulties and therapeutic options available in the management of hepatobiliary PAN. No consistent sign that indicated the severity of hepatobiliary PAN could be identified. In cases of thrombotic PAN, acalculus cholecystitis usually could be diagnosed preoperatively. Early tissue diagnosis and aggressive intervention are required for appropriate patient treatment. If the diagnosis is unclear, a preoperative muscle or skin biopsy specimen is often helpful in establishing a tissue diagnosis of PAN, even if no obvious pathologic condition is evident. Patients who undergo celiotomy for acalculus cholecystitis or peritoneal signs of an unclear origin should have tissue specimens (gallbladder wall, liver, or omentum) submitted for pathologic study. Angiography may be diagnostic preoperatively or when results of biopsies are equivocal. In addition, early angiography can define the extent of visceral involvement and permit control by embolization of hemorrhage secondary to aneurysm rupture. Awareness of the possibilities of thrombotic, ischemic, or bleeding complications from PAN allows more aggressive and rapid management of abdominal complaints, especially in patients who are receiving immunosuppressant therapy.\r"

Ethanol (50-200 mM) had no significant effect on the specific bindings of [3H]muscimol to GABAA receptor and [3H]flunitrazepam to benzodiazepine receptor in cerebral particulate preparations. However, ethanol induced an inhibition of [3H]TBOB binding to Cl- channel and a suppression of flunitrazepam-induced enhancement of [3H]muscimol binding and of salsolinol-induced accentuation of [3H]flunitrazepam binding to cerebral particulate fraction. In contrast, ethanol facilitated GABA-dependent 36Cl- influx but eliminated the stimulatory effects of flunitrazepam and salsolinol on GABA-dependent 36Cl- influx into cerebral membrane vesicles. These results suggest that ethanol may facilitate the function of GABA-gated chloride channel in spite of inducing deteriorations of antagonist binding capacity of chloride channel as well as of the functional coupling between GABAA receptor and benzodiazepine receptor in the brain.\r"

The catecholamine content of the ethanol-treated cells was increased after 6 days of ethanol treatment, compared to control cells and there was a slight reduction in protein and DNA content. An enhanced spontaneous release of catecholamines was seen, which was Ca(2+)-dependent and was inhibited by cadmium but not by the organic dihydropyridine Ca2+ antagonist nitrendipine. The fraction of catecholamines released by K+ was also enhanced in ethanol-treated preparations, particularly at high K+ or Ca2+ concentrations. Release induced by K+ was sensitive to inhibition by both cadmium and organic dihydropyridine Ca2+ antagonists. The results show many similarities with changes observed in catecholaminergic transmission in rat brain during the development of ethanol physical dependence.\r"

Cells grown in ethanol showed greater spontaneous release of catecholamines, but both carbachol and veratrine evoked release of a smaller maximum fraction of stored catecholamines than that from control cells. Spontaneous catecholamine release as well as that induced by veratrine were sensitive to inhibition by tetrodotoxin. Catecholamine release induced by veratrine could be prevented almost completely by the Ca2+ channel blocker cadmium, but not to any great extent by the organic dihydropyridine Ca2+ antagonist nitrendipine. Carbachol-induced catecholamine release was similarly resistant to inhibition by nitrendipine, but was inhibited by cadmium. The results suggest that cell cultures grown in ethanol-containing medium show many alterations in the characteristics of catecholamine release. Alterations in receptor- and voltage-operated ion channels in the membrane of ethanol-treated cells may underlie these changes.\r"

  ".W": "(1) We examined the possibility that enhanced fragility of the bony skeleton in alcohol abusers may be a consequence of a reduction in collagen composition. Male rats were fed a liquid diet containing 36% of total calories as ethanol; controls were pair-fed iso-caloric glucose. At 3, 7 and 14 days of treatment, collagen contents of tibia were unaltered, but small and significant reductions (15-30%) were observed at 28 and 42 days of treatment. Urinary hydroxyproline excretion was increased by 40-60% at 42 days of treatment, suggesting enhanced collagen degradation. (2) Bones of rats treated with ethanol for 42 days had significantly reduced mineral content (approximately 20%) with accompanying reductions in phosphate, calcium, copper and magnesium, but not sodium or potassium. Water content was unaltered, but tibial zinc and iron were increased by approximately 15%. (3) Histomorphometric analysis of bones taken at 42 days showed significant reductions in cortical bone thickness of lower tibia (by 28%). The thickness of the upper cortices and cancellous bone of the tibia was unaffected. Reductions in trabecular bone volume (approx. 25%) did not achieve statistical significance. (4) These observations are consistent with the known enhanced fragility of bones in alcoholic rats. The regional susceptibility of the tibia may be related to reduced load bearing as a result of muscle atrophy.\r"

The mean rate of alcohol metabolism increased by 80% after fructose but there was considerable variation among the subjects, which was related to their plasma fructose concentrations. Blood lactate increased after fructose to a greater degree than blood pyruvate, resulting in a significant increase in [lactate]/[pyruvate] ratio. Since fructose increased the [lactate]/[pyruvate] ratio when it increased alcohol metabolism, the action of fructose cannot be explained by a decrease in the liver cytoplasmic [NADH]/[NAD] ratio and some other mechanism must be sought.\r"

Beer (56%) was the preferred drink, followed by gin (22.4%) and wine (21.3%). The age of starting to drink was close to 16 years old and the alcohol intake per capita was 19 g/day. Both frequency and intake were higher among males and at weekends. The main reported reason for drinking was 'because I like its taste' (39.1%).

  ".W": "Since angiotensin II (AII) is the effector molecule of the renin angiotensin system, the most direct approach to interfere with this system would be to antagonize AII at the level of its receptor. AII receptor antagonists would represent an ideal species, for regardless of how and where AII is produced, its function could be specifically turned off. However, the AII receptor antagonists currently available have been limited to AII-like peptides and their usefulness as therapeutics and pharmacologic tools has been hampered by their lack of oral bioavailability, metabolic instability, and partial agonistic activity. A detailed pharmacologic characterization of some simple N-benzylimidazoles, originally described by Takeda Chemical Industries (Osaka, Japan), identified this class of compound as very weak but selective AII receptor antagonists with a competitive mode of action. Encouraged by the quality of these lead compounds, we embarked on a synthetic program aimed at designing more potent and orally effective antagonists, while preserving their selectivity for the AII receptor. Our efforts have culminated in the discovery of DuP 753, 2-n-butyl-4-chloro-5-hydroxymethyl-1-[2'-(1H-tetrazol-5-yl)biph eny l-4-yl) methyl]imidazole, potassium salt, a potent, nonpeptide AII receptor antagonist.\r"

In rat adrenal cortical microsomes and cultured aortic smooth muscle cells DuP 753 inhibited the specific binding of [125I]AII in a concentration-dependent manner yielding IC50 values of 1.7 and 2.0 x 10(-8) mol/L, respectively. In contrast, DuP 753 had no appreciable affinity for other receptor systems as well as for Ca2+ channels. Functional antagonism was demonstrated by its blockade of AII-induced 45Ca2+ efflux in rat smooth muscle cells. The AII-induced contraction of rabbit aortic strips was competitively antagonized by DuP 753 resulting in a pA2 value of 8.48. Responses induced by other agonists, such as norepinephrine and KCl, were not altered. No partial agonistic effect was noted in any of the in vitro assays. In addition, DuP 753 (10(-5) mol/L) had no effect on rabbit lung converting enzyme or rat/human renin activity. These data demonstrate that DuP 753 is a highly potent and specific AII receptor antagonist. DuP 753 represents a useful experimental tool for dissecting the role of the renin-angiotensin system.\r"

In the pithed rat, DuP 753 exerted a selective and competitive inhibition of the pressor response to angiotensin II (AII). In conscious normotensive rats, DuP 753 inhibited the AII-induced aldosterone secretion and drinking response. DuP 753 lowered blood pressure in conscious normotensive rats pretreated with furosemide but not in untreated normotensive rats. Unlike saralasin, DuP 753 given intravenously did not cause pressor response. In conscious renal hypertensive rats (RHRs), a high renin model, DuP 753 decreased blood pressure with an intravenous ED30 of 0.78 mg/kg and an oral ED30 of 0.59 mg/kg. The antihypertensive efficacy of DuP 753 in RHRs was similar to that of captopril. In DOCA hypertensive rats, a low renin model, DuP 753 did not lower blood pressure. In conscious 18- to 21-week-old spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs), DuP 753 given orally or intravenously reduced blood pressure dose-dependently and did not alter heart rate at these doses. The acute antihypertensive efficacy of DuP 753 was greater than that of captopril in SHRs. In contrast, DuP 753 and captopril given orally at 10 mg/kg/day for 15 days in SHRs caused a similar decrease in blood pressure. Bilateral nephrectomy but not inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis abolished the antihypertensive effect of DuP 753 in SHRs. Our study, therefore, indicates that DuP 753 is an orally active, nonpeptide, selective, and competitive AII receptor antagonist lacking agonism. It appears that there is a relationship between basal renin level and the acute antihypertensive effect of DuP 753 in rats. Further, our results suggest that the renin-angiotensin system plays a significant role in the control of blood pressure in conscious SHRs.\r"

  ".W": "The possibility of receptor heterogeneity in the angiotensin II (AII) system has been suggested previously, based on differences in Kd values or sensitivity to thiol reagents. One of our earliest indications was the frequent observation of incomplete inhibition of the binding of AII to adrenal cortical membranes. Autoradiographic studies demonstrated that all of the labeling of the rat adrenal was blocked by unlabeled AII or saralasin, but not by DuP 753. The predominant receptor in the rat adrenal cortex (80%) is sensitive to dithiothreitol (DTT) and DuP 753, and is designated AII-1. The residual sites in the adrenal cortex and almost all of the sites in the rat adrenal medulla are insensitive to both DTT and DuP 753, but were blocked by EXP655. These sites have been confirmed by ligand binding studies and are designated AII-2. The rabbit adrenal cortex is unique in yielding a nonuniform distribution of AII-2 sites around the outer layer of glomerulosa cells. In the rabbit kidney, the sites on the glomeruli are AII-1, but the sites on the kidney capsule are AII-2. Angiotensin III appears to have a higher affinity for AII-2 sites since it inhibits the binding to the rabbit kidney capsule but not the glomeruli. Elucidation of the distribution and function of these diverse sites should permit the development of more selective and specific therapeutic strategies.\r"

In addition, we determined binding of DuP 753 in cultured glomerular mesangial cells and renomedullary interstitial cells. In the isolated kidney, DuP 753 fully displaced AII from its specific binding sites with high affinity (IC50 = 200 nmol/L) and antagonized the vasoconstrictive effect of AII in a dose-related manner with an ED50 of 170 nmol/L. These effects of DuP 753 were qualitatively similar to those of saralasin and the antagonist effect of DuP 753 on AII-induced renal vasoconstriction was fully overcome by excess AII. DuP 753 had no effect on its own on renal vascular resistance. In cultured glomerular mesangial cells and renomedullary interstitial cells, DuP 753 fully inhibited the specific binding of [125I]-Sar-AII at 1 mumol/L with IC50s of 6.7 and 11 nmol/L for glomerular mesangial cells and renomedullary interstitial cells, respectively. The present results demonstrate that a novel imidazole derivative, DuP 753, is a powerful non-peptide antagonist of angiotensin II receptors in isolated perfused rat kidney and in cultured glomerular mesangial and renomedullary interstitial cells.\r"

Unilateral hydronephrosis was induced to facilitate direct visualization of renal microvessels. Hydronephrotic kidneys were perfused in vitro and microvessel diameters were measured by automated computer-assisted image processing. The administration of 0.3 nmol/L ANG II decreased afferent arteriolar (AA) and efferent arteriolar (EA) diameters by 34 +/- 3% (from 17.9 +/- 0.6 to 11.9 +/- 0.6 microns, P less than .001, n = 11) and 28 +/- 3% (from 17.1 +/- 1.3 to 12.3 +/- 1.3 microns, P less than .001, n = 11), respectively. The subsequent administration of 0.1, 1.0, and 10 mumols/L DuP 753 reversed ANG II-induced vasoconstriction of the AA by 39 +/- 10%, 81 +/- 8%, and 103 +/- 9%, and of the EA by 22 +/- 7%, 51 +/- 6%, and 87 +/- 13%, respectively. These observations indicate that DuP 753 completely blocks both the renal afferent and efferent arteriolar actions of ANG II. In light of the pathogenetic role of ANG II in mediating the deranged renal hemodynamics associated with hypertension, congestive heart failure, and some forms of renal insufficiency, our findings provide a theoretical framework for future studies assessing the potential therapeutic applicability of DuP 753 in reversing ANG II-mediated renal vasoconstriction.\r"

During in vivo microperfusion in the Munich-Wistar rat, a maximally effective dose of DuP 753 (10 mg/kg, intravenously) powerfully inhibited absorption of bicarbonate (370 +/- 3 to 200 +/- 9 pEq/mm.min, P less than .001), chloride (214 +/- 3 to 105 +/- 9 pEq/mm.min, P less than .001), and water 5.2 +/- 0.1 to 2.8 +/- 0.2 nL/mm.min, P less than .001) in the S1 subsegment of the PCT. DuP 753 was significantly more effective than captopril (3 mg/kg, intravenously) in inhibiting sodium chloride transport and is the most potent diuretic ever described in this segment. Consistent with the axial decline of angiotensin II receptor density in the PCT, DuP 753 was a less effective transport inhibitor in the S2 subsegment of the PCT, similar to captopril. Using free-flow micropuncture and clearance techniques, though inhibition in the earliest segment of the nephron is partially compensated by downstream reabsorption, DuP 753 induces a substantial diuresis, natriuresis, and chloruresis. In conclusion, DuP 753 markedly decreases S1 PCT fluid and electrolyte absorption, indicating that endogenous angiotensin II exerts significant tonic support of proximal transport in vivo.\r"

Plasma renin activities were similar and averaged 4.4 +/- 0.7 and 4.3 +/- 1.4 ng AI/mL.h, respectively, in the SHR and WKY rats. In WKY rats (n = 15), DuP 753 (2 or 10 mg/kg, intravenously) had no effect on urine flow, sodium excretion, renal blood flow (RBF), or glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Fractional excretion of lithium (FELi) rose from 32 +/- 5 to 40 +/- 4% of the filtered load and arterial pressure decreased slightly from 129 +/- 2 to 122 +/- 2 mm Hg. In SHR (n = 9), urine flow fell 24%, and FELi and RBF increased by 27% and 30%, respectively, after 2 mg/kg DuP 753, but sodium excretion, GFR, and arterial pressure were not significantly altered. A higher dose of DuP 753 (10 mg/kg; n = 8) reduced arterial pressure, urine flow, and sodium excretion in the SHR. RBF increased 34%, while GFR and FELi were not significantly altered. Similar effects were seen in SHR (n = 11), given an equivalent antihypertensive dose of captopril (20 mg/kg). In euvolemic MW rats in which plasma renin activity was elevated to 18.8 +/- 3.3 ng AI/mL.h, DuP 753 (2 mg/kg, n = 7) increased RBF, urine flow, and sodium excretion, while mean arterial pressure and GFR were unaltered.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "A colony of genetic hypertensive dogs with systolic blood pressure of 140 to 220 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure greater than 100 mm Hg in the trained state was used. The objective of this study was to investigate the hemodynamic and renal effects of the novel angiotensin II receptor antagonist DuP 753 given intravenously to these dogs. Renal functions and blood pressure were measured 45 to 75 min after the intravenous administration of DuP 753 at 1, 3, 10, and 30 mg/kg and were compared to control (placebo) treatment. Arterial pressure was slightly but significantly and dose-dependently reduced by DuP 753. Glomerular filtration rate increased significantly in a dose-dependent manner. Similarly, effective renal plasma flow was dose-dependently increased. Filtration fraction was unchanged. Renal vascular resistance was significantly reduced in a dose-dependent manner at 3, 10, and 30 mg/kg of DuP 753. DuP 753 increased fractional sodium excretion at all doses and increased fractional potassium excretion only at the highest doses. The vasopressor effects of angiotensin I and II were dose-dependently inhibited by DuP 753. These data show that DuP 753 has beneficial renal hemodynamic effects and lowers arterial pressure in this canine model of essential hypertension.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this investigation was to compare the chronic effects of converting enzyme inhibition with captopril to direct blockade of angiotensin II (AII) with DuP 753 in the rat model of heart failure. Rats with chronic heart failure postinfarction were treated for 2 weeks with either captopril (2 g/L, N = 9) in their drinking water or with DuP 753 (40 mg/kg/day for two weeks by gastric gavage, N = 10), or placebo (N = 9). At this dose, DuP 753 shifted the log dose-pressor response curve to AII parallel to the right by two orders of magnitude in both chronically treated normal and heart failure rats. In rats with heart failure, DuP 753 and captopril reduced left ventricular end-diastolic pressure from 26.7 +/- 1.5 to 14.2 +/- 3.0 (P less than .01) and 15.8 +/- 2.2 mm Hg (P less than .05), respectively, left ventricular end-diastolic volume index from 2.71 +/- 0.10 to 2.03 +/- 0.17 (P less than .05) and 2.18 +/- 0.15 (P less than .05), respectively; venous compliance increased from 2.27 +/- 0.06 to 2.80 +/- 0.18 (P less than .05) and 3.02 +/- 0.21 mL/mm Hg/kg (P less than .01), respectively. There were no significant changes in left ventricular weight/body weight ratio, mean aortic pressure, heart rate, or right atrial pressure. There was a trend, but not significant, for a reduction in total blood volume from 65.8 +/- 1.1 to 59.4 +/- 3.0 and 64.9 +/- 3.9 mL/kg, respectively. Thus, direct blockade of AII with DuP 753 or with converting enzyme inhibition with captopril produces similar hemodynamic changes in rats with heart failure after myocardial infarction.\r"

The rise in blood pressure, due to high sodium intake, was blunted in the first 8 weeks of the study in the DuP 753-treated group; however, it started slowly to rise in the following weeks. In the untreated group, blood pressure rose steadily and it was significantly higher than that of the treated group during the whole experimental period. DuP 753-treated rats gained weight continuously during the study in contrast to the untreated group, where weight gain was arrested after 4 weeks. Plasma renin activity rose significantly after 4 weeks of treatment with DuP 753; by week 6 its values returned to baseline values and remained at these lower values until week 12. In the untreated group, plasma renin activity was not suppressed by high sodium intake after 4 weeks; it continued to rise and it was significantly elevated by 8 and 12 weeks. Survival at 12 weeks was 84% in DuP 753-treated group and 26% in the untreated group. The data demonstrate that DuP 753 decreased mortality and dramatically blunted the blood pressure rise in SHRsp fed a high sodium diet.\r"

  ".W": "We investigated the effect of blockade of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) on morbidity and hypertension in salt-loaded Dahl salt-sensitive (Dahl S) rats. Six-week-old male Dahl S rats (n = 198) were fed a high sodium diet (8% NaCl) for 10 weeks. One group of rats (n = 91) was treated with 30 mg/kg/day of the nonpeptide angiotensin II receptor antagonist, DuP 753, whereas the control group (n = 107) was left untreated. Blood pressure rose steeply in both groups, reaching levels above 200 mm Hg by week 6. DuP 753-treated animals were less hypertensive than controls between weeks 3 and 5 of the study, but had similar blood pressure before and after that time. Although the angiotensin II antagonist had only a transient effect on blood pressure it markedly prolonged survival. After 10 weeks, 68.3% of rats receiving DuP 753, but only 30.1% of controls, were still alive (P less than .0001). Higher morbidity in controls than in DuP 753-treated rats was also suggested by body weights. Following 6 weeks of high salt diet, untreated rats progressively lost weight while DuP 753-treated animals maintained a steady body weight. These results show that the angiotensin II receptor antagonist DuP 753 greatly enhanced survival in salt-loaded Dahl S rats although it reduced blood pressure only transiently. Our data are consistent with a contribution of the RAS to morbidity in this model of hypertension.\r"

In the multiple dose study, the administration of placebo or DuP 735 (5, 10, 20, or 40 mg, per os once daily) for eight consecutive days was evaluated. The blood pressure response to angiotensin I and II was inhibited in a dose-dependent fashion with a blocking effect still present 24 h post drug. DuP 753 also induced a dose-dependent compensatory rise in plasma renin. This new compound was well tolerated by these normal volunteers. Thus, DuP 753 appears to be a well tolerated, orally active, potent and long-lasting antagonist of angiotensin II in humans.\r"

  ".W": "Quantitative echocardiography is frequently used for serial evaluation of left ventricular performance. This prospective study was designed to determine the extent to which the acts of image acquisition and quantitation, and the subjects themselves, affect total variability in two-dimensional and Doppler echocardiographic indexes of left ventricular morphology and performance. Therefore, two technicians and two readers acquired and analyzed 60 echocardiograms from 15 normal subjects, each of whom was studied four times (twice on each of two visits). Analysis of variance based on generalizability theory was used to estimate the magnitude of these variability sources by calculating standard deviations (SD) and used to estimate their contribution to total variability. Of the two-dimensional echocardiographic indexes tested, ejection fraction varied least (SD, 6.6%) and left ventricular mass varied most (SD, 35.3 gm). Of the Doppler indexes, normalized early diastolic filling velocity integral varied least (SD, 8.4%) and deceleration time varied most (SD, 48.6 msec). Technical (image acquisition and quantitation) variability contributed most (and subject variability least) to total variability of stroke volume (68%) and deceleration time (67%). Technical variability contributed least (and subject variability most) to variability of ejection fraction (43%) and diastolic filling time (25%). The acts of image acquisition and quantitation varied more between than within technicians and readers. Peak atrial filling velocity and the ratio of peak early to atrial filling velocity significantly differed between technicians. Left ventricular ejection fraction, left ventricular mass, peak atrial filling velocity, early filling integral, and deceleration of early filling differed significantly between readers. Therefore the acts of image acquisition and quantitation, and subject variability itself, all contribute to total variability in echocardiographic indexes. Changes seen on clinical studies should be interpreted as abnormal only when exceeding the total variability originating from these sources. Generalizability theory allows one to tailor strategies to reduce variability. These strategies include increasing the number of observations, readers, and technicians for any given \"baseline\" study and using the same readers and technicians for sequential follow-up studies.\r"

To determine whether simple Doppler echocardiographic measures of left ventricular filling could improve upon the ability of systolic function to predict heart failure after infarction, patients with acute myocardial infarction were studied within the first 36 hours by Doppler and two-dimensional echocardiography. Forty-eight patients who did not have heart failure before the Doppler echocardiographic study and who did not have myocardial revascularization, moderate or severe mitral regurgitation, or other complications during recovery were monitored for 6 months or to the onset of heart failure (n = 10). The univariate predictors of heart failure were age (p less than 0.05), anterior infarction (p less than 0.05), early diastolic peak filling velocity (p = 0.05), filling velocity with atrial systole (p less than 0.05), the ratio of these velocities (p less than 0.001), the percentage of filling with atrial systole (p less than 0.001), and the wall motion score index (p less than 0.001). However, the only independent predictors of heart failure by use of multivariant stepwise logistic regression analysis were the wall motion score index (p less than 0.05) and either the ratio of early and late peak filling velocities (p less than 0.001) or the percentage of filling with atrial systole (p less than 0.001). The combined use of a measure of systolic function and measures of the relative contribution of atrial systole to ventricular filling were useful predictors in identifying patients likely to develop subsequent heart failure after myocardial infarction.\r"

Analysis is performed on two-dimensional echocardiograms of 44 normal subjects, 38 patients with anterior myocardial infarction, and 17 patients with posterior myocardial infarction. Two different models for wall motion analysis are applied, each using the fixed-reference system and the floating-reference system, respectively. In patients with anterior myocardial infarction, the fixed-reference system indicates severe wall motion abnormalities at the anterior, septal, and apical walls, whereas the floating-reference system indicates less severe wall motion abnormalities almost equally at every wall. In patients with posterior myocardial infarction, the fixed-reference system indicates severe wall motion abnormalities at the posterior wall, whereas the floating-reference system indicates less severe wall motion abnormalities almost equally at every wall. These findings indicate that the fixed-reference system is superior to the floating-reference system in quantification of wall motion of end-expiratory two-dimensional echocardiograms.\r"

There was excellent correlation between the calculated peak-to-background ratio and the subjective opinion of trained echocardiographers. Furthermore, radial length measurements made from images that were thought to be optimally enhanced by the peak-to-background ratio calculation showed the lowest interobserver mean differences. We conclude that the peak-to-background ratio does reflect improvement in characteristics of the image that favor more precise measurement (amplification of peaks and suppression of background) and can be used to help guide a dynamic approach to image processing.\r"

The patients were recruited on the basis of the presence of at least one of four different types of abnormal left ventricular blood flow movements during systole, isovolumetric relaxation, and diastole (time after mitral valve opening). The abnormal blood flow patterns were composed of the following: (1) systolic left ventricular outflow and midventricular obstruction in 20 of 40 and in 6 of 40 patients, respectively; (2) retrograde isovolumetric relaxation flow (IVRFretro; mean velocity, 0.7 +/- 0.3 m/sec), that is, flow toward the apex of the left ventricle, in 28 of 40 patients; (3) antegrade isovolumetric relaxation flow (IVRFante; mean velocity, 1.6 +/- 1.0 m/sec), that is, flow toward the left ventricular outflow tract, in 3 of 40 patients; and (4) diastolic antegrade flow (DFante; mean velocity, 0.9 +/- 0.3 m/sec), that is, flow opposite to mitral inflow, in 10 of 40 patients. There were significantly fewer patients with asymmetric septal hypertrophy (group 1) than with apical hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (group 2) showing DFante (1/29 versus 9/11, p less than 0.01). IVRFretro and DFante revealed higher velocities in patients with marked left ventricular asymmetric hypertrophy than in those with mild hypertrophy. Thus, in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and especially in patients with marked asymmetric hypertrophy, there are different types of abnormal intraventricular blood flow movements during isovolumetric relaxation and disatole. This phenomenon is probably caused by asynchronous relaxation of the asymmetrically distributed, hypertrophied myocardium. DFante is more often observed in the apical cardiomyopathy than other forms of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy probably attributable to apically localized left ventricular cavity obliteration.\r"

Mean values of both time intervals, mean difference, and its standard error were equal to zero for stenoses. Time intervals of 71% for mitral stenosis and 52% for aortic stenosis did not differ by more than 0.01 second; correlation coefficients were 0.96 for mitral stenosis and 0.85 for aortic stenosis. For regurgitations, differences in mean values and a mean difference with a standard error were found but remained unsignificant. However, the percentage of differences in time intervals below or equal to 0.01 second decreased to 35 for aortic regurgitation and 13 for mitral regurgitation, which showed the widest 95% range of differences. Correlation coefficients were 0.84 for the aortic regurgitation and 0.33 for mitral regurgitation. Thus the close relationship of time intervals suggests that standardized timing of area measurements at peak velocity is feasible for stenoses and remains under consideration for aortic regurgitation. Timing of measurements should remain empiric for mitral regurgitation.\r"

We report a patient who had an abscess involving the aortic-mitral intervalvular fibrosa that eroded into the interatrial septum, causing an interatrial communication with a left-to-right shunt. The abscess was detected by transthoracic echocardiography, but the fistula was only seen by the subsequent transesophageal echocardiogram. To our knowledge, this is the first report of an interatrial fistula secondary to a para-aortic valve abscess and its diagnosis preoperatively. Transesophageal echocardiography should be performed in any patient suspected to have complicated aortic endocarditis.\r"

During the same period, analysis of the arterial and pulmonary pressure traces showed pulsatile activity to be related with the electrocardiogram's T waves.

  ".W": "The National Cooperative Dialysis Study (NCDS) suggested that the removal of small molecules controls the adequacy of the dialysis prescription, and it would seem appropriate that renal units regularly carry out formal urea kinetic modeling to ensure that the adequacy of dialysis is provided. Current methods of calculating Kt/V (urea) are complex and require the accurate measurement of dialyzer urea clearance and calculation of the volume of distribution of urea. This may be done by the direct measurement of total urea removed or by the use of computer programs that examine plasma urea and weight changes over time. Both methods have inherent problems, and this has stimulated the search for easier \"bedside\" formulas for the calculation of Kt/V. These newer formulas involve examination of the percentage reduction in blood urea concentration during hemodialysis. Two such formulas were examined and applied to 78 patients undergoing hemodialysis in two centers. One center routinely carried out formal urea kinetic modeling; the other did not. In the first center, it was found that the majority of patients were receiving more dialysis than necessary to achieve Kt/V (urea) = 1 when the latter was judged by those formulas. This suggested the possibility of time savings, with considerable implications for cost efficiency. In the second center, the majority of patients required more dialysis. It was concluded that intermittent formal urea kinetic modeling tends to overshoot the necessary prescription to allow for occasional \"imperfect\" dialyses and also that it is impossible to base dialysis prescriptions on routine pre-dialysis blood work and a \"feel\" for patients' needs.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "During the first few years of clinical research on neonatal extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), 16 premature infants of less than 35 weeks gestational age were treated by the authors (RHB), and only four (25%) survived. Intracranial hemorrhage was common, prompting the authors to recommend that ECMO not be used in premature infants with respiratory failure. Since diagnostic methods, indications, and techniques of extracorporeal support have improved considerably, the records of these previous cases were reviewed in detail to determine if there was reason to believe that results might be better in the modern era. Of the 16 patients, four had pre-ECMO conditions that would now be considered contraindications and five of the remaining patients had major technical complications that are now rare. Anticoagulation and fluid management of these patients also would be handled much differently. Based on this review and on current experience with extracorporeal support in near-term infants, it is reasonable to expect that survival of moribund premature infants might be 50% or greater with extracorporeal support. New phase I trials using improved indications and technology are suggested.\r"

  ".W": "To better understand the differences in published estimates of peritoneal mass transport coefficients, a comparative analysis of seven mathematical models of peritoneal transport was performed. Uniform investigation involving measurements of solute concentrations and accurate determination of peritoneal dialysate volume was undertaken in twenty-eight 6 hour dwell studies using 3.86% glucose dialysate in non-diabetic patients undergoing continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). The investigated models were all based on the theory of transport across a homogeneous membrane. Diffusive mass transport coefficients (KBD) calculated during a period of dialysate isovolemia served as reference values in the comparative analysis. The evaluation of models involved calculations of transport coefficients and comparison of calculated dialysate-to-plasma concentration ratios (D/P) with experimental D/P. The best fit of theoretically predicted D/P to experimental D/P was obtained with Pyle-Popovich's model, which accounts for both the diffusive (KBD) and convective (sieving coefficient [S]) characteristics of the peritoneal membrane. Garred's model, assuming S = 1, yielded acceptable results for small solutes (except sodium), whereas Henderson's model, in which convective transport is neglected, proved to be surprisingly accurate for KBD for both small solutes (except sodium) and protein. S values (mean +/- SD) calculated using Pyle-Popovich's model were found to be out of the physically interpretable range for glucose (S = -0.38 +/- 0.48) and potassium (S = 1.57 +/- 0.19), and therefore these S values should be treated as phenomenologic rather than physical quantities.\r"

Cadaveric studies quantifying anatomic constraints are limited by postmortem factors causing distortion of critical structures. This study defines the anatomic constraints and parameters necessary for designing an implantable TAH. Importantly, these parameters were measured in 12 consecutive patients undergoing orthotopic cardiac transplant (mean body surface area, 2.0 +/- 0.1 m2) after native heart amputation. A full sized contour model of the cylindrical TAH (diameter, 97 mm; width, 78 mm) was inserted into the pericardial cavity to verify fit, which was found adequate in each case, with no identifiable compression of adjacent vascular structures. Intraoperative measurements obtained define intrathoracic and pericardial constraints for a cardiac prosthesis (mean pericardial dimensions: length, 133.0 mm; width, 154.0 mm; depth, 129.0 mm). The parameters measured will provide useful reference for other prosthetic devices, since they were obtained intraoperatively rather than postmortem. The current dimensions of our TAH were found to be acceptable for orthotopic implantation.\r"

In this study, it is demonstrated that the use of microcapsules containing a urease-zeolite preparation may be a potential route to urea removal. The use of zeolite ion exchangers, and zeolite W in particular, can alleviate the problems encountered with zirconium phosphate. Unlike zirconium phosphate, zeolite W is nonselective toward calcium ions and is stable at the high pH found in the intestinal tract. Zeolite W, when present in the sodium form, has a high ammonium capacity of 3.6 mEq NH4+/g zeolite under simulated intestinal conditions; its reactivity to ammonium is also higher. The application of enzyme envelopes to zeolite particles is a novel immobilization procedure that does not involve the use of colloidal silica and can reduce the amount of ingested material by as much as 25%. The current in vitro study shows that cellulose acetate butyrate microcapsules, containing a urease-zeolite preparation, remove up to 80% of urea in less than 1 hour. These microcapsules can be dried and retain activity when sealed in a jar at 4 degrees C.\r"

Coagulation status was determined in duplicate with the Hemochron 400 System (HC), the HemoTec Automated Coagulation Timer (HT), and the TriMed ACTivator (TM). Thrombin times or dilutions (TT) were also determined for each sample. Baseline values did not differ (p greater than 0.05); however, the HT and TM ACT values were significantly longer (p less than 0.05) than the HC ACT values at predicted heparin concentrations greater than 0.2 U/ml. Results from the HT and TM instruments were not significantly different. The HT and TM instruments both provided a greater ACT range over the heparin concentrations tested. Of the tests studied to monitor heparin therapy, mean scaled TTs showed the best correlation with predicted heparin concentrations.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To examine early leucocyte responses and neutrophil activation in acute myocardial infarction treated by streptokinase and to relate the findings to coronary recanalisation and indices of myocardial damage in order to provide further information about the role of neutrophils in the evolution of injury. DESIGN--Group analysis of paired blood samples, obtained before streptokinase treatment and one hour after it, and of three indirect measures of myocardial injury: left ventricular ejection fraction, QRS score, and peak creatine kinase. SETTING--The coronary care unit of a district general hospital. PATIENTS--39 patients with acute myocardial infarction who underwent paired blood sampling (before streptokinase and one hour after streptokinase) and cardiac catheterisation 5 (3-8) days later. END POINTS--Changes in peripheral white cell and neutrophil counts and plasma elastase one hour after streptokinase infusion. Comparison of these variables in patients with and without patency of the infarct related coronary artery. Correlations between these variables and indirect measures of myocardial injury. RESULTS--Neutrophil activation, as reflected by plasma elastase, increased sharply one hour after streptokinase. Total white cell and neutrophil counts also increased. Changes tended to be more pronounced in patients with patency of the infarct related artery, though the trend was not statistically significant. Neutrophil activation before streptokinase was unrelated to indirect indices of myocardial injury but only one hour after streptokinase a weak negative correlation with left ventricular ejection fraction had developed. Peripheral neutrophil responses showed a similar relation to ejection fraction and also correlated with peak creatine kinase and QRS score. CONCLUSIONS--Thrombolytic treatment in acute myocardial infarction is associated with an abrupt reactive neutrophil response which provides an early measure of injury. It is also associated with neutrophil activation, probably in response to coronary recanalisation and myocardial reperfusion. Activated neutrophils are recognised as mediators of reperfusion injury in experimental infarction and the data in the present study provide preliminary evidence of a similar pathogenic role in the clinical setting.\r"

DESIGN--Prospective evaluation of the relations between anginal perceptual threshold, autonomic function, and systolic blood pressure in patients with symptomatic coronary artery disease. Statistical analysis was by non-parametric techniques. SETTING--Cardiology departments of a district general hospital and a post-graduate teaching centre. SUBJECTS--82 non-diabetic men with typical exertional angina and coronary artery disease confirmed by arteriography (n = 64) or a history of Q wave infarction (n = 18). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Age, anginal perceptual threshold, autonomic function, and blood pressure. Anginal perceptual threshold was defined as the time from onset of 0.1 mV ST depression to the onset of angina during treadmill stress testing. Autonomic function was measured as the ratio of peak heart rate during the Valsalva manoeuvre to the minimum rate after release. RESULTS--Anginal perceptual threshold showed a weak but significant correlation with age, with older patients tending to have a longer interval between the onset of ST depression and the onset of angina. Comparison of patients in the upper and lower quartile age ranges showed a difference of 50 seconds between median threshold measurements. Blood pressure and heart rate responses to the Valsalva manoeuvre also correlated with age, but neither variable correlated with the anginal perceptual threshold. CONCLUSIONS--In non-diabetic men with coronary artery disease the perception of angina tends to deteriorate with advancing age. The mechanism is unclear but is not attributable solely to alterations in blood pressure or autonomic function.\r"

Nineteen patients (group 1) on diuretics alone were compared with 15 patients (group 2) taking diuretics plus either enalapril or captopril. All drug regimens were stable for at least three months before the study. Patients with impaired renal function (plasma creatinine greater than 120 mumol/l) were excluded. INTERVENTIONS--An intravenous loading dose of magnesium sulphate was given to minimise the variability in baseline magnesium state. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE--Total urine magnesium excretion and creatinine clearance in 24 hour urine collections. RESULTS--Plasma magnesium was similar in the two groups. However, 24 hour urine magnesium excretion was significantly lower in group 2 than in group 1. Furthermore, creatinine clearance was also significantly lower in group 2 and correlated strongly with magnesium excretion. There was no such relation in group 1. There was no difference in fractional clearance of magnesium between groups. CONCLUSION--Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors have an important magnesium conserving action, possibly via their effect on glomerular filtration rate.\r"

Plasma concentrations of D-dimer in the 10 patients with a mobile thrombus were all greater than 300 ng/ml (mean 983.3, 95% confidence interval 498.9 to 1467.7 ng/ml) and they were significantly higher than those in the patients with a non-mobile thrombus (226.2, 33.6 to 418.8 ng/ml) and the patients without an intracardiac thrombus (147.2, 110.4 to 184 ng/ml). CONCLUSIONS--A high plasma concentration of D-dimer seemed to reflect a hypercoagulable intracardiac state and may be a helpful indicator of the possible presence of mobile intracardiac thrombus in patients with mitral stenosis.\r"

  ".W": "All patients with suspected myocardial infarction admitted to hospital in four Birmingham health districts were studied to test the hypothesis that Asian patients would be overrepresented and Caribbean patients underrepresented compared with the indigenous population. One thousand four hundred and ninety six patients had a final diagnosis of myocardial infarction or severe angina pectoris. The relative risk of admission for Asian men compared with white men aged 45-64 years was 2.65 (95% confidence interval 2.20 to 3.19) and the risk for Asian men was high for both myocardial infarction and ischaemia when analysed separately. The relative risk of admission for Caribbean men compared with white men was 0.53 (95% CI 0.33 to 1.20). The relative risk for Asian women compared with white women in the same age group was 2.58 (95% CI 1.68 to 3.96), but this was due to an excess of admissions diagnosed as ischaemia rather than infarction in the Asian women. For Caribbean and white women the risk of admission was the same, although significantly fewer Caribbean women were admitted with myocardial infarction. The study was undertaken in 1986-87 and population data had to be derived from the 1981 census. The resident population changed in those five years and so the results were recalculated making allowances for these changes in the health districts involved. Based on these data the admission rate for Asian men with suspected myocardial infarction aged 45-64 was nearly twice that for white men (1.8): the relative risk of admission for Asian men compared with white men was 2.04 (95% CI 1.53 to 2.18).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "A total of 32 (3.6%) patients of 880 undergoing coronary angioplasty during a nine year period at one hospital had extensive dissection (defined as a dissection extending beyond the limits of the dilated angioplasty balloon) in the coronary artery in which the angioplasty procedure was performed. Two (6.25%) of the 32 patients (both of whom were undergoing angioplasty because of unstable angina that was refractory to medical treatment) died as a consequence of the coronary artery dissection. Twelve (38%) needed immediate coronary artery bypass surgery and 11 (34%) had a myocardial infarction, which in four was minor in extent. During follow up, 20 of the 32 patients were successfully managed by medical treatment; only two needed further angioplasty procedures. There were no late deaths. Extensive coronary artery dissection is a serious complication of coronary angioplasty, with a high early mortality and a high incidence of infarction and requirement for bypass surgery. None the less, patients with extensive dissection who are free from the manifestations of acute ischaemia at the end of the procedure can be managed conservatively and have a good immediate and medium term outlook. Attempts should be made to stabilise extensive dissection during coronary angioplasty so that surgical intervention can be delayed or avoided altogether if possible.\r"

DESIGN--Systemic and coronary venous blood samples were obtained from unselected patients with the clinical syndromes of either stable or unstable angina at the time of cardiac catheterisation and coronary arteriography. Control venous blood samples were obtained from healthy laboratory workers and from patients with chronic renal failure treated by intermittent haemodialysis. PATIENTS--Twelve patients with angina: seven with stable symptoms and five with unstable angina. RESULTS--The mean coronary venous endothelin concentration in unstable angina was 2.32 ng/l (range 1.7-3.2 ng/l). In stable angina it was 2.77 ng/l (range 2.1-4.4 ng/l). These values were not significantly different from one another nor from the values obtained in systemic venous blood from either group or from the healthy controls. Circulating endothelin concentrations were much higher in venous blood from the patients treated by haemodialysis. CONCLUSIONS--These data do not support the hypothesis that raised endothelin concentrations in coronary blood in patients with unstable angina may modulate variations in coronary arterial tone thereby contributing to the clinical syndrome of chest pain and electrocardiographic changes at rest. The raised endothelin concentrations seen in systemic venous blood after myocardial infarction may be part of the systemic response to myocardial infarction.\r"

This gives rise to a laser beam with a relatively large cross section at the subject's pupil. In this study the pupillary area required to view the fundus at the slit-lamp with a 90-dioptre lens is determined. It is found that the pupillary area required to view the fundus is smaller than the cross section of the Microlase laser beam at the pupil. Thus iris clipping of the laser beam can occur even though the surgeon has a clear and bright view of the fundus. Care should be taken to use the Microlase only in the presence of a widely dilated pupil.\r"

The retrobulbarly inserted needles were within the muscle cone, directed towards the optic foramen. The periocular needles were outside the muscle cone, tangentially along the orbital floor or pointing slightly upwards. After the retrobulbar injection the contrast medium was seen within the cone immediately after the injection and outside the cone as early as 3 minutes after the injection. With the periocular technique, however, diffusion of the anaesthetic in the opposite direction (that is, into the muscle cone) was rapid. The contrast medium was identified inside the muscle cone 2 minutes after the injection. Compression with an intraocular pressure reduction device after both of these techniques prevented exophthalmos. It is concluded that retrobulbar-like anaesthesia can also be induced by an appropriate periocular technique.\r"

Microbiological cultures from a tap of the patient's aqueous humour prior to lens explantation as well as from the explanted lens and aqueous and vitreous humour during operation yielded Staphylococcus epidermidis sensu stricto. Scanning electron microscopy showed massive colonisation of the lens loop by staphylococci. Clonal identity of all isolates was demonstrated by plasmid DNA analysis and sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) of extra-cellular products. This is strongly suggestive of the aetiological role of S. epidermidis in this case of late onset endophthalmitis.\r"

DESIGN--Controlled study of antibody testing of blood samples from children immunised according to various schedules: three doses of triple vaccine completed at 8-13 calendar months, 6-7 calendar months, before 6 calendar months, or three doses followed by diphtheria/tetanus before age 2. SETTING--Plymouth Health Authority. SUBJECTS--129 children aged 4 years who had received three doses of diphtheria/tetanus/pertussis vaccine with or without a diphtheria/tetanus booster. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Diphtheria and tetanus antitoxin concentrations and antibody titres to pertussis toxin, filamentous haemagglutinin, and agglutinogens 2 and 3. RESULTS--All children had protective concentrations of antitoxin to diphtheria and tetanus (greater than or equal to 0.01 IU/ml). There was no evidence of a significant difference in diphtheria or tetanus antitoxin concentrations and pertussis antibody titres in children immunised with an accelerated course (third dose of triple vaccine before 6 months) compared with those who received a longer course (third dose at 8-13 months) with no booster (geometric mean antitoxin concentration 0.411 (95% confidence interval 0.273 to 0.618) v 0.426 (0.294 to 0.616) for diphtheria and 0.358 (0.231 to 0.556) v 0.299 (0.197 to 0.453) for tetanus; geometric mean antibody titres 903 (500 to 1631) v 1386 (848 to 2266) for pertussis filamentous haemagglutinin, 179 (130 to 248) v 232 (167 to 322) for pertussis toxin, and 2002 (1276 to 3142) v 3591 (2220 to 5809) for agglutinogens 2 and 3). CONCLUSION--Immunisation with three doses of triple vaccine at monthly intervals completed before 6 months of age probably provides adequate protection against diphtheria, tetanus, and whooping cough which will persist until the age of the preschool booster.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To study the association between Alzheimer's disease and nicotine intake through smoking. DESIGN--Population based case-control study. SETTING--City of Rotterdam and four northern provinces of The Netherlands. SUBJECTS--198 patients with early onset Alzheimer's disease, 198 controls matched for age and sex, and families of 17 patients in whom Alzheimer's disease was apparently inherited as an autosomal dominant disorder. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Age of onset of dementia, relative risk of Alzheimer's disease. RESULTS--89 of 193 patients with Alzheimer's disease had a history of smoking compared with 102 of 195 controls. Among the patients and controls with a family history of dementia, smoking was significantly less common in those with dementia (40/95 with dementia v 55/96 controls; relative risk 0.35; 95% confidence interval 0.16 to 0.78). The risk of Alzheimer's disease decreased with increasing daily number of cigarettes smoked before onset of disease (relative risk 0.3 in those smoking greater than 21/day v 1 in non-smokers). In six families in which the disease was apparently inherited as an autosomal dominant disorder, the mean age of onset was 4.17 years later in smoking patients than in non-smoking patients from the same family (p = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS--These findings suggest an inverse association between smoking and Alzheimer's disease, although smoking cannot be advocated for other health reasons. We speculate that nicotine may have a role in the aetiology of both Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease.\r"

DESIGN--Prospective assessment of effects of methods of support on groups of doctors in one urban hospital and one rural hospital. SETTING--Accident and emergency department at Whipps Cross Hospital, London, and surgical wards of Airedale General Hospital, West Yorkshire. PATIENTS--Consecutive prospective series of all patients presenting to each hospital in specified time periods with acute abdominal pain; total patients in the various periods were 12,506. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Diagnostic accuracy of participating doctors, admission rates of patients with non-specific abdominal pain, perforation rates in patients with appendicitis, negative laparotomy rates. RESULTS--Use of any one modality resulted in improved diagnostic accuracy and decision making performance. Use of structured forms plus computer feedback resulted in better performance than use of forms alone. Use of structured forms plus a computer teaching package gave results at least as good as those with direct feedback by computer. CONCLUSIONS--The results confirm earlier studies in suggesting that the use of computer aided decision support improves diagnostic and decision making performance when dealing with patients suffering from acute abdominal pain. That use of the computer for teaching gave results at least as good as with its use for direct feedback may be highly relevant for those who are apprehensive about the real time use of diagnostic computers in a clinical setting.\r"

DESIGN--Prospective randomised trial of three treatments--namely distension only, steroid only, and steroid with distension. SETTING--Academic department of orthopaedic and accident surgery at Queen's Medical Centre, Nottingham. SUBJECTS--47 patients (30 women) with capsulitis affecting 50 shoulders. INTERVENTIONS--Three intra-articular injections into the shoulder given at six week intervals by the same technique. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Passive range of abduction, forward flexion, and external rotation; results of shoulder dynamometry measuring work done and torque produced; pain levels at rest and with resisted movement. RESULTS--All patients reported improvement during the study. Analysis of the mean improvements in abduction and forward flexion showed these to be significantly greater in the steroid with distension and steroid only groups than in the distension only group (mean improvements in abduction (degrees/week (95% confidence interval)) 4.3 (3.4 to 5.2), 3.4 (2.4 to 4.5), and 1.0 (-0.8 to 2.8) in the three groups respectively; mean improvements in flexion (degrees/week (95% confidence interval)) 3.6 (3.2 to 4.0), 3.3 (2.3 to 4.3), and 1.5 (0.5 to 2.5) respectively). Shoulder dynamometry failed to show a significant difference among the treatment groups. No severe complications occurred as a result of the injections, but two patients reported facial flushing related to the use of steroids. CONCLUSION--Intra-articular steroid injections have a useful role in the outpatient management of early capsulitis.\r"

DESIGN--Prospective study of patients with colorectal cancer managed by one of 13 consultant surgeons, none of whom had a special interest in colorectal surgery. SETTING--Royal Infirmary, Glasgow. PATIENTS--645 sequential patients with colorectal cancer presenting over the six years from 1974 to 1979. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Postoperative complications, postoperative mortality (within 30 days), and survival (up to 10 years); predictive factors for postoperative mortality and survival; and relative hazard rate ratios for individual surgeons. RESULTS--The proportion of patients undergoing apparently curative resection varied among surgeons from 40% to 76%; overall postoperative mortality varied from 8% to 30%. After curative resection postoperative mortality varied from 0% to 20%, local recurrence from 0% to 21%, and the rate of anastomotic leak from 0% to 25%. Survival at 10 years in patients who underwent curative resection varied from 20% to 63%, two year survival in those who underwent palliative resection varied from 7% to 32%, and median survival in those who underwent palliative diversion varied from one to eight months. The hazard rate ratios among individual surgeons, taking into account the identified risk factors, varied from 0.56 to 2.03, from 0.17 to 1.92, and from 0.57 to 1.50 for curative resection, palliative resection, and palliative diversion, respectively. CONCLUSION--There were significant variations in patient outcome among surgeons after surgery for colorectal cancer; such differences compromise survival. A considerable improvement in overall survival might be achieved if such surgery were undertaken by surgeons with a special interest in colorectal surgery or surgical oncology.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To evaluate audit and case finding (whole population care) in a community over 25 years. DESIGN--Contemporary screening for and audits of care of chronic disease and risk factors; retrospective review of computerised practice records; and comparisons of mortality and social indices with neighbouring communities. SETTING--One general practice in Glyncorrwg, West Glamorgan. SUBJECTS--1800 people registered with the practice in 1987 and 558 people who died from 1964 to 1987, whose records had been retained. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Detection of high blood pressure, smoking, airways obstruction, obesity, diabetes, and alcohol problems in adults aged 20-79; prevalence of smoking in this population and in hypertensive and diabetic groups; age standardised mortality ratios in relation to indices of social deprivation. RESULTS--In the population aged 20-79 (1207 patients) 249 (21%) had peak expiratory flow rate less than 50% of expected value or which improved by 15% or more with an inhaled beta agonist, 207 (17%) had body mass index at or over 30 kg/m2, 118 (10%) had untreated mean arterial pressures greater than 159/104 mm Hg (three readings), 80 (7%) (65 (16%) men, 15 (4%) women) had recognised alcohol problems, and 35 (3%) had diabetes. The proportion of men aged 20-64 who said they smoked fell from 61% (290/476) in 1968-70 to 36% (162/456) in 1985 whereas that of women who smoked was unchanged (43%, 187/436 v 42%, 190/448 respectively). In 116 screened hypertensive patients group mean blood pressure fell from 186/110 mm Hg before treatment to 146/84 mm Hg at 1987 audit, as did the proportion of smokers (56% v 20%), but body mass index and total cholesterol concentration showed no significant change. In 34 diabetic patients mean blood pressure and the proportion of smokers fell (171/93 mm Hg v 155/81 mm Hg; 44% v 12%). The age standardised mortality ratio in 1981-6 was lower than in a neighbouring village without a developed case finding programme (actual to expected deaths less than 65 = 21 to 22 in Glyncorrwg, 48 to 30 in control village). CONCLUSIONS--Whole population care through organised case finding and audit is feasible but only with a labour intensive approach combining accessibility, flexibility, and continuity, as well as a planned and structured approach, which requires substantial expansion of staff numbers and assiduous recording. It may reduce risks for at least some high risk groups. Despite their shortcomings the available data are consistent with the hypothesis that whole population care helps reduce mortality. Incentives in the new contract, which encourage the uncritical development of structured process, may diminish health outputs.\r"

DESIGN--Retrospective analysis of ambulance service reports and hospital records. SETTING--Scottish Ambulance Service and acute receiving hospitals throughout Scotland. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Delay from cardiac arrest to first defibrillator shock; vital state on arrival at hospital accident and emergency department; survival to hospital discharge. RESULTS--During the study period 268 defibrillators were purchased by public subscription and 96% of the 2000 ambulance crew underwent an eight hour training programme in cardiopulmonary resuscitation and defibrillation. A total of 1111 cardiac arrests were recorded, and defibrillation was indicated and undertaken in 602 (54%) patients, mean age 63 (range 14-92) years. A spontaneous pulse was present on arrival at hospital in 180 (30%) of the defibrillated patients, and 75 (12.5%) were subsequently discharged alive. As expected, the likelihood of survival was inversely related to the delay from the onset of cardiac arrest to the time of the first shock and was greater in the case of witnessed arrest. If ventricular fibrillation occurred after the arrival of the ambulance, survival to discharge was 33%. CONCLUSIONS--An effective scheme for out of hospital defibrillation can be introduced rapidly, and with limited training implications and costs, by the use of automated external defibrillators in ambulances.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To determine parent's views on how death of their children should have been handled. DESIGN--Retrospective questionnaire survey of parents who had experienced death of their child. SETTING--Charitable organisation of bereaved parents. SUBJECTS--150 bereaved parents, all members of the organisation, of whom 120 (80%) participated voluntarily in the study. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Child's age; date and cause of death; details of person breaking the news and handling of the interview; time parents spent with dead child, their attitude to requests for organ donation, and follow up support received. RESULTS--122 children's deaths were described; the largest single group was due to road traffic accidents, 16 were suicides, and eight were murders. Twice as many interviews were rated as sympathetically or reasonably handled as badly or offensively handled (68 v 34). The interview ratings depended on the sensitivity and personal skills of the interviewers rather than on their previous contact or professional position; police were rated as more sympathetic than doctors and nurses. Of 109 respondents, 81 had seen their child's body, 44 of whom thought that sufficient time had been denied. Of the 28 parents who did not see the body, 17 subsequently stated their regret. In 82 parents organ donation had not been discussed. Only 16 parents recorded any follow up support from hospital staff and very few support at the time. CONCLUSIONS--The consistency of the responses suggests a serious need to revise the in service training and education of the police and health professionals in their approach to informing of death; organ donation should be discussed sensitively and parents allowed time with their dead child with fewer restrictions.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVES--To develop a simple, reliable, and safe diagnostic tool for acute stroke syndromes in a setting where computerised brain scanning was not readily available and to validate its accuracy with regard to pathological types of stroke. DESIGN--13 clinical variables that potentially might differentiate supratentorial cerebral haemorrhage from infarction were recorded and tested by multivariate analysis in a prospective study of 174 patients with acute stroke. In developing the Siriraj stroke score stepwise discriminant analysis of the variables was followed by a linear discriminant equation to differentiate between supratentorial haemorrhage and infarction. The score obtained was validated against scores in 206 other patients with stroke, computerised brain scans being used for definitive diagnosis. SETTING--Siriraj Hospital Medical School, Mahidol University, Bangkok. SUBJECTS--Prospective study: 174 consecutive patients with acute supratentorial stroke syndrome (not subarachnoid haemorrhage) admitted to Siriraj Hospital during 1984-5; validation study: 206 patients admitted to Siriraj Hospital or another hospital for supratentorial intracerebral haemorrhage or infarction. RESULTS--The Siriraj stroke score was developed and calculated as (2.5 x level of consciousness) + (2 x vomiting) + (2 x headache) + (0.1 x diastolic blood pressure) - (3 x atheroma markers) - 12. A score above 1 indicates supratentorial intracerebral haemorrhage, while a score below -1 indicates infarction. The score between 1 and -1 represents an equivocal result needing a computerised brain scan or probability curve to verify the diagnosis. In the validation study of the Siriraj stroke score the diagnostic sensitivities of the score for cerebral haemorrhage and cerebral infarction were 89.3% and 93.2% respectively, with an overall predictive accuracy of 90.3%. CONCLUSION--The Siriraj stroke score is widely accepted and applied in hospitals throughout Thailand as a simple and reliable bedside method for diagnosing acute stroke.\r"

DESIGN--Computer aided search of published papers and blinded assessment of the methods of studies. SUBJECTS--23 randomised controlled trials, of which 16 studied exercise therapy given by physiotherapists to individual patients with back pain. Other conservative treatments could be included. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Score for quality of methods (based on four main categories: study population, interventions, measurement of effect, and data presentation and analysis) and main conclusion of author(s) with regard to exercise therapy. RESULTS--Only four studies scored more than 50 points (maximum 100), indicating that most were of poor quality. Six studies found that exercise was better than reference treatments and 10 reported it to be no better or worse than the reference treatment. Those reporting positive results tended to have higher methods scores (4/6 positive v 4/10 negative scored greater than or equal to 42). CONCLUSIONS--No conclusion can be drawn about whether exercise therapy is better than other conservative treatments for back pain or whether a specific type of exercise is more effective. Further trials are needed in which greater attention is paid to methods of study.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To evaluate whether events occurring at or around the time of birth contribute to the onset of psychotic illness in adult life. DESIGN-Pregnancy and birth complications as possible causes of adult mental illness were studied in the population sample of the British perinatal mortality survey. Subsequent psychiatric admissions were independently identified through the Mental Health Enquiry and records of regional and special health authorities. Logistic regression was used to compare data on perinatal deaths with those on survivors to determine factors independently associated with perinatal death, and this equation was then used to calculate the risk of perinatal death for each survivor. SUBJECTS--16,980 people born in a single week in 1958 (the British perinatal mortality survey sample), including 252 patients admitted to psychiatric care; case notes of 235 patients were supplied. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES AND RESULTS--Patients with a schizophrenic illness (whether defined by \"broad\" (n = 57) or \"narrow\" (n = 35) diagnostic criteria) did not have a greater mean risk of perinatal death than the population in general, but there was some evidence of increased liability (relative risk 2.43; 95% confidence interval 1.17 to 5.05) for those with affective psychosis (n = 32). Specific high risk variables for affective psychosis were decreased gestation time (273.9 v 281.2 days; mean difference 7.3 days, 95% confidence interval 3.1 to 11.5; p less than 0.002) and prescription of vitamin K to the child in the first week of life (19% of patients v 5% of controls, p = 0.016). CONCLUSIONS--The findings give no support to theories that factors predicting perinatal mortality contribute significantly to causation of schizophrenic illness. Further investigation of decreased gestation length in relation to affective disorder is required.\r"

  ".U": "91308784\r", 
  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To estimate the financial effect of random yearly variations in need for services on fundholding practices with various list sizes. DESIGN--A simulation model was derived using historical data on general practitioner referrals for the 113 surgical procedures covered by the general practitioner fund, combined with data on the hospital prices for those procedures. PATIENTS--Resident population of Central Birmingham Health Authority. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Expected expenditure on the relevant surgical procedures for the whole district and for practices with list sizes of 9000, 12,000, 15,000, 18,000, 21,000, or 24,000 for each of 100 simulated years. RESULTS--By using average hospital prices for the West Midlands region the mean (SD) annual expenditure for the 179,400 residents was 4,832,471 pounds (87,149 pounds); the random variation between the 5th and 95th most expensive years was 5.7% of the mean cost. For a practice with a list size of 9000 the values were 244,891 pounds (18,349 pounds), with a variation of 27.5%. With a list size of 24,000 the values were 652,762 pounds (32,512 pounds), with a variation of 15.3%. CONCLUSIONS--Random variations in need for inpatient services will have a significant financial impact on the practice fund. The problem will be particularly great for smaller practices. Additional measures are required to ensure that the scheme is not undermined and that the potential benefits are secured.\r"

  ".W": "The historic development of breast cancer staging began early in the 20th century with the simple concept of early localized disease, spread to regional nodes, and the presence of distant metastases. This last group often was divided into patients with advanced but perhaps still curable locoregional disease and incurable patients with distant metastases. As increasing numbers of prognostic factors were recognized, efforts were made to incorporate them into the staging systems to combine patients with similar prognosis into the same stages. These attempts resulted in the development of four classifications, namely, the Columbia, Manchester, International, and American tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) staging systems. Although many benefits of staging were reported, the most important was that of permitting valid comparisons between different treatments and different institutions. Many success-limiting factors were noticed during the developmental years, and even though the TNM system has been accepted, numerous speakers and authors present their staged data in a confusing and ambiguous manner. Recommendations are made that would permit clarification of presentations to general medical audiences along with recognizable statistical validity.\r"

  ".W": "Among 35 patients with relapsed or refractory acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) who received salvage chemotherapy, 28 were treated with mitoxantrone (7.5 mg/m2/d intravenously [IV] over 1 hour for 5 days) and etoposide (VP-16) (2 g/m2 over 4 days either as a daily infusion or as two daily doses). Seven patients received mitoxantrone (6 mg/m2/d for 5 days) and VP-16 (1500 mg/m2 over 3 days). The median duration of the initial complete remission (CR) was 6 months and 83% of the patients had initial CR that lasted 12 months or less. Forty-six percent of the patients were undergoing a second or subsequent salvage attempt. Eight patients (23%) achieved CR; seven of these CR were obtained after one course of therapy. Twelve patients (33%) died and 15 patients (42%) had disease that was resistant to treatment. Patients undergoing a first salvage attempt had a higher incidence rate of CR than those undergoing a second or subsequent salvage attempt (37% versus 6%; P = 0.03). CR rates were also higher in patients with a favorable (translocation 8;21 or 15;17) or diploid karyotype compared with other patients (32% versus 8%; P = 0.10). The median survival time was 2 months for all patients and 8 months for patients achieving CR. Mucositis occurred in 74% of the patients and was severe in 32%. Diarrhea and rash occurred in less than 33% of the patients. Fever was noticed in all but 1 of the patients and documented infections occurred in 65% of the patients. Six patients had pancytopenia or thrombocytopenia that lasted more than 42 days from the initiation of treatment. Although mitoxantrone and high-dose VP-16 is an effective antileukemic regimen, it is associated with a high incidence of mucositis. Strategies that are used to limit mucosal damage may improve the tolerance of this combination.\r"

Because an in vitro study showed that these two agents combined had a synergistic antiproliferative effect on MOLT-4 and WI-38VA13 cell lines, the authors evaluated the clinical efficacy of this combination in a pilot study with a poor-risk group of ATLL patients. The patients were treated daily with 6 x 10(6) IU of HLBI subcutaneously and 100 mg of bestrabucil orally. In patients with lymphoma-type ATLL or hypercalcemia, prednisolone also was given daily. Of 12 patients suitable for evaluation, nine had partial responses, one had a minor response, and two had no response. All five patients with skin infiltration and both patients with hypercalcemia responded. A history of prior chemotherapy did not affect the response rate. The time to clinical response was 3 to 16 days (median, 11 days) after initiation of treatment. The response duration was 4 to 108+ weeks (median, 9 weeks), but all patients except one relapsed, even during continuing treatment. No serious side effects were observed. Although the response rate with this combination treatment was high, the response duration was short, and other treatments would have to be added to achieve control of this aggressive disease.\r"

  ".W": "Pulmonary toxicity may complicate the treatment of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). The possible drug-related cause of pulmonary toxicity was investigated retrospectively in 207 NHL patients treated between 1981 and 1988 with three regimens containing cyclophosphamide with and without methotrexate or bleomycin: methotrexate, calcium, leucovorin, bleomycin, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and dexamethasone (m-BACOD) (n = 134); methotrexate, calcium, leucovorin, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and dexamethasone (m-ACOD) (n = 43); or cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (CHOP) (n = 30) chemotherapy. These regimens contained the same drugs and were administered in the same schedule; the regimens differed primarily in the addition of bleomycin or methotrexate. Pulmonary toxicity occurred in 24 of 134 (18%) m-BACOD-treated and in six of 43 (14%) m-ACOD-treated patients (P = 0.65). Chest radiography revealed diffuse pulmonary infiltrates in 16 (67%) and six (100%) of the m-BACOD-treated and m-ACOD-treated patients with pulmonary toxicity, respectively. None of the CHOP-treated patients had pulmonary toxicity. The clinical features of pulmonary toxicity and the amount of chemotherapy administered before it occurred did not differ in patients treated with m-BACOD or m-ACOD, although the toxicity tended to be more severe in the m-BACOD group. Open lung or transbronchial biopsies done in six (38%) of the m-BACOD-treated and three (50%) of the m-ACOD-treated patients with pulmonary infiltrates revealed nonspecific pneumonitis compatible with drug-related toxicity. In summary, these results showed that pulmonary toxicity during m-BACOD and m-ACOD therapy occurred with similar frequency and clinicopathologic features. This suggested that bleomycin was not responsible uniquely for the pulmonary toxicity in m-BACOD-treated patients. That pulmonary toxicity was not observed in patients treated with CHOP suggested that methotrexate may play an important role in the pathogenesis of the pulmonary toxicity.\r"

The NC included three cycles of cisplatin (75 mg/m2 on day 1), epirubicin (100 mg/m2 on day 1), and etoposide (120 mg/m2 on days 1, 3, and 5), every 3 weeks. All patients showed a partial response (greater than 50%) and underwent complete (n = 4) or incomplete (gross [n = 1] or microscopic [n = 2] residual tumor) surgical resection. Histologic examination was negative for two completely resected patients. Projected 2-year survival was 80%; all patients but one currently are alive and disease-free. This approach appeared to be feasible and may be a new therapeutic choice in the management of IT, but its use on a regular basis should be reserved until a larger number of patients and longer follow-up are available.\r"

  ".W": "Between August 1983 and March 1985, a randomized study was conducted that compared cisplatin (CDDP) (80 mg/m2 on day 1) alone with CDDP plus vindesine (VDS) (3 mg/m2 on days 1, 8, and 15) in 160 consecutive patients with inoperable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). There were no complete responses. The response rate for CDDP plus VDS (22 of 77 patients, 29%) was significantly higher than that for CDDP alone (9 of 78 patients, 12%) (P less than 0.05). However, no difference existed in the median duration of response (20 weeks for CDDP plus VDS versus 20 weeks for CDDP alone) or the median survival time (45 weeks for CDDP plus VDS versus 39 weeks for CDDP alone). No significant differences in toxicity were detected between the two arms; myelosuppression, alopecia, and peripheral neuropathy occurred more frequently with CDDP plus VDS and there was one lethal episode of hepatorenal syndrome in the CDDP plus VDS arm. Among the variables Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS), age, sex, stage, weight loss, serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level, albumin level, histologic cell type, and chemotherapy arm, only chemotherapy arm was a significant factor leading to a major response (P = 0.019, multiple logistic regression analysis). The significant predictors of survival were PS (P = 0.000), sex (P = 0.000), and stage (P = 0.002) (Cox's proportional hazards model), with a PS of 0 or 1, female sex, and lower stage yielding the best survival. Although a significantly higher response rate was obtained in the combination arm than in the single agent arm, the survival benefit to patients receiving such combination chemotherapy was not determined and more effective chemotherapy regimens are required.\r"

Seven of the 14 patients responded to the high-dose BCNU (50% response with 95% confidence limits ranging from 23% to 77%). Three patients had a complete response, and four had a partial response. Regrowth of tumor occurred within 60 days of treatment in the responding patients. Death occurred in six patients before the recovery of the platelet count to 50,000 cells/microliters. Although the response rate was high, the toxicity was excessive. In the dosage range of 600 to 1000 mg/m2 in heavily pretreated patients, BCNU is not recommended, but additional investigation may be warranted in patients with central nervous system metastases who previously were treated with radiation therapy.\r"

Sixty-four patients (70%) received 2 or 3 preoperative courses and 28 (30%) received 4 or more. Sixty-two specimens were available for pathologic examination to assess the degree of tumor necrosis. More than 90% tumor destruction was observed in 16 of 42 patients (38%) who received 1 to 3 preoperative courses as opposed to 17 of 20 (85%) who received 4 or more courses. Patients who received 4 or more courses had a 2-fold probability of achieving more than 90% tumor necrosis, and 68% underwent conservative surgery. Of those who received 3 or less courses, 23% underwent conservative surgery. Postoperatively, patients were treated with intravenous (IV) CDP alternating with doxorubicin (ADR) (Adriamycin, Adria Laboratories, Columbus, OH). Pulmonary metastases developed in 36 patients, bone metastases in 2, and local recurrence in 6. Two patients died of cardiac failure without evidence of disease. Thus, 46 patients (50%) were continuously free of disease 18 to 78 months after diagnosis. Univariate and multivariate analyses showed that male sex, low grade preoperative chemotherapy-induced necrosis, and nonosteoblastic histologic condition were prognostic factors predictive of recurrence, while male sex and large tumor size were prognostic factors predictive of death. These results are comparable with those reported by other centers and are superior to our previous experiences that yielded survival rates of 5% to 10%. A substantial number of patients also had the opportunity to achieve tumor removal with conservative surgery.\r"

All but 3 patients received 3 or 4 courses (24 patients received 4 courses) of CDDP at a dosage of 120 to 150 mg/m2 given over 6 hours every 2 weeks by IA infusion. Patients younger than 18 years of age received the higher dose of CDDP. Treatment was well tolerated with combination antiemetics. One patient experienced severe hearing loss with the first cycle of the higher CDDP dose. Pathologic evaluation of resected osteosarcoma showed a favorable response (90% or greater necrosis) in 8 of 20 evaluable cases and in 3 of 4 patients with malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH) of bone (without osteoid). In soft tissue sarcomas, minimal (50% to 89%) necrosis was seen in two of nine cases and none had 90% or greater necrosis. Patients received postoperative chemotherapy based on pathologic response, but the value of this postoperative adjuvant therapy requires further follow-up and is uncertain in this small study. IA CDDP can often cause significant tumor necrosis in patients with bone sarcomas, whereas soft tissue sarcomas are less sensitive to this therapy.\r"

A previous report of the 5-FU plus LCV infusion established optimal dosages of 200 mg/m2/d and 5 mg/m2/d, respectively, for each agent. Oral HU was added to the regimen in total dosages of 0.5 g/d, 1.0 g/d, 1.5 g/d, or 2.0 g/d. Twenty-two patients received a total of 45 courses of treatment. Stomatitis was the dose-limiting side effect; it occurred in 3 of 14 courses with HU at 0.5 g/d (21%) and 9 of 17 courses with HU at 1.0 g/d (53%). Dosage escalation to 1.5 g/d or 2.0 g/d was possible in only 3 of 22 patients (17%). The median time to stomatitis was 10 days (range, 7 to 12 days). One response was observed in this heavily pretreated population. Phase II trials of HU plus LCV dual modulation of infusional 5-FU should use initial HU dosages of 0.5 g/d for the 14-day regimen described, with dose escalation as tolerated. Variable oral absorption presumably accounts for the small group of patients who can tolerate the higher doses of HU.\r"

  ".W": "Multivariate analyses of the clinical course of 1537 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) identified a subgroup which experienced short remission duration and a high incidence of extramedullary relapse. The patients differed from other ALL patients by the presence at diagnosis of two or more of a constellation of clinical and laboratory features: organomegaly or mass disease, E-rosette positivity, hemoglobin level greater than 10 g/dl, leukocyte count greater than 50,000/microliters, male predominance, and older age. This type of presentation of ALL is referred to as the \"lymphoma syndrome\" (LS) since such patients exhibit a pattern of several clinical and laboratory features which were observed repeatedly but in differing combinations, and some of which clinically resemble lymphoma. A subsequent database from 2231 patients was analyzed. Patients with a mediastinal mass, massive splenomegaly, or massive adenopathy, alone or in combination, had a worse outcome when the patient also had either leukocytosis, E-rosette-positive lymphoblasts, or a normal or near normal hemoglobin (Hb) level at diagnosis. Similarly, the above three laboratory features alone or in combination did not predict less than 40% disease-free survival (DFS) unless they were accompanied by at least one of the clinical features of mass disease. When at least one clinical feature and at least one laboratory feature were present, the overall DFS was 36% 6 years after diagnosis versus 64% for all other patients. The association of these features with poor prognosis remained significant after adjusting for the level of leukocyte count at diagnosis, age at diagnosis, and sex of the patients. Patients with this recurrent syndrome of features do not represent a homogeneous biologic entity but they constitute a subgroup of patients with ALL having a high risk of treatment failure using current therapies, including failure to achieve remission, early relapse, and increased frequency of relapse in extramedullary sites. They deserve early recognition at diagnosis and selection of treatment strategies appropriate for very high risk ALL.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of surgical removal of \"primary\" tumors on the cytokinetics of local tumor remnants, secondary implants, and metastases was investigated in three different rat tumor models in the Wag/Rij rat: a slow-growing (MCR83) and a fast-growing (EMR86) hormone-dependent mammary tumor and a rapidly, but autonomously growing carcinoma (MCR86). The latter two tumors had metastatic potential. Cell kinetic studies were done using in vivo labeling with 5'-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd). Thirty-three hours after removal of a subcutaneous MCR83 flank tumor, secondary implants showed a significant (P less than 0.05) but transient increase in the BrdUrd labeling index (LI). A more rapid and prolonged increase, lasting for at least 7 days, was observed in EMR86 lymph node and lung metastases. In both models, no effect was observed after sham surgery (consisting of opening and closing of the skin under anesthesia). Removal of MCR86 tumors (growing in the hind leg muscle) also resulted in a rapid, transient LI increase in metastases. Continuous BrdUrd labeling experiments in this tumor model did not favor the hypothesis that the LI increase predominantly resulted from an increase in the growth fraction. Moreover, in this model, the effect was related to operation trauma. A similar increase in LI, although smaller than after tumor removal, was seen after major surgical trauma in MCR83 flank tumors. These results indicate that in the rat, tumor removal and/or major surgical trauma may modulate the cytokinetics of distant metastases significantly. A study of the systemic, possibly endocrine, factors involved in the growth-stimulating effect of surgical trauma in these rat tumor models may help to assess the clinical relevance of these findings for patients with breast cancer.\r"

Incorporation of carbon-14-thymidine was measured in unstimulated monocyte-depleted lymphocyte cultures, and in cultures activated by concanavalin A (Con-A) before institution of therapy in all patients. Total blood lymphocytes and T-cell subsets were enumerated in the last 108 patients. Patients had significantly decreased total (CD3+, CD4+, CD8+) and relative (CD3+, CD4+) T-cell counts compared with healthy controls. Stage IV patients tended to have lower total lymphocyte and subset counts than remaining patients. However, significantly reduced total lymphocyte and CD8+ counts were only observed in comparison to patients in clinical stage II. Thirty-three percent of patients had an increased spontaneous and a decreased Con-A-induced blood lymphocyte DNA synthesis. Functional lymphocyte abnormalities were related to advanced clinical stage, high age, mixed cellularity, and lymphocyte depletion histopathology and presence of B symptoms. The 10-year survival of patients in this group was 36%, compared with 62% for the remainder. In a multivariate analysis of the whole series lymphocyte DNA synthesis was besides age the strongest predictor of prognosis. In univariate analyses of the second patient series total lymphocyte, T-cell and subset counts were related to prognosis. These relatively simple lymphocyte functional tests may help to identify young HD patients for whom intensive cytoreductive therapy with or without autologous stem cell support may be the best therapeutic option.\r"

Benign tumors typically were statin positive with labeling indices (LI) between 22% and 96%: acoustic schwannomas (n = 3, mean = 29.9 +/- 19.4%); meningiomas (n = 4, mean = 59.0 +/- 15.1%); pituitary adenomas (n = 3, mean = 79.9 +/- 28.2%), and an epidermoid cyst (41.0%). By contrast, the statin LI of 18 of 24 (75%) malignant brain tumors was less than or equal to 2%: medulloblastomas (n = 7, mean = 0.3 +/- 0.2%); anaplastic astrocytomas (n = 3, mean = 1.6 +/- 2.7%); glioblastomas (n = 10, mean = 10.3 +/- 14.4%); metastatic carcinomas (n = 3, mean = 3.0 +/- 4.6); and a germinoma (0.2%). The vascular endothelium among diverse tumors typically was statin positive. All 21 tumors with a statin LI less than 10% were malignant, and all nine tumors with a statin LI greater than 40% were benign. The statin LI of benign tumors (n = 11, mean = 55.1 +/- 26.7%) was significantly higher than that of the malignant tumors (n = 24, mean = 5.2 +/- 10.5%, P less than 0.001). The absence of statin expression is a new way to determine the malignancy of human brain tumors. The statin LI may be useful to guide the prognosis and treatment of individual patients. The mechanisms that control statin expression are important in therapy seeking to shift the proliferating, cycling cells to the quiescent, G0 compartment.\r"

From a panel of antibodies, those identifying basic fibroblast growth factor and insulin-like growth factor I, formerly known as somatomedin C, were strongly immunoreactive within the neuroepithelial cell population of the tumors. Immunoblots of purified recombinant basic fibroblast growth factor and insulin-like growth factor I showed antibody specificity without cross-reactivity. In controls, immunostaining of tissue sections was abolished by preabsorption of primary antibodies with the appropriate growth factor polypeptide antigen. Preabsorption with inappropriate growth factor did not reduce the intensity or alter the distribution of staining. The congruent histologic patterns of immunoreactivities suggest that more than one type of growth factor may be produced by the neuroepithelial component of medulloepithelioma. These growth factors may stimulate proliferation and differentiation of tumor cells by autocrine molecular mechanisms.\r"

If only strongly positive reactions were considered, more than 50% of the tumors would be interpreted as negative for S-100 protein and NSE. Nevi stained with less intensity than melanomas using all three antibodies. The expression of HMB-45 appeared to be greater in active nevi than in inactive nevi. There was a weak association between S-100 protein reactivity and the ability of the uveal melanomas to metastasize (P = 0.1); however, the standard deviation of nucleolar area was a much better predictor (P = 0.02). These results indicate that pathologists will find HMB-45 to be a useful tool in differentiating uveal melanoma from nonmelanocytic tumors.\r"

The rates of high ploidy in the free-cell, small nest, and large nest types were 23.1%, 48.0%, and 66.7%, respectively, with a significant increase according to the degree of aggregation. The high ploidy group and large nest type had a higher incidence of lymphogenous and hematogenous metastasis than the low ploidy group and free-cell type, respectively. DNA ploidy had no prognostic value for the free-cell type of tumor, but differences in prognosis and the incidence of metastasis between the DNA ploidies were evident in the nest-forming type. Aneuploid tumors consisting of a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma were those with nest formation, from the standpoint of histologic structure and metastatic behavior. The DNA analysis of poorly differentiated adenocarcinomas was of prognostic value, especially in the nest-forming type.\r"

Thirty-five had systemic non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), and ten had Hodgkin's disease (HD). Histologically, 27 NHL cases were intermediate grade (five cases) or high grade (22 cases, 14 of the small noncleaved cell type), according to the Working Formulation. Eight NHL cases, including four anaplastic large cell (ALC) BerH2 (CD30)-positive lymphomas, were in the miscellaneous group. Immunohistologic and/or gene rearrangement analysis showed the B-cell origin of 20 of the 24 NHL cases studied. At presentation, 71% of NHL patients had advanced stages (Stage III or IV), and 85% had extranodal disease (predominantly gastrointestinal tract and marrow). Of the 23 patients evaluable for treatment, only seven had a complete clinical response after lymphoma therapy; the median survival of 34 evaluable patients was 22 months after the diagnosis of NHL. Fifteen patients died; most deaths were attributable to progressive lymphoma and opportunistic infections. As with NHL, advanced disease, extranodal involvement, aggressive histologic findings, and poor response to therapy were also observed in patients with HD. This study shows that lymphoid neoplasias occurring in Italian IVDU with HIV infection and those previously reported in North American homosexual men with HIV infection share similar clinicopathologic features. However, some features such as the absence of history of Kaposi's sarcoma at diagnosis, the lack of detection of primary brain and rectal NHL, and the occurrence of B-cell ALC BerH2 (CD30)-positive NHL were observed uniquely in this series of patients.\r"

There were 73 male and 53 female patients (mean age, 50 +/- 12 years). Before surgery, 56% of the patients (70 of 124) had headaches, 74% (94 of 126) had deterioration of vision, and 12% (15 of 126) had ophthalmoplegia. Endocrine evaluation revealed the presence of hypogonadism in 75% (87 of 115), adrenal insufficiency in 36% (46 of 126), and hypothyroidism in 18% (21 of 122). Plasma prolactin was increased in 65% (56 of 86) with a mean level of 39 +/- 14 micrograms/l (normal, 3 to 20 micrograms/l). Radiologic enlargement of the sella turcica was documented in all cases: 67% (84 of 126) had enclosed and 33% (42 of 126) had invasive adenomas. After surgery, vision was normalized or improved in 75% (71 of 94) of the patients. Thyroid, adrenal, and gonadal functions were improved in 14% (three of 22), 41% (19 of 46), 11% (ten of 87), were unchanged in 82% (100 of 122), 77% (97 of 126), 89% (102 of 115), and worsened in 15% (19 of 22), 8% (ten of 126), 3% (102 of 115), respectively.

  ".W": "Four hundred fifteen patients with metastatic breast cancer with known hormone receptor status received primary treatment with tamoxifen. Measured values for the estrogen receptor (ER, i.e., with estrogen binding) followed a continuous distribution (range, 3 to 1000 fmol/mg of protein). These values correlated positively with age. The response to treatment with tamoxifen correlated with the ER level, with response rates of approximately 80% when the ER level was greater than 30.1 fmol/mg of protein. Two hundred eighteen (218 of 415, 52%) patients had progesterone receptor (PR) values greater than 10 fmol/mg. The PR positivity correlated with the ER level. Patients with PR levels greater than 10 fmol/mg of protein (124 of 226, 55%) had a significantly higher response rate than those with values less than 10 fmol/mg of protein (45 of 189, 24%). However, in a multivariate analysis including both receptor levels, age, site, and number of metastases, only the ER level was significant in predicting the response to treatment with tamoxifen. A quantitative estimation of the ER level thus is the best predictor of response to hormonal treatment with tamoxifen for advanced breast cancer.\r"

  ".W": "It is generally accepted that adenomatous polyps represent the natural precursor of many colorectal malignancies. The sequence, however, which leads from a normally appearing mucosa to cancer is complex and involves many steps, including a hyperproliferative mucosa with an upward expansion of the replicative compartment. The current study evaluates cell replication in normal colorectal mucosa of patients with adenomatous polyps of various types and relates the observed findings to the main clinical and morphologic features of adenomas. Forty-four patients with polyps and 27 controls entered the study. Samples of colorectal mucosa were taken at endoscopy and cell replication was evaluated with a standard autoradiographic procedure. Cell replication was expressed as labeling index (LI), in the whole crypt and in each of the five longitudinal compartments in which the crypts were divided. Total LI and LI per crypt compartment were significantly higher (P less than 0.02 and P less than 0.01, respectively) than in controls. There was no appreciable difference of LI values between patients with single or multiple, tubular or tubulovillous, small or large adenomas, but in all of these subgroups LI was significantly higher than in controls. In conclusion, in normally appearing colorectal mucosa of patients with adenomatous polyps there was a significant increase of cell replication and a marked upward expansion of the proliferative zone; these changes were more evident in the left colon and in the rectum. Finally, cell replication did not seem to be related to the number of polyps, to the most common histotypes, or to the pattern of recurrence.\r"

Patients with diploid tumors had a higher survival rate than those with nondiploid tumors (P less than 0.001). The proliferation index (the sum of the percent of cells in S-phase plus those in G2M phase) was also a strong prognostic factor (P less than 0.001). The ploidy and proliferation data were combined, and the patients in the favorable group (diploid and low proliferative index) had a 5-year survival of 74% compared with 54% for the unfavorable group (high proliferative index or nondiploid, P less than 0.001). This grouping was prognostic for survival in B2 (P less than 0.001), C (P = 0.013), colon (P less than 0.001), and rectal (P = 0.026) patient subsets. This study indicates that cell kinetic parameters are important and independent prognostic factors for Stages B2 and C colorectal cancer.\r"

CSH, a voluminous hepatic metastasis of a primary bronchial carcinoid tumor (CSB) was resected and transplanted into three irradiated nude (Swiss-nu/nu) mice both by subcutaneous (SC) and intramuscular (IM) routes; the success rate was five of six. Heterotransplanted tumors took 4 to 5 months to appear in the mice and 1 month to attain a width of 0.5 cm. Both human and mouse tumors (named CSH-SC and CSH-IM) were studied by light and electron microscopy. They were Grimelius-positive, neuron-specific enolase-positive, and bombesin-negative by immunocytochemistry. Furthermore, CSH-SC cells presented characteristic (pear-shaped, rod-shaped, or tadpole-shaped) neurosecretory granules. Although CSB and CSH were slightly serotonin positive by immunocytochemistry, only a few serotonin-positive cells were found in CSH-SC and none in CSH-IM, suggesting partial loss of differentiation or an increase in serotonin catabolism during transplantation.\r"

The authors report a complete esophageal obstruction in a 21-year-old man, 14 years after chemo-radiation therapy for Hodgkin's lymphoma. Although endoscopy failed to demonstrate a gross morphologic abnormality, an esophagogram detected abnormal peristalsis and stricture, and esophageal manometry coupled with dynamic isotopic study clearly demonstrated a multilevel secondary neuronal damage. Data in the literature suggest that alteration in motility is by far the most frequent radiologic manifestation. Further prospective studies will probably clarify the actual incidence of late esophageal damage after chemo-radiation therapy.\r"

To decide the cutoff level of urinary pepsinogen I after total gastrectomy, urine samples from 15 patients who had undergone total gastrectomy for stomach cancer in the early or advanced stages and had been free from recurrence for more than 5 years were examined by pepsinogen I-specific radioimmunoassay. The mean concentration of urinary pepsinogen I was 17.5 +/- 7.4 ng/ml and the cutoff level of urinary pepsinogen after total gastrectomy was set at 32 ng/ml (mean + 2 SD). Twenty-two of 74 cases who had undergone total gastrectomy for stomach cancer were regarded as positive. And 20 of these 22 positive cases had definite clinical signs of recurrence of stomach cancer. There were only two false-positive cases. These results suggest that urinary pepsinogen I will be an useful tumor marker in detecting the recurrence of stomach cancer after total gastrectomy.\r"

The incidence of maldescensus testis was not found to be higher than in patients with unilateral disease. The histologic findings of the first tumor did not have any effect on the incidence of the second tumor. In 21 patients (four synchronous and 17 sequential tumors), histocompatibility antigens (HLA) were determined; HLA-B14 was increased significantly in the sequential tumor group. Tendencies toward an increase of HLA-DR5 and HLA-DR7 also were found. The HLA-DR1, HLA-DR3, and HLA-DR4 showed a tendency toward a decreased frequency. Therefore genetic factors might be important in the development of sequential bilateral testicular cancers.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this article has been to summarize the existing body of literature on the changes in the function of muscle and bone that occur as a consequence of aging. Throughout this article, the importance of distinguishing between aging and disuse has been a recurring theme. Much of what had previously been considered aging is now regarded as functional disuse. With aging, muscle undergoes a reduction in size, and consequently strength, which is related to a loss of muscle fibers and a reduction in the size of existing fibers. There may be a selective loss of the Type II, or fast twitch fibers, but this is still under debate. This loss of muscle fibers is more than likely related to the loss of functional motor units. Muscle strength is reduced as a consequence of these changes, but there appears to be little loss in the metal olic potential of the muscle with aging. Exercise training can increase the size and strength of the trained muscles through hypertrophy of both Type I and II fibers and neural alterations but appears to have little effect on decreasing fiber number. Losses of bone start in the third and fourth decade of life, but the pattern of bone loss differs between cortical and trabecular bone, the former being less influenced by menstrual status. Exercise training appears to attenuate the normal decreases in bone with aging and can even lead to small increases in bone density and mass.\r"
