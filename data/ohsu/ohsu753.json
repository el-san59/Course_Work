The proportion of slow muscle fibres was inversely related to fatness; at least 40% of the variability in fatness may be related to variation in muscle fibre type. Metabolic evidence in 50 men, provided by the respiratory exchange ratio (RER) during cycle ergometry, indicated that fatter men (or, in the subset of 11 men, those with a low proportion of slow muscle fibres) combusted less fat during work at 100 W than did lean men (or those with a high proportion of slow fibres). The effects of fitness and of body size were excluded in the analysis. The evidence supports the hypothesis that muscle fibre type is an aetiological factor for obesity.\r"

In contrast soluble gp120 inhibited antigen-driven proliferation, but this action was reversible and could be blocked by soluble CD4. Thus the chief mechanism of HIV pathogenesis may be gp120/CD4 interaction and HIV may be pathogenic mainly as a producer of gp120.\r"

  ".W": "Transient voice change associated with endotracheal intubation has generally been attributed to vocal fold trauma. To assess the role of altered vocal fold function in transient voice change, a study was designed to evaluate the audioacoustic, endoscopic, and laryngostroboscopic characteristics of the postintubation voice. Vocal function of 10 patients undergoing short-term outpatient surgical procedures using general anesthesia and endotracheal intubation were studied preoperatively and postoperatively. A second group of 10 patients that did not have surgery or general anesthesia was used as an age-matched control. Fundamental frequency, frequency perturbation, electroglottography, endoscopy (including laryngeal stroboscopy), and subjective speech analysis by experienced listeners were used to assess vocal function. No consistent differences in fundamental frequency were observed, although patient-to-patient variation was marked. Statistically significant increases in cycle-to-cycle fundamental frequency variation (jitter) were found postoperatively in the majority of the postintubation patients (P less than 0.05). Electroglottography, laryngeal endoscopy, and stroboscopic laryngoscopy did not demonstrate consistent changes in glottic mucosal function. Listener judgments characterized the postintubation voice change by decreased intensity, increased roughness, and lowered affect without consistent changes in pitch. The perception of decreased affect in the voices (characterized by reduction in pitch variation, vocal stress, and increases in pause times) was a strong perceptual marker for change in the post-intubation voice. Objective measures of laryngeal function suggest that the glottic contribution to postintubation voice change is minimal and that this dysphonia is probably multifactorial.\r"

This report describes 15 pediatric cases of lymphoma seen from 1981 to 1987 with an initial presentation in the head and neck. Cervical lymph nodes represented the initial site of involvement in 10 of the cases. The other five cases presented with disease in the tonsillar fossa; maxillary sinus and mandible; parotid; pharyngeal wall; trachea and thyroid gland; and ethmoid sinus, sphenoid sinus, and anterior fossa. The histologic type was non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in 12 cases and Hodgkin's lymphoma in 3 cases. Our experience has shown that lymphoma of the head and neck in children presents a confusing clinical picture and was initially confused with inflammatory disease, polymorphic reticulosis, and other neoplasms such as rhabdomyosarcoma. In one patient, Epstein-Barr virus infection and an inherited immunodeficiency state probably played a role in the pathogenesis of the lymphoma.\r"

Appropriate management of these children and their families requires an appreciation of the multifaceted developmental and educational challenges confronting deaf children, even after cochlear implantation. Evaluation results from 200 children with bilateral sensorineural deafness (63 severe/137 profound, anacusic, and fragmentary) reveal significant differences between these two subpopulations. Within the profoundly impaired group, important differences were also noted in the children's ability to benefit from conventional amplification, depending on residual hearing at or above 1000 Hz. Strategies for assessing auditory function and aided benefit in severely and profoundly hearing-impaired children must involve a pediatric test battery, serial evaluations, and parental cooperation/support. When selecting candidates for cochlear implantation, it is inappropriate to categorize severely hearing-impaired children with those children having profound sensorineural losses. Even profoundly impaired populations are not homogeneous, and rehabilitation potential with conventional amplification must be determined on an individual basis, over time.\r"

Sealing all routes of CSF drainage to the outside of the intracranial contents is essential. This is usually achieved with muscle and fat plugs, homograft dura, fascia, and suture. The use of a fibrin glue might affect and lessen the likelihood of a CSF leak. Eight clinical cases of various intracranial procedures using a simple, two-part patient autologous cryoprecipitate fibrinogen and bovine thrombin glue are described. Preliminary results of up to 1 year show no CSF leakage nor adverse reactions to the fibrin glue. The production method and material characteristics are briefly compared with other currently described autologous fibrin glue formulations. This version is similar in strength to other formulations, yet is simpler and more convenient to produce. The use of this autologous fibrin glue appears to provide an adjunct to commonly employed packing techniques in a convenient and effective manner. With more experience, fibrin glue might become an even more important tool in intracranial procedures.\r"

The specific mechanism of and structures involved in obstruction were clearly defined by videolaryngopharyngoscopy. Endoscopic microdissection and/or laser excision of the redundant supraglottic mucosa restored airway patency and completely relieved the obstructive respiratory symptoms. The pulsion effects of inspiratory airflow are postulated as the cause of these acquired lesions. Recommended treatment is reviewed.\r"

A study was undertaken to examine the benefits of the KTP-532 laser in a group of 31 patients who underwent tonsillectomy. One tonsil was removed with the KTP-532 laser and the other was excised with conventional dissection and snare technique. Patients were not told which tonsil was removed with the laser. Pain, healing, and intraoperative blood loss comparing one side to the other was assessed. On the evening of surgery, 83% of patients selected the side that underwent standard dissection and snare tonsillectomy as the most painful. By midweek, however, approximately equal numbers of patients selected the laser side as the most painful. At the end of 1 week, 63% of patients felt more pain on the laser dissection side. Possible reasons for these results are discussed. Intraoperative blood loss was significantly reduced with the use of the KTP-532 laser, but healing was not accelerated.\r"

Also, evoked suprathreshold responses deteriorated progressively and independently of the increase of compound action potential thresholds. A sudden (conductive) hearing loss and a poor response to suprathreshold stimulation might indicate inner ear damage secondary to a perilymphatic fistula.\r"

The most inferior portion of the basal turn of the scala tympani was not only inferior but also slightly anteriorly behind the RW membrane in more than half the cases. 3. The shortest distances from the aperture of the RW niche and from the margin of the RW to the stapes head were 2.38 +/- 0.33 and 2.15 +/- 0.22 mm, respectively. 4. The distance between the RW and the most inferior portion of the basal turn scala tympani was 5.15 +/- 0.34 mm. 5. The direction of the electrode advancement lay at a sharp angle to the inferior part of the RW (mean 31.9 +/- 3.6 degrees). 6. The direction from the RW to the most inferior portion of the basal turn scala tympani lay 16.0 +/- 5.3 degrees anteroinferior to the direction of the advancement of the electrode to the RW. 7. The distance between the margin of the RW and the basilar membrane of the cochlea was 0.58 +/- 0.10 mm at the superior aspect of the RW, and was 1.23 +/- 0.12 mm at the lateral aspect of the RW. 8. Dissecting away less than 1 mm (mean 0.7 +/- 0.27 mm) of the RW margin inferiorly or inferolaterally was enough to permit straight insertion of the electrode in most cases.\r"

  ".U": "90205594\r", 
  ".W": "A coronary artery fistula is an abnormal communication between a coronary artery and a cardiac chamber, great vessel, or other vascular structure. It is an infrequent but potentially important abnormality that can affect any age group. Most are congenital in origin, although other etiologies, in particular trauma, have been identified. Many are small and found incidentally during coronary arteriography, while others are identified as the cause of a continuous murmur, myocardial ischemia, congestive heart failure, or, rarely, bacterial endocarditis. The diagnosis should be considered in any patient presenting with a continuous murmur or in the setting of congestive heart failure, myocardial ischemia, or bacterial endocarditis without an obvious etiology. The pathophysiologic mechanisms resulting in symptoms include cardiac volume overload due to the shunting of blood and reduction of the myocardial blood supply due to \"coronary steal.\" The diagnosis of coronary artery fistula may be suggested by the finding of a continuous murmur in a precordial location, which is atypical for patent ductus arteriosus. Two-dimensional echocardiography may demonstrate dilated coronary arteries, and pulse-wave and color-flow Doppler examinations can display turbulent flow in the suspected fistula and its receiving chamber or vessel. Angiography is generally needed to confirm the diagnosis and elucidate anatomic detail. The natural history of coronary artery fistula is variable, with long periods of stability in some patients and gradual progression of symptoms in others. Small fistulas detected incidentally at the time of angiography do not require immediate surgical correction, but careful follow-up is indicated because the potential for enlargement with physiologically important shunting exists and cannot readily be predicted. Spontaneous closure is uncommon. Surgical repair of the fistula is recommended for symptomatic patients and for some without symptoms because a quantitatively small shunt does not predict freedom from future symptoms or complications. Those selected for medical management must be followed closely.\r"

Patients with the Felty syndrome had severe destructive arthritis, which progressed during follow-up despite little evidence of objective synovitis, and a higher frequency of extra-articular manifestations, including vasculitis. Bacterial infection tended to occur in patients with the lowest neutrophil count but continued to occur in some despite normalization of the WBC. Prognosis was poor and 8 deaths occurred, predominantly from sepsis. Serologic features were prominent. High titers of IgG rheumatoid factor and circulating immune complexes characterized patients with persistent neutropenia. A family history of rheumatoid arthritis was more common in patients with the Felty syndrome. The association with HLA DR4 was very strong; in addition there was an increased frequency of the DQw3 variant, 3b, suggesting that HLA Class II genes in linkage with DR4 may contribute to disease expression.\r"

The survivors were followed up for a median of 5.1 years. Approximately three-fourths of our patients had acute pericarditis, the remainder having recurrent acute pericarditis, chronic pericarditis with effusion, or chronic constrictive pericarditis. Most patients had symmetrical joint swelling, morning stiffness, subcutaneous nodules, rheumatoid factor, and classic radiographic changes of rheumatoid arthritis. Common extra-articular features included fatigue, loss of weight, and fever. Dyspnea or orthopnea, typical pericardial pain, peripheral edema, tachycardia, tachypnea, a diminished mean blood pressure, a pericardial friction rub, jugular venous distension, rales, radiographic evidence of cardiomegaly and pleural effusions, and abnormal echocardiograms were the most common cardiac manifestations. An elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and anemia were other common laboratory findings. Our cohort demonstrated decreased survival in comparison with an age- and sex-matched North Central white population (from the upper midwestern United States), especially during the first year after diagnosis. Increasing age, the presence of other heart disease, an increasing total number of other extra-articular manifestations of rheumatoid arthritis, jugular venous distention, and a lower mean blood pressure were associated with decreased survival.\r"

The purpose of this study has been to characterize the natural history of this chlorpromazine-induced (CPZ) immunopathy. To this end we carried out a prospective study of schizophrenic patients with the immunopathy to compare the effect of continuing CPZ versus switching to haloperidol therapy. Although no marked differences were noted between the 2 groups at the end of 5 years, 6 of 29 patients who continued to receive CPZ, as compared to none of 14 patients on haloperidol, had progressive elevations of serum IgM. In spite of a high incidence of antinuclear antibodies, none of the patients developed a lupus-like syndrome. One patient, however, who had been maintained on CPZ for more than 15 years, developed Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia, as characterized by an IgM monoclonal gammopathy and a lymphocyte immunoglobulin heavy and kappa light chain gene rearrangement. Another CPZ-treated patient developed immune thrombocytopenia. Based on the potential serious sequelae of prolonged stimulation of the immune system by CPZ, we recommend that patients who develop an increase in serum IgM while on CPZ be switched to other types of anti-psychotic medications.\r"

Electrodiagnostic studies provided evidence of an acquired demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy of recent onset. Motor conduction studies revealed abnormal temporal dispersion and partial conduction block. Preserved sural responses with abnormal median sensory conduction studies supported the diagnosis of Guillain-Barre syndrome, as did subsequent cerebrospinal fluid examinations documenting increasing total protein, identification of preceding cytomegalovirus injection with increasing serum convalescent titer, and progressive clinical improvement after a brief plateau. The role of electrodiagnosis in establishing the diagnosis and prognosis in Guillain-Barre syndrome is reviewed.\r"

The spasms were improved for approximately 3 months, and the effect was repeatable on reinjection. The spasms diminished only as long as the muscles were clinically weak, and spasms were observed electromyographically even though therapy eliminated the clinical spasms. Uninjected muscles continued to have spasms. Transmission of excitation from the zygomatic branch to the marginal mandibular branch of the facial nerve and vice versa in all patients was unaltered after therapy, but the amplitude of the response was decreased. The efficacy of botulinum toxin in hemifacial spasm appears to be related to the production of muscle weakness; there is no demonstrable effect on phenomena believed to be ectopic excitation or ephaptic transmission in the facial nerve.\r"

During the first stage of regeneration, i.e., within 2-3 weeks after surgery, a thin, filamentous structure consisting of fibrin and connective tissue was seen bridging the gap in all systems. Thereafter, this cord obviously served as a guideline for the outgrowth of increasing numbers of axons into distal nerve stumps as well as into muscle tissue, but not into fat tissue. These findings confirm that preatrophied muscle tissue has a similar \"neurotrophic\" effect on regenerating nerve fibers as distal nerve stumps. The ineffectivity of fat tissue in promoting nerve fiber regeneration could be attributed either to the absence of \"neurotrophic factors\" or even to an inhibitory effect.\r"

The anabolic effect was greatest in denervated muscles, where it was significantly more effective on the slow-twitch type. Clenbuterol significantly improved the contractile properties of denervated slow-twitch muscle, reverting them toward normal, but had little effect on contractile properties of denervated fast-twitch muscle. Such differential effects of clenbuterol must be taken into consideration in the evaluation of any future human intervention study.\r"

In addition, specific properties of intact fibers obtained from patients with various neuromuscular diseases were preserved in the resealed fiber segments prepared from the same patients or patients with the same diseases.

  ".W": "Fifty-four quantitative electromyographic (EMG) studies were made in 37 patients with inflammatory myopathy (IM) at different points in their clinical course and treatment. All studies were performed in the biceps brachii which varied in clinical strength. Motor unit action potentials (MUAPs) in 45 studies and EMG interference pattern (IP) in 48 studies were recorded using a concentric needle electrode. Macroelectromyographic (Macro-EMG) MUAPs were recorded from 10 patients in 14 studies. MUAP analysis revealed a myopathic pattern (decreased duration and/or area: amplitude ratio) in 69% of studies. IP analysis was more sensitive than MUAP analysis, demonstrating a myopathic pattern in 83% of studies. Macro-EMG MUAP amplitudes were reduced in two studies, minimally increased in one study and normal in the remainder; in 6 (40%) studies, fiber density was slightly increased. Thus, reinnervation does not seem to play an important role in motor unit remodeling in IM.\r"

The increase of contraction time is greater over the temperature range below 28 degrees C than above 29 degrees C. Skin temperature differs significantly from muscle temperature, showing about 3 degrees C lower values during cooling and up to 4 degrees C higher values during rewarming with radiant heat.\r"

However, polyphasic MUAPs of duration longer than 20% of the control mean, (long-duration polyphasic potentials, or LDPPs) may be seen. We therefore analyzed the incidence and meaning of LDPPs using quantitative MUAP analysis in 41 patients with different myopathies. The mean duration of all potentials was reduced in only 64% of patients because LDPPs increased the mean. When only simple potentials were considered, however, the mean duration was decreased in 95% of patients. This observation confirms the need to exclude LDPPs when calculating the mean duration of MUAPs for diagnosis. We found LDPPs most often in chronic polymyositis and in one patient with Becker Muscular Dystrophy. LDPPs are attributed to desynchronization of single-fiber potentials within the MUAP and may be due to slow conduction in regenerating muscle fibers.\r"

Erythromycin may thus have clinical application in patients with disturbances of gastroduodenal motility, such as diabetic gastroparesis. To examine this possibility, we studied the effect of erythromycin on gastric emptying in 10 patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and gastroparesis. We studied the emptying of liquids and solids simultaneously on separate days after the intravenous administration of erythromycin (200 mg) or placebo, using a double-isotope technique and a double-blind, crossover design. Erythromycin shortened the prolonged gastric-emptying times for both liquids and solids to normal. For example, 120 minutes after the ingestion of a solid meal, mean (+/- SE) retention was 63 +/- 9 percent with placebo and 4 +/- 1 percent with erythromycin, as compared with 9 +/- 3 percent in 10 healthy subjects. The corresponding values 120 minutes after the ingestion of a liquid meal were 32 +/- 4, 9 +/- 3, and 4 +/- 1 percent, respectively. Gastric emptying also improved, but to a lesser degree, in the 10 patients after four weeks of treatment with oral erythromycin (250 mg three times a day). These preliminary results suggest that erythromycin may have therapeutic value in patients with severe diabetic gastroparesis.\r"

To test this possibility we evaluated neurologic function by clinical examination, nerve conduction studies, and autonomic-function tests in patients with insulin-dependent (Type I) diabetes mellitus before and after successful pancreatic transplantation. Sixty-one patients were studied before and 12 months after transplantation, 27 again after 24 months, and 11 again after 42 months. A control group of patients with Type I diabetes treated with insulin underwent the same studies at similar intervals--48 patients before and after 12 months had elapsed, 21 again after 24 months, and 12 again after 42 months. In the control group, neuropathy tended to worsen during the follow-up period. The scores on the clinical examination indicated increased impairment after 12 months. Composite indexes of the degree of abnormality found on neurophysiologic testing of the function of peripheral motor, sensory, and autonomic nerves indicated decreased autonomic function after 12 months. The examination score and the three index values worsened slightly but not significantly in the patients followed for 24 and 42 months. In contrast, in the patients who had received pancreatic transplants, the neuropathy tended to improve. There was significant improvement in the motor and sensory indexes 12 months after transplantation and in the sensory index 24 months after transplantation. The other measures improved slightly but not significantly at these times, as did all four measures in the patients studied 42 months after transplantation. We conclude that the progression of diabetic polyneuropathy may be halted through the restoration of a euglycemic state by successful pancreatic transplantation.\r"

  ".W": "Because fetal hemoglobin contains gammaglobin chains instead of beta chains, it is not affected by the genetic defect that causes sickle cell disease. Increased levels of fetal hemoglobin decrease the tendency toward intracellular polymerization of sickle hemoglobin that characterizes this disease. Hydroxyurea is one of several cytostatic agents that have been shown to increase the production of fetal hemoglobin in some patients with sickle cell disease. We studied the effects of hydroxyurea administration in 10 hospitalized patients with sickle cell disease, each of whom was treated for three months. Seven patients responded with a 2- to 10-fold increase in fetal hemoglobin, from a mean (+/- SD) of 1.6 +/- 1.6 percent of total hemoglobin to 6.8 +/- 4.7 percent; three patients had fetal-hemoglobin levels of 10 to 15 percent of total hemoglobin. Three did not respond to treatment. Four of the patients who responded were retreated with hydroxyurea after one to four months without treatment and were found to have larger increases in fetal-hemoglobin levels. In most patients, levels were still rising at the end of the study, even after 90 days of therapy. Fetal-hemoglobin levels tended to peak at dosages of hydroxyurea that were myelosuppressive. In the patients who responded to treatment, there were significant increases in the percentage of reticulocytes and erythrocytes containing fetal hemoglobin and in the amount of fetal hemoglobin within these cells. The percentage of dense red cells decreased in the patients who responded to treatment. The tendency toward intracellular polymerization at physiologic oxygen saturation was reduced by about 33 percent in the cells containing fetal hemoglobin, whereas there was no change in the other cells. We conclude that hydroxyurea is effective in increasing the production of fetal hemoglobin, which in this study was found to be associated with a small decrease in hemolysis and an increase in hemoglobin levels despite myelosuppression. Controlled, prospective trials are necessary to establish whether these effects will lead to clinical benefit.\r"

We studied 367 women in southern Sweden who had undergone surgical resection for such cancer. Tumor specimens were analyzed with DNA flow cytometry in order to estimate both the DNA content (ploidy) and the fraction of cells in the synthetic phase of the cell cycle (S phase). The median duration of follow-up was four years; 28 percent of the patients received adjuvant therapy, usually with tamoxifen (n = 83). A multivariate analysis based on complete data on 250 patients included the following covariates: age (greater than or equal to 75, 50 to 74, and less than or equal to 49 years), tumor size (less than or equal to 20 vs. greater than 20 mm), concentration of estrogen and progesterone receptors (less than 10 vs. greater than or equal to 10 fmol per milligram of protein), ploidy (diploid vs. nondiploid), and S-phase category (fraction of cells in S phase: less than 7.0 percent, 7.0 to 11.9 percent, and greater than or equal to 12 percent). The S-phase fraction yielded the most prognostic information, followed by progesterone-receptor status and tumor size. A prognostic model based on these three variables identified 37 percent of the patients as constituting a high-risk group with a fourfold increased risk of distant recurrence. In the remaining 63 percent of the patients, the five-year overall survival rate (92 +/- 4 [+/- SE] percent) did not differ from the expected age-adjusted rate for Swedish women. We conclude that a prognostic index that includes indicators of the proliferative activity of tumor cells may be able to identify women with node-negative breast cancer in whom the risk of recurrence is sufficiently low that adjuvant chemotherapy can be avoided.\r"

  ".W": "Lipoprotein lipase is an enzyme in adipose tissue that hydrolyzes circulating triglycerides and thereby generates the fatty acids used in the synthesis of triglyceride in fat cells. To determine whether the activity and expression of lipoprotein lipase are affected by weight loss, we studied lipoprotein lipase in the adipose tissue of nine very obese subjects before and after a program of weight reduction. The subjects' mean (+/- SEM) initial weight was 136 +/- 7.3 kg, and the body-mass index (weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) ranged from 33.3 to 52.8 (mean, 43.0 +/- 2.5). Biopsies of adipose tissue were performed before weight loss and after it, when weight had been stable for three months. The weight reduction was achieved by a very-low-calorie diet (mean weight loss, 42.5 +/- 6.8 kg). After weight loss, the level of heparin-releasable lipoprotein lipase activity increased in all patients, from 3.8 +/- 1.1 to 7.1 +/- 1.6 neq of free fatty acid released per minute per 10(6) cells (P less than 0.05). In addition, the amount of lipoprotein lipase immunoreactive protein increased from 6.3 +/- 1.7 to 24.4 +/- 6.9 ng per 10(6) cells (P less than 0.05), and there was also an increase in the level of lipoprotein lipase messenger RNA as measured by Northern blotting. There was a strongly positive correlation between the initial body-mass index and the magnitude of the increase in lipoprotein lipase activity (r = 0.80, P less than 0.01) and immunoreactive protein (r = 0.92, P less than 0.01). We conclude that weight loss in very obese subjects leads to the increased activity and expression of lipoprotein lipase, thereby potentially enhancing lipid storage and making further weight loss more difficult.\r"

  ".W": "Health Stop is a major chain of ambulatory care centers operating for profit. Until 1985 its physicians were paid a flat hourly wage. In the middle of that year, a new compensation plan was instituted to provide doctors with financial incentives to increase revenues. Physicians could earn bonuses the size of which depended on the gross incomes they generated individually. We compared the practice patterns of 15 doctors, each employed full time at a different Health Stop center in the Boston area, in the same winter months before and after the start of the new arrangement. During the periods compared, the physicians increased the number of laboratory tests performed per patient visit by 23 percent and the number of x-ray films per visit by 16 percent. The total charges per month, adjusted for inflation, grew 20 percent, mostly as a result of a 12 percent increase in the average number of patient visits per month. The wages of the seven physicians who regularly earned the bonus rose 19 percent. We conclude that substantial monetary incentives based on individual performance may induce a group of physicians to increase the intensity of their practice, even though not all of them benefit from the incentives.\r"

In a 12.3-year prospective study of 892 men in a cohort of patients with psoriasis who had been treated with oral methoxsalen (8-methoxypsoralen) and ultraviolet A photochemotherapy (PUVA), we identified 14 patients (1.6 percent) with 30 genital neoplasms. The standard morbidity ratio (which was used as a measure of the risk of a genital neoplasm) comparing morbidity among patients treated with PUVA with that expected on the basis of population incidence data was 95.7 (95 percent confidence interval, 43.8 to 181.8) for invasive squamous-cell carcinoma of the penis and scrotum, and 58.8 (26.9 to 111.7) for invasive and in situ penile tumors. In patients exposed to high levels of PUVA, the incidence of invasive squamous-cell carcinoma was 286 times that in the general population and 16.3 times that in patients exposed to low levels (P less than 0.001 for both comparisons). After controlling for the level of exposure to PUVA, we found that patients exposed to high levels of ultraviolet B radiation had a risk of genital tumors 4.6 times higher than that in other patients (95 percent confidence interval, 1.4 to 15.1). The strongly dose-dependent increase in the risk of genital tumors associated with exposure to PUVA and ultraviolet B radiation that we observed makes it prudent for men to use genital protection whenever they are exposed to PUVA or other forms of ultraviolet radiation for therapeutic, recreational, or cosmetic reasons.\r"

To identify criteria for distinguishing zidovudine-induced myopathy from that caused by primary HIV infection, we reviewed the histochemical, immunocytochemical, and electron-microscopical features of muscle-biopsy specimens from 20 HIV-positive patients with myopathy (15 of whom had been treated with zidovudine) and compared the findings with the patients' clinical course and response to various therapies. Among the zidovudine-treated patients, the myopathy responded to prednisone in four, to the discontinuation of zidovudine in eight, and to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in two. Numerous \"ragged-red\" fibers, indicative of abnormal mitochondria with paracrystalline inclusions, were found in the biopsy specimens from the zidovudine-treated patients but not in those from the other patients. The number of these fibers appeared to correlate with the severity of the myopathy. All the patients, regardless of whether they had been treated with zidovudine, had inflammatory myopathy characterized by degenerating fibers, cytoplasmic bodies, and endomysial infiltrates consisting of CD8+ cells (mean +/- SD, 60.7 +/- 6.4 percent) and macrophages (39.2 +/- 6.4 percent) associated with Class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC-I) antigens (HLA-A, -B, and -C antigens) in the muscle fibers. The numbers and percentages of CD8+ cells and macrophages were similar in both the zidovudine-treated and the untreated HIV-positive patients. Specimens obtained on repeat muscle biopsy from two patients in whom the myopathy responded to the discontinuation of zidovudine showed remarkable histologic improvement. We conclude that long-term therapy with zidovudine can cause a toxic mitochondrial myopathy, which coexists with a T-cell-mediated inflammatory myopathy that is restricted to MHC-I antigen, and is indistinguishable from the myopathy associated with primary HIV infection or polymyositis in HIV-seronegative patients.\r"

Patients with humoral hypercalcemia of cancer (n = 30) had elevated levels of both PTHRP (1 to 74) (mean, 20.9 pmol per liter) and PTHRP (109 to 138) (mean, 23.9 pmol per liter). The plasma concentrations of immunoreactive PTHRP correlated with the levels of urinary cyclic AMP excreted; in some patients, the concentrations decreased after the tumors were resected. Patients with chronic renal failure (n = 15) had plasma PTHRP (1 to 74) concentrations similar to those in the normal subjects, but their plasma PTHRP (109 to 138) concentrations were elevated (mean, 29.6 pmol per liter). The levels of both peptides were normal in patients with hyperparathyroidism and those with hypercalcemia due to various other causes. Breast milk contained high concentrations of PTHRP. An anti-PTHRP (1 to 36) immunoaffinity column failed to extract PTHRP (109 to 138) immunoactivity from plasma, suggesting that the C-terminal region circulates as a separate peptide. We conclude that plasma PTHRP concentrations are high in the majority of patients with cancer-associated hypercalcemia and that the circulating forms of PTHRP in such patients include both a large N-terminal (1 to 74) peptide and a C-terminal (109 to 138) peptide. Measuring the concentrations of PTHRPs may be useful in the differential diagnosis of hypercalcemia.\r"

  ".W": "2-Chlorodeoxyadenosine is a simple purine nucleoside that has previously been shown to be effective in the treatment of low-grade malignant disorders of lymphoid tissue, including chronic lymphocytic leukemia and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Because of these encouraging results, we treated 12 patients with another low-grade B-cell neoplasm, hairy-cell leukemia. The patients received 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine (0.1 mg per kilogram of body weight per day) by continuous infusion for seven days. All the patients responded to treatment. Eleven had complete remissions characterized by the normalization of peripheral blood and bone marrow and disappearance of tumor masses. The longest remission has been 3.8 years. None of the patients have relapsed, and the median duration of remission has been 15.5 months. No serious toxic reactions occurred as a result of 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine therapy. These results suggest that 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine may be the most effective therapy available for hairy-cell leukemia. The administration of 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine resulted in a higher rate of complete remission than is observed with interferon alfa, and it required no maintenance therapy. Its toxicity may be lower than that of deoxycoformycin, and the responses were achieved with single courses of treatment.\r"

Boundaries between rhombomeres coincide with boundaries of expression of murine regulatory genes. By clonal analysis using intracellular marking, we show here that the rhombomere boundaries are partitions across which cells do not move. When a parent cell is marked before the appearance of rhombomere boundaries, the resulting clone is able to spread into the neighbouring rhombomere. When marked after boundary appearance, the clone still expands freely within the rhombomere of origin, but it is now restricted at the boundaries. Rhombomeres in the chick embryo thus behave like polyclonal units, raising the possibility that they are analogous to the compartments of insects.\r"

  ".W": "The haemopoietic system has three main compartments: multi-potential stem cells, intermediate stage progenitor cells and mature cells. The availability of simple reproducible culture systems has made possible the characterization and purification of regulators of the progenitor cells, including colony-stimulating factors and interleukins. In contrast, our knowledge of the regulators involved in the control of stem cell proliferation is limited. The steady-state quiescent status of the haemopoietic stem cell compartment is thought to be controlled by locally acting regulatory elements present in the stromal microenvironment, but their purification has been hampered by the lack of suitable culture systems. We have recently developed a novel in vitro colony assay that detects a primitive cell (CFU-A) which has similar proliferative characteristics, in normal and regenerating bone marrow, to the CFU-S (haemopoietic stem cells, as defined by the spleen colony assay) and which responds to CFU-S-specific proliferation regulators. We have now used this assay to purify to homogeneity a macrophage-derived reversible inhibitor of haemopoietic stem cell proliferation (stem cell inhibitor, SCI). Antibody inhibition and sequence data indicate that SCI is identical to a previously described cytokine, macrophage inflammatory protein-1 alpha (MIP-1 alpha), and that SCI/MIP-1 alpha is functionally and antigenically identical to the CFU-S inhibitory activity obtained from primary cultures of normal bone marrow cells. The biological activities of SCI/MIP-1 alpha suggest that it is a primary negative regulator of stem cell proliferation and that it has important therapeutic applications in protecting haemopoietic stem cells from damage during cytotoxic therapies for cancer.\r"

  ".W": "The nuclear factor GF-1 (also known as NF-E1, Eryf-1; refs 1-3 respectively) is important in regulation of the transcription of globin and other genes that are specifically expressed in erythroid cells. We have previously shown that GF-1 of both mouse and human origin is a 413-amino-acid polypeptide with two novel zinc-finger domains whose expression is restricted to erythroid cells. Using in situ hybridization of mouse bone marrow cells and northern blot analysis of purified cell populations and permanent cell lines, we show here that GF-1 is expressed in two other hematopoietic lineages, megakaryocytes and bone marrow-derived mast cells. Our findings are consistent with results from hematopoietic progenitor culture which suggest a relationship between erythroid, megakaryocytic and mast cell lineages, and imply that GF-1 is expressed in committed multipotential cells and their progeny. Hence, the mere presence of this transcription factor is unlikely to be sufficient to programme differentiation of a single haematopoietic lineage. GF-1 may regulate the transcription of not only erythroid genes, but also many genes characteristic of megakaryocytes and mast cells, or genes shared among these lineages.\r"

NF-E1 expression seems to be restricted to the erythrocytic lineage. A closely related (if not identical) protein is found in both a human megakaryocytic cell line and purified human megakaryocytes; it binds to promoter regions of two megakaryocytic-specific genes. The binding sites and partial proteolysis profile of this protein are indistinguishable from those of the erythroid protein; also, NF-E1 messenger RNA is the same size in both the megakaryocytic and erythroid cell lines. Furthermore, point mutations that abolish binding of NF-E1 result in a 70% decrease in the transcriptional activity of a megakaryocytic-specific promoter. We also find that NF-E2, another trans-acting factor of the erythrocytic lineage, is present in megakaryocytes. Transcriptional effects in both lineages might then be mediated in part by the same specific trans-acting factors. Our data strengthen the idea of a close association between the erythrocytic and the megakaryocytic lineages and could also explain the expression of markers specific to the erythrocytic and megakaryocytic lineages in most erythroblastic and megakaryoblastic permanent cell lines.\r"

The mechanisms of depolarization-contraction coupling also differ. As the predominant voltage-dependent calcium current of cardiac cells, the L-type current represents a major pathway for entry of extracellular calcium. This entry triggers the subsequent large release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). In contrast, depolarization of skeletal muscle releases calcium from the SR without the requirement for entry of extracellular calcium through L-type calcium channels. To investigate the molecular basis for these differences in calcium currents and in excitation-contraction (E-C) coupling, we expressed complementary DNAs for the DHP receptors from skeletal and cardiac muscle in dysgenic skeletal muscle. We compared the properties of the L-type channels produced and showed that expression of a cardiac calcium channel in skeletal muscle cells results in E-C coupling resembling that of cardiac muscle.\r"

  ".W": "In multinucleated heterokaryons formed from the fusion of differentiated muscle cells to either hepatocytes or fibroblasts, muscle-specific gene expression is activated, liver-specific gene expression is repressed, and there are changes in the location of the Golgi apparatus. An understanding of the regulatory mechanisms that underlie this plasticity is of particular interest given the stability of the differentiated state in vivo. We have now investigated whether MyoD or myogenin, regulators of muscle-specific gene expression that have a helix-loop-helix motif, can induce the phenotypic conversion observed in heterokaryons. When these regulators were stably or transiently introduced into fibroblasts or hepatocytes by microinjection, transfection or retroviral infection with complementary DNA in expression vectors, fibroblasts expressed muscle-specific genes, whereas hepatocytes did not. However, fusion of hepatocytes stably expressing MyoD to fibroblasts resulted in activation in the heterokaryon of muscle-specific genes of both cell types. These results imply that other regulators, present in fibroblasts but not in hepatocytes, are necessary for the activation of muscle-specific genes, and indicate that the differentiated state of a cell is dictated by its history and a dynamic interaction among the proteins that it contains.\r"

Childhood-onset SMAs rank second in frequency to cystic fibrosis among autosomal recessive disorders, and are the leading cause of heritable infant mortality. Predictions that genetic heterogeneity underlies the differences between types of SMA, together with the aggressive nature of the most-severe infantile form, make linkage analysis of SMA potentially complex. We have now analysed 13 clinically heterogeneous SMA families. We find that 'chronic' childhood-onset SMA (including intermediate SMA or SMA type II, and Kugelberg-Welander or SMA type III) is genetically homogeneous, mapping to chromosomal region 5q11.2-13.3.\r"

  ".W": "IN mammalian muscle, the subunit composition of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR) and the distribution of AChRs along the fibre are developmentally regulated. In fetal muscle, AChRs are distributed over the entire fibre length whereas in adult fibres they are concentrated at the end-plate. We have used in situ hybridization techniques to measure the development of the synaptic localization of the messenger RNAs (mRNAs) encoding the alpha-subunit and the epsilon-subunit of the rat muscle AChR. The alpha-subunit is present in both fetal and adult muscle, whereas the epsilon-subunit appears postnatally and specifies the mature AChR subtype. The synaptic localization of alpha-subunit mRNA in adult fibres may arise from the selective down-regulation of constitutively expressed mRNA from extrasynaptic fibre segments. In contrast, epsilon-subunit mRNA appears locally at the site of neuromuscular contact and its accumulation at the end-plate is not dependent on the continued presence of the nerve terminal very early during synapse formation. This suggests that epsilon-subunit mRNA expression is induced locally via a signal which is restricted to the end-plate region and is dependent on the presence of the nerve only during a short period of early neuromuscular contact. Evidently, several mechanisms operate to confine AChR mRNAs to the adult end-plate region, and the levels of alpha-subunit and epsilon-subunit mRNAs depend on these mechanisms to differing degrees.\r"

  ".W": "The coordination of somatic cell division with cell size must be accomplished by the accumulation of mitotic inducers or the dilution, in the course of cell growth, of mitotic inhibitors. In fission yeast (Schizosaccharomyces pombe), cell size at mitosis is determined by expression of the cdc25+ and nim1+ inducer genes and of the inhibitor gene wee1+, which between them regulate the M-phase protein kinase p34cdc2. We now report that both the phosphoprotein product of cdc25+ (p80cdc25, with apparent relative molecular mass 80,000) and the corresponding messenger RNA increase in concentration as cells proceed through interphase, peaking at mitosis. We propose that the cell-cycle timing of mitosis in somatic cells is regulated by the cyclic accumulation of the cdc25 mitotic inducer, which on reaching a critical level results in activation of p34cdc2 protein kinase. Accumulation of this inducer could play a part in coordinating cell division with growth.\r"

  ".W": "The initiation of transcription of eukaryotic genes involves the ordered assembly of a multiprotein complex on proximal promoter elements such as the TATA box. In addition to RNA polymerase II (otherwise RNA pol II, RNA polymerase B), four general transcription factors are required for initiation of transcription: BTF1 (also referred to as TFIID) which has recently been cloned from yeast, BTF2, BTF3 and STF. The first step in assembly of the initiation complex is the stable binding of BTF1 to the TATA box, which is facilitated by STF. Neither BTF2 nor BTF3 bind directly to the promoter proximal elements, but BTF3 can form a stable complex with RNA pol II. We recently purified BTF3, which is a protein of relative molecular mass 27,000, but further studies have been hampered by its low abundance in cells. On the basis of sequences from peptides of BTF3, we have now cloned two complementary DNAs, one for a protein (BTF3a) with all the characteristics of purified BTF3, and one for a shorter protein (BTF3b) lacking the first 44 residues of BTF3a and which is transcriptionally inactive, despite its ability to bind RNA pol II.\r"

  ".W": "Cyclobutane and [6-4]-pyrimidine dimers are major photoproducts of ultraviolet-irradiated DNA. The yield of these photoproducts is dependent on the sequence and structure of the DNA. By analysing the photofootprints of fragments produced by cleavage of the DNA chain near [6-4]-pyrimidine dimers, we show here that a homopurine-homopyrimidine insert (with either d(TC)x or d(C)n) in plasmid pUC19 is, as expected, a good target for UV-induced pyrimidine-dimer formation. But we find that dimerization is virtually completely suppressed when the pyrimidine oligonucleotides d(TC)y or d(C)m are added to DNA carrying d(TC)x- or d(C)n-containing inserts, respectively. This effect is dependent on the type of oligonucleotide used and is site-specific. The protection occurs under acidic conditions that favour the formation of intermolecular triplexes between the homopurine-homopyrimidine inserts and homologous oligopyrimidines. We therefore conclude that triplex formation effectively protects the DNA duplex from UV-induced damage (pyrimidine dimerization). This observation makes the photofootprinting assay a very promising method for studying intermolecular and intramolecular triplexes (H-form DNA) both in vitro and in vivo.\r"

Twenty-three patients received implants after external radiation for newly diagnosed malignant astrocytoma, as part of a randomized study (Group I). Eighteen patients received implants for recurrent malignant astrocytoma (Group II) and 3 for recurrent solitary cerebral metastasis from adenocarcinoma of the lung (Group III). Two additional patients received implants as part of their initial therapy for a radiation-induced malignant astrocytoma and a malignant fibrous histiocytoma. In all patients high-activity iodine-125 sources were implanted temporarily by a stereotactic technique. To date 50 patients have been entered in the randomized study with a maximum follow-up of 31 months. The small numbers and short follow-up preclude any conclusions regarding the efficacy of brachytherapy used as part of initial therapy. The median survival to date in the 23 patients in this group who received implants is 60 weeks. The median survival to date for the 18 patients who received implants for recurrent malignant astrocytoma is 44 weeks postimplant. Two of the three patients who received implants for recurrent solitary metastasis are alive at 41 and 49 weeks postimplant; a third died at 39 weeks postimplant. Significant complications attributable to interstitial brachytherapy have been observed in 10 of 46 patients (21.7%). A second operation for clinical and radiological deterioration was performed in 12 patients (26.1%) 8 to 105 weeks after brachytherapy. The authors conclude that interstitial brachytherapy is beneficial for selected patients with recurrent malignant astrocytoma and solitary recurrent metastasis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The immunohistochemical indirect immunofluorescence, peroxidase-antiperoxidase assays, and specific electron microscopic immunogold staining revealed that 3H9 probably recognized a distinct glioma-associated surface antigen on the GBM8401 cultured cells. In vivo radioimmunolocalization of GBM8401 xenografts in nude mice by external scintigraphy with radiolabeled 3H9 has been performed to evaluate potential clinical application as diagnostic or therapeutic reagents. On the 3rd day after an intravenous injection of 15 microCi, the 125I- or 131I-radiolabeled 3H9 was successful in immunolocalization of a human brain GBM8401 xenograft in the nude mouse. In large xenografts, the radioactivity ratios of tumor to brain and tumor to blood were 11.0 and 2.4, respectively. In small xenografts, the tumor to brain and tumor to blood ratios were 14.0 and 2.9, respectively. The clearance of radiolabeled 3H9 in the bloodstream of the nude mouse was not affected by the presence of a GBM8401 xenograft. This preliminary experiment reveals that human brain GBM8401 xenografts in nude mice can be detected in vivo by radiolabeled 3H9.\r"

  ".W": "The copper ion, a cofactor of angiogenesis, is sequestered in human brain tumors and the adjacent brain. The invasive spread of neoplastic cells has been linked to angiogenesis and involves similar mechanisms of migration and tumor-matrix interaction. In this report, copper depletion inhibited the infiltrative spread of the normally invasive 9L gliosarcoma. Twenty made Fischer 344 rats were each injected with 1 X 10(5) 9L cells; 10 rats were treated with a low-copper diet and penicillamine. In the normocupremic control rats, a \"diffuse\" invasive pattern was observed in all 10 animals. In the hypocupremic group, a \"nodular\" pattern, with a discrete border between tumor and brain, was found in 7 of 10 rats (P less than 0.01). In a second experiment, the brains of 16 tumor-bearing rats were studied by electron microscopy. In the 8 normocupremic control rats, cytoplasmic extensions and pseudopodial protrusions, cytological markers of invasive cells, were prominent at the tumor-brain interface. In striking contrast, pseudopodia were absent along the border of the tumors in the 8 hypocupremic rats. These findings suggest a biological role of copper in the neoplastic spread of brain tumor cells. Pharmacological and metabolic alteration of the cellular microenvironment to inhibit invasiveness represents a novel therapeutic approach, especially for tumors of the brain in which malignancy is a function of regional invasiveness.\r"

Eight tumors showed the characteristic histochemical profile of corticotroph adenoma--amphophilic to basophilic, and periodic acid-Schiff-positive to some extent. In all tumors, immunohistochemical studies revealed adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and alpha-subunit in the cytoplasm of some adenoma cells. By electron microscopy, seven tumors were found to be monomorphous; six were typical corticotroph adenomas and one was a subtype II silent corticotroph adenoma. One unique lesion was bimorphous--i.e., composed of corticotrophs as well as cells resembling glycoprotein cells. Immunoelectron microscopy by the double-labeling immunogold technique, performed on one corticotroph adenoma, demonstrated the presence of ACTH and alpha-subunit not only within the same adenoma cells but also within the same secretory granules. The cytogenesis of ACTH alpha-subunit tumors, a rare form of plurihormonal adenoma, remains to be elucidated. The duration of disease associated with these tumors exceeded the duration in patients with ordinary corticotroph adenomas. Given the low frequency with which increases in serum alpha-subunit are detectable in patients with such tumors--13% in this series--hormone production is not recognized at preoperative evaluation.\r"

Pain was effectively managed through intraventricular administration of a combination of morphine and mild oral narcotic analgesics. Complications included one case of transient respiratory depression, one pump pocket infection, and one pump failure. The morphine dose required to maintain analgesia increased over time in all patients treated. This is a safe and effective method of pain management in patients with head and neck cancer. It is useful as well in patients who have intractable pain that cannot be managed through an intrathecal route because of a contraindication to lumbar puncture or an inaccessible subarachnoid space.\r"

  ".U": "90206290\r", 
  ".W": "Complex partial seizures are associated with alterations in regional cerebral blood flow in abnormally spiking foci, as shown by positron emission tomography and single photon emission computed tomography, with an increase in flow ictally and a decrease interictally. Alterations of vasoregulation during ictal periods have also been described in animal seizure models. An electron microscopic study on human brain tissue from seven patients undergoing resections for the treatment of intractable complex partial seizures was performed to examine ultrastructural changes of the microvasculature and their locations within the microvessel wall. Biopsies were obtained intraoperatively from temporal lobe regions with electrocorticographically detected abnormal spiking and from regions without abnormality on electrocorticograms (control samples) removed as part of the therapeutic resection. A total of 539 microvessels from three regions were evaluated: spiking mesial temporal lobe, spiking lateral temporal cortex, and nonspiking (control) cortex. Evidence of pericyte degeneration (aggregates of cellular debris within the basement membrane) was noted in the majority of spiking area microvessels (76.7% in spiking mesial temporal cortex; 69.8% in spiking lateral temporal cortex) as compared with 37.8% of control microvessels (P less than 0.0005). Morphometric studies revealed a significant increase in total wall thickness, pericyte-basement membrane unit thickness, pericyte cytoplasmic density, basement membrane density, and basement membrane thickness in microvessels from spiking (mesial and lateral temporal cortex), as compared to control areas (P less than 0.01). No statistically significant difference was noted in pericyte coverage or pericyte or endothelial mitochondrial densities between microvessels in spiking and control regions. This study shows degeneration of pericytes, cells thought to play an essential role in microvascular hemodynamics, and thickening of microvessel walls in abnormally spiking brain regions in patients with intractable complex partial seizures. The pericyte degeneration and basement membrane thickening in abnormally spiking areas may explain alterations in vasoregulation, by a decrease in the microvascular compliance and in cross-capillary diffusion.\r"

For the subdural screw method, the correlation coefficient was 0.945 (gradient, 1.04; intercept, -5.51. The results from the ventricular monitoring kit showed that the correlation coefficient was 0.901 (gradient, 0.93; intercept, -0.92.

At 4 weeks, the Vmax values for the hemisected (1.8 +/- 0.2; P less than 0.05) and transected groups (0.6 +/- 0.2; P less than 0.05) were significantly different as compared to the control group. The mean percent drop in Vmax after hemisection was 56 +/- 4%, close to the predicted value of 50%. The mean percent drop in Vmax after transection was 86 +/- 2%. At 8 weeks the mean Vmax values for the hemisected (1.9 +/- 0.3; P less than 0.05) and transected (0.4 +/- 0.4; P less than 0.05) groups were not significantly different compared to their respective 4-week values. It appears that serotonin uptake can be used to quantitate roughly the degree of spinal cord injury.\r"

  ".W": "The traditional treatment for lumbar stenosis is a wide laminectomy. This procedure has a high success rate and a low, but not insignificant, incidence of complications. Recently, however, a better understanding of the pathophysiology of spondylotic lumbar stenosis has led several authors to propose a more limited decompression directed specifically toward the offending area of compression. Over the past 5 years, we have treated 32 patients with lumbar stenosis using decompressive laminotomies. Our patients all had focal lateral recess stenosis that was diagnosed by computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. We performed decompressive laminotomies and foraminotomies at appropriate levels. This procedure is less disruptive than a full laminectomy and, in experienced hands, requires less operating time. At last follow-up, 90% of the patients so treated reported an excellent outcome--namely, total relief of symptoms and/or return to normal daily activities. There was no significant postoperative morbidity or mortality. We conclude that in a selected subgroup of patients with lumbar stenosis, multilevel laminotomies may be an acceptable alternative to laminectomy.\r"

Children with a lap belt injury typically complained of abdominal and back pain, and the nature of their injuries was evident by the presence of a belt-shaped abrasion across the lower abdomen. Midlumbar spine fracture may be associated with paraplegia and life-threatening visceral injury. If the spine is analyzed as a beam, the full spectrum of the reported injuries is predictable. This study shows that the rear seat belts installed as standard equipment do not meet the special needs of children. Rear seat lap belts are better than no restraints, but the addition of a shoulder restraint is strongly advocated to reduce lumbar spine injury.\r"

With the increasing use of magnetic resonance imaging, the presence of a cavernous hemangioma can be detected before surgery, allowing an elective surgical approach. We successfully removed pontomesencephalic cavernous hemangiomas from 2 patients and pontomedullary hemangiomas from 2 others. Elective surgery was performed with perioperative bimodal monitoring of somatosensory and auditory evoked potentials. Performing surgery soon after the hemorrhage minimizes the risk of additional postoperative neurological deficit, since surgical excision is facilitated when the hematoma is not completely organized. Pontine hemangiomas are approached via the 4th ventricle. Mesencephalic hemangiomas are removed by a midline supracerebellar approach when they are lateralized by using a subtemporal approach. The lesion can be removed through a small incision in the brain stem at the site of the lesion. The favorable results, which include marked improvement of preoperative neurological deficits and documentation of complete removal of the lesion by magnetic resonance imaging, support a more aggressive approach to the treatment of symptomatic cavernous hemangiomas of the brain stem. Further investigation of the natural history of these lesions is mandatory.\r"

The patients underwent operations for stenotic plaque in the intracranial vertebral artery with the opposite vertebral artery being occluded, hypoplastic, or severely stenosed. In four of the patients, the stenosis was mainly proximal to the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA). In this group, after endarterectomy, the vertebral artery was patent in two patients, and their symptoms resolved; in one patient the endarterectomy occluded, but the patient's symptoms improved; and in one patient the endarterectomy was unsuccessful, and he continued to have symptoms. In one patient, the plaque was at the origin of the PICA. The operation appeared technically to be successful, but the patient developed a cerebellar infarction and died. In one patient the stenosis was distal to the PICA. During endarterectomy, the plaque was found to invade the posterior wall of the vertebral artery. The vertebral artery was ligated, and the patient developed a Wallenburg syndrome. The results of superficial temporal artery to superior cerebellar artery anastomosis are better than those for intracranial vertebral endarterectomy for patients with symptomatic intracranial vertebral artery stenosis. The use of intracranial vertebral endarterectomy should be limited to patients who have disabling symptoms despite medical therapy, a focal lesion proximal to the PICA, and a patent posterior circulation collateral or bypass.\r"

These branches were present in all the cases studied, and varied from 1 to 6 in number (mean, 3.1). Their diameters ranged from 70 to 470 microns (mean, 243 microns). The perforating branches arose from the choroidal segment of the ICA, that is, from its caudal surface (52.3%), caudolateral surface (34.1%), or caudomedial surface (13.6%). They rarely originated from the bifurcation point of the ICA (10%). The distance of the remaining 90% of the perforators from the summit of the ICA measured between 0.6 and 4.6 mm. The perforating branches most often originated as individual vessels, and less frequently from a common stem with another vessel or by sharing the same origin site with another perforator or with the anterior choroidal artery. The bifurcation of the ICA, which is a frequent site for cerebral aneurysms, is surrounded by many perforating branches. Hence, great care must be taken to avoid damage to these important vessels during operations in that region.\r"

Control (nonperfused) cats showed decreased LCMRg (P less than 0.01) in the frontal, temporal, parietal, and occipital cortex 9.5 hours after a 10-minute exposure to GCI. Cats perfused ventriculocisternally with oxygenated nutrient solution (ONS) for 8 hours showed significant increases in the LCMRg (p less than 0.05) at 9.5 hours postischemia in the parietal and occipital areas over the levels found in untreated ischemic cats. Supplementing the ONS perfusion medium with fluorocarbon (OFNS) increased the LCMRg (P less than 0.05) in the frontal, as well as the parietal and occipital areas, over that seen in untreated ischemic brains. The increase of LCMRg in three (rather than only two) cortical areas may be a result of the ability of the fluorocarbon in OFNS to deliver greater quantities of oxygen to the brain than ONS without fluorocarbon. Perfusion with OFNS without glucose, or with low (50 mg%) glucose, was more effective than OFNS with high (200 mg%) glucose in restoring LCMRg to normal in all four cortical areas affected by GCI. In five brain areas not affected by GCI, perfusion with OFNS having no glucose significantly increased LCMRg as compared to normal animals. This study demonstrates that OFNS perfused by the ventriculocisternal route can restore toward normal the LCMRg following GCI and that different concentrations of glucose in the perfusing fluid will have variable effects on LCMRg in certain brain areas.\r"

The ruptured portion of the sac was clipped, leaving a small tag of aneurysmal tissue. Five days later, this tag was found to have expanded into a second aneurysm. This second lesion resolved with antibiotic therapy. Because of the responsiveness of infected cerebral arteries to the appropriate antibiotics, a less than radical surgical tactic may be a successful alternative to excision of the diseased arterial segment followed by distal revascularization in treating these lesions.\r"

We observed significant differences across groups in tests of heart rate variation (expiratory-inspiratory ratio, maximum minus minimum heart rate difference, and mean square successive difference), the mean arterial blood pressure fall to tilting, and the blood pressure response to isometric exercise. A trend of declining autonomic function from controls to AIDS was present in the 30:15 ratio, the Valsalva ration, the systolic blood pressure fall to standing and tilt, and the cold pressor test. We did not observe any correlation between autonomic dysfunction and individual neurologic signs, prior therapeutic agents, and concurrent HIV-associated inflammatory or neoplastic processes. This study provides support for the presence of autonomic dysfunction in association with HIV infection. Autonomic dysfunction occurs more frequently and with greater severity in patients with AIDS; however, it may be present in the early stages of HIV infection and appears to progress during the illness.\r"

The symptoms began in the upper limbs in 23 patients, in the lower limbs in 13, symmetrically in all 4 limbs in 4, and the face was 1st affected in 2. For 19 patients, the symptoms began asymmetrically. Electrophysiologic testing typically showed absence of sensory potentials. Spinal fluid was usually acellular with a normal protein level. Sural nerve biopsy in 22 patients showed loss of large myelinated fibers and axonal atrophy without inflammation. Six of the patients died: 4 of unrelated causes and 2 of subdural hemorrhages. Only 2 patients had severe functional impairment. Twenty-two had significant sensory deficit but were able to carry out most of their usual activities. In 8, the symptoms had resolved completely. The acute, often focal onset suggests an immune-mediated or vascular process at the level of the posterior root or dorsal root ganglion.\r"

There was Gd-DTPA enhancement in new, enlarging, and preexisting lesions that were unchanged in size. The enhancing lesions were always seen on T2-weighted images. There was no difference in enhancement between the 10- and 60-minute studies. Six of 85 preexisting lesions enhanced whereas all new or enlarging lesions enhanced. Enhancement persisted in only 1/3 of the new or enlarging lesions, suggesting that MR enhancement is a transient phenomenon due to local temporary blood-brain barrier breakdown. Our data indicate that Gd-DTPA enhancement monitoring is more sensitive than unenhanced MRI for detecting disease activity in MS.\r"

Four of 5 patients (80%) with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) protein content above 75 mg/dl had paraproteins, as did 6 of 30 with values above 50 mg/dl. Four of 14 patients with cerebrospinal oligoclonal bands (OCB) also had paraproteins. Two patients with ALS, CSF protein content above 75 mg/dl, and paraproteinemia had lymphoma. We conclude the following about patients with MND: high CSF protein content (especially above 75 mg/dl) or CSF OCB makes paraproteinemia more likely; some of these patients may have lymphoma; there is an inordinately high occurrence of paraproteinemia in MND; and IFE on agarose is more sensitive than electrophoresis on cellulose acetate in detecting paraproteins. Syndromes of paraproteinemia and high CSF protein are not restricted to the lower motor neuron but qualify as \"ALS\" with coexisting upper motor neuron signs.\r"

Ten patients for whom follow-up neuropsychological assessment was available failed either the early or late item recognition portions of their amobarbital evaluation ipsilateral to seizure onset, but had hippocampus included in the temporal lobectomy by virtue of satisfactory performance on other tests of hippocampal function. None of these 10 patients displayed postoperative anterograde amnesia, although there was a reduction in material-specific memory in some patients. These results indicate that relying solely on amobarbital memory testing to assess the functional ability of the contralateral temporal lobe to sustain global memory prior to temporal lobectomy may needlessly exclude patients from a viable therapeutic option.\r"

Outcome in putaminal hemorrhages was highly correlated with the total (P + V) and P blood volumes, whereas the V blood was less important. For thalamic hemorrhages, outcome correlated more highly with the V and P + V volumes than with the P portion. Outcome for all hemorrhages was significantly correlated, in descending order of importance, with the severity of the initial neurologic deficit, P + V blood, hydrocephalus, the number of ventricles containing blood, P, V, and blood in the 4th ventricle. In general patients with more than 20 cc of V blood did poorly. Although hydrocephalus was associated with poor outcome, ventricular drainage did not benefit 8 of 9 patients.\r"

Postmortem study confirmed the diagnosis of Pick's disease and revealed that neuronal loss and gliosis were most prominent in left anterior temporal cortices. The findings are in keeping with evidence that the left anterior temporal cortices and interconnected hippocampal system are critically involved in the learning and retrieval of verbal lexical items. The evidence from this patient, along with similar evidence from the literature we reviewed, suggests that when patients present with a progressive aphasia characterized by anomia, Pick's disease should be considered as the probable diagnosis.\r"

As part of a social and health survey, we administered the Hodkinson abbreviated mental test to all persons over age 59 residing in the Commune of Appignano on January 1, 1987 (N = 778). We then investigated all subjects scoring 7 or less on the cognitive test following a standardized diagnostic protocol. We found 48 patients affected by dementia, yielding a crude prevalence ratio (cases per 100 population over age 59) of 6.2; prevalence ratios were 2.6 for Alzheimer's disease, 2.2 for multi-infarct dementia, 0.8 for mixed dementia, 0.4 for secondary dementia, and 0.3 for unspecified dementia. Age- and sex-specific prevalence ratios increased steeply with age and were consistently higher in women for Alzheimer's disease and in men for dementia of all types and multi-infarct dementia. Alzheimer's disease was slightly more frequent than multi-infarct dementia; however, the most common type of dementia varied across age groups. Most cases of Alzheimer's disease were sporadic and had a late age of onset. Comparison with other populations suggests that dementia of all types is as frequent in Appignano as elsewhere, and that Alzheimer's disease might be more frequent in rural than in urban populations.\r"

We applied a battery of neuropsychological tests to determine the degree of dementia and to exclude the presence of mood alterations. CSF DBI levels were elevated in parkinsonian subjects with dementia and in patients with Alzheimer's disease, but decreased in Huntington's chorea patients.

Some plaques were virtually wrapped by these processes which also penetrated to the core, often directly touching the amyloid deposit. We never saw the plaque-type astrocytic grouping and spot-like blushes in the cortex of younger nondemented controls who were plaque negative. Our observations stress the importance of the astrocyte in plaque formation, either as primary or early secondary reactions. The focal glial reaction, without the neuritic component, possibly may precede neuritic change and relate to subminimal amyloid deposits or to some other undefined change.\r"

When the horizontal line was moved toward the right, both neglect and control subjects increased their rightward pointing errors. However, patients with neglect made greater errors than did controls. When the line was in far left hemispace, controls pointed accurately to their midsagittal planes. The neglect subjects, in contrast, erred toward the left. Our results suggest that patients with neglect from right hemisphere lesions are not only inattentive to their bodies, but are also distracted by extracorporeal stimuli, especially on the right. Our results also suggest that normal subjects have a propensity to orient to or be distracted by stimuli in right hemispace.\r"

There was a prominent PSN beginning at -800 msec, maximal at the vertex. This finding is consistent with activation of the supplementary eye field in the anterior mesial frontal cortex, a concept which correlates with cortical neuron recordings in monkeys and cerebral blood flow studies in humans. A widespread PSP, with greatest amplitude over the posterior scalp, suggests parieto-occipital participation even in the absence of visual targets. The sharp character of SP with focal lateralized frontal negativity, its \"mirror image\" scalp distribution when comparing leftward to rightward saccades, and its timing near the onset of saccades support an origin near the orbit, in either ocular motor nerves or muscles.\r"

We used contrast sensitivity gratings of 0.5 cycles per degree (cpd) with a rate of counterphase temporal modulation of 30 Hz and gratings of 11.4 cpd at 1 Hz. On 1 trial, patients responded when they detected the pattern of the grating and on the next trial when they 1st perceived movement. There was a significant difference in the 1 Hz high spatial frequency pattern and movement results suggesting loss of P cell function. Two patients were unable to perceive any movement with their involved eye with this target, but could detect the pattern. There was no significant difference between the involved and uninvolved eyes in the low spatial frequency pattern detection values. This is a function ascribed to the M cell. There was also loss of low spatial frequency movement detection. Although there was significant depression of the entire visual field in the involved eye, the probability plots showed the most significant loss in the cecocentral area. Farnsworth-Munsell 100 Hue color testing was also abnormal. Greater involvement of P than M ganglion cell axons may explain these contrast sensitivity abnormalities, central scotomata, and color vision loss.\r"

He subsequently showed 4 types of abnormal motor behavior in the left hand that were triggered by voluntary activities of the right hand: symmetric or antagonistic left hand movements; irrelevant movements of the left hand to the right hand; and a tendency to close the fingers of the left hand into a fist. Recordings of movement-related potentials revealed a marked attenuation of the Bereitschaftspotential (BP) over the right hemisphere observed only when the patient initiated voluntary activity with the right hand. Since the BP is believed to represent a cerebral cortical activity preparatory for voluntary movement, we infer that the level of dysfunction in this patient is at the motor preparatory level caused by a disconnection of the right hemisphere from the left.\r"

Two coils could produce the same electric field intensity at only 1 point. Thus, we could estimate the depth of stimulation by finding the intersection of the electric field plots, which were then superimposed on MRIs of the underlying brain. In each of 3 subjects the field plots intersected at the crown of a gyrus, in the region of the central sulcus, an near the level of the gray-white junction. This position and the electric field orientation support localization to layer VI of cerebral cortex.\r"

Although mean respiratory rate, tidal volume, and inspiratory flow rate were statistically similar in both groups, the coefficients of variability in all were significantly greater in MSA-AF patients. Four of 5 nontracheostomized had evidence of upper airway obstruction without significant oxygen desaturation. Three of these 5 patients died suddenly during sleep. MSA-AF is associated with upper airway dysfunction and disordered central respirations which can be life threatening. Evidence of even mild obstruction during sleep should warrant tracheostomy.\r"

The etiology, skewed by the local prevalence of cysticercosis, was hydrocephalus in 80 patients, stroke in 53, and tumor in 45. The importance of timely diagnosis was underscored by the relatively good prognosis of many patients.\r"

Among 2,373 consecutive new patient visits initially surveyed, we reexamined 2,359 (99%) charts 1 year later to investigate patterns of principal care. We defined principal care as 2 or more follow-up visits in the year following the initial office visit. One-fifth of initial visits received principal care, and the mean number of follow-up visits per year among those receiving principal care was 4 (range, 2 to 32 visits). The best indicators of principal care were Medicare coverage, a classic neurologic diagnosis (seizure, stroke), rural practice location, and solo neurology practice. The best indicators of consultative care were self-pay coverage, a diagnosis of musculoskeletal, psychiatric, or pain disorder, urban practice location, and HMO neurology practice. Age, sex, race, and type of referring physician were unimportant in determining subsequent principal care. Projections of future manpower needs must reflect both consultative as well as principal care services provided by neurologists, as well as the cost-effectiveness of such care.\r"

These results indicate that the early stages of Parkinson's disease are not accompanied by major changes in autonomic cardiovascular function and suggest the involvement of central D1-receptors in the control of sympathetic tone.\r"

Results from 19 eyes that underwent penetrating keratoplasty at the time of explantation (pk eyes) were compared with the results from 14 eyes that underwent only IOL explantation (npk eyes). Uveitis was the most common indication for explantation in the npk eyes; frank bullous keratopathy was the most common in the pk eyes. Fifteen of the IOLs explanted from the pk eyes were anterior chamber IOLs, 13 of which were the semiflexible, closed-loop type. Ten of the npk eyes had anterior chamber IOLs explanted, six of which also were the semiflexible, closed-loop type. Visual acuities in the pk group were significantly worse than they were in the npk group, both before and after explantation. Based on this review, we conclude that if anterior chamber and iris-supported IOL complications occur and medical therapy fails, IOL explantation prior to the need for penetrating keratoplasty may improve visual acuity.\r"

All neovascularization regressed. Eleven eyes developed traction detachments, eight of which were successfully reattached with scleral buckling surgery. With follow-up of 6 to 70 months (mean, 29 months), visual acuity was 20/30 to 20/60 in 11 of 16 eyes (69%) of eight children old enough to be tested, and 20/100 to 20/200 in three of these eyes. Thus, vision was 20/200 or better in 14 of 16 eyes (87.5%). Visual behavior was normal for their age in 16 infants too young to test. One child developed bilateral inoperable detachments. We conclude that cryotherapy safely resolves stage 3+ ROP with excellent visual results.\r"

We stress the importance of a complete ophthalmologic examination to rule out more common causes of tearing.\r"

The paper deals with changes in familial HI (mother and daughter) with special consideration of ocular symptomatology; it also presents a review about the relevant literature published to date--not documented with photographs with one exception. The argument is raised whether all ocular changes described in HI actually belong to the syndrome or are partly a mere coincidence. There is also a description of a cataract which has never been observed in cases of HI. Electrophysiological tests (electroretinography, electro-oculography, visual-evoked potential) which to date have not been carried out for HI, are presented and their results reported. Mention is also made of the hereditary factor which has so far been questioned; it is assumed that it is autosomal dominant in character. In this context, the results of a chromosome analysis in both mother and daughter are presented.\r"

We investigated the relationship of MD to CLV in 32 glaucoma suspects and 17 patients with visual-field defects due to chronic open-angle glaucoma. In glaucoma patients with early and moderate disease (up to a MD of 18 dB), the CLV statistically covaried with the MD (R2 = 0.85). Beyond an MD of 18 dB, increases in the MD seemed to cause a decline in the CLV. These results differ from prior reports on the relationship of MD and CLV. Reasons for this and implications for the use of these statistics in the clinical management of the glaucoma patient are discussed. These results may be helpful in the understanding of the pathophysiologic basis of damage in glaucoma.\r"

It is interesting that in the other 'healthy', at least clinically, eye the C wave was subnormal too. On the contrary, in the eyes with optic atrophy the C wave was normal. These findings are against the possibility of an efferent neuronal pathway involvement, which influences the level of the retinal pigment epithelium, and support the view of its involvement during the course of the demyelinating disease that causes the optic neuritis.\r"

This caused severe RPE damage in the ipsilateral eye, but did not affect the contralateral eye. After laser photocoagulation no SRN was demonstrable clinically or histopathologically in the ipsilateral eye; in contrast, active SRN showing extensive fluorescein leakage was found in the contralateral eye. These results suggest that RPE may play a role in the development of laser-induced SRN.\r"

  ".W": "In a retrospective study of children with abdominal pain in a pediatric emergency department, 371 children were identified during four seasonally diverse months. Half of the children were two to six years old, 32% were seven to 11 years old, and 19% were 12 to 16 years old. Forty-eight different diagnoses were made, but 10 diagnoses were given to 83% of the patients. We found an increased frequency of respiratory illnesses (12%) as compared to other studies. Appendicitis was the only surgical problem that occurred in more than one percent of the children. The diagnoses were classified as medical (64.4%), surgical (6.5%), and nonspecific (29.1%). chi 2 and multinomial logit analysis revealed that guarding and abdominal tenderness were the two symptoms which were most strongly associated with a surgical diagnosis. The goal of this work is to assist the busy emergency clinician with the difficult task of making expeditious and accurate diagnoses for children with abdominal pain.\r"

Plain radiography is the most commonly used diagnostic procedure for sinusitis, but computed tomography may be more sensitive. The contribution of sinusitis to the induction and exacerbation of asthma is still unresolved. The existence of a nasobronchial reflex is not clearly supported by available data, although it is a likely explanation for the observed relationship between the two processes. However, sinusitis appears to be an important underlying trigger for some cases of asthma and, therefore, should be suspected any time that acute or chronic asthma is difficult to control.\r"

Investigation usually includes computed tomography of the brain and often magnetic resonance imaging, cerebrospinal fluid analysis, and/or electroencephalography as well.

Fewer than 10% of C3H/Ou mice developed mammary tumors during 88 wk of study when subjected to CEIR regardless of calorie source (fat vs. carbohydrate). By contrast, 100% of mice fed ad libitum diets relatively high in fat or carbohydrate or a commercial diet developed tumors by 35-40 wk. MMTV proviral DNA transcription was shown to be activated in spleen, liver, lung, kidney, small intestine, and mammary gland of mice consuming these diets ad libitum. By contrast, these messages were suppressed by CEIR in all tissues analyzed except spleen. MMTV proviral messages in liver and mammary gland increased with age in full-fed mice and were suppressed by CEIR. These findings suggest that the nutritional regulation of MMTV proviral DNA expression is tissue-specific. In CEIR mice the suppressed MMTV proviral DNA transcripts in mammary gland and liver increased with time in association with the delayed onset of mammary tumors. Mammary tumorigenesis in C3H mice is associated with integration of MMTV proviral DNA, which appears to activate a putative mammary tumor protooncogene, int-1. CEIR apparently decreases the frequency of viral reintegration adjacent to the int-1 gene and thus inhibits expression of int-1 and probably an initiation step in mammary tumorigenesis. Expression of other putative protooncogenes, int-2 and ras, in liver tissue was also reduced by CEIR. These findings indicate that both initiation and promotion of mammary tumorigenesis are influenced by CEIR in C3H/Ou mice.\r"

The amino acid sequence of the NH2-terminal portion of the purified proteins did not resemble that of lipocortins so far reported, but it was almost identical to that of parts of human or mouse complement component C3.

Using oligonucleotide primers specific for exons 4, 8, and the alternative exon (exon 1*), we demonstrated by the polymerase chain reaction that embryonic mouse and fetal human RNAs contain two types of alpha 1(IX) collagen transcripts. One type of transcript does not contain the sequence encoded by exon 1*; the second type of transcript contains this exon.

However, a population genetic analysis of extensive data on biochemical polymorphisms indicates that the two fundamental consequences of sexual reproduction (i.e., segregation and recombination) are apparently rare or absent in natural populations of the parasitic protozoa. Moreover, the clones recorded appear to be stable over large geographical areas and long periods of time. A clonal population structure demands that the medical attributes of clones be separately characterized; ubiquitous clones call for priority characterization. Uniparental reproduction renders unsatisfactory Linnean taxonomy; this needs to be supplemented by the \"natural clone\" as an additional taxonomic unit, which is best defined by means of genetic markers.\r"

The only difference between the two genealogies lies in the different time scales. An approximate scaling factor for allelic genealogy relative to that of neutral gene genealogy is [square root of S/(2M)].[In[S/(16 pi M2)]]-3/2, where M = Nu and S = 2Ns (N, effective population size; u, mutation rate to selected alleles per locus per generation; s, selection coefficient). The larger the value of square root of S/M (greater than or equal to 100), the larger the scaling factor. These findings, supported by simulation results, allow one to apply the theoretical results of the coalescence process directly to the allelic genealogy. Combined with the trans-species evolution of the major histocompatibility complex polymorphism for which balancing selection is believed to be responsible, allelic genealogy predicts that the number of breeding individuals in the human population could not be as small as 50-100 at any time of its evolutionary history. The analysis appears to contradict the founder principle as being important in recent mammalian evolution.\r"

Consideration of known man-mouse homologies of the X chromosome prompted hematological studies, which have shown that the blood is highly abnormal. The platelet and erythrocyte counts are both reduced and become progressively lower relative to normal as the disease progresses. There is gastrointestinal bleeding, and most animals appear to die of severe anemia. By contrast, the leukocyte count is consistently raised. Some animals showed signs of infection but it is not yet clear whether there is immunodeficiency. Other features include the scaly skin and apparently reduced lateral growth of the skin, conjunctivitis, and diarrhea in some animals. The mutant resembles Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome in man, which is characterized by thrombocytopenia, eczema, diarrhea, and immunodeficiency. The loci of the human and mouse genes lie in homologous segments of the X chromosome, although apparently in somewhat different positions relative to other gene loci. Scurfy differs from Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome in that scurfy males are consistently hypogonadal.\r"

  ".W": "Increased levels of glutathione S-transferase (GST; RX:glutathione R-transferase; EC 2.5.1.18) mRNA, protein, and activity in tumor biopsy samples and in drug-resistant cultured cells are associated with resistance to anticancer drugs. We report that each of three full-length cloned GST cDNAs, that for pi (acidic), Ya (basic), and Yb1 (neutral), can confer drug resistance when expressed in cultured mammalian cells. In one approach, stably transfected mouse C3H/10T1/2 cells that express GST pi, Ya, or Yb1 were cloned and analyzed for drug resistance in colony-forming assays. Transiently transfected COS cells that were sorted on a fluorescence-activated cell sorter were used in the second approach to avoid interclonal variation in factors other than the recombinant GST and to show that reversion of transient GST expression correlated with loss of drug resistance. A sorting technique, developed to separate the 20% of the electroporated COS cell population that transiently expressed GST pi, Ya, or Yb1 from the nonexpressing population, was based on a GST-catalyzed intracellular conjugation of glutathione to the fluorescent labeling reagent monochlorobimane. GST Ya conferred the greatest increase in resistance to chlorambucil and melphalan (1.3- to 2.9-fold), Yb1 conferred the greatest increase in resistance to cisplatin (1.5-fold), and pi conferred the greatest increase in resistance to a racemic mixture of 7 beta,8 alpha-dihydroxy-9 alpha,10 alpha-epoxy-7,8,9,10-tetrahydrobenzo[a] pyrene and 7 alpha,8 beta-dihydroxy-9 beta,10 beta-epoxy-7,8,9,10-tetrahydrobenzo [a]pyrene and doxorubicin (1.5- and 1.3-fold) relative to controls. These resistance values to alkylating agents are commensurate with values observed clinically. Cytotoxicity curves representing recombinant GST+ populations were significantly different from their controls with P values ranging from 0.005 to 0.0001. No resistance to vinblastine was detected. Conferred drug resistance was proportional to the magnitude of GST Ya expression, and reversion of transient expression in GST Ya+ COS cell clones to a GST Ya- phenotype was associated with total loss of drug resistance.\r"

  ".W": "Mouse L929 cells were incubated with antibody-targeted liposomes containing oligodeoxyribonucleotides (oligomers). When the oligomer was a 15-mer complementary to the 5'-end region of the mRNA encoding the N protein of vesicular stomatitis virus, the cells became less permissive for multiplication of that virus; greater than 95% reduction of viral multiplication was achieved. Protection was not seen for \"empty\" liposomes, liposomes containing a random oligomer sequence, or liposomes containing a sequence complementary to the 5' end of c-myc protooncogene mRNA targeted by the same antibody, nor was it seen when the liposomes containing the N-protein antisense oligomer were targeted by an antibody that does not bind to L929 cells. Antibody-bearing liposomes containing antisense oligomers thus have a double specificity: a particular cell selected by the targeting antibody on the liposome and a particular mRNA in the cell selected by sequence complementarity with the liposome-encapsulated oligomer. Nonencapsulated oligomers are sensitive to nucleases and usually must be administered to cells at high concentrations. Oligomers encapsulated in liposomes resist DNase and are active in amounts 1-2 orders of magnitude lower than for those reported for unencapsulated oligomer sequences.\r"

Consistent with loss of cholinergic projections, cerebral cortical areas involved in AD exhibited decreased choline acetyltransferase (acetyl-CoA:choline O-acetyltransferase, EC 2.3.1.6) activity. However, remaining nerve terminals in these regions displayed marked up-regulation of synaptosomal high affinity [3H]choline uptake, a result indicative of relative cholinergic hyperactivity. As choline uptake is also rate-limiting in acetylcholine biosynthesis, these findings have implications for both therapy and identification of causes contributing to neuronal death in AD.\r"

  ".U": "90207215\r", 
  ".W": "Skeletal alpha-actin gene products are coexpressed with cardiac alpha-actins in cardiac tissue of adult humans, cows, and pigs; in prenatal rats; and during hypertrophy due either to increased hemodynamic load or the administration of alpha-adrenergic agonists. Because there is preferential synthesis of the beta-myosin heavy chain in each case, it has been suggested that the synthesis of skeletal alpha-actin in cardiac tissue is linked to that of beta-myosin heavy chain. To test this hypothesis, thyroid hormone, which causes cardiac hypertrophy with preferential synthesis of alpha-myosin heavy chain, was administered to normal and hypophysectomized rats. Animals were sacrificed from 2 to 24 hr after the injection of either 1 or 5 micrograms of hormone per 10 g of body weight. The relative amount of mRNA for skeletal and cardiac alpha-actin was measured by using the technique of primer extension. Thyroid hormone caused a rapid increase in the amount of skeletal alpha-actin mRNA relative to controls, more than 7 times in hearts from normal animals and 15 times in hearts from hypophysectomized animals. A small increase in cardiac alpha-actin mRNA also occurred. The rapid increase in transcripts for skeletal alpha-actin under conditions where the isoform of myosin heavy chain that is being synthesized is primarily alpha demonstrates independent patterns of activation of the actin and myosin heavy chain multigene families during cardiac growth in mammals.\r"

  ".U": "90207216\r", 
  ".W": "Thapsigargin, a tumor-promoting sesquiterpene lactone, discharges intracellular Ca2+ in rat hepatocytes, as it does in many vertebrate cell types. It appears to act intracellularly, as incubation of isolated rat liver microsomes with thapsigargin induces a rapid, dose-dependent release of stored Ca2+. The thapsigargin-releasable pool of microsomal Ca2+ includes the pools sensitive to inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and GTP. Thapsigargin pretreatment of microsomes blocks subsequent loading with 45Ca2+, suggesting that its target is the ATP-dependent Ca2+ pump of endoplasmic reticulum. This hypothesis is strongly supported by the demonstration that thapsigargin causes a rapid inhibition of the Ca2(+)-activated ATPase activity of rat liver microsomes, with an identical dose dependence to that seen in whole cell or isolated microsome Ca2+ discharge. The inhibition of the endoplasmic reticulum isoform of the Ca2(+)-ATPase is highly selective, as thapsigargin has little or no effect on the Ca2(+)-ATPases of hepatocyte or erythrocyte plasma membrane or of cardiac or skeletal muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum. These results suggest that thapsigargin increases the concentration of cytosolic free Ca2+ in sensitive cells by an acute and highly specific arrest of the endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ pump, followed by a rapid Ca2+ leak from at least two pharmacologically distinct Ca2+ stores. The implications of this mechanism of action for the application of thapsigargin in the analysis of Ca2+ homeostasis and possible forms of Ca2+ control are discussed.\r"

  ".U": "90207217\r", 
  ".W": "The purification, complete amino acid sequence, and biological activity are described for several homologous snake venom proteins that are platelet glycoprotein (GP) IIb-IIIa antagonists and potent inhibitors of platelet aggregation. The primary structures of kistrin (from Agkistrodon rhodostoma), bitan (from Bitis arietans), three isoforms of trigramin (from Trimeresusus gramineus), and an isoform of echistatin (from Echis carinatus) were determined by automated sequence analysis and fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry analysis. Each of the protein in this family, which range from 47 to 83 residues, contains an Arg-Gly-Asp amino acid sequence found in protein ligands that binds to GPIIb-IIIa, a high (17 +/- 1%) cysteine content conserved in the primary sequence, and a homologous N-terminal region absent only in the echistatin isoforms. Each protein directly inhibits the interaction of purified platelet GPIIb-IIIa to immobilized fibrinogen about 100 times more effectively than does the pentapeptide Gly-Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser; IC50 values range from 1.1 to 3.0 nM. The IC50 value for the inhibition of platelet aggregation, using human platelet-rich plasma stimulated with ADP, ranges from 110 to 550 nM for the various proteins, about 1000-fold more potent than Gly-Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser. Kistrin binds reversibly to both resting and ADP-activated human platelets with high affinity (Kd = 10.8 nM and 1.7 nM, respectively) and to purified GPIIb-IIIa with a lower affinity (Kd = approximately 100 nM). Finally, kistrin injected at 1.0 mg/kg into rabbits reversibly inhibits platelet aggregation ex vivo over 30 min without induction of thrombocytopenia. We propose that these proteins are members of a general class of proteins found in the venom of pit vipers that inhibit platelet aggregation by antagonism of the GPIIb-IIIa-fibrinogen interaction and as such serve as potential antithrombotic agents.\r"

We found that DNA fingerprints of colony-mates were strikingly similar and that between colonies they were much more alike than fingerprints of non-kin in other free-living vertebrates. Extreme genetic similarity within colonies is due to close genetic relationship (mean relatedness estimate +/- SE, r = 0.81 +/- 0.10), which apparently results from consanguineous mating. The inbreeding coefficient (F = 0.45 +/- 0.18) is the highest yet recorded among wild mammals. The genetic structure of naked mole-rat colonies lends support to kin selection and ecological constraints models for the evolution of cooperative breeding and eusociality.\r"

  ".W": "Little is known about the molecular basis for activation of suppressor T cells. In this report we describe two macrophage cell lines, BAC1.2.SC8 and its variant progeny B26, that differ in their ability to activate suppressor T cells. The SC8 line is derived from a (BALB/c x A.CA)F1 (H-2d/f) mouse and is haploid with respect to I-Ed. It is capable of activating I-Ed-restricted helper T cells as well as poly-(Glu50Tyr50)-specific I-Ed-restricted suppressor cells. The B26 variant can activate H-2d-restricted helper T cells but activates H-2k-restricted suppressor cells. The I-Ed molecules of SC8 and of B26 have identical amino acid sequences. This suggests that suppressor T cells either recognize posttranslational modifications of the I-E molecule or that there is another accessory molecule that helps determine the major histocompatibility complex restriction in the activation of suppressor T cells.\r"

  ".W": "The antioxidant properties of tryptophan and some of its oxidative metabolites were examined by measuring how efficiently they inhibited peroxyl radical-mediated oxidation of phosphatidylcholine liposomes and B-phycoerythrin. Low micromolar concentrations of 5-hydroxytryptophan, 3-hydroxykynurenine, xanthurenic acid, or 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid, but not their corresponding nonhydroxylated metabolic precursors, scavenged peroxyl radicals with high efficiency. In particular, 3-hydroxykynurenine and 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid protected B-phycoerythrin from peroxyl radical-mediated oxidative damage more effectively than equimolar amounts of either ascorbate or Trolox (a water-soluble analog of vitamin E). Enzyme activities involved or related to oxidative tryptophan metabolism, as well as endogenous concentrations of tryptophan and its metabolites, were determined within tissues of mice suffering from acute viral pneumonia. Infection resulted in a 100-fold induction of pulmonary indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (EC 1.13.11.17) as reported [Yoshida, R., Urade, Y., Tokuda, M. & Hayaishi, O. (1979) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 76, 4084-4086]. This was accompanied by a 16- and 3-fold increase in the levels of lung kynurenine and 3-hydroxykynurenine, respectively. In contrast, endogenous concentrations of tryptophan and xanthurenic acid did not increase and 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid could not be detected. The activity of the superoxide anion (O2-.)-producing enzyme xanthine oxidase increased 3.5-fold during infection while that of the O2-.-removing superoxide dismutase decreased to 50% of control levels. These results plus the known requirement of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase for superoxide anion for catalytic activity suggest that viral pneumonia is accompanied by oxidative stress and that induction of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase may represent a local antioxidant defence against this and possibly other types of inflammatory diseases.\r"

On the one hand, antibodies raised against the 61-kDa protein reacted specifically with the purified A subunit of PP2A. Furthermore, the amino acid sequences of seven tryptic peptides from the A subunit were almost identical to sequences of the 61-kDa protein as deduced from the corresponding cDNA sequence. On the other hand, antibodies against the purified C subunit (catalytic subunit) of PP2A reacted specifically with the medium tumor antigen-associated 37-kDa protein. These data suggest a role of PP2A in cell transformation by polyoma virus and simian virus 40.\r"
