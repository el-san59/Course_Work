Preclinical development of immunomodulators must include a strong rationale for the use of the immunomodulating substance substantiated by appropriate laboratory studies, in vitro as well as in vivo. Preclinical studies must demonstrate the safety of the proposed therapeutic agent, including an assessment of the potential for adverse effects on immune function and virus replication. Combined therapeutic modalities should also be appropriately evaluated at the preclinical level. Clinical evaluations should be instituted only after a strong rationale is substantiated and safety concerns are fully considered. Initial studies should be conducted with patients at an intermediate stage of HIV disease progression. Immunomodulators may exhibit unusual dose-response patterns, and this should be considered when designing the trials. The consultation recommended that WHO continue to provide a forum for the timely exchange and validation of information related to the development and clinical evaluation of immunomodulators for the treatment of individuals infected with HIV.\r"

The active ingredient in GLQ223 is trichosanthin. Trichosanthin, imported from China, is the active drug in community-initiated treatment programs for patients with HIV infection. Eighteen subjects were enrolled, 10 with AIDS and eight with ARC. All subjects were monitored for tolerance and toxicity. Immunological and virological parameters were also followed. GLQ223 administration was not associated with notable toxicity with the exception of one subject who experienced a severe neurological adverse reaction. No consistent or sustained changes in CD4+ lymphocyte populations or HIV antigen levels were observed. Serum concentrations of GLQ223 that were comparable to concentrations shown to have antiviral activity in vitro were achieved transiently but may not have been maintained for a sufficient duration to exert antiretroviral effects. Further studies are indicated to determine pharmacodynamic properties of GLQ223, its optimal dosing schedule, and whether GLQ223 or related molecules will be useful in the treatment of HIV infection.\r"

We have found that LAK cells derived from HIV-seropositive populations show a significant, albeit reduced, capacity to lyse U937, K562, and RAJI target cell lines, in comparison with similarly derived cells from healthy controls. The reductions in LAK activity in both HIV-seropositive asymptomatic and AIDS populations reflect a significant reduction in cytotoxic potential of individual LAK cells. The maximal LAK cytotoxic potentials of control, asymptomatic seropositive, and AIDS populations are comparable. LAK cells derived from HIV-seropositive populations show an enhanced capacity to lyse HIV-infected U937 targets relative to their uninfected counterparts. These enhancements in HIV-infected U937 versus U937 cytolysis arise from increases in the maximal cell-mediated cytolytic plateau. Depletion of NK (CD56+) lymphocytes from peripheral blood prior to LAK cell generation markedly diminishes subsequent specific and total inducible LAK activity. In some subjects, peripheral blood T-cell depletion prior to LAK cell generation results in LAK cells that are subsequently enriched for cytolytic activity, whereas in other subjects similar T-cell depletion impairs inducible LAK cell responses.\r"

  ".W": "Feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) is associated with feline acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (FAIDS) and has been suggested as a model for HIV-induced human AIDS. The most obvious immunological defect in HIV infection is a reduction in CD4+ cell numbers and an inversion of the CD4:CD8 ratio. To determine whether the same is true in FIV infection, we analyzed by flow cytometry using a panel of monoclonal antibodies to feline lymphocyte populations the CD4:CD8 ratios in cats naturally infected with the virus. We report that 13 of 19 FIV-infected cats had ratios below the 5th percentile of normal cats (0.57, established from analysis of 39 normal cats) and 18 of 19 had ratios below 1. Repeated analyses over a period of several months revealed the inverted ratios to be consistent. Analysis of lymphocyte numbers in FIV-infected cats shows that the inverted ratios are due to a decrease in CD4+ T cells, while CD8+ T and B cells remain relatively normal in number. Analysis of a group of cats with a variety of other chronic diseases, including feline leukemia virus (FeLV) infections, revealed a near-normal distribution of CD4:CD8 ratios. These findings are similar to those in HIV infections and indicate that, like HIV, FIV causes a selective reduction in CD4+ cells and should be an excellent model for studying retrovirus-induced AIDS.\r"

All of the viremic cats developed AIDS-related symptoms, i.e. lymphopenia, neutropenia, thymic atrophy, and wasting syndrome, along with an altered pituitary and adrenocortical function. These symptoms closely resemble human AIDS induced by HIV. It was discovered that, after 2 weeks of infection, the average amount of plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) detected in the infected cats was reduced by 29% in comparison with that before the infection. In contrast to the second week, the fifth week of infection showed a 94% increase of plasma ACTH which then dropped back down to 38% after the sixth and seventh weeks. This opposing biphasic pattern of change was also observed in the plasma cortisol content of the infected cats. The amount of change in plasma cortisol did not correlate with the detected increase in plasma ACTH, indicating a weak adrenal response to pituitary action.\r"

Blood samples were collected from 14 seropositive and 11 seronegative patients living in the main city, Cotonou, and their peripheral blood mononuclear cells were cultured. In seven of the seropositive cases, a retrovirus was detected by measurement of Mg2(+)-dependent reverse transcriptase activity and electron microscopy. HIV-1 antigen assay and genomic analysis indicated that the isolated viruses belong to the first serotype. In each positive case, an HIV-1 DNA probe hybridized to the RNA extracted from the virus and six isolates were found positive by the polymerase chain reaction using HIV-1-specific primers.\r"

The HIV-1 seroprevalence was 5.0%, not significantly higher than the rate of 3.8% found in 1986 (P = 0.2). The seropositivity rate was bimodally distributed; children less than 6 months of age had a higher rate (12.6%) than children 6-11 months old (1.9%; OR = 7.6; P less than 0.0001) and children 1-13 years old (4.1%; OR = 3.4; P less than 0.0001). Seropositive children greater than or equal to 1 year of age were more likely than seronegative children to be anemic and to have signs of malnutrition. A previous blood transfusion was associated with HIV-1 seropositivity among children greater than or equal to 1 year of age (OR = 5.4, P less than 0.0005), but not among younger children. Fifty-two per cent of seropositive children greater than or equal to 1 year of age received a transfusion (etiological fraction = 42%). The association with seropositivity was higher for those who had received a transfusion before 1987 than for those who had received a transfusion since 1987 (OR = 4.8, P = 0.01). These findings suggest a relatively stable, high pediatric HIV-1 seroprevalence in Kinshasa and a decreased but continued risk of transfusions. Expansion of currently limited blood transfusion screening programs, and the development of new strategies for limiting transfusions and preventing severe anemia, are needed.\r"

  ".W": "In countries in sub-Saharan Africa, HIV is transmitted primarily heterosexually. HIV infection and AIDS in women not only affects women's health but also has implications for the other members of society. Maternal infection is the source of most childhood HIV infection in Africa and maternal health is a strong predictor of child survival. In Uganda, a review of passive AIDS surveillance has shown almost equal numbers of clinical cases reported in men and women. However, in three population-based HIV serosurveys, women were consistently found to have a higher infection rate (approximately 1.4 times) than men. In addition, both AIDS case surveillance and seroprevalence studies demonstrate an earlier age of presentation and mean age of infection in women. The higher rate of HIV infection in women suggests either differential rates of transmission between women and men, higher rates of female sexual exposure to infected men, or longer survival among HIV-infected women compared with men. Although further studies are required to illuminate both the biology and the epidemiology of heterosexual HIV transmission in Africa, these findings of earlier and higher infection rates in women have important implications for women's health and child survival in Uganda and indicate the need for specially targeted interventions to reduce transmission in this group.\r"

Multiple regression analysis of AEP latency and amplitude components showed only small effects of past medical and psychiatric history, current symptoms and drug use on electrophysiological responses. HIV-positive patients had longer latency and reduced amplitude of the P300 (P3) component of the AEP compared with a normal control group, but were electrophysiologically similar to a matched control group of HIV-seronegative drug users. However, a lower P3 amplitude was seen in patients in Centers for Disease Control stage IV. One-year follow-up of 103 patients (50%) found significant lengthening of P3 latency in patients with stage IV disease but not in those with stage II or stage III disease. The results suggest that brain involvement in HIV infection can be detected electrophysiologically after the clinical diagnosis of stage IV disease.\r"

This strain scarcely hybridizes with known HIV/simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) DNA probes. Sequence analysis of the only amplified fragment revealed rapidly that GH-2 was quite similar to the recently reported HIV-2ALT(D205) and that these two viruses form a new subgroup distint from known HIV-2 and SIVmac/SIVsm in the large HIV-2 group. This system will be useful for further phylogenetic study of various primate lentiviruses.\r"

Previous immunoblotting showed that 5E but not 10D reacted with a 230-kDa protein in extracts of normal human skin. In the present study, indirect immunofluorescence showed that both 5E and 10D bound to the epidermal side of 1 M NaCl-separated normal human skin. Immunoperoxidase electron microscopy showed that 5E and 10D formed discontinuous focal deposits along the basal region of the epidermal basal cells in normal human skin in a similar localization to that seen with whole BP sera. Post-embedding immunogold electron microscopy demonstrated binding of both monoclonal antibodies to the intracellular components of hemidesmosomes. As far as we are aware, 5E and 10D are the first monoclonal antibodies to be described that recognize epitopes of BP antigen associated with hemidesmosomes and should serve as useful probes for future studies.\r"

  ".W": "The influence of topical application of MC903, an analogue of 1 alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, on psoriatic plaques was investigated during a long-term treatment study. The parameters for epidermal growth and for inflammation were assessed on frozen sections using immunohistochemical methods to elucidate their modulations in time and the interrelations between the different cell types involved during treatment with MC903. Biopsies were taken before and after 1, 2, 4 and 12 weeks of treatment. Monoclonal antibodies against the hyperproliferation-associated keratin 16, against cycling nuclei, and against T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes, Langerhans cells and CD14-positive cells were used in combination with a polyclonal antibody against polymorphonuclear leucocyte (PMN)-elastase. The earliest change was a statistically significant decrease in PMN after 1 week of treatment followed by a decline of cycling nuclei after 2 weeks. These changes preceded a decrease of T lymphocytes which occurred after 4 weeks. Keratin 16 content tended to diminish after 4 weeks of treatment. CD14+ cells decreased slightly during the observation period, whereas Langerhans cells tended to increase. No B lymphocytes were found. These results suggest that MC903 influences the number of PMN and epidermal growth rather than the number of T lymphocytes.\r"

  ".W": "Vitamin D3 metabolites have been found to improve psoriasis but their mechanism of action is not clear. Keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation are known to be dependent on calcium concentrations in vitro. The aim of this study was to examine whether 1 alpha,25(OH)2 vitamin D3 had any direct effect on intracellular free calcium concentrations in cultured keratinocytes. A response to 1 alpha,25(OH)2 vitamin D3 was seen in 88% of monolayers of normal human keratinocytes attached to glass coverslips. An increase in intracellular free calcium was seen in 80% of the reactive cultures, with over half the responses occurring within 30 s of exposure to 1 alpha,25(OH)2 vitamin D3 and the remainder occurring within minutes. Responses could be seen at physiological concentrations of 1 alpha,25(OH)2 vitamin D3 and were not blocked by the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide. The response to 1 alpha,25(OH)2 vitamin D3 took the form of rapid transient increases in intracellular free calcium in 29 out of 59 coverslips. The basal intracellular free calcium was calculated to be 245 +/- 47 nM rising to a maximum of 834 +/- 267 nM (mean +/- SEM; n = 20) following exposure to 1 alpha,25(OH)2 vitamin D3. We conclude that 1 alpha,25(OH)2 vitamin D3 acts directly on keratinocytes to increase intracellular free calcium and that this may be relevant to its mechanism of action in psoriasis.\r"

Immunoreactivity to both enzyme and substrate was observed in secretory granules of the dark cells in the secretory fundus (acinus) of the sweat glands. Double immunostaining revealed a segmental distribution of the two antigens. Each acinar section contained either tissue kallikrein or kininogen. However, there appeared to be a junctional zone in which both were present, but in separate dark cells. Immunoreactivity for both antigens was also observed in close apposition to the luminal microvilli of the duct cells. No specific immunostaining was seen in sebaceous glands, hair follicles, keratinocytes and other cells of the secretory unit such as myoepithelial or clear cells. In psoriatic skin there were in addition many neutrophils immunoreactive for tissue kallikrein in the epidermis and psoriatic scales. Mitogenic action of kinins may account to some extent for the characteristic accelerated turnover of epidermal cells in psoriasis and locally applied kinin antagonists may prove of value in the treatment of this disease.\r"

  ".W": "The immunocytochemical distribution of desmosomal components was determined in involved skin from eight patients with Darier's disease, five patients with Hailey-Hailey disease and two patients with transient acantholytic dermatosis as well as skin from four normal controls. Sections were stained using monoclonal antibodies to the desmosomal proteins dp1 and dp2 (desmoplakins) and the desmosomal glycoproteins dg1 (desmoglein), and dg2 and dg3 (desmocollins). There was normal expression of desmosomal proteins and glycoproteins at the periphery of the keratinocytes in the perilesional skin in Darier's disease, in Hailey-Hailey disease and in transient acantholytic dermatosis. In the lesional skin there was reduced expression of desmosomal proteins and glycoproteins in the basaloid 'buds' at the base of the lesions, but there was bright diffuse staining of the acantholytic cells. Focal intracellular staining was detected within many of the acantholytic keratinocytes in Hailey-Hailey disease and within some of these cells in Darier's disease. Suction blisters were used to induce fresh acantholysis in lesional skin in Darier's disease and clinically uninvolved skin in Hailey-Hailey disease. The results indicated that acantholysis precedes the development of intracellular staining. Although there are immunopathological abnormalities in the distribution of desmosomal proteins and glycoproteins in both Darier's disease and Hailey-Hailey disease, the changes are probably secondary to internalization of desmosomal components with breakdown and redistribution of antigens rather than a primary deficiency in the synthesis of these proteins. Focal internalization was more widespread in Hailey-Hailey disease than in Darier's disease and the differences in the distribution of desmosomal components in these diseases confirm that they are distinct entities.\r"

The DNA pattern was aneuploid in five cases and non-classifiable in one case; all of these cases had metastatic spread. None of the eight remaining diploid cases had metastatic spread. DNA content was a strong predictor of metastatic potential.\r"

Comparisons were made in vivo using photosensitive patients with either chronic actinic dermatitis or erythropoietic protoporphyria, and in vitro using a newly developed spectrophotometric assay. Good agreement was obtained between the in-vivo and in-vitro methods at each waveband. All products showed high protection against UVB radiation, but the products containing microfine titanium dioxide showed significantly higher protection against both UVA and blue light than RoC 15+ A+B. Products containing microfine titanium dioxide are likely to offer superior photoprotection in those patients who are abnormally sensitive to long wavelength ultraviolet radiation than products which are currently available on prescription.\r"

To investigate the influence of time on variations in colorimetric parameters, an initial series of measurements was performed on Day 1 on six predetermined sites on the ventral surface of the forearm of six healthy volunteers every 2 h over a 12-h period. The colorimetric values were shown to be site related but hourly variations occurred with similar profiles for all the sites. On Day 2, four topical corticosteroid creams, representative of their potency groups, as well as a base were applied in a randomized double-blind manner on five of the predetermined sites. Visual gradings and colorimetric measurements were carried out every 2 h over the following 12-h diurnal period and were continued on Day 3. The colorimetric parameters L* (luminance) and a* (colour hue ranging from green(-) to red(+] gave a rank order correlated to corticosteroid potency that showed superior discrimination compared to simple visual grading. In this study, L* was more discriminative parameter than a*. The Minolta Chroma Meter CR-200 appears to be a simple and accurate device for objectively measuring the blanching effects of topical corticosteroids.\r"

Both variant enzymes were characterized according to the recommendations of the International Committee for Standardization in Haematology. Genomic DNA was specifically amplified by the polymerase chain reaction. Normal and mutant alleles of the L-type PK gene were analyzed by nucleotide sequencing. Heterozygosity of the parents was confirmed by allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization. In PK Linz a C to T base exchange at position 394 of the L-type PK gene was found. As a result, the 132nd amino acid of the mutant enzyme, arginine (CGC), is replaced by cysteine (TGC). The affected amino acid residue is located within the deduced active site of the protein and the enzyme variant shows strongly altered allosteric properties. PK Beirut shows a C for T substitution at position 1058, changing the 353 amino acid from threonine (ACG) to methionine (ATG). In contrast to PK Linz, this amino acid lies outside the deduced substrate binding site and kinetic parameters of PK Beirut are close to normal. Both enzyme variants show a markedly reduced specific activity and thermolability.\r"

  ".W": "The c-kit proto-oncogene encodes a 145- to 160-Kd transmembrane tyrosine kinase, which is a member of the platelet-derived growth factor receptor family and is allelic with the murine white spotting locus (W). W mutations affect several aspects of hematopoiesis, most notably erythroid progenitors and mast cells. A monoclonal antibody, YB5.B8, had been raised against the leukemic blasts of a patient with M1-type acute myelocytic leukemia (AML) and it precipitates a 150-Kd cell surface glycoprotein from leukemic cells. The YB5.B8 epitope is expressed on mast cells, on up to 3% of normal mononuclear bone marrow cells, and it identifies a sub-group of AML patients with a poor prognosis. In view of similarities noted between the cell surface antigen identified by YB5.B8 and the c-kit protein product, we performed experiments to determine whether they are identical. c-kit RNA expression in the cell lines HEL (human erythroleukemia) and A172 (glioblastoma) was shown to parallel the expression of the YB5.B8 epitope in these lines as measured by flow cytometry. Immunoprecipitation analysis with anti-kit serum and YB5.B8 antibody indicated that the two antibodies identified proteins of identical size in HEL (155 Kd) and A172 (145 Kd) cells, and sequential immunoprecipitations with the kit and the YB5.B8 antibodies demonstrated that the two antibodies recognize the same molecule. The proteins identified by both the anti-kit and YB5.B8 antibodies displayed in vitro autophosphorylation activity in immune complex kinase assays. In addition, YB5.B8 was able to inhibit the binding of the kit ligand to HEL cells. These studies provide evidence that the YB5.B8 antigen and the c-kit protein product are identical and raise certain hypotheses regarding the role of c-kit in AML.\r"

The mean platelet increase for the 43 nonsplenectomized patients was 95,000/microL (median 43,000/microL). Children had greater acute platelet responses than did adults. Human immunodeficiency virus status and duration of thrombocytopenia did not affect response. Maintenance treatment was given to patients as needed: the average interval between infusions was 24 days. The three splenectomized patients had no platelet response whatsoever. Toxicity was minimal; infusions were completed in less than 5 minutes. The generally accepted mechanism of effect of Anti-D has been Fc receptor blockade by substitution of antibody-coated red blood cells for antibody-coated platelets. Evidence is presented suggesting that the effect of IV Anti-D is not limited to Fc receptor blockade, including: (1) no correlation of parameters of hemolysis with platelet increase; (2) a 48- to 72-hour delay before platelet increase; (3) a tendency of the change in monocyte Fc receptor I expression to correlate with platelet increase; and (4) increased in vitro production of antibodies to sheep red blood cells following IV Anti-D infusion.\r"

Forty patients had refractory AML (nonresponse to prior therapy, early first relapse, or multiple relapse) and 32 had late first relapse. Sixty-one percent of patients, with a 95% confidence interval (CI) ranging from 49% to 72%, achieved complete remission (CR), including 45% (CI: 30% to 62%) of refractory patients and 81% (CI: 64% to 93%) of late first relapse patients. Twenty-nine percent of patients (CI: 19% to 41%) did not respond to therapy and 10% (CI: 4% to 19%) died from therapy-related toxicity. Median duration of aplasia was 30 days. Nonhematologic WHO grade 3 or more toxicity included sepsis (57% of patients), vomiting (10%), mucositis (35%), diarrhea (7%), skin rash (6%), and hyperbilirubinemia (11%). Postinduction therapy was attempted in 36 of 44 CR patients: 16 of them received a second course of the same regimen, 7 received maintenance chemotherapy, 4 underwent autologous bone marrow transplantation (BMT), and 9 allogeneic BMT. At a median follow-up of 20 months, 23 of the 44 complete remitters have relapsed, 1 to 14 months after achievement of CR, including 19 of 31 patients not undergoing BMT. Median survival is 7 months with 16% (CI: 4% to 28%) projected survival at 47 months. Median disease-free survival is 6 months with 21% (CI: 3% to 39%) of CR patients projected to remain disease-free at 46 months. Twenty-six percent (CI: 13% to 43%) of the evaluable patients who did not receive transplantation had inversion of CR duration. Among patients younger than 50 years, there was no significant difference in disease-free survival between patients receiving postinduction chemotherapy and those receiving BMT. We conclude that this chemotherapy regimen is highly efficient and could be used as first-line therapy in young patients with AML.\r"

  ".W": "Marrow stromal cells are a heterogeneous population, comprising a variety of lineages including osteogenic cells. In the presence of ascorbic acid, sodium beta-glycerophosphate, and dexamethasone, rat bone marrow stromal cells form discrete nodules of mineralized, bonelike tissue. We used nodule formation by rat bone marrow stromal cells to assay for the self-renewal capacity of osteogenic progenitor cell populations. Cultures were subcultured every 5 days up to six times. Osteogenesis was assayed from second to sixth subcultures by counting the number and measuring the areas of mineralized nodules formed in cultures grown with 10(-8) mol/L dexamethasone. Nodule number and area decreased progressively between second and sixth subcultures. Alkaline phosphatase activity associated with individual cells and measured videodensitometrically decreased exponentially between the second and sixth subculture. The number of cells with alkaline phosphatase activity also decreased with progressive subculturing. The proportions of 3H-thymidine-labeled cells after continuous labeling from the beginning of the culture period showed 90% labeling for cells with alkaline phosphatase activity and fibroblastlike cells. Cultures labeled for only the first 3 days exhibited higher labeling of alkaline phosphatase-positive cells than fibroblastlike cells (P less than .05). Cultures that were flash-labeled at the end of the culture period demonstrated low labeling indices for cells with alkaline phosphatase activity and up to 10-fold higher labeling indices for fibroblastlike cells. Separate cultures treated with a cytocidal dose of high specific activity 3H-thymidine did not form nodules. These results indicate that osteogenic progenitor cells or another cell type required for nodules to develop must divide early in culture if nodule formation is to occur, and that osteoprogenitor cells express a limited capacity for self-renewal.\r"

  ".W": "Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) stimulates granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) production in human fibroblasts and other mesenchymal cells. However, relatively little is known about agents that downregulate cytokine production in these cells. In the present report we show that dexamethasone (Dexa), a synthetic glucocorticoid, markedly reduced GM-CSF production in TNF alpha-stimulated fibroblasts at both the protein and the RNA levels. CSF activity, GM-CSF protein, and RNA levels, determined by an in vitro colony-forming assay in normal human bone marrow cells, by an enzyme immunoassay, and by Northern blotting assay, were reduced to greater than 90% of control values by Dexa (1 mumol/L). Similarly, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25(OH)2D3], a hormone with possible physiologic immunoregulatory significance, reduced GM-CSF expression in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. However, this repression was less pronounced than that of Dexa, and in part due to a decreased proliferative activity. In contrast, cyclosporine A (CsA), another immunosuppressive agent, did not alter GM-CSF expression in TNF alpha-stimulated fibroblasts. Our in vitro studies suggest that by inhibiting GM-CSF production in fibroblasts, glucocorticoids and possibly 1,25(OH)2D3, but not CsA, may attenuate TNF alpha-mediated inflammatory processes and influence the regulation of hematopoiesis.\r"

Hypotheses of the pathophysiology of SCN include (1) defective production of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), and/or (2) defective response to G-CSF. To exclude defective G-CSF production we tested sera from patients with SCN for the presence of G-CSF using Western blot analysis and NFS-60 proliferation assay. Using these assays we were able to detect increased G-CSF serum levels in SCN patients (150 to 910 pg/mL) as compared with normal controls (between undetectable and 100 pg/mL). These results suggest that patients with SCN have no defect in G-CSF production but a defective response of neutrophil precursors to endogenous G-CSF.\r"

  ".W": "Earlier studies suggested the existence of a blood-bone marrow barrier that significantly inhibits the transfer of plasma macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) to responsive hematopoietic cells in vivo as indicated by its failure to induce a receptor downregulation in bone marrow cells. In this study, the effect of recombinant human interleukin-1 (rhuIL-1) was investigated. In vivo administration of rhuIL-1, either intraperitoneally (IP) or intravenously (IV), induced a rapid transient loss of M-CSF receptor binding activity in bone marrow cells, with a nadir occurring between 2 to 4 hours while loss of M-CSF receptors by cells in the peritoneal cavity occurred only in animals receiving rhuIL-1 via IP administration. The loss of M-CSF receptor activity after rhuIL-1 treatment was correlated with an elevated level of circulating M-CSF. However, the loss of M-CSF receptors in marrow cells was prevented by dexamethasone (Dex) treatment before rhuIL-1 administration. The fact that Dex treatment also reduced the level of circulating M-CSF after rhuIL-1 administration suggests that the inhibitory effects of IL-1 are mediated through locally produced M-CSF. Administration of rhuM-CSF at higher doses, either IV or IP, also induced a loss of M-CSF receptor of lesser degree in the marrow cells. However, the loss of M-CSF receptors by the peritoneal cells was induced only in mice receiving rhuM-CSF through IP administration. Taken together, these results indicate the existence of a unidirectional barrier that prevents the transfer of blood M-CSF and IL-1 to peritoneal cavity but not vice versa.\r"

The immunopurified vWF from normal and patient's plasma were digested by trypsin and the resulting peptides were compared. The electrophoresis of \"vWF Normandy\" showed a shift in the band corresponding to a polypeptide from amino acid 1 to 272. Consequently, we performed the molecular analysis of the portion of the vWF gene of this patient encoding this amino acid sequence. Exons 18-24 were amplified by the use of polymerase chain reaction and their nucleotide sequences corresponding to 1.8 kb were determined. Our analysis showed a point mutation C to T at codon 791, resulting in the substitution of Methionine for Threonine at position 28 of the mature vWF subunit. Because this nucleotide substitution destroyed a Mae II restriction site, this mutation was conveniently sought in various individual DNAs. The patterns obtained were consistent with the homozygous and heterozygous state of this mutation in the patient and in her son, respectively, and with its absence in 28 normal individuals. We conclude that Threonine at position 28 in plasma vWF may be crucial for the conformation and FVIII-binding capacity of its cystine-rich N-terminal domain.\r"

Therefore, 25% of the mutant factor XI alleles in our sample remain undefined. However, the distribution of mutant alleles is significantly different between Jewish and non-Jewish populations with hitherto undefined mutations accounting for 84% of the disease alleles in non-Jewish patients. Plasma factor XI:C levels were found to differ significantly between different homozygous and compound heterozygous genotypes and the inheritance of the II/III genotype was found to carry an increased risk of the most severe bleeding tendency.\r"

  ".W": "A new case of heterozygous dysfibrinogenemia characterized by the replacement of NH2-terminal amino acid of fibrin beta-chain was found in a 50-year-old man. Despite a prolonged thrombin time, the propositus' fibrinogen had a normal reptilase time with the normal release of fibrinopeptide A. Release of fibrinopeptide B by thrombin was strongly affected, but a very high concentration of thrombin almost completely released fibrinopeptide B with a normal elution pattern on reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Lysylendopeptidase-cleavage of purified B beta-chains analyzed on HPLC showed the decrease of one peptide compared with the normal and the appearance of an abnormal peptide peak. These peptides were treated with thrombin and further separated on HPLC. Amino acid sequence analysis of the abnormal peptide demonstrated that B beta glycine-15, NH2-terminus of the fibrin beta-chain, was replaced by cysteine. These findings will be of particular importance because they strongly support the hypothesis that the NH2-terminal portion of the fibrin beta-chain is involved in the polymerization reaction by thrombin. The propositus' daughter and two sisters had the same abnormal fibrinogen. This unique inherited abnormal fibrinogen was designated as fibrinogen Ise. During these studies, we found that a very high concentration of thrombin cleaves not only the A alpha Arg19-Val20 bond but also the COOH-terminal region of alpha-chains, which results in the generation of further degraded alpha-chains with apparent molecular weights of 44,000 or less.\r"

  ".W": "We confirm the recent report (J Clin Invest 83:1778, 1989) of a polymorphism at amino acid 33 of platelet GPIIIa associated with the PLA1/PLA2 phenotype by using the polymerase chain reaction on cDNA derived from platelet RNA, using the base-pair primers 105-129 and 452-428. Platelet cDNA from three PLA2-homozygous individuals, when digested with Nci I, gave two bands of 256 bp and 91 bp, whereas eight PLA1 cDNAs gave a single band of 347 bp. Two 13-mer amino acid peptides straddling the amino acid polymorphism: SDEALP (L/P) GSPRCD were synthesized for epitope studies. Two mouse polyclonal antibodies were raised: one against the PLA1-associated peptide, the other against the PLA2 peptide. Both antibodies react with either peptide, as well as with both PLA1 and PLA2 platelets. The PLA1 peptide did not block the binding of two different human anti-PLA1 antibodies to the 100-Kd GPIIIa band on immunoblot of platelet extracts; neither did it block the binding of the same antibodies to PLA1-platelet extracts in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Further studies were performed on the PLA1 epitope following subtilisin digestion of purified GPIIIa. A 55-Kd fragment was obtained that retained the PLA1 epitope as well as the first 13 N-terminal amino acids of GPIIIa. Reduction of the 55-Kd fragment resulted in loss of the PLA1 epitope with production of a 67-Kd, 21-Kd, and 10-Kd band on sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The 55-Kd band does not react with LK-2, a monoclonal antibody versus GPIIIa that inhibits adenosine diphosphate, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin-induced aggregation. Thus, the PLA1 epitope is conformation-induced, resides on an N-terminal 55-Kd fragment composed of two or more peptides held together by -SH bonds, and is not required for platelet aggregation.\r"

In a prospective study of 90 consecutive untreated patients with newly diagnosed Hodgkin's disease who were treated according to the protocols of the German Hodgkin Study group, 22% had detectable levels of sCD30 in their serum. sCD30 was only detected in patients with B symptoms (20 of 44 or 45%), and maximum sCD30 levels (88 U/mL) were found in stage IVB. Of 87 patients evaluable for response, sCD30+ patients had significantly lower rates of complete remission (9 of 20 or 45% v 60 of 67 or 90%; P less than .001) and higher rates of progressive disease (9 of 20 or 45% v 6 of 67 or 9%; P less than .001) than CD30+ patients. Similarly, freedom from treatment failure curves were significantly worse for CD30+ patients (P = .0003). sCD30 disappeared after successful treatment, but increased in patients with progressive disease. It was never detected in patients in complete remission or in healthy controls. We conclude that sCD30 is a valuable marker for disease activity and has prognostic significance in Hodgkin's disease.\r"

  ".U": "91208415\r", 
  ".W": "Major histocompatibility complex-unrestricted lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells have been proposed as therapy for a variety of hematologic malignancies. Because these cells recognize and kill their targets independently of their antigen specific CD3 receptor, it is unclear how they might discriminate between normal and malignant cells. We now propose one such mechanism for the selective killing of myeloid leukemia blasts. While both CD2+ and CD2- activated killer cells may inhibit the clonogenic growth of myeloid leukemia cells, only the CD2+ subset effectively inhibits the growth of normal myeloid (granulocyte-macrophage and granulocyte) progenitors. This difference appears to reflect differential requirements for cell adhesion molecule recognition between normal and malignant progenitor cells. Inhibition of the growth of normal granulocyte-macrophage colonies by CD2+ LAK cells is blocked by antibodies to the CD2-lymphocyte function-associated antigen 3 (LFA-3) (CD58) cell adhesion system. In contrast, these antibodies have no effect on CD2+ LAK-mediated inhibition of malignant cell clonogenic growth. Instead, antibodies to the LFA-1 (CD11a/CD18)-intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) (CD54) adhesion system reduce inhibition. These differences correspond to differential expression of the CD54 cell adhesion molecule by normal and malignant myeloid progenitor cells because less than 15% of normal CD34 positive cells are CD54+ while greater than 85% of CD34+ acute myeloid leukemia blasts express the CD54 antigen. LFA-3, the ligand for CD2, is strongly expressed by erythrocytes, and these cells competitively inhibit killing of normal but not malignant clonogenic cells in an analogous way to the effects of monoclonal antibody to the CD2-LFA-3 adhesion system. The operation of this effect in vivo may be a basis for selective cytotoxicity by CD2+ LAK against clonogenic myeloid blast cells, and could be exploited further with infusion of appropriate monoclonal antibodies.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of recombinant tumor necrosis factor-alpha (rTNF-alpha) on the primary leukemic blasts and leukemic cell lines derived from children with B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL) was studied. The proliferation of leukemic cells from the bone marrow of 11 of 13 patients (seven at diagnosis, four in relapse) and from the 697 (BCP-ALL) cell line was significantly inhibited by rTNF-alpha at the lowest dose tested (0.1 ng/mL), as measured by 3H-TdR uptake. The degree of inhibition was variable, ranging from 17% to 78%. Furthermore, a dose-dependent inhibitory effect was observed, with approximately 70% mean inhibition of DNA synthesis detected when cells from 12 of 13 patients were incubated with 100 ng/mL of rTNF-alpha for 3 days. In contrast, rTNF-alpha did not inhibit another BCP-ALL cell line (EU-1/ALL) established recently in our laboratory. Studies indicated that the TNF-alpha gene was expressed by the primary leukemic blasts of one TNF-resistant case in his third relapse and by EU-1 cells. Also, TNF-alpha protein was detected by Western blot analysis and enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay in the supernatant of EU-1 cells; this is the first report of TNF production by a BCP-ALL cell lines. The production of TNF-alpha mRNA and protein was not detected in the 697 cell line and in the primary leukemic blasts from six patients (four at diagnosis, two in relapse) whose leukemic cells were inhibited by TNF. The partially purified TNF-alpha obtained from the EU-1 cell line also suppressed the proliferation of TNF-sensitive primary leukemic cells, and this inhibitory activity was abolished by an anti-TNF-alpha specific antibody. Our results demonstrate that TNF-alpha is an inhibitor of in vitro proliferation of BCP-ALL cells from most patients. The TNF-resistant leukemic cells from a few patients and the EU-1 cell line express TNF mRNA, suggesting that the induction of TNF gene expression is associated with the development of TNF resistance.\r"

Four were apparently balanced [t(1;3)(p34;p21), t(7;9)(p15;p23-p24), t(12;13)(p13;q14), t(17;19)(q22;p13)], while three were unbalanced with the formation of a dicentric chromosome [dic(7;9)(p13;p11), dic(7;12)(p11;p12), and dic(12;17)(p11;p11-p12)]. One translocation was observed in five cases, two in four cases, and the remaining four in two cases each. The modal chromosome numbers in these 21 cases were 45 (n = 11), 46 (n = 8), and 47 (n = 2). Eight of the 11 cases with a dicentric chromosome had a modal number of 45. Only a single translocation was found in 14 cases (67%), representing the sole structural abnormality in six cases. In three of the seven translocation subgroups, the blast cells were consistently of B lineage (pre-B, early pre-B, or both); in all others, they represented both the B and T lineages. The small size of these subgroups prevented definitive clinical correlations, although it may be important that two of the four cases with a t(17;19) and an early pre-B-cell immunophenotype had disseminated intravascular coagulation, an event usually observed in acute promyelocytic leukemia or T-cell ALL. These findings add substantially to the existing list of nonrandom chromosomal translocations in childhood ALL and may help to explain the genetic alterations leading to the loss of normal growth control mechanisms in this disease.\r"

The response in proliferation assay was observed in the culture with interleukin-3 (IL-3), IL-6, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), and granulocytemacrophage CSF (GM-CSF), but not with IL-1 or IL-5. Neither granulocytic nor eosinophilic maturation was observed in the liquid culture by the addition of dimethyl sulfoxide, G-CSF, or IL-5, respectively. In contrast, induction of macrophagelike cells was seen by the addition of phorbol ester. This is the first report of a human AML cell line with t(8;21) that has characteristics of myeloid and macrophage lineages.

  ".U": "91208421\r", 
  ".W": "Fibronectin is an adhesive protein that can promote phagocytosis and endothelial cell adhesion. Plasma fibronectin declines following burn in animals and patients, potentially due to its complexing with circulating collagenous debris as well as its rapid binding to sites of tissue injury. Such depletion of fibronectin initiates an opsonic deficiency of the plasma. In view of the sensitivity of fibronectin to proteolytic enzymes, an additional factor that could contribute to the decrease of plasma opsonic activity after burn is the proteolytic fragmentation of fibronectin in the blood. In the current study, we determined if fibronectin fragments appear in the blood of anesthetized rats after a sublethal full-thickness skin burn of 15% to 16% of body surface. Plasma fibronectin concentration was quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and the presence of fibronectin fragments in plasma was determined by immunoblot analysis. All blood was collected in an antiprotease mixture to yield final plasma concentrations of 0.15% EDTA, 3mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 3 mmol/L iodoacetate to prevent degradation of fibronectin after sampling. Plasma fibronectin decreased 60% to 70% within 30 minutes post-burn, and this low level lasted for at least 4 hours. Within 30 minutes post-burn, two prominent fragments of fibronectin with a molecular weight of 110 +/- 2.2 kd and 122 +/- 3.3 Kd, respectively, were also detected in the plasma. Peak concentration of these fragments was detected at 60 minutes post-burn, but their level declined by 4 hours. By 4 hours, both bands appeared to resolve into doublets. To rule out the possibility that the fragments of fibronectin detected in the plasma were actually generated by coagulation enzymes activated at the site of peripheral blood sampling, rapid direct inferior vena cava sampling was performed, which also yield the presence of the fragments. Thus, fibronectin fragments exist in the plasma following thermal injury. Because fragments of fibronectin can compete with the intact fibronectin molecule with respect to its ability to stimulate macrophage phagocytosis, such fragments may contribute to altered systemic phagocytic host defense following thermal injury. Furthermore, because fibronectin peptides can compete with matrix fibronectin and impair adhesion of cultured endothelial cells, such circulating fragments may also influence the integrity of the vascular barrier.\r"

Catecholamines have been reported to inhibit PMN functions, but the high concentrations required cast doubt on their actual relevance as a defense mechanism. We report here that adenosine, which is actively released in ischemic conditions, potentiates the effect of epinephrine and reduces the minimal active concentration required to inhibit PMN activation by at least two orders of magnitude. Epinephrine caused a dose-related reduction of chemiluminescence, superoxide anion generation, enzyme release (lysozyme and beta-glucuronidase), and adhesion to endothelial cell (EC) monolayers in human PMN activated by N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenyl-alanine (fMLP). This effect was only apparent at 10(-7) to 10(-6) mol/L. As expected, adenosine caused dose-dependent reductions of superoxide anion production and PMN adhesion to EC. Adenosine and epinephrine combined had an additive effect on PMN superoxide production and adhesion to EC. The minimal effective concentration of epinephrine in combination with 10(-8) mol/L adenosine was in the range of 10(-10) to 10(-9) mol/L. In contrast, adenosine inhibited only slightly enzyme release and did not significantly enhance the inhibition by epinephrine on this parameter. Studies with adenosine analogs suggested that the potentiating effect of adenosine was mediated by A2 receptors. The mechanism of potentiation was not related to additive effect on intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate levels. Epinephrine's ability to modulate PMN activation and the potentiating effect of adenosine may constitute a form of physiologic protection against tissue injury in inflammatory and ischemic processes.\r"

The iron (III) binding constant (log beta 3) of all CP compounds is 36, but their lipophilicity may be modified by altering the length of the R2 substituent on the ring nitrogen. There was a direct relation between lipid solubility and chelating efficiency. Although at high concentrations all CP compounds were more effective in iron mobilization than deferoxamine, the opposite was true for low concentrations. Further studies with 1,2-diethyl-3-hydroxypyridin-4-one (CP94), the most effective CP compound, have shown that iron mobilization is completed within 6 hours, that effective mobilization requires a drug: iron molar ratio exceeding 3:1 permitting the formation of a hexadentate complex, and that the beneficial effects of iron mobilization are manifested in a marked reduction in membrane lipid peroxidation as indicated by cellular malonaldehyde content. Our study represents the first demonstration of a direct interaction between myocardial cells and an orally effective iron chelator, and underlines the need for high molar concentrations for achieving an optimal therapeutic effect.\r"

To directly investigate the basis of G6PD deficiency oxidant sensitivity, the effects of altered GSH and NADPH concentrations were examined in normal and G6PD-deficient erythrocytes. The results of this study demonstrated that GSH depletion, by 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB), had no effect on hemoglobin oxidation in response to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) generating systems (phenazine methosulfate and menadione bisulfite) in either normal or G6PD-deficient cells. Furthermore, a fourfold to sixfold increase in intracellular GSH concentration also did not protect against H2O2-generating systems in the normal or G6PD-deficient erythrocytes. Conversely, introduction of an NADPH-generating system (purified G6PD) into G6PD-deficient cells resulted in a significant decrease in oxidant sensitivity and an ability to cycle GSH. Further experiments demonstrated that the reduced oxidant sensitivity of the G6PD-reconstituted erythrocytes was not due to the maintenance of GSH levels because CDNB-mediated depletion of GSH did not alter this protective effect. Analysis of these results demonstrated a direct correlation between NADPH, but not GSH, concentration and hemoglobin oxidant sensitivity.\r"

We have studied proliferative responses to mitogens and reactivity in mixed lymphocyte culture after irradiation with ultraviolet (UV)-B light using splenocytes from Balb/c (H-2d) and CBA (H-2k) mice. Response to mitogens and in MLC was strongly inhibited by 20 J/m2 and abolished at 50 J/m2. Clonogenic cell recovery (CFU-GM; CFU-S) after UV-B irradiation was also reduced. When bone marrow and spleen cells were transplanted from parent (Balb/c) animals into F1 hybrid (Balb/c X CBA) recipients, all animals died with features indicative of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in 34 days. If the grafts were first irradiated with 100 J/m2 of UV-B at a mean wavelength of 310 nm, then 76% survived to day 80 when they were killed and shown to have normal marrow cellularity. The remainder died in marrow aplasia or of GVHD. H-2 typing in a group of surviving recipients showed either donor hematopoiesis only (8 of 15), mixed allogeneic chimerism (5 of 15), or recipient type hematopoiesis (2 of 15). Higher doses (200 to 300 J/m2) were detrimental to survival with 88% of recipients dying in marrow aplasia. Syngeneic BMT in Balb/c mice showed slower hematopoietic reconstitution when the grafts were first irradiated with 100 J/m2. After BMT from Balb/c to CBA mice all recipients of unirradiated grafts died within 54 days. By contrast, after graft irradiation with 100 J/m2 survival of recipient animals to day 80 was 59%. If these grafts were treated with 50 J/m2 survival was only 26% with an increase in deaths due to GVHD. Hematopoiesis at day 80 in a group of survivors studied by Ig heavy chain allotyping indicated donor type hematopoiesis in 6 of 10 (50 J/m2) and 2 of 9 (100 J/m2). These data indicate that UV-B irradiation inhibits lymphocyte reactivity and can prevent GVHD. However, there is clear in vitro and in vivo evidence of stem cell damage, such that autologous marrow recovery was demonstrated in a proportion of recipients. In parent----F1 UV-irradiated transplants, sustained hematopoietic recovery was effected in the majority by donor stem cells.\r"

Use of vincristine, etoposide, or doxorubicin for purging could be rendered ineffective by the presence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) tumor cells. To circumvent this particular problem, we investigated whether 17F9, a monoclonal IgG2b antibody directed against the cell surface product of the MDR gene, P-glycoprotein, is effective in selective removal of MDR cells from BM when used with rabbit complement (C'). Using two different cell lines we have demonstrated that 17F9 + C' selectively lyses MDR-positive cells. Three rounds of antibody + C' resulted in 96.4% +/- 3.6% kill of K562/DOX and 100% +/- 0% of CEM/VLB cells. Mixtures of malignant cells and normal BM resulted in 99.85% removal of K562/DOX and 99.91% removal of CEM/VLB clonogenic cells. This treatment did not affect normal committed precursors compared with C' alone. The addition of the cytotoxic agent etoposide (VP-16) following antibody purging results in a 4.6 log reduction of malignant cells. Furthermore, this antibody was effective when used against patients' leukemic blasts. These results suggest the use of 17F9 + C' is effective and selective for removal of MDR cells from BM before ABMT and the addition of VP-16 enhances the purging efficacy.\r"

  ".W": "The selection of medical graduates for postgraduate training has often been considered to be unreliable and arbitrary because of the quality of information made available by medical schools to program directors. Many faculties of medicine have changed from reporting graduate performance in percentage grades to using an honours/pass/fail grading system to ensure that clearly established criteria for competence have been met and to encourage excellence and minimize competition. Unfortunately, the honours/pass/fail grading system has not been able to give a clear statement of relative class standing to assist in postgraduate selection. This paper describes a modified honours grading system, which takes into account a student's grade, the relative weighting of a course and the number of honours grades awarded per course. The proposed system was found to rank students in a way similar to that of the traditional percentage grading system, with no significant loss in internal consistency. The modified honours grading system permits faculties that use honours/pass/fail grades to report student performance and class standing, thereby assisting program directors in the selection of medical students for postgraduate training.\r"

DESIGN: Survey. SETTING: Family practice, medical and geriatrics rounds in academic medical centres and community hospitals in seven countries. PARTICIPANTS: Physicians who regularly cared for incompetent elderly patients. OUTCOME MEASURE: A self-administered questionnaire containing three case vignettes. Each provided the same details on an incompetent elderly patient; however, one gave no information about the wishes of the patient and his family (no directive), the second provided a do-not-resuscitate (DNR) request, and the third included a detailed therapeutic and resuscitative effort chart (DTREC) requesting maximum therapeutic care without admission to the intensive care unit (ICU). The four treatment options were supportive care only, limited therapeutic care, maximum therapeutic care without admission to the ICU and maximum care with admission to the ICU. MAIN RESULTS: Treatment decisions varied and were systematically related to age, level of training and country (p less than 0.001). The older physicians and those in family medicine were less likely than the others to choose aggressive treatment options. Brazilian and US physicians were the most aggressive; Australian physicians were the most conservative. The DNR request resulted in a significant decrease in the number of physicians choosing aggressive options (p less than 0.001). The DTREC resulted in a move toward more aggressive treatment, as outlined in the directive (p less than 0.001). Overall, however, about 40% of the physicians chose a level of care different from what had been requested. Furthermore, over 10% would have tried cardiopulmonary resuscitation despite the DNR request. CONCLUSION: Treatment of incompetent elderly patients with life-threatening illness varies widely within and between countries. Uniform standards should be developed on the basis of societal values and be communicated to physicians.\r"

  ".W": "Species-dependent variations of myocardial alpha 1-adrenoceptor-mediated positive inotropic effects of epinephrine were assessed in relation to characteristics of alpha 1-receptor bindings and acceleration of phosphatidylinositol metabolism in the isolated rat, rabbit, and dog ventricular myocardium. Epinephrine in the presence of the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist bupranolol (10(-6) M) elicited a positive inotropic effect through activation of alpha 1-adrenoceptors in rat and rabbit, whereas in dog ventricular myocardium, bupranolol abolished the positive inotropic effect of epinephrine. [3H]Prazosin bound to membrane fractions derived from rat, rabbit, and dog ventricular muscle with high affinities in a saturable and reversible manner. In dog, Bmax and Kd values of alpha 1-adrenoceptor binding sites were identical to those in rabbit ventricular muscle. The Bmax value of alpha 1-adrenoceptors in rat ventricle was the highest, amounting to two to four times those in rabbit and dog. Epinephrine displacement curves for the specific binding of [3H]prazosin in the membrane fraction of these species showed high and low affinity sites with slope factors significantly less than unity, which were shifted to single low affinity sites with slope factors close to unity by addition of 5'-guanylylimidodiphosphate. Accumulation of [3H]inositol 1-phosphate [( 3H]IP1) in ventricular slices prelabeled with [3H]myo-inositol was increased by epinephrine in a time- and concentration-dependent manner in rat ventricular slices. [3H]IP1 accumulation likewise was facilitated by alpha 1-adrenoceptor stimulation in rabbit ventricular slices, whereas the extent of [3H]IP1 accumulation was much less than that in rat. In dog ventricular slices, [3H]IP1 was not accumulated by epinephrine. In rabbit papillary muscle, the time course of increase in contractile force induced by alpha-adrenoceptors coincided with the prolongation of the action potential duration with a similar time course, which is in strong contrast to previous findings in rat that the contractile response was dissociated from the electrophysiological response to alpha-adrenoceptor stimulation. The present results indicate that a wide range of variation of alpha 1-adrenoceptor-mediated regulation of myocardial contractility may be ascribed to different contributions of facilitatory as well as inhibitory regulatory processes that lead to intracellular Ca2+ mobilization subsequent to myocardial alpha 1-adrenoceptor activation among mammalian species.\r"

  ".W": "Sympathetic influences on ventricular repolarization are not yet fully elucidated, despite their relevance to arrhythmogenesis. The sympathetic control of repolarization, measured from an endocardial monophasic action potential duration (APD) and from the QT interval, was investigated in 24 anesthetized cats. The effects of right and left stellectomy and of subsequent bilateral stellectomy or beta-blockade on the relation between APD (or QT) and cycle length (CL) at steady state, and on the kinetics of adaptation of APD to a sudden change in cycle length were studied separately. Steady-state APD/CL (or QT/CL) relations were obtained by atrial pacing at different cycle lengths. The kinetics of APD adaptation were evaluated for a sudden decrease of approximately 100 msec in pacing cycle length. The steady-state APD/CL (QT/CL) relation was fitted by the hyperbolic function APD = CL/[(a. CL) + b]. From this, two parameters were computed: 1) 1/a, that is, APD (QT) extrapolated at infinite cycle length (APDmax or QTmax) and 2) the cycle length at which 50% of the total change in APD (or QT) occurred (CL50 = b/a). Right stellectomy reduced APDmax and CL50, an effect reversed by subsequent left stellectomy or beta-blockade (propranolol, 0.5 mg/kg). Left stellectomy prolonged APDmax and CL50. Bilateral stellectomy, in both groups, caused a further increase in these variables. Results were similar for the QT/CL relation. The adaptation kinetics of APD to cycle length was described by the sum of two exponentials. The first time constant (tau fast, about three beats) was unchanged by any intervention; the second (tau slow) was shortened by right stellectomy and prolonged by left stellectomy. The further removal of the remaining stellate ganglion had the same effect in both groups, that is, an increase in tau slow. Thus, sympathetic innervation modulates both the steady-state dependence on cycle length and the kinetics of adaptation to sudden rate changes of ventricular repolarization. The effects of sympathetic influence are asymmetrical. Right stellectomy shortens APDmax and QTmax, reduces CL50, and accelerates APD adaptation to a new steady state. Because these effects are reversed by beta-blockade or left stellectomy, they are likely to be due to a reflexly enhanced sympathetic outflow to the ventricles through the left-sided nerves.\r"

  ".U": "91208714\r", 
  ".W": "In 18 dogs on total cardiopulmonary bypass, the average interval between local activations during artificially induced ventricular fibrillation (VF interval) was measured from extracellular electrograms, simultaneously recorded from up to 32 ventricular sites. VF intervals were used as an index of local refractoriness, based on the assumption that during ventricular fibrillation, cells are reexcited as soon as they have recovered their excitability. In support of this, microelectrode recordings in two hearts during ventricular fibrillation did not show a diastolic interval between successive action potentials. Refractory periods determined at a basic cycle length of 300 msec with the extrastimulus method correlated well with VF intervals measured at the same sites. Thus, this technique allows assessment of spatial dispersion of refractoriness during brief interventions such as sympathetic stimulation. The responses to left, right, and combined stellate ganglion stimulation varied substantially among individual hearts. This was observed both in dogs with an intact (n = 12) and decentralized (n = 6) autonomic nervous system. Individual ventricular sites could show effects of both left and right stellate ganglion stimulation (42% of tested sites) or show effects of left-sided stimulation only (31%) or right-sided stimulation only (14%). In 13% of sites, no effects of stellate stimulation were observed. Apart from these regional effects, the responses could be qualitatively different; that is, within the same heart, the VF interval prolonged at one site but shortened at another in response to the same intervention, although shortening was the general effect and prolongation the exception. Whenever sites responded to stellate ganglion stimulation with a shortening of VF interval, this shortening was approximately 10% for left, right, or combined stimulation, whether the autonomic nervous system was intact or decentralized. In six of 12 hearts in the intact group, there was a distinct regional effect of left stellate ganglion stimulation; in the other six hearts, the effects were distributed homogeneously over the ventricles. In three hearts, the effect of left stellate ganglion stimulation was strongest in the posterior wall, and in the other three hearts, in the anterior wall. The effects of right stellate ganglion stimulation were restricted to the anterior or lateral part of the left ventricle. Dispersion of VF intervals increased after left and combined stellate ganglion stimulation in the intact group and after right stellate ganglion stimulation in the decentralized group, but not significantly in every heart. This points to a marked individual variation with regard to the effects of sympathetic stimulation on electrophysiological properties of the heart.\r"

  ".W": "Thrombin stimulates phosphoinositide hydrolysis and increases cytosolic calcium in several types of cells. To determine whether thrombin exerts similar stimulatory actions in the heart and whether this mechanism is linked to changes in cardiac electrical activity, the effects of thrombin on several biochemical and electrophysiological parameters were examined. In neonatal rat ventricular myocyte cultures freed of fibroblast contamination by irradiation, thrombin rapidly induced the breakdown of phosphoinositides. Formation of inositol trisphosphate was detectable within 5 seconds and was followed by the sequential accumulation of inositol bisphosphate and inositol monophosphate. The effect of thrombin to stimulate phosphoinositide hydrolysis was inhibited by hirudin, but not by propranolol, prazosin, or pretreatment with pertussis toxin. The inositol phospholipid response was unassociated with changes in intracellular cAMP levels. To determine the electrophysiological effects of thrombin, we used microelectrode techniques to study canine Purkinje fibers. Thrombin increased the beating rate of fibers depolarized using barium, but not those at normal maximal diastolic potential. In addition, thrombin prolonged the action potential duration in fibers driven at a constant cycle length. This response was inhibited by hirudin and nisoldipine, but not by propranolol, prazosin, or pretreatment with pertussis toxin. Thrombin also augmented cesium-induced early afterdepolarizations. Using the fluorescent calcium indicator fura-2, we demonstrated that thrombin increased the beating rate, diastolic calcium, and peak systolic calcium of spontaneously contracting cultured ventricular myocytes. Cytosolic calcium also increased in both rat ventricular myocytes and canine Purkinje myocytes that were electrically driven at a constant basic cycle length, indicating that thrombin modulates cellular calcium metabolism independent of its actions to enhance automaticity. Taken together, these findings demonstrate several novel biological actions of thrombin in the mammalian heart that may be functionally related. The actions of thrombin to enhance automaticity and prolong repolarization may contribute to the electrical abnormalities observed in the setting of myocardial ischemia and infarction.\r"

A partially constricting ligature (0.4 mm i.d.) was placed around the left external iliac artery at 5 weeks, which resulted in significantly reduced femoral mean arterial pressures distal to the ligature at 12 and 24 weeks. The femoral mean arterial pressure distal to the ligature in SHR was similar to that in WKY unprotected hind limbs. Resistance arteries (approximately 200 microns i.d.) were taken from unligatured and protected hind limbs and mounted in a myograph for reactivity and morphological measurements. Each experiment therefore utilized one artery distal to a ligature and one from the control hind limb. Histological examination revealed that nuclear density differed neither between strains nor between arteries from protected and unprotected femoral beds. Media thickness, media cross-sectional area, and media/lumen ratios were reduced in arteries from the hypotensive hind limb in SHR and WKY rats at 12 and 24 weeks. Arteries from the protected hind limbs of SHR were structurally indistinguishable from those from the normally perfused WKY vasculature. It is concluded that the medial content and maximal contractile responses of femoral resistance arteries from SHR and WKY rats are mainly determined by the local perfusion pressure and that normalization of perfusion pressure in SHR normalizes resistance artery structure.\r"

During diastole, the injury current flows intracellularly from the ischemic cells toward the normal cells and tends to depolarize the latter. The gain insight into the possible role of the injury current in arrhythmogenesis, we simultaneously determined diastolic stimulation threshold, [K+]o and TQ potential at multiple sites closely spaced across the cyanotic border in Langendorff-perfused pig hearts during the first 10 minutes after occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery. The position of the electrodes relative to the border was validated by their response to 1) regional ischemia and 2) selective perfusion with a high-K+ perfusate of the left anterior descending coronary artery. A temporary decrease of diastolic stimulation threshold preceded a rapid increase in the central ischemic zone; a lasting reduction (by +/- 20%) without a concomitant increase of [K+]o was observed at seven sites (of 39 sites tested), five of which were less than 2 mm outside the electrophysiological border. Moreover, up to 4 mm inside the electrophysiological border, a similar lasting decrease of diastolic stimulation threshold was accompanied by a moderate increase of [K+]o. We conclude that 1) the injury current causes increased excitability in normal tissue close to the \"ischemic\" border and 2) increased excitability related to a moderately increased [K+]o may persist up to 10 minutes of ischemia at the ischemic side of the border. Both factors may facilitate the induction of life-threatening arrhythmias in acute myocardial ischemia.\r"

  ".W": "Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) causes endothelial cell injury both in vitro and in vivo. It is widely believed that this injury in vivo enhances the transport of macromolecules from plasma into the interstitial space of the underlying artery wall. A new technique was used in rats to obtain high resolution transmural profiles of macromolecules in vivo. We compared the time course of the macromolecular transport into the aortic tissue in vivo after LPS injection to that of LPS-induced endothelial cell death and the proliferative response of the endothelium to LPS injury. At a dose of 1 mg LPS/kg body wt, endothelial cell death reached a maximum by 36 hours after LPS injection and remained elevated for 96 hours; the peak of the S phase of endothelial cell proliferation was observed 48 hours after injection. To examine the effect of LPS on macromolecular accumulation, we measured aortic intimal and medial transmural concentration profiles of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) after circulation of HRP for 15 minutes. The data revealed a transient increase in total aortic accumulation (reflecting predominantly the media), which was maximal between 12 and 48 hours after LPS injection. Although total medial accumulation was found to return to near control levels by 72 hours after LPS injection, intimal accumulation remained elevated above control levels for 120 hours. When HRP was added to the perfusate of an in situ aorta preparation at a near zero transmural pressure gradient, the resulting transmural concentration profiles across aortas from control rats and from rats given LPS 24 hours previously were indistinguishable, whereas a pressure gradient of 60 mm Hg revealed LPS-altered concentration profiles analogous to those in vivo. This suggests that the accumulation of HRP observed in vivo was driven by increased convective transport. These results reveal that LPS enhances entry of macromolecules into the aorta wall in vivo. The changes in macromolecular transport do not, however, correlate temporally with endothelial cell death or proliferation. The results are consistent with an LPS-induced decrease in the endothelial barrier function, which precedes, and may be independent of, cell death and a transient increase in convective transport across the media due to alterations in the barrier function of the internal elastic lamina.\r"

Each of 20 single-caged adult monkeys was fed a diet comparable to a person's ingestion of 240 mg cholesterol/day for a 10-week baseline period and then was introduced as a stranger into a four-member social group for 3 days. Half of the monkeys received a beta-adrenergic blocking agent (metoprolol) via subcutaneous implant 2 days before and during group housing. The social manipulation produced persistent sympathetic arousal as evidenced by significantly elevated heart rates among untreated monkeys (p less than 0.01) but not among their metoprolol-treated counterparts, whose heart rate declined (p less than 0.05). After the social manipulation, all monkeys were necropsied and evaluated for endothelial incorporation of immunoglobulin G (as an indicator of cell death), endothelial cell replication, the presence of adherent leukocytes, and arterial low density lipoprotein permeability and concentration. At branching sites in the thoracic aorta, immunoglobulin G incorporation and endothelial cell replication were significantly greater in untreated monkeys than in metoprolol-treated monkeys (p less than 0.01 for both analyses); no differences existed at nonbranch sites. Endothelial cell replication in the coronary arteries (where immunoglobulin G incorporation was not examined) was also greater among untreated than among metoprolol-treated monkeys. No significant differences were observed between treatment groups in arterial low density lipoprotein permeability or leukocyte adherence; estimates of arterial low density lipoprotein concentrations were higher among untreated than among metoprolol-treated monkeys, but only in the abdominal portion of the aorta. These results indicate that social disruption is associated with both sympathetic nervous system arousal and indexes of endothelial dysfunction, effects that may be prevented by treatment with a beta-adrenergic blocking agent.\r"

  ".W": "The atrioventricular (AV) node responds in a complex fashion to changes in activation rate. A variety of approaches have been used to explain these dynamic AV nodal responses, but none has been able to account fully for AV nodal behavior. Three specific rate-dependent properties of the AV node have been described: 1) time-dependent recovery after excitation, 2) an effect of short cycles to advance recovery (\"facilitation\"), and 3) a gradual slowing of conduction in response to sustained, high-frequency activation (\"fatigue\"). We hypothesized that a model incorporating quantitative descriptors of all three processes might be able to account for a wide variety of AV nodal behaviors. Quantitative descriptors of AV nodal recovery, facilitation, and fatigue were developed based on AV nodal conduction changes during selective pacing protocols in seven autonomically blocked dogs. These descriptors were incorporated into a set of mathematical equations that define AV nodal conduction of any beat based on activation history. The equations were then applied to predict pacing-induced Wenckebach periodicity in each dog. Experimental data were obtained after nine to 19 step decreases in atrial cycle length into the Wenckebach zone in each animal. Observed behaviors included complex patterns of block, a progressive increase in the level of block over 5 minutes of rapid pacing, and periods of alternating patterns of block. The model accurately predicted the onset of AV block at each cycle length, the relation between conduction ratio and cycle length as a function of time, and the changing patterns of Wenckebach periodicity during sustained atrial pacing. All three terms of the model equation (describing recovery, facilitation, and fatigue) were essential to account fully for the observed behaviors. Elimination of AV nodal fatigue from the model resulted in failure to account for time-dependent changes in Wenckebach patterns, whereas exclusion of facilitation led to consistent overestimation of the degree of AV block at each cycle length. We conclude that a mathematical model incorporating terms to describe recovery, facilitation, and fatigue accurately predicts a wide range of Wenckebach-type behavior and that complex conduction patterns of the AV node can be fully accounted for by simple functional AV nodal properties.\r"

In the present study, we determined the sensitivity of the carotid sinus baroreceptor reflex in dogs with pacing-induced heart failure. The carotid sinus baroreceptor reflex sensitivity was determined by pressurizing one carotid sinus with all other baroreceptor and cardiopulmonary receptor inputs removed. The data were analyzed by plotting carotid sinus pressure-mean arterial pressure curves and carotid sinus pressure-renal sympathetic nerve activity curves in the two groups of dogs. The peak arterial pressure during carotid hypotension was significantly depressed in dogs with heart failure compared with normal dogs (107.1 +/- 5.7 versus 139.8 +/- 7.0 mm Hg, p less than 0.001). Mean arterial pressure range, renal sympathetic nerve activity range, and peak slope were significantly decreased in the heart-failure group. To determine if this depression was completely due to depression of baroreceptor discharge per se, or to alterations in central or end-organ responsiveness, similar experiments were performed by stimulating the carotid sinus nerve and evaluating frequency, voltage, and duration of stimulation on the resultant mean arterial pressure and renal sympathetic nerve activity. As was the case with carotid sinus pressurization, electrical stimulation caused a significantly smaller change in mean arterial pressure in heart-failure dogs compared with the normal dogs. However, there was no significant difference between normal and heart-failure dogs for the renal sympathetic nerve activity-electrical stimulation curves. These data strongly suggest that the depressed carotid sinus baroreceptor reflex in heart failure is not solely the result of depressed baroreceptor responsiveness but may be related to poor end-organ responses and normal central control of renal sympathetic outflow.\r"

Cessation of pacing for a single beat resulted in a long diastole control (LDC) intervention beat of 2-second duration characterized by a progressive rise in diastolic coronary vascular resistance index. A 400-msec coronary artery occlusion early in a long diastole (LD4) dramatically inhibited the rate of rise in resistance index during the first 600 msec (phase 1) after occlusion. Partial recovery of the resistance index rise rate was evident during the remaining 400 msec (phase 2) of the long diastole. In nine dogs, LDC and LD4 intervention beats were instituted during two conditions of myocardial metabolic activity in which the myogenic stimuli associated with coronary occlusion would be similar: 1) paired pacing and 2) normal pacing plus intravenous adenosine and phenylephrine infusions (AP) to maintain mean aortic pressure and coronary flow at paired pacing levels. During paired pacing, the LD4-LDC differences in phase 1 and 2 resistance index rise rates (-69 +/- 18 and -48 +/- 31 mmHg/ml/sec2, respectively) were greater than during normal pacing plus AP (-32 +/- 14 and -1 +/- 32 mm Hg/ml/sec2, phase 1 and 2, respectively) (p less than 0.05). These differences are consistent with operation of a metabolic mechanism in response to occlusion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "This study was undertaken to elucidate whether alpha-1 adrenoceptor activity is beneficial to contractile dysfunction during reperfusion after a brief period of ischemia (stunned myocardium) in 54 open-chest dogs. Contractile dysfunction assessed by fractional shortening (FS) was observed 3 hours after the onset of reperfusion following 15 minutes of complete occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery. Pretreatment with prazosin (4 micrograms/kg/min i.c.) further deteriorated contractile dysfunction compared with the untreated condition (12.7 +/- 0.6% versus 6.9 +/- 0.4% with prazosin treatment, p less than 0.001). Conversely, alpha 1-adrenoceptor agonists, methoxamine (1.0 microgram/kg/min i.c.) and norepinephrine (0.24 microgram/kg/min i.c.) with rauwolscine and propranolol, significantly attenuated contractile dysfunction (FS in the methoxamine-treated group, 17.3 +/- 0.3%, p less than 0.001 versus the untreated group; FS in the norepinephrine-treated group, 18.0 +/- 0.9%, p less than 0.05 versus 13.6 +/- 1.1% in the propranolol group). Both adenosine release and hyperemic coronary flow response during the early reperfusion period were significantly attenuated in the prazosin-treated group, and both were enhanced in the alpha 1-adrenoceptor stimulation groups. These results suggest that beneficial effects of alpha 1-adrenoceptor activity may be due to the enhanced release of adenosine. To test the cause-effect relation between the extent of adenosine release and contractile dysfunction during reperfusion, 8-phenyltheophylline was infused to block adenosine receptors in the methoxamine-treated group. The treatment with 8-phenyltheophylline completely abolished (FS, 7.4 +/- 0.3%) the beneficial effect of the enhanced adenosine release by alpha 1-adrenoceptor stimulation. Furthermore, in the prazosin-treated group, adenosine (9 micrograms/kg/min) was additionally infused into the left anterior descending coronary artery 5 minutes before and 2 hours after the onset of reperfusion. Both hyperemic coronary flow and contractile dysfunction (FS, 17.3 +/- 0.3%) recovered to the levels of the alpha 1-adrenoceptor stimulation groups. However, treatment with papaverine could not prevent deleterious effects of prazosin despite the fact that comparable hyperemic flow was obtained. Instead, lactate production up to 10 minutes after the onset of reperfusion was significantly larger (p less than 0.01) despite augmented contractile function in the prazosin-treated and the 8-phenyltheophylline with methoxamine-treated groups compared with the untreated group. The electron microscopic examination revealed no irreversible myocardial injury with and without pharmacological interventions. Thus, we conclude that alpha 1-adrenoceptor activity can reduce the magnitude of myocardial stunning and that its cellular mechanism is due to enhanced adenosine release by alpha 1-adrenoceptor activity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Three monoclonal anti-TnT antibodies (TT-1, TT-2, and RV-C2) specific for the two isoforms of TnT present in the bovine cardiac muscle and two monoclonal antibodies (TI-1 and TI-5) reacting with cardiac TnI were used in this study. Anti-TnT antibodies were found to be unreactive with 1) skeletal and nonmuscle isoforms of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, a glycolytic enzyme that shares some structural homologies with skeletal TnT, and 2) calponin, a TnT-like calmodulin/tropomyosin binding protein with some antigenic properties in common with TnT. When tested on SM extracts from aorta or coronary arteries by Western blotting, the anti-TnT antibodies were able to react exclusively with one or two polypeptides whose electrophoretic mobility corresponds to the cardiac TnT subunits. Similarly, anti-TnI antibodies specifically recognized a component in the aortic or coronary SM extracts with electrophoretic properties identical to the cardiac TnI. Immunofluorescence analysis performed on the vascular SM cells of bovine aorta, coronary arteries, and intramural branches of coronary vessels confirmed the existence of cardiac troponin immunoreactivity in these tissues. In addition, differences in the distribution of cardiac TnT- and TnI-like proteins were evidenced in nonvascular and vascular SM cells. This study shows for the first time that polypeptides with some structural properties in common with cardiac TnT and TnI can be found in the vascular SM system.\r"

  ".W": "We have previously reported that serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine [5HT]) alters cultured bovine pulmonary artery smooth muscle cell (SMC) configuration through two different regulatory mechanisms. We now report that 5HT also regulates SMC growth through these same two mechanisms--a stimulatory event initiated intracellularly and inhibition of growth resulting from a cell surface action. 5HT (1 microM) plus 0.1 mM iproniazid (a 5HT metabolic inhibitor) produced a severalfold stimulation of DNA synthesis (as measured by [3H]thymidine incorporation) of SMCs after a 17-24-hour incubation with only a slight elevation of cellular cAMP. This stimulatory effect responded synergistically with other growth factors including platelet-derived growth factor, fibroblast growth factor, and epidermal growth factor and was effectively reversed by 5HT uptake inhibition. It was not produced by 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid, a metabolite of 5HT. In the presence of 1 microM 5HT plus 0.1 mM isobutylmethylxanthine (IBMX), cAMP was elevated eightfold, dendritic formation occurred, and [3H]thymidine labeling of SMCs was inhibited. Inhibition of labeling by [3H]thymidine was mimicked by other agents that elevated cellular cAMP (10 microM histamine, 1 microM isoproterenol plus 0.1 mM IBMX, and 10 microM forskolin) and by 1 mM dibutyryl cAMP. This inhibitory effect was not blocked by either inhibition of 5HT uptake or 5HT-receptor antagonists ketanserin (5HT2); methiothepin, spiperone, and mianserin (5HT1/5HT2); and 3-tropanyl-indole-3-carboxylate and 3-tropanyl-3,5-dichlorobenzoate (5HT3). However, similar to 5HT, the 5HT1A agonist, (+/-)-8-hydroxy-(+/-)-2-dipropylamino-8-hydroxy-1,2,3, 4-tetrahydronaphthalenehydrobromide, in association with IBMX, produced an elevation in cAMP and inhibition of labeling by [3H]thymidine. 5HT, in the presence of either iproniazid or IBMX, did not alter [Ca2+]i, indicating that [Ca2+]i was not a signal for either of these actions.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

When the preparations were perfused with 3 microM acetylstrophanthidin and 8 mM Ca2+, or with a low Na+ solution (18 mM Na+, 100 mM Li+), spontaneous transitions to the VF state were consistently observed within a short period of time. The initiation of spontaneous VF was preceded by development of a Ca2+i overload state, coincidental with the ascending phase of diastolic Ca2+i oscillations, and was followed by further elevation in Ca2+i levels, which were associated with augmented Ca2+i oscillations of a saw-toothed pattern. Pretreatment with 10 microM ryanodine, which blocked Ca2+i oscillations in the preparation, did not eliminate inducibility of VF by means of AC electrical stimulations; however, VF no longer occurred spontaneously, and the threshold for VF induction increased markedly. In the absence of a state of Ca2+i overload, spontaneous defibrillation occurred within a minute after the initiation of VF. We conclude that 1) VF can be induced in the absence of Ca2+i oscillations; however, 2) Ca2+i oscillations play a crucial role as a trigger for VF and therefore are an important determinant of the vulnerability to VF; and 3) the augmented Ca2+i oscillations after the transition to VF state may support the maintenance of this type of arrhythmia.\r"

  ".W": "To investigate the mechanism of impaired myocardial function after long-term pressure overload, we studied cardiac muscle mechanical contraction and intracellular calcium transients using the bioluminescent indicator aequorin. Left ventricular papillary muscle preparations were examined from three groups of rats: 1) aging spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) with clinical and pathological evidence suggesting heart failure (SHR-F group), 2) age-matched SHRs with no evidence of heart failure (SHR-NF group), and 3) age-matched normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY group). Isometric force development was depressed in both SHR groups relative to the WKY group. Resting [Ca2+]i was lower in the SHR-F group, and the time to peak [Ca2+]i was prolonged in this group. The relative increases in peak [Ca2+]i with the inotropic interventions of increased [Ca2+]o and the addition of isoproterenol were similar among groups. Although inotropy increased in all groups with increased [Ca2+]o, after isoproterenol, inotropy increased only in the WKY group. Thus, in SHR myocardium, [Ca2+]i increased after isoproterenol, but inotropy failed to increase. Myosin isozymes were shifted toward the V3 isoform in both SHR groups; the V3 isoform was virtually 100% in papillary muscles from the SHR-F group. These changes may reflect events directly contributing to the development of heart failure or represent adaptive changes to chronic pressure overload and heart failure.\r"

Neuropeptide Y (NPY) potentiated the neural responses significantly at low stimulation frequencies but not at high frequencies when the contraction was maximal. After blocking the adrenoceptors with phentolamine, significant potentiation of the purinergic component by NPY could be demonstrated. The potentiating effect of NPY was abolished in the presence of nifedipine. After desensitizing the purinoceptors with alpha,beta-methylene-ATP, there was no potentiation of the remaining adrenergic component by NPY. NPY also has no effect on contractions induced by exogenous norepinephrine but potentiates those induced by alpha,beta-methylene-ATP. These results suggest that NPY potentiates neurally induced contraction in the guinea pig saphenous artery by a specific action on the purinergic response.\r"

  ".U": "91208733\r", 
  ".W": "We have recently described that after contractions propagate through multicellular cardiac muscle preparations. These propagating contractions are triggered in damaged regions of rat right ventricular trabeculae during relaxation of electrically stimulated twitches. Propagation of triggered contractions has been attributed to calcium ions that diffuse along the preparation, causing calcium-induced calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum in adjacent cells. In the present study we have investigated a possible role of the sarcolemma and delayed afterdepolarizations (DADs) in the initiation and propagation of triggered propagated contractions (TPCs) in multicellular preparations. We studied whether 1) TPCs are accompanied by delayed sarcolemmal depolarizations, 2) such depolarizations mediate local contraction, and 3) an intact sarcolemma is required for propagation of contractions. TPCs that remained stable for prolonged periods of time could be induced by trains of 15 stimuli (2 Hz, 15-second intervals) at lowered temperature (19-21 degrees C) of the superfusing Krebs-Henseleit medium and a [Ca(2+)]o of 1.0-1.5 mM. Although TPCs could be induced at 38 degrees C and a [Ca2+]o of 3.0-4.0 mM, they disappeared within 10 minutes. Force was measured with a silicon strain gauge; length and shortening of sarcomeres were measured at two sites of the muscle using laser diffraction techniques. Membrane potential was measured with flexible microelectrodes. Saponin was used to selectively render the sarcolemma permeable to small ions and molecules. Propagation velocity of TPCs in intact trabeculae varied from 1.7 to 13.4 mm/sec at 19-21 degrees C. TPCs were accompanied by DADs that could reach threshold and induce triggered arrhythmias. Changes in latency, duration, and force of TPCs, induced by changing [Ca(2+)]o or the number of conditioning stimuli, were closely matched by changes in latency, duration, and amplitude of DADs; DADs consistently preceded TPCs, on average by 60 msec. Local heating of the muscle, by applying a current through an insulated platinum wire (diameter 100 microns) that touched the muscle, interrupted propagation of TPCs reversibly. DADs were, in the absence of a local contraction, still recorded distal to the heated site. In muscles that were treated with saponin and exposed to solutions approximating the intracellular milieu, spontaneously occurring local contractions that propagated in both directions (at velocities of 70-200 microns/sec) were elicited at a bathing calcium concentration of approximately 0.6 microM. Below this threshold, propagated contractions could be triggered by pressure ejection of a calcium-containing solution from a microelectrode positioned close to the trabecula.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "91208734\r", 
  ".W": "To determine the relative roles of cardiac and sinoaortic baroreceptors in mediation of arginine vasopressin (AVP) release, hemorrhage was performed in five groups of conscious splenectomized dogs: 1) all nerves intact; 2) either chronic surgical or acute pharmacological (intrapericardial lidocaine) cardiac denervation (CD); 3) chronic sinoarotic denervation (SAD); 4) combined chronic sinoartic denervation plus either chronic or acute cardiac denervation (SAD + CD); and 5) all nerves intact, but with ganglionic blockade. Hemorrhage (0.5 ml/min/kg) reduced mean arterial pressure similarly in the intact and CD groups. Decreases in mean arterial pressure were augmented in SAD, SAD + CD, and ganglion-blocked groups compared with responses in intact and CD groups. There were no differences in responses of plasma AVP to hemorrhage in the intact and CD groups, but the AVP response was significantly blunted in the SAD + CD group as compared with SAD alone. When compared during the early stage of hemorrhage, at the same reduction in mean arterial pressure, the rise in AVP was greater in the ganglion-blocked group than in the SAD + CD group, but was less than in the intact group. With a protocol to reduce mean arterial pressure by 20 mm Hg over the same period (42 +/- 0.6 minutes) in four of the groups, the blood volume required to reduce mean arterial pressure by 20 mm Hg was similar in the intact (20 +/- 1 ml/kg) and CD (21 +/- 1 ml/kg) groups, but was less in the SAD (12 +/- 1 ml/kg) and SAD + CD (12 +/- 1 ml/kg) groups. Again, similar increases were observed in AVP between the intact (50 +/- 9 pg/ml) and CD (51 +/- 9 pg/ml) groups, whereas increases in AVP were diminished in the SAD (11 +/- 3 pg/ml) and SAD + CD (7 +/- 2 pg/ml) groups. In the presence of an AVP antagonist, decreases in mean arterial pressure and increases in total peripheral resistance with hemorrhage were affected similarly in both the intact and CD groups, whereas hemodynamic impairment by AVP blockade was less marked in the SAD and SAD + CD groups. These results indicate that cardiac receptors are not the major regulators of AVP release during progressive hemorrhage in conscious dogs. However, when the complicating influences of sinoaortic reflexes were eliminated, a modest role for cardiac receptors was uncovered.\r"

Isolated rings with and without endothelium from large (5-7-mm-diameter) and small (2-3-mm-diameter) pulmonary arteries were suspended in modified Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate solution bubbled with 95% O2-5% CO2 in the presence of indomethacin. Aggregating platelets caused relaxations in rings with endothelium but contractions in rings without endothelium, both of which were significantly larger in small versus large pulmonary artery rings. Serotonin and ADP caused concentration-dependent endothelium-augmented relaxations that were unaffected by ketanserin. Methiothepin, but not apyrase, significantly decreased the platelet-induced endothelium-dependent relaxations; the residual relaxation was abolished when rings were incubated with methiothepin, apyrase, and theophylline but was unaffected if apyrase was absent, indicating that ADP is responsible for the residual relaxation caused by aggregating platelets. Quiescent rings, with and without endothelium, contracted in a dose-dependent manner to norepinephrine and histamine but not to serotonin or vasopressin. The contraction to aggregating platelets was blocked by methiothepin, pyrilamine, and diphenhydramine but was unaffected by phentolamine, ketanserin, or incubation of the platelets with dazoxiben. These data indicate that, in large and small porcine pulmonary arteries, serotonin and ADP are the major contributors to the endothelium-dependent relaxation caused by aggregating platelets, while histamine appears to be responsible for the contraction that platelets cause in rings without endothelium.\r"

  ".W": "In contrast to young growing animals, pressure-overload hypertrophy in adults is frequently associated with diminished myocardial capillary density and maximal coronary flow per gram. To determine the role of angiogenesis in maintaining perfusion capacity in the hypertrophying heart, the angiogenesis inhibitor protamine sulfate was administered to young lambs during the development of left ventricular (LV) pressure-overload hypertrophy. Baseline and maximum (adenosine) myocardial perfusion was measured in four groups of chronically instrumented 10-week-old lambs subjected to 1) ascending aortic bands since the age of 4 weeks (LVH group, n = 10), 2) sham operation at the age of 4 weeks (SHAM group, n = 8), 3) aortic bands and twice daily injections of protamine since the age of 4 weeks (LVH + P group, n = 9), 4) sham operation and injection of protamine (SHAM + P group, n = 8). Capillary density was measured postmortem. Peak LV pressure and the LV/body weight ratio were similarly increased in LVH and LVH + P compared with sham-operated lambs (p less than 0.001). In LVH lambs, LV capillary number increased by 32% compared with sham-operated lambs (p less than 0.05), and capillary density, coronary flow reserve, and minimal coronary resistance remained normal. In contrast, LVH + P lambs had no significant increase over SHAM lambs in LV capillaries and total maximum coronary flow. The LVH + P lambs had lower LV subendomyocardial capillary density and higher minimal coronary resistance per gram (p less than 0.05 versus LVH lambs). Right ventricular capillary density and minimal resistance were similar in all groups. These findings support the hypotheses that myocardial angiogenesis with pressure-overload hypertrophy is important in maintaining maximal LV coronary flow in the young and that impairment of angiogenesis results in diminished coronary flow capacity.\r"

  ".U": "91208738\r", 
  ".W": "The interest for the antifibrillatory effect of vagal stimulation has been largely limited by the fact that this concept seemed restricted to acute experiments in anesthetized animals. To explore the potentially protective role of vagal stimulation in conscious animals we developed a chronically implantable device to be placed around the cervical right vagus. An anterior myocardial infarction was produced in 161 dogs; 1 month later an exercise stress test was performed on the 105 survivors. Toward the end of the test the circumflex coronary artery was occluded for 2 minutes. Fifty-nine (56%) dogs developed ventricular fibrillation and, before this test was repeated, were assigned either to a control group (n = 24) or to be instrumented with the vagal device (n = 35). Five dogs were excluded because of electrode malfunction. Compared with the heart rate level attained after 30 seconds of occlusion during exercise in the control test, vagal stimulation led to a decrease of approximately 75 beats/min (from 255 +/- 33 to 170 +/- 36 beats/min, p less than 0.001). In the control group 22 (92%) of 24 dogs developed ventricular fibrillation during the second exercise and ischemia test. By contrast, during vagal stimulation ventricular fibrillation occurred in only 3 (10%) of the 30 dogs tested and recurred in 26 (87%) during an additional exercise and ischemia test in the control condition (p less than 0.001 versus the vagal stimulation test; internal control analysis). Combined analysis of the tests performed in the control condition showed that ventricular fibrillation was reproducible in 48 (89%) of the 54 dogs tested. The protective effect of vagal stimulation was also significant in the group comparison analysis and even after exclusion of those four dogs in which ventricular fibrillation was not reproducible (92% versus 11.5%, control versus vagal stimulation, p less than 0.001). When heart rate was kept constant by atrial pacing, the vagally mediated protection was still significant (p = 0.015) as five (55%) of nine dogs survived the test. This study shows that vagal stimulation, performed shortly after the onset of an acute ischemic episode in conscious animals with a healed myocardial infarction, can effectively prevent ventricular fibrillation. This striking result seems to depend on multiple mechanisms having a synergistic action. The decrease in heart rate is an important but not always essential protective mechanism. The electrophysiological effects secondary to the vagally mediated antagonism of the sympathetic activity on the heart are likely to play a major role.\r"

In the presence of NE, there was a very small significant increase of aiNa during constant stimulation (1 Hz) and at at [K+]o of 4.7 and 11.5 mM. After 7 minutes of exposure, aiNa increased by 0.5 +/- 0.19 mM (mean +/- SEM, n = 4) at [K+]o of 4.7 mM and by 0.5 +/- 0.22 (n = 6) at [K+]o of 11.5 mM.

The effect of NE became also clearly manifest from the configurational changes of action potentials (profound increase in plateau height and duration). Stimulation of the Na(+)-K+ pump by NE became manifest from the changes of resting membrane potential and aiNa after abrupt cessation of stimulation. The magnitude and the rate of the decrease in aiNa and the initial rate of hyperpolarization were significantly greater in the presence of NE than in its absence.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Positive correlations were observed between the grades of ACKD and the levels of hemoglobin, hematocrit, and parathyroid hormone, while there was a negative correlation between ACKD and serum ferritin levels. The serum levels of oxalate, silicon, and vanadium, pre- and postdialysis, were markedly and significantly higher than those in normal controls, but there was no significant correlation between these levels and the duration of dialysis therapy or severity of ACKD. The pre- and postdialysis levels of vanadium were not significantly different, while the levels of oxalate and silicon were significantly lower in the postdialysis samples.

The mean creatinine clearance (Ccr) increased significantly after a protein load at the first (p less than 0.01) and second hour (p less than 0.05), while it did not change after the carbohydrate meal. The mean UAE increased significantly after the protein meal at the first (p less than 0.05) and second hour (p less than 0.05), while after the carbohydrate meal the mean values were increased at the first (p less than 0.05), second (p less than 0.05) and third hour (p less than 0.05). Furthermore, the mean values of UAE after the protein meal were significantly higher (p less than 0.05) than those found at the same time after the carbohydrate meal. Diuresis and natriuresis increased significantly after both meals. These findings show that the increased UAE after the protein meal may be due to a further increase in Ccr in the hyperfiltering remaining kidney, while the smaller increase in the UAE observed after the carbohydrate meal may be due to water load and increased urine flow, which impairs albumin tubular reabsorption. The prognostic importance of microalbuminuria after either meal is therefore uncertain.\r"

  ".W": "Two active forms of vitamin D3, 1 alpha, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1 alpha, 25 [OH] 2D3) and 1 alpha-hydroxyvitamin D3 (1 alpha, [OH] D3) are widely used for treating osteodystrophy in patients with chronic renal failure. Since the pharmacokinetics of these agents during long-term oral administration are unclear, we measured the circulating concentrations of 1 alpha, 25 (OH) 2D before and after their long-term oral administration in patients receiving maintenance hemodialysis. After 12 weeks of treatment with a daily dose of 1 alpha, (OH) D3 (0.5 micrograms), the administration of a single dose (2 micrograms) of 1 alpha, (OH) D3 showed that the area under the curve over 24 h (AUC) was increased significantly compared with day 1 of therapy. In contrast, after the treatment with a daily dose of 1 alpha, 25 (OH) 2D3 (0.25 micrograms), a single dose of 1 alpha, 25 (OH) 2D3 (1 microgram) did not exhibit this effect on the AUC. A single dose of each agent produced no significant change in either the peak increment above basal values or the elimination half-time (T 1/2) of circulating plasma 1 alpha, 25 (OH) 2D. The overall basal concentration of 1 alpha, 25 (OH) 2D achieved by 1 alpha, (OH) D3 after 12 weeks of administration was cumulative, but this effect was not observed in patients on 1 alpha, 25 (OH) 2D3. These data indicate that the pharmacokinetics of the two forms of active vitamin D3 did not differ as to peak increment and T1/2 except for the AUC, even after long-term dosage.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Fifty-nine chronic hemodialysis patients who had been on dialysis for an average of 77 months underwent bone biopsies and the pathologic findings were correlated with biochemical and demographic data. All but two had evidence of renal osteodystrophy, 23 with osteitis fibrosa (OF), 19 with osteomalacia and/or adynamic disease (OM/AD), and 15 with mixed osteodystrophy (MOD). Patients in each group were similar with regard to age, sex distribution, duration of dialysis, unstimulated serum aluminum, calcium and phosphorus. Patients with osteitis fibrosa (OF) had statistically higher DFO stimulated aluminum, alkaline phosphatase and PTHC levels than the other two groups although there was marked individual variation. The bone biopsies were also evaluated for the amount of aluminum deposited in the osteoid seam. All 23 of the patients with OF and 11 of the 15 patients with MOD had no, mild, or minimal aluminum deposition but 12 of the 19 patients with OM/AD had moderate to marked aluminum deposition. Patients with minimal to mild aluminum deposition were similar in age, duration of dialysis, sex distribution, unstimulated and DFO stimulated aluminum levels, calcium, phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase to those with moderate to marked deposition but had significantly higher parathormone levels. All patients had been treated in a similar fashion regarding diet, oral phosphate binders and vitamin D; therefore, the observed differences in bone pathology were not readily explicable. However, patients who were found to have osteitis fibrosa and those with minimal to mild aluminum deposition had significantly higher parathormone levels when compared with patients in the other groups at the inception of dialysis.\r"

  ".W": "Reported increases in the number of fractures of the proximal femur in Europe are greater than can be explained by demographic changes alone. This trend was assessed in Canada by examining hospital discharge records from the provinces of Saskatchewan and Manitoba from 1972 to 1984. The annual number of first fractures of the proximal femur in persons older than 50 years of age increased 59.7% in women and 42.2% in men during this time period. In most of the five-year age groups the percentage of increase in the number of fractures exceeded the percentage of increase in population of that age group. Annual age-specific incidences (by five-year age groups) increased exponentially with age, doubling every six years, and reached a maximum value of 4% in women older than 90 years of age. Annual age-adjusted incidences increased significantly over the study period in men and women. For the whole of Canada in 1987, it is estimated that there were 13,193 first fractures of the proximal femur in women and 4610 in men, and that in the year 2006 these will rise to 22,922 and 7846, respectively. The actual increase will be considerably greater if the age-specific incidences continue to increase as they have from 1972 to 1984. The gradual decline in physical activity, which contributes to bone loss, may be one etiological factor of this trend during the last half century.\r"

This micromotion at the prosthesis interface may be detrimental to the stability of the implant. In cementless femoral implants this could prevent bone ingrowth, and in the cemented component this could cause generation of particulate debris, lysis, and loosening. The introduction of the torque wrench micrometer for assessment of intraoperative femoral component stability can quantify the initial stability of primary cementless femoral components and critically evaluate the stability (at either the initial or revision arthroplasty) of both cemented and cementless femoral components. It allows the surgeon to produce a known torque in the direction and magnitude of the out-of-plane forces that load the hip in vivo.\r"

A solitary lesion of the ATL increased the anteroposterior (AP) laxity in the ankle joint in the entire range of flexion, with a maximum median of 3.1 mm in neutral flexion. Further cutting of the CFL increased AP laxity most obviously in dorsiflexion. A solitary lesion of the ATL resulted in a minor instability in adduction, whereas further lesion to the CFL increased adduction in the entire range of flexion, with a maximum median of 14.2 degrees in dorsiflexion. The anterior drawer maneuver can reveal a combined lesion of the ATL and CFL if performed with the tibiotalocalcaneal joint complex in dorsiflexion. Significant clinical instability in adduction will only take place when a combined lesion of the ATL and CFL is present.\r"

  ".W": "Surgery to treat old injuries of the pelvis was performed to reconstruct the pelvic ring (its anterior and posterior compartments) using autoplastic materials and various fixators. The reconstructive operation for extensive disjunction of the pubic symphysis and sacroiliac joint is performed in three stages. The first stage is to attain the greatest possible elimination of complete dislocation of the pelvis, producing a closer apposition of pubic bones, with the aid of an external pivotal fixator. The second stage of the surgical restoration of the structure is aimed at stabilization of the posterior elements, which bear the main static load; for this purpose, arthrodesis of the sacroiliac joint is performed. In the third stage, bone is transplanted for fusion of the anterior elements of the pelvic ring. Fifty-seven operations were performed on 23 patients. Good results were observed in all of the patients. One group (13 of 23) returned to their previous activities; this alone is evidence of the value of the multistage method of surgical reconstruction of the pelvic ring for treatment of chronic injuries.\r"

Whenever possible, closed methods of reduction were used. The versatility of the Hoffmann external fixator allows multiple attempts and possible secondary resumption of the reduction. The half-frame configuration is stable enough, allowing the restoration and maintenance of the precise anatomy of the forearm bones and early active postoperative motion. The median length of retention of the external fixator was 13 weeks. Because of the elastic type of fixation, a solid periosteal callus was usually obtained. Non-union occurred in 8.5% of the patients. One refracture at the former fracture site was observed.\r"

An anatomic specimen model of a Grade III open fracture of the tibia with an associated fibular fracture was used in this study. Fibular internal fixation using an AO standard plate was performed on one of each of five matched pairs of legs. These were then subjected to identical loads in compression and torsion. The numeric values obtained during loading in all modes were converted to ratios between each of the tested pair to directly compare the effect of stabilization of the fibula. The final results showed that in each case, the preparation with fibular plating had improved resistance to deformation in axial loading. On average, the plated specimens were 2.2 times stiffer. In torsion, plating the fibula did not appear to affect the resistance of the construct to the applied load. Supplemental plate fixation of the fibula in fractures of the tibia with segmental defects may improve subsequent morbidity. The increased rigidity of the system may be sufficient to allow partial to full weight bearing immediately after surgery. This may have significant value in the management of the polytraumatized patient.\r"

Two cases of massive hemorrhage from the deep femoral system resulted from blunt injury to the thigh without femoral fracture. In the first case, a diagnosis of compartment syndrome was based on muscle swelling from the blunt trauma. A fasciotomy uncovered life-threatening bleeding. In the second case, which had a similar history and clinical symptoms, a vascular injury was suspected and an arteriogram was done. Disruption of the deep femoral arterial system was detected, and fluoroscopic embolization controlled the bleeding. A routine fasciotomy was then done. Both patients appeared clinically to have a thigh compartment syndrome, presumably based on injury from the crushed muscle. They both had normal arterial pulsations distal to the injured thigh. The only feature that suggested a vascular injury was a need for transfusion for hemodynamic support in excess of apparent blood loss. Arteriography, with embolization if necessary, is advised for all cases of suspected thigh compartment syndrome in which there is an unexplained need for hemodynamic support by transfusion.\r"

Femoral venous flow was measured continuously using a thermodilution technique in volunteers while their legs were moved in both CPM devices, during inflation of a pneumatic stocking, and during several leg manipulations. Baseline intramuscular pressures in the deep calf and anterior thigh were 10.0 +/- 1.9 mmHg and 4.9 +/- 1.9 mmHg, respectively (mean +/- standard error). Both the anatomic and nonanatomic CPM devices produced a statistically significant maximal increase in pressure in the calf. By contrast, only a decrease in pressure occurred in the thigh with both devices. Baseline femoral vein flow measured by the thermodilution technique was 311 +/- 38 ml per minute. Significant increases in femoral vein flow were seen with both CPM devices. The maximal flow produced by the anatomic CPM was 1199 ml per minute and was approximately four times higher than baseline flow and approximately 1.4 times the maximal flow change seen with the nonanatomic CPM (836 ml per minute). The greatest net increase in flow was observed between 60 degrees and 90 degrees of knee flexion with both devices. Overall, passive straight-leg elevation produced the largest flow (1524 ml per minute), followed by the anatomic CPM and nonanatomic CPM, and then by active ankle dorsiflexion(640 ml per minute), pneumatic stocking inflation (586 ml per minute), manual calf compression (532 ml per minute), and passive dorsiflexion (385 ml per minute)(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "A new technique using postoperative infusional continuous regional analgesia (PICRA) for postoperative pain relief was investigated in 23 surgical patients treated by amputation (12 patients) or by limb-salvage resection operations (11 patients). Bupivacaine was delivered into peripheral nerve sheaths via catheters placed therein at the time of surgery. Only patients in whom the nerves were easily accessible were treated. Catheters were placed in the axillary sheath, the lumbosacral trunk, and the femoral nerve sheaths of patients treated with shoulder girdle and pelvic procedures (resections and amputations), and within the sciatic nerve sheath of those treated with lower extremity procedures. The anesthetic agent was delivered at controllable rates. Regional analgesia was obtained in the operative site with minimal motor or sensory decrease. To assess the efficacy of this technique, the results of this study group were compared with those of a matched group of 11 patients treated with similar surgical procedures but who received epidural morphine. Eleven of the 23 patients on PICRA required no supplemental narcotic agents. The mean level of the narcotic agents required by the remaining 13 PICRA patients was approximately one third of that required by the matched group of 11 patients receiving epidural morphine. Overall, the patients on PICRA had an 80% reduction of narcotic requirements when compared to the historical controls. The technique is reliable and can be performed by the surgeon, requiring about a ten-minute increase in operating time. It has potentially wide application in orthopedics in procedures in which the major nerves are easily accessible (e.g., pelvic fractures and revision hip surgery) and for patients with intractable pain of the extremities.\r"

Twenty adult mongrel dogs were surgically treated to create diaphyseal defects in the left ulnae. The defects were (1) filled with autogeneic bone marrow mixed with granular hydroxyapatite-tricalcium phosphate ceramic (granular ceramic); (2) grafted with a solid block of ceramic soaked in autogeneic bone marrow (block ceramic); (3) received no graft (no implant); or (4) were grafted with autogeneic bone marrow alone (bone marrow). All animals were followed clinically and roentgenographically for 24 weeks and then killed. Repair of diaphyseal defects with the block ceramic led to three solid unions and three fibrous unions; with the granular ceramic implants and marrow, the defects of five dogs formed solid unions, and one progressed to a fibrous union. Defects in all five dogs grafted with autogeneic bone marrow united. The three dogs with no implant formed nonunions. Histology showed normal marrow and only a light immune reaction. Complete bridging of the defect in the dogs treated with the granular ceramic occurred significantly earlier than bridging in the dogs grafted with bone marrow alone. Histomorphometry, performed on the block ceramic implants indicated active resorption of ceramic. Clinically, addition of ceramic to a marrow graft improved the handling characteristics of the graft material and accelerated healing according to roentgenographic evaluation.\r"

  ".W": "Unicameral bone cyst fluid possesses N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase, beta-glucuronidase, PZ-peptidase, cathepsin D, acid phosphatase, N-acetyl-beta-D galactosaminidase, and beta-galactosidase activities. The activities of lysosomal enzymes in the cyst fluid are, as a rule, higher than in the serum, whereas the total protein content is lower. The content of collagen degradation products in the cyst fluid is higher compared to the serum. In bone cavity wall tissues, the collagen content is decreased. Adenosine 3':5'-cyclic phosphate and cyclic guanosine 3,5'-monophosphate accumulate in the cyst cavity. However, in some cases, there is no correlation among the activities of lysosomal enzymes in the cyst fluid, blood serum, and cyst wall tissues. The ratios of lysosomal enzyme activities in the cyst fluid differ from those in the cyst wall tissues, cultured skin fibroblasts, and blood polymorphonuclear leucocytes. The lack of coincidence of enzymatic spectra of the cyst fluid, wall tissues, and serum is suggestive of the diversity of ways of lysosomal enzyme enter the cyst cavity, i.e., blood, cyst fluid cells, and cyst cavity walls. The cysts with different locations (i.e., active and latent cysts) have similar lysosomal lytic potentials. The presence in the cyst cavity of extracellular lysosomal enzymes and collagen degradation products testifies to the permanent corrosion of the cyst cavity walls from the inside as well as to the increase in the osmotic pressure of the cyst fluid. Lysosome destruction should be regarded as an important pathogenetic factor that requires surgical or pharmacologic correction or both in the course of bone cyst management.\r"

The study included 23 boys and 13 girls with an average age of 5.3 years. The initial symptoms varied, but distinct clinical patterns emerged and were identifiable in different age groups. Both the leukocyte count and sedimentation rate were elevated. Routine roentgenograms were positive for intervertebral disk space narrowing in 82% of cases, technetium bone scans positive in 72%, and magnetic resonance imaging positive in all recent cases. Treatment consisted of bed rest for all patients, plaster casts for 50%, antibiotics for 40%, and traction for 23%. Regardless of the treatment combination, the course of the disease in most children is benign. At the completion of the study, all patients were asymptomatic including three children who had recurrences. In spite of being asymptomatic, 74% had persistent roentgenographic changes. The administration of antibiotics appears to be appropriate when indicated, i.e., failure to respond to immobilization. Disk space aspiration or biopsy should be reserved for those cases that are refractory to immobilization and antibiotics.\r"

  ".W": "The determination of the etiology of spinal cord compression in cancer patients is essential for appropriate therapy. Patients with metastatic disease are not immune to the development of superimposed nonmalignant disease. Although metastatic epidural compression may occur in up to 9% of breast cancer patients, care must be taken to rule out other nonmetastatic lesions causing compression. The association of concurrent breast carcinoma and a spinal neurilemoma simulating a metastatic lesion seems not to have been previously reported. A neurilemoma was observed in a 50-year-old woman. A neurilemoma suspected to be a metastatic lesion may produce the clinical features of pain, neurologic deficit, and weakness. Differentiation will be aided by roentgenograms, radionuclide bone scans, computed tomography, and possible magnetic resonance imaging. Radiologic differentiation hinges on the recognition and the slow-growing nature and noninvasive boundaries of the nonmalignant lesion. Ultimate verification is by biopsy. Treatment should consist of neurectomy, if severely symptomatic, and stabilization as indicated.\r"

Thumbs with narrow zones of injury showed a significantly higher survival rate than those with wide zones of injury. Eighty percent of those with poor arterial flow intraoperatively ultimately failed, despite pharmacologic treatment and multiple vein-graft anastomoses. Two thumbs with no vein repairs ultimately survived. Reexploration for loss of perfusion succeeded in 60% of cases. Total metacarpophalangeal and proximal interphalangeal active motion postoperatively averaged 68 degrees. Median static two-point discrimination returned to 11 mm. Avulsed thumbs survived in 46% of cases. Replantation should be attempted in all cases of thumb amputation, as success cannot be predicted by mechanism or severity of injury. Thumbs with poor intraoperative flow (20%) or no venous return (50%) can survive and should not be primarily amputated. Vein grafting is not mandatory if shortening allows anastomoses to be tension free. Prompt reexploration of acute vascular occlusions is worthwhile.\r"

DESIGN: Prospective, consecutive crossover controlled study. SETTING: Two surgical ICUs in a university hospital; ICU I with ten beds, ICU II with eight beds. PATIENTS: Two hundred patients entered the 1-yr trial. Fifty of 111 patients received selective flora suppression during the first 6 months in ICU I (test group), while 61 of 111 patients served as the control group in the following 6 months. In ICU II, 49 of 89 patients received no selective flora suppression in the first 6 months (control group), followed by 40 of 89 patients receiving selective flora suppression during the second 6-month period (test group). INTERVENTIONS: The test group got a mixture of nonabsorbable antibiotics (paste and suspension) in the digestive tract. The control group received paste and suspension without antimicrobial agents. All 200 patients received cefotaxime during the first 4 days. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: With the use of selective flora suppression, colonization with aerobic Gram-negative bacilli was significantly (p less than .01) reduced. There was also a significant reduction in nosocomial bronchopulmonary (ICU I and II; p less than .001) and urinary tract (ICU II; p less than .001) infections. The difference in mortality was not significant. There was no development of resistance against the antibiotics used during the limited period evaluated. CONCLUSIONS: Selective flora suppression is effective in reducing secondary colonization by aerobic Gram-negative bacilli. Reduction of bronchopulmonary and urinary tract infections most likely occurs with colonization prevention.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE: To develop and validate a mortality risk predictor based on physiologic data that estimates daily the probability of a patient dying within the next 24 hrs as that probability changes with disease and recovery. SETTING: Nine pediatric ICUs in tertiary care centers. Patients: Data from 1,401 patients (116 deaths, 5,521 days of care) were used for predictor development, and 1,227 patients (105 deaths, 4,597 days of care) provided data for predictor validation. METHODS: The predictor was developed by logistic regression analysis using the Pediatric Risk of Mortality scores of all previous days as potential predictor variables. Performance was measured by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (Az), and by the comparison of the daily predicted vs. observed patient status in five mortality risk groups (less than 0.01, 0.01 to 0.05, 0.05 to 0.15, 0.15 to 0.3, greater than 0.3) using chi-square goodness-of-fit tests. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Only the most recent and the admission day Pediatric Risk of Mortality scores (with a weighting ratio of 3:1) contributed significantly (p less than .05) to the prediction. The overall prediction attained an accuracy of Az = 0.904. The daily number and distribution of survivors and nonsurvivors in the five mortality risk groups were well predicted in the total sample (chi 2 [5 degrees of freedom] = 2.51; p greater than .75), and each ICU separately (chi 2 [5 degrees of freedom] range 2.41 to 7.96; all p greater than .15). This dynamic predictor improved (p less than .01) ICU outcome prediction over an admission-day predictor and, in the opinion of the authors, is essential for pediatric ICU efficiency analysis. CONCLUSIONS: The predictor is valid for assessing the 24-hr mortality risk in pediatric ICU patients hospitalized in other tertiary care institutions, different from those used for predictor development. The predicted mortality risks allow prospective patient stratification into risk groups. The ability of this predictor to follow risk changes over time expands its applicability over static predictors by enabling the charting of patient courses, and permitting ICU efficiency analysis.\r"

SETTING: Nutrition support service in a university tertiary care hospital. PATIENTS: Patients referred to the Nutrition Support Service with the diagnosis of pancreatitis. Excluded from study entry included those with cancer, obesity (greater than 150% ideal body weight), those measured within 3 postoperative days, or patients requiring ventilator support with an FIO2 of greater than 0.5. Forty-eight patients with either acute pancreatitis (n = 13), chronic pancreatitis (n = 24), acute pancreatitis with sepsis (n = 7), or chronic pancreatitis with sepsis (n = 7) were studied. The two septic groups were combined into a single pancreatitis-with-sepsis group, since no significant differences among measured variables were observed between individual septic groups. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Resting energy expenditure was measured by indirect calorimetry and compared with the predicted energy expenditure, as determined by the Harris-Benedict equations. Resting energy expenditure (percent of predicted energy expenditure) was significantly (p less than .02) greater for patients with pancreatitis complicated by sepsis (120 +/- 11%) compared with the nonseptic chronic pancreatitis group (105 +/- 14%). Resting energy expenditure for the nonseptic acute pancreatitis patients (112 +/- 17%) was not significantly different from the other groups. The septic pancreatitis group had the largest percentage (82%) of hypermetabolic (resting energy expenditure greater than 110% of predicted energy expenditure) patients, whereas 61% and 33% of the acute and chronic pancreatitis groups were hypermetabolic, respectively (p less than .02). CONCLUSIONS: Resting energy expenditure is variable in patients with pancreatitis (77% to 139% of predicted energy expenditure). The Harris-Benedict equations are an unreliable estimate of caloric expenditure. Septic complications are associated with hypermetabolism and may be the most important factor influencing resting energy expenditure in pancreatitis patients.\r"

DO2 ranged from 212 to 1550 mL/min.m2 with a maximum of 758 to 1550 mL/min.m2 (mean 1136). Because of the large variations between patients, it was not justifiable to describe a relationship for the pooled data and each case was analyzed individually. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We found the optimal regression model to be linear in 13 patients, cubic in four, and either cubic or linear in one. Two patients demonstrated no significant relationship. The relationship for the group was determined from each patient's data and was best described by linear regression.

INTERVENTIONS: Postoperatively, either glucose alone, glucose and a conventional amino acid solution, or glucose and a branch-chain amino acid enriched solution was infused. After ICU arrival (period 1) both conventional amino acid solution and branch-chain amino acid enriched solution groups received 0.15 g/kg-day of nitrogen as a conventional amino acid mixture (20% branch-chain amino acids). After rewarming (period 2), both groups received 0.18 g of nitrogen/kg-day for 2 hrs (branch-chain amino acid content 20% in the conventional amino acid solution and 35% in the branch-chain amino acid enriched solution), and for the following 2 hrs (period 3), 0.22 g of nitrogen/kg-day (branch-chain amino acid content 20% in the conventional amino acid solution and 50% in the branch-chain amino acid enriched solution).

DESIGN: Prospective case series. SETTING: Patients were drawn from the general surgical and ear, nose, and throat units of a tertiary care hospital. METHOD: All patients undergoing major surgery with or without a concurrent tracheostomy, in whom an NG tube was retained for greater than or equal to 48 hrs, were examined clinically and radiologically for evidence of maxillary sinus inflammation. RESULTS: Sixty-five patients were studied. Twenty patients had a concurrent tracheostomy and 45 patients were without tracheostomy. Only 10% of the patients in the tracheostomy group developed radiologic evidence of sinus inflammation, as compared with 50% in the nontracheostomy group (p less than .05). The proportion of patients who developed clinical evidence of rhinitis was about 75% in either group. However, none of the patients in the study had clinical evidence of maxillary sinusitis. There was no correlation between the age of the patient, sex, use of broad-spectrum antibiotics, or duration of NG intubation with the onset of sinus inflammation. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of NG tubes predisposes to nasal and maxillary sinus inflammation. Sinonasal symptoms of clinical sinusitis may not be present even when radiologic evidence of inflammation is evident. In patients with tracheostomy, the frequency of maxillary sinus inflammation is significantly lower than in those patients without tracheostomy.\r"

DESIGN: Prospective study. SETTING: Tertiary care, trauma center. PATIENTS: Twenty-one patients, postsurgical or posttrauma, judged septic by defined criteria. INTERVENTIONS: Serum lactic acid concentrations, DO2, and VO2 were measured before and after transfusion therapy. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Overall, the DO2 increased from 532 +/- 146 to 634 +/- 225 (SD) mL/min.m2 (p less than .001), and the VO2 increased from 145 +/- 39 to 160 +/- 56 mL/min.m2 (p = .02). These changes occurred with an Hgb increase from 9.3 +/- 1.1 to 10.7 +/- 1.5 g/dL (p less than .001). The patients were grouped by their pretransfusion serum lactic acid values. In those patients with normal (less than 1.6 mmol/dL) serum lactic acid (n = 10), DO2 increased from 560 +/- 113 to 676 +/- 178 mL/min.m2 (p less than .02), and VO2 increased from 150 +/- 25 to 183 +/- 46 mL/min.m2 (p less than .02). However, in the increased serum lactic acid group (n = 17), VO2 was not significantly changed after transfusion (143 +/- 46 to 146 +/- 58 mL/min.m2) despite increased DO2 (515 +/- 163 to 609 +/- 251 mL/min.m2, p less than .01). CONCLUSIONS: Blood transfusion can be used to augment DO2 and VO2 in septic surgical patients. Increased serum lactic acid values do not predict patients who will respond. The absence of lactic acidosis should not be used in this patient population to justify withholding blood transfusions to improve flow-dependent VO2. Patients who have increased lactate concentrations may have a peripheral oxygen utilization defect that prevents improvement in VO2 with increasing DO2.\r"

Outcomes were categorized as bad (death or chronic vegetative state) or good (all other outcomes). Survivor outcomes were determined at discharge and on subsequent follow-up visits from 1 to 3 yrs later. There were no false pessimistic predictions, and two false optimistic predictions in this series. A comprehensive literature review of coma outcome prediction, using multimodality-evoked potential recordings, revealed 20 series with 982 additional patients in whom the predictive errors of false optimism and false pessimism could be determined. Five cases of false pessimism and 99 cases of false optimism were identified in the 982 additional patients. If neonates are excluded, the false pessimism number is reduced to three. CONCLUSIONS: A bad outcome can be reliably predicted using multimodality-evoked potential recordings with little chance of a false pessimistic prediction. The acceptable error of false optimism occurs frequently, since patients often die of progressive neurologic and nonneurologic problems that may or may not be present at the time of the evoked potential recordings. Thus, in comatose children, multimodality-evoked potential recordings are a useful adjunct to clinical examination and other diagnostic aids in predicting outcome and in making decisions regarding the degree of intervention to offer.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of a dobutamine infusion on the relationship between oxygen consumption (VO2) and oxygen delivery (DO2) after endotoxin administration, as well as the rate of fluid and protein loss from permeability-injured tissue. METHODS: Unanesthetized adult sheep with lung and soft-tissue lymph fistulas were given 5 micrograms/kg Escherichia coli endotoxin alone, or E. coli endotoxin plus a continuous infusion of dobutamine (10 to 15 micrograms/kg.min) beginning at 3 hrs. Lymph flow reflected the vascular permeability and surface area perfused. Data were compared with dobutamine alone and with controls. Filling pressures were maintained at baseline. RESULTS: Dobutamine alone produced a 75% increase in DO2, a transient 10 +/- 4% increase in VO2, but no increase in lung or soft-tissue lymph flow. Beginning at 3 hrs after endotoxin alone, a significant increase in protein-rich lung and soft-tissue lymph flow was noted, but only a transient 14 +/- 5% increase in VO2. Plasma proteins were slightly decreased. With the addition of dobutamine at 3 hrs postendotoxin, DO2 increased by greater than 50% for the 3-hr infusion period, while VO2 increased for a 30-min period by 25 +/- 8%, which was not different than endotoxin alone. Lung and soft-tissue lymph flow did not increase further, but plasma proteins did decrease significantly compared with controls and with endotoxin alone. CONCLUSION: Increasing DO2 with dobutamine postendotoxin does not increase the surface area perfused or the edema process, at least in lung and soft tissue. Therefore, no microvessels in these tissues are reopened with dobutamine when normal filling pressures are present. Dobutamine administration does not increase VO2 more than the increase seen with endotoxin alone.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND AND METHODS: To determine the effects of reduced cerebral perfusion pressures produced by hemorrhage alone or in combination with intracranial hypertension on thromboxane A2 (TxA2) production, we undertook a randomized study in 38 anesthetized, mongrel dogs. Animals were subjected to 30 mins of hemorrhagic shock with normal (group 1) or increased (group 2) intracranial pressure (ICP). Group 1 animals (n = 22) were hemorrhaged to reduce cerebral perfusion pressure to 40 mm Hg for 30 mins. In group 2 (n = 16), cerebral perfusion pressure was reduced by the combination of less severe hypotension and intracranial hypertension (20 mm Hg). Cerebral and systemic hemodynamic measurements were recorded, including cerebral blood flow (sagittal sinus outflow method); ICP; cerebral perfusion pressure; and arterial and cerebral venous concentrations of TxB2 (double-antibody radioimmunoassay technique), the major metabolite of TxA2. Data were obtained at baseline and at the beginning and end of the 30-min shock period. RESULTS: Hemorrhagic shock significantly (p less than .05) decreased cerebral blood flow in both groups. At the beginning of the shock period, cerebral blood flow was higher in group 1 than in group 2 (p less than .05) and venous-arterial differences in TxB2 increased significantly (p less than .05) in group 2, but not in group 1. At the end of the 30-min shock period, venous-arterial levels of TxB2 remained significantly (p less than .05) higher in group 2. CONCLUSIONS: Increased cerebral production of TxA2 during hypotension accompanied by intracranial hypertension may contribute to the severity of neural damage produced by the combination of head trauma and shock.\r"

The present study was designed to examine the effect of acute ethanol intoxication on resuscitation of rats subjected to cardiac arrest. Rats were given 1.2 g (\"moderately intoxicated\") or 2.4 g (\"highly intoxicated\") of ethanol/kg, or distilled water (\"nonintoxicated\" rats). Using a standardized technique, we induced cardiac arrest. CPR was then attempted using chest compressions interposed with abdominal compressions. Resuscitation was said to be successful if BP returned spontaneously within 6 mins of institution of chest compressions interposed with abdominal compressions, and if systolic BP was 50% of its prearrest level within 10 mins of discontinuation of chest compressions interposed with abdominal compressions. Mean +/- SD serum ethanol levels were 121.3 +/- 12.9 mg/dL (26.3 +/- 2.8 mmol/L) (moderately intoxicated rats) and 254.4 +/- 34.6 mg/dL (55.2 +/- 7.5 mmol/L) (highly intoxicated rats). RESULTS: Resuscitation was successful in 75% (15/20) of nonintoxicated rats, 46.7% (7/15) of moderately intoxicated rats, and 33.3% (5/15) of highly intoxicated rats. The difference in resuscitation rates was significant for nonintoxicated rats compared with either intoxicated rats as a group (p = .021) or highly intoxicated rats (p = .019), but was not significant for nonintoxicated rats compared with moderately intoxicated rats. CONCLUSION: Acute ethanol intoxication appears to decrease the likelihood of successful resuscitation in a dose-dependent fashion.\r"

Data were analyzed using repeated-measures analysis of variance; p less than .05 was considered significant. RESULTS: Amitriptyline intoxication lowered cardiac output, peak left ventricular dP/dt, and mean arterial pressure (MAP). All doses of norepinephrine and the two higher doses of dopamine increased cardiac output, MAP, and peak left ventricular dP/dt during the intoxicated state. Both agents restored all variables to preintoxication values. Values obtained at the highest doses of the two drugs were not different for any variable.

MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: There were 150 catheters inserted in 123 patients for a mean duration of 6.4 days. There were no major complications including catheter-related sepsis. Minor complications consisted of arterial puncture (9.3%), local bleeding (10%), and local inflammation (4.7%). Critical care fellows had a significantly lower rate (6%) of insertion complications than interns or medical students (16%). We did not specifically look at the frequency of deep venous thrombosis. CONCLUSIONS: Femoral venous catheterization offers an alternative site of insertion to the subclavian and jugular veins for central venous access in the critically ill. The occurrence rate of clinically important complications is acceptably low.\r"

PATIENTS: Thirty-three open-heart surgery patients, mean age 52 yrs, were studied immediately after open-heart surgery and in the ICU after the operation. MAIN RESULTS: Saturation display in different oximeters was equally reliable in situations of poor cardiac index (less than or equal to 2.2 L/min.m2) and low peripheral temperature (less than or equal to 28 degrees C), as in control situations. However, there were statistically significant differences between the equipment. The heart rate display was also reliable in these situations.

DESIGN: Central venous port cardiac output measurements were compared with right ventricular port cardiac output measurements using the same right-heart catheter. SETTING: The general ICU of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. PATIENTS: Forty-seven critically ill cancer patients with 60 different right-heart catheters were evaluated. INTERVENTION: Four injections of 10 mL of iced normal saline were made through each port, with the results of the last three injections averaged. Cardiac output determinations from both ports were completed in less than 10 min. The order of port injection was random. RESULTS: No difference was noted between cardiac output determinations from the two ports (paired t-test). Twenty-five of 50 right-heart catheters were in the right ventricle, with the other 25 in the right atrium. A comparison of ports in the 25 catheters that were in the right ventricle showed no difference with a significant (p less than .01, r2 = .94) correlation. CONCLUSION: Thermodilution cardiac output measurements using 10 mL of iced saline can be determined accurately using the right ventricular port if the central venous port becomes nonfunctional.\r"

Although all laser procedures were free from complications, necrotic cavitation in five cases, two of which were accompanied by large bronchoesophageal fistulas, and massive fatal hemoptysis occurred in six. Minor complications included radiation mucositis (two), noncritical mucosal scarring (two), and cough (four). Characteristics that will identify patients at risk of developing fatal hemoptysis and fistulas should be better defined by imaging and endoscopic techniques. In such cases, modifying the protocol or using alternative procedures should be considered.

  ".W": "To determine correlates of acute vasodilator responsiveness in primary pulmonary hypertension, we retrospectively studied 25 patients, comparing 41 resting echo/Doppler and nine resting catheterization variables with the maximal reduction in pulmonary vascular resistance achieved during vasodilator trials. Twelve vasodilators were tested (mean, 5.6 drugs per patient; range, three to eight). Eight patients were vasodilator responsive, as defined by a reduction in pulmonary vascular resistance greater than or equal to 30 percent in response to at least one agent. Univariate and multivariate analyses revealed only Doppler pulmonic peak flow velocity to be an independent correlate of responsiveness (p less than 0.05). Responders differed from nonresponders in having a higher Doppler pulmonic peak flow velocity (PV) (SD 81 +/- 24 vs 64 +/- 15 cm/s; p = 0.05), lower mean right atrial pressure (RAP) (6 +/- 4 vs 13 +/- 7 mm Hg; p = 0.04), and longer median survival (37 vs 5 months; p = 0.03). Seven of eight responders had RAP less than or equal to 10 mm Hg, and all responders had PV greater than 60 cm/s. Seven of ten patients with both RAP less than or equal to 10 and PV greater than 60 and one of the 15 remaining patients were vasodilator responsive (p less than 0.001). Thus, echo/Doppler and invasive hemodynamic parameters correlate with acute vasodilator responsiveness in primary pulmonary hypertension. Patients with low PV and high RAP values were almost never vasodilator responsive. Doppler pulmonic peak velocity and mean RAP may be useful in identifying patients most likely to respond to acute vasodilator trials and those in whom testing is unlikely to yield positive results.\r"

We examined the relationship of changes in forearm arterial, venous, and microvascular tone to the severity of sepsis. The study population consisted of ten control patients, 15 patients with sepsis, and eight patients with sepsis and shock. Patients treated with inotropic, vasopressor, or vasodilator drugs were excluded from the study. Forearm venous capacity (MVC), forearm venous tone (F-VT), arterial blood flow (FBF), forearm arterial resistance (FAR), and hyperemic response (FBF-RH) were measured using air plethysmography. MVC was decreased and VT increased in septic and septic shock patients. FBF was decreased with modest increases in FAR in septic and septic shock patients. FBF-RH was significantly reduced in both septic and septic shock patients. Decreases in FVT and attenuation of the reactive response to hyperemia occurred early in sepsis in patients without clinical evidence of hypoperfusion. In our patients, progressive vasodilatation in skeletal muscle was not associated with severe sepsis. These changes appear to be proportional to the severity of sepsis and are most pronounced in patients with circulatory failure.\r"

The upper frequency limit of inspiratory sounds was higher in CFA than in COPD or in HF. The period of crackling was shorter in COPD than in CFA or BE. Inspiratory crackling terminated significantly earlier in COPD than in CFA, BE, or HF. The initial deflection width and the two-cycle duration of the expanded waveforms of crackles were smaller in CFA than in BE, COPD, or HF. The largest deflection width was smaller in CFA than in BE, HF, or COPD and smaller in BE than in HF. The results indicate that crackling lung sounds in different diseases have distinctive features and that their analysis can be of diagnostic value.\r"

This study was designed to determine whether atropine sulfate, the only anticholinergic agent currently available in the United States for nebulization, increases bronchodilation when added to an inhaled beta-adrenergic agonist during the initial treatment of an acute asthma attack. Adults asthmatics (n = 40) with acute asthma attacks were randomized to receive metaproterenol (5 percent solution, 0.3 ml) either alone or with atropine sulfate (2.5 mg), by nebulization. Spirometry, vital signs, and the presence of side effects 0, 30, 60, and 120 minutes after treatment were determined. There were no significant differences between the metaproterenol alone and metaproterenol plus atropine sulfate groups in regard to age, duration of asthma, baseline spirometry, or side effects. No differences were noted between the two groups regarding changes in FEV1 and FVC from baseline (expressed in milliliters or as a percentage of baseline) during the observation period. We conclude that nebulized atropine sulfate yields no additional benefit when added to metaproterenol during the initial treatment of an acute asthma attack.\r"

Among the responders, daily PEFR measures improved significantly more during treatment with albuterol (12 +/- 32 L/min) than with placebo (-0.4 +/- 19 L/min; p less than 0.05). In addition, a clinically important level of improvement in PEFR (15 percent increase) was reached significantly more frequently in the responders. Methacholine nonresponders had no change in PEFR on either albuterol or placebo. Daily symptom scores as well as spirometry measurements at biweekly visits did not show significant changes. We conclude that long-term therapy with inhaled albuterol improves lung function in CF patients, but only in those with bronchial hyperresponsiveness as demonstrated by methacholine challenge.\r"

After spraying each drug into the anterior nares, vasoconstriction, decongestion, and nasal anesthesia (measured as transnasal depth of nasogastric (NG) tube insertion before discomfort) were assessed. There were no significant differences in NG tube insertion depth between the regimens (p = 0.54). Insertion depth was significantly increased after 10 ml of 2 percent viscous lidocaine were sniffed (p less than 0.004), but again, differences between regimens were not significant (p = 0.051). One hundred bronchoscoped patients received one of the following sprayed into the nose: 1) placebo (P); 2) 1 percent phenylephrine + P; 3) 1 percent phenylephrine + 4 percent lidocaine; or 4) 5 percent cocaine + P. Each patient then sniffed viscous lidocaine. There were no significant differences between regimens for any of the following: 1) nasal resistance to bronchoscope insertion, 2) patient's nasal discomfort, or 3) bronchoscopist's perception of patient discomfort.

  ".W": "Previously established criteria were used to classify 253 pleural effusions as transudates (65 cases), neoplastic exudates (67 cases), tuberculous exudates (65 cases), or miscellaneous exudate (56 cases). The parameters pleural LDH (PLDH), pleural LDH/serum LDH ratio (P/SLDH), and pleural protein/serum protein ratio (P/SPROT) were compared with pleural cholesterol (PCHOL) and the pleural cholesterol/serum cholesterol ratio (P/SCHOL) with regard to their usefulness for distinguishing between pleural exudates and transudates. The PCHOL values determined were 28.5 +/- 12.8 mg/dl for transudates, 88.1 +/- 30 mg/dl for neoplastic exudates, 96.5 +/- 28 mg/dl for tuberculous exudates, and 88 +/- 35.9 mg/dl for the miscellaneous group; the differences between the transudate group and the others are statistically significant (p less than 0.001). The sensitivity and specificity of P/SPROT for diagnosis of exudates were both 89 percent; the sensitivity of PLDH was 67 percent and its specificity was 95 percent; the sensitivity and specificity of P/SLDH were both 84.6 percent. Using Light's three criteria as a battery, the sensitivity was 94.6 percent and its specificity was 78.4 percent. All the transudates and 17 (9 percent) of the 188 exudates had PCHOL values below 55 mg/dl, so that with this threshold, PCHOL had a sensitivity of 91 percent and a specificity of 100 percent for diagnosis of exudates. With a threshold of 0.3, P/SCHOL had a sensitivity of 92.5 percent and a specificity of 87.6 percent. The number of misclassifications by PCHOL was less than with any other of the parameters, with statistically significant differences with respect to PLDH (p less than 0.001) and P/SLDH (p less than 0.01). We conclude that determination of PCHOL and P/SCHOL is of great value for distinguishing between pleural exudates and transudates, and should be included in routine laboratory analysis of pleural effusions.\r"

In our initial observations, effusions were benign, were not always associated with congestive heart failure (CHF), and reaccumulated following thoracentesis. Effusions associated with CHF persisted despite medical treatment and improvement of CHF. In our study of 40 patients with similar degrees of left ventricular dysfunction, the incidence of pleural effusions in diabetic patients was 83 percent and in our nondiabetic patients was 14 percent (p less than 0.001). We conclude that pleural effusions occur more commonly in diabetic than nondiabetic patients and may be related to left ventricular dysfunction and possibly other factors leading to increased effusion.\r"

In a randomized, double-blind trial, 16 male patients undergoing elective coronary artery bypass surgery received four daily infusions of conjugated estrogens (0.6 mg/kg/day) or placebo, preoperatively. Groups were similar with respect to age, preoperative hemostatic profiles, and pump time. Conjugated estrogens significantly reduced greater saphenous vein endothelial prostacyclin production in the estrogen group compared to control subjects. Postoperative blood loss was not reduced, with a trend toward increased blood loss in the treatment group. We have shown that conjugated estrogens reduce endothelial prostacyclin production and fail to reduce blood loss in coronary bypass surgery.\r"

The present investigation has used the US Veterans Administration (VA) hospital computer database to determine whether trends in CLD case fatality follow trends in CLD population mortality. Data for male patients discharged from 172 VA hospitals from 1970 through 1987 were utilized. Patients were included if they had a CLD as a first-listed hospital discharge diagnosis, did not have any of a number of smoking-related cardiovascular or malignant diseases, and were born in the years 1900 through 1939. While crude case fatality for all CLD increased from 5.2 percent in 1970 to 7.4 percent in 1987, age-adjusted case fatality decreased from a peak of 8.5 percent in 1971 to 5.8 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 5.4 to 6.61 percent) in 1987. This trend was seen for all CLD diagnoses, including asthma. Age-specific case fatality decreased for each successive 5-year birth cohort, and age at death remained relatively constant over the last 14 years of the study. The declining case fatality could not be explained by changes in the ICD coding rubrics. The extent to which case fatality has been declining due to improved treatment and/or cohort-related changes in tobacco smoke exposure could not be determined definitively from the data.\r"

The data were analyzed by age, sex, race and site of the disease which were compared with the national statistics during the periods. We observed that 11.3 percent of the total TB cases were extrapulmonary. Unlike national statistics, the proportion of extrapulmonary tuberculosis had remained unchanged between the two study periods. Except for a significant decline (p less than 0.001) in genitourinary tuberculosis, the incidence of other extrapulmonary TB had remained the same. The higher incidences of lymphatic, miliary, and meningeal TB were noted in nonwhites, particularly in the younger population, during both study periods. While the national trend showed a steady increase in the percentage of extrapulmonary TB cases, there was no change in Tennessee. The reason for a continued decline of GU TB remains unclear. Although AIDS may have contributed toward the increase nationally, fewer cases of AIDS in the state have not influenced the proportion of extrapulmonary TB. Awareness of such regional differences in the epidemiology of TB, and the impact of HIV infection, will be very useful to physicians and other health care providers involved in the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of tuberculosis.\r"

However, different studies have used different delivery systems, making comparison of results difficult. This study was designed to determine the dose to the lung, regional distribution, extrapulmonary deposition, and side effects using four different delivery systems: the Respirgard II, the Aero Tech II, the Portasonic, and the Fisoneb. Ten homosexual subjects who were infected with HIV virus were studied. Particle size, as determined by cascade impaction, varied among nebulizers. Mass median aerodynamic diameter was 0.90 mu for the Respirgard II, 1.30 mu for the Aero Tech II, 1.40 mu for the Portasonic, and 3.90 mu for the Fisoneb. Subjects inhaled a solution containing 60 mg pentamidine in 3 ml of sterile water, and 1 ml of 99mTc bound to human serum albumin for each nebulizer system. Regional distribution was determined by comparing each deposition scan obtained by a posteriorly positioned gamma camera to the subjects' equilibrium xeon scan. The deposition scan was used to quantitate lung dose and extrapulmonary deposition. Marked differences were seen among delivery systems. Dose to the lung varied fivefold. The deposition in the lung, expressed as a percentage of the amount placed in the nebulizer, was 5.3 percent in the Respirgard II, 15.7 percent in the Aero Tech II, 17.30 percent in the Portasonic, and 26.4 percent in the Fisoneb (p less than 0.0001 by ANOVA). Wide differences in extrapulmonary deposition and side effects were noted among nebulizers (Fisoneb greater than Portasonic, Aero Tech II greater than Respirgard II). Regional distribution in the lung as measured by the AI, also showed differences, with the Respirgard having the most homogeneous distribution of aerosol (Respirgard greater than Portasonic, Aero Tech greater than Fisoneb). Regional distribution and extrapulmonary deposition varied in a manner consistent with the particle size of the nebulizers. These data should provide a framework for the comparison and design of future clinical studies using these delivery systems.\r"

Oxygen saturation oscillations, related to successive apneas in SAS or to apneic episodes in COPD or restrictive patients, were quantified using a new index: delta = 1/n sigma 1 n magnitude of delta(SaO2)/delta(t)(12-s intervals) Twenty-six patients (15 SAS, 8 COPD, and 3 restrictive patients) were included in a prospective study comparing nocturnal oximetry and polysomnography over 34 nights. In apneic patients, we found a strong correlation (r2 = 0.73, p less than 0.01) between time spent in apnea and the delta index. In COPD, the number of apneas was also correlated to the delta index (r2 = 0.92, p less than 0.01). A lower threshold for delta of 1.5 is accurate enough to detect apneas if initial SaO2 is greater than 93 percent. If initial SaO2 is greater than 93 percent, the delta threshold should be 0.8 (sensitivity 95 percent). Such a method could contribute to the accurate selection of patients for polysomnography.\r"

Delay in treatment was defined as greater than 3 days from recognition of empyema to CT and greater than 14 days to OD or DC when chest tubes were inadequate or were not used initially. Delay in OD significantly increased total illness (p = 0.023), days until removal of chest tubes (p = 0.037), and hospital stay (p = .048), but did not affect postoperative stay. Delay in DC increased total illness (p = 0.0001), but did not affect other variables. Delay in CT increased mortality from 3.4 percent to 16 percent. Delay did not increase mortality in OD and DC. DC was superior to OD in patients requiring major operation in total illness days (DC = 36.1 vs OD = 106.1) (p = 0.0005), days until removal of tubes (DC = 7.5 vs OD = 78.3) (p = 0.0001), and postoperative stay (DC = 11.6 vs OD = 17.3) (p = 0.018). Overall mortality was lowest in the DC group (6.1 percent). Delay in treatment increases morbidity and DC is more effective than OD in reducing morbidity and mortality when surgical intervention is necessary.\r"

Hemodynamic measurements included TEE registration of the LV cross-sectional areas, diameters and wall thickness as well as arterial blood pressure and heart rate. As a result, we found no significant differences in the hemodynamic effects of all three patterns.

  ".W": "Tuberculin skin test reactivity decreases with time such that repeat PPD skin testing may result in reactions of less than 10 mm. This reactivity may be boosted in some individuals with a second tuberculin skin test. The immunologic basis of these observations remains unclear. We studied the relationship between skin-test reactivity and in vitro blastogenic response to PPD in a cohort of 22 individuals (aged 28 to 81 years) known to be tuberculin reactors (induration greater than or equal to 10 mm) in 1970. In 1989, 18 subjects remained reactive to PPD on the first skin test and responded to PPD in vitro (mean incorporation of 3H-thymidine by peripheral blood mononuclear cells, 22,650 cpm). Three subjects reverted (induration in response to PPD less than 10 mm) and lost in vitro reactivity to PPD (mean incorporation of 3H-thymidine, 2,205 cpm). One subject boosted (increase of induration of at least 6 mm to greater than or equal to 15 mm) on the second skin test and showed a concomitant in vitro boost in the blastogenic response to PPD (from 1,008 cpm to 47,837 cpm). In this cohort, interpretation of the two-step tuberculin skin test correlated closely with in vitro proliferative responses. Over a 19-year period, the majority of individuals maintained skin test reactivity and strong in vitro responses to PPD despite a lack of ongoing exogenous exposure to Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The immunologic basis for reversion appears to depend in part on a loss of lymphocyte blastogenic capacity. In the one individual who exhibited the booster phenomenon, repeat antigen stimulation resulted in a dramatic increase in the in vitro blastogenic responses.\r"

  ".W": "To assess the value of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) for diagnosis, understanding, and treatment of amiodarone-associated pneumonitis, we examined the results of BAL total and differential cell counts and phenotyping of lymphocytes in 22 patients with this lung disorder and in 33 normal subjects. Overall, the total cell count was found to be almost the same as that seen in control subjects; the macrophage population was significantly reduced, and the lymphocyte, neutrophil, and eosinophil populations were increased in absolute number and percentage. When results were analyzed individually, BAL data appeared to be distributed according to two patterns. In the first pattern, there was no abnormal lymphocytosis. In the second pattern a lymphocyte alveolitis was found in percentage and in absolute number. This lymphocyte alveolitis was present either alone or associated with neutrophil alveolitis or with eosinophil alveolitis. In the first pattern, despite the normal level of the lymphocyte population, the percentage of CD4 T-lymphocytes and the CD4:CD8 T-lymphocyte ratio were significantly lowered. In the second pattern the CD8 T-lymphocyte count was increased in absolute number and percentage, with a low CD4:CD8 ratio. In six patients relavaged two to four months after amiodarone withdrawal, there was a significant fall in alveolar lymphocytosis, but the progressive increase in the neutrophil population over time seemed to be associated with the seriousness and progression of the disease. Finally, these findings closely resembled those obtained in patients with hypersensitivity pneumonitis due to inhalation of organic dust and suggest that an underlying immunologic cell-mediated mechanism may play a role in this iatrogenic pulmonary disease.\r"

Airway impedance was measured by the oscillator technique during quiet breathing; both measurements were made twice after each increment of histamine during the challenge. Percentage change in impedance was related to percentage change in FEV1 according to: -delta z = 1.09-2.66 (delta FEV1), r = -0.73, p less than 0.01, ie, impedance increased on average 2.7 times as much as FEV1 fell. The cut-off point for the standard test is the histamine concentration giving a 20 percent fall of FEV1 (PC20(FEV1)). The corresponding cut-off value chosen for impedance was a 30 percent increase (PC30(z)). (PC30(z)) = 0.74 (PC20(FEV1))-0.48, rs = 0.88, where rs is the Spearman rank correlation coefficient. Thus, impedance is a more sensitive index than FEV1 because a smaller dose of histamine gave a diagnostic result. Impedance is a practical alternative to FEV1, being less arduous for the patient and requiring little cooperation.\r"

In normal subjects, in A, NPV resulted in a partial suppression of EMGd; in B, prior to NPV, EMGd rose compared with A prior to NPV. In patients, in A, NPV resulted in a suppression of both EMGd and EMGint. In B, prior to NPV, both EMGd and EMGint rose compared with A prior to NPV. Thus, it seems that NPV is able to produce a consistent reduction in inspiratory muscle EMG activity.

Identifying situations in which individuals with COPD experience low self-efficacy would allow the development of specific treatment interventions designed to increase the patient's self-efficacy in those situations and consequently increase activity. We developed a 34-item COPD Self-Efficacy Scale (CSES) to assess self-efficacy in individuals afflicted with COPD. The CSES has good test-retest reliability (r = .77), excellent internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = .95), and a five-factor structure (negative affect, intense emotional arousal, physical exertion, weather/environmental, and behavioral risk factors.\r"

Six normal volunteers underwent intravenous loading with MSG, 9 g, in a randomized, double-blind, saline placebo controlled crossover study. Four of the six subjects had a greater than 10 percent fall in peak (NH4+) following MSG (37 +/- 2.0 vs 25 +/- 4.3 micrograms/dl p = 0.003, PLB vs MSG). When MSG blunted the rise in venous (NH4+) during exercise, uncoupling of the LT and VT was observed. Specifically, with suppression of peak exercise (NH4+) by MSG, the LT was delayed (r = -0.84, p = 0.03), the VT was earlier (r = 0.86, p = 0.02), and the VO2 difference between the LT and VT widened (r = -0.90, p = 0.02).

Twelve of 15 cases (80 percent) were diploid and the remaining three cases (20 percent) were aneuploid. Two patients with aneuploid histograms were free of tumor at the time follow-up; the third patient experienced local tumor recurrence and metastases. Five patients with diploid myxomas demonstrated an elevated (greater than or equal to 17 percent) proliferative cell cycle fraction; four of these patients experienced embolic phenomenon or tumor recurrence. This pilot study suggests that an atrial myxoma with either aneuploid DNA content or elevated proliferative fraction may be associated with aggressive biologic behavior.\r"

The mother and one child had clinical pulmonary hypertension, whereas two siblings had cyanosis and preclinical pulmonary vascular disease as evidenced by abnormal perfusion lung scans and elevated levels of fibrinopeptide A in the face of normal pulmonary hemodynamics. In one, pulmonary hypertension could be induced with exercise. The studies on this family support the hypothesis that primary pulmonary hypertension may be initiated by abnormalities of the pulmonary vascular bed that predispose to in situ thrombosis. The possible common genetic transmission of the two diseases offers the speculation that the gene that confers predisposition to pulmonary hypertension may be located near the gene responsible for beta globulin.\r"

  ".W": "We tested the response characteristics of a dual transcutaneous (tc) PO2/PCO2 monitoring system in healthy subjects who breathed various gas mixtures, and we compared steady-state tc readings to simultaneous arterial blood gas analysis in 20 stable respiratory outpatients. The electrodes were simple to apply, required very little skin preparation, and had trivial signal drift. In healthy subjects, tcPCO2 lag time during CO2 rebreathing was 16.8 seconds, with a 90 percent response time of 77.9 seconds after CO2 breathing was discontinued. The 90 percent response times of the O2 electrode when subjects breathed a hypoxic mixture was 257 seconds after a lag of 31 seconds. When inhaled gas mixtures were changed from hypoxia to room air, the lag time was shorter (12.5 seconds), but 90 percent response time exceeded 5 minutes. In stable patients with respiratory disease, tcPCO2 and tcPO2 were linearly related to PaCO2 (range, 19 to 53 mm Hg) and PaO2 (range, 45 to 99 mm Hg), respectively (tcPCO2 = 1.4 PaCO2-9.44, with r = 0.90 and SEE = 5.35 mm Hg; tcPO2 = 0.56 PaO2 + 20.4, with r = 0.53 and SEE = 11.7 mm Hg). We conclude that the response of the dual transcutaneous monitoring system is more rapid for the CO2 than the O2 electrode and may be rapid enough to be useful in some clinical settings; however, the O2 system fails to offer the response characteristics and accuracy that would allow it to be substituted for arterial gas tensions in unstable clinical situations.\r"

To facilitate intermittent positive pressure ventilation (IPPV), we have used continuous IV thiopental (thiopentone) together with traditional ventilatory techniques. With this policy, we were able to achieve rapid correction of arterial blood gas tensions in a group of 20 severe asthmatics requiring IPPV. By 1 hour, peak airway pressure (PAP) had fallen from 58.6 +/- 15.7 to 30.2 +/- 10.9 cm H2O (p less than 0.001). During the same period, PaCO2 fell from 51.3 +/- 15.3 to 40.17 +/- 8.2 mm Hg (p less than 0.05) and pH rose from 7.25 +/- 0.1 to 7.33 +/- 0.1 (p less than 0.001). Morbidity was low and in particular, no episode of barotrauma was noted. All patients survived the acute attack and were successfully liberated from the ventilator. We conclude that these results are largely attributable to our use of early and continuous IV anesthesia induced by thiopental.\r"

Fifty-six patients survived to hospital discharge. APACHE II scores were not helpful in prediction. Multiple logistic regression models to predict outcome were developed using variables present at the time of intubation and 24 hours later. The model at the time of intubation indicated mortality was related to systolic blood pressure less than 130 mm Hg, the presence of anterior myocardial infarction, use of calcium channel blockers, age, and absence of prior hospitalization for CPE. A model using additional variables available 24 hours later showed that mortality was related only to the need for vasopressor medication at 24 hours, and systolic blood pressure at intubation less than 130 mm Hg. The predictive power of these models was confirmed by applying them to 46 additional patients. The variables contained in these models suggest that the prognosis of patients with CPE treated with mechanical ventilation depends primarily on the severity of acute left ventricular injury. Variables relating the degree of respiratory failure, however, were not predictive of mortality. These multiple logistic regression models provide a means to compare patients with CPE for quality assessment purposes and for studies of treatment regimens, and may also provide information useful to patient and family counseling regarding the value of continued aggressive intensive care.\r"

The effect of varying levels of CPPV on PaO2 and cardiac output (Q) has been previously assessed by adjusting the level of PEEP at constant VT. This study examined the influence of a 200-ml reduction in VT, at a constant PEEP of 15 cm H2O, on the PaO2 and Q of 21 patients with adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The relationship between change in Q and change in total respiratory system compliance (Cst) after VT reduction was also examined. VT reduction from 14.1 +/- 0.8 ml/kg to 11.2 +/- 0.9 ml/kg yielded an increase in Q (+ 15 +/- 12 percent, p less than 0.01) without a significant change in PaO2 (-6.3 +/- 15.0 mm Hg, p = 0.08). Cst increased with VT reduction (+ 3.1 +/- 1.8 ml/cm H2O). There was only a modest correlation (r = +0.42, p = 0.06) between delta Q percent and delta Cst following VT reduction. VT reduction at high level PEEP may yield a significant improvement in Q and net O2 delivery, but the degree of hemodynamic improvement is variable and is not reliably predicted noninvasively by measurement of Cst.\r"

Pulmonary function tests performed at least one year after ARDS were also used for analysis. Percent predicted Dco, TLC, DL/VA, and FVC were regressed against extent, severity, and combined scores.

DESIGN: Repeat coronary angiography after two year treatment and evaluation of changes in coronary narrowings. SETTING: Subjects with effort angina of recent onset requiring coronary angiography and medical treatment. PATIENTS: 80 untreated patients, with a greater than or equal to 50 percent focal narrowing on a major coronary branch associated or not with a less than 50 percent stenosis of other major branches. They were randomized to isosorbide dinitrate (40 mg bid) (group 1, control group) or to propranolol (80 mg qid) (group 2, treatment group). RESULTS: At restudy, there were more diseased vessels and These narrowings per patient in both groups. Multivessel involvement and greater than or equal to 50 percent obstructions were also augmented. These changes were not statistically significant. Patients with progression of the stenotic tracts (both greater than or equal to 50 percent and less than 50 percent were 19 (48 percent) in group 1 and 28 (70 percent) in group 2 (p less than 0.05). Narrowings with progression were 25 in group 1 and 48 in group 2. Thirteen narrowings in group 1 and 15 in group 2 were newly detected at restudy. Eighteen patients (45 percent) in group 1 and nine (23 percent) in group 2 had a steady disease. Smoking, high blood pressure, family history of coronary disease, blood glucose values and lipid levels were considered; the only significant group differences were 31 percent rise of total triglyceride and 23 percent decrease of HDL cholesterol in patients who were treated with propranolol. CONCLUSIONS: Propranolol showed an adverse influence on coronary atherosclerosis, regarding the evolution of both greater than or equal to 50 percent and less than 50 percent narrowings and not the formation of new stenoses. Changes in serum lipid values might have a role.\r"

  ".W": "The adverse effects of prolonged immobility are due primarily to gravitational effects on blood flow and ventilation, impairment of the normal mucociliary escalator and possibly an increase in extravascular lung water. However, CLRT theoretically should reverse these abnormalities. The sequence of events that culminate in LRTI or pneumonia is unclear; however, low tidal volumes, increased extravascular lung water and the accumulation of bronchopulmonary secretions may lead to atelectasis, a well-known precursor of pneumonia. Three prospective, randomized studies evaluating patients with acute head trauma, orthopedic injuries requiring traction and blunt chest trauma all showed a decreased incidence of LRTI or pneumonia with CLRT compared with those treated in a conventional bed and turned every 2 h by the nursing staff. In general, the methodology was sound with early randomization, use of precise criteria to define LRTI and pneumonia and appropriate observation. The fourth study performed in a medical ICU with a heterogeneous group of patients did not show a difference in incidence of nosocomial pneumonia between treatment in CLRT and a conventional bed, but did show a decreased length of ICU stay for patients with pneumonia treated with CLRT. It appears that if CLRT is to be effective, it needs to be instituted early in the patient's illness. The length of time that CLRT should be utilized is unknown; however, intuitively, as long as the patient is at risk, the therapy should be continued. It is also unclear whether CLRT should be started at full rotation immediately or begun at lesser degrees of rotation and advanced serially over several hours. Another unknown is the minimum time that CLRT should be administered per day. In the studies discussed, most patients were rotated for 10 to 16 h/day. The minimum degree of rotation necessary for an effect is also unknown; in the studies cited, rotations from 40 degrees to 62 degrees in each direction were used. Based on the current data, the early use of CLRT in comatose or otherwise immobile patients decreases the incidence of LRTI including pneumonia over the first 7 to 14 days of ICU care. The prevention of pneumonia and more rapid transfer from the ICU should offset the additional expense of a specialized bed. The data suggest that a multicenter study with accrual of a large number of patients to evaluate this form of therapy in a prospective, randomized study is necessary. If the hypothesis that CLRT decreases the incidence of nosocomial pneumonia in the ICU is proven, the impact on critical care in the 90s would be substantial.\r"

Prior to clinical application of aerosolized liposomes as drug carriers, their relative safety must be established. We evaluated the effects of inhaling nondrug-containing liposomes (15 and 150 mg of lipid per milliliter) for 1 h on pulmonary function and on oximetry in ten healthy nonsmoking volunteers. Spirometry was performed prior to and at intervals after inhalation, and subjects were monitored with pulse oximetry. Liposome inhalation was well tolerated, and no oxygen desaturation, decrements in pulmonary function, or side effects were noted. We conclude that inhalation of small particle aerosols of SPC liposomes produces no acute deleterious effects on pulmonary function in healthy subjects.\r"

The antiasthmatic agent, azelastine (1 mg/kg/day, intraperitoneal), was administered for 14 days after the tenth exposure to OA in some animals. Airway responsiveness increased significantly after OA exposure, beta-adrenoceptor numbers decreased by 35 percent, and adenylate cyclase activity decreased by 54 percent (p less than 0.01). Values remained significantly different than control animals for 7 days and required 14 days to normalize completely. Azelastine decreased the recovery period to seven days. Azelastine may affect airway responsiveness, at least in part, by increasing beta-adrenergic responsiveness.\r"

  ".W": "Prostate cancer is the most common malignancy in men and the second leading cause of cancer deaths. Although the mortality rate for prostate cancer has remained unchanged for 50 years, new advances have changed classic concepts in the diagnosis and management of patients with this disease. Our understanding of the anatomy and natural history of patients with prostate cancer has been enhanced. The ability to diagnose early stage prostate tumors has been improved by the introduction of prostate-specific antigen and transrectal ultrasound. Clinical staging of patients with prostate cancer has been refined, which has decreased adverse effects of inappropriate treatment. Modifications in the technique of radical prostatectomy have minimized the morbidity associated with this procedure, making it a more attractive therapeutic option. DNA ploidy analysis holds promise as a predictor of response to hormonal therapy. New agents are available to reduce adverse effects of hormonal therapy. In addition, traditional ideas about the timing of hormonal therapy and the use of total androgen blockade are being challenged. These changes may presage an improved quality of life and improve survival for patients with prostate cancer.\r"

  ".U": "91209114\r", 
  ".W": "The solitary pulmonary nodule (SPN), a single intrapulmonary spherical lesion that is fairly well circumscribed, is a common clinical problem. About half of SPNs seen in clinical practice are malignant, usually bronchogenic carcinomas. Some nodules are primary tumors of other kinds or metastatic. Virtually all benign SPNs are tuberculous or fungal granulomas. The standard management of the SPN of unknown cause is prompt surgical removal unless benignity is established by prior chest roentgenograms showing that the nodule has been stable (i.e., showing no growth) for 2 years or by the presence of a \"benign\" pattern of calcification. Less universally accepted criteria for benignity include (1) transthoracic needle aspiration biopsy (TNAB) showing a specific benign process, and (2) patient's age under 30 to 35 years. Bronchoscopy has a low diagnostic yield, particularly for benign nodules. SPNs usually grow at constant rates, expressed as the \"doubling time\" (DT). A nodule with a DT between 20 and 400 days is usually malignant. Benign nodules usually have a DT greater than 400 days. The prospective determination of DT by serial chest roentgenograms (the \"wait and watch\" strategy) is widely criticized but has clinical utility in special circumstances, particularly if the likelihood of malignancy is low and/or the anticipated surgical mortality is high. The presence and pattern of calcification are best shown by high-resolution thin-section computed tomography (CT). Diffuse, laminated, central or \"popcorn\" patterns of calcification indicate benignity. An eccentric calcium deposit or a stippled pattern does not rule out malignancy. CT densitometry will often show \"occult\" calcification in nodules that show no direct visual evidence of calcium deposition. The characteristics of the edge of the nodule correlate with the likelihood of malignancy. Nodules with irregular or spiculated margins are almost always malignant. The probability that the nodule is malignant (pCA) is related to the age of the patient, the diameter of the nodule, the amount of tobacco smoke inhalation, the overall prevalence of malignancy in SPNs, the nature of the edge of the lesion, and the presence or absence of occult calcification. It is possible by Bayesian techniques to combine these factors to calculate a more precise and comprehensive prediction of pCA in any given nodule. The 5-year survival after nodule resection depends on the size of the nodule at the time of surgery; it may be as high as 80% with nodules that are 1 cm in diameter. Lymph node involvement is uncommon with small tumors, and many authorities question the need for CT staging in such cases.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "In this study we investigated the effects of steroid hormones on glandular kallikrein gene expression in the rat pancreatic acinar cell line AR42J. Using a cloned complementary DNA probe and a polyclonal antibody we demonstrated expression of a true glandular kallikrein gene and protein in AR42J cells by Western and Northern blot analysis. Dexamethasone resulted in a time-dependent parallel decrease of kallikrein messenger RNA and protein with a maximum at 12 and 72 h (30 +/- 10 and 8 +/- 0.5% of control, respectively, P less than 0.05, n = 6). In contrast, dexamethasone stimulated gene expression of two other serine proteases, chymotrypsin and trypsin, approximately 3 to 4-fold. The decrease of kallikrein concentration was dose dependent with half-maximal effects at 5 x 10(-8) M and maximal effects at 10(-7) M dexamethasone (23 +/- 6% of control, n = 3). The glucocorticoid antagonist RU 38486 blocked the glucocorticoid-induced decrease in cellular kallikrein content in a dose-dependent manner. Complete inhibition was observed at equimolar doses of dexamethasone and the antagonist. The inhibitory effect of dexamethasone was completely reversible after hormone withdrawal for 24 h. Neither estrogen, progesterone, testosterone, or aldosterone had significant effects on kallikrein expression. These data suggest that down-regulation of pancreatic kallikrein gene expression occurs selectively in response to glucocorticoids at a pretranslational level, mediated most likely by the glucocorticoid receptor.\r"

This cessation of growth is correlated temporally with a diminution in the levels of androgen receptor, as detected by assays of ligand binding. To determine whether the change in androgen receptor content occurs in all cells in the tissue, immunohistochemical studies of the penile androgen receptor were performed in rats of different ages. In immature animals and animals castrated prepubertally, the androgen receptor is detected in virtually all cell types, including the corpus cavernosum penis, the small lateral cavernous bodies, the corpus cavernosum urethra, skin, urethra, and os penis. By contrast, in the mature rat penis minimal androgen receptor is evident within the corporal tissue and os, although immunoreactivity remains detectable in the penile skin and urethra. It is concluded that the cessation of androgen-mediated growth correlates with a decrease in androgen receptor levels in the body of the penis.\r"

  ".W": "We have previously described hypertrophy of neurons containing estrogen receptor mRNA in the infundibular nucleus of postmenopausal women. In the present investigation we identified peptide mRNAs in the hypertrophied neurons and determined whether postmenopausal neuronal hypertrophy was accompanied by changes in gene expression. In the first study in situ hybridization was performed on sections from hypothalami of postmenopausal women (n = 3) using synthetic 35S-labeled cDNA probes complementary to mRNAs encoding estrogen receptor, substance-P (SP), neurokinin-B (NKB), POMC, cholecystokinin, dynorphin, CRF, enkephalin, galanin, neuropeptide-Y, GH-releasing hormone, and tyrosine hydroxylase. Neuronal cross-sectional areas and cell densities were measured with the aid of a computer microscope system. Neurons labeled with the NKB and SP probes were comparable in size, morphology, and distribution to the hypertrophied neurons containing estrogen receptor mRNA. In contrast, neurons labeled with other cDNA probes were sparsely distributed (CRF and dynorphin), smaller in size (neuropeptide-Y, galanin, GH-releasing hormone, enkephalin, cholecystokinin, and POMC), or located anterior to the hypertrophied population (tyrosine hydroxylase). In the second study sections from hypothalami of premenopausal (n = 3) and postmenopausal (n = 3) women were incubated with cDNA probes complementary to SP or NKB mRNAs. The mean cross-sectional areas of postmenopausal infundibular neurons containing NKB and SP mRNAs increased to 194% and 176% of premenopausal values, respectively. The autoradiographic grain densities of infundibular neurons labeled with either probe were also significantly increased in the postmenopausal group. Finally, the numbers of labeled neurons/tissue increased 6-fold (SP) and 15-fold (NKB) in the postmenopausal infundibular nucleus. These data demonstrate that human menopause is associated with marked increases in hypothalamic NKB and SP gene expression. We propose that neurons containing estrogen receptor, SP, and NKB mRNAs participate in the hypothalamic circuitry regulating estrogen negative feedback in the human.\r"

In the present study, the effect of centrally administered AII on CRF messenger RNA (mRNA) levels in the rat hypothalamus was examined. Administration of 0.1 nmol and 1 nmol AII into the lateral ventricle increased the levels of plasma ACTH 20 min and 45 min after administration and those of proopiomelanocortin mRNA in the anterior pituitary (AP) and CRF mRNA in the hypothalamus 2 h after administration. On the other hand, ACTH levels in AP and CRF levels in the median eminence temporarily decreased 45 min after the administration of 1 nmol AII, but it returned to the control level at 90 min. Administration of 10 nmol saralacin, an AII antagonist, blocked 1 nmol AII-induced increase in the levels of plasma ACTH, proopiomelanocortin mRNA in AP, and CRF mRNA in the hypothalamus. These results indicate that central administration of AII increases the CRF mRNA level in the hypothalamus in a receptor-specific manner and also increases CRF release. Therefore, AII seems to have an important role in the regulation of the release and synthesis of CRF in the hypothalamus.\r"

  ".U": "91209263\r", 
  ".W": "Hydrogen peroxide produces marked antigonadotropic and lytic actions in luteal cells, but the effects of superoxide, the archetypal oxygen radical, are unknown. Xanthine oxidase generates superoxide, and the activity of this enzyme, and purine substrate, are increased under ischemia, such as that seen at luteal regression. We therefore examined the actions of xanthine oxidase on luteal cells to assess the effects of this enzyme and the superoxide anion on luteal function. Xanthine oxidase, in the presence of hypoxanthine (50 microM), produced marked inhibition of LH-sensitive cAMP and progesterone production with complete inhibition at 25 mU/ml and half-maximal inhibition at about 5 mU/ml. These antigonadotropic actions of xanthine oxidase were rapid with maximal effects within 5 min, followed several minutes later by substantial depletion of ATP. Heat, superoxide dismutase, and catalase or catalase alone abolished the actions of xanthine oxidase. While depletion of ATP by xanthine oxidase was prevented by 3-amino-benzamide, an inhibitor of DNA repair, inhibition of cAMP and progesterone production was still evident. Xanthine oxidase also inhibited progesterone synthesis stimulated by 8-bromo-cAMP. Isobutylmethylxanthine, a cAMP phosphodiesterase inhibitor, did not reverse the inhibition of cAMP accumulation by xanthine oxidase, and the enzyme had no effect on LH receptor binding activity. Since catalase reversed the effects of xanthine oxidase, we conclude that superoxide was rapidly dismuted to hydrogen peroxide and mediated the antigonadotropic and antisteroidogenic actions of xanthine oxidase in luteal cells. The sensitivity of luteal cells to xanthine oxidase raises the possibility that this enzyme may serve as a significant source of hydrogen peroxide in the corpus luteum.\r"

  ".U": "91209264\r", 
  ".W": "We have confirmed the serum calcium-raising effect of adrenalectomy in young male rats 5-6 h after parathyroidectomy that was first observed by others many years ago. (The phenomenon has also been reported in cats, dogs, and mice.) In addition, we have shown that adrenalectomy raises the serum ionized calcium as well as total calcium and that the effect occurs in young female as well as in young male rats. Furthermore, we have found that the serum calcium-raising effect of adrenalectomy occurs if the adrenalectomy is performed several days before parathyroidectomy or 6 h after parathyroidectomy, as well as at the same time as the parathyroidectomy. When the rats were adrenalectomized 7-9 days before parathyroidectomy and given small daily life-maintaining doses of corticosterone or cortisone acetate, this glucocorticoid treatment did not reverse the adrenalectomy effect. This led us to think at first that the effect of adrenalectomy must be due to the loss of an unknown adrenal factor rather than to loss of glucocorticoid. Additional experiments, however, in which corticosterone or hydrocortisone was administered by continuous release pellets, demonstrated conclusively that a small continuous supply of corticosterone (within the physiological range as determined by immunoassay of plasma) was sufficient to reverse the adrenalectomy effect. The results with hydrocortisone were similar at even lower doses than of corticosterone. Somewhat higher doses of corticosterone or hydrocortisone reduced the serum calcium even below the parathyroidectomy level. In a preliminary investigation of the specificity of the glucocorticoid effect we found that aldosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone, or estradiol had no effect on serum calcium under similar conditions. We conclude that the fall in serum calcium after parathyroidectomy in rats is due in part to the hypocalcemic effect of endogenous corticosterone. Thus, the loss of corticosterone after adrenalectomy explains the serum calcium-raising effect of adrenalectomy in parathyroidectomized rats. These results also suggest that glucocorticoids at physiological levels have a significant effect on calcium metabolism in general.\r"

In this study the mechanism of inhibition of human B-cell growth by anti-hPRL was explored with an Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen (EBNA)-negative Burkitt lymphoma cell line (sfRamos) that proliferates continuously in serum-free medium with human transferrin as the only protein supplement. The data show that antiserum immunoglobulin fraction G (IgG) to pituitary hPRL, but not nonimmune serum IgG, completely inhibited the growth of sfRamos cells. In addition, anti-hPRL IgG identified a single band (29 kDa) in sfRamos spent medium, but not in fresh serum-free medium or in human transferrin, as demonstrated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-reducing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western immunoblot analysis. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western analysis of a mixture containing sfRamos spent medium and excess pituitary hPRL established that the sfRamos 29-kDa PRL-like protein (PLP29) and pituitary hPRL (23 kDa) were electrophoretically distinct. Finally, sfRamos spent medium, but not fresh serum-free medium, was mitogenic for sfRamos and Nb2, a PRL-sensitive node rat lymphoma cell line. These findings demonstrate that PLP29 is biologically and immunologically like pituitary hPRL, but is electrophoretically different from this hormone. We suggest that PLP29 is secreted as an autocrine growth factor by sfRamos Burkitt lymphoma cells during continuous serum-free growth.\r"

The primary structure of the peptide was established as: Tyr-Pro-Pro-Lys-Pro-Glu-Asn-Pro-Gly-Glu10-Asp-Ala-Pro- Pro-Glu-Glu-Leu-Ala-Lys-Tyr20-Tyr-Ser-Ala-Leu-Arg-His- Tyr-Ile-Asn-Leu30-Ile-Thr-Arg-Gln-Arg-Tyr.NH2. This sequence contains 86% amino acid sequence homology with human neuropeptide Y, and the COOH-terminal region (residues 20-36) has been fully conserved. Bolus injection of a synthetic replicate of the peptide (0.5-4 nmol) into the celiac artery of conscious dogfish resulted in a significant (P less than 0.01) and dose-dependent increase in arterial blood pressure. A maximum rise in mean pressure (67 +/- 11% over mean basal values; n = 6) was elicited by an injection of 2 nmol peptide. Bolus injections of human neuropeptide Y (0.5-4 nmol) also elicited dose-dependent rises in blood pressure, and the effects produced by the dogfish and human peptides were not significantly different at any dose. The data are consistent with a physiological role for neuropeptide Y-related peptide in cardiovascular regulation in elasmobranch fish.\r"

  ".W": "The genomic structure of the LH receptor is important to our understanding of its expression mechanisms, functional domains, relationships with other hormone receptors, and evolution. We have isolated four overlapping cosmid clones and six subgenomic clones of the rat LH receptor gene. They span a total of 95.6 kilobases (kb) and extend from 23 kb upstream of the translation start site to 13 kb down-stream of the stop codon. In addition, part of the human LH receptor gene has been isolated. The coding region of the rat hormone receptor gene spans over 60 kb and consists of 11 exons and 10 introns. Southern blots hybridized with exon 1 and exon 11 probes as well as gene dose analyses demonstrate that a single copy gene encodes the rat LH receptor. Sequence comparison suggests that the porcine and human LH receptor genes have similar, if not identical, exon-intron structures. There is no consensus cAMP-responsive element within 600 basepairs up-stream of the translation start site in spite of the cAMP responsiveness of the LH receptor gene. There are, however, unconventional cAMP-responsive elements in the region: one which is identical, several which are homologous to the activating protein-2-binding elements, CCCCAGGC, and several sequences which are similar to the G-rich cAMP-responsive element found in P450c21, a steroid 21-hydroxylase. The first 10 exons encode the N-terminal half of the molecule, while exon 11 encodes the C-terminal half of the molecule. This last exon is the same in the rat and human genes. The DNA and amino acid sequences of the first 10 exons show significant similarities and reveal repetitive sequence motifs. They have similar sizes which occur in the range of 69 and 183 bases; 8 of them are from 69-81 bases. Despite these remarkable similarities, structural predictions of exons 1-10 show a diversity of structures. The N-terminal half of the LH receptor appears to have a folded structure, with frequent turns and an extensive surface area. Part of the surface is predicted to be covered by amphiphilic helices and beta structures, types of secondary structure frequently found at the interfaces between subunits or between 2 interacting molecules. The introns dividing these exons also share many similarities.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Near term, intrauterine occupancy is correlated with high levels of PTHrP messenger RNA in the gravid horn of the unilaterally pregnant uterus. In nongravid tissue from these same animals the presence of smaller yet significant elevations of PTHrP mRNA suggests that the PTHrP gene also may be regulated by humoral factor(s). To test this hypothesis, we assessed the action of 17 beta-estradiol (E2) on the expression of the PTHrP gene in the uterus of the ovariectomized rat. While low levels of PTHrP mRNA are detected in uteri from ovariectomized rats, a single dose of E2 (4, 40, or 400 micrograms/kg body weight) stimulated a 6- to 8-fold increase in the levels of PTHrP mRNA in the uterus at approximately 2 h after E2 treatment. This increase was transient with levels gradually declining to pretreatment (basal) levels within 24 h. Other steroid hormones tested, including dihydrotestosterone, dexamethasone, and progesterone, failed to stimulate this response. The increase of PTHrP mRNA accumulation required a dose greater than 0.4 micrograms/kg. The magnitude and duration of PTHrP mRNA accumulation were very similar when doses of 40 or 400 micrograms/kg were used. In addition, the stimulation of the PTHrP gene by E2 is neither age dependent nor specific to the rat and is, in part, under transcriptional control. Together, these data indicate that in vivo E2 regulates the levels of PTHrP mRNA in the rat uterus and support a role for E2 in the increased expression of PTHrP mRNA in early gestational tissue, as well as in the nongravid horn of the unilaterally pregnant uterus.\r"

  ".W": "Several lines of indirect evidence suggest that a monocyte family precursor gives rise to the osteoclast, although this hypothesis is controversial. Starting with a uniform population of nonspecific esterase positive, tartrate-sensitive, acid phosphatase-producing, mannose receptor-bearing mononuclear cells, prepared from dispersed marrow of calcium-deprived laying hens by cell density separation and selective cellular adherence, we generated multinucleated cells in vitro. When cultured with devitalized bone, these cells show, by electron microscopy, the characteristic osteoclast morphology in that they are mitochondria-rich, multinucleated, and, most importantly, develop characteristic ruffled membranes at the matrix attachment site. Moreover, as documented by scanning electron microscopy, these cells pit bone slices in a manner identical to freshly isolated osteoclasts. In addition, isoenzymes of acid phosphatase from generated osteoclasts, separated by 7.5% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis at pH 4, are identical to those of mature osteoclasts in migration pattern and tartrate resistance, although the precursor cells from which the osteoclasts are generated produce an entirely different isoenzyme, which is tartrate-sensitive and migrates less rapidly at pH 4. The fused cells also exhibit a cAMP response to prostaglandin E2. Therefore, osteoclast-like cells can be derived by in vitro culture of a marrow-derived monocyte cell population.\r"

  ".W": "The insulin-like growth factors (IGF-I and IGF-II) circulate in plasma in association with IGF-binding proteins (IGFBPs). As a first step to understanding the regulation of expression of these proteins in pigs, we characterized the ontogeny of circulating IGFs and IGFBPs during fetal and early postnatal development. Serum IGFs were separated from IGFBPs, before IGF RIA, by acidification and chromatography on C18 Sep-Pak cartridges. The IGF-I levels increased during the latter half of fetal life from 11 +/- 1 ng/ml on day 60 to 37 +/- 3 ng/ml on day 112 (2-3 days before term) and further increased postnatally to 227 +/- 21 to 265 +/- 26 ng/ml) and also increased higher than IGF-I levels, with no obvious developmental pattern, during fetal life (170 +/- 21 to 265 +/- 26 ng/ml) and also increased postnatally by 2-fold (463 +/- 29 ng/ml on day 42). These results support the view that IGF-II is a fetal and postnatal growth factor, whereas IGF-I is primarily a postnatal growth mediator in pigs. Serum IGF-binding proteins were identified by Western ligand blotting. Five IGFBPs with apparent mol wt of 43K, 39K, 34K, 31K, and 26K were detected in fetal and postnatal sera. The two largest proteins were shown to be glycoproteins and immunologically related to porcine (p) IGFBP-3, suggesting that they are glycosylation variants of pIGFBP-3. The abundance of these two IGFBPs increased coincidently with increasing serum IGF-I levels. The 34K IGFBP was immunologically related to rIGFBP-2 and was 2- to 3-fold more abundant in fetal serum than in postnatal serum. The 31K IGFBP was resolved into a triplet and also was a component of pIGFBP-3 immunoprecipitates. Similarly, the 26K IGFBP was present in pIGFBP-3 immunoprecipitates. The 31K and 26K IGFBPs represented a minor portion of serum IGF-binding activity in fetal and postnatal pigs and exhibited no obvious developmental patterns. It is hypothesized that the postnatal increases in serum IGF-I and 43K and 39K IGFBPs as well as the decrease in the 34K IGFBP are driven by GH action.\r"

The proteinase complex is inhibited by soybean trypsin inhibitor, limabean trypsin inhibitor, and aprotinin, but not by inhibitors of thiol proteinases or metal chelators.

RNA was isolated and assessed using hGH-N complementary DNA since hGH and hCS genes share more than 90% sequences similarity. The relative expression is BeWo greater than JAR greater than JEG-3. In BeWo cells expression of placental hCS-A, hCS-B, and hGH-V genes, but not pituitary hGH-N, is observed using polyadenylated RNA and oligonucleotide probes specific for the different family members. The absence of hGH-N expression in BeWo cells is not due to deletion or gross rearrangement of the gene. No difference was seen between the hGH/hCS genes in genomic DNA from these cells and the DNA from placenta and pituitary when analyzed by restriction digestion and blotting. Treatment of BeWo cells with 10 nM T3 results in a 6-fold increase in messenger RNA from placental members of the hGH gene family. Levels of hCS-A, hCS-B, and hGH-V transcripts are all elevated. Cellular and secreted proteins from BeWo cells were analyzed by Western blotting, and a band of about 22 kilodaltons was detected using a polyclonal antibody which cross-reacts with hGH-V and hCS. The level of 22 kilodalton band in samples of cellular as well as released protein was increased by T3 treatment. BeWo cells provide a model system for studying hGH-V and hCS regulation as well as tissue-specific expression.\r"

  ".W": "Using a specific antiserum raised against synthetic neuropeptide-Y (NPY), the distribution of NPY-like immunoreactivity in the brain and pituitary of the trout Oncorhynchus mykiss has been examined with the indirect immunofluorescence and peroxidase-antiperoxidase methods. The highest density of NPY-immunoreactive elements was found in the basal telencephalon and hypothalamus. In particular, NPY-immunoreactive neurons were located in the nucleus entopeduncularis and the preoptic nucleus. NPY-immunoreactive fibers were observed throughout the trout brain. The preoptic nucleus, the suprachiasmatic nucleus, and the nucleus entopeduncularis were densely innervated. In addition, NPY-positive fibers were detected in the nucleus lateralis tuberis and in the distal and intermediate lobes of the pituitary. The NPY-like peptide of the trout brain was characterized by combining HPLC analysis and radioimmunological detection. Serial dilutions of trout hypothalamus and pituitary extracts produced displacement curves that were parallel to the standard curve. HPLC analysis resolved a major peak which was slightly less hydrophobic than porcine NPY. The possible effect of NPY, either alone or in combination with a GnRH antagonist, on gonadotropin (GtH) release from trout pituitaries was investigated using a perifusion system technique. Graded concentrations of synthetic NPY induced a dose-dependent stimulation of GtH release. The stimulatory activities of NPY and various short chain analogs on GtH release were compared: the order of potency was NPY greater than NPY-(2-36) greater than NPY-(16-36) greater than NPY-(25-36). This result suggests that the biological determinant of NPY is located in the C-terminal part of the molecule. Administration of a short pulse of NPY or GnRH (10(-7) M each) induced a marked stimulation of GtH release. Prolonged infusion of the GnRH antagonist D-Phe2-6,Pro3-GnRH induced a significant reduction of GnRH-evoked GtH secretion. In addition, the GnRH antagonist blocked NPY-induced GtH release. The widespread distribution of NPY in the trout brain suggests the involvement of this neuropeptide in a variety of physiological functions. The present data support the view that NPY, released by nerve terminals in the distal lobe of the pituitary, may act presynaptically on GnRH fibers to modulate GtH release.\r"

  ".W": "The secretory pattern of GH secretion is markedly sexually dimorphic in the adult rat. The patterning of GH secretion is determined by the coordinated activity of somatostatin (SS)- and GH-releasing hormone (GHRH)-containing neurosecretory cells located in the hypothalamus. In this study we examined whether there is sexual dimorphism in the expression of the SS and GHRH genes and, if so, at what developmental stage this becomes evident. To address these questions, we measured SS messenger RNA (mRNA) levels in neurons of the periventricular nucleus and GHRH mRNA levels in the arcuate nucleus and ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus in male and female rats at 10, 25, 35, and 75 days of age. Using in situ hybridization and a computerized image analysis system, we measured SS mRNA and GHRH mRNA signal levels in individual neurons and compared these levels among the different age groups. We found that male animals had significantly higher levels of SS mRNA than females at every age. Similarly, males had higher GHRH mRNA levels than females; however, this difference was statistically significant only at 10 and 75 days of age. Developmental changes in GHRH mRNA levels were similar for both sexes, with GHRH message levels increasing gradually over the course of maturation. SS mRNA signal levels also changed over the course of development in both male and female animals. In the male rat, SS mRNA levels increased significantly between 10 and 25 days of age and declined significantly between 35 and 75 days of age. In the female rat, SS mRNA levels increased gradually between 10 and 35 days of age, then, as in the male, declined significantly between days 35 and 75. We conclude that sex differences and age-dependent changes in the expression of the SS and GHRH genes may subserve the sexual dimorphism and developmental alterations in the pattern of GH secretion in the rat.\r"

  ".W": "These studies were undertaken to assess the subcellular distribution and some biochemical properties of the hepatic cAMP phosphodiesterase(s) whose activity is modulated by the thyroid status in the rat. Thyroidectomy led to a 2-fold increase in low Michaelis-Menten constant (Km) cAMP phosphodiesterase activity in Golgi-endosomal fractions, but little affected this activity in crude particulate fractions. On analytical sucrose density gradients, an increase in cAMP phosphodiesterase activity in particulate elements which equilibrated at densities 1.17-1.22 was also observed. Acute insulin treatment did not further increase cAMP phosphodiesterase activity in Golgi-endosomal fractions of thyroidectomized rats. Up to 75% of the cAMP phosphodiesterase activity associated with Golgi-endosomal fraction of euthyroid and hypothyroid rats was inhibited by cGMP (IC50, 10 microM and 1 microM, respectively). Activity was also potently inhibited by griseolic acid, cilostamide, and cilostazole (IC50, less than 1 microM) but was much less sensitive to R0-20-1724 (IC50, 1 mM). Treatment of Golgi-endosomal fractions by a hypotonic extract of rat liver lysosomes led to the solubilization of 50% of low Km cAMP phosphodiesterase activity. On sucrose density gradients, the solubilized activity migrated as a slightly asymmetrical peak with a sedimentation coefficient of 6 S in euthyroid rats and 6.9 S in hypothyroid rats. On nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the activity migrated as two majors peaks with Rf values of 0.23 and 0.50; only the activity associated with the fast-moving peak was increased by thyroidectomy. On diethylaminoethyl-Sephacel chromatography, four peaks of cAMP phosphodiesterase activity, two of which were cGMP-inhibitable, were resolved. Thyroidectomy increased the activity associated with one of the cGMP-inhibitable peaks (eluted at 0.7-0.9 M sodium acetate) and led to the appearance of a new peak of activity (eluted at 0.4 M), which was not sensitive to cGMP. These results show that the low Km phosphodiesterase activity associated with liver Golgi-endosomal fractions, previously shown to be increased in hyperinsulinemic rats, is also increased in hypothyroid animals. They also suggest that, based on pharmacological and physical criteria, the enzyme species affected by the thyroid status belongs to the cGMP-and cilostamide-inhibited subclass of low Km cAMP phosphodiesterases.\r"

  ".W": "We used a novel adaptation of the polymerase chain reaction to examine relative levels of mRNA encoding two members of the facilitative glucose transporter gene family, the GLUT1 or erythrocyte/HepG2/brain isoform and the GLUT4 or insulin-regulatable isoform. The method was fast (vs. hybridization methods), required no specific probe, and used total RNA samples of less than 1 microgram. Taking advantage of regions of structural similarity and differences between the two isoforms, we designed a single set of oligonucleotide primers capable of amplifying both GLUT1 and GLUT4 cDNAs such that their respective products could be resolved on the basis of a 12 base pair size differential. Hence, reverse transcription and complementary DNA amplification could be carried out for both transcripts using identical primers in the same reaction tube. Using this methodology, we examined the relative amounts of GLUT4 and GLUT1 mRNAs in several rat tissues. As expected based on prior reports using Northern analysis, rat brain contained only GLUT1 mRNA and skeletal muscle contained a large predominance of GLUT4 mRNA. Both isoform mRNAs were found in adipose tissue whereas adipose cells, heart and diaphragm contained predominantly GLUT4 mRNA. Induction of diabetes with streptozocin decreased the GLUT4 to GLUT1 ratio in adipose tissue 4-fold and 24 h of insulin treatment of the diabetic rats increased this ratio 9- to 10-fold. Insulin treatment of normal rats increased this ratio by 70%. Hindlimb skeletal muscle GLUT4 mRNA was quantified in diabetic and insulin-treated diabetic rats as a function of brain GLUT1 mRNA added as an internal standard. Using this methodology, no significant difference in muscle GLUT4 mRNA was noted as a result of 24 h of insulin therapy. In summary, quantitative PCR may be used to compare mRNA levels encoding specific members of a gene family either within given cells or tissues or as affected by physiological perturbations. Subject to certain limitations discussed within, this methodology may be useful in future measurements of glucose transporter mRNA, especially when only small tissue or cell samples are available.\r"

  ".U": "91209281\r", 
  ".W": "We have recently demonstrated that treatment of pregnant baboons with androstenedione (delta 4 A) at midgestation to increase estrogen production induced a pattern of placental cortisol (F) metabolism which was similar to that at term and resulted in de novo F production by the fetus, presumably by activation of the fetal hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical axis. The present study was designed to examine the subcellular events in the fetal adrenal that were apparently stimulated by estrogen-induced alterations in transplacental corticosteroid metabolism. Therefore, we determined the effects of estrogen treatment at midgestation and removal of estrogen action near term on the specific activity of the rate-limiting enzymes delta 5-3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3 beta HSD) and 17-hydroxylase-17,20-lyase (17 alpha-OHase). Fetal adrenals were obtained on day 100 (n = 11) or day 165 (n = 11) of gestation (term = day 184) from untreated animals, on day 100 from animals receiving delta 4 A daily between days 70-100 (n = 9) to increase placental estrogen production, and on day 165 from baboons treated daily between days 130-164 with antiestrogen ethamoxytriphetol (MER-25; n = 7). The activity of 17 alpha-OHase was determined by incubating adrenal microsomes (105,000 x g) with [3H] progesterone, NAD+, and NADH in phosphate buffer. The radiolabeled products 17-hydroxyprogesterone, delta 4 A, and testosterone were purified, and enzyme activity expressed as picograms of product per min/mg tissue. The activity of 3 beta HSD was determined by incubating adrenal microsomes with [3H]pregnenolone and NAD+ in phosphate buffer. The radiolabeled progesterone product was purified, and enzyme activity was expressed as nanograms per min/mg tissue. Treatment with delta 4 A increased estrogen concentration at midgestation 3-fold to levels comparable to those measured near term. Although fetal adrenal weight was greater at term than at midgestation (p less than 0.05), weight was not increased by delta 4 A treatment. The specific activity (mean +/- SE) of fetal adrenal 17 alpha-OHase at midgestation (181 +/- 29) was increased (P less than 0.05) 3-fold by treatment with delta 4 A to levels (591 +/- 105) comparable to those in adrenal microsomes prepared from untreated animals near term (816 +/- 130). Enzyme activity in adrenals of MER-25-treated baboons was 40%, but not significantly lower than that in term controls.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

In the course of our investigation on the interaction of ovarian components with EGF, we observed that partially purified glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) isolated from mouse ovaries enhanced the angiogenic activity of EGF when applied simultaneously to the lateral wall of the sheath of musculus rectus abdominis. Mouse EGF from submandibular glands embedded in Elvax 40 implanting on the musculus rectus abdominis induced neovascularization in a dose-dependent manner. When 0.5 micrograms ovarian GAGs was embedded in the implant with a low amount of EGF that induced only slight neovascularization (0.5 or 1 microgram/implant), the angiogenic activity of the growth factor was markedly enhanced. The active GAG component was isolated by chromatography on Dowex 1-x2. The fraction eluted with 0.5 M NaCl possessed the greatest activity to potentiate the angiogenic activity of EGF. When the reaction mixture of GAGs and EGF was treated with 1% cetylpyridinium chloride, the angiogenic activity was identified with the supernatant. On the other hand, after incubating EGF with 0.5 M NaCl fraction, the angiogenic activity of EGF was identified with the precipitate (GAG fraction) of the cetylpyridinium chloride-treated reaction mixtures. These findings show that ovarian GAGs potentiate the angiogenic activity of EGF by interacting or complexing with EGF.\r"

Endocrine manipulation experiments were designed to determine whether 5 alpha-reductase is regulated at the steady state mRNA level. Steady state mRNA concentrations were assessed using the full-length cDNA for female rat liver 5 alpha-reductase. Longitudinal distribution showed that the highest mRNA concentrations were present in the initial segment of the caput epididymidis and were 3- to 7-fold higher than in the other tissue segments. The androgen dependence of the mRNA levels for 5 alpha-reductase was assessed by bilateral orchidectomy and simultaneous testosterone replacement therapy. One week after surgery, mRNA concentrations in orchidectomized rats were decreased to 15% of control levels in the initial segment of the caput epididymidis and to 40-50% of control levels in the remaining epididymal segments. Administration of testosterone at a dose that mimics normal serum concentrations (2.5-cm Silastic implant) restored 5 alpha-reductase mRNA concentrations to control levels in the corpus and cauda epididymidis, but these were not significantly different from orchidectomized levels (P greater than or equal to 0.05) in the initial segment and caput epididymidis. Administration of testosterone at a dose designed to approximate 5- to 8-fold normal serum concentrations (18.6-cm implant) maintained 5 alpha-reductase mRNA concentrations at only 50% of control levels in the initial segment, while complete maintenance was observed in the rest of the tissue. The effects of unilateral orchidectomy revealed that 5 alpha-reductase mRNA concentrations decrease selectively in the initial segment of the orchidectomized side. This is the first report that epididymal 5 alpha-reductase is regulated at the mRNA level and that the regulation is different with respect to the segment being studied.\r"

Then, after washing cells to remove any insulin and allow for full deactivation of transport, we assessed the dose response of insulin's acute ability to stimulate 2-deoxyglucose transport, bind to cell surface receptors, and activate insulin receptor tyrosine kinase activity. After 5 h, glucose and insulin alone had no chronic regulatory effects; however, in combination, these agents were able to decrease insulin sensitivity. In cells preincubated with 50 ng/ml insulin, the insulin ED50 for acute stimulation of glucose transport was increased by 65% and 116% as medium glucose was raised to 5 and 20 mM, respectively, relative to that at 0 mM glucose. After 24 h, chronic exposure to either glucose (20 mM) or insulin (50 ng/ml) alone increased the ED50 value by 52%, and, together they acted synergistically to increase the ED50 by 183%. While glucose and insulin independently and synergistically impaired insulin sensitivity, both agents were necessary for coregulation of maximal insulin responsiveness (confirming our previous observation). Insulin receptor down-regulation (18%) was observed after 24 h (but not 5 h) in insulin-treated cells; however, the major portion of the decrease in insulin sensitivity was due to uncoupling of occupied insulin receptors from stimulation of the glucose transport system. To further determine the mechanism for postbinding desensitization, we tested for concordant regulation of insulin receptor kinase activity. Insulin's ability to stimulate the receptor tyrosine kinase was assessed by multiple methods, including 1) receptor autophosphorylation and phosphorylation of Glu4-Tyr1 by solubilized insulin receptors activated in vitro, 2) histone-2B phosphorylation by receptors that were stimulated in intact cells and then solubilized under conditions that preserve the in cellulo phosphorylation state, and 3) receptor autophosphorylation and phosphorylation of pp180 in intact cells. Long term treatment (24 h) with glucose (10 mM) and insulin (50 ng/ml) markedly decreased insulin sensitivity (and receptor coupling), but did not affect insulin receptor kinase activity in any of these studies.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Many aspects of reproductive function are corrected in hypogonadal mice with preoptic area grafts (HPG/POA). Gonadotropin release and gonadal development are dependent on the presence of GnRH cells within the grafts and GnRH innervation of the median eminence. This study examined the effect of a known modulator of GnRH secretion, N-methyl-D,L-aspartic acid (NMA), in adult normal and HPG/POA male and female mice. All HPG/POA males had significant testicular development after graft surgery, and most HPG/POA females were in constant vaginal estrus and showed ovarian and uterine development; a few also demonstrated ovulatory cyclicity after pregnancies initiated by reflex ovulation. Groups of normal and HPG/POA males that were intact (INT) or castrated (CX) 7 days before testing were challenged with saline, NMA (20 mg/kg), and GnRH (100 ng/0.1 ml). Sequential blood samples from awake animals were obtained via intracardiac catheters for evaluation of plasma LH. There were significant increases in plasma LH after NMA challenge in normal INT [n = 15; 0 min, 0.26 +/- 0.02 (mean +/- SE); 10 min, 1.20 +/- 0.10 ng/ml; P less than 0.05] and normal CX (n = 13; 0 min, 0.36 +/- 0.06, 10 min, 3.25 +/- 0.27). Plasma LH secretion in response to NMA was significantly correlated (r = 0.786; P less than 0.001) with plasma LH release after the GnRH challenge in normal males. In contrast, only 3 of 17 HPG/POA (1 INT and 2 CX) showed increased circulating LH after NMA challenge, despite heightened pituitary sensitivity to GnRH. Normal and HPG/POA female mice were ovariectomized (OX) or OX and estrogen primed (OXE2) 7 days before testing. Intact cycling normal and cycling HPG/POA mice were tested in estrus (EST). There was a greater response to NMA in normal OX (n = 8; 0 min, 0.39 +/- 0.02; 10 min, 1.44 +/- 0.28) than in OXE2 (n = 13; 0 min, 0.29 +/- 0.01; 10 min, 0.52 +/- 0.07) despite similar gonadotroph sensitivity to GnRH. There was also a significant increase in plasma LH in response to NMA in HPG/POA-OX (n = 7; 0 min, 0.50 +/- 0.10; 10 min, 1.62 +/- 0.22) and HPG/POA-OXE2 (n = 12; 0 min, 0.39 +/- 0.04; 10 min, 1.31 +/- 0.26). Plasma LH levels after NMA treatment were significantly correlated with responses to GnRH in female HPG/POA (r = 0.58; P less than 0.03), but not in normal females. Neither normal-EST nor HPG/POA-EST had increased LH release after NMA challenge, perhaps due to the low gonadotroph sensitivity in this state.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Using a modified polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay, preprotachykinin-A (substance-P) mRNA could be detected in extracts of human, mouse, and bovine testes, but not in rat or boar testes or in bovine thyroid or corpus luteum used as negative controls. This assay is able to discriminate among the alpha, beta, and gamma transcripts of the gene and shows that only the beta and gamma transcripts are present in the testes. Sequencing analysis of the PCR products from bovine hypothalamus, mouse brain, and human testis confirmed the structure of these transcripts, which encode both substance-P and neurokinin-A (substance-K) neuropeptide hormones. Using a variant of this assay it was possible to identify tachykinin transcripts in as few as 500 freshly prepared purified mouse Leydig cells. In parallel studies PCR analysis was also able to confirm the presence of mRNA for both substance-P and neurokinin-A receptors in human testes. Thus, the tachykinins substance-P and neurokinin-A must now be added to the list of potentially paracrine substances regulating intratesticular function.\r"

  ".W": "The present study determined whether exposure to gonadal steroids in utero dictates the postnatal control of gonadotropin secretion in the lamb. There is a marked sex difference in the timing of neuroendocrine sexual maturation in sheep; while male lambs undergo a reduction in sensitivity to inhibitory gonadal steroid feedback by 10 weeks of age, females remain hypersensitive until 30 weeks. The hypothesis was tested that prenatal androgens advance the time of the decrease in feedback sensitivity, and hence the pubertal increase in pulsatile gonadotropin secretion. Pregnant ewes were injected each week with 100 mg testosterone cypionate im from 30-90 days of gestation (term is approximately 150 days). Five female lambs were born with masculinized external genitalia (penis and scrotum). These females, together with eight androgenized males, eight control males, and eight control females, were gonadectomized at 2 weeks of age and implanted with a Silastic capsule of estradiol to produce a constant steroid feedback signal. Blood samples were collected twice weekly to monitor trends in LH secretion. For determination of LH pulse frequency, samples were collected frequently (every 12 min for 4 h) at various intervals between 5 and 32 weeks of age. In males, a sustained increase in LH from biweekly blood samples, indicative of reduced sensitivity to inhibitory steroid feedback, began at 10.1 +/- 1.4 weeks (mean +/- SE) of age in control males and at 5.4 +/- 0.1 weeks in androgenized males. By contrast, control females remained hypersensitive much longer as evidenced by the delay in the LH rise until 27.2 +/- 0.8 weeks. The response of the five androgenized females was intermediate; LH increased at 4, 7, 16, 20, and 21 weeks of age with an early increase of LH being associated with more pronounced masculinization of the genitalia. Patterns of pulsatile LH secretion reflected differences in serum LH measured from biweekly blood samples. For example, at 20 weeks of age, before the pubertal LH rise in female lambs, no pulses were evident in control females, whereas LH pulse frequency averaged 1.6 +/- 0.7 pulses/4 h in androgenized females. At this age, postpubertal males had 2.8 +/- 0.5 LH pulses/4 h. These results lead to the conclusion that in the sheep, prenatal androgens can masculinize patterns of gonadotropin secretion, and that the timing of reproductive neuroendocrine maturation after birth is programmed by androgens in utero.\r"

Binding of this labeled ACTH analog to adrenocortical ACTH receptors was demonstrated to be time and temperature dependent, tissue and hormone specific, saturable, reversible, have a binding optimum at pH 7.5, and be dependent on the presence of Ca++. Scatchard analyses of saturation data using the computer program LIGAND indicated a single class of high affinity binding sites [association constant (Ka) = 2.00 +/- 0.25 10(9) M-1)]. Hill plots of saturation data had slopes (b = 0.83 +/- 0.09) that did not differ from 1, and hence also indicated a single class of binding sites. The rate constant of association (k1 = 3.72 +/- 1.19 X 10(8) min-1M-1) was compatible with the known rapidly occurring action of ACTH in pigs in vivo. Kinetic experiments also indicated the ACTH receptors to be of high affinity (4.18 +/- 0.54 X 10(10) M-1; n = 4). Receptor-associated degradation occurring to analog during incubations involved cleavage of the peptide into fragments rather than deiodination and could be partially prevented by use of 0.01% bacitracin. Subsequently, a study was conducted to determine changes in the ability of piglets to respond, in terms of plasma cortisol, to the physiological and psychological stressor of overnight maternal deprivation (MD) at various neonatal ages (days 3-31 of age); to measure age-related and stressor-associated changes in adrenal ACTH receptors; and to associate any changes in adrenal response with changes in ACTH receptors. Plasma cortisol obtained by venipuncture did not vary with age in either control or MD piglets but was elevated by MD (16.98 +/- 2.5 vs. 68.3 +/- 8.2 ng/ml). There was no effect of MD and associated hormonal perturbations on adrenal ACTH receptors. However, there were significant age-related differences in these receptors, with a 1.6-fold increase in concentrations (55.6 +/- 12.0 fmol/mg protein), and a 63% decrease (P less than 0.05) in affinity (4.19 +/- 0.86 x 10(8) M-1) evident at 17 days of age compared with 10 and 24 days of age. The significance of these age-related changes in ACTH receptors for adrenal function remains to be determined; however, it is evident that in neonatal pigs, there is no stress nonresponsive period.\r"

  ".W": "Insulin-like growth factors (IGF-I and IGF-II) are endocrine and autocrine factors affecting bone growth and metabolism. Binding proteins for IGFs (IGFBPs) are synthesized by the target tissues of IGF actions. Thus, IGFBPs may act as modulators for the biological functions of IGFs. We have characterized the rat IGFBPs (rIGFBPs) and studied their regulation by 17 beta-estradiol (beta E2) and human GH (hGH) in rat osteoblast-like (ROB) cell cultures. ROB cells were prepared from 19- to 20-day fetal rat calvariae by sequential collagenase digestion and studies were performed on the serum and phenol red-free conditioned medium of confluent cultures. [125I]IGF-I ligand blots showed that the major rIGFBP in the ROB is a nonglycosylated protein of 31 kilodaltons. This protein was immunoprecipitated by a specific antibody to rIGFBP-2 and messenger RNA for rIGFBP-2 was detected by RNA hybridization indicating that the rIGFBP-2 is the major rIGFBP of ROB. A minor band at 24 kilodaltons is likely to be the rat homologue of the newly isolated inhibitory IGFBP-4. The predominant glycosylated adult form of rIGFBPs of rat serum, rIGFBP-3, was undetectable. When cultures were treated with beta E2 for 2 days, there was a dose-dependent biphasic response which showed an inhibition of the rIGFBP-2 at low doses of 10(-11) to 10(-9) M and a stimulation at 10(-6) M. These changes in rIGFBP-2 parallel the changes in the endogenous IGF-I level. rIGFBP-2 level was not affected by 17 alpha-estradiol at the same concentration range. hGH, on the other hand stimulated the levels of rIGFBP-2 and rIGFBP-4 at doses ranging from 10(-11) to 10(-9) M without changing the IGF-I secretion. The alteration of the rIGFBPs by beta E2 and hGH suggests a role for these hormones in bone by modulating the biological functions of IGFs via their binding proteins.\r"

After purification of the active moiety by anion exchange chromatography and immunoprecipitation with the equine LH (eLH) monoclonal antibody, RRA activity remained in the supernatant. This activity was also recognized by a polyclonal LH antibody (GDN 15) with wide cross-species recognition. This active fraction was further purified by gel filtration chromatography and shown to displace labeled eLH in a dose-dependent fashion in the RRA with an inhibition slope of 2.8 compared with a slope of 1.1 for native eLH. This fraction also inhibited the LH-stimulated steroidogenesis of Leydig cells in vitro in a dose-dependent fashion, but had no effect on basal (minus LH) steroid production. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electroelution of this material demonstrated RRA activity in a fraction with a mol wt between 45-66 kDa. We conclude that this substance 1) competitively inhibited binding of eLH and hCG to the LH receptor, 2) antagonized LH-stimulated steroidogenesis in vitro, and 3) may represent a LH isoform found in association with infertility in these animals.\r"

Albumin treatment also increased binding of 125I-labeled AII to high affinity binding sites on adrenal cells. Lipid extracts of albumin solutions that were used to wash cells inhibited AII binding and aldosterone responses by washed glomerulosa cells. Chromatographic fractionation and mass spectroscopic analysis indicated that the inhibitors removed from cells by albumin were long chain fatty acids. Exogenous fatty acids not only inhibited AII binding, but they inhibited basal aldosterone production and increments in aldosterone caused by AII or dbcAMP, suggesting an effect on postreceptor steps in aldosteronogenesis. The most potent and most abundant fatty acids removed from adrenal cells were oleic, linoleic, and arachidonic. These fatty acids inhibited at micromolar concentrations in the absence of albumin and at somewhat higher concentrations in its presence. Cells that had been washed, then inhibited by exogenous oleic acid in vitro, were restored to their enhanced responsiveness by a second albumin wash, making it unlikely that cell damage is the mechanism of inhibition by fatty acids. Responses of fasciculata cells were not potentiated by albumin washes, and cortisol production was less sensitive than aldosterone production to exogenous fatty acids. Binding of ANP to glomerulosa cells was not affected by albumin or fatty acids. These results combined with clinical correlations make it plausible that unesterified fatty acids are naturally occurring regulators of the adrenal glomerulosa. Insulin's ability to lower plasma levels of fatty acids may be one way that it causes sodium retention.\r"
