  ".W": "The embryologic defect that results when the ventral and dorsal anlages of the pancreas do not fuse has been referred to as pancreas divisum. The patients who present with recurrent pancreatitis or pancreatitis-like pain in association with pancreas divisum should be investigated to determine the presence of minor papilla stenosis. In the present study of 11 patients, 9 became asymptomatic with surgical decompression of the dorsal pancreatic duct. Two surgical failures were related to wrong diagnosis and restenosis of the sphincteroplasty. A delay in the clearance of dye from the dorsal pancreatic duct after endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography was utilized to determine minor papilla stenosis. In the future, secretin ultrasound tests should prove of value in assessing minor papilla stenosis. Once the diagnosis is made, sphincteroplasty of the minor papilla is the most logical procedure because of the good results obtained. In the present study, pancreaticojejunostomy provided good duct decompression as well.\r"

  ".W": "The search for a site of origin for renal artery bypass grafting other than the inclusion aorta has resulted in a variety of recommendations, including use of the splenic, hepatic, gastroduodenal, and superior mesenteric arteries and even retrograde bypass grafts originating from the iliac artery. The present study has described our early experience with a new procedure utilizing an antegrade aortorenal bypass graft originating in the mediastinal supraceliac aorta. Eight patients underwent operation; four for renovascular hypertension and four for renal salvage plus hypertension. There were no operative deaths. All grafts (three saphenous and five polytetrafluoroethylene) functioned well, as judged by clinical response and renal scan. One graft failed at 6 weeks. Hypertension was cured in three patients and improved in four at a mean follow-up of 27 months (range 3 to 58 months). Improved hemodynamic performance of antegrade flow, avoidance of liver and biliary complications, and applicability to the right or left kidney are the advantages of this technique. When renal artery reconstruction is required and the infrarenal aorta is to be avoided, we believe this operation is a useful alternative.\r"

Magnetic resonance imaging has advantages over angiography in that is costs substantially less, is noninvasive, and reconstructs images in multiple planes. By utilizing multiplanar imaging, magnetic resonance imaging yields more information than angiography. The position of the left renal vein is imaged only by magnetic resonance, as is the origin of the superior mesenteric artery. Angiography remains important in patients with associated occlusive disease and claudication. The use of magnetic resonance in the emergent setting is limited at this time.\r"

We have concluded that delivery of standard doses of antineoplastic agents in 5 percent or 10 percent DMSO may be useful in the treatment of some tumors because of the marked increase in tumoricidal effect seen with some DMSO and drug combinations. Alternatively, lower doses of antineoplastic agents might be delivered in DMSO, producing the same cytotoxic effect as a full dose of drug without DMSO but with less systemic toxicity.\r"

The clinical clues of a prolonged symptom history, weight loss, anemia, and a palpable mass were frequently, but not invariably, present. Results of contrast enema, computerized axial tomography, and colonoscopy in this select group were frequently misleading. The diagnosis is best made in the operating room by the thoughtful appendectomist. I recommend prompt resection and an appropriate cancer procedure in these patients. Carcinoma masquerading as appendicitis occurs more often than is generally realized and will be seen more frequently as our aging population increases.\r"

One hundred seventeen patients were found to have aortic dissection between 1980 and 1986. Clinical presentation is of importance since hypertension favors the presence of type B dissection, whereas normotension or hypotension is usually indicative of a type A lesion. Supportive treatment should allow stabilization for diagnosis by angiography or computerized tomography in order to proceed with early surgical repair of all type A dissections. Management of the acute type B patient should initially be medical, but immediate surgical treatment should be carried out if there is failure to control the hypertension, continued pain, expansion or rupture of the aneurysm (including appearance of a pleural collection), development of a neurologic deficit, or evidence of compromise of a major infradiaphragmatic aortic branch. Any delay in surgical treatment once an indicative complication is identified will have an early adverse effect on prognosis. By applying these guidelines, an overall 65 to 75 percent hospital survival rate should be achieved.\r"

The proximal anastomosis was performed in the groin in all patients. The distal graft was taken to the popliteal artery in 45 percent and to a tibial or isolated popliteal segment in 55 percent, with 55 percent of the grafts having single-vessel runoff. The perioperative mortality rate was 7 percent. The primary immediate patency rate was 91 percent and the secondary immediate patency rate was 98 percent at 1 month. The cumulative patency rate at 42 months was 85.4 percent overall, 86.6 percent for the tibial grafts, and 84 percent for the popliteal grafts. The cumulative limb salvage rate was 100 percent for the popliteal grafts, 90 percent for the tibial grafts, and 94.5 percent overall. All of the patients were followed and 3 required secondary revision. In situ vein bypass is a technically demanding procedure that can be performed successfully in high-risk patients with limbs with minimal runoff and can yield very high long-term patency and limb salvage rates in a community hospital setting.\r"

Of those parameters evaluated as measures of early assessment, only rectal examination was found to be performed significantly more frequently after ATLS training. The mortality rates of 26 percent before ATLS and 20 percent after ATLS were not significantly different. In evaluating assessment and management parameters in the patients who died, no airway management errors were found in the after ATLS group; however, there were more missed injuries in this group. We have concluded that ATLS instruction failed to produce a quantifiable improvement in patient assessment or outcome. Further studies directed at assessing the retention rate for ATLS education and determining the impact on clinical performance are needed.\r"

All surviving patients with severe brain injury sustained residual long-term disability. The incidence of injury and death was much higher for motorcyclists than for occupants of automobiles involved in accidents. Riding a motorcycle is dangerous and riding without a helmet is fool-hardy. Helmets also protect the face, as facial fractures were twice as common in the nonhelmeted riders. There were no significant differences between nonhelmeted and helmeted motorcyclists in terms of overall injury as measured by an injury severity score of 16 or greater. Orthopedic injuries, in this study, were so common that orthopedic surgeons performed more major operations than all other surgical specialists combined. Depth of orthopedic coverage is essential to treat significant numbers of injured motorcyclists. Neurosurgeons are key members of a trauma care team. Helmet laws would help us utilize our limited neurosurgical capacity more effectively by reducing the incidence of brain injury. Medical professionals must educate the public regarding the societal and personal cost of unhelmeted motorcycle riding. Legislation mandating helmet usage for motorcycle riders must be sought.\r"

  ".W": "The authors studied the reduction in anesthetic requirement (MAC) and the hemodynamic effects of the highly selective alpha 2-adrenergic agonist azepexole in isoflurane-anesthetized dogs. Eleven male beagles were anesthetized with isoflurane in oxygen. After a 2-h equilibration period, they determined isoflurane MAC and baseline hemodynamic function. Azepexole (at 0.1, 0.3, and 1.0 mg/kg) was administered via a right atrial port over 15 min, while each dog was given isoflurane at the MAC dose for that animal. Twenty minutes after the end of infusion, at a time when hemodynamic variables were stable, they reassessed hemodynamic function. They then determined isoflurane MAC again. In other experiments, dogs were pretreated with either idazoxan (the alpha 2-adrenergic antagonist; n = 5) or naloxone (the opiate antagonist; n = 7) prior to the administration of azepexole. Isoflurane MAC was determined before and after each dose of azepexole. Isoflurane MAC decreased as the dose of azepexole increased, to the extent that at the highest dose (1 mg/kg) the decrement in MAC was more than 85%. This reduction of MAC caused by azepexole could be completely prevented by pretreatment with idazoxan, while naloxone was without effect. Azepexole did not change mean arterial blood pressure, but caused heart rate and cardiac output to progressively decrease. The MAC-reducing effect of azepexole appears to be mediated by alpha 2 adrenoreceptors. Given the extent of the reduction of MAC, it is unlikely that inhibition of central noradrenergic neurotransmission through agonism of presynaptic alpha 2 adrenoreceptors is the sole explanation, since complete disruption of central noradrenergic tracts decreases MAC by only 40%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The authors found that halothane alone (0.7 to 2.1 vol%) causes dose-dependent depressions of sinus rate and LVP, prolongs ASCT and IVCT, and produces atrioventricular (AV) block with junctional bradycardia. Histamine alone (.01-10 microM) increases sinus rate and LVP but, like halothane, prolongs ASCT. Halothane antagonizes the inotropic and chronotropic effects of histamine, but enhances ASCT compared with histamine alone. Histamine with halothane greatly increases the incidence of junctional tachycardia with AV dissociation from 0% with histamine alone up to 48%. Epinephrine alone (0.1-5 microM), like histamine, increases sinus rate and LVP, but does not cause a relative increase in ASCT. Halothane antagonizes the inotropic and chronotropic effects of epinephrine, but increases the incidence of ventricular tachycardia from 6% to 28%, and the incidence of premature ventricular excitations from 0% to 40%, compared with epinephrine alone. The authors' in vitro findings show that histamine and halothane, like epinephrine and halothane, can cause dysrhythmias, but that the genesis and type of dysrhythmias induced by these agents are dissimilar. Consequently, the release of histamine with an anaphylactoid reaction during halothane anesthesia, and the treatment of the reaction with epinephrine, could result in dangerous ventricular tachydysrhythmias.\r"

  ".W": "Baroreceptor reflex control of heart rate was studied in ten neonates and young infants before and after intravenous fentanyl (10 micrograms/kg). All infants were in stable condition while being mechanically ventilated. Mean (+/- SD) corrected gestational age was 40.1 +/- 3.7 weeks, mean weight 3120 +/- 700 g. The pressor response was tested using phenylephrine and the depressor response using nitroglycerin. Changes in heart rate (R-R interval) were plotted against changes in systolic arterial pressure, and the slope of the linear portion of this relationship expresses the baroreflex sensitivity. No significant changes in systolic arterial pressure, heart rate, and blood gas values were observed after fentanyl injection when compared to control values. Mean (+/- SEM) control phenylephrine slope was 8.44 +/- 2.05 msec/mmHg, and mean nitroglycerin slope was 2.54 +/- 0.37 msec/mmHg. Both slopes decreased significantly by 48% and 42%, respectively, after fentanyl injection (P less than 0.02). Mean plasma fentanyl concentrations measured at the end of each test were not statistically different (5.11 +/- 0.65 ng/ml and 4.28 +/- 0.58 ng/ml, respectively). This suggests that the baroreflex control of heart rate is present in term neonates and markedly depressed during fentanyl anesthesia. Changes in blood pressure occurring during fentanyl anesthesia have to be carefully considered, because cardiac output is principally rate-dependent in newborns.\r"

  ".W": "Mivacurium chloride (BW B1090U), a bis-benzylisoquinolinium diester compound, was found to undergo hydrolysis in vitro by purified human plasma cholinesterase in a pH-stat titrator at 88% of the rate of succinylcholine at pH 7.4, 37 degrees C and 5 microM substrate concentration. In 72 consenting ASA Physical Status I-II patients receiving nitrous oxide/oxygen-narcotic-thiopental anesthesia, the neuromuscular blocking effect of mivacurium was assessed following bolus doses from 0.03 to 0.30 mg/kg, as well as during and following continuous infusions from 35 to 324 min in length. The calculated ED95 for inhibition of adductor pollicis twitch evoked at 0.15 Hz was 0.08 mg/kg. At 0.1 mg/kg, 96% block developed, onset to maximum block required 3.8 +/- 0.5 min, and recovery to 95% twitch height occurred 24.5 +/- 1.6 (SE) min after injection. At 0.25 mg/kg, onset was 2.3 +/- 0.3 min; 95% recovery developed within 30.4 +/- 2.2 min, an increase in duration of action of only 24% versus 150% higher dosage. Comparative recovery indices from 5 to 95% or from 25 to 75% twitch heights did not differ significantly among all dosage groups from 0.1 to 0.3 mg/kg (range 12.9 to 14.7 and 6.6 to 7.2 min, respectively). In 38 patients who received mivacurium by continuous infusion (duration 88.1 +/- 7.1/47.1 min, SE/SD) for maintenance of 95 +/- 4% twitch inhibition, the mean 5-95% and 25-75% recovery indices after discontinuation of infusion were 14.4 +/- 0.6 and 6.5 +/- 0.3 min (P greater than 0.5 vs. all single bolus doses). The train-of-four (T4) ratio, within 2.6 +/- 0.5 min after 95% twitch recovery following bolus doses, averaged 79.5 +/- 1.8% (n = 32). Similarly, after discontinuation of infusions, the T4 ratio reached 73.4 +/- 1.9% within 3.4 +/- 1.9 min after 95% twitch recovery (n = 33). Antagonism of residual block was seldom indicated, but, to test ease of reversal, eight patients electively received neostigmine (0.06 mg/kg) with atropine (0.03 mg/kg) at 67 to 93 (76.6 +/- 3.5) % block. Twitch returned to 95% of control within 4.5 to 9.5 (6.3 +/- 0.5) min after neostigmine. Mivacurium may offer increased versatility in providing clinical muscle relaxation in a variety of situations. Further studies seem appropriate.\r"

Doses of 10 and 30 micrograms SST i.t. had no effect on thermal cutaneous nociception, (hot plate and tail flick response). Thirty micrograms SST i.t. did not effect the visceral chemical evoked nociception (acetic acid writhing test) as compared to saline control groups. Rats treated with 100 micrograms SST i.t. invariably showed temporary or permanent hindlimb motor dysfunction, with flaccid paralysis in the most severe cases (motor function tests, electromyographic response). Blockade of the tail flick and foot pinch response was observed to a variable degree, and only in the presence of detectable motor impairment. Out of 40 animals injected with 100 micrograms SST i.t., 25% died within 10 min following injection. Effects of SST on the volume evoked micturition reflex were assessed in rats with chronically implanted bladder catheters. Three of the nine surviving animals receiving 30 micrograms SST i.t. and all animals receiving an additional dose of 60 micrograms SST i.t. showed a complete block of the micturition reflex and subsequent development of an overflow bladder. Histological examination of spinal cords revealed a mild inflammatory response in four out of five animals treated with 30 micrograms SST i.t. In spinal cords of animals, which had received 100 micrograms SST i.t. (n = 4), mild or severe nucleolysis of ventral and dorsal horns in the presence of inflammatory reaction was observed. Present experiments clearly demonstrate highly toxic effects of SST in rats with no margin of safety between antinociception and motor dysfunction.\r"

  ".W": "Possible modulatory effects of mu-, delta-, and kappa-receptor agonists on the concurrent adrenal secretion of catecholamines and met-enkephalin evoked by staged hemorrhage were examined in four groups of cats (n = 5 in each group) anesthetized with halothane (1 MAC). Group I received saline, group II received the mu-agonist sufentanil (25 micrograms/kg i.v., followed by a maintenance infusion), group III received the delta/mu agonist metkephamid (3 mg/kg i.v.), and group IV the kappa agonist U50488H (3.5 mg/kg i.v.). Samples for norepinephrine, epinephrine, dopamine, and met-enkephalin were taken simultaneously from the adrenal vein, femoral vein, and femoral artery at baseline, after drug administration, and after induction of 25% and 50% hemorrhage. In cats receiving saline, 25% hemorrhage resulted in a significant decline in mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) and no change in adrenal secretion. Fifty percent hemorrhage evoked no significant further fall in MABP, but led to prominent increases in adrenal vein hormone levels (norepinephrine, 30-fold; dopamine, 14-fold; and epinephrine, ten-fold) as compared to post-saline values. During the pre-hemorrhage baseline state, administration of sufentanil evoked a significant six- to 20-fold rise in adrenal vein catecholamine and met-enkephalin levels, whereas the administration of metkephamid and U50488H produced no change in adrenal secretion and a decrease in MABP. After 25% and 50% hemorrhage, there was no difference in adrenal vein hormone levels in cats receiving the mu-, delta-, or kappa-agonists compared to those receiving saline. No differences were observed in the different treatment groups with regard to the proportional levels of catecholamines and met-enkephalin in the adrenal vein during the course of the experiment. The authors conclude that opioids are not involved in the regulation of the secretory adrenal medullary response evoked by hemorrhage, and that the systems involved in mediating these cardiovascular reflexes differ pharmacologically from those systems mediating the autonomic response evoked by pain.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of 1.5, 2.0, and 2.5 MAC halothane (N = 8) and isoflurane (N = 6) upon systolic performance and isovolumic relaxation were evaluated in open chest dogs. Left ventricular internal volume was determined using piezoelectric crystals. Left ventricular end-systolic pressure-volume points were determined for a series of normal sinus beats during transient venae caval occlusions. The slope of the line formed by those points is a load-independent inotropic index (EES). Left ventricular pressure points during isovolumic relaxation were plotted for computing the time constant of isovolumic pressure decline (T). Both drugs dose-dependently decreased mean arterial blood pressure with no change in heart rate, end-diastolic pressure, or end-diastolic volume. Increasing halothane concentration decreased the values of EES, the maximum rate of rise of left ventricular pressure (dP/dtMAX), and systolic ejection fraction (SEF). Total systemic resistance was unchanged by halothane. Increasing isoflurane concentration decreased EES and dP/dtMAX. The EES was significantly larger (P less than 0.05) with 2.5 MAC isoflurane than 2.5 MAC halothane. The SEF was unchanged by increasing isoflurane. Total systemic vascular resistance was decreased by increasing isoflurane. Isovolumic relaxation was prolonged and became more load-dependent with increasing halothane concentration. Isoflurane did not alter T, but the load-dependency of T was increased by 2.5 MAC isoflurane. There were no differences in T or its load-dependency between drug groups. These results indicate that both anesthetics evoke load-independent negative inotropic effects. Systolic ejection fraction is maintained during isoflurane anesthesia by decreased systemic vascular resistance and less pronounced negative inotropic effects than equivalent MAC halothane.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

All patients were anesthetized with nitrous oxide and isoflurane. We recorded and quantitated the force of thumb adduction in response to supramaximal ulnar nerve stimulation. Plasma concentrations of vecuronium and its 3-desacetyl metabolite were determined by a capillary gas chromatography assay. Only the time to attain 100% twitch depression (onset time) was prolonged in liver disease patients (2.8 +/- 0.7 min; mean +/- SD) as compared to control patients (1.9 +/- 0.4 min). The time from vecuronium administration to recovery of twitch tension was unaffected by alcoholic liver disease. The time to the reappearance of twitch response was 32.7 +/- 9.7 min in patients with liver disease and 36.8 +/- 15.5 min in controls. Plasma concentration-time data were fit to a two-compartment model. Vecuronium clearance, steady-state volume of distribution, and elimination half-time were unchanged by alcoholic liver disease. The authors conclude that alcoholic liver disease does not affect the pharmacokinetics or duration of action of vecuronium when an intravenous bolus dose of 0.1 mg.kg-1 is administered.\r"

Twenty-four male Wistar rats were divided into four groups; three groups with intact cortex received 0.5, 2, or 4% enflurane, and one group with unilateral cortex excised received 4% enflurane. LCGU was measured at each anesthetic concentration using the autoradiographic 2-[14C]deoxyglucose method. LCGU in ten of 33 structures examined during 2% enflurane decreased by 19-33%, and LCGU in 22 structures during 4% enflurane decreased by 19-65%, when compared with that during 0.5% enflurane. While LCGU, in most structures, decreased in a dose-related manner, LCGU in the corpus callosum, thalamic ventrobasal complex, and hippocampal CA3 field during 4% enflurane increased by 31-70%, compared with that during 0.5% and/or 2% enflurane. With unilateral cortical excision during 4% enflurane, the increase in LCGU in the ventrobasal complex was obliterated in the excision side, and the increase in the corpus callosum was attenuated. High LCGU in the hippocampal CA3 field and contralateral ventrobasal complex was not affected with cortical excision. These results indicate that intercortical and corticothalamic pathways are metabolically activated during deep enflurane anesthesia, suggesting that the epileptogenic property of enflurane is related to activation of these pathways.\r"

Mycoplasmas as the microbial prototype and joint fluids from the rheumatoid host were investigated. Protein-A affinity chromatography was used to isolate the immunoglobulin complex (IgG-IC) in six synovial fluids obtained from rheumatoid arthritis patients. The IgG-IC was digested with pepsin to further purify and obtain F(ab)2 complexes with greater specificity. The F(ab)2 complexes were dissociated and electrophoresed by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting using affinity purified rabbit antisera to six reference strains of human mycoplasmas. The presence of trace amount of mycoplasma antigens in the immune complex fractions was indicated by specific banding with antisera to M. pneumoniae, M. arthritidis, M. hominis, M. fermantans, and M. salivarium in one or more of the six synovial fluid fractions. The ELISA and immunoblot assays of seroconversion in rabbits immunized with the synovial fluid fractions also indicated the presence of mycoplasmal antigens.\r"

Recent experimental and clinical reports have suggested that beta-2 adrenergic stimulation impairs and beta-2 adrenergic blockade enhances the histamine effect on vascular permeability. This led us to study the effect of salbutamol and of propranolol on histamine-induced cutaneous response in 13 healthy subjects and in 16 patients with allergic oculo-rhinitis. Both in normal subjects and in atopic patients salbutamol attenuated the whealing response to histamine and the protective effect of salbutamol was counteracted by propranolol. The ability, however, of salbutamol to inhibit histamine-induced response was significantly reduced in 50% of atopic patients. These findings suggest that beta-2 adrenergic hyporesponsiveness is present in some allergic patients.\r"

Group A consisted of 24 Ps-negative patients, and Group B consisted of 32 Ps-positive patients, including eight patients who expired. Several clinical and laboratory parameters were evaluated. Although the precise mechanism causing the appearance of Ps in the respiratory tract of CF patients remains elusive, we analyzed several biologic characteristics of both host and organism. This study indicates that frequent use of antibiotics combined with the eradication of Staphylococcus aureus from the respiratory tract heralds the onset of persistent Ps colonization and a subsequent downhill course for CF patients.\r"

Rates of death from asthma have been higher among boys than girls, probably due to higher prevalence of asthma among boys. Increases in rates of death from asthma have occurred in most age groups because of much higher rates of death and greater increases in rates of death among blacks than whites. Prevalence of asthma is not sufficiently greater among blacks to account for rates of death 3 to 5 times as great as those for white children. Increases in deaths due to asthma have occurred in 47 states, and deaths have occurred in metropolitan children of both races in approximate proportion to their distribution to metropolitan areas. At least 46% of deaths from asthma in children and adolescents less than 20 years of age have occurred at hospitals. Reviews of deaths from asthma have implicated delays in implementation of appropriate therapy, including adrenal corticosteroids, psychosocial dysfunction that has interfered with compliance with recommended management, and underestimation of the seriousness of airway obstruction. Some deaths have been sudden and unavoidable.\r"

DESIGN: Survey of clinical and electroencephalographic changes during induced cardiac dysrhythmia. SETTING: Clinical electrophysiology laboratory of a university medical center. PATIENTS: Fourteen patients with automatic cardioverter defibrillators due to previous cardiac arrest or life-threatening cardiac arrhythmia. INTERVENTION: Deliberate induction of cardiac dysrhythmia for routine, postoperative testing of the automatic implantable cardioverter defibrillator. Continuous electrocardiographic, electroencephalographic, and video recording. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Twenty-two episodes of ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation, lasting 15 to 126 seconds, were induced with definite loss of consciousness in 15 instances and probable loss in 2. In 10 episodes, there were motor accompaniments to the unconsciousness characterized by tonic activity or irregular muscle twitching. On regaining consciousness, patients were usually obtunded or confused for up to 30 seconds, depending on duration of induced cardiac dysrhythmia and unconsciousness. Electroencephalographic changes were variable. Background slowing was usually followed by relative loss of electrocerebral activity. In 2 patients, attenuation of background electrocerebral activity followed little or no change in background rhythms. In 5 episodes, electroencephalograms showed no change before loss of consciousness, but slowed thereafter in 4. CONCLUSIONS: Conspicuous motor activity may accompany syncope due to malignant ventricular arrhythmia and complicate the clinical distinction of syncope from seizures. Post-syncopal confusion generally lasts for less than 30 seconds. The electroencephalographic accompaniments of acute cerebral anoxia leading to syncope, and of the motor accompaniments of syncope, are more variable than previously appreciated, but electrographic seizure activity does not occur.\r"

DESIGN AND PATIENTS: We studied the time course of tracheal occlusion pressure (P0.1) and high-to-low ratio of the diaphragmatic electromyogram in 16 patients in acute respiratory failure with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. METHODS: All patients were intubated and studied during a 15-minute weaning period from ventilation. Minute ventilation (VE), arterial blood gases, P0.1 and high-to-low ratio of the diaphragm were measured every day from the onset to the end of acute failure (before extubation) at 5 and 15 minutes into the weaning period. The diaphragmatic electromyogram was recorded with an esophageal electrode and the high-to-low ratio of the electrical signal analyzed to assess diaphragmatic fatigue. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: In all patients P0.1 was markedly increased (7.1 +/- 2.4 cm H2O, mean +/- SE) on the first day of acute failure and did not change during weaning. In 11 patients, P0.1 had decreased to 4.7 +/- 1.8 cm H2O (P less than or equal to 0.002) before extubation (which was done after 5 to 9 days). In these patients, the high-to-low ratio of the diaphragm decreased rapidly-during the first minutes of weaning on the first day of acute failure and remained low throughout weaning, whereas before extubation no decrease in high-to-low ratio was seen during weaning. In 5 patients, P0.1 did not change significantly from the onset of acute failure and the high-to-low ratio remained low before extubation. These 5 patients had to be reintubated within 2 to 6 days. In both groups of patients, VE did not change significantly from the first to last day of acute failure (10.3 +/- 3 compared with 10.7 +/- 2.1 min-1), whereas blood gases during room air breathing improved significantly from the first to last day of acute failure, respectively, in each group (arterial oxygen pressure [PaO2], 33.5 +/- 1.5 compared with 44 +/- 9 mm Hg (P less than or equal to 0.05) and PaO2 56 +/- 2.3 compared with 49 +/- 2 mm Hg (P less than 0.005). CONCLUSIONS: Extubation should not be done in patients with respiratory muscle fatigue despite improvement in arterial blood gases and clinical status; and P0.1 provides a valid and simple index to assess the likelihood of respiratory muscle fatigue.\r"

Magnetic resonance imaging showed abnormal results in 12 of 16 (75%; 95% CI, 48 to 93) patients with active central nervous system disease (67 focal lesions predominantly within the subcortical and periventricular white matter), and in 2 of 22 (9%; 95% CI, 1 to 29) patients without clinical evidence of central nervous system disease (P less than 0.0001). Seven of eight patients with focal neurologic deficits and 5 of 8 patients with psychiatric or cognitive dysfunction alone had abnormal results on MR imaging. Magnetic resonance imaging was more sensitive in the subgroup with focal deficits, (sensitivity, 88%; 95% CI, 44 to 97) than computerized axial tomography or cerebral angiography.

Competition, cost control, and public accountability have created the need for hospitals to assure effective privilege delineation processes. Hospitals should focus on issues of practice variation, continuity of care, volume of services provided and planned, and the integration of ethical considerations into clinical decisions. How information is obtained, verified, and acted upon is reviewed within the organizational framework of the hospital. Several leaders within the hospital, such as the clinical department chairs and members of the medical staff executive committee, have important functions in the clinical privilege delineation process. Granting clinical privileges is a critical hospital function that requires a commitment by the governing body, management, and medical staff leaders.\r"

Between March 1981 and August 1986, 20 patients with previous augmentation mammoplasty were treated for breast carcinoma. All patients had unilateral infiltrating carcinomas and presented with a palpable mass. None of the cancers were occult (discovered mammographically). Thirteen patients (65%) had metastases to axillary lymph nodes. During the same period, 733 nonaugmented patients with breast cancer were treated: 207 (28%) had involved axillary nodes, 194 (26%) had in situ lesions, and 154 cancers (21%) were occult. Augmentation mammoplasty with sillicone-gel-filled implants reduces the ability of mammography, our best diagnostic tool, to visualize breast parenchyma. When compared with our own nonaugmented breast cancer population, augmented patients with breast cancer presented with more advanced disease; they had a higher percentage of invasive lesions and positive axillary nodes, resulting in a worsened prognosis.\r"

A significantly higher pressure in the common bile duct was documented in patients with cholangitis when compared with the other two groups. Twenty-four patients with cholangitis had common duct pressure values above 20 cm H2O, the maximal values of normal. Additionally, patients with cholangitis with pressure values over 30 cm H2O (nine patients) showed absence of green bile in the extrahepatic biliary tract, suggesting cessation of bile excretion into biliary duct. In all these cases, an impacted stone at the distal end of the common bile duct was documented.\r"

Five patients were treated successfully by selective arterial embolization. In the other five patients, embolization was not possible due to previous surgical and/or radiologic procedures, or it was contraindicated, and thus, surgical treatment was undertaken. One of these patients died. There were no long-term sequelae in the remaining nine patients followed up for 12 to 66 months. Selective hepatic arterial embolization is the treatment of choice for hemobilia. Inappropriate embolization or surgery frequently fails to control the bleeding and may also prevent later successful embolization.\r"

Terminology was defined and applied to the interpretation of the CT image in 55 prospective cases. Correlation of geometric parameters of aneurysm and analysis of the relationship of internal aneurysm components such as lumen and thrombus was performed. Predictive growth patterns for aneurysm demonstrated a synchronous increase in the volume of thrombus within the aneurysm in those aneurysms measuring 5 to 7 cm. Aneurysms greater than 7 cm were associated with an expansion of the patent pulsatile lumen, with no appreciable increase in thrombus volume. The thrombus-lumen ratio effectively described the changing internal architecture of aneurysm associated with increase in size. Proper utilization of CT descriptors develops a language that interprets aneurysm stability and potential for rupture and may provide an improved basis for timely surgical planning.\r"

In 14 cases the diagnosis before surgery was virtually impossible, as patients presented with vague abdominal complaints and nonspecific physical examination findings. Laboratory testing (including computed tomography) was of no added diagnostic help. Widespread peritoneal neoplastic growth was the common finding at laparotomy. The tumor was grossly indistinguishable from other types of abdominal carcinomatosis. Electron microscopy proved to be the diagnostic tool of choice. Routine histologic techniques often gave nondiagnostic results. Intraperitoneal asbestos fibers were not observed. Treatment with radiation, chemotherapy, or both produced a 50% partial response rate, but survival was not affected. Malignant ascites was effectively palliated without complication in two of three patients with peritoneovenous shunting. An unusual case occurred in which histologic material from a second-look laparotomy documented complete response to a new regimen of intraperitoneal chemotherapy.\r"

Results indicated that patients with MS have difficulty in processing information at the level of a hypothesized articulatory loop in working memory. This deficit was correlated with their retrieval of verbal information from long-term memory, as well as how accurately they processed verbal information presented at a rapid rate. There was no significant relationship between ratings of MS severity or number of plaques visualized on magnetic resonance imaging scans and the degree of working memory deficit.\r"

Although there were marked differences in the extent and severity of cognitive disturbance among individual patients, as a group they were impaired compared with controls on all measures. Deficits were most striking on the Symbol-Digit Modalities Test and the verbal fluency measures, tests that require rapid information processing. More than 75% of the patients scored below the tenth percentile for controls on the Symbol-Digit Modalities Test, while 61% scored below the tenth percentile on verbal fluency. Memory disturbances were also common. More than 45% of the patients scored below the tenth percentile. The proportion of impaired patients was quite similar for anterograde and remote memory tests and for recall and recognition procedures. The pattern of memory disturbance and slowed information processing resembled deficits generally observed in subcortical dementias, such as Huntington's disease, but in addition, the patients with multiple sclerosis showed naming difficulties that are usually associated with cortical dementias, such as Alzheimer's disease.\r"

For both sexes, x-ray film examination occurred more frequently among cases than referents, possibly as an effect of early symptoms from the disease itself.\r"

The average age at onset was 29.7 years, with one relapse average every 1.9 years. Optic-spinal recurrence was the most common clinical pattern of the disease, accounting for 63.3% (19/30) of the cases. All the patients had spinal cord involvement sometime during the course of the illness. The mortality was high at 36.7% (11/30), with an average duration of symptoms of 7.6 years. There was characteristic severe residual visual and motor disability. At the time of the last examination, 12 patients had bilateral optic atrophy with blindness or severe visual acuity impairment. Sixteen patients were bedridden or confined to a wheelchair. The severe motor disability reflected the severe spinal cord involvement. It was the main factor that accounted for the high mortality. The cerebral, cerebellar, and brain-stem involvements were, however, generally transient. None of the patients' had a family history of similar illness despite the average sibling size of six. There was no example of Devic's disease. The clinical pattern was closest to those patients who presented from Taiwan.\r"

First, monoclonal antibodies specific for either murine coronaviruses (mouse hepatitis viruses) or human coronaviruses were used to characterize the antigenic features of MS-derived coronaviruses SK and SD. Both isolates were found to have a mouse hepatitis virus-type profile. Second, serum and cerebrospinal fluid antibodies to different coronaviruses, including SD, were measured in MS and control groups. No significant difference in antibody level to coronaviruses was found between MS and control samples. The results of these antigenic studies do not support a specific association between MS and coronaviruses.\r"

Findings of gross examination of the brain and spinal cord were unremarkable. Histologic examination revealed scattered subpial foci of demyelination throughout the brain stem, with involvement of the hippocampal formation bilaterally. Although occasional active lesions at early stages of development were noted, most lesions were gliotic and therefore quiescent. This case and one similar example of disseminated subpial demyelination found in the literature probably represent an unusual variant of multiple sclerosis.\r"

Patients with PPMA (n = 57) were compared with patients with a history of poliomyelitis but without a history of progressive weakness (n = 49). Patients who later developed PPMA had histories of more widespread acute paralysis, but relatively greater functional recovery. They were less disabled, and reported higher recent activity levels. Seventy-nine percent of the total variance between the PPMA and control groups could be accounted for by recovery alone (ie, severity minus disability). Functional recovery is generally attributed to reinnervation of sarcomeres by collateral sprouting from surviving lower motor neurons. Since degree of recovery predicts the risk of developing PPMA, our findings suggest that enlarged motor units may carry an increased susceptibility for dysfunction and/or degeneration.\r"

Nine neonatal electroencephalograms were abnormal; seven of eight of these abnormal tracings normalized during the follow-up period. Bayley developmental scores remained normal during the first year of life and did not differ from either passively addicted infants without seizures or from published population norms. This short-term favorable prognosis for abstinence-associated seizures differs from that associated with neonatal seizures due to other causes. This observed improvement in neurologic function may be based on replenishment of neurotransmitters following transient depletion in the neonatal period.\r"

Computed tomograms of the legs revealed no evidence of tumor. Surgical decompression of the involved S-1 nerve root had no obviously beneficial effect in reducing the calf enlargement. More information is needed to define the natural course of the calf enlargement and to clarify the pathophysiologic processes involved.\r"

Severe neurologic deficits rapidly resolved with steroids plus cyclophosphamide, and he remains in remission after two years. This case illustrates potentially misleading early manifestations of isolated cerebral angiitis, diagnostic limitations of angiography, the value of biopsy that includes both brain parenchyma and leptomeninges, and the potential efficacy of steroid and cyclophosphamide therapy in small-vessel disease. Clinical features and response to treatment vary widely in reported cases, suggesting that isolated cerebral angiitis may have diverse etiologies.\r"

The remaining eyes were not randomized due to intraoperative surgical complications, but they were included in the follow-up studies. Six weeks after surgery, angiographic CME was documented in 24% of the capsulotomy group and in 16% of the capsule intact group. The differences were not statistically significant. Including nonrandomized cases reduced the overall incidence of angiographic CME and the difference between the two groups. Angiographic CME was usually not extensive, and it was associated with a visual acuity less than 20/40 in 2.5% of eyes six weeks postoperatively. A subgroup of 120 eyes was followed up for approximately six months, when angiographic CME was present in 4% of the capsulotomy and capsule intact groups.\r"

Six patients underwent an uncomplicated extracapsular cataract extraction with placement of a posterior chamber intraocular lens, and in two patients, surgery was complicated by vitreous loss. In each case the retinopathy progressed to a severe exudative form of diabetic macular edema, characterized by diffuse retinal thickening and fluorescein leakage with increased dot and blot hemorrhages and lipid deposition. In all patients, clinically significant macular edema developed in the eye that had been operated on, and six patients received laser photocoagulation for this condition. Final visual acuity was worse than preoperative visual acuity in six of eight patients, and it was unchanged in two of six patients. No patient achieved a visual acuity better than 20/50. The fellow eyes, which were not operated on, remained stable during the follow-up period.\r"

Overall we found 63% of the Tono-Pen readings to be within +/- 2 mm Hg of the Goldmann applanation tonometry readings and 77% to be within +/- 3 mm Hg, while 4% were within at least +/- 7 mm Hg difference. The correlation coefficient between the readings of the two instruments was .84. The mean value of the paired differences was 0.81 +/- 3.09 mm Hg overall, -1.78 +/- 1.86 mm Hg in the 4 to 10 mm Hg interval, 0.07 +/- 2.97 mm Hg in the 11 to 20 mm Hg interval, 1.27 +/- 2.62 mm Hg in the 21 to 30 mm Hg interval, and 4.15 +/- 2.28 mm Hg in the 31 to 45 mm Hg interval. We conclude that the Tono-Pen measures intraocular pressure in a manner that corresponds well to the Goldmann tonometer in the 11 to 20 mm Hg interval, and fairly well in the 4 to 10 mm Hg and 21 to 30 mm Hg intervals. It lacks good correspondence in the 31 to 45 mm Hg interval.\r"

Patients were followed up for at least four months after injury; visual results as well as epidemiological factors were analyzed. Based on these findings, children in the 0- to 5-year-old group were at greatest risk, regardless of sex; among children older than 5 years, eye injuries were more frequent in boys. Generally, the child takes part in the accident as an active participant, and adequate adult supervision decreases the number of these accidents. Analysis of the relationship between socioeconomic levels of the parents and severity of eye injuries revealed that severe eye injuries were more frequent in lower socioeconomic strata. In severe eye injuries 35.1% of the children ended with visual acuity under 20/200 in the affected eye, which corresponds to 9% of all studied eye injuries.\r"

Because of the potential for contact with the corneal endothelium, its toxicity to the endothelium is an important consideration. The effect of fluorouracil on corneal endothelial integrity in an in vitro animal model was studied. Freshly excised sheep corneal buttons were exposed to increasing concentrations of fluorouracil for four hours and were subsequently evaluated microscopically using vital staining with alizarin red and trypan blue. Exposure to normal saline and chlorhexidine gluconate was used to establish negative- and positive-staining controls. Corneal buttons exposed to normal saline or to 1.0 mg/mL or less of fluorouracil had intact endothelial monolayers that completely excluded trypan blue. Corneal buttons exposed to chlorhexidine gluconate or to 10 mg/mL of fluorouracil, however, had severely or totally disrupted endothelial monolayers in which the remaining cells, if any, all had blue-staining nuclei. These results suggest that the threshold concentration for fluorouracil toxicity to corneal endothelium lies between 1 and 10 mg/mL when exposure time is four hours.\r"

Similar elevations were seen in monkeys. Under hyperbaric conditions (2 atm) for 30 minutes the aqueous PO2 in rabbits breathing room air can be increased to 295.2 +/- 132.4 mm Hg (n = 7) by exposing the rabbit cornea to 100% oxygen for 30 minutes. The high PO2 under these hyperbaric conditions is mediated by both vascular and transcorneal delivery of oxygen. The increase of PO2 in the rabbit aqueous can prevent or reverse sickling of intracameral human erythrocytes containing sickle hemoglobin. The exposure of rabbit eyes to 100% oxygen at the corneal surface is followed by autoregulation (constriction) of the iris vasculature. Transcorneal or vascular delivery of oxygen to the eye under normobaric or hyperbaric conditions may possibly benefit patients with hypoxic diseases of the anterior segment such as anterior segment necrosis, rubeosis iridis, or sickle cell hyphema.\r"

Epithelial defects healed significantly more slowly following 10-mm-diameter SLK than following DBK. Restoration of normal epithelial morphology occurred within two weeks in the DBK corneas. During the same interval, SLK corneas showed poor transition of basal to superficial cell morphology. Four days after surgery, the DBK corneas all exhibited marked keratocyte depletion in the anterior stroma but fibrocytes uniformly repopulated this area by 14 days after wounding. Conversely, the SLK corneas all had a hypercellular band of fibrocytes in the anterior stroma by four days following surgery and continued to increase in cellularity through 14 days after wounding. These data indicate that DBK is the preferred procedure for creation of a recipient bed for epithelial lenticles in keratoepithelioplasty and conjunctival transplantation.\r"

Two related studies, a case-control study in which multiple control groups were employed and a 15-year cohort study of all cases and controls, provided an opportunity to compare controls selected at random from an ophthalmology practice with controls selected at random from the general population. Participation rates were higher among office patients selected for study, both in the case-control study and in the cohort study. In the cohort study, office controls were more likely to lose visual acuity and to develop new degenerative eye conditions. These differences between control groups selected from two different sources emphasize the need for careful evaluation of potential groups of controls with respect to biases that each may bring to interpretation of clinical research findings.\r"

Photocoagulation burns of equal size and intensity were placed in two rabbit eyes with the solid-state laser system and the regular green argon laser system, respectively, using the same slit-lamp mode of delivery. Histologic findings of lesion sections revealed no important differences between the two systems. In theory, the longer wavelength of the solid-state laser offers the advantages of less scattering in ocular media, higher absorption by oxyhemoglobin, and less absorption by macular xanthophyll than the 514-nm wavelength of the regular green argon laser. The solid-state laser has impressive technical advantages: it contains no argon-ion gas tube that wears out and is expensive to replace; it is much more power efficient, and thus considerably smaller and compact; it is sturdier and easily movable; it does not require external cooling; it uses a 220-V monophasic alternating current; and it requires little maintenance.\r"

Of the skiers 81% were male, and 62% were between the ages of 15 and 26 years. Fourteen of 16 cases resulted from collisions with objects, most commonly trees. The predominance of head and upper body injuries was striking, and fractures of the lower extremities were uncommon. Lethal head/neck injuries accounted for all but two of the deaths. Only one skier was wearing a helmet. Speed and loss of control were the two major contributing factors identified in these accidents. The need for research and development in the prevention of this class of ski accidents is emphasized.\r"

A total of 784 cases were studied; all but 2 were acute ingestions. No patients developed severe manifestations of toxicity, and 88.3% were entirely asymptomatic. The most common symptoms were vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. Lethargy, headache, lightheadedness, and atypical rash were seen less frequently. Boric acid levels were obtained in 51 patients and ranged from 0 to 340 micrograms/mL. Blood levels were 70 micrograms/mL or more in 7 patients; 4 remained asymptomatic, whereas the other 3 had nausea or vomiting. Dialysis was performed in 4 of these 7 patients, only 1 of whom had symptoms (vomiting). On the basis of data from 9 patients, the mean half-life of boric acid was determined to be 13.4 hours (range, 4.0 to 27.8). Hemodialysis in 3 patients significantly shortened the half-life compared with pre- and postdialysis half-lives. Our results suggest that acute boric acid ingestions produce minimal or no toxicity and that aggressive treatment is not necessary in most patients.\r"

The mean peak theophylline concentration was 58 micrograms/mL (range, 21 to 115), and the mean nadir of serum potassium was 3.0 mEq/L (range, 2.1 to 3.9). In 85% of the patients, the nadir of serum potassium was less than 3.5 mEq/L; 45% had potassium concentrations of less than 3 mEq/L. The severity of hypokalemia correlated with peak serum theophylline concentrations (p less than 0.001). Hypokalemia was observed early in the course of the overdose (mean, 5 hours after ingestion or administration of theophylline). The nadir in serum potassium concentrations was more severe among 25 patients who presented to the emergency department within 6 hours of the overdose than among 13 patients who presented later (mean +/- SE, 3.0 +/- 0.1 mEq/L vs 3.4 +/- 0.1 mEq/L, p less than 0.01), despite similar admission serum theophylline concentrations in both groups (49 +/- 5 and 55 +/- 5 micrograms/mL, respectively; p = not significant). Spontaneous or ipecac-induced emesis occurred in 95% of the patients; however, hypokalemia preceded vomiting in 13 patients. Its severity was similar whether patients did or did not vomit before its occurrence. Hypokalemia is a frequent manifestation of acute theophylline poisoning, has a very early onset, and occurs independently of vomiting, suggesting an intracellular shift of potassium.\r"

Patients taking medications that affected platelet activity or who had venipuncture attempts within 1 week in the same extremity were excluded. A total of 21 patients (age, 38.8 +/- 15 years; weight, 77.3 +/- 22.5 kg) were studied. The majority were obese (62%) and/or did not have prominent veins even when a standard tourniquet cuff was placed (71%). Use of the device was successful in 19 patients (90%), with a mean time to venipuncture after vacuum removal of 38 +/- 30 seconds. In the 2 patients in whom the device was unsuccessful, both patients were intravenous drug users and subsequently required either external jugular or central venous line placement. Seven patients had unsuccessful attempts at venipuncture or intravenous cannulation on the opposite extremity immediately before use of the device. In these 7 patients, subsequent use of the device was 100% successful (p = 0.0003, Fisher's exact test, assuming all attempts using standard techniques would have been unsuccessful). When conventional tourniquets are unsuccessful for venipuncture, the use of the venous distension device may obviate the need for more invasive forms of venous access.\r"

In the infantile group, rapidly progressive interference with swallowing, vocalization, and respiration was encountered in less than half the patients. Symptoms were often prolonged before parents sought attention for their child. No preference was shown for maintenance of the upright position while at rest, as recumbency did not promote stridor or initiate respiratory distress. Respiratory complaints were common and included cough, tachypnea, and retractions. Drooling or retention of pharyngeal secretions was uncommon. The adult population had a history of symptoms that spanned several days. Extreme sore throat, pooling of oral secretions, muffled voice, and elevated temperature were uncommon. Dysphagia and mild respiratory complaints were frequent. Upper airway obstruction did occur. At both extremes of age, exceptions to the classic clinical pattern of epiglottitis occurred with significant frequency. Despite this, diagnosis and management in the emergency department were appropriate in most cases.\r"

The patients differed with regard to risk; one patient had existing cardiopulmonary disease, and the other was free of such risk factors except liver disease. An apparently appropriate dose of intravenous phenytoin was initiated in each case, and the patients were monitored appropriately and given supplemental oxygen. Bradycardia, hypotension, respiratory distress, and, ultimately, cardiopulmonary arrest occurred in both. The criteria proposed by Earnest et al. should be implemented for each seizure case that requires a decision on the urgent need for therapeutic anticonvulsant levels, whether by mechanical infusion, manual intravenous push, or oral loading. The mechanical infusion is the easiest method to standardize and monitor. The manual intravenous push has a greater possibility of inadvertent overdosage during some small time frame, as well as more local symptoms by some reports. Record et al. have recommended oral loading in selected patients. Careful consideration must be made of the choice of environment in which intravenous loading is done (e.g., emergency department, intensive care unit), as dictated by patient parameters, nursing staff levels, and planned disposition. The crucial factors contributing to the deterioration of both patients in the two cases presented were the concentration of phenytoin manually infused and the possibility that their high-risk status made them poor candidates for manual intravenous phenytoin. Dose and a hypersensitivity reaction were doubtful factors in these cases.\r"

Alterations in sodium homeostasis have been demonstrated to influence sympathetic nervous function, centrally and peripherally. In this investigation, we have examined the effect of dietary sodium on the development of myocardial hypertrophy; and the role of sympathetic neuroeffector mechanisms in the hypertrophic response. Studies were performed in three groups of uninephrectomized rats: A-regular diet; B-1% saline/regular diet; C-1% Saline/doca/regular diet. Groups A and B did not develop systemic hypertension (SHT). Saline treatment increased heart weight and the density of surface alpha 1-receptors; myocardial norepinephrine (NE) was reduced. Group C developed SHT. Heart weight was greatest in Group C; and myocardial NE was severely depleted. Downregulation of myocardial alpha 1-receptors, a finding consistent with the hyperadrenergic state, was observed in Group C. Our results suggest dietary sodium may modulate hypertrophic response in myocardial tissue, by altering sympathetic neuroeffector mechanisms.\r"

On the basis of beat by beat analysis, hourly and 24-hour means of mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) were obtained. The standard deviations and variation coefficients of the hourly means were used as a measure of absolute and relative blood pressure variability respectively. By randomization patients were ambulant during the day (group A; n = 19) or they were restricted to bed (group B). The patients of group B were sensory deprived during the first 4 hours of the blood pressure recording. During the night MAP, HR, and their respective variabilities were similar for both groups. During bed rest MAP was reduced as compared to ambulant values (P less than 0.05), but bed rest had no effect on HR, or on the variability of HR and MAP. During concomitant sensory deprivation HR and the variability of MAP and HR all declined to nightly values, though MAP did not change. In group B, HR-variability (absolute and relative) was inversely correlated to age, but no relationship between these two parameters was observed in group A. During concomitant sensory deprivation, but not during bed rest alone or during night rest, relative MAP-variability was also inversely correlated to age. It is concluded that sensory stimuli have an important effect on HR and on the variability of MAP and HR, but not on MAP itself, indicating that to some extent blood pressure and its variability are regulated independently.\r"

Alterations in urine electrolyte excretion, kinins, total and intact kininogen, and total active kallikrein were determined before and after the diuretic administration. Chlorothiazide caused a significant increase in total, but not active, kallikrein and had no effect on kinins and total or intact kininogen. Furosemide did not alter total or active kallikrein, or intact kininogen, but did decrease kinin and total kininogen excretion significantly. These differences in effects were not related to urinary sodium excretion or urinary flow because both diuretics produced comparable effects on these parameters. We conclude that acute infusions of diuretics do not activate the kallikrein-kininogen-kinin system and that some of the previously described effects of diuretics on this system may be related to their site of action.\r"

Animals were assessed monthly for 8 months before sacrifice. When compared to normotensive diabetic rats (WKY-STZ), hypertensive diabetic rats (SHR-STZ) had an earlier and more rapid rise in urinary albumin excretion. In addition, SHR-STZ had increased glomerular basement membrane thickness when compared to WKY-STZ or SHR. In a separate experiment, Enalapril therapy (35 mg/L) was administered in drinking water to WKY-STZ and SHR-STZ. Enalapril significantly reduced blood pressure in both animal groups, and this was associated with a decrease in urinary albumin excretion. The SHR-STZ model has accelerated nephropathy as determined by both functional and structural parameters. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition is associated with a reduction in albuminuria in both hypertensive and normotensive models of diabetic nephropathy.\r"

To examine the role of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) and central catecholaminergic neurons in this predisposition to the development of hypertension, the activity of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) was determined in SNS and in several brain regions. In another group of unilaterally nephrectomized rabbits, cardiovascular responsiveness to norepinephrine was determined. A unilateral nephrectomy increased the activity of TH in the midmedulla, a brain region important in the baroreflex regulation of blood pressure, and in the adrenal gland, the major source of circulating catecholamines. The activity of TH was decreased in the pons-upper medulla region. No alterations were found in the proximal and distal mesenteric arteries, lower medulla, midbrain or hypothalamus. No alteration in blood pressure or cardiovascular responsiveness to norepinephrine was found. This study indicates that a unilateral nephrectomy produces long-lasting effects on central catecholaminergic neurons and the sympathetic nervous system without an effect on blood pressure or cardiovascular responsiveness.\r"

A third group received MP plus the angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibitor (CEI) benzazepril. A fourth group received CEI alone. Half of the rats in each group underwent micropuncture study 2 weeks after ablation. Untreated rats exhibited systemic hypertension and elevation of the single nephron glomerular filtration rate (SNGFR), due to glomerular capillary hyperperfusion and hypertension. Administration of MP resulted in comparable systemic hypertension with further elevation of SNGFR due to even higher values for glomerular perfusion and hydraulic pressure (PGC). Concurrent treatment with CEI-controlled systemic and glomerular hypertension despite equivalent renal ablation and comparable doses of MP. After 12 weeks untreated rats demonstrated continued systemic hypertension, progressive proteinuria, and eventual glomerular sclerosis. Addition of MP dramatically accelerated the development of proteinuria and glomerular sclerosis, while CEI afforded striking protection against disease progression. Thus, potent vasodilator glucocorticoids may amplify hemodynamically mediated glomerular injury, whereas control of systemic and glomerular hypertension prevents this undesirable consequence of chronic steroid therapy.\r"

Fifteen SHRs and 17 Wistar Kyoto rats (WKY) were randomized at 4 weeks of age to three diets varying in Ca2+ and Na+: 2% Ca2+/1.0% Na+, 1% Ca2+/0.45% Na+, and 0.1% Ca2+/0.25% Na+. At 15 weeks of age, blood pressure, body weight, and body composition were determined. Significant differences in body weight, blood pressure, and total body fat were observed between diet groups in both strains. Dietary Ca2+ and Na+ induced favorable changes in total body fat content in both the SHR and WKY.\r"

To increase the ability of the kidney to excrete salt and water, we infused acetylcholine (ACH, 2.0 micrograms/kg/min), a potent natriuretic agen, directly into the renal artery. In four dogs, ACH decreased mean arterial pressure (MAP) from 144 +/- 5 mm Hg to 113 +/- 3 mm Hg. Sodium excretion increased by about 60% on the first day of infusion and then returned rapidly toward the control value. On cessation of the ACH infusion, there was a transient but marked sodium retention, and the hypertension returned. A control infusion of ACH intravenously rather than into the renal artery in the same four dogs did not affect MAP or sodium excretion during AngII hypertension.\r"

The patient with least renal mass on presentation had evidence of declining renal function at 60 months.

ET consisted of 20 to 30 minutes of aerobic activity three times weekly for 12 months. The study group comprised 17 males and three females (mean age 58 years, range 40 to 71 years). Blood pressure was evaluated at rest and during exercise after 6 and 12 months ET. A training effect was documented by an increase in functional capacity from 7.5 METs (1 MET = 3.5 mL oxygen consumption/kg/min) pre-ET to 8.8 and 9.2 METs after 6 and 12 months, respectively. The following significant (P less than 0.05) effects occurred on blood pressure in association with ET: resting systolic pressure pre-ET decreased from 131 to 124 mm Hg at 12 months ET; submaximal (50% pre-ET maximum capacity) systolic and diastolic pressures decreased from 150/84 to 142/80 mm Hg (6 months ET) and 144/80 mm Hg (12 months ET); diastolic pressure at maximal exertion fell from 83 to 77 mm Hg (6 months ET) and 78 mm Hg (12 months ET). Systolic blood pressure at maximal exertion was not increased despite significant increases in peak workload achieved at 6 and 12 months ET. Therefore, ET not only enhances functional capacity in cardiac patients but may be associated with a beneficial cardiac effect through attenuation of both rest and exertional blood pressure.\r"

Diameter of 3.5 Fr and 5 Fr catheters was determined by experimental measurement of catheter flow-pressure drop relationship with known equations for fluid flow. Physical measurements verified the accuracy of the calculated diameters. These diameters were then used in a mathematical simulation to describe blood flow through an entire neonatal CAVH system and predict clinical performance. Catheters of 5 Fr caliber had a 39% variation in diameter among manufacturers, resulting in a 370% variation in blood flows; 3.5 Fr catheters had a 29% variation in internal diameter with a corresponding blood flow variation of 290%. Computer simulation of a neonatal CAVH system revealed a maximum blood flow of 0.8-3.0 ml/min with available 5 Fr catheters. This wide variation is probably responsible for the lack of consistent results in neonatal CAVH systems to date.\r"

We studied 22 patients who survived cardiac operations by the use of circulatory support devices. Their ages ranged from 3 days to 69 years at the time of device support. Operations performed were coronary artery bypass (9 pts), valve replacement (4 pts), congenital defect correction (8 pts), and cardiac transplantation (1 pt). Ten patients were supported with a Pierce-Donachy ventricular assist device (VAD) (left 4, right 3, both 3), nine with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), and three with centrifugal pumps (left 2, both 1). Duration of support ranged from 22 to 189 hours (mean 84.4). There were four late deaths; two of the deaths were cardiac-related within 6 months and two were due to cancer at 46 and 53 months following discharge. The remaining 18 survivors were followed for 6 to 74 months (mean 29.9). Prior to operation three of the patients were New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class I, eight were Class II, six patients were Class III, and five were Class IV. Following discharge from the hospital 13 patients were Class I, two were Class II, and three were Class III; no patients were Class IV. Five patients work full-time, three are retired without limitation, four attend school, and three are pre-school. Only three patients suffer from moderate cardiac disability. These data suggest that patients surviving mechanical circulatory assistance for postoperative cardiogenic shock have an excellent chance for functional recovery.\r"

Myocardial recovery was determined by daily measurements of \"pump on/pump off\" parameters, and the data from seven LVAD patients (64%) and three RVAD patients (50%) whose hearts recovered were compared to the data from those whose did not. Additionally, data from the five patients (71%) weaned from biventricular support were compared to those weaned from only a single LVAD or RVAD. In this study, daily pump on/pump off hemodynamic measurements were found to be predictive of success for weaning patients from VADs. The most significant predictors were increases in mixed venous oxygen saturation, cardiac index, mean arterial pressure and ventricular ejection fraction, as well as decreases in atrial pressures. Seventy percent of the patients weaned from VADs survived, indicating that patients appropriately weaned from VAD support have a reasonable chance of survival.\r"

This represents almost all infants treated with ECMO between 1980 and 1987. Eighty-one percent of the patients survived. This result is statistically significantly better than any other treatment which produces less than 78.4% survival. The most common diagnoses were meconium aspiration (310 patients, 91% survived), respiratory distress syndrome (96 patients, 78% survived), diaphragmatic hernia (121 patients, 65% survived), and sepsis (64 patients, 72% survived). Average pre-ECMO characteristics were: age 59 hours; PaO2 42 torr, PaCO2 41 torr, pH 7.40; ventilator settings FiO2 1.0, pressure 45/4 cmH2O, rate 93. Technical complications occurred in 23.1%, and physiologic complications occurred in 65.6%. Results improved with experience. Survival rate for the first ten patients from each center was 73.5% compared to 83.7% for all subsequent patients. Survival rate did not, however, significantly differ after an institutional experience of 20 patients. These observations were made on a large cohort that could not be accumulated at an individual center. These results indicate that ECMO and lung rest is appropriate and successful treatment for newborn respiratory failure unresponsive to other means of management, and that almost all respiratory failure is reversible in near-term neonates.\r"

  ".W": "The National CAPD Registry has noted encouraging trends in CAPD therapy in the U.S. Recently, trained patients have reported lower peritonitis rates, fewer days hospitalized for dialysis-related events, and lower probability of developing a first episode of a complication. If accumulating experience, better patient selection, and new technologic developments further these trends, then the relatively high transfer rates should begin to decrease since many transfers are related to peritonitis and other complications. The Registry's observations suggest that CAPD is an evolving therapy and that as complication rates and transfer rates decrease, CAPD may play an even greater role in the treatment of patients with end-stage renal disease.\r"

To find how much intravascular laser energy can be delivered via a 100 microns core optical fibre passed down a balloon angioplasty catheter without causing angiographic abnormalities up to 10 days later, argon laser energy was delivered percutaneously under radiographic screening to the coronary circulation of 12 normal closed chest dogs. With the balloon inflated, sequential laser pulses were delivered to the same site. Angiograms were recorded before, immediately, and again at one week, after laser delivery. There were two laser-induced perforations (both fatal). Mechanical perforation with the 100 microns fibre occurred four times, but there were no haemodynamic sequelae. To find the acute perforation threshold of similar sized arteries to energy delivered via the bare 100 microns core fibre, the tip of which was held in contact with the luminal surface, 32 argon laser pulses were delivered transluminally in vivo to separate sites in normal rabbit iliac and canine coronary arteries. The acute perforation threshold with energy delivered via the angioplasty catheter lay between 6 and 10 J and that without the balloon angioplasty catheter lay between 3 and 4 J. After delivery of up to 6 J via a balloon angioplasty catheter, there were no angiographic abnormalities at one week. Fibre optic transluminal delivery of laser energy may improve the primary success rate of, and perhaps widen the indications for, coronary angioplasty.\r"

  ".W": "The haemodynamic effects of an intravenous amiodarone infusion (5 mg/kg for 10 minutes) were measured in ten patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (two with a left ventricular outflow gradient at rest) five, 15, and 30 minutes after drug administration. Mean (SD) pulmonary capillary wedge pressure rose significantly at five and 15 minutes (from 12.3 (6.2) mm Hg to 17.6 (9.2) and to 16.2 (8.6] with a subsequent tendency to fall to control values at 30 minutes. Mean right atrial and right ventricular end diastolic pressures increased from 3.6 (1.8) mm Hg to 7.3 (3.1) and from 6.3 (2.4) to 9.8 (3.2) mm Hg respectively at 30 minutes. The increase in filling pressures was paralleled by a decrease of left ventricular max dP/dt from 1522 (414) to 1372 (327) to 1316 (338) and to 1326 (379) five, 15, and 30 minutes after infusion. Despite this slight negative inotropic effect, cardiac index and stroke volume index were unchanged or slightly increased, possibly because of the decrease in systemic vascular resistance (from 1326 (330) dyn s cm-5/m2 to 1152 (285]. In both patients with outflow gradient the pressure gradient at rest decreased (from 110 to 65 and from 85 to 65 mm Hg) through a reduction of left ventricular systolic pressure. Thus short term intravenous infusion of amiodarone is safe in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The main changes were a mild depression of ventricular contractility, which was well tolerated and adequately compensated for by a decrease in afterload.\r"

All patients had presented with paroxysmal atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia; in addition, six had experienced atrial fibrillation. In 16 patients pre-excitation was overt and in four the accessory pathway was concealed. Intraoperative epicardial and endocardial mapping showed 10 left free wall pathways, seven septal pathways, and four right free wall pathways. One patient had two right free wall accessory pathways. There was one postoperative death (from a ruptured cerebral haemangioma) and one patient had transient hemiparesis. There was early recurrence of arrhythmia or pre-excitation in six patients and five of these were among the first ten in the series. Four of the six underwent successful reoperation; 17 patients remain symptom free of all antiarrhythmic treatment. Two patients did not undergo reoperation--one became symptom free on drugs that had previously been ineffective and the other received an antitachycardia pacemaker. The mean period of follow up was six years. Accessory pathway function was not restored and atrioventricular nodal function was preserved in all patients, demonstrating the feasibility of this technique in the long term management of patients with the pre-excitation syndrome.\r"

Fifteen also had right heart catheterisation and oximetric measurement of the shunt. For the nuclear technique 740 MBq (20 mCi) of technetium-99m pertechnetate was injected into the right antecubital vein and the pulmonary to systemic flow ratio (QP:QS) was measured by the gamma variate technique. Data were not obtained in four patients because the nuclear probe failed in three patients and one storage disc was corrupted. Data from the gamma camera were lost in another patient. When the size of the shunt measured by the nuclear probe was compared with that measured by the oximetric technique the mean difference (SD of mean difference) was 0.36 (SD 0.78) and when it was compared with the gamma camera it was 0.08 (SD 0.67). Analysis of scatter plots showed that the larger the shunt, the larger the discrepancy. Twenty four of 29 data sets showed complete agreement between the nuclear probe and gamma camera on the size of the shunt. Any differences were small. These data indicate that left to right intracardiac shunts may be measured accurately by a nuclear probe at the bedside in either the coronary care unit or outpatient department.\r"

Actuarial analysis showed a survival at five years of 79.1% (25 deaths in 130 patients). Half the deaths occurred within a month of operation and half up to five years later. Operation under the age of three months carried a greater mortality (six deaths in 11 patients). Statistical analysis showed that these survival figures were consistent throughout the series and did not alter with the year of operation. In the light of recent trends in treatment of this lesion, it is concluded that for neonates an arterial switch procedure is now likely to carry the best chance of long term success. For the patient who presents after the age of three months, however, there may still be a place for the Mustard procedure.\r"

  ".U": "88222120\r", 
  ".W": "To gain a better understanding of the anatomy of doubly committed subarterial defects and its relation to findings at cross sectional echocardiography and angiocardiography, eight necropsy specimens from patients with this condition were examined, and preoperative echocardiograms and angiocardiograms from 313 patients with surgically or necropsy confirmed outlet defect were reviewed. Of these, 48 had doubly committed subarterial defects. Morphological review showed that doubly committed defects are roofed by the arterial valves in fibrous continuity because of lack of both the outlet septum and the \"septal\" aspect of the subpulmonary infundibulum. Angiocardiography had a lower sensitivity (50%) than echocardiography (95%) for diagnosis of doubly committed defects, but each was highly specific. In five (14%) of 35 available echocardiograms the arterial valves were normally offset, but in the remainder they were at the same level. The ventriculoarterial connection was concordant in 37/48 (77%), discordant in five (10%) of 48, and double outlet right ventricle in six (13%) of 48. Displacement of the fibrous raphe between the arterial valves in relation to the ventricular septum below was associated with outflow obstruction in 14 patients (pulmonary in nine and aortic in five). These features were readily identified by echocardiography. Thus echocardiography is not only a more accurate method than angiocardiography of recognising these defects, but also shows that the arterial pole of the heart is architecturally abnormal.\r"

Lung morphology was examined by light microscopy and assessed quantitatively. In this selected group of patients (a) medial muscle thickness of greater than 20% in the intra-acinar arteries and Heath-Edwards changes of I or II were significantly associated with perioperative death from pulmonary complications after cardiac surgery; (b) children with lower percentage medial muscle thickness had a higher baseline resistance (r = -0.84) associated with Heath-Edwards grade III or higher changes (most of these patients were not offered corrective surgery); (c) when the lowest pulmonary vascular resistance was less than 3 units, Heath-Edwards grading was I or II (n = 4). When the pulmonary vascular resistance was greater than 6 units, however, there was no direct correlation with Heath-Edwards grading (n = 9). Four patients with a resistance of greater than 6 units had only grade I or II changes. Three had a medial muscle thickness above 20%, and were among those who died at or soon after operation. It is concluded that (a) patients with a lowest pulmonary vascular resistance of greater than 6 units have a bad prognosis whatever their lung morphology; and (b) some patients with Heath-Edwards grade I or II will have a high resistance (this group has a high medial muscle mass and a poor prognosis and would not be detected by Heath-Edwards grading alone).\r"

Moreover, the tachycardia coupling intervals varied directly with the cycle length of the initiating drive. Procainamide and propranolol did not suppress tachycardia, but verapamil terminated it and prevented its reinitiation. The origin of the tachycardia was localised to the left ventricular inferoapical segment and four direct current countershocks of 200 J each delivered via an electrode catheter abolished the tachycardia. During 12 months of follow up the patient was not treated with antiarrhythmic agents and the tachycardia did not recur.\r"

Women seeking therapeutic abortion of pregnancy (less than or equal to 56 days amenorrhoea) were allocated to one of four treatment groups: (1) vacuum aspiration (n = 28); (2) 1 mg vaginal pessary of a prostaglandin analogue (gemeprost) every 3 h for up to 5 pessaries (n = 30); (3) the antigestogen (RU 486--mefipristone) 150 mg per day for 4 days by mouth (n = 20); (4) RU 486 in the same dose as group 3 together with 1 mg gemeprost on day 3 (n = 19). Complete abortion occurred more often in women treated with vacuum aspiration (96%), gemeprost alone (97%) and RU 486 plus gemeprost (95%) than in those treated with RU 486 alone (60%). In women receiving up to five gemeprost pessaries alone vomiting occurred in 7 (23%) and diarrhoea in 10 (33%); 16 (53%) required parenteral opiates for relief of pain. Side-effects and analgesic requirements were much reduced in the women who received RU 486 alone or in combination with a single gemeprost pessary. There was no difference in the number of days of vaginal bleeding after abortion between the four groups although there was wide individual variation (mean 10 days, range 1-34). These results confirm that medical induction of abortion in early pregnancy with prostaglandin vaginal pessaries is as effective as vacuum aspiration and that the dose can be reduced five-fold without loss of efficacy when used in combination with RU 486.\r"

Of these 229 preterm caesarean sections 41% were elective, 21% were for antepartum haemorrhage and 38% took place during labour. Of the 254 babies born 18 (7%) died in the neonatal period. These deaths comprised 31% of all neonatal deaths during the study period in this hospital. The neonatal death rate was 70% for babies weighing less than 1000 g (7 of 10) and 23% for babies weighing 1000-1500 g (6 of 26), but only 3% for babies heavier than this (7 of 217). Of the 75 women with a subsequent pregnancy after the preterm caesarean section 56% were again delivered by caesarean section. In view of the maternal morbidity associated with caesarean section and the poor neonatal outcome at birthweights of less than 1500 g, the use of operative delivery for very low birthweight infants deserves further scrutiny.\r"

ADP induced a transient [Ca2+]i peak of 1 to 2 mumol/L near 2 seconds, whereas thrombin caused a sustained and larger response. The first phase (less than 2 seconds) was not influenced by a lack of extracellular Ca2+, in contrast to the subsequent [Ca2+]i increase that only reached about 0.7 mumol/L for either ADP or thrombin. The shear rates used in our continuous-flow apparatus were physiological (less than 1,258 sec-1) and only slightly increased the basal [Ca2+]i of 0.1 mumol/L.

  ".W": "The interaction of the multifunctional S protein (vitronectin) with cultured human endothelial cells of macrovascular and microvascular origin was investigated. Purified S protein, coated on polystyrene Petri dishes, induced dose-dependent and time-dependent attachment and spreading of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) as well as human omental tissue microvascular endothelial cells (HOTMECs) at 37 degrees C. Not only isolated S protein, but also the ternary S protein-thrombin-antithrombin III (STAT) complex promoted attachment of approximately 90% of the cells within 2 hours at an S protein concentration of 0.13 mumol/L. Inhibition of attachment in these experiments was achieved by the addition of the cell-attachment pentapeptide Gly-Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser and by monospecific antibodies against S protein, whereas nonrelated peptides or antibodies against fibronectin, fibrinogen, or von Willebrand factor (vWF) were ineffective. Direct binding of S protein to HUVECs and HOTMECs was studied with cells in suspension at a density of 1 x 10(6) cells/mL and was maximal after 120 minutes. S protein bound to both cell types in a dose-dependent fashion with an estimated dissociation constant Kd = 0.2 mumol/L. At a 200-fold to 500-fold molar excess of unlabeled S protein, greater than 80% of bound radiolabeled S protein was displaceable, whereas binding was reduced to 30% to 50% by addition of the pentapeptide, the STAT complex, or by physiologic concentrations of fibrinogen or vWF as well as Fab fragments of anti(human S protein)IgG, but not by Fab rabbit IgG. These findings present evidence for the specific association of S protein with endothelial cells ultimately leading to attachment and spreading of cells. Moreover, a novel function for the ternary STAT complex, which induced endothelial cell attachment and spreading virtually identical to free S protein, is described. These data further suggest a possible role for S protein during coagulation as major vessel wall-related adhesive protein at sites of vascular injury.\r"

Abnormal metaphases were obtained in 18 cases. The most common breakpoints were in 11q23, 14q32, 6q11-21, and 8q22-24. These are common breakpoints in lymphoma and raise the possibility that the malignant cell in Hodgkin's disease may be derived from a lymphocyte. The 11q23 breakpoint is also seen in t(4;11) and t(9;11), which is typical of a type of childhood B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia characterized by the presence of aberrant myeloid and monocytic markers. Myeloid and monocytic markers are common in Reed-Sternberg cells.\r"

While the effects of these lectins on cell function are presumably mediated by interaction with cell-surface molecules, the target structures on the cell surface involved are not well defined. We have used the techniques of lactoperoxidase catalyzed cell-surface iodination, lectin affinity chromatography, monoclonal antibody immunoprecipitation, and NaDodSO4-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis to study the surface proteins of human neutrophils and alveolar macrophages that react with six lectins including Con A and WGA. We found that several major surface-labeled proteins of neutrophils bound Con A. Four of these proteins were identified by immunoprecipitation as members of the LFA-1/HMac-1/gp150,95 adhesion glycoprotein family. Con A also bound CR1 and a 135-kd surface-labeled protein recognized by CD15 monoclonal antibodies. WGA also bound many of these proteins, but had a much lower avidity for CR1. All three of the major surface-labeled proteins of human alveolar macrophages bound to Con A, including the 183-kd mannose receptor and the 30-kd smoking-associated protein. WGA also bound the 183-kd macrophage protein, but not the 30-kd protein. These results should aid the understanding of studies using these lectins as stimuli.\r"

Derivatives with a wide range of retention of activities were prepared by varying the concentration and species of activated PEG. The specific activities of the PEG-rt-PA derivatives were dependent on the method of assay. Assays using preformed fibrin gave higher estimates of retention of activity than assays using soluble components. Plasma elimination studies in mice and rats indicated prolonged circulating lifetimes for the radiolabeled PEG-rt-PA derivatives after a rapid clearance and distribution phase; however, the disappearance of functional activity was much more rapid than the disappearance of radiolabeled material. The PEG-rt-PA derivatives appeared to accumulate in tissues above their interstitial fluid concentrations and were rapidly inactivated, apparently by reaction with the plasma protease inhibitors. These results were consistent with the inactivation of the PEG-rt-PA derivatives in rat plasma in vitro. A somewhat longer half-life (t1/2) of the one derivative studied was observed in dogs (t1/2, 16 minutes) as compared with the rat (t1/2, five minutes). This was sufficient to confer thrombolytic activity upon the derivative (administered by bolus injection) in contrast to native rt-PA. The potential of PEG-modified rt-PA as a long-lived thrombolytic agent in humans will depend, however, on whether there will be a further extension of the t1/2 because of a reduction in clearance and/or a reduction in the rate of inactivation.\r"

If so, the depletion or damage of such cells could result in apparent clonal dominance. To test this hypothesis, dimethylbusulfan [2 to 4 mg/kg intravenously (IV) x 3] was given to cats heterozygous for the X-linked enzyme glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G-6-PD). These cats were the daughters of domestic X Geoffroy parents. After the initial drug-induced cytopenias (2 to 4 weeks), peripheral blood counts and the numbers of marrow progenitors detected in culture remained normal, although the percentages of erythroid burst-forming cells (BFU-E) and granulocyte/macrophage colony-forming cells (CFU-GM) in DNA synthesis increased, as determined by the tritiated thymidine suicide technique. In three of six cats treated, a dominance of Geoffroy-type G-6-PD emerged among the progenitor cells, granulocytes, and RBCs. These skewed ratios of domestic to Geoffroy-type G-6-PD have persisted greater than 3 years. No changes in cell cycle kinetics or G-6-PD phenotypes were noted in similar studies in six control cats. These data suggest that clonal evolution may reflect the depletion or damage of normal stem cells and not only the preferential growth and dominance of neoplastic cells.\r"

The guinea pig megakaryocyte enzyme appears to be factor XIIIa since the FV-crosslinking activity (1) had an absolute requirement for Ca++, (2) was completely inhibited by iodoacetamide, 5,5'-dithiobis- (2-nitrobenzoic acid), p-chloromercuribenzene sulfonic acid, and N-ethylmaleimide, all known alkylators of the thiol group at the active site of the factor XIIIa, (3) was blocked by known pseudoamine donor substrates of factor XIIIa including dansylcadaverine and putrescine, and (4) could be directly demonstrated in the guinea pig megakaryocyte lysate by a specific activity staining procedure. No tranglutaminase was detected in guinea pig megakaryocytes in contrast to red cells and liver. A similar pattern of covalent crosslinking of human FV by purified activated human plasma factor XIII was also demonstrated. Analysis of the crosslinked products of FV formed by the guinea pig enzyme by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) indicates the formation of intermediate as well as higher molecular weight polymers, suggesting that the crosslinking is a stepwise polymerization process.\r"

In contrast, human ADA enzyme activity was readily detected in progenitor colonies derived from immortalized multipotent factor-dependent cells. The level of human enzyme was near endogenous murine enzyme levels and was equivalent in undifferentiated stem cells and differentiated myeloid, erythroid, and mixed colonies. These results indicate that cellular properties other than the stage of differentiation are important in determining the expression of foreign sequences introduced by retroviruses. Cell lines that are immortalized but still capable of induced differentiation may contain factors that abrogate blocks to expression that are manifested in primary hematopoietic stem cells.\r"

The extra 18q- chromosome, found in six of ten patients with complex karyotypes, was the most common change subsequent to a t(14;18)(q32;q21) chromosome translocation. The additional change was interpreted as being a duplication of an 18q- derived from a t(14;18). The six patients had transformed histology of follicular small cleaved cell lymphoma or diffuse large cell lymphoma, and five of them had extranodal expansion associated with a poor prognosis. These findings indicate that the extra 18q-, together with other chromosome abnormalities, is closely associated with the advanced grade disease of t(14;18)-positive lymphoma, and the extra chromosome is evolutionally comparable with the second Philadelphia (Ph1) chromosome often found in the blastic phase of chronic myelocytic leukemia carrying a t(9;22)(q34;q11). In addition, since the extra 18q- is rarely found in American patients with t(14;18)-positive lymphoma, there appears to be a difference in the karyotype evolution between Japanese and American patients.\r"

It has been proposed that testing for HIV-related antigen may be a necessary procedure to detect such individuals. To address this issue, we longitudinally studied two groups of homosexual men: direct sexual partners of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) or AIDS-related complex (ARC) patients and individuals who ultimately sero-converted. There was no evidence of prolonged infection with HIV in the absence of detectable antibody in these two groups. It appears at this time that, even among subjects at very high risk for HIV infection, currently available antibody-based assays are sufficient to identify infected individuals.\r"

  ".U": "88222418\r", 
  ".W": "Sickle hemoglobin is relatively unstable upon oxidation or mechanical shaking. During denaturation, it generates oxygen radicals and hemichromes and ultimately precipitates in the form of micro-Heinz bodies. It is not clear, however, whether the degradation product hemin, which is a potent hemolytic agent and a potential perturbant to protein-protein interactions in the red cell membrane skeleton, is also generated during sickle hemoglobin denaturation. By specific absorption of hemin with Dowex AG 1-X8 anion-exchange resin at high-ionic strength conditions, we now separate hemin for quantitation from the bulk hemoglobin and its derivatives. We demonstrate that upon mechanical shaking oxyhemoglobin S denatures much faster than oxyhemoglobin A and that a considerably higher level of hemin is detected in the shaken hemoglobin S as compared with hemoglobin A. By using the same method to measure the hemin content in the hemolysate of fresh red cells from patients with sickle cell disease, we detect a three- to fivefold increase in the hemin content in these patients (0.4 to 0.75 mumol/L) as compared with normal individuals (0.1 to 0.15 mumol/L). These data suggest that the instability of sickle oxyhemoglobin leads to increased intracellular precipitation of hemoglobin and the release of hemin, which may play a role in the membrane lesion of sickle red cells.\r"

Typical signs of diabetic osteopathy on radiography were found in 10 subjects (37%), the degree of radiographic abnormality correlating with the severity of neurological impairment. Furthermore, all diabetics with evidence of severe neuropathy showed some evidence of osteopathy on foot radiographs. In all 10 cases of diabetic osteopathy diagnosed radiographically, abnormalities were shown on scintigraphy. In addition, five other patients showed scintigraphic abnormalities, without corresponding changes on radiography, and in this group the neurological impairment was less severe. Although confirmatory longitudinal studies are necessary, it seems likely that the earliest changes of diabetic neuropathic osteopathy may thus be recognized on bone scintigraphy, at a time when conventional radiographs are normal. This stage of diabetic osteopathy is associated with a lesser degree of neurological impairment.\r"

The plasma leukotriene C4 level was measured before and 30 s and 3 min after the administration of the respective contrast media. In patients demonstrating non-idiosyncratic contrast reactions, a consistent decrease in plasma leukotriene concentration was noted at both 30 s and 3 min following the administration of all three contrast media. A statistically significant decrease in plasma leukotriene occurred at 30 s with ioxaglate, but not with the other two agents. In the limited number of patients who experienced idiosyncratic reactions, the decrease in plasma leukotriene concentration was less apparent. This decrease in plasma leukotriene concentration has been attributed to changes in plasma volume following administration of hyperosmolar contrast media. The inability to demonstrate an increase in plasma leukotriene levels following the administration of both conventional and new, low-osmolar radiographic contrast media supports the cumulative evidence against an allergic mechanism in the majority of non-idiosyncratic and some idiosyncratic contrast reactions.\r"

Mice inoculated with 10(5) cells would die on about Day 9 with disseminated tumour if untreated. Irradiation with acute 60Co or low-dose-rate 252Cf total-body irradiation increased the mean survival time (MST). For 252Cf the MST increased linearly with dose, the effectiveness being independent of the day of irradiation. For 60Co, the MST increased linearly with dose for the tumours irradiated on Days 1-3 but two-component curves were noted after irradiation on Days 5-7. Tumour response showed an increasing photon-resistant component which gave no increase in MST with dose. The RBE was approximately 4 for the early tumours but was greater than 5 for the advanced and more photon-resistant tumours. 252Cf was effective for the treatment of early or advanced stages but was especially effective against the advanced, more radioresistant tumours.\r"

On admission Tr measured 2-6h after the burn, ranged from 36.5 to 39.0 degrees C and 19 children had temperatures greater than 37.5 degrees C; the upper limit of the normal range for healthy children. Patients 5-12 months old had the lowest Tr during the early period. During the first 12 h Tr rose rapidly and 27 patients (67 per cent) had a fever (Tr greater than 38.5 degrees C). In 10 children Tr was greater than 40.0 degrees C. There was no relationship between the rise in Tr and the sex of the patient, the ambient temperature, the size, site or type of burn. Age was the most important variable, particularly during the first 12 h, where a positive correlation between Tr and age occurred in patients aged 5-23 months (P less than 0.01, r = 0.53). Throughout the first 48 h Tr remained elevated. Tthigh closely followed the pattern of Tr, but Ttoe varied considerably, reflecting cardiovascular as well as thermoregulatory responses.\r"

It is likely that autotoxic mechanisms play an important role in the aetiology of the impaired host defence. One of the primary target systems of autotoxic cell damage is the liver. In the present work oxidative alterations in the microsomal compartment of liver cells have been investigated. It was found that thermal burns are associated with extensive oxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids which can be antagonized by antioxidants such as silibinin.\r"

A review of material from a study made during 1962/3 of 105 burned children confirmed that emphasis, with regard to survival of the most seriously burned children. Of seven children with full thickness injury in excess of 25 per cent BSA burned, four were visited daily by parents and recovered, while of three children who were not visited daily two died and a third became moribund and probably would have died if daily parental visiting had not been reinstated. Of 15 children with full thickness injury between 10 and 24 per cent BSA burned there was virtually no difference in the number of days spent in the children's burns unit for 10 who were visited daily and for five who were not. Plans to centralize specialized burns units may be counterproductive unless they include provision of transport fares as well as accommodation for relatives in order to encourage visiting.\r"

Microbiological cultures were performed on the exudate beneath the plasticized PVC film and then at each dressing change until the burn was healed. Bacterial isolates showed no unexpected organisms and there was no predominant organism to suggest contamination from the plasticized PVC film. Indeed, bacteria were only rarely isolated from the initial exudate (three of 37 burn wounds), and subsequent bacterial cultures did not differ from those normally found in burn wounds. In addition, incorporation of the plasticized PVC film into nutrient broth and agar with Staph, aureus and Ps. aeruginosa did not influence the recovery of these organisms, indicating that plasticized PVC film does not exert any antibacterial effect.\r"

Cerebral angiography revealed stenosis or occlusion of the ipsilateral carotid artery in all cases. The treatment was panretinal photocoagulation (in four cases), cerebrovascular surgery (in three) or both (in six).

  ".W": "We wished to compare the frequency of group-specific (Gc) phenotypes in the general population with that in people with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection to find out whether the Gc protein is a marker for susceptibility to HIV infection. We determined the phenotype frequency in 1083 randomly selected serum samples obtained from the Canadian Influenza Survey Studies and compared it with that in 263 serum samples obtained from the Federal Centre for AIDS and the Syphilis Serology Proficiency Testing Laboratory. No association between Gc phenotype and HIV status was found. However, there was a strong association between the Gc protein 1f/1f phenotype and syphilis.\r"

  ".W": "We investigated a large Old Colony (Chortitza) Mennonite kindred with branches across Canada. Six generations of the kindred were traced. There was intermarriage among numerous family members. Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) was identified in 10 members; all 7 living patients were found to carry the immunogenetic marker HLA-DR4. Nine other close relatives had disorders of carbohydrate metabolism, including gestational diabetes mellitus and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus progressing to insulin use. Ten other relatives had autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis, hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism and multiple sclerosis. Cases of Alport's syndrome, congenital malformations, inborn errors of metabolism and unusual malignant diseases were also found in the kindred. In the small Alberta community in which the kindred was ascertained there were people of Old Colony Mennonite descent with genetic conditions such as Gilles de la Tourette's syndrome and congenital malformations, including congenital heart disease. This kindred represents the largest reported familial aggregation of IDDM. This disease and other disorders of carbohydrate metabolism occur in the context of a strong familial predisposition to autoimmune disease. Study of this family may permit empiric testing of proposed models of inheritance of diseases of complex origin such as IDDM. We report this Old Colony (Chortitza) Mennonite community because it is one of the settlements populated by this religious and genetic isolate, which extends across Canada and Central and South America and affords opportunities for the study of both common and rare inherited diseases.\r"
