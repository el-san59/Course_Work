  ".W": "A simple, rapid, and highly reproducible procedure for flow cytometric DNA analysis has been adapted for studying cell cycle kinetics in epidermal cell cultures. The preparation of cell nuclei and their staining with the fluorescent dye propidium iodide were performed directly on the culture dish, without prior suspension and fixation of the cells. Singly dispersed nuclei were produced by mild trypsinization of cells in the presence of the nonionic detergent Nonidet P-40 and spermine. The culture dishes could be kept frozen for prolonged periods of time before trypsinization and staining, without affecting either the recovery of nuclei or the cell cycle distribution profiles. This remarkable stability of cell nuclei greatly simplified the analysis of multiple samples in cell cycle kinetic studies. This method was used to analyze the cell cycle distribution in cultures of normal and transformed mouse epidermal cells, human colon carcinoma cells, primary bovine aortic endothelial cells, and fibroblastic and myogenic cell lines. This procedure should be very useful in studying growth kinetics, differentiation, and transformation of epidermal as well as other adherent cell types.\r"

  ".U": "88229223\r", 
  ".W": "To study the possibility that the state of proliferation of epidermal keratinocytes can influence the action of retinoids, the rate of proliferation of murine epidermal keratinocytes was manipulated by growing the cells in media containing high or low concentrations of Ca++. In contrast to what other investigators have reported, keratinocytes cultured in medium containing 1.4 mM Ca++ proliferate faster, instead of slower, than cells cultured in medium with 0.09 mM Ca++. Other experiments showed that Ca++ was stimulatory to keratinocytes in medium containing a low level of growth factors, and inhibitory in medium containing a high level of growth factors, suggesting that the discrepancy could be due to a difference in the sera used. The high Ca++ cells prominently expressed the 48kD/56kD pair of keratin, showing that they were in a hyperproliferative state. Exposure of the faster growing high Ca++ cells to all-trans retinoic acid, 13-cis retinoic acid, etretinate, etretin, and arotinoid ethyl ester caused dose-dependent inhibition of DNA synthesis. In contrast, exposure of the slower growing low Ca++ cells to these retinoids resulted in dose-dependent stimulation of DNA synthesis. In addition, all-trans retinoic acid caused dose-related increases in cell number in the low Ca++ cultures. These findings correlate with the reported differential effects of retinoids on normal and hyperproliferative epidermis, and suggest that Ca++ and low growth factor-regulated keratinocyte cultures are useful for studying the mechanism of hyperproliferation and retinoid actions.\r"

  ".W": "The uptake and retention of 14C-thiouracil and 125I-thiouracil in small lung metastases of B16 murine melanoma was studied in beige mice injected intravenously with melanoma cells. By impulse counting of excised tumor and organ pieces, a high concentration of radioactivity was found in the lung metastases, as compared to normal tissues. The highest tumor/organ concentration ratios appeared 24 h after injection of the radiolabeled thiouracil. A separate autoradiographic study on the disposition of 14C-thiouracil in mice with melanoma metastases confirmed the impulse counting results and also showed the absence of any other site of retention of radioactivity except for hair follicles and to some extent the thyroid. The selective uptake of 14C- and 125I-thiouracil in melanomas depends on their acceptance as false melanin precursors, making them specific markers for growing melanin. The results indicate that radiolabeled thiouracil may be useful for clinical diagnosis and, possibly, therapy of malignant melanotic melanomas.\r"

The careful choice of these parameters can result in confining laser injury to specific targets in tissue. Spotsize, a parameter not commonly appreciated in the application of lasers to medicine and surgery, has been shown, in this study, to contribute to the ultimate outcome of laser effects in tissue. A series of histological events occurring in the skin are demonstrated to be directly related to the effects of spotsize on tissue at a fixed exposure time and wavelength. Many of these changes could contribute to unwanted adverse effects, such as scarring, which occur following certain laser therapies.\r"

Case-HHs were more likely than either control group to have members 12-18 y of age (P less than .01); these individuals accounted for 34% of all primary cases. A history of exposure outside the home was the most important predictor of community-acquired infection (P less than .001), with adolescents being at higher risk than other age-groups (odds ratio, 3.2; P less than .001). After known exposure to a culture-positive case in the same HH, the risk of illness was unrelated to age; lengthy delays in initiating erythromycin therapy and prophylaxis were the only factors associated with secondary spread (P less than .01). The risk of pertussis may be related more to the likelihood of exposure than to age-related increases in susceptibility, and the risk can be reduced with appropriate use of erythromycin.\r"

There was no significant difference in the GMs of the total, IgG, or IgG1 antibody concentrations in postimmunization sera from subjects positive versus those negative for G2m(23). Adults positive for G2m(23) had a GM IgG2 concentration more than threefold higher than that of negative subjects (P less than .001). The antibody responses of 61 Amish adults immunized with type b polysaccharide vaccine were also analyzed. Those adults positive for G2m(23) had a higher GM serum IgG2 response to capsule than did those who were negative (P less than .01).

To provide a possible explanation for the frequent association of these two traits, we exposed penicillin-susceptible pneumococci to two kinds of antibiotic pressures in the laboratory. Treatment of cultures with cycles of high concentrations of penicillin (20 X MIC) followed by growth of the survivors in drug-free medium selected for lysis-defective mutants that died only slowly during antibiotic treatment but had unchanged MICs. Exposure to sustained, low levels of penicillin produced resistant mutants, with elevated MICs, that lysed normally with penicillin. We suggest that the cyclic antibiotic exposure generally used in the clinical setting may select primarily for enhanced survival. From these survivors a second type of antibiotic exposure--sustained antibiotic concentrations just above the MIC (concentrations that may be restricted to the tail-end trough of a dosing interval)--selects for penicillin-resistant mutants.\r"

In one patient, fungemia was accompanied by clinical and laboratory evidence of Broviac catheter infection. During a three-year period, M. pachydermatis was also recovered from fungal cultures of an additional 30 patients, 85% of whom were infants. A pathogenic role for M. pachydermatis recovered from sources other than blood or catheters was not established.

Using autoradiography and the appearance of mitotic figures to detect dividing macrophages, we found that 2.1% +/- 0.2% of synovial fluid macrophages from uninfected goats are dividing and that after infection with CAEV the percentage increases three- to sixfold. The enhanced macrophage division was not associated with increased dividing of blood monoblasts. The amount of macrophage division correlated with two measures of arthritis: joint swelling and the number of synovial fluid macrophages. Induction of an immune response in the joints of CAEV-infected goats increased the number of dividing macrophages. The synovial fluid of infected animals was mitogenic for macrophages from infected animals in amounts that correlated with the amount of macrophage division occurring in the joints. Activated lymphocytes produced nondialyzable lymphokines mitogenic for macrophages from CAEV-infected goats but not from uninfected goats. These results suggest that in situ macrophage division contributes to the lesions induced by CAEV and that infection leads to greater responsiveness of macrophages to mitogenic factors produced by lymphocytes.\r"

Double-blind tests were carried out on sera from 40 patients with well-documented VL, from controls in endemic areas, and from patients with other diseases. Using gp70-2, 36 (90.0%) of 40 sera from patients with kala azar were correctly diagnosed; 1 (1.2%) of 86 sera from patients without kala azar was misdiagnosed. With dp72, 21 (100%) of 21 sera from patients with VL were correctly identified; 5 (7.0%) of 71 negative sera were misdiagnosed. None of the 18 sera from patients with Chagas' disease reacted positively against gp70-2. Our assay is rapid, simple, and specific and represents a new method for reliably diagnosing and monitoring VL.\r"

Incubation of carbon 14-labeled or sulfur 35-labeled gaseous methanethiol resulted in complete trapping of methanethiol by whole blood within 30 minutes. After trapping, both labels were found to be equally distributed over plasma and erythrocytes. Eighty to ninety percent of both labels could be extracted from erythrocytes incubated in saline solution. The chemical properties of the 14C and 35S labels in saline solution differed completely. The 14C label was not precipitated by BaCl2, was moderately volatile, and could be extracted by either (pH 1). In contrast, the 35S label was precipitated by BaCl2, was not volatile, and was not extracted by ether. It is concluded that the central carbon-sulfur bond of methanethiol is split by incubation with whole blood. Plasma components are not involved in this process. Most likely, methanethiol becomes largely oxidized by erythrocytes to formic acid and sulfite or sulfate. Only 10% of methanethiol became firmly bound to erythrocytes. One to two percent was transformed to protein--S--S--CH3 and 1% to dimethyl sulfide by the enzyme thiol methyltransferase.\r"

To localize intracellular iron and to help assess its potential for participation in the production of hydroxyl radicals, macrophages were fractionated and the ferritin and iron contents were measured in various cell fractions. Alveolar macrophages from seven smokers and six nonsmokers were lysed by nitrogen cavitation and centrifuged, first at 500 g and then at 11,000 g. Measured by radio-immunoassay, the total cellular ferritin was 133.8 +/- 33.2 ng and 782.0 +/- 177.8 ng per 1 x 10(6) macrophages (mean +/- SEM, p less than 0.01) obtained from nonsmokers and smokers, respectively. The total cellular iron contents were 7.5 +/- 0.6 nmol and 27.6 +/- 4.8 nmol per 1 x 10(6) macrophages (p less than 0.02) obtained from nonsmokers and smokers, respectively. The accumulation of iron by smokers' alveolar macrophages correlated with the number of cigarettes that had been smoked. Forty-two percent of the iron but only 9% of the ferritin was contained in the pellet obtained from centrifugation at 500 g. The pellet from the second centrifugation contained approximately 33% of the iron and 5% of the ferritin. The supernatant resulting from the second centrifugation contained 25% of the iron and 85% of the ferritin. Cigarette smoking did not appear to alter the intracellular distribution of either iron or ferritin. The ferritin content of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was 0.10 +/- 0.04 micrograms/mg and 0.90 +/- 0.18 micrograms/mg albumin for nonsmokers and smokers, respectively (p less than 0.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

No aggregation occurred in response to adenosine diphosphate, platelet activating factor-acether, a stimulatory antiplatelet monoclonal antibody, or phorbol myristate acetate, although platelet aggregation could be induced with thrombin, the calcium ionophore A23187, or high concentrations of collagen. Shape change, adenosine triphosphate secretion, and the responses of the platelets' protein phosphorylation systems to all agonists were normal. Immunologic analysis of the patient's radiolabeled platelet surface proteins revealed normal levels of glycoproteins IIB and IIIa. However, no iodine 125-fibrinogen binding occurred after stimulation of the patient's platelets with adenosine diphosphate. In contrast, pretreatment of the patient's platelets with the proteolytic enzyme alpha-chymotrypsin resulted in the exposure of active 125I-fibrinogen binding sites. The patient's platelets exhibited normal aggregation to fibrinogen after their pretreatment with chymotrypsin and with elastases derived either from porcine pancreas or from human granulocytes. A murine monoclonal antibody directed against the human platelet membrane glycoproteins IIb and IIIa calcium-dependent epitope and rabbit polyclonal anti-human platelet membrane and human anti-P1A1 antibodies immunoprecipitated glycoproteins IIb and IIIa and a 66 kd cleavage product of glycoprotein IIIa from sodium dodecyl sulfate-Triton X-100 extracts of the patient's proteolytically treated platelets. The patient appears to exhibit a unique type of thrombopathy involving a defect in the exposure of fibrinogen receptors. The association between the neurologic disorder and the platelet defect is still unclear.\r"

  ".W": "Our purpose was to develop methods in humans to determine the fractional synthetic rate (FSR) of plasma pool free cholesterol using the rate of deuterium incorporation from body water. The sensitivity of this method was examined by measuring FSR after periods of fasting and feeding. Five healthy men with normal lipoprotein levels were given a prepared diet containing 40% of calories as fat and a polyunsaturated/saturated fatty acid ratio of 0.25 for 8 days, except for day 7 when they were given only drinking water. Beginning after the supper meal on day 6, they received no food until 8 AM on day 8 when they consumed meals as normal. Over days 7 and 8 the subjects were given prime and constant deuterium oxide orally to maintain body water deuterium enrichment at about 0.05 atom % excess. Plasma samples were obtained at 0 hours (day 7, 8 AM) and at 12, 24, 36, and 48 hours thereafter. Free cholesterol was extracted, purified by thin-layer chromatography, and combusted to water. The water was reduced to H2 and analyzed for deuterium enrichment by isotope ratio mass spectrometry. Analytic precision of this system was determined as 3.5 0/00 (parts per mil) vs Standard Mean Ocean Water. Deuterium enrichment of plasma water for the group during the 48-hour deuterium oxide administration period was 3143 0/00 +/- 310 0/00 (mean +/- SEM). Cholesterol deuterium enrichment for the group during the 12-hour period of fasting (10.9 0/00 +/- 4.1 0/00) was not different from that during feeding (14.2 0/00 +/- 6.2 0/00).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Cat stomachs were maintained in Krebs solution in vitro, and filled with 100 ml isotonic saline solution, isotonic glucose, hypertonic saline solution, hypertonic glucose, or dilute acid. Gastric pressure was constantly monitored; gastric output was collected constantly by a cannula in the proximal or distal duodenum. For all solutions, cumulative gastric output at all times was considerably less with the distal than the proximal cannula position. This difference was almost entirely caused by a smaller fractional gastric output during the first minute of gastric emptying, and by reduced amplitude of the gastric stroke volume with the distal cannula position. Some differences were observed in the gastric emptying rate for the various solutions; isotonic saline solution emptied particularly slowly and hydrochloric acid emptied particularly fast. In addition, the various solutions produced different gastric pressure patterns, which could not be entirely explained by differences in residual gastric volume. We concluded that the cat duodenum provides a resistance to gastric emptying over and above that generated by the pylorus, and that the duodenal resistance is caused by limitations in duodenal capacity. It is furthermore concluded that the mechanical activity of the isolated stomach and duodenum is affected by the chemical composition of their luminal contents.\r"

Ceruloplasmin functions as a ferroxidase that oxidizes iron to the Fe3+ state, thereby preventing Fe2+-catalyzed lipid peroxidation and cellular damage. Despite increased antigenic amounts of ceruloplasmin, cigarette smoker serum has previously been shown to exhibit significantly less antioxidant activity than non-smoker serum. We demonstrate that the decreased antioxidant activity of cigarette smoker serum may be explained by a decrease in ceruloplasmin ferroxidase activity. Smokers had a 14% decrease in serum ceruloplasmin ferroxidase activity (units per milliliter) compared with nonsmokers. There was a 24% decrease in ferroxidase activity per milligram of ceruloplasmin in smokers compared with nonsmokers (0.32 +/- 0.009 U/mg vs 0.42 +/- 0.020 U/mg, p less than 0.005). Smoker serum also contained significantly less ceruloplasmin-specific antioxidant activity than nonsmoker serum. These observations may explain the decrement in smoker serum antioxidant activity that could predispose cigarette smokers to increased oxidant injury.\r"

Sephadex G-75 gel filtration was used to confirm that the 125I-rEp molecule remained iodinated in dog plasma during the 24-hour period of these studies. The plasma disappearance of erythropoietin conformed to a biexponential equation for both nEp and 125I-rEp, with the central compartment being larger than the peripheral compartment. The mean distribution half-life of 75.3 +/- 21.2 minutes for nEp was significantly (p less than 0.05) longer than that of 125I-rEp (23.7 +/- 5.0 minutes) in intact dogs. The intercompartmental clearance (CIic) for nEp (0.018 +/- 0.006 L/kg/hr) was significantly smaller than that of 125I-rEp (0.068 +/- 0.018 L/kg/hr) in intact dogs (p less than 0.05). There were no significant differences in apparent volume of distribution, elimination half-life, and elimination clearance (CIe) for nEp and rEp in intact dogs.

J LAB CLIN MED 1985;106:53). The present study shows that cholesterol transfer from HDLs to VLDLs and LDLs could be increased when the lipoprotein-deficient fraction of control serum was substituted for the patients' fraction. Cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) activity in patient serum was assayed and found to be below that in the serum of control subjects. CETP and CETP inhibitor activities in patient and control sera were separated by hydrophobic chromatography on phenyl-Sepharose. Recovery of CETP activity from patient samples was 214% +/- 62%, and that from controls was 112% +/- 15%. The data indicate that the low RCT of patients was caused by increased levels of an inhibitor to CETP activity in their serum.\r"

Coagulant assays, however, have high coefficients of variation. We previously developed a chromogenic assay for factor XI that required equipment not normally found in a clinical laboratory. We now present a modification of that assay, which is performed in 96-well microplates and can be done in any clinical laboratory or physician's office. Plasma is subjected to a brief acidification to inactivate most of the plasma protease inhibitors. Soybean trypsin inhibitor is included to stabilize the factor XIa that is generated. Kaolin is used as the contact activating surface, and the chromogenic substrate, S-2366, is used to measure the factor XIa that is formed. Results of the assay, performed in three groups of subjects, correlate well with results of the coagulant assay as performed in our laboratory and clearly differentiate between total factor XI deficiency and the deficiency of any of the other contact proteins. Unlike coagulation assays, the chromogenic assay is not influenced by the presence of heparin. Furthermore, it is not affected by lupus anticoagulants, which are antibodies directed against acidic phospholipids. Two plasma samples from patients with acquired factor XI inhibitors showed dissociation between coagulant and amidolytic activity, suggesting that the antibodies were not primarily directed toward the active site of factor XIa, which is responsible for its amidolytic activity. In contrast, patients with severe congenital deficiency of factor XI showed no activity by either assay.\r"

No change was seen in the total sulfhydryl (TSH) and nonprotein sulfhydryl (NPSH) contents of the liver, kidney, and plasma at any dose. The heart TSH level remained unchanged, but the NPSH level was increased from the control value of 16 nmol/mg to 18, 19, and 18 nmol/mg protein at 50, 100, and 200 mg/kg, respectively. The lung TSH and NPSH levels both were increased from the control values of 65 and 8 nmol/mg to 80 and 16 nmol/mg protein, respectively, at 200 mg/kg. The lung TSH level at 400 mg/kg NAC was not changed, but the NPSH level increased to 13.5 nmol/mg protein. The ratio of TSH to NPSH levels in the liver and kidney was 4:1, whereas in the lung and heart it was 7:1 and 8:1, respectively. Based on amount per milligram of protein, TSH and NPSH levels were highest in the liver, followed by the amounts in the kidney, heart, and lung. The lung had the lowest level of TSH and NPSH. The daily treatment with NAC (200 mg/kg) for 13 days after and 2 days before intratracheal injection of bleomycin (7.5 U/kg) had little effect on lung collagen accumulation. The lung collagen level measured as hydroxyproline in bleomycin and in NAC plus bleomycin was significantly increased to 175% and 183% of the control levels, respectively. There was no difference in the lung hydroxyproline content between the control and NAC groups. The histopathology study also revealed no marked difference between the bleomycin and bleomycin plus NAC groups. Alternatively, treatment with NAC (200 mg/kg) for 13 days before bleomycin made the animals more susceptible to bleomycin toxicity and tended to add to the bleomycin-induced accumulation of collagen in the lung. NAC per se caused no mortality at any dose. The lung TSH and NPSH levels in bleomycin-treated (7.5 U/kg) hamsters were increased to 136% and 111% of control, respectively, whereas the TSH and NPSH levels both were increased to 155% of the levels of their respective controls in hamsters in the NAC plus bleomycin group. The differential effects of NAC treatment on the sulfhydryl content of tissues, the treatment's inability to alter the course of bleomycin-induced lung inflammation and collagen accumulation, and the potential for exacerbation of lung toxicity in response to repeated administration of NAC before exposure to fibrogenic agents are discussed.\r"

There appeared to be a delay in the full expression of the depressive effects of octanoic acid and dimethyl disulfide. The resistance to these two toxins, particularly dimethyl disulfide, may reflect the resistance to injury of the oxidative processes prominent in periportal hepatocyte mitochondria. In comparison with pericentral injury or two-lobe hepatectomy, periportal injury seemed equally susceptible to regenerative enzyme inhibition by NH4+ but less susceptible to the effect of octanoic acid and dimethyl disulfide.\r"

During the course of this investigation, a new extraction and cleanup procedure was developed for the gas chromatographic/nitrogen phosphorus detection (GC/NPD) and gas chromatographic/mass spectrometric (GC/MS) analysis of morphine and codeine in urine. A linear response, over a concentration range of 25 to 600 ng/mL, was obtained for codeine and morphine (r = 0.9982 and 0.9947, respectively). The minimum detectable level (LOD) and limit of quantitation (LOQ) for morphine were 10 and 30 ng/mL, respectively; whereas LOD and LOQ for codeine were 2 and 8 ng/mL, respectively. The coefficients of variance (CV, n = 6) for morphine and codeine analyses at the 100-ng/mL level were 13.3 and 4.6%, respectively. This procedure was used for the analysis of urine samples from five poppy seed eaters who each ingested 200 g of poppy seed cake. Results indicated that significant amounts of morphine and codeine are excreted in urine and that in all subjects, at least at one point in time, the apparent morphine concentration as determined by radioimmunoassay (RIA) analysis exceeded the cutoff value (300 ng/mL) established for screening. Thebaine was not detected in urine specimens collected following poppy seeds ingestion and thus could not be used as a marker.\r"

The impressions were recorded and converted into a set of indices which essentially are width-versus-length ratios of prominent features of the human foot. These indices were then correlated to yield probability values for use in this study and for comparison to data published by previous investigators Qamra, Abbott, Lovejoy, Cassidy, and Robbins. Friction ridge minutae were not considered in this study. Crease marks, well impressions, and toe step measurements were considered, but not incorporated in the probability values, because of the unique aspect of these features and the inability, at present, to convert these features to mathematical indices. These features do, however, introduce a subjective nature to the analysis scheme. This study uses the combined index probabilities of foot impressions so that the data generated can be used to assign a given probability that a particular foot impression, even without clear definable individual features, can be linked to the person who made the impression.\r"

We find that these salivary hemagglutinins are present in over 90% of the population and that their titer remains stable over a period of two months. These hemagglutinins can be used to blood type the donor of a saliva sample and can be used in a confirmatory test that complements the commonly used absorption-inhibition test which is used to detect salivary blood group agglutinogens. In preliminary studies we have determined that hemagglutinins can be successfully isolated and analyzed from dried saliva stains.\r"

The results demonstrate that a flak jacket provides adequate protection against low- and mid-velocity projectiles since none of the animals from this group had evidence of internal trauma and because only minor superficial surgical attention would have been required. Survivability in each case was considered to be excellent. The flak jacket failed to provide any protection against several types of high-velocity bullets. These weapons caused severe internal injury to the genitourinary system as well as to other major organ systems. Survival would have been unlikely.\r"

  ".W": "Some recent interpretations of the child abuse laws are creating serious and unprecedented erosions of therapist/patient confidentiality. In contrast to the Tarasoff decisions and laws, the child abuse statutes introduced a new element of mandatory reporting which permits no discretionary alternatives and presents prospects of criminal penalties for failure to report. A recent development suggests a possible requirement for therapists to violate confidentiality for the sole purpose of punishing perpetrators. Overinterpretations of the laws by some child protective services have led to recommendations that long past child abuse must be reported, even when no current child is in danger. The California Attorney General's Office has issued a clarification stating that the child abuse statute refers to children and not to adults molested as children. A survey of forensic psychiatrists and psychologists shows that most perceived an ethical problem in reporting adults molested as children when no child is presently in danger, and the purpose of the report is solely for maximal legal self-protection. The survey indicates that fears induced by rigid and intimidating child abuse laws can influence therapists to act in ways most consider unethical. Recommendations are made for improving the current child abuse laws so that they accomplish their goals more effectively.\r"

Certain pathophysiologic mechanisms of death, rarely encountered in routine forensic science practice, may be important in determining the cause of death in psychiatric patients, especially in cases where the autopsy is unrevealing. Of particular concern is a tendency in the current literature to implicate phenothiazines as a cause of death when the death investigation and the autopsies are incomplete. Thus, based on our experience and on a review of the current literature, we have set forth factors that the forensic pathologist should consider when faced with a sudden psychiatric death. A case report illustrates these unique aspects of scene investigation and analysis of terminal events and autopsy findings.\r"

  ".W": "A total of 89 cases of sharp force suicide that had been committed in the Stockholm area in Sweden from 1972 through 1984 were investigated. The series showed a male preponderance, sex ratio 3.3, and among males a shift towards the age group 40 to 49 years of age. An impact of cultural/ethnic factors was indicated by the overrepresentation of Finnish and Hungarian immigrants. A psychiatric diagnosis had been ascribed in 22 cases, and addiction to drugs or alcohol in 23. Previous attempts at self-destruction were recorded in 11 cases, only 1 of which was by sharp force. Classical indicators of suicidal intent, for example, suicide notes and the presence of hesitation injuries, were found in 28 and 80%, respectively. A preference for certain anatomical locations (throat, precordium, epigastrium, wrists) was confirmed as was the tendency to expose the skin before inflicting suicidal wounds. As compared to homicidal precordial stabs whose entrance wounds usually run vertically, horizontal or upwards/left-slanting stabs are strongly suggestive of suicide. Although cases were encountered where several \"rules of thumb\" concerning homicidal versus suicidal patterns were violated, our series contained no case of injuries to the backside of the trunk and no case of more than one wound piercing the left ventricle of the heart. Multiple chest wounds transecting costal or sternal bone were however not uncommon, and, along with the use of bizarre tools and objects like wood chisels or pieces of glass, illustrated the determination of suicidal intent. Toxicological analysis was positive for drugs in 22 and for alcohol in 27 cases. Blood alcohol levels were roughly similar to those found in victims of homicidal sharp force, whereas drug levels tended to be lower or higher in suicides.\r"

Nine mongrel dogs weighing 17.2 to 28 kg were divided equally into three groups and administered either 0.5, 1.0, or 5.0 mg SCh/kg intravenously into the cephalic vein. Liver, kidney, and gastrocnemius muscle were removed 90 min post-injection and divided into twelve portions. Each portion was treated with embalming fluid, physostigmine, the combination (50/50), or nothing. Chemically treated tissues and nontreated tissues were then stored at either 27, 5, or -20 degrees C for a period of up to forty days. Tissue portions were analyzed using ion-pair extraction, chemical demethylation, and gas chromatography with nitrogen phosphorous detection. Stability of SCh was greatest for samples stored at -20 degrees C and preserved with the combination of embalming fluid plus physostigmine. Kidney concentrations of SCh were significantly higher than those in liver or muscle at all doses. SCh was detected 24 h post-injection in all cases. By 40 days, only trace amounts of SCh, if any, could be detected in samples stored at room temperature with no chemical preservatives.\r"

Three intravenous (i.v.) doses (0.5, 1.0, and 5.0 mg/kg) were compared to study the time course of paralysis and recovery and to describe the relationship of plasma concentration (Cp) and the pharmacologic effects of SCh in canines. The physiologic response to the neuromuscular blocking drug was monitored using train-of-four stimulation of the left sciatic nerve and recording the response of the corresponding gastrocnemius muscle. Time courses for paralysis and recovery were monitored, and the results were used to predict the kinetic values for the pharmacologic effects. Blood samples were taken following drug administration for direct pharmacokinetic estimations. SCh determinations were performed using ion-pair extraction, chemical demethylation, and gas chromatography with nitrogen phosphorous detection. Both kinetic analyses showed the beta half-life for SCh to be approximately 5 min for all doses. SCh has a distribution half-life of less than 1 min. There appears to be a threshold Cp below which neuromuscular function returns. Recovery following SCh induced paralysis had a rapid onset, but the duration of paralysis and the rate of recovery were especially prolonged for the 5.0-mg/kg treatment group.\r"

This is the most numerous group and it can constitute the preliminary stage of any other. 4. Unspecific chronic lesions (UCL) not related to the cause of death, being chronically inflammatory and fibrotic alterations of limited interest in our study. We emphasize the importance of the inflammatory involvement of the alveolar wall in the pathogenia of diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) and the aggravation of pulmonary lesions by capillary structure alteration, direct lesion of alveolar epithelium, presence of macrophages, and liberation of certain intracellular enzymes.\r"

Pulmonary lesions have been classified into four groups. 1. Inflammatory alveolar lesions without a diffuse interstitial involvement (IAL) which result from direct aggressions in subjects of advanced age. 2. Inflammatory alveolar lesions with a diffuse interstitial affectation (IALW) which are more frequent in younger subjects having a higher defense capacity and with severe lesions requiring admission to an intensive care unit. 3. Edemohemorrhagic lesions (EHL) appearing as a precocious lesion at any age. 4. Unspecific chronic lesions (UCL) previous to the aggression and without any relationship to death. The most obvious feature noted was the frequent occurrence of certain types of acute pulmonary lesions indicative of the rapid and extensive capacity of the lung to react to a lesion agent even when death follows rapidly after the aggression. The scarcity of acute interstitial lesions among the older group can be related to a diminution of biological defense activity leading to a less vigorous response; on the contrary, diffuse lesions of the wall seem to be related to an excess of defense mechanisms, determined more by age, severity of lesion, and type of medical assistance received than by a specific type of aggression.\r"

Few techniques, however, are available to assist the criminalist in determining whether an object has been criminally inserted. Glycogenated epithelial cells have been used as a marker for vaginal epithelium, and as such, may indicate vaginal insertion if recovered from an object. This hypothesis was tested by studying orally and vaginally inserted objects from 42 volunteers and 20 rectally inserted objects recovered from cadavers. Glycogen positivity was assayed from smears of object swabbings stained with the periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) technique. More than 75 glycogen positive cells were recovered from 39 of 42 vaginally inserted objects. Glycogenated cells were recovered from 8 of 20 rectally inserted objects (5 with more than 100 positive cells). Of 42 orally inserted objects, 32 also contained glycogen positive cells, but none with more than 28 positive cells. No glycogen positive cells were seen in skin exposed but not inserted objects. Large numbers of glycogen cells were seen in dried saliva drops. Amylase activity was not seen on 5 of 20 orally inserted shields, and thus the possibility of noninsertional saliva contamination could not be ruled out with shields yielding only small numbers of positive cells. Recovery of large numbers of glycogenated cells from foreign objects is strongly suggestive of either vaginal or anal insertion assuming amylase negativity. Glycogen positive cells are not seen secondary to glabrous skin exposure.\r"

It also serves as a warning to those who must deal with the potentially suicidal child abuser.\r"

The alexithymia construct has achieved wide currency in psychosomatic research and theorizing despite its doubtful psychometric foundations. Also, the question of between-group variability in alexithymia has not been addressed. In this study we proposed and tested a Rorschach measure of alexithymia on four groups of psychosomatic patients (back pain, gastrointestinal, dermatology, migraine headache). It was hypothesized that psychosomatic groups would be more alexithymic than nonpatients. To examine the question of between-group variability in alexithymia, it was hypothesized that back pain patients would be more alexithymic than other psychosomatic groups. Both hypotheses were supported. Additionally, exploratory comparisons between psychosomatic groups revealed a number of differences between the groups in basic personality processes. The findings show promise for the use of the Rorschach test as an alexithymia measure. Based on the current study, heterogeneous grouping of psychosomatic patients in research designs and treatment programs appear to be a highly questionable procedure.\r"

Further analysis of 90-150 kDa fractions on sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed five major bands, ranging from 105 kDa to 275 kDa. The antibodies against SE were detected in 52% (58/112) of the MG patients; incidence and titres were higher in the thymoma group (n = 21; 90% and 0.872 respectively) than in the non-thymoma group (n = 91; 43% and 0.200, P less than 0.001). In patients without a thymoma, these antibodies were frequently observed in late-onset disease and the severe generalized form (P less than 0.01). In 4 of 7 ocular MG patients without anti-AChR antibodies, low but appreciable levels of anti-SE antibodies were found. In 73% (11/15) of generalized MG patients treated with prednisolone and thymectomy, anti-SE antibody titres changed in association with those of anti-AChR antibodies and with the clinical course. Both antibody titres increased synchronously in patients who developed crises.\r"

The myoclonic movements involved mainly the legs but could also affect the whole body. Somatosensory evoked responses were not increased and electroencephalography (EEG) was normal when the patient was relaxed. Startle, self-paced movement or movement on command induced repetitive myoclonic jerks preceded and accompanied by repetitive small spikes in the EEG with phase reversal in the midline at the vertex or slightly posterior to it, regardless of the limb moved. The central spiking subsided considerably earlier than the myoclonic jerks as shown by polygraphic recordings. The EEG spikes were also provoked by mere imagination of movement and persisted in spite of a dramatic reduction of myoclonic activity after treatment with clonazepam. The observations suggest that the vertex spiking in post-hypoxic action myoclonus indicates synchronous cortical activation, but is not closely coupled with activation of the Betz cells of layer V where the pyramidal pathway originates.\r"

Thermal discrimination thresholds were positively correlated with the latency of the constriction reaction of the pupil (r = 0.43, P less than 0.025). Vibratory perception threshold, motor nerve conduction velocity of the peroneal nerve, H-M interval of the Hoffmann reflex and duration of diabetes were not correlated with the constriction latency, whereas glycaemic control showed a weak correlation. It is concluded that there may be a relationship between autonomic (parasympathetic) pupillary dysfunction and peripheral small nerve fibre dysfunction.\r"

The concentration of expired enflurane reported was always higher than the inspired concentration, but never exceeded 0.66% regardless of the concentration of isoflurane. Such mass spectrometer readings may be evidence of vaporizer contamination or malfunction of the vaporizer; however, in this case, the mass spectrometer was found to be out of calibration. Because mass spectrometers are recent additions to clinical equipment, procedures for routine calibration and maintenance must be carefully scrutinized and evaluated.\r"

  ".W": "Transcutaneous oxygen electrodes have been used with success in neonates as indicators of arterial oxygenation, but with less success in adults because of differences in skin thickness and vascularity. In this study, a prototype transoral oxygen electrode was evaluated to determine if a heated mucous membrane would yield arterialized values of oxygen tension in adults. Using a miniaturized Clark electrode, we measured transoral oxygen tension (PtoO2) in 29 subjects at steady-state conditions. Simultaneously a sample was anaerobically obtained from a radial artery for measurement of arterial oxygen tension (PaO2). Data were analyzed using linear regression analysis, Student's t test, and analysis of variance. There was no statistically significant difference between nonwhite and white subjects or male and female subjects. There was a highly significant difference (P less than 0.001) between the pooled, matched values for PtoO2 versus PaO2, and the regression between the PtoO2 and the PaO2 was linear (slope 0.92, y-intercept -8.37, r = 0.62, P less than 0.003). The calculated ratio of PtoO2 to PaO2 was 0.83 +/- 0.03 (standard error). We concluded that the PtoO2 was linearly related to the PaO2, although its accuracy in reflecting PaO2 was low. This finding correlates with previously published data that suggested that the PtoO2 reflects tissue oxygen tension rather than arterialized oxygen tension. Gender and race appeared not to affect the function of the electrode in our study.\r"

  ".W": "Continuous fiberoptic measurement of mixed venous oxygen saturation (SvO2) via a pulmonary artery catheter is a useful, though invasive, monitoring technique. Continuous right atrial venous oxygen saturation measurement by oximetry offers the potential of a significantly less invasive SvO2 measurement. However, catheter motion, character of the vessel, chamber wall reflection, the filtering technique involved in calculating oxygen saturation, and the streaming of venous blood prior to ventricular mixing may influence the feasibility of continuous right atrial (RA) SvO2 measurement. This study investigated the performance of fiberoptically measured RA SvO2, at a position 2 cm from the tricuspid valve, relative to simultaneously measured pulmonary artery (PA) SvO2. Ten pigs were subjected to circulatory shock or chemically induced lung damage. Over a total monitoring period of approximately 40 hours, 464 paired data points were sampled at 5-minute intervals. The difference between the overall means of RA and PA SvO2 was 0.91% with a standard error of the estimate of 4.7%, a regression equation of RA SvO2 = PA SvO2 (0.94 + 2.1) PA So2, and a correlation coefficient of 0.94. Our conclusion, although extrapolated from a pig model, is that fiberoptic SvO2 monitoring may be accomplished less invasively and at a lower cost with a right atrial catheter.\r"

  ".W": "Between January 1, 1971 and December 31, 1984, 50 children (31 males, 19 females) ages 3 1/2 months to 18 years with primary CNS astrocytoma were seen in the Department of Therapeutic Radiology, Stanford University Medical Center. The actuarial survival and freedom from relapse (FFR) for the treated group is 46%, with a median follow-up of 7.2 years and a maximum follow-up of 14 years. The majority of relapses occurred within the first 2 years of diagnosis, and all relapses occurred at or adjacent to the initial site of tumor. Multivariate analysis revealed that factors correlated with poor survival are high histologic grade (including presence of necrosis) and primary tumor in the brain stem, while the only important prognostic factor associated with an adverse FFR is high histologic grade. Age, sex, degree of surgical resection, and total radiation dose to the tumor are not correlated with outcome. Patients with high-grade tumor were selected to receive whole brain irradiation and/or adjuvant chemotherapy; therefore, the findings of apparent poor prognosis associated with whole brain irradiation and adjuvant chemotherapy actually reflect patient selection. Current therapy is adequate for only half of children with astrocytoma. Thus, continued development of innovative therapies is indicated, particularly for those children with adverse prognostic factors.\r"

Twelve of the 29 infants were boys and 17 were girls, with ages ranging from two days to 12 months (median, 7 months). By comparison with 222 patients greater than 1 year of age, infants were significantly more likely to have monoblastic or myelomonoblastic leukemia (P less than .0001), chloroma (P less than .0001), marked hepatomegaly (P = .001), and high leukocyte count (P = .005) and were less likely to have Auer rods (P less than .001). Each of these features except leukocyte count showed an association with infant ANLL in a multivariate analysis. Twenty-four (83%) of the infants attained a complete remission, a rate that was not significantly different from that of the older children. Even though infants had a significantly higher CNS relapse rate (P = .003), their event-free survival times were no different than those of older children (P = .74). Ten of the infants remain in initial complete remission for 5+ to 112+ months (median, 52+ months). Infants with ANLL did not have a poorer prognosis than older patients in our study; future protocols for this age group should emphasize more effective systemic therapy, preferably including an epipodophyllotoxin, as well as improved treatment for subclinical CNS leukemia.\r"

  ".W": "Between 1968 and 1983, 135 patients with pathologic stage (PS) I and II Hodgkin's disease were treated with extended mantle radiation technique (EMRT) at Michael Reese Hospital and the University of Chicago Center for Radiation Therapy. EMRT combines both standard mantle and para-aorta fields (M-PA) in one port. Actuarial disease-free survival at 5 and 10 years was 82.5%. Actuarial overall survival was 96% and 83% at 5 and 10 years, respectively. Acute complications were evaluated in 112 patients available for analysis. Severe nausea and vomiting occurred in 13%, weight loss of greater than 10% of body weight in 19%, and acute hematologic toxicity in 4% of patients. Bone marrow suppression was transient and did not interfere with subsequent delivery of salvage treatment with either chemotherapy or radiation therapy in 22 patients who relapsed. The cost of EMRT is 40% lower than the cost of treatment with M-PA. The median treatment time was 38 days, 33% less than the 56 days for M-PA field assuming no interruptions. These results suggest that the EMT is a safe and effective treatment tolerated by most patients. The advantages of this method are eliminating the possibility of technical error of matching between mantle and para-aortic field, decreasing overall treatment time, and reducing the cost.\r"

Forty-seven patients were evaluable for the assessment of toxicity and antitumor activity. PALA was administered as an intravenous (IV) bolus over 15 minutes at a fixed dose, 250 mg/m2. The latter agent was administered 24 hours before the start of 5-FU infusion. 5-FU was initially administered at 750 mg/m2 and was incrementally increased to 3,400 mg/m2. In both arms of the randomized study, the courses were repeated every week. In both arms of the study, ataxia and myelosuppression were the dose-limiting toxic effects. At 5-FU dose of 3,400 mg/m2, one patient in each arm developed grade 3 hematologic toxicity. Other reversible side effects included grade 2 skin changes, nausea, and vomiting. During the administration of 2,600 mg/m2 of 5-FU over 24 hours, the steady state plasma 5-FU concentration was approximately 20 mumol/L. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) for 5-FU for protracted treatment is 2,600 mg/m2 in either arm of the study. Therapeutic response was predominantly seen in the combination arm: there were two patients with complete response (CR) and 11 patients with partial response (PR) of 28 patients in the study. In the 5-FU alone arm there were four PR and 19 patients in the study.\r"

Fifty-four (70%) corresponded to known sites of disease; eight sites (10%) were \"discovered\" by immunoscintigraphy and subsequently confirmed by conventional studies; 15 imaged sites (20%) could not be confirmed by conventional studies. Size and location of metastasis appear to be important features that influence imaging efficiency. Tumor size (greater than or equal to 2 cm v less than 2 cm) appears to be the statistical dominant determinant.

  ".W": "The chest radiographs (CXRs) of 110 patients with mediastinal Hodgkin's disease (HD) were reviewed to determine the incidence, degree, and significance of mediastinal abnormalities following treatment. Residual mediastinal abnormalities were defined as either minimal or measurable, and occurred in 64% of all patients at the completion of treatment, but were more common in those with bulky mediastinal disease at presentation (40 of 48, 83%). Fifty-one patients with a mediastinal abnormality at the end of treatment had follow-up films available. Partial or complete regression of the abnormality occurred by 1 year in 30 of these patients (59%). Over a median follow-up of 80.5 months, there were more relapses (13 of 70, 19%) in patients with residual abnormalities following treatment than in those where the mediastinum was considered normal (four of 40, 10%). Measurable abnormality was associated with a higher relapse rate (six of 25, 24%) than minimal abnormality (seven of 45, 16%), but none of these differences were statistically significant. the subsequent relapse rate for patients with persisting abnormality at 1 year was 14%, compared with 17% for patients in whom regression had occurred and 14% in whom the mediastinum had always been considered normal. Considering the whole group, the presence of a mediastinal abnormality following treatment did not predict for relapse, but for the 34 patients treated by chemotherapy (CTR) alone, a residual abnormality was associated with a significantly higher relapse rate (P = .029). We conclude that following mediastinal radiotherapy (XRT) administered either alone or combined with CTR, residual mediastinal abnormalities do not indicate the need for further treatment. However, following CTR alone, such abnormalities may signify persisting disease and we recommend that XRT be considered for these patients.\r"

Ipsilateral hemialopecia, transient VII nerve palsy, and blurring of vision seem to be unique to this route of administration at this dose. A complete response was seen at the primary tumor site in nine of 28 (32%), with 14 of 28 partial responses (50%). In evaluating both primary tumor and nodal disease, five of 25 patients achieved a complete response and 15 of 25 a partial response.

All 40 patients have either disease progression or have completed the 12-month protocol. Eighty-seven percent of the patients (35) underwent optimal (less than or equal to 2 cm residual) debulking surgery before chemotherapy, in spite of the fact that 50% (20) were referred to Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) as inoperable after initial surgery elsewhere. There were no postoperative deaths and chemotherapy was started in less than or equal to 14 days in 97% of the patients. Of the 40 patients, 30% (12) achieved a pathologic complete remission (11) or a clinical complete remission (one patient refused second-look surgery). The estimated 3-year survival rate was 62%, but the 3-year progression-free survival rate was only 29%. The median survival time was 48 months. The estimated 3-year progression-free survival rate was 31% for residual disease less than or equal to 2 cm. For the five patients with residual disease greater than 2 cm, four died within 3 years. The median survival time of patients with less than or equal to 2 cm residual disease was 48 months, as compared with 21 months for those with greater than 2 cm residual disease. Although the estimated 3-year survival rate of 62% is noteworthy, the 3-year progression-free survival rate of only 29% is probably indicative that in spite of extensive debulking surgery and cisplatin-based chemotherapy as used in this protocol, the long range proportion of patients \"cured\" will remain small.\r"

  ".U": "88229844\r", 
  ".W": "Of 214 patients with acromegaly who underwent transsphenoidal microsurgical resection of a pituitary adenoma, 54% had growth hormone (GH) levels below 5 ng/ml and 74% had levels less than 10 ng/ml immediately after surgery. Among the 174 patients who could be contacted for long-term follow-up review (average duration 76 months), most recent GH determinations were available for 165. Of these 165 patients, 131 (79.4%) have a GH level less than 5 ng/ml and 153 (92.7%) have a level below 10 ng/ml; these represent 75.3% and 87.9%, respectively, of the total 174 patients reviewed. Fifty-two patients received postoperative radiation therapy. Nine patients underwent reoperation. There were five cases of tumor recurrence following an apparent surgical cure (4.3%), nine new instances of anterior pituitary hypofunction (5%), and five failures of multimodality therapy (2.3%). There were no perioperative deaths, five cases of cerebrospinal fluid leak requiring surgical repair (2.2%), and four cases of postoperative meningitis (1.8%). Permanent diabetes insipidus did not occur. Two of 52 patients who were irradiated postoperatively had severe complications; 23 (54.8%) of 42 patients who were available for follow-up evaluation had developed panhypopituitarism; and eight (19%) of 42 had normal pituitary function an average of 44 months postirradiation.\r"

The rationale for the use of complete cardiac arrest with extracorporeal circulation, hypothermia, and barbiturate cerebral protection is outlined. The surgical and anesthetic considerations are reviewed. The perioperative morbidity and long-term results support the use of these techniques in selected patients with complex intracranial vascular lesions.\r"

  ".W": "Osteoblastoma of the spine is a rare but important cause of back pain in children. Ten children with this tumor were treated at the Alberta Children's or Foothills Hospital in Calgary, Alberta, between 1974 and 1986. There were seven boys and three girls; the age at diagnosis ranged from 2 to 16 years (average 11 years). In nine patients the tumor involved the posterior vertebral elements. One of the cervical lesions was in the vertebral body. Three patients had tumor in the extradural space. The commonest symptom was pain in the back and neck. Bone scans were positive in all patients, and computerized tomography scans were abnormal in the eight patients who had this imaging performed. Nine children were treated with laminectomy and removal of the abnormal pedicle and facet. Two patients required two operations each because of incomplete tumor excision at the first operation; in these, subsequent surgery gave complete relief of symptoms and radiographic studies showed no further tumor. In three other patients, tumor removal was incomplete, and one patient received postoperative radiation therapy. Bone grafts were placed in four patients. The diagnosis of benign osteoblastoma was confirmed histologically in nine patients. The outcome was good in all cases, with excellent pain relief. The follow-up period has varied from 8 to 153 months (average 66 months) and there have been no recurrences. Based on this experience, complete excision of spinal osteoblastomas is recommended whenever possible. However, a satisfactory outcome may be achieved following incomplete excision and bone grafting.\r"

The authors report the clinicopathological findings in six patients who died of severe head injury in whom computerized tomography revealed acute SDH as the predominant lesion. All patients were injured in road traffic accidents and lost consciousness on impact. The mean total contusion index was 17.4 and sever contusions were seen in only two cases. All patients presented histological criteria of intracranial hypertension (pressure necrosis focus in one or both parahippocampal gyri). Hypoxic brain damage was evident in the postmortem examination of three patients. In three cases, macroscopic hematic lesions were observed in the corpus callosum. All patients had widespread axonal retraction balls disseminated in the white brain matter. Three patients who survived for more than 11 days had microglial clusters. In some patients with a head injury, acute SDH may be only an epiphenomenon of a primary impact lesion of variable severity: that is, a diffuse axonal injury. In these cases, the final outcome is fundamentally dependent on the severity of the subjacent diffuse axonal injury.\r"

Of these, 9.1% were admitted late (greater than 72 hours after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH]; of the remaining cases, 94.5% were seen within 24 hours and 50% within 6 hours post-SAH. Of the 121 patients, 10% were neurologically devastated on arrival, a late operation was planned for 19%, and the earliest possible surgery and nimodipine administration was selected for 71%. In this latter group, 50% of the operations were begun within 24 hours and 76% within 48 hours post-SAH. Sixty percent of all mortality and morbidity could be linked to the initial aneurysm bleed. The remaining 40% could be ascribed to potentially avoidable causes of unfavorable outcome. No less than 9.6% of all patients admitted within 24 hours after SAH suffered from \"ultra-early\" rebleeding during transportation or preparation for operation. The mortality rate from such rebleeding was 7.4%, compared with the 9.1% combined mortality rate from complications and late ischemia.\r"

In 14 patients aged over 60 years, internal peritoneal drainage of the hematoma by a low-pressure shunt system proved to be a reliable method of treatment with the following advantages: rapid neurological improvement; immediate mobilization; little stress for the patient; no recurrence; disappearance of the membranes; and slow and well-tolerated cerebral reexpansion without hypotension. Successful use of this method has been reported previously in children, but not in adults.\r"

This injury is thought to be due in part to union of the anuli by the posterior longitudinal ligament, and in part to rim fracture and limited prolapse rather than frank single-level herniation in an adolescent. A review of the embryology, literature, and theoretical mechanism for occurrence at multiple levels is included.\r"

In an attempt to avoid this problem, a phase I trial was performed using intracarotid BCNU infusion before irradiation. Twenty-eight patients with grade III/III astrocytoma (World Health Organization Classification, equivalent to Kernohan grade IV) received a 400-mg infusion of BCNU into the infraophthalmic carotid artery. The treatment was repeated every 4 weeks for a total of four cycles prior to cranial irradiation (5500 to 6000 cGy). The major toxic sequelae included nausea and vomiting (24%), decreased visual acuity (14%), transient cerebral ischemia (3.5%), and thrombocytopenia (3.5%). Fatal leukoencephalopathy occurred in two patients. The median survival time was 37 weeks for all evaluable patients and 56+ weeks for those completing the protocol. The tumor response to drug infusion as judged by computerized tomography (CT) was complete in 22% of patients and partial in 22%; 56% showed no CT tumor response. Pre-irradiation intracarotid artery BCNU benefits a very small group of patients with grade III/III astrocytoma. The associated severe leukoencephalopathy makes this mode of therapy unacceptable for a phase III trial.\r"

The rats were treated with ibuprofen (24 mg/kg/day or 96 mg/kg/day) for 24 hours before implantation of C6 astrocytoma spheroids and then for 13 days following implantation. The wet and dry weight of the tumors and protein extravasation were measured by an Evans blue dye technique. Protein extravasation did not appear to be reduced by the treatments when assessed on the basis of tumor dry weight. The treatment significantly reduced the wet weight of the tumors in rats treated with high-dose and low-dose ibuprofen when compared to tumor wet weights in untreated rats. High-dose ibuprofen treatment significantly decreased the dry weight of the tumors compared to that of tumors in untreated control animals. It is hypothesized that the ibuprofen treatment regimen employed inhibits prostaglandin-associated angiogenesis induced by the C6 tumor cell growth and/or the implantation technique, thereby interfering with the ability of the tumors to grow.\r"

Some features in the spectra of plasma from patients with malignant tumors differ significantly (p less than 0.01) from the corresponding features in the spectra of plasma from control subjects and from patients with benign tumors. The NMR spectral parameters vary consistently with the Kernohan grade of astrocytoma, which may suggest that they give a measure of tumor growth kinetics. The observed spectral differences are shown to be due to elevated levels of monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acid residues in the plasma of cancer patients. It is proposed that these lipid residues arise from cell membranes shed from cells in growing tumors. The ability to follow tumor growth kinetics directly may be of considerable importance in elucidating the effects of primary intracranial neoplasm therapy.\r"

Myeloschisis developed in six fetuses among 205 chick embryos treated in various stages with teratogens including ethylnitrosourea, and anticonvulsant and antipyretic agents. All but one case (with associated cephalothoracopagus) demonstrated myeloschisis in the thoracic region with a lamina defect of two and three levels. No fetus was exposed to a teratogen prior to or within Hamburger and Hamilton stage 12 (45 to 49 hours postincubation), when the neuropore closes. Immunohistochemical studies of chick myeloschisis clearly indicated that neuron-specific enolase-positive elements were extremely active only in the overgrown placode, corresponding to the histological findings with Kluver-Barrera's special stain. These findings were compared with observations in a case of myeloschisis in a human neonate. The results of this study imply the possibility of another mechanism for the embryopathogenesis of myeloschisis: namely, the overgrowth and reopening hypothesis.\r"

The technique is described and subjected to clinical testing by comparing the prediction of biopsy histology from the probability map in patients coming to operation. In those with ovarian cancer undergoing second-look laparotomy after completing full courses of chemotherapy, the prediction of histology in 108 biopsy sites was 45 true positives and 38 true negatives, sensitivity 80%, specificity 73%, accuracy 77% p less than 0.001. In patients with tumors less than 2 cm diameter, 41 biopsy sites were predicted with a specificity of 78% and an accuracy of 76%, p less than 0.01. The technique is reducing the need for second-look laparotomy in patients with subclinical and subradiological disease. Such disease is suitable for intraperitoneal radioimmunotherapy.\r"

An easily prepared kit formulation has been developed and evaluated in ten normal volunteers and three patients on hemodialysis. The average radiochemical purity was 96.6%. There were no adverse reactions. In the volunteers, the relative uptake +/- 1 s.d. was 49.1% +/- 2.6% for the right kidney and 50.9% +/- 2.6% or the left kidney. Urine activity was 71.4% +/- 6.4% of the injected dose at 30 min and 94.4% +/- 2.2% at 180 min. The 60-min plasma clearance was 340.0 +/- 79.0 ml/min and the volume of distribution was 5.15 +/- 1.1I. Approximately 0.5% of the injected dose was present in the gallbladder at 30-60 min postinjection. Gut activity was not present 30-60 min postinjection but reached 1% of the injected dose by 3 hr. In the hemodialysis patients, approximately 1% of the injected dose was present in the gallbladder and 0.5% in the gut at 30-60 min; gut activity increased to approximately 5% at 3 hr. In summary, results using the kit formulation compare favorably to previously published data using the HPLC purified material. Based on these preliminary results, the kit formulation is expected to have widespread clinical utility.\r"

Scintigraphic images were supplemented by quantitative measurement of hepatic extraction fraction by deconvolutional analysis and liver excretion T 1/2 by a nonlinear least squares method. In diseases confined primarily to the biliary tract (isolated common bile duct obstruction and sclerosing cholangitis), the mean hepatic extraction fraction as measured by deconvolutional analysis was not different from that in normal controls. In severe alcoholic cirrhosis, considered primarily a hepatocyte disease, the hepatic extraction fraction was markedly reduced. The T 1/2 excretion, compared to normal subjects, was prolonged in all three liver disease categories. We conclude that these quantitative parameters were able to detect hepatobiliary disease and to separate severe hepatocyte disease from biliary tract disease.\r"

  ".W": "Technetium-99m mercaptoacetyltriglycine [( 99mTc]MAG3) is a new renal radiopharmaceutical with biologic properties similar to iodine-131 orthoiodohippuric acid [( 131I]OIH). MAG3 may be used as a replacement for [131I]OIH and/or [99mTc]DTPA. For this reason, we compared the effects of several potential adverse clinical conditions on the clearance and biodistribution of MAG3, OIH and a GFR marker. To simulate renal failure, five mice underwent bilateral renal pedical ligation. Twenty-four hours after surgery they were injected with MAG3 and OIH and killed 2 hr postinjection. Compared to sham operated controls, liver activity for MAG3 and OIH increased from 0.2% to 14.1% and 0.1% to 13.9%, respectively, while intestinal activity increased from 1.3% to 8.9% for MAG3 and 0.2% to 7.7% for OIH. Constant infusion studies were performed in rats to evaluate the effects of increased plasma organic acid levels, mannitol diuresis, dehydration, and acid/base imbalance on the clearance of OIH, MAG3, and [125I]iothalamate. No differences were noted between the OIH and MAG3 clearances following diuresis and dehydration and the differences involving acid/base imbalance were minimal. Dehydration depressed the clearance of [125I]iothalamate more than that of OIH or MAG3. Para-aminohippurate (PAH) infusion inhibited the clearance of MAG3 more than OIH supporting proximal tubular transport for MAG3; PAH had no effect on [125I]iothalamate. In summary HPLC purified MAG3 behaved similarly to OIH under adverse physiologic conditions and the data continue to support the use of MAG3 as a potential clinical substitute for OIH.\r"

A technique for labeling small volumes of donor red blood cells with [113mIn]tropolone is reported. The use of 113mIn minimizes the accumulation of background radioactivity and the radiation dose especially so when multiple crossmatches are performed. Labeling red cells with [113mIn]tropolone is faster and easier to perform than with other radionuclides. Consistently high labeling efficiencies are obtained and minimal 113mIn activity elutes from the labeled red blood cells. A case study involving 22 crossmatches is presented to demonstrate the technique. The radiation dose equivalent from 113mIn is significantly less than with other radionuclides that may be used to label red cells.\r"

In 2 years she received further three 162 mCi (6 GBq) doses of 131I, as scans showed very similar lung activity. Another scan, during thyroxin suppression, showed again activity in the lungs. A 47-yr-old male patient with similar respiratory disease and no history of thyroid disorder volunteered to undergo radioiodine scan while on triiodothyronine suppression. His scan, too, showed concentration in the lungs. The female patient died 7 years after the diagnosis of lung thyroid metastases was made. No metastasis was found at autopsy. Radioiodine lung uptake may occur in patients with chronic inflammatory lung disease, presenting a potential diagnostic pitfall in patients with differentiated thyroid carcinoma.\r"

There were 27 true-positive, nine true-negative, two false-positive and one false-negative. The false-positives and the false-negative occurred in patients with soft-tissue infections overlying the area of interest. All diagnoses were confirmed by intraoperative bone biopsies and cultures. Bone biopsy and scan were performed within 2 days of each other in 39 patients. The overall sensitivity was 97% (27/28), specificity, 82% (9/11) and the diagnostic accuracy, 92% (36/39). The remaining seven patients had negative [111In]WBC scans several months after positive bone biopsies and definite antibiotic treatment. This suggests that [In]WBC scans become negative after appropriate therapy is undertaken. Interobserver data was obtained from four nuclear physicians of varying experience blinded to clinical information. A high degree of agreement was found in over 90% of the cases. This study demonstrates the utility of [111In]WBC scans in the diagnosis and follow-up of complicated osteomyelitis and a high level of interobserver agreement in scan interpretation.\r"

The [131I]Ethiodol was distributed predominantly in the liver (70-90%) and lungs (10-20%) and was selectively concentrated and retained in the patients with massive and multinodular hepatomas with approximately 10% of the administered activity localizing in tumor. The radioactivity in the blood 2 hr postinjection was less than 0.1% and was never higher than 0.9% of the administered activity. The radioactivity cleared from normal liver tissue with an effective half-life of approximately 4 days while the clearance time from the tumor was 20-25% longer. Activity in the lungs initially increased and then cleared with a 5-day effective half-life. Based on these measurements, the estimated dose per mCi of [131I]Ethiodol administered is 31 rad to the liver, 22 rad to the lungs, 1.9 rad to the total body and 239 rad to a 4-cm diameter tumor.

  ".W": "The biodistribution and in vivo kinetics of [131I]lipiodol infused into the hepatic artery were studied to estimate the potential of internal radiotherapy of hepatic cancer in five patients. It accumulated only in the vascular tumors and adjacent hepatic tissue (AHT) supplied by the infused artery, and to a lesser extent in the lung throughout 8 days imaging sequence. Iodine-131 lipiodol appeared to lead to oil embolization of the tumor and AHT followed by secondary embolization to the lungs and finally the activity was mainly excreted into urine. Four tumors had rapidly and slowly decreasing components, while the AHT activity decreased exponentially from the beginning. The effective half life in tumors was longer with the slow component (mean +/- s.d.: 5.7 +/- 1.2 days) than the AHT (3.7 +/- 0.6 days). The tumor/AHT concentration ratio in three patients at 2 hr was estimated to be 7.5-21. The activity was lower in the lungs than in the AHT in four patients. Iodine-131 lipiodol thus may be used as an intra-arterial infusion agent to treat certain vascular hepatic cancers.\r"

Perfusion of tumor-bearing kidneys with 99mTc-labeled G250 and RC38 antibody resulted in visualization of the tumor, whereas perfusion with two other monoclonal antibodies, RC2 and RC4, did not lead to tumor visualization. Uptake of radiolabel in normal kidney tissue was low for G250 and RC38 antibody. Tumor-to-kidney tissue ratios after perfusion with G250 and RC38 antibody were 2.7 and 2.2, respectively. After rinsing for 3 hr with unlabeled perfusion fluid the tumor-to-kidney tissue ratios increased to 8.6 for G250 antibody and to 2.7 for RC38 antibody. We conclude that perfusion of tumor-bearing human kidneys with radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies is a relatively simple way to evaluate renal cell carcinoma associated monoclonal antibodies as diagnostic agents in vivo.\r"

  ".W": "Terminally radioiodinated fatty acid analogs are of potential use for the noninvasive delineation of regional alterations of fatty acid metabolism by gamma imaging. Since radioactivity from extracted iodine-123 heptadecanoic acid [( 123I]HDA) is released from the myocardium in form of free radioiodide (123I-) the present study was performed to determine whether deiodination of [123I]HDA is related to free fatty acid metabolism. Myocardial production of free radioiodide was measured in rat hearts in vitro and in vivo both under control conditions and after inhibition of fatty acid oxidation. In isolated rat hearts perfused at constant flow with a medium containing [123I]HDA, release of 123I- was markedly reduced during cardioplegia and pharmacologic inhibition of mitochondrial fatty acid transfer with POCA by 67% (p less than 0.005) and 72% (p less than 0.005), respectively. In fasted rats in vivo, 1 min after i.v. injection of [123I]HDA, 51 +/- 5% of myocardial radioactivity was recovered in the aqueous phase, containing free iodide, of myocardial lipid extracts. Aqueous activity was significantly decreased in fed (20 +/- 2%; p less than 0.002) and POCA pretreated (30 +/- 3.7%; p less than 0.05) animals exhibiting reduced oxidation of [14C]palmitate. Thus, deiodination of [123I]HDA was consistently reduced during inhibition of fatty acid oxidation in vitro and in vivo. The results apply to the interpretation of myocardial clearance curves of terminally radioiodinated fatty acid analogs.\r"

This dual probe simultaneously monitors counts from a possible tumor site along with counts from adjacent normal tissue using two concentric, collimated scintillation detectors. A comparison of counts from the detectors can distinguish a small tumor directly in front of the probe from variations in background activity. The probe was tested in computer simulations of surgical staging of metastases to para-aortic and iliac lymph nodes using a spatial response map of the probe, a numerical torso phantom, and organ activity data for [57Co]bleomycin in rabbits. Results show that the dual probe performs better than a single-detector probe in detecting tumors and solves the problem caused by spatial variations in the background source distribution.\r"

Right and left ventricular volumes and ejection fractions were calculated and compared. In the R- group, corresponding right and left ventricular volumes and ejection fractions correlated highly with each other (r = 0.86-0.89, p approximately equal to 0.01). Ejection fractions in the R+ group correlated (r = 0.64, p less than 0.05) only because stroke volume correlation was very high (r = 0.93), with end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes showing no significant correlation. Right ventricular ejection fraction (RVEF) decreased significantly with increasing mean pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) in both R- and R+ groups. The correlation of RVEF and LVEF in the R- group appears to be multifactorial in origin, consisting of effects of increased PAP, the mechanical interference of an enlarged left ventricle on the right ventricle, and direct biventricular ischemic effects. In the R+ group, the correlation appears to be due to only increased PAP and its sequelae.\r"

The effect of extended lactation on transferrin in milk was investigated in two experiments in which litters were replaced by 4-d-old litters at d 8 and 12 of lactation or at d 20 of lactation. Transferrin concentrations in milk in both experiments increased in a similar manner to reach values of 10 mg/ml at d 28 through d 36 of lactation. Serum transferrin and serum insulin and prolactin concentrations were not significantly altered in these experiments. Premature exposure of dams to older pups did not affect the pattern of milk transferrin concentrations. Milk transferrin concentrations were, however, modulated by altering the milk demand (changing litter sizes) and by restricting either the total food intake or the protein content of the diet. These restrictions led to lower transferrin concentrations.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of excess dietary zinc (Zn) on exocrine pancreatic function were studied in chicks. A purified diet based on crystalline amino acids and sucrose was employed in several experiments, and a practical type of diet based on corn and soybean meal was used in one experiment for the purpose of comparison. Additions of as little as 100 mg Zn/kg as ZnO to the purified diet markedly elevated pancreatic Zn concentration, whereas liver and plasma Zn were moderately increased. Histological examination of the pancreas showed alterations in acinar structure due to Zn intoxication. The activities of the pancreatic exportable enzymes amylase, lipase, trypsinogen and chymotrypsinogen were each decreased by such levels of Zn feeding. Reductions of pancreatic enzyme activities were associated with reductions in the digestibility of dietary starch and in tissue alpha-tocopherol concentrations. Chicks fed the nonpurified (i.e., soy-containing) diet accumulated much less Zn in the pancreas (about one-tenth as compared with the purified diet); the addition of as much as 2000 mg Zn/kg as ZnO to this diet produced only a small increase in pancreas Zn concentration, and did not affect exportable pancreatic enzyme activities or tissue alpha-tocopherol concentrations. These results indicate that dietary factors that reduce Zn availability may also reduce Zn toxicity. Chicks fed the purified diet with excess Zn had slightly higher liver selenium (Se) concentrations, but this effect was not associated with changes in the activity of Se-dependent glutathione peroxidase in that organ. Nutritional deprivation of Se did not affect the extent of Zn-induced acinar damage.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In this study dietary zinc intake of mouse pups during recovery from undernutrition affected composition of gain as well as growth. Mouse pups were undernourished during the suckling period and then fed 25% casein recovery diets containing 5, 10, 40 or 110 micrograms Zn/g diet. Pups given dietary zinc levels of 40 micrograms Zn/g ad libitum achieved recovery body weights and had normal body composition. However, previously undernourished pups given marginal levels of dietary zinc (10 micrograms Zn/g diet) had similar food intakes, similar final body weights, lower lean body mass gains and greater fat gains (males only) than controls. Pups fed low zinc diets (5 micrograms Zn/g diet) were unable to attain recovery body weight and had less protein gain than previously undernourished animals fed higher zinc-containing diets or healthy pups fed the same zinc levels. The results were consistently more pronounced in males. Thus dietary zinc deficiency during catch-up growth after undernutrition limited both recovery and protein gain, whereas marginal dietary zinc intake limited protein gain in mice.\r"

  ".U": "88229940\r", 
  ".W": "Because growth is an early sign of zinc (Zn) deficiency in young animals, it is often assumed that the occurrence of normal growth indicates adequate Zn status. In an earlier study we found that both marginal (10 micrograms Zn/g) and low (5 micrograms Zn/g) dietary Zn intake resulted in altered composition of gain in mouse pups that had been previously undernourished (L) from d 10 to 21 of suckling and rehabilitated from d 21 to 40 with high protein recovery diets. Therefore we examined several tissues, organs and biochemical measures to identify other variables that might be sensitive to either marginal or low dietary Zn intake in mice. After undernutrition in the suckling animal, liver Zn concentrations were lower; they normalized when the pups were subsequently fed recovery diets irrespective of dietary Zn intake (5-110 micrograms Zn/g). Bone Zn was 30% lower in pups fed low Zn, and 30% higher in pups given Zn-supplemented recovery diets (110 micrograms Zn/g) compared with controls (40 micrograms Zn/g). Thus bone Zn concentration was highly correlated with dietary Zn intake and lower liver Zn was highly correlated with undernutrition. Most organs of L pups recovered in proportion to body weight; the exceptions were brain, kidney and gastrocnemius muscle. At d 21 or 40, brain weight was most conserved and kidney weight was stunted during either protein or Zn deprivation. Gastrocnemius muscle weight in L pups was stunted to a much greater degree than other tissues, although proximate analysis showed muscle composition was similar among groups. These data support previous reports that adequate dietary Zn is essential for optimal recovery from early undernutrition.\r"

  ".W": "The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of phytic acid on copper (Cu) bioavailability. Male weanling rats were fed a Cu-deficient diet (less than 1.0 micrograms/g) for 4 wk and then were divided into 12 groups (n = 8) in a factorial design. Cu-deficient rats were then fed diets containing 1.4, 3.0, 5.2 or 10.5 micrograms Cu/g (CuCO3) and 0, 0.4 or 0.8% phytic acid as sodium phytate at each Cu level. All diets contained 30 micrograms Zn/g. After 3 d of Cu repletion, liver copper (LCu), liver Cu-Zn superoxide dismutase (LSOD) activity, serum Cu (SCu) and serum ceruloplasmin (CP) concentrations were determined. These parameters were used as indexes of Cu bioavailability. The addition of phytic acid to diets fed to Cu-deficient rats significantly enhanced Cu bioavailability compared to that of rats fed diets without phytic acid. Coefficients of determination (r2) were calculated for each response parameter versus dietary Cu concentration. The r2-values for pooled LCu and LSOD values were 0.31 and 0.30, respectively, between 1.4 and 5.2 micrograms Cu/g. At low dietary Cu concentrations, liver Cu parameters (i.e., LCu and LSOD) were more responsive indexes of Cu status than SCu and CP. Each index of Cu status was found to correlate with the other indexes of Cu nutriture. Phytic acid is postulated to enhance Cu utilization by its ability to bind other dietary components, such as Zn, that compete with Cu at the site of intestinal absorption.\r"

A control group was fed the basal diet (Se = 0.04 mg/kg) and one group was fed the basal diet plus 5 mg Se/L as KSeCN in the drinking water. There were no differences in weight gain and diet consumption among groups fed 2.5 mg Se/kg or less. At 5 and 10 mg Se/kg, rats showed depression in weight gain and diet consumption. After wk 6 there were no abnormalities of the major organs of rats fed 2.5 mg Se/kg or less. Spleen enlargement was observed at 5 and 10 mg Se/kg, and liver damage and kidney enlargement at 10 mg Se/kg. Se content in the blood, liver and kidney of rats fed KSeCN was generally somewhat lower than for those fed Na2SeO3 at the same levels. The availability of Se from KSeCN for glutathione peroxidase formation in blood, liver and kidney was comparable to that of Na2SeO3. Plasma thyroxine in groups fed 10 mg Se/kg was 40% of that in the control group, but was not altered at lower Se levels.\r"

Groups of six rats each were killed at 1, 2.5 and 5 h postprandial and six rats fasted for 19 h served as a 0 time control. Consumption of a test meal increased the weight of small intestinal contents at 1 and 2.5 h compared with unfed animals and in a similar manner for all three protein sources. However, at various times during the postprandial period differences in the level of zinc and CP activity within the small intestinal contents among the three dietary protein sources were observed. Both the SPI and EW groups had significantly higher levels of CPA and CPB activity at 1 h postprandial than the C group. Only in the SPI group was the intestinal level of zinc increased at 1 and 2.5 h compared with the unfed group. At 1 and 2.5 h postprandial intestinal zinc was significantly higher in the SPI group than in the C and EW groups. The results indicate that the disappearance of zinc from the intestine is delayed in rats fed SPI, probably because of the presence of phytate.\r"

Half of the animals from each group were then killed; the remainder continued on their previous Mg intakes and were subjected to low (500 mg Ca/kg diet) dietary Ca for 7 or 15 d. After 10 d of Mg deficiency, rats fed adequate Ca were hypomagnesemic and hypercalcemic, relative to controls, and had elevated circulating parathyroid hormone (PTH) but normal 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol (1,25-DHCC). After 7 d of low dietary Ca, there were no significant differences in plasma Ca, 1,25-DHCC or PTH between control and Mg-deficient rats despite a 50% reduction in plasma Mg in the latter group. After 15 d of low Ca stress, control rats remained normocalcemic, but Mg-deficient rats developed relative hypocalcemia despite similar, high circulating levels of PTH. Plasma 1,25-DHCC in the hypocalcemic, Mg-deficient rats was significantly lower than that of control rats also exposed to low dietary Ca, suggesting an impairment in 1,25-DHCC production during chronic Mg depletion. Significantly elevated renal Ca content was present in the Mg-deficient rats, which was unrelated to dietary Ca and preceded the development of hypocalcemia. The results indicate that both the duration of Mg deficiency and the Ca content of the experimental diet are important determinants of an animal's ability to maintain Ca homeostasis during Mg depletion.\r"

The initial rate of tubulin polymerization was significantly lower (27%) in brain supernatants from the marginally Zn-deficient animals than from controls. This was associated with a lower Zn concentration in the brain supernatants from the marginally deficient rats. Total protein and tubulin concentrations were the same in the supernatants from both groups. These data show that Zn is necessary for normal tubulin assembly and indicate that one biochemical defect underlying brain alterations in Zn deficiency could be abnormal microtubule function.\r"

Paired male C57BL/6J mice of two genotypes, obese (ob/ob) and lean (+/?), were fed a nonpurified diet ad libitum or restricted (2.5 g/d) until 3 mo old. Obese mice had larger livers and kidneys but smaller brains than lean mice. Plasma ceruloplasmin activity of obese mice was 240% of that of lean mice. Restricting food intake but not adrenalectomy reduced this difference, but ceruloplasmin activity of obese mice was still 150% of that of restricted-fed lean mice. Glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activity in liver of obese mice was 70% of that in control lean mice; however, in kidney GSH-Px activity was 135% of that in obese mice. Both liver and kidney GSH-Px differences were eliminated by food restriction but not by adrenalectomy. Blood and brain GSH-Px activity was not influenced by the mutation. Liver and kidney copper-zinc superoxide dismutase activity was lower in obese mice than in lean littermates, 30 and 20%, respectively. Food restriction eliminated this difference in liver but not in kidney. Glutathione S-transferase activity using 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene as substrate was 55% lower in liver (not kidney) of obese mice than in lean mice and this difference was not markedly influenced by food restriction. Obese mice have marked changes in the steady-state activities of a number of protective enzymes that are organ dependent and, in part, due to the hyperphagia associated with this mutation.\r"

In housed calves, combined selenium and vitamin E deficiency was insufficient to provoke the large increase in plasma creatine kinase activity typical of muscle damage. Such increases were only obtained when selenium- and vitamin E-deficient calves were turned out from indoor housing in small pens to open pasture. The rises in plasma creatine kinase activity on turnout were prevented when the calves had consumed diets supplemented with 0.1 mg Se/kg (as Na2SeO3). The percentage of the polyunsaturated fatty acid, linolenic acid (18:3 omega 3), in plasma total fatty acids was up to 10-fold higher in calves consuming fresh grass at pasture or indoors than in those housed indoors and fed purified diet. However, in the housed calves there were no rises in plasma creatine kinase activity, whereas large increases occurred in those turned out to pasture. Thus, because increased dietary polyunsaturated fatty acid at turnout is not the sole trigger for the development of myopathy in selenium- and vitamin E-deficient calves, additional unidentified dietary or environmental factors must also be involved.\r"

  ".W": "These studies were conducted to determine whether dietary cholesterol supplementation could prevent fetal malformations induced by the amphipathic drug AY 9944, which is well known as a cholesterol biosynthesis inhibitor, and to investigate whether the plasma maternal sterol level and the nature of the sterols found in treated Wistar rats could explain this prevention. Pituitary agenesis was the most constant element of holoprosencephaly when AY 9944 was administered on d 4 of gestation at two dosages, 50 or 75 mg/kg. The rate of malformed fetuses was dose related. A strong negative correlation was established between maternal plasma sterol levels on d 10 of gestation (day of pituitary gland formation) and the rate of fetal anomalies (r = -0.97, P less than 0.01). Supplementation of AY 9944-treated rats with cholesterol had an obvious preventive action on fetal malformations. When cholesterol was added to the diet the same day as AY 9944 treatment and maintained until d 15, the prevention of malformations was almost complete. When the supplementation was initiated later, the prevention of anomalies decreased. The nature of plasma maternal sterols shows that the cholesterol supplementation modifies significantly the ratio of cholesterol to 7-dehydrocholesterol in treated rats. Therefore, maternal plasma sterol perturbations may play a role in the teratogenic action of AY 9944.\r"

Casein-based diets (20% protein) supplemented with 30 mmol/kg diet of each of the free purine base, nucleoside or nucleotide were fed to male Sprague-Dawley rats (100 +/- 5 g) for 14 d. Addition of adenine resulted in less weight gain than in controls, greater kidney weight, greater urine volume and higher levels of blood urea nitrogen, serum uric acid, creatinine and allantoin but lower urinary levels of allantoin, uric acid and creatinine. The adenine diet also caused nephropathy characterized by nephromegaly and deposition of crystals. A microscopic examination of the kidneys revealed deposition of crystals mainly in the lumen of convoluted tubules of the cortex. Feeding of diets containing other purine bases, nucleosides and nucleotides had no adverse effects on kidney weight or structure, urine volume, serum uric acid or creatinine. Urinary allantoin excretion, however, was greater in rats fed hypoxanthine, xanthine, nucleoside and nucleotide diets than in control rats. Adenine produced adverse effects only when fed in the free form and not when fed as the nucleoside or nucleotide, suggesting a metabolic significance for free adenine in predicting hyperuricemic effects of foods.\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies have provided evidence that an anaerobic bacterium, which degrades dietary oxalate to CO2 and formate, is present in colonic contents of a number of herbivorous species, laboratory rodents and humans. The present study examines the possibility that these bacteria degrade significant amounts of oxalate and can influence colonic oxalate absorption. Guinea pigs adapted to a diet containing 2% sodium oxalate or fed a normal diet were challenged with 67, 135, 170 or 200 mg of sodium oxalate containing 0.5 microCi of [14C]oxalate, which was injected into the cecum. Adapted animals excreted approximately 2% of the 14C in the urine, regardless of the dose, whereas unadapted animals excreted significantly higher amounts in the urine at the two lower doses and died at the two higher doses. Conversely, antibiotic treatment of adapted guinea pigs reduced the ability of their cecal flora to degrade oxalate, and a correspondingly greater percentage of an injected oxalate load was excreted in the urine. Oxalate degradation rates in cecal fluid were depressed by the secondary bile salt deoxycholate, and in vitro studies with pure isolates of guinea pig and human strains of oxalate degraders confirmed that these bacteria were highly sensitive to low concentrations of deoxycholate. Results indicate that these bacteria may be important in preventing excess absorption of oxalate and raise the possibility that the hyperoxaluria associated with bile salt malabsorption of ileal disease in part may be due to suppression of these bacteria by the bile salts.\r"

One of those, the disaccharide 4-gal-actosyl-sorbitol (lactitol), is only metabolized in the large intestine, where it is converted into acidic residues. We investigated the effect of this compound on net intestinal absorption and body retention of calcium in rats. Because dietary calcium is in a poorly absorbable form when it reaches the large intestine, attempts were made to modify the absorption of calcium present in the large intestine contents by administering lactitol. Net intestinal absorption and body retention of calcium were significantly increased by 2.5 g lactitol/(kg b.w.d) given by a gavage over a 7-d period. This was associated with a lower pH and a better availability to absorptive systems of calcium present in the large intestine contents. The results indicate that in rats lactitol given chronically increases net intestinal absorption of calcium with a subsequently more positive calcium balance.\r"

Infants fed human milk (nine), cow milk-based formula (11), or soy-based formula (11) were studied at 2 weeks and at 2, 4, 6, 9, and 12 months of age. While receiving 400 IU of vitamin D, all infants maintained serum vitamin D concentrations higher or equal to normal adult concentrations, and serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels were maintained at or above normal adult levels. Serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D concentrations were higher than those of adults in the formula-fed but not in the human milk-fed infants. Serum calcium and phosphorus values were similar in all groups; however, urine phosphorus excretion and urine calcium excretion were adjusted to intakes. Serum parathyroid hormone values were normal in all groups. Bone mineral content significantly increased with age similarly in all groups; however, an apparent plateau occurred at 6 months of age in all groups. Bone width steadily increased with age. Taken as a whole, these data suggest that the vitamin D-sufficient term infant fed human milk, cow milk-based formula, or the soy-based formula studied can regulate mineral metabolism within acceptable physiologic limits to attain similar levels of serum minerals and bone mineral content.\r"

Height velocity increased markedly in the prepubertal group over the first year of therapy, with a gradual decrease in the following years. The increased growth rate of the first treatment year continued in the pubertal group. Height standard deviation score for chronologic age increased significantly throughout all treatment years, but for bone age did not change in either group. The more frequent the treatment regimen, the better was the growth response; a dose effect independent of frequency was identified. Thus human growth hormone treatment cannot make up a deficit in height prognosis already present at diagnosis, but prevents further loss of stature, which is why early diagnosis is important.\r"

Anti-HD was detected in three of the 29 children with acute hepatitis B and in only one of the 68 with chronic hepatitis B; none of the serum specimens from 150 asymptomatic carriers with normal liver function profile showed detectable anti-HD. All three children with HDV coinfection cleared HBsAg and seroconverted to anti-HBs, whereas one with superinfection finally had normal liver function without clearance of HBsAg. To identify possible sources of HDV infection, HBV markers and anti-HD in family members were also examined. One 4-month-old infant boy became infected through a blood transfusion from his hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-positive carrier father, who had anti-HD. A 4-month-old infant girl was infected through close contact with her HBeAg-negative carrier father, who had HDV superinfection. The infection sources remained undefined in another two patients. The mothers of these four children were seronegative for anti-HD, indicating that perinatal transmission is not the usual mode of HDV infection in Taiwan. The natural course of either acute or chronic HBV infections in childhood in Taiwan may be more closely related to HBV itself, or to some other yet unrecognized factor, rather than to HDV infection.\r"

Patients with inflammatory bowel disease were grouped according to disease severity (mild, and moderate to severe). Significantly lower pColl-I-C concentrations and growth velocities were found in each severity group among those subjects receiving daily corticosteroid therapy compared with those receiving alternate-day or no corticosteroid therapy (P less than 0.01). When daily corticosteroid therapy was initiated and then maintained for 7 to 14 days in 11 patients with exacerbation of inflammatory bowel disease clinical improvement resulted, but mean procollagen concentrations decreased significantly (P less than 0.001). In seven children with asthma receiving methylprednisolone intravenously, significant decreases in pColl-I-C concentrations were noted within 24 to 48 hours of therapy (P less than 0.001). These data indicate that serum procollagen values decrease during both short- and long-term daily administration of corticosteroid therapy. Longitudinal assessment of procollagen concentrations may provide rapid assessment of the effects of different corticosteroid regimens on growth.\r"

We studied antroduodenal motility in 13 children with pseudo-obstruction. The diagnosis was based on radiographic evidence in all, surgery in 11, and specific pathologic features in four. Antroduodenal motility was abnormal in all 13. Qualitative abnormalities in the patterns of antroduodenal contractions permitted separation into groups: (1) postprandial hypomotility (n = 3), (2) absent migrating motor complexes, with phase 3-like activity at the start of meals (neuropathic variety) (n = 5) (3) very low amplitude or absent contractions (myopathic variety) (n = 2); the remaining patients (n = 3) had other distinctive abnormalities. Cisapride, a new gastrointestinal prokinetic drug, stimulated proximal duodenal contractions in the 30 minutes after a meal in nine of 10 patients tested. These studies indicate that antroduodenal manometry is useful for characterizing intestinal pseudo-obstruction, and cisapride stimulates postprandial duodenal contractions in patients with pseudo-obstruction.\r"

For comparison, we also tested marrow-derived CFU-E from five healthy adults, and circulating CFU-E from cord blood of five healthy neonates. CFU-E from the anemic infants had a 50% maximal response at 0.073 +/- 0.024 U erythropoietin per milliliter (mean +/- SD). They were therefore at least as responsive as were CFU-E from adults, which displayed a 50% maximal response at 0.118 +/- 0.076 U/ml, and as were circulating CFU-E of cord blood origin, which had a 50% maximal response at 0.109 +/- 0.047 U/ml. Because CFU-E from infants with the \"anemia of prematurity\" appeared highly sensitive to erythropoietin in vitro, we propose that its administration to these patients would likely result in a significant increase in erythrocyte production in vivo.\r"

  ".W": "One hundred twenty-two preterm infants were enrolled in a placebo-controlled, double-blind trial using intravenous indomethacin for the prevention of periventricular-intraventricular hemorrhage (PVH-IVH). Before random assignment, data on the infants were stratified according to low-weight (500 to 999 g) or high-weight (1000 to 1500 g) subgroups. Cranial sonography was used to document the absence of PVH-IVH before enrollment and the occurrence of PVH-IVH during the 7-day protocol. Indomethacin, 0.1 mg/kg, or placebo was administered before 12 hours of age and at 24, 48, and 72 hours of age. Five patients receiving indomethacin and six receiving placebo were withdrawn before completion of the study. In the remaining 111 patients, the indomethacin and placebo groups were comparable with respect to gestational ages, maternal complications, Apgar scores, ventilatory requirements, complications of prematurity, and mortality rate. PVH-IVH developed in six of 56 infants who received indomethacin and 11 of 55 infants who received placebo (P = 0.174). Analysis of the individual strata showed that the indomethacin-treated infants in the low-weight subgroup sustained a higher mortality rate (11/17 vs 3/16; P = 0.008) without a reduction in the incidence of PVH-IVH. Infants in the indomethacin-treated high-weight subgroup demonstrated a significantly lower incidence of PVH-IVH (2/39 vs 8/39; P = 0.04), but the frequency of high-grade hemorrhages was comparable for both indomethacin- and placebo-treated groups. In summary, the prophylactic administration of intravenous indomethacin for the prevention of PVH-IVH cannot be recommended for infants less than 1000 g. In preterm infants between 1000 and 1500 g birth weight, indomethacin significantly reduced the incidence of PVH-IVH.\r"

Between the sixth and tenth postnatal hours, indomethacin (0.1 mg/kg) or placebo was administered intravenously every 24 hours for a total of three doses. Cardiac ultrasound studies to assess the status of the ductus arteriosus were performed at 6 postnatal hours and on day 5. Urinary output, serum electrolytes, serum indomethacin levels, and renal and clotting functions were monitored. No differences in birth weight, gestational age, or Apgar scores were noted between the two groups of infants. Two indomethacin-treated infants and three infants given placebo had significant urinary output difficulties, requiring that the study medication be withheld. Of 19 infants given indomethacin, two had germinal matrix or intraventricular hemorrhage, in comparison with 8 of 17 infants given saline solution (p = 0.02). Of the infants who had a left-to-right patent ductus arteriosus shunt before treatment, 64% of the indomethacin-treated and 33% of the saline solution-treated infants no longer had a patent ductus arteriosus on day 5.

Infants were fed either commercial formula or unfortified human milk after their hospital discharge.

Growth was similar in both groups. Bone mineral content was correlated positively to serum phosphorus (r = 0.52, p less than 0.05) and inversely to alkaline phosphatase activity (r = -0.63, p less than 0.01) at 25 weeks postnatally. The use of serum biochemical markers, however, could account for only 44% of the variability in bone mineral content.

Even though the intakes of calcium in the groups fed fortified human milk and Similac SC formula approached the intrauterine requirement for Ca during the third trimester of pregnancy (150 mg/kg/d), the values for BMC in these two groups (37 to 39 mg/cm) at the completion of the study were still considerably less than the intrauterine values for radial BMC at 36 to 37 weeks gestational age (72.6 +/- 14.1 mg/cm). Furthermore, the relative phosphorus deficiency (as determined by increased urinary Ca excretion and increased renal tubular reabsorption of phosphate) in the human milk groups occurred with or without supplements of Ca and P. Rate of weight gain in the fortified human milk group was greater than that of the unfortified human milk group and was comparable to that of infants fed Similac SC formula. Rate of weight gain for the unfortified human milk group was similar to that of infants fed Similac formula containing 20 cal/oz. However, none of the four feeding groups exceeded the 50th percentile for weight at the time of discharge (36 to 37 weeks postconceptional age). The results suggest that fortifying preterm human milk with Ca, P, and protein for low birth weight infants will improve bone mineralization and rate of growth to levels comparable to those achieved with a special formula containing high amounts of protein, Ca, and P.\r"

  ".W": "We undertook a randomized double-blind comparison of griseofulvin and ketoconazole for the treatment of tinea capitis. The outcome was based on fungal culture results and changes in clinical signs and symptoms determined by an assessment system that yielded a severity score. Patients were evaluated at 4-week intervals for 12 weeks. Seventy-nine patients were enrolled; 46 received griseofulvin, and 33 received ketoconazole. Forty-eight patients (26 griseofulvin, 22 ketoconazole) were considered evaluable. Pathogenic fungi were isolated from 78% of the enrolled and 87% of the evaluable patients. Trichophyton tonsurans was the predominant dermatophyte isolated. Potassium hydroxide preparation correlated poorly with culture results (sensitivity 59%). Of 22 evaluable ketoconazole patients, 16 (73%) were considered to have been treated successfully; 25 of 26 (96%) patients who received griseofulvin were successfully treated (chi-square = 3.54, p less than 0.10). The proportion of culture-positive patients at each follow-up visit appeared somewhat greater for the ketoconazole-treated group than for the griseofulvin-treated group, but the differences were not statistically significant. Analysis of severity scores revealed no significant differences between the groups (t test and Mann-Whitney U test). No significant hepatotoxicity or other adverse reactions were observed. We conclude that griseofulvin should remain the drug of choice for treating tinea capitis.\r"

In 1970 the Minnesota legislature required the medical school faculty to find an educational method to redistribute physicians into the medically underserved rural areas of Minnesota or lose state funds for the medical school. After 16 years of the program, all 87 counties in Minnesota have an acceptable ratio of general physicians for the first time in the state's history. RPAP students work directly with and are supervised by general physicians practicing in rural areas; these preceptors have an average age of 40 years, are board-certified, and have 12 years of clinical experience. They give their teaching services and a $2,500 stipend to the student; the state provides $7,000 to the student with no obligation that the student practice in rural Minnesota after training. The preceptors, RPAP staff members, and visiting university faculty members provide 50, 30, and 20 percent, respectively, of a student's grades for the program; the student receives six months of credit for the program. As of 1986, 57 percent of the former RPAP students in practice were practicing in rural communities, with a majority in Minnesota and a majority in towns with populations less than 10,000.\r"

Based on these responses, the author designed and conducted a two-day workshop in June 1987 that was attended by 180 chief residents from 138 programs in 21 specialties from 36 states. Each skill was taught by presenting a lecture and a small-group exercise to apply the skill; these small groups were led by trained faculty members. The participants rated the workshop as 4.21 (on a 5-point scale in which 5 = very helpful). The workshop will be offered annually.\r"

The residents rated their attitudes toward each patient and indicated their beliefs about the patients' health status, adjustment to medical care, and expected benefits of health education activities. In general, both the residents and the patients expressed satisfaction with their clinical encounters. Little similarity in the satisfaction ratings of the residents and patients was found. The patients tended to express higher levels of satisfaction than the residents. The residents' perceptions of the expected benefits of health education and attitudes toward the patient were found to be statistically significant predictors of the residents' satisfaction. These findings suggest that specific attitudes and beliefs of residents toward their geriatric patients are linked to the residents' satisfaction and hold important implications for medical training.\r"

These results concur with the findings of the NBME, which advises directors wishing to adjust the criterion group norms to determine the average difference observed in a school's performance on the two examinations and to use that difference or some portion of it in their interpretation of percentile scores on the subject examination. Additional analyses revealed that a single, linear weight may inappropriately adjust these scores, that student performance on the Part II subtest depends on specialty choice (obstetrics-gynecology versus all others), and that time and sequence of the clerkship were unrelated to the students' performance on the two examinations.\r"

In this article, the authors describe the development of the evaluation system employed by the Baylor College of Medicine and its affiliated hospitals to assess the clinical progress of residents in anesthesiology. The system evaluates the residents' progress in terms of levels of performance that are based on case complexity and degree of staff intervention.\r"

A total of 7 different adducts were detected in the 53 specimens of human placental tissue examined by the 32P-postlabeling assay. Three of these adducts were found almost exclusively in smokers. Among smokers there were positive dose-response relationships between levels of the smoking-related adducts and biochemical estimates of doses of maternal exposure to cigarette smoke during pregnancy. Levels of 1 adduct found only in smokers appeared to relate directly to amounts of caffeine consumption by the mother. In addition to these relationships with maternal exposures, levels of smoking-related adducts were inversely associated with the birth weight of offspring. Results from this study suggest that even at their current formative stage of development, assays for DNA adducts may help identify determinants of DNA damage to human tissues and improve our ability to demonstrate dose-response relationships for the effects of environmental exposures to potentially carcinogenic agents.\r"

Neither total calories nor retinol from foods was related to cancer risk, nor was plasma retinol. When plasma and dietary indexes were considered together, vitamin C, fruit juices, and plasma beta-carotene showed protective effects. Plasma beta-carotene reduced risk from top to bottom quartile by 80%, vitamin C by 60%, and fruit juices by 50%. Thus the evidence suggests that cancer risk is associated with some aspect of diet that is reflected in the effect of plasma beta-carotene. There is no clear effect of any one nutrient but fruit juices appear protective. Thus vitamin C and beta-carotene are likely candidates.\r"

The 5-year relative survival rates during the total period were approximately 40%; patients with colonic carcinoma had a somewhat better prognosis than patients with rectal carcinoma, and men had a generally less favorable prognosis than women. Comparison of patients diagnosed in 1960-1964 and in 1975-1979 showed a slight improvement in survival during the more recent study period, i.e., an improvement rate of 7.0% for both cancer of the colon and cancer of the rectum. The improvement occurred mainly during the first months of follow-up. However, the excess mortality due to colorectal cancer 1-5 years after diagnosis as compared to the expected mortality in the general population remained virtually unaltered. A multivariate analysis in which adjustment was made for the possible confounding variables of sex, age, and site (of colonic carcinoma) gave consistent results. Reduced postoperative mortality was considered to be the most likely major explanation for the temporal trend toward a more favorable prognosis. Thus it seemed that the treatment of colorectal cancer in Sweden during the last two decades has not improved significantly except in terms of reduced postoperative mortality. Thus the challenge of improving survival in patients with colorectal cancer must be given high priority.\r"

  ".W": "The arrest, retention, and elimination (i.e., clearance) of radiolabeled YAC-1 lymphoma cells injected either iv or into the left ventricle (LV) of the heart were studied in male BALB/c mice, with special emphasis on the role of natural killer (NK) cells. After iv injection YAC-1 cells were arrested and, to a large extent, destroyed in the lungs, which contain the first capillary bed that iv injected tumor cells meet. After LV injection the initial distribution of the tumor cells, which depends on the distribution of cardiac output at the time of injection, was estimated by use of radiolabeled microspheres. Using this technique, we have shown that LV-injected tumor cells, in contrast to iv injected tumor cells, were not arrested in the first capillary bed that they encountered but passed viably through the microvasculature of the brain, heart, kidneys, intestinal tract, and to some extent, the bone, skin, and muscle. The only organs that could arrest the LV-injected tumor cells were the lungs and the liver. In the lungs clearance of YAC-1 cells began immediately after the cells were arrested. However, the rate of clearance could be almost abrogated by pretreatment of the recipients with anti-asialo GM1 antiserum, which destroys most of the NK cells in vivo and strongly depresses the in vitro NK cell activity. In contrast, YAC-1 cells arrested in the liver were not cleared from this organ during the first 1-2 hours after arrest. After this delay clearance of the cells commenced. Pretreatment of the recipients with anti-asialo GM1 also strongly depressed the clearance of tumor cells from the liver. Although pretreatment with polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid enhanced in vitro NK cell activity, it could augment only slightly the clearance of YAC-1 cells from the lungs and the liver. Thus these results strongly support the hypothesis that the rapid clearance of tumor cells from both the lungs and the liver depends, at least partially, on the NK cell activity within these organs.\r"

The c-myc proto-oncogene appeared to be amplified 2- to 15-fold in the DNA of 20 tumors (41%). Non-germ line c-myc-related fragments (rearrangements) of variable size were detected in 7 primary breast tumors (6 malignant, 1 benign); 4 of these tumors presented both rearrangement and amplification, and the other 3 presented rearrangement only. The majority of the tumors analyzed were invasive ductal adenocarcinomas; 58% of these showed c-myc locus genetic alterations. Although the c-myc alterations described here do not appear to correlate with the aggressive behavior of primary breast tumors, they seem to be associated with development of breast carcinoma.\r"

  ".W": "N-Methylformamide (NMF) has been an agent of considerable interest to oncologists because of its broad spectrum of preclinical antitumor activity, tumor-differentiating abilities, and radiosensitizing and chemosensitizing properties. In this report, the pharmacokinetics of NMF are described, based on data from two phase I studies exploring both iv and oral routes of administration. Mean peak NMF plasma concentrations at recommended phase II doses were 0.46 mmol/L for NMF administered orally, 600 mg/m2 three times/week X 4 weeks every 6 weeks, and 2.78 mmol/L for NMF administered as a weekly iv bolus at 2,000 mg/m2 X 3 weeks every 4 weeks. These NMF concentrations were significantly lower than the concentrations that have been demonstrated to induce antineoplastic and relevant biologic effects in preclinical studies. Plasma disappearance curves were biphasic in the majority of patients; however, 25% of the curves were best fit by a monoexponential kinetic model. Mean alpha half-life and beta half-life values (+/- SE) were 10 +/- 2 and 732 +/- 93 min, respectively. Volumes of distribution for the theoretical central compartment (Vc) and at steady-state (Vss) were 13.8 +/- 1.1 L/m2 and 18.7 +/- 1.1 L/m2, respectively. The mean plasma clearance of NMF was 19.1 +/- 2.1 mL/min per square meter, and the relative contributions to parent compound disposition by respiratory and renal routes were insignificant. No metabolites were identified. Gastrointestinal absorption of oral NMF was rapid and nearly complete; oral bioavailability was calculated to be 0.87. Pharmacodynamic associations were observed between the magnitude of the area under the plasma disappearance curves and hepatotoxicity, the dose-limiting toxic effect of iv NMF, and the symptom complex of nausea, vomiting, and malaise, which precluded dose escalation of oral NMF.\r"

Other risk factors significantly associated with breast cancer among men were drug treatment associated with prolactin elevations, radiation treatment, family history of breast cancer among first-degree relatives, a history of gynecomastia, gonadal injury, and treatment for inguinal hernias. The results confirm some previously described risk factors for male breast cancer and suggest that events elevating plasma prolactin (e.g., drugs, brain concussions, and skull fractures) and events predisposing for inguinal hernias may be new risk factors for the disease. Using hospital charts is likely to underestimate exposure for different risk factors; therefore, the results need to be confirmed in studies that directly retrieve information. However, such studies are difficult or impossible to undertake in most countries because the disease is so rare.\r"

  ".U": "88230504\r", 
  ".W": "By analyzing serial step-sections of whole prostate obtained at autopsy, we determined the chronologic change of the frequency of latent prostate tumor in Japan in two periods: 1965-1979 and 1982-1986. Methods of specimen preparation and examination were identical for both periods. The frequency with which latent prostate carcinoma was found in the 660 samples for 1982-1986 was 34.6% and was significantly higher than the 22.5% seen in the 576 observed for 1965-1979 (P less than .0001). This significant finding can be attributed to an increase in the frequency of latent infiltrative tumor (LIT). However, the increase in the frequency of noninfiltrative tumor (LNT) was less significant (P = .045). Both sets of specimens were subsequently combined and reanalyzed according to the year of birth of the decedents. The LIT has progressively increased in frequency in each age-specific category. By morphometry, we determined that the mean tumor volume decreased due to an increase in the number of smaller tumors during the study periods. Although the frequency of latent prostate carcinoma and the LIT:LNT in the samples obtained most recently were comparable to those of U.S. whites, cancer incidence and mortality rates remain lower in Japan. Apparently, the initial step in the induction of prostate carcinoma in indigenous Japanese is now similar to that in U.S. whites. The rates of clinical carcinoma in Japan are still low when compared with those in the United States and countries in Western Europe, but our findings may presage a time when these differences may be greatly reduced or nonexistent.\r"

Tumor growth was achieved with specimens derived from cancers of the floor of the mouth, hypopharynx, and larynx. Tumors in nude mice retained their histological stage of differentiation and human species origin. Prompted by reports of increased estrogen receptors in laryngeal carcinomas, we tested the effect of estradiol treatment on the growth of laryngeal tumor implants. Time to tumor formation was decreased and tumor size was increased in estradiol-treated animals relative to placebo-treated animals. The results demonstrate that estradiol treatment potentiates growth of laryngeal tumors in nude mice. This tumor model can also be used to evaluate antihormonal therapy in the treatment of some laryngeal carcinomas.\r"

The Lawson technique was used in all patients and it was successful in all but 2. In those 2 patients the Hawkins-Hunter technique was successful. There were no intraoperative or postoperative complications related to this approach. Except for 1 patient who suffered a post-procedure pulmonary embolus, no transfusions were required. The targeted stone was removed in 1 procedure in 61 of 71 patients (86 per cent). Ten patients required another procedure to remove the targeted stone or a second stone. Percutaneous procedures still are required for certain stone problems or when extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy is not readily available. The ability of the urologist to perform this easy procedure will allow him more choice in how to manage stone patients.\r"

From 1981 to 1986, 15 patients were treated with intracaval neoplastic extension of renal cell carcinoma above the level of the most inferior hepatic veins. In 6 patients mobilization of the vena cava with division of the hepatic veins to the caudate lobe allowed excision of the tumor and tumor thrombus without cardiopulmonary bypass (group 1). The remaining 9 patients underwent cardiopulmonary bypass and hypothermia (group 2). There was 1 postoperative mortality in the entire group. Most patients had advanced regional disease but the feasibility of this technique has been demonstrated. Survival appeared to be less in the bypass group. Although some of the patients have had metastatic disease, the quality of life and survival have been prolonged in many of these acutely ill patients.\r"

The success rate for ureteroscopic removal of distal calculi (99 per cent) was higher than for blind basketing procedures (59 per cent).

The Hawkins-Hunter retrograde nephrostomy technique was modified by anchoring the catheter in the renal parenchyma, which prevented displacement from the targeted calix by the puncturing needle. Retrograde nephrostomy (76 patients) or percutaneous puncture (7) was established, for a combined access rate of 99 per cent in 83 patients (2 of the 85 had prior tube placement). Only 1 patient (early in the series in 1982) required an open operation because of percutaneous access failure. Tomography showed that the targeted calculi were removed completely from 61 of 66 patients (92 per cent) with uncomplicated stones and 13 of 19 (68 per cent) with complicated stones. The patients left with fragments have remained asymptomatic for a mean followup of 2.6 years. Because the concomitant use of transurethral and percutaneous approaches to stone removal was facilitated by retrograde nephrostomy, all 59 ureteral stones were removed completely from 46 patients. The mean postoperative hospital stay was 2.6 days for 66 patients with uncomplicated stones and 8.2 days for 19 with complicated stones. The Hawkins-Hunter retrograde nephrostomy technique is the preferred method to establish the tract; it facilitates simultaneous transurethral stone manipulation and the assistance of a radiologist is not essential for safe and effective nephrostolithotomy.\r"

Among the stones treated within the ureter the success rates appeared to be similar for stones treated in situ (83.3 per cent) compared to those treated when a catheter could be placed alongside the calculus (79.3 per cent). Higher voltage and more shock waves were administered to stones treated within the ureter compared to stones that were manipulated back into the kidney. However, this increase power did not enhance the success rate. In addition, it appears that a plain film of the abdomen obtained within 24 hours of lithotripsy treatment is a good predictor of success as defined by the rate free of stones at 6 weeks of followup. Our results from a community-based multi-use lithotripsy center suggest that ureteral stone manipulation should be attempted before extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy for mid and upper ureteral calculi.\r"

While the endoscopic procedure for ureteroileal anastomotic strictures is less successful than open revision, the lower morbidity, decreased cost and shorter hospital stay associated with the endourological approach favor its use over open revision. For elderly patients who fail initial endoscopic revision and for patients with metastatic transitional cell cancer, placement of an indwelling stent is a reasonable alternative. Given these guidelines, less than 30 per cent of the patients who suffer a ureteroileal anastomotic stricture will require open surgical revision.\r"

The morphology of the cecal mucosa was well preserved, showing only minor atrophy with slightly reduced villous height. Nonprogressive increase of inflammatory cells was found interstitially and there was a slight increase of collagen fibers. Histochemical studies revealed a shift, probably originating soon after the urinary diversion, from sulfomucins to sialomucins in most patients. Presumably, this shift was a secondary, nonspecific phenomenon. No correlation was found between the type of mucin and the result of urine culture. Ileal valve biopsies revealed severe mucosal atrophy and a considerable increase in the amount of collagen fibers.\r"

  ".W": "To define the nature and risk of complications associated with Kock pouch urinary diversion after high dose radiation (more than 4,500 rad), we analyzed the clinical course of 44 irradiated patients and a comparable group of 42 selected retrospectively from the nonirradiated patient cohort. Of the 42 patients in the irradiated group 18 had received 4,500 to 5,700 rad and 24 had received 6,000 to 8,700 rad. With standard statistical methods we found no difference between the irradiated and control groups when compared for age, sex ratio, followup interval, surgical procedure, operative time or estimated blood loss. There were 2 operative mortalities in the irradiated and 1 in the control groups. In the immediate postoperative period there was no difference between the irradiated and control groups when compared for hospital stay, incidence of urine leak or fascial dehiscence. The irradiated group had 8 urine leaks (20 per cent) and 3 patients (7.5 per cent) required surgical repair. The control group had 5 urine leaks and 1 patient (2.3 per cent) required repair. Diarrhea severe enough to require further hospitalization or medication was significantly more frequent in the irradiated group (18 versus 2 per cent) but the postoperative stay was not significantly different (13 versus 11 days). We conclude that Kock pouch urinary diversion may be performed safely in highly irradiated patients.\r"

Therapy was tolerated well except for 1 patient who suffered a fatal chemotherapy complication. Indications for adjuvant chemotherapy included vascular invasion of the primary tumor, perivesicular tumor involvement, invasion of adjacent pelvic viscera (vagina and prostate) and nodal metastases. There were 53 concurrently treated patients who did not receive adjuvant chemotherapy despite similar unfavorable pathological indications (high risk control group). Survival rates (61 and 73 per cent, respectively) were not significantly different for those patients treated with adjuvant chemotherapy and an additional group of 158 patients who underwent cystectomy during the study period but who had no adverse pathological findings (low risk control group). Survival rates differed significantly between the low risk (73 per cent) and high risk (38 per cent) control groups (p less than 0.001). Patients with unfavorable histological findings who received adjuvant chemotherapy had a significant survival advantage over the high risk control groups (61 versus 38 per cent, p equals 0.03). These data confirm the predictive value of post-cystectomy pathological findings and suggest that adjuvant chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and cisplatin not only prolongs the survival free of disease for patients at high risk for recurrence but it also may ultimately increase the cure fraction of such patients.\r"

The nerve-sparing procedure was technically feasible in 20 of 30 consecutive patients and it was only impractical with extensive gross disease. Of the 20 patients 18 (90 per cent) ejaculate, including 8 with bulky (5 cm. or more) residual retroperitoneal disease who underwent a successful nerve-sparing operation. All 12 patients (100 per cent) with nonbulky disease ejaculate. With short followup, no retroperitoneal recurrences have been detected. This technique is an alternative to limited dissection designed to spare nerves using boundaries based on the patterns of metastatic involvement.\r"

Of 462 evaluable patients from the Testicular Cancer Intergroup Study 47 (10.2 per cent) had undergone a nonclassical orchiectomy as the initial surgical management. This group was analyzed separately to determine the prognostic significance of needle aspiration, open biopsy, a scrotal approach and tumor contamination. Within this group of patients, those who received no adjuvant chemotherapy exhibited no increase in local or distant recurrence. While the recurrence rate similarly was not adversely affected by even gross tumor contamination, this subset underwent significantly more aggressive local surgical salvage (p less than 0.01), with scrotectomy procedures found to be of probable therapeutic value. While not to be condoned, we conclude that deviations from the classical orchiectomy, when followed by appropriate surgical management and close observation, can be of little clinical impact.\r"

At less than 3.0 cc cancer volume, only 6 of 34 prostates (18 per cent) showed capsular penetration compared to 27 of 34 (79 per cent) with tumors of greater than 3.0 cc. Seminal vesicle invasion occurred once in 34 tumors of less than 3.0 cc and 15 times in those greater than 3.0 cc. All 6 patients with metastases to lymph nodes, 2 with early postoperative development of bone metastases and 4 of 5 with reappearance of detectable prostate specific antigen postoperatively had cancer volumes of greater than 4.0 cc. Correlation of digital rectal examination with cancer volume showed that of 39 palpable nodules in prostates with a cancer volume of less than 4.0 cc 30 (77 per cent) occupied 50 per cent or less of the length of 1 lobe (clinical stage B1 in our classification). Of 22 palpable lesions in tumors of greater than 4.0 cc 21 (95 per cent) exceeded 50 per cent of 1 lobe in the longitudinal extension (stage B2) or they represented bilaterally palpable disease (stage B3). Capsular penetration into the periprostatic fat occurred most commonly in the dorsolateral area of the neurovascular bundle, including 10 of 12 tumors less than 4.0 cc in volume (stage B1) and 19 of 21 with greater than 4.0 cc in tumor volume (stages B2 and B3). All 10 of the stage B1 cancers were free of contralateral lobe capsular penetration while 1 of the 13 stage B2 nodules had minimal contralateral capsule penetration in the area of the neurovascular bundle. We believe that the modified nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy should be limited to the contralateral side in stage B disease.\r"

To study this question a retrospective review was conducted of 68 patients with stage D1 disease. Of the patients 22 underwent immediate orchiectomy, 24 delayed orchiectomy and 11 exogenous antiandrogen treatment (8 immediate and 3 delayed treatment), and 11 had no androgen deprivation. The patients were placed into 2 groups consisting of those receiving immediate hormonal deprivation (30) and those having treatment at the time of bone metastasis or who are as yet untreated (38). The minimum followup was 60 months. The median interval to progression to bone metastasis was 43 months in the delayed treatment group compared to 100 months in the immediate hormonal deprivation group. This difference was statistically significant (p equals 0.0087). Likewise, the median period from diagnosis to death was 90 months in the delayed treatment group and 150 months in the immediate treatment group. This difference was not significant (p equals 0.1110). Thus, orchiectomy or adequate androgen deprivation from our data significantly prolongs the interval to bone metastasis in patients with metastatic prostate cancer limited to the pelvic lymph nodes. The apparent increased length of survival of the immediate treatment group lacks statistical confirmation.\r"

The standard nerve-sparing cystoprostatectomy is performed and no segment of the bladder or prostate is left to compromise the cancer operation. In female or male patients with diffuse carcinoma in situ a similar reservoir with a plicated ileocutaneous anastomosis also can provide continence with intermittent catheterization. Four patients with a urethral anastomosis have day and nighttime continence, and 2 with a cutaneous stoma have 4 to 5-hour dry intervals.

This was accomplished by basing the ureteral segment solely on a vascular pedicle arising from the internal iliac artery. Diagnoses included classical bladder exstrophy in 4 patients, cloacal exstrophy in 3 and an imperforate anus with hypoplasia of the bladder neck and urethra in 1. Continence was achieved by a tunneled submucosal reimplantation into either the bladder (4 cases), gastric reservoir (2) or colonic reservoir (2). Although an isolated distal segment of ureter was used in each case, all segments have remained viable. With limited followup (5 to 44 months) continence with either normal voiding or intermittent catheterization has been achieved in 7 of the 8 patients. A distal ureteral segment should be considered potentially useful in the construction or reconstruction of the proximal (male) or total (female) urethra in patients with congenital urethral malformations.\r"

On therapy with 300 mg. allopurinol and 60 mEq. potassium citrate daily serum uric acid decreased from 9.2 to 5.8 mg. per dl., urinary pH increased from less than 5.5 to 6.6 and urinary citrate increased from 223 to 1,005 mg. per day. Four months later while still on this medical regimen, the patient presented with hypercalcemia (13.4 mg. per dl.), high serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (65 pg. per ml.) and hypercalciuria (598 mg. per day), which subsequently were found to result from sarcoidosis. Prednisone therapy normalized the disturbances in calcium metabolism. During 33 months of combined treatment with 7.5 to 10 mg. prednisone a day, allopurinol and potassium citrate, the patient was free of stones and he had normal urinary calcium, pH and citrate. However, a calcium stone formed 1 month after discontinuation of prednisone therapy, although treatment with allopurinol and potassium citrate was continued. The patient had marked hypercalciuria of 447 to 465 mg. per day, despite normal urinary pH, citrate and uric acid. This case represents calcium stone formation in a patient with 2 separate etiologies for stone disease, that is gouty diathesis and sarcoidosis. Therapeutic regimens directed at the correction of both metabolic disturbances were required to control renal stone formation.\r"

The association of appendicitis with abnormal urinary sediment or ureteral obstruction has been reported previously. We report 3 cases of proved appendicitis that presented with other symptoms suggestive of acute urological disorders (gross hematuria, acute prostatis and acute pyelonephritis). While gross hematuria caused by appendicitis has been reported previously, cases of appendicitis mimicking acute prostatitis or rupture of a renal calix with extravasation of urine following ureteral obstruction have not been described. Recognition of unusual manifestations of appendicitis is essential in current surgical practice. Appendicitis should be included in the differential diagnosis of acute urological disorders.\r"

  ".U": "88230676\r", 
  ".W": "Micturition is accomplished via a coordinated contraction of the urinary bladder body mediated primarily by muscarinic receptor stimulation. Theoretically, bladder function may be modified by pharmacologically altering either the muscarinic receptor density and/or the magnitude of the response to receptor activation. In the central nervous system, autonomic receptor density can be modified by chronic administration of specific receptor agonists and antagonists. The chronic administration of receptor agonists induces a decrease in the specific receptor density whereas the chronic administration of antagonists induces an increase in the specific receptor density. Although these induced alterations in receptor density occur in the CNS, there have been few studies on peripheral tissue. For the current study, we have administered L-atropine chronically to rats (five mg./kg./day) using implanted osmotic pumps. Using direct radioligand binding techniques, the muscarinic receptor density of the rat brain (cortex) and urinary bladder were determined following six hours, 12 hours, one, two, four, seven, 11 and 14 days of atropine administration. In addition, we have also determined the effect of atropine administration on bladder weight and the response of isolated strips of the bladder to bethanechol, a specific muscarinic agonist. For both the brain and the bladder, the receptor density increased progressively and reached a maximum by seven days. At 14 days of atropine administration, the density of muscarinic receptors in rat brain increased significantly (p less than .05) from 2956 +/-74 fmoles/mg. protein to 3800 +/-170 fmoles/mg. protein. The muscarinic receptor density of the rat urinary bladder increased significantly from 115 +/-10 fmole/mg. protein to 165 +/-14 fmole/mg. protein. Although there was a 42% increase in bladder mass, the contractile response of isolated strips to bethanechol did not change significantly. This study demonstrates that the urinary bladder can respond to the chronic administration of atropine with a significant increase in the density of muscarinic receptors. The magnitude of the increase observed was slightly greater than the magnitude observed for muscarinic receptors isolated from the brain cortex.\r"

Ischemia compromises both these factors and results in dysfunction, the extent depending on the degree and duration of ischemia. This study determined the effects of one, two and four weeks in vivo ischemia on the capacity, compliance and contractile function of the rabbit urinary bladder. Morphological changes were also studied with light microscopy. Different degrees of ischemia were achieved as follows. In the unilateral group the vesical artery was tied on one side and the animals were sacrificed at one week or two weeks. In the bilateral group the vesical arteries on both sides were tied and the animals were sacrificed one week later. In the bilateral staged group the vesical artery was tied on one side and after one week the contralateral artery was ligated, and the animals sacrificed one week after the second procedure. Muscle strips were studied for contractile response, with a distinction being made between the ipsilateral and contralateral side of vessel ligation in the unilateral group. The results were as follows. 1) In the unilateral group there was a 72% reduction in the contractile response of the dome of the bladder to bethanecol on the side of vessel ligation and a 32% reduction on the contralateral side. The response to methoxamine on the base was reduced by 44%, with no difference between the ipsilateral and contralateral side. 2) Bilateral vessel ligation resulted in a 97% reduction in contractile response to bethanechol on the dome and a 75% in the response of the base to methoxamine. 3) Staged bilateral ligation resulted in a 69% reduction in the contractile response of the dome to bethanechol and a 18% reduction in the response of the base to methoxamine. Ischemia caused a marked reduction in the compliance and capacity of the bladder in all the three groups, with the most marked changes in the bilateral group. Multiple spontaneous contractions were noted in the three groups during the filling phase of the cystometrograms. Histological features correlated well with the functional changes in the different groups.\r"

The cystometry showed that the diabetic bladders had an increased compliance and a higher threshold volume for initiating a micturition reflex. No spontaneous rhythmic contractions were seen during the filling phase, and no residual urine could be detected. While micturition pressure increased, the micturition time was virtually unaltered. In vitro a right-ward shift for passive and active length-tension relations was noted. The observed changes in cystometric characteristics and length-tension relations might probably be explained on the basis of adaptive changes to the increased diuresis involving both sensory and motor control of the urinary bladder.\r"

Hematocrit values and fibrinogen levels were higher, whereas the erythrocyte filterability index was lower among the patients with Buerger's disease (p less than 0.001). Incubation of washed erythrocytes from these patients with control plasma of blood type AB produced an improvement of the filterability index (p less than 0.005). Our findings suggest that patients suffering from Buerger's disease show, in addition to the well-recognized arterial lesions, an abnormality in the factors affecting blood viscosity. This may contribute to a worsening of the clinical manifestations. Evidence is presented suggesting that a plasmatic factor may be responsible for the impaired erythrocyte filterability.\r"

The most commonly found vessel is the trigeminal artery, followed by the hypoglossal and proatlantal intersegmental arteries. The primitive otic artery is the rarest of the four anomalous vessels. These vessels are usually large and are associated with hypoplasia or aplasia of the normal intracranial anastomotic channels. Cerebral ischemia is common during temporary intraoperative carotid occlusion and was encountered in two of three patients who had intraoperative electroencephalographic monitoring. Thus cerebral ischemia should be anticipated during carotid cross-clamping and cerebral protective measures should be instituted when persistent primitive cranial vessels are encountered.\r"

  ".W": "Two hundred forty-three bypasses to paramalleolar arteries were performed in 224 extremities of 208 patients since 1971; 166 were implanted in men (68%) and 77 in women (32%). The median age was 73 years. Gangrene (61%), nonhealing ulcer (15%), rest pain (22%), and trauma (2%) were the indications for bypass. Usual risk factors were noted: diabetes (65%), smoking (51%), heart disease (46%), and hypertension (45%). The extent of occlusive disease dictated three graft configurations: long grafts originating in arteries proximal to the adductor tendon (n = 111), short grafts originating at or below the popliteal artery (n = 88), and jump grafts originating near the distal end of a previous femorodistal bypass (n = 44). The association between diabetes (incidence 80%) and gangrene (75%) in patients with short grafts was statistically significant (p less than 0.01). The 2-year secondary patency rate of long in situ grafts was 92% compared with 72% for other autogenous vein long grafts. The limb salvage rate for all autogenous vein long grafts was 90% at 3 years. The secondary patency rate at 3 years for short grafts was 81% and the limb salvage rate was 80%. There were four amputations with patent grafts. Primary and secondary patency rates of jump grafts were similar (53%), whereas the limb salvage rate was 89% at 2 years. Patency and limb salvage rates of rarely employed nonautogenous conduits were less than 35% at 1 year (long grafts). Bypass grafts to the ankle and foot are effective and durable and should be performed with autogenous vein.\r"

  ".W": "A review was undertaken of all patients seen in our institution between January 1978 and March 1987 in whom a cerebral CT scan was obtained in association with elective carotid endarterectomy. Three hundred fifty-nine such patients were identified. In a subgroup of 89 patients who were neurologically normal after carotid endarterectomy, scans were performed at least 48 hours after surgery to quantitate the incidence of silent postoperative infarction. These scans were interpreted by one neuroradiologist. Preoperative cerebral CT scans showed ipsilateral infarction in 146 of 359 patients (40.6%). Ipsilateral infarction was most common in patients with stroke (76%) but was also seen in 32.8% of patients with transient ischemic attacks, in 9 of 40 patients (22.5%) with nonhemispheric symptoms, and in 9 of 45 patients (20%) with asymptomatic hemodynamically significant carotid stenosis. The postoperative stroke rate was not significantly increased by the presence of infarct on preoperative cerebral CT scan (2.6% vs 1.9%). New infarcts were seen on cerebral CT scanning after carotid endarterectomy in 2 of 89 patients with no detectable neurologic abnormality (2.3%). This study demonstrates a high frequency of ipsilateral infarction in patients having elective carotid endarterectomy, even in those patients with clinical symptom complexes thought by many physicians to be relatively benign (i.e., transient cerebral ischemia, nonhemispheric ischemia, and asymptomatic carotid stenoses).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "In situ saphenous vein bypass presents unique problems in wound management. A retrospective analysis of wound complications occurring after in situ bypass was undertaken in 93 patients who had 98 operations. For purposes of statistical analysis, only the first procedure was considered in patients having bilateral bypass. Fifty-nine percent of patients were male; the average age was 69 years. Medical risk factors surveyed included diabetes (64%), hypertension (52%), and smoking (53%). Ninety-one percent of the procedures were done for limb salvage; the mean ankle-brachial index was 0.43. Sixty percent of bypasses were infrapopliteal, and the mean duration of surgery was 4.6 hours. Continuous incision was used to expose the vein in 59% of cases. Skin closure was effected with staples in 44% and with sutures or both in the remainder. The mean postoperative hospital stay was 27 days. Wound problems developed in 31 cases, 11 of which were major. The thigh was the most common location. There was a significant association between continuous incision and anterior tibial bypass and wound complications. Anterior tibial bypass and staple closure were found to be independent predictors of wound problems with the use of stepwise logistic regression. Postoperative hospital stay was significantly prolonged; two bypasses failed and three lower extremities were amputated because of incisional complications. A discussion of the technical aspects of wound management is presented.\r"
