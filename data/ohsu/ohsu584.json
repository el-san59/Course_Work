  ".W": "The metabolic effects of a selective hepatic vagotomy (HV) were investigated at rest and immediately after a 50-min exercise period (26 m/min, 0% grade) in rats subjected to an overnight 50% food restriction. This dietary restriction reduced liver glycogen content to 50% of normal resting concentrations (2.2-2.8 g/100 g). No significant differences between HV and sham-operated rats were found in resting and exercising beta-hydroxybutyrate, glucose, glycerol, and insulin concentrations. Postexercise liver glycogen concentrations were reduced to approximately 1.0 g/100 g in both HV and sham-operated groups. This decrease was associated with significantly (P less than 0.01) lower postexercise glycogen levels in the soleus muscle of HV rats (2.6 times) along with higher plasma free fatty acid concentrations (P less than 0.01). These data provide evidence that HV combined with a progressive decrease in liver glycogen content may influence substrate regulation during exercise. They also support the concept of the existence of hepatic glucoreceptors responsive to a decrease in liver glycogen content.\r"

Keeping their knee and hip joint fully extended, five healthy subjects performed four kinds of noncountermovement jumps and one countermovement jump, during which ankle joint angle, platform force, and surface electromyograms of a triceps surae muscle were recorded. In the four noncountermovement jumps, the magnitude of activation and force at the onset of a shortening contraction of the triceps surae muscle were controlled at four different levels. Performance parameters of the noncountermovement jumps, maximum angular velocity of the ankle angle and flight time, correlated with the platform force at the onset of the plantar flexion. Furthermore the integrated electromyograms of the triceps surae muscle before the plantar flexion were correlated with the maximum angular velocity of the ankle angle and the force at the plantar flexion onset. The findings suggest that the efficient utilization of the muscle characteristic contributes to an enhancement of the noncountermovement jump.\r"

Consequences on gas exchange were also evaluated during a 15-min period of apnea by use of a tracheal insufflation of pure O2 at a constant flow rate of 20 l/min. The Jarvik-7 artificial heart generated a mean pulmonary volume displacement of 105 +/- 29 (SD) ml/heart beat. After 15 min of apnea, arterial PCO2 (PaCO2) significantly increased from 29 +/- 5 to 47 +/- 6 (SD) Torr. PaCO2 increased by 0.8 Torr/min from the 5th to the 15th min of apnea. Mean arterial PO2, mean pulmonary shunt, mean O2 consumption, and mean metabolic production of CO2 did not change significantly during the apnea period. Because cardiac output was kept constant during the study, O2 transport was adequately maintained throughout the apnea period. In patient 1, where the period of apnea was continued for 60 min, PaCO2 progressively increased until the 45th min and then remained stable at 61 Torr during the last 15 min of apnea. This \"plateau\" corresponded to an alveolar ventilation of 3,907 ml/min, representing 69% of the alveolar ventilation calculated during conventional mechanical ventilation. In conclusion, the Jarvik-7 artificial heart provides a potent respiratory support through the cardiogenic oscillations it generates.\r"

Seventeen male golden hamsters weighing 70-84 g were studied. Change in alveolar pressure (delta PA) was calculated from total gas volume and the respired volume difference through the flow sensor between the midpoints of the tidal excursion curve, reflecting the thorax movement. The ratio of delta PA to the flow difference between those two midpoints gave Raw. Raw was compared with pulmonary resistance, and inspiratory and expiratory resistances were also compared. Raw was 0.44 +/- 0.06 (SE) cmH2O.ml-1.s. Mean of the coefficients of variation of Raw was 19.6 +/- 3.2% (SE). Raw was well correlated with pulmonary resistance (r = 0.93). We demonstrated that Raw could be directly measured in small animals with a hot-wire flow sensor and a plethysmographic technique, and the values were well correlated with previously reported pulmonary resistance.\r"

However, the functional status of this system in newborns is not known. The NAIS of intestinal smooth muscle has been demonstrated in newborns and develops in parallel with cholinergic innervation (14). Since the lung is derived embryologically from the foregut and cholinergic innervation is operative at birth, we tested the hypothesis that NAIS innervation to the airways is functional in newborn cats. Nineteen cats (2-11 days of age) were anesthetized with chloralose-urethan, and a tracheal cannula was inserted. The chest was opened and the animals were mechanically ventilated. The cervical vagus nerves were separated from the sympathetics, cut, and placed on stimulating electrodes. Mean inspiratory resistance (RL, I) and dynamic compliance (Cdyn, L) were measured on a breath-by-breath basis. Atropine and propranolol were administered (2 mg/kg iv) to block cholinergic and adrenergic pathways, respectively. Subsequently, serotonin infusion was used to increase RL, I approximately 150%. Stimulation (10 s) at frequencies ranging from 2 to 20/s caused a slow-onset (30 s to peak) long-lasting decrease in RL, I and a much smaller increase in Cdyn, L. The magnitude and duration of the bronchodilation increased with stimulus frequency to a plateau at approximately 15/s. At a stimulus frequency of 2/s, RL, I decreased 11 +/- 1.9 vs 36 +/- 4.8% (SE) at 20/s, whereas Cdyn, L increased 2 +/- 1.1 vs. 6 +/- 1.7%, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The results of these investigations were compared, for all except one patient, with the pathological findings of transtrochanteric core biopsies of the femoral head and neck of both hips. Of the forty-nine hips, thirty-three had histological proof of osteonecrosis. Twenty-two (67 per cent) of these hips showed definite necrosis on the plain radiographs; eighteen (62 per cent), on the twenty-nine available computed tomographic scans; twenty-four (77 per cent), on the thirty-one available radionuclide bone scans; and all of the hips, on the magnetic resonance-imaging studies. In six additional hips, there were histological changes (marrow necrosis, edema, hemorrhage, and fibrosis) in the medullary spaces without detectable osteonecrosis. The plain radiographs and computed tomographic scans of these six hips were normal except for the computed tomographic scan of one, and the radionuclide uptake on bone-scanning was abnormal in four of the six, as were the magnetic resonance-imaging studies. In the two hips that had normal magnetic resonance-imaging studies, the biopsies showed only destruction of fat cells in the medullary spaces, with no edema or fibroblastic reaction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The accuracy of magnetic resonance imaging in the detection of osteonecrosis of the femoral head was compared with that of other diagnostic methods in current use: plain radiography, bone-marrow pressure determinations, intramedullary venography, and histological examination of core-biopsy bone specimens. In the first phase of the study, forty-eight patients (ninety-six hips) who were at high risk for avascular necrosis were studied. Abnormal patterns on magnetic resonance imaging, consistent with those seen in necrosis, were found in all hips that were suspected of having Ficat Stage-2 or 3 changes on the basis of radiographic evidence of the disease. Abnormal patterns on magnetic resonance imaging that were characteristic of avascular necrosis were also observed in 17 per cent of the hips that were suspected of having Ficat Stage-0 changes and in 64 per cent of those that showed Stage-1 changes, all with no radiographic changes. In the second phase of the study, twenty-three of the ninety-six hips that were suspected of having early-stage necrosis of the femoral head but showed slight or no radiographic changes were studied by repeat radiographs, Ficat functional evaluations of bone, core biopsies of the femoral head, and magnetic resonance imaging. Of the twenty-three hips, eighteen (78 per cent) had positive changes on magnetic resonance imaging; nineteen (83 per cent) had positive histological evidence of necrosis; and fourteen (61 per cent) had positive findings by bone-marrow pressure studies and intramedullary venography. Although false-negative and false-positive results were observed with magnetic resonance imaging, the over-all results of this study suggest that magnetic resonance imaging may be useful for the early diagnosis of avascular necrosis.\r"

In sixteen of the children, who were seen less than a month after the onset of symptoms, the subluxation reduced either spontaneously or after a short period of traction. Of the seven remaining children, who were seen more than one month after the onset of symptoms, three eventually needed a posterior atlanto-axial arthrodesis. Dynamic computed-tomography scans, with the head rotated maximally to each side, were made for five children, and proved to be an excellent method of documenting the presence of rotatory atlanto-axial subluxation.\r"

The resection arthroplasty effectively eradicated the sepsis in all but three patients, who had a recurrence. Pain was alleviated in nearly all of the patients, but the ability to walk and the level of activity improved only slightly. Shortening of the limb ranged from three to eleven centimeters, and all patients used a support for walking. The six patients who had a bilateral procedure were able to walk using double supports. With regard to relief of pain, walking, and function, the results were significantly poorer in the women, particularly the older ones. The results were also significantly inferior in the patients who had had sepsis after a total hip replacement. Generally, walking, function, and the level of activity were better when much of the proximal end of the femur had been retained. Resection arthroplasty should spare as much of the proximal end of the femur as possible if a future replacement of the hip is contemplated.\r"

The mean preoperative pressures were significantly higher in the patients who had carpal tunnel syndrome than in the patients in the control group when the pressures were measured under four conditions: with the wrist in the resting position, with active grip, and with maximum passive extension and flexion of the wrist. The mean pressures improved significantly postoperatively and were in the range of values that were found under each condition for the control group. Measurement of pressure in the carpal canal before and after operation may be useful in diagnosing carpal tunnel syndrome and in determining the effectiveness of endoscopic management.\r"

The results of 112 consecutive cemented total hip replacements that were performed after a medial-displacement intertrochanteric osteotomy had failed (the conversion group) were compared with the results of 262 consecutive primary total hip replacements with cement (the control group). The mean length of follow-up was fifty-six months for the first group and fifty-four months for the second. The mean time between the osteotomy and the total hip replacement was six years. Two hundred and four Muller prostheses and 170 Lubinus hip prostheses were used. Pain was satisfactorily relieved in 89 per cent of the group that had a conversion and in 91 per cent of the control group. There were only minor differences in the range of motion of the hip and in walking performance between the two groups. The femoral component was more frequently in a varus position in the control group (p less than 0.05). The radiographic findings, including migration of the stem and radiolucency around the stem, were not inferior in the group that had a conversion. The rate of intraoperative fracture was significantly greater in the group that had a conversion, and it was correlated with the amount of displacement of the osteotomy.

At the most recent follow-up (average, three years and seven months), according to the radiographic classification system of Severin, there were seven excellent, seventeen good, and eight fair results; one hip had a poor result. Avascular necrosis developed in three of the thirty-three hips. At follow-up, these hips had a radiographic result of excellent, good, and fair, respectively. Twenty-one patients (twenty-eight hips) were reviewed with respect to range of motion and recovery from limb-length discrepancy. According to the rating system of Ferguson and Howorth, there were seventeen excellent, seven good, and three fair results; one hip had a poor result. It was concluded that children who are two years or older and who have a congenital dislocation of the hip can safely be treated with an extensive one-stage operation consisting of open reduction combined with femoral shortening and, often, pelvic osteotomy, without increasing the risk of avascular necrosis. The limb-length discrepancy that is produced by the shortening does not appear to cause a clinical problem.\r"

First we examined the anatomy of the thoracic spine, specifically the laminar and interlaminar dimensions, as well as the epidural space. In the second part, we evaluated the depth of penetration of wires into the spinal canal at the time of their passage during spinal segmental instrumentation, using direct laboratory measurements for three configurations of the wire: first with a straight wire, and then with two wires of varying curvature. The measurements were repeated after removal of a portion of the lamina. In the third and final part of the study, we assessed the relationship between the observed penetration of the wires and the depth of penetration as calculated using mathematical models for the three wire configurations. When a wire with the largest possible diameter of curvature was passed under the lamina, there was significantly less penetration using the curved-wire configuration. This was seen in calculated models, as well as in normal specimens of the thoracic spine that were obtained from cadavera. Little epidural space was found to be available for passage of the wire. In most instances, passage of the wire must result in contact with and displacement of the dural sac and its contents. To minimize the depth of penetration at any given spinal level, it is recommended that the wire be curved to the maximum degree that will allow it to pass under the lamina.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The density of beta-adrenergic receptors in both the outer and inner layers of the human myometrium decreases during the last weeks of pregnancy. Although in preterm myometrium (32-35 weeks of pregnancy) beta-adrenergic receptors are positively coupled to adenylate cyclase, we found that isoproterenol, epinephrine, and norepinephrine did not stimulate the enzyme in the inner or outer myometrial layer at term (39-40 weeks of pregnancy). At this stage, the addition of 10(-4) mol/L guanyl-5'-imidodiphosphate increased (from 10(-8) to 10(-4) mol/L) basal adenylate cyclase activity in a dose-dependent manner, indicating that the catalytic component of the enzyme remains linked to the stimulatory guanyl nucleotide binding protein (Gs). Compared to the preterm response, at term the myometrial adenylate cyclase response to 10(-4) mol/L guanyl-5'-imidodiphosphate was decreased, which may reflect a decrease in the amount of functional Gs. Altogether these changes are consistent with reduced Gs coupling to the catalytic component. However, the similarity of the responses of preterm and term myometrium to forskolin excluded the possibility of an alteration of the catalytic component of adenylate cyclase during the last weeks of pregnancy. The fact that a stimulatory effect of isoproterenol on adenylate cyclase was found after islet-activating protein pretreatment indicates that human term myometrium contains a functional inhibitory guanyl nucleotide binding protein which is involved in the modulation of the beta-adrenergic adenylate cyclase response. Our data suggest that modifications in the coupling mechanisms between receptors and the catalytic component are implicated in the loss of beta-adrenergic adenylate cyclase stimulation in the myometrium at the end of pregnancy.\r"

Hybridization of BglII-digested DNA with TCR beta probe revealed two alleles of 9.3 and 8.6 kilobases. The allele frequency of 8.6 kilobases in Graves' disease (79%) and Hashimoto's thyroiditis (76%) was significantly higher (P less than 0.01 and P less than 0.05, respectively) than that in controls (64%).

To test this supposition we measured serum 3 alpha-diol G concentrations in 23 women with congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency, including 13 with the salt-losing and 10 with the simple virilizing form, while they were receiving glucocorticoid and, in some cases, mineralocorticoid therapy. Their mean age was 28.3 yr (range, 17.9-38.7 yr). Twenty-four-hour urinary 17-ketosteroid excretion, plasma androstenedione and testosterone levels, and serum 3 alpha-diol G levels were measured during the follicular phase. The values were within or below the normal range in 87%, 78%, 70%, and 91% of the patients, respectively. By contrast, plasma 17-hydroxyprogesterone levels were normal in only 12% of the patients. Serum 3 alpha-diol G levels correlated well with 24-h urinary 17-ketosteroid excretion (r = 0.75) and plasma 17-hydroxyprogesterone (r = 0.77), androstenedione (r = 0.84), and testosterone (r = 0.93) levels. The serum 3 alpha-diol G levels were not significantly different in the women with the salt-losing form and those with the simple virilizing form. However, they were significantly lower (P less than 0.05) in the women with normal menses compared to those with abnormal menses. This finding underscores the validity of serum 3 alpha-diol G measurements as indicators of androgen production and metabolism in women. The excellent correlation between the serum 3 alpha-diol G levels and standard measures of control indicates that the former measurement may be a useful adjunct in the management of women with congenital adrenal hyperplasia.\r"

  ".W": "The contribution of diabetes and cirrhosis to sexual dysfunction and hypogonadism was evaluated by two-way analysis of variance in a group of 30 men with idiopathic hemochromatosis. The prevalence of severe sexual dysfunction was significantly higher in men with hemochromatosis than in a control group matched for prevalence of diabetes and age (P less than 0.001). In both controls and hemochromatosis patients the presence of diabetes was significantly associated with sexual dysfunction (P less than 0.005), but the more severe symptoms in the hemochromatosis patients were related to the additive effects of hypoandrogenism (P less than 0.01). Sexual dysfunction was a common early complaint in hemochromatosis patients, but these symptoms were frequently overlooked, leading to diagnostic delay. Mean testicular volume was a useful measure of gonadal status, being significantly correlated with indices of serum free testosterone (rs = 0.83; P less than 0.01) and LH (rs = 0.71; P less than 0.001). The presence of cirrhosis did not contribute significantly to symptomatology, but had an effect independent of and additive to hypogonadotropic hypogonadism in reducing serum free testosterone (P less than 0.02) and estradiol (P less than 0.002), an effect apparently mediated through central rather than testicular mechanisms. Hypoandrogenism was associated with an increase in serum sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) concentrations (P less than 0.005), but cirrhosis also had an independent effect in raising SHBG (P less than 0.005), which could not be accounted for by changes in circulating sex hormone concentrations. Thus, the evaluation of sexual dysfunction or hypogonadism in men with hemochromatosis requires consideration of the effects of both diabetes and cirrhosis. Because of the greater variance in SHBG some estimate of free testosterone rather than total testosterone is preferable.\r"

  ".W": "We studied the subunit structure of the human TSH receptor in thyroid tissue from patients with Graves' disease and multinodular goiter by TSH affinity chromatography, immunoprecipitation with Graves' immunoglobulins (Igs), and a modified technique of Western blotting. Human TSH receptor-binding activity was purified about 1,270-fold by sequential affinity chromatography on wheat germ lectin-agarose and TSH-agarose. Analysis by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of nonreduced affinity-purified receptors eluted in sodium dodecyl sulfate sample buffer revealed three noncovalently linked subunits of 70,000, 50,000, and 35,000 mol wt. When reduced, a major subunit of 25,000 mol wt was identified. When 3 mol/L NaCl was used to elute affinity-purified receptors only the 50,000 mol wt nonreduced subunit was detected. This subunit bound [125I]bovine TSH and was precipitated by Graves' Igs. Modifications to the conventional Western blotting technique enabled thyroglobulin components (approximately 220,000 mol wt), thyroid microsomal antigen (a doublet of approximately 110,000 mol wt), and putative TSH receptor subunits of 70,000 and 50,000 mol wt to be identified in thyroid particulate membranes by Graves' Igs. Blotting of affinity-purified receptors eluted in sodium dodecyl sulfate sample buffer revealed subunits of either 70,000 or 50,000 mol wt, with a minority of Graves' serum samples. We conclude that the nonreduced human TSH receptor is an oligomeric complex comprising three different subunits of 70,000, 50,000, and 35,000 mol wt. The reduced receptor exists as a single subunit of 25,000 mol wt, which may be disulfide linked to form the higher mol wt forms. The 70,000 and 50,000 mol wt subunits contain epitopes that bind Graves' Igs in modified Western blots, thus directly confirming that the human TSH receptor is a target for Graves' Igs.\r"

  ".W": "We used a ribonuclease cleavage assay to screen for insulin receptor mRNA sequence alterations in 12 patients with syndromes of severe insulin resistance. Uniformly labeled [32P]antisense RNA probes complementary to insulin receptor mRNA were prepared by an SP6 or T7 RNA polymerase transcription reaction. Four probes ranging in size from 670-1470 bases were used to examine the entire 4.2-kilobase receptor protein-coding region. Patient RNA samples were hybridized to individual probes in solution, and mismatched sequences were detected by susceptibility to cleavage by a mixture of RNAses A and T1. The method was validated with insulin receptor mRNAs from cells transfected with cDNA constructs bearing known point and deletion mutations. Alterations in the insulin receptor mRNA sequence of two patients were detected. A patient with the type A syndrome of severe insulin resistance (A2-Boston) had a mutation in the insulin receptor beta-subunit mRNA sequence that localized to the region coding for amino acid residues 1174-1211 near the tyrosine kinase domain. The second alteration was a sequence polymorphism in the insulin receptor alpha-subunit mRNA in a patient with lipoatropic diabetes (LA-2) that localized to a region within amino acids 268-272. Direct sequence analysis revealed that the ribonuclease cleavage sites in patients A2-Boston and LA-2 were due to distinct single base changes in the insulin receptor gene and mRNA. Additional insulin receptor mRNA sequence polymorphisms were also identified as mismatches between the labeled RNA probes used and mRNA from several cultured human cell types. This study demonstrates that ribonuclease cleavage can rapidly detect and localize insulin receptor mRNA sequence mutations and polymorphic variations as small as single base changes. Further analysis of insulin receptor mRNA sequence alterations identified in this way may elucidate a possible genetic basis for functional insulin receptor defects in patients with severe insulin resistance and can also reveal some insulin receptor sequence polymorphisms that occur in the population at large.\r"

  ".W": "Daily glucocorticoid therapy of children with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) frequently results in a suboptimal mature height. In contrast, pharmacological doses of prednisone given on alternate days generally allow normal growth in children with autoimmune, hematological, and renal disorders. Moreover, alternate day prednisone therapy suppresses adrenal androgen secretion on both the day on and the day off therapy in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus. We hypothesized that alternate day prednisone therapy might be efficacious in the treatment of CAH. To evaluate this hypothesis, we studied an 11-yr-old girl with salt-losing 21-hydroxylase deficiency and severe asthma treated with alternate day prednisone therapy (20 mg every other day) for over 3 yr. During this period her linear growth was along the 65th percentile, and her bone age paralleled her chronological age. Pubertal development was normal, and she had no signs of androgen or glucocorticoid excess. In keeping with her clinical picture, basal (24-h samples drawn every 60 min) and ovine CRH-stimulated plasma adrenal androgen (dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate and delta 4-androstenedione) concentrations and 24-h urinary 17-ketosteroid excretion were low on both the day on and the day off prednisone. However, her plasma ACTH and 17-hydroxyprogesterone levels were markedly elevated on both days. The adrenal androgen suppression, therefore, appeared independent of the level of ACTH, suggesting different regulation of the zona fasciculata and the zona reticularis. GH secretion, assessed by measurement of plasma GH every 20 min for 48 h, was normal on both the on and off days of prednisone therapy. Therefore, in this girl pharmacological doses of prednisone given on alternate days caused sustained adrenal androgen suppression and allowed normal growth and pubertal development, despite persistently elevated plasma ACTH and 17-hydroxyprogesterone levels.\r"

  ".W": "Testosterone (T) is a protein-bound substance, the hepatic extraction of which largely exceeds the free plasma fraction. In this study we attempted to determine if the dissociation of T from plasma proteins is the limiting factor for testosterone hepatic uptake in patients with cirrhosis. For this purpose we measured the hepatic uptake of T and the peripheral plasma concentrations of the different fractions of the hormone (total, free, albumin-bound, and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG)-bound) in 12 men with alcoholic cirrhosis. The hepatic extraction of T (mean = 42%) greatly exceeded the non-SHBG-bound fraction of T (free T plus albumin-bound T: mean = 13%). Thus, a substantial amount of SHBG-bound T must have entered the liver. A theoretical extraction ratio was calculated based upon the dissociation rate constants of T from albumin and SHBG and upon an estimate of sinusoidal transit time of plasma through the liver. The similarity between the measured and expected values indicates that the limiting step in hepatic uptake of T might be SHBG binding.\r"

  ".W": "Androgen secretion by the fetal testis is essential for male phenotypic differentiation. In the human fetus testosterone formation is initiated soon after the differentiation of the testis (approximately 8 weeks of gestation), and the maximal testosterone content in fetal testes is achieved between 10 and 15 weeks of fetal life. The testosterone content of the fetal testis declines at the beginning of the third trimester and remains low until after birth. In an effort to understand the regulation of the onset of testosterone formation in the human fetal testis we measured adenylate cyclase activity in response to hCG stimulation in homogenates of fetal testes obtained from first and second trimester human abortuses. Basal adenylate cyclase activity was 50 pmol/mg protein.min at 10 weeks gestation, the peak activity was 137 pmol/mg protein.min at 12 weeks gestation, and activity declined thereafter to 8 pmol/mg protein.min by 16 weeks gestation. NaF-stimulated (0.6 mmol/L) and forskolin-stimulated (50 mumol/L) activities were 4- to 8-fold greater than basal adenylate cyclase activities. The maximal forskolin-stimulated activity occurred at 11 weeks (803 pmol/mg protein.min), and it fell to 35 pmol/mg protein.min by 17 weeks gestation. In contrast, hCG-stimulated (1 mumol/L) adenylate cyclase activity was only slightly greater than basal rates at all ages examined. In addition, hCG did not stimulate baseline testosterone formation in minces of testes obtained between 12 and 18 weeks of gestation. These findings suggest that the onset of testosterone formation in human fetal testes may be independent of gonadotropin control.\r"

The E peptide regions extend the carboxy-terminus of IGF-I by either an additional 35 (IGF-IA) or 77 (IGF-IB) amino acids. With a specific and sensitive RIA employing an antiserum directed against a synthetic peptide that is unique to the E peptide region of IGF-IA prohormone (EIA), we have identified EIA-immunoreactive material in the conditioned medium of fetal and postnatal human fibroblasts in culture. Incubation of postnatal human fibroblasts with GH increased specific immunoreactive EIA secretion 2- to 3-fold. There was no immunologically detectable 7.5K IGF-I or IGF-II peptide in acid-chromatographed human fibroblast-conditioned medium under either basal or GH-stimulated conditions. Acid chromatography of human fibroblast-conditioned medium on Sephadex G-75 revealed a single elution peak of EIA immunoreactivity corresponding to a mol wt of 9-17 K. With neutral chromatography, EIA immunoreactivity eluted at 25-38K mol wt. These data suggest that the E peptide region of IGF-IA is translated and released as part of the prohormone form in cultured human fibroblasts, and that the levels of this prohormone are regulated by GH.\r"

  ".W": "Graves' disease may result eventually in hypothyroidism in approximately 5-20% of patients. In a few such patients hypothyroidism was associated with TSH-blocking antibodies, but whether the frequency of TSH-blocking antibodies in such patients is as high as it is (21%) in patients with primary myxedema is not known. This study was undertaken to determine the presence of various immunoglobulins [TSH binding inhibitor immunoglobulins, thyroid-stimulating antibodies (TSAb), and TSH-blocking antibodies] in 26 patients with Graves' disease who developed hypothyroidism from 0.5-10 yr or more after discontinuation of antithyroid drug therapy. Eight of the 26 patients (31%) had TSH-blocking antibodies, 16 (61%) had TSAb, and 14 (54%) had thyroid hormone binding inhibitor immunoglobulins. Thyroid needle biopsies were performed in 9 patients. Three of 5 patients who had subclinical hypothyroidism had chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis, and all had positive TSAb titers. Three patients had the fibrous variant of chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis; their TSAb values were 902%, 431%, and 1290%. One patient had follicular hyperplasia. We conclude that TSH-blocking antibodies may account for hypothyroidism in approximately one third of patients with Graves' disease who were previously treated with antithyroid drugs, and that autoimmune thyroiditis is comparable for the hypothyroidism in the remaining two thirds of Graves' disease patients.\r"

  ".W": "To demonstrate the existence and help clarify the function of angiotensin II (Ang II) receptors in the human heart, we characterized the cardiac Ang II receptor and examined the levels and distribution of ventricular Ang II receptors in normal (n = 6) and failing (n = 14) hearts. Ang II receptors were characterized using the Ang II receptor agonist [125I]Ang II. Cardiac [125I]Ang II-binding sites were of high affinity (Kd, approximately 1 nmol/L) and low capacity (Bmax, approximately 3 fmol/mg membrane protein) and were pharmacologically specific [IC50 values for Ang II, [Sar1,Ile8]Ang II, and Ang III were 1.2, 3.0, and 400 nmol/L, respectively; the inactive Ang II metabolite Ang-(1-5), at a concentration of 1 mumol/L, inhibited [125I]Ang II binding by less than 10%]. These characteristics of cardiac [125I]Ang II-binding sites are similar to those of previously characterized mammalian heart Ang II receptors. In normal adult donor hearts (n = 5), Ang II receptor density in the left ventricle [LV, 2.90 +/- 1.40 (+/- SE) fmol/mg] was similar to that in the right ventricle (RV, 3.82 +/- 1.10 fmol/mg). The ventricular Ang II receptor density in adult patients with idiopathic (LV, 1.77 +/- 0.35 fmol/mg; RV, 1.58 +/- 0.29 fmol/mg; n = 8) or dilated cardiomyopathy (LV, 2.00 +/- 0.58 fmol/mg; RV, 2.56 +/- 0.52 fmol/mg n = 5) was similar to that in the normal heart. Ventricular Ang II receptors, localized by autoradiography using the Ang II receptor antagonist [125I]-[Sar1,Ile8]Ang II, were consistently found in the myocardium, cardiac adrenergic nerves, and coronary vessels of normal and failing ventricles. In human ventricles Ang II receptor levels were not correlated with age. Because ventricular Ang II receptor density in a normal neonatal human heart and that in a heart from an adolescent patient with idiopathic cardiomyopathy were more than 10-fold and more than 5-fold higher, respectively, than in normal adult ventricles, we investigated whether postnatal changes occur in ventricular Ang II receptors in rats. In male and female rats ventricular Ang II receptor density was about 2-fold higher in 1-day-old rats compared to that in 10-day-old or peripubertal rats. These data suggest developmental regulation of ventricular Ang II receptors. Our findings suggest that direct and neural angiotensinergic inputs to the myocardium play a role in the regulation of cardiac function in man and that these inputs are preserved in the failing heart.\r"

The time course of the response and the presence of normal responses in two vagotomized subjects suggest that neither traditional gut hormones nor vagus nerve activity is involved in this response. Of the single amino acids tested, phenylalanine and tyrosine were the most potent stimulators of PRL secretion and can account for most, if not all, of the PRL-releasing activity of the mixed meal. D-Phenylalanine, the biologically inactive optical isomer, was nearly ineffective in releasing PRL. Administration of naloxone, phentolamine, or propranolol did not alter the PRL response to the various test meals, indicating that neither opioid, alpha-adrenergic, nor beta-adrenergic stimulation is involved in meal-induced PRL secretion.\r"

The incorporation of 3H-labeled thymidine, amino acids, and glucosamine into DNA, protein, and glycosaminoglycans, respectively, was measured. TSH and the serum of each of the 20 patients with Graves' dermopathy markedly stimulated the synthesis of DNA, protein, and glycosaminoglycans by FRTL cells, but not by fibroblasts, whereas assays of serum from 38 of 40 patients with Graves' disease without dermopathy did not stimulate these processes in FRTL cells more than normal serum. Stimulatory activity was associated with immunoglobulins. Serum dermopathy-associated antibodies disappeared with the disappearance of the skin lesions. These results suggest that the serum of patients with dermopathy contains antibodies that recognize a component of the TSH receptor different from that recognized by serum of Graves' patients without dermopathy, the former acting in some manner to induce lesions in pretibial skin. The skin target remains unidentified.\r"

These were combined to make an overall prediction of the probability of a cholesteatoma in the middle ear. The results showed that any polyp that (i) was composed of raw granulation tissue and (ii) contained keratin as flakes or masses had a 70-80% probability of being associated with an underlying cholesteatoma. In contrast, when a polyp (i) was composed of a fibrous core, (ii) had a covering epithelium, and (iii) contained glands and lymphoid aggregates, there was a 70-80% probability of cholesteatoma being absent. This scoring system can be used to help surgeons decide whether surgical exploration of the mastoid should be undertaken.\r"

The data were compared with those obtained in eight adenoid cystic carcinomas of salivary glands and in ductal carcinomas of the breast with a cribriform growth pattern. The patients' ages were as follows: 45-80 years (mean 63.2) for the salivary gland carcinomas; 37-69 years (mean 50.6) for the ductal breast carcinomas. In contrast to the cribriform spaces of ductal carcinomas, the pseudocysts in adenoid cystic carcinomas were lined by type IV collagen. The opposite pattern was observed for EMA. Like the myoepithelium of normal breast, the myoepithelium-like cells of adenoid cystic carcinoma stained positive for vimentin while the ductular epithelium-like ones did not. All adenoid cystic carcinomas, including that of the breast, were negative for the oestrogen and progesterone receptors, unlike the ductal carcinomas. Proliferative activity of the adenoid cystic carcinoma of the breast was relatively low. These data broaden the range of antibodies suitable for differential diagnosis of both tumour types. They may explain the differences in prognosis, and they explain why hormonal treatment or radiotherapy of adenoid cystic carcinoma of the breast are often ineffectual.\r"

There was no correlation between whole blood procoagulant activity and absolute monocyte counts, with histological staging or with plasma concentrations of plasma fibrinopeptide A.

In these patients DI measurements were of value when carried out together with conventional chromsomal analysis in gaining the maximum amount of genetic information when a satisfactory karyotype might not be available or where failure of an abnormal cell population to proliferate might give an incomplete cytogenetic picture.

Isolates from 15 patients with endocarditis were uniformly negative, although 13 of 25 (52%) isolates from dental plaque produced the enzyme.

  ".W": "In an outbreak of diarrhoeal disease in an orthopaedic ward Clostridium difficile was isolated from all six patients with diarrhoea. Attempts were made to type these isolates by means of antibiogram, detection of pre-formed enzymes, analysis of surface proteins by sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and immunoblotting, and plasmid profile analysis. This showed that a single strain (type E) indistinguishable by the four distinct methods of typing, was isolated from all six patients at some time during their episodes of diarrhoea. Relapse was caused by the acquisition of a new strain in two patients, and by re-emergence or reacquisition of the original strain in two patients. The immunochemical method was the most sensitive and discriminatory of the typing strategies adopted.\r"

In the in situ hybridisation experiments radioactive and non-radioactive (labelled with 2-acetyl-aminofluorene, AAF) DNA probes were used. B19-DNA was detectable in paraffin wax embedded fetal tissue from the liver, heart, lung, brain and thymus. The resolution with the AAF-labelled probes was higher than with the radiolabelled DNA. Parvovirus B19 DNA sequences were also detected in these tissues by an enzymatic in vitro amplification technique--the polymerase chain reaction. Amplification of a B19-DNA sequence before detection increases the rapidity and sensitivity of detection. The rapid, specific, and sensitive analysis of parvovirus B19 in normal and diseased tissues using these techniques may contribute considerably to determining the role of this virus as a risk factor in the outcome of pregnancy.\r"

A questionnaire distributed to participants showed that a wide range of methods are commonly used, some of which are contrary to good practice. As the scheme continues, selection of organisms considered to be relevant and of use to participants will become difficult.\r"

All patients in both groups had a history of venom anaphylaxis, most with cardiovascular and/or respiratory symptoms and initial elevated serum venom-specific IgE; all patients received VIT. The groups were closely matched for age, sex, nature of initial sting reaction, and insect identification. In the group with low-level RAST titers, the duration of VIT was 6 months to 5 years (mean 2 1/2 years). Re-stings occurred from 1 month to 7 years (mean 2.2 years) after cessation of therapy. There were 75 re-stings in 41 patients with four systemic reactions (10% per patient and 5% per sting). All four reacting patients had tolerated several stings during cessation of VIT before the re-sting systemic reaction; two patients had subsequent stings with no reaction. In the group of patients who stopped VIT for other reasons, the duration of VIT was 5 months to 4 years (mean 1.8 years). Re-stings occurred from 4 months to 6 years (mean 2.1 years) after stopping therapy. There were 74 re-stings in 38 patients with seven systemic reactions in four patients (9.5% per patient and 10.5% per sting). Two of the reacting patients had tolerated stings before the re-sting reaction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

They have the same molecular weight (MW) (15 kd) on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, they have similar amino acid compositions, and their N-terminal amino acid sequences differ in only four of the first 35 residues. An excellent correlation was observed between IgE antibody to Der f II and Der p II measured in sera from 65 mite-allergic patients (r = 0.94; p less than 0.001) and between quantitative intradermal skin tests to both allergens. A third allergen (Der f III, MW 29 kd) was purified from D. farinae by repeated gel filtration. In sera from 51 mite-allergic patients, IgE antibody to Der f II, Der f III, and previously purified Der f I (MW 24 kd) was detected in 92%, 16%, and 78% of the sera by radioimmunoassay, respectively. Most patients, 41/51 (80%), demonstrated IgE antibody to more than one allergen. With monoclonal antibodies fully cross-reactive with Der f II and Der p II, a two-site immunoassay was developed for measuring absolute quantities (nanograms or micrograms) of these allergens. In extracts rich in mite-fecal material (n = 5), Der f I and Der p I (group I allergens) and Der f II and Der p II (group II allergens) were measured in ratios of 11:1 to 35:1. Lower ratios (1.1:1 to 7:1) were observed in mite body extracts (n = 6). These experiments clearly define a second group of major dust mite allergens that demonstrate extensive structural and antigenic homology.\r"

Nasal challenges were repeated and supplemented by cytologic examination of the nasal secretions (NSs). The cytologic examination of NS was also performed during 164 control challenges with phosphate-buffered saline. The positive LNR was accompanied by significant changes in the count of neutrophils in 84% of the cases (increase immediately before and decrease during appearance of LNR, with increase again during resolving of late nasal response), of eosinophils in 58% (increase immediately before and decrease during appearance of LNR), of epithelial cells in 73% (increase followed by decrease, running parallel with LNR), of goblet cells in 63% (increase followed by decrease), of basophils in 8%, and of lymphocytes in 6% (both of these cells demonstrated a slight increase during LNR) in the NS. No significant changes in the count of other types of cells in the NS during most of the LNR cases were recorded. Most cases of negative response were not accompanied by significant changes in the count of individual cell types. No significant changes in the count of any cell type in the NS were recorded in any patient during the phosphate-buffered saline-control challenges. The cytologic examination of NS, accompanying the nasal challenge with allergen, appears therefore to be a valuable supplementary diagnostic parameter for the LNR and a promising model for further immunologic and clinical studies of the LNR.\r"

Five adult SSAs with stable asthma who had multiple prior reactions to double-blind, placebo-controlled, sulfite-capsule challenges were studied. Each patient ingested, in a double-blind, placebo-controlled fashion, four portions of lettuce (3 oz) pretreated with one of two commercially available, nearly identical vegetable fresheners. One freshener contained sodium bisulfite and was used on one portion of lettuce. The other freshener contained no sulfite and was used on three portions of lettuce. The fresheners were prepared and the lettuce was treated according to label instructions. After baseline spirometry, the SSAs consumed the lettuce samples with the same dressing of their choice, serial spirometry was performed, and a positive reaction was defined as a greater than 20% drop in FEV1 decreased 0% to 7%; mean, 3%. Two of the subjects experienced severe reactions to the sulfite-treated lettuce. One of these reactions was life threatening; the other reaction occurred despite placing only 30% of the usual sulfite dose on the lettuce. This study has demonstrated that sulfite-treated lettuce is capable of provoking bronchospasm in SSAs and suggests that such food is one cause of restaurant-provoked asthma in these individuals.\r"

To determine whether this was a practical concern in the normal clinical setting, we studied 20 adults and 20 children who had skin prick tests positive (3+ or more) to short ragweed. These patients were skin tested in duplicate at 8 AM and at 4 PM with fivefold serial dilutions of short ragweed extracts (1:20 to 1:12,500, wt/vol) and of histamine hydrochloride (10 to 0.016 mg/ml). Areas of wheal and flare were recorded and measured by computed planimetry. In addition, results were also read according to a conventional scoring system. Mean wheal and erythema areas with ragweed and histamine at each dilution were compared between morning and their corresponding evening values. Although there was a trend for the morning means to be larger than evening means, no significant differences between the two sessions were observed at any dilution. Mean morning skin index scores, as calculated from the combined mean wheal and erythema areas, were larger than mean evening scores for ragweed and histamine, but the differences were not of a degree to be clinically important. This observation was also true for conventional scores. Comparing the results from the two groups of children who had their first set of skin tests performed either in the morning or afternoon session indicated that there was no evidence of a refractory state of the skin during the second test sessions.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Responses were received from 1293 physicians who reported a total of 2573 patients being treated in 28 states. Most patients were from the southeast, but some patients were reported to be receiving IFA immunotherapy in areas outside the boundaries of known IFA infestation. Although IFA is a widespread health hazard in the southeast, it appears to exert an uneven impact on allergy practice in this region. Of the 1293 physicians responding to the survey, 117 (9%) reported the use of whole body extract (WBE) in the treatment of 1746 patients with winged Hymenoptera-sting allergy. Continued use of WBE immunotherapy was reported by physicians from all regions of the United States and from Canada. The largest numbers of patients receiving winged WBE immunotherapy were reported from Texas (641), Pennsylvania (246), Florida (129), and Canada (127). The results of this survey suggest a need for continuing medical education regarding (1) the magnitude of the health hazard posed by the IFA and (2) the efficacy of venom versus WBE in the treatment of winged Hymenoptera-sting allergy.\r"

Some sensitive individuals report only occasional allergic symptoms after shrimp ingestion, suggesting that there may be species-specific allergens. To investigate this possibility, we evaluated shrimp species-specific reactivity in 31 individuals with a history of immediate hypersensitivity reactions after shrimp ingestion with skin prick tests and RASTs with white and brown shrimp extracts. On selected individuals, RAST-inhibition studies were performed with white shrimp and/or brown shrimp-coupled disks, with white and/or brown shrimp extracts as inhibiting allergen. Positive skin tests to both types of extract were observed in 77% (23/30) of the subjects; one individual reacted to brown shrimp extract only. Elevated RASTs to both extracts were observed in 16/31 study participants; one subject reacted only to white shrimp extracts and two subjects to brown shrimp extract alone. Sera from two individuals tested by RAST inhibition recognized qualitatively different allergens in brown and white shrimp extracts, supporting the hypothesis that there are species-specific shrimp allergens. Species specificity is important because it may explain the intermittent symptoms of some study subjects. The percentage of shrimp-sensitive subjects testing positive by skin test and RAST can be increased by use of extracts from more than one species of shrimp.\r"

We have assessed the effect of topical capsaicin pretreatment on the responses to intradermal injections of histamine and platelet-activating factor (PAF) in six normal subjects, and of prostaglandin E2, histamine, and antigen in 10 atopic subjects. Capsaicin pretreatment caused significant inhibition of the immediate flare response to histamine in both normal (19.8 +/- 2.6 to 7.3 +/- 2.9 cm2 at 5 minutes; p less than 0.01) and atopic subjects (16.5 +/- 1.4 to 10.3 +/- 1.9 cm2 at 5 minutes; p less than 0.01). The PAF-induced flare was also inhibited from 12.2 +/- 2.9 to 2.7 +/- 1.6 cm2 at 5 minutes after injection (p less than 0.01). In contrast, capsaicin pretreatment did not significantly alter the flare responses to prostaglandin E2 or antigen in atopic subjects. The acute wheal responses to all stimuli were unchanged, as was the late-phase response to antigen. These results support the hypothesis that the cutaneous vasodilator effect of histamine and PAF may be mediated by a local axon reflex involving the release of neuropeptides from sensory nerves. A consistent effect of capsaicin pretreatment on the flare response induced by endogenous mediators released during a cutaneous IgE-mediated response was not observed. Increases in microvascular permeability and the late-phase response to antigen are independent of neuropeptide release from cutaneous nerves.\r"

At least 52 antigens (Ags), of which 47 migrated toward the anode, and five, toward the cathode, were revealed. Crossed radioimmunoelectrophoretic analysis performed with sera from 32 patients allergic to Bermuda grass and a pool from 1000 normal individuals revealed specific IgE binding to 13 of these Ags. The approximate molecular weights (MWs) for 10 of these IgE-binding Ags were determined by a combination of gel filtration and immunochemical analysis. These Ags had apparent MWs greater than 14 kd. A combination of preparative sucrose gradient isoelectric focusing and immunochemical analysis was used to determine the approximate isoelectric point values of five of the IgE-binding Ags. Most precipitating Ags had isoelectric points between 4.5 and 5.5. Four of the Ags (Ag 24, MW, less than 65 kd; Ag 31, MW, 33 kd; Ag 33, MW, 20 kd; and Ag 34/35, MW, 32 kd) were classified as major allergens.\r"

  ".W": "Rubber hypersensitivity is well described but usually as a contact dermatitis caused by chemicals added during the process of making natural latex or synthetic rubber. IgE-mediated reactions, mainly contact urticaria, have rarely been reported in Europe. We report a case of immediate hypersensitivity to latex. A 34-year-old female operating room nurse developed hand eczema to natural latex. On two occasions, while she was gloving for surgery, she had the following reactions: flushing, tachycardia, urticaria, angioedema, wheezing, and light-headedness. Prick and patch testing to thiuram mix, mercaptobenzothiazole, phenylenediamine mix, and carbamate mix (common rubber additives) were negative. Prick tests to natural latex elicited a 4+ reaction associated with immediate flushing, tachycardia, urticaria, and light-headedness. Five control subjects did not react. IgE antibodies to latex by RAST demonstrated 17.7% binding (control, 4%). This case demonstrates that natural latex can cause IgE-mediated symptoms. The route of exposure was cutaneous absorption of relevant latex allergens. As the use of latex rubber products continues to escalate, more cases are likely to occur.\r"

  ".U": "89278645\r", 
  ".W": "The major secreted proteinase of Entamoeba histolytica, a 56-kDa neutral cysteine proteinase, activates C by cleaving C3. The action of the proteinase is similar to C-derived C3 convertases because it produces a single cleavage of the alpha-chain in a dose- and time-dependent manner and cleaves C3 between residues 78 and 79, only one amino acid residue distal to the natural site acted on by the C3 convertases. C3a generation was detected by RIA. The 105-kDa fragment produced by the cleavage of the alpha-chain was structurally and functionally equivalent to the alpha'-chain of C3b, as demonstrated by susceptibility to the action of factors I and H and participation in the activation of the alternative pathway of C. Activation of C by the 56-kDa neutral cysteine proteinase may play a role in the early inflammatory response in amebic lesions and thus contribute to the pathogenesis of invasive amebiasis.\r"

  ".W": "Although studies to date have demonstrated the ability of the monocyte/macrophage to produce C components in vitro, very few studies on C production by nonhepatic tissue cells have been reported. Recently, using 35S-methionine incorporation and immunoprecipitation techniques our laboratory has demonstrated the ability of tissue cells, i.e., the human lung type II pneumocyte (A549) and human lung fibroblast (WI-38), to synthesize and secrete a variety of early and terminal complement components, as well as several regulatory proteins in vitro, i.e., C1r, C1s, C4, C3, C5, C6, C7, C8, C9, factor B, factor H, factor I, and C1s inactivator. In our studies, we extended these observations by demonstrating the capability of LPS to modulate C3 production by A549 pneumocytes. Specifically, using a sensitive ELISA we demonstrated that A549 pneumocytes exposed to LPS induced an 80 to 180% increase in C3 levels when compared to untreated A549 cells. Interestingly, LPS had no effect on C5 production or total protein synthesis by A549 pneumocytes. In the case of the WI-38 fibroblast, LPS had no effect on 1) C3 production, 2) C5 production, or 3) total protein synthesis in vitro. These studies demonstrate that agents such as LPS have the potential to selectively regulate C production (i.e., C3) in individual lung cells in vitro, and suggests that in vivo LPS may alter the local tissue reservoir of C components during infection and lung injury, thus impacting on pulmonary inflammation and host defense.\r"

  ".W": "The physical association of HLA class I and class II Ag in the membranes of PGF and JY lymphoblastoid cell lines was studied using flow cytometric energy transfer. This technique measures the proximity of cell surface molecules in the nm range and provides a distribution histogram of the average proximity of molecules on each cell of a population. HLA Ag were labeled with mAb conjugated to fluorescein, serving as donor, or tetramethylrhodamine, serving as acceptor molecules. Significant fluorescence energy transfer was detected between various combinations of class I and class II molecules indicating that these molecules are within 10 nanometers of each other. Specifically, energy transfer was observed between class I molecules and DR, DQ, or DP class II HLA molecules. In addition, energy transfer between all combinations of DR, DQ, and DP molecules was observed. No transfer was observed among class I molecules or among DR or among DP molecules. Among DQ molecules, subpopulations transferred fluorescence energy to each other. The close contact measured between class I and class II Ag correlates with previous reports of cocapping and may reflect an immunologically significant interaction or the reported tendency of class I Ag to associate with other cell surface receptors, including growth factor receptors. The energy transfer between fluorescent antibodies to class II Ag suggests the existence of heterodimers formed from the different locus products, as well as possible quaternary surface interactions between alpha/beta complexes from separate loci.\r"

  ".W": "Multiple mAb to human C-reactive protein (CRP) were prepared which reacted preferentially with either native CRP, modified CRP (expressing \"neo-CRP\" determinants) or both forms of the molecule. These mAb were divided into four groups according to their binding characteristics to various CRP preparations and CRP peptides by using a combination of ELISA, dot blot, and Western blot assays; they were further characterized based upon their reactivity with CRP in the presence of calcium and inhibition by phosphorylcholine. The first group consisted of mAb that reacted only with native CRP, and served to define four distinct native CRP epitopes. The second group consisted of mAb that reacted with native CRP and also with CRP modified by direct immobilization on polystyrene plates, urea-chelation or SDS treatment in the absence of calcium, thus identifying a fifth native CRP epitope; these mAb displayed significantly greater reactivity with native than with modified CRP. The third group included mAb that reacted only with modified CRP and with the larger amino-terminal fragment (residues 1-146) of pronase-cleaved CRP. The fourth group included mAb that reacted only with modified CRP and with the smaller carboxyl-terminal fragment (residues 147-206) of pronase-cleaved CRP; most of these antibodies also reacted with the carboxyl-terminal octapeptide (residues 199-206) of CRP. These experiments have identified mAb that react preferentially with distinct conformational and sequence-determined epitopes of native and modified forms of the CRP molecule, respectively; provide partial identification of the epitopes with which they interact; point to the presence of at least five epitopes on native CRP and at least three epitopes on modified CRP; and provide antibodies suitable for identification and quantitation of native and modified forms of CRP. The mAb directed against neo-CRP epitopes may help identify the presence of this pentraxin and antigenically-related proteins at previously unappreciated sites.\r"

  ".U": "89278651\r", 
  ".W": "The present study evaluated whether protein kinase C (PKC) activation was involved in the lymphocytosis promoting properties of pertussis toxin (Ptx). The exposure of mouse lymphocytes to phorbol esters (as a means to selectively activate PKC) caused a depression in their subsequent capacity to localize into lymph nodes and Peyer's patches in vivo. This pattern of inhibition was quite similar to that observed with lymphocytes treated with Ptx. The mechanisms responsible for the observed decreases in localization to lymphoid organs caused by these two agents, however, appeared to be distinct. Exposure of lymphocytes to PMA was followed by a time and dosage-dependent decrease in the surface density of MEL-14 defined homing receptors. Ptx-treated lymphocytes retained normal density of this homing receptor. Consequently, PMA-treated lymphocytes lost their capacity to bind to high-endothelial venules in in vitro lymph node binding assays while Ptx-treated cells retained normal high-endothelial venule binding potential. We conclude from this study that: 1) the activation of PKC in lymphocytes by PMA can alter their recirculation properties via mechanisms that diminish their expression of surface receptors which support extravasation into lymph node and mucosal lymphoid tissues, and 2) even though Ptx has been reported to elevate the rate of inositol phosphate turnover in lymphocytes, the loss of extravasation potential of Ptx-treated lymphocytes is not mediated via the modification of surface homing receptors as observed in cells exposed to the known PKC activator, PMA.\r"

PMA but not its inactive analog 4-alpha-phorbol-12,13-didecanoate induced lyso paf-acether production, followed by acetyltransferase activation, leading to paf-acether synthesis and release. Moreover, PMA was twice as powerful compared to opsonized zymosan (OPZ). 1-Oleoyl-2-acetyl-glycerol also induced acetyltransferase activation and paf and lyso paf production. The paf-acether formed by PMA or OPZ stimulation was composed of alkyl chains C16:0 (84.3 +/- 5% and 80.7 +/- 3.5%, respectively, and C18:0 (15.7 +/- 5% and 19.3 +/- 3.5%, respectively, means +/- SEM) as assessed by gas chromatography-electron capture detection. The inhibitor of protein kinase C, D-sphingosine, markedly decreased paf and lyso paf production and acetyltransferase activation in PMA- as well as OPZ-stimulated neutrophils. These results strongly suggest the involvement of protein kinase C in signal transduction during cell stimulation, leading to the paf biosynthesis.\r"

After ATP-induced lesions were resealed with Mg2+, the cells were challenged by Ag to determine the effect of the nonhydrolyzable guanosine phosphate on Ag-induced hydrolysis of phosphoinositides and histamine release. Introduction of GTP gamma S into permeabilized rat mast cells or BMMC, followed by exposure of the cells to extracellular Ca2+, resulted in histamine release, but failed to induce hydrolysis of phosphoinositides. It was also found that introduction of GTP gamma S into the cells did not synergistically enhance Ag-induced histamine release. Introduction of GDP beta S into sensitized BMMC inhibited the GTP gamma S-dependent, Ca2+-induced histamine release but failed to inhibit Ag-induced histamine release. The results suggest that GTP gamma S-dependent, Ca2+-induced histamine release and Ag-induced histamine release go through independent biochemical pathways. It was also found that introduction of GTP gamma S or GDP beta S into sensitized BMMC neither enhanced nor inhibited Ag-induced formation of inositol phosphates. These results together with previous findings that pretreatment of BMMC with either pertussis toxin or cholera toxin does not affect Ag-induced hydrolysis of phosphoinositides, indicate that a G protein is not involved in the transduction of IgE-mediated triggering signals to phospholipase C in rodent mast cells.\r"

When such mutant cells were incubated at the nonpermissive temperature, losing early endosomal but not lysosomal acidification, their ability to process several native protein Ag was impaired. The nonpermissive temperature did not affect Ag processing by transfected wild type parental cells. Furthermore, T cells were stimulated normally under these conditions when the mutant cells presented antigenic peptide fragments, which do not require processing. The mutant cells were also not defective in the uptake and overall degradation of native antigen. The elimination of Ag processing by paraformaldehyde and chloroquine treatment of the Chinese hamster ovary cells indicates that these cells do not use a different process than physiologic APC. These results suggest that acidification of early endosomes is an important event in Ag processing.\r"

  ".W": "Our previous studies suggested that a serologically undetectable HLA-C blank allele (HLA-CwBL18) is either a variant Cw5 allele or a novel HLA-C Ag. To examine these possibilities, the CwBL18 and Cw5 genes from the TCC (HLA-A1, -A2, -B52, -B18, -Cw-, -Cw-) and QBL (HLA-A26, -B18, -Cw5) EBV-transformed B lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCL) were cloned, sequenced, and transferred into HLA-A, -B, -C null LCL mutant .221 cells. The CwBL18 Ag was detected on the cell surface of CwBL18 transferents by flow cytometry with the anti-class I mAb W6/32 but not by complement-mediated cytotoxicity with currently available HLA-C specific antisera. Sequence analysis of the Cw-BL18 gene indicated that the CwBL18 Ag is \"C\"-like because it contains all C-locus-specific residues and amino acid replacements commonly found in HLA-C alleles. However, the amino acid sequence of the CwBL18 Ag is unusual; CwBL18 lacks unique allele-specific residues when compared with the sequences of other HLA-C alleles. Moreover, apart from the C-locus-specific differences, the sequence of CwBL18 is identical to the HLA class I consensus sequence. This striking homology of CwBL18 to other HLA class I alleles suggests that CwBL18 may be a weak Ag. Taken together, these data demonstrate that CwBL18 is not a variant Cw5 Ag but is a newly described HLA-C Ag. In contrast to CwBL18, the Cw5 Ag is serologically detectable on the cell surface of Cw5 transferents with HLA-specific allo-antisera. Rather unexpectedly, Cw5 was usually expressed at a lower level than CwBL18 on the surface of .221 transferents as evaluated by W6/32 mAb binding analyses. The sequence of Cw5 revealed several unique amino acid replacements. Two of these substitutions, at residue 35 of the alpha 1 domain and residue 275 of the transmembrane domain, may be responsible for the reduced cell surface expression of Cw5. Additional unique replacements at residues 138 and 177 of the alpha 2 domain suggest that these amino acids may be important in the formation of an epitope recognized by a Cw5-specific antibody.\r"

  ".U": "89278673\r", 
  ".W": "A variety of biologic response modifiers (BRM) can potently augment NK activity in nonlymphoid organs. By using the liver as a model organ, we have shown that this augmentation of organ-associated NK activity is coincident with a 10- to 15-fold increase in the number of large granular lymphocytes (LGL) which can be isolated. The present study was designed to investigate the mechanism by which BRM induce this increase in liver-associated LGL and the coincident increase in hepatic NK activity. Initial studies confirm that a single dose of the pyran copolymer, maleic anhydride divinyl ether (MVE-2), augmented hepatic NK activity and increased the number of liver-associated LGL from 3 x 10(4)/liver to 5 x 10(5)/liver (a 17-fold increase). Multiple injections of MVE-2 further augmented total liver-associated NK activity and LGL number (to 13 x 10(5)/liver). As expected, both the NK activity and detectable LGL were eliminated by treatment of the mice with antiasialo GM1 (asGM1) serum. Three possible mechanisms for the BRM-induced increase in liver-associated LGL have been investigated, including 1) the rapid proliferation of resident hepatic LGL, 2) the redistribution of mature LGL from peripheral sites such as the spleen, or by 3) a rapid output and subsequent hepatic localization of LGL or their precursors recently derived from the bone marrow (BM). Our results demonstrated that the contribution of in situ proliferation to the BRM-induced increase in liver-LGL was relatively small, since the number of cells expressing NK-associated markers (i.e., asGM1, Thy-1.2, and NK1.1) and in G2/M phase (as assessed by propidium iodide uptake) was only 4 to 8%. Further experiments demonstrated that splenectomy before the administration of MVE-2 did not inhibit the augmentation of liver-associated NK activity. This result argued against a recruitment of mature LGL from the spleen. In contrast, selective depletion of the BM following administration of 89Sr decreased the ability of MVE-2 to augment liver-associated NK activity by greater than 80%. This procedure also significantly decreased the ability of Propionibacterium acnes (85%) and multiple doses of IL-2 (49%) to augment liver-associated NK activity. These results demonstrate that the rapid augmentation of liver-associated NK activity by BRM is largely due to localization and accumulation in the liver of LGL recently derived from the BM.\r"

When resistant (C57BL/10) mice were depleted of NK cells using either mAb NK1.1 or polyclonal anti-asialo-GM1, TMEV induced the development of diffuse encephalitis and meningitis early in the postinfection period (days 6 to 11). However, the second phase of TMEV-induced CNS disease (demyelination) was observed only in resistant C57BL/10 mice treated with anti-asialo-GM1. Experiments with beige/beige mice of C57BL/10 background showed a mild degree of gray matter inflammation but no demyelination. In conclusion, NK cells are critical effectors in protecting against TMEV-induced gray matter disease, whereas a different population of either NK1.1- NK cells, or other activated lymphocytes may be critical in resistance/susceptibility to demyelination.\r"

Logistic regression analysis revealed that the presence of IgM to CMV proteins was not associated with a specific subject group but was associated with age (P less than .0001), gender (P less than .005), and IgG titer (P less than .03). The rate of IgM positivity increased from 15% (8 of 54) for those less than 20 y to 63% (37 of 59) for those greater than 60 y. Twenty-three (29%) of 80 males were IgM-positive compared with 49 (44%) of 111 females. Immunoglobulin G titers to CMV were significantly associated with age, gender, and IgM positivity. These data suggest that CMV reactivation in immunocompetent seropositive individuals may occur frequently and increase with age.\r"

Possibly, infants who synthesize antibody to highly conserved HIV proteins may be recognized by the detection in serum of clonally distinct IgG antibodies to HIV. To test this hypothesis, isoelectric focusing in thin-layer agarose gels was combined with affinity immunoblotting to antigen-coated nitrocellulose membranes. In all 10 cases examined, the presence or absence of clonotypically distinct bands of IgG antibodies was concordant with infectious status. Thus, this technique may provide an accurate serologic approach to the diagnosis of congenital HIV infection.\r"

Analysis of ribosomal RNA gene restriction patterns allows separation of most independently isolated strains of identical phage types. The sensitivity of the method is dependent on the restriction enzymes used to digest chromosomal DNA. It was highest for PstI, which separated 16 of 20 strains that belonged to 8 phage types including 3 untypable strains. Three strains differed in their phage types but had identical ribosomal RNA gene restriction patterns. Also, two pairs of strains indistinguishable by phage typing exhibited identical patterns; however, two of these strains were expected to be identical because they were isolated from two patients who were likely exposed to the same source. Ribosomal RNA gene restriction patterns appear to be stable. Thus, the method may complement phage typing and aid in further differentiation of strains.\r"

Homosexuality and intravenous drug abuse, recognized risk factors in western countries, were not seen as risk factors. By multivariate analysis, urban residence and sex for payment were not independently associated with infection. Among females, number of sex partners, sex with a person with an AIDS-like illness, and numbers of episodes of STDs were significantly associated with seropositivity. In males, similar associations were seen, although number of reported sex partners was not independently associated with infection. These findings support the view that heterosexual contact is the predominant mode of transmission in Uganda and suggest that the main risk factors relate to high-risk heterosexual behavior.\r"

The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used for in vitro enzymatic amplification of HBV DNA and comparison with CID50. Serial dilutions of human serum specimens containing HBV adw (CID50 10(-7] and ayw (CID50 10(-7.5] were tested to determine the reproducibility and sensitivity of PCR for the detection of HBV DNA. The detection limit of HBV DNA in serum using PCR was 10(-8) for either amplification of HBV DNA extracted from serum or direct amplification of HBV DNA in proteolyzed serum. The amplification efficiency of PCR in proteolysates was not significantly reduced by using a 0.25% concentration (vol/vol) of nonionic detergents and 2.5% concentration (vol/vol) of digested human serum. Thus, PCR is a specific and rapid method for in vitro detection of HBV DNA that is more sensitive than the in vivo infectivity titration of HBV by chimpanzee inoculation. Therefore, if HBV-related DNA cannot be detected by PCR in specimens or biologic products, they probably do not contain infectious HBV.\r"

Serotype 1 was the predominant serotype in the winter of 1986-1987; however, both serotypes 1 and 2 were detected frequently in the winter of 1987-1988. The results showed the relative frequency of individual serotypes by locale and the yearly change in the prevalence of each serotype in the same area. The result of subgroup specificity of rotavirus obtained by using ELISA with subgroup I- and II-specific monoclonal antibodies confirmed the general finding that rotavirus strains having subgroup I specificity are serotype 2 and those having subgroup II specificity are either serotype 1, 3, or 4. Unusual strains having both subgroup I and II specificity or neither specificity and strains presumed to represent new serotypes were also found.\r"

  ".W": "Monoclonal antibody DD/3B6 reacts with a site near the gamma gamma isopeptide cross link and has been used to detect cross-linked fibrin degradation products in plasma as a marker for clot lysis. However, interpretation of the results is potentially complicated, because soluble cross-linked fibrin polymers contain a gamma gamma cross-link and may also react with the antibody before or after plasmic degradation. We have prepared plasmic digests of fibrinogen, soluble cross-linked fibrin polymers, and cross-linked particulate fibrin clot, have characterized their composition by electrophoresis, and have compared their D dimer immunoreactivities. Undegraded soluble cross-linked fibrin polymer showed no reactivity below 20 micrograms/ml, indicating that the epitope recognized by DD/3B6 is poorly reactive before plasmic degradation. The D dimer immunoreactivity of plasmic digests of particulate or of soluble cross-linked fibrin increased with progressive degradation, with stage 3 digests having 20-fold to 40-fold higher immunoreactivity than stage 1 digests. A stage 3 digest of fully cross-linked particulate fibrin reacted fourfold and 10-fold more than stage 3 digests of soluble fibrin polymers and untreated fibrinogen, which contained 21% and 8.5% soluble fibrin, respectively. Thus, D dimer immunoreactivity in stage 3 digests correlated with the amount of soluble cross-linked fibrin polymer in the undegraded starting material. These findings demonstrate that degradation of soluble or particulate cross-linked fibrin increases D dimer immunoreactivity progressively, with maximal reaction attained with stage 3 digests.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Furthermore, very little is known concerning the function of this previously inaccessible epithelium, because attempts to isolate and culture biliary cells have been unsuccessful until recently. We present a method for the isolation and culture of bile ductular cells from mice with external bile duct obstruction. Over 85% of the isolated cells stain positive for cytokeratin 19, which is characteristic of murine biliary epithelium. Incubation with recombinant murine gamma-interferon resulted in increased class II antigen expression on the isolated cell surface. When these cells were placed, on a basement membrane matrix, they formed duct-like structures composed of cells that had the morphologic characteristics of bile ductular epithelium when examined by transmission electron microscopy. The ability to isolate murine biliary epithelium that forms duct-like structures will be useful for the in vitro study of biliary epithelial characteristics and injury.\r"

  ".W": "Women who were susceptible to rubella, whether they had elected to breast-feed or formula-feed their infants, received immunization with subcutaneously administered rubella antibody 27/3 live, attenuated rubella virus vaccine in the postpartum period. The breast-fed or formula-fed infants of these mothers who had been immunized subsequently received active immunization with the rubella antibody 27/3 vaccine at 15 to 18 months of age. A second group of naturally immune women who were seropositive for rubella did not receive immunization after childbirth. However, infants of naturally immune mothers who did not receive immunization received immunization with the rubella vaccine and served as controls. Seroconversion for rubella antibody developed in over 94% of susceptible women who were seronegative for rubella after postpartum immunization. The infants of these mothers had no rubella antibody activity in the cord blood; however, 13% of such infants exhibited rubella antibody in serum at 6 months of age. On the other hand, 44% of breast-fed infants of naturally immune mothers (controls) demonstrated rubella antibody activity at 6 months of age. Subsequent immunization with rubella vaccine in breast-fed infants whose mothers had received postpartum immunization resulted in a serum antibody response that was similar to the response observed in the formula-fed infants or the infants of naturally immune mothers who had not received immunization. These data suggest that early neonatal exposure to the rubella virus in breast milk does not enhance or suppress subsequent responses to current programs of rubella vaccination in early childhood.\r"

  ".U": "89279032\r", 
  ".W": "A number of pharmacologic treatment regimens were used to evaluate the early defenses against experimental cutaneous candidiasis in nonimmune mice. Severe immunosuppression of the animals was found to have little effect on the numbers of Candida pseudohyphae that initially infected the skin, but it did, however, modify the progression of the infection afterwards. Of the regimens tested, only the combination of intraperitoneal cyclophosphamide and intravenous phorbol myristate acetate both completely eliminated the epidermal neutrophilic infiltrates characteristic of these infections and promoted a significant degree of Candida invasion into the dermis. However, the epidermal proliferative response to the infections, generally considered to be an important mechanism of defense against superficial mycoses, was equivalent at the sites of both invasive and noninvasive foci, and it was generally comparable to that in normal animals. Dermal invasion in the treated animals was also found to occur at a time (between 12 and 24 hours after inoculation) when the epidermis was maximally proliferating. In contrast to these results, the intraperitoneal administration of colchicine significantly suppressed epidermal proliferation at the Candida foci but had only minimal effects in promoting dermal invasion. Therefore, whereas epidermal proliferation could be involved in the eventual clearance of these experimental cutaneous Candida infections, this mechanism apparently has little to do with either limiting the number of organisms initially infecting the skin or preventing their invasion into the dermis.\r"

We studied the mechanism whereby treatment of bovine pulmonary artery endothelial cells with the potent inflammatory agent phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) stimulated the adherence and secretion of superoxide anion by human PMNLs. Treatment of endothelial cell monolayers with 100 ng/ml PMA resulted in a time-dependent increase in PMNL adherence to the endothelial cells. Treatment of endothelial cells with PMA or the less-lipophilic active phorbol ester 4-beta-phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate stimulated PMNL adherence in a dose-dependent manner, but the inactive phorbol ester 4-alpha-12,13 dideconoate had no effect on PMNL adherence. When formalin-fixed endothelial cells were treated with PMA, the increase in PMNL adherence was similar to that observed with unfixed endothelial cells. Treatment of fixed endothelial cells with 4-beta-phorbol 12,13 dibutyrate did not promote adherence. PMA-induced stimulation of PMNL adherence to endothelial cells was not eliminated by washing the PMA-treated endothelial cells, and the 4-hour conditioned medium obtained from PMA-treated endothelial cells also stimulated PMNL adherence to untreated endothelial cell monolayers PMNL adherence induced by PMA also stimulated the secretion of superoxide anion. Thus, PMA bound to the vascular endothelium will promote both PMNL adhesion and the secretion of reactive oxygen intermediates. Furthermore bound PMA rereleased from the endothelium can also stimulate PMNL adherence and superoxide anion secretion at a distant site.\r"

Analysis of the shape of the pressure-time curves suggested that sickle cells were subdivided into two discrete subpopulations: (1) relatively deformable cells and (2) cells so rigid that they plugged the pores. The analysis allowed calculation of the fraction of cells causing plugging (FP), even when FP represented less than 0.01% of the population. FP rose with falling Po2 level, apparently with the recruitment of progressively less dense cells into the plugging fraction. A density profile for each sample was constructed. When we made the assumption that the plugging cells represented the denser moiety, this profile allowed identification of the threshold Po2 level at which cells of a given density, deoxygenated under these conditions, became unable to traverse the 4.8 microns pore.\r"

They were randomly assigned by using a crossover design to two 11-day periods, one on a high-protein diet (2 gm/kg/day) and the other on a low-protein diet (0.55 gm/kg/day). The high-protein diet was associated with increased urinary erythropoietin excretion (4.28 +/- 0.84 U/24 hr vs 1.28 +/- 0.16 U/24/hr; p less than 0.05), increased serum erythropoietin concentration (22 +/- 2 mU/ml vs 10 +/- 2 mU/ml; p less than 0.05), and increased reticulocyte count (3.0 +/- 0.8 vs 1.6 +/- 0.4; p less than 0.05), demonstrating that erythropoietin production by the diseased kidney was still responsive to dietary protein manipulation. To examine whether changes in erythrocyte survival could be responsible for the differences in erythropoietin production, red cell survival was measured in two groups of subtotally nephrectomized rats, one group ingesting a high-protein diet (30%) and the other a low-protein diet (6%). No difference in erythrocyte survival rate was found. Reticulocyte counts were, however, elevated on the high-protein diet. We conclude that in the diseased kidney, a high-protein diet, perhaps by increasing renal O2 consumption, directly stimulates erythropoietin production.\r"

Results indicate that the angiotensin II octapeptide is the major peptide fragment in both arterial and venous plasma. Approximately 80% of the \"immunoreactive\" angiotensin II measured in both arterial and venous plasma is the angiotensin II octapeptide fragment. The concentration of angiotensin II octapeptide in venous blood approximated the concentration of angiotensin II octapeptide measured in arterial blood. These data suggest that venous concentrations of angiotensin II octapeptide probably reflect the activity of the tissue renin angiotensin system, because its concentration was much higher than would be predicted from inactivation of arterial blood angiotensin II octapeptide in peripheral tissues.\r"

Sensitivity and specificity for the semi-automatic defibrillator in the interpretation of ventricular fibrillation was found to be 97 and 100% respectively. Only 28 (14%) of the 206 defibrillated patients regained circulation and were admitted for further hospital care. Only three survived to be discharged. Among the 342 patients in whom defibrillation was not indicated, 16 (5%) regained circulation and were admitted for further hospital care and one (0.3%) survived to be discharged. Semi-automatic defibrillators seem reliable, safe and inexpensive; however, the isolated addition of defibrillation to basal ambulance service seems to be inadequate in Stockholm. We need to evaluate what further resources are of importance to guarantee a successful outcome.\r"

In patients with pneumonia, elevated fibrinopeptide A levels and subnormal antithrombin and protein C levels suggested some degree of consumption of the inhibitors. Later, an increase was observed for all the inhibitors, but was most conspicuous for heparin cofactor II which reached high normal values. C-reactive protein, initially markedly elevated, decreased rapidly. This finding suggests that heparin cofactor II might act as a delayed acute phase reactant. In stroke patients only small, not statistically significant, changes occurred during the observation period, except for heparin cofactor II which increased in patients with haemorrhagic stroke.\r"

After incubation, 4.5 +/- 3.5% (mean +/- SD) of the initial glyceride-glycerol remained in the incubate. This amount did not vary with the plasma VLDL concentration. The incubation mixture was separated into three density fractions: VLDL, low density lipoprotein (LDL) and a high density lipoprotein (HDL) respectively. The lipid contents of these were determined. The distribution of cholesterol and phospholipids after lipolysis was highly dependent on the plasma VLDL level. The amount of cholesterol and phospholipids recovered in the LDL density region increased with the rising plasma VLDL level, the correlation coefficients for this relationship were 0.80 and 0.66, respectively. The results thus indicate that small, similar size VLDL from normo-respectively hypertriglyceridaemic plasmas have different properties.\r"

Four of the five AIDS dementia patients in this series demonstrated HIV infected cells distributed in widely different parts of the brain, but only one case showed HCMV infected cells. The greater abundance of HIV was in subcortical white matter in nodular areas consisting of monocyte/macrophage infiltrates. The cells were occasionally arranged as a multinucleated syncitium. In two cases, a few large cells with the appearance of neurons were positive for HIV hybridisation. By appropriate treatment with ribonuclease, it was shown that hybridisation was primarily to HIV RNA. HCMV infected cells were observed in small numbers in only one of the positive cases, suggesting that HCMV is not a determining factor in AIDS dementia. HCMV positive cells were located in the grey matter, with an appearance suggestive of neurons. Cells expressing the MHC-class II antigen HLA-DR, a marker of reactive microglia and macrophages, were observed to be extensive in affected brain sections in the one case examined. These cells were present in greater number than HIV infected cells. In this case, extensive numbers of HIV infected cells were noticed along the peripheral margin of the substantia innominata. This could indicate infection in this case of a critical brain region from the cerebrospinal fluid.\r"

In seven of the 14 patients, arteriovenous malformation or amyloid angiopathy were found by ordinary pathological examinations. Among the remaining seven patients, definite microaneurysms were verified in five and possible ones in two patients by using the technique of serial sectioning of the solid nodular tissues removed from the presumed bleeding site, where an arterial connection between the tissues and the surrounding brain was noted. Four of these seven patients had no history of hypertension and showed normal blood pressure before and after surgery. To verify microaneurysms in surgical specimens, it seems important to search the presumed bleeding site properly by a meticulous microsurgical technique and to section the tissues serially for the histological examination.\r"

When tested in vitro in a model of catheter colonisation using large challenge doses of Staphylococcus epidermidis and prolonged perfusion, some antimicrobials failed to protect against colonisation whereas others protected against one or two challenges. A combination of rifampicin and clindamycin gave best results, protecting against three successive challenges over a 28 day perfusion period. Resistant organisms did not develop. The process is likely to be useful in prevention of hydrocephalus shunt infection.\r"

The relationship between perilymphatic pressure, indirectly measured by tympanic membrane displacement, and mean intracranial pressure defined either clinically or by direct measurement has been examined in 58 patients (aged 5-77 years), with hydrocephalus, benign intracranial hypertension, intracranial tumours, subarachnoid haemorrhage and head injuries. The most consistent results were obtained in young patients with hydrocephalus and benign intracranial hypertension. However, the technique was not suitable when the stapedial reflex was absent as a result of middle ear/brainstem dysfunction and did not reflect intracranial pressure when the cochlear aqueduct was not patent. This pilot study suggests that the tympanic membrane displacement technique may provide a useful non-invasive method for serial monitoring of intracranial pressure in young patients with hydrocephalus or benign intracranial hypertension.\r"

  ".W": "Auditory neglect was investigated in normal controls and in patients with a recent unilateral hemispheric lesion, by requiring them to detect the interruptions that occurred in one ear in a sound delivered through earphones either mono-aurally or binaurally. Control patients accurately detected interruptions. One left brain damaged (LBD) patient missed only once in the ipsilateral ear while seven of the 30 right brain damaged (RBD) patients missed more than one signal in the monoaural test and nine patients did the same in the binaural test. Omissions were always more marked in the left ear and in the binaural test with a significant ear by test interaction. The lesion of these patients was in the parietal lobe (five patients) and the thalamus (four patients). The relation of auditory neglect to auditory extinction was investigated and found to be equivocal, in that there were seven RBD patients who showed extinction, but not neglect and, more importantly, two patients who exhibited the opposite pattern, thus challenging the view that extinction is a minor form of neglect. Also visual and auditory neglect were not consistently correlated, the former being present in nine RBD patients without auditory neglect and the latter in two RBD patients without visual neglect. The finding that in some RBD patients with auditory neglect omissions also occurred, though with less frequency, in the right ear, points to a right hemisphere participation in the deployment of attention not only to the contralateral, but also to the ipsilateral space.\r"

At necropsy the main finding was of neurofibrillary tangles in the neurons of the pontine and medullary reticular formation, with particularly severe involvement of the nucleus ambiguus, dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus and nucleus tractus solitarius. Morphologically, by light and electron microscopy and immunostaining, the tangles were similar to those of other neurofibrillary degenerative diseases. Although similar in some respects to progressive supranuclear palsy and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis of the Guam type, the combination of clinical and neuropathological features suggest that this is a distinct disease entity.\r"

Neurological investigation two years after onset of the spasms showed by electrophysiological studies excessive co-contraction of the antagonistic jaw-closers, mainly the right masseter during attempts at jaw opening and absence of the silent period in the right masseter and anterior temporalis following jaw tap and trigeminal exteroceptive stimulation. Jaw dystonia was therefore considered and Botulinum A toxin was injected into the right masseter and temporalis which dramatically improved the patient's condition.\r"

A total of 27,934 seizures were recorded, of which 12,626 (45.2%) were associated with falls. There were 766 significant head injuries. Four hundred and twenty two required simple dressing and observation, and 341 required sutures (average number of sutures 4.5). There was one confirmed skull fracture, one confirmed extradural haemorrhage and one confirmed subdural haemorrhage. Thus 2.7% of all seizures resulted in a head injury (6.1% of seizures associated with falling). Simple dressing was required in 1.5%; 1.2% required sutures. Only one in every 9311 seizures (one in every 4208 seizures associated with falls) resulted in skull fracture, extradural or subdural haemorrhage. Minor seizure related head injury is therefore relatively common, while severe head injury is rare.\r"

  ".W": "Alterations of primary afferent axons in the nucleus gracilis were studied at three weeks and four, 12, and 24 months after peripheral nerve axotomy by hindlimb amputation at the hip joint in 19 female cats. The contralateral side and two cats not subjected to amputation were controls. We observed two major types of fiber alterations. One, fibers showed changes of axonal atrophy, myelin remodelling, and degeneration. Adaxonal invagination occurred more frequently (p less than 0.005) at three weeks postamputation, in territories known to contain centrally directed axons of primary afferent neurons of the lower limb, than in controls. Perhaps adaxonal sequestration contributed to axonal attenuation. Two, there were filamentous, granular, central core, and other types of axonal swellings found in territories containing central axons of primary afferent neuron terminals of the lower limb. These changes occurred most frequently at 12 and 24 months and were significantly more frequent than in control tissue. These reactive/dystrophic axons therefore were associated with permanent axotomy, but we have not established that they occur in central axons of primary afferent neurons, or whether they are degenerative or abortive regenerative changes.\r"

  ".W": "JC virus (JCV) has frequently been described as a tissue specific agent in the human population targeting the myelin producing oligodendrocyte whose destruction results in the demyelinating disease, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). JC virus growth in cell culture systems has generally reflected that observation because its multiplication is most efficient in cultures derived from human fetal brain. These cultures, however, are composed of a mixed population of cells phenotypically categorized as either astrocytes or precursors to oligodendrocytes. We have been able to separate mixed populations of glial cells from human fetal brain in culture and produce a pure population of astrocytes. We then analyzed the astrocyte cell cultures for their ability to support JCV transcription, replication, and virion production. Our results demonstrate that cultures of astrocytic cell types support JCV gene expression leading to virus multiplication. These astrocytic cell cultures also can be passaged several times in culture without loss of their astrocytic phenotypes or susceptibility to JCV infection. These data are consistent with our studies of JCV gene expression in fixed brain tissues of PML patients and virus immortalized astrocytic cell lines. These results strongly suggest that astrocytes as well as oligodendrocytes play a role in the pathogenesis of PML and should focus additional experiments on this particular cell type.\r"

  ".W": "Lipid synthesis and its regulation by serum lipoproteins at the microvascular blood-brain barrier were studied using primary cultures of microvascular endothelial cells from rat brain. These cells are capable of synthesizing all their lipids (neutral lipids, phospholipids, glycolipids) from the water-soluble compounds, glucose, acetate, acetoacetate and beta-hydroxybutyrate. The ketone bodies, especially acetoacetate, are the preferred substrates for lipid synthesis. The incorporation patterns of acetate, acetoacetate and beta-hydroxybutyrate are very similar, indicating that these precursors contribute to lipid synthesis via the same metabolic route. However, the metabolic pathway is different for glucose, which is preferentially incorporated into phospholipids. The existence of an inverse relationship between lipid synthesis and the serum lipoprotein concentration suggests that cultured cerebral endothelial cells are capable of taking up lipids, principally cholesterol, contained in the serum lipoproteins. Cellular lipids would thus be supplied both by intracellular lipid synthesis and by serum lipoproteins. The difference between cholesterol synthesis rates in cultured cerebral endothelial cells and in isolated brain microvessel cells could be partly explained by the fact that the lipoprotein concentration is much lower in the culture medium than in rat serum.\r"

  ".W": "The prenatal histogenesis of the human cerebellum in renal agenesis has been studied in four fetuses (32-, 33-, 33-, and 36-week-old) using the rapid Golgi method. A fundamental anomaly involving the developing Purkinje cell has been found. The normal histogenesis of this neuron is aborted about the 32nd-33rd week of gestation. Subsequently, the neuron undergoes a progressive transformation acquiring an abnormal dendritic morphology in only four weeks. The perikaryal basal dendrites are retained rather than disappear, and they continue to grow spreading horizontally through the ganglionic plate and into the internal granular layer. Progressively the basal dendrites become hypertrophic and long and give off accessory apical branches that penetrate into the molecular layer. Concomitantly, the development of the apical dendrites is impeded, and their size and number are progressively reduced. The structure of the transformed Purkinje cell as well as the distribution of its dendrites contrast sharply with those of normal neurons. This transformation reflects a remarkable degree of plasticity of developing neurons and implies structural reorganizations of the local circuitry which could result in functional anomalies. Similar Purkinje cell dendritic anomalies have been described in renal dysplasia and the infantile type of polycystic kidney. The cause of this cerebellar anomaly, or its relationship to congenital renal disorders, remains unexplained. Failure of climbing fiber/Purkinje cell normal interactions is proposed as a possible explanation for the abnormal Purkinje cell histogenesis.\r"

  ".W": "Approximately 20% of preterm rabbit pups develop spontaneous germinal matrix hemorrhages (GMH). To understand better the pathogenesis of GMH we studied the ultrastructure of germinal matrix (GM) blood vessels in rabbits delivered at gestational day 28. Regardless of luminal size, the walls of most GM vessels had the structural characteristics associated with a blood-brain barrier (BBB) and consisted of endothelial cells and pericytes, surrounded by GM cell processes. Endothelial cells ranged from voluminous to attenuated, with some cells containing intracytoplasmic, membrane-bound vacuoles, and luminal as well as abluminal cytoplasmic projections. Some short interendothelial junctions had no puncta adherentia, whereas long ones often possessed intermittent pores. In two animals with GMH, intact endothelial cells were separated by narrow and wide gaps filled with luminal contents that occasionally extended beyond the interendothelial opening. The basal lamina (BL) was ill-defined, thin, often discontinuous and of low electron density. Smooth muscle cells and collagen were not present, which precluded any classification into arteries, capillaries and veins. Germinal matrix cell processes lacking both micro- and intermediate filaments were haphazardly disposed around the blood vessel walls in place of astrocytic endplates. Recent reports indicate that an astrocytic environment may be necessary for the development of the interendothelial tight junctions and BL. The presence of \"glial foot\" processes that lack ultrastructural characteristics of mature astrocytes suggests that interendothelial junctions and basal laminae in the vessels of the ganglionic eminence may not have the necessary structural and functional potential to withstand the transmural pressures or the pathophysiological influence of hypertension, hyperosmolarity, sepsis, and other factors known to open the BBB and to contribute to GMH.\r"

Choroid plexus carcinoma is rare, with approximately 24 reported cases in children. Predicting the behavior of choroid plexus tumors from the histology can be difficult. Neither mitoses nor necrosis were seen in one case, but evaluation of proliferation using Ki-67 monoclonal antibody showed 9% of the cells to be in proliferative phases of the cell cycle, a high value for a glial-derived neoplasm. Ki-67 activity may be a more sensitive measure of proliferation in malignant choroid plexus tumors than the presence of mitoses and necrosis, and additional studies may establish its role in distinguishing between choroid plexus carcinoma and papilloma when histologic classification is equivocal. Both tumors were immunoreactive for keratin, which confirmed previous studies. Both were nonreactive for glial fibrillary acidic protein, S-100, and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), unlike a previous study which reported that choroid plexus carcinoma, compared to papilloma, was uniquely S-100-negative and CEA-positive. Choroid plexus carcinoma in siblings has not been reported. Chance occurrence in siblings is extremely unlikely; thus a genetic basis for the neoplasms is likely, although environmental influences cannot be excluded.\r"

Supplemental questions designed to identify atypical ischemic pain led to increased sensitivity of up to 68% that was offset by decreased specificity. While the Questionnaire's sensitivity for coronary disease was greater for women than men (57 vs 40%), the overall accuracy was the same because specificity was lower (63 vs 80%).\r"

We indicate that the classically described bias differs from the corresponding bias in studies, such as incidence density studies, in which cases are restricted to those with recent diagnoses. We present methods that may be used to assess the magnitude of Berkson's bias in incidence-density studies. In many, though not all, situations the bias should be small and of little practical concern.\r"

For rectangular regions the Dunnett method gives a region with the most appropriate confidence level, but this region contains a different set of odds ratio estimates than are implied by the usual significance tests.

The study population consisted of 85 persons who lost their jobs when a brisling sardine factory close to Bergen in Norway was shut down in 1975. The employees of a nearby \"sister factory\" within the same company were chosen as a control population, consisting of 87 persons. After the factory closure, the annual employment rate of the study group showed a steady rise to a maximum level of 44% within 6 years, but even after 10 years never matched the employment rate of the controls. The cumulative rates of disability pension, granted for medical conditions only, was more than three times higher in the study group than among controls from the second through the fourth year of follow-up. This excess of disabilities then stayed relatively constant at approximately 17 per 100 persons from 5 to 10 years after the shut-down. Given present days' unemployment, the results of this investigation point to the importance of acknowledging a long-term effect of job-loss on health and social readjustment.\r"

Compared with women whose menarche occurred at age 13 or later, the risk of ovarian cancer was moderately (and not significantly) elevated for earlier menarche (multivariate relative risk, RR = 1.13, 95% confidence interval, CI = 0.97-1.37). There was a positive association with age at menopause, the multivariate relative risk, compared with women aged 45 years or less at menopause, being 1.25 for those aged 45-49 years, 1.40 for 50-53 and 1.58 for 54 or over (chi 2(1) trend = 8.86, p = 0.003). A lifelong irregular menstrual pattern (defined as frequent menstrual-like episodes of bleeding less than 21 or more than 35 days apart) was negatively associated with the risk of ovarian cancer (multivariate RR = 0.45, 95% CI = 0.31-0.65). The effect of age at menopause and lifelong menstrual pattern was similar in different strata of age, whereas there was a positive association with early menarche among younger women which disappeared with advancing age. The present findings confirm the influence of various menstrual factors on the risk of epithelial ovarian cancer.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Rates of work disability in individuals with asymmetric oligoarthritis involving one knee or one hip were in the same range as those in individuals with symmetric polyarthritis involving two knees or two hips. The earnings of women and men with asymmetric oligoarthritis were only 30 and 63% respectively of the earnings of persons with no arthritis. However, less than one-third of these earnings losses were explained by the presence of arthritis, with further explanation from higher age, lower formal education levels, and comorbidity in individuals with asymmetric oligoarthritis. These results suggest that greater attention to demographic and comorbidity variables may be indicated in efforts to control economic losses associated with arthritis.\r"

Reliability coefficients for most methods are acceptable although the low coefficients for measurements taken a year apart suggest that preferences change over time. Convergent validity among methods has been supported in some but not all studies, and there are limited data supporting hypothetical relationships between preferences and other variables. The category ratings method is easiest to administer and appears to yield valid scale values; thus, it is recommended for large-sample studies. However, decision-oriented methods, particularly the time trade-off and standard gamble, may be more effective in small-scale investigations and individual decision making.\r"

This is a retrospective study of 38 patients from two craniofacial centers who had Le Fort III osteotomy. The aims of this investigation were to document the size and shape of the mandible in Crouzon and Apert syndromes and to determine the effect on these parameters of downward and forward movement of the midface. The syndrome patients had increased gonial angle, increased MP-SN, increased ramus height, and increased ratio of ramus height to body length when compared with normal standards. Patients operated during growth and those operated when growth was completed had similar mandibular size and shape indicating that Le Fort III osteotomy had no measurable effect on these parameters. Inclination of the mandible to the anterior cranial base was increased by the operation and remained unchanged during the follow-up period. The results of this study indicate that the size and morphology of the mandible are similar in Crouzon and Apert syndromes. The pattern of growth is more vertical in the syndrome patients than in normals. Le Fort III osteotomy in growing children does not result in altered mandibular size and shape despite backward rotation of the mandible as a result of midface advancement.\r"

Twenty-one adult patients who underwent isolated maxillary advancement via LeFort I osteotomies without adjunctive nasal soft tissue procedures and/or V-Y closure of the vestibular incision were studied. Homogeneity of the patient population was ensured by selecting cases with less than 2 mm vertical change. The mean maxillary advancement and mean change in Sn was calculated for these 21 patients. Additionally, the 21 patients were subdivided into two groups based on lip thickness: group 1 (lips between 10 and 17 mm thick) and group 2 (greater than 17 mm thick). In each patient group a linear regression (LR) was determined on the magnitude of maxillary advancement (MMA) to the change in soft tissue subnasale (Sn) and on the ratio of Sn change to bone move. The results using mean data showed that the relationships produce significantly high standard deviations; thus, a general correlation between change in soft tissue position to bony advancement cannot be made. Individuals with thin lips (12 to 17 mm) had a good correlation between the magnitude of bony move and amount of soft tissue change. However, increased lip thickness (greater than 17 mm) produced a less predictable correlation between soft and hard tissue changes. All lips thinned around 2 mm when compared with preoperative values. Lip thickness stabilized at approximately 6 months postoperatively.\r"

ICI 169,369 was found to reverse the inhibitory actions of amphetamine on A9 and A10 dopamine (DA) neurons, a common property shared by other AP drugs, and was comparable in potency to clozapine. In cell population studies, acute treatment with ICI 169,369 (at a low dose only) and clozapine selectively increased the number of spontaneously active A10 DA cells, which was found to correlate with the ability of both these drugs to cause depolarization inactivation (DI) of A10 DA cells after chronic administration. Interestingly, chronic treatment with ICI 169,369 also caused a significant increase in the number of actively discharging A9 DA cells, an effect not predicted on the basis of the acute data. A similar effect was noted for clozapine, although the magnitude did not reach statistical significance. This profile of activity was unlike that of haloperidol, which acutely caused a nonselective increase in the number of active A9 and A10 DA cells, associated with the ability of this agent to cause DI of both A9 and A10 DA cells after chronic treatment. Inasmuch as DI of A10 DA cells may be correlated with AP efficacy whereas DI of A9 DA cells may predict the ability of an AP to cause extrapyramidal side effects, ICI 169,369, like clozapine, may be a potential AP with a reduced likelihood for producing extrapyramidal side effects.\r"

Reserpine (0.5-5.0 mg/kg i.p., 6, 18, 48 and 72 hr) produced a dose- and time-dependent decrease in both DA and NT levels in the prefrontal cortex, a brain region innervated by a mixed DA/NT projection. The effect of reserpine was not mimicked by alpha-methylparatyrosine (200 mg/kg i.p.) pretreatment. Furthermore, the reserpine-induced decline in prefrontal cortex DA and NT levels occurred after gamma-butyrolactone (GBL)-induced inhibition of impulse flow (750 mg/kg i.p.). In contrast, in the nucleus accumbens and striatum, regions which contain colocalized (nucleus accumbens) and intrinsic (striatum and nucleus accumbens) neurotensin perikarya, reserpine produced declines in DA and increases in NT levels. alpha-Methylparatyrosine decreased striatal and nucleus accumbens DA levels without altering NT levels in these structures. GBL produced an increase in DA levels in the nucleus accumbens and striatum while decreasing nucleus accumbens and striatal NT levels. Reserpine attenuated the decline in nucleus accumbens and striatal NT levels produced by GBL. In the periaqueductal grey, a brain region densely innervated by NT which has a small population of DA perikarya, reserpine had no effect on NT levels. Because there is no known colocalization of DA and NT in the striatum, the increases in striatal NT levels after depletion of DA may indicate that striatal DA afferents control the release and/or synthesis of NT within NT cells in the striatum, thus leading to alterations in striatal tissue levels.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In rats, morphine (125 micrograms i.t.) produced the same behavioral toxicity (scratching, biting, seizures) and hypoglycemia as previously reported in mice. In mice, the glycine antagonist strychnine (5 micrograms i.t.) and the morphine metabolite morphine-3-glucuronide (2 micrograms i.t.) mimicked the behavioral, but not the hypoglycemic, effects of high-dose i.t. morphine. Kainic acid (0.1 micrograms i.t.), which caused high-frequency hindlimb movements, also did not cause hypoglycemia. Naltrexone (1 mg/kg/ s.c.) or the s.c. implantation of morphine pellets for 3 days attenuated the hypoglycemic effect, but not the behavioral effects, of morphine (40 micrograms i.t.). The hyperglycemic effect of s.c. morphine(20 mg/kg) was blocked by i.t. morphine. Anesthesia with pentobarbital (75 mg/kg i.p.) attenuated the hypoglycemic effect of morphine (40 micrograms i.t.). Morphine i.t. also caused a time- and dose-dependent decrease in liver glycogen levels and was more potent in causing glycogenolysis (30 min ED50 = 19 micrograms) than in causing hypoglycemia (30 min ED50 = 30 micrograms). It is concluded that the hypoglycemic effect of i.t. morphine appears to be independent of its behavioral effects, displays tolerance and is accompanied by hepatic glycogen depletion.\r"

Enhancement of Na+ transport by agonists was studied in isolated rat proximal tubules by determining the uptake of 22Na that was suppressible by the Na+/H+ inhibitor, 5-(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl)amiloride (EIPA). The phorbol ester, phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate, (0.1 microM), directly stimulated the antiporter through protein kinase C and increased EIPA-suppressible 22Na uptake 250% above control. The alpha-1 adrenoceptor agonists, cirazoline and phenylephrine, in addition to the mixed agonist, norepinephrine, maximally stimulated uptake by 226 to 232% at 1 microM concentrations. alpha-2 agonists produced a range of maximal stimulations at 1 microM from 65% with guanabenz to 251% with B-HT 933. Increases in 22Na uptake by agonists were inhibited by selective adrenergic antagonists and by EIPA. The drugs did not change the EIPA-resistant component of 22Na uptake. Inasmuch as the adrenoceptor subtypes likely stimulated Na+/H+ exchange by differing intracellular pathways impinging upon common transport steps, we examined whether simultaneous stimulation of both pathways was additive. Submaximal concentrations (5 nM each) of alpha-1 and alpha-2 adrenoceptor agonists in combination synergistically enhanced 22Na uptake to a level similar to 1 microM concentrations of adrenoceptor agonists alone or in combination.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, \"Ecstasy\"), an amphetamine analog, is a \"designer drug\" which is being increasingly abused. The potential neurotoxic hazard of MDMA in humans was assessed by examining the effects of repeated systemic administration of MDMA on selected neurochemical and behavioral measures in rhesus monkeys. In the first study, MDMA (2.5 or 10 mg/kg twice daily for 4 days) produced selective and significant neurochemical decreases in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentrations of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) and brain concentrations of serotonin and 5-HIAA. At the high dose of MDMA, a selective decrease in serotonin uptake sites (reflecting destruction of brain serotonin terminals) was observed. To determine if these changes after high dose MDMA were pharmacologic or truly neurotoxic, in a subsequent study monkeys were treated with MDMA (10 mg/kg twice daily for 4 days) and then monitored for 14 weeks. Throughout this period, CSF 5-HIAA was decreased in MDMA-treated animals but not in saline-injected controls. At the end of this period, significant decreases in the concentration of serotonin, 5-HIAA and serotonin uptake sites were observed in cerebral cortex and striatum but not in hypothalamus or spinal cord. In contrast to these widespread alterations in serotonin markers, comparable noradrenergic and dopaminergic measures in CSF and brain appeared generally unaffected. These data demonstrating potent and selective effects of MDMA on various brain serotonin parameters in rhesus monkeys suggest that the drug may produce similar effects in humans.\r"

  ".W": "Effects of the gamma-aminobutyric acidB (GABAB) agonist baclofen on evoked responses and recurrent inhibition in the dentate gyrus were examined in rat hippocampal slices. Granule cell firing was induced by perforant path stimulation; recurrent inhibition was induced by pairing the perforant path stimulus with a preceding mossy fiber stimulus and was mediated through GABAA receptors. Whereas (+/-)-baclofen (10 microM) suppressed the perforant path-evoked population spike only about 20%, it suppressed recurrent inhibition about 84% and converted the perforant path-evoked response to an epileptiform response with multiple population spikes. These effects were concentration-dependent (estimated EC50 values for (+/-)-baclofen were 0.6 microM for suppression of recurrent inhibition and 1.0 microM for induction of multiple population spikes) and stereoselective for (-)-baclofen. Baclofen had no effect on GABAA-mediated inhibiton induced by focal application of GABA to the granule cells. These results suggest that baclofen suppressed recurrent inhibition through an action mediated by GABAB receptors on inhibitory interneurons. They also suggest the net effect of baclofen was proepileptic because its disinhibitory effect was substantially greater than its suppressive effect on synaptic excitation.\r"

As in previous studies indomethacin attenuated furosemide chloruresis (FeCl: 11.4 +/- 1.1 vs. 5.0 +/- 0.9%, P less than .001) without altering mean arterial pressure, inulin clearance or total renal blood flow. Medullary plasma flow was not different between nondiuretic rats and furosemide-treated rats (41.4 +/- 4.3 vs. 41.3 +/- 3.4 ml/min/100 g of tissue). Medullary plasma flow was reduced (P less than .05) during indomethacin antagonism of furosemide chloruresis (41.3 +/- 3.4 vs. 29.1 +/- 2.8 ml/min/100 g of tissue). Angiotensin II blockade with saralasin (2 micrograms/kg/min) prevented the fall in medullary plasma flow in indomethacin-treated rats during furosemide infusion but did not alter mean arterial pressure, inulin clearance or total renal blood flow. However, furosemide's chloruretic response in rats treated with both indomethacin and saralasin remained lower (P less than .001) than that in vehicle-treated rats (FeCl 4.7 +/- .94 vs. 11.4 +/- 1.1%) and was not different from that in indomethacin-treated rats. These data demonstrate that although medullary plasma flow is reduced during indomethacin antagonism of furosemide response this change does not contribute to the attenuated chloruresis. Additionally, the dissociation of the antichloruretic and hemodynamic effects of indomethacin observed during saralasin administration suggest that hemodynamic mechanisms are not involved in the attenuated response to furosemide observed during prostaglandin synthesis inhibition.\r"

The purpose of this study was to see whether other agonists with more receptor selective opioid actions than morphine would also produce this multiplicative interaction. DAMPGO (Tyr-D-Ala2-Gly-NMePhe4-Gly-ol5), DPDPE (D-Pen2, D-Pen5, enkephalin) and U50-488H, opioid agonists highly selective for mu, delta and kappa receptors, respectively, were administered alone i.c.v. or intrathecally (i.t.) or in combination (i.c.v. plus i.t.) to determine ED50 values for the tail-flick response in mice. These ED50 values were examined isobolographically in relation to the theoretical additive ED50 values by the potency ratio method. First, DAMPGO given i.cv and i.t. was similar to morphine, indicating that simultaneous supraspinal and spinal mu agonist administration produce the multiplicative interaction. Second, concurrent administration of DPDPE or U50,488H, i.c.v. and i.t., as well as cross-over combinations of DPDPE at one and U50,488H at the other site, produced additive interactions only. The multiplicative interaction was a property characteristic of mu but not delta and kappa agonists. Based on the similarity between morphine and DAMPGO, it was postulated that both mu agonists act on redundant descending pain inhibitory pathways to produce multiplication. A second mechanism for multiplicative interaction was based on the difference between DAMPGO and morphine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Adenosine receptors in a spontaneously contracting atrial myocyte culture from 14-day chick embryos were characterized by radioligand binding studies and by examining the involvement of G-protein in coupling these receptors to a high-affinity state and to the adenylate cyclase and the myocyte contractility. Binding of the antagonist radioligand [3H]-8-cyclopentyl-1,3-diproylxanthine ([3H]CPX) was rapid, reversible and saturable and was to a homogeneous population of sites with a Kd value of 2.1 +/- 0.2 nM and an apparent maximum binding of 26.2 +/- 3 fmol/mg of protein (n = 10, +/- S.E.). Guanyl-5-yl-(beta, gamma-imido)diphosphate had no effect on either the Kd or the maximum binding and CPX reversed the N6-R-phenyl-2-propyladenosine-induced inhibition of adenylate cyclase activity and contractility, indicating that [3H] CPX is an antagonist radioligand. Competition curves for [3H] CPX binding by a series of reference adenosine agonists were consistent with labeling of an A1 adenosine receptor and were better fit by a two-site model than by a one-site model. ADP-ribosylation of the G-protein by the endogenous NAD+ in the presence of pertussis toxin shifted the competition curves from bi to monophasic with Ki values similar to those of the KL observed in the absence of prior pertussis intoxication. The adenosine agonists were capable of inhibiting both the adenylate cyclase activity and myocyte contractility in either the absence or the presence of isoproterenol. The A1 adenosine receptor-selective antagonist CPX reversed these agonist effects. The order of ability of the reference adenosine receptor agonists in causing these inhibitory effects was similar to the order of potency of the same agonists in inhibiting the specific [3H]CPX binding (N6-R-phenyl-2-propyladenosine greater than N6-S-phenyl-2-propyladenosine or N-ethyladenosine-5'-uronic acid). These data indicate that the adenosine receptor coupled to inhibition of adenylate cyclase activity and to the negative inotropic effect is the A1 subtype. Pertussis treatment uncoupled the adenosine receptor from both inhibition of adenylate cyclase activity and negative inotropic effect. Taken together, the present study indicates that adenosine receptors of the A1 subtype are present on the spontaneously contracting atrial myocytes and are negatively coupled to adenylate cyclase and to the contractile state. The cultured embryonic chick atrial myocyte preparation represents a useful model system for characterizing the cardiac A1 adenosine receptor.\r"

One group received ethanol administered by a cyclic regimen, which resulted in high peak blood ethanol concentrations (BACs). Another group received the same daily dose of ethanol using a regimen which resulted in stable, moderate BACs. Two control groups consisted of rats reared artificially but not exposed to alcohol and rats reared normally by dams. All rats were raised to adulthood. Approximately half the rats were tested for behavioral activity levels and then sacrificed in order to assay the hippocampus for levels of cyclic GMP and protein after incubation with bethanechol (a muscarinic cholinergic agonist). The remaining rats were sacrificed and their hippocampi were assayed for muscarinic cholinergic receptors and protein content. Exposure to cyclic BACs with high peaks but not exposure to stable moderate BACs resulted in greater behavioral activity levels in both sexes and also a greater cyclic GMP responsiveness to a muscarinic cholinergic agonist. Furthermore, exposure to cyclic BACs with high peaks resulted in a significantly larger dissociation constant and a greater number of muscarinic cholinergic receptors. There were no differences among groups or sexes in protein content of the hippocampus. There were no interactions of the alcohol treatment with sex. Thus, in adult rats, exposure to alcohol during the brain growth spurt results in an increase in the dissociation constant and number of muscarinic cholinergic receptors in the hippocampus.\r"

Steady-state plasma concentrations of SK&F 104353 at infusion rates of 0.2 mg/kg + 1 mg/kg/hr, 1 mg/kg + 3 mg/kg/hr or 2 mg/kg + 10 mg/kg/hr were 0.5, 1.6 and 9.4 micrograms/ml, respectively, indicating that the plasma concentrations of SK&F 104353 were related directly to the infusion rate. LTC4, LTD4 and LTE4 (0.17-170 nmol/kg i.v.) produced dose-dependent increases in mean blood pressure. The ED20 dose (i.e., dose required to increase blood pressure 20 mm Hg) of LTC4, LTD4 or LTE4 was 2.7 +/- 0.4, 2.2 +/- 0.3 and 109 +/- 17 nmol/kg, respectively.

Against LTD4 responses, SK&F 104353 at doses of 0.1 mg/kg + 0.3 mg/kg/hr or 0.2 mg/kg + 1 mg/kg/hr produced dose ratios of 3 and 9, respectively.

We have utilized the mesenteric artery and aorta of young and older rats to investigate this problem. In vessels from 12-month-old rats there was a marked loss in relaxation mediated by beta adrenergic and adenosine receptors compared to younger rats whereas relaxation induced by muscarinic cholinergic receptors, [cyclic AMP (cAMP) independent], was not impaired. Maximal relaxation to forskolin and dibutyryl cAMP were intact in the vessels from older rats. Isoproterenol-stimulated cAMP accumulation and cAMP-dependent protein kinase activation were attenuated markedly in the vessels from the older rats. Maximal forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation and cAMP-dependent protein kinase activation were similar in older and young animals. There was an excellent correlation between cAMP-dependent protein kinase activity and relaxation and the relationship was similar in the two age groups. Continuous infusion of the beta adrenergic antagonist timolol for 1 week into older animals partially restored relaxation to beta adrenergic and adenosine receptor agonists in the aorta. These results suggest that the age-related loss of response to beta adrenergic receptor agonist-induced relaxation may be due in part to attenuated activation of cAMP dependent protein kinase and this change may be partially dependent on endogenous catecholamines.\r"

In the present study, the specificity of PLA2-induced stimulation upon [3H]HCh-3 binding has been examined. PLA2, as well as phospholipase C (PLC), treatment of synaptic membranes produced a dose-dependent increase in the specific binding of [3H]HCh-3 whereas neither phospholipase B nor phospholipase D had any effect. PLC-induced stimulation of [3H]HCh-3 binding resulted from a significant decrease in the Kd without a change in the maximum binding of [3H]HCh-3 binding. PLC treatment of synaptosomes resulted in an inhibition of [3H]choline uptake accompanied by an inhibition of Na+, K+-adenosine triphosphatase activity. In contrast to the increase of [3H]HCh-3 binding, the specific binding of both [3H]desipramine and [3H]mazindol was decreased by PLA2 treatment. After PLA2 treatment, [3H]HCh-3 binding was increased about 2.5-fold over basal levels in different regions of the brain. Electrolytic lesions of the medial septal nucleus and kainic acid-induced lesions of the striatum resulted in a marked reduction of [3H]HCh-3 binding in the hippocampus and the striatum, respectively. Residual [3H]HCh-3 binding in the denervated hippocampus and lesioned striatum was increased by PLA2 treatment but remained lower than that in PLA2-treated controls. Finally, atropine-induced up-regulation of [3H]HCh-3 binding in vivo was not additive with PLA2-induced stimulation. These results support the hypothesis that PLA2 might be involved in the regulation of the sodium-dependent high-affinity choline uptake.\r"

Significant positive linear correlations were found among the inhibitory potencies of 10 muscarinic antagonists to inhibit phosphoinositide (PI) turnover and both detrusor muscle contraction in vitro, as well as peak intravesical bladder pressure in vivo in the CMG (r = 0.8, P less than .01). In contrast, there was no significant correlation between the potency of antagonists to block the AC inhibitory response and either in vitro or in vivo guinea pig bladder contractions (P greater than .05). Muscarinic agonists inhibited basal AC activity to a maximum of 20% in a GTP-dependent, Na+-sensitive manner and dose dependently stimulated both PI breakdown (3- to 4-fold) and isolated detrusor contractions. Again, a significant correlation (r = 0.9, P less than .01) was calculated among the potencies of seven muscarinic agonists to elicit PI turnover and in vitro muscle contraction, whereas no significant correlation was observed between their potencies to inhibit AC activity and contractile responses in vitro. Collectively, the data suggest that IP accumulation and presumably IP-induced Ca++ release may function as the transducing mechanism for cholinergic contraction of the urinary bladder.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Rat neostriatal slices were superfused with medium containing 0.1 to 30 microM of the dopamine (DA)-releasing agent D-(+)-am-phetamine (AMPH) and the D-2 DA receptor antagonist (-)-sulpiride (10 microM) in the absence or presence of mu-, delta-, and kappa-selective opioids. AMPH dose-dependently enhanced the cyclic AMP production, as measured by its efflux from striatal slices, whereas simultaneous blockade of D-2 DA receptors by (-)-sulpiride strongly potentiated this effect. Both the mu-opioid receptor selective agonist [D-Ala2,MePhe4,Gly-ol5]enkephalin (0.01-3 microM) and the delta-opioid receptor selective agonist [D-Phe2-D-Pen5]enkephalin (DPDPE, 0.01-3 microM) inhibited the cyclic AMP efflux, stimulated by 10 microM AMPH in the presence of (-)-sulpiride, by 70 to 80%. The highly selective kappa-opioid receptor agonist U 50,488 (trans-3,4-dichloro-N-methyl-N-[2-(1-pyrrol-idinyl)- cyclohexyl]benzeneacetamide methanesulfonate hydrate) (0.01-1 microM) had no effect. In contrast, the purported kappa-opioid receptor agonist bremazocine (3-300 nM) inhibited the stimulated adenylate cyclase activity to a similar extent as did [D-Ala2-MePhe4,Gly-ol5]enkephalin and DPDPE. Moreover, the selective irreversible delta-antagonist fentanyl isothiocyanate reversed both the inhibition caused by DPDPE and that caused by bremazocine, whereas the kappa-selective antagonist norbinaltorphimine showed no differences in its potency to antagonize the inhibitory effects of the different opioid agonists. The results indicate that opioids, by activating mu- or delta-, but not kappa-opioid receptors may cause a profound inhibition of adenylate cyclase activity stimulated by activation of (postsynaptic) D-1 DA receptors upon the (presynaptic) release of DA.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Rhodamine B (RB) fluorescence reappears in perfusion medium of a cyclically perfused rat liver after a rapid initial removal phase. At the same time the compound redistributes in the liver from acinar zone 1 toward zone 3. By analysis of the metabolic profile of RB, and by inhibition of glucuronidation (the main metabolic route) with salicylamide, we show in this paper that formation and secretion of RB-conjugates from liver into perfusate is not involved in the reappearance and redistribution phenomena. We therefore sought the explanation in a kinetic model, in which the acinar heterogeneity of the liver was simulated by several sequential liver compartments. Most kinetic parameters we used in the simulation were calculated from previous experiments with RB (Braakman et al., Hepatology 7: 849-855, 1987). This led to an accurate simulation of the measured RB curves in bile, medium and the acinar zones of the liver. In this study we show that a secondary rise in medium concentration of an injected compound is not necessarily caused by metabolism, but can be easily explained by considering the liver a sequence of compartments, instead of one well-stirred compartment. The conditions for the reappearance as well as for the intrahepatic redistribution are: a fast uptake into the liver, combined with a fast sinusoidal secretion and a slow biliary excretion of the injected substance.\r"

  ".W": "Stereoselectivity of glutathione conjugation was studied in unanesthetized normal and congenitally jaundiced rats (Groningen Yellow), using the separate enantiomers of alpha-bromoisovalerylurea (BIU) as substrates. The blood elimination half-lives of (R)- or (S)-BIU were 8 and 38 min, respectively. The excretion half-lives of the GSH conjugates in bile in normal rats showed a similar difference: (R)-BIU yielded exclusively (S)-IU-S-G with a T1/2 of 12 min, and (S)-BIU yielded only (R)-IU-S-G with a T1/2 of 36 min. In normal rats 45-47% of the dose of (R)-BIU and (S)-BIU was found in bile as glutathione (GSH) conjugate, and 19-25% was excreted in urine as mercapturates. Similar values in the mutant rats indicated that BIU elimination by GSH conjugation was unimpaired, but the GSH conjugates were absent from bile. In the urine twice as much mercapturates was found as in normal rats. The GSH content and the activity of the glutathione-S-transferases in the liver were similar in mutant and controls. The data on blood elimination of the BIU enantiomers and biliary excretion of the GSH conjugates suggest that for (S)-BIU the conjugation step is rate-limiting, whereas for (R)-BIU a transport step into bile may be rate-limiting.\r"

  ".W": "The characterization of the receptor(s) involved in the 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)-induced contraction was studied in the cat middle cerebral artery. 5-HT agonists and antagonists were tested on isolated arterial segments and their vascular potency correlated with their affinity value for 5-HT receptor subtypes as defined in the literature. 5-Carboxamidotryptamine (5-CT) and RU 24969 (5-HT1A-1B agonists) were more potent and as potent as 5-HT, respectively. Agonists at the 5-HT1C-2 (alpha-methyl-5-HT) and 5-HT3 (2-methyl-5-HT) sites were significantly less potent than 5-HT. All these agents induced similar maximal effects. The selective 5-HT1A agonist, 8-hydroxy-2(di-n-propylamino)tetralin, was the least potent but elicited a more intense vasoconstriction. The 5-HT-induced contraction was potently inhibited by compounds with high affinity at the 5-HT2 site in an apparently noncompetitive manner. The order of potency was: pizotifen greater than ritanserin greater than or equal to dihydroergotamine greater than or equal to ketanserin greater than or equal to methysergide. The nonselective agent methiothepin inhibited strongly the vasoconstriction induced by both 5-HT and 5-CT although a decrease in the maximal responses was observed together with a shift of the dose-response curves. In contrast to 5-HT, the contraction induced by 5-CT was only slightly affected by micromolar concentrations of ketanserin. 5-HT1A-1B (propranolol and cyanopindolol), 5-HT1C (mesulergine) and 5-HT3 (MDL 7222 and GR 38032F) selective drugs were almost completely devoid of significant antagonistic activity. Thus, the pharmacology of the feline cerebrovascular receptor(s) shares agonist similarities with the 5-HT1B/5-HT1D receptor subtypes whereas its antagonist profile relates more to that of the 5-HT2 site described in mammalian brain. Although these results may suggest the presence of two receptors in this cerebrovascular smooth muscle, they do not exclude the possibility that a single 5-HT receptor, not yet described by radioligand binding techniques, mediates the contractions induced by 5-HT. A definitive classification of this site, however, appears premature and would require novel and more selective agents.\r"

Mechanical removal of the endothelium attenuated the relaxation induced by isoproterenol (ISO) and did not affect the relaxation produced by forskolin and by sodium nitroprusside. High concentrations of ISO produced an increase in the resting tension of aortic strips with and without endothelium in a concentration-dependent manner. Mechanical removal of the endothelium or treatment with methylene blue enhanced the maximal contraction induced by ISO. Phentolamine antagonized the contractile responses induced by ISO. In the case of streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats, both aortic strips with and without endothelium generated concentration-response curves for ISO-induced relaxation that were shifted to the right. The relaxant responses to forskolin and sodium nitroprusside were not significantly different between vessels from diabetic and age-matched control rats. In both aortic strips with and without endothelium, the maximal contraction in response to high concentrations of ISO was significantly enhanced in strips from diabetic rats. These results suggest that ISO-induced relaxation of aortic strips with endothelium is mediated by beta adrenoceptors on both the endothelium and the smooth muscle, and high concentrations of ISO produce an increase in the resting tension through alpha adrenoceptors. It is further suggested that the decreased relaxant response of the aorta to ISO in diabetes may be due to decreased density or affinity of beta adrenoceptors on the smooth muscle.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of forskolin, an activator of adenylate cyclase, on cytoplasmic Ca++ level ([Ca++]cyt) measured simultaneously with muscle tension using fura-2-Ca++ fluorescence were examined in isolated smooth muscle of rat aorta. Forskolin decreased muscle tension and [Ca++]cyt in resting aorta whereas both norepinephrine and high K+ solution produced sustained increase in muscle tension and [Ca++]cyt. Addition of forskolin during the sustained contractions decreased muscle tension more strongly than [Ca++]cyt. Norepinephrine-induced contraction was more sensitive to forskolin than high K+-induced contraction. The inhibitory effect of forskolin was attenuated when the concentration of norepinephrine or K+ was increased. Cumulative addition of norepinephrine or K+ induced a concentration-dependent increase in both [Ca++]cyt and muscle tension and a positive [Ca++]cyt-tension correlation was observed. In the presence of 0.1 microM forskolin, the norepinephrine-induced increments in [Ca++]cyt and muscle tension were inhibited without changing the [Ca++]cyt-tension relationship. In the presence of a higher concentration (1 microM) of forskolin, muscle tension was inhibited more strongly with only a small additional decrease in [Ca++]cyt resulting in a shift of the [Ca++]cyt-tension relationship. Norepinephrine induced transient increments in [Ca++]cyt and muscle tension in Ca++-free solution and forskolin inhibited these changes. These results suggest that forskolin has concentration-dependent inhibitory effects on vascular contractility to decrease [Ca++]cyt at lower concentrations and to decrease the sensitivity of contractile elements to Ca++ at higher concentrations.\r"

All vasopressin fragments crossed the in vitro BBB to a measurable extent. Endothelial permeabilities were (in 10(-3) cm/min): AVP1-6, 3.0 +/- 0.2; AVP1-7, 4.6 +/- 0.4; AVP1-8, 2.0 +/- 0.5 and AVP1-9, 2.4 +/- 0.4. A significant effect of molecular size on endothelial permeability was seen. Transport rate of AVP1-8, expressed as BBB-clearance, was not affected by luminal concentration change and proved to be symmetrical. These findings suggest that, in the concentration range studied, vasopressin-like peptides can cross the BBB mainly by paracellular transport and that no relevant carrier mediation is involved. AVP1-8 was metabolized slowly (half-life, 6.5 hr) by a 60 cm2 confluent monolayer to AVP1-7, which was not broken down further, suggesting that carboxypeptidases are responsible for AVP1-8 metabolism in the BBB.\r"

It also has antimitotic activity, ascribed previously in other cell lines to the action of the chromophore upon DNA. The chromophore is antimitotic for neuroblastoma cells, as well. The morphology-altering effect of neocarzinostatin can also be mimicked by chromophore alone. The morphology-altering effect becomes apparent at doses of the agent which decrease the culture growth rate to approximately 50% of control values. It appears that induction of morphological neural differentiation of neuroblastoma cells requires an increase in the doubling time above a critical value.\r"

The time course of association and saturability of [125I]cyanopindolol (CYP) binding to slide-mounted tissue sections was similar in rats (Kd = 17 pM) and guinea pigs (Kd = 20 pM). The beta-1 and beta-2 receptor subtypes were examined through the use of highly selective unlabeled receptor antagonists, ICI 118,551 (50 nM) and ICI 89,406 (70 nM). Dramatic species differences between rats and guinea pigs were observed in the neuroanatomical regional localization of the beta adrenergic receptor subtypes. For example, in the thalamus prominent beta-1 and beta-2 receptor populations were identified in the rat; however, the entire thalamus of the guinea pig had few, if any, beta adrenergic receptors of either subtype. Hippocampal area CA1 had high levels of beta-2 adrenergic receptors in both rats and guinea pigs but was accompanied by a widespread distribution of beta-2 adrenergic receptors only in rats. Quantitative autoradiographic analyses of 25 selected neuroanatomical regions 1) confirmed the qualitative differences in CNS beta adrenergic receptor localization, 2) determined that guinea pigs had significantly lower levels of beta adrenergic receptors than rats and 3) indicated a differential pattern of receptor subtypes between the two species. Knowledge of species differences in receptor patterns may be useful in designing effective experiments as well as in exploring the relationships between receptor and innervation patterns. Collectively, these data suggest caution be used in extrapolation of the relationships of neurotransmitters and receptors from studies of a single species.\r"

Highly specific monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) 2-66-3 and 1-7-1 against purified rat liver P-450 isoforms b and c induced by phenobarbital and 3-MC, respectively, were used. After a single topical application of 3-MC to rats aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase (AHH), 7-ethoxycoumarin-O-deethylase and 7-ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase activities in epidermal microsomes were induced significantly. Radioimmunoassay of epidermal microsomes from untreated control animals with 35S-labeled MAb-2-66-3 showed significant binding whereas negligible binding with MAb 1-7-1 was observed. On the other hand significant binding was observed with 35S-labeled MAb 1-7-1 with epidermal microsomes prepared from 3-MC-treated animals. Histochemical staining of epidermis from control animals showed no immunoreactivity with either MAb 1-7-1 or MAb 2-66-3 whereas epidermis obtained from 3-MC-treated rats showed significant immunoreactivity with MAb 1-7-1. Western blot analysis of epidermal microsomes prepared from control animals showed no immunoreactivity with either MAb 1-7-1 or 2-66-3 whereas epidermal microsomes prepared from 3-MC-treated animals showed distinct immunoreactivity with MAb 1-7-1.

High doses of fenfluramine have been reported to cause long-term decreases in brain serotonin (5-HT) levels and density of high-affinity 5-HT uptake sites, actions characteristic of a \"neurotoxic\" effect of the drug. In view of these neurochemical changes, we used immunocytochemistry to assess, in detail, the effects of fenfluramine treatment on the morphology and density of 5-HT-like immunoreactive neurons in rat brain. Twelve to 18 hr after high dose dl-fenfluramine HCl treatment (24 mg/kg s.c., twice daily for 4 days), there was a profound regional decrease in density of fine-caliber 5-HT-like immunoreactive fibers and terminals in brain. This effect was especially apparent in cerebral cortex, hippocampus, cerebellum and striatum and less striking decreases were noted in septum, locus ceruleus and hypothalamus. On the other hand, 5-HT-like immunoreactive somata in midbrain nuclei and fibers and terminals in spinal cord appeared unaffected after fenfluramine treatment. Remaining 5-HT-like immunoreactive fibers and terminals displayed morphology characteristic of degenerating axons (thickening, swollen varicosities and fragmentation). Two weeks after the 4-day treatment regimen, patterns of 5-HT-like immunostaining appeared similar to those noted immediately (i.e., 18 hr) after drug treatment; however, the presence of grossly deformed fibers and terminals seen shortly after drug treatment was lacking. Tyrosine hydroxylase-like immunoreactivity, used to assess changes in catecholamine-containing neurons, appeared unaffected by drug treatment. These data suggest that, in rats, high s.c. doses of fenfluramine may be neurotoxic to some 5-HT-like immunoreactive axons and terminals. The relevance of these observations to the continued therapeutic use in humans of smaller p.o. doses of fenfluramine remains to be determined.\r"

Preliminary studies in isolated dog hepatocytes have indicated that [Au(dppe)2]+ causes an increase in hepatocyte respiration and a decrease in cellular ATP. The purpose of the present investigation was to characterize [Au(dppe)2]+-induced cytotoxicity and biochemical lesions in the intact cell and to correlate these changes with mitochondrial function. The uptake of [14C][Au(dppe)2]+ by rat hepatocytes was rapid, reaching a maximum by 30 min. [Au(dppe)2]+ was distributed throughout the hepatocyte and associated rapidly with mitochondria, nuclei, cytosol and cellular membranes. [Au(dppe)2]+ caused cell lethality in a concentration-dependent fashion; although 5 microM did not cause any changes in lactic dehydrogenase leakage, 20 microM produced 100% cell death by 120 min. [Au(dppe)2]+ also caused concentration-dependent bleb formation of the hepatocyte plasma membrane, increased oxygen consumption and loss of ATP within 30 min. ATP loss was associated with transient increases in AMP and ADP and a profound drop in the ATP/ADP ratio and energy charge. Total nucleotides (adenine and xanthine nucleotides) remained constant. The pattern of glutathione depletion coincided with that of lactic dehydrogenase leakage. Electron microscopy of hepatocytes exposed to [Au(dppe)2]+ for 30 min revealed depletion of glycogen granules and marked swelling of mitochondria. In isolated rat liver mitochondria, [Au(dppe)2]+ caused a stimulation of state 4 respiration and loss of the respiratory control ratio. [Au(dppe)2]+ also relieved the oligomycin-induced inhibition of state 3 (ADP-stimulated) respiration.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The pregnancy outcome in this group was compared to that in a historic control group managed similarly except that an abnormal biophysical assessment was not an indication for delivery. The results suggest that the management of women with severe oligohydramnios after preterm premature rupture of the membranes with daily fetal biophysical profiles decreases the incidence of low five-minute Apgar scores as well as that of maternal and neonatal infection.\r"

The higher parity was associated with a slightly higher occurrence of placenta previa. The pregnancies in the short women were characterized by smaller infants and more frequent delivery by cesarean section, depending on race. For whites the cesarean section rate was 43% in the very-short group (122-136 cm, or 48-53 in), 35% in the short group (137-151 cm, or 54-59 in) and 23% in the control group.

A randomized double-blind trial was conducted to evaluate liposome-encapsulated muramyl tripeptide-phosphatidylethanolamine (liposome/MTP-PE) as a treatment for metastasis in dogs undergoing amputation for osteosarcoma. Fourteen dogs were treated with liposome/MTP-PE, and 13 were treated with empty liposomes. Median survival time was 222 days for dogs treated with liposome/MTP-PE, compared to 77 days for dogs treated with empty liposomes (P less than .002). In the liposome/MTP-PE-treated group there were still four dogs alive and free of metastasis at greater than 1 year post surgery. Treatment was well tolerated; no significant toxic effects were noted except for mild elevations in body temperature (1-2 degrees C) for 2-6 hours post injection.\r"

Because melanocytes are normally found in the epidermal-dermal junction, intradermal inoculation of melanoma cells might be expected to improve their potential for malignant growth as xenografts. The purpose of our study was to examine this possibility. We found that because mouse epidermis and dermis are so thin, it was not possible to inject a bolus of tumor cells intradermally; instead the cells were actually deposited in the most superficial layer of the subcutis (i.e., subdermally). We evaluated the behavior of cells from a human melanoma cell line after sc or subdermal inoculation into National Institutes of Health Swiss athymic nude mice. The cells used were from (1) the predominantly amelanotic human malignant melanoma cell line MeWo, originally established from a melanotic lymph node metastasis, and (2) two MeWo variants resistant to wheat germ agglutinin (WGAr), which were selected for altered malignant capacities. Whereas 5 X 10(5) MeWo cells were required to achieve 100% tumor take with sc injection, only 2 x 10(4) cells were required with subdermal inoculation. Subdermal injection of the MeWo cells resulted in the development of highly melanotic and nonencapsulated primary tumors, which grew quickly into the dermis and epidermis and metastasized at high frequency to draining lymph nodes. In contrast, the tumors that developed after sc injection were found in the deepest layer of the subcutis and were predominantly amelanotic and encapsulated; they rarely metastasized to lymph nodes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Mesothelial cells are presumed to be the progenitor cells of malignant mesothelioma, a cancer strongly correlated with asbestos exposure. Previously, we established a non-tumorigenic cell line, MeT-5A, from normal human mesothelial cells after transfection with a plasmid containing the simian virus 40 (SV40) early-region genes. In the present study, we performed transfection of a plasmid containing the EJ-ras gene and the neomycin-resistance gene into these cells and selected a population resistant to G418, a neomycin analogue. Cells from this cell line formed rapidly growing sc tumors in NIH Swiss athymic nude mice, but untransfected with the vector DNA and selected for G418 resistance formed no tumors. The tumors formed by EJ-ras-transfected cells were established in vitro, and cells from these tumor cell lines exhibited a characteristic altered morphology. The cells had the same isoenzyme phenotype as the parent cells, and they expressed the mutant EJ-ras p21 protein. This first demonstration of malignant transformation of human mesothelial cells in vitro may permit molecular analysis of mesothelial carcinogenesis.\r"

The relative risk for the highest quintile of lower leg mole counts versus no lower leg moles was 4.2. Mole counts at each site (arm, thigh, and lower leg) were associated with risk of melanoma of the trunk and lower leg, but none were associated with the risk of melanoma of the upper extremity. The absence of direct site-specificity suggests that mole counts primarily indicate systemic melanoma risk, rather than direct risk from the moles themselves.\r"

  ".U": "89279951\r", 
  ".W": "In southern Sweden during the 1960s, women began to use oral contraceptives (OCs) extensively at a young age. This case-control study investigates the relationship between the use of OCs and breast cancer development in women in southern Sweden diagnosed in the early 1980s. The risk for breast cancer after OC use among premenopausal women was modeled, after adjustment was made for age, age at menarche, and age at first full-term pregnancy or parity. Both the duration of OC use before 25 years of age and commencement of OC use at a young age were associated with a significant increase in the risk of breast cancer as well as a significant trend. The duration of OC use before the first full-term pregnancy was associated with an increased risk of breast cancer, but it did not show a significant trend. The total duration of OC use was weakly, but not significantly, associated with breast cancer development. The odds ratio for women starting OC use before 20 years of age was 5.8 [95% confidence interval (CI), 2.6-12.8]; for women using OCs for greater than 5 years before age 25, it was 5.3 (95% CI, 2.1-13.2); and for women using OCs for greater than or equal to 8 years before first full-term pregnancy, it was 2.0 (95% CI, 0.8-4.7). In multivariate analyses including the different measurements of OC use, only starting age of OC use was significantly associated with breast cancer. The exposure-response relationship between duration of OC use and risk of breast cancer depended on the age at first use of OCs. Given a fixed duration of OC use, the risk increased with younger starting age of OC use. The findings point to the importance of the early reproductive years as risk determinants for breast cancer after OC use.\r"

  ".W": "Some investigators have suggested that the marked activity of flavone acetic acid (FAA) against advanced solid tumors in mice results from an indirect effect. This study indicates that the critical effect of FAA is irreversible inhibition of tumor blood flow. Perfusion of sc Colon 38 tumors, assessed with H33342 as a fluorescent stain for functional blood vessels, was reduced to 50% of controls within 3 hours of an ip injection of 1.2 mmol of FAA/kg and was completely inhibited by 24 hours. A double-label fluorescence technique demonstrated a significant decrease in blood flow in both sc Colon 38 and im EMT-6/Ak tumors as early as 15 minutes after iv treatment with 1.2 mmol of FAA/kg, with progressively enlarging zones of perfusion failure. The rate of cell death in totally ischemic EMT-6 tumors was shown to be sufficiently rapid to represent a major component of the observed antitumor effect of FAA if the flavonoid acts via inhibition of blood flow. Further, avascular EMT-6/Ak multicellular spheroids growing in the mouse peritoneum are relatively resistant to killing by FAA administered iv or ip, despite extensive infiltration with host immune cells. These results indicate that inhibition of tumor blood flow by FAA is a necessary component of its antitumor activity against solid tumors.\r"

A likely mechanism for such biotransformation is hepatic mixed-function oxidation. At a concentration of 5 microM, MRA was incubated for 30 minutes at 37 degrees C with 1 mg of human liver microsomes/mL and 0.45 mM of NADPH. The cytotoxicity of the microsome- and NADPH-treated MRA was 44-fold higher than that of the untreated MRA in the human ovarian carcinoma cell line ES-2. This potentiation did not occur for MRA treated with boiled microsomes and NADPH, active microsomes in the absence of NADPH, or Tris buffer plus NADPH. No potentiation was observed with DOX or the highly potent cyanomorpholino derivative of DOX, MRA-CN, under any of the above conditions. After 2 hours of exposure of the ES-2 cells to microsome- and NADPH-treated MRA, dose-dependent DNA cross-links were observed with 5 nM or more of MRA, whereas only DNA strand breaks were detected in cells exposed to 500 nM of untreated MRA or MRA incubated under other conditions. These data indicate that MRA is biotransformed by the hepatic mixed-function oxidases to a potent DNA-alkylating metabolite(s), which may be important in the determination of the pharmacologic and toxicologic profile of MRA. The active metabolite(s) of MRA may be analogous to MRA-CN, which cross-links DNA without requiring bioactivation.\r"

  ".W": "A study of the effectiveness of an intervention program designed to favorably modify behaviors hypothesized to be related to the future development of cancer was initiated among 1,105 eligible children in 15 schools in the vicinity of New York City. Schools were assigned to either an intervention or a nonintervention group. Subjects in schools in the intervention group received each year, from fourth through ninth grade, a teacher-delivered curriculum focusing on diet and prevention of cigarette smoking. After 6 years of intervention, the rate of initiation of cigarette smoking was significantly lower among subjects in intervention schools than among those in nonintervention schools. There was a significant net decrease in reported intake of saturated fat and a significant net increase in reported intake of total carbohydrate among subjects in intervention schools compared to those in nonintervention schools. These findings, if replicated, suggest that such programs are feasible and acceptable and may have a favorable effect on diet and prevention of cigarette smoking in children.\r"

Preoperative knowledge of testis location is helpful to plan the location of the incision as well as the type of repair. The incidence of vanishing testis in our series is much higher than that reported previously. This difference is attributed to a careful examination with the patient under anesthesia and preoperative treatment with human chorionic gonadotropin, which made many testes palpable. These results indicate that laparoscopy can be performed safely and quickly, and that it is helpful to manage patients with a unilateral nonpalpable testis.\r"

At a threshold concentration of one microM, capsaicin also produced a warm to burning sensation referred to the suprapubic area during the collecting phase and to the urethra during micturition. All the patients with hypersensitive disorders of the lower urinary tract reported disappearance or marked attenuation of their symptoms for a few days after capsaicin application. In three other patients with hypersensitive disorders of the lower urinary tract, intravesical instillation of capsaicin's vehicle (0.1% ethanol in saline) did not produce significant cystometric changes nor modify the symptomatology. These observations provide the first indication that capsaicin-sensitive structures (nerves?) may be present in the human urinary bladder as they have been shown to occur in various other species.\r"

The animals were sacrificed one or four weeks post treatment and evaluated for renal injury. Kidneys were serially sectioned and injury volume calculations carried out. The predominant injury pattern was interstitial and perivascular fibrosis with chronic lymphoid infiltration. Dense areas of fibrosis ranged from less than 0.01% to 0.13% and from less than 0.01% to 1.04% of renal volume in those kidneys treated on the SD-3 and HM-3 respectively. Surrounding areas of perivascular and interstitial fibrosis intercalated with areas of normal appearing parenchyma were noted and were more extensive than the central scar. While the calculated volumes of parenchymal scarring are probably insignificant with respect to renal function, the surrounding areas of partial injury may be related to the development of hypertension.\r"

In the absence of treatment, renal subcapsular implantation of SN12C resulted in metastatic spread (lung, liver and lymph nodes) and death of all animals. Radical nephrectomy of the tumor-bearing kidney after various periods of tumor implantation demonstrated that surgery alone after 18 days of tumor growth resulted in no statistically significant increase in survival with 100% of the nephrectomized animals succumbing to local recurrence and distant metastases. Recombinant human tumor necrosis factor (rTNF) and VP16 (etoposide), both well known cytotoxic and cytostatic anticancer agents, were tested singly and in combination against this metastatic model of human renal adenocarcinoma. Single agent rTNF or VP16 therapy after radical nephrectomy demonstrated only minimal efficacy with no significant decrease in local recurrence and distant metastases as compared to nephrectomy only control animals. In contrast, the combination of rTNF plus VP16 when given after nephrectomy resulted in a significant decrease in local recurrence and no gross evidence of metastasis in any animal. Subcutaneously growing SN12C tumor nodules were also treated with the same rTNF, VP16 and combination regimens. Regression in tumor size was noted only in the combination treatment group. rTNF or VP16, as single agents, demonstrated only slight growth inhibition that was not statistically significant. These results suggest that by combining TNF plus VP16, a synergistic enhancement of antineoplastic activity against local as well as metastatic human renal cell carcinoma can be produced.\r"

  ".U": "89280052\r", 
  ".W": "Bioreductively activated alkylating agents (BAA) require metabolic reduction to become cytotoxic. Hypoxia induces a massive increase in reductive metabolism activating BAA to their cytotoxic form. One of these BAA agents is cis-2,3-dimethyl 1-(2-nitro-1-imidazolyl)-3-(1-aziridinyl)-2-propanol referred to as RSU-1164. In a hypoxic environment, RSU-1164 is activated to a highly reactive bifunctional alkylating agent capable of crosslinking macromolecules which results in cell death. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a treatment modality which consists of the initial accumulation of hematoporphyrin derivative (HPD) within a tumor followed by the activation of the HPD by 630 nm. light to induce a cytotoxic response. The precise mechanism of PDT is not known, however, two actions of the activated HPD have been documented. The first is a direct cytotoxic effect, secondary to singlet oxygen production. The second is through vascular collapse and subsequent hypoxia. The combination of a chemotherapeutic agent like RSU-1164, which is activated by hypoxia, with PDT to produce such hypoxia, therefore, should greatly increase the efficiency and utility of RSU-1164. To test this hypothesis, Copenhagen rats bearing established Dunning R-3327 AT-2 prostate cancers were treated with PDT treatment alone (HPD 20 mg./kg. injected IP and then 24 hr. later, the tumor exposed to 630 nm. light at 400 mW/cm.2 for 30 min. [total dose 720 J/cm.2]), RSU-1164 alone (injected IP at a dose of 200 mg./kg.) or with the combination of this PDT treatment plus RSU-1164 given 30 min. before light exposure. These results demonstrated that this combinational treatment synergistically produces a greater retardation in the growth of the AT-2 tumor than either of the monotherapies of RSU-1164 or PDT alone.\r"

Anesthesia was obtained by intradural injection (at L4-L5 level) of either xylocaine (two mg./kg. body weight) or tetracaine (0.2 mg./kg.). In monkeys, systolic blood pressure reduction (average 17.2%), slight elongation and tumescence of the penis, and increase of intracavernous pressure were noted after spinal anesthesia. Electrostimulation of the cavernous nerves resulted in longer erection and detumescence phases than obtained before anesthesia. In dogs, a similar blood pressure decrease (16.6% average) was noted after anesthesia. The response during anesthesia to electrostimulation of the erectile nerves was, however, variable. Changing the animal's position abolished the erectile response in three of four dogs while no change of erectile response due to anesthesia could be demonstrated in the remaining four dogs. We conclude that spinal anesthesia seems to enhance simian, but not canine, erectile response to electrostimulation of the erectile nerves, possibly via interference of the autonomic regulatory mechanism.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of adrenergic drugs on urethral compliance and urethral closure pressure at the proximal urethra of dogs were investigated using a new probe. The probe, with a balloon at the tip, was equipped with two generating and two detecting electrodes. The probe was inserted into the proximal urethra, and saline was then infused at a constant rate into the balloon with an infusion pump. The pressure and cross-sectional area of the urethra were recorded and a correlation curve of these parameters was drawn. The regression (of the form y = ax + b) was determined from the curve. Urethral compliance and closure pressures were obtained from the values of \"a\" and \"-b/a\" respectively, and the maximum cross-sectional area was measured when no further distension of the urethra was obtained. Urethral compliance decreased after the administration of phenylephrine, but increased after the administration of prazosin and labetalol. The urethral closure pressure decreased after the administration of dopamine and haloperidol. There was no change in either urethral compliance or closure pressure after the administration of clonidine, yohimbine, isoproterenol, or propranolol. The results indicate that adrenergic drugs work on urethral compliance, and that the alpha-adrenergic receptor of the proximal urethra is of the alpha-1 type. The changes in the urethral pressure after dopamine administration seems to be a response mediated by dopamine receptors.\r"

Intrapelvic pressure monitoring confirmed that obstruction had been produced by stent insertion and relieved by reimplantation of the left ureter following the designated obstruction period. The extent of recovery of renal function was assessed by creatinine clearance, with group C maintaining normal function, group B recovering 31% and group A recovering 8% of control function. Methyl-methacrylate extrusion casts of the renal microvasculature were made in group B and C kidneys and studied by scanning electron microscopy. During obstruction there was evidence of arteriolar constriction. These changes provide a morphological basis for the renal functional alterations and support the concept that post-obstructive renal failure is a vascular injury.\r"

  ".W": "We retrospectively reviewed the outcome of extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy in patients with renal calculi less than 3 cm. in size who were treated at a large multi-user lithotripsy center. Patients in whom indwelling ureteral stents were placed before lithotripsy treatment were subjected to higher levels of total power (shocks times voltage), yet the rate free of stones did not differ from those treated without a stent. In addition, the patients with internal ureteral stents experienced a significantly higher incidence of urinary urgency (43 versus 25 per cent) and hematuria (40 versus 23 per cent) than nonstented patients, respectively (p less than 0.05). Also, the duration of bladder discomfort was longer for stented patients (26 versus 13 per cent) as was the duration of urinary frequency (31 versus 16 per cent), compared to nonstented patients (p less than 0.05). The results suggest that use of an indwelling ureteral stent may not contribute to a higher rate free of stones for the treatment of small to medium sized renal calculi and, in fact, it may make the treatment more uncomfortable for the patient than performing lithotripsy without ureteral stenting. Of course, in selected cases (solitary kidney, large stone burden and aid in stone localization) ureteral stenting has a useful adjunctive role in extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy.\r"

  ".W": "The hydraulic ileal valve, which we developed in 1975, ensures continence by adapting to 5 different urinary reservoirs. The valve is made by isolating a 14 cm. long intestinal loop with the mesentery. The isolated ileal segment then is folded inward on itself throughout its entire length. We performed 136 continent urostomies with this hydraulic valve. An ileocecal reservoir was used in 122 patients, ileum in 8, sigmoid in 1, rectum in 1 and bladder (continent cystostomy) in 4. Indications for continent urostomy were bladder tumor in 55 patients, complex vesicovaginal fistulas in 5, neurogenic bladder in 13, vesical exstrophy in 12 and miscellaneous reasons in 5. Of the patients 103 (75 per cent) were continent immediately. Continence was obtained after repair of the valve in 24 patients (17.6 per cent). Therefore, 127 patients over-all were continent. Mean followup of our patients was 38 months (range 3 to 154 months). Continence remained excellent with self-catheterization performed easily in 88.3 per cent of the patients. Over-all, all of our continent urostomies were well tolerated biologically and radiologically.\r"

The hypertensive patients were not taking antihypertensive medication. Evaluations included standard monitoring of penile circumference change as well as noninvasive monitoring of penile segmental pulsatile blood flow and activity in the bulbocavernosus-ischiocavernosus muscles. Variables differed in how they discriminated among groups. Median amplitude of penile blood flow during rapid eye movement sleep differed significantly among all 3 study groups: controls had the highest amplitudes, patients without erectile problems had lower values and patients with erectile complaints had the lowest values. By contrast, standard measures of nocturnal penile tumescence (that is based on penile circumference change during sleep) only distinguished the patients with erectile problems from the 2 other groups. Density of musculovascular event clusters during rapid eye movement sleep (nearly simultaneous muscle activity burst, blood flow burst and circumference pulsation) distinguished the 2 groups of hypertensive men from controls. The sensitivity of the blood flow measure to changes in the hypertensive men without erectile complaints may indicate that the measure can reveal subclinical signs of developing vasculogenic erectile dysfunction.\r"

Among this group there were 5 cases (1.0 per cent) of perineal seeding. These 5 cases along with a case referred to our institution represent cases 14 to 19 in the literature. All 19 cases are reviewed to elucidate risk factors for the development of perineal seeding. Biopsy of large volume local tumors appears to be the greatest risk factor associated with 18 of the 19 cases. Technique of biopsy appears to be important in that removal of the Tru-Cut sheath and obturator may expose the perineum to a greater risk of seeding. Other factors discussed include histology, hormonal responsiveness and radiotherapy technique. Distant metastases were discovered simultaneously or within 16 months of the perineal seeding in every case, and all patients died at a median of 36 months after initial diagnosis. Perineal seeding after prostatic needle biopsy is uncommon but its occurrence suggests a poor prognosis.\r"

The bulbocavernosus muscles are separated from the urethra and the layers of the genitourinary diaphragm are opened beginning behind the symphysis pubis. The retropubic cavity is exposed and the junction of the vesical neck and vagina is identified. Double helical bites with 2-zero polypropylene sutures are taken from each side of the junction. The 2 ends of the sutures are brought ventrally with a suture carrier through a small incision just above the symphysis pubis in the midline and tied. This procedure moves the bladder neck forward and upward to the desired level by observing movement of the bladder neck through the vestibule. Of 20 patients treated 17 are fully continent and 3 remain much improved after 2 years.\r"

  ".W": "Urodynamic studies of the ileal conduit were performed in 36 patients with normal upper urinary tracts (controls) and in 32 who had progressive upper tract dilatation within 6 years preceding the study. In controls the conduit emptied mainly by means of low pressure, to-and-fro activity. In contrast, high frequency, high amplitude peristaltic activity was found commonly in patients with upper tract dilatation, such activity being consistent with obstruction of the distal conduit. Of the 32 patients with upper tract dilatation 17 underwent reoperation on the conduit as well as postoperative urodynamic studies. Among these 17 patients a decrease was observed in basal pressure in the conduit postoperatively compared to preoperatively (5 +/- 4 and 12 +/- 6 cm. water, p less than 0.001). A decrease also was found postoperatively in the frequency (4 +/- 6 and 36 +/- 28 per hour, p less than 0.001) and amplitude (34 +/- 47 and 61 +/- 28 cm. water, p less than 0.001) of peristaltic activity. Radiological improvement in the appearance of the upper urinary tracts was found in 9 patients (53 per cent) postoperatively. These findings support the hypothesis that upper tract dilatation in certain patients with an ileal conduit may be caused by high pressure activity in the presence of free ureteral reflux. Such abnormalities, which are probably the result of obstruction of the distal conduit, may be detected by means of urodynamic evaluation and may be corrected by revision of the conduit.\r"

Using nationally recommended algorithms, cholesterol levels are desirable in 50% of men and women, borderline in 12% of men and 30% of women, and elevated in 35% of men and 19% of women. Assuming that diet reduces low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels 20%, 10%, or 5%, rates of lipid medication use are projected as 2%, 5%, or 10%, respectively. Applying 6-year estimates of coronary risk derived from the original Framingham cohort to their offspring, the nationally recommended algorithm lacks specificity in women younger than 40 years and in both men and women older than 60 years. This study suggests that effective diet probably will be the cornerstone of current guidelines, and individuals aged 40 to 60 years might benefit most.\r"

Furthermore, it is estimated that 88% of those who need lipoprotein analysis, or 36% of all adults aged 20 to 74 years, are candidates for medical advice and intervention for high blood cholesterol levels.

Overall, we estimate that about 60 million Americans aged 20 years and older are candidates for medical advice and intervention for high levels of blood cholesterol, although a less intensive approach might be appropriate for elderly patients.\r"

  ".W": "Accelerated atherosclerosis is a leading cause of death in long-term survivors of heart and renal transplantation and may be exacerbated by the frequent occurrence of posttransplant hyperlipidemia. Attempts to define the mechanism for hyperlipidemia in transplant recipients are confounded by dramatic changes in metabolism and nutritional status after transplantation, as well as by treatment with multiple immunosuppressive and antihypertensive drugs. To avoid these pitfalls and to determine if cyclosporine alone adversely affects lipid levels, we measured lipoprotein levels in a prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of cyclosporine in 36 men with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Plasma total cholesterol, triglyceride, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and apolipoprotein B levels were measured at baseline, 2 weeks, 1 month, and 2 months. Significant increases of 21% in total cholesterol, 31% in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and 12% in apolipoprotein B levels occurred only in the cyclosporine group. Cyclosporine therapy alone adversely affects plasma lipoprotein levels by increasing total cholesterol levels, primarily due to an increase in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level.\r"

  ".W": "During a 1-year period of study at two plasma collection centers, 7 of 35,000 plasma donors seroconverted to the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and had stored plasma samples that predated or antedated the seroconversion period. From each donor, three to eight plasma samples that had been collected at 2- to 7-day intervals were tested for IgG and IgM antibodies to HIV with enzyme immunoassays, Western blot testing, and radioimmunoprecipitation assays. The presence of an HIV viremic phase was demonstrated by the infectivity of plasma on normal, phytohemagglutinin-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells and by the detection of HIV antigen. In 5 of these donors, HIV antigen was detected prior to or simultaneously with IgG to HIV; these HIV-antigen-positive samples overlapped an IgM immune response. The disappearance of detectable HIV antigen, and to a lesser extent plasma infectivity, was concurrent with the development of an IgG immune response. Although the improved sensitivity of a recombinant DNA-derived anti-HIV screening assay shortened the \"window period\" between initial HIV infection and antibody detection, HIV antigen and plasma HIV viremia were the only markers of HIV infection for several days in 2 donors. These results demonstrate that HIV plasma viremia and antigenemia occur prior to seroconversion in healthy plasma donors.\r"

Transfers totaled 4.7% (311/6609) of acute-care admissions during the study period but accounted for 19.1% (39/204) of in-hospital deaths. The mortality rate for transferred patients who required Veterans Administration hospitalization was 12.5% (39/311) compared with 2.6% (165/6298) for all other admissions. At the time of transfer 59 patients (19%) were judged unstable by a modification of the APACHE II classification system, yet only 19 patients were cared for en route by a physician or a nurse. In addition to higher mortality, the transferred patients had a longer median length of stay than nontransferred patients (11 days vs 7 days).\r"

  ".W": "The National Cholesterol Education Program has recommended that all laboratories be consistent, precise, and accurate in the reporting and measurement of blood cholesterol levels. In a follow-up to a 1984 survey study, we assessed the changes in reporting procedures for measurements of blood lipid levels in 16 clinical laboratories in Nebraska. Using human serum reference materials of known cholesterol concentrations provided by the Centers for Disease Control, we also assessed the precision and accuracy of measurement of blood cholesterol levels in clinical laboratories in Nebraska. Fourteen of the 16 laboratories restudied in 1987 had altered the reference range for total serum cholesterol since 1984, 86% of whom lowered the upper limit of the reference range. Eleven of 16 laboratories expressed reference ranges for total serum cholesterol in terms of patient age in 1987, while only 7 of 20 did in 1984. Gender-based reference ranges increased from 0 to 5 from 1984 to 1987. Similar trends were seen in the reporting of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations. Reporting procedures varied greatly; only 1 laboratory used National Cholesterol Education Program risk levels for measuring total serum cholesterol levels. Fifteen laboratories met the National Cholesterol Education Program recommendation for precision (coefficient of variation, less than or equal to 5%) and 78% of laboratories obtained results that satisfied the current recommendation for accuracy (within 5% of \"true value,\" as determined by the Centers for Disease Control).\r"
