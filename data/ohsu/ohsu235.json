The CyA-treated patients showed lower values of FENa than did Aza-treated patients. Values of FENa below 1% were found in 51% of CyA- and 0% Aza-treated patients (P less than .01) before RFR. The finding of low FENa values was accompanied by more prolonged oliguric and RFR phases. Furthermore, the lower the level of FENa, the higher the prolongation of renal failure. We concluded that FENa values could probably be an index of CyA nephrotoxicity in the EPP.\r"

To date, no single test fulfills these criteria, although advances in the measurement of serologic markers of prostate cancer such as prostate-specific antigen, fine-needle aspiration cytology of the prostate, and transrectal prostatic ultrasonography are being widely investigated as potential screening tests.\r"

  ".U": "88044086\r", 
  ".W": "In this article, I have addressed some of the important controversies regarding the safety and efficacy of radical prostatectomy with the preservation of sexual function: (1) How often is sexual function preserved? (2) Does preservation of sexual function interfere with cancer control? (3) Are there tricks to performing the operation? and (4) Who is a candidate? Overall, 72 per cent of patients are potent postoperatively. The probability of return of sexual function correlates with the age of the patient and the stage of the lesion. In addition, it appears that only one neurovascular bundle is necessary for the return of sexual function because 69 per cent of men who undergo wide excision of one neurovascular bundle are potent postoperatively. The question whether preservation of sexual function compromises the removal of tumor can be analyzed in several ways. On the basis of operative descriptions and the evaluation of whole-mount cross sections of prostates removed by standard radical perineal and radical retropubic techniques, it appears that the neurovascular bundles were not completely resected in the past using standard techniques. However, with knowledge of the location of these neurovascular bundles, they can now be excised more widely when necessary than was previously possible. Furthermore, evaluation of surgical margins of excision gave no indication that the nerve-sparing modification compromises the adequacy of the removal of cancer, which is determined primarily by the extent of the tumor rather than by the operative technique. However, controversy surrounding this procedure will not be settled until long-term follow-up data are available to determine whether the control of local disease and distant metastases is similar to that achieved with standard radical prostatectomies. To aid in this comparison, we have been careful not to use postoperative adjuvant hormonal or radiation therapy so that we will be able to evaluate the true impact of radical prostatectomy on the control of cancer. To preserve sexual function, a variety of fine points in surgical technique must be observed. These have been discussed in detail. It is my opinion that any patient who is a candidate for radical prostatectomy is a candidate for intra-operative assessment of the extent of tumor and the location of the neurovascular bundles. Based on this information, the surgeon can make an informed decision whether the neurovascular bundles can be safely preserved or excised widely with the specimen. In all surgical approaches to prostatic cancer, the primary goal must be excision of all tumor; preservation of sexual function should be of secondary concern.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

About 50 per cent of patients with node enlargement have no tumor on histologic examination, and 20 per cent of patients with clinically negative nodes have micrometastases. Lymph-node biopsies, including sentinal-node biopsy, are of limited staging value. Patients with lesions that do not invade the corpora and who have no palpable nodes should be followed carefully after excision of the primary tumor at 2- to 3-month intervals. If compliance with such a follow-up is doubtful, bilateral superficial groin-node dissection seems appropriate. Those with persistent adenopathy should undergo superficial lymph-node dissection first, and if positive nodes are found, bilateral deep-node dissection should then be performed. Bilateral inguinal and pelvic lymphadenectomy is recommended for patients with lesions invading the corpora with clinically negative or positive nodes because of the high incidence of lymph-node metastases in such cases. Where adenopathy persists after excision of the primary tumor, we advocate first limited pelvic dissection. If the pelvic nodes are negative or are not extensively involved, bilateral groin dissection should be performed, preferably in two stages. Percutaneous fine-needle aspiration of palpable or nonpalpable nodes can improve preoperative staging in patients with penile cancer.\r"

Cisplatin combination chemotherapy can be expected to cure approximately 80 per cent of all patients with advanced disease. Currently, cisplatin plus etoposide plus bleomycin is the standard treatment for patients with advanced disease. Newer trials are currently addressing the role of more aggressive therapy in patients with a poor prognosis while parallel trials examine the possibility of minimizing toxicity for those patients with good-risk disease.\r"

Review of the results from intensive radiological and biochemical surveillance with salvage chemotherapy for stage I tumors demonstrates that the long-term survival rate is equivalent to that achievable by conventional treatment (i.e., 98 per cent survival at 4 years). As relapses have continued to occur in the third and fourth years at the rate of 4 per cent annually, and 4 years is the limit of follow-up, further follow-up is required to be sure of the long-term picture. Prognostic factor analysis demonstrates that venous and lymphatic invasion, the absence of yolk sac differentiation, and the presence of undifferentiated cells are independently important in predicting the frequency of relapse. Using these factors, it was possible to define low-risk groups with relapse rates less than that seen after lymph-node dissection and high-risk groups with 58 per cent frequency of relapse who probably are suitable for adjuvant chemotherapy studies. Review of the results from the use of surveillance in stage I seminoma demonstrated no advantages over prophylactic radiotherapy. However, late toxicity is being demonstrated after radiotherapy and evidence is emerging that the less toxic cisplatinum analogue carboplatin may be as good as radiotherapy for metastatic disease. This offers for the first time a viable alternative to radiotherapy for consideration in the adjuvant setting in stage I seminoma.\r"

  ".U": "88044093\r", 
  ".W": "Given the data described herein, there is reason for even greater optimism about the possibility of fertility among patients with testicular cancer. Fertility issues have been and will continue to be important as different therapies for nonseminomatous cancer are proposed. For example, we previously calculated that the difference in fertility between patients who are treated with expectant therapy versus lymph-adenectomy for clinical stage I disease was only 16 patients in favor of expectant therapy. If new data on relapse rates after expectant therapy (e.g., 30 per cent) and better ejaculation preservation rates after lymphadenectomy (e.g., 85 per cent) are incorporated into this calculation, the number benefited falls to 6 patients. It has also been proposed that patients with low-volume stage IIB disease should receive initial chemotherapy and that lymphadenectomy should be reserved for those patients with residual disease. Applying these calculations along with certain additional assumptions, the difference in fertility between these two treatment alternatives is only 4 patients in favor of initial chemotherapy (P.H. Lange; manuscript in preparation). However, this approach has significantly greater toxicity. Much more must be done to improve our understanding and management of infertility in patients with testicular cancer. Additional tasks include the need to establish the exact ratio of patients with testicular cancer who have infertility that precedes or is a result of their disease, and to develop methods for predicting fertility status so that treatment can be tailored accordingly. Also, we must consolidate and improve the indications, techniques, and results for fertility-sparing lymphadenectomy in ways that have been described herein. In addition, the exact damage-to-benefit ratio for the number of courses and types of chemotherapy administered to patients will need to be studied carefully and prospectively, preferably in cooperative groups. The accelerating advances in in vitro fertilization and cryopreservation must be watched carefully, and their application to appropriate patients with nonseminomatous cancer should be encouraged. Cryopreservation before therapy should continue to be advocated. All of these tasks are extremely difficult because they require precise analysis of carefully generated statistics and difficult judgments about individual human values.\r"

  ".W": "The success of cancer therapy depends on the destruction of all viable cancer cells in the primary site, as well as in metastatic areas. Surgery alone can do little for the patient whose tumor has produced distant involvement except in those situations where surgical excision, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, or immunotherapy can be relied on to eradicate metastatic disease. Because of the paucity of systemic therapy for renal cell carcinoma, an aggressive surgical approach to the primary tumor is justifiable when all metastatic lesions can be excised or otherwise definitively treated and in experimental protocols in which adjuvant therapy of possible benefit can be combined with palliative nephrectomy. There is no evidence, however, in reported studies to suggest that routine palliative nephrectomy in patients who will not be offered adjuvant systemic therapy or radiation is beneficial. Such practice is also associated with a higher incidence of complications and mortality than is expected for resection of localized renal cell carcinoma. For these reasons, it is reasonable to recommend adjunctive nephrectomy only in certain selected instances, which include (1) the control of a patient's current symptoms related to the primary disease, for example, flank pain, hematuria, fever and toxicity, anemia, erythrocytosis, and hypercalcemia; (2) nephrectomy with the excision of a solitary metastasis; and (3) the patient who is willing to undergo experimental therapy, part of which involves removal of the primary tumor.\r"

I do not foresee any dramatic advances in the next few years, but I believe that the information gained over the last decade is being widely disseminated. We can hope that this will minimize diagnostic and treatment excesses for patients with little likelihood of progression, reduce the number and frequency of endoscopic resections for those with frequent recurrences, and limit the number of exenterative procedures.\r"

As the pathophysiology of corporal leakage syndrome is better appreciated, the role for penile reconstructive surgery will become more obvious. It may be realized that most patients with corporal leakage syndrome will be treated medically with intracavernosal pharmacotherapy. In these cases, reconstructive surgery may be utilized primarily to augment the pharmacologic erectile response.\r"

Hydrochlorothiazide (HCT) 25 mg daily was added to one group and furosemide 30 mg daily in a slow-release preparation, Lasix Retard (LR), to the other. Blood pressure decreased significantly and similarly in both groups from about 155/101 to about 144/95 mmHg (p less than 0.01). Diastolic blood pressure was lowered to less than or equal to 90 mmHg in 29% of the HCT patients and in 59% of the LR patients. Serum potassium decreased significantly from 4.05 mmol/l to 3.62 mmol/l on HCT, while the decrease on LR from 4.13 mmol/l to 4.05 mmol/l was not significant. Serum urate increased significantly, although within the normal range, on HCT. No change in fasting blood glucose or HbA1C was observed in any group. The patients were asked to report 40 different possible side-effects on a visual analogue scale at every visit. The side-effects already observed on beta-blockers did not change consistently on additional therapy with either HCT or LR. Thus, additional treatment with HCT or LR to patients already treated with beta-blockers results in an equal further blood pressure reduction, but in contrast to treatment with HCT, addition of LR does not affect serum potassium concentrations.\r"

By studying the three lines sonographically in 25 fetuses and by injecting contrast material into the deep venous system of autopsy specimens, we showed that the outer two lines do not represent the lateral walls of the lateral ventricles, but rather appear to arise from deep intracerebral veins. This finding challenges the validity of lateral ventricular hemispheric ratios in the diagnosis of early hydrocephalus, since such calculations assume that the outer lines originate from the ventricular walls rather than from veins. The results of this study reveal that the two outer lines most likely originate from deep cerebral veins, rather than from the lateral walls of the lateral ventricles.\r"

Intracranial and extracranial findings were reviewed to determine the accuracy and spectrum of the sonographic features. All 14 cases were reliably distinguished from other causes of fetal hydrocephalus (n = 58) detected during the same period by demonstrating absence of the midline echo (falx cerebri and interhemispheric fissure), fusion of the thalami, and abnormal ventricular configuration. Four cases of semilobar HP demonstrated incomplete fusion of the thalami and partial separation of the ventricles compared with alobar HP. Eight cases demonstrated a dorsal cyst including five with alobar HP and three with semilobar HP. One case demonstrated an unusual extraaxial fluid collection surrounding the brain, thought to be from rupture of a dorsal cyst. Facial features that were identified included a proboscis (three cases), midline facial cleft (three cases), and hypotelorism (five cases). Extracranial abnormalities that were identified included polydactyly (two cases), renal dysplasia (two cases), omphalocele (one case), and fetal hydrops (one case). We conclude that fetuses with HP can exhibit a spectrum of sonographic findings and that alobar or semilobar HP is reliably distinguished from other causes of fetal hydrocephalus by distinctive intracranial findings.\r"

Depending on the attenuation of the actual intraluminal bile, the pseudostone appeared peripherally calcified (five patients) or uniformly calcified (two patients). Careful analysis of the position and configuration of a suspected stone and of the outer margin of the gallbladder can help avoid an incorrect CT diagnosis of gallstones when high-attenuation thickened mucosa simulates a gallstone and low-attenuation submucosa looks like surrounding bile.\r"

In eight other cases with a single tumor, follow-up angiography showed complete disappearance of the tumor stain. In the other case, CT showed the nonenhanced low-density area. In the 12 patients with multiple lesions, ethanol injection was performed as part of an integrated treatment plan. Eleven were still alive at the end of the study (the mean follow-up period was 5.8 months). We conclude that ethanol injection may be a valuable treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma.\r"

To chart more precisely the natural course of the sonographic appearance of hepatic hemangiomas, 47 patients with 68 hemangiomas were rescanned 1-6 years after the initial study. Fifty-six lesions (82%) showed an identical appearance on follow-up study. However, 12 (18%) of the lesions had an appreciably changed sonographic appearance. Three lesions could not be found, seven were less obvious (less echogenic), one was larger, and one smaller. This study shows that once hemangiomas are identifiable sonographically in adults, they have reached a stable size and change in size or appearance only rarely. They do not continue to grow slowly over time. Furthermore, this study also confirms that the sonographic appearance in the appropriate patient can differentiate these hemangiomas relatively reliably from metastases.\r"

  ".W": "A standardized endosonographic numeric method has been developed for the detection of prostate cancer. Eighty-six men were examined with a 5-MHz, 96-element linear-array probe. Mean gray-scale amplitudes were produced by a semiautomatic method for periprostatic fat and regions of interest within the external portion of the prostate gland that were visually suspicious for prostate cancer. Mean gray-scale amplitude ratios of visually abnormal areas of prostate to periprostatic fat (Ap/Af) were calculated. Pathologic confirmation of disease was obtained in all patients. Three different numeric Ap/Af ratios were compared with digital palpation and subjective visual interpretation of sonograms. The numeric method resulted in a consistently higher specificity, accuracy, and positive predictive value when compared with palpation and subjective interpretation. The initial results suggest that this technique may also detect atypical hyperplasia.\r"

Immunosuppression related to renal transplantation or dialysis may reactivate dormant disease. Thus, symptomatic disease may be seen in those with no known history of previous coccidioidomycosis who have visited endemic areas only briefly. To determine if coccidioidomycosis produces characteristic radiographic findings in renal transplant and dialysis patients, we reviewed the records and radiographs of all patients in either of these two categories who are known to have developed active coccidioidal infection in southern Arizona since 1965. Thirty patients (12 undergoing dialysis and 18 transplant recipients) were identified. We conclude that the radiographic manifestations of pulmonary coccidioidomycosis in renal transplant and dialysis patients are highly variable. Interstitial and alveolar patterns of disease are equally likely to occur. Extrathoracic infection without evidence of pulmonary disease occurred in 11 patients (37%), but was radiographically demonstrable only as septic arthritis or perinephric abscess.\r"

  ".U": "88046515\r", 
  ".W": "The distinction between idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy and myocarditis is controversial, both clinically and pathologically. To increase diagnostic accuracy and provide prognostic information, we prospectively tested the routine application of immunofluorescence and electron microscopy in endomyocardial biopsy evaluation. Biopsy samples from a consecutive series of 79 patients with cardiomyopathy and possible myocarditis were thus evaluated by light (LM), immunofluorescence (IF), and electron microscopy (EM). Patient course was followed prospectively to determine prognostic factors. Immunoglobulin (IgG) and complement (C) in biopsy tissue were graded 0 to 3+ and an IF score was derived as 2 (IgG) grade + C grade. A highly significant association was found between IF score greater than or equal to 2 and the presence of mononuclear cells (lymphocytes plus macrophages) greater than 5/high-power field, confirmed by EM; 12 of 15 (80%) with IF score greater than or equal to 2 had inflammatory cells, vs only 2 of 64 (3%) with IF score less than 2 (p less than 0.000001). EM was used to confirm the identity of infiltrating cells and to grade myofilament loss (0 to 3+) and 11 other ultrastructural features. EM did not provide important predictive information in myocarditis, but confirmed the presence of inflammatory cells. However, the EM finding of myofilament loss provided prognostic information both in patients with and without myocarditis (p less than 0.03). Mortality at 18 months was 37% for patients with 2 to 3+ myofilament loss, vs 10% in those with 0 to 1+ loss. Moreover, myofilament loss was prognostically independent of clinical class and ejection fraction. EM determination of myofilament loss is valuable as a prognostic indicator, whether or not myocarditis is present. Routine IF and EM increase the diagnostic accuracy and prognostic information in endomyocardial biopsies from patients with suspected myocarditis or cardiomyopathy.\r"

Severity of left ventricular dysfunction is the most important adverse prognostic factor. Serious arrhythmias are common in CHF and also increase the mortality rate. Sudden death is the mode of death in about 40% of patients with severe heart failure. Multiple factors contribute to arrhythmias in CHF, including left ventricular dysfunction, myocardial ischemia, catecholamines, electrolyte disturbances, and drugs used to treat the heart failure. Minimizing or correcting these influences may be important in reducing serious arrhythmias. Antiarrhythmic drugs may be important in reducing the incidence of sudden death among patients with severe heart failure, although this has not yet been proved.\r"

  ".W": "Changes in the pharmacokinetics of antiarrhythmic agents may be anticipated in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF), although the magnitude or direction of change is not always predictable. Factors complicating antiarrhythmic therapy in patients with CHF include both physiologic changes resulting from the disease state and unwanted effects of drug therapy for CHF. The volume of distribution is often significantly decreased (by as much as 50%) and loading doses should be reduced proportionately. Decreased blood flow to the liver and kidneys and decreased hepatic drug-metabolizing activity serve to diminish drug clearance. In some cases, simultaneous decreases in volume of distribution and clearance may result in little, if any, change in elimination half-life, despite higher plasma concentrations. Conversely, the elimination half-life of antiarrhythmic agents may be doubled in patients with CHF, necessitating a reduction in dosage. In the latter case, the time needed to reach steady state is lengthened, so that premature escalation of dosage may lead to excessive drug accumulation. In terms of their pharmacodynamics, most antiarrhythmic agents have a degree of negative inotropic effect at some concentration, and patients with reduced myocardial reserve are especially vulnerable to these effects. Some of the newer agents (such as tocainide, mexiletine, and encainide) appear to cause only minimal myocardial depression. Potential complications during therapy with all antiarrhythmic agents that are of special concern in patients with CHF include diuretic-induced hypokalemia, proarrhythmia, and possible interactions with cardiac glycosides and other drugs. Therapy for patients with CHF should be initiated with low doses of the agent selected, and the dosage carefully titrated while the patient is monitored, to confirm both efficacy and the absence of adverse effects. During subsequent outpatient therapy the patient should be carefully observed for sign of unexpected reactions, toxicity, or electrolyte imbalance.\r"

  ".W": "Dietary fats play a critical role in atherogenesis and thrombosis. Both the amount of fat consumed and its composition affect various events associated with coronary artery disease. Dietary unsaturated fatty acids appear to reduce the incidence of these events, in particular polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), which exert markedly different effects on risk factors related to heart disease. The omega-3 (n-3) PUFAs, at high levels of dietary intake, significantly reduce hyperlipidemia and the production of the prothrombotic substance thromboxane, and they enhance the production of the platelet-antiaggregatory substance prostacyclin. Data from clinical trials indicate a significant reduction of levels of very low density lipoprotein (VLDL). The n-3 PUFAs also depress hepatic fatty acid and triglyceride synthesis and VLDL secretion. The n-3 PUFAs of fish oils displace arachidonic acid from tissue phospholipids and concomitantly increase n-3 PUFA levels, which inhibit thromboxane synthesis. Most significantly, in human subjects the antiaggregatory prostacyclin PGI3 is also synthesized and the net effect is enhanced antiaggregatory/antiadhesive activity. In addition, the chemotactic platelet adhesion-promoting substance leukotriene B4 is suppressed. These composite effects reduce atherogenesis and thrombosis. Fish oil n-3 PUFAs may also reduce blood pressure and blood viscosity. Through the combined vasodilatory effects via prostacyclin (PGI2 and PGI3), fish oils may improve peripheral circulation and thereby facilitate VLDL removal. The n-3 PUFAs of fish oils, by altering membrane fluidity in a specific manner, alter the activities of membrane-bound enzymes and may change receptor activity, specificity and signal transduction. Overall, these data indicate a beneficial role for n-3 PUFAs as part of a dietary approach to minimizing coronary artery disease.\r"

  ".W": "Hypercholesterolemia with increased plasma concentrations of low density lipoproteins (LDL) is a major risk factor for the premature development of coronary atherosclerosis in humans and is best exemplified by patients with familial hypercholesterolemia. The recent development of several specific competitive inhibitors of the rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase, HMG CoA reductase) has opened up an important new avenue of therapy for patients with hypercholesterolemia who are not responsive to dietary treatment alone. Three drugs, lovastatin (mevinolin), simvastatin (synvinolin) and pravastatin (CS 514), are currently undergoing clinical trials in North America and Europe; the former has recently been approved for general use. Experience with lovastatin and simvastatin in the treatment of patients with primary and secondary causes of hypercholesterolemia is reviewed. The relative potency of simvastatin appears to be greater than that of lovastatin and pravastatin but, with each drug, decreases in the plasma concentrations of LDL cholesterol of 30% to 50% can be achieved. The hypocholesterolemic effects of HMG CoA reductase inhibitors can be potentiated by combination therapy with other approved lipid-lowering medications including the bile acid sequestrants and nicotinic acid. If long-term safety can be satisfactorily established, specific inhibitors of HMG CoA reductase represent a major advance in the therapy of hypercholesterolemia and afford the potential to reduce substantially the high incidence of premature atherosclerosis that occurs in patients with persistent hypercholesterolemia.\r"

Studies have demonstrated that reduction of low density lipoprotein (LDL) levels lowers the risk of coronary events and retards the progression of atherosclerotic lesions. LDL receptors play a central role in the metabolism of LDL: they maintain cellular cholesterol homeostasis by effects on cholesterol synthesis, modulate the plasma level of lipoproteins by clearing LDL from the circulation and deliver cholesterol to the adrenal glands and gonads for steroid hormone synthesis and to the liver for bile acid synthesis. The 2 major strategies that have been developed so far to lower LDL levels involve the use of bile acid-binding resins, which bind cholesterol in the intestinal lumen, thereby leading to a decrease in intracellular cholesterol, which increases the rate of synthesis of LDL receptors and increases the rate of LDL clearance; and, more recently, the use of inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, the key enzyme in the biosynthesis of cholesterol. Further studies are required to assess whether HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, used alone or concomitantly with bile acid-binding resins, are safe and effective for long-term use in patients with elevated LDL levels.\r"

Adjunctive therapy included reduced sodium intake (initially 1 g of sodium daily, increased to 2 to 5 g daily), increased physical activity and relaxation techniques. Of the 130 protocol patients, 68 (52%) were normotensive while not taking any medication at the end of the program. Additionally, 36 patients (28%) had lower blood pressure, needed less medication or both; 26 patients (20%) did not have a positive response. Weight reduction is a useful method to control hypertension and a reasonable alternative to drug therapy.\r"

  ".W": "The incidence of coronary artery disease only weakly correlates with the percent of excess body weight; however, obesity in humans is not a homogeneous condition. Classification of obesity based on anatomic distribution of body fat allows for identification of a group of patients at increased risk for cardiovascular disease. Abdominal (upper body) obesity, measured as the waist/hip ratio, is a strong independent risk factor of cardiovascular disease and should be used to assess a subgroup in need of medical weight loss treatment. A focus on dietary fat intake and the magnitude of overeating \"caloric intake\" are central to the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease observed in the obese person. Identification of the process of overeating (magnitude of recent weight gain, episodes of weight cycling) is important in the design of successful medical nutrition treatment programs. A nutrition/medical history that includes age of obesity onset and duration of obesity provides additional criteria for assessment of risk of disease. Childhood-onset obesity and prolonged obesity (greater than 15 years) has been associated with increased cardiovascular disease risk. Recently, grades of obesity based on body mass index have provided a valuable marker for treatment. Each reduction in obesity grade (equal to delta 5 body mass index or delta 11.6 kg) is associated with a decrease in risk of medical illness. The new focus of obesity treatment should be to decrease body weight in 10% to 15% increments (equal to 1 grade) with emphasis on reducing the risk of medical illness and treatment intensity (e.g., number of existing medical visits, hospitalization).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Clinical, pharmacologic and biochemical evidence characterizes essential hypertension as a heterogeneous spectrum of pathophysiologic substances rather than the single entity it has long been presumed to be. Although the causes of essential hypertension remain obscure, 2 different mechanisms for long-term vasoconstriction that sustain diastolic hypertension in the experimental and clinical forms of primary aldosteronism and renovascular hypertension can also be identified and quantified among patients with essential hypertension. The first mechanism is renin independent, requires antecedent sodium retention and appears related to abnormal membrane transport of calcium. This vasoconstriction is identified by low plasma renin and ionized calcium and is correctable by sodium depletion or calcium channel or alpha blockade. The second vasoconstrictor mechanism is renin mediated and involves an increase in cytosolic calcium. This mechanism is quantifiable by the plasma renin level or the hypotensive response to an antirenin-system drug (converting enzyme inhibitor, beta blocker or saralasin). Depending on the state of sodium balance, these 2 mechanisms contribute reciprocally to maintenance of arteriolar tone in experimental models, in both normal and hypertensive people, and in patients with congestive heart failure. In these situations, at the extremes of the range of plasma renin values, one or the other mechanism predominates, whereas in the medium range of renin values both mechanisms can be operative. These interrelations provide a basis for applying more precisely tailored therapy and for stratifying patients pathophysiologically for further study.\r"

  ".U": "88046565\r", 
  ".W": "Thrombosis is an important pathogenetic factor in acute coronary syndromes, including unstable angina, myocardial infarction and sudden death. In all of these conditions, atherosclerotic plaque fissuring is a key inciting event. Minor injury to the vessel wall brings into play interactions between platelets and the wall. Platelet adhesion and aggregation ensue, modulated by a number of factors and substances. More severe injury to the vessel wall exposes the blood to other thrombogenic substances. Platelet deposition is also affected by rheologic (blood flow) factors at the site of injury, depending on the degree of stenosis and the resulting shear rates. The mechanism of unstable angina appears to be related to these factors in the following sequence: mild stenosis and minor injury with plaque fissuring, platelet responses, labile thrombosis, intermittent ischemia and pain at rest. Vasoconstriction may contribute to the symptoms. Although developing from the same origin, infarction may stem from a greater degree of vessel wall damage resulting in more permanent thrombus. Such considerations provide a focus for preventive strategies, including the optimal use of current inhibitors of platelet adhesion and aggregation and the application of peptide receptor blockers and monoclonal antibodies. Also important is control of rheologic factors by preventing stenosis or correcting it with angioplasty and thrombolytic therapy. Further elucidation of the critical role of thrombosis in coronary syndromes will facilitate progress toward the ultimate goal of primary prevention.\r"

The Q-wave analysis revealed less sensitivity (49%) and less specificity (83%) than ST depression (71% and 97%, respectively). The QTc criterion had greater sensitivity (80%) than ST depression but less specificity (11%). The QX/QT criterion was no different in sensitivity (74%) but had less specificity (69%). To establish the statistical evaluation of the positive predictive value in CAD, variations in the prevalence of the disease were considered. A 90% prevalence gives the best positive predictive value on all evaluated measurements, between 100% for ST depression and 89% for the QTc criterion. A 5% prevalence, however, gives an acceptable positive predictive value only on ST-segment depression (57%).\r"

The principal treatment regimen for DM was used to estimate the severity of DM. DM treated with insulin was defined as the most severe (n = 244), followed by DM treated with oral agents (n = 344) and with diet only (n = 380); 6,687 patients did not have DM. Severity of DM in patients with CAD (70% or greater diameter stenosis) was compared with that in control subjects without CAD (0% stenosis) for each of 9 anatomic locations (proximal, middle and distal portions of right, anterior descending and circumflex coronary arteries) using a retrospective case-control approach. The risk of CAD was highest in patients with DM treated with insulin (odds ratio estimate of the relative risk [OR = 3.0]), followed by patients with DM treated with oral agents (OR = 1.8) and lastly in those treated with diet alone (OR = 1.4). Severity of DM was a significant (p less than 0.05) independent predictor of CAD in a multivariate logistic regression model, whereas age at onset and duration of DM were not. The relative risk of CAD was the same (p greater than 0.05) for each of the 9 coronary segments. The data suggest that the risk of CAD increases with the severity of DM, which was a stronger predictor of CAD than duration of DM.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

It has been suggested that a failure of insulin-mediated sympathetic nervous system activation plays a role. To evaluate the role of endogenous insulin, the effects of oral glucose and oral fructose loading on BP, heart rate and norepinephrine levels were studied in 10 young normotensive volunteers (YN), 10 young hypertensive patients (YH), 10 elderly normotensive volunteers (EN) and 10 elderly hypertensive patients (EH). Fructose, 75 g/300 ml of water, elicited--in contrast to the same amount of glucose--only a small increase in insulin and glucose levels. After glucose loading, mean arterial BP decreased by 17 mm Hg in the EH group (p less than 0.001), 6 mm Hg in the EN group (p less than 0.01) and 7 mm Hg in the YH group (p less than 0.001), and did not change in the YN group. After oral fructose loading, BP did not change in any group. In all groups except the YN group, the increases in norepinephrine level and heart rate after both tests were not significantly different. These findings suggest that the BP reduction after glucose loading is related to glucose-mediated factors. A failure of insulin-mediated sympathetic nervous system activation does not appear to play a major role.\r"

The 2 drugs had comparable antihypertensive effects at rest, with mean decreases of 18 and 17 mm Hg (p less than 0.001) for supine and standing diastolic blood pressure (BP), respectively, during diltiazem treatment, and mean decreases of 21 and 18 mm Hg (p less than 0.001) during atenolol treatment. During maximal graded exercise testing, systolic BP, diastolic BP, heart rate and heart rate-BP product were significantly reduced by both drugs. However, the reductions in systolic BP, heart rate and heart rate-BP product during exercise were considerably greater (p less than 0.001) with atenolol than with diltiazem. Maximal exercise performance was essentially unchanged with diltiazem and slightly (3%, p less than 0.05) reduced with atenolol. Thus, diltiazem is effective and well-tolerated single therapy for young patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension who lead a physically active life style and compares favorably with atenolol.\r"

After gradual discontinuation of previous antihypertensive therapy and 2 weeks of placebo, the daily dose of nitrendipine (10 to 40 mg) was titrated over 3 weeks to achieve a 10 mm Hg decrease in supine diastolic blood pressure (BP) for patients entering with 90 to 99 mm Hg. For patients entering with at least 100 mm Hg, the dose was titrated to diastolic BP no greater than 90 mm Hg. Titrated dose of nitrendipine was maintained for 4 additional weeks.

A close correlation has been reported between the renin angiotensin and prostaglandin systems in CHF. Furthermore, serum sodium concentration provided an excellent index of hormonal status. In this study, these relations were examined after acute and chronic blockade of renin angiotensin system with captopril. Eight patients with advanced CHF (New York Heart Association III or IV) were studied. Before captopril treatment, all hormone levels were elevated. Mean plasma renin activity was 24 +/- 7 ng Al/ml/hour, angiotensin concentration was 221 +/- 11 pg/ml and aldosterone concentration was 82 +/- 17 pg/ml. Plasma PGE2 metabolite was 1,425 +/- 321 pg/ml. A close correlation was observed between plasma angiotensin II and PGE2 metabolite levels (r = 0.7); inverse correlations existed between serum sodium concentration and PGE2 metabolite levels (r = -0.9) and with plasma renin activity (r = -0.6). Captopril therapy reduced the plasma angiotensin II level to 38 +/- 6 pg/ml and aldosterone concentration to 15 +/- 3 pg/ml, but did not affect plasma renin activity (31 +/- 10 ng Al/ml/hour) when measured in 1 week. Paradoxically, PGE2-metabolite levels increased further (to 3,031 +/- 346 pg/ml) despite blockade of the renin angiotensin system. Serum sodium concentration no longer correlated with hormone levels. These effects were sustained at 2 months of follow-up. Thus, captopril caused a dissociation between the renin angiotensin system and prostaglandin. The activation of prostaglandin is probably due to captopril's effect on prostaglandin biosynthesis and may contribute to captopril's sustained efficacy in CHF.\r"

Rest and peak submaximal exercise heart rate was diminished by 100 mg of metoprolol administered twice daily (from 84 +/- 3 to 68 +/- 2 beats/min, p less than 0.001, and from 126 +/- 3 to 97 +/- 2 beats/min, p less than 0.001, respectively) compared with placebo. Rest and peak submaximal systolic blood pressure was also decreased (from 121 +/- 3 to 108 +/- 2 mm Hg, p less than 0.001, and from 151 +/- 4 to 124 +/- 3 mm Hg, p less than 0.001). Exercise-induced ST-segment depression of 1 mm or more from baseline occurred in 12 patients taking placebo. However, only 4 of these patients had ST depression when they exercised while taking metoprolol (p less than 0.05). Angina pectoris occurred in 4 patients taking placebo but in only 1 of these taking a beta-blocking drug. It is concluded that beta-blocking therapy renders the post-AMI submaximal stress test less sensitive for markers of exercise-induced ischemia than if the test is performed without the drug. Therefore, when using the prognostic information of published studies, it is important to define the conditions surrounding the exercise test.\r"

Standard deviations below the median were calculated from the 5th, 10th, 25th, and 50th observed percentiles while those above the median were based on the 50th, 75th, 90th, and 95th observed percentiles. Height-for-age distributions did not show significant skewness, thus, the standard deviations were calculated based on all six of the above observed percentiles. The normalized reference curves provide a highly useful data base that permits the standardized comparison of anthropometric data from different populations.\r"

We found that IDDM children fed a high-GI meal showed a significantly higher serum glucose level than those fed a low-GI meal. However, such differences were not seen when the preprandial dose of regular insulin was adjusted to the amount of carbohydrate in feedings. Thus, as long as proper adjustment of insulin is made, the type of carbohydrate in a single mixed meal does not appear to have a significant effect on the postprandial glycemic response in children with long-standing poorly controlled IDDM.\r"

Comparisons were made among three mixed-food breakfast meals comprised predominantly of either red kidney beans, bran cereal, or white bread. These meals provided equivalent levels of digestible carbohydrate, protein, and fat. The bean and bran meals contained equivalent levels of fiber while the white-bread meal contained a lower level. The postprandial glucose and insulin responses to the three meals were similar and responses also were similar after a standard whole-wheat-bread meal 4 h later. There appeared to be a reciprocal relationship between glucose and insulin responses after the lunch meal. This would influence interpretation of data regarding second-meal response.\r"

Light microscopic examination of hematoxylin and eosin-stained bone marrow biopsy specimens from the cases of acute myelofibrosis showed a trilinear proliferation of mature and immature hematopoietic cells, increased numbers of mature magakaryocytes, and marked fibrosis. In contrast, the blast cells in the cases of acute megakaryocytic leukemia showed a continuous spectrum of differentiation from small blasts to megakaryoblasts. Immunoperoxidase staining showed the blast cells in all three cases of acute megakaryocytic leukemia to be strongly positive for Factor VIII, a marker of megakaryocytic differentiation. These same blasts did not stain with markers of myelomonocytic (lysozyme), lymphocytic (Hle), and myeloid (Leu-Ml) differentiation. In contrast, the blast cells in all four cases of acute myelofibrosis were Factor VIII, Hle, and Leu-Ml negative but did occasionally stain with anti-lysozyme.\r"

Each swab was first inoculated to a 5% sheep blood agar plate and then tested for GABS antigen with the use of the TPSA and the manufacturer's instructions. Cultures were incubated anaerobically at 35 degrees C for 36-48 hours unless positive results were obtained after one night. GABS were identified with a fluorescent antibody method or a latex antibody test. From 1,616 throat swabs, 296 (18.3%) of the cultures contained GABS. The sensitivity and specificity of the TPSA were 73.3% and 94.8%, respectively, whereas the predictive values of positive and negative results were 75.9% and 94.1%, respectively. Results varied significantly, however, with different production lots of TPSA. The TPSA does not appear to provide a sensitive alternative to an anaerobic culture for detection of GABS.\r"

One hundred twelve neonates were randomly allocated to receive either amikacin-ampicillin or mezlocillin, a semisynthetic penicillin. Neonates receiving amikacin, in contrast to those receiving mezlocillin, showed significant nephrotoxicity as evidenced by a delayed postnatal fall in mean serum creatinine level (82 to 80 mumol/L [0.93 to 0.90 mg/dL] vs 84 to 72 mumol/L [0.95 to 0.82 mg/dL]) and a delayed postnatal rise in mean creatinine clearance per kilogram of body weight (12% vs 38%). Furthermore, 40% of neonates receiving amikacin-ampicillin compared with 19% of neonates receiving mezlocillin had a decline in creatinine clearance (greater than 25%). There was no relationship between amikacin nephrotoxicity and either peak or trough amikacin levels. In summary, in a controlled study of the use of amikacin and mezlocillin in neonates, the combination of amikacin and ampicillin proved more nephrotoxic to the newborn kidney.\r"

The ages of the patients and controls ranged from 5 days to 6 months. Nine patients had upper UTIs and 33 patients had lower UTIs, based on bacteremia and radiographic evidence. There were no differences between patients and controls in the percentages of strains showing hemolytic activity of E coli strains isolated from periurethral and rectal cultures. Urinary E coli strains recovered from patients showed a significantly higher percentage of mannose-resistant hemagglutination, greater P and X fimbriation, more type 1 pili, and the presence of mannose-sensitive and mannose-resistant hemagglutination when compared with E coli strains recovered from the controls. The O but not the K pyelonephritogenic serotypes were more commonly recovered from patients than from controls. The mean THP concentrations in urine (micrograms of THP per milligrams of creatinine) were 29.9 and 91.4 micrograms/mg for patients and controls, respectively. With the exception of hemagglutination properties and certain pyelonephritogenic O serotypes, other virulence factors of E coli could not be defined in our infant population. The role of THP, if any, in the pathogenesis of UTI remains unresolved.\r"

Sonograms were evaluated for adnexal volume, adnexal adherence, uterine size, and the presence of cul-de-sac fluid. Eleven (19.3%) of the 57 patients with PID, in whom adequate sonograms were obtained, had tubo-ovarian abscesses; in seven of these patients, the abscesses were diagnosed ultrasonographically before suspected clinically. Even in those patients without tubo-ovarian abscesses, the mean (+/- SD) adnexal volume in the PID group was significantly larger than that of the control group (11.0 +/- 6.8 cm3 vs 5.2 +/- 2.7 cm,3 respectively). Adnexal adherence, uterine size, and the presence of cul-de-sac fluid were not useful in differentiating patients with PID from normal controls. Pelvic ultrasonography can be a useful adjunct in the diagnosis and management of PID in adolescents and may, in some instances, provide diagnoses in the absence of clinical findings.\r"

As the chemicals used for embalming are poisonous to microorganisms, bacterial and viral cultures are futile after such funerary procedures are performed. However, embalming may act as a virtual tissue fixative, especially with arterial perfusion, and identification methods other than culture may be used to detect and identify pathogenic organisms. In the case presented here, a death from a fulminating, but unidentified, illness in a young girl was successfully diagnosed as herpes hepatitis by immunofluorescent and electron-microscopic studies of tissue obtained 3 weeks after she was embalmed and interred. Routine embalming and burial should not eliminate these diagnostic procedures from consideration in specific situations where potentially useful information may be realized.\r"

  ".W": "This review outlines the properties and function of intestinal smooth muscle and the mechanisms that underlie contraction and relaxation. Both tonic and phasic (rhythmic) contraction are mediated by an increase in intracellular calcium. Phasic contraction is paced electrically by rhythmic changes in membrane potential (slow waves) which, upon reaching a threshold, lead to opening of membrane calcium channels and the entry of calcium into muscle cells; this inwardly directed calcium current or spike initiates a cascade of events resulting in contraction. Slow waves and spike potentials and, thus, phasic contraction, are influenced by neurotransmitters, hormones, and drugs. In circular muscle, these agents can also increase calcium by releasing it from intracellular stores, thus inducing tonic contraction. Ingestion of food initiates peristaltic propulsive activity which, in its rhythm, is superimposed on spontaneous phasic activity. The peristaltic reflex consists of two successive phases: relation of circular muscle distal to the distending bolus (descending relaxation) and contraction proximal to the bolus (ascending contraction). In-between meals, a different, slower pattern of muscle activity prevails, known as the migrating motor complex, which helps to maintain the lumen of the intestine free of contents. Improved understanding of normal muscle function is beginning to reflect itself in improved management of patients with motility disorders.\r"

In the same geographic region, medical costs for patients dying of hepatic failure without transplantation were studied for years 1979 through 1984. One-yr survival in all patients transplanted without cancer was 71%, and the mean cost was $92,866. The mean cost of hospitalization for the last 12 months of life in patients who did not receive transplants was $45,643. Eight-two percent of patients surviving the first yr are fully rehabilitated and restored to pre-illness activity. Length of hospital stay, hospital costs, and the extent of rehabilitation closely correlate with a grading system based on preoperative medical status. We conclude that hepatic transplantation restores high-quality, useful life to patients with endstage liver disease in a predictable and cost-effective manner.\r"

Analysis of these cases indicates that the prognosis etiology of adenosquamous carcinoma may be similar to that of intrahepatic bile duct carcinoma. The prognosis for this tumor is very poor. Operation seems not to be an effective treatment, but radiation therapy may be of some use. Several terms, such as adenosquamous, adenoacanthoma, and mucoepidermoid carcinoma, have been used for carcinomas containing both adenomatous and squamous elements.

  ".W": "From the analysis of several studies published from 1979 to 1986 comprising 1,172 patients, we estimated that glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was normal in 85% of unselected patients on chronic lithium therapy. The remaining 15% of patients displayed only mild reduction in GFR, clustering at approximately 60 mL/min. Thus, the data available to date do not support earlier concerns that long-term lithium therapy could eventuate into renal insufficiency. The most prevalent renal effect of lithium is impairment of concentrating ability, which we estimated to be present in at least 54% of 1,105 unselected patients on chronic lithium therapy. This defect translated into overt polyuria in only 19% of unselected cases. A renal lesion confined to the collecting tubule has been described in humans who have taken lithium for short periods of time. This lesion may represent the collecting tubule's response to the intracellular accumulation of lithium, which interferes with cAMP formation and results in an early and probably reversible inhibition of antidiuretic hormone (ADH)-mediated water transport. However, long-term lithium therapy may induce a progressive and partly irreversible defect in concentrating ability. The potential risk for dehydration associated with lithium-induced polyuria, as well as the discomfort inherent to this side effect, deserves evaluation and consideration for therapeutic intervention. Amiloride has additional advantages over conventional treatment of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus using thiazide diuretics. The action of amiloride on ADH-mediated water transport seems specific in as much as it is capable of preventing the uptake of lithium in high resistance epithelia and thereby prevents the inhibitory effect of intracellular lithium on water transport. Unlike thiazides, amiloride has a weak natriuretic effect and is less likely to increase plasma lithium levels by causing volume contraction. In addition, amiloride, by conserving potassium, obviates the need for potassium supplementation that is usually required to prevent hypokalemia when thiazides are used to treat lithium-induced polyuria. Since amiloride may prevent chronic intracellular lithium accumulation in the collecting tubule, future studies should elucidate whether amiloride also has a role in preventing lithium-induced chronic tubulo-interstitial damage.\r"

  ".U": "88046765\r", 
  ".W": "To determine the frequency of gout in our renal transplant population and to identify any predisposing factors, we retrospectively examined the outpatient records of all patients transplanted between January 1980 and July 1984 in whom the allograft functioned for at least 1 year. Two hundred forty-three charts were sufficiently complete to be evaluated. Of the 211 patients receiving corticosteroids and cyclosporine (CyA) as immunosuppression, 25 had at least one documented episode of gout (9.7% of total, 11.8% of CyA patients); no episodes occurred in the 32 patients receiving azathioprine and corticosteroid therapy (P = .05). The time from transplantation to the first episode of gout ranged from 4 months to 4 years. Of the patients without gout, 103 of the 186 receiving CyA (55.5%) and eight of 32 receiving azathioprine (25%) had asymptomatic hyperuricemia (serum uric acid greater than 8.5 mg/dL for men, greater than 7.0 mg/dL for women, P less than .01). The number of patients receiving diuretics in the CyA treated group was 142 of 211 (67%) v 12 of 32 (37.5%) in the azathioprine group. However, the increased incidence of gout or hyperuricemia in patients receiving CyA was not due to the effect of the diuretic alone. There was no correlation between the serum creatinine and uric acid in either the CyA or azathioprine group (r value for CyA group = -.06 and for the azathioprine group = -.26). Compared with patients receiving azathioprine, we conclude that there is an increased incidence of gout and/or hyperuricemia in renal transplant patients treated with CyA.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

This series of papers has emphasized that although motor and vocal tics are the hallmark of TS, the complete range of behavioral problems is much broader. This spectrum of behavior can be explained on the basis of the TS gene causing an imbalance of the mesencephalic-mesolimbic dopamine pathways, resulting in disinhibition of the limbic system.\r"

  ".U": "88046779\r", 
  ".W": "Although numerous genetic markers are available for studying chimerism after bone marrow transplantation (BMT), there remains a need for a practical and highly informative method that is applicable in the early posttransplantation period. Using DNA restriction-fragment-length polymorphisms (RFLPs), we have evaluated the feasibility of developing a single synthetic oligonucleotide probe to study post-BMT chimerism. We have thus tested three candidate probes, termed O-3315-32, O-3315-80, and O-AY-29, that are homologous to tandemly repetitive sequences. Our results demonstrated donor-specific and recipient-specific fragments in 11 of 11 HLA-matched sibling pairs tested using probes O-3315-32 and O-3315-80. When probe O-AY-29 was used, 14 of 17 sibling pairs showed both donor and recipient markers, one had only a recipient marker, and two were identical. We showed that each of the three synthetic probes was effective in documenting donor marrow engraftment, mixed hematopoietic chimerism, the patient's pre-BMT phenotype (by using cultured skin fibroblasts obtained after BMT), and the origin of the malignant hematopoietic cells (i.e., of donor or recipient origin) in patients who developed recurrent hematologic malignancy following BMT. Compared with the use of cloned genomic probes, there are several important advantages to the use of synthetic oligonucleotide probes in studying post-BMT chimerism. Synthetic probes have absolute hybridization specificity and can be designed to suit the purposes of an individual study, since they have adjustable specificity that can be altered by changes in the length of the probe and by changes in the hybridization temperature. A single synthetic probe analogous to several highly polymorphic loci can have a polymorphism information content sufficiently high so that all but a small percentage of BMT patients could be followed easily; for example, if a probe were complementary to three highly polymorphic unlinked loci, it would discriminate approximately 98% of sibling donor/recipient pairs. This would be accomplished using only one restriction-endonuclease digestion and only one gel electrophoresis. Since other genetic markers, e.g., red blood cell antigens, immunoglobulin allotypes, and chromosome analysis, are not uniformly informative and, in some cases, cannot be used in the early posttransplantation period, the use of synthetic oligonucleotide probes for analysis of DNA RFLP is emerging as the method of choice for studies of post-BMT chimerism. This method will allow for the development of new knowledge that has not been possible with previous methods.\r"

HLA-B51 was present in 71 percent of the patient group as compared with 13 percent of the control group (relative risk = 17.1). In four of 30 families in the B51-positive group, there was a close relative of the proband with Behcet's syndrome who was carrying the HLA-B51 antigen. Neutrophilic chemotaxis in this group was enhanced in 80 percent of the patients, and in most patients no deposition of immunoglobulin in the dermo-epidermal junction was observed, whereas C3 was present in papillary vessels. In the B51-negative group, the family history was negative for Behcet's syndrome, neutrophilic chemotaxis was enhanced in only two of eight patients, and in four of six patients, IgM deposition was detected in the dermo-epidermal junction. It is concluded that in Israeli non-Ashkenazi Jews and Arabs, there is a significant association between HLA-B51 and the risk of developing Behcet's syndrome. The B51-positive patient group has a family history of the disease, enhanced neutrophilic chemotaxis, and a lack of immunoglobulin deposition in the dermo-epidermal junction.\r"

  ".W": "Following the adoption and use of cyclosporine as the drug of choice in the management of renal allograft recipients, several cases of symptomatic hypomagnesemia were noted. These observations prompted the current prospective study of serum concentration and urinary excretion of magnesium in 27 renal transplant recipients treated with cyclosporine and prednisone. Relevant laboratory measurements were obtained shortly before and regularly after transplantation. The results were compared with those obtained in a group of 17 allograft recipients treated with azathioprine and prednisone. The cyclosporine-treated patients showed a significant reduction in the serum magnesium concentration and an inappropriately increased urinary excretion and fractional excretion of magnesium, suggesting renal magnesium wasting. The observed hypomagnesemia required magnesium supplementation in nearly all cyclosporine-treated patients. In contrast, azathioprine-treated patients showed normal serum magnesium concentrations and required no magnesium supplementation. In conclusion, administration of cyclosporine in renal allograft recipients appears to be commonly associated with renal magnesium wasting and hypomagnesemia. Therefore, it is recommended that serum levels of magnesium be monitored regularly in renal allograft recipients receiving cyclosporine and that magnesium supplementation be employed as needed to avoid magnesium depletion.\r"

  ".W": "Bone marrow transplant recipients were found to have a 10-fold greater incidence of nosocomial Aspergillus infection than other immunocompromised patient populations (p less than 0.001) when housed outside of a high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filtered environment. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that number of infections, age, and graft-versus-host disease severe enough to require treatment were independent risk factors for development of nosocomial Aspergillus infection in this group. The use of whole-wall HEPA filtration units with horizontal laminar flow in patient rooms reduced the number of Aspergillus organisms in the air to 0.009 colony-forming units/m3, which was significantly lower than in all other areas of the hospital (p less than or equal to 0.03). No cases of nosocomial Aspergillus infection developed in 39 bone marrow transplant recipients who resided in this environment throughout their transplantation period compared with 14 cases of nosocomial Aspergillus infection in 74 bone marrow transplant recipients who were housed elsewhere (p less than 0.001). Thus, although bone marrow transplant recipients had an order-of-magnitude greater risk of nosocomial Aspergillus infection than other immunocompromised hosts, this risk could be eliminated by using HEPA filters with horizontal laminar airflow.\r"

It is increasingly apparent that patients with almost any type of urinary tract infection (except for most patients who are asymptomatic or who have pyelonephritis) may have urine concentrations of pathogens as low as 10(2) to 10(3) CFU/ml. This review documents factors that can contribute to diminished concentrations of microorganisms in urine, lists patient populations in whose urine microorganisms in concentrations well below 10(5) CFU/ml have been associated with infection, and makes recommendations for selection of laboratory tests, including rapid screens, for the diagnosis and management of urinary tract infections.\r"

Immune function usually recovers and the risk of infection decreases within six to 12 months. However, patients in whom chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) develops have persisting B and T cell abnormalities, and in vivo and in vitro studies show impaired immunoglobulin regulation and function despite normal levels of serum immunoglobulin G. This review summarizes 12 published clinical trials of immunoglobulin therapy to correct immunodeficiency and prevent infection after marrow grafting. In five controlled studies, cytomegalovirus infection developed in a total of 52 of 172 (30 percent) immunoglobulin recipients and 71 of 165 (43 percent) control patients not given globulin. In four controlled trials, interstitial pneumonia developed in a total of 21 of 127 (17 percent) immunoglobulin recipients and 40 of 94 (43 percent) control patients. Three randomized trials reported a reduced rate of GVHD or post-engraftment septicemia in immunoglobulin recipients. However, methods of immunoglobulin preparation, antibody titer, and dose and schedule of prophylaxis varied widely in these studies, as did other critical patient, transplant regimen, and supportive care factors. Accordingly, data should be interpreted with caution. Ongoing controlled clinical trials will further define the proper role of immunoglobulin therapy in bone marrow transplantation.\r"

Outcome was investigated for 28 patients with non-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy and ejection fraction of 25 percent or less who were denied transplantation due to lack of severe symptoms. One-year survival without transplantation was 46 percent. Low stroke volume and history of ventricular arrhythmias were independent predictors of early mortality. High risk, defined as either stroke volume of 40 ml or less or history of ventricular arrhythmia, identified 13 of 14 patients who did not survive one year and only one of 12 one-year survivors (p less than 0.001). Low stroke volume predicted hemodynamic failure (p less than 0.05) whereas arrhythmic history predicted sudden death (p less than 0.001). Clinical status improved in only six patients, all of whom had symptom duration of seven or less months at initial evaluation (p less than 0.001). Thus, patients referred to transplantation for dilated cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 25 percent or less have a poor prognosis even if symptoms are mild. Patients with high hemodynamic risk may require early transplantation, whereas those with high arrhythmia risk may require other aggressive therapy in order to avoid transplantation until symptoms become severe.\r"

About 50 percent of patients in each group show evidence of both disorders. It is suggested that many patients in each group show evidence of both disorders. It is suggested that many patients with either diagnosis have the same disorder and share a biologically and often genetically determined hypersensitivity of a central \"alarm\" system. Panic and hyperventilation provoked by inappropriate activation of this system are postulated to reinforce each other by a positive feedback loop. Treatments directed at any part of this loop are likely to be successful. Clinical implications of the link between these conditions are discussed.\r"
