  ".W": "Second-look surgery is used in restaging patients with ovarian cancer to define sites of recurrence, plan therapy, and perform tumor debulking. We evaluated the role of CT in detecting residual or recurrent tumor in 55 patients in whom 64 abdominopelvic CT scans were obtained. Forty-eight patients underwent a second-look operation, and eight of these patients had an additional third-look operation. CT correctly identified 17 (85%) of 20 cases with residual or recurrent pelvic disease and three (75%) of four cases with bulky abdominal disease. CT failed to detect tumor in any of the five cases with minimal abdominopelvic disease and was able to detect carcinomatosis in only two (8%) of 24 cases. In four cases, CT detected pelvic disease not identified on clinical pelvic examination. On the 56 scans in 48 patients with surgical proof (280 surgical findings), CT had a sensitivity of 40% (22/55) and a specificity of 99% (224/225). In seven additional patients, second-look laparotomy was canceled because of CT findings of extensive, unresectable tumor. We conclude that CT provided valuable information regarding residual or recurrent tumor prior to second- and third-look surgery. In selective cases, CT findings obviated unnecessary surgery. However, the CT's lack of sensitivity in identifying minimal abdominopelvic disease and carcinomatosis precludes its use as a substitute for second-look surgery.\r"

Patients who had nonrenal causes of azotemia, nephropathy caused by iodinated contrast material, or serum creatinine levels that were declining while the patients were receiving medical therapy before angioplasty were excluded from the study. Angioplasty resulted in a significant (greater than 20%) decline in the level of serum creatinine (average, 2.7 mg/dl before to 1.7 mg/dl after) in 43% of these patients during an average follow-up period of 16 months. A significant decrease in the level of serum creatinine was seen in 61% of patients with bilateral stenosis, 38% of patients with unilateral stenosis with absent contralateral renal blood flow, and 38% of patients with unilateral stenosis and normal contralateral renal blood flow. Recapture of lost nephron function was least successful in patients whose levels of serum creatinine were greater than 4.0 mg/dl (14%); this included one (11%) of nine patients who were already on hemodialysis. We conclude that angioplasty of the renal artery can play a major role in the treatment of patients who have mild azotemia and bilateral stenosis of the renal artery. It is less successful in treatment of patients who have severe azotemia and those who have unilateral disease.\r"

We reviewed retrospectively the bone scans (technetium-99m methylene diphosphonate) of 23 ballet dancers with pain in the back and/or lower extremities to determine the usefulness of scintigraphy in the detection of stress lesions of bone. The scintigraphic studies in 19 dancers identified multiple areas of stress injury in both symptomatic and asymptomatic locations. Thirteen dancers had 22 stress fractures (microfractures of trabeculae with associated bone repair) manifested by an intense focus of increased uptake of radiopharmaceutical, and 19 dancers had stress reactions (areas of accelerated remodeling and resorption of bone) demonstrated by diffusely increased uptake of radiotracer. Ten of the 13 dancers with stress fractures were symptomatic and six of the 19 dancers with stress reactions were symptomatic. The radiographs of 10 dancers with positive bone scans were normal or showed no distinction between acute and chronic injuries. Stress fractures were most prevalent in the feet, and stress reactions were most prevalent in the tibiae. The study confirmed that ballet dancers sustain significant bone stress in their legs and feet. Our results show that scintigraphy can be used to detect stress fractures and stress reactions at both symptomatic and asymptomatic sites in this population.\r"

The joint is situated between the medial aspect of the posterior superior iliac spine and a rudimentary transverse tuberosity just lateral to the second sacral foramen. Some joints are true diarthrodial joints and are present at birth, but more commonly they are acquired fibrocartilaginous joints that result from the stress of weight-bearing. Our experience suggests that the accessory sacroiliac joint is not rare and that it is visible on CT scans in many patients.\r"

Eleven patients were over 50 years old and presented with long-standing back pain. All were examined with conventional radiographs; three cases also had CT examinations. In thirteen patients, the tumor originated in the vertebral body and, in one patient, in the posterior element of a vertebra. In nine (64%) of the 14 cases, osteosclerosis was a prominent feature. In the remaining five cases (36%), the bone lesion was purely osteolytic. Involvement of the intervertebral disk was found in three patients; in two of these the tumor extended to an adjacent vertebra. In nine patients, a soft-tissue mass was a distinctive additional feature. A sclerotic and/or osteolytic lesion in a vertebral body with a large, paraspinal soft-tissue mass in an older patient with long-standing back pain should raise the possibility of a chordoma.\r"

The reason for the predominantly right parahilar location of these pseudocysts remains uncertain. Pulmonary pseudocysts are almost always right-sided and are associated with pulmonary interstitial emphysema and pneumothoraces; complete resolution usually occurs.\r"

Gray-white matter differentiation was seen in all patients, and changes occurring with age were documented. Three distinct patterns were seen, and age ranges were established for each pattern in developmentally normal children: (1) infantile (birth-6 months); (2) isointense (8-12 months); and (3) early adult (10 months onward). There was a statistically significant difference between the age ranges of the normal and developmentally delayed children showing all three patterns. These data should be helpful for identifying and following sequentially both infants with clinically suspected developmental delay and those with dysmyelinating or demyelinating disease.\r"

Heavily T2-weighted studies were obtained for 10 patients, and balanced (long TRs, short TEs, spin density, proton density) pulse sequences were obtained for four patients. We examined the studies of morphologically normal periventricular white matter and developed a white matter water index to determine if a slight increase in signal was present that could be ascribed to low levels of edema. Comparison was made to an age-matched control group. We also examined five patients with sodium MR imaging. Two of the 11 patients had focal areas of increased signal in their periventricular white matter. Presumably, these are areas of increased edema above the background that could not be detected on the CT scan. The white matter water index for the normal controls was an average of 0.479 (+/- 0.015), while that of the pseudotumor cerebri group was 0.520 (+/- 0.016). This indicates an increase in the white matter water signal. We believe this represents a diffuse low level of edema. These findings are consistent with previous estimates of the increase in brain water in patients with idiopathic pseudotumor cerebri. The patients with focally abnormal proton studies demonstrated similar abnormalities on their sodium studies.\r"

Although MR imaging, especially with recent technological improvements, has been shown to be at least competitive with, and often superior to, myelography and postmyelography CT in the study of intramedullary and extradural disease, its use in the assessment of intradural extramedullary disease has been questioned. We selected 12 patients with intradural extramedullary disease as demonstrated by positive CSF cytology and/or myelographic findings and performed MR examinations on them before and after administering gadolinium-DTPA (0.1 mmol/kg). Gadolinium-DTPA was extremely effective in depicting intradural extramedullary disease of the spine. Small nodules of 3 mm, virtually invisible on noncontrast MR scans, enhanced strongly and were easily detected. In addition, leptomeningeal spread of tumor along nerve roots was also visualized, sometimes more readily than by myelography and postmyelography CT. The remarkable sensitivity of gadolinium-DTPA to intradural extramedullary disease assures its role in future MR examinations of the spine.\r"

Careful integration of the findings on sagittal and axial T1-weighted images with more T2-weighted axial images was important for analysis. Anterior and lateral recess scars were hypo- or isointense on T1-weighted sequences and hyperintense on more T2-weighted sequences relative to the \"parent\" anulus intensity. Free fragments demonstrated a slightly hyperintense signal intensity on T1-weighted images relative to epidural fibrosis but had a similar hyperintense signal intensity on T2-weighted sequences. Prolapsed or extruded disk fragments were hypo- or isointense relative to the parent anulus on all sequences. Morphology, epidural location, mass effect, and often signal intensity were the important parameters by which scar and herniated disk could be differentiated with MR.\r"

The panel selected was useful in classifying an acute leukemia as acute lymphocytic (ALL) or acute nonlymphocytic (ANLL), which is of primary importance for therapeutic considerations. Common ALL (CALLA) (J5) was a good marker for classifying the leukemia as ALL. Monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) T1 and/or T11 further delineated the lymphoid leukemia as T-cell ALL while MoAbs B4 or B1 delineated the lymphoid leukemia as non-T-cell ALL. Eighteen cases of ALL were diagnosed and consisted of five cases of T-cell ALL and 13 cases of non-T-cell ALL. Both the T-cell ALL cases and non-T-cell ALL cases were found to be heterogeneous and could be further subgrouped by phenotypic expression with additional MoAbs in the panel. A monoclonal antibody panel consisting of My4, My7, My9, Mo1, and Mo2 was useful in characterizing an acute leukemia as ANLL. This panel was less useful in distinguishing myeloid from monocytic subtypes although My4, Mo1, or Mo2 when present, appeared to favor a monocytic component. Of interest, a case of biclonal leukemia with two distinct blast populations on the flow cytogram was discovered. Morphology alone was successful in diagnosing ALL from ANLL in 35 cases (70%). It was not useful in distinguishing non-T-ALL cases from T-ALL cases. The ambiguous cases could be resolved by cytometric means. Flow cytometry has much to offer as a diagnostic aid in the evaluation of acute leukemia.\r"

Commercial antisera to human plasma transthyretin (prealbumin) did not stain the amyloid deposits, but in every case a positive staining was obtained with antibodies raised against transthyretin-related amyloid fibril whole protein isolated from the myocardium of a patient with familial amyloid polyneuropathy from the state of New York. The FAP type IV amyloid deposits stained also with antiserum to serum amyloid P component, but did not stain with antisera to retinol-binding protein, amyloid A protein, gamma-trace protein, beta 2-microglobulin, or immunoglobulin light chains. The serum level of serum transthyretin was significantly decreased in FAP type IV patients (256 +/- 75 (SD) mg/L, n = 15) as compared with Finnish control subjects (360 +/- 56 mg/L, n = 30, P less than 0.001), whereas the level of retinol-binding protein was within the normal range. The results of this study strongly suggest that the amyloid fibril protein in FAP type IV amyloidosis is related to transthyretin.\r"

Individuals with these disorders demonstrate elevated levels of fetal hemoglobin and lowered levels of adult hemoglobin during adult life. This phenotype could be either the result of an abnormality in the switching process or the result of two independent mutations: one mutation increasing the level of fetal (gamma) gene expression and another mutation decreasing the level of adult (beta) globin gene expression. Here we demonstrate that the adult beta genes linked to two different forms of ndHPFH, G gamma beta + HPFH and Greek ndHPFH, produce normal levels of correctly processed mRNA in transient-expression systems. We also report that the nucleotide sequences of the beta genes are normal. These results indicate that these gamma gene promoter mutations are linked to functionally normal beta-globin genes and are consistent with the hypothesis that these mutations interfere with the normal switching process.\r"

The histamine (H2)-receptor blocker cimetidine was studied to determine whether protection of the gastric mucosa of normal volunteers could be provided against a single dose of aspirin, 1,300 mg. Gastric mucosal injury was assessed with gastroscopy performed two hours after aspirin intake. Three liquid cimetidine doses were administered over 24 hours prior to the aspirin dose, the last dose one hour before the aspirin. The 200-mg and 400-mg doses of cimetidine protected a sufficient number of subjects to warrant further study. In the second study, these two doses were further examined to determine whether three doses were necessary and whether the final dose could be coadministered with the aspirin instead of one hour before. Concomitant administration of a single dose of cimetidine with aspirin was found to protect the gastric mucosa from aspirin damage as effectively as the other cimetidine regimens employed. A final, double-blind comparison of cimetidine, 200 mg, with placebo administered with the aspirin, 1,300 mg, confirmed that cimetidine protected the gastric mucosa from the hemorrhagic effects of aspirin.\r"

However, few other T-lineage markers were found, and none of the cases tested (6 of 7) bound antibody recognizing the constant region of the beta TCR protein. Each case showed exclusively germline configurations of DNA for the beta TCR genes in Southern blot analyses with the use of several different combinations of restriction enzymes and DNA hybridization probes. One case contained clonal rearrangements of the gamma TCR gene and of the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene. Our results suggest that certain cases of peripheral T-cell lymphoma may lack rearrangements of TCR genes--particularly those cases expressing restricted numbers of T-lineage antigens. In view of these findings, failure to detect rearrangements of TCR genes by Southern blot analyses is not necessarily inconsistent with malignant lymphocytic proliferations in T-lineage neoplasia.\r"

At the onset of the disease, monoclonal antibodies against a myelin/oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) were injected intravenously. This antigen is exposed on the surface of central nervous system myelin and oligodendrocytes. Intravenous injection of the antibody in the course of T-cell-mediated transfer EAE augmented the severity and duration of clinical signs and resulted in the formation of large, confluent demyelinated plaques.\r"

Aqueous extracts prepared from pulmonary granuloma lesions induced in mice by Sephadex G-50 beads contained high levels of interleukin-1 (IL-1) activity but not interleukin-2 (IL-2) activity. IL-1 activity in the extracts correlated with granuloma size. In a subsequent step, large granulomas were induced by the intratracheal injection of Sepharose 4B beads coupled to fractions of the extracts containing IL-1 activity (ie, granuloma-derived IL-1) prepared from Sephadex G-50-induced granulomatous lungs. In addition, large granulomas were induced by the intratracheal injection of recombinant IL-1-coated Sepharose 4B beads. In contrast, very small granulomas were seen when IL-2-coated or plain Sepharose 4B beads were injected into mice.

Four cases of systemic anaphylaxis were observed. The main associated allergic disorder was pollinosis (16/20). Food allergy to other vegetable products, mainly other Umbelliferae and apples, coexisted with celery allergy in 12 cases. It was found that celery allergy is mediated by IgE antibodies: it is easily diagnosed by skin tests (fresh extracts of celery may be used) and by adequate RAST (17 positive results). Cosensitization with mugwort pollen (14 cases) and birch pollen (9 cases) was found. Celery allergens responsible for clinical sensitization originate chiefly in the tuber and are at least partly thermally labile. The frequent association with pollen sensitization suggests the existence of common antigenic epitopes in celery extracts and mugwort and birch pollens. The immunologic investigations carried out so far (RAST inhibition and immunoprint) seem to support this hypothesis.\r"

  ".W": "STUDY OBJECTIVE: To confirm the antitumor efficacy of treatment with interleukin-2 and lymphokine-activated killer cells in patients with metastatic renal cancer. DESIGN: Nonrandomized, phase II clinical trial. SETTING: Tertiary care units in university medical centers. PATIENTS: Consecutive trial of 35 patients with metastatic or unresectable renal cell cancer who have bidimensionally measurable disease, performance status 0 or 1, and normal function of all vital organs. Thirty-two patients completed interleukin-2 priming and received at least one lymphokine-activated killer cell infusion. Three patients were removed from the study and did not receive infusion of cells secondary to rapid tumor progression or toxicity. INTERVENTIONS: Patients initially received recombinant interleukin-2, 100,000 units/kg body weight every 8 hours, on days 1 to 5 in a priming phase to stimulate lymphokine-activated killer cell precursors and effector activity in vivo. Leukapheresis was done on days 8 to 12 and lymphocytes were cultured in vitro with interleukin-2 for 3 to 4 days to amplify lymphokine-activated killer cell activity. Finally, interleukin-2, 100,000 units/kg every 8 hours, was infused with cultured cells on days 12 to 16. All doses of interleukin-2 and lymphokine-activated killer cells were administered in intensive care units. MEASUREMENTS and MAIN RESULTS: The mean number of doses of interleukin-2 administered during the priming phase was 12.9 +/- 0.4; the mean number of lymphokine-activated killer cells reinfused was 7.0 +/- 0.6 X 10(10); and the mean number of interleukin-2 doses administered during the last phase was 10.2 +/- 0.6. The overall objective response rate was 16%; two patients had complete responses and three patients had partial responses with greater than 50% reduction of all measurable tumor. The complete responders remain disease-free at 12 and 9 months. Two partial responders have not had tumor regrowth at 16 and 15 months. The third partial responder relapsed at 4 months. Toxicity was severe but generally of short duration and manageable. There were no treatment-related deaths. Hypotension, weight gain, anemia, and elevations of serum creatinine levels and liver enzymes were common. Two patients required intubation; one patient had a myocardial infarction. Conclusions: This phase II study confirms the antitumor activity of interleukin-2 and lymphokine-activated killer cell therapy in patients with metastatic or unresectable renal cell cancer. Response rates, especially complete remission rates, are comparable or better than rates achieved with other forms of therapy.\r"

Mean age at onset was 40 years, with a female-male preponderance (2.7:1). Neurological features of endemic tropical spastic paraparesis are predominantly those of a spastic paraparesis with variable degrees of proprioceptive and/or superficial sensory impairment. Using enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay (ELISA), IgG antibodies to human T-lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I) were present in 82% of sera and 77% of cerebrospinal fluids. On Western blot analysis, IgG antibodies detected the p19 and p24 gag-encoded core proteins in both serum and cerebrospinal fluid. Titers were tenfold higher by ELISA in serum than in cerebrospinal fluid, and some oligoclonal bands present in fluid were not seen in serum. Serum-cerebrospinal fluid albumin ratios were normal, and IgG indexes indicated intrathecal IgG synthesis. Histopathological changes showed a chronic inflammatory reaction with mononuclear cell infiltration, perivascular cuffing, and demyelination that was predominant in the lateral columns. In 1 patient, a retrovirus morphologically similar to HTLV-I on electron microscopy was isolated from spinal fluid. Our investigations show that endemic tropical spastic paraparesis in Jamaica is a retrovirus-associated myelopathy and that HTLV-I or an antigenically similar retrovirus is the causal agent.\r"

Similar clinical, laboratory, and epidemiological findings have been reported in widely remote geographical regions of the world, with very similar clinical pictures of TSP in all high-incidence regions. The demonstration of IgG antibodies in serum and cerebrospinal fluid of patients with TSP in the Caribbean and Seychelles Islands, southern Japan, and the Ivory Coast indicate that the HTLV-I retrovirus could be the cause of this \"tropical\" myeloneuropathy.\r"

By means of agarose isoelectric focusing and selective immunoblotting we demonstrated an increased intrathecal synthesis of IgG antibodies to HTLV-I in the spinal fluid. Unique oligoclonal bands of IgG antibodies to HTLV-I were present in the cerebrospinal fluid. Using a battery of monoclonal antibodies we also found in these patients an increased number of circulating T cells that expressed activation markers.

Central nervous system dysfunctions can complicate full-blown acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) but can also be present either in isolation or in the context of AIDS-related complex. Remarkably bland histopathological findings have been reported in some patients with AIDS dementia in the presence of severe clinical dysfunction. Thus, to understand the cytopathic properties of HIV, we recovered five viral isolates from 4 patients with neurological symptoms of AIDS and identified them as HIVs. The replication and cytocidal properties of these isolates were compared with lymphadenopathy-associated virus in vitro. All five isolates exhibited replication efficiency equivalent to lymphadenopathy-associated virus, but four isolates did not kill CD4 (T4+) cells. These findings provide evidence for the existence of replication-competent noncytocidal natural variants of HIV and raise the possibility that, in some AIDS patients, neurological disorders might be caused by HIV variants that are noncytocidal to T4 cells.\r"

It was responsible for a significant decrease in susceptibility towards most penicillins and cephalosporins, except imipenem, temocillin, and cephalosporins which have a 7-alpha-methoxy substituent. Synergy between either ampicillin, piperacillin, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, or aztreonam and three beta-lactamase inhibitors (clavulanic acid, sulbactam, and YTR 830) was generally found for different strains harboring CTX-1. This enzyme may be related to or derived from the TEM enzyme, since an intragenic probe of the TEM-1 gene hybridized with a fragment of the plasmid carrying CTX-1.\r"

Dihydrofolate reductase inhibitors (trimethoprim, diaveridine, and pyrimethamine) used alone were ineffective against P. carinii. All drugs were well tolerated except pyrimethamine, which caused bone marrow depression; folinic acid ameliorated this adverse reaction but did not interfere with P. carinii treatment.

  ".W": "Mitral valve repair has been increasingly used at our hospital for mitral regurgitation with and without coronary disease. From January, 1984, to June, 1987, of 338 patients undergoing all forms of mitral valve surgery, 140 had first-time surgery for pure mitral regurgitation: 75 had valve repair, and 65 had valve replacement. Thirty-three of 75 (44%) had concomitant coronary bypass in the repair group, while 21 of 65 (32%) had coronary bypass in the replacement group. The mean functional class (3.4 versus 3.5), age (60 versus 61 years), and preoperative hemodynamics were similar in both groups. The cause of mitral regurgitation in the repair group was myxomatous change in 32 patients, ischemia in 27, rheumatic valve disease in 12, and endocarditis in 4. A Carpentier ring was used in 46, a Duran ring was used in 11, and none was used in 18. The operative mortality was 3 of 75 patients (4%) in the repair group, all with coronary artery bypass grafting, versus 2 of 65 patients (3%) in the replacement group, 1 of whom had undergone coronary artery bypass grafting. The mean postoperative functional class 15 months postoperatively was 1.12 in the repair group versus 1.15 in the replacement group. There were 7 late deaths in the replacement group and only 3 late deaths in the repair group. Actuarial survival at 30 months was 85 +/- 6% for the replacement group and 94 +/- 4% for the repair group. There were 5 late emboli (1 fatal, 4 nonfatal) after valve replacement and none after valve repair (p = 0.03).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Tissue culture of over 50 cervical cancers resulted in the development of several cell lines but none of these expressed HSV information. The permanent cell line, Cx106, which was generated was found to contain multiple genome copies of human papillomavirus (HPV) type 16. Southern blot analysis of nine cervical cancers showed an authentic 2.8 Kb fragment of HSV-2 DNA in one of the tumours. This piece of viral DNA maps in a morphological transforming region of the HSV genome. Superinfection of cervical cancers with temperature-sensitive (ts) mutants of HSV 1 and 2 did not generate recombinant virus, suggesting tht HSV DNA was not present in the tumours studied. An attempt to identify latent HSV close to the cervix in organ cultures of uterosacral ligament tissues resulted in reactivation of virus in several instances. These results are discussed against a background of decline in acceptance by many, for the HSV link with cervical cancer, and the dramatic impact of the discovery of a close relation between HPV type 16 and lower genital tract neoplasia.\r"

Deconvolution of the nuclear medicine data by a point source response function (PSRF) acquired previously in a scattering medium attempts to compensate for scattered radiation within the patient. The average geometric response of the collimator of the gamma camera is also compensated for with this technique. Three patients with known metastatic lesions in the liver and three with primary lesions in the brain were imaged. Clinical assessment of reconstructed slices both before and after deconvolution demonstrates that compensating for the effects of scatter and of collimator blurring leads to enhanced detail of pathological lesions. In all cases, cold lesions seen prior to deconvolution were enhanced in detail and, in addition, new lesions were seen with this technique.\r"

Four patients were excluded because the lesions were easily detected by gross examination. Eight patients were subjected to study by these two methods. As methylene blue injection required a positive angiography, it was possible only in five patients. In two of these five patients, non-bleeding lesions were present outside the intestinal segments localized by this method. Enteroscopy was simple, accurate and reliable in seven patients. Complete enteroscopy was impossible in one patient with advanced lymphoma because the intestine and its mesentery were matted together. Fortunately, the bleeding ulcers were still within the reach of the endoscope. Enteroscopy localized bleeding small intestinal lesions more exactly than methylene blue injection so that the length of gut resection could be shorter. We, therefore, conclude that enteroscopy is the better intra-operative localization procedure.\r"

On the basis of histologic, immunohistochemical, and electron microscopic studies, the authors classified this tumor as a pleomorphic T-ML, large cell variant with peripheral helper/inducer T-cell phenotype (Leu1/CD5+, Leu4/CD3+, Leu5/CD2+, Leu9/CD7+, and Leu3/CD4+). The extreme pleomorphism of lymphoma cells, the numerous giant cells, and the presence of tumor nodules with two or three concentric layers were the three striking morphologic features of our case. Tumor cells showed an inconstant but true positive staining with anti-LeuM1/CD15 and LeuM3/CD14 antibodies. Vimentin positivity could be related to the presence of intermediate filaments at ultrastructural level. Neuron-specific enolase reactivity was a peculiar but unexplained feature. Furthermore, the positivity of the surface markers Ki-1/CD30, anti-Tac/CD25 and HLA-DR, and the nuclear marker Ki-67 suggested an activation state and a high proliferative activity of the tumor cells. This study emphasizes the usefulness of combined pathologic methods in order to rule other diagnoses such as undifferentiated carcinoma, malignant melanoma, malignant histiocytosis, B-cell lymphoma and interdigitating reticulum cells sarcoma, in view of an extremely polymorph tumor proliferation. This is apparently the first completely documented case report of a primary gastric pleomorphic T-ML of peripheral T-cell origin.\r"

  ".W": "The goal of this study was to determine the prognostic utility of the exercise thallium-201 stress test in ambulatory patients with chest pain who were also referred for cardiac catheterization. Accordingly, 4 to 8 year (mean +/- 1SD, 4.6 +/- 2.6 years) follow-up data were obtained for all but one of 383 patients who underwent both exercise thallium-201 stress testing and cardiac catheterization from 1978 to 1981. Eighty-three patients had a revascularization procedure performed within 3 months of testing and were excluded from analysis. Of the remaining 299 patients, 210 had no events and 89 had events (41 deaths, nine nonfatal myocardial infarctions, and 39 revascularization procedures greater than or equal to 3 months after testing). When all clinical, exercise, thallium-201, and catheterization variables were analyzed by Cox regression analysis, the number of diseased vessels (when defined as greater than or equal to 50% luminal diameter narrowing) was the single most important predictor of future cardiac events (chi 2 = 38.1) followed by the number of segments demonstrating redistribution on delayed thallium-201 images (chi 2 = 16.3), except in the case of nonfatal myocardial infarction, for which redistribution was the most important predictor of future events. When coronary artery disease was defined as 70% or greater luminal diameter narrowing, the number of diseased vessels significantly (p less than .01) lost its power to predict events (chi 2 = 14.5). Other variables found to independently predict future events included change in heart rate from rest to exercise (chi 2 = 13.0), ST segment depression on exercise (chi 2 = 13.0), occurrence of ventricular arrhythmias on exercise (chi 2 = 5.9), and beta-blocker therapy (chi 2 = 4.3). The exclusion of myocardial revascularization procedures as an event did not change the results significantly. Although the number of diseased vessels was the single most important determinant of future events, the exercise thallium-201 stress test when considered as a whole (which included the number of segments demonstrating redistribution on delayed thallium-201 images, change in heart rate from rest to exercise, ST segment depression on the electrocardiogram, and ventricular premature beats on exercise) was equally powerful (chi 2 = 41.6). Combination of both catheterization and exercise thallium-201 data was superior to either alone (chi 2 = 57.5) for determining future events. Exercise stress test alone (without thallium-201 data) was inferior to the exercise thallium-201 stress test or cardiac catheterization for predicting future events (chi 2 = 30.6).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Their mean age was 54 +/- 10 years (+/- 1 SD). Sixty-one percent had unstable angina, 23% had prior myocardial infarction, 86% had one-vessel disease, and 92% had normal left ventricular function. Sixty-seven percent of patients had left anterior descending artery stenosis. Angiographic success was achieved in 84% of patients. Coronary bypass surgery was required in 9.6% of patients, in 5.9% as an emergency procedure. There were no in-hospital deaths. Follow-up at 5 years was 100% complete. There were 15 late deaths (96.3 +/- 1.0% survival), including seven of cardiac cause (98.1 +/- 0.7% cardiac survival). Myocardial infarction occurred in 24 patients (94% freedom from myocardial infarction), coronary bypass surgery was required in 63 (84% freedom from bypass surgery), and 365 patients (85%) were asymptomatic at follow-up. At 5 years, 83 patients (20%) had required an additional PTCA. Unstable angina pectoris and proximal left anterior descending coronary artery stenoses were present in 162 patients. The overall survival and cardiac survival in this subset was 94.4 +/- 1.8% and 98.1 +/- 1.1%, respectively. The excellent survival and low event rates over 5 years in this population support the concept that PTCA is safe and effective for patients with symptomatic angina pectoris, single-vessel disease, and normal left ventricular function.\r"

Ages at death ranged from 6 to 27 years (mean, 18 years); the median interval between the last risk factor examination and death was 3.5 years. More extensive aortic surface involvement with FS was observed in blacks (n = 11) as compared with whites (n = 33; 37% vs 16%, p = .0003). This racial difference was independent of age at death, and was seen in both male and female subjects. Black-white differences in several of the previously measured risk factors (serum lipids and lipoproteins, blood pressure, and obesity) were also observed, and in both races, aortic FS were related to several of these characteristics. (For example, the correlation between levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and aortic FS was 0.49 in whites and 0.73 in blacks.) However, even after controlling for antemortem levels of risk factors, blacks had an additional 16% surface involvement with aortic FS as compared with whites (p less than .001). These findings suggest that the more extensive surface involvement of the aorta with FS in young blacks is not due to differences in clinical risk factors. Because more extensive raised lesions are found in white adults, the transition of FS to advanced atherosclerotic lesions may differ in whites and blacks.\r"

  ".U": "88165450\r", 
  ".W": "We investigated the effect of coronary artery bypass grafting on the rate of left ventricular relaxation as defined by the time constant for isovolumetric relaxation, T, measured in milliseconds. Completeness of relaxation at rapid heart rates was determined by comparison of the relationship between left ventricular pressure and echocardiographic left ventricular cross-sectional cavity area during rapid ventricular pacing with that obtained after a prolonged diastole when the ventricle was maximally relaxed. Twelve patients with coronary artery disease had significantly higher T values (94.5 +/- 6.2) than six patients without coronary artery disease who were undergoing other open heart procedures (39.5 +/- 5.0, p less than .001). T was significantly reduced after coronary artery bypass grafting (68.2 +/- 5.1, p = .007), but was unchanged in the six control patients after cardiopulmonary bypass (37.8 +/- 4.5, p = .54). Similar changes were found during rapid pacing to 100, 120, and 140/min. Incomplete relaxation was detected in three of 10 (heart rate 120 beats/min) and nine of 11 (heart rate 140 beats/min) patients with coronary artery disease and this decreased to 0 of 10 (heart rate 120 beats/min) and six of 11 (heart rate 140 beats/min) patients after coronary artery bypass. Incomplete relaxation before bypass at a heart rate of 120 beats/min averaged 0.9 +/- 0.3 mm Hg. At a heart rate of 140 beats/min, incomplete relaxation averaged 5.6 +/- 1.6 mm Hg before and 1.4 +/- 0.5 mm Hg after bypass. Intake of beta-blockers or calcium-channel blockers, body temperature, and systolic blood pressure were not found to be related to these changes. We conclude that immediately after coronary artery bypass relaxation of left ventricular muscle is enhanced and incomplete relaxation at rapid heart rates is less likely. The most probable cause of this improvement in ventricular relaxation after coronary artery bypass grafting is relief of ischemia.\r"

In order to examine the mechanism which underlies its suppressive action, the effects of hemorrhagic serum on the production and utilization of interleukin-2 (IL-2) by PBMCs in mitogen-stimulated cultures were investigated. The production of IL-2 by PBMCs obtained from normal animals was reduced by approximately 90% after these cells were washed with hemorrhagic serum for 60 sec at 0 degrees C. Cells cultured in hemorrhagic serum showed greater than 30% reduction in proliferative response to phytohemagglutinin, and no significant change in the degree of suppression was produced by adding recombinant IL-2 to the cell cultures. PBMCs cultured with recombinant IL-2 and hemorrhagic serum, but not mitogen, proliferated significantly less than did cells cultured with IL-2 and normal serum. These findings suggest that although hemorrhagic serum produces a marked decrease in IL-2 generation, the suppressive effects of hemorrhagic serum on mitogen-induced lymphocyte proliferation are not due to this decrease in IL-2 production.\r"

  ".W": "Preoperative hemodilution (HD) is an established blood-saving method. With HD, however, a concomitant increase in extracellular and interstitial water has been reported. This randomized study was undertaken to compare the effects of acute normovolemic HD (10 ml/kg; n = 15) using hydroxyethyl starch solution (HES) on extravascular lung water (EVLW) with those of an untreated control group (n = 15) of cardiac surgery patients submitted to extracorporeal circulation (ECC). A thermal-dye technique was used to measure EVLW. There was no significant change in EVLW due to preoperative HD (5.55 +/- 0.51 vs. 5.71 +/- 0.59 ml/kg). After ECC, a transient increase in both groups could be demonstrated because of a possible change in pulmonary capillary permeability (maximal increase in the HD group: +1.30 ml/kg and in the nonHD group: +1.02 ml/kg). Five hours after ECC, no differences could be seen between the groups. Pulmonary gas exchange was not significantly affected (PaO2 in the HD group: -20 torr). Hemodynamic and laboratory variables indicated the typical changes during HD (cardiac index increases while albumin concentration decreases); circulatory stability was maintained during the entire study. We conclude that preoperative normovolemic HD did not increase lung water content significantly nor compromise pulmonary function even in cardiac surgery patients. Although ECC provides an additional HD (crystalloid priming of the heart-lung bypass machine) and possibly damage of capillary integrity, the two groups did not differ.\r"

Major independent risk factors for snoring were male gender, age between 40 and 64 years, obesity, and current cigarette smoking. Furthermore, greater intensity of cigarette smoking also was associated with higher snoring prevalence rates. Snoring prevalence remained elevated in subjects who recently quit smoking, but declined in ex-smokers to the level of never smokers within four years of smoking cessation. The presence of cough or sputum production was associated with an increase in snoring prevalence especially in ex-smokers. Snoring prevalence was slightly increased in subjects who regularly used alcohol or medications as aids to sleep. We conclude that cigarette smoking, obesity, male gender, age over 40, and use of alcohol or sleep medications are important risk factors for snoring. We propose that the effect of smoking may be related to the production of upper airway inflammation and edema by cigarette smoke, and that smoking cessation may eventually reduce snoring risk.\r"

To determine the importance of operative variables in the development of postoperative atelectasis and the incidence of phrenic nerve injury caused by topical cold cardioplegic solution, we studied 57 patients (53 male, four female) undergoing CAB. Their mean age, +/- SD, was 58 +/- 13 years. Transcutaneous stimulation was used to evaluate phrenic nerve function preoperatively and postoperatively in 52 patients. An unequivocal paresis of the phrenic nerve was documented in five patients. In an additional 27 patients, the amplitude of the compound diaphragm action potential was reduced postoperatively. However, methodologic limitations did not allow the conclusion that this was secondary to a phrenic axonal degeneration. Discriminant analysis of intraoperative variables showed more severe atelectasis with a larger number of grafts, with a longer operative and bypass time, when the pleural space was entered, when a right atrial drain and a cardiac insulating pad were not used, and with a lower body temperature. It is concluded that phrenic paresis may occur after CAB and topical cold cardioplegia, but that other factors must explain the atelectasis found in the majority of patients.\r"

The study population consisted of a random sample of 4,008 people in Marseille and 1,055 people in Briancon. All subjects received a home questionnaire, and a sample of patients and asymptomatic subjects had a skin-prick test evaluation. The cumulative prevalence of asthma was equal to 4.1 percent in Marseille and 2.4 percent in Briancon, a difference which was significant (p = 0.01). The prevalence of positive skin tests to housedust mites in asymptomatic subjects was equal to 27.5 percent in Marseille and 10.2 percent in Briancon (p less than 0.001). This study supports the hypothesis that exposure to environmental factors may have a major influence on developing allergic diseases.\r"

The screening questionnaire was translated into local vernacular. Persons who had some indication of a history of seizures or other neurologic disease were subsequently examined by a neurologic team. The diagnostic criteria of Hauser and Kurland (1975) were used to define cases of active epilepsy and seizure classification (ILAE, 1981) was done only with clinical data. One hundred fifty-seven cases of active epilepsy were detected, giving a crude prevalence rate of 2.47/1,000 general population. In those aged less than 14 years, prevalence was 3.18/1,000. Ninety-five (60.5%) of all cases were male; 91% of active epilepsy cases had onset of seizures before age 30 years. Mean age of onset in males was 5.3 years, and in females it was 7.1 years. Mean duration of seizures was 6 years; 78.9% cases had generalized seizures, 74.5% cases were receiving no specific treatment, 99.4% cases were born of home delivery, and 8.9% cases had a positive family history of seizures.

Uniform classification of epileptic seizures is especially difficult. Although the ILAE classification scheme for seizures has been available for many years, the reliability of this system has not been previously assessed. Verbatim descriptions of seizure manifestations were transcribed from medical records as part of a large, population-based prevalence study of childhood epilepsy conducted in two countries in central Oklahoma. One senior neurologist and three neurology residents reviewed these descriptions independently and classified them by seizure type based on the ILAE system. Unweighted and weighted kappa statistics were used to assess the level of agreement between the study neurologist and each resident. The overall agreement between observer pairs in classifying seizure types based on all available descriptions was relatively poor (kappa = 0.24-0.38). Some improvement was evident when unclassified seizures were excluded, and comparisons were restricted to those based on descriptions with some degree of detail (kappa = 0.34-0.51). When specific types of seizures were classified, agreement was fair to excellent for most types (kappa = 0.45-0.90), with the exceptions of atypical absence (kappa = 0.11-0.28), partial seizures with secondary generalization (kappa = 0.26-0.40), and generalized motor seizures (kappa = 0.29-0.32). Sources of observer variability in addition to the classification scheme are considered. Use of specific criteria for the categorization of symptoms might improve the reliability of seizure classification.\r"

It has been recommended for removal of diminutive polyps and treatment of vascular ectasias of the gastrointestinal tract. The extent of its use and associated complications have not been delineated. This study evaluated the practice of 517 endoscopists. Seventy-one percent (369 endoscopists) used hot biopsy forceps and reported 117 complications, including 85 episodes of bleeding, 19 perforations, and one death. While the overall complication rate was less than that previously reported for colonoscopic polypectomy, 87% of colon perforations occurred on the right side. Factors that may have been important in the development of complications included the degree and length of current application. Adherence to suggested limitations in current application and use of proper technique should result in fewer complications.\r"

Semistructured interviews using descriptive and contrast questions were done with a convenience sample of five married Anglo men. The sampling frame spanned time from 4 days to 3 years after surgery. Three informants were interviewed twice. The transcribed interviews were subjected to content analysis. With the experience of coronary artery surgery, the informants moved from health and independence to illness and dependence. Considering the transition to dependence, informants described aspects of personal control and interpersonal confidence. Considering perceptions during dependence, informants described surviving the surgery, coming to awareness, sensing physical injury, and sensing the surroundings. Understanding patients' views on the experience of CABGS can make nursing care planning and delivery more focused and deliberate. The study provides a preliminary basis for continued research toward a conceptual model of CABGS patients' experiences.\r"

The mean amniotic fluid levels in the control pregnancies were 0.28 nmol/L for 21-DOF and 4.1 nmol/L for 17-OHP. The levels were similar in early and midpregnancy for 21-DOF (0.29 vs. 0.27 nmol/L) and 17-OHP (3.4 vs. 4.2 nmol/L). The amniotic fluid 21-DOF level was 1.75 nmol/L in affected pregnancies, significantly higher than in the control pregnancies (mean, 0.28 nmol/L). The mean amniotic fluid 17-OHP level in the affected pregnancies (30.5 nmol/L) also was significantly higher than that in the control pregnancies (4.10 nmol/L). Simultaneous measurement of 21-DOF and 17-OHP levels in amniotic fluid from 10-18 weeks of gestation can be used for early diagnosis of congenital adrenal hyperplasia.\r"

The substance was capable of binding to EGF receptors in mouse parenchymal cells and this binding was inhibited by anti-EGF serum. The concentration of the EGF-like substance in the tears of male and female mice was estimated to be 79.3 +/- 7.0 (SD) ng/ml and 76.5 +/- 8.1 (SD) ng/ml, respectively, by EGF radioimmunoassay. Removal of the submandibular glands, which produce large amounts of EGF, reduced plasma EGF to an undetectable level and also decreased the concentration of the EGF-like substance in tears to 27.3 +/- 3.9 (SD) ng/ml in male mice and 25.8 +/- 3.7 (SD) ng/ml in female mice. Approximately 50% of sialoadenectomized (submandibular glands removed) male mice with deep corneal wounds developed severe ocular lesions or loss of sight whereas none of normal male mice with similar wounds did. Topical application of EGF to deeply wounded eyes of sialoadenectomized mice eliminated the various complications and restored the healing rate and incidence of recovery to virtually normal levels.\r"

In the present study we demonstrate the localization of both genetic markers within the vWF gene. The RFLPs were used to study the segregation of alleles associated with von Willebrand's disease (vWD) type IIA in a comprehensive, affected family. Individuals of this family were tested for their bleeding time and their plasma was analyzed for vWF antigen concentration and vWF ristocetin-cofactor activity. Based on these data, the affected members were diagnosed as vWD type-IIA patients; this conclusion was confirmed by the analysis of the multimeric vWF pattern of some of the patients. It was demonstrated that both RFLPs are completely linked with the vWD type-IIA trait. From this finding, we conclude that the defect that causes the vWD type IIA is most likely due to a mutation in the vWF gene and not to a mutation in a gene involved in posttranslational processing of the vWF protein.\r"

  ".W": "In addition to activating T and B lymphocytes, interleukin 1 (IL-1) induces several hematologic and metabolic changes typical of host responses to infection and injury. We now report a new biological property, namely, the induction of hypotension. Rabbits given a single intravenous injection of recombinant human IL-1-beta (5 micrograms/kg) rapidly developed decreased systemic arterial pressure, which reached the lowest levels after 50-60 min and slowly returned to pre-IL-1 values after 3 h. Associated with the hypotension, systemic vascular resistance and central venous pressure fell, while cardiac output and heart rate increased. These responses were prevented by ibuprofen given 15 min before the IL-1. A bolus injection of IL-1 followed by a 2-h infusion sustained the hypotension and was associated with leukopenia and thrombocytopenia. Ibuprofen given at the mid-point of the infusion reversed the changes in all hemodynamic parameters, but had no effect on the leukopenia or thrombocytopenia. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) also induced a shock-like state in rabbits. When the dose of IL-1 or TNF was reduced to 1 microgram/kg, no hemodynamic changes were observed; however, the combination of these low doses of both cytokines resulted in a profound shock-like state including histological evidence of severe pulmonary edema and hemorrhage. Pretreatment with ibuprofen prevented the hemodynamic, leukocyte, and platelet changes induced by the low-dose cytokine combination, and ameliorated the pulmonary tissue damage. These results demonstrate that IL-1, like TNF, possesses the ability to induce hemodynamic and hematological changes typical of septic shock, and that the combination of IL-1 and TNF is more potent than either agent alone. These effects seem to require cyclooxygenase products, and suggest that intravenous cyclooxygenase inhibitors may be of therapeutic value in patients with IL-1/TNF-mediated shock.\r"

It is suggested that the ability of the polyclonal anti-CD3 antisera to detect T cells in paraffin sections is due to the presence in these sera of antibodies against fixation resistant epitopes on CD3 antigen, and that immunisation with purified denatured preparations of other white cell associated antigens may broaden the range of antibodies suitable for the phenotypic analysis of leucocytes in routine histological samples.\r"

Serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) concentration was also normal in all except these two patients. Serum osteocalcin concentration was below normal in seven of 14 patients. Although a low concentration of serum 25 OHD is common in patients with anorexia nervosa in the United Kingdom, 1,25(OH)2D concentrations are usually normal. Hypovitaminosis D with secondary hyperparathyroidism is relatively uncommon. The subnormal osteocalcin concentrations observed in these patients probably reflect diminished osteoblastic activity, which may contribute to their osteopenia.\r"

One hundred forty-four consecutive patients were operated on through February 1986, all of whom required endarterectomy and reconstruction of the left anterior descending, left circumflex and right coronary arteries. There were 130 men (90%), ranging in age from 29 to 83 years (average 55.8), whose left ventricular ejection fraction ranged from 0.20 to 0.75 (average 0.54). One hundred thirty-one patients (91%) had angina preoperatively, which was Canadian Cardiovascular Society class III or IV in 85 (59%). Fifteen operations (10%) were repeat procedures. All operations were performed using intermittent ischemic arrest. There was an average of 5.0 grafts per patient (range 3 to 8), with an average of 3.8 endarterectomized vessels per patient (range 3 to 7). There were 14 surgical deaths (10%), all cardiac in origin. Statistically significant (p less than 0.01) risk factors for increased operative mortality included repeat surgery, ejection fraction less than or equal to 0.30 and age greater than or equal to 70 years. The operative mortality rate in 106 low risk patients (male gender, age less than 70 years, ejection fraction greater than 0.30, first operation) was 3.8% (4 patients). Nonfatal complications included 13 perioperative myocardial infarctions (10%). Long-term follow-up data are available for all 102 surviving patients for an average of 30 months (range 7 to 92). There were 12 late deaths 1 to 52 months postoperatively. The 5 year actuarial survival rate is 71% for the entire group and 87% for the 106 low risk patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

It is demonstrated that high affinity IL-2R can be readily induced by either anti-CD3 and/or anti-CD2 stimulation. However, IL-2 production can be observed only in the CD4+CD8- T cell subset. These results clearly contrast data obtained with purified CD4-CD8+ T cells, which are able to proliferate when the CD3-Ti complex is activated in the presence of APC. The data presented in the present study demonstrate that a simplified model for T cell activation and clonal expansion of the two major T cell subsets involve only the CD3-Ti complex and the CD2 Ag. Under conditions where the activation signals for the T cells are restricted only to the activation of CD3-Ti and CD2, the CD4+CD8- T cells respond with IL-2 production and expression of high affinity IL-2R, whereas the CD4-CD8+ T cell subset depends on exogenous IL-2 provided by the CD4+CD8- cells. These data do not, however, exclude an involvement of other cell-surface signals for regulation and control of T cell activation and T cell effector functions.\r"

The CT8 antibody precipitated a molecule of Mr 63,000 under non-reducing conditions and polypeptide chains of Mr 34,000 under reducing conditions, suggesting that the CT8 molecule is a disulfide-linked homodimer. Tissue distribution studies by immunofluorescence revealed that the CT4 and CT8 Ag were expressed by the majority of thymocytes and by subpopulations of CT3+ cells in peripheral tissues. The CT4 reactive molecule was found on approximately 70% of thymocytes, 10% splenocytes, and 45% of lymphoid cells in blood. The CT8 reactive molecule was expressed on approximately 80% of thymocytes, 50% of spleen cells, and 15% of blood lymphocytes. Two-color immunofluorescence indicated that the CT4 and CT8 Ag were expressed together on most thymocytes and on mutually exclusive subsets of cells in the spleen and blood. Ontogenic studies revealed a sharp increase in the frequencies of CT4+ and CT8+ cells in the thymus between days 13 and 16 embryonic life. Both CT4 and CT8 antibodies inhibited PHA- and Con A-induced proliferative responses of splenocytes, and the degree of inhibition correlated with the frequencies of CT4+ and CT8+ lymphoblasts. Treatment of spleen cells with CT4 antibody and inhibited PWM-induced IL-2 production, and removal of CT8+ cells inhibited the cytolytic activity induced by allogeneic lymphocyte stimulation. Macrophages did not express detectable CT4 reactivity. These results suggest that the CD4 and CD8 molecules and their tissue-restricted patterns of expression are highly conserved in birds and mammals.\r"

Flow cytometry was utilized to study the expression of the Fc epsilon R on splenic B cells from mice of increasing age, as well as B cells from various lymphoid organs. A large panel of B cell tumors was also screened for the presence of the Fc epsilon R. The results demonstrate that the Fc epsilon R appears very late in B cell development, and is preceded in appearance even by IgD. In adult animals, the Fc epsilon R was found to be expressed on virtually all mature IgM, IgD bearing B cells, whether taken from the spleen, lymph nodes, or Peyer's patches. Further examination showed that B cells which had switched to express an isotype other than IgD, appeared to no longer display the Fc epsilon R. When surveying a variety of B cell tumors, the Fc epsilon R was found to be present on WEHI 279, an IgM, IgD-bearing lymphoma. The receptor was not found on pre-B cell, immature B cell, switched B cell, or secreting B cell tumors. Taken together, these results indicate that the B cell Fc epsilon R is expressed predominantly on mature, virgin B cells, and is lost after activation and switching.\r"

The initial studies demonstrated that cross-linking class I MHC molecules either by culturing highly purified T4 cells with immobilized mAb to class I MHC Ag or reacting the T4 cells with mAb to class I MHC Ag and then cross-linking the mAb with goat antimouse Ig (GaMIg) enhanced T4 cell proliferation induced by an immobilized mAb to CD3, OKT3. More-over, immobilized but not soluble mAb to class I MHC Ag enhanced T4 cell proliferation induced by the combination of two mAb to CD2, OKT11, and D66.2. Finally, T4 cells reacted with mAb to CD3 and class I MHC Ag proliferated in the presence of IL-2 when cross-linked with GaMIg more vigorously than T4 cells reacted with either mAb alone. Cross-linking class I MHC molecules was also found to stimulate T4 cells directly. T4 cells reacted with mAb to class I MHC Ag or beta 2 microglobulin and cross-linked with GaMIg proliferated vigorously in the presence of IL-2 or PMA. In addition, it was demonstrated that cross-linking class I MHC molecules by culturing T4 cells with immobilized mAb to class I MHC Ag induced T4 cell proliferation in the presence of IL-2. T4 cell proliferation in the presence of IL-2 and PMA could also be induced by reacting the cells with specific mAb to polymorphic determinants on class I MHC molecules and cross-linking with GaMIg. Cross-linking mAb to CD4 or CD11a did not have a similar functional effect on T4 cells. Finally it was demonstrated that adding GaMIg to T4 cells reacted with mAb to class I MHC Ag but not CD11a resulted in an increase in intracellular calcium concentration. The data demonstrate that cross-linking class I MHC molecules results in the generation of at least one activation signal, a rise in intracellular calcium concentration, and, thereby, stimulates human T4 cells.\r"

  ".W": "The Muller cell is the major glial element of the mammalian retina. It can be induced to express MHC class II determinants in culture, when exposed to supernatant from activated lymphocytes. In an in vitro co-culture system, Muller cells had been shown to exert a profound inhibitory influence on Ag- and IL-2-driven proliferation of Th cell lines. In the present report we demonstrate that Muller cells can produce IL-1 activity, and that in conditions where their inhibitory action is suppressed, they display the capacity to efficiently function as APC. Mildly trypsinized and glutaraldehyde-fixed Muller cells that had been preincubated with Ag and IFN-gamma-containing rat spleen conditioned medium were able to present Ag to an S-Ag specific Th lymphocyte line, which has the capacity to induce a severe uveoretinitis in rats. Addition of the Ag after fixation did not result in presentation, showing that Muller cells had to process the nominal Ag into an immunogenic form. It was also found that the efficiency of presentation was greatly increased in the presence of naive syngeneic or allogeneic accessory cells. This enhancing effect could not be reproduced with rIL-1. This report extends our ongoing study of interactions between the retinal glial Muller cell and T lymphocytes. The results show that these interactions can be diverse, even opposite in different conditions, and suggest the possibility that Muller cells could play a determining role in the course of immune reactions at the level of the neuro-retina.\r"

We have previously reported that cloned T cells treated with 5-azacytidine lose the requirement for Ag and can be activated by autologous HLA-D molecules alone, thus becoming auto-reactive. This phenomenon could potentially mediate an autoimmune disease in vivo. Inasmuch as several drugs are known to cause autoimmune disease, we asked whether they exert the same effects on T cells as 5-azacytidine. We report that hydralazine and procainamide, two drugs associated with a lupus-like autoimmune disease, also inhibit DNA methylation and induce self-reactivity in cloned T cell lines. These results suggest that drug-induced autoimmune disease may be due to activation of as yet unidentified genes through mechanisms involving DNA methylation.\r"

  ".W": "The (NZB x SWR)F1 hybrid mice (SNF1) uniformly develop lethal glomerulonephritis in marked contrast to their parents and produce nephritogenic autoantibodies that consist of highly cationic, IgG anti-DNA antibodies that share distinct cross-reactive idiotypes called IdLNF1 (idiotypes-lupus nephritis-SNF1). Herein we found that spleen cells of SNF1 mice at the late prenephritic stage, contained CD4+/CD8- and CD4-/CD8- Th that not only induced their B cells in vitro to produce highly cationic IgG autoantibodies to DNA but IdLNF1-positive IgG antibodies as well. The double-negative Th were unexpected in the SNF1 mice because they lack the lpr (lymphoproliferation) gene. We also derived IL-2-dependent CD4+/CD8- as well as CD4-/CD8- T cell lines from nephritic SNF1 mice, that could simultaneously induce IdLNF1-positive and cationic anti-DNA antibodies of IgG class. The CD4+ T cell lines consisted of \"autoreactive\" T cells, but not all of the lines were equal in autoantibody-inducing capability. Remarkably, the T cell lines that preferentially responded to F1-hybrid-MHC determinants, had a significantly greater ability to augment the production of pathogenic autoantibodies. The SNF1-Th could also augment autoantibody production by the NZB or SWR parent's B cells; however, IdLNF1-positive and cationic anti-DNA autoantibodies of IgG class were not induced, suggesting that the SNF1 mice possess a select population of inducible (susceptible) B cells that are committed to produce nephritogenic autoantibodies and the parental strains are deficient in such B cells. Thus, production of nephritogenic autoantibodies with IdLNF1 markers in the SNF1 mice could result from an interaction between a select population of B cells and CD4+ Th that preferentially recognize unique F1-hybrid-MHC determinants, as well as double-negative auxiliary Th.\r"

To assess the response to all Ag, an immunoblot technique was used, and strips were sequentially probed with patient sera, monoclonal anti-subclass sera, and a labeled anti-mouse reagent. The relative proportions of each subclass reactive with a specific Ag was determined semi-quantitatively by densitometric scanning. Overall, all of the IgG subclasses were involved in the autoantibody response, although the frequency of detection was highest for IgG1 and lowest for IgG4. When the subclass responses to different Ag were compared, IgG1 was the major subclass reactive with the Ro, La, and U1 ribonucleoprotein Ag, whereas IgG1 and IgG2 were almost equally represented in the responses to the Sm BB' and D Ag as well as to the ribosomal P proteins. Individual patient sera frequently showed discordance between the dominant subclass reactive against apparently unrelated proteins and even against proteins within the same antigenic particle (e.g., the Sm BB' and D proteins). These observations indicate that there are two major patterns of subclass response to the common lupus autoantigens but that considerable variation between patients and even within the same patient (to different Ag) occurs.\r"

Activated CD8+ lymphocytes are present in increased numbers in the paracortex of lymph nodes of SIV-infected rhesus monkeys with a lymphadenopathy syndrome. We demonstrate that SIV is more readily isolated from CD8+ lymphocyte-depleted PBL of SIV-infected animals than from their unfractionated PBL. Rather than reflecting the fact that the CD8+ lymphocyte-depleted cell populations are simply enriched for CD4+ lymphocytes, this indicates that CD8+ cells themselves are critical in this regulatory interaction. In fact, CD8+ lymphocytes from SIV-infected but not uninfected rhesus monkeys can block SIV replication in vitro in PBL populations. A T lymphocyte population that blocks replication of viruses of the HIV family may contribute to containing the progression of AIDS.\r"

Human Jurkat cells show a rapid increase of IL-2 mRNA on induction of IL-2 synthesis, followed by an equally rapid decline 4 to 6 h later. The decline occurs despite a high rate of synthesis, and appears to be due to an enhanced rate of IL-2 mRNA degradation. The degradation of IL-2 mRNA is selectively sensitive to cycloheximide and actinomycin D, inhibitors of protein and RNA synthesis, respectively. IL-2 mRNA levels in mouse EL4.E1 T lymphoma cells, and in activated human PBL, decline rapidly on removal of the inducing agents, indicating that transcription continues only as long as the activating signal is present. The transience of IL-2 mRNA is seen as an important property of a transiently acting immunoregulatory factor.\r"

The SAP response to all three rIL-1 proteins reached a maximum at a dose of 10(4) U/mouse, which corresponds to 1 to 10 micrograms of protein. The maximum in vivo response consisted of a 10-fold increase in SAP levels, a 2-fold increase in C3 levels, and a 3-fold increase in fibrinogen concentration. By contrast, rTNF-alpha induced a much smaller acute phase (AP) protein response (4-fold increase in SAP) when administered in vivo. Administration of a combination if rIL-1 and rTNF resulted in an AP response that was additive for SAP, synergistic for fibrinogen, but resulted in only the same amount of C3 induced by IL-1 alone. Both recombinant monokines induced new SAP synthesis by isolated hepatocytes in vitro with an optimal response occurring with either 1 U of rIL-1/ml per 2 x 10(5) hepatocytes or 10(-3) U/ml of rTNF. The hepatocyte response to IL-1 was of the same magnitude as the response of intact mice; however, the response to TNF was approximately 10(4) times more efficient in vitro. A mixture of the monokines induced an in vitro SAP response that was additive when suboptimal doses of rIL-1 were combined with optimal amounts of rTNF-alpha. Overall, the findings indicate that both monokines directly trigger hepatocyte synthesis of SAP and that their combined effect probably accounts for a substantial portion of the synthesis of these AP proteins in mice.\r"

This transcriptional difference is also reflected at the level of intracellular IL-1 beta protein production. In contrast to LPS, a phorbol ester (PMA) induces a stable, non-transient population of mRNA. Furthermore, each induction pathway is operational under conditions where the other is inhibited, suggesting functional independence. Evidence is presented for post-transcriptional regulation of the two responses in THP-1 cells at the level of mRNA stability. We also demonstrate a similar dualistic response in primary monocyte-derived human macrophages as well as the human myelocytic cell line HL-60.\r"

  ".U": "88170806\r", 
  ".W": "Murine and human keratinocytes produce an IL-1-like factor that appears to be similar if not identical to monocyte-derived IL-1. IL-1 may be an important mediator in cutaneous inflammatory responses, however, little is currently known concerning factors that may modulate IL-1 expression in keratinocytes. To address this issue we examined the effect of LPS, UV, and the cell differentiation state on murine keratinocyte IL-1 mRNA expression. Our results indicated that as with the murine P388D1 monocyte cell line, PAM 212 keratinocytes constitutively express abundant amounts of IL-1 alpha mRNA. On exposure to LPS (100 micrograms/ml) for 8 h there was more than 10 times the increase in PAM 212 IL-1 alpha mRNA which was accompanied by a sixfold increase in supernatant IL-1 activity. Similarly UV irradiation had a significant effect on keratinocyte IL-1 alpha expression. High dose UV (300 mJ/cm2) inhibited PAM 212 IL-1 alpha expression at 4, 8, 24, 48 h post-UV whereas a lower dose of UV (100 mJ/cm2) inhibited UV at 4 and 8 h post-UV, but induced IL-1 expression at 24 and 48 h post-UV. The expression of IL-1 alpha varied with the differentiation state of the keratinocytes. Freshly removed newborn murine keratinocytes were found to constitutively express IL-1 alpha mRNA. Keratinocytes grown in low [Ca2+] tissue culture media (0.05 mM) for 6 days, functionally and phenotypically become undifferentiated and express increased quantities of IL-1 alpha mRNA, whereas cells grown in high [Ca2+] media (1.2 mM) for 6 days become terminally differentiated and IL-1 expression ceased. Keratinocytes cultured for 3 days in low [Ca2+] conditions expressed an intermediate level of IL-1 alpha. In contrast, little or no IL-1 beta mRNA was detected in either the PAM 212 cells or newborn murine keratinocytes. Thus LPS, UV, and cell differentiation state have a significant effect on expression of IL-1 alpha in murine keratinocytes.\r"

  ".W": "The human IL-1 molecules (IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta) are post-translationally cleaved from 31-kDa precursor to 18-kDa biologically active molecules. During the course of studies of post-translational modifications of human IL-1, we have observed that although LPS induced the production of both intracellular IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta in human monocytes, [32P]orthophosphate labeling of these cells revealed that intracellular precursor of IL-1 alpha (pre-IL-1 alpha) to be phosphorylated at least 10-fold more than intracellular pre-IL-1 beta. However, no 32P-incorporation could be detected in the 18-kDa processed IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta. Analysis by TLC revealed that the major phosphorylation site occurred at serine residue(s). The 32P was incorporated into multiply cleaved precursors of IL-1 alpha, which appeared in the absence of protease inhibitors. Since the smallest Mr pre-IL-1 alpha that was labeled with 32P was 22 kDa, the phosphorylated serine residue is presumably located adjacent to a sequence of four basic amino acids located in the 4-kDa region at the amino terminus of the 22-kDa precursor of IL-1 alpha. This serine residue might also be a major phosphorylation site for a cAMP-dependent protein kinase. This hypothesis was substantiated by the demonstration that a synthetic peptide analogue of this region (residue 84 to 112) could be similarly phosphorylated in vitro by a cAMP-dependent protein kinase. Furthermore, a truncated pre-IL-1 alpha (residue 64 to 271) and a \"fusion\" protein containing staphylococcal protein A and an amino-terminal half-portion of pre-IL-1 alpha (residue 1 to 112), but not mature IL-1 alpha (residue 113 to 271), could also be phosphorylated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase. There is no comparable amino acid sequence in IL-1 beta which could be expected to be phosphorylated by a cAMP-dependent protein kinase. The physiologic relevance of phosphorylation of pre-IL-1 alpha was investigated. The data showed that phosphorylation of truncated pre-IL-1 alpha greatly enhanced its susceptibility to digestion by trypsin and promoted the conversion of pre-IL-1 alpha to the more biologically active IL-1. Although the precise role of the rather selective phosphorylation of pre-IL-1 alpha is not known, our findings do suggest that the phosphorylation of serine close to dibasic/tetrabasic amino acid sequence functions to facilitate the processing and/or release of IL-1 alpha.\r"

The B6.4 mAb was generated by immunizing mice with B cell growth factor (BCGF)-responding BA3 cells, and selected by its capability to block BCGF-induced proliferation of BA3 cells. The inhibitory effect of this antibody on BCGF-dependent proliferation was further confirmed by using normal activated B cells in the presence of exogenous BCGF derived from T cells or B cells. Furthermore, it did not affect IL-2-dependent proliferation of B cells. The expression of the B6.4 Ag, as analyzed by FACS, is restricted to in vitro activated B cells, and remains undetectable on resting B or T cells, PHA-activated T cells, and monocytes. The B6.4 Ag is also expressed on some lymphoblastoid B cell lines and most of the lymphomas and CLL of B cell origin; however, it did not express on pre-B cell ALL and plasma cell leukemias. The B6.4 Ag has a Mr of 35,000 Da, as determined by SDS-PAGE of radiolabeled immunoprecipitates from activated B cells. The B6.4 Ag is detectable on B cells as early as 8 h after activation, and precedes that of the IL-2R or transferrin R. All of these results suggest that the B6.4 Ag is an early activation Ag of B cells and is functionally related to a receptor of BCGF, but not IL-2.\r"

The superoxide producing system of EBV-BLCL (B cell oxidase) was compared with the phagocytic NADPH-oxidase and the relationship of the capacity to produce superoxide to the presence of the EBV-genome was analyzed. The two EBV-transformed B cell lines F1 and HELL generated superoxide in response to PMA (2.3 nmol/10(6) F1 cells x 1 h and 6.27 nmol/10(6) HELL cells x 1 h with 1 microgram/ml of PMA), whereas no superoxide release was detected with the EBV-positive Burkitt lymphoma line WIL-2 and the EBV-negative plasmocytoma line U-266. Also, F1 and HELL showed lucigenin-dependent chemiluminescence (CL) after PMA-treatment, whereas no CL responses were detected from WIL-2 or U-266. Further, F1 and HELL cells contained a low potential cytochrome b-245 (10.9 and 61.0 pmol/mg protein, respectively) and also a 45 kDa diphenylene-iodonium (DPI)-binding peptide, both components of the phagocytic NADPH-oxidase. In contrast, neither the cytochrome b-245 nor the 45 kDa DPI-binding peptide were detected in WIL-2 and U-266. In addition, DPI inhibited O2- production by PMA-stimulated EBV-BLCL and polymorphonuclear granulocytes. Further, F1 line cells showed superoxide dismutase-inhibitable lucigenin-dependent CL when triggered by protein A-bearing staphylococci (Cowan strain I) or by a mAb directed against human IgG in the presence of solid-phase goat anti-mouse-Ig antibody. From a panel of eight EBV-BLCL, only five responded with CL when exposed to protein A-bearing staphylococci, whereas all showed CL when treated with phorbol ester. Inasmuch as all eight EBV-BLCL possessed surface Ig and a \"functional\" oxidase, their differential response to cross-linking of surface Ig may be determined by differences in signal transduction. Superoxide production by EBV-BLCL appears thus related to expression of an electron transport chain structurally homologous, if not identical, with the \"phagocytic\" NADPH-oxidase. Apparently, the presence of EBV-genome in B cell lines does not per se lead to expression of this oxidase. This suggests that nontransformed B cells may, at a certain differentiation stage, also express a superoxide-generating chain. From the finding of stimulation of superoxide production of EBV-BLCL via surface Ig it appears possible that also Ag may be able to trigger such B cells to production of superoxide which might have an important role in the physiology of B cells.\r"

  ".W": "Multiple signals are involved in the regulation of Ig production by human B lymphocytes. Leukotrienes, especially LTB4, have been shown to inhibit Ig production by increasing the number and function of suppressor lymphocytes. Production of leukotrienes has been demonstrated by mast cells, basophils, eosinophils, polymorphonuclear leukocytes, monocytes, and macrophages. In this paper we demonstrate that a human T-T hybridoma grown at 5 x 10(5) cells/ml constitutively produces 5 ng/ml of LTC4. Furthermore, we demonstrate that either the supernatant from this hybridoma containing 0.5 to 10 ng/ml LTC4 or purified LTC4 in the range of 0.5 to 5 ng/ml can suppress 50 to 70% of Ig production by unfractionated human mononuclear cells, by normal human cells stimulated with Staphylococcus aureus Cowan I and B cell differentiation factors, and by the EBV-transformed B cell line SKW.6 in the presence of B cell differentiation factors. Thus, LTC4 can have direct effects on B cells and may have a role in normal B cell regulation.\r"

  ".U": "88170828\r", 
  ".W": "HLA-A2 and -A3 genes have been modified in their third exon (second domain) by using in vivo recombination. In this method Escherichia coli are transfected with a plasmid which contains two highly homologous sequences (e.g., the third exons of HLA-A2 and -A3) and has been linearized by cleavage between these two sequences. Circularization takes place in the bacteria by homologous recombination leading to hybrid A2-A3 sequences. The analysis by DNA sequencing of a number of such recombinants shows that they indeed occur by homologous recombination (no insertions or deletions) and that the probability of crossing over decreases as the distance from the free end of DNA in the homologous region increases. No double recombinants were observed. These hybrid exons were reinserted into either HLA-A2 or HLA-A3 genes, thus generating a panel of functional hybrid genes containing one or several HLA-A2 specific substitutions in an HLA-A3 background or vice versa. These genes were expressed by transfection into murine P815-high transfection efficiency recipient cells. Serologic analysis leads to the conclusion that expression of polymorphic antigenic determinants specific for HLA-A2 (detected with M58, A2A28M1, and CR11.351 mAb) is linked to the presence of threonine residue (amino acid (AA) 142) and/or histidine residue (AA 145) and valine residue (AA 152). The expression of specific HLA-A3 polymorphic determinants (recognized by GAP-A3 mAb) is correlated with the existence of a asparagine residue (AA 127) and a aspartic residue (AA 161). But aspartic residue 161 contributes with glutamic acid residue 152 in the formation of the A3 epitope recognized by the anti-A3 mAb X1.23.2.\r"

  ".U": "88170833\r", 
  ".W": "We have previously established an in vitro sensitization (IVS) procedure with which lymphocytes from tumor-bearing mice could be expanded and sensitized to acquire antitumor reactivity capable of mediating the regression of established pulmonary metastases from the weakly immunogenic MCA 105 murine sarcoma. Culture conditions required for the optimal generation of therapeutic effector cells were evaluated in the current study. Generation of effector cells by IVS required stimulation by intact tumor cells. Tumor cells killed by heat or disrupted by sonication were ineffective, but the antigenicity of tumor cells was not affected by gamma-irradiation. Long term established tumor cell lines could also serve as antigenic stimulator cells albeit with lower efficiency than fresh tumor cells. IL-2 was essential for cellular proliferation during IVS. The concentration of 1000 U/ml of IL-2 also induced nonspecific lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) activity. However, cytotoxic cells were generated during IVS in response to a broad range of IL-2 concentrations. At low IL-2 concentrations (2 to 10 U/ml), IVS cells were generated which displayed little or no LAK activity, had a greater therapeutic efficacy than those generated with high concentrations of IL-2 (100 to 1000 U/ml). Despite having high LAK activity, IVS cells, from cultures where IL-2 was added 3 or more days after initiation, had no therapeutic effect. Thus, the generation of therapeutic cells occurred independently of LAK cell production. Adoptive immunotherapy with IVS cells from MCA 105 tumor-bearing mice demonstrated cross-reactivity with the immunologically distinct MCA 106 but not the nonimmunogenic MCA 102 tumor. In contrast, IVS cells from MCA 106 tumor-bearing mice exhibited specific in vivo reactivity. In vitro cytotoxicity analyses revealed that IVS cells from MCA 105 and MCA 106 tumor-bearing mice were able to lyse both MCA 105 and MCA 106 target cells, but the reactivity toward inoculating tumors was highest. Considering previous findings that the MCA 105 and MCA 106 sarcomas possessed distinct tumor-specific transplantation Ag, the cross-reactivity observed in this study suggests that the immune response during progressive tumor growth may be different from that elicited in response to active immunization.\r"

In vitro transformation of bone marrow target cells by this B lymphotropic retrovirus was inhibited by peripheral lymph node cells from naive mice. The inhibitory activity depended on Thy-1+ L3T4+ cells but did not require Lyt-2+ cells. In vivo depletion of L3T4+ T cells with a mAb (GK1.5) altered the course of AMuLV-induced lymphoma. L3T4 depletion of naturally resistant C57BL/6 mice resulted in dramatic susceptibility to lymphoma induction. Lymphoma cells from anti-L3T4-treated C57BL/6 mice infected with AMuLV displayed the B lineage transformation marker P1606C3. These studies reveal an important immunologic component of Abelson disease resistance involving L3T4+ T cells.\r"

OKT3 (mAb to the CD3 surface Ag of human T lymphocytes) was conjugated to DT or the DT mutant CRM 1001, which has a cys----tyr substitution at position 471 of the B chain. OKT3-CRM 1001 immunotoxin was about 1400-fold less cytotoxic for CD3 Jurkat cells than OKT3-DT and had a 12-fold slower kinetics of protein synthesis inactivation, CRM 1001 killed DT-sensitive Vero cells at a 5000-fold higher concentration than DT. Its cell surface-binding activity was comparable to DT. Based on kinetics of cell inactivation, toxicity determination at low extracellular pH and Triton X-114 distribution, it was concluded that CRM 1001 is defective in at least one crucial step of toxin penetration and is unable to cross cell membranes as efficiently as DT. The substituted cysteine appears to be important for DT translocating functions. Data on the function of DT B-chain subdomains are relevant for the study of whole toxin conjugates and their mechanism of action.\r"

  ".W": "The immunologic platelet profile of 29 patients with hemophilia who had received multiple transfusions (14 had thrombocytopenia) was compared with profiles of 15 patients with classic autoimmune thrombocytopenia. Thrombocytopenic hemophiliacs who were seropositive for the human immunodeficiency virus (13 out of 14) had platelet-bound immunoglobulin G and C3C4 levels as well as circulating immune complexes that were 15.1-, 4.0-, and 2.4-fold greater, respectively, than normal control subjects' platelets and 3.4-, 2.6-, and 2.4-fold greater, respectively, than autoimmune thrombocytopenic patients' platelets. Hemophiliacs with normal platelet counts (nine out of 13 seropositive) had elevated values that were intermediate in level between those of thrombocytopenic hemophiliacs and those of classic autoimmune thrombocytopenic patients. The four seronegative hemophiliacs had normal values (except for one platelet-bound IgG measurement). An inverse correlation was noted between platelet count and platelet-bound IgG, r = -0.838, P less than 0.001. Serum antiplatelet reactivity (1:256 mean titer compared with control sera) resided predominantly in the 7S IgG fraction, and bound to autologous as well as homologous platelets at concentrations as low as 0.06 to 0.13 mg/ml. F(ab')2 fragments of the 7S IgG fraction inhibited binding of hemophilic IgG to normal platelets and bound to normal platelets at concentrations as low as 0.06 mg/ml. Antiplatelet IgG could be eluted from six of six hemophilic and eight of eight classic autoimmune thrombocytopenic patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Resolution of conflicting tasks was severely impaired, suggesting frontal lobe dysfunction. These abnormalities correlated with the finding on SPECT of a marked hypoperfusion in the overlying hemisphere predominating in the frontal region.

(b) As an alternative means of identifying cases, is it adequate to review patient records from hospitals and clinics serving the population to be surveyed? (c) Should population members residing in institutions of long-term care be made ineligible for the anticipated survey? Data on major neurologic disorders, obtained from the Copiah County Study, are used to suggest caution in answering any of these questions in the affirmative, since in particular circumstances the consequences for the intended research may be serious or even disastrous. For example, with 42% of Parkinson's disease cases diagnosed for the first time during the study, a casefinding approach solely through medical-care providers would have been highly questionable for that disorder.\r"

This schedule was repeated at least twice more at 1-week intervals. Six of 24 patients (25%) who received more than one 2-week cycle of treatment had a remission, one complete and five partial, with minor responses in eight others (33.3%). Three patients with rapidly progressive disease, who received only one cycle, were excluded from the analysis of response. The responses comprised remissions of liver metastases in two patients, one of them complete, two complete and two partial regressions of subcutaneous metastases, partial remission of lymph node metastases, and a partial remission of lung nodules. The mean duration of response exceeded 5 months, with two patients treated for greater than 1 year. Toxicity was moderate and controllable and only two patients required hospitalization, both overnight. Lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cell activation was induced in 17 of the 24 patients, including all six responders, while none of seven patients without LAK activation had a remission. This regimen appeared to be as effective in melanoma as those involving ex vivo activation of LAK cells, and was generally tolerable to patients in all age groups.\r"

They comprised 5.0% of a larger series of 699 patients with TN who underwent MVD during that interval. Compared to the subgroup of 664 patients with only unilateral symptoms, the population with bilateral TN included a greater percentage of females (74% vs. 58%, p less than 0.1), a higher rate of \"familial\" TN (17% vs. 4.1%, p less than 0.001), and an increased incidence of additional cranial nerve dysfunction (17% vs. 6.6%, p less than 0.05) and hypertension (34% vs. 19%, p less than 0.05). Of the 35 patients with bilateral TN, 10 underwent bilateral MVD (22 procedures) and 25 underwent unilateral MVD (30 procedures). In the latter patients, pain on the nonoperative side was well controlled with medication alone or had previously been treated by ablative procedures. Good or excellent pain control was achieved after one MVD was performed in 40 of the 45 sides treated (89%), and was maintained 1, 5, and 10 years after surgery in 82%, 66%, and 60%, respectively, based on life-table analysis. Six of 10 patients with recurrent symptoms underwent repeat unilateral MVD. Good or excellent long-term pain control was maintained in all six. With these repeat procedures included, symptom control at 1, 5, and 10 years after initial surgery was maintained in 87%, 78%, and 78% of the treated sides, respectively. Overall, 26 of 35 patients (74%) maintained good or excellent pain relief throughout the duration of the study (mean follow-up period 75 months) without resumption of regular medication usage. Although preoperative neurological deficits resulting from previous ablative procedures were seen in the majority of patients before MVD, no patient developed new major trigeminal sensory loss or masseter weakness after MVD. Operative mortality was zero. The results indicate that posterior fossa MVD is an effective and relatively safe treatment for the majority of patients with bilateral \"idiopathic\" TN, avoiding the risks of bilateral trigeminal nerve injury seen with other approaches.\r"

The findings were compared with those obtained from 21 normal healthy control subjects. The analysis revealed a significant decrease both in the absolute numbers and in the percentages of circulating CD3+ (p less than 0.001) and CD4+ (p less than 0.001) cells, while the CD8+ and Pan B+ cells remained within the normal range irrespective of the type and grade of tumor. The CD4+:CD8+ ratio was significantly decreased in all categories of patients. The CD4 lymphopenia was also evident in 10 patients who had no history of previous immunosuppressive drug therapy (steroids and anticonvulsants) until the commencement of the study. The Ig levels were within the normal range in patients with malignant astrocytoma and glioblastoma multiforme, whereas a three- and fourfold increase in the IgM level was observed in patients with astrocytoma. It is suggested that T cell lymphopenia in glioma patients could mainly be due to a selective depletion of CD4+ cells and that it occurs principally as a reaction to the tumor.\r"

  ".W": "We describe a technique for correction of artifacts in exercise 201Tl single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) images arising from abrupt or gradual translational movement of the heart during acquisition. The procedure involves the tracking of the \"center of the heart\" in serial projection images using an algorithm which we call \"diverging squares\". Each projection image is then realigned in the x-y plane so that the heart center conforms to the projected position of a fixed point in space. The shifted projections are reconstructed using the normal filtered backprojection algorithm. In validation studies, the motion correction procedure successfully eliminated movement artifacts in a heart phantom. Image quality was also improved in over one-half of 36 exercise thallium patient studies. The corrected images had smoother and more continuous left ventricular walls, greater clarity of the left ventricular cavity, and reduced streak artifacts. Rest injected or redistribution images, however, were often made worse, due to reduced heart to liver activity ratios and poor tracking of the heart center. Analysis of curves of heart position versus projection angle suggests that translation of the heart is common during imaging after exercise, and results from both abrupt patient movements, and a gradual upward shift of the heart. Our motion correction technique appears to represent a promising new approach for elimination of movement artifacts and enhancement of resolution in exercise 201Tl cardiac SPECT images.\r"

  ".W": "To evaluate a kinetic model for measuring protein synthesis rates by positron emission tomography (PET) in neoplastic and normal tissue, metabolic studies with L-[1-14C]tyrosine were carried out. As an animal model, rats bearing Walker 256 carcinosarcoma were used. Within 60 min after injection, several metabolic parameters were measured. The highest radioactivity uptake, expressed as the differential absorption ratio, was found in pancreas, followed by liver, tumor, and brain. A rapid decarboxylation was observed during the first 15 min. After 60 min, 7.4% of the total injected 14C was expired as 14CO2. In plasma a significant amount of [14C]bicarbonate was detected, but in tissue the amount was negligible. Protein incorporation increased with time. The incorporation rate was the highest in the liver followed by pancreas, tumor, and brain tissues. At 60 min after injection, more than approximately 80% of the 14C in tissue was protein bound. In plasma after a rapid clearance during the first 15 min, the total 14C level increased rapidly and paralleled the increase of protein-bound 14C. As nonprotein [14C]metabolites, in plasma, tumor and brain tissues, p-hydroxyphenylpyruvic acid, p-hydroxyphenyllactic acid, and unidentified metabolites were observed by high performance liquid chromatography. The formation of 14C-labeled 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine was found to be negligible. The total amount of these nonprotein metabolites increased with time. At 60 min after injection the percentages of the total nonprotein metabolites and [14C]bicarbonate were only 5.0%, 1.9%, and 3.7% in plasma, tumor and brain tissue, respectively. From our data it is concluded that [11C]carboxylic-labeled tyrosine would be a suitable radiopharmaceutical for measuring protein synthesis rates in neoplastic and normal tissue by PET.\r"

In copper-sufficient rats, ceruloplasmin oxidase activity did not peak in the serum until at least 24 h after IL-1 was given. The rates of ceruloplasmin synthesis, as measured by pulse labeling with [3H]leucine and immunoprecipitation, peaked 12 h after IL-1 and returned to basal rates by 24 h. Copper had to be given to copper-deficient rats for the IL-1 to induce oxidase activity. This activity was stimulated by copper alone in the deficient rats but not to the same level as with IL-1 plus copper. Copper alone did not increase the synthesis rate. IL-1 alone stimulated the synthesis rate without increasing the oxidase activity in the copper-deficient rats. The induction pattern of ceruloplasmin synthesis by IL-1 was the same in the copper-deficient rats given copper as in copper-sufficient rats. Actinomycin D blocked the stimulation of ceruloplasmin synthesis by IL-1. It was concluded that ceruloplasmin is dependent on copper incorporation for oxidase activity, but its synthesis is induced by IL-1 regardless of dietary copper levels, probably by a mechanism involving transcriptional regulation.\r"

This deformity was clinically and radiologically different from that found in 40 patients with classical or definite rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and tended to appear early in the course of disease. Characteristics of this arthropathy included nonerosive carpal collapse; exceptional erosion of the styloid processes; Z deformity of the thumb; nonerosive ulnar deviation and subluxation of MCP joints; parametacarpophalangeal joint hook formation; scant and asymmetric joint erosions; and swan neck deformity of the fingers. Most of these changes seemed to be due to involvement of the ligaments rather than to the destructive effect of synovitis. Patients with SLE with deforming arthropathy had a higher frequency of rheumatoid factor positivity, sicca symptoms and antibodies to native DNA, whereas they had lower incidence of facial rash and photosensitivity than did those without. Other manifestations did not differ. We propose that most patients with SLE with deforming arthropathy belong to a subset of SLE rather than representing the coexistence of SLE and RA.\r"

FTCH is highly effective in sealing of tissues and in establishing hemostasis. We evaluated FTCH in experimentally produced liver (n = 6) and splenic (n = 12) injuries in 18 adult mongrel dogs. The stability of the parenchymal seal of the splenic injuries was tested by splenic tissue pressure elevation after temporary ligation of the splenic vein. No breakthrough bleeding occurred up to a parenchymal pressure of 16.3 +/- 5 mm Hg. Complete hemostasis was easily achieved in all animals before closure. When the dogs were re-explored postoperatively at intervals of either 14 or 30 days, there was no gross evidence of recurrent bleeding. Histologic examinations demonstrated a partially regenerated capsule covering an unspecific fibrovascular granulation tissue and progressive resorption of FTCH without significant inflammatory response. We conclude the following: FTCH provides adequate hemostatic control of experimental liver and splenic injuries. FTCH has excellent tissue compatibility and can be applied easily and safely to hemorrhaging parenchymal wounds. It will not replace adequate surgical techniques, but could be useful as a quickly available and easily applicable hemostatic means in diffuse or acute bleeding of liver and spleen.\r"

Frozen kidney sections and peripheral blood cells were stained with a panel of anti-rat monoclonal antibodies and quantitated by epifluorescence microscopy. An increase in Ia+ cells (60/1000 TIC) (P less than 0.001) and OX42+ macrophages (MO) (18/1000 TIC) (P less than 0.05) were observed on day 5. On day 7 the infiltrate consisted of OX19+ T-lymphocytes (29/1000 TIC) (P less than 0.001) and OX42+ MO (68/1000 TIC) (P less than 0.001). The majority of the lymphocytes expressed the OX8 cytotoxic T cell marker (23/1000 TIC) (P less than 0.001). The severe mixed cellular lesion present on day 14 was dominated by OX42+ MO (113/1000 TIC) (P less than 0.001). With resolution of proteinuria on days 20 and 28, the infiltrate decreased, although OX42+ MO persisted on day 28 (46/1000 TIC) (P less than 0.001). The severity of the cellular lesion correlated with the degree of albuminuria (r = 0.57 to 0.81 for the antibody panel). Expression of Ia antigens by proximal tubular epithelial cells markedly decreased during peak proteinuria but normalized by day 28. Increased deposition of C3 and IgG was not detected. Reversible tubulointerstitial nephritis develops in PAN-treated rats and may be a consequence of severe proteinuria.\r"

The spontaneous or externally imposed transepithelial potential (PD) and short circuit current (SCC) were also recorded in most experiments. It was observed that: (1) Phosphate transfer was rapidly and reversibly modified by changes in mucosal sodium concentration in open circuit conditions. (2) Between four and six minutes after changing mucosal NaCl concentration, phosphate fluxes reached a new steady-state value. (3) The observed correlation between the Na-dependent phosphate flux and the Na-dependent transmembrane potential was high (r = 0.99, N = 12). (4) In open circuit conditions, the mucosa-to-serosa unidirectional phosphate fluxes were inhibited by 10(-5) M amiloride, while the serosa-to-mucosa movements were increased. (5) On the contrary, no effects of mucosal NaCl concentration or amiloride on the mucosa-to-serosa phosphate fluxes were detected in short circuit conditions. (6) The transepithelial phosphate transfer was linearly related to phosphate concentration and insensitive to arsenate (10(-3) M) action. (7) An externally imposed PD was less effective for driving a phosphate movement than the one depending on Na, suggesting some type of coupling between Na+ and phosphate transports. (8) The mucosa-to-serosa phosphate fluxes were reduced by parathyroid hormone and oxytocin. Maximum inhibition was observed four minutes after the hormonal action. It is concluded that the transepithelial PD plays a major role in phosphate handling in frog urinary bladder.\r"

Before chemotherapy the immediate effect of G-CSF was a transient depression in circulating neutrophils followed by a dose-dependent rise. Neutrophil counts up to 80 X 10(9)/l were achieved. G-CSF administration following melphalan reduced the period of neutropenia caused by melphalan. G-CSF was well tolerated and the only clinical observation that appeared related to G-CSF administration was slight bone pain during some infusions. G-CSF was rapidly cleared from the blood with a mean half-life of 110 min for the second phase.

Beta-lactamase-producing bacteria were found in 262 (51%) of 513 patients with HNI; 72% had aerobic BLPB and 57% had anaerobic BLPB. The infections, where these organisms were most frequently recovered, were adenoiditis (85% of patients), tonsillitis in adults (82%) and children (74%), retropharyngeal abscess (71%), and chronic otitis media (57%). The predominant BLPB were Staphylococcus aureus (49% of patients with BLPB), the Bacteroides-melaninogenicus group (28%), the Bacteroides fragilis group (20%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (13%), Hemophilus influenzae (5%), and Branhamella catarrhalis (3%). The high incidence of recovery of BLPB in head and neck infections may have important implications on the antimicrobial management of these infections.\r"

  ".W": "We prospectively examined early changes in platelets and plasma proteolytic systems in 12 vaccinated and 6 unvaccinated volunteers in whom Rocky Mountain spotted fever developed after challenge with Rickettsia rickettsii. The platelet counts declined while the plasma concentration of beta-thromboglobulin and the ratio of beta-thromboglobulin to platelet factor 4 increased, indicating in vivo activation of platelets. Plasma levels of antithrombin III decreased and levels of fibrinopeptide A increased, indicating in vivo activation of the coagulation system. Plasma fibrinogen levels peaked at 24 hours and gradually declined; this is consistent with the behavior of fibrinogen as an acute-phase reactant. Prolongation of the prothrombin time and a decrease in plasma levels of factor VII in the absence of evidence of liver injury suggested possible activation of the extrinsic pathway of coagulation. A decline in plasma prekallikrein levels with an increase in plasma C1-inhibitor-kallikrein complexes suggested activation of kallikrein, probably through the intrinsic coagulation system. Elevations in levels of plasma fibrin-degradation products and alpha 2-antiplasmin-plasmin complexes with declines in plasminogen and alpha 2-antiplasmin levels provided evidence of activation of the fibrinolytic system. Elevated plasma levels of tissue plasminogen activator and von Willebrand factor reflected endothelial stimulation. Thus, even early in the course of Rocky Mountain spotted fever that is treated promptly, there is activation of platelets, coagulation pathways, and the fibrinolytic system. These changes may be related to endothelial perturbation, a major pathogenetic mechanism in the disorder.\r"

This intimate cell contact presumably enables the stem cells and their progeny to respond to stimuli present on the stromal cell surface. While the nature of these stimuli has not been determined, it is likely that growth factors play some role. Recently, it was demonstrated that the natural and the recombinant haemopoietic growth factor, granulocyte/macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), could be adsorbed out of solution by an extract of human marrow stromal extracellular matrix (ECM) with retention of biological activity. However, the precise ECM molecules involved were not identified. Here, we clearly demonstrate that the major sulphated glycosaminoglycan of mouse marrow stroma, heparan sulphate, possesses the ability to adsorb both GM-CSF and the multilineage haemopoietic growth factor, Interleukin 3 (IL-3). Furthermore, these growth factors, once bound, can be presented in the biologically active form to haemopoietic cells.\r"

At the age of 14 years, the patient had been operated on for a sellar tumor; he presented 12 years later with severe headache, at which time computed tomographic and magnetic resonance imaging scans revealed multiple intracranial metastases. Histopathology examination showed pituitary neoplastic cells with positive immunostaining for prolactin. The patient was investigated with positron emission tomography (PET) and dopamine D2-receptor binding, and the amino acid metabolism of the tumor was characterized in vivo. High dopamine D2-receptor binding and high amino acid metabolism were found in the tumor. The patient was subsequently treated with bromocriptine injections that resulted in a decrease in serum prolactin levels, decreased dopamine D2-receptor binding, reduced amino acid metabolism, and a reduction in tumor volume. This case demonstrates a beneficial effect of bromocriptine treatment in a patient with prolactinoma with multiple intracranial metastases. It also illustrates the great potential of PET in the in vivo characterization of the D2-binding and the high sensitivity of 11C-labeled L-methionine in the follow-up of treatment in patients with pituitary adenomas.\r"

These procedures have a high morbidity and mortality from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) fistula, meningitis, and abscess. We used a canine model to test three different techniques of dural closure after transoral intradural operation: primary suture closure, laser patch weld, and fibrin glue patch closures. The primary suture closure technique was inadequate. All eight leaked CSF at the time of operation, and five had radiographic leaks and were incompetent at autopsy. All seven of the laser closures leaked CSF at operation, yet only one was incompetent at autopsy. The fibrin glue technique was superior and provided a solid seal at operation, even with repeated Valsalva maneuvers to 40 mm Hg. The immediate and persistent seal at operation is clinically significant because it may prevent CSF leak, meningitis, and abscess formation in human patients after transoral surgery. Fibrin glue is excellent for repairing complex dural defects and merits evaluation in clinical trials.\r"

The 25 monoclonal antibodies were reactive with HSV-infected cells but not with uninfected cells. Of these antibodies, three bound to several SCC cell lines and to one non-SCC cell line (K562). One of these three antibodies also reacted with sections of oral SCC tumors, the adjacent mucosa, and normal esophageal epithelium. In contrast, it did not bind to sections of kidney, spleen, esophageal smooth muscle, and skin. To evaluate whether the observed antibody binding could reflect an actual infection by HSV, hybridization experiments between K562 DNA and HSV DNA were performed. HSV DNA sequences were found in K562 DNA at a ratio of 0.1 genome-equivalents/cell. Although these data do not characterize the nature of the relationship, they clearly confirm the postulated association of HSV with some tumors (in particular oral SCC).\r"

We report here the isolation and characterization of a cytotactin cDNA clone (lambda C801) that encodes 933 amino acids, equivalent to about half of a cytotactin polypeptide. Clone lambda C801 is an authentic cytotactin cDNA: it encodes a polypeptide that reacts with a monoclonal anti-cytotactin antibody and its deduced amino acid sequence is identical for 15 amino acids to the directly determined sequence of a CNBr fragment that reacted with the same antibody. Southern blot analyses with fragments of lambda C801 suggested that there may be only one cytotactin gene, but RNA transfer blots detected multiple mRNAs ranging in size from 6.5 to 8.0 kilobases. An 8.0-kilobase message and a Mr 240,000 cytotactin polypeptide were present in embryonic gizzard but not brain, while a 7.2-kilobase message and a Mr 220,000 polypeptide were present in brain but not gizzard. These results indicate that differential splicing of primary transcripts of the cytotactin gene yields various site-specific polypeptides. Sequence analyses of lambda C801 indicated that it specifies a region with extensive similarities to other proteins: the sequence begins with four consecutive epidermal growth factor-like repeats that are followed by eight segments that closely resemble each other and the type III repeats in fibronectin, and it ends with a 66 amino acid sequence similar to part of the beta and gamma chains of fibrinogen. One fibronectin-like repeat contains a single Arg-Gly-Asp sequence. The similarities with all three of these apparently unrelated proteins are extensive, suggesting that cytotactin has an evolutionary and possibly a functional relationship to each.\r"

  ".W": "A gene in chromosome region 13q14 has been identified as the human retinoblastoma susceptibility (RB) gene on the basis of altered gene expression found in virtually all retinoblastomas. In order to further characterize the RB gene and its structural alterations, we examined genomic clones of the RB gene isolated from both a normal human genomic library and a library made from DNA of the retinoblastoma cell line Y79. First, a restriction and exon map of the RB gene was constructed by aligning overlapping genomic clones, yielding three contiguous regions (\"contigs\") of 150 kilobases total length separated by two gaps. At least 20 exons were identified in genomic clones, and these were provisionally numbered. Second, two overlapping genomic clones that demonstrated a DNA deletion of exons 2 through 6 from one RB allele were isolated from the Y79 library. To confirm and extend this result, a unique sequence probe from intron 1 was used to detect similar and possibly identical heterozygous deletions in genomic DNA from three retinoblastoma cell lines, thereby explaining the origins of their shortened RB mRNA transcripts. The same probe detected genomic rearrangements in fibroblasts from two hereditary retinoblastoma patients, indicating that intron 1 includes a frequent site for mutations conferring predisposition to retinoblastoma. Third, this probe also detected a polymorphic site for BamHI with allele frequencies near 0.5/0.5. Identification of commonly mutated regions will contribute significantly to genetic diagnosis in retinoblastoma patients and families.\r"

It has not been possible to induce SLE in animal models by DNA immunization or by challenge with anti-DNA antibodies. We herewith report a murine model of SLE-like disease induced by immunization of C3H.SW female mice with a common human monoclonal anti-DNA idiotype (16/6 idiotype). Following a booster injection with the 16/6 idiotype, high levels of murine anti-16/6 and anti-anti-16/6 antibodies (associated with anti-DNA activity) were detected in the sera of the immunized mice. Elevated titers of autoantibodies reacting with DNA, poly(I), poly(dT), ribonucleoprotein, autoantigens [Sm, SS-A (Ro), and SS-B (La)], and cardiolipin were noted. The serological findings were associated with increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate, leukopenia, proteinuria, immune complex deposition in the glomerular mesangium, and sclerosis of the glomeruli. The immune complexes in the kidneys were shown to contain the 16/6 idiotype. This experimental SLE-like model may be used to elucidate the mechanisms underlying SLE.\r"

  ".W": "This study documents the curing of a congenitally acquired chronic viral infection and the acquisition of T-cell competence by a previously tolerant host. Infection of mice with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) is a classic model of viral persistence and antigen-specific T-cell unresponsiveness. Mice infected at birth or in utero become lifelong carriers with no detectable virus-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses. This chronic infection can be eliminated by adoptive transfer of Lyt-2+ T cells from LCMV-immune mice. To determine whether these cured carriers were capable of generating their own LCMV-specific CTL response, mice congenic at the Thy-1 locus (Thy-1.1 and Thy-1.2) were used in the adoptive transfer experiments. Host-derived T-cell responses were checked after treating the cured carriers with a monoclonal antibody to deplete the immune donor T cells. Such cured carrier mice were able to generate a host-derived virus-specific CTL response and resisted a second LCMV challenge in the absence of any donor T cells. In addition, bone marrow cells from these cured carriers could functionally reconstitute irradiated mice. Thus this report demonstrates the acquisition of LCMV-specific T-cell competence by previously unresponsive carrier mice infected in utero. These results show that exposure to a virus even during embryonic life does not cause a permanent deletion of specific T cells. These findings are of significance to the understanding of tolerance mechanisms and have implications for the treatment of chronic viral infections.\r"

Expression of the soluble H-2Kk antigen in the transgenic mice was demonstrated in cell supernatants of biosynthetically labeled splenic and thymic Con A blasts as well as bone marrow-derived macrophages. Soluble H-2Kk molecules were also present in the sera of the transgenic animals. No cell-surface expression of the H-2Kk antigen could be observed. In spite of the presence of the soluble H-2Kk molecules in the transgenic mice, the animals were able to generate H-2Kk-specific cytolytic T cells as well as antibody responses when stimulated with cell-surface-bound H-2Kk antigens. These responses were indistinguishable from those of the nontransgenic littermates. Possible explanations for the observed lack of tolerance are discussed.\r"

The results showed that interleukin 5 induced the selective differentiation and proliferation of eosinophils. After 3 weeks in culture with interleukin 5, essentially all nonadherent cells in both bone marrow and cord blood cell cultures became eosinophilic myelocytes. Culture of the same cells with interleukin 4 resulted in the selective growth of OKT3+ lymphocytes. However, OKT3+ cells did not develop if the bone marrow cells were depleted of OKT3+/OKT11+ cells prior to the culture, indicating that interleukin 4 induced the proliferation of a subpopulation of resting T cells present in cord blood and bone marrow cell preparations. In suspension cultures of bone marrow cells and cord blood cells grown in the presence of interleukin 3, basophilic, eosinophilic, and neutrophilic myelocytes and macrophages developed within 2 weeks. By 3 weeks, however, the majority of nonadherent cells became eosinophilic myelocytes. In contrast to mouse bone marrow cell cultures, neither interleukin 3 nor a combination of interleukins 3 and 4 induced the differentiation of mast cells in human bone marrow or cord blood cell cultures.\r"

Anti-idiotypic antibodies were induced at the same time. The average affinity of the mouse antibodies (Ka approximately equal to 10(7) M-1) is similar to that of rabbit anti-IgD and of syngeneic anti-IgE induced by the same procedure. Results indicate that B cells of the mice are not tolerant to serum IgD and that tolerance is maintained at the level of T cells. Direct interaction of the syngeneic anti-IgD with cell-surface IgD was minimal, and there was no convincing evidence that cell-surface IgD was down-regulated in the anti-IgD-producing mice. Further studies, preferably employing monoclonal anti-IgD, are required to determine whether epitopes on cell-surface IgD can be recognized by syngeneic anti-IgD. The ability to generate in vivo high titers of anti-IgD should facilitate the production of such monoclonal antibodies.\r"

We studied the effect on arterial response to mechanical injury of cyclosporin A, a drug that inhibits T-lymphocyte activation. Cyclosporin A treatment at surgery caused a persistent inhibition of the intimal proliferative lesion. Cyclosporin A also inhibited expression of Ia antigens on smooth muscle cells in situ but had no direct effects on smooth muscle cell proliferation in culture. Therefore, the inhibition of intimal cell proliferation appears to be mediated via the immune system.\r"

Peptides derived from these two functional domains can act as partial agonists and antagonists in biological assays of FGF activity. Peptides related to the sequences of FGF-(24-68)-NH2 and FGF-(106-115)-NH2 inhibit thymidine incorporation into 3T3 fibroblasts when they are stimulated by FGF but have no effect when the cells are treated with either platelet-derived growth factor or epidermal growth factor. They also possess partial agonist activity and can stimulate DNA synthesis when tested in the absence of exogenous FGF. The active peptides have no effect on the binding of epidermal growth factor to its receptor on A431 cells and they can modulate the effects of FGF, but not fibronectin, on endothelial cell adhesion. The results suggest the possibility of designing specific analogs of FGF that are capable of inhibiting the biological effects of FGF.\r"

In this report we demonstrate that a truncated 180-amino acid fragment representing approximately the N-terminal half of the extracellular region of CD4 is found primarily in soluble form in the extracellular medium. Epitope analysis with a panel of anti-CD4 murine monoclonal antibodies indicates that the fragment reacts with those antibodies known to block the interaction between CD4 and the human immunodeficiency virus envelope glycoprotein but reacts poorly or not at all with those antibodies that do not block this interaction. We also show that the fragment forms a specific complex with a soluble form of gp120, the CD4-binding subunit of the viral envelope glycoprotein.

An antiserum directed against human IL-1 beta was used to stain the human brain immunohistochemically for IL-1 beta-like immunoreactive neural elements. IL-1 beta-immunoreactive fibers were found innervating the key endocrine and autonomic cell groups that control the central components of the acute phase reaction.

  ".W": "A new type of agonist-binding subunit of rat neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) was identified. Rat genomic DNA and complementary DNA encoding this subunit (alpha 2) were cloned and analyzed. Complementary DNA expression studies in Xenopus oocytes revealed that the injection of messenger RNAs (mRNAs) for alpha 2 and beta 2 (a neuronal nAChR subunit) led to the generation of a functional nAChR. In contrast to the other known neuronal nAChRs, the receptor produced by the injection of alpha 2 and beta 2 mRNAs was resistant to the alpha-neurotoxin Bgt3.1. In situ hybridization histochemistry showed that alpha 2 mRNA was expressed in a small number of regions, in contrast to the wide distribution of the other known agonist-binding subunits (alpha 3 and alpha 4) mRNAs. These results demonstrate that the alpha 2 subunit differs from other known agonist-binding alpha-subunits of nAChRs in its distribution in the brain and in its pharmacology.\r"

The gene encoding chain c of Lumbricus terrestris hemoglobin has the two-intron, three-exon structure characteristic of vertebrate globin genes, and the exact positions of the splice junctions are conserved. The two introns interrupting the coding sequence are longer than those of known hemoglobins but shorter than myoglobin introns. The gene encodes a secretory preglobin containing a 16-residue signal peptide, as expected for an extracellular hemoglobin. However, no intron separates the DNA encoding the signal sequence from that of the globin sequence. The 3' untranslated region of the Lumbricus gene is much longer than those of the genes for other hemoglobins and is similar to those found for myoglobins.\r"

SPECT showed thallium defects (37 patients, mostly in the posteroapical wall), malrotation (23), apical aneurysm (5) and dilatation (7). ECG showed abnormal QRS (36 patients), particularly as a posterolateral pattern (13). Both methods of assessment were normal in only 7 patients. The Duchenne type frequently showed both a thallium defect (particularly in the posteroapical wall) and an abnormal QRS (predominantly in the posterolateral wall); the 3 other types showed abnormalities over the 5 LV wall segments in both tests. The percent of agreement between the 2 tests was 64, 66, 70, 72 and 72 for the lateral, apical, anteroseptal, posterior and inferior walls, respectively. The 2 tests were discordant in 31% of the LV wall, with SPECT (+) but ECG (-) in 21% (mostly in the apicoinferior wall) and SPECT (-) but ECG (+) in 10% (mostly in the lateral wall). Some patients showed large SPECT hypoperfusion despite minimal electrocardiographic changes. ECG thus appeared to underestimate LV fibrosis and to reflect posteroapical rather than posterolateral dystrophy in its posterolateral QRS pattern. In this disease, extensive SPECT hypoperfusion was also shown, irrespective of clinical subtype and skeletal involvement.\r"

The recovery level of radioactivity in plasma as 1,25(OH)2D after [3H]25(OH)D administration was lower in older animals; ovariectomy reduced [3H]1,25(OH)2D recovery in both young and adult animals. 1,25(OH)2D synthesis by kidney slices was reduced in all adult animals and in ovariectomized young animals. Calcium absorption was also lower in adult animals and in young ovariectomized animals then in controls. Beta-estradiol administration increased recovery of [3H]1,25(OH)2D but not [3H]24,25(OH)2D, which is parallel to the general lack of effect of ovariectomy on 24,25(OH)2D production. Parathyroidectomy eliminated the estrogen effect on 1,25(OH)2D production. Thus, estrogen loss and advancing age reduced 1,25(OH)2D production and Ca absorption independently, the estrogen effect being mediated via the parathyroid gland.\r"

However, DRC-1 was not expressed in any of diffuse, small cleaved (0/6) and diffuse, large cell (0/6). Although S-100 protein was positive in the majority of these DRC-1-positive cases on the paraffin embedded specimens, positive nodules were less intense and smaller in number compared with those of DRC-1 on frozen tissue specimens. These results suggest that in case of small lymphocytic lymphoma found to be positive for DRC-1, the networks of the DRCs are expressed in the pseudofollicular proliferation centers. This study also suggests that the networks of the DRCs newly appear accompanying the neoplastic growth rather than originating from residual germinal centers, and that neoplastic small cleaved cells play a major role in inducing the DRCs in the positive cases of follicular lymphoma, MZL, and small lymphocytic lymphoma.\r"

The phenotype included immunoglobulin isotypes; B-cell maturation/differentiation antigens of clusters of differentiation CD9, CD10, CD19-24, CD37, CD38; T-lymphocyte antigens in CD5-7; HLA-DR; peanut agglutinin binding capacity; terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase; the activation marker CD25 (interleukin-2 receptor); and the proliferation marker transferrin receptor. The phenotype and clinical data were available for 109 patients. Two patients underwent bone marrow transplantation, and 15 patients (with low or intermediate grade NHL) did not receive treatment intended to achieve complete remission. These 17 cases were excluded from the analysis. For individual markers, CD23 expression was associated with a longer actuarial disease-free survival (50% survival in CD23-positive cases was 40 months; and in CD23-negative cases, 16 months; P = 0.01). Among the total study population of 92 patients, this finding applied in particular to those with a low-grade malignancy according to the Kiel classification (P = 0.03). In high-grade NHL (Kiel classification) the absence of CD38 or presence of CD24 on tumor cells correlated with a higher degree of disease-free survival (P values 0.009 and 0.04, respectively). For a combination of five CD markers associated with stages in physiologic B-lymphocyte maturation/differentiation (CD9, CD10, CD21-23), the lowest measure of disease-free survival was observed where NHLs were at an immature stage, and the greatest extent of survival where NHLs were associated with a resting B-cell stage (P = 0.006). These statistical significances aside, the detailed immunologic phenotyping has relatively little prognostic value when compared with that of the malignancy grade assessed by conventional histopathology.\r"

This report gives descriptive information about the incidence of depression and anxiety disorders in a general population. Using data gathered in a 16-year follow-up of an adult sample selected as part of the Stirling County Study (Canada), the incidence of these types of disorders was found to be approximately nine cases per 1,000 persons per year. The data suggest that for every man who became ill for the first time with one of these disorders, three women became ill. Incidence tended to be higher among relatively young persons. These incidence rates are consistent with prevalence rates of approximately 10 per cent to 15 per cent for depression and anxiety disorders aggregated together, given an estimated average duration of illness of about 10 years. It is concluded that these incidence rates are fairly realistic in view of evidence that disorders of these types tend to be chronic.\r"

The Km of the L. mexicana kinases was 123-223 microM, compared to the value of 70 microM for the beef heart kinase. Purine nucleoside analogs are potent antileishmanial agents that are phosphorylated to their respective triphosphates. The mechanism of the analogs is thought to involve competition of the triphosphates with ATP. Cordycepin triphosphate inhibited the amastigote, promastigote, and beef heart protein kinases approximately equally. However, the Kis of formycin A triphosphate for the leishmanial kinases (Ki 40-120 microM) were far less than that of the beef heart kinase (Ki 1,380 microM).

Studies were performed in solutions of impermeant buffers at pH 7.4 (corresponding to mammalian physiologic pH) and at pH 9.2 (close to the pKa of procaine and DEAE) to test for extracellular pH-dependent increases in drug permeation and potency. Both procaine and DEAE inhibited compound action potentials at pH 7.4 and 9.2 in a reversible and dose-dependent manner, and both were approximately ten-fold more potent at pH 9.2 than at pH 7.4, procaine inhibiting the action potential height by 50% at 0.15 mM (pH 9.2) and 1.1 mM (pH 7.4), DEAE at 4 mM (pH 9.2) and 70 mM (pH 7.4). In contrast, PABA at concentrations up to 25 mM and at either pH failed to inhibit compound action potentials, and did not modify the effects of DEAE when both drugs were given together. Procaine produced greater use-dependent block at the higher pH and at higher stimulation rates (100 Hz vs. 40 Hz); DEAE produced almost no use-dependent block. These observations suggest: 1) that DEAE might account for some of the neuropharmacologic activity of procaine in techniques that favor the accumulation of metabolites (such as those requiring large doses or prolonged infusions); and 2) that alkalinization of procaine and DEAE solutions appears to increase their potency for both resting and use-dependent block of action potentials.\r"

  ".W": "Human alveolar macrophages (AM) provide less accessory support for mitogen- and antigen-stimulated lymphocyte proliferation than do autologous blood-derived macrophages (BM). This is at least in part due to suppression mediated by AM, but the mechanism of such suppression is not understood. To determine whether AM-mediated suppression is related to AM interaction with suppressor lymphocytes (Ts), we examined the accessory cell function of both AM and BM for the generation and functional expression of Ts induced by concanavalin A (Con A). The data indicate that human AM are equivalent to BM for the generation of Con A-induced Ts, but AM mediate less suppression of Con A-induced Ts, once generated, than do BM. Addition of indomethacin did not increase lymphocyte proliferation when AM served as accessory cells. Supernatant fluids of Con A-exposed AM promoted greater proliferation of human T-lymphocytes and mouse thymocytes than did supernatant fluids from Con A-exposed BM. Interleukin-1 inhibitor activity was not detected in the supernatant fluids. These observations make it unlikely that soluble factors alone account for AM-mediated suppression. Thus, at least for the Con A-induced Ts system, AM do not mediate suppression either via better generation or greater functional expression of suppressor cells relative to BM. The paradoxically greater proliferation of lymphocytes stimulated by the supernatant fluids of Con A-exposed AM raises the possibility that suppression of Con A-stimulated lymphocyte proliferation observed when AM serve as the accessory cells in primary culture may be related to AM secretion of a molecule with IL-1-like activity.\r"

In this study, we evaluated the clinical role of measurements of LDH in determining diagnosis and prognosis in 84 patients infected with HIV who presented with pulmonary problems. The mean serum LDH level of the 54 patients with PCP was 361 IU, which was significantly higher than the mean of 224 IU found in the 30 patients with other causes of pulmonary disease (p less than 0.001). Overlap of individual values occurred between the 2 groups. Levels greater than 450 IU consistently predicted PCP in our population, however, and normal values were found in only 7% of the patients with PCP. LDH levels in a group of 8 patients who developed PCP from conventional causes of immunosuppression were similar to those seen in PCP associated with HIV. LDH determinations prior to the episode of PCP were available in 45 patients and 39 (87%) showed an increase of greater than 50 IU at the time of diagnosis. The mean LDH in those who survived PCP was 340 IU, which was significantly less than the mean of 447 IU found in those who died (p less than 0.05). Significant overlap between the groups precluded use of the LDH as a predictor of mortality in an individual patient. Serial determinations of LDH during treatment for PCP showed that 27 of 36 (75%) of the survivors had gradual decreases of LDH, whereas 9 of 12 (75%) nonsurvivors had rising values during treatment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In adults, physician-diagnosed chronic bronchitis and emphysema were less prevalent in this population than in a previously studied sample of non-Hispanic whites in New Mexico. Spirometric testing was confirmatory; less than 1% of the Hispanic males and females had chronic air-flow obstruction. The prevalence of cigarette usage in the Hispanics was comparable to data from non-Hispanic whites in New Mexico and from nationwide surveys.

Of those patients with PLFs, 64% had resolution of their major symptom; when no PLF was found, 44% had a similar outcome. We concluded that 1) PLFs often behave as if they are epiphenomena in relation to hearing and balance, 2) PLFs can be intermittent, 3) PLF surgery is disappointing for restoration of hearing in sudden hearing loss when compared to the rate of spontaneous recovery, 4) stabilizing a fluctuating or progressive loss is a more realistic goal, and 5) establishing preoperative criteria for exploration is still a problem.\r"

Auditory dysfunction that showed the difference between the right and left ears was confirmed by auditory brain stem response and Preyer's reflex in the animals with spontaneous nystagmus. Damage to the organ of Corti was the most significant cause for the auditory dysfunction. Though findings attributed to the rupture of the round window membrane were recognized in four ears, the rupture or hemorrhage of the round window membrane was not the direct cause of the auditory dysfunction. The significance of the round window membrane rupture is discussed.\r"

Although the finding of neonatal thrombocytopenia in the presence of maternal connective-tissue disease suggests an autoimmune thrombocytopenia, platelet antibody studies were negative in both mother/infant pairs. We have found the Ro (SS-A) antibody with increased frequency in idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura and thrombocytopenia associated with Sjogren's syndrome, but the nature of the association is unknown.

For each case four controls were selected; they were matched to the case by month and year of birth, sex, and ethnic origin. Cases and controls were all born in Birmingham. Of the cases, 62 out of 108 (57%) had received BCG, and of the controls, 336 out of 432 (78%) had received BCG. The estimated protective efficacy of vaccination was 64% (95% confidence limits, 43% and 77%).

Population-based data capabilities of the Rochester/Olmsted County Epidemiology Project were used to study the performance of surgery among persons greater than or equal to 90 years of age for the 11-year period, 1975-1985. During this time, 224 residents of Olmsted County, Minnesota underwent 301 separate operations. The annual operation rate increased over the course of the study (trend test, p less than 0.001), reaching a plateau of 89.0 per 1000 person-years. This suggests a potential for nearly 91,000 operations annually in this age group based on 1987 U.S. Census estimates. Ninety-two per cent were discharged from the hospital alive, and 5-year survival was consistent with that expected (23% vs. 17%). Increased longevity of the general population, combined with increased performance of surgery in this rapidly growing segment of the population, may have significant implications for health care planning.\r"

From January, 1984, to April, 1987, at our hospital, 700 patients underwent isolated coronary artery bypass grafting. The presence or absence of 20 risk factors was determined for each patient. The first 300 patients formed the initial database of the Bayesian predictive model, and the remaining 400 patients were prospectively evaluated in four groups of 100 each. Each group was prospectively evaluated and then incorporated into the database to update the model. There was good agreement between predicted and observed results. Bayesian theory is particularly suited to this task because it (1) accommodates multiple risk factors, (2) is tailored to one's specific practice, (3) determines individual, rather than group, prognosis, and (4) can be updated with time to compensate for a changing patient population. These flexible attributes are especially valuable in light of recent changes in the coronary artery bypass graft patient profile.\r"

The subjects also ambulated with long leg braces (LLB), using a rolling walker, and a drag/swing-to gait; and they stood using LLB and FNS separately. Oxygen consumption (VO2), carbon dioxide production (VCO2), respiratory exchange ratio (VCO2/VO2), kcal/kg/meter, kcal/kg/minute, heart rate, blood pressure, and O2 debt with recovery time were recorded. During FNS walking, energy costs (kcal/kg/min) were 59% to 75% of maximal aerobic power (MAP), as determined during the combined activities of maximal arm ergometry and FNS leg stimulation. As the speed of FNS walking increased, there was no increase in energy costs; energy efficiency (kcal/kg/meter) equaled that of LLB ambulation. One subject showed decreased O2 debt with increased speed of FNS walking. At speeds approaching .4m/sec, FNS walking energy costs were similar to those of LLB ambulation. FNS energy costs relative to working muscle mass were less than those of LLB. When maximal stimulus parameters were used for FNS standing (20mA amplitude, 25 pps frequency, and 150 microseconds pulse width), energy costs were 100% more than those of normal or LLB standing. However, when the minimal stimulus necessary to maintain a standing position was used, FNS energy costs decreased by 35% to 47%. At speeds between .4 and .6m/sec, FNS walking is a viable alternative to LLB ambulation. Major energy cost reduction should be possible in the future.\r"

Physical activity was determined by a graded questionnaire and varied from sedentary to heavy vocational and avocational activity levels. Bone mineral density (L2 through L4) was measured with dual-photon absorptiometry. Back extensor strength was determined with use of a strain-gauge dynamometer. Bone mineral density ranged from 0.77 to 1.49g/cm2 (mean +/- SD, 1.06 +/- 0.18g/cm2). Back extensor strength ranged from 37 to 145 lb (84.6 +/- 23.5 lb). Physical activity scores ranged from 3 to 13 (8.0 +/- 2.7). Statistical analysis demonstrated a significant positive correlation (r = 0.34, p less than 0.005) between bone mineral density and back extensor strength. Bone mineral density was also positively correlated with the level of physical activity (r = 0.24, p less than 0.05). There was a significant positive correlation between back extensor strength and level of physical activity (r = 0.37, p less than 0.005). The data suggest that levels of physical activity and back muscle strength may be contributors to the bone mineral density of vertebral bodies.\r"

The role of the receptor in these tissues is unclear. There is, however, a relationship between the presence and quantity of the vitamin D receptor in a malignant cell line and the antineoplastic effect of vitamin D on that cell line. We found that Y-79 retinoblastoma cells have receptors specific for calcitriol (1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol). Scatchard analysis of the receptor data shows a quantity of 56,000 receptors per retinoblastoma cell. These receptors have a dissociation constant of 1.18 nmol/L. Retinoblastoma cells treated with 10(-9) mol/L of calcitriol for nine days had 15% less cell growth than the control cells. Further studies of the effect of vitamin D on retinoblastoma may warrant its inclusion in chemotherapeutic protocols for the treatment of this childhood affliction.\r"

In recent years, the antineoplastic effect of vitamin D has been established in vitro and in vivo. This study presents evidence that vitamin D2 inhibits the growth of the human retinoblastoma cell line (Y-79) grown in athymic mice. In mice treated with ergocalciferol, the subcutaneous retinoblastomas were smaller and showed increased tumor necrosis and calcification. Unfortunately, the vitamin D caused significant toxic reactions. Further studies that reduce the toxicity of vitamin D will be needed before its use in children with retinoblastomas can be advocated. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of the activity of ergocalciferol against a tumor in vivo and it suggests that ergocalciferol or one of its derivatives may be an effective chemotherapeutic agent against retinoblastomas in humans.\r"

Long term follow up data were obtained in 96 (91 men, five women; mean age 48 years) of 105 consecutive patients with single vessel coronary artery disease (greater than 70% stenosis), judged suitable for coronary angioplasty. Fifty patients had coronary bypass surgery within six months of catheterisation (surgical group) and 46 were treated medically (medical group). At entry to the study more patients in the surgical group had unstable angina, but fewer had a previous history of myocardial infarction. Ten year survival was 91% and remained excellent in all the subsets analysed. Moreover, the quality of life of these patients was good. Over the 10 year follow up, 16 (36%) of the patients treated medically and 13 (26%) in the surgical group were admitted to hospital because of cardiovascular events (including late coronary surgery in four of the patients treated medically). Lastly, 54/69 (78%) of the patients who were employed before catheterisation resumed work and 29 (42%) were still employed 10 years later. Although these data must be interpreted with care because of the limitations inherent in all retrospective studies, it appears that the long term results of conventional medical or surgical treatment are excellent in patients with single vessel coronary artery disease in whom percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty is now an option.\r"

Patients who had had a myocardial infarction in the two months before the investigation were excluded from the study. Multiple linear regression analysis showed that none of the haemostatic variables contributed independently to the prediction of an angiographic score that indicated the extent of coronary atherosclerosis. History of myocardial infarction, male sex, worsening of angina pectoris, serum triglycerides, and ejection fraction were independently associated with the angiographic score. There were some significant correlations between haemostatic variables and conventional risk factors for coronary heart disease. Thus data obtained from haemostatic analyses of peripheral venous blood do not permit the presence or the extent of atherosclerosis in coronary arteries to be predicted.\r"

  ".W": "To investigate the effect of coronary artery bypass grafting on the timing of regional left ventricular wall motion, contrast left ventriculograms from 27 patients were digitised frame by frame before and after operation. End diastolic and end systolic volumes, ejection fraction, and peak ejection and filling rates showed no significant change. The commonest preoperative abnormality was delayed onset of inward wall motion during ejection, which was present in 14 patients over 10% (range 5-40%) of the cavity outline, leading to a pattern of \"diagonal contours\". After operation this pattern had resolved completely in 12 patients and partially in two. Minor abnormalities appeared postoperatively in five but overall the mean (1SD) area affected was reduced by 5 (8)%. The time span between the onset of inward motion in different regions of the cavity also fell significantly after surgery from 190 (50) to 130 (50) ms. Regional hypokinesis (6 cases) and abnormal wall motion during isovolumic contraction (4 cases) or isovolumic relaxation (5 cases) were not consistently affected. Thus successful coronary artery surgery is without consistent effect on overall left ventricular function, overall hypokinesis, or abnormal wall motion during the isovolumic periods. It does, however, strikingly reduce the asynchrony of wall motion during ejection, suggesting that before operation this abnormality may directly reflect impaired coronary blood flow. The results emphasise the potential value of analysing regional wall motion to elucidate functional abnormalities associated with coronary artery disease.\r"

IOP was measured with a handheld applanation tonometer before anaesthesia, following administration of the induction agent, immediately after tracheal intubation and cuff inflation and 1, 2 and 3 min later. IOP in the propofol group was significantly lower than in the thiopentone group, except immediately after induction, when reduction in IOP was similar and significant with both agents. IOP following intubation in patients in whom anaesthesia was induced with thiopentone was not significantly different from baseline values, but showed a significant increase from the pressure before intubation. In contrast, IOP after intubation in the propofol group remained not only significantly less than the baseline value, but also showed only a minimal and insignificant change in comparison with values before intubation. The frequency of side effects was low in both groups except for a significantly greater reduction in arterial pressure in those receiving propofol.\r"

As HEVs with similar tannic acid staining material were also observed in peripheral lymph nodes, we suggest that this material may serve as a marker for HEVs recognized by the T8 lymphocyte subset. T8 + lymphocytes were found in the epidermis at 5 min and I h after tape-stripping of uninvolved skin of psoriatic patients with active disease, but not until 24 h in a psoriatic patient in remission. The prior existence of HEVs in uninvolved psoriatic skin could account for the rapid egress of T8 lymphocytes from the vasculature to the epidermis in response to trauma.\r"

Most of these cells had ultrastructural features which resembled those of the poorly differentiated dendritic reticulum cells described in follicular lymphomas of the lymph nodes. The immunohistochemical findings of DRC-I+, C3b r+ dendritic cells often arranged in follicular-like structures with neoplastic B cells and only few, scattered OKMI+, OKM5+ mononuclear phagocytes support the hypothesis that the vast majority of the non-lymphoid cells observed in our cases were poorly differentiated dendritic reticulum cells. These results and previously published reports indicate that the organization of the dermal infiltrate of B cell lymphomas tends to reproduce the typical arrangement of the B zone of the lymphoid tissue, although with a lesser degree of differentiation, similar to that observed in lymph node follicular lymphomas.\r"

  ".W": "The consistent occurrence of T cell abnormalities in patients with B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) suggest that the non-neoplastic host T cells may be involved in the pathogenesis of this B cell neoplasm. Because potential defects of immunoglobulin regulation are evident in B-CLL patients, we investigated one aspect of this by studying the T cell-mediated immunoglobulin isotype-specific immunoregulatory circuit in B-CLL. The existence of class-specific immunoglobulin regulatory mechanisms mediated by Fc receptor-bearing T cells (FcR + T) through soluble immunoglobulin binding factors (IgBFs) has been well established in many experimental systems. IgBFs can both suppress and enhance B cell activity in an isotype-specific manner. We investigated the apparently abnormal IgA regulation in a B-CLL patient (CLL249) whose B cells secrete primarily IgA in vitro. Enumeration of FcR + T cells showed a disproportionate increase in IgA FcR + T cells in the peripheral blood of this patient. Our studies showed that the neoplastic B cells were not intrinsically unresponsive to the suppressing component of IgABF produced from normal T cells, but rather the IgABF produced by the CLL249 host T cells was defective. CLL249 IgABF was unable to suppress IgA secretion by host or normal B cells and enhanced the in vitro proliferation of the host B cells. Size fractionation of both normal and CLL249 IgABF by gel-filtration high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) demonstrated differences in the ultraviolet-absorbing components of IgABF obtained from normal T cells v that from our patient with defective IgA regulation. Such T cell dysfunction may not be restricted to IgA regulation, since we have found similar expansion of isotype-specific FcR + T cells associated with expansion of the corresponding B cell clone in other patients with B-CLL. These data suggest that this T cell-mediated regulatory circuit could be significantly involved in the pathogenesis of B-CLL.\r"

This observation made by using monoclonal vimentin antibody V9 and a sensitive immunoperoxidase technique led to the investigation of vimentin expression in an unselected series of 73 immunohistochemically proven B cell lymphomas. While small lymphocytic lymphomas regularly expressed vimentin, the neoplastic population of mixed, small and large, and large cell lymphomas often contained various proportions of vimentin-negative tumor cells or failed to express it at all. Against the background of the Lukes-Collins classification and the Kiel classification, both defining and subdividing follicular center-cell lymphomas, there were statistically highly significant correlations between the absence of vimentin and the histology, suggesting a germinal center origin. Our data suggest that loss of vimentin expression is indicative of the transient, follicular center-cell stage of normal and malignant B lymphocytic transformation. The complete absence of vimentin within the neoplastic population of all Burkitt's lymphoma cases examined may serve as an argument for its follicular center stage of differentiation, as was asserted by Lukes and Collins.\r"

The addition of IFN or IL-2 to the NK-rich fractions resulted in a significant increase in NK activity against the autologous tumor cells. This stimulatory effect was blocked if the target hairy cells (HCs) were preincubated with either IFN or IL-2. Pretreatment of the HCs with anti-Tac antibody entirely prevented the blocking effect of IL-2 and partially the blocking effect of IFN. One patient was treated with recombinant alpha c-IFN. After 2 months there was a dramatic reduction in the number of HCs in the peripheral blood coincident with the loss of the protection effect of IFN against NK lysis of the patient's HCs. NK activity against autologous tumor cells correlated poorly with that against the K562 cell line. We conclude that there is a discordant effect of IFN and IL-2 on NK activity and HC sensitivity to lysis. The Tac receptor appears to play a role in this sensitivity. Caution should be exercised in extrapolating the effects of NK activity against K562 cells to those on HC targets.\r"

By two-color immunofluorescence staining, CD3+4-8- cells were found to be WT31-, and a small population of WT31+ cells expressed either CD4 or CD8. WT31-, CD3+ cells were also identified in a bulk culture of lymphocytes expanded in vitro. Because WT31 monoclonal antibody (MoAb) reacts with the nonpolymorphic epitope of the disulfide-linked heterodimer of the T cell antigen receptor (Ti), the absence of the WT31-reactive Ti determinant may represent an expression of different CD3-associated polypeptides. The rearrangement of the Ti-beta and Ti-gamma genes but not the immunoglobulin gene was demonstrated, and the single pattern of rearrangement indicated the monoclonal origin of the lymphocytes. When the lymphocytes were assayed for their cytotoxicity against K562, MOLT-4, Daudi, and Raji tumor cell lines, a broad spectrum of cytotoxicity for these tumor cells was observed, and the lymphocytes also exhibited antibody- and lectin-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and lymphokine-activated killer activity. Treatment with anti-CD2 and anti-CD3 MoAbs inhibited their nonspecific cytotoxicity. The anti-CD3-mediated inhibition of nonspecific cytotoxicity suggested that an as yet unidentified Ti, present in association with the CD3 molecule on these lymphocytes, serves as a specific receptor for target tumor cell recognition.\r"

  ".W": "In certain experimental tumor models, tumor growth is less pronounced in immune deficient animals. Characteristically, tumors such as the murine B16 melanoma and Lewis lung carcinoma (3LL) are weakly antigenic. We proposed that with such tumors that are weakly antigenic, growth is enhanced by T-cell factors. Young mice were inoculated with irradiated B16 cells in complete Freunds adjuvant (CFA) on three occasions, each separated by 2 weeks. Specific antibody (IgG) to B16 membrane antigens was detected by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) after the first injection, and it continued to rise for 6 weeks. B16 growth was compared in 20 mice that had received irradiated B16 in CFA or CFA alone by the same schedule previously. Despite the previous sensitization, the rates of tumor appearance and growth were similar. In an additional experiment involving 23 mice that had received B16 immunization, the period of time in which a palpable tumor developed after the injection of viable B16 cells did not correlate with anti-B16 antibody level. It appeared that detectable antibody to B16 antigens was of little consequence. To explain why B16 primary growth and metastases were reduced in immune deficient hosts, we proposed that lymphocytes might enhance tumor growth. To demonstrate this, splenic lymphocytes from tumor-bearing (B16 or 3LL) or control mice were injected with B16 cells into young, immune competent hosts. Tumors (B16) developed earlier and growth was more rapid in mice that received spleen cells from tumor-bearing (B16) mice. Subsequent cell depletion experiments to determine the mediator of tumor enhancement implicated a T-cell fraction that was neither of T-helper nor T-suppressor cell type phenotypically. Immune deficiency states that are associated with dysfunction of those cells that account for tumor enhancement might explain the reduced tumor aggressiveness that is observed frequently in these conditions.\r"

Both the extent and duration of the tachycardia were dose related. 4. Plasma noradrenaline levels were transiently increased after 10 and 25 micrograms of hCGRP. 5.

  ".W": "The relationships between portal pressure, liver function and clinical variables on one hand and development of variceal hemorrhage and death on the other were investigated in 58 men with newly diagnosed alcoholic cirrhosis. Portal pressure was determined during hepatic vein catheterization as wedged minus free hepatic vein pressure, and median pressure was 14 mm Hg (range = 3 to 26 mm Hg). Fourteen of 31 patients (45%) had esophageal varices at upper gastrointestinal endoscopy (the size being considered large in nine patients). During follow-up (median = 31 months; range = 2 to 51 months), 12 patients (21%) developed variceal hemorrhage. Applying Cox's regression analysis, information about previous variceal bleeding (p = 0.0046), large varices at endoscopy (p = 0.012), hepatic vein pressure gradient (p = 0.0056) and indocyanine green clearance (p = 0.038) all contained significant prognostic information regarding development of variceal hemorrhage, even when easily obtained variables with known prognostic information were included [modified Child-Turcotte's criteria and incapacitation index (a weighted sum of days without normal health)]. During follow-up, 17 patients (29%) died. Applying Cox's regression analysis, large varices at endoscopy (p = 0.012) and hepatic vein pressure gradient (p = 0.019) contained significant prognostic information regarding death, in addition to the information contained in the modified Child-Turcotte's criteria and incapacitation index. In conclusion, prediction of prognosis in alcoholic cirrhotic men may be significantly improved by information about size of esophageal varices and level of portal pressure.\r"

To determine whether beneficial effects of reperfusion are compromised by critical residual coronary stenosis, 14 dogs were instrumented with an external left anterior descending coronary artery balloon occluder, Doppler flow probe and adjustable screw clamp. In eight of the dogs, critical stenosis (abolition of reactive hyperemia after a 20 s occlusion; 95.7 +/- 1.0% cross-sectional area reduction) was induced before occlusion and maintained. In the control group (n = 6), no stenosis was induced. Each dog was subjected to 2 h of myocardial ischemia followed by balloon deflation and 24 h of reperfusion. Myocardial blood flow assessed with microspheres was similar during balloon inflation in both groups and indicative of profound ischemia. Transmural blood flow to the reperfused zone assessed 1 min after balloon deflation was significantly greater in control dogs without residual stenosis (383% of normal compared with 120% of normal in dogs with stenosis) (p less than 0.01). Compromise of transmural flow persisted in dogs with stenosis (85% compared with 121% of normal in control dogs after 1 h, p less than 0.05; and 49% compared with 68% after 24 h of reperfusion, p less than 0.05). Diminution of subendocardial blood flow after reperfusion was particularly marked. The extent of infarction was greater in the heart of dogs with residual stenosis. Thus, residual critical coronary stenosis compromises nutritional perfusion and salvage of reperfused myocardium after recanalization. These observations underscore the need for prompt identification of patients with high grade residual stenosis early after coronary thrombolysis and the potential value of angioplasty or coronary surgery in selected patients soon after initial recanalization.\r"

  ".W": "The clinical significance of myocardial perfusion defects present early after angiographically successful percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty was assessed in 53 patients using thallium-201 single photon emission computed tomography combined with pharmacologic vasodilation induced by a large dose (300 mg) of orally administered dipyridamole. Myocardial tomographic images were obtained at a mean of 20 +/- 6 h (SD) before and 2.9 +/- 2.7 days after angioplasty. Before angioplasty, 15 (28%) of the 53 patients developed angina after dipyridamole administration, in contrast to only 3 (7.5%) of 40 patients after angioplasty (p less than 0.001). The mean percent luminal area stenosis decreased from 93 +/- 6% before angioplasty to 34 +/- 17% after angioplasty (p less than 0.001). Myocardial perfusion defects, present in 49 (93%) of the 53 patients before angioplasty, were reversible in 44 patients (83%), all of whom underwent dilation of arteries supplying the ischemic areas. After angioplasty, 26 (65%) of 40 patients had no ischemic defects, whereas 14 (35%) of the patients still had an ischemic defect in the vascular territory of the dilated artery. After a mean follow-up period of 21.7 months, 13 (33%) of 39 patients developed restenosis, 10 of whom had an ischemic defect early after angioplasty. Restenosis developed in 10 (71%) of 14 patients with an ischemic defect after angioplasty, but in only 3 (11.5%) of the patients without an ischemic defect (p = 0.007). In conclusion, thallium-201 tomography after oral dipyridamole affords convenient assessment of the physiologic significance of coronary stenosis present before angioplasty and the residual stenosis after angioplasty.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The reperfusion catheter is a 4.3F catheter with 30 holes over its distal 10 cm. It is used to maintain coronary blood flow in patients awaiting emergency coronary bypass surgery after failed coronary angioplasty. The insertion of the reperfusion catheter was attempted in 20 patients (14 with total occlusion and 6 with severe residual stenosis judged to be in jeopardy of reclosure before operation). The reperfusion catheter was successfully placed across the obstruction in 18 patients (90%). After successful insertion of the reperfusion catheter, 16 patients had good anterograde flow (Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infaction [TIMI] trial grade II or III); angiographic improvement was associated with significant lessening of ST segment elevation as well as a decrease in chest pain in most patients. Two patients had poor or absent anterograde flow (TIMI grade O or I) because of extensive preexisting intracoronary thrombosis; one died from refractory ventricular fibrillation. In each of the remaining patients emergency coronary bypass surgery was performed with no deaths or significant cardiac complications. The reperfusion catheter is a safe and effective method to reestablish and maintain coronary blood flow before coronary bypass surgery after failed coronary angioplasty. Because there is the potential risk of serious complications, particularly thrombus formation within this catheter, the reperfusion catheter should be used cautiously and the patient should undergo immediate bypass surgery.\r"

Antigen stimulation may also result in polyclonal B cell activation, but it is not known if RF production is a feature of this response. Therefore, peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 36 healthy volunteers previously immunized to tetanus toxoid (TT) were stimulated in vitro for 9 days with a conventional antigen, TT, or pokeweed mitogen, a standard polyclonal B cell activator. Culture supernatants were analyzed for total IgG, total IgM, and IgM RF by ELISA. TT-induced IgM RF production was observed in 10/36 experiments compared to 18/36 experiments in which cells were cultured with pokeweed mitogen, with a similar magnitude of response to these respective stimulants. The in vitro IgM-RF response to TT did not require a recent in vivo TT booster immunization and was observed at an antigen does that elicits polyclonal B cell activation but not IgG specific anti-TT antibody. TT-induced IgM RF responder cultures demonstrated higher levels of total IgG and total IgM production than cultures not secreting IgM RF in response to TT. These results indicate that IgM RF production is a concomitant of the polyclonal B cell response elicited by a conventional antigen. Unlike other model systems, this antigen-induced RF response was not mediated by the action of IgG antibody containing immune complexes.\r"

Each polyp was endoscopically bathed in saline which was then aspirated back into a syringe through a catheter and tested for presence of blood on a Hemoccult II slide. Forty-nine polyps were excised. We found the following: 1) A relatively small proportion of adenomas (approximately 11%) have a propensity to bleed. 2) Approximately 22% of polyp-bearing patients have a bleeding adenoma. 3) Risk factors for bleeding include polyp size greater than 1.0 cm, presence of a stalk, and cherry-red color; associated histopathological findings include marked vascular congestion and intramucosal lakes of blood. 4) Clinically detectable bleeding occurs after intramucosal hemorrhage in the polyp head and dissection of blood into the bowel lumen through the glandular or surface epithelium. Most polyps are small, sessile and pink, without histopathological features of hemorrhage and are unlikely to bleed. Therefore, patients with Hemoccult-positive stools in whom such neoplasms are found should undergo further study to detect other causes of gastrointestinal blood loss. High-risk polyps in otherwise asymptomatic patients can be held responsible for bleeding; in them colonoscopic polypectomy with follow-up Hemoccult testing is sufficient management. Only if bleeding persists is study of other parts of the gut essential.\r"

  ".U": "88187350\r", 
  ".W": "It has been previously reported that Ia Ag on APC seems to be involved in Ag-specific T cell activation in at least two different ways: one is to associate with foreign Ag to form a neoantigenic determinant (the Ag-specific Ia function), and the second is to interact with T cells in a non-Ag-specific manner. Both Ia functions are required for T cell activation. In the present study we examined whether the T cell structures responsible for the non-Ag-specific Ia interaction were separable from the Ag-specific alpha/beta TCR. Purified protein derivative of tuberculin (PPD)-specific murine hybridoma T cells and polyclonal lymph node T cells were stimulated for IL-2 production by APC pulsed with PPD, glutaraldehyde fixed, and anti-Ia antibody treated, to provide the antigenic PPD/Ia determinant, in the presence of glutaraldehyde-fixed non-Ag-pulsed APC, to provide the non-Ag-specific Ia interactions. However, in several different approaches the T cell structures or activation signals responsible for the Ag-specific recognition and non-Ag-specific Ia interactions seemed to be associated with each other in this experimental system. First, the Ag-specific and non-Ag-specific Ia interactions with T cells were both required simultaneously to initiate T cell activation, and it was not possible to activate T cells by providing either Ia signal subsequent to the other. Second, the T cell structures responsible for the non-Ag-specific Ia interactions appeared to be clonally distributed in PPD-specific lymph node T cells. Third, another T cell hybridoma specific for bovine insulin also showed dual Ia interactions, but the specificity of the non-Ag-specific Ia function was different than that for the PPD-specific T cell response. Fourth, all subclones of PPD-specific T hybridomas that had lost Ag-specific responsiveness also lost functional non-Ag-specific Ia interactions. Taken together, these observations suggest that a single species of TCR may mediate both the Ag-specific and non-Ag-specific Ia interactions. In addition, the non-Ag-specific Ia interaction with T cells augmented the Ag-specific Ia interaction for T cell activation, indicating that both types of interactions may be involved in some T cell responses. Based on these observations, a Velcromodel depicting the synergy between the two Ia functions is proposed in which a matrix of interactions consisting of higher affinity Ag binding and lower affinity Ia-TCR associations provides cooperative sets of signals necessary for cellular activation.\r"

Surrogate receptor molecules are attached to the membranes by insertion of the palmitate hydrocarbon chains into the phospholipid bilayer. This mode of attachment precludes interactions between surrogate receptors and intracellular and intramembranous structures. Despite these limitations, surrogate receptors consisting of either palmitate-derivatized intact antibody molecules or their corresponding F(ab')2 fragments specific for Ag on syngeneic B lymphocytes or hapten-modified EL-4 lymphoma cells can direct cell-mediated cytotoxic activity against the appropriate target. Treatment of the surrogate receptor-decorated effector cell populations with anti-asialo GM1 plus C eliminated the observed target cell lysis, suggesting a role for NK cells in this cytolytic process. The efficiency of this surrogate receptor-mediated cellular cytotoxicity parallels that of natural receptor-mediated target cell lysis and is not limited by inherent resistance of a target cell to NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Application of this technology to study the requirements for productive lytic interactions between effector and target cells may provide valuable insights into the mechanism of cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Furthermore, these results provide the rationale for future studies designed to evaluate the ability of surrogate receptors to focus cytotoxic cell activity onto a specified target in situ, in an attempted elimination of diseased cells.\r"

Fresh peripheral blood from this individual was comprised of 80% lymphocytes, 65 to 75% of which were CD3+, CD8+, Leu-7+ LGL. Of these LGL, 72% initially expressed the TCR-alpha beta heterodimer, whereas 21% did not. Cytotoxicity directed against MHC-unrestricted targets was minimal. After several days of exposure to rIL-2, cytotoxic activity was greatly enhanced, correlating with a disappearance of CD3+ cells expressing the alpha beta heterodimer. Twelve days after rIL-2 exposure, the LGL expressed only TCR-gamma delta heterodimer in association with CD3 and alpha beta heterodimer expression could no longer be detected. The TCR/CD3 complex on these cells was demonstrated to be functional as anti-CD3 elicited an increase in cytoplasmic free calcium concentration, stimulated cytolytic activity, and stimulated granule enzyme secretion from the LGL.\r"

Many of the hybridomas constitutively produced glycosylation enhancing factor (GEF), which could switch the T cell hybridoma 23A4 cells from the formation of IgE-suppressive factors to the formation of IgE-potentiating factors. When one of the hybridoma clones, 12H5, was incubated with OVA-pulsed syngeneic or semi-syngeneic (H-2b) macrophages, the hybridoma produced GEF that have affinity for OVA, but not for either keyhole limpet hemocyanin or BSA. However, the same hybridoma constitutively produced nonspecific GEF, that lacked affinity for OVA. Upon incubation with OVA-pulsed macrophages, the same hybridoma produced both IgE-potentiating factors and IgG-potentiating factors which selectively enhance the IgE response and IgG response, respectively. Both Ag-specific GEF and nonspecific GEF from the hybridoma bind to p-aminobenzamidine-agarose, and are recovered by elution with benzamidine. It was also found that both OVA-specific GEF and nonspecific GEF from the hybridoma induced the release of arachidonic acid from phospholipids of mouse fibrosarcoma cell line, HSDM1C1 cells. GEF formed by the 12H5 hybridoma bound to alloantibodies reactive to the product(s) of the I-Ab subregion of major histocompatibility complex. The Ag-specific GEF consisted of two Mr species, of 70 to 90 kDa and 50 to 60 kDa, whereas nonspecific GEF consisted of 50 to 60 kDa and 25 to 30 kDa molecules. Reduction and alkylation treatment of the OVA-specific GEF resulted in the formation of nonspecific GEF, suggesting that Ag-specific GEF is composed of Ag-binding polypeptide chain and nonspecific GEF.\r"

  ".W": "Flow microfluorometry was used to examine the effect of dexamethasone on the expression of surface Ia (sIa) on resting and activated murine B cells. Although dexamethasone resulted in a 50% reduction in sIa expression 12 h after injection, it was significantly less suppressive when injected together with B cell activators. In vitro dexamethasone, but not other related steroid hormones, induced a population of cells that were sIg+sIa-. A 20% reduction in the expression of sIa was noted by 4 h of culture with 10 nM dexamethasone, but maximal inhibition of 70% was not reached until 12 h of culture, and this degree of suppression persisted as long as dexamethasone remained in culture. When the dexamethasone was washed out after 8 h of culture, the maximal reduction was still noted at 12 h, but by 24 h there was re-expression of sIa toward base line levels, indicating it did not induce irreversible lethal alterations in the B cell. The inhibition of sIa expression correlated with a specific reduction in the quantity of messenger RNA for sIa as measured by Northern blot analysis, indicating that this is mediated at least in part by suppression of the steady state levels of Ia mRNA. The corticosteroid receptor antagonist RU486 was able to reverse the suppressive effects of dexamethasone on sIa expression, thus demonstrating that its effect is mediated specifically by binding to its intracellular receptor. Furthermore, when protein synthesis was inhibited during the short period of time that cells were preincubated with dexamethasone, minimal suppression of Ia expression was noted, suggesting that the dexamethasone may be stimulating a protein that has suppressive effects on MHC class II expression. The suppressive effects of dexamethasone in vitro were substantially reduced when B cells were simultaneously activated by stimuli that increase the expression of sIa. These data indicate that the suppressive effects of corticosteroids on immune response Ag are corticosteroid specific; are greater in resting than in activated B cells; are induced via the classical steroid mechanism of action, which is receptor mediated; and may result from the induction of an inhibitory protein that suppresses Ia mRNA.\r"

We used untreated and IFN-pretreated keratinocytes as stimulators and also as targets to study whether IFN-induced MHC Ag changes would alter the immunogenicity of keratinocytes in alloimmune responses. It was found that class II MHC Ag-carrying keratinocytes were unable to induce the proliferation of resting lymphocytes, but did stimulate T blasts. Untreated keratinocytes were virtually resistant to the lysis by classical CTL but became susceptible after exposure to IFN-gamma, but not IFN-alpha 2 at physiologic doses. These data demonstrate mechanisms by which the release of IFN-gamma might contribute to the development of disease such as the graft vs host disease.\r"

Adoptively transferred Ts line cells were found to downgrade experimental autoimmune uveoretinitis in actively immunized syngeneic recipients. The initial surface phenotype (OX8+) of the Ts line was unstable in vitro, however, the cells expressed suppressor function irrespective of phenotype. The mechanism of suppression did not appear to involve consumption of IL-2 or direct cytolysis of uveitogenic Th lymphocytes, but rather the production of a soluble suppressor factor. These findings may suggest an in vivo role for suppressor lymphocytes, capable of inhibiting primed Th cells, in the regulation of experimental autoimmune uveoretinitis.\r"

  ".W": "The i.v. injection of parental T cells into F1 hybrid mice can result in a graft-vs-host (GVH)-induced immune deficiency that is Ag nonspecific and of long duration. The effect of the GVH reaction (GVHR) on the host's immune system depends on the class of F1 MHC Ag recognized by the donor cells. To determine the role of different subsets of donor-derived T cells in the induction of GVHR, donor spleen cells were negatively selected by anti-T cell mAb and C, and the cells were injected into F1 mice that differed from the donor by both class I and II MHC Ag or by class I or class II MHC only. The induction of GVHR across class I + II differences was found to require both L3T4+ and Lyt-2+ parental cells. Induction of GVHR across a class II difference required only L3T4+ parental T cells in the combination tested [B6-into-(B6 x bm12)F1]. In contrast, B6 Lyt-2+ cells were sufficient to induce GVHR across a class I difference in (B6 x bm1)F1 recipients. In addition, a direct correlation was observed between the cell types required for GVH induction and the parental T cell phenotypes detected in the spleens of the GVH mice. The number of parental cells detected in the unirradiated F1 hosts was dependent upon the H-2 differences involved in the GVHR. Induction of a class I + class II GVHR resulted in abrogation of both TNP-self and allogeneic CTL responses. In contrast, induction of a class II GVHR resulted in only a selective loss of TNP-self but not of allogeneic CTL function. Unexpectedly, the induction of a class I GVHR also resulted in the selective loss of the TNP-self CTL response. Thus, these class I and class II examples of GVH both result in the selective abrogation of L3T4+ Th cell function. The data are discussed in terms of respective roles of killer cells and/or suppressor cells in the induction of host immune deficiency by a GVHR, and of the selective deficiency in host Th cell function induced by different classes of GVHR.\r"

A mAb directed against the central portion of HIV-1 glycoprotein gp110 was chemically cross-linked to a mAb directed against the CD3/TCR complex or to a mAb directed against the CD16 Fc gamma-R expressed on large granular lymphocytes (LGL). HIV-1-infected cells, but not uninfected cells, were found to be lysed to a greater extent by PBL in the presence of the gp110 X CD3 or the gp110 X CD16 antibody heteroconjugate than in the presence of the single antibodies or a mixture of the mAb comprising the heteroconjugates. Pretreatment of PBL with anti-CD3 or IL-2 augments their ability to lyse HIV-1-infected cells in the presence of the heteroconjugates. Lysis by anti-CD3-activated PBL in the presence of the gp110 X CD3 heteroconjugate was found to be mediated by CD8+-enriched T cells, whereas lysis by IL-2-treated PBL in the presence of the gp110 X CD16 heteroconjugate is mediated by PBL enriched for CD16+ cells, which are primarily LGL. Furthermore, PBL from asymptomatic, HIV-1-infected seropositive donors were found to be functional in lysing HIV-1-infected cells in the presence of the antibody heteroconjugates. Such antibody heteroconjugates, which can target T cells or LGL to lyse HIV-1-infected cells, may be of prophylactic or therapeutic value in HIV-1-infected individuals.\r"

This report investigates the effect of human platelet purified TGF-beta on CSF-1-induced proliferation in liquid cultures. We used two cell types to study TGF-beta effects, bone marrow precursors and a c-myc partially transformed CSF-1-dependent macrophage cell line designated BMM-8. We found that CSF-1-dependent proliferation of both cell types was strongly inhibited by TGF-beta in a dose-dependent manner. Approximately 1.6 and 8 pM TGF-beta inhibited 50% of CSF-1 proliferation of the bone marrow precursors and BMM-8, respectively. Inhibition appeared to be reversible, as bone marrow and BMM-8 cells proliferated in response to CSF-1 after preincubation of the cells in TGF-beta. Interestingly, inhibition of hematopoietic cells was observed only after a lag period of 24 to 48 h after onset of cultures. TGF-beta inhibition was partially diminished when increasing amounts of CSF-1 were added to the cultures. TGF-beta inhibition did not involve secondary inhibitory factors such as IFN or PG, both of which have been previously shown to suppress CSF responsiveness. Finally, flow cytometric analysis of the cell cycle indicated that within 48 h, TGF-beta-treated BMM-8 cells were prevented from entering S phase. These results suggest that TGF-beta may play an important role in the negative regulation of macrophage production.\r"

  ".W": "Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF beta) regulates cell growth and differentiation in numerous cell systems, including several hematopoietic lineages. We used in vitro cultures of highly enriched hematopoietic progenitor cells stimulated by natural and recombinant growth factors to investigate the biologic effects of TGF beta 1 and TGF beta 2 on erythroid (CFU-E and burst-forming unit (BFU)-E), granulocyte-macrophage (CFU-GM) and multilineage (i.e., granulocyte, erythroid, macrophage, and megakaryocyte; CFU-GEMM) colony-forming cells. In the absence of exogenous CSF, neither TGF beta 1 nor TGF beta 2 supported progenitor cell growth. In the presence of recombinant or natural CSF, picomolar concentrations of TGF beta 1 inhibited growth of CFU-E, BFU-E, and CFU-GEMM and enhanced growth of day 7 CFU-GM. Inhibition of CFU-E and BFU-E by human and porcine TGF beta 1 was similar, ranging from 17 to 73% over a concentration range of 0.05 to 1.0 ng/ml, and was largely independent of the type of burst-promoting activity used (rIL-3 vs cell line 5637-conditioned medium). Inhibition of CFU-GEMM ranged from 79 to 98% over a concentration range of 0.25 to 1.0 ng/ml. The inhibitory effect of TGF beta 1 was progressively lost when its addition was delayed for 40 to 120 h, suggesting a mode of action during early cell divisions. In contrast, growth of CFU-GM stimulated by plateau concentrations of human rG-CSF, rGM-CSF, and rIL-3 was enhanced up to 154 +/- 22% by human TGF beta 1. Porcine platelet-derived TGF beta 2 was essentially without effect on the progenitor populations examined. These results support the hypothesis that TGF beta may play role in the regulation of hematopoietic progenitor cell proliferation by differentially affecting individual lineages and is apparently capable of doing so in the relative absence of marrow accessory cells.\r"

Twofold increases in cGMP but not cAMP were measured after 5 to 20 min with 100 U/ml GM-CSF. Guanylate cyclase activities in membrane and cytosol fractions were increased to the same extent whether measured in the presence of Mg2+ or Mn2+, or in the cytosol with Mg2+ + N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitroso-guanidine. Kinetic studies of the cytosol enzyme showed no changes in the Km values for Mg2+ and Mn2+dependent guanylate cyclase activities (0.91 and 0.022 mM, respectively), whereas Vm values were increased after treating intact cells with GM-CSF. Two peaks of guanylate cyclase activity were observed, one at 10 and another at 60 min after adding 100 U/ml GM-CSF, whereas only one peak at 5 min occurred with 1 U/ml. Adenylate cyclase activity was reduced by nearly 50% after adding 100 U/ml GM-CSF for 10 to 30 min. These effects were also seen in the presence of several hormonal and nonhormonal adenylate cyclase stimulators. In contrast, small increases in adenylate cyclase activity occurred after adding 1 U/ml GM-CSF. In experiments to examine the pathway of guanylate cyclase activation by GM-CSF, we observed no changes in inositol phosphates, intracellular calcium ion, or cytosolic protein kinase C. The augmentation of chemotactic peptide-induced superoxide production by GM-CSF concentrations, may be related to the effects of the higher levels of GM-CSF to stimulate late increases in guanylate cyclase or decreases in adenylate cyclase.\r"

We have studied the functional role of PKC in lytic signal transduction by correlating the phosphorylation of a set of CTL membrane proteins bound by the lectin Con A with lytic function in CTL clones. The data obtained indicate that the phosphorylation of a 15- to 17-kDa polypeptide in this subset is associated with the translocation of PKC to the membrane and the stimulation of lytic function. This suggests that the 15- to 17-kDa protein may be a physiologically relevant substrate for PKC translocated to the membrane as a result of Ag-specific perturbation of the CTL-R.\r"

PBMC from the patients produced significantly lower levels of IL-2 and had reduced proliferative response to PHA at the time of disease diagnosis compared with healthy controls. Their ability to produce IL-1 in response to LPS was, however, unaltered. The patients also showed normal levels of OKT4+ and IL-2R+ cells in the peripheral blood, as judged by specific immunofluorescence staining. All patients were given antimony therapy, and five were cured. The recovered patients showed significant improvement in the IL-2 producing capacity of their PBMC. The PBMC preparations of patients and controls were cryopreserved before and after successful chemotherapy on the patients. The frozen cell preparations were thawed and viable autologous cells cocultured with equal numbers of PBMC from patients before and after chemotherapy. The frozen cells from five healthy controls showed little or no difference whether they were cultured together or separately. In contrast, coculturing of cells from the five recovered patients with autologous pretreatment cells produced significantly and consistently lower levels of IL-2 compared with those produced when the cells were cultured separately. These results therefore demonstrate that the PBMC from patients with visceral leishmaniasis contain a population of cells that are capable of suppressing the IL-2 production by autologous PBMC from recovered patients. The method of cryopreservation should be useful for studying the immune regulation in this and other clinical diseases in vitro.\r"

  ".W": "An unexplained feature of the human T lymphoblastic leukemia cell line, CEM, is a heterogeneous expression of surface membrane T3-TCR complex. CEM cells constitutively maintain two distinct populations whereby a minority of cells (5 to 16%) express T3 but the remainder do not. From the parental cell line, we have derived stable subclones in which all cells express surface T3 and companion subclones that lack surface T3. Inasmuch as surface T3 expression is contingent on assembly and coexpression of the multichain T3 protein complex with the TCR, we compared the surface T3+ and T3- subclones for their rearrangement and expression of genes of the T3-TCR complex. Restricted DNA of both subclone types showed the identical monoclonal pattern of TCR gene rearrangement seen in the mosaic parental CEM line. Northern blot analysis revealed mRNA transcripts of TCR beta subunit and T3 delta in both the surface T3+ and T3- subclones. However, surface T3+ subclones transcribed abundant full length (1.5-kb) TCR alpha mRNA in contrast to the surface T3- subclones in which TCR alpha transcripts were undetectable. Lack of TCR alpha gene transcription was not attributable to either unrearranged or aberrantly rearranged TCR alpha genes because exposure of surface T3- cells to phorbol ester induced a rapid (15-min) and progressive accumulation of full length (1.5-kb) TCR alpha mRNA. This was followed by surface membrane T3 expression in 24 to 72 h. We conclude that the unusual phenotypic mosaicism of CEM cells is attributable to a reversible lack of transcription of the TCR alpha gene.\r"

  ".W": "We have previously reported on the augmentation of monoclonal anti-Id antibodies by IL-2 in the therapy of a murine B cell lymphoma. The mechanism of this augmentation was through the expansion by IL-2 of effector cells mediating antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. In this paper we explore the power of IL-2 to enhance anti-Id therapy on larger tumor burdens and at sites distant from the site of injection. The combination treatment was able to induce regression of established 1-cm s.c. tumors associated with microscopic metastatic tumor in lungs, liver, and spleen. Further studies into the mechanism of activity showed that IL-2 was unable to augment in vivo or in vitro tumor lysis by F(ab')2 fragments, thus emphasizing the importance of Fc interactions with antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity effector cells. FcR-bearing NK cells were increased in the peritoneum of IL-2-treated mice. The augmented therapeutic effect by the combination treatment was specific for tumor cells expressing the target Id, and non-specific cytotoxicity on Id-negative variants was not seen.\r"

  ".W": "The developmental relationships among large agranular lymphocytes (LAL) large granular lymphocytes (LGL) and the activation of these cells into lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells by rIL-2 was investigated. Highly enriched populations of LAL were isolated from Fischer 344 spleen cells by a combination of nylon-wool filtration (to remove B cells and macrophages), treatment with a pan T cell antibody plus complement (to remove T cells) and incubation in L-leucine methyl ester (to remove LGL). The resultant cells were highly enriched in morphologically identifiable LAL which expressed asialo GM1 and partially expressed the OX8 surface marker. The enriched LAL did not contain detectable NK cytotoxic activity, did not express pan T cell (OX19), Ia, Ig, or laminin surface markers and contained less than 0.2% LGL. Incubation of LAL in a low dose of rIL-2 (100 U/ml) induced the generation of LGL having NK activity within 24 h of culture. Longer culture periods (48 h) resulted in a continued increase in the percentage of LGL and higher levels of NK activity. However, with this low dose of rIL-2, little or no LAK activity (i.e., reactivity against NK-resistant target cells) was generated. With a high dose of rIL-2 (500 U/ml), LAL responded by first generating LGL with NK activity (within 24 h), with subsequent generation of LAK activity by 48 h. Evidence that the development of granular lymphocytes from LAL was responsible first for NK activity and then LAK activity was demonstrated by depletion of the generated granular NK or LAK effector cells by second treatments with L-leucine methyl ester. Concomitant with the induction of LGL with NK or LAK activity, rIL-2 also caused LGL to proliferate and expand four- to five-fold in 48 h. This occurred in the presence of high or low dose rIL-2. These results indicate that LAL are the precursors of LGL/NK cells, that LAL, LGL/NK cells and LAK cells appear to represent sequential developmental or activation stages and that LAL may comprise major source of LAK progenitors in lymphoid populations having few LGL or mature active NK cells.\r"

  ".W": "We added high-dose oral leucovorin to the combination of cisplatin and fluorouracil (5-FU) to assess the efficacy of this regimen in the treatment of patients with head and neck cancer. Cisplatin, 100 mg/m2, was followed by a 5-FU continuous infusion at 600 mg/m2/d for five days. Leucovorin, 50 mg/m2, was administered at the start of cisplatin and every six hours throughout the duration of the 5-FU infusion. The dose of 5-FU was escalated to 800 mg/m2 and 1,000 mg/m2 according to observed toxicity. In a second phase of the study, the dose of leucovorin was escalated to 50 mg/m2 every four hours. A total of 25 patients were registered: 23 had recurrent disease after extensive prior treatment; and two had newly diagnosed metastatic disease. The maximally tolerated dose of 5-FU was 800 mg/m2/d with leucovorin administered every six hours. Toxicities at that level included mild to moderate myelosuppression and dose-limiting mucositis in the previously irradiated field. Identical toxicities were observed when administering 800 mg/m2/d of 5-FU with leucovorin every four hours. Eighteen patients were evaluated for response: one had a pathologic complete response; nine had a partial response (including four who received prior cisplatin and 5-FU as induction chemotherapy); and eight patients failed to respond. The mean peak and trough plasma leucovorin concentrations were 2.61 (+/- 1.07) mumol/L and 2.46 (+/- 0.95) mumol/L with administration of the drug every six hours, and 2.75 (+/- 2.15) mumol/L and 2.52 (+/- 1.48) mumol/L with administration every four hours. We conclude that the combination of cisplatin, 5-FU, and leucovorin has activity in the treatment of recurrent head and neck cancer. The maximally tolerated dose of 5-FU in this study was 800 mg/m2/d, with mucositis in previously irradiated sites being dose-limiting. Plasma leucovorin concentrations exceeding 1 mumol/L are achieved following oral administration of this drug.\r"

We have conducted a phase I to II clinical trial using four biweekly courses of HDMTX (8 g/m2) in a neoadjuvant setting in ten patients with newly diagnosed high-risk pediatric primary brain tumors. Four patients experienced an objective response after two to four courses of HDMTX alone (medulloblastoma, one; pineoblastoma, one; malignant cerebral astrocytoma, two). All ten patients subsequently received a course of therapeutic RT, and in seven cases, adjuvant chemotherapy with other agents. One patient acquired an acute transient encephalopathy before RT that completely resolved, and another developed a seizure disorder following RT associated with white matter abnormalities on a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. Five patients have survived a minimum of 33+ months, and four remain in continuous remission. The acute and delayed neurotoxicity of neoadjuvant HDMTX is acceptable, and we favor further use of this neoadjuvant approach in the context of a phase III trial.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of dose and duration of infusion of recombinant interleukin-2 (IL-2) on toxicity and immunomodulation. In a phase I/II study, IL-2 was administered intravenously (IV) daily for five consecutive days every other week for 4 weeks of treatment to 23 patients with progressive melanoma, renal, colon, or ovarian cancer by one of four regimens: groups I and II received 3 X 10(5) U/m2/d by two-hour or 24-hour infusion, respectively; groups III and IV received 3 X 10(6) U/m2/d by two-hour or 24-hour infusion, respectively. In a subsequent study, six patients (group V) received a single priming cycle of daily IL-2 for five days at 3 X 10(6) U/m2/d in divided 15-minute infusions every eight hours, before undergoing leukapheresis for lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cell generation. Toxicity was mild with 3 X 10(5) U/m2/d, but severe chills and fever, moderate hypotension (not requiring IV pressors), and weight gain were observed with 3 X 10(6) U/m2/d. Toxicity was also related to the duration of infusion. In group IV (continuous infusion), fluid retention, weight gain, and azotemia were more frequent and severe than in groups III or V, in which the same total dose was administered by two-hour infusion or in three divided 15-minute infusions. IL-2 induced rebound lymphocytosis, which was directly dose-related and significantly higher in group IV (continuous infusion) than in groups III or V. Dramatic increases in the percentage and absolute number of cells expressing the IL-2 receptor were also most pronounced in group IV. With the higher dose of IL-2, LAK cells appeared in the circulation, and natural killer (NK) cytotoxicity was augmented. The results showed that the toxicity and immunomodulation by IL-2 are dose-dependent and are maximal by continuous infusion compared with two-hour or divided every eight hours infusions.\r"

In canine basilar arteries, endothelium removal elevated the dose-response curves to 5-HT, PGF2 alpha, and PGD2, and PGE2, but not to KCl, hemoglobin, or NE. In rabbit basilar arteries, on the other hand, removal of the endothelium elevated the dose-response curves to 5-HT, NE, PGF2 alpha, and PGD2, but not to KCl or hemoglobin. Neither contractile nor inhibitory response was elicited by PGE2 in rabbit basilar arteries. Contraction induced by 5-HT and NE following endothelium removal had a much more pronounced effect in rabbit basilar arteries than in canine basilar arteries. These results suggest that, following endothelium removal, abolition of the spontaneous release of endothelium-derived relaxing factor is the most probable mechanism of the enhanced vasocontraction. Since endothelial damage results from subarachnoid hemorrhage, the aforementioned mechanism of vasocontraction enhancement may play a role in the pathogenesis of cerebral vasospasm.\r"

This report examines the efficacy of intrathecal immunotoxin therapy for the treatment of tumors of the cerebrospinal fluid compartment. A syngeneic animal model of leptomeningeal neoplasia was developed in which percutaneous inoculation of L2C tumor cells into the cisterna magna of Strain 2 guinea pigs produced disseminated leptomeningeal and intraventricular leukemia and death. Percutaneous intracisternal injection of 2 micrograms of an anti-idiotype monoclonal antibody (M6)-intact ricin immunotoxin 24 hours following intracisternal inoculation of 10(5) L2C cells (10,000 times the lethal dose) produced prolonged survival (p less than 0.005) of tumor-bearing animals. The immunotoxin therapy caused no detectable toxicity. Intracisternal injection of either M6 monoclonal antibody alone or a nonspecific control immunotoxin had no therapeutic effect. The observed extension of survival times in immunotoxin-treated animals corresponds to a median 2- to 3-log (99% to 99.9%) and, in some animals, possibly a 5-log (99.999%) or greater kill of tumor cells. These results support a possible role for immunotoxins in the clinical treatment of central nervous system neoplastic disease involving compartments (intrathecal, intraventricular, or cystic tumor).\r"

Urine was assayed for TGF's by soft agar colony formation and iodine-125 (125I)-epidermal growth factor (EGF)-binding competition. Two nontransformed cell lines, clonal NRK49F and BALB/3T3 A31-1-1 cells, were used as indicator cells for the soft agar colony assay, while EGF receptor-rich A431 cells were used for 125I-EGF-binding competition assay. Urine samples were dialyzed against acetic acid, then lyophilized, prepared with gel-permeation chromatography, and assayed. All 19 patients and a control group of healthy individuals showed high levels of alpha-type TGF's with low molecular weight (4 to 8 kD) in all urine samples. In addition, alpha-type TGF's of high molecular weight (20 to 50 kD) were detected at high levels in urine from all 10 patients with high-grade astrocytoma; at intermediate levels in urine from one of two patients with low-grade astrocytoma and from two of four patients with meningioma; and at low levels in urine from one of two patients with low-grade astrocytoma, from two of four patients with meningioma, from one patient with oligodendroglioma, from two patients with neurinoma, and from all healthy control individuals. The high level of alpha-type TGF's with high molecular weight detected in urine from patients with high-grade astrocytoma could be useful as a tumor marker.\r"

In the present experiments, the therapeutic value of an applied DC field was studied in 40 rats with clip compression injuries of the cord at C7-T1. The rats were randomly allocated to one of four groups including 10 rats each: two groups received a 17-gm cord injury and two groups a 53-gm injury. One group at each injury severity received implantation of a treatment (14 microA) DC stimulator and the other group a control (0 microA) stimulator. Clinical neurological function was assessed weekly by the inclined-plane technique. At 8 weeks after injury, motor and somatosensory evoked potentials (MEP's and SSEP's) were recorded, and the axonal tracer horseradish peroxidase (HRP) was introduced into the cord at T-6. The total number of HRP-labeled cells was counted in every sixth coronal section through the brain stem and motor cortex. All outcome parameters were assessed blindly. In the 17-gm group, there were no significant differences in any outcome measure between control and treated rats. In contrast, in the 53-gm group, the inclined-plane scores, the amplitude of the MEP's, and the number of labeled cells in the red nucleus, raphe nuclei, and vestibular nuclei were greater in treated than in control rats. These data strongly indicate that an applied DC field can produce functional neurological and anatomical improvement in rats with acute spinal cord injuries.\r"

Both the T-cell and B-cell populations remained after multiple passages of the tumors in syngeneic mice. A multiparameter approach combining immunologic and molecular genetic techniques was taken to determine the malignant cell population within these lymphomas. This analysis included depletion experiments utilizing histocompatible (B10.A X 21M)F1 mice to distinguish normal host-derived cells from the malignant tumor cells, fluorescence-activated cell sorting of the two cell populations followed by in vivo growth of the sorted cells, in vitro and in vivo cloning attempts, and molecular analysis of genomic DNA derived from the splenic tumors for clonal rearrangements of the immunoglobulin heavy-chain and T-cell receptor loci. Each of the three lymphomas was shown to be a malignant B-cell tumor that has an associated nonneoplastic T-cell component. The nature and functional significance of the numerous T-cells present in the B-cell lymphomas remain unknown and are being investigated.\r"

In 54% of the patients studied, support staff were found to have added or deleted one or more tests from the original written orders. When the ordering physicians were asked to identify the clinical indications for the tests they had ordered, 37% of their orders either lacked an appropriate test or included an unnecessary test request. In contrast, after clerical and laboratory staff had changed orders, only 25% of patients had inappropriate tests performed or necessary tests omitted. Clerical staff using computer-based ordering menus significantly improved the appropriateness of physicians' orders compared with clerks who lacked such guidance. Laboratory technologists who used informal, knowledge-based rules also tended to improve the appropriateness of physicians' orders. We conclude that a substantial proportion of physicians' orders for diagnostic tests may be modified during the test requisitioning process. The use of testing regimens by ward clerks and laboratory technologists may explain their ability to improve on physicians' orders.\r"
