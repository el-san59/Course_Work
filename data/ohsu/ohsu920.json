To assess the physiological significance of these differing in vitro TNF effects, ex vivo and in vivo investigations were performed using animal models. Neutrophils from the peripheral blood of rabbits preadministered systemic TNF showed impaired ability to migrate toward chemoattractants in vitro. In addition, systemic TNF administration suppressed zymosan-activated plasma-induced local accumulation of leukocytes in mouse skin. The results indicate that circulating TNF may act as a suppressor for local inflammatory reaction.\r"

  ".U": "91010742\r", 
  ".W": "PG of the E series are generally known to suppress immune responses, however, we have found that PGE synergizes with IL-4 to induce IgE and IgG1 production in LPS-stimulated murine B lymphocytes. PGE2 and PGE1 (10(-6) to 10(-8) M) significantly increase IgE and IgG1 production (up to 26-fold) at all concentrations of IL-4 tested. In addition to its effects on IgE and IgG1, PGE also causes a significant decrease in IgM and IgG3 synthesis, suggesting that PGE may promote IL-4-induced class switching. The specificity of the E series PG effect is demonstrated by the fact that PGF2 alpha (10(-6) M) does not alter production of any of these isotypes. Because PGE can mediate its effects through cAMP in some cases, we investigated the importance of cAMP levels in regulation of isotype expression. Other agents that increase intracellular cAMP levels (cholera toxin and dibutyryl cAMP) were assessed for their ability to regulate isotype differentiation. Cholera toxin (100 pg/ml) and dibutyryl cAMP (100 microM) significantly enhanced IgE and IgG1 production and diminished IgM and IgG3 synthesis. We also show that PGE and cholera toxin elevate intracellular cAMP in B lymphocytes in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, PGF2 alpha (10(-6) M) and the B subunit of cholera toxin (100 pg/ml) did not increase cAMP and did not regulate the isotype of Ig produced, reiterating the importance of cAMP in enhancing isotype differentiation. Although PGE is known to inhibit a number of immune responses, our data show that it is not always inhibitory. PGE may play a role in atopy in vivo where PGE-secreting cells such as macrophages, follicular dendritic cells, and fibroblasts can promote IgE synthesis. This research emphasizes the importance of PGE in regulation of the humoral immune response and adds a new stimulatory action to the repertoire of known PGE effects.\r"

  ".U": "91010743\r", 
  ".W": "Human mast cells can be divided into two subsets based on serine proteinase composition: a subset that contains the serine proteinases tryptase and chymase (MCTC), and a subset that contains only tryptase (MCT). In this study we examined both types of mast cells for two additional proteinases, cathepsin G and elastase, which are the major serine proteinases of neutrophils. Because human mast cell chymase and cathepsin G are both chymotrypsin-like proteinases, the properties of these enzymes were further defined to confirm their distinctiveness. Comparison of their N-terminal sequences showed 30% nonidentity over the first 35 amino acids, and comparison of their amino acid compositions demonstrated a marked difference in their Arg/Lys ratios, which was approximately 1 for chymase and 10 for cathepsin G. Endoglycosidase F treatment increased the electrophoretic mobility of chymase on SDS gels, indicating significant N-linked carbohydrate on chymase; no effect was observed on cathepsin G. Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting with specific antisera to each proteinase revealed little, if any, detectable cross-reactivity. Immunocytochemical studies showed selective labelling of MCTC type mast cells by cathepsin G antiserum in sections of human skin, lung, and bowel. No labeling of mast cells by elastase antiserum was detected in the same tissues, or in dispersed mast cells from lung and skin. A protein cross-reactive with cathepsin G was identified in extracts of human skin mast cells by immunoblot analysis. This protein had a slightly higher Mr (30,000) than the predominant form of neutrophil cathepsin G (Mr 28,000), and could not be separated from chymase (Mr 30,000) by SDS gel electrophoresis because of the size similarity. Using casein, a protein substrate hydrolyzed at comparable rates by chymase and cathepsin G, it was shown that about 30% of the caseinolytic activity in mast cell extracts was sensitive to inhibitors of cathepsin G that had no effect on chymase. Hydrolytic activity characteristic of elastase was not detected in these extracts. These studies indicate that human MCTC mast cells may contain two different chymotrypsin-like proteinases: chymase and a proteinase more closely related to cathepsin G, both of which are undetectable in MCT mast cells. Neutrophil elastase, on the other hand, was not detected in human mast cells by our procedures.\r"

  ".W": "In a survey of 15 different virus isolates, no IFN-alpha or IFN-beta activity was detected in culture fluids of HIV-infected T cells or monocytes. Exogenous rIFN-alpha added to T lymphoblast or monocyte cultures induced restriction in replication of the amphotropic HIV that infect both cell types. With IFN-treated HIV-infected T cells, levels of reverse transcriptase (RT) activity in culture fluids were half those in control cultures, but the frequency of infected cells or the levels of p24 Ag released in culture fluids were unchanged. In contrast to the modest effect of IFN on HIV-infected T cells, IFN-induced antiviral activity in monocytes was quite dramatic. Monocytes treated with IFN at the time of virus challenge showed no evidence of HIV infection: no p24 Ag or RT activity, no viral mRNA, and no proviral DNA. In this system, IFN interrupts one or more early event(s) in the virus replication cycle before formation of proviral DNA. Monocyte cultures infected with HIV 7 days before IFN treatment showed a gradual decrease in levels of p24 Ag and RT activity to baseline by 3 wk. HIV-induced cytopathic changes were markedly reduced, and the frequency of productively infected cells was less than or equal to 1% of total cells. Virus particles released 24 h after IFN treatment were 100- to 1000-fold less infectious than equal numbers of control virions. But, monocytes treated with IFN 7 days after HIV infection were not free of the retroviral pathogen: levels of proviral DNA in the IFN-treated and control HIV-infected cells were indistinguishable. The presence of large quantities of proviral DNA in cells with little or no evidence for active transcription documents a situation approaching true microbiological latency.\r"

  ".U": "91010746\r", 
  ".W": "We have previously described a synthetic peptide (T1-SP10) derived from two noncontiguous regions of HTLVIIIB envelope gp120 (T1, amino acids 428-443; SP10, amino acids 303-321) that induced type-specific anti-HIV neutralizing antibodies and T cell proliferative responses against native HIV gp120 when used as a carrier-free immunogen in goats. In this study, HTLVIIIB T1-SP10 synthetic peptides were used to immunize rhesus monkeys to determine if the peptides were capable of eliciting HIV-specific neutralizing antibody and proliferative responses in primates. Four compounds (alum, polyA:polyU, threonyl-muramyldipeptide (MDP) and IFA) were also compared for efficacy as adjuvants in this system. Rhesus monkeys immunized with T1-SP10 peptides generated high titers of antibodies against the immunogens and also against HTLVIIIB gp120. Sera from all four animals given T1-SP10 in IFA or threonyl-MDP neutralized infection by HTLVIIIB and blocked virus-dependent cell fusion events. A peak neutralization titer of 1:940 was seen in one animal given IFA (19600) and a titer of 1:900 was seen in one of the monkeys (17371) given threonyl-MDP. Proliferative responses of immune rhesus PBMC to T1-SP10 appeared after the first injection. After eight immunizations, two of eight monkeys (one injected with peptides in threonyl-MDP and one given peptides in IFA) had PBMC proliferative responses to native HTLVIIIB gp120. These data demonstrate that the carrier-free T1-SP10 synthetic peptide construct can induce high titers of neutralizing anti-HIV antibody responses and PBMC proliferative responses to HIV in primates.\r"

The coupling was done via the N-terminus of one peptide and a cysteine residue on either terminus of the other. BL/10 (H-2b) and B10.BR (H-2k) mice were immunized with these MSA2-(NANP)n conjugates. The mice were also immunized with the unconjugated MSA2 peptides and with NP(NANP)5NA and C(NANP)6. Antibody responses were evaluated by 1) ELISA, in which the MSA2 peptides and C(NANP)6 were used as Ag; 2) immunofluorescence assays (IFAT) against intact sporozoites and merozoites; and 3) immunoblotting experiments against solubilized P. falciparum blood stage proteins. High titer antibodies to (NANP)n were elicited in both BL/10 and B10.BR mice after immunization with all the conjugates except MSA2/7-(NANP)n which gave only a very limited response in B10.BR mice. These antibodies recognized unfixed sporozoites. The conjugates also elicited antibodies to MSA2 as shown by ELISA, IFAT, and immunoblotting except for mice immunized with MSA2/1B-(NANP)n where an anti-MSA2 response was only detectable by immunoblotting. Immunization with unconjugated MSA2 peptides showed that MSA2/2 was immunogenic in both BL/10 and BR.10 mice, with MSA2/6 and MSA2/7 being immunogenic only in BL/10 mice. The antibodies elicited recognized both merozoites and the MSA2 protein. However, the antibody titers were lower overall than those seen when these peptides were used in the conjugated form. No anti-MSA2 antibodies were detected after immunization with MSA2/1A and MSA2/1B. Immunization of mice with the peptide NP(NANP)5NA produced antibodies in BL/10 (H-2b) mice only, and the immunogenicity of this preparation was poor. In contrast, C(NANP)6 produced a strong antibody response in both mouse strains. The antibodies elicited by NP(NANP)5NA and C(NANP)6 recognised sporozoites in IFAT. The MSA2 peptides studied (or their derivatives) were previously shown to be recognized by human T cells. Their immunogenic potential shows promise in that complex anti-P. falciparum responses can be elicited with simple synthetic immunogens based on these peptides.\r"

  ".W": "Gamma irradiation followed by antibody and complement selection was used to isolate a human B-lymphoblastoid cell line that no longer expresses HLA-DR molecules on its cell surface. Cell surface expression in the mutant (HMy2.DRN) was restored by transfecting a wildtype DRA but not a DRB cDNA, suggesting that a structural mutation in the DRA mRNA or protein was responsible for the lack of cell surface expression. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the DRA mRNA from HMy2.DRN revealed a 75 nucleotide deletion corresponding to the start of the alpha 2 domain and involving one of two cysteines that are involved in the formation of an intrachain disulfide bond. At the biochemical level, only minute quantities of HLA-DR could be precipitated from this cell line after a 4-h continuous label with 35S-methionine. HLA-DR beta and the class II-associated invariant chain could be seen coprecipitating with the mutant DR alpha-chain, suggesting a limited accumulation of normally assembled molecules. However, by carrying out the labeling at 16 degrees C instead of 37 degrees C, equivalent amounts of HLA-DR could be precipitated from parent and mutant alike. The mutant DR alpha chain was found in association with the beta-chain, but with reduced association with the invariant chain under these conditions. Pulse chase analysis in the parent and mutant cell lines indicated that this mutant DR alpha beta I complex undergoes a process of degradation at 37 degrees C. Inhibitors of intracellular transport such as monensin were ineffective in blocking this process of degradation. This work is consistent with published reports implicating the involvement of a pre-Golgi or an early Golgi compartment in the proteolysis of aberrantly folded or assembled multisubunit proteins.\r"

This protein is structurally related to a large number of recently identified proteins that are secreted upon cellular activation. In this report we describe the isolation and characterization of the gene encoding I-309. The genomic organization is essentially identical to that found in the genes encoding the structurally similar proteins TCA-3, hJE/MCP-1, and mJE, strengthening the hypothesis that these genes are evolutionarily related. The region of the I-309 gene 5' of the mRNA cap site exhibits extensive nucleotide sequence homology with the same region of the murine gene TCA-3, providing additional evidence that I-309 and TCA-3 are likely to be homologs. Finally, panels of rodent-human somatic cell hybrids were used to map the I-309 gene to human chromosome 17. In conjunction with recent mapping data from other laboratories, this result suggests the presence of a cluster of related genes on this chromosome.\r"

In this report we have used rDNA technology to express TCA3 in two mammalian cell lines. In both cases, TCA3 was expressed as a secreted molecule with an apparent molecular mass of 16 kDa. Digestion of the (rTCA3) with the enzyme N-glycanase revealed that approximately 8 kDa is caused by N-linked glycosylation. Intradermal injection of rTCA3 into mouse footpads resulted in a rapid swelling response. The sites of injection were characterized histologically by a local accumulation of neutrophils. These findings are discussed with particular attention to a family of related proteins, some of whose members also have inflammatory properties.\r"

This study proposes the use of anti-Id mAb as Ag substitutes to induce anti-tumor immunity in gastrointestinal cancer patients. Recently, we have generated and characterized one monoclonal anti-Id antibody, designated 3H1 (Ab2), which mimics biologically and antigenically a distinct and specific epitope of the 180,000 m.w. carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) primarily expressed in high density by human pancreatic and colonic tumor cells. This epitope is unique to CEA and not present on other CEA-related lower m.w. members of the Ag family also found on normal tissues. The antigenic determinant as defined by the mAb 8019 (Ab1) against which the Ab2, 3H1 was raised, is absent on normal adult tissues by immunoperoxidase staining and haematopoietic cells including granulocytes by flow cytometry analysis. Anti-Id (Ab2) 3H1 induced CEA-specific antibodies in mice and rabbits. The immune sera from both mice and rabbits competed with Ab1 for binding to the colon carcinoma cell line LS174T and inhibited the binding of radioiodinated Ab1 to Ab2. This indicates that anti-anti-Id (Ab3) in mice and rabbits share idiotopes with Ab1 (8019). Furthermore, monoclonal Ab3 that bind to CEA have been generated from mice immunized with 3H1. The Ab3 (both polyclonal as well as monoclonal) immunoprecipitated the same 180,000 m.w. CEA as Ab1 (8019) by Western blotting analysis and showed almost identical immuno-staining patterns as Ab1 on colonic adenocarcinoma tissue sections from several patients. Collectively these data suggest that Ab2 3H1 could potentially be used clinically as a network Ag for immunotherapy of patients with CEA positive tumors.\r"

  ".W": "A number of different immunotherapeutic reagents are currently being developed to target IL-2R for the treatment of leukemia, graft rejection, and certain autoimmune diseases. Previously, we have shown that IL-2-PE40, a chimeric protein composed of human IL-2 linked to the N-terminus of a truncated form of Pseudomonas exotoxin (PE), could effectively kill a variety of cell lines in vitro expressing either low, intermediate, or high affinity IL-2R. Here, we demonstrate that IL-2-PE40 can successfully retard or prevent the growth of a lethal ascites tumor or a solid tumor composed of EL4J murine thymoma cells transfected with the p55 murine IL-2R. The transfected line, EL4J-3.4, expresses 1,000 to 3,000 high affinity IL-2R. Survival extension in the ascites model was achieved by initiating treatment either after 4 to 6 h or within 5 days post-tumor injection in both athymic nude and C57BL/6 mice. Similarly, the growth of an aggressive s.c. solid tumor could also be inhibited. Extension of survival was not achieved either by using the truncated toxin alone not attached to IL-2 or by using an IL-2-PE40Asp553 mutant lacking a functional toxin. Survival extension was not caused by IL-2 activated NK or other host effector mechanisms as IL-2-PE40 was unable to prevent the receptor-negative EL4J parental line from forming a lethal ascites or a solid tumor. Thus, IL-2-PE40 is a potent, specific cytolytic reagent that may prove useful in the arsenal of anti-IL-2R immunotherapeutics.\r"

To determine whether in vivo LC undergo changes similar to cultured LC, we examined the phenotypic and functional characteristics of LC harvested from ear skin of naive mice painted with various haptens and primary irritants. At 24 h after application of 3% trinitrochlorobenzene, LC appear larger and exhibit more intense staining in epidermal sheets using anti-I-A antibodies, and there was a two- to threefold increase in I-A and I-E expression by LC using flow microfluorimetry analysis. CD45 Ag expression was not altered. Flow microfluorimetry profiles showed the presence of two different LC populations based on fluorescence intensity, i.e., one with the same Ia density as nontreated LC and the other (representing 22 to 50% of all LC) with a markedly enhanced Ia density, (i.e., a 10-fold increase in I-A and I-E). This phenotypic change was observed only with haptens, such as trinitrochlorobenzene, dinitrofluorobenzene, oxazolone, and cinnamic aldehyde. In contrast, application of 10 to 30% sodium lauryl sulfate or vehicle controls did not induce this change. Functionally, LC obtained from hapten-painted mice induced a two- to fivefold increase in 3[H]-TdR incorporation by syngeneic or allogeneic T cells, compared to equal numbers of LC from nontreated or vehicle-treated or sodium lauryl sulfate-treated mice. These phenotypic and functional changes that occur in vivo are therefore analogous to those seen when LC are cultured for short periods of time. Thus, activated LC appear in vivo in response to the epicutaneous application of haptens and may represent an essential step in hapten-specific sensitization.\r"

  ".W": "Murine CD4+ T cell clones have been classified into at least two subsets, Th1 and Th2, on the basis of their distinct lymphokine secretion profiles and functions. In the present study, we compared the functional responses of Th1 and Th2 clones to Ag presentation by splenic B cells and peritoneal macrophages. Th2 clones secreted IL-4 in response to Ag presented by resting B cells, but their optimal proliferation required the addition of IL-1 or a source of IL-1. The degree of IL-1 dependence varied among the four Th2 clones examined. In contrast, Th1 clones secreted IL-2 and proliferated in response to Ag presented by both B cells and macrophages, without any requirement for exogenous IL-1. Furthermore, the proliferation of Th2 clones in response to Ag presented by splenocytes or macrophages was inhibited by an IL-1R antagonist. These results indicate that IL-1 is an important costimulator for the expansion of the Th2 subset of CD4+ T cells. The different requirements for the proliferation of Th1 and Th2 cells may be responsible for the preferential expansion of one or the other subset under different conditions of immunization.\r"

  ".W": "Spleen dendritic cells (DC) and epidermal Langerhans cells (LC) belong to the same family of dendritic leukocytes and are considered to be prototypes of lymphoid DC and nonlymphoid DC, respectively. These cells are active APC in vitro and play a key role in the induction of primary T cell dependent immune responses in vivo. Two functional states of LC have been characterized in vitro, freshly isolated LC and cultured LC (cLC). That cLC closely resemble spleen DC in phenotype and function, has led to the hypothesis that LC undergo maturation toward DC while in culture, an event that has been correlated with the emigration of LC from skin into lymphoid organs. To date, however, DC have been studied only after overnight culture. To better understand the relationship between LC and DC, we examined DC shortly after their isolation from spleen, and after 24 h of culture. Freshly isolated DC (fDC) express high levels of MHC molecules and low levels of Fc gamma RII and C3biR; fDC also uniformly express the Ag recognized by the mAb 33D1, NLDC-145, and J11d. After culture, DC display a marked increase in the expression of MHC molecules, and they are induced to express the low affinity receptor for IL-2. By contrast, the expression of Fc gamma RII and F4/80 decreases with culture. With respect to function, fDC can efficiently present keyhole limpet hemocyanin to Ag-specific T cells, whereas cultured DC exhibit a marked reduction in this capacity. Finally, both fDC and cultured DC are capable of endocytosing surface Ia molecules, but only fDC are able to deliver them into acidic compartments. Our data indicate that fDC from spleen resemble freshly isolated LC from epidermis and that both cells undergo parallel changes during culture. These results suggest that LC and DC possess analogous attributes in vivo and respond similarly to external influences.\r"

Skin from C3H mice was grafted onto BALB/c nude mice, and 7 or 14 days later, the recipients were sensitized with FITC through the grafts. APC from lymph nodes draining the site of sensitization were capable of sensitizing C3H recipients to FITC. Because sensitization is MHC restricted, only cells reaching the lymph node from the grafted skin could have induced contact hypersensitivity in C3H mice. Examination of the FITC+ draining lymph node cells by immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy demonstrated that all were Ia+, most were F4/80+, and some contained Birbeck granules. These studies demonstrate that Ia+, FITC+ cells from the skin, at least some of which are Langerhans cells, leave the skin after epicutaneous sensitization with FITC and participate in the initiation of the contact hypersensitivity response within the regional lymph node.\r"

This approach allows a quantitative comparison of different reagents, regardless of parameters such as affinity for CD4. In sharp contrast to results reported for preactivated T cells and CD4 transfected T cell hybridomas, all 22 CD4 mAb tested did inhibit proliferative responses of freshly isolated CD4 T cells to MHC class II Ag. At the lowest saturating concentration of each antibody, T cell proliferation was reduced by 45 to 82%. Inhibition did not depend on antibody-induced modulation of CD4 expression. Strikingly, no correlation was found between the functional effects and the specificity of the mAb for different epitopes on CD4, such as the putative binding sites for MHC class II or HIV glycoprotein gp120.\r"

  ".U": "91010772\r", 
  ".W": "In vivo UV exposure of human epidermis abrogates the function of CD1+DR+ Langerhans cells and induces the appearance of CD1-DR+ Ag-presenting macrophages. Epidermal cells from UV-exposed skin, in contrast to epidermal cells from normal skin, potently activate autologous CD4+ T cells, and, in particular, the CD45RA+ (2H4+) (suppressor-inducer) subset. We therefore determined whether UV-exposure in humans leads to a T cell response in which suppression dominates. Autologous blood T cells were incubated with epidermal cell suspensions from in vivo UV-irradiated skin. After activation, repurified T cells were transferred in graded numbers to autologous mononuclear cells (MNC) stimulated with PWM and the resultant IgG production analyzed by ELISA. Relative to T cells activated by unirradiated control epidermal cells, T cells activated by UV-exposed epidermal cells demonstrated enhanced capacity to suppress IgG production (n = 6; p less than or equal to 0.03). Within the T cell population, CD8+ cells stimulated by UV-exposed epidermal cells could be directly activated to suppress PWM-stimulated MNC Ig production if IL-2 was provided in the reaction mixture. The suppressive activity was also transferable with purified CD4+ T cells stimulated by UV-exposed epidermal cells (n = 10; p less than or equal to 0.01), and was radiosensitive. Suppression was decreased when PWM-stimulated MNC were depleted of CD8+ T cells before mixing with CD4+ T cells activated by UV-exposed epidermal cells, suggesting indirect induction of CD8+ Ts cells contained within the responding MNC populations. Indeed, physical depletion of CD45RA+ cells resulted in total abrogation of the suppressor function contained in the CD4+ T cells. Activation of suppressor function was critically dependent on DR+ APC contained in UV-exposed epidermis. The data suggest that UV-exposure modulates cutaneous APC activity in humans, as in mice, such that the dominant immune response is tilted toward suppression. These mechanisms in normal individuals may function to dampen responses to UV-induced endogenous Ag that are pathogenic in autoimmune disorders. However, these mechanisms might also facilitate the growth of UV-induced skin cancers.\r"

  ".U": "91010773\r", 
  ".W": "The predominant T lymphocytes that accumulate in the peripheral lymphoid tissues of mice homozygous for the lpr gene bear the phenotype CD3+CD4-CD8-. By certain functional criteria these cells would appear to have impaired CD3-mediated signal transduction, in that they do not respond to alloantigen and produce little if any detectable IL-2 or other lymphokines. However, the signal pathway appears adequate for achieving other T cell functions, including induction of high affinity IL-2R, and thymic deletion. To clarify the basis of this seeming discrepancy, we examined transmembrane signal transduction in T cell subsets of lpr/lpr (lpr) and +/+ mice, as defined by increased [Ca2+]i and the generation of inositol phosphates (InsPs). Stimulation of lpr CD4-CD8- cells with anti-CD3 antibody produced prompt and sustained increases in the concentration of [C2+]i and in InsPs. Similar responses occurred in mature T cells from lpr and +/+ mice, except for the somewhat slower kinetics of their increased [Ca2+]i. In marked distinction to the anti-CD2-mediated response, Con A, even in high doses, could not stimulate any increase of [Ca2+]i in lpr CD4-CD8- cells, and only modest increases in InsPs. Mature T cells, whether of lpr or +/+ origin, yielded normal increased [Ca2+]i with Con A. The reason for the differences in signal transduction between anti-CD3 and Con A stimulation of lpr CD4-CD8- cells may relate to the absence of surface structures on these immature T cells that are required for activation by Con A but not by anti-CD3. The data demonstrate that the CD3 complex in lpr CD4-CD8- T cells can couple to phospholipase C to hydrolyze phosphoinositides. These activation properties of lpr CD4-CD8- T cells have interesting functional parallels to thymocytes at the time of thymic selection, as well as tolerance induction of mature T lymphocytes.\r"

  ".W": "Human severe combined immunodeficiency disease (SCID) includes an X-chromosome-linked type characterized by a complete absence of mature T cells, hypogammaglobulinemia but normal or elevated number of B cells, suggesting that the disease results from a block in early T cell differentiation. It has been shown that B cells from obligate carrier women of this disorder exhibit the preferential use of the nonmutant X chromosome as the active X (as shown for T cells), suggesting that the SCID gene product has a direct effect on B cells as well as on T cells. To examine this question, we analyzed the phenotypic and functional characteristics of peripheral B cells from nine infants with SCID. We found a constant absence of spontaneously expressed activation Ag on B cell membrane from all SCID patients tested which contrasts with the phenotypic pattern exhibited by age-matched infants whom all cells bearing surface Ig express the 4F2 Ag and to a lesser extent the transferrin receptor. Concurrently, B cells from SCID patients have a profound impairment in their responses to stimuli that induce in vitro B cell proliferation and differentiation. Although rIL-2 and low-Mr B cell growth factor are potent inducers of proliferation on age-matched infants' B cells, they are poorly efficient in inducing proliferation of anti-mu-activated SCID B cells. This impairment is not related to the resting B cell phenotype of SCID B cells as shown by comparison with normal resting B cells. Furthermore, we observed an apparent block in B cell differentiation inasmuch as neither rIL-2 nor rIL-6 could support SAC-activated SCID B cell differentiation, both lymphokines being very efficient in inducing SAC-activated age-matched infants' B cell or purified resting B cell differentiation. These results suggest that the SCID gene defect has a direct effect on B cells and is required during B cell maturation.\r"

DR2a and DR2b represent the two isotypic DRbeta chains expressed in DR2Dw2 haplotypes. Eleven MBP-specific cytolytic T cell lines derived from patients with multiple sclerosis were isolated. Two of these cell lines recognized MBP-pulsed DR2-expressing L cell transfectants and four of them could only recognize the L cells if the adhesion molecule ICAM-1 was expressed in addition to HLA-DR2. Five of the six lines were restricted by HLA-DR2a; one line recognized Ag in conjunction with DR2b, but only if ICAM-1 was coexpressed. The remaining five lines did not lyse MBP-pulsed L cells. The ability of the DR2b molecules on transfected cells to stimulate T cells was confirmed with DR2b-allospecific T cell clones. Although five MBP-specific lines were restricted by DR2a, they recognized different parts of the MBP molecule, as demonstrated by the presentation of shorter peptides. Thus, our results suggest that DR2a is a dominant restriction molecule in MBP-specific responses by DR2+ MS patients. The results also indicate that the reported heterogeneity in MBP epitopes recognized by DR2-restricted T cells, may not be due to the use of different restriction elements but rather to the binding of different MBP peptides to DR2a molecules.\r"

None of these cultures produced either detectable quantities of viral reverse transcriptase activity or p24 Ag following inoculation with HIV-1. In contrast, in five of six cases in which these PBMC were depleted of B cells by antibody plus complement prior to viral inoculation, the presence of viral reverse transcriptase and p24 Ag was detected. The presence of normal levels of CD4-Ag at the surface of the CD4+ cells in these populations was established by flow cytometry. Analysis by an immunoblot assay revealed that anti-HIV antibodies were present in the sera obtained from these infected donors; in addition, 7 of 10 culture fluids derived from the nondepleted PBMC were shown to contain virus-neutralizing antibodies. Cultures which were depleted of B cells did not contain detectable levels of antiviral antibodies. Confirmation that the virus produced by the PBMC which had been depleted of B cells was of the strain used to infect the cultures, rather than that which initially caused patient infection, was provided on the basis of differential susceptibility to antibody neutralization. These results suggest that antibodies produced by B cells in cultures of PBMC from seropositive donors may restrict infection by HIV-1 of such cultures under laboratory conditions.\r"

Many of these processes require the activity of DNA topoisomerases I and II. We have investigated the interactions of TNF with inhibitors of both topoisomerases in 16-h assays using the murine L929 and human ME-180 cell lines, which undergo a cytotoxic TNF response. Camptothecin, a specific inhibitor of topoisomerase I, enhanced TNF cytotoxicity 150-fold against both cell lines. The topoisomerase II inhibitors VM-26 and VP-16, which stabilize covalent DNA-topoisomerase intermediates, greatly enhance TNF cytotoxicity against both cell lines. The most effective, VM-26, can lower the TNF LD50 to femtomolar levels. In contrast, the topoisomerase II inhibitors novobiocin and coumermycin, which bind to the enzyme ATPase site, protect L929 cells from TNF cytotoxicity but enhance TNF cytotoxicity in ME-180 cells. The large changes in TNF sensitivity induced by drug concentrations that by themselves show no effect, and the opposing synergistic effects of inhibitors with different inhibitory mechanisms (in L929 cells), suggest the active involvement of topoisomerases in TNF-mediated cytotoxicity. The correlation of cytotoxic synergy with the stabilization of DNA strand breaks indicates that DNA damage may play a significant role in TNF-mediated cytotoxicity.\r"

  ".W": "A minority of transformed cell lines are directly susceptible to lysis by TNF, whereas many cells can be made sensitive to TNF by treatment with inhibitors of protein synthesis. Other groups have shown that exposure to TNF induces in many cells a transcription/translation dependent response that protects the cell from TNF lysis. Heat shock proteins are involved in protecting cells from the lethal affects of heat and other metabolic poisons. In this report, we test the possibility that heat shock proteins are also involved in protecting cells from lysis by TNF. We find that after induction of the cellular heat shock response by either heat or arsenite treatment, both spontaneously TNF-sensitive cells and those cells made sensitive by inhibition of protein synthesis are nearly completely protected from TNF cytolysis. The heat-treated cells retained most of their capacity to bind TNF, suggesting that heat shock functions at a postreceptor binding phase of the lytic process. Mouse C3HA fibroblasts are also made sensitive to TNF lysis by treatment with cytochalasin E. We have previously found that elicitation of the cell's TNF-protective response by exposure to TNF suppresses killing of C3HA by subsequent treatment with TNF plus cytochalasin E. In contrast, we report here that induction of the heat shock response did not provide significant protection to C3HA from killing by TNF in the presence of cytochalasin E. Thus, although induction of heat shock proteins does protect cells from TNF, they appear to act by a mechanism distinct from that elicited by TNF itself.\r"

  ".U": "91010783\r", 
  ".W": "Although recently polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) have been identified as producers of IL-1 beta in response to LPS and granulocyte/monocyte colony stimulating factor, little is known regarding the ability of other cytokines to induce the production of IL-1 beta in the PMN. Inasmuch as IL-1 and TNF have been shown to be important priming agents, as well as agents that induce migration of PMN, we investigated their effect on IL-1 beta gene expression in human peripheral blood PMN. In the present study, we demonstrate that human peripheral blood PMN produce IL-1 beta in response to IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta, and TNF-alpha. Control (unstimulated) human PMN had virtually undetectable levels of IL-1 beta mRNA. Either IL-1 beta or TNF, induced PMN to transiently express IL-1 beta mRNA with peak expression at 1 h, returning to untreated levels by 2 h. A dose response indicated that as little as 0.05 ng/ml of IL-1 beta or TNF resulted in IL-1 beta induction, with maximal effects at 1 ng/ml of IL-1 beta and 5 ng/ml of TNF. IL-1 alpha or IL-1 beta exhibited similar dose responses in IL-1 beta mRNA induction. Inasmuch as cytokines have been shown to have synergistic effects in cell function studies, we induced PMN with a combination of maximally effective doses of TNF plus IL-1 beta. They demonstrated a cooperative effect on IL-1 beta gene expression, in that mRNA levels were sustained for three hours. IL-1 beta Ag expression, as measured by ELISA, paralleled IL-1 beta mRNA expression with cell associated peak levels at 2 to 4 h. IL-1 beta Ag levels in PMN lysates and supernatants correlated with IL-1 beta mRNA levels, i.e., TNF + IL-1 greater than TNF greater than IL-1. Thus, these studies represent the first demonstration of IL-1 and TNF induction of IL-1 beta gene expression in the PMN. Furthermore, the time course of induction is unique to the PMN, with peak induction of mRNA at 1 h, which is consistent with the short lived nature of these cells in inflammatory lesions.\r"

  ".W": "Upon mitogenic stimulation, both mRNA encoding the p55 alpha-subunit (Tac) of the human IL-2R alpha and IL-2R alpha protein are induced and expressed in tonsil lymphocyte populations over several days. Using a quantitative dot-blot immunoassay for the IL-2R alpha subunit, a rapid disappearance of this polypeptide from cells is demonstrated in the presence of the translation inhibitor, cycloheximide. The half-life of IL-2R alpha subunit protein is 2 to 3 h. This decline in cell-associated IL-2R alpha subunit is matched by a rapid decline in IL-2R alpha on the cell surface and is not accompanied by any increase in soluble IL-2R alpha protein. Long term expression of the IL-2R on the cell surface is thus the result of continual synthesis and rapid breakdown of IL-2R alpha chains in the cell. Steady state expression of the IL-2R after an immune stimulus hence depends upon continuous expression of the IL-2R alpha subunit gene. Rapid turnover of the unstable alpha-subunit on the cell surface provides a novel mechanism for sensitive control of functional IL-2R expression.\r"

  ".U": "91010786\r", 
  ".W": "Extracellular killing is regarded as one of the main functions of eosinophils. Therefore, a cytotoxicity assay against antibody-coated Daudi-lymphoma cells was established to measure cytokine effects on peripheral blood eosinophils from healthy volunteers. Optimal time of exposure to cytokines and half optimal concentrations (EC50) were determined and the capability of various cytokines to enhance cytotoxicity of eosinophils was compared. Thus, after 24 h with cytokine, the highest activation of eosinophils was observed with recombinant human rhIFN-gamma (EC50 = 0.2 U/ml), followed by the known activators of eosinophils recombinant human granulocyte/macrophage CSF (rhGM-CSF), rhIL-3, and murine IL-5 (mIL-5). rhIFN-alpha and natural human IFN-beta (nhIFN-beta) enhanced cytotoxicity as well. On the other hand, in short term assays, eosinophils were not stimulated by IFN and the strongest stimulator was rhGM-CSF (EC50 = 0.2 U/ml), followed by rhIL-3, mIL-5, rhTNF, and rhIL-4. With rhTNF-alpha enhancement was more pronounced on freshly isolated eosinophils (EC50 = 0.6 U/ml) and declined with time. No significant stimulation was detected with rhG-CSF, rhIL-1 beta, rhIL-2, rhIL-6, and rhIL-8. On neutrophils, rhIL-8 enhanced cytotoxicity, but the stimulation was weak in relation to other neutrophil activators. Studies on the mechanism of cytotoxic activity revealed that cytotoxicity required opsonization of targets with specific antibody. FMF analysis was performed demonstrating that freshly isolated eosinophils express Fc-gamma RII (CD32), small amounts of Fc-gamma RIII (CD16), but not Fc-gamma RI (CD64). In experiments with blocking antibodies to Fc-gamma R cytotoxicity was restricted to Fc-gamma RII. Expression of Fc-gamma RII was not enhanced by rhGM-CSF, rhTNF-alpha, and mIL-5, but a significant increase in the number of positive cells was observed after incubation with rhIFN-gamma for 24 h (p less than 0.05). In addition, enhanced viability of eosinophils was observed when cultured in the presence of rhIFN-gamma, rhIFN-alpha, rhGM-CSF, and rhTNF-alpha, but not of rhG-CSF and rhIL-2. Thus, IFN appear to be another class of activators of eosinophils, characterized by their delayed type of action.\r"

  ".W": "The CD45 molecule was analyzed from murine intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes (IEL). Immunofluorescent staining of CD8+ IEL revealed varying degrees of reactivity with mAb specific for CD45-restricted determinants, some which are typically expressed only by B cells. Immunoprecipitation of CD45 molecules from IEL yielded an array of proteins with apparent (m.w.) ranging from 180,000 to 260,000. The m.w. 260,000 form was restricted to IEL, was distinct from the B220 molecule, and was the only CD45 isoform that expressed the CD45-associated carbohydrate differentiation Ag CT1. Moreover, the CT1 determinant was present on cells of the Thy-1- but not the Thy-1+ IEL subset. Sequential immunoprecipitation studies indicated that expression of the m.w. 260,000 protein was not restricted to CT1+ cells. The protein composition of the m.w. 260,000 CD45 isoform was examined by using the polymerase chain reaction for analysis of CD45 variable exon usage. In contrast to B cells in which the major CD45 mRNA contained all three variable exons (exons 4, 5, and 6), IEL CD45 mRNA contained significant amounts of two-exon, single exon, and zero variable exon forms. Restriction enzyme analysis identified the single exon form as exon 5 and the two-exon form as a mixture of exons 4 and 5 and exons 5 and 6. Metabolic labeling of CD45 in pulse-chase experiments suggested that the generation of this high m.w. protein was caused by post-translational modifications, perhaps glycosylation. Overall, the results indicated that the high m.w. form of CD45 and the addition of the CT1 determinant were generated via IEL-specific post-translational modifications and not by novel alternate exon usage.\r"

We found previously that a fraction of the total cellular pool of LSP1 protein accumulates at or near the cytoplasmic face of the plasma membrane. LSP1 protein was also shown to be present in the cytoplasm. Here we report that approximately 10% of the total intracellular LSP1 protein is associated with the Nonidet P-40 insoluble cytoskeleton of the mIgM+, mIgD+ B lymphoma cell line BAL17. Variation in conditions of extraction did not alter this value. To rule out the possibility that LSP1 associates with the nucleus that is also present in the detergent insoluble pellet, we prepared a separate nuclear fraction essentially free of cytoskeletal material and found only trace amounts of LSP1 protein. After accounting for yield losses during subcellular fractionation by measuring the recovery of 125I-labeled membrane IgM, or of the cytoplasmic marker enzyme lactate dehydrogenase activity, the LSP1 in membrane fractions was calculated to represent approximately 30% of the total cellular LSP1 and cytoplasmic LSP1 accounted for approximately 55% of the total. Approximately 75% of the plasma membrane LSP1 protein was soluble in 1% Nonidet P-40 containing buffer, indicating that the majority of the LSP1 in the plasma membrane fraction was distinct from the cytoskeletal LSP1 protein. The preparation of membrane fractions in the presence of 1 M NaCl, or washing of membranes in 3 M KCl did not diminish the levels of membrane LSP1. These results show the existence of three discrete intracellular LSP1 pools. Double label immunofluorescence studies showed that the peripheral ring-like distribution of LSP1 in BAL17 cells became a distinct cap upon cross-linking the mIgM. These intracellular LSP1 caps were always found to be located directly underneath the mIgM caps.\r"

  ".W": "The relationships between functional, biochemical, and genetic homologues of human and mouse C receptors 1 (CR1) and 2 (CR2) are incompletely understood. We have isolated and characterized a partial mouse CR2 cDNA clone and determined the exon-intron organization of the gene encoding it. Together they predict a form of mouse CR2 highly identical to the 15 short consensus repeat form of human CR2. Strong similarities in genomic organization and exon-intron junctions indicate that this mouse gene and human CR2 are evolutionary homologues. A polyclonal rabbit anti-mouse CR2 fusion protein, BRN-1, was prepared. BRN-1 immunoprecipitates bands of 155 to 160 kDa under nonreducing conditions in mouse CR2 expressing B cell lines. In mouse spleen a doublet of 155 kDa and 190 kDa under nonreducing and 165 and 205 kDa under reducing conditions is recognized by immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis. Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease maps of these two proteins show many shared bands. Crossed immunoprecipitation using BRN-1 and 7E9, a previously described mAb reported to identify the 190-kDa mouse CR1 and a smaller 150-kDa protein, indicates that both antibodies react with the same proteins. Therefore, by using BRN-1 we have now linked the genetic mouse CR2 to its functional, biochemically characterized gene product. The observation that BRN-1 also recognizes a second 190-kDa mouse protein defined functionally as a homologue of human CR1, and that these proteins have very similar peptide maps, provides strong evidence that these two proteins are expressed by a single mouse CR2/CR1 transcription unit.\r"

Structural similarities between the amino-terminal of C1q and collagen have suggested that receptors for both molecules on platelets might be the same. The present study thus compared the interaction of purified C1q receptors (C1qR) and whole platelets with collagen- and C1q-coated polystyrene surfaces. Surfaces coated with BSA or gelatin served as controls. Purified 125I-labeled C1qR recognized both C1q- and collagen-coated surfaces in a divalent, cation-independent manner. This adhesion was inhibited by polyclonal or monoclonal (II1/D1) anti-C1qR antibodies. Although C1qR adhered preferentially to C1q-coated surfaces, adhesion to bovine and human type I collagen, as well as to human type III and V collagen, was also noted. In parallel studies, 51Cr-labeled platelets bound equally well to collagen- or C1q-coated surfaces, albeit in a magnesium-dependent manner. Partial inhibition of platelet adhesion was observed in the presence of RGDS, despite the inability of RGDS to modify C1qR interaction with C1q or collagen. Moreover, anti C1qR antibodies selectively inhibited platelet adhesion to C1q-coated surfaces, whereas antibodies specific for the GPIa/IIa collagen receptor (6F1) preferentially inhibited platelet collagen interactions. These data support the presence of distinct platelet membrane C1qR, which may cross-react with collagen, and suggest that C1qR are necessary but not sufficient for platelet adhesion to C1q-coated surfaces. Additional divalent cation and/or RGD-sensitive binding sites may participate.\r"

One anti-lipid A antibody, IC9, proved protective against gram-negative bacteremia and endotoxic shock in murine protection models. We generated anti-idiotypic antibodies against IC9. The binding of several of these anti-Id to IC9 was specifically inhibited by lipid A. We used these anti-Id to characterize the anti-LPS response, and the results revealed that the IC9 Id is conserved in different species. The importance of an interspecies cross-reactive Id in the response to endotoxin and its relevance in vaccine development for septic shock are discussed.\r"

  ".U": "91010795\r", 
  ".W": "When human neutrophils are incubated with LPS, they become primed for enhanced release of O2- in response to stimulation by FMLP. We investigated two aspects of LPS priming: 1) whether priming depends on secretion of TNF-alpha by monocytes present in neutrophil preparations, and 2) whether plasma is required for priming. Using plasma-Percoll gradients, we isolated neutrophils that contained only 0.1% monocytes. At 37 degrees C, these neutrophils were significantly primed by LPS (100 ng/ml) within 30 min. In contrast, LPS-treated monocytes required 60 min to secrete significant neutrophil-priming activity, the major component of which was TNF-alpha. Further, antibody against TNF-alpha failed to inhibit priming of neutrophils by LPS at 15, 30, and 45 min, and inhibited only 15% at 60 min. The results suggested that TNF-alpha or other factors from monocytes were not essential for priming of neutrophils by LPS. Neutrophils that had been washed free of plasma by centrifugation through 50% Percoll responded only weakly to LPS with respect to priming for enhanced O2- release and increased expression of alkaline phosphatase activity on the cell surface. Priming of washed neutrophils could be restored by adding back plasma (0.1 to 1.0%). This effect of plasma was not blocked by heating the plasma to 56 degrees C but was blocked at 100 degrees C. LPS priming could be blocked by polymyxin B, even in the presence of plasma. Thus, priming required both LPS and plasma. Neutrophils incubated with LPS in the absence of plasma were not primed by subsequent addition of plasma, but were primed by addition of plasma and LPS. Culture supernatants from neutrophils incubated with 20 ng/ml LPS in the absence of plasma failed to prime fresh neutrophils, but supernatants from neutrophils incubated with LPS in the presence of 1% plasma were able to prime fresh neutrophils. These results implied that neutrophils inactivated LPS and that plasma protected LPS from inactivation. Nevertheless, such inactivated LPS retained the ability to gel Limulus lysate at 10 pg/ml, and the ability to prime monocytes at 100 pg/ml. Thus, plasma prevented a neutrophil-specific inactivation of LPS.\r"

IC consisting of polyclonal rabbit antibody to human albumin were prepared at equivalence (insoluble complexes) and at five times Ag excess (soluble complexes). Stimulation of human neutrophils with soluble and insoluble IC caused a dose-dependent activation of the respiratory burst and O2- generation. Incubation of neutrophils with cytochalasin B significantly enhanced O2- generation in neutrophils stimulated with soluble IC. In contrast, cytochalasin B treatment had a minimal effect on O2- generation in neutrophils stimulated with insoluble IC. Treatment of neutrophils with PGE1 or pertussis toxin (PTx) significantly inhibited O2- generation by soluble IC-stimulated neutrophils. However, neither PGE1 nor PTx treatment significantly altered O2- generation in neutrophils stimulated with insoluble complexes. Although O2- generation induced by soluble IC was significantly inhibited by mAb against both Fc gamma RII and Fc gamma RIII receptor, insoluble IC stimulation of neutrophil O2- generation was significantly diminished only by mAb against Fc gamma RIII receptor. Cross-linking of either Fc gamma RII or Fc gamma RIII receptors on neutrophil surfaces induced O2- generation, and this activation was inhibited by both PGE1 and PTx treatment. These findings indicate that soluble and insoluble ICs induce O2- production in human neutrophils through distinct mechanisms. Soluble IC induce activation of neutrophils through a PTx- and PGE1-sensitive pathway that is dependent upon both Fc gamma RII and Fc gamma RIII receptors. Although insoluble IC induce O2- production through a PTx and PGE1 insensitive pathway mediated primarily through Fc gamma RIII receptor.\r"

  ".U": "91010797\r", 
  ".W": "We have recently shown that endothelial cell-derived IL-8 inhibits neutrophil adhesion to IL1-beta-activated human umbilical vein endothelial cell monolayers. IL-8 secreted by T lymphocytes or monocytes has been characterized as a promoter of neutrophil degranulation and chemotaxis. The IL-8 isolated from each of these cell types is a mixture of two IL-8 polypeptides, one consisting of 72 amino acids (herein called [ser-IL-8]72) and the other 77 amino acids (an N-terminal extended form herein called [ala-IL-8]77). IL-8 derived from T lymphocytes and monocytes is predominantly [ser-IL-8]72, whereas endothelial-derived IL-8 is highly enriched (greater than 80%) in [ala-IL-8]77. We address the relationship and activities of these two forms of IL-8 using recombinant proteins expressed by both mammalian cells and Escherichia coli. Thrombin was found to efficiently convert [ala-IL-8]77 to [ser-IL-8]72. In contrast, urokinase and tissue-type plasminogen activator were unable to cleave [ala-IL-8]77, and trypsin generated multiple IL-8 cleavage fragments. In competitive binding assays using 125I[ala-IL-8]77 neutrophils exhibited a twofold preference for [ser-IL-8]72 over [ala-IL-8]77. Both forms of IL-8 inhibited neutrophil adhesion to IL-1-beta-activated HUVEC monolayers by up to 90%. However, [ser-IL-8]72 was approximately 10-fold more potent than [ala-IL-8]77 in these assays (ED50 approximately 0.3 nM for [ser-IL-8]72 vs approximately 3 nM for [ala-IL-8]77. Both forms of IL-8 promoted degranulation of cytochalasin B-treated neutrophils [[ser-IL-8]72 (ED50 greater than 10 nM) was two- to three-fold more potent than [ala-IL-8]77], although in this regard they were less active than FMLP. Our data suggest that [ala-IL-8]77 and [ser-IL-8]72 have qualitatively similar and potentially complex biological activities, and that full activation of IL-8 requires cleavage to the [ser-IL-8]72 form. In the case of inflamed endothelial cells this activation could be mediated by thrombin generated in the procoagulant environment associated with these cells.\r"

Although treatment with dexamethasone failed to inhibit histamine release from mast cells in the anaphylaxis phase, histamine production in the postanaphylaxis phase was inhibited dose dependently. Histamine production-increasing activity in the pouch fluid collected 8 h after the Ag challenge, which was estimated by an activity to stimulate histamine production by bone marrow cells, was decreased by the administration of dexamethasone at the time of the Ag challenge. The addition of steroidal antiinflammatory drugs, dexamethasone, prednisolone, or hydrocortisone, into the incubation medium inhibited the pouch fluid-induced histamine production by bone marrow cells. Hydrocortisone mesylate antagonized the inhibitory effect of dexamethasone on histamine production by bone marrow cells. However, hydrocortisone mesylate failed to recover the decrease in histamine production-increasing activity of the pouch fluid collected from dexamethasone-treated rats. In addition, the dialyzed sample of pouch fluid obtained from dexamethasone-treated nonsensitized rats did not reduce the stimulated histamine production by the pouch fluid sample obtained from the sensitized rats. However, increase in histamine production of bone marrow cells stimulated by the pouch fluid was not inhibited by cyclosporin A that inhibited histamine production induced by Con A. This observation indicates that the pouch fluid has no effect to induce production of the histamine production-increasing factor by bone marrow cells. Consequently, it is suggested that dexamethasone inhibits not only the production of histamine production-increasing factor but also the response of histamine-producing cells to this factor.\r"

This observation led us to investigate the subcellular distribution of intracellular PAF in stimulated human neutrophils, and to question the possible intracellular role of this molecule. Approximately 2 x 10(8) neutrophils were exposed to either the phagocytic stimulus, opsonized zymosan particles (25 particles/cell), the soluble stimulus, Ca2(+)-ionophore A23187 (5 micrograms/ml), or were left unstimulated for up to 30 min. After disruption, the cells were fractionated into nuclei, phagolysosomes, specific granules, azurophil granules, membranes, and cytosol. Fractions were analyzed for representative organellar markers, as well as for total protein, total phospholipid phosphorous, and PAF. In cells that had been exposed to opsonized zymosan particles, the majority of the PAF was localized to the phagolysosomal fraction, with lesser amounts being detected in the membranous and granular fractions of the cells. In neutrophils that had been exposed to A23187, the major portion of the PAF was detected in the membranous fractions with smaller amounts being seen in fractions corresponding to the specific granules. On the basis of these data, combined with the known physicochemical properties of PAF, it is speculated that the PAF detected at discrete intracellular locations in stimulated human neutrophils may play an important role in the endocytic and/or secretory functions of neutrophils.\r"

  ".W": "We have previously described a 14,700 m.w. protein (14.7K) encoded by the E3 region of adenovirus that prevents TNF-mediated cytolysis of adenovirus-infected C3HA mouse fibroblasts. In the studies described here we have extended our analysis of TNF cytolysis of C3HA cells and the circumstances under which 14.7K protects these cells from cytolysis. C3HA cells were killed by TNF in the presence of inhibitors of protein synthesis, in the presence of cytochalasin E (which disrupts the microfilaments), and when adenovirus E1A was expressed. As described for other cell types, pretreatment of C3HA cells with TNF prevented cytolysis by TNF plus cycloheximide or TNF plus cytochalasin E, indicating that TNF induces a response that protects against these treatments. Remarkably, when 14.7K was expressed in virus-infected cells, it also prevented TNF-induced lysis whether sensitivity to TNF was induced by inhibition of protein synthesis, disruption of the cytoskeleton by cytochalasin E, or expression of adenovirus E1A. The 14.7K protein also prevented TNF lysis of cells that are spontaneously sensitive to TNF lysis. Thus, 14.7K appears to be a general inhibitor of TNF cytolysis, and as such should be an important tool in unraveling the mechanism of TNF cytolysis. There was one exception; NCTC-929 cells were spontaneously sensitive to TNF lysis and that lysis was not affected by 14.7K even though the protein was made in large quantities and was metabolically stable in these cells. This suggests that there is heterogeneity among TNF-sensitive cell lines. The 14.7K protein was found in both the nuclear and cytosol fractions of TNF resistant as well as all spontaneously sensitive cells suggesting that 14.7K may have more than one site of action within the cell.\r"

The results indicate that every residue within the minimal determinant plays a role in the T cell recognition process, as single substitutions at any of these positions affected the ability of the peptide to stimulate at least some site 1-specific T cells. For the majority of the residues examined, substitutions had dissimilar effects on distinct T cells, indicating that the substituted residues were affecting recognition in a receptor-specific manner. Each of the 15 T cells examined had a distinct fine specificity pattern, suggesting that the BALB/c T cell repertoire for this site is likely to exceed 100 distinct clonotypes.\r"

All tested antibodies precipitated a 14-kDa peptide doublet that corresponded with the predicted size of the E7 protein, from HeLa cells, but not from HPV 16 E7 containing CaSki cells. HPV 18 E7 protein was detected by immunolabeling with electron microscopy in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm of HeLa cells with the greater proportion occurring in the cytoplasm. No antibody reacted specifically by indirect immunofluorescence with HeLa cells. Weak cross-reactivity of some mAb with the E6 MS2-replicase fusion protein of HPV 16 was detected by ELISA, but no protein of the appropriate size was immunoprecipitated from CaSki cells. It is concluded that the B cell epitopes on the HPV 18 E7 transforming protein are located in the N-terminal region of the molecule and that some are weakly cross-reactive with HPV 16 E6 protein. E7 protein is either present in HeLa cells at a concentration too low to be detected by indirect immunofluorescence, or the N-terminal epitopes are masked by protein conformation or interaction with cellular or other viral components.\r"

Our data show that with few exceptions expression of granzyme genes is restricted to T cells and their thymic precursors. In mature T cells granzymes are expressed only upon activation. The same is true for thymocytes, with the exception of grazyme A that is expressed also in non-stimulated cells. In T cells and thymocytes the distribution of mRNAs coding for different granzymes depends on the subpopulation tested and the activation protocol. Highly cytolytic PEL express granzymes A and B but none of the other granzymes.\r"

  ".U": "91010809\r", 
  ".W": "The HLA class II genes and haplotypes have evolved over a long period of evolutionary time by mechanisms such as gene conversion, reciprocal recombination and point mutation. The extent of the diversity generated is most clearly evident in an analysis of the HLA class II alleles present within DRw13 haplotypes. This study uses cDNA sequencing to examine the first domains of DRB1, DRB3, DQA1, and DQB1 alleles from several American black individuals expressing seven different DRw13 haplotypes, five with undefined HLA-D specificities (i.e., not Dw18 or Dw19). Two new DRw13 alleles described in this study are the first examples of convergent evolution of DR alleles in which gene conversion has apparently combined segments of DRB1 alleles encoding DRw11 and DRw8 to generate two new DRB1 alleles, DRB1*1303 and DRB1*1304, that encode molecules bearing serologic determinants of a third allele, DRw13. These new DRw13 alleles are found embedded in haplotypes of DRw11 origin distinct from haplotypes encoding previously identified DRw13 alleles, DRB1*1301 and DRB1*1302. These data suggest that two evolutionary pathways may have given rise to two subgroups of alleles encoding molecules that share DRw13 serologic determinants yet which possess different structural and, likely, functional motifs. Reciprocal gene recombination events resulting in different DR, DRw52 and DQ allele combinations also appear to have played a crucial role in augmenting the level of diversity found in DRw13 haplotypes. Recombination has resulted in the association of one of the new DRw13 alleles with a DQw2 allele normally found associated with DR7 and the association of the DRw52c-associated DRw13 allele (DRB1*1302) with three different DQw1 alleles. The seven DRw13 haplotypes that have resulted from the effect of recombination on haplotypes formed by the two pathways of DRw13 allelic diversification have resulted in different repertoires of class II molecules and, most likely, different immune response profiles in individuals with these haplotypes.\r"

A series of experiments demonstrated that the activation of protein kinase C (PKC) is involved in the DR and DP molecule expressions on T98G cells. In addition to the activation of PKC, calcium influx appeared to be involved in the DR and DP molecule expressions on T98G. Northern blot analyses with actinomycin D or cycloheximide revealed that these second messengers induce the transcription of DRA and B and DPA and B genes without de novo protein synthesis. Furthermore, we examined the region of the DPB gene that is responsible for IFN-gamma-induced gene transcription by gene transfer of a series of 5' and 3' deletion mutants in which the upstream region of the DPB was linked to a reporter gene, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase. By using these deletion mutants, it appeared that the region between -152 and -126 bp contains a critical IFN-gamma-responsive element. Taken together, these results suggest that IFN-gamma activates PKC and stimulates calcium influx, resulting in the induction of transcription of DRA and B and DPA and B genes without de novo protein synthesis. In DPB gene, we speculate that preexiting protein(s) phosphorylated by PKC in the presence of Ca2+ might directly bind or indirectly interact with the region between -152 and -126 bp of the upstream sequence, leading to the induction of the transcription (possibly in concert with other nuclear protein(s) bound to the promoter sequences).\r"

  ".W": "The ability of rIL-4 to trigger host reactivity against both a chemically induced fibrosarcoma (CE-2) and a spontaneous adenocarcinoma (TS/A) of BALB/c mice was studied. Daily local s.c. administration around tumor draining lymph nodes of 10 injections of progressive amounts (0.00001 to 1000 pg/day) of rIL-4 induced appreciable inhibition of the growth of both tumors after a dose-response survival curve peaking at 0.1 pg/day. Inasmuch as rIL-4 has no direct antitumor activity, as shown by in vitro tests, host immune reactivity plays a fundamental role in this lymphokine activated tumor inhibition (LATI). LATI, in fact, is abolished when recipient mice are sublethally irradiated or treated with cyclosporin A, or when the reactivity of CD4+ lymphocytes is suppressed, whereas it is not affected by anti-asialo GM1 antibody. The morphologic data show that rIL-4 LATI rests on the recruitment of several cell reaction mechanisms, among which those that are nonspecific seem to predominate. rIL-4 LATI also leads to a state of long lasting and specific immune memory: the growth of a second contralateral tumor challenge is significantly impaired after LATI. This immune memory takes place after LATI of both the poorly immunogenic CE-2 fibrosarcoma and the TS/A adenocarcinoma, previously classed as nonimmunogenic on the basis of immunization-protection tests. In the latter case, adoptive transfer experiments show that Thy-1+ lymphocytes and, in particular, the CD4 cell-depleted T lymphocyte subpopulation, are responsible for the immune memory. Finally, the ability of rIL-4 to trigger LATI is greater than that of the most effective doses of rIL-2, rIL-1 beta, and IFN-gamma, whereas its association with rIL-1 beta induces a more effective immune memory.\r"

To gain more insight into its pathogenesis, we studied the seroepidemiologic and clinicopathologic characteristics of 12 Greek KS patients (eight male/four female) five of whom were residents of an endemic area on the Peloponnesus. These patients were in good general health with ages ranging from 48 to 80 years, had no clinical signs of immunodeficiency, and combined the features of both classic and epidemic KS in that they displayed not only involvement of acral areas but also widespread mucocutaneous lesions. Routine laboratory data were within normal limits; no patient had HTLV-1 and HIV-1/2 antibodies, but all patients had antibodies to several herpesviruses. The histopathology was characteristic of KS with the peculiar feature of a dense infiltrate composed predominantly of CD4+ T lymphocytes. Immunoenzymatic/morphologic studies of the KS cells were consistent with their origin from lymphatic endothelium. Outstanding ultrastructural findings were tubuloreticular structures and cylindrical confronting cisternae, structures that are indicative of an ongoing viral infection. Indeed, extensive electronmicroscopic studies resulted in the detection of retrovirus-like particles in close association to KS cells in five of 12 patients. This in situ observation opens the possibility that this retro-virus contributes to KS development.\r"

To directly investigate the transforming properties of this factor, we constructed a replication-defective murine retrovirus that expresses the human sequence coding for TGF alpha. Infection of NIH/3T3 cells with the TGF alpha retrovirus led to the integration of a transcriptionally active provirus and overexpression of biologically active TGF alpha, but failed to induce morphologic transformation. Similarly, the TGF alpha retrovirus failed to induce morphologic transformation of five other types of rodent fibroblasts. We also investigated the effect of TGF alpha expression on the growth of BALB/MK mouse keratinocytes, which require epidermal growth factor (EGF) for proliferation. We show that exogenously added TGF alpha is an extremely potent mitogen for BALB/MK cells. However, retroviral expression of TGF alpha in BALB/MK cells failed to relieve dependence on exogenously added EGF (or TGF alpha) for cell growth. These results suggest that overexpression of TGF alpha does not, by itself, transform rodent fibroblasts or keratinocytes.\r"

Comparative studies using immunocytochemical staining, epidermal cell culture, and non-equilibrium pH gradient (NEpHG) gel electrophoresis analysis of the keratins extracted were carried out on five patients with various types of porokeratosis. Positive type IV collagen staining on the stratum corneum was found in lesional skin specimens of all patients, but not in normal controls. A search for connections between type IV collagen in the basement membrane of epidermis and the skin surface disclosed infrequent intra-epidermal streaking of type IV collagen and one positively stained trans-epidermal acrosyringium. Positive intra-epidermal laminin staining in porokeratosis lesions confirmed the trans-epidermal passage of basement-membrane materials. Epidermal cells cultured from lesional skin showed low plating efficiency, and all colonies exhibited intracytoplasmic vacuole formation and excessive top cell shedding. NEpHG gel electrophoresis of keratins extracted showed that lesional profiles not only contained keratins normally present in glabrous skin, but also possibly K9 and some additional proteins. K9 had been immunolocalized to periductal cells in previous studies. Our findings, taken together, strongly suggest that porokeratosis epidermis consists of epithelial cells with lumen-forming ability.\r"

Split-thickness skin specimens were put in diffusion chambers made of either millipore filters or bovine collagen membranes, and then submitted to a roller tube culture at 15 rpm and 36 degrees C. The culture medium was Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 20% fetal calf serum (FCS) + 0.4 micrograms/ml hydrocortisone. The gas used in the culture tube was air + 5% CO2. Autoradiography revealed the incorporation of [3H]-glycine into the 68-kD keratin band of explants for up to 12 weeks, indicating that normal keratinization was maintained throughout the entire culture period. The turnover time of the epidermis from basal layer to granular layer was around 7 d in both the early and late stages of culture. The addition of epidermal growth factor (EGF) to the culture caused the epidermis to become acanthotic with orthokeratosis, but with high concentrations of EGF (greater than or equal to 10 ng/ml) parakeratosis and increased proliferation of the epidermis occurred. Dexamethasone (DMS) strongly inhibited the EGF effect.\r"

Because the intercellular lipids of the SC and the degree of hydration of the membrane have been shown to be crucial determinants of barrier function, attention has been focused on the spectral features, which report specifically on these parameters. The degree of disorder of the SC intercellular lipids has been found to decrease over the outer cell layers (up to three tape-strips) and then to remain essentially constant. The amount of lipids decreases similarly such that a 60% reduction (relative to the \"no-strip\" baseline) is observed after about four tape-strips. A plausible explanation for these measurements is that the lipids near the surface are a mixture of (a) \"true\" intercellular lipid (which is expected to be highly ordered), and (b) sebaceous lipid (which contains much greater amounts of low-melting components, such as fatty acids). The sequential infrared (IR) spectra provide at least circumstantial evidence to support this hypothesis. As expected, the IR spectra show that SC hydration increases from the surface towards the SC-stratum granulosum interface. Taken together, the results imply that the SC is indeed non-uniform. The properties of the outer layers (those removed by the first 3-4 tape-strips) change significantly with increasing depth.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Vertical sections stained for histology and indirect immunofluorescence studies show a correct stratification and expression of differentiation markers. The presence of desmosomes, keratohyalin granules, and lamellar granules, and the formation of a more than ten-layers stratum corneum was evidenced by electron microscopy. Moreover, lipids typical for differentiated epidermis were present in these cultures, including ceramides, which are thought to be responsible for the relative impermeability of the stratum corneum. Under our culture conditions, i.e., in defined medium and at the air-liquid interface, the use of de-epidermized dermis as a substrate did not stimulate keratinocyte differentiation more than acetate cellulose or polycarbonate filter membrane substrates. The obtaining of a well-differentiated epidermis grown in vitro on inert filters in a chemically defined medium should be useful as a standard system for studying epidermal differentiation, re-epidermization, cytotoxicity, epidermal permeation, and transepidermal drug delivery.\r"

  ".W": "Wound healing involves a complex series of interactions between cells in the dermis and epidermis, and important relationships exist between keratinocytes and resident dermal cells. Monocytes and lymphocytes secrete cytokines that are capable of stimulating dermal repair and influencing keratinocyte and fibroblast migration and proliferation, although the mechanism by which mononuclear cells are recruited into the wound is unknown. We have tested the hypothesis that in wounded skin specialized endothelial cells are induced to mediate peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) emigration from the vasculature into the dermis. For this purpose, partial-thickness wounds made with a keratome on the backs of domestic pigs were excised 0 to 9, 12, 15, and 21 d after wounding. The biopsies were then tested for the capacity to adhere selectively to PBMC. The results indicated that PBMC overlaid onto sections of wounds from day 4 to 15 adhered selectively to dermal endothelium, with two distinct peaks of adherence observed on day 7 and day 12. In contrast, PBMC did not adhere to the tissue sections when overlaid onto frozen sections of normal skin or 0-, 1-, 2-, 3-, and 21-d-old wounded skin. Additional studies on the binding properties of PBMC subsets revealed that monocytes adhered maximally at day 7, whereas T cells adhered optimally at day 12 post-wounding. Furthermore, the adhesion process was energy and magnesium dependent but not calcium dependent and involved surface protein and carbohydrate moieties on PBMC surface. Pre-treatment of PBMC with monoclonal antibodies against the LFA-1 adhesive receptors inhibited the binding by greater than 80%, suggesting that LFA-1 adhesive receptors play an important role in the binding process. These studies provide evidence that the recruitment of monocytes and lymphocytes into wounds is an active, dynamic, and regulated process mediated at least in part by specific adhesive interactions between mononuclear leukocytes and dermal endothelial cells.\r"

Four representative lesions were reconstructed by computer from serial 1- or 2-mm plastic embedded sections. The earliest clinically detectable lesion of HHT is a focal dilatation of postcapillary venules, which continue to enlarge and eventually connect with dilated arterioles through capillaries. As the vascular lesion increases in size, the capillary segments disappear and a direct arterio-venous communication is formed. This entire sequence of morphologic events is associated with a perivascular mononuclear cell infiltrate in which the majority of cells are lymphocytes and the minority are monocytes/macrophages by ultrastructure. Comparison of these findings with the telangiectatic mats of scleroderma and cherry angiomas revealed that the former, previously shown to be composed of dilated postcapillary venules, are also associated with perivascular infiltrates, but the latter, which are produced by capillary loop aneurysms, are not.\r"

  ".W": "Evidence suggests that the phospholipase C/protein kinase C signal transduction system participates in the regulation of epidermal cell growth and differentiation. Psoriatic epidermis is characterized by hyperproliferation, defective differentiation, and inflammation. In this report, we have determined the activity of phospholipase C-catalyzed hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) and 1,2-diacylglycerol content in normal and psoriatic involved and uninvolved epidermis. 1,2-diacylglycerol is formed from phospholipase C-catalyzed hydrolysis of PIP2 and is the physiologic activator of protein kinase C. PIP2 hydrolysis was assayed in soluble and particulate fractions prepared from keratome biopsies of normal and psoriatic skin. Total lipids were extracted from normal and psoriatic epidermis and 1,2-diradylglycerol (a mixture of 1,2-diacylglycerol and 1-ether, 2-acyl-glycerol) quantitated by enzyme assay. Because 1,2-diacylglycerol is a more potent activator of protein kinase C, the relative proportions of 1,2-diacyl and 1-ether, 2-acylglycerol in uninvolved and involved psoriatic epidermis were determined. This was accomplished by separation of acetate derivatives of 1,2-diacylglycerol and 1-ether, 2-acyl-glycerol by thin layer chromatography. Soluble and membrane-associated phospholipase C-catalyzed PIP2 hydrolysis were increased 3.7 times (p less than 0.001) and 3 times (p less than 0.004), respectively, in psoriatic involved compared to uninvolved and normal epidermis. 1,2-diradylglycerol content was also significantly elevated (3 times, p less than 0.01) in psoriatic involved versus uninvolved and normal epidermis. Analysis of the acetate derivatives of 1,2-diradylglycerol in psoriatic uninvolved and involved epidermis revealed that 1,2-diacylglycerol was the major species (86% and 95%, respectively). There were no significant differences in either phospholipase C-catalyzed PIP2 hydrolysis or 1,2-diacylglycerol content between uninvolved and normal epidermis. 1,2-diacylglycerol purified from normal and involved psoriatic epidermis was capable of activating protein kinase C from normal epidermis in vitro. In epidermal slices, activation of protein kinase C by addition of 12-0-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate and 1,2-diacylglycerol (1,2-dioctanoylglycerol) resulted in subsequently decreased protein kinase C activity, a process termed down-regulation. These data are consistent with the possibility that the elevation in lesional 1,2-diacylglycerol content may account, in part, for the previously reported reduction of protein kinase C activity in psoriasis (Horn, Marks, Fisher, et al: J Invest Dermatol 88:220-222, 1987).\r"

  ".W": "The development of growth conditions for human melanocytes from uninvolved skin from vitiligo patients and age-matched normal adults is a prerequisite to understanding the etiology of this pigmentary disorder. By using new growth conditions, pure melanocyte cultures were prepared from normal adults and the pigmented skin of vitiligo donors. Both cell types grew without a lag period and were maintained for more than six months (4-8 passages). The cultures could be expanded from several thousand melanocytes in the original cell suspension to several million cells (2-7 x 10(6] in pure culture. To obtain these results, the current standard conditions for the culture of fetal melanocytes were substantially modified. MEM-S medium was less satisfactory than MCDB-153. Adult normal and vitiligo cells also required the presence of exogenous catalase (20 micrograms/ml) during isolation and primary seeding. Thereafter, this enzyme was not necessary. Melanocytes grew best and gave the highest yields if the concentrations of both calcium (200 microM) and the phorbol ester 12-0-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) were low (4-8 nM). Other growth factors included in the MCDB-153 media were bFGF, crude bovine pituitary extract, insulin, transferrin, hydrocortisone, 5% FCS, and the antioxidant alpha-tocopherol. Cholera toxin and isobutylmethylxanthine (IBMX) were omitted from the MCDB-153 growth medium because they slowed down growth even at very low concentrations. The results indicate adult and vitiligo melanocytes can be cultured. Preliminary studies of the normal and vitiligo cells indicate that vitiligo melanocytes retain some of the ultrastructural abnormalities observed in skin even when grown in culture.\r"

LC are immediately competent, however, if an immunogenic peptide rather than the intact protein is the immunogen, indicating that resident or unchallenged LC have the required class II MHC and can provide the signals necessary for T-cell proliferation but may lack the capacity to internalize or cleave protein antigens. We propose that delayed antigen presentation by LC may be intrinsic and advantageous for promoting early systemic immunity. LC stimulate cloned T h1 and T h2 cells equally well, suggesting that LC may not limit or bias the type of immunity that occurs with cutaneous antigenic challenge.\r"

  ".U": "91010901\r", 
  ".W": "The keratin patterns of human epidermal keratinocytes cultured on a 3T3-feeder layer in the presence of 10(-8) M non-aromatic (all-trans retinoic acid and 13-cis retinoic acid) and polyaromatic (arotinoid, arotinoid-sulfone, and free arotinoic-acid) retinoids were analyzed by high resolution one- and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting. Laser densitometric evaluation of one-dimensional gels allowed to quantitate the changes within the keratin patterns and revealed an increase in the expression of keratins K13, K15, and K19 as induced by both non-aromatic and polyaromatic retinoids, except for the parent compound arotinoid. This would then indicate that such keratinocytes are pursuing a more embryonic type of differentiation. In evaluating the data for the hyperproliferation-associated keratins K6 and K16 we noticed an unexpected result: except for all-trans retinoic acid, these two keratins showed opposite responses. As compared to control cultures, the amount of K6 did generally increase, while K16 was reduced, with arotinoid acid being the most effective retinoid. The apparently uncoupled expression of K6 and K16 appeared also to be concentration dependent when 13-cis retinoic acid at concentrations of 10(-9), 10(-8), and 10(-7) M was analyzed. Considering the overall antiproliferative potency of retinoids, we therefore conclude that K16 alone, rather than the pair K6/K16, should be regarded as a proliferation-related keratin and as such may be used as a sensitive marker to evaluate keratinocyte proliferation.\r"

We find that when the length-to-width ratio of the columns is increased, the mixed cellulose bed also fractionates the red cells. Measurement of mean cell volume, mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, hemoglobin level, deformability index, and cell density showed that deformability is the physical property of the erythrocyte that forms the basis for the fractionation. This is a separation modality that complements the numerous density gradient techniques for red cells. The following experimental results can be obtained by using the technique: (1) The number of cells with a defined degree of rigidity can be quantitated in an erythrocyte population. (2) Large numbers of cells that differ with respect to their deformability can be isolated. (3) Application of the method to sickle cells has quantitated the remarkable heterogeneity of these cells with regard to their deformability.\r"

The sIL-2R level was measured serially in patients with SCLC both during and after therapy. The mean serum level of sIL-2R in patients with SCLC was 3.8 times higher than that of 47 healthy controls and was 1.9 times higher than in 37 patients with non-SCLC. Six patients with SCLC had very high levels of sIL-2R, ranging from five to 52 times the mean level observed in normal controls. Tumor cells in the pleural fluid of the patient with highest levels were positive with monoclonal antibodies to IL-2R (CD25), NKH-1, OKDR, and OKT9. A longitudinal study in this patient showed a good correlation between tumor activity and sIL-2R levels. Also, the sIL-2R levels decreased in patients responding to therapy. These results suggest that some SCLCs secrete sIL-2R and that the serial measurements of the serum sIL-2R levels can be used as a noninvasive tumor marker in this disease.\r"

To evaluate whether captopril has an acute antiproteinuric effect and to evaluate the role of changes in renal hemodynamics or glomerular permselectivity on this effect, renal clearance studies were performed in patients without diabetes but with nephrosis. Protein excretion and renal hemodynamics were measured at baseline and after the administration of captopril. To measure the contribution of renal prostaglandins, patients were restudied on a separate day, after the combined administration of captopril and the prostaglandin synthetase inhibitor ibuprofen. Both treatments significantly reduced mean protein excretion, but the change was greater with combined therapy than with captopril alone (40.6% vs 20.0%). Mean glomerular filtration rate (GFR) decreased by 4.8% (not significant) and 16.5% (p less than 0.001), and filtration fraction (FF) decreased by 13.6% (p less than 0.001) and 14.9% (p less than 0.001) after captopril alone and combined therapy, respectively. No significant correlation was found between changes in proteinuria and changes in GFR or FF after treatment with captopril alone. In contrast, the decrease in proteinuria correlated with the change in GFR after combined drug administration (r = 0.68, p = 0.06). The ratio of immunoglobulin G to albumin clearance, an index of glomerular permselectivity, was unaffected by captopril but decreased significantly (by 43%) after combined drug administration. The results suggest that the acute antiproteinuric effect of captopril is not due to changes in FF, GFR, or glomerular perselectivity. The addition of ibuprofen enhances the antiproteinuric effect of captopril by decreasing the GFR as well as by enhancing the permselectivity of the glomerular capillary membrane.\r"

In the present study we examined urinary albumin, protein, and thromboxane B2 (TXB2) excretion during the 170 days after induction of diabetes by injection of streptozotocin in insulin-treated moderately hyperglycemic (200 to 400 mg/dl glucose) rats (SDRs). The effects of a thromboxane synthesis inhibitor, 4'-(imidazol-1-yl)acetophenone (TXI) (100 mg/kg/day) on these parameters were also assessed. Urinary TXB2 and albumin excretion in SDRs was not different from that in normal rats between 7 and 90 days but were three times higher than normal in SDRs at 125 and 170 days after induction of diabetes. In SDRs, urinary protein excretion was higher than in controls at 170 days but not at earlier time points. Inulin clearance (CIn) of SDRs was significantly higher than control values at 7 and 90 days and was not influenced by TXI during this period. At 170 days CIn was not significantly different in SDRs and normal rats. By contrast, albumin clearance (CAIb) and fractional CAIb were elevated in SDRs when compared with those values in normal rats. Treatment of SDRs with TXI for 170 days completely prevented the rise in urinary TXB2, albumin, and protein excretion, as well as the rise in fractional CAIb, but did not alter prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) excretion. TXI also increased CIn in SDRs to levels that were significantly higher than normal at 170 days. TXI had no significant effect on urinary PGE2, TXB2, albumin, or protein excretion or on CIn in normal rats and did not influence blood pressure or blood glucose in normal rats or SDRs. The results suggest a role for thromboxane in the mediation of albuminuria in the SDR.\r"

  ".W": "Two different methods for evaluating platelet antibody were used to study 12 normal subjects and 24 patients consisting primarily of intravenous drug users (IVDUs) who were positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Total platelet-associated immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin M (IgM) were measured by enzyme-lined immunosorbent assay on platelet lysate, and platelet surface-associated IgG and IgM were measured by semiquantitative flow cytometry. IgG and IgM values showed significant correlations between the two measurement methods. Mean platelet surface IgG and total IgG were 3.6 and 4.3 times greater, respectively, in IVDUs than in controls, and platelet IgM was also significantly higher in IVDUs than in controls as measured by both techniques. Although mean platelet immunoglobulin levels were higher in the IVDUs with thrombocytopenia than in IVDUs with normal platelet counts, these differences did not achieve significance. These data show that platelet IgG and IgM levels are increased in IVDU-associated HIV infection and suggest that these increases are not confined to patients manifesting thrombocytopenia. The herein described platelet surface antibody and total platelet antibody measurements appear to be equally useful in studying this patient population. Specific details for generating platelet-associated immunofluorescence units are discussed.\r"

  ".W": "Three hemophilia B patients with anti-factor IX antibodies who had no detectable gross deletion of the factor IX gene by Southern blotting analysis were investigated at the molecular level. All eight exons, accompanied by their splicing junction sites and presumptive promoter regions of the factor IX gene in these patients (total 5.5 kb in length) were amplified with the use of the polymerase chain reaction, followed by complete nucleotide sequence analysis. Three different types of novel single base substitutions and a 2 base-pair nucleotide deletion were identified. Patient HB-5 had two point mutations in his factor IX gene. One was located at the promoter region at nucleotide -793 and the other (C-to-T transition) was found in exon VI of the gene changing Gln-191 to a stop codon. Patient HB-6 had a point mutation (G-to-A) in the splice acceptor site, which interrupted the normal splicing of the last intron G. A small two-nucleotide deletion in exon III was detected in patient HB-7 and yielded frameshifted amino acids and terminated by a stop codon. These resuslts suggest that not only the gross gene deletion of factor IX gene but also the point mutations or small nucleotide deletion that may cause the interruption of coding informations for mature protein synthesis is predisposed to development of anti-factor IX inhibitors in patients with hemophilia B.\r"

  ".W": "Long-term phenylhydrazine (PHZ) treatment caused pronounced anemia and a concomitant increase in the numbers of circulating leukocytes in Long-Evans rats. The leukocytosis was caused mainly by an elevation in mononuclear cells, most notably in the lymphocyte population. PHZ has been reported to cause the direct lysis of erythrocytes by nonimmune mechanisms. However, recent reports indicate that PHZ can cross-link red cell band 3 protein (senescent antigen), resulting in the binding of autologous immunoglobulin G (IgG). Recognition of this complex by macrophage Fc receptor mechanisms triggers rapid erythrophagocytosis-in the spleen and possibly the liver as well. In our study, analysis of the blood, bone marrow, and spleen cells of long-term (1 to 6 weeks) PHZ-treated rats was performed by using flow cytometry. Total serum IgG levels were determined by radial immunodiffusion, and antibodies reactive with red cells that were sensitized to PHZ either in vivo or in vitro were titered by using the indirect Coombs' method. Serum prostaglandin E2 titers also were determined at different time intervals after PHZ administration. The results indicate that PHZ induces an increase in circulating antibody and prostaglandin E2 titers that correlates with the onset of anemia and that the serum of PHZ-treated rats can induce anemia in normal recipients after passive transfer. Cytofluorographic studies revealed a marked increase in the B-cell population of the peripheral blood and spleen and an altered ratio T-helper to T-suppressor cells at certain time intervals after PHZ injection. The results indicate that in addition to inducing senescence-like alterations in erythrocyte membrane proteins, PHZ stimulates the production of the autologous IgG that recognizes these sites and promotes lymphoid blastogenesis, most notably in the B-cell lineage.\r"

Antibodies in sera from one of these patients stained normal GBM, Bowman's capsule, tubular basement membranes, and epidermal basement membranes but did not stain tissues from an unrelated Alport male. The target antigen was found to be a 26 kd peptide of the noncollagenous domain of basement membrane collagen. This study provides further evidence of the importance of abnormalities of basement membrane collagen in the pathogenesis of the Alport nephropathy. We speculate that certain mutations at the Alport locus, such as large intragenic deletions or frame-shift mutations, may be associated with failure to develop immune tolerance to epitopes on this 26kd peptide. In the setting of permissive immune response and regulation, transplantation of a normal kidney may result in the generation of anti-GBM antibodies.\r"

  ".W": "Microheterogeneity of connective tissue activation peptide III (CTAP-III) was revealed by preparative and analytical isoelectric focusing. Proteolytic activities in human platelet preparations resulted in four cleavage products of platelet-derived CTAP-III. Three isoforms (CTAP-III des 1-13, des 1-14, and des 1-15/NAP-2) stimulate [14C]glycosaminoglycan synthesis; two isoforms also promote [3H]DNA synthesis in human fibroblast cultures. Elastase (from porcine pancreas) cleavage of human platelet-derived CTAP-III and rCTAP-III-Leu-21 to the des 1-15 isoforms was associated with either preservation of specific anabolic biologic activity or an actual increase in specific activity. Nonenzymatic glycosylation of lysyl residues and deamination of the NH2-terminal asparagine of platelet-derived CTAP-III were commonly present, but did not correlate with the biologic activities that were measured. Protein sequence homology shows CTAP-III and its isoforms to be members of a family of proteins (including NAP-1/II-8, MGSA, and platelet factor-4) known to be associated with growth, wound repair, inflammation, and neoplasia. The consequences of proteolytic processing reported here for CTAP-III may be characteristic of the other proteins in this group.\r"

After incubation of the synthesized octapeptide (Leu-Ser-Thr-Thr-Glu-Val-Ala-Met) from the N-amino terminus of glycophorin A, with anti-N antibody, there was significant inhibition of the agglutination of the N-positive cells. There was also inhibition of the agglutination of the M-positive cells with anti-M antibody by the synthesized octapeptide (Ser-Ser-Thr-Thr-Gly-Val-Ala-Met) from the M-amino terminus of glycophorin A. There was no inhibition, however, of the agglutination of M-positive cells with anti-M antibodies by the N-amino terminal octapeptide. Likewise, the M-amino terminal octapeptide did not inhibit agglutination of N-positive cells with anti-N. Because the synthesized octapeptides contained no carbohydrate, the anti-N and anti-M specificity appears to be determined principally by the peptides themselves. Further studies with the use of chimeric peptides indicate that the amino terminal amino acid leucine of N-glycophorin A is a primary determinant of the N antigen, whereas the amino terminal serine of M-glycophorin A is a primary determinant for the M antigen.\r"

  ".W": "To define a more sensitive and reliable method to determine changes in the overall cellular characteristics of erythrocytes after oxidative damage, we used a viscodiffractometric method (ektacytometry) to measure the effect of oxidative stress. Erythrocytes were incubated in the presence of hydrogen peroxide, t-butyl hydroperoxide, or cumene hydroperoxide in phosphate buffer. This treatment resulted in decreased cellular deformability of the intact erythrocytes. In addition, deformability and fragility measurements of the erythrocyte ghost membranes indicated an increased membrane dynamic rigidity and altered-mechanical stability as a consequence of oxidant stress. These changes were observed before the onset of hemolysis. The observed decrease in deformability was accompanied by oxidation of hemoglobin, alterations of membrane proteins, and lipid peroxidation. To continuously measure the time course of the decrease in deformability in intact erythrocytes under oxidative stress, a new ektacytometric method was developed. Erythrocytes were oxidatively challenged within the viscometer at a constant osmolality and shear stress. The change in deformability was monitored and a typical range was defined for erythrocytes from normal individuals. Comparison of erythrocytes from patients with sickle cell disease with those from normal individuals demonstrated a higher susceptibility of sickle red cells toward oxidative stress.\r"

We have studied the possible relationship of production of insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II) by these tumors and the development of hypoglycemia. Mean IGF-II concentration was not significantly higher in 23 patients with hypoglycemia than in nine patients with euglycemia (542 +/- 61 [SE] micrograms/L vs 382 +/- 52 micrograms/L). Serum IGF-I was more suppressed in patients with hypoglycemia (16 +/- 3 micrograms/L) than in patients with euglycemia (57 +/- 18 micrograms/L). Because an increased percentage of IGF-II in serum of patients with hypoglycemia who have other tumors is present as partially processed pro-IGF-II (\"big\" IGF-II), we passed sera of patients with hypoglycemia and patients with euglycemia with hepatomas through acidic Bio-Gel P-60 columns. We found that 57% +/- 4.6% of the IGF-II in sera from patients with hypoglycemia was present as big IGF-II compared with 22% +/- 3% in patients with euglycemia with hepatomas (not significantly different from that in normal controls). Four of 11 apparently healthy control subjects who were hepatitis B virus positive also had increased percentages of big IGF-II, suggesting that abnormal processing of pro-IGF-II may result from subtle changes in liver function with this infection. It remains to be determined whether these subjects with increased big IGF-II are at increased risk for the development of hepatomas. In conclusion, we have confirmed marked suppression of IGF-I in the sera of patients with hepatoma and hypoglycemia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

A statistically significant relationship was found between the frequency of headaches (P = .03) with level of depression. In fact, 74% of patients with headaches recurring almost every day had a clinically significant depression diagnosed as defined by the Zung SDS score. The Zung SDS score also correlated with the length of time that the problem of headache existed (P less than .05). Item analysis of the individual 20-item depression score revealed that four questions accounted for 93% of the variance. This analysis suggests that shorter, more abbreviated screening questions could be developed and refined in the future for use by the busy clinician. Headache is an important marker for depression in the primary care setting. It can be inferred from this study that the clinician may need to focus more on treating the entity of depression than on treating just the symptom of headache.\r"

A subgroup of 120 persons with levels higher than 6.21 mmol/L (240 mg/dL) were contacted 4 to 6 months after the screening. Most of this group reported improvement in diet and exercise patterns, and 58% had consulted a physician. These results suggest that people with known hypercholesterolemia are using community screening programs to monitor their own cholesterol levels, and that such programs identity new high-risk individuals. Program participants appear to change diet and exercise patterns and to seek physician follow-up.\r"

Physicians or office nurses were asked to complete a brief face sheet on their patient's demographic information and smoking status, which was linked to the questionnaire through a code number. Twenty-seven percent of female patients and 16% of male patients were smoking and 57% had tried smoking. Knowledge regarding health risks of smoking was high, and the major reasons given for starting to smoke were curiosity and peer behavior. Current smokers reported greater alcohol and marijuana use and cited problems with stress and anxiety, peer behavior, boredom, and the influence of smoking parents and relatives as factors in continuing to smoke. Patients' suggestions for successful smoking cessation focused on peers, explicit messages through pictures, and medication.\r"

Measurements were undertaken according to the standards set by the American Heart Association. Sensitivity of the finger blood pressure measurement was 76% for systolic and 75% for diastolic blood pressure in diagnosis of high blood pressure (systolic greater than 140 mm Hg and diastolic greater than 90 mm Hg). Specificity was 86% for systolic and 82% for diastolic blood pressure. Positive predictive values were 58% for systolic and 38% for diastolic blood pressure in the study population in which prevalence of hypertension was 12%. The correlation coefficient (Pearson) for systolic values between devices was 0.76 (P less than .0001) and 0.57 (P less than .0001) for diastolic pressure. Values obtained by the finger monitor were found to be higher than those obtained by the mercury sphygmomanometer. Mean differences and standard deviations (paired t test) for systolic and diastolic pressures between the two devices were 2.3 +/- 14.9 mm Hg (P less than .08) and 2.9 +/- 14.5 mm Hg (P less than .02), respectively. These values are not in accordance with the proposed national standards because only 48% of the systolic and 37% of the diastolic blood pressure measurements were within 5 mm Hg of the mercury sphygmomanometer measurements. Therefore, although these differences may well be due to different techniques of monitoring employed by the devices, this device is not recommended for evaluation of blood pressure.\r"

  ".U": "91011292\r", 
  ".W": "Much has been written on how physicians should manage patients in emotional distress, including recommendations for making successful referrals to mental health providers. Little has been written, however, on the management of distressed patients who are already in psychotherapy. This article, drawing on three cases, a review of the literature, and systems theory, presents recommendations for managing these patients. Physicians are encouraged to assess these patients for risk of suicide or homicide, substance abuse, and indications for psychotropic medication. They are advised to seek a patient's permission to speak to his or her therapist when the patient may be in immediate danger, when psychotropic medications, hospitalization, or psychiatric consultation is considered, and when the patient fails to respond to ongoing treatment. For patients whose therapists are not psychiatrists, psychiatric consultation is recommended when there are questions about psychotropic medications, when psychiatric and substance abuse disorders coexist, and when hospitalization is considered. Therapists skilled in applying systems theory should be consulted when the patient, psychotherapist, and physician agree that the patient is not making sufficient progress. In most cases, however, physicians should reassure patients about distressing symptoms, avoid expressing opinions about the therapist and psychosocial issues, and encourage patients to renew or to expand their commitment to their psychotherapy.\r"

  ".W": "A study was performed to determine whether family practice residents followed recommendations made by a comprehensive geriatric assessment clinic. Of 109 consecutive consultations, 27 patients had follow-up visits with family practice residents who participated in the assessment and who subsequently served as their primary care physicians. Adherence of residents to 437 clinic recommendations was monitored for 90 days by medical record review. Although recommendations to begin or increase a medication were followed 85.4% of the time, residents followed recommendations to stop or decrease medications less than 65% of the time. Recommendations to order a specific laboratory test or x-ray examination were acted on 70.3% of the time. Preventive recommendations were followed only 54.3% of the time. Residents' adherence to team-based care plans varied widely by type of recommendation. Special efforts are needed to increase compliance with comprehensive geriatric assessment clinic recommendations, particularly those for preventive services.\r"

  ".W": "Benzodiazepines can be prescribed for a number of medical conditions. Many physicians are reluctant to prescribe benzodiazepines out of fear of producing dependence in patients and incurring the disapproval of their peers. Studies of psychotropic drug use and abuse demonstrate that individuals using benzodiazepines for treatment of a medical illness rarely demonstrate tolerance to the therapeutic action of the medication or escalate the dose. Eighty percent of benzodiazepines are prescribed for 6 months or less, and elderly women are the most common long-term users of low-dose benzodiazepines. In contrast, recreational use of benzodiazepines is associated with polysubstance abuse, lack of medical supervision, rapid tolerance to the euphoric or sedating side effect, and escalation of dose. Most recreational users of benzodiazepines are young men. Documentation of indication for use, collection of drug-abuse history, close monitoring, and drug holidays can improve the management of this class of medication.\r"

This study examined the output of primary care physicians by a state-supported medical school that has a goal of placing 50% of its graduates in primary care. Data were obtained from alumni office questionnaires and published board-certification listings for 1102 graduates of the University of Kentucky College of Medicine from 1973 through 1983. Fifty percent of these graduates chose residency training in primary care. Of all 1102 graduates, 37% are categorized as practicing primary care physicians; 29% of the total are board certified in a primary care discipline. Attrition from primary care as an initial career choice at entry into residency was 26%. With declining medical student interest in primary care and a shortage of primary care physicians, new initiatives in medical education and in the practice of medicine are necessary to balance the specialty distribution of physicians more favorably toward primary care.\r"

While the average duration of maximum improvement lasted about 11 weeks after an injection (range seven weeks in patients with hand dystonia to 15 weeks in patients with hemifacial spasm), some patients benefited for over a year. Only 16% of the 941 treatment visits with follow up were not successful. Except for transient focal weakness, there were very few complications or systemic effects attributed to the injections. This study supports the conclusion that botulinum toxin injections are a safe and effective therapy for patients with focal dystonia and hemifacial spasm.\r"

The mean follow up period was 8.4 months. In 39 patients with pain there was benefit in 77% of treatment periods. Some improvement in neck posture occurred in 83% of the treatment periods with a mean duration of 12 weeks. Side effects were frequent with dysphagia being the most common (28% of treatment periods). Botulinum toxin is an effective treatment for toticollis but treatment should be initiated with doses at the lower end of the range used in this study (400-600 mouse units).\r"

Six isolated spinal lesions presented more insidiously and morbidity was related to incomplete resection. Twelve (23%) of the patients definitely had von Hippel-Lindau disease (VHLD). The true proportion may be higher as this diagnosis was not definitely excluded in many of the remainder; only ten patients with seemingly isolated cerebellar tumours were appropriately investigated and two had evidence of VHLD. Four out of 26 cases (15%) with apparently completely resected, isolated, cerebellar lesions later developed recurrent tumours. Brainstem and supratentorial haemangioblastomas were rare and were always associated with VHLD. The cerebellar or spinal haemangioblastomas due to VHLD had no distinctive clinical features compared with isolated tumours and there was considerable overlap in age of onset between the two groups of cases. All patients with an apparently isolated CNS haemangioblastoma should be investigated for evidence of von Hippel-Lindau disease.\r"

There were numerous vesicles 0.1 to 2 microns in diameter produced by dilatations of the sarcoplasmic reticulum in fibres depleted of myofibrils. Four patients developed a myopathy while receiving zidovudine for AIDS. One of these had an inflammatory myopathy which showed the development of vesicular change due to enlargement and electron lucency of mitochondria. The three other patients with ARC developed muscle pains or weakness and elevated serum CK while on zidovudine. These patients also showed vesicular changes due to enlargement and electron lucency of mitochondria associated with disruption of sarcomeres and the presence of cytoplasmic bodies. The muscular symptoms resolved when ziduvodine was stopped and repeat biopsy in one case revealed no abnormalities.\r"

Patients could be divided into two distinct categories, one with low levels of antibody in the serum and absent antibody in the CSF, and the other with high levels in both the serum and the CSF. This differentiation matched the clinical presentation of a benign and a malignant group. Antibody levels could not be related to the type of cysts as observed on the brain scan, but depended on the anatomical position of the cyst, being lower if the cysts were confined to the cerebral cortex. A correlation of antibody levels with the number of cysts was only found in the benign group.\r"

The task consisted of drawing triangles with the dominant hand and squeezing a rubber bulb with the nondominant hand. Motor performance was measured using the variables: amplitude of squeezing, frequency of squeezing and velocity of drawing triangles. After eliminating variance due to baseline differences in single-handed performance, the bimanual simultaneous performance of PD and controls turned out to be similar to the frequency of squeezing and the velocity of drawing triangles. The amplitude of squeezing, however, differed between the two groups: it was significantly reduced in PD. Arguably the disturbance in the bimanual performance of PD patients was not due to a disorder of time sharing, but to a decreased ability to shift attention from the visually cued task to the non visually cued task. The results agree with current evidence that PD patients are more impaired when they have to rely upon internal control for the regulation of shifting attention than when external cues are available.\r"

For controls, practice led to a selective decrease in choice RTs, as has been reported previously. An opposite effect was seen in the PD group, with little change in choice RTs and substantial reduction in simple RTs. The results suggest that PD subjects can use advance information to initiate discrete movements more rapidly, but that this ability to \"preprogramme\" movements requires practice. Reconciliation of these results with studies reporting an inability to preprogramme in PD are made in a discussion of task characteristics which may allow or preclude preprogramming.\r"

Little is known about the effects of such stimuli on other aspects of cortical function. In the study single magnetic stimuli, subthreshold for movement, produced significant preference for selection of one hand in a forced-choice task. The hand preference depended upon the direction of the induced current. It occurred when the coil was positioned over frontal but not occipital cortex and was not mimicked by weak DC stimulation. Single magnetic stimuli which do not evoke movement can alter high-level motor planning.\r"

Risk factor specificity and sensitivity may be further reduced if, in the former case, the risk factor is related to other illnesses having the same clinical presentation as the disease of interest, or if, in the latter case, the risk factor disappears with the onset of illness. We illustrate these points in a discussion of the utility of smoking as a diagnostic test for malignancy in two clinical situations, the patient with asymptomatic microscopic hematuria and the patient with a solitary pulmonary nodule. Risk factors hold great promise as aids to medical diagnosis, as this information is readily available to clinicians at little or no cost. Clinicians, however, should exercise caution when using risk factors of unproven diagnostic utility in medical diagnosis, as their presence may have little or no effect on disease probability.\r"

  ".W": "High blood pressure (BP) defines a prognostically heterogeneous group. Because BP varies according to time, setting and means of observation, it has been postulated that BP reactivity might better predict cardiovascular disease (CVD) than does unidimensional measurements. To assess BP reactivity, the difference between pretreatment nurse (RN) and physician (MD) diastolic BP (DBP)--systematically recorded in that order--or MD-RN DBP, was obtained in 1737 previously untreated patients with sustained, RN BP greater than or equal to 160 and/or 95 mmHg. Patients stratified by tertiles of MD-RN DBP [(I) less than or equal to - 3, (II) -2 to 3 and (III) greater than or equal to 4 mmHg] were similar by sex, race, age, body mass index, cholesterol, electrocardiography, prior CVD, smoking and pretreatment or attained in-treatment BPs. During 14 years of followup, myocardial infarction (MI) incidence per 1000/year were, tertile I (3.2), II (3.7), III (7.6) (relative risk = 2.4, III vs I + II, p less than 0.05), whereas stroke incidence and non-CVD mortality were evenly distributed. By Cox survival analysis, controlling for other entry characteristics only age, sex and DBP reactivity remained predictive (p less than or equal to 0.03) of MI or total CVD. Thus, BP reactivity, probably a centrally-mediated phenomenon, identifies a subgroup of hypertensives with an increased propensity for MI despite successful BP control.\r"

Until the end of 1986, 195 subjects who said they were never-smokers died. Mortality was analyzed using the proportional hazards model of Cox. In addition to measures of ventilatory function, the mortality analysis included age, sex, body-mass index, alcohol consumption, school education, diabetes mellitus, heart disease and bronchial asthma as confounding factors. Forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) as a percentage of that predicted, forced vital capacity (FVC) as a percentage of that predicted and the ratio of FEV1 to FVC were significant risk factors for mortality among both sexes. The relative risk of death associated with a 50% decrease in FEV1 and FVC as a percentage of a predicted value was 1.65 and 1.81, respectively. This study confirms that lowered ventilatory function is a strong risk factor for mortality among never-smokers of both sexes.\r"

Economic analyses in which the benefits of risk factor modification are estimated often reflect this. This paper explains how predictive models based on the simplest form of the multiple logistic function inevitably predict greater benefit from cholesterol lowering in those in whom other risk factors are adverse; this results from the model itself, rather than the data. CHD death rates from the screenee population of the Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial are examined: these suggest that the relationship between cholesterol and both other major risk factors is closer to additive than to multiplicative. When the benefits of cholesterol lowering are estimated, a model based on additive risk, specifying product (\"interaction\") terms, is to be preferred.\r"

The average duration of hospitalization, however, was not statistically different in matched pairs analysis (z = 0.95, p greater than 0.05). The 136 excess hospitalizations of the diabetic subjects included 45 admissions for poor metabolic control of diabetes, 50 excess admissions for infectious disease, and 26 excess admissions for conditions of the heart, eye, kidney, or non-traumatic amputation. In multivariate analyses, variables found to be associated with greater hospitalization experience among the 77 diabetic subjects in the 12 years follow-up period included older age at entry to the study, poorer metabolic control early in the study period, and presence of diabetic complications.\r"

This relationship proved to be largely independent of body mass index, body fat distribution, alcohol and tobacco consumption, and parental history of hypertension. An increased WBC may reflect greater sympathetic tone or may directly increase peripheral vascular resistance by impeding circulation through small blood vessels. If confirmed, this study adds another condition to the growing list for which the WBC is predictive. This simple, cheap test should be considered for inclusion in prospective epidemiological studies of many different diseases.\r"

Women had higher fibrinogen levels than men. In both sexes, multivariate analysis showed that fibrinogen was positively associated with age, smoking, total cholesterol and body mass index and negatively associated with alcohol consumption. Among women, early menopause and systolic blood pressure were also associated with fibrinogen levels. Univariate analyses showed weak positive associations with fish consumption for both sexes although only male white fish consumption entered the final model. Women with a history of contraceptive pill usage had significantly lower fibrinogen levels. The relationship between fibrinogen and physical activity was complex, and could largely be explained by smoking. These findings support the hypothesis that raised fibrinogen is one mechanism by which several major risk factors may promote coronary heart disease. However, known risk factors explained, at most, 10% of the total variance in fibrinogen levels among the general population.\r"

In the absence of heterogeneity of variance, significant heterogeneity in LDL:lnTrig and lnTrig:Apo AII covariation was found between genders in the parental generation. In the presence of heterogeneity of variance, significant heterogeneity of correlation between genders and/or across generations was found for the HDL-C:LDL-C, Total-C:LDL-C, Total-C:lnTrig, lnTrig:LDL-C, Total-C:lnApo E and HDL-C:lnApo E bivariate distributions. Analyses of principal components revealed that the generation and gender specific cohorts have similar eigenvalues but distinct eigenvectors for the first two principal components underlying the seven dimensional lipid and apolipoprotein distribution. We conclude that the amount of variability explained by the first two principal components is the same across cohorts but how the interindividual variability is distributed among the lipid and apolipoprotein traits is generation and gender specific. This study documents the role that variance and covariance might play in determining risk of disease for special subgroups of the population at large. It also demonstrates how variances and covariances between risk factors traits characterize life processes of aging and sexual dimorphism. This study argues that future biometrical genetic and epidemiological studies of coronary artery disease must take into account age and gender effects on interindividual variability and covariability of risk factors.\r"

One, the indirect method, is widely used but the other, the direct method, seems less well-known, despite it being a rather more obvious approach. To implement either requires some knowledge of misclassification rates and it may be possible to estimate these by a validation study. Depending on how sampling for such a study is done, one has the choice of what method to use. Formulae for the variance of estimates are derived and the precision of the methods compared. The direct approach is found to be more efficient.\r"

During a 15-year follow-up 393 male and 283 female deaths were identified. Analyses were conducted separately in a lower and an upper range of BMI (as well as over the entire range), to isolate separate effects of low weight and high weight on mortality. Particular attention was also paid to potential bias from cigarette smoking and antecedent illness. Cox regression analyses showed that over the entire range of BMI the adjusted BMI-mortality association was significantly J-shaped for the men and essentially flat for the women. The inverse association between BMI and mortality in the lower range of BMI was statistically significant for the men; the adjusted relative hazard increasing from the 10th to the 50th percentile of BMI was 0.76 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.59-0.98). The positive association between BMI and mortality in the upper range of BMI was highly statistically significant for the men; the adjusted relative hazard increasing from the 50th to the 90th percentile of BMI was 1.37 (95% CI 1.14-1.63). Whether controlled by multivariate analysis, by excluding the first 5 years of follow-up from the analyses, or by analyzing the BMI-mortality association in smoking-specific and/or illness-specific subgroups, smoking and antecedent illness did not have much impact on the BMI-mortality association, in either sex. The general observations on the BMI-mortality association are similar to findings in some white cohorts.\r"

The traditional multiplicative model parsimoniously characterizes the individual and joint effects of age and high blood pressure in terms of risk ratios; but, for smoking and cholesterol, an additive model appears to be the most parsimonious. We discuss the consequences of these observations for the study and prevention of cardiovascular disease in the elderly.\r"

Over the 17-year period, there was a steady increase in the percentage of women receiving conservative therapies, from 11.8% in 1969 to 50.3% in 1985. Younger women, unmarried women and American Indian women were more likely to receive conservative therapy. This marked shift in therapeutic approach occurred during a time of apparent controversy as to the optimal treatment for cervical carcinoma in situ, and illustrates a rapid change in surgical practice in the absence of any controlled trials comparing the two major treatment modalities.\r"

An alternative conceptual approach, the \"severity model\" of headache, considers a continuum of headache ranging from mild to severe forms with specific headache subtypes distinguished by level of severity rather than unique constellations of symptoms. A population-based telephone interview was carried out among 10,169 subjects aged 12-29 to estimate the prevalence of serious headaches and better characterize symptoms that accompany headache attacks. In an analysis of frequency of occurrence, pain and duration of recent (within 4 weeks prior to interview) headache attacks, the data revealed that common symptoms (such as forehead pain and pain in the back of the head, neck and shoulders) were reported frequently, but headaches with these symptoms were generally characterized by low levels of pain and short duration. Although not an original study objective, the data were analyzed to determine whether distinct symptom constellations could be identified or whether symptoms overlapped between headache types. Symptoms of migraine were frequently experienced concomitant with tension-type symptoms; the resultant headaches were usually characterized as moderate in intensity. In contrast, symptoms usually associated with migraine in the absence of concomitant tension-type symptoms were infrequently experienced, but resulted in headaches causing the greatest disability. The data provide some support for the severity model of headache.\r"

A stepwise regression procedure showed the possibility to reliably predict the total score of the unabridged versions by means of weighted sums of eight items for each scale. Omission of weights did not lead to substantial loss of information. Cronbach's alpha of the State-scale decreased from 0.93 to about 0.85 for different combinations of items and from 0.91 to about 0.82 for combinations of eight items of the Trait-scale. The relationship between both scales was only slightly modified by the shortening procedure.\r"

  ".W": "Twenty-two patients with recurrent small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) were treated with single-agent etoposide 50 mg/m2/d by mouth for 21 consecutive days. Eleven patients had received previous chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and vincristine (CAV) or etoposide (CAE) or both (CAVE). Four of the latter patients also received salvage treatment with cisplatin and etoposide (EP). Nine patients had been treated with EP as induction therapy, while two patients had received high-dose cyclophosphamide, etoposide and cisplatin (HDCEP). Altogether, 18 patients had received previous intravenous etoposide. The median time off chemotherapy was 4.5 months (range, 1 to 28.9 months). Ten patients (45.5%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 27% to 65%) achieved a complete or partial response. Responses were most common in patients who had responded to previous chemotherapy and who had not received any treatment in the 90 days before initiation of oral etoposide. Median response duration was 4 months (range, 1.5 to 9.5 months) and median survival was 3.5+ months (range, 1.0 to 15+ months). Leukocyte and platelet nadirs were 1,800/microL and 160,000/microL, respectively, during cycle 1 of treatment and occurred between days 21 and 28. Overall, total leukocyte count decreased to less than 1,000/microL during 10 of 56 cycles (18%). Five patients required six hospitalizations for neutropenia and fever. There were two toxic deaths due to sepsis. Platelet counts less than 50,000/microL occurred in 14 cycles (25%). Alopecia developed in all patients; gastrointestinal toxicity was uncommon. This schedule of etoposide administration warrants further study in combination with other active agents in previously untreated patients with SCLC.\r"

  ".W": "Autologous lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells and recombinant human interleukin-2 (rIL-2) were administered intraperitoneally (IP) to 24 patients with malignancies limited to the peritoneal space. Ten patients had ovarian cancer, 12 had colorectal cancer, and one patient each had endometrial carcinoma and primary small-bowel adenocarcinoma. All ovarian cancer patients, three of twelve colorectal cancer patients, and one patient with endometrial carcinoma had received prior therapy. Patients received IL-2 100,000 U/kg every 8 hours intravenously (IV) for 3 days, and 2 days later underwent daily leukapheresis for 5 days. LAK cells were generated in vitro by incubating the peripheral blood mononuclear cells in IL-2 for 7 days and were then administered IP daily for 5 days through a Tenckhoff catheter (Davol, Inc, Cranston, RI) together with IL-2 25,000 U/kg IP every 8 hours. All but one patient completed at least one cycle of therapy. Toxic side effects included minor to moderate hypotension, fever, chills, rash, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and distension, diarrhea, oliguria, fluid retention, thrombocytopenia, and minor elevations of liver function tests; all of these rapidly improved after discontinuation of IL-2. One patient had a grand mal seizure, and one suffered a colonic perforation; these were felt to be treatment-related. IP fibrosis developed in 14 patients and limited repeated cyclic administration of this therapy in five patients. Two of 10 (20%) ovarian cancer patients and five of 12 (42%) colorectal cancer patients had laparoscopy- or laparotomy-documented partial responses. We conclude that LAK cells and rIL-2 can be administered IP to cancer patients, resulting in moderate to severe short-term toxicity and modest therapeutic efficacy. Further investigation of this form of adoptive immunotherapy modified to address the problem of IP fibrosis and with lower IP IL-2 doses is justified by these initial results.\r"

Despite selection of patients for good performance status (PS) (29, PS 0; 18, PS 1) prior nephrectomy (43 of the 47 patients), and low tumor burden, the response rate was low (two complete [CRs] and two partial responses [PRs], for an overall objective response rate of 9%).

This dose and schedule of IL-2 were identical to those used in a previous combined IL-2 and lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cell phase II clinical trial of the IL-2/LAK Working Group. Patient eligibility criteria, and clinical management guidelines were similar to those used in the previous trial. Forty-six patients were assessable for response. Objective responses were observed in 10 of 46 patients (two complete responses [CRs], eight partial responses [PRs]) or 22% with responses occurring in lung and liver as well as lymph nodes and subcutaneous sites. The median response duration was 8 months. Toxicity was significant; three patients developed myocardial infarction, and one patient died during therapy. Overall the toxicity and response rate for single-agent IL-2 are similar to that observed with IL-2 administered in combination with LAK cells in the previous trial. These results suggest that single-agent therapy with IL-2 when administered in this schedule has significant antimelanoma activity in humans, and that LAK cells generated from peripheral blood add little to the antimelanoma activity of this dose and schedule of IL-2.\r"

Fatigue was the treatment-limiting toxicity, and serious clinical or laboratory abnormalities occurred infrequently during this study. Patients with colon cancer metastatic to the liver tolerated treatment worse than patients with other tumors. Twelve of the 15 patients with renal cell cancer were assessable for response determinations.

Similar significant results were observed with respect to overall survival. Patients with disease at pelvic sites have significantly poorer survival at 5 years than those with disease at nonpelvic sites (34% v 57%; P less than .001). Among pelvic cases, there was no evidence of differing survival by treatment (P = .81), but among nonpelvic cases, there was strong evidence of differing survival by treatment (P less than .001). The overall percentage of patients developing metastatic disease was 44%; the percentages by treatments 1, 2, and 3 were 30%, 72%, and 42%, respectively. The overall incidence of local recurrence was 15%, and there was no evidence that local recurrence rate differed by treatment. Patient characteristics related to prognosis, both with respect to RFS and overall survival experience, were primary site (nonpelvic patients were most favorable) and patient age (younger patients were more favorable).\r"

  ".W": "Cytotoxic chemotherapy has not provided survival benefit in metastatic prostate cancer, although it has been used most frequently in patients with far-advanced, refractory disease. To evaluate the effects of chemotherapy given earlier in the course of the disease, the Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG) performed a randomized trial between September 1982 and October 1986 comparing endocrine therapy (diethylstilbestrol [DES] or orchiectomy) alone followed by cyclophosphamide-Adriamycin (doxorubicin; Adria Laboratories, Columbus, OH) chemotherapy at progression versus initial combined chemo-endocrine therapy. One hundred forty-three patients were registered, and only six were declared ineligible. Patients on the combined chemo-endocrine therapy arm had a slightly higher response rate (63%) compared with endocrine therapy alone (48%). A log-linear model of tumor response and treatment arm adjusted for the stratification factors favored the combination arm (P = .059). Only three of 27 patients on the endocrine therapy alone arm had an objective partial response when crossed over to chemotherapy, while two others had stable disease. Despite the difference in initial response rate, time to treatment failure and survival were identical in the two treatment arms. Seventy-seven percent of patients on the initial endocrine therapy alone arm have died (median survival, 25.6 months) compared with 78% on the chemo-endocrine therapy arm (median survival, 22.0 months). No significant effect of treatment on survival was observed even after adjustment for the stratification variables in a Cox regression model. Exploratory survival analyses with patients on both arms combined did show a marginally significant time to treatment failure and survival advantage for patients treated with DES rather than orchiectomy as initial endocrine therapy. Eighty-six percent of patients treated by orchiectomy have died compared with only 65% of those treated with DES. These data do not support the addition of cytotoxic chemotherapy to initial endocrine therapy in patients with metastatic prostate cancer.\r"

  ".U": "91011520\r", 
  ".W": "One hundred eighty-five patients who underwent surgery within 6 months of completing chemotherapy were identified from 360 patients with nonseminomatous germ cell tumors (NSGCT) treated with Memorial Hospital front-line cisplatin- or carboplatin-based combination chemotherapy protocols between 1979 and 1988. Clinical, pathologic, and radiologic features were correlated with the pathologic findings at surgery. The size of a residual retroperitoneal mass, the degree of shrinkage that occurred with chemotherapy, and the presence of teratomatous elements in pretreatment pathology specimens were each correlated with the pathologic findings of retroperitoneal resections after chemotherapy. Multivariable logistic regression analysis of those undergoing retroperitoneal resections identified the size and shrinkage of the residual mass and the prechemotherapy lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and alphafetoprotein (AFP) levels as the best predictors of finding only necrotic debris. No factors could be found, however, that could selectively exclude patients who had residual viable malignancy or teratoma in the retroperitoneum. Of 39 patients with residual retroperitoneal masses measuring less than or equal to 1.5 cm in maximal diameter, three had residual malignancy and five had teratoma resected. No factors were identified for residual lung or mediastinal masses that could be used to select a group of patients who could safely avoid surgery. If serum markers have normalized after chemotherapy for NSGCT, resection of all residual abnormalities on imaging studies of the retroperitoneum, lungs, and mediastinum is recommended. In addition, retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (RPLND) is recommended for all patients with initial bulky metastases (greater than or equal to 3 cm in diameter) in the retroperitoneum, irrespective of the findings of postchemotherapy computed tomography (CT).\r"

  ".W": "Retrospective review of 291 solid tumor and lymphoma patients undergoing autologous bone marrow transplantation (BMT) was performed to determine the influence of pretransplant characteristics and preparative regimen to the development of hepatic venoocclusive disease (VOD). Twelve patients (4.1%) developed a clinical syndrome of right upper quadrant (RUQ) tenderness or hepatomegaly, jaundice, and ascites, with or without encephalopathy, within 40 days of marrow reinfusion. Evidence of metastatic liver disease was the only pretransplant characteristic predictive for VOD (P = .0002). Sex, age, histology, hepatitis B serology, and elevated liver function tests were not predictive. No individual preparative agent had a significant effect on the development of VOD. However, a single 2-hour infusion of carmustine (BCNU) (greater than or equal to 450 mg/m2) led to an increased incidence of VOD when compared with the same dose administered in a fractionated schedule (P = .0258) when given with two other chemotherapeutic agents. Seven of eight autopsy specimens confirmed the clinical diagnosis of VOD. The four patients in whom clinical VOD resolved had lower median peak bilirubins (7.3 v 15.9 mg/dL), lower median peak creatinines (2.1 v 4.1 mg/dL), and relatively quick engraftment of neutrophils (mean, 18.7 days). One of the four patients in whom VOD resolved had other grade 4 (life-threatening) toxicities in contrast to eight of eight who succumbed. In summary, VOD is an uncommon complication in autotransplantation of solid tumors and lymphomas. Our data suggest caution in selecting patients with known metastatic liver disease and consideration of a fractionated BCNU schedule especially in combination with other alkylating agents.\r"

Only one patient was in a chemotherapy-induced hematologic remission. Graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis included methotrexate, methotrexate plus cyclosporine, cyclosporine, or T-cell depletion using one of two anti-CD5 monoclonal antibodies. For patients with primary MDS, the median age was 19 years (range, 11 to 41 years) and the actuarial disease-free survival was 56% +/- 21% (median follow-up, 2 years; range, 0.8 to 5 years). There were three graft failures (two with autologous recovery) and two early deaths. Outcome appeared to be related to French-American-British (FAB) classification. For patients with secondary MDS/ANLL, the median age was 28 years (range, 3 to 16 years) and the actuarial disease-free survival was 27% +/- 13% (median follow-up, 5 years; range, 2.5 to 8.5 years). There were no graft failures, two relapses, and four early deaths. The presence of marrow fibrosis per se did not predict for graft failure (P = .21); however, the use of T-cell depleted marrow in patients with marrow fibrosis resulted in graft failure in three of five individuals. Our results suggest that in patients with primary MDS or secondary MDS/ANLL, BMT should be considered early in the course of the disease, and that attempts at inducing a remission prior to BMT appeared to be unnecessary. In MDS patients with marrow fibrosis, T-cell depletion should be avoided.\r"

  ".U": "91011524\r", 
  ".W": "Leukoplakia is associated with increased risk of oral cancer and is considered a premalignant lesion. Retinoids, particularly 13-cis retinoic acid, can frequently reverse leukoplakia. However, these drugs have considerable toxicity and are not suitable for large-scale use in the prevention of oral cancer. Beta-carotene is a naturally occurring, nontoxic carotenoid with biologic properties that suggest that it might be efficacious against oral leukoplakia. In 1986, we began a randomized study of 13-cis retinoic acid (1 mg/kg/d) versus beta-carotene (30 mg/d) in leukoplakia. However, owing to the marked differences in toxicity between the two compounds outlined in the consent form, 11 of the initial 16 eligible patients refused to participate unless they were \"guaranteed\" beta-carotene. Therefore, the study design was changed to a phase II trial of beta-carotene in which the compound was given daily for 3 months. Responding patients were continued for another 3 months of treatment. All lesions were examined histologically at entry. Responses were monitored by bidimensional measurements and photography done at entry, then monthly while on treatment and at study completion. Twenty-four evaluable patients were treated, and 17 had major responses (two complete, 15 partial), a response rate of 71% (95% confidence limits, 53% to 89%). There was no significant toxicity requiring drug discontinuation or dose reduction. These results indicate that beta-carotene has substantial activity in oral premalignancy. Because of its lack of toxicity, it is an excellent candidate for a preventive agent for oral cancer.\r"

  ".W": "The control of nausea and emesis in cancer patients receiving chemotherapy poses a significant management problem. In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, we evaluated the effect of serotonin S3 receptor blockade with ondansetron (GR 38032F) on the prevention of nausea and vomiting induced by cyclophosphamide-containing chemotherapy. Cyclophosphamide was given in doses of 500 to 600 mg/m2 and ondansetron as three intravenous (IV) doses of 0.15 mg/kg. Most patients had breast cancer. Cyclophosphamide was given in combination with doxorubicin (65% of patients) or with fluorouracil (85% of patients: 50% with Adriamycin [doxorubicin; Adria Laboratories, Columbus, OH] and 35% with methotrexate). All placebo-treated patients experienced vomiting, whereas 70% of patients treated with ondansetron did not vomit (P = .008). Median nausea scores were 8 mm on ondansetron and 65 mm on placebo (P less than .001). Seventy percent of patients treated with ondansetron retained their normal appetite, compared with 10% of placebo patients. Adverse events occurred in six placebo patients and one ondansetron patient. Diarrhea and headache were the most common events, both occurring more frequently in the placebo group. There were no extrapyramidal reactions, and the only significant biochemical change occurred in a placebo-treated patient. These results suggest that serotonin S3 receptor antagonists represent a novel, effective, and safe mode of therapy for nausea and emesis induced by cyclophosphamide-containing chemotherapies. In addition, our observations are compatible with the view that serotonin, acting on S3 receptors, mediates the nausea and emesis occurring after cyclophosphamide chemotherapy.\r"

Twenty-two of these patients who had at least a partial response (PR) to the first cycle of therapy received a second cycle, and eight patients received three or more cycles of therapy. Bone marrow replacement was not used. The maximum-tolerated doses (MTDs) were cyclophosphamide 2.5 g/m2 on days 1 and 2; etoposide 500 mg/m2 on days 1, 2, and 3; and cisplatin 50 mg/m2 on days 1, 2, and 3. Hematologic toxicity was not dose-limiting by study design. Recovery to an absolute granulocyte count above 100/microL occurred at a median of 9 days from onset (range, 3 to 23 days) at the MTD. Recovery was delayed after the third cycle. Only one patient on his third cycle failed to recover peripheral blood counts and died of sepsis an day 43. Hematologic toxicity was not dose-dependent. Nonhematologic toxicities included emesis, fatigue, alopecia, diarrhea, and anorexia and were generally well tolerated. The dose-limiting toxicities were fatal pulmonary or cardiac toxicities in five of nine patients treated at the highest dose level. Patients likely to do well can be selected by tumor type, response to prior therapy, and performance status. Nine of 36 assessable patients had a complete response (CR) and 13 a PR for a response rate of 61%. Five patients (12%) remain alive and free of disease at 15 to 32 months. Repeated cycles of dose-intensive combination therapy can produce long-term disease-free remissions in patients with refractory tumor types. The toxicity of the regimen is acceptable if patients are carefully selected.\r"

Studies have been completed or are in progress using hexamethylene bisacetamide, etoposide, teniposide, fluorouracil (FUra), and cytarabine (ara-C). Future studies will focus on optimal sampling strategies, analysis of intermediate biochemical end points, combination chemotherapy, modulation by colony-stimulating factors, and more sophisticated pharmacodynamic models.\r"

Recent data suggest that the probability of infection following percutaneous inoculation is about 1 in 250 cases. Several studies suggest that the frequency of percutaneous injury in surgery is at least 1 in 40 cases, for some as high as 1 in 20 cases. Assuming that on the average a surgeon will perform 350 operations per year and will practice for 30 years, the cumulative risk of HIV infection will depend on the prevalence of HIV infection in the surgical population. For HIV prevalences of 1 in 100 to 1 in 10, the cumulative risk per surgeon ranges from 1 in 100 to 1 in 5, respectively. Based on these risk estimates, it is crucial to decrease the frequency of percutaneous injury. The case is made for substantial improvements in barrier protection and modification of surgical technique.\r"

All three infants had biologically aggressive tumors in spite of low-grade histology, and died from progressive tumor growth. Eleven of the 13 children aged 1 year or over are alive and well, without clinical or radiographic evidence of disease progression, 4 months to 4 1/2 years following surgery. Six of these patients, with a follow-up period of 10 months to 4 1/2 years (mean 27 months), have had no adjuvant therapy following radical surgical resection. The authors conclude that: 1) radical surgical resection of chiasmatic-hypothalamic tumors can be performed with minimal morbidity; 2) radical resection may delay the time to disease progression in older children and postpone the need for irradiation; 3) resection of postirradiation recurrent tumors may provide neurological improvement and long-lasting clinical remission; and 4) chiasmatic-hypothalamic tumors of infancy are aggressive neoplasms that require multimodality therapy.\r"

Adequate vascularity of the temporal muscle is maintained. The exposure encompasses the internal carotid artery in the neck for vascular control. Extensive reconstruction is eliminated. The described technique was used in seven patients with lesions of the skull base.

This report concerns eight patients with hyperthyroidism, inappropriately elevated levels of serum thyrotropin and alpha-subunit, and radiographic evidence of pituitary tumor. All underwent surgery and had pathological confirmation of a thyrotropin-secreting adenoma, and most had been subjected to prior ablation of the thyroid gland. Only one tumor was a microadenoma; the others ranged in size from 1.4 to 12 cm, and invasion of parasellar structures was common. Thyrotropin, triiodothyronine, thyroxine, and alpha-subunit were measured preoperatively and at intervals postoperatively. Coexistent hormonal abnormalities (which occurred in all patients) included acromegaly and hyperprolactinemia and were also monitored. All four patients who had tumors less than 2 cm in diameter remain alive. Complete extirpation of tumor in these patients produced rapid correction of all hormonal abnormalities and resolution of clinical hyperthyroidism. The other four patients had larger invasive tumors: two died soon after surgery, one died of disseminated tumor 8 years after presentation, and one remains alive with residual tumor. Tumors secreting thyroid-stimulating hormone are less easily cured by surgery than are other types of pituitary adenoma because of the large size and invasive features that many attain during the delay to diagnosis; medical therapy can subdue the tumor but not cure it. The experience with these patients establishes the importance of early diagnosis and surgical excision for successful treatment, and demonstrates the utility of modern diagnostic techniques for finding these lesions. As occurs in Nelson's syndrome after adrenalectomy for Cushing's disease, ablation of the target organ may allow the tumor to convert to a more clinically malignant form which is resistant to cure.\r"

  ".W": "The outcome 1 year after they had sustained a severe head injury was investigated in patients who were admitted to the neurosurgery service at one of four centers participating in the Traumatic Coma Data Bank (TCDB). Of 300 eligible survivors, the quality of recovery 1 year after injury was assessed by at least the Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) in 263 patients (87%), whereas complete neuropsychological assessment was performed in 127 (42%) of the eligible survivors. The capacity of the patients to undergo neuropsychological testing 1 year after injury was a criterion of recovery as reflected by a significant relationship to neurological indices of acute injury and the GOS score at the time of hospital discharge. The neurobehavioral data at 1 year after injury were generally comparable across the four samples of patients and characterized by impairment of memory and slowed information processing. In contrast, language and visuospatial ability recovered to within the normal range. The lowest postresuscitation Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score and pupillary reactivity were predictive of the 1-year GOS score and neuropsychological performance. The lowest GCS score was especially predictive of neuropsychological performance 1 year postinjury in patients who had at least one nonreactive pupil following resuscitation. Notwithstanding limitations related to the scope of the TCDB and attrition in follow-up material, the results indicate a characteristic pattern of neurobehavioral recovery from severe head injury and encourage the use of neurobehavioral outcome measurements in clinical trials to evaluate interventions for head-injured patients.\r"

Of these patients, 74 (50%) had Toxoplasma abscesses, 45 (30%) had primary CNS lymphoma, and 30 patients (20%) had progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging was more sensitive than computerized tomography (CT) in detecting lesions, especially in cases of PML. Whereas CT was unable to distinguish mass lesions caused by toxoplasmosis from those caused by lymphoma, 71% of the solitary lesions seen on MR images were lymphomas. These results indicate that empirical treatment for toxoplasmosis, the most common initial treatment for AIDS patients with neurological symptoms stemming from mass lesions, is not likely to be successful for patients with solitary lesions on MR images. Rather, early biopsy is advisable. If the presence of lymphoma is confirmed, the rapid initiation of treatment can allow prolonged high-quality survival.\r"

To determine whether these tumors arise from a single cell or multiple cells, the authors studied X chromosome inactivation in deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) isolated from pituitary adenomas in women. Tumors of three different hormonal subtypes were examined. One tumor contained cells immunoreactive for prolactin and human growth hormone; one tumor contained foci immunoreactive for the beta-subunits of luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone; and the third tumor had no immunoreactive prolactin, human growth hormone, beta-subunits of thyroid-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, or follicle-stimulating hormone, or the alpha-subunit. Analysis of the DNA revealed that, in each of the three pituitary tumors, one X chromosome was active in all cells and one X chromosome was inactive, indicating that each of these tumors was monoclonal in origin. It is concluded that clinically evident pituitary tumors arise from a genetic mutation in a single cell.\r"

  ".W": "Tissue samples from 57 patients with neuroepithelial tumors (25 glioblastomas, 18 anaplastic astrocytomas, and 14 astrocytomas) were analyzed in order to evaluate the presence of estrogen, progesterone, glucocorticoid, and androgen receptors. Glucocorticoid- and androgen-specific binding proteins were present in 38.6% and 21.6% of the cases, respectively. Only a few tumors showed estrogen or progesterone receptors. A correlation was found between grade of anaplasia, patient's sex and age, and presence of glucocorticoid and androgen receptors. The biological role of these two receptors was investigated in 10 primary cell cultures derived from neuroepithelial tumors. For this purpose, dexamethasone and testosterone were added to culture medium at different concentrations (from 50 to 0.016 micrograms/ml). A significant stimulation of the cell growth was observed in four of five glucocorticoid receptor-positive cultures when dexamethasone in doses ranging from 2 to 0.016 microgram/ml was added to the culture. No modulation of the growth was observed in glucocorticoid receptor-negative cultures at the same doses. Higher dexamethasone doses induced a significant decrease of the growth index independently from the glucocorticoid receptor status. All of the cultures tested for testosterone activity were negative for androgen receptors. This hormone induced an inhibition of the growth index at doses ranging from 50 to 0.4 micrograms/ml. The data suggest that neuroepithelial tumors contain specific glucocorticoid and androgen binding proteins. Glucocorticoid receptors modulate the growth of cultured neuroepithelial tumors in the presence of different concentrations of dexamethasone.\r"

  ".U": "91011616\r", 
  ".W": "Female sex steroid receptors were examined in 50 human cerebral meningiomas. For estrogen receptors, high-affinity binding sites (dissociation constant (Kd): 0.05 to 0.2 nM) were found in the cytosolic fraction with a capacity of less than 4 fmol/mg protein in 10 meningiomas using a dextran-coated charcoal (DCC) assay. In the same cytosolic fraction, the solid-phase enzyme immunoassay revealed only one cytosol with a positive colorimetric reaction equal to 5 fmol/mg protein. However, in the nuclear compartment, none of the tumors stained positively for estrogen receptors with immunohistochemical techniques. In addition, the most convincing evidence for the absence of estrogen receptors was obtained by in situ hybridization using an oligonucleotide probe complementary to a fraction of the human receptor messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA). In none of the 50 meningiomas was the expression of estrogen mRNA coding for the estrogen receptor detected. For progesterone receptors, high-affinity binding sites (Kd: 0.3 to 2.6 nM) were found in 49 of the 50 tumors using a DCC assay. In the same cytosols, solid-phase enzyme immunoassay revealed that each tumor was positive for progesterone receptors. However, in the nuclear compartment, only five tumors had partially positive staining for progesterone receptors with immunohistochemical techniques. Within the confines of this study, it is concluded that: 1) the estrogen receptor is generally absent in meningioma tissue, and 2) the progesterone receptor is mainly absent in the nuclear compartment, leading to the conclusion that the cytosolic progesterone receptor may be an inactive form. This study suggests that female sex steroid receptors are not primarily involved in the proliferative rate of cerebral meningiomas and that they are of no current significance as markers for adjuvant medical therapy of most meningiomas.\r"

  ".W": "Cell culture and biochemical techniques have been employed to examine the effects of steroids, bromocriptine, and epidermal growth factor (EGF) on the growth and proliferative potential of meningiomas. In cell culture, the growth of meningiomas was not altered by progestogens, antiprogestogens, or 17beta-estradiol. The progestogen, norethisterone, had no effect on the uptake by meningiomas cell cultures of 3H-thymidine. Furthermore, cytosolic deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) polymerase activity of meningiomas did not correlate with the progesterone receptor status of the same tumors. In contrast, the androgen antagonists, cyproterone acetate and 11-alpha-hydroxyprogesterone, and the dopamine agonist, bromocriptine, all inhibited the in vitro growth of meningioma cells. The growth of meningioma cell cultures was stimulated by EGF, and there was a positive correlation between the EGF content and DNA polymerase activity in meningioma cytosols. These results demonstrate that female sex steroids do not influence growth of meningiomas in vitro, whereas antiandrogens and bromocriptine have an antiproliferative effect. Consequently, bromocriptine and antiandrogens may have a role in the medical treatment of meningiomas. In addition, these results suggest that EGF may be involved in the genesis and/or progression of meningiomas.\r"

It is pertinent to know if unpolymerized HEMA would have untoward effects if accidentally released into the carotid artery by balloon rupture or deflation. Seven mongrel dogs underwent transfemoral catheterization of the common carotid artery and subsequent injection of HEMA solution in volumes of 1 cc in five dogs, 2 cc in one, and 4 cc in one. Angiography performed at the time of injection revealed evidence of intravascular thrombosis as well as possible spasm. Three surviving animals were sacrificed at 48 hours; the brains were fixed and examined histopathologically. One brain was normal and one was autolyzed and could not be examined. Five of the seven animals had histopathologically documented cerebral infarctions of varying size. No foreign substance was seen within the blood vessels to suggest intravascular polymerization. The animals injected with 2 or 4 cc HEMA solution did not survive 48 hours. Literature review reveals little documentation of the toxicology of intravascular HEMA. With its increasing popularity as a compound for polymerization in detachable balloons introduced into the brain, further investigations are warranted to understand the physical properties of the compound and potential risks of its use.\r"

She had previously undergone treatment for a posterior thoracic cutaneous angioma. At surgery, upon incision of the paravertebral muscle fascia, viscous pale fluid was encountered emanating from a foramen in the thoracic lamina. The spinal AVM was resected in spite of concern that the abnormality represented spinal osteomyelitis. Postoperatively, there was full return of function in the lower extremities, along with recurrent episodes of chylothorax, which slowly came under control with dietary manipulation. A review of the anatomy of the thoracic duct and nontraumatic causes of chylothorax is presented, and the association of cutaneous and central angiomas is discussed.

  ".W": "Quantitative measurements of cerebral blood flow (CBF) by xenon-133 (133Xe) tomography, together with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), electroencephalography (EEG), psychometric tests, and laboratory analyses were performed on 18 human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) seropositive asymptomatic subjects. Abnormalities of cerebral perfusion were observed in 16 cases (88%). These abnormalities were particularly frequent in the frontal regions (77% of cases). MRI demonstrated leucoencephalopathy in only two cases. EEG showed only induced diffuse abnormalities in two cases. Psychometric tests showed restricted moderate disturbances in 55% of patients. These disturbances mostly concerned those sectors involved in cognitive functions and memorization. These results indicate that quantitative measurements of CBF by 133Xe-SPECT is capable of detecting abnormalities of cerebral perfusion at a very early stage (Phase II) of HIV-1 infection. These abnormalities are indications of disturbances resulting from unidentified metabolic or vascular lesions. This technique appears to be superior to MRI at this stage of the disease's development. It could provide objective information leading to earlier treatment, and prove useful in evaluating potential antiviral chemotherapy.\r"

Therefore turnover of oPPA was compared with that of pPPA in rat hearts and in man, the latter by using substrates double-labeled with 123/131I and 14C. Moreover, substrate binding to coenzyme-A was tested in vitro. In rats, oPPA remained mainly in the pool of free fatty acids, as opposed to pPPA, which was metabolized by mitochondrial beta-oxidation. Binding to coenzyme-A at maximum was 62% for oPPA, 81% for pPPA and 90% for palmitic acid. In man, after i.v. and intracoronary injection of double-labeled oPPA, the two radionuclides reappeared together in venous blood and in coronary sinus respectively, in an unchanged ratio but at a significantly lower rate than with pPPA. It can be concluded that oPPA is bound to coenzyme-A and is retained in the cytosolic lipid pool, while pPPA is metabolized by mitochondrial beta-oxidation. A dual-tracer application of oPPA and pPPA has the potential of being a specific probe for the function of the carnitine shuttle.\r"

Thallium-201 uptake was visually scored and judged as normal (Group 1), reversible defect (Group II), new fill-in after reinjection (Group IIIa) and no fill-in even after reinjection (Group IIIb). New fill-in after reinjection was observed in 27 segments of the 85 segments (32%), showing persistent defect on the stress and delayed images. The wall motion in Group IIIa was worse than Group II but better than Group IIIb. Group IIIa showed Q-wave on ECG more often (69%) than Group II (27%) (p less than 0.01), but less often than Group IIIb (85%) (p less than 0.05). These data indicate that the reinjection 201Tl imaging often identifies new fill-in in the areas of no redistribution on the delayed images and it may hold promise for assessing tissue viability which the conventional imaging may underestimate.\r"

Diagnostic criteria for a lymphocele were ultrasonic evidence of a perirenal fluid collection and analysis of that fluid that demonstrated BUN, creatinine, and electrolytes similar to the patient's plasma. Scintigraphic findings were attributed to a lymphocele if abnormalities were in the same area as the ultrasound fluid collection. Scintigraphic findings attributable to lymphocele resolved in all patients following surgical drainage or peritoneal window placement. Six of the 11 documented lymphoceles demonstrated a cold defect on initial dynamic images that \"filled in\" to equal background activity and another exceeded background. Three cases showed a rim of increased activity surrounding the lymphocele (\"rim sign\").\r"

To test the hypothesis that the mechanism of cellular uptake may involve distribution across biologic membranes in response to membrane potential, Tc-MIBI net uptake and retention were determined in cultured mouse BALB/c 3T3, NIH 3T3, and v-src transformed NIH 3T3 fibroblasts as well as in cultured chick embryo heart cells. Isovolumic depolarization of plasma membrane potentials with 130 mM K 20 mM Cl buffer decreased Tc-MIBI net cell uptake in all preparations. In BALB/c 3T3 cells, depolarizing mitochondrial membrane potential with valinomycin in high K buffer or with the protonophore CCCP inhibited net uptake and retention of Tc-MIBI while hyperpolarizing mitochondrial and plasma membrane potentials with the K+/H+ exchanger nigericin increased Tc-MIBI net uptake. These results indicated that net cellular uptake and retention of Tc-MIBI in fibroblasts were determined by both mitochondrial and plasma membrane potentials; the gamma-emitting properties of Tc-MIBI may therefore raise the possibility of monitoring membrane potential in vivo.\r"

C3H/HeMsNRS mice bearing spontaneous hepatomas were used for the tissue distribution study. At 60 min after injection, high uptakes were found in tumor (5.16, mean value of %dose/g), liver (3.71), and kidney (3.27). The tumor uptake of 18F-FAG showed the highest value in all tissue. In the PET study, VX-2 carcinoma of the rabbit was clearly visualized. Our preliminary results suggest that 18F-FAG has potential as a new agent for tumor imaging.\r"

We estimated activity, size, and position of a disk-shaped object on a circular, uniform background of unknown activity. The parameter estimates were unbiased, and their standard error was proportional to the square root of the total image counts. The estimates of object activity and size were strongly (negatively) correlated; the position estimates, however, were not correlated with estimates of any other parameters. This implies that a priori knowledge of object location does not improve precision. The minimal model of quantitation tasks should incorporate unknown object activity and size as well as unknown background activity. The ML estimation procedure was used to investigate the trade-off between resolution and sensitivity in gamma camera collimator design. The results implied that for complex tasks such as the multiparameter estimation task investigated here, optimum performance is achieved at a better resolution than that previously found optimal for detection of a well-specified object in a known background.\r"

Our data show the peripheral organ distribution volume (PODV) kinetics to exhibit systematic time behavior depending on its mode of relation with plasma: linear increase for irreversible transfer, uniexponential function growing toward as asymptotic value for reversible transfer. Statistical analysis of our kinetic data shows that no other significant information can be extracted at least inside the time and statistical noise limits of our investigation. After intravenous injection of a diffusible tracer, the total activity in any region of interest (ROI) in the body is the sum of various components and, under certain conditions, PODV transformation easily allows their separation. Our simple non-compartmental model provides a useful tool for quantitative tracer analysis in nuclear medicine.\r"

The method is based on the properties of the peripheral organ distribution volume (PODV) in mammillary systems. These PODV properties allow easy separation of the components of the renogram, i.e., interstitial fluid, plasma and renal activities. The proposed algorithm takes advantage of the linear time dependence of the kidney distribution volume, during the renal uptake phase, to correct for the plasma residual activity, which always remains after classical background correction. Theoretically, the ratio between kidney uptake and SGFR should be identical for both left and right kidneys, even for very asymmetrical kidney functions. This is best verified when the proposed plasma residual activity correction is applied.\r"

The performance of the method was studied by simulation and with image data from PET, XCT, and MRI. It was found that random errors in determining the brain contour are well tolerated. Progressively coarser axial sampling of data sets led to some degradation, but acceptable performance was obtained with axial sampling distances up to 10 mm. Given adequate digital sampling of the object volume, we conclude that registration by the principal axes transformation can be accomplished with typical errors in the range of approximately 1 mm. The advantages of the technique are simplicity and speed of computation.\r"

  ".W": "The multiwire gamma camera (MWGC) operates at high count rates with radionuclides of low energy and short half-life. We evaluate the count rate performance of the MWGC with tantalum-178 (178Ta) by a decaying source method. Data acquired dynamically by the camera from a 178Ta source in the NEMA Standards scatter phantom were corrected for deadtime loss by a trial paralyzing deadtime and converted to their natural logarithms. The trial deadtime, tau, was adjusted iteratively after curve fittings until a straight line was achieved. The paralyzing deadtime determined by this method was 0.41 microsecond. Therefore, the camera can be operated up to 850,000 cps with 178Ta without exceeding 50% data loss. This rate is 10 times greater than the performance of the typical scintillation camera. Moreover, high count rates are achieved without significant loss of spatial resolution.\r"

  ".W": "The use of labeled butanol for autoradiographic and positron tomographic measurement of cerebral blood flow has been well established using radiocarbon labels. The advantages of the short half-life of oxygen-15 (15O) in doing sequential flow studies are also recognized. An automated procedure has been developed for the routine rapid and sequential synthesis of 15O-labeled butanol in amounts and with purity suitable for use in positron tomography. Butanol can now replace 15O-labeled water, which is commonly used for routine applications. The 14N(d,n)15O reaction is used, with 8 MeV deuterons on a nitrogen target containing 0.2% oxygen. Labeled oxygen is reacted with tri-n-butyl-borane by passing the gas over an alumina support which holds the reagent. Washing with water through small C18-bonded phase silica cartridges eliminates labeled water and the majority of boron-containing impurities. Injectable labeled butanol is collected at 2.5 min after the end of bombardment. The yield is 6 mCi per microampere of saturated bombardment, measured at the end of synthesis. Injectable product up to 250 mCi can be obtained at 10-min intervals.\r"

  ".W": "With modern positron tomographs producing 14, 21, or more transaxial slices, the effects of slice spacing on quantitative reconstruction and three-dimensional displays must be evaluated. This analysis can be approached in terms of the partial volume effect, quantified by the recovery coefficient, or in terms of sampling theory leading to the concept of aliasing. The axial recovery coefficient varies as a function of the position of an object in relation to the slices, with greater variability for larger slice spacings and finer axial resolutions. The aliased image power varies in the same way. The variability in the recovery coefficient and aliasing increase when smaller objects are imaged. Tomographs should be designed with slice spacing approximately half the full-width at half-maximum axial resolution of the tomograph; finer spacing does not appear to confer significant advantages. Thus, quantification and display in positron tomography depend on slice spacing, resolution, and object size.\r"

Different dietary fats did not affect concentrations of cholesterol, triacylglycerol or protein in plasma or major lipoprotein fractions. The concentration of phospholipid was less in plasma and in very low density lipoproteins with soy oil feeding than with tallow feeding. The weight percentage of cholesteryl ester in the low density lipoprotein fraction tended to be greater with 40% than with 20% tallow and tended to be less with 40% than with 20% soy oil. Phospholipid as a weight percentage of low density lipoprotein was least in pigs fed soy oil. Tallow feeding increased the percentage of myristic, palmitic, palmitoleic and oleic acids in plasma, relative to both other groups. Soy oil feeding increased the percentage of linoleic and linolenic acids. These moderate diets were not hypercholesterolemic, but they did alter plasma fatty acid composition and phospholipid concentrations in plasma and very low density lipoprotein.\r"

During the 3-wk feeding-period the ODS (od/od) rats fed the vitamin C-deficient diet gradually decreased food intake, resulting in a lower body weight than that of od/od rats given ascorbic acid. The serum cholesterol level was significantly higher in the vitamin C-deficient od/od rats fed the cholesterol diet, and it tended to be higher in those fed the control (0% cholesterol) diet, whereas the liver lipid levels remained unchanged relative to those in od/od rats fed the vitamin C-replete diet. The serum very low density lipoprotein and high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels were lower in od/od rats fed the vitamin C-deficient diet without cholesterol, but intermediate density lipoprotein and low density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were markedly higher in the vitamin C-deficient od/od rats than in od/od rats given ascorbic acid, regardless of dietary cholesterol level. The ratio of HDL2 cholesterol to HDL3 cholesterol was also higher in the vitamin C-deficient od/od rats. The parent strain of the od/od rats (+/+) showed no change due to vitamin C deficiency.

In the third, rats were fed for 3 wk a 10% fat diet with various sources of fat (lard, sunflower oil, olive oil, peanut oil, butter, soybean oil, corn oil or salmon oil). The results demonstrated that 10% dietary fat was sufficient to promote a maximum significant increase in lingual lipase activity (expressed in units/g tissue and in units/mg protein), whereas pancreatic lipase responded steadily to 20 and 30% fat diets. After 1 wk of feeding 20% dietary fat, both enzyme specific activities had reached their maximum values. The fatty acid composition of dietary triglyceride molecules (chain length, number and location of double bonds) had no specific effect on the adaptation of lingual lipase. The physiological implications of these findings are discussed in regard to the role of intragastric lipolysis in fat digestion.\r"

Both D,L-beta-(1-naphthyl)alanine and L-tryptophan bound to the L-tryptophan receptor protein and increased poly(A)polymerase and nucleoside triphosphatase activities of hepatic nuclei. However, only L-tryptophan was associated with increases in the release of labeled nuclear RNA (in vitro), in protein synthesis, in polyribosomal aggregation and in glycosylation ([14C]glucosamine incorporation into proteins) of rat liver.

  ".W": "In taurine-deficient cats, the secretion of bile acids is impaired, and this impairment may reduce intestinal uptake of lipophilic vitamins. It was therefore hypothesized that retinol deficiency is involved in the generation of retinal lesions in taurine-deficient kittens. To this end, the concentration of retinol in plasma and liver was determined in taurine-deficient kittens. Further, the effects of taurine deficiency on amino acid concentrations of heart, liver and kidney were investigated. To see whether taurine deficiency adversely affects the liver, hepatic enzymes were measured in plasma and liver of kittens suffering from taurine deficiency. In addition, liver morphology, growth and food intake were studied. Taurine was the only amino acid whose concentration was consistently decreased in plasma of the experimental group. Unexpectedly, retinol level was increased in plasma and liver from taurine-depleted kittens. Several alterations were noted in amino acid concentrations in liver and kidney, but not in heart. Plasma alanine aminotransferase activity was diminished, probably reflecting decreased activity in the liver. Perivenular steatosis was found in both groups. Controls grew linearly, in contrast to deficient animals, which nevertheless consumed more food. The results demonstrate that retinol deficiency is not involved in taurine-deficiency retinopathy. Moreover, taurine is required for linear growth of juvenile cats and for the maintenance of hepatic and renal pools of certain amino acids.\r"

  ".W": "The peroxisomal enzyme L-2-hydroxy acid oxidase A (EC 1.1.3.1) was isolated from chicken liver to better evaluate its part in the utilization of the L isomer of supplemental DL-hydroxy-4-methylthiobutanoic acid by birds fed diets containing the methionine hydroxy analogue. The 650-fold purified enzyme, a 169 kDa protein composed of four apparently identical subunits, exhibited a specific activity of 1.3 mumol glycolate oxidized.min-1.mg protein-1. Glycolate (Km = 0.10 mmol/L) was actually a better substrate than L-2-hydroxyisocaproate (Km = 0.63 mmol/L), L-2-hydroxy-4-methylthiobutanoate (Km = 1.73 mmol/L) and L-lactate (Km = 10.13 mmol/L). Under all substrate concentrations tested, the enzyme activity toward L-2-hydroxyisocaproate and L-2-hydroxy-4-methylthiobutanoate was 55 and 17%, respectively, of that toward glycolate. Although the highly purified enzyme was unable to oxidize D-lactate, D-methionine, L-methionine, L-mandelate and beta-phenyl-L-lactate, the latter two aromatic substrates were significantly oxidized by the first ammonium sulfate precipitate obtained during the isolation procedure, supposedly because of the presence of L-2-hydroxy acid oxidase isozyme B. Because the hepatic tissue concentration of glycolate, the physiological substrate for the enzyme, was rather low (10 mumol/L) as compared to the concentration of the methionine hydroxy analogue, one can expect that the conversion of L-2-hydroxy-4-methylthiobutanoate to 2-keto-4-methylthiobutanoate prior to L-methionine formation might proceed at a substantial rate in chickens fed the supplemental methionine source.\r"

To allow quantitative study of gastrointestinal mucin, a polyclonal antibody to the mucin of the rat small intestine was produced by injecting rabbits with a high-molecular-weight subfraction (MW 2 x 10(6)) of purified mucin glycoprotein derived from rat intestinal mucin. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was developed and used for the mucin assay. Three groups of male Wistar rats consumed 5% guar gum, 5% citrus fiber or a fiber-free control diet ad libitum for 4 wk. After an overnight fast, luminal and tissue mucin antibody reactivities were determined in the rat stomach, colon and small intestine. In all groups, total (luminal and tissue) mucin reactivity was greater in the small intestine than in the colon or stomach. The group fed 5% citrus fiber had significantly greater mucin reactivity in luminal samples from stomach and intestine than did the fiber-free control group. Fiber-induced increments in gastrointestinal mucin production or availability may be responsible for several reported consequences of fiber feeding, such as more rapid transit times and delayed or impaired nutrient absorption.\r"

Chromatin 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol [1,25-(OH)2D3] receptor concentration in the intestinal mucosa decreased 20-30%, and the percentage of occupied receptors decreased from 12-15% to 6-8%. Receptor affinity for 1,25-(OH)2D3 did not change (Kd = 0.24-0.26 nmol/L, Kd2 = 0.06-0.10 nmol/L), but the cooperativity coefficient decreased from 1.7 to 1.4. Vitamin C deficiency potentiated effects of vitamin D deprivation and impaired a restorative action of vitamin D. It was accompanied by a marked delay in the elevation of 25-OHD concentration in serum as well as decreased 1-OHase activity in kidneys and a lower concentration of occupied 1,25-(OH)2D3 receptors in the intestinal mucosa. The data demonstrate a critical role for ascorbic acid in vitamin D metabolism and binding.\r"

The latter diets were 10% casein-30% gelatin, 20% casein-20% gelatin or 40% casein. With the nicotinic acid-free diets, the sum total urinary excretion of nicotinamide and its metabolites was almost the same in the groups fed the 20 and 40% casein diets; however, it was significantly lower in the group fed the 10% casein diet. With diets containing the same level of protein, the sum total urinary excretion of these compounds in the groups fed the 10% casein-30% gelatin, 20% casein-20% gelatin and 40% casein diets were about 5, 7 and 11 mumol/d, respectively, values that were significantly different from each other.

The calbindin-D28K concentrations of the intestinal mucosa of the low Ca and low P groups were both increased approximately 2.5-fold, demonstrating that adaptation to the mineral deficiencies had occurred. By the Ellman reaction, a threefold increment in -SH groups in BBM from both mineral-deficient groups was noted. By using DACM (N-7-dimethylamino-4-methylcoumarin-3-yl maleimide), a fluorescent probe for -SH groups, it was observed that fluorescence development was considerably greater with BBM from the low Ca and low P groups than with BBM from the controls, whether measured in the absence or presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). In the absence of SDS, the pseudo-first-order reaction rate constants, k', calculated from the fluorescence data, were greater than the control group values, but in the presence of SDS, the k' values for all groups were about the same. Similar changes in BBM-SH groups were previously observed when 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol was given to vitamin D-deficient chicks. The redox state of the sulfhydryl groups in enzymes and transport proteins is known to affect the level of their activity. The functional significance of the present observations concerning the -SH groups of chick intestinal BBM, particularly in relation to vitamin D-dependent calcium and phosphorus absorption, is not known but is under investigation.\r"

Iron administered to chicks by intravenous or subcutaneous injection caused a 1.9-fold increase in hepatic MT. In marked contrast, intraperitoneal (ip) Fe resulted in a 10-fold increase, thus demonstrating the importance of the route of metal administration. This route-dependent effect was found to be dose-dependent, with ip injections between 1 and 10 mg Fe/kg resulting in a linear increase in MT and a concomitant reduction in serum zinc concentration and feed intake. High ip doses of Fe resulted in a persistent depression in serum Zn and elevated MT and MTmRNA. Equimolar ip injections of either Zn or Fe showed similar patterns of MTmRNA accumulation. In both cases MTmRNA levels were elevated by 3 h, with a peak at 6 h postinjection (Fe 8-fold, Zn 12-fold above 0 h). Plasma Zn was maximally reduced by Fe at 9 h (60%). The MT induction by Fe, as well as related depression in plasma Zn, was completely inhibited by actinomycin D. Zn depletion eliminated the accumulation of hepatic Zn and MT protein following ip injection of Fe or endotoxin, but not of cadmium, despite marked elevation of hepatic MTmRNA. Our results demonstrate Fe injected into the body cavity of chicks results in a rapid induction of hepatic MT that, like endotoxin induction, is independent of dietary Zn status.\r"

Inflammatory effects on cellular copper enzyme activity levels are largely unknown. Cu-Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities in liver, the main site of ceruloplasmin secretion, decreased with turpentine-induced inflammation (0.1 mL, intramuscular, leg) in rats fed any of three copper levels (adequate = 6 mg/kg, marginal = 2.5 mg/kg and deficient less than 0.5 mg/kg). Ceruloplasmin activities rose significantly with inflammation in the adequate and marginal groups but not in the deficient animals. Hepatic Cu-Zn SOD immunoreactive protein levels were unaffected by copper status or inflammatory state. Erythrocyte Cu-Zn SOD activities were influenced by dietary copper but not inflammation. An additional group of rats fed 15 mg copper/kg did not show a turpentine-induced decrease in liver Cu-Zn activity levels. Inflammatory effects on other copper enzyme activities did occur as evidenced by increases in ceruloplasmin and decreases in serum extracellular SOD. In conclusion, an acute phase response in rats increased the amount of dietary copper required to maintain hepatic Cu-Zn SOD activity at levels equal to those of nonstressed, copper-adequate rats. Rat erythrocyte Cu-Zn SOD activities provided a blood measurement reflective of copper intake with or without stress, but these values did not reflect decreases in liver Cu-Zn SOD activities after 3 d of inflammation.\r"

The present study investigated whether this increase in amylase activity is associated with increased pancreatic amylase messenger RNA (mRNA) levels. Weanling rats were fed a high carbohydrate diet containing either 40 micrograms Mn/g (control) or 0.5 microgram Mn/g (deficient) for 4 to 8 wk. Mn deficiency was confirmed by determining hepatic Mn content, which was significantly lower in Mn-deficient rats than in controls. Pancreatic RNA from both groups of rats was hybridized with 32P-labeled complementary DNAs for amylase and trypsinogen. Amylase mRNA levels were increased in rats fed Mn-deficient diets for both 4 wk (200%) and 8 wk (250%) when compared with respective control levels. In contrast, Mn deficiency was not associated with alterations in trypsinogen mRNA levels. Serum levels of insulin and corticosterone, hormones known to increase pancreatic amylase mRNA, were not affected by Mn deficiency. These observations suggest that Mn may participate in the regulation of amylase gene expression in a manner that is independent of insulin and corticosterone.\r"

All diets contained 18% protein, which was contributed by S. maxima or by casein or by a mixture of them. Growth results indicated that rats did not utilize the diets containing S. maxima as well as the casein control diet (0% S. maxima) when levels were 10.7% or more of the diet. The ingestion of S. maxima caused a significant increase in dry matter and chloroform-extractable crude fat in the feces. A low level of 2.7% S. maxima caused a significant reduction in plasma, liver and heart alpha-tocopherol levels. The concentrations of alpha-tocopherol in these tissues showed a marked decline with 10.7% S. maxima in the diet, followed by a lesser decline at higher levels. Liver retinoid levels of rats increased when S. maxima was added to the diet, suggesting conversion of the naturally occurring carotenoids in S. maxima to vitamin A. However, the plasma levels of retinol decreased when S. maxima was fed at 10.7% or more. These data demonstrate that S. maxima can significantly alter the storage and utilization of vitamins A and E.\r"

Slices of fetal subcutaneous adipose tissue and placenta were examined for metabolic capacity for glucose and for galactose utilization. No effects of maternal diet were evident upon glycogen content or enzyme activity of fetal semitendinosus muscle and liver. Maternal dietary galactose had no direct effects upon placental glucose oxidation or use for lipid synthesis. However, galactose supplementation of the incubation medium caused reductions in glucose oxidation (15%) and total lipid synthesis (24%) by the maternal placenta. Maternal dietary galactose caused an increase in total lipid (50%) and fatty acid synthesis (200%) from glucose in fetal subcutaneous adipose tissue; direct supplementation of galactose to the incubation medium had no effect on these parameters. The results of the present study suggest that feeding galactose to the pregnant gilt does not have direct effects upon placental metabolism or fetal glycogen storage. However, these data indicate that use of galactose in the maternal diet can result in an increase in the utilization of glucose for lipogenesis by fetal adipose tissue in swine. This effect is not a direct effect of galactose because transport across the placenta was not apparent.\r"

Pigs were kept in pairs (eight pens of two pigs/diet) and fed their respective diets and libitum. Eight pigs (two pens of two pigs fed each diet) were killed at wk 4, 8, 12 and 16 without fasting. Fecal samples were obtained every 2 wk from animals scheduled for necropsy at 16 wk, and colon contents were obtained from all pigs at necropsy; samples were enumerated individually for enterobacteria and Campylobacter sp. Weights of heart, lungs, liver, kidneys, perirenal fat and empty stomach, small intestine and large intestine were recorded at necropsy. Stomach, cecum and proximal colon were sectioned for histopathologic examination. Daily body weight gain was depressed by high dietary protein, but liver and kidneys were heavier in the high protein group than in controls at each time interval. Mild lymphoid hyperplasia of Peyer's patches in the small intestine in some pigs in both groups was indicative of antigenic stimulation but not of pathologic significance. There was no effect of diet on counts of enterobacteria or Campylobacter sp. in feces or colon contents during the 16-wk experiment. We conclude that the hypertrophic response of the tissues of growing pigs to high dietary protein is not the result of the presence of Campylobacter sp. or enterobacteria in the colon contents.\r"

A Latin square design was used, and treatments (daily doses of bST) were administered by intramuscular injection for 14-d periods. Intakes of a total mixed ration were adjusted according to BW at the start of each period. Energy was supplied to allow an estimated daily gain of 0.75 kg, and crude protein intake was increased 15% above recommendations to allow for anticipated increases in protein deposition with bST treatment. Nitrogen balance and nutrient digestibilities were determined on d 7 to 13, and blood samples were obtained on d 14 of treatment. Digestibilities of dry matter, organic matter and N were similar (70 +/- 1%) and not affected by treatments (p greater than 0.1). Nitrogen retention increased, and plasma urea N and urinary N excretion decreased in a dose-dependent manner. Retention of N in heifers receiving the highest bST dose was 23% greater (p less than 0.001) than the zero dose treatment. Serum concentration of insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) was also increased with bST treatment in a curvilinear dose-dependent manner. Plasma glucose increased (5 to 8%, p less than 0.001) with the three highest doses of bST, but serum concentration of insulin was not altered.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Rats were weaned at 16 or 21 d of age onto semisynthetic diets containing either 0 or 4 micrograms retinol/g diet. At the time of study, retinol-depleted rats had serum vitamin A concentrations less than 7% of those of pair-fed controls. In two studies, rats exhibited no external signs of retinol deficiency, but with further depletion some symptoms were observed. Splenic NK cell activity against chromium-51-labeled YAC-1 cells was significantly decreased in vitamin A-depleted rats (22-80% of values for control rats, depending on the degree of retinol deficiency), regardless of the ratio of effector to target cells used. When vitamin A-depleted rats were repleted orally with retinol, NK cell activity was consistently normalized. To understand the possible mechanisms involved in decreasing NK cell activity, we investigated IFN production by concanavalin A-stimulated spleen cells from vitamin A-depleted, from repleted and from control animals. IFN titers were significantly decreased (22-33% of values for control rats) in supernatants of spleen cell cultures of the vitamin A-depleted rats. Repletion with vitamin A resulted in IFN activities ranging from 80 to 130% of controls. Adding alpha/beta IFN in vitro to the spleen cells of vitamin A-depleted animals increased their NK cell activity. The number of spleen cells reacting with a monoclonal antibody specific for rat NK cells was slightly lower in retinol-depleted rats, but not enough to account for the differences in NK cell and IFN activities. These data suggest that vitamin A deficiency affect the nonspecific arm of the immune system, possibly by altering the functional capacity of cells to produce lymphokines needed for the generation of an appropriate cytolytic response.\r"

Fifty-nine patients with 76 abnormal joints were evaluated preoperatively for pain, noise, maximal incisal opening (MIO), and deviation on opening. Preoperative and postoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were obtained for 29 joints. Patients were treated by superior joint arthroscopy, lysis of adhesions, lavage, and steroid injection, along with preoperative and postoperative splint and physiotherapy. Pain, noise, and motion were evaluated at three time periods: 1) early (10 to 30 days); 2) intermediate (1 to 6 months); and 3) late (greater than 6 months). At early, intermediate, and late follow-up, increase in MIO was statistically significant (P less than .05). Noise did not return in the majority of patients. Disc position, evaluated by MRI, did not appear to change in 25 of 29 joints and did not correlate with clinical outcome. The results of this study indicate that TMJ arthroscopy is effective in reducing pain and increasing motion in patients with TMJ internal derangement.\r"

The results showed that a prosthetic buildup is the proper treatment if retention develops after the growth spurt, because in these cases the extent of infraocclusion is slight and relatively stable. If retention develops before the growth spurt, immediate removal of the retained molar followed by orthodontic treatment is the way to maximal success. When retention develops during the growth spurt, the tooth affected has to be observed at 6-month intervals. In such a case, no active treatment is indicated if the neighboring teeth show no tilting and the extent of infraocclusion is minor and stable. In all other cases, the teeth affected have to be removed, followed by orthodontic closure of the edentulous space. Finally, all patients must be screened regularly, because in this investigation, new cases of retention were observed relatively frequently.\r"

Eighteen months postoperatively there was a significant reduction in the CM and SS indices (P less than .001), with significant clinical improvement of the mandibular range of motion (P less than .05). However, a significant reduction of translation (P less than .01) was evident indicating that the increased mandibular opening was owing to a compensatory rotational movement. This study indicates that the composite temporalis pedicle flap is a good autogenous tissue for the reconstruction of the temporomandibular joint.\r"

The following subdivisions of fiber types were used: Type I fibers show weak ATPase activity at pH 9.4, type IM fibers react moderately, and type II fibers react strongly. Rat and mouse masseter muscles contained type II fibers only, as did some rabbit masseter muscles, whereas other rabbit masseter muscles possessed equal amounts of type I and II fibers. Cat and dog masseter muscles possessed both type II and I fibers, with type II predominating. Cow masseter muscle consisted mainly of type I fibers, although some cow masseter muscles contained a very small number of type II fibers. Pig masseter muscle had both type I, II, and IM fibers. One of the characteristics of human masseter muscle is type IM fibers, which are rarely seen in muscles other than the masticatory muscles. Therefore, pig masseter muscle might be a suitable animal model for experimental studies, such as an investigation of the distribution and diameter of fiber types in the masticatory muscles before and after orthognathic surgery.\r"

  ".W": "This study evaluated the tissue reactions to two materials: ceramic hydroxyapatite (CHA), and a composite material of demineralized bone powder (DBP) and CHA (ratio of 4:1) in a collagen vehicle. The materials were tested in a subcutaneous pocket, a mandibular onlay, and in a calvarial onlay model. Specimens were evaluated histologically at 7, 10, 14, and 21 days postimplantation. Ceramic hydroxyapatite, implanted subcutaneously, elicited a fibrous response with minimal inflammation, but did not induce bone formation. In specimens of subcutaneously implanted composite material, induced bone was evident in association with the DBP. In CHA onlay specimens, there was a small amount of reactive bone extending from the host bone into the implant. In composite onlays, bone filled the entire body of the implant. The results of this study indicate that CHA particles were not osteoinductive in heterotopic sites and that osteoconductive ingrowth was minimal in onlays. Bone was induced by DBP even when mixed with CHA particles and implanted in subcutaneous and intraosseous sites. It was concluded that composite implants may provide a means of combining the osteoinductive properties of DBP with the bulk and structural support of osteoconductive CHA particles.\r"

Various examples from art and literature are introduced to give depth and perspective to current popular perceptions.

The protocol was retrospectively evaluated in the first 14 patients (18 involved TMJs) treated and followed postoperatively for at least 1 year. The facial asymmetries present in all unilateral cases remained corrected. The mean maximum postoperative interincisal opening at 1 year was 37.5 mm (292.36% mean increase), lateral excursions were present in 16 of 18 joints (vs 0 of 18 joints preoperatively), and pain was present in 2 of 18 joints (vs 13 of 18 preoperatively). The results of this study indicate that this protocol is effective for treatment of TMJ ankylosis.\r"

In the posterior mandible, the presence of keratinized gingiva was strongly correlated with optimal soft- and hard-tissue health.\r"

Using a special model surgery--measuring platform, measurements of the maxillary dental casts were recorded before and after model surgery was performed by residents in 20 bimaxillary cases. The model surgery was performed in the usual manner described in several texts, using reference lines scored on the casts and measurements made to the incisal pin and upper member of the articulator. Analysis of the differences between the planned movements and the postsurgical position of the maxillary model surgery casts showed statistically significant errors in maxillary repositioning for all measures. This indicates that the manner in which model surgery was performed by the residents, as reported in the literature, was inaccurate. A new technique and instrument for more accurately recording measurements and repositioning the maxillary cast is introduced.\r"

Data from 54 consecutive cases using this modified approach show a reduction in complications, a greater range of use, and consistent healing in radiated and nonradiated tissues without requiring sectioning or removing the clavicle or causing significant chest deformities. These modifications have produced a more predictable transfer compared with other reported techniques.\r"

  ".W": "Studies of the perioral somatosensory capacities of neurologically normal adults were reviewed to determine whether sensitivities within the mental and infraorbital nerve distributions are comparable. It was found that tactile detection sensitivity, spatial acuity, and sensitivity to warmth are greater on skin sites located on the midface than on the lower face. In contrast, sensitivity to direction of motion and to differences in surface texture may be greater on skin sites located on the lower face. The literature further suggests that sensitivity within the distribution of each nerve varies appreciably. For example, the vermilion of the lips exhibits considerably greater vibrotactile detection sensitivity, spatial acuity, and sensitivity to direction of motion than does the perioral hairy skin. In addition, spatial acuity is notably greater on midline structures. These findings suggest that knowledge of the patterns of spatial variations in perioral tactile sensibilities can be effectively used during neurosensory examination to select control skin sites for comparison with areas of suspected neurosensory impairment and to distinguish apparent pathological alterations in tactile sensitivity from normal regional differences that characterize the perioral complex.\r"

Although bone was observed in direct contact with the implant heads, the extremities of the implant heads were surrounded by connective tissue. Compared with the control animals, packing dense HA-collagen around the implant heads did not increase the area of osteogenesis. When the implants penetrated into bone through previously placed HA-collagen blocks, there was a decrease in the amount of bone attached to the body of the implants compared with the controls. The results of this study suggest that the use of dense HA does not increase the amount of bone tissue formed around titanium implants.\r"

The present investigation was undertaken in an attempt to determine whether HPV could be easily detected in biopsies of oral tissues, specifically oral squamous cell carcinomas, oral epithelial dysplasias, smokeless tobacco keratoses, verrucous hyperplasia, and verrucous carcinoma. In situ DNA hybridization methods were used to isolate specific HPV genomes. Among 100 instances of benign leukoplakia, only 4% of non-tobacco-related and 10% of smokeless tobacco-related lesions harbored viral sequences. We were able to detect viral sequences in dysplastic lesions 3% of the time. Alternatively, 17% and 20% of the verrucous hyperplasias and verrucous carcinomas were positive for viral nucleic acids. Six percent of the squamous cell carcinomas harbored HPV. On the basis of these findings, it is concluded that HPV of known genotype can be identified in oral premalignant and malignant neoplasms.\r"

Biographical data were collected and responses evaluated for the following groups: 1) the nation as a whole, 2) geographic regions of practice, 3) population, 4) number of years in practice, and 5) involvement in academic programs. Questions concerning the spectrum of privileges as well as referrals and desire to possess a medical degree were asked. Substantially different responses were seen between the MD/non-MD oral and maxillofacial (OMF) surgeons as well as differences between geographic locations, years in practice, and academic involvement. In general, MD and academic OMF surgeons possessed a broader spectrum of privileges than their colleagues. No consistent patterns were seen between the various geographic regions. No significant differences existed in privileges based on the size of a community in which a surgeon practices. A greater or equal percentage of privileges was possessed by more recently trained OMF surgeons than their more experienced colleagues. The results presented may aid future graduates in making a more informed decision when considering obtaining a medical degree.\r"

  ".W": "We hypothesized that plasma arginine vasopressin (AVP) concentrations in children with meningitis are appropriate for the children's degree of hypovolemia, even though the concentrations were higher than expected for the serum osmolality. A randomized study was conducted to compare the effect on plasma AVP concentrations of giving maintenance fluid requirements plus replacement of any deficit versus restricting fluids to two thirds of maintenance requirements for 24 hours. Plasma AVP concentrations and serum osmolality were measured before fluid therapy was begun and again after 24 hours. Nineteen children, 2 months to 17 years of age, were studied; 13 had bacterial meningitis (12 with Haemophilus influenzae type b). Ten children (seven with bacterial meningitis) received a mean of 1.42 times the calculated maintenance fluid requirements, and nine (six with bacterial meningitis) were restricted to a mean of 0.65 times maintenance. Children in the maintenance group also received significantly more sodium (mean = 6.3 mEq/kg/24 hr) than children in the fluid-restricted group (mean = 2.0 mEq/kg/24 hr). The two groups were comparable for plasma AVP concentration and serum osmolality before fluid therapy was begun. The plasma AVP concentration was significantly lower after 24 hours of maintenance plus replacement fluids than after fluid restriction (p = 0.005), and the change in AVP concentration correlated with the amount of sodium given (p less than 0.02). This study supports the hypothesis that serum AVP concentrations are elevated in patients with meningitis because of hypovolemia and become normal when sufficient sodium is given to facilitate reabsorption of water by the proximal tubule of the kidney. Patients with meningitis can be given maintenance plus replacement fluids but should be monitored for the development of the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone.\r"

  ".W": "Because polymorphonuclear neutrophils are the most important component of host defense against bacteria, we assessed their function in 13 children with asymptomatic and 12 with symptomatic infection with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), and compared their values with healthy adult control values. The functions assessed were (1) chemotaxis, (2) bacterial phagocytosis, (3) superoxide generation, and (4) bactericidal activity. Chemotaxis of polymorphonuclear neutrophils toward the chemoattractant N-formylmethionyl leucyl phenylalanine (FMLP) was significantly decreased in symptom-free infected children compared with control subjects (p less than 0.0001), but was increased in children with symptomatic infection (p less than 0.025). Bactericidal activity of the neutrophils against Staphylococcus aureus was defective in 8 of 12 children with asymptomatic infection (p = 0.016), and in 8 of 9 children with symptomatic infection (p less than 0.00001). Superoxide generation by polymorphonuclear neutrophils on stimulation with FMLP and phagocytosis of S. aureus were normal. Serum from patients with symptomatic HIV-1 infection was not as efficient in low concentrations as normal serum in the ability to opsonize S. aureus. The in vitro bactericidal defect was partially corrected by granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). The results suggest that both cellular (neutrophils) and humoral defects contribute to the increased incidence of bacterial infections in HIV-1-infected children, and that GM-CSF may improve the defective bactericidal activity of polymorphonuclear neutrophils in these patients.\r"

  ".W": "To assess whether neuroendocrine dysfunction is present in children with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and growth failure, we evaluated the thyroid, adrenal, and growth hormone-insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-1) axes in nine children with AIDS and failure to thrive. Basal thyroid-stimulating hormone, free thyroxine, and triiodothyronine levels were normal in eight of the nine children and indicated primary hypothyroidism in one child; thyroxine levels were elevated in four and normal in five children. Thyroxine-binding globulin levels were elevated in all children. Serial measurements of thyroid-stimulating hormone, made hourly from 2 to 6 pm and from 10 pm to 2 am, revealed a flat diurnal rhythm of thyroid-stimulating hormone in six children, which may indicate early central hypothyroidism, and a normal nocturnal rise in the remaining three children. Basal plasma corticotropin and aldosterone levels were normal in all children, plasma renin levels were normal in three and elevated in six children, and cortisol levels were normal or elevated in all children. Corticotropin-stimulated cortisol levels exceeded 500 nmol/L (18 micrograms/dl) in all children except one, who was receiving treatment with ketoconazole. Thus adrenocortical function appeared to be grossly intact. The peak growth hormone responses to provocative testing was normal (greater than 7 ng/ml) in eight children and low in one child. The plasma level of insulin-like growth factor I was normal in eight of the nine children and low in one child. We conclude that growth failure in children with AIDS does not usually result from a recognized endocrine cause and that adrenal function is usually normal. However, endocrine deficiency may contribute to morbidity in some children with AIDS.\r"

The involved muscles had increased signal intensity on the T2-weighted images (SE 2500/80) and normal appearance on the T1-weighted images (SE 600/20). The involvement of the muscles was not uniform. There was good correlation between the distribution of muscle involvement by MRI and functional testing. Follow-up MRI scans in patients with favorable outcome demonstrated that the affected muscles had returned to normal signal intensity. Although the MRI findings are not specific, in the proper clinical context they may be helpful in establishing the diagnosis of dermatomyositis. MRI may also be used in establishing an appropriate muscle biopsy site. In addition, MRI may be used for monitoring the progress of the disease.\r"

Ten children with sickle cell hemoglobinopathy and a history of acute neurologic syndromes were studied with combined parenchymal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and MRA. Six had abnormal MRI findings and MRA-defined luminal lesions in the vascular distribution of these parenchymal infarctions. The three children with previous intraarterial angiography had MRA abnormalities that corresponded with vascular lesions on conventional angiograms. Four had normal MRI and MRA findings. We conclude that a combination of MRI and MRA provides a noninvasive screening test for large-vessel disease in this population.\r"

  ".W": "Ten children with renal failure (age range 2 years 6 months to 18 years 9 months; median 11 years 10 months), maintained by long-term hemodialysis, had successful correction of their anemia after intravenous administration of recombinant human erythropoietin in a dosage escalating every 2 weeks (75 to 150 to 300 to 450 IU/kg/wk). Mean hemoglobin concentration increased from 6.4 +/- 0.9 to 11.5 +/- 1.0 gm/dl. Blood cell counts used to evaluate the correction of anemia were done after dialysis; this was especially important for children less compliant with water restriction. The higher hemoglobin concentration resulted in improvement of the quality of life, a greater tolerance for physical effort (exercise tolerance doubled and the ventilatory anaerobic threshold increased significantly), correction of some subclinical central nervous system abnormalities detected by evoked potentials testing, and reduction of bleeding time. Few side effects were noted; severe hypertension developed in one patient when postdialysis hematocrit was only 28%, and there were two episodes of hypertransaminasemia with no other evidence of liver dysfunction. We conclude that in children with renal failure the use of recombinant human erythropoietin to correct anemia is safe and strongly advisable, because of the resolution of many of the symptoms correlated with anemia.\r"

  ".W": "For 16 years the double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenge (DBPCFC) has been used at the National Jewish Center for Immunology and Respiratory Medicine to determine whether adverse reactions to foods do occur in children. The objective of these studies was to explore these reproducible adverse reactions and to characterize them. Although skin testing was performed on all subjects, a history of an adverse reaction to food and to subsequent DBPCFC were the only criteria for entry into this study. Of 480 children studied, 185 (39%) have had positive DBPCFC results. In these 480 children, 245 (24%) of 1014 DBPCFCs showed positive results. Egg, peanut, and cow milk accounted for 73% of the positive DBPCFC reactions, but many foods produced reactions. Skin test results were positive in most children with a positive DBPCFC reaction, but the large number of patients with asymptomatic hypersensitivity limited the accuracy of a positive skin test result alone as a predictor of clinical symptoms during food ingestion. Evaluation of results in this large number of children for a prolonged period revealed reproducible patterns of symptoms, timing, and incriminated foods. Placebo reactions were rare. The procedure was safe. Twelve youngsters with a negative DBPCFC result subsequently had positive reactions to open challenges when large amounts of the challenge food were used. In each of these cases the reactions were limited to areas of direct contact with the food or could be explained by the larger amount of food ingested during the open challenge. Multiple food hypersensitivity has been a rare finding. The DBPCFC should be the \"gold standard\" for both research and clinical diagnostic evaluations until it is superseded by methods that have yet to be developed.\r"

  ".U": "91011883\r", 
  ".W": "Using event recording, we determined how often apnea exceeding 15 seconds in duration was associated with bradycardia and how often patients with apnea resumed breathing spontaneously. Of 1306 documented apnea events exceeding 15 seconds (54 patients), 926 lasted 16 to 20 seconds, 262 lasted 21 to 25 seconds, and 118 exceeded 25 seconds. Of these episodes, 75.3% were isolated and 14.9% were associated with pulse deceleration, 4.4% with irregular transthoracic impedance, and 5.4% with bradycardia. Event recording provided data supporting discontinuation of monitoring in 50 of 54 patients: 36 spontaneously resumed breathing before the auditory alarm and 14 had a decreased incidence of apnea with maturation. Follow-up of 51 patients (three not located) showed that none had subsequent apparent life-threatening events or sudden infant death syndrome. Our results in these older infants and children (median age 6.7 months) provide substantiation that such patients with apnea of less than 20 seconds without bradycardia do not require continued monitoring. Further, these data suggest that in selected older infants, longer isolated apnea may be well tolerated; however, hemoglobin saturation during sleep and the ability to resume breathing after the apnea alarm delay is prolonged should be verified. Our patient population had a wide age range and heterogeneity of diagnoses, and was typically free of symptoms, so these results should not be extrapolated uncritically to premature infants, infants with chronic lung disease, and patients with symptomatic apnea.\r"
