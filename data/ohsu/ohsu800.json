During the study, 31 (70%) of these patients achieved a greater than 70% reduction in PASI score, 39 (88%) achieved a greater than 60% reduction and 42 (95%) a greater than 50% reduction. The mean initial dose of CyA was 3 mg/kg/day and the mean dose was 3.3 mg/kg/day throughout the study. Twenty-five (57%) patients were maintained on less than or equal to 3 mg and six (14%) required greater than 5 mg/kg/day for limited periods to obtain significant improvement. In three of these patients, this was achieved with 6 mg/kg/day but, of the remainder, one required 7 mg and two required 10 mg/kg/day. Of the 44 patients, 32 (73%) are still taking CyA. Patients were discontinued because of: side-effects directly attributable to treatment (n = 4); remission of psoriasis (n = 4); death (n = I); defaulting (n = I); infrequent attendance (n = I); high doses of NSAID were necessary for arthritis (n = I). Before starting CyA, 39 patients were normotensive; 21 (54%) developed mild hypertension. In 28 patients where the GFRs were estimated before and during treatment, there was a 16% reduction (P less than 0.0001) during a mean period of 8 months. Two patients developed malignancies. The incidence of hypertension and percentage decrease in GFR were strongly correlated with the dose required to control the psoriasis.\r"

  ".W": "Cyclosporin A (CyA) is the forerunner of a new generation of immunosuppressive drugs. It is highly effective in both antibody- and cell-mediated immunity and in inhibiting chronic inflammatory reactions. Cyclosporin A is, therefore, widely used to prevent rejection in clinical organ transplantation and appears to be very promising in the treatment of several autoimmune diseases, in particular psoriasis. Cyclosporin A is not only effective when given at the time of sensitization (prevention of rejection), but also when administered therapeutically during an immune response, such as during the active course of an autoimmune disease. The most important aspect of its immunosuppressive mechanism is the inhibition of lymphokine production secreted by activated T cells. The pharmacological effects of CyA are rapid in onset, dose-dependent and often quickly reversible when treatment is stopped.\r"

Functional changes to the tubules and vessels are common, occur at low doses and are reversible, while structural changes to the tubules and vessels are rare, occur at high doses and are not always reversible. The changes of importance are vascular. By harnessing two strategies to restrain the development of side-effects--limiting the dose and restricting the functional changes--it is possible to avoid irreversible damage to the kidney in patients treated with CyA.\r"

Both serum creatinine and serum urea provided reasonable estimates of the decline in glomerular filtration rate when measured simultaneously and when compared to patients' own baseline values. Combination of both serum creatinine and serum urea improved the assessment of renal dysfunction, partly by reducing the influence of any analytical errors. Frequent measurements, precise baseline evaluation and standardization of procedures can be expected to increase further the precision of assessing renal dysfunction from serum measurements. Hence, careful evaluation of changes in serum creatinine, with the option to include changes in serum urea, can provide a simple and reliable way of monitoring changes in renal function in patients taking CyA for autoimmune diseases.\r"

These patients received either CyA 2.5 mg/kg/day (n = 134) or 5 mg/kg/day (n = 59). In addition, a subgroup of 94 patients also had CyA trough levels measured using a non-specific polyclonal RIA. Within each CyA dose group, no difference was detected between mean CyA trough levels in relation to success or failure nor to the presence or absence of renal dysfunction with the use of either the specific or non-specific RIA. Based on the experience in transplantation, CyA thresholds of 100 and 200 ng/ml (specific) were selected for the assessment of efficacy and renal dysfunction. The success rate was higher by 10-15% when the CyA level was above, rather than below, 100 ng/ml in both the CyA 2.5 mg and 5 mg/kg/day groups. A slightly increased incidence of renal dysfunction was only found in the 5 mg/kg/day group when the CyA level was above 200 ng/ml. Because of its low predictive value, measurement of the level of CyA was not particularly useful for monitoring patients with psoriasis treated with low-dose CyA.\r"

Two differentiation inducers and three MELC variants have been studied. Hexamethylene bisacetamide (HMBA) initiates more rapid commitment than does dimethylsulfoxide (Me2SO). MELC variant DR10 is resistant to induction by Me2SO and responds sluggishly to HMBA, in comparison with the DS19-Sc9 variant. V3.17, an MELC variant resistant to low concentrations of vincristine, shows increased sensitivity to the inducers and an accelerated rate of commitment to terminal differentiation compared with DS19-Sc9. It is demonstrated that commitment and the actual expression of differentiation, as measured by the accumulation of alpha-, beta maj-, and beta min-globin mRNA, are temporally coordinated functions during induced differentiation of a transformed cell line by exposure to polar/apolar agents.\r"

By day 7, their bone marrow also contained elevated numbers of progenitors that form small eosinophil colonies (20 to 50 cells) in soft agar cultures supplemented with interleukin-5 (IL-5). However, when mice were infused with anti-IL-5 antibodies at the time of infection, the number of recognizable eosinophils present in bone marrow remained low and eventually dropped below normal levels. The antibody treatment also prevented increased generation of IL-5-responsive precursors capable of differentiating into mature eosinophils in liquid culture and inhibited the generation of progenitor cells capable of forming small eosinophil colonies or clusters in soft agar cultures. The results of these in vivo experiments directly show that IL-5 is an essential regulatory molecule required for the bone marrow-dependent phase of a parasite-induced eosinophilia.\r"

  ".U": "90315431\r", 
  ".W": "Platelet factor 4 (PF4) is a 70 amino acid heparin-binding protein released from the alpha-granules of activated platelets. Its exact biologic function is not known, although PF4 is a member of a multigene family involved in chemotaxis, coagulation, inflammation, and cell growth. We previously cloned the cDNA for human PF4 from a human erythroleukemic (HEL) cell expression library. We now report the isolation and sequence determination of the gene for human PF4. This gene contains three exons and spans approximately 1,000 basepairs (bp). Concurrently, we have cloned a highly homologous gene that we have called PF4alt. We show that PF4 and PF4alt are non-allelic genes: the human PF4 gene is encoded on a 10 kilobasepairs (kb) EcoRI fragment, and its DNA sequence agrees with protein and cDNA data for PF4, while PF4alt is encoded in a polymorphic 3 or 5 kb EcoRI fragment. Compared with PF4, this gene has 14% DNA and 38% amino acid divergence in the signal peptide region, and 2.6% DNA and 4.3% amino acid divergence in the coding region of the mature protein. PF4alt contains three amino acid substitutions (P58----L, K66----E, and L67----H) near the C-terminus, in a region known to be critical for PF4 function. Primer extension studies show the 5'-untranslated region of PF4 is 73 bp long. A TATA box is present 30 bp 5' to the transcription start site. A 90 bp stretch of pyrimidines (including 53 consecutive thymidine residues) begins at -227 bp and is analogous to a similar region of 30 residues 5' to the rodent PF4 gene. This pyrimidine-rich region is absent from the PF4alt gene; however, DNA homology exists between the two human genes in the 5'- and 3'-flanking regions and extends for over 3.6 kb. Alternating purine/pyrimidine tracts occur both 5' and 3' to PF4 and PF4alt but do not define the endpoints of the gene duplication, which extend beyond these sequences at least at the 5' end. Northern blot analysis using gene-specific oligonucleotides and platelet RNA showed an 800 or 900 nucleotide (n) message for PF4 and PF4alt, respectively. Northern blot and primer extension studies show that steady-state platelet PF4 mRNA levels are approximately one magnitude greater than PF4alt mRNA levels. Thus, these studies demonstrate that PF4alt mRNA is expressed in platelets. Whether PF4alt protein is expressed remains to be determined, and the nature of its biologic function needs to be studied.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "We have investigated the molecular basis of thrombus formation by measuring the extent of platelet deposition from flowing whole blood onto fibrin-coated glass coverslips under well-defined shear conditions in a rectangular perfusion chamber. Platelets readily and specifically adhered to fibrin-coated coverslips in 5 minute perfusion experiments done at either low (300 s-1) or high (1,300 s-1) wall shear rates. Scanning electron microscopic examination of fibrin-coated coverslips after perfusions showed surface coverage by a monolayer of adherent, partly spread platelets. Platelet adhesion to fibrin was effectively inhibited by a monoclonal antibody (MoAb) specific for glycoprotein (GP) IIb:IIIa. The dose-response curve for inhibition of adhesion by anti-GPIIb:IIIa at both shear rates paralleled that for inhibition of platelet aggregation. Platelet aggregation and adhesion to fibrin were also blocked by low concentrations of prostacyclin. In contrast, anti-GPIb reduced adhesion by 40% at 300 s-1 and by 70% at 1,300 s-1. A similar pattern of shear rate-dependent, incomplete inhibition resulted with a MoAb specific for the GPIb-recognition region of von Willebrand factor (vWF). Platelets from an individual with severe von Willebrand's disease, whose plasma and platelets contained essentially no vWF, exhibited defective adhesion to fibrin, especially at the higher shear rate. Addition of purified vWF restored adhesion to normal values. These results are consistent with a two-site model for platelet adhesion to fibrin, in which the GPIIb:IIIa complex is the primary receptor, with GPIb:vWF providing a secondary adhesion pathway that is especially important at high wall shear rates.\r"

It has been documented that chemical or physical damage to cell membranes can cause a rapid increase in the expression of tissue factor procoagulant activity. In this study, antibody-mediated complement activation at the cell surface resulted in increased tissue factor activity, which correlated with cytolysis, as measured by 51-chromium release. Therefore, complement fixation on the cell surface can have a direct and immediate stimulatory effect on the coagulation cascade at the point of its initiation, with formation of a fibrin clot requiring only three consecutive proteolytic reactions after immunologically mediated cell damage.\r"

The selective enrichment of CML A-LAK cells depended on their propensity to adhere to plastic and to proliferate when cultured in the presence of rIL-2 for 14 days. In both CP and AD patients, 14-day culture resulted in growth of a uniform population of large granular lymphocytes. While less than 10% of the A-LAK cells were CD56-/CD3+ (mature T lymphocytes), 82% +/- 12% of A-LAK cells from early CP patients (diagnosed less than 1 year from study), 84% +/- 3% of A-LAK cells from late CP patients (studied greater than 1 year after diagnosis), and 87% +/- 3% of A-LAK cells from AD patients were CD56+/CD3- (activated natural killer [NK] cells). No bcr gene rearrangement could be found in A-LAK cells from 13 CP and six AD CML patients studied. A-LAK cells from seven early CP CML patients displayed similar cytotoxicity against K562 (80% +/- 7% lysis at effector:target ratio of 20:1) and against Raji (80% +/- 12% lysis) compared with A-LAK from 17 normal individuals (72% +/- 3% K562 lysis, P = .21; 74% +/- 5% Raji lysis, P = .39). However, the cytotoxicity of A-LAK cells from eight late CP patients (59% +/- 5% K562 lysis, P = .02; 52% +/- 8% Raji lysis, P = .02) and that of 10 AD patients studied at any point after diagnosis (31% +/- 3% K562 lysis, P less than .001; 25% +/- 6% Raji lysis, P less than .001) was significantly lower than that of seven early CP CML patients and 17 normals. The proliferative potential of A-LAK cells from seven early CP CML patients (291 +/- 191-fold) was significantly greater than that of A-LAK cells from 17 normal individuals (23 +/- 3-fold, P = .03), eight late CP patients (46 +/- 17-fold, P = .02), and 10 AD patients (5.4 +/- 1.9-fold, P = .01). In contrast to CML A-LAK, K562 cytotoxicity of unstimulated mature peripheral blood NK cells was significantly lower in early CP CML patients than in normals and remained low at all stages of disease.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

To see if this extends to patients treated with high dose therapy and autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, we reviewed the results with this treatment approach at our institution. From October, 1983, to May, 1988, 41 patients who underwent high-dose therapy and autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant for recurrent non-Hodgkin's lymphoma were re-biopsied before transplantation to determine their immunophenotype. Seventeen of these patients were found to have a T-cell lymphoma, and 24 had a B-cell lymphoma. All patients were included in the intermediate or high grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma categories, and none were histologically transformed from a low grade lymphoma. Analysis of the response to autologous transplantation in these two patient populations revealed a slightly better complete response rate for patients with T-cell lymphoma (ie, 59% versus 42%, P = NS). The actuarial 2-year survival was 35% in the T-cell group compared with 30% in the B-cell group (P = NS). The 2-year disease-free survival was 28% for the T-cell and 17% for the B-cell patients. Our results with autologous transplantation for salvage therapy revealed equivalent long-term survival and disease-free survival in both relapsed T- and B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.\r"

  ".W": "AIM--To re-examine the contentious relation between diet and plasma lipids within a population. DESIGN--Cross sectional sample from a large prospective cohort study of people eating different diets in Britain. Blood samples and diet records collected from subjects. SUBJECTS--Volunteers eating one of four distinct diets--namely, vegans, vegetarians, fish eaters who do not eat meat, and meat eaters. 52 Subjects selected from each group. METHODS--Examination of the relation between nutritional intake recorded in a four day dietary record and plasma lipid concentrations of subjects measured in blood samples collected previously. RESULTS--After controlling for age, sex, and body mass index, the correlation between plasma total cholesterol and the Keys score (which includes dietary cholesterol and saturated and polyunsaturated fat) was 0.37 (p less than 0.001). The mean saturated fat intake in all groups was low (6-14% of energy), but polyunsaturated fat intake was high, so mean total fat intake was generally above that recommended. A high dietary fibre intake was not associated with high carbohydrate intake. Plasma high density lipoprotein values were not associated with any measure of fat intake, but there was a significant correlation of 0.24 between high density lipoprotein values and alcohol intake. CONCLUSIONS--The nature rather than quantity of dietary fat is an important determinant of cholesterol concentrations. Health conscious individuals select a fat modified, rather than a low fat--high carbohydrate diet. National cholesterol lowering dietary advice should be reconsidered.\r"

Parents of the children being studied were asked to fill in a questionnaire regarding the children's frequency of consumption of various foods. Parents of children with diabetes were asked about the period before onset of the disease. SETTING--Population based study throughout Sweden. SUBJECTS--339 Children aged 0-14 who had recently developed insulin dependent diabetes mellitus and 528 control children matched for age, sex, and county of residence who were traced through the official Swedish population register. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Foods were classified according to their content of protein, fat, carbohydrates, monosaccharides or disaccharides, nitrosamines, nitrates or nitrites, vitamin C, and fibres. The frequency of intake was categorised as high, medium, and low and the relative risk for developing insulin dependent diabetes was estimated for the three frequencies of intake and calculated as odds ratios. RESULTS--Significant linear trends for dose response in odds ratios by frequency of intake were shown for solid foods containing high amounts of protein (odds ratio for low frequency of intake 1.0; medium 2.3; and high 5.5), and nitrosamines (1.0; 1.7; 2.6) and significant but non-linear trends were found for carbohydrates (1.0; 1.3; 4.4) and nitrates or nitrites (1.0; 0.8; 2.4). The significant trends were not affected when the results were standardised for possible confounders. No significant increases in odds ratios were found for protein, monosaccharides and disaccharides, vitamin C, and fibres. CONCLUSION--Nutrients and food additives such as protein, carbohydrate, and nitrosamine compounds may influence the risk of developing insulin dependent diabetes in childhood and significant trends in odds ratios indicate a causal relation.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVES--To estimate changes in the prevalence of reported symptoms of respiratory disease and reported diagnoses of asthma and bronchitis in primary school children in England between 1973 and 1986. DESIGN--Mixed longitudinal survey. SETTING--Representative sample of English primary schools in 22 areas. PARTICIPANTS--15,000 Boys and 14,156 girls each studied at least once between 1973 and 1986. DATA COLLECTED--Whether, according to the parent or guardian, the child had wheezed, wheezed on most days or nights, or had attacks of bronchitis or asthma in the past year. RESULTS--Within age groups trends in successive annual cohorts showed an increasing prevalence of asthma for each annual birth cohort (boys, 6.9%, p less than 0.001; girls, 12.8%, p less than 0.001) and of wheeze on most days or nights (boys, 4.3% per cohort, p less than 0.001; girls, 6.1% per cohort, p less than 0.001) and a falling prevalence of bronchitis (boys, -4.7% per cohort, p less than 0.001; girls, -5.8% per cohort, p less than 0.001). There was a smaller increase in the prevalence of wheeze whether or not it occurred on most days or nights, and this increase was significant only among the girls (boys, 1.0% per cohort, p greater than 0.05; girls, 1.7% per cohort, p less than 0.05). Although the rate of increase of \"asthma\" was greater than the rate of decrease in \"bronchitis,\" the baseline prevalence of asthma was much lower than that of bronchitis, and the total proportion of children with either diagnosis declined slightly over the whole period. The main change was an increase in the proportion of children whose parents stated that they had persistent wheeze and yet did not have a report of either \"asthma\" or \"bronchitis.\" CONCLUSIONS--These results suggest that there has been a true increase in morbidity that is not simply due to changes in diagnostic fashion. The increase is large enough to explain much if not all of the increase in admission to hospital and mortality, and it underlines the importance of an understanding of the aetiology of asthma in tackling the causes of the recent increase.\r"

RESULTS--56 Patients had stones successfully removed percutaneously. In four patients failure of access necessitated a cholecystectomy under the same anaesthetic. Two patients had an empyema of the gall bladder drained initially, followed by a second operation to remove the stones one week later. Seven patients had postoperative complications, and two had recurrences of biliary calculi. CONCLUSIONS--The techniques and instruments used in percutaneous nephrolithotomy can successfully be adapted for percutaneous removal of gall stones. The procedure is suitable for a wider range of patients than other techniques that leave the gall bladder intact.\r"

A survey was carried out of general practitioner principals in Grampian and a sample elsewhere in Scotland to examine their attitudes towards considering costs when prescribing and assess the accuracy of their knowledge of drug costs. Most general practitioners agreed that costs should be borne in mind when choosing medicines but their knowledge of drug costs was often inaccurate. Only one third of estimates were correct to within 25% of the actual cost, and there was a tendency to overstate the cost of cheap drugs and understate the cost of expensive ones. Some general practitioners were not aware of the relative prices of competing products or proprietary products and generic equivalents. The findings highlight the importance of providing general practitioners with readily accessible and up to date information on drug costs if prescribing budgets are to work.\r"

It has been suggested that these services should aim at avoiding admitting patients for hospital care whose lives may be ended by the upset of admission or prolonged by inappropriate nursing and medical interventions. A review of the characteristics of patients dying during one year while under the care of a psychogeriatric service showed that one in three died as a psychogeriatric inpatient, the remainder dying at home or as inpatients in a general hospital. Those dying as psychogeriatric inpatients differed in their clinical and social characteristics from those dying elsewhere and it seemed unlikely that they could have been cared for humanely without the resources of the hospital ward. Psychogeriatric practice has many similarities to the work of hospices with other terminally ill patients, but the duration of the terminal illness and the needs arising from it are often more prolonged. Probably the management of dying among psychogeriatric patients will be improved if lessons learnt from other hospice practices are adopted.\r"

Cases were analyzed in relation to tumor size, steroid receptors, histologic and nuclear grade, age, and type of therapy, none of which showed a significant relationship to relapse or survival. There were 22% well-differentiated, 20% moderately differentiated, and 56% poorly differentiated or anaplastic tumors. Estimated disease-free survival (DFS) for this group was 91% at 7 years, and overall survival 96% for the same period. There were five relapses (all among poorly differentiated tumors) and three deaths unrelated to breast cancer. With the three deaths censored, 100% of the well-differentiated and moderately differentiated tumors were disease-free at 7 years versus 91% for poorly differentiated and anaplastic tumors (P = 0.076). These data suggest that node-negative patients with minimal invasive breast cancer are highly curable by primary surgical therapy alone, and the authors believe that these patients are not appropriate candidates for adjuvant therapy until such time as subgroups at high risk of recurrence can be identified.\r"

Treatment consisted of two courses of chemotherapy with 5-FU (1 g/m2/day in continuous infusion for 5 days [days 1 to 5 and days 29 to 33] ) and cisplatin (70 mg/m2 intravenous bolus at days 2 and 30). Radiation therapy was concomitant in two courses delivering 20 Gy in 5 days (days 1 to 5 and days 29 to 33). On the first day of treatment, endoscopic peroral dilation or Nd-YAG laser therapy was usually carried out. At the end of the treatment, all of the patients were capable of oral nutrition. Histoendoscopic confirmation was made 8 weeks after the beginning of the therapy. Twenty-five of the 35 patients had a complete response with negative biopsy findings. There was only one serious complication (fatal myelosuppression) in the only patient who received more than two courses of chemotherapy. Sixteen patients died and 19 were still alive at 3 to 42 months after the beginning of treatment. Overall median survival for the 35 patients is 17 months. Actuarial survival was 55 +/- 18% at 1 year and 41 +/- 21% at 2 years. The median survival of the Stage I and II patients is 28 months. These results confirm that concomitant chemoradiotherapy is capable of producing a very high histoendoscopic complete response rate and improved 1-year and 2-year survival. The use of concentrated split-course radiotherapy enabled the authors to reduce the total length of the treatment to two periods of 5 days, with results that are similar to previous studies using classic radiotherapy for a 5-week to 7-week period.\r"

The drug was delivered by Medtronic Synchromed implantable pump (Medtronic, Inc., Minneapolis, MN) in 14-day cycles alternating with 14-day intervals of heparinized physiologic saline infusion. In the course of 24 months 444 cycles of therapy have been given for a total of 12449 days of pump function. Of the patients observed for at least 3 months (range, 3 to 23 months; median, 7 months) three showed complete response (7%; 95% confidence interval, 0% to 15%), three partial response (7%; confidence interval, 0% to 15%), 18 stable disease, and 18 showed progression. Eighteen patients, all with advanced disease at the time of implantation, were living 6 months after treatment started. Circadian continuous central venous infusion of FUDR is minimally toxic. The FUDR can be delivered safely and conveniently in this way for long spans. This therapy is as active as any currently available treatment, is administered in an entirely outpatient setting, and is associated with a normal quality of life.\r"

The authors evaluated the treatment of this problem in four patients with prostaglandin intravesical therapy. Each patient had failed to respond to conservative management. Carboprost tromethamine (Hemabate) was instilled into the bladder, with dwell times ranging from 45 to 60 minutes, three to four times a day for 4 to 5 days. Two of the patients required a second course with carboprost tromethamine at an increased concentration. A third patient's treatment was stopped after the first 5-day course because of intractable bladder spasms and persistent hematuria. In the three patients who completed the full course of therapy the hematuria resolved completely. The only side effect noted was bladder spasms, which were controlled in three of the four patients with oxybutynin chloride. This preliminary evaluation suggests that carboprost tromethamine may be a safe and effective bedside treatment of cyclophosphamide-induced hemorrhagic cystitis.\r"

  ".W": "Acute tumor lysis syndrome resulting from rapid neoplastic cell lysis after chemotherapy is an unusual event, generally seen in histological aggressive lymphatic tumors. The authors saw four patients who developed acute tumor lysis syndrome when treated for advanced-stage, refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) with an initial cycle of cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C) 2 g/m2 every 12 hours x 4, cisplatin 35 mg/m2 every 24 hours x 2, and etoposide 100 mg/m2 every 24 hours x 2 (ACE). With aggressive hydration, urine alkalinization, forced diuresis, and high-dose allopurinol, acute tumor lysis syndrome was not seen in three subsequent cases of CLL treated with ACE. Of a total of eight patients treated, seven patients had marked reductions in lymphocyte counts after the first course of ACE. Of the eight patients, three are alive: one in a complete remission greater than 2 years, one in partial remission after three cycles of ACE, and one in Richter's transformation to large cell lymphoma. The remaining patients died after one cycle of ACE chemotherapy, one as a direct complication of acute tumor lysis and pancytopenia, and four others from complications of severe pancytopenia and general debilitation. Therefore, ACE appears to cause a rapid dissolution of tumor cells in CLL, and with appropriate aggressive management of the tumor lysis and infectious complications may have a favorable impact on survival in advanced CLL.\r"

Thirty-three patients with cervical carcinoma and surgically documented nodal metastases received primary, extended-field radiation therapy. Overall 2-year and 5-year actuarial survival rates after diagnosis were 37% and 31%, respectively. Survival was analyzed in terms of the variables patient age, clinical stage, tumor histologic type, the presence of enlarged paraaortic/high common iliac lymph nodes, the extent of nodal involvement (microscopic versus macroscopic), the presence of intraperitoneal disease, and whether intracavitary brachytherapy was administered. The use of intracavitary radiation therapy was associated with improved local control and survival (P = 0.017). None of the other variables were statistically related to patient survival. Twenty-two of the patients died of cervical cancer and five are surviving without evidence of cancer. Four patients died of intercurrent disease. Two patients developed bowel-related radiation complications; both patients received chemotherapy concurrent with the radiation therapy. One of the two patients died of radiation enteritis. The use of extended-field radiation therapy does benefit a small group of patients and may result in extended patient survival.\r"

  ".W": "Tumor burden is an important predictor of survival in patients with diffuse large cell lymphoma (DLCL). The authors reviewed the charts of 147 patients with early stage presentation (Stage I-IE and II-IIE) seen from 1974 through 1984. The 10-year survival for the 85 patients with bulky disease was 54% compared with 76% for those who did not have bulky disease. Of the 62 with nonbulky disease, 14 had been rendered so by removal of greater than 80% of the initial tumor mass (surgical debulking). The authors compared these 14 patients with a matched control group of 14 patients selected from the 85 with bulky disease who had equivalent stage, therapy, site, size of initial mass, performance status, and sex and age. All had received similar therapy with cyclophosphamide, Adriamycin (doxorubicin), vincristine, prednisone, bleomycin, and radiotherapy to the involved field. At a 7-year follow-up, the 14 debulked patients had a better survival when compared with the matched controls (93% versus 35%, P = 0.003). The authors also analyzed the initial serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels. Preoperative LDH values were available in six of 14 debulked patients. In the three with elevated LDH levels at presentation, surgical debulking was associated with subsequent decreased LDH levels, which is known to be associated with better prognosis. The other three presented with normal values that remained normal after surgery. These data suggest a potentially important role for surgery as front-line therapy in patients with Stage I-IE and II-IIE bulky DLCL whose disease is deemed resectable. More studies are needed in order to better define this role as well as to determine how frequently and safely surgical debulking can be performed.\r"

A small number of the patients with this disease face an unfavorable disease course despite chemotherapy and radiation therapy. In LCH patients with a poor prognosis, allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) could be the appropriate treatment with proven antiproliferative effects and may be able to repopulate the recipient with stem cell-derived Langerhans' cells from the donor or correct the presumed underlying immunodeficiency. An LCH was diagnosed in a 15-year-old boy with multiple osteolytic lesions, anemia, and diabetes insipidus centralis. Repeated flare-ups of the disease had necessitated several courses of conventional chemotherapy including cyclophosphamide (CY), prednisolone (P), 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP), vincristine (VCR), and additional local irradiation without stable remission. Three years after first being diagnosed with LCH the patient underwent high-dose chemotherapy-radiation therapy followed by allogeneic BMT from his human lymphocyte antigen (HLA)-identical brother. Currently, he is alive and well and has been disease-free for more than 41 months after BMT.\r"

There were five patients with Stage I, 18 with Stage II, 14 with Stage III, and 13 with Stage IV. Initial serum ferritin, transferrin, iron, hemoglobin (Hb), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and A or B symptoms were analyzed for their association with progression-free survival (PFS). There was a linear increase of mean and median ferritin levels and a decrease of mean and median transferrin levels with advancing stages. Also, there was a significant inverse correlation between ferritin and transferrin (P less than 0.001). In univariate analyses, high ferritin (greater than 142 ng/ml) (P = 0.02) and low transferrin (less than or equal to 250 mg/dl) (P = 0.008) were significantly associated with poor PFS. Serum iron, Hb, ESR, and A or B symptoms were not associated with PFS. Stepwise proportional hazards regression analysis of all factors showed that transferrin was the only factor significantly associated with PFS. These preliminary results suggest that serum transferrin can also be used as a prognostic factor in addition to serum ferritin and that it may be helpful to assay both serum ferritin and transferrin as prognostic factors in childhood HD. Further testing of large groups of patients is needed to determine whether they are independent of tumor bulk and other established prognostic factors.\r"

The patients have been followed for a minimum of 22 years after the diagnosis or until death. Nuclear DNA content was determined by flow cytometry from paraffin-embedded tissue. Patients with DNA diploid cancer (n = 57, 26%) had better survival rate corrected for intercurrent deaths than patients with nondiploid cancer (P = 0.002), and also, a small SPF (less than or equal to 14%, calculated in 134 cases) was associated with a favorable outcome in a univariate analysis (P = 0.01). The prognostic value of the DI and SPF was increased if they were combined. The most effective combination was obtained if diploid cancers were grouped together with DNA aneuploid cancers with a DI less than 2.1 and an SPF less than 14%. This combination had considerable prognostic value in a univariate analysis (P = 0.0002) and had independent prognostic value (P = 0.04) in Cox's multivariate analysis together with the primary tumor size (P less than 0.001) in axillary node negative patients but not in axillary node positive patients. In the whole series the presence of axillary nodal metastases (P less than 0.001), high mitotic count (P less than 0.001), a large primary tumor size (P = 0.001), poorly circumscribed tumor margin (P = 0.005), and slight or absent tubule formation (P = 0.05) were the only independent prognostic factors in a multivariate analysis.\r"

The main objective was to determine whether the addition of NER assay to the currently accepted practice with only CER and CPR could improve the predictive capacity of receptors. Forty-two patients were studied for response to hormone therapy and 95 patients were studied for survival; the median follow-up period was 73 months (range, 8 to 300 months). The incidence of CER+, CPR+, and NER+ was 74%, 70%, and 52%, respectively. Each receptor appeared more frequently, although not significantly so, in higher age groups. Forty percent of tumors had all three receptors positive and 14% had all negative; the remaining tumors showed all possible combinations of receptors. Both the rate of response and survival curves among 70 patients with CER+ did not show any significant difference whether NER was positive or negative. Also, among 38 patients with CER+, CPR+, and NER+, there was no significant difference in the clinical outcome as compared to 17 patients with CER+, CPR+, and NER-. Among 25 patients with CER- the rare occurrence of NER+ in only three patients did not suggest any clinical implication. It is concluded, therefore, that on overall clinical grounds the current series does not support the addition of NER assay whenever data is available on both CER and CPR.\r"

Six patients, five female patients (16.7%) and one male patient (2%), including four limited disease (9.7%) and two extensive disease patients (5%) were long-term survivors (73 to 96+ months from onset of therapy), and among them three remain alive and disease-free at 84, 84, and 96 months from first treatment, respectively. Although several factors, including sex, stage of disease (limited versus extensive), and occurrence of herpes zoster predicted overall survival duration, female sex and an occurrence of herpes zoster were the only variables which were statistically significantly related to 5-year survival. Herpes zoster was a relatively late occurrence whereas female sex was an independent positive prognostic factor.\r"

  ".U": "90315594\r", 
  ".W": "A study of 207 consecutive white patients older than 18 years of age with nonfamilial nodular and superficial spreading melanoma and 295 controls was conducted in southeast France. Controls were recruited in a public health center. They were matched for sex and age to the overall population older than 18 years of age according to the last census. Melanocytic nevi were counted over the entire body, and data on sun exposure and skin type were collected. A multiple logistic model was used to determine the variables best predicting the risk of melanoma. In order of entry into the model, these variables were number of nevi from 5 to less than 10 mm (N5/10), outdoor leisure per year, frequency of sunburn in the last years, depth of suntan, number of nevi less than 5 mm in diameter (N1/5), age, social level, and hair color. Nevi counts were shown to be indispensable to the construction of a good predictive model for nonfamilial melanoma. After adjustment, estimated relative risks for nonfamilial melanoma rose with increasing number of N1/5, N5/10, and clinically atypical nevi (CAN) on the whole body. Compared with baseline groups the presence of more than 120 N1/5 was associated with a RR of 19.6, the presence of at least five N5/10 with a RR of 10, and the presence of more than one CAN with a RR of 2.77. The number of nevi on the buttocks seemed to be a strong risk factor of melanoma and may provide a simple technique for mass screening. The association between CAN and nonfamilial melanoma could be explained largely by the association between this tumor and the number of large nevi (greater than or equal to 5 mm). It is suggested that when using number of nevi as risk markers, their size might be more important than the other features of clinical atypia. Phenotypic traits and sun exposure, on the one hand, and number of nevi, on the other, seem to be independent risk factors. On the basis of nevus count alone, high-risk subgroups can be identified, which represent only a small part of the overall population older than 18 years of age and from which a large proportion nonfamilial melanoma would theoretically derive.\r"

The classification into IA/B, and IIIA/B/C according to the M.D. Anderson system does not distribute the patients into significantly different tumor stages. Using the American Joint Committee of Cancer Staging and End Results Reposting (AJCC) system, 40 patients were classified as Stage I, 95 as Stage II, 53 as Stage III, and 32 patients as Stage IV. The 5-year survival rate was 96% in Stage I, 90% in Stage II, 68% in Stage III, and 30% in Stage IV. According to the UICC staging system there was a numerical preference of Stage II and III. The differentiation of Stage I and II was not significant. It is the authors' opinion that the AJCC staging system allows the best differentiation of melanoma patients into tumor stages that are evenly distributed and significant for prognoses.\r"

  ".W": "Ten couples, the women beginning treatment for carcinoma of the vulva, participated in a 2-year longitudinal study on sexual functioning before and after treatment. Sexual functioning was measured on admission and at 6, 12, and 24 months posttreatment. Sexual functioning was made operational in terms of current sexual behavior, sexual motivation, sexual (dis)satisfaction, and the perception of genital sensations of sexual arousal. An age-matched nonpatient control group was added to the study and the impact of physical variables was also evaluated. Within 1 year, all women who were sexually active before the treatment had resumed their sexual activities. At the 6-month assessment an increase in relational sexual dissatisfaction could be detected. Over the remaining observation period the women's satisfaction with sexual interaction with the partner was not found to be different from their pretreatment satisfaction and not different from the satisfaction in the control group, in spite of the physical damage and persisting poor perception of genital symptoms of sexual arousal during lovemaking. Satisfaction with sexual interaction with the partner under these circumstances appears to be more an expression of satisfaction with the intimate aspects of the sexual relationship than of satisfaction with the physiologic arousal aspects of the sexual relationship. It is argued that psychological and social variables are more crucial for sexual rehabilitation than physical variables. Therefore, psychosocial issues constitute the most promising focus for intervention.\r"

Serum bilirubin levels alone are poor predictors of kernicterus especially in sick preterm infants. We need a rapid noninvasive indicator of neurotoxicity and impending cell injury. Bilirubin first seems to affect neuronal conduction before energy metabolism is impaired. Unchecked, this may lead to failure of ATP synthesis, resulting in the breakdown of all active intracellular processes. It is now possible to measure energy metabolism in vivo and noninvasively by surface coil 31P NMR spectroscopy. Recent animal studies demonstrate perturbations in energy metabolism when hyperbilirubinemia is associated with an open BBB. Perhaps the further developments in NMR spectroscopy and imaging will permit regional assessment of impending or actual bilirubin neurotoxicity and allow us to identify those infants in need of immediate treatment.\r"

To investigate whether reversible interactions with plasma constituents may be a contributing factor in such differences, the binding of a number of model drugs was studied in plasma obtained from healthy Caucasian and Chinese subjects (n = 8 in each group). The unbound fractions of drugs binding to sites I and II on albumin (warfarin, diazepam, and salicylic acid) were similar in the two groups, and there was no difference in the plasma albumin concentration. By contrast, the percentages of unbound diphenhydramine (26.40% +/- 6.46% versus 18.30% +/- 4.31, mean +/- SD) and propranolol (13.81% +/- 1.33% versus 11.68% +/- 2.37) were significantly (p less than 0.05) higher in Chinese subjects compared to Caucasians. A 30% difference was also observed in the nonlinear binding of disopyramide. These basic drugs interact with both alpha 1-acid glycoprotein and albumin, and the lower binding was associated with a lower plasma concentration of the acute-phase reactant in Chinese subjects. Kinetic analysis of the disopyramide binding isotherm was also suggestive of reduced binding capacity with no change in binding affinity. The reason for the racial difference in the alpha 1-acid glycoprotein level is unknown; however, for drugs extensively bound to this glycoprotein the resulting difference in unbound fraction would be expected to have predictable pharmacokinetic consequences that may result in differences in responsiveness. Determination of plasma binding, especially of drugs interacting with alpha 1-acid glycoprotein, should therefore be an essential component of comparative studies in subjects of different races.\r"

However, attribution accuracy depended both on the surveillance method and on how reports of the adverse clinical events were obtained. Discrimination was better when patients were reporting adverse clinical events spontaneously than when the interviewer probed for recall in a systematic inquiry. Discrimination was also better when the adverse clinical events were obtained from a staff-initiated surveillance method than from a self-monitoring, patient-initiated telephone-reporting method--probably because the latter method generates an excessively strong tendency to report mainly those adverse clinical events suspected of being drug related.\r"

The force of contraction of the adductor pollicis was measured and plasma samples were collected for a 2-hour period. The concentrations of atracurium and its major end product, laudanosine, were determined by use of a chromatographic method. The pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic relationship was characterized by use of several models. No difference was observed between obese patients and nonobese patients in atracurium elimination half-life (19.8 +/- 0.7 versus 19.7 +/- 0.7 minutes), volume of distribution at steady state (8.6 +/- 0.7 versus 8.5 +/- 0.7 L), and total clearance (444 +/- 29 versus 404 +/- 25 ml/min). However, if values were expressed on a total body weight basis, there was a difference between obese and nonobese patients in the volume of distribution at steady state (0.067 versus 0.141 L/kg) and total clearance (3.5 +/- 0.2 versus 6.6 +/- 0.5 ml/min/kg). Although atracurium concentrations were consistently higher in obese patients than in nonobese patients, there was no difference in the time of recovery from neuromuscular blockade between the two groups. Consequently, the median effective concentration was higher in obese than in nonobese patients (470 +/- 46 versus 312 +/- 33 ng/ml).\r"

Only 11.3% of the dose was eliminated in the feces, consisting mostly of acetyl 5-ASA. Food coadministration reduced 5-ASA and acetyl 5-ASA systemic relative bioavailability to 44% and 76%, respectively, compared with the fasting treatment.

  ".W": "To determine the contribution of altered beta-receptor function in the vasculature to the increased peripheral vascular resistance seen in hypertension, the effects of intra-arterial infusions of isoproterenol and epinephrine on forearm blood flow were determined in 11 male normotensive subjects and 11 male hypertensive subjects during 10 and 250 mmol/day sodium diets. Increased sodium intake from 10 to 250 mmol produced contrasting effects in the hypertensive and normotensive subjects. In the hypertensive subjects, sensitivity to isoproterenol decreased when sodium intake increased (median effective dose increased from 39 [95% confidence limits, 30 to 50] to 70 [95% confidence limits, 42 to 116] ng/min, p less than 0.05). On the other hand, in the normotensive subjects increased sodium intake resulted in an increased sensitivity to isoproterenol induced vasodilation (median effective dose decreased from 52 [38 to 71] to 29 [22 to 38] ng/min, p less than 0.01). No change occurred in sensitivity to epinephrine or in the maximum vasodilatory response to ischemia during dietary changes. Changes in beta-receptors on lymphocyte membranes paralleled the changes seen in vascular sensitivity so that the proportion of receptors exhibiting high affinity for agonists, a reflection of receptor adenylate cyclase coupling, decreased in the hypertensive subjects from 38.0% +/- 3.8% when they were receiving 10 mmol/day sodium to 29.6% +/- 2.7% when they were receiving 250 mmol/day sodium (p less than 0.01). However, the proportion increased from 32.4% +/- 3.7% for normotensive subjects receiving 10 mmol/day sodium to 47.1% +/- 7.8% for normotensive subjects receiving 250 mmol/day sodium (p less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Compliance was determined by measuring venous diameter at a constant occlusion pressure. Dose-response curves for locally infused norepinephrine were established in five subjects on superficial hand and foot veins. Slopes of regression lines for norepinephrine log dose-response curves and doses required to produce equal reductions of diameter were virtually identical in both areas. In 12 subjects, 0.5 mg dihydroergotamine and placebo were administered intramuscularly in a double-blind randomized order; the venoconstrictor effect of dihydroergotamine was almost identical on hand and foot veins. Thus despite the marked differences in hydrostatic pressure to which they are exposed, superficial hand and foot veins react in a similar way to the constrictor agents investigated. The findings indicate that the responses of hand veins appear to be representative for superficial veins in other areas of the body.\r"

The goal of this investigation was to study UES behavior during induced movements in autopsy specimens and to search for dense fibrous strands between the UES and the prevertebral fascia. Histologic studies of frozen sections and paraffin sections showed a loose fatty tissue in the prevertebral space. There were no dense connective tissue strands. Autopsy specimens were used in experiments mimicking the laryngeal/UES elevation during swallowing. The results of this study indicate that the larynx and the UES move as one entity. When one is attempting to register the UES movement during swallowing, the laryngeal skeleton can therefore serve as a radiographic indicator of the UES movements.\r"

The GHB seizure was quantitated in developing and adult rats in the presence of varying doses of the GABAa agonist muscimol or intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v.) administered GABA. Both GABA and muscimol potentiated GHB-induced seizures in an age-dependent fashion. The adult dose of 1 mg/kg muscimol was extremely potent in rats less than 28 days of age and resulted in the death of all younger animals tested secondary to profound hypothermia. A dose of 0.1 mg/kg muscimol was associated with a significant prolongation of GHB seizure in rats less than 35 days of age, but had no effect on older animals. The response to GHB was also age dependent, with the greatest sensitivity occurring during the fourth and fifth week of life. The developmental sensitivity of the rat to GHB seizure correlated with enhancement of the seizure by muscimol and GABA, and both phenomena parallel the maturation of thalamocortical recruiting mechanisms thought to play a role in the pathogenesis of the bilaterally synchronous spike wave discharges that characterize generalized absence seizures.\r"

In the initial stages, the paroxysmal discharges (PDs) induced by withdrawal from unilateral GABA application may appear either unilaterally or bilaterally, although with greater amplitude on the infused side. PDs are transitorily accompanied by behavioral signs of distal myoclonus of the body territory corresponding to the infused area (contralateral hindlimb). Later, the paroxysmal activity becomes more localized, circumscribed to the cannula-infused site and with ipsilateral propagation to anterior cortical areas. The amplitude of PDs decreases progressively while their frequency increases, reaching its maximal value at about 4 h after the first PDs have appeared. In the final stages of the syndrome, which may last several days, clinical manifestations are absent and PDs are activated by slow-wave sleep and reduced during REM sleep and waking. Chronic intracortical applications of taurine failed to induce any electroclinical changes on withdrawal and were unable to inhibit the focus elicited by GABA withdrawal, whereas reinstatement of GABA infusion into the epileptogenic area was effective in blocking the paroxysmal activity. Intracortical infusion of baclofen induced the appearance of an epileptogenic focus that waned on withdrawal. The GABA-withdrawal syndrome appears to be a new model of focal status epilepticus; it may be useful as an experimental model of human partial epilepsy to investigate the role of GABAergic neurotransmission.\r"

Recurrent, isolated, and situation-related seizures were included. Febrile convulsions and neonatal seizures were excluded. The global incidence rate of diagnosed epileptic seizures was 71.3/100,000. The incidence rates per year and per 100,000 persons by type of epileptic syndrome were 1.7 for idiopathic and 13.6 for symptomatic localization-related epilepsies, 5.6 for idiopathic and 1.1 for symptomatic generalized epilepsies, 1.9 for undermined epilepsies, 29.0 for situation-related seizures, 18.3 for isolated seizures, and 0.3 for television epilepsies.

  ".W": "To study the differences between epileptic and nonepileptic head drops, 351 episodes in 24 children were analyzed by EEG-videotelemetry monitoring. Drops were classified as either epileptic or nonepileptic depending on the presence or absence of concomitant ictal EEG discharges. Ictal discharges included generalized spike-wave, polyspike-wave, bilateral sharp wave, generalized delta, and generalized beta activity. Children with epileptic drops (group I) were similar to children with nonepileptic drops (group II) with respect to age, sex, number of recorded episodes, and presence of mental retardation or other abnormalities on neurologic examination. Group I patients had a significantly higher prevalence of ictal changes in facial expression, subtle myoclonic extremity movements, generalized interictal EEG discharges, and other seizure types. Drops characterized by rapid head descent followed by slow recovery to the upright position were significantly more common in group I patients, whereas drops in which the velocity of recovery matched that of head descent (head nods) were equal in the two groups. Repetitive nods (head bobs) were observed exclusively in group II patients. These clinical and electrophysiologic features may assist in differentiating epileptic from nonepileptic head drops in children.\r"

One patient had benign myoclonic epilepsy of infancy with clinical photosensitivity. The other 5 cases had all startle-induced epileptic seizures and a form of symptomatic epilepsy. Three patients had a Lenox-Gastaut syndrome, one had generalized symptomatic epilepsy, and one had partial symptomatic epilepsy (PSE). Reflex epilepsy was also used as a classification category in the PSE case, as most or all seizures were stimulus-related in this patient. Seizures precipitated by stimuli were stereotyped in 4 patients, but 2 patients responded to stimuli with different types of seizures. The actual occurrence of reflex seizures in DS patients with epilepsy is probably underestimated. These cases seem to confirm previous reports showing deficiencies in cortical inhibition in the brain of DS patients.\r"

A questionnaire method was used, and the sample was drawn from urban and rural epilepsy support groups in several regions of Great Britain and Ireland and a hospital outpatient population. The findings indicated general low well-being among the epilepsy sample when compared with a nonepilepsy sample matched for age and sex. Factors associated with high and low well-being within the epilepsy sample were also investigated. People's perceptions of themselves and of their epilepsy were strongly related to overall well-being, and seizure frequency, ratings of certainty of diagnosis, time since diagnosis, and a diagnosis of absence seizures also seemed of some significance. From a range of background factors, only employment status showed any significant association with well-being. The research findings have implications for the management of people with epilepsy and suggest that ratings of subjective experience could be usefully incorporated into future research into the quality of life of people with epilepsy.\r"

Overall, approximately 51% of this highly selected patient population had a reduction greater than 50% in overall seizure frequency 1 month after initiation of treatment. This was reduced to approximately 25% for the last 3 months of follow-up (mean follow-up period 10.6 months). Tonic seizure frequency was reduced most dramatically, by greater than 50%, in 60% of patients at 1 month and in 35% of patients for the last 3 months of follow-up. This study suggests that prospective controlled trials of EHN, especially for tonic seizures, are needed.\r"

In nine patients, the placentas were studied with respect to insulin and insulin-like growth factor (IGF-I and IGF-II) receptor activity. In this pilot study of a group of carefully medically controlled epileptic women with low levels of AEDs, the results did not differ from normal controls. The possibility of adverse effects of higher concentrations of AEDs cannot be excluded, however.\r"

The patients and controls were carefully screened and matched for sex, age, and smoking habits. All potential probands with exposure to factors known or suspected of affecting the SCE frequencies were excluded. Statistical analyses did not show any significant differences between the SCE rates of PHT- and/or PB-treated patients and controls, indicating a lack of mutagenicity of the tested drugs as expressed by induction of SCE on adult recipients. Smoking, however, affected the SCE levels considerably. The smokers had higher SCE frequencies than the nonsmokers, both among patients and controls. Caffeine consumption was also associated with SCE increases in patients but not in controls.\r"

Results of these studies indicate the rate and extent of absorption of the 300-mg extended phenytoin (PHT) sodium capsule formulation are similar to that of 100-mg extended PHT sodium capsules based on PHT plasma maximum concentrations and time to achieve them (Cmax, tmax), and area under the curve (AUC) values and the urinary excretion of total hydroxy phenylhydantoin (HPPH) in the single-dose study and steady-state PHT plasma Cmax, tmax, minimum plasma concentrations (Cmin), and AUC values and urinary excretion of total HPPH in the multiple-dose study. Control of seizures in patients was equally maintained on a once-daily 300-mg multiple-dosing regimen administered as either one 300-mg extended PHT sodium capsule daily or three 100-mg extended PHT sodium capsules daily. Therefore, 300-mg extended PHT sodium capsules can be safely and effectively interchanged with three 100-mg extended PHT sodium capsules in patients requiring a once-daily 300-mg PHT sodium dosing regimen.\r"

The AccuLevel assay, a fluorescence polarization immunoassay (FPIA), and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) were used to determine CBZ concentration in samples from 111 female and 194 male patients aged 2-72 years (median 25 years). Mean +/- SD plasma CBZ concentrations in all patients were 7.4 +/- 3.0 micrograms/ml with the AccuLevel assay and 7.5 +/- 2.9 micrograms/ml with FPIA. In 204 patients, the mean concentration determined by the HPLC assay was 7.7 +/- 3.0 micrograms/ml, whereas concentrations determined by the AccuLevel and FPIA assays were 8.0 +/- 3.1 and 8.1 +/- 3.1 micrograms/ml, respectively. Concentrations determined by the AccuLevel and FPIA assays were significantly higher than those quantified by HPLC (p less than 0.05), but not different from each other. In addition, the AccuLevel assay was highly correlated with FPIA (r = 0.97) and HPLC (r = 0.98). Coefficients of variation for the AccuLevel assay at 8 micrograms/ml ranged from 6.8 to 7.5% for the three institutions. We conclude that the AccuLevel assay is a simple, reliable method for determining CBZ concentration in a small volume of whole blood and is an acceptable alternative for assessment of CBZ therapy and individualization of CBZ dosage in the physician's office or emergency room.\r"

Doctors in Belgium had the highest level of disease-centred attitudes, Dutch doctors the lowest. Possible explanations for these differences include differences in the doctor-patient relationship that exist between these countries. Although the results must be interpreted with some care, they should form a basis for discussions about doctor-patient relations and medical education in each country.\r"

Fifteen families, randomly selected from outpatient clinics, were evaluated using an open interview, standardized inventories and a personality test. The results showed that the investigated families had acceptable levels of communication about the epilepsy. The majority of children were informed about the parent's epileptic condition before they witnessed a seizure. An overall judgement of social functioning showed that the children had sufficient social adaptation. Analysis of the personality inventories revealed no signs of serious personality disorders in the children. Closer inquiry into the results showed that, despite the availability of information, misconceptions about the epilepsy and associated fears existed. In particular, extreme denial of somatic complaints was observed in a subgroup. Associated problems in the area of social functioning concerned a defensive attitude towards inviting friends home, increased feeling of responsibility for the parents and academic problems at school.\r"

Significant differences emerged, with mothers of hospitalized children reporting higher levels of psychological distress. There were no differences in severity of the children's illness between the two groups as indicated by blind ratings of symptomatology from six infectious diseases hospital doctors. Thus hospitalization of children for gastroenteritis was not contingent on medical symptomatology. Instead the evidence indicates that the psychological status of mothers may influence doctors' management decisions on childhood gastroenteritis. Significant positive associations between poor psychological status and poor social resources illustrate the social context in which maternal vulnerability may influence child health care generally. The impact of maternal psychological status on decisions about paediatric care is discussed.\r"

Information from patient history, pelvic examination, and laboratory tests was recorded, and a culture for C. trachomatis was performed. C. trachomatis was isolated from 30 women (8.5%) with complaints of vaginal discharge and from nine (4.0%) without complaints. The predictive value for chlamydial infection of the information obtained was examined by logistic regression. Complaints of vaginal discharge, age under 25 years, use of oral contraception, suspected exposure to sexually transmitted disease, increased amount of discharge on pelvic examination, pH of discharge above 5.0 and the presence of leucocytes on wet smear microscopy were predictive of infection with C. trachomatis. Using information from patient history alone it was possible to discriminate between patients with low and high risk for chlamydia infection, the range being from 2% to 37%. Indications for culture for C. trachomatis, based upon easily obtained information from the patient history, are suggested.\r"

The purpose of this article is to discuss a methodological tool borrowed from sociolinguistics--discourse analysis. To assess the suitability of this method for analysis of general practice consultations, the authors have performed a discourse analysis of one single consultation.

  ".W": "The aim of this study was to describe, understand and interpret physicians' experiences of consultations. Forty-six consultations were videotaped in four primary health care centres. Twelve general practitioners and 46 patients participated. Afterwards the patients and the physicians (on different occasions) commented on the recorded consultations. The comments were analysed from an inductive as well as a hypothetical-deductive model. The analyses agreed well with each other. The result demonstrated that the physicians often had difficulties understanding the patient, that they did not really know how to handle the conversation and felt that they did not really understand the context. The perceived relation to the patient was mainly related to the patients' ability to give adequate information. It is concluded that a key factor in communication is the difficulty which the physician has in understanding what the patient in fact wants-the failure to be on the same wavelength so that the message from the patient can be received.\r"

This aimed to obtain the doctors' own perceptions of their stresses. The accounts were therefore 'free-flowing'. The links between this 'open-ended' methodology and the findings are discussed. In this kind of approach stresses are uncovered--produced by the subject--which would otherwise not be revealed to the investigator. Once established, stresses which surface in this way, can be considered in a more structured setting later. Furthermore, this 'open-ended' interview produces a 'story', a collection of narrative fragments which together provide a unique record of a field of human experience.\r"

Furthermore, the treatment of the sick physician is more difficult than that of a 'regular' patient. These difficulties may cause the postponement of diagnosis and treatment to critical stages of the disease. This paper presents a study of self-rated health and health-seeking behaviour of Israeli family physicians and their families. Our major finding is that two-thirds of the physicians do not have a regular family physician, and physicians who suffer from chronic diseases are even less likely to be treated than the 'healthy' ones. Twenty eight per cent of the physicians did not use any kind of medical consultation. However, each physician's family did receive some form of medical consultation, although in some cases this was not the usual form of medical care. The physicians who treated themselves tended to treat their own families and vice versa. Eighty-eight per cent of the physicians reported stress owing to their work (work overload, poor relationships with the medical team or with the patients), and 20% said that their work as physicians negatively affected their marital life. The relationship between the help-seeking behaviour of the family physician and the quality of care they give is as yet unclear. Various alternatives are raised for changing family physicians' behaviour as well as the primary care health system in order to possibly provide better care for the physicians and their families.\r"

Twenty six patients (52%) had at least one positive provocation test: the acid perfusion test was positive related in 18 patients (36%), the edrophonium test in 16 patients (32%), the vasopressin test in five patients (10%), and the balloon distension test (performed in only 20 patients) in one (5%). The 24 hour pH and pressure recording correlated spontaneous chest pain attacks with abnormal motility or gastro-oesophageal reflux in 19 patients (38%). Fourteen of these patients also had at least one positive provocation test. Therefore, 24 hour pH and pressure recordings are only slightly better than a set of provocation tests in identifying the oesophagus as the cause of chest pain (10% diagnostic gain). In the case of oesophageal chest pain, however, 24 hour recording appeared to be the only way to identify the nature of the underlying oesophageal abnormality that caused the spontaneous pain attacks--for example, gastro-oesophageal reflux, motility disorders, or irritability of the oesophagus.\r"

Endoscopically defined healing was observed in 73% of patients after four weeks' treatment and in 91% after eight weeks' treatment. Symptoms were completely relieved in 60% of patients, improved in 34%, unchanged in 4%, and worsened in 2%. After healing patients returned to maintenance treatment with cimetidine 1.6-3.2 g daily, depending on the severity of their illness before treatment with omeprazole. By six months and 12 months only 55% and 33% of patients respectively were still in remission. This study suggests that when erosive oesophagitis is refractory to treatment with high dose cimetidine or ranitidine, treatment with omeprazole 40 mg daily for up to eight weeks is effective in inducing healing and relieving symptoms.\r"

Survival of oesophageal cancer patients from the Nottingham area in the years 1982-5 was reviewed. Surgical resection was attempted in 44 of 131 patients with squamous cell oesophageal cancer. Among the remainder 32 had endoscopic intubation alone, 27 had radical radiotherapy alone (six) or combined with endoscopic intubation (21), and 28 had other treatment combinations including surgical intubation and palliative radiotherapy. Patients treated by intubation alone had a mean age of 75 years. They were significantly older and metastases were more common (31%) in this group than in patients treated with radiotherapy (mean age 69 years), of whom 11% had metastases. Some 34% (11 of 32) of patients treated by intubation alone died within 30 days of diagnosis and were therefore not eligible for radiotherapy. Beyond 30 days, survival in the radiotherapy group (median survival 188 days; 95% confidence limits 133-253) was not significantly greater than that for the group treated by intubation alone (median survival 98 days (73-154)). The radiotherapy patients had a median hospital stay of 46 days compared with 23 days for the patients treated by intubation alone. In patients with squamous cell oesophageal cancer unsuitable for surgery, the survival advantage associated with radiotherapy and intubation is small and does not compensate for the extra morbidity and prolonged hospital stay. A controlled trial of radiotherapy in these patients is now needed.\r"

  ".W": "A two phase study was performed to identify factors that influence the healing rate of duodenal ulcer. The study included an initial clinical trial in 145 patients and a second trial in a further 61 patients. All patients were prescribed cimetidine at a daily dose of 800 mg for six weeks. The factors examined were age, sex, inpatient or outpatient treatment, duration of present ulcer pain, past history of duodenal ulcer, smoking, drinking, the length of time it took for symptoms to resolve after beginning treatment, and the characteristics of the ulcers themselves. Eighty four per cent of the duodenal ulcers healed after six weeks. Using univariate and multivariate analyses, it was found that three factors indicated a significant delaying effect on healing: (1) symptoms that persisted two weeks after treatment had begun; (2) heavy smoking (20 or more cigarettes daily); and (3) severe narrowing of the duodenal bulb. Patients with none of the three unfavourable factors (n = 90) had a healing rate of 95.6% compared with patients with one (n = 45) or two or more (n = 10) factors, whose healing rates were 75.6% and 20.0% respectively (p less than 0.001). The corresponding figures in a second study were 88.9%, 55.0%, and 0%, respectively (p less than 0.001). A prognostic score based on these three factors represents the severity of duodenal ulcers with regard to healing in patients treated with cimetidine.\r"

The basal gastrin, integrated gastrin response to a meal, and the integrated gastrin response to insulin were similar in patients whose ulcers healed after H2 receptor agonist treatment or were refractory to at least three months of this treatment. The same parameters measured before or after highly selective vagotomy were similar in patients who eventually developed recurrent ulceration compared with those who did not. As expected the basal and meal stimulated (but not insulin stimulated) serum gastrin values increased after highly selective vagotomy. Ulcer patients with particularly high gastrin values (whether basal or stimulated) were not more resistant to H2 receptor antagonist treatment or prone to develop ulcer recurrence after highly selective vagotomy. This study suggests that antral gastrin is not important in 'resistance' of duodenal ulceration either to H2 receptor antagonist treatment or to highly selective vagotomy.\r"

The results showed that gastric emptying was significantly slower in patients with severe fundal gastritis than in those without. Gastric emptying in patients with differentiated adenocarcinomas was significantly slower than in those with undifferentiated adenocarcinoma, its value being similar to that in patients with severe fundal gastritis. The Congo red test showed that the incidence of severe fundal gastritis was significantly greater in patients with differentiated adenocarcinomas than in those with undifferentiated cancers. These findings suggest that delayed gastric emptying may allow prolonged contact between dietary carcinogens and the stomach.\r"

  ".W": "Reactive oxygen metabolites are potent inflammatory mediators that may be involved in tissue injury in inflammatory bowel disease. To evaluate their role in inflammatory bowel disease, we investigated the effects of lowering the activities of reactive oxygen metabolites in experimental colitis induced by intracolonic administration of acetic acid in rats. Intracolonic administration of 5% acetic acid caused severe inflammation (mean (SEM) inflammatory score was 24.3 (0.7) of a maximum score of 32). Acetic acid at 2.5% produced moderate inflammation (score = 17 (1.4) v 4.0 (0.5) in control rats). This lower dose was used for subsequent experiments. Specific superoxide anion scavenger methoxypolyethylene glycol:superoxide dismutase, and reactive oxygen metabolites scavenger, sulfasalazine, significantly decreased the severity of inflammation (scores: 8 (4.4) and 9.8 (2.2) respectively). The xanthine oxidase inhibitors, tungsten and pterin aldehyde, failed to improve inflammation but another xanthine oxidase inhibitor, allopurinol, a compound with known superoxide anion scavenging effect, did limit the inflammation (10(2)). Inhibition of hydroxyl radical production by deferoxamine or lowering hydroxyl radical values by a scavenger, dimethyl sulfoxide, did not affect the severity of inflammation. These data suggest: (1) that reactive oxygen metabolites play an important role in experimental colitis, (2) that the xanthine oxidase pathway is not a major source of reactive oxygen metabolites in colitis, and (3) that tissue injury in experimental colitis is not caused by generation of hydroxyl radicals.\r"

Mast cell histamine release was measured in 19 patients with inflammatory bowel diseases using gut mast cells from enzymatically dispersed endoscopic forceps biopsy specimens of macroscopically inflamed and normal tissue. Mast cells and corresponding basophils were challenged with anti-IgE, anti-IgG, subclass anti-IgG4, and formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (FMLP) and results were compared with those from nine patient control subjects. The mast cell count in patients with ulcerative colitis was increased compared with that in control subjects and patients with Crohn's disease, and the mast cell count obtained from inflamed tissue was greater than that of normal tissue. The study also shows the heterogeneity of the responsiveness of the histamine releasing cells to various secretagogues. Thus, mast cells released 0.4 (0.0-2.0) (median (range)) ng histamine per sample at anti-IgE challenge, and basophils were also anti-IgE responsive. In contrast, mast cells did not respond to FMLP but the corresponding basophils did. Gut mast cells released 0.3 (0.0-1.0) (median (range)) ng histamine per sample at anti-IgG4 challenge; however, the corresponding basophils did not respond to anti-IgG4. In addition, the anti-IgG4 mediated histamine release was primarily confined to patients with inflammatory bowel disease. This study substantiates previous histopathological findings that mast cells may play a functional role in the inflammatory process of inflammatory bowel diseases and provides evidence for a possible role of subclass IgG4 as a reaginic antibody.\r"

The baseline median (25-75% range) plasma IL-2 concentration was 0.6 ng/ml (0.3-2.85 ng/ml) in patients who did not receive prednisolone, 0.5 ng/ml (0.23-3.4 ng/ml) in patients who did (not significant), and 0 ng/ml (0-0.07 ng/ml) in control subjects (p less than 0.00001).

No changes occurred in the placebo group.

Outpatient visits with clinical examination, sigmoidoscopy, and biopsy were supplemented by two-yearly colonoscopy after the disease course reached 10 years. During the 22 year period from the beginning of 1966 to the end of 1987, 401 patients entered the programme and together contributed 4048 patient-years of observation. Apart from nine patients who left the country, follow up is complete until 1986 or 1987. Colorectal carcinoma developed in 22 patients and, in a further 12, biopsy evidence of precancer, described as severe/high grade dysplasia, was confirmed in a colectomy specimen. The cumulative probability of developing carcinoma was 3% at 15 years, 5% at 20 years, and 9% at 25 years; corresponding figures for precancer or carcinoma, or both were 4%, 7%, and 13%. Five patients died of colorectal carcinoma, two while under regular observation and three after developing carcinoma four to six years after their last attendance. Among the 17 patients who developed carcinoma while under observation, the Dukes stage was A or B in 12. Patients with extensive colitis whose disability does not warrant early surgery have a clinically important cancer risk after the disease has been present for 10 years. Our results suggest that follow up in the manner described reduces the mortality from this complication. Further work is needed to define the optimum method of surveillance and show if it is cost effective.\r"

  ".W": "Because intraperitoneal administration of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) has a negative influence on the healing of colonic anastomosis, the production of eicosanoid products in the healing rat colon after resection and anastomosis was studied using high performance liquid chromatography. Normal colonic tissue metabolizes small amounts of arachidonic acid into cyclo-oxygenase and lipoxygenase products. After construction of an anastomosis, however, there is increased production of lipoxygenase products, while cyclooxygenase activity remains low. Increased amounts of PGE2 and other cyclo-oxygenase products are not produced after anastomosis of the colon and probably do not play a major role in uncomplicated healing of the large intestine in the rat. During the first eight days of repair in the anastomosed colonic tissue, a statistically significant increase in 12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12-HETE) production was found compared with control colon tissue (p = 0.001). At the same time peritoneal macrophages from these rats showed increased 12-HETE production. Eicosanoid synthesis of peritoneal macrophages resembled eicosanoid synthesis of anastomosed colon taken from the same rat indicating that 12-HETE, in particular, may be of macrophage origin.\r"

Altogether 25 (51%) of the lesions had distal margins less than 7 cm from the anus and 36 (73%) extended above the peritoneal reflection. In seven patients with tumours less than 3 cm in diameter, symptomatic improvement was achieved in all (mean follow up 16 months) and complete tumour eradication in three. In the remaining 42 patients with larger tumours (34 greater than 2/3 circumferential, mean length 5.5 cm), symptomatic improvement was achieved with repeated treatments (average 3.4) in 31 (74%) over a mean follow up of 19 weeks. Of the parameters assessed, only circumferential tumour extent proved significant in predicting functional outcome after treatment. All treatment failures (eight initial, three late) occurred in patients with extensive tumours, and only seven of these patients were considered fit for colostomy. Bowel perforation occurred in two patients (5%) but there was no treatment-related mortality. Mean stay in hospital for all laser treatments was nine days (30% were outpatient attendances). These results suggest that laser therapy may be the palliative treatment of choice in patients with rectal carcinoma unsuitable for surgery.\r"

Acute pancreatitis was diagnosed in 6% (12 of 207) of the investigations and in 8% (12 of 146) of the patients examined. The pancreatitis was mild in all patients. After cannulation of the pancreatic duct, acute pancreatitis occurred in 10 of 95 (11%) patients compared with one of 93 (1%) when the manometry catheter entered the bile duct only (p less than 0.02). Seven (58%) of the patients who developed acute pancreatitis, however, were found to be suffering from chronic pancreatitis. Some 26% of all sphincter of Oddi manometry measurements on patients with this diagnosis were complicated by an acute attack of pancreatitis compared with 3% (p less than 0.001) in patients without signs of chronic pancreatitis. In all patients the pancreatitis developed within three hours of manometry. We conclude that pancreatitis may occasionally follow sphincter of Oddi manometry measurement, even in patients without pancreaticobiliary disease, and that underlying chronic pancreatitis constitutes a definite risk. Sphincter of Oddi manometry measurement in control subjects should therefore be performed only in centres where the safety of the procedure has been established, and the presence of chronic pancreatitis should be excluded beforehand. Cannulation of the pancreatic duct should be avoided. Manometry can be safely performed, however, as an outpatient procedure.\r"

The patients had either chronic daily headache (with drug rebound -216, without rebound -42), short-duration headache (18), or cluster headache (24). Treatment consisted of withdrawal of overused medications (usually analgesics and ergots), repetitive IV administration of DHE, and use of metoclopramide and prophylactic medications, together with educational and psychological support. Overall, 91% (range, 86% to 100%) of the patients became headache-free, usually within 2 to 3 days. The average duration of hospitalization was 7.4 days. Side effects, reported in 157 (52%) of the patients, consisted primarily of nausea (32%), tightness and burning (8%), leg cramps (7%), vomiting (6%), and increased blood pressure (5%). The side effects generally resolved spontaneously or with adjustment of the DHE dose and/or adjunct medication, and necessitated withdrawal of therapy in only 2 patients (1 with drug-related claudication; 1 with somatic complaints of uncertain origin). We conclude that a regimen of repetitive intravenous DHE and metoclopramide can provide rapid relief of chronic intractable headache, and can ameliorate the effects of analgesic and ergot withdrawal in patients with chronic daily headache and rebound associated with overuse of these drugs.\r"

Ten selected patients documented their migraine attacks over a 2-month period of open treatment with ICI 169,369, 30 mg orally, for acute therapy. They compared this treatment with others they had experience of. Four of these patients undertook a pharmacokinetic study comparing drug absorption in an acute attack to that when symptom-free. Prophylaxis was then commenced with the same drug, 30 mg bd. Patients recorded symptoms in diary cards noting the effects of treatment on the usual frequency and severity of their attacks. The pharmacokinetic study showed that drug absorption could be markedly impaired during an acute attack. Nevertheless, in 35 attacks treated acutely, half the patients reported some efficacy apparent to them. One third of patients considered ICI 169,369 to be better treatment on this one occasion than their own usual medication. Some benefit was also noted during prophylaxis. There was a statistically significant reduction in attack frequency from the baseline observed during acute therapy only, but this was arguably compatible with placebo response. S2 receptor antagonism may have some beneficial effect in acute or prophylactic treatment of migraine, but it is not marked and does not support S2 receptor activation being important in its pathogenesis.\r"

Similar to HC, but unlike CPH, topical tyramine in our patient's eyes resulted in anisocoria before, but not after, indomethacin treatment. Our case differs from HC, however, in its time pattern; it could either be a pre-chronic stage of HC or a new type of headache. It seems unlikely that a time pattern that has remained unchanged for 17 years will become continuous, as in HC, in the future, and thus it is possible that our patient represents a case of a new type of headache that we propose to name \"Hemicrania Episodica.\" In any case, it seems probable that this type of headache, although clinically different, may share a common pathogenic basis with HC.\r"

Movement of the neck, especially flexion, precipitated cluster headache in 9% of patients. This was particularly true of patients with chronic cluster headache. Neck movement aggravated the headache in 16 of 100 patients and an equal number reported amelioration of pain by neck movement, especially extension.

The patient and control groups differed significantly on several self-report measures known to interfere with performance.

Statistical correction for these variables, however, did not result in significant group differences of cognitive performance.

The main types were tension headache (66%) and migraine (22%). Acute/chronic sinusitis was an uncommon cause of headache. Tension headache affected mainly individuals between 21 and 40 years of age (69%). It showed a female preponderance in Saudis aged 11-20 and above 40 years, unlike the male predilection in non-Saudis. Migraine showed a definite female predilection only in Saudis in the fourth decade (female to male ratio of 4:1). A positive family history for headache was present in 10% of the cases. The major precipitating factor for headaches was stress related to family or working conditions. Other triggers included hunger and prolonged exposure to excessive heat or sunlight. The pattern of headaches in Saudi nationals may be related to the prevalent sociocultural factors, and the differences observed between them and non-Saudis probably reflect the demographic status of non-Saudis in the Kingdom as a consequence of governmental recruitment policy.\r"

We report the prospective evaluation and therapy of six children (5-42 months) with migraine. In four of the children, Prensky's criteria were used for diagnosis, while the two youngest children presented with ophthalmoplegic migraine. All children had a strong family history of migraine and presented with headache and prominent features including facial pallor, irritability, sleep disturbance or mood changes. The oldest four children were successfully treated with either amitriptyline or imipramine in low doses. The infants with ophthalmoplegic migraine failed to completely respond to any therapy. At followup 2 to 18 months later, all children were well and without toxicity. The pediatrician should be aware that migraine may begin in infancy and can be effectively and safely treated.\r"

Although functional status outcomes improved significantly 6 months after surgery, 13% of patients continued to report important functional status disabilities, and 45% reported difficulty in or no participation in moderately vigorous activities. The variable most predictive of functional status was the patient's estimation a priori of his ability to carry out specific activities (self-efficacy). Other psychosocial and physical factors, other than postoperative treadmill performance, did not add significantly to the prediction of the outcomes. Findings suggest that rehabilitative programs attempting to facilitate physical and social reintegration of the patient after coronary artery bypass surgery should test the effects of interventions to increase self-efficacy.\r"

No significant differences were found between the group mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, and rate of premature ventricular contractions during family visits and interviews. The lowest systolic and diastolic blood pressure values were significantly lower during the visit than during the interview, suggesting that the visit had a calming effect on patients. Although the highest heart rate was significantly higher during the visit than during the interview, the difference was clinically inconsequential. The wide variance in premature ventricular contraction values suggests individual variation in responses, but no significant differences were found between visits and interviews. Although family visits were no more physiologically stressful than a comparative social interaction, select subsamples of patients with cardiac disease should be studied for more specific reaction patterns.\r"

The specific research questions were (1) Does the comatose patient demonstrate a response on an electroencephalogram (EEG) to a specific auditory stimulus? (2) Does the comatose patient demonstrate other types of responses to a specific auditory stimulus? The subjects were three male and two female young adults 15 to 29 years of age who had a closed head injury as the result of an automobile accident. A similarity in depth of coma was established by using the Glasgow Coma Scale. Cortical activity was recorded by EEG at the same time that auditory stimulation was introduced to the subject. Data obtained by observation during the period of EEG recording were also included by an additional measure of the subject's response to stimulation. The findings indicate that persons in a coma do respond to auditory stimulation. The responses were varied in this small sample, but some type of response did occur. Two patients demonstrated a response on EEG and the other responded by eye opening or extremity movement. The EEG alone does not appear to be useful as a measure of response to auditory stimulus. Further work needs to be done to determine what other methods measure the response of comatose patients to auditory stimulation.\r"

The mean age of individuals requiring reoperation was 59 years. The mean interval between the two operations reached 73 months (5 to 180 months). Angiographic lesions were more extensive with three-vessel disease in 65% of the reoperated patients. The mean ejection fraction was 55%. A mean of 2.1 bypass grafts per patient were inserted with 60% of cases having an internal mammary artery graft. Perioperative infarction occurred in 8.0% of the reoperations and an intraaortic balloon counterpulsation was necessary in 4.3% at the end of the procedure. Operative mortality was 5%. Symptomatic improvement was obtained in 85% of the cases. In recent years, cardiac transplantation has been performed for 11 previously bypassed patients with severely impaired ventricular function. There were no postoperative deaths. Cardiac transplantation can be considered as a more valuable alternative to repeat coronary artery bypass grafting in such cases.\r"

The ascending aorta was replaced in all patients and the aortic stumps were reinforced with the GRF glue before suturing a Dacron prosthesis. In 29 patients the repair extended to the aortic arch. In these cases, the distal repair was carried out under circulatory arrest and profound hypothermia (21 patients) or carotid perfusion (8 patients). The aortic valve was replaced in 20 patients (20%). Four patients died during surgery and 20 patients died during the postoperative course for an overall hospital mortality rate of 23%. Average follow-up is 51 months (range: 3 to 130 m). Three patients were lost to follow-up. Seven patients died 3 months to 10 years postoperatively. Eleven patients had to be reoperated upon for AVR (3 patients), CABG (1 patient) and recurring or evolving dissecting aneurysm (8 patients). The reoperations resulted in 2 deaths. The remaining 69 patients are in good or fair clinical condition. Postoperative angiograms, CT scans or NMR, have shown a satisfactory repair in all documented patients but a persisting dissection beyond the prosthesis in 75% of them. The GRF glue allows easier and safer repair of type A acute dissection. It has permitted the extension of the repair to the aortic arch whenever necessary.\r"

Five-hundred and sixty-four DE valves have been implanted in 508 patients between September 1983 and May 1988.

Follow-up has been 98.7% complete for a total of 1064 patient years and a mean follow-up of 26 months (range 3 to 54 months). Late mortality was 3.7%/yr and actuarial survival was 85 +/- 3% without and 78 +/- 3% including operative mortality after 54 months.

Atrial biopsies were obtained at the time of cannulation (preischemic sample) and after the removal of the aortic crossclamp (postischemic sample). Methods of myocardial protection included systemic hypothermia (28 degrees C), periodic reinfusion of crystalloid cardioplegia into the aortic root and completed vein grafts, and iced slush in the pericardial well. Atrial temperature was monitored. Preischemic ATP was 0.412 +/- 0.32 mu mol/gm, and the postischemic value was 0.220 +/- 0.13 mu mol/gm (p less than .02). Atrial temperature routinely decreased to 13-18 degrees C after cardioplegic infusion but rose to 24 degrees C between infusions. There was no correlation between postoperative supraventricular arrhythmias (4 patients) and changes in ATP. In conclusion, routine coronary artery bypass grafting with standard methods of cardiac preservation does not appear to satisfactorily preserve atrial tissue. The clinical correlation and significance of this remains to be elucidated.\r"

Patient selection criteria included vertebrobasilar insufficiency, appropriate angiographic work up, lack of contraindications, and the availability of a suitable technique. Of the 179 patients who underwent these operations, 170 presented with vertebrobasilar insufficiency that in turn was associated with hemispheric manifestations in 29 cases. Five patients had hemispheric manifestations only, and four were asymptomatic. The operation involved the proximal segment of the vertebral artery in 148 instances and its distal segment in 43 instances. Of the eight deaths recorded in this series (4.2%), one occurred in a group of 118 patients who underwent isolated vertebral artery reconstruction and seven in a group of 72 patients who underwent combined vertebral and carotid surgery. This difference was statistically significant (p less than 0.01). The overall survival rate at seven years was 88.8%, and was higher in the group undergoing isolated vertebral repair. Patency at seven years was 90.4% with better results for proximal vertebral artery repair than for distal repair (94.3% versus 77.3%). With a mean follow-up of 34.6 +/- 19 months, 118 patients are asymptomatic, and 15 are improved, for a success rate of 80.1%. Patients with hemispheric manifestations and associated carotid lesions constitute a high risk population for this type of surgery.\r"

From 1979 to 1988, 20 patients underwent resection of aortic grafts and extra-anatomic bypass for the treatment of graft infections (No. 11) and aorto-enteric fistulas (No.9). The mean time interval from primary aortic surgery to the reoperative procedure was 65 months (range 1-192 months). Three patients died (one less than 30 days) after the secondary procedure for a mortality rate of 15%. One patient developed infection of the extra-anatomic bypass graft which resulted in an above-knee amputation. This was the only major limb loss in this series. A second patient developed contralateral buttock necrosis when he had unilateral axillary-femoral bypass without femoral-femoral bypass because of a previous above-knee amputation on the affected side. Major complications occurred in 7 patients (35%). Mean duration of follow-up after the reoperative aortic procedure was 44 months (range 6-120 months). One patient suffered aortic stump blowout 7 months after repair of an aortic duodenal fistula. Aortic graft excision and extra-anatomic revascularization of the lower extremities can be performed with low mortality and risk of limb loss and should remain the treatment of choice for aorto-enteric fistulas and infected aortic prostheses. Bilateral groin revascularization is important even in patients who have had a previous lower extremity amputation to provide pelvic blood flow.\r"

  ".W": "We report a prospective study with 2 years of follow-up including 105 consecutive symptomatic patients (58.1% claudication and 41.9% severe ischemia) undergoing aortobifemoral bypass surgery (ABF/BP). Proportional-hazards, stepwise regression, and life-table analyses were used to determine predictors of the following outcome criteria: graft patency, amputation, mortality, symptomatic recurrence, and palliation. The operative mortality was 5.7% and the 2-year cumulative mortality was 15.5%. Most deaths (61.5%) were cardiac-related. There were 3 predictors of mortality: the presence of more than 1 surgical risk factor (relative risk [RR] 6.2; p less than 0.001), advanced age (RR 2.9; p = 0.03) and the presence of ischemic heart disease (RR 1.5; p = 0.045). No patient required amputation. Early graft patency rate was 94.3% and the 2-year cumulative patency was 92.8%. The only predictor of graft failure was preoperative ankle/brachial index (ABI) of less than 0.4 (RR 6.1; p = 0.003). Early symptomatic relief was 98.1% and at 2 years it was 77.3%. There were 2 predictors of symptomatic recurrence: postoperative smoking (RR 2.4; p less than 0.001) and impaired runoff (RR 2.5; p = 0.017). Cumulative palliation was 87.6% at 1 month and 66.5% at 2 years postoperatively. There were 2 predictors of palliation: the presence of more than 1 surgical risk-factor (RR 1.8; p = 0.001) and postoperative transcutaneous oximetry (PtcO2) of less than 35 mmHg (RR 3.1; p = 0.04). We conclude that the best predictors of outcome in patients undergoing ABF/BP surgery were the number of preoperative risk factors, age, ischemic heart disease, ABI, PtcO2, postoperative smoking, and angiographic runoff.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Graft surveillance may enable the \"at risk\" grafts to be recognised and corrected, but there remains the need for a simple test to identify these patients. The ankle pressure response to exercise and reactive hyperaemia has been investigated prospectively in 40 \"at risk\" femoro-distal non-reversed grafts (median age 73 years, range 51-87 years, M/F = 33:7), defined as those with a resting ankle brachial index less than 0.9 or a drop of greater than 0.2 following a stress test. Four different stress tests have been assessed; active ankle plantar-dorsiflexion for 2 minutes (I), occlusive calf cuff 50 mmHg above systolic pressure for 2 minutes (II), treadmill exercise test for 1 minute, slope = 10%, at 3 km/hr (III) and 4 km/hr (IV). Ankle brachial indices (ABI's) were recorded before and immediately following each test and expressed as mean % drop +/- standard error of mean. Test I was only tolerated by 45% of patients whereas 55% and 50% could complete tests III and IV respectively. By contrast, 85% of patients could tolerate occlusive cuff hyperaemia (test II). Test I produced a significantly lower mean percentage drop in ABI when compared with each of the others (p less than 0.02, Mann U Whitney). There was an excellent correlation between test II and both the 3 km/hr (r = 0.77, p less than 0.001) and 4 km/hr (r = 0.84, p less than 0.001) exercise tests.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Although it is technically possible to insert the standard stainless steel Greenfield filter (SGF) percutaneously using a 24 Fr. sheath, the incidence of insertion site venous thrombosis and the advantages of percutaneous technique have prompted the development of a titanium Greenfield filter (TGF) which can be inserted percutaneously through a 14 Fr. sheath or operatively. Clinical experience in 52 patients resulted in 51 placements (98%) with the majority below the renal veins (90%). One technical error resulted in caval penetration by the apex of the TGF without sequelae. One of the 19 deaths postinsertion was attributed to recurrent thromboembolism, and there was one additional event for a 4% recurrent embolism rate. At follow-up of 30 patients, averaging 5.2 months, all filters were patent and there were no proximal migrations. However, there was distal migration of 9-64 mm in 9 patients (30%) and tilting which increased from 8 patients at insertion to 12 at follow-up. Insertion site venous thrombosis occurred in 2 patients (7%) who were asymptomatic. Filter leg penetration of the vena cava was suspected in 9 patients (30%), but there were no clinical sequelae from this or the distal migrations. Since the clinical results of the TGF are comparable to the SGF, modifications of hook design should correct the tendency for wall penetration and distal migration.\r"

Diagnosis depended on angiography, isotopic renography, and selective renal vein renin determinations in certain patients. Treatment included saphenous aortorenal bypass, 9 patients; endarterectomy, 3 patients; percutaneous angioplasty, 5 patients; and nephrectomy in 3 patients. There was no operative mortality. Eighty-five percent of the patients were improved or cured of hypertension, and the average number of antihypertensive medications required decreased from 3.1 to 1.6. The mean serum creatinine of all patients decreased from 3.6 mg/dl to 2.2 mg/dl. In one subset of patients expanding suprarenal aneurysms caused renal artery stenosis or occlusion. Aortic replacement with renal artery endarterectomy or bypass is the only treatment option for these patients. High risk patients with normal renal function and a glomerular filtration rate less than 15% in the affected kidney can be treated with nephrectomy. Our results demonstrate that an individualized approach to therapy and attention to operative detail is mandatory for successful treatment of renovascular hypertension.\r"

The absence of mediastinal hematoma on CT eliminated the need for aortography in 30 (38.5%) of the 78 patients suspected of having TAR on the basis of chest roentgenograms. The presence of mediastinal hematoma necessitated aortography in 48 patients. However, operative treatment was carried out without aortography in 3 patients who had specific signs of rupture on CT. CT proved to be a reliable indicator for the selection of the patients who need aortography. As a rule, emergency operations were performed in these patients. Simple aortic crossclamping was employed in 4 patients, and heparinless left heart bypass with the BioPump was performed for spinal cord protection in 2 recent patients without complication of embolization. Use of the BioPump as an adjunct in the repair of TAR appears to be promising.\r"

Separated proteins were then transferred to nitrocellulose paper by electroblotting and detected immunologically with anti-PRL antiserum and 125I-labeled protein-A, followed by autoradiography. The proportion of total monomeric PRL present in the glycosylated form was then estimated by densitometric scanning of autoradiograms. In normal individuals glycosylated PRL was predominant, accounting for about 72% of the circulating monomeric PRL. This proportion was markedly decreased (ranging from undetectable to about 60%) in the serum of women who were pregnant or were lactating postpartum and also in patients with hyperprolactinemia caused by a pituitary tumor. The results suggest that under basal conditions the majority of PRL secreted from the pituitary is glycosylated, but with physiological or pathological hyperprolactinemia the capacity for glycosylation is exceeded.\r"

In previous studies we have shown that monocytes from patients with high turnover osteoporosis and from women in early postmenopause elaborate increased amounts of interleukin-1 (IL-1), a cytokine that stimulates bone resorption in vitro and in vivo. Since IL-1 could also mediate the resorptive mechanism of FH and cause a clinically significant bone loss, we have studied the relationship of IH, vertebral mineral density, bone turnover, and monocyte IL-1 activity in 47 patients with absorptive hypercalciuria (AH), 23 with FH, and 38 nonhypercalciuric subjects with recurrent nephrolithiasis (controls). Vertebral mineral density, as measured by quantitative computer tomography, was decreased in each of the three patient groups, but was significantly lower in FH patients than in AH patients or control subjects. Twenty-four-hour total urinary hydroxyproline excretion was increased in FH patients compared to that in AH patients or controls, but blood levels of osteocalcin were not. Monocytes from FH subjects yielded significantly more IL-1 (alpha + beta) activity than those from AH patients or controls; levels of IL-1 activity in monocytes of AH and control patients were similar. In IH subjects, significant correlations were found between IL-1 and hydroxyproline (r = 0.70; P less than 0.0001), IL-1 and quantitative computer tomography values (r = -0.49; P less than 0.005), and IL-1 and urinary calcium (r = -0.36; P less than 0.05). Serum PTH levels were within normal limits in all subjects and were similar in the three study groups, 1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3 levels, although higher in IH patients than in controls, were not significantly different in FH and AH subjects. Increased IL-1 activity and decreased vertebral mineral density are features of a subset of patients with IH. Although a cause-effect relationship remains to be established, increased monocytic IL-1 activity, rather than elevated PTH or 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 levels, could underlie the resorptive component of FH.\r"

Ten TCC were derived from thyroid tissue or peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) in patients with Graves' disease. Uncloned CD4+ cells were also obtained from PBMC in patients with autoimmune thyroid disease. All TCC were CD3+/CD4+. B-Cells from patients with mainly high serum levels of microsomal antibodies (McAb) were cultured alone and with either TCC or uncloned CD4+ cells in the presence or absence of thyroid antigens [microsomal antigen/thyroid peroxidase (McAg/TPO) and thyroglobulin (Tg)] or pokeweed mitogen (PWM). Total immunoglobulin G (IgG) and specific thyroid antibodies were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Self MHC-II-reactive TCC induced B-cell production of total IgG and even McAb independent of antigens or PWM. Specific TCC required thyroid antigens to induce antibodies. The optimal McAg/TPO or Tg concentration was 10 ng/mL for total IgG production and 1 ng/mL McAg/TPO for McAb synthesis. The addition of PWM did not affect McAb production, but enhanced total IgG synthesis by B-cells under the influence of some specific TCC. Uncloned CD4+ cells induced both total IgG and McAb synthesis in the presence of PWM. With thyroid antigens, uncloned CD4+ cells induced total IgG synthesis at levels comparable to those of specific TCC, but induced smaller quantities of McAb in the presence of McAg/TPO. Our antigen-specific TCC could, therefore, stimulate specific B-cells to produce thyroid antibodies in vitro. Self MHC-II-reactive TCC could also induce specific antibodies by B-cells. Both self MHC-II-reactive CD4+ cells and antigen-specific CD4 cells may play an important role in the pathogenesis and/or perpetuation of autoimmune thyroid disease.\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies have indicated that the pituitary gland may produce free alpha-subunit and small quantities of hCG in addition to other glycoprotein hormones. Since synthesis of holo-hCG requires the presence of both subunits, we have investigated the occurrence in human pituitary of free beta-subunit of hCG, in addition to intact holo-hCG. We processed a pituitary extract by fractionated ammonium sulfate precipitation followed by sequential chromatography on Sephadex G-100 and Ultrogel AcA 44. The fractions obtained were assessed for their reactivities with a panel of polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies specific for holo-hCG, beta-subunit of hCG, alpha-subunit, or hCG/LH. In addition to the expected LH and alpha-subunit, we detected materials which eluted from the column in positions very similar to those of cochromatographed 125I-hCG tracer and hCG-beta (NIH CR123-beta), and which showed immunoreactivity in specific immunoradiometric assays for holo-hCG and hCG-beta, respectively. Holo-hCG and hCG-beta material derived from the urine of a postmenopausal woman showed behaviors on the column similar to the pituitary forms. Both the pituitary holo-hCG- and free hCG-beta-subunit activity could be enriched (approximately 500 times) by affinity chromatography on an hCG antibody-coupled Sepharose column. When subjected to isoelectric focusing in granulated gel holo-hCG and hCG-beta-subunit of pituitary origin were focused in the pI-range of pregnancy hCG and pregnancy hCG-beta-subunit, respectively. Like pregnancy hCG, most (75%) of the pituitary hCG was bound to a column of Con A-Sepharose; however, the Con A-nonbinding hCG fraction (approximately 25%) was much higher than that found in pregnancy hCG. On the basis of immunoreactivities, the content of holo-hCG in our pituitary extract was estimated to be 60 micrograms/g, and that of free beta-subunit 45 micrograms/g; for comparison, LH was approximately 20 mg/g, and free alpha-subunit 1.6 mg/g. In addition, we could demonstrate the presence of both holo-hCG- and free hCG-beta-subunit-like immunoreactivity in NaCl-extracts from single pituitaries of two postmenopausal women. In these studies a second hCG-beta-immunoreactive material eluting far behind the hCG-beta-position was found. Chromatography of purified LH-beta-subunit, which crossreacts 1.56% in the hCG-beta IRMA, yielded an elution pattern clearly distinguishable from that of the hCG-beta-immunoreactive substances.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "90317025\r", 
  ".W": "The differential diagnosis of the various forms of inappropriate secretion of TSH (IST), i.e. generalized thyroid hormone resistance (GRTH), selective pituitary resistance [non-neoplastic IST (nnIST)], and tumoral pituitary TSH hypersecretion [neoplastic IST (nIST)], mainly rests on clinical observation, skull imaging, and measurement of several parameters assessing peripheral thyroid hormone effects. Clinically, patients with GRTH usually display compensated hypothyroidism, while those with nnIST or nIST are hyperthyroid. Since sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) measurement has been shown to be a reliable parameter in distinguishing between euthyroid and hyperthyroid states, we evaluated serum SHBG levels in 39 patients with IST (7 with GRTH, 15 with nnIST, and 17 with nIST). The results were compared to those in 68 normal subjects, 76 hyperthyroid patients, and 31 hypothyroid patients. SHBG levels in patients with either GRTH or nnIST were similar to those in controls or hypothyroid patients [GRTH, 40.5 +/- 11.8 (+/- SD) nmol/L (range, 26.4-57.5); nnIST, 29.7 +/- 12.8 nmol/L (range, 6.8-46.8); controls, 36.7 +/- 21.7 nmol/L (range, 5.4-96.5); hypothyroid, 30.8 +/- 14.4 nmol/L (range, 10.4-63.3)]. On the contrary, SHBG levels in patients with either overt hyperthyroidism or nIST were significantly higher than those in the above groups [hyperthyroid, 149 +/- 111 nmol/L (range, 48-557); nIST, 99.5 +/- 54.7 nmol/L (range, 21.6-259)]. The apparent overlap of SHBG values between hyperthyroid patients and controls almost completely disappeared when comparisons were made with control groups matched for age and sex. Additional indices of peripheral thyroid hormone action (basal metabolic rate, cardiac systolic time intervals, and Achilles' reflex time) were normal in patients with GRTH, while they were in the hyperthyroid range in patients with nnIST and nIST. After successful treatment of hyperthyroidism, SHBG levels normalized in patients with nIST, but they did not change in patients with nnIST. In conclusion, the measurement of SHBG in patients with IST is useful in differentiating the neoplastic form from that due to thyroid hormone resistance, but it fails to distinguish between generalized and pituitary resistance to thyroid hormone action. Moreover, the present data suggest that the resistance to thyroid hormone action in patients with nnIST is not selective at the thyrotroph cell level, but also involves the hepatic SHBG-synthesizing cells, thus supporting the view that the various forms of thyroid hormone resistance could represent a continuum of the same defect with variable expression in different tissues.\r"

Twenty-five patients (group 2) were submitted twice to an arginine and L-dopa test. Coefficients of variation were calculated between both the results of pharmacological (peak and area under the curve) and sleep tests [mean GH concentration (MGHC), peak, area under the curve, number of peaks above 5 micrograms/L, and peak area]. In group 1 the coefficient of variation of sleep test parameters was significantly lower than that of pharmacological tests (P less than 0.01 to less than 0.001). In the sleep test the area under the curve and MGHC were the most constant parameters. Group 2 showed no difference between the coefficients of variation of the two pharmacological tests. Considering groups 1 and 2 together, the coefficients of variation of the sleep test, in particular the MGHC and area under the curve, were lower than those of the two pharmacological tests. Eight of 24 subjects in group 1 showed a low GH level in 1 series of tests, and a normal level in the other series. Five of 18 subjects in group 2 showed an abnormally low GH response to the arginine and L-dopa tests and a normal response to the 2 repeated tests. Therefore, to prevent an erroneous interpretation of the GH test results, it is very important to perform a sleep test and repeat it whenever GH secretion seems to be deficient or at the lower limits of normalcy.\r"

More severely affected individuals also develop gynecomastia associated with enhanced estradiol secretion by the testis. However, the degree of breast development does not correlate with the rate of estrogen production, leading us to propose that feminization is a function of the degree of androgen resistance as well as the rate of estrogen formation. To test this hypothesis we measured estrogen and androgen formation in two brothers with perineoscrotal hypospadias and severe gynecomastia (the Reifenstein phenotype) due to a mutation that impairs androgen receptor function. Rates of estradiol production (60 and 70 micrograms/day) were elevated, but were not as high as in previously studied men with a similar phenotype. We conclude that the variable degree of feminization in this disorder cannot be explained by androgen resistance alone.\r"

  ".W": "The development of long term culture conditions with which to study the regulation of expression of aromatase, cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme, and 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3 beta HSD) in human granulosa-lutein cells is described in this report. Conditions have been established for the dispersal, growth, freezing, and storage of functional human granulosa cells isolated from preovulatory follicles of women undergoing laparoscopy for gamete intrafallopian tube transfer and in vitro fertilization procedures. Optimal growth conditions for human granulosa-lutein cells were determined by plating cells at a low density and testing the capacity of a variety of culture conditions to support growth. A combination of fetal bovine serum (FBS), horse serum, and the serum substitute UltroSer G was found to increase cell number to maximal levels, 8- to 10-fold higher than with sera alone. Human granulosa-lutein cells grown under these conditions had a doubling rate of 36-40 h and were morphologically distinct from human theca interna cells grown under similar conditions. Human granulosa-lutein cells treated with forskolin retracted and rounded up, whereas cultures of human ovarian theca interna cells or human fibroblasts treated similarly did not retract. Human granulosa-lutein cells were grown for successive passages and transferred to serum-free medium containing forskolin, LH, hCG, or cholera toxin. Addition of these agents resulted in a time- and dose-dependent increase in aromatase activity and progesterone secretion. In these studies FSH treatment was found not to increase aromatase activity. In a study of the time course of 3 beta HSD activity in the absence of forskolin under serum-free conditions, it was found that 3 beta HSD activity increased 3-fold during the 72-h treatment period. Forskolin-stimulated 3 beta HSD activity also increased in a time-dependent manner, with levels in treated cells 3-fold higher than those in control cells. Northern analysis performed on total RNA obtained from forskolin- or hCG-stimulated granulosa-lutein cells confirmed that the increase in aromatase activity was associated with a corresponding increase in levels of mRNA specific for aromatase cytochrome P-450. Levels of mRNA encoding cholesterol side-chain cleavage cytochrome P-450 were similarly increased in cells treated with forskolin compared with unstimulated values at each of the time points investigated. Under serum-free conditions in the absence of stimulation, the 3.4-kilobase band of aromatase cytochrome P-450 mRNA was detectable.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

To examine the possibility that thyroid hormones cause an accelerated loss of membrane proteins during in vivo aging, we determined the number of ouabain-binding sites (OBS) in young and old erythrocytes from 13 hyperthyroid and 13 euthyroid subjects. Erythrocytes were separated according to their cell age by centrifugation. In euthyroid subjects, the median number of OBS decreased from 415 (range, 341-551; mean +/- SEM, 440 +/- 19.1) in young cells to 336 (range, 287-453; mean, 340 +/- 13.6) in old cells. In hyperthyroid subjects the median number of OBS decreased from 290 (range, 190-370; mean, 280 +/- 13.3) in young cells to 207 (range, 155-244; mean, 208 +/- 7.5) in old cells. In hyperthyroid subjects the number of OBS of erythrocytes of all ages was lower than that in euthyroid subjects. The ratio of OBS between young and old cells in hyperthyroid subjects (median, 1.27; mean +/- SD, 1.34 +/- 0.16) was similar to that in euthyroid subjects (median, 1.29; mean, 1.30 +/- 0.12). We conclude that these results do not support the hypothesis that in hyperthyroidism there is accelerated loss of sodium pump sites during the lifespan of erythrocytes in circulation.\r"

  ".U": "90317040\r", 
  ".W": "In human blood, cortisol is transported by a plasma protein known as corticosteroid-binding globulin (CBG). As anticipated from primary structure comparisons of CBG and alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor (A1-PI), CBG acts as a substrate for neutrophil elastase. However, unlike A1-PI, CBG does not alter the activity of this enzyme, but is cleaved by it at a single location close to its carboxy-terminus, and this reduces its molecular size by 5 kDa with the concomitant release of more than 80% of CBG-bound cortisol. Three small molecular size fragments are detected after elastase cleavage, and carbohydrate analysis of these fragments suggests that they represent the same polypeptide fragment which has been differentially glycosylated. To assess the biological significance of these observations, CBG was incubated with either mononuclear cells or granulocytes obtained from patients with acute inflammation (sepsis) and from a normal volunteer. Only granulocytes from septic patients reduced the mol wt of CBG by about 5 kDa and destroyed its steroid-binding activity. Preincubation with A1-PI prevented this, which demonstrates that neutrophil elastase plays a key role in this event. These results suggest a physiological role for CBG in the delivery of cortisol to sites of inflammation.\r"

  ".W": "Autoantibodies blocking the TSH-dependent production of cAMP in thyroid cells (TSH-BAb) have been described in atrophic thyroiditis (AT; idiopathic myxedema) and in neonates with transient hypothyroidism, but their incidence in autoimmune thyroiditis in relation to thyroid status remains to be completely established. To this purpose TSH-BAb were evaluated in a group of 140 consecutive patients with autoimmune thyroiditis, which included 26 cases of AT and 114 subjects with goitrous Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT); among the goitrous group 27 were euthyroid (HT-E), 32 had subclinical hypothyroidism (HT-SH), and 55 had clinical hypothyroidism (HT-H). TSH-BAb were measured in immunoglobulin G prepared by DEAE-Sephadex A-50 by determining their ability to inhibit TSH-dependent cAMP production in a differentiated strain of cultured rat thyroid cells (FRTL-5). Using this sensitive and reproducible method, TSH-BAb were detected in 12 of 26 (46%) patients with AT, in 1 of 27 (3.7%) subjects with HT-E, in 3 of 32 (9.4%) with HT-SH, and in 20 of 55 (36%) with HT-H. The prevalence of TSH-BAb was higher in AT vs. HT-H (P less than 0.001), HT-SH (P less than 0.001), or HT-E (P less than 0.001), and in HT-H vs. HT-SH (P less than 0.001) or HT-E (P less than 0.001). Mean TSH-BAb levels in AT were higher than those in HT-H (P less than 0.005) and HT-SH (P less than 0.025); the difference was not significant between HT-H and HT-SH. An inverse correlation was found between TSH-BAb levels and estimated goiter weight (P less than 0.005). The results of the present study indicate that 1) in autoimmune thyroiditis TSH-BAb are detectable almost exclusively in hypothyroid patients, their prevalence being higher in overt hypothyroidism than in subclinical thyroid failure; 2) the prevalence of TSH-BAb and their mean levels are higher in hypothyroid patients with AT than in those with HT; and 3) therefore, the presence of circulating TSH-BAb appears to be related to the development of hypothyroidism and thyroid atrophy.\r"

To address the hypothesis that maternal plasma alpha hCG may reflect placental dysfunction and/or adverse perinatal outcome during insulin-dependent diabetic pregnancy, alpha hCG was measured serially throughout gestation, beginning before week 12, with a specific RIA using a monoclonal antibody in 54 insulin-dependent diabetic (randomly assigned to strict and customary glycemic control) and 25 nondiabetic pregnancies. alpha hCG was significantly lower in pregnant insulin-dependent diabetic subjects than in nondiabetics subjects until 24 weeks gestation, after which it was higher until delivery. Plasma alpha hCG stabilized in nondiabetics at 32 weeks, whereas it continued to increase in diabetics until delivery, at which time it was 37% greater than that in nondiabetics (mean +/- SE, 1441 +/- 90 vs. 1052 +/- 78 micrograms/L; P less than 0.002). Values in diabetic subjects assigned to strict control were intermediate between those in diabetic subjects assigned to customary control and nondiabetic subjects. alpha hCG was greater in diabetic subjects with pregestational hypertension or microvascular disease, but not in those with pregnancy-induced hypertension. These findings were independent of the assigned goals of glycemic control. alpha hCG was not correlated with the duration of diabetes or related to premature delivery, fetal distress, birth asphyxia, or macrosomia. Thus, alpha hCG is increased during the third trimester of the type I diabetic pregnancy and is associated with preexisting hypertension and maternal microangiopathy, but is not a predictor of adverse perinatal outcome. Excessive alpha hCG secretion in diabetes may share pathophysiological mechanisms in common with those underlying diabetic microangiopathy.\r"

  ".W": "To define the epitope(s) on human thyroid peroxidase (TPO) recognized by antibodies in the sera of patients with autoimmune thyroid disease, we constructed and screened a human TPO cDNA sublibrary containing 3.8 million random fragments of human TPO cDNA, each 200-500 basepairs in length. These fragments would code for TPO polypeptides of 66-166 amino acid residues. The validity of this approach was first tested with a murine monoclonal antibody against the denatured human thyroid microsomal antigen (TPO). Analysis of the nucleotide sequence of 14 clones selected from this library enabled molecular identification of the epitope recognized by this monoclonal antibody. In contrast to the data obtained with the monoclonal antibody, sera from patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis containing polyclonal antimicrosomal/TPO antibodies did not recognize the TPO protein fragments generated by this library. These results differ from previous data obtained with recombinant human TPO fragments generated as bacterial fusion proteins. Our data suggest that, contrary to previous concepts, the natural B-cell epitope(s) on human TPO may be highly conformational (requiring a complex 3-dimensional structure) or may be discontinuous (formed by distant regions of the linear polypeptide chain being brought into apposition by protein folding).\r"

  ".U": "90317045\r", 
  ".W": "The present studies were designed to test the hypothesis that hyperprolactinemia modulates target tissue responsiveness to angiotensin-II (AII). Adrenal and pressor responses to AII infusions were determined in six patients with PRL-secreting pituitary microadenomas and in five normal controls during defined electrolyte balance. Hyperprolactinemic and normal subjects had similar mean blood pressures while on a regular Na intake (82.5 +/- 0.5 vs. 81.2 +/- 0.3 mm Hg). However, after 4 days of Na loading (200 meq/day), the mean blood pressure in hyperprolactinemic subjects was higher than that in normal (86.6 +/- 1 vs. 83.4 +/- 0.8 mm Hg; P less than 0.05). In addition, enhancement of the mean blood pressure response to three doses of AII was noted in hyperprolactinemic subjects (P less than 0.05) compared to that in normal subjects. After 4 days of Na restriction (10 meq/day), the mean blood pressure in hyperprolactinemic subjects was similar to that in normal subjects (79.7 +/- 0.6 vs. 78.9 +/- 1 mm Hg). However, despite adequate Na restriction, the pressor response to AII continued to be enhanced (P less than 0.05) in hyperprolactinemic subjects. There were no differences in plasma or urinary electrolytes or in PRA between hyperprolactinemic and normal subjects. Hyperprolactinemic subjects had higher basal (P less than 0.01), AII-stimulated (P less than 0.05), and ACTH-stimulated (P less than 0.02) aldosterone levels during Na loading, but not during Na restriction. The differences disappeared after the correction of the hyperprolactinemia. The data demonstrate significant alterations in adrenal and pressor responsiveness in hyperprolactinemic subjects and suggest a modulating role for PRL on vascular reactivity and steroid biosynthesis. The precise mechanism has not been determined, but may be secondary to PRL-induced up-regulation of adrenal and vascular AII receptors.\r"

In the first experiment, hypothalami from premenopausal (n = 3) and postmenopausal (n = 3) women were formalin fixed, paraffin embedded, serially sectioned, and stained with cresyl violet. Soma areas of more than 3500 neurons were digitized using an image-combining computer microscope. The mean cross-sectional area of infundibular neurons in the postmenopausal women was 30% greater than that in premenopausal women, with no change in cell density. The mean cross-sectional area of mammillary neurons was unchanged, indicating that the infundibular neuronal hypertrophy was not an artifact of tissue processing. In the second experiment, hypothalami from premenopausal (n = 3) and postmenopausal (n = 2) women were frozen, serially sectioned, and incubated with a 48-base synthetic cDNA probe complementary to estrogen receptor (ER) mRNA. Adjacent sections were incubated with a cDNA probe complementary to GnRH mRNA. Morphometric analysis revealed that the mean cross-sectional area of infundibular neurons expressing the ER gene in the postmenopausal women was twice as large as the mean area in premenopausal hypothalami. The hypertrophied neurons did not contain GnRH mRNA. Finally, analysis of the infundibular nucleus from an oophorectomized 38-yr-old woman also revealed hypertrophied neurons containing ER mRNA. These data support the hypothesis that hypertrophy of infundibular neurons in postmenopausal women is secondary to loss of the inhibitory feedback of ovarian steroids.\r"

  ".U": "90317049\r", 
  ".W": "The effect of a low dose triphasic oral contraceptive (OC) was evaluated during a 6-month treatment period in 41 patients (mean age, 25.4 +/- 0.7 yr) who had grade I-IV postpubertal acne and normal menses. The OC contained three dose levels of ethynyl estradiol and dl-norgestrel. Acne lesions were assessed, and serum androgen levels were measured during a control cycle and between days 17-21 of treatment cycles 1, 2, 3, and 6. Four patients dropped out after 3 months of treatment. Acne was significantly improved after the first OC cycle. After six cycles, the number of comedones had decreased by 79.6 +/- 3.2% (range, 50-100%) in 69.4% of the patients. Mean baseline levels of testosterone, 17-hydroxyprogesterone, and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate were in the upper third of the normal range, with elevated individual values in 18.9%, 36.5%, and 26.8% of the women, respectively. Mean baseline levels of androstenedione, free testosterone (T), and 3 alpha-androstanediol glucuronide (3 alpha-diol-G) were above the normal range, with elevated individual values in 51.2%, 75.0%, and 85.4% of the patients, respectively. Sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) levels were below the normal range in 26.8% of the cases. At the end of the first OC cycle, there was a significant (P less than 0.01) decrease in all androgen precursors and a 2-fold increase in SHBG. Androstenedione and free T decreased into the normal range during OC intake. Serum 3 alpha-diol-G levels remained elevated, but had decreased by 34.5% at cycle 6 (P less than 0.05). These results show that the triphasic OC has significantly improved acne in postpubertal women for whom acne was the main manifestation of mild hyperandrogenic activity. The improvement in acne corresponded to a decrease in adrenal/ovarian androgens and free T, which led to a decreased metabolism to 3 alpha-diol-G, presumably by the sebaceous glands. The increase in SHBG is considered an estrogenic effect, and the triphasic formulation containing low dose dl-norgestrel is not androgenic but, rather, an estrogen-dominant formulation; as such, this product is recommended in women requiring contraception who also have idiopathic acne.\r"

Episodic and circadian ACTH secretion and the responses to ovine CRH and metyrapone were examined in a female with 17-OHDS under conditions of normal sodium (NSI) and low sodium (LSI) intake. Plasma ACTH and B were higher on LSI than on NSI (mean +/- SD: ACTH, 58 +/- 20 vs. 33 +/- 14 pmol/L; B, 508 +/- 107 vs. 381 +/- 69 nmol/L). ACTH pulses were concomitant with or followed by B pulses. An increase in the amplitude, but not the number, of ACTH and B pulses was found on LSI. Circadian ACTH and B rhythms persisted on LSI. Aldosterone levels were higher on LSI than on NSI. After metyrapone, plasma B decreased in the afternoon (NSI, 220 +/- 10; LSI, 275 +/- 35 nmol/L) and rose on the following morning. Plasma ACTH increased substantially on the following morning (NSI, 135 +/- 47; LSI, 307 +/- 77 pmol/L). The ACTH peak levels after ovine CRH increased after metyrapone administration. These data indicate that B may also have a negative feedback effect at the pituitary level. In all maneuvers, there were no changes in PRA, plasma sodium and potassium, or cortisol. We conclude that in 17-OHDS, in the absence of cortisol production, ACTH and B may interact to modulate the brain-pituitary-adrenocortical system.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of pH and anionic binding inhibitors were used to test the hypothesis that the increased T4 binding affinity of the variant albumin (Alb-FDH) of familial dysalbuminemic hyperthyroxinemia (FDH) is due to an electrostatic bond with the ionized phenolic hydroxyl of the iodothyronine. As determined by charcoal adsorption from 2% serum in which binding to T4-binding globulin and transthyretin had been inhibited, increased T4 binding by Alb-FDH was pH dependent and proportional to the ionization of the phenolic hydroxyl. Increased T3 binding became apparent above physiological pH, as is consistent with the higher pK of the T3 phenolic hydroxyl. The iodothyroacetic analogs of T4 and T3 developed maximal increases in binding to Alb-FDH at about the same pH as the corresponding iodothyronines. Aspirin, salicylate, warfarin, and chloride, anions that have minimal stereochemical resemblance to the iodothyronines but bind to albumin cationic groups, inhibited T4 binding to FDH sera at concentrations that had little or no effect on binding in normal sera. Increased displacement of T4 from Alb-FDH by salicylate was also evident at therapeutic ratios to a 1:1 dilution of serum in a dialysis system. Aspirin displaced T4 at a lower pH than T3, as is consistent with competition with the ionized iodothyronine phenolic group. These findings suggest that an electrostatic bond between the iodothyronine phenolate and a cationic group on the protein is the basis for the increased affinity and specificity of Alb-FDH for T4.\r"

Subsequently, this classification was further evaluated using survival data and histological variables from iliac crest biopsy specimens of an additional 1391 patients, making a total of 2241 patients available for analysis of outcome. The patients were grouped again into three main classes: \"typical\"; \"variant\"; and \"transformed\". \"Typical\" comprised the \"classic\" groups. \"Variant\" included the less uniform myeloproliferative syndromes, distinguished also by more variable clinical features, a different prognosis, and a greater tendency to fibrotic and blastic transformation. \"Transformed\" defined the end stages of both \"typical\" and \"variant\" types. Ten subgroups were distinguished by different histology and prognosis. Particular prognostic importance was assigned to atypia and immaturity of haemopoiesis, predominance of individual haemopoietic cell line, number and anomalies of megakaryocytes and progressive fibrosis. It is suggested that the proposed subclassification would be helpful for studies of epidemiology and therapeutic trials by allowing more homogeneous groups to be recognised.\r"

Clustering of cells of the same lineage in the same stage of maturation was prominent. The bone marrow stroma showed many anomalies, including increased fibre content, periodic acid Schiff positivity of fat cells, oedema, sinus ectasia and granulomas. A comparison of biopsy findings with clinical and laboratory data showed a correlation between the amount of erythroid cells and the day of appearance of reticulocytes, as well as the number of reticulocytes. Absence of clustering of haematopoietic cells in four of five patients was associated with either failure of engraftment or early leukaemic relapse. Variables such as infections and administration of possibly myelosuppressive drugs did not influence bone marrow biopsy findings.\r"

In 16 of the 24 susceptible patients the test was negative and the only preventive measure taken was the use of blood and blood products from CMV-antibody negative blood donors. None of these patients acquired primary infection with CMV. In another six patients the donor serum was found to contain CMV specific IgG, and in these patients, including one heart and lung transplant recipient, prophylaxis with CMV specific hyperimmune globulin was given. All six patients developed CMV IgM antibodies and in five there was an associated but clinically mild illness. None of these patients required treatment. In the remaining two patients ELISA tests on the donor sera gave equivocal results and hyperimmune globulin was withheld. Both patients developed primary CMV infection of greater severity than those given hyperimmune globulin and one required treatment. Reference tests confirmed that the donor sera contained CMV antibodies. Primary CMV infection in susceptible patients after heart transplantation can be avoided by the use of screened blood and blood products where the organ donor is seronegative to CMV and it can be improved by the use of prophylactic hyperimmune globulin where the donor is CMV antibody positive.\r"

In contrast to immunohistochemical staining, which did not show the presence of the antigen in histologically normal mucosa, the more sensitive enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and immunoblot assays showed that it was weakly expressed in this tissue. AM-3 reacted with variable frequency with several normal and malignant human tissues, indicating that the detected epitope is not restricted to colonic tissue. In colonic carcinomas it is present on a sialomucin of apparent relative molecular mass of more than 440,000. These data suggest that the antigen detectable with AM-3 may be useful in the assessment of premalignant changes in colonic adenomas.\r"

The number of smears containing endocervical cells increased from 44% (by spatula alone) to 79% (spatula plus cytobrush). The cytobrush alone produced a high percentage of unsatisfactory smears (17.5%) due to a low content of squamous epithelial cells.

The prevalence of the organism in the gastric antrum of 50 similar patients was estimated and compared with that in a control group comprising 120 consecutive patients with no renal failure who were being investigated for a variety of symptoms and signs related to the upper alimentary tract. Seventeen of the patients with renal disease had upper gastrointestinal symptoms. The prevalence of antral H pylori was significantly less in patients with renal disease (12, 24%) than in the control group (51, 42%), but was associated with a similar active chronic inflammatory reaction with prominent lymphoid follicles. The prevalence of the bacteria in patients with renal disease was similar to that reported in normal volunteers, and was the same whether the patients had upper gastrointestinal symptoms or not. This low prevalence may be related to the wide variety of medication, including antibiotics, which these patients are prescribed during the course of their illness.\r"

  ".W": "To ascertain modifications in the activation products derived from oxygen free radicals in patients with chronic pancreatic and extra-pancreatic diseases, lipid peroxide activity was measured in the sera of 40 control subjects, 28 patients with pancreatic cancer, 49 with chronic pancreatitis, and 53 with extra-pancreatic diseases. In 142 of the subjects, elastase 1, amylase, and pancreatic isoamylase activities were also determined. Increased lipid peroxide activities were found in some patients with both chronic pancreatic and extra-pancreatic diseases. Patients with chronic pancreatitis studied during relapse had higher activities of lipid peroxides than those without active disease. No difference was found between the values in patients with pancreatic cancer with liver metastases and those without. Correlations were found between lipid peroxides and both amylase and pancreatic isoamylase activities; no correlation was detected between lipid peroxides and elastase 1. In benign biliary tract disease a correlation was detected between lipid peroxides and alanine aminotransferase and alkaline phosphatase activities. In all patients, however, a correlation was found between alkaline phosphatase and lipid peroxide activities. It is concluded that activation of oxygen derived free radicals occurs in chronic pancreatic as well as in extra-pancreatic disease; it seems to reflect the degree of inflammation.\r"

The procedure, which depends on measurement of urinary excretion ratios after the oral administration of lactose, sucrose, palatinose, lactulose and L-rhamnose, is capable of simultaneous determination of intestinal lactase, sucrase, and isomaltase activity and lactulose:rhamnose permeability. The results corresponded well with those of disaccharidase assay and histological findings in jejunal biopsy tissue obtained from the patients. Palatinose proved a satisfactory substrate for in vivo assessment of intestinal isomaltase activity. The method described provides a reliable and comprehensive assessment of intestinal disaccharide hydrolysis, and simultaneous estimation of permeability assists discrimination of primary from secondary disaccharidase deficiency. The ability to assess three different disaccharidase activities in addition to intestinal permeability by means of a single test, and the simplicity of preservation and transport of urine samples for sugar analysis, makes this a convenient, definitive method for the investigation of defective sugar absorption in both patients and population groups.\r"

Eosinophilic viral nuclear inclusions or characteristically moulded multiple nuclei with altered chromatin, which were present in two cases of HSV encephalitis and one case of viral pneumonitis, all showed complete hybridisation visualised by an alkaline phosphatase/nitroblue tetrazolium detector system. HSV encephalitis and trigeminal ganglionitis, which were confirmed serologically or clinicopathologically but lacked nuclear changes, also gave positive dense nuclear signal in neurons, glias and satellite cells. No staining was present in the ganglion cells in trigeminal zoster, the glia in progressive multifocal leucoencephalopathy, or in a variety of cells in a lung coinfected with cytomegalovirus. In 10 herpetic blisters of squamous epithelia, infected cells hybridised strongly, while morphologically similar herpes zoster lesions remained negative. In neural tissues non-hybridisation staining was most obtrusive in corpora amylacea and seemed to reflect nonspecific probe adherence. In squamous epithelium, major non-hybridisation staining was caused by probe and antibody possibly adhering to intracellular keratin. The HSV probe permits specific detection of virus in the absence of characteristic nuclear changes and allows varicella zoster virus to be differentiated from HSV, provided that the aforementioned problems with non-hybridisation staining are borne in mind.\r"

Twenty six sera were positive with the Abbott test but negative with the Dupont test and 19 sera were positive only by the Dupont test. Only 36 (9%) of the sera were positive in both tests. The Abbott confirmatory neutralisation test gave excellent agreement with the initial Abbott HIV antigen ELISA test; the Dupont confirmatory test was only in agreement with the initial positive Dupont antigen ELISA test in one third of the sera tested. Although the overall sensitivity of each of the two commercial assays tested was similar, the Abbott method may be preferable for clinical purposes if confirmation of an initial ELISA positive test result by neutralisation assay is required.\r"

The probe was used to detect POMC mRNA both on nitrocellulose filters and by non-isotopic in situ hybridisation (NISH) in tissue sections. Digoxigenin was identified using anti-digoxigenin alkaline phosphatase. The model system examined was the rat pituitary gland. Removal of both adrenal glands and dexamethasone administration were used to change the concentrations of POMC mRNA in the rat anterior lobe. The labelled probe reacted with a single band of appropriate molecular weight in Northern blot analysis. The distribution of signal in tissue sections and the changes induced by experimental manipulation were as predicted. The results indicate that this method of NISH will prove useful in the detection of specific messenger RNAs in tissue sections of buffered, formalin fixed, paraffin wax embedded material.\r"

DNA sequences in rearranged genes were amplified using oligomeric primers predicted from conserved sequences in the variable (VH) and joining (JH) regions. On polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, polyclonal B cell proliferations showed a \"smear\", probably due to the variable lengths of the diversity (DH) region genes and the N regions separating the VH and DH and JH regions. In contrast, DNA from B cell lymphomas showed a clear single band in eight out of 10 cases. PCR undertaken on germ line DNA from non-lymphoid tumours showed no detectable bands or smears. The method can be completed within one day of biopsy, compared with several days in the case of conventional DNA blot analysis. Furthermore, it is cheaper, simpler, avoids the need for radioactive materials and requires very small amounts of DNA (about 1 micrograms).\r"

  ".W": "Among the various clinical and histologic criteria used to differentiate between benign and malignant melanocytic neoplasms, emphasis has been placed on the size of the lesion. Malignant melanomas, when diagnosed, are usually larger than 6 mm in diameter whereas most acquired melanocytic nevi tend to be smaller. We tested this size criterion with a retrospective clinicopathologic study of 30 proliferations of atypical melanocytes within the epidermis and dermis that measured less than 6 mm in diameter. Nineteen cases fulfilled all 15 established histologic criteria for the diagnosis of malignant melanoma. The remaining 11 cases fulfilled 14 of 15 criteria. Four of eight of these small malignant melanomas analyzed by multiparameter flow cytometry were aneuploid (DNA ploidy index less than or equal to 0.9 or greater than or equal to 1.1). The sex ratio, race, and anatomic sites associated with these small melanomas were similar to those described in patients with malignant melanomas larger than 6 mm in diameter. Furthermore, one melanoma metastasized to a regional lymph node and another recurred. We conclude that small malignant melanomas less than 6 mm in diameter can have histologic features, DNA abnormalities, clinical presentations, and biologic potentials similar to larger lesions.\r"

The proportion of cases with level I or II invasion was 60.8%, 58.3%, and 36.2% respectively (p = 0.002). The nonsurveillance incident melanomas were diagnosed before entry into the surveillance program, but these patients were presumably aware of the earlier occurrence of two index melanomas in their families.

Among 43 cancer sites for men and 46 for women selected primarily for analysis, a significant association with psoriasis was found only in two types of cancer. For male breast cancer the observed number was 4 and the expected number was 0.58, and for female kidney cancers the observed number was 17 and the expected number was 6.1. The statistically significant excess risk found for these two forms of cancer may be the result of multiple statistical testing rather than a phenomenon of true biologic significance. Thus psoriasis patients seem not to deviate from the general population with regard to cancer prevalence.\r"

In this study the Auspitz sign was present in only 41 of 234 patients with psoriasis. Furthermore, small bleeding points could be produced when scale was forcibly removed from several nonpsoriatic, scaling disorders, including Darier's disease and actinic keratoses. The frequent absence of the Auspitz sign in psoriasis indicates a lack of sensitivity, whereas its occurrence in other diseases indicates a lack of specificity.\r"

The frequency of amyloid deposits in solid, adenoid, and cystic histologic subtypes was slightly higher than overall, whereas in partial sclerosing and morphea-like tumors the frequency was much lower. The amyloid of basal cell carcinoma showed histochemical characteristics that were different from those of locally deposited amyloid in endocrine tumors such as medullary carcinoma thyroid and from those of \"secondary\" amyloid. No major differences in the histochemical characteristics, however, were observed between amyloid associated with basal cell carcinoma and myeloma-associated or \"primary\" amyloid. Nevertheless, immunohistochemical staining with rabbit antihuman keratin antibodies by the peroxidase antiperoxidase technique demonstrated positivity only in amyloid deposits associated with basal cell carcinoma and not in those of myeloma-associated amyloid. This evidence supports the concept that amyloid of basal cell carcinoma is produced in the stroma from degenerated epithelial cells through filamentous degeneration or apoptosis.\r"

Ketoconazole inhibited growth at concentrations ranging from 0.001 to 1 micrograms/ml. For zinc pyrithione and selenium sulfide higher concentrations were needed. In a guinea pig model the efficacy of treatment with four shampoos (Nizoral [Jansen], EDS Zinc [Schering], Zinkan [Lederle], and Selsun [Abbott]) was compared. The animals were inoculated for 7 consecutive days on intact skin. The lesions were scored for erythema, folliculitis, and hyperkeratosis 24 hours after the last inoculation and after treatment. Final evaluations were made 13 days after infection (10 days after last shampoo application). Treatment with undiluted and diluted (1:10) shampoos showed consistently superior clinical and mycologic results for Nizoral shampoo. None of the shampoos produced side effects.\r"

To test this possibility we studied the antigenic profile of Reed-Sternberg cells in the lymph nodes and of atypical cells in cutaneous lesions of lymphomatoid papulosis in two patients with Hodgkin's disease and lymphomatoid papulosis. In paraffin sections both cell types expressed CD30, CD45 T cell-restricted antigens, and occasionally CD15 antigens. They were negative for CD45 B cell-restricted antigens and for lysozyme. In cutaneous lymphomatoid papulosis lesions a similar immunologic profile of the atypical cells was found; that is, they were positive for CD30, CD2, CD3, and CD25 but negative for B cell and macrophage antigens. The similarity of the immunophenotype of Reed-Sternberg cells in lymph nodes affected by Hodgkin's disease and the immunophenotype of atypical cells of lymphomatoid papulosis lesions in the same patients suggests that the malignant cells in both conditions are derived from activated T cells and that they are closely related if not identical.\r"

Of the 423 current smokeless tobacco users, 196 had leukoplakia compared to seven of the 493 nonusers (OR = 60.0, 95% CI = 40.5-88.8). The amount of smokeless tobacco used (in hours per day that smokeless tobacco was held in the mouth), recency of smokeless tobacco use (hours since last use), type (snuff versus chewing tobacco), and brand of snuff used were significantly associated with risk for leukoplakic lesions among smokeless tobacco users. Ninety-eight leukoplakic areas in 92 subjects were biopsied and examined microscopically. All lesions were benign, but one specimen had mild epithelial dysplasia. The long-term significance of leukoplakia in smokeless tobacco users and their relation to oral cancer is not clear.\r"

  ".W": "Recurrent sinusitis (RS) is a very common clinical problem for which no underlying cause can generally be ascertained. We examined nasal mucosal responses in 14 patients with RS to determine if a relative deficiency in secretion of glandular antimicrobial factors might play a role. Twenty-four subjects with no history of sinusitis were studied concurrently as normal control (NC) subjects. RS was defined by two or more episodes of acute sinusitis per year for 2 or more years. After provocation with 25 mg of methacholine or 1 mg of histamine, nasal washings were analyzed for total proteins: the plasma protein albumin, IgG, and nonsecretory IgA (nsIgA), and the glandular proteins secretory IgA (sIgA), lactoferrin (LFN), and lysozyme (LZM). Although baseline secretions in patients with RS were relatively enriched with LFN and LZM as compared to that of secretions in NC subjects, patients with RS had a blunted cholinergic response with decreased secretion of albumin, IgG, nsIgA, sIgA, and LZM. Histamine responses were equivalent in both patients with RS and NC subjects. After 4 to 12 months of medical treatment, the abnormal cholinergic responses improved on repeat methacholine challenge in all eight subjects with RS rechallenged. Thus, patients with RS have a reversible reduction in nasal mucosal secretory responses to cholinergic stimulation. Since glandular secretions are rich in antimicrobial factors, such as LFN, LZM, and sIgA, it appears possible that the inability to secrete glandular proteins normally may predispose to recurrent infections.\r"

Hair from these \"big cats\" was collected, extracted, and used in a RAST system and histamine-release test. By means of a RAST-inhibition assay with affinity-purified Fel d I from cat dander, it was established that, in the Felidae species, a Fel d I equivalent is present that reacts with IgE and IgG4 antibodies. We found that all patients had cross-reacting IgE antibodies to seven of the Felidae tested; no IgE antibodies reactive with the caracal were found. Eight of 10 patients with IgG4 antibodies directed to cat dander also had IgG4 antibodies directed to several Felidae species, including the caracal. However, the correlation between the IgE and the IgG4 antibody specificity was low, indicating that, in the case of Fel d I IgE and IgG4, antibodies do not necessarily have the same specificity.\r"

  ".W": "To determine if atopic subjects without asthma naturally exposed to antigens to which they are sensitized demonstrate evidence of lower airway inflammation, we studied 10 subjects with recurrent seasonal allergic rhinitis to pollens. Each subject had a monthly methacholine challenge and two bronchoalveolar lavages (BAL), one during symptoms of allergic rhinitis and one out of season. The percentage of macrophages, lymphocytes, neutrophils, eosinophils, and mast cells in the lavage fluid were determined on Diff-Quik, nonspecific esterase, or toluidine blue-stained cytocentrifuge preparations. The total number of cells recovered on BAL was 23.2 +/- 3.5 X 10(6) (mean +/- SEM) (13.3 +/- 2.3 X 10(4) cells per milliliter) in season, during symptoms of allergic rhinitis, and 33.8 +/- 7.4 X 10(6) (15.2 +/- 3.1 X 10(4) cells per milliliter) out of season (p greater than 0.05). BAL cell-differential counts (percent) in/out season were similar for macrophages (89.0/84.6), lymphocytes (9.1/12.8), neutrophils (1.3/2.1), eosinophils (0.5/0.5), epithelial cells (0.37/0.46), and mast cells (0.0008/0.0013). Blood eosinophil counts, taken, respectively, in and out of season, were 135.5 +/- 26.8 X 10(6)/L and 102.8 +/- 20.6 X 10(6)/L (p greater than 0.05). Although overall airway responsiveness increased slightly during the pollen season, it did not reach statistical significance (geometric mean of provocative concentration causing a 20% fall in FEV1 [milligrams per milliliter], 98.8 during antigenic exposure compared to 121.4 out of season) (p greater than 0.05. These observations suggest that in subjects without asthma, no changes in cell differential are detected on BAL at the time of maximal symptoms of allergic rhinitis.\r"

  ".W": "Sustained and significant reversal of antibody deficiencies is uncommon, although it has been noted in some cases during childhood and after viral infections. We report a case of reversal of IgG2 deficiency after splenectomy. A 46-year-old man who suffered recurrent sinusitis despite antibiotic therapy was noted to have IgG2 deficiency and cutaneous anergy. Replacement therapy with intravenous immunoglobulin ameliorated his symptoms. After 13 months of therapy, the patient had a diagnostic laparotomy and splenectomy because of portal hypertension, hypersplenism, and consideration of underlying malignancy. No evidence of malignancy or infection, including human immunodeficiency virus, active cytomegalovirus, or Epstein-Barr virus infection, was found. After splenectomy, the patient's serum IgG2 level normalized without replacement therapy. Subsequently, it fell, then normalized once more, and remains normal. The patient also demonstrated positive reactions to delayed hypersensitivity testing after splenectomy, but, subsequently, became anergic and remains anergic at the present time. Since the splenectomy he has remained clinically well without antibiotics or immunoglobulin replacement. In vitro analysis of his lymphocyte function demonstrated impaired T cell proliferation as well as an intrinsic B cell differentiation defect. This case demonstrates the potentially dynamic nature of IgG subclass deficiencies.\r"

  ".W": "To quantitate trace amounts of peanut allergens in food-processing materials and finished foods, we established a solid-phase radioimmunoassay inhibition using pooled sera from five peanut-sensitive subjects and a roasted peanut-meal extract covalently linked to polyacrylamide beads. Test samples were extracted, dialyzed, lyophilized, and reconstituted at 10 to 225 mg of dry weight per milliliter concentrations. The peanut-allergen content of test samples was expressed relative to a reference extract of roasted peanut meal that was assigned an arbitrary potency of 100,000 U/ml. In confectionery products spiked with varying quantities of peanut (0.7% to 0.0175%), the recovery of peanut allergen ranged from 31% to 94%. The sensitivity of the assay was 2.5 U/mg of dry weight from these samples (0.00875% peanut). Peanut allergens were undetectable in virgin vegetable oil used to roast peanuts, but 600 to 7600 U/mg of dry weight were present in oil after varying periods of use. The allergen content of used oil was reduced to 8 U/mg of dry weight by filtration and steam cleaning. The availability of such assays provides a means of monitoring finished food products for potential allergens. This monitoring in turn will provide the means to correlate symptoms experienced by sensitive patients with the exact quantity of allergen ingested. At the present time, there is little information on the quantities of ingested peanut allergen that pose risks to peanut-sensitive subjects.\r"

  ".W": "The toxic effects of the human eosinophil granule major basic protein (MBP), reduced and alkylated, were studied on human nasal mucosa in vitro. With a microscope coupled with a television monitor (magnification x 2500) and videotape recorder, we investigated the effects of MBP on the mucosa and the ciliary activity of single cells. In nasal mucosal specimens from normal individuals, MBP, 5 mumol/L and 10 mumol/L, significantly inhibited (p less than 0.01) ciliary activity by 4 and 1 hours of exposure, respectively. At these same MBP concentrations, the mucosal surface profiles were altered by 4 hours of exposure, and ciliostasis was 75% to 100% complete by 9 and 6 hours, respectively. In a mucosal specimen from a patient with nasal allergy, 1 mumol/L of MBP significantly inhibited (p less than 0.01) ciliary activity by 1 hour; alteration of the mucosal surface profile appeared by 3 hours of exposure, and ciliostasis was 75% to 100% by 13 hours. Similar alterations of the mucosal surface profile were observed with specimens from a second patient with allergies; in contrast, 1 mumol/L of MPB had no effect on specimens from a nonallergic patient. These results indicate that MBP damages human upper respiratory epithelium, causing ciliostasis and alteration of the epithelial surface at concentrations likely achieved in vivo. Furthermore, the mucosal specimens from two allergic patients were damaged by concentrations of MBP that had no effect on mucosal specimens from a normal individual.\r"

  ".U": "90317223\r", 
  ".W": "Certain species of histamine-releasing factor (HRF) have been demonstrated to distinguish a select group of allergic patients from healthy subjects. An IgE-dependent mechanism of action has been suggested. The donor and IgE dependency of HRF produced by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) has not been clearly demonstrated. In this study, we have compared the response of basophils from normal subjects versus allergic patients with and without asthma. In addition, we have addressed the IgE dependency of HRF recovered from cultures of PBMCs, T cells, B cells, macrophages, and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. We have demonstrated that basophils from allergic as well as normal subjects respond to PBMC-HRF. The response of basophils from allergic patients with asthma is significantly increased. This heightened response to HRF does not correlate with the severity of disease as assessed by baseline spirometry, medication, and skin test scores. Stripping of the membrane-bound IgE by incubating basophils with lactic acid causes a significant loss of sensitivity to HRF generated by PBMCs, T cells, B cells, and macrophages, as well as to HRF recovered from bronchoalveolar fluid. The loss of response can be restored by sera from patients with asthma but not from normal subjects or by myeloma IgE. In addition, poorly responsive basophils from normal subjects can be rendered sensitive by incubating with sera from patients with asthma. The capacity of a given serum from a patient with asthma to restore the response to HRF is not correlated with the total concentration of IgE in the serum.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The frequent association of asthma and paranasal sinusitis has been ascribed to a nasobronchial reflex, aspiration of sinus secretions, or enhanced beta-adrenergic blockade. We investigated possible pulmonary aspiration in a pilot study (eight patients) and follow-up study (13 patients) by means of a radionuclide technique. In the pilot study, the aim was to demonstrate aspiration as well as visibility of the radionuclide in the thorax during a period of 24 hours. The radionuclide was initially placed bronchoscopically in the bronchial tree in four patients and was still clearly visible in the same position after 24 hours in three patients. Aspiration from the nasopharynx was unequivocally demonstrated in two of four patients with depressed consciousness. The follow-up study population consisted of four patients with maxillary sinusitis only and nine patients with sinusitis and asthma. The radionuclide was placed in a maxillary sinus during therapeutic puncture. In the patients with only sinusitis as well as patients with asthma and sinusitis the radionuclide could be demonstrated in the maxillary sinus, nasopharynx, esophagus, and lower gastrointestinal tract during a 24-hour period. However, no pulmonary aspiration of radionuclide could be demonstrated in any patient. We conclude that seeding of the lower airways by mucopurulent secretions is unlikely to account for coexistent pulmonary disease. The association is probably related to generalized mucosal disease affecting both upper and lower airways.\r"

  ".W": "Sera collected sequentially during a 24-month interval from 11 individuals with shrimp hypersensitivity and 10 nonhypersensitive control subjects were evaluated for shrimp-specific IgE, IgG, IgM, and IgA reactivity. Shrimp-hypersensitive subjects underwent double-blind, placebo-controlled shrimp challenges; seven exhibited positive challenges, and four subjects reported the subjective symptom of oropharyngeal pruritus. Shrimp-specific IgE levels in all subjects were relatively constant during the 24 months of this study and not affected by shrimp challenge, although some fluctuation in the shrimp-specific IgG, IgM, and IgA reactivity were noted, apparently unrelated to shrimp challenge. Shrimp-specific IgE and IgG, but not IgM and IgA, were significantly higher in the group with shrimp hypersensitivity as compared to the control subjects. Moreover, the challenge-positive subjects had higher levels of both shrimp-specific IgE and IgG than subjects reporting pruritus. The levels of shrimp-specific IgG correlated directly with shrimp-specific IgE reactivity. These studies indicate that serum levels of shrimp-specific IgE are significantly elevated in shrimp-hypersensitive subjects who exhibit positive food challenges, and these baseline levels did not appear to be altered long term by isolated shrimp challenge. Furthermore, baseline shrimp-specific antibody (IgG, IgM, and IgA) levels noted in normal subjects were not markedly affected by frequent ingestion of shrimp.\r"

The challenges were negative in 29 workers and positive in 26 workers. Isocyanate antibodies were estimated by ELISA index. The mean IgG indices were found to be significantly higher in the challenge-positive workers, and there was a similar trend for the IgE indices. Antibody specificities for toluene diisocyanate-HSA, diphenylmethane diisocyanate-HSA, and hexamethylene diisocyanate-HSA were determined by inhibition studies with a variety of isocyanate haptenized carriers. The other isocyanate substituted carriers were either noninhibitory or caused only partial inhibition as contrasted with the complete inhibition achieved by HSA conjugated to the isocyanate to which the worker was exposed. We interpret these specificity studies as indicating that the inhalation of isocyanates results in production of antibody that recognizes new antigenic determinants that develop from the coupling of isocyanates to homologous proteins.\r"

We considered subjects with neither positive skin test reactivity nor eosinophilia to be the reference group. Positive skin test reactivity without eosinophilia (N = 487; 17.3%) was significantly associated with persistent wheeze (odds ratio value (OR) = 1.6; 95% confidence interval of the odds ratio value (CI) = 1.0 to 2.6) and with asthmatic attacks (OR = 3.2; CI = 2.0 to 5.3).

Finally, eosinophilia without positive skin test reactivity (N = 170; 6.1%) was significantly associated with chronic cough (OR = 1.8; CI = 1.2 to 2.7), bronchitis episodes (OR = 2.1; CI = 1.4 to 3.2), dyspnea grade greater than or equal to III (OR = 1.7; CI = 1.0 to 2.8), and asthmatic attacks (OR = 3.0; CI = 1.5 to 6.6).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Medical records on the 301 admissions to this hospital over a 13-month period were reviewed. One hundred patients (33%) had a pressure sore present on admission. Using ordinary therapies, 79% of these pressure sores improved and 40% completely healed during the 6-week follow-up period. Remaining bed- or chair-bound was the sole patient characteristic associated with a failure of the pressure sore to improve. Mortality rates were significantly increased in patients with a pressure sore present on admission (relative risk [RR] = 1.9), in patients who developed a new sore (RR = 3.1), and in patients in whom the pressure sore failed to improve (RR = 3.3). However, the pressure sores did not appear to be the direct cause of this increased mortality. These data suggest that the majority of pressure sores encountered at a long-term care hospital can be successfully managed in this setting. Although patients with pressure sores have an increased mortality rate, this is most likely due to coexisting medical conditions.\r"

Information was obtained regarding demographics, medical and psychiatric diagnosis, medications, indications for ECT, number and laterality of treatments, outcome, and complications. Thirty-nine patients 80+ years of age (mean age, 85 +/- 3.2) were compared with 42 patients 65 to 80 years of age (mean age, 74 +/- 5.2). Statistical analysis was performed using confidence intervals of the difference in proportions of patients in each group. There were no significant differences in the demographics, number and laterality of ECT treatments, indications for ECT treatment, medical diagnosis, medications, or prior history of falls, but psychiatric diagnoses differed slightly. Patients over 80 years had significantly more cardiovascular complications and falls (95% confidence interval) and tended to have a worse ASA (American Society of Anesthesiologists) scale rating and a somewhat less successful outcome. This study confirms the role of ECT as a relatively safe and effective treatment, which may be lifesaving in selected depressed older patients. Prospective studies are needed to understand better the long-term outcome and to prevent the morbidity and mortality associated with ECT in this frail, high-risk older group.\r"

They had been assessed with the MMSE at the outset and were re-evaluated with the MMSE and a Health Services Questionnaire 1 year later. Subjects were more likely to be hospitalized in the subsequent year if they were older than 75 years or if they scored poorly on the MMSE. Severe cognitive impairment increased the risk more than mild impairment. Multivariate analyses that controlled for demographic variables demonstrate that MMSE performance is a significant predictor of any subsequent hospitalization (medical or psychiatric) among whites and among those at both high and low educational levels. This effect was not explained solely by the increased rate of psychiatric hospitalizations. We also determined that a decline in MMSE score over 1 year was associated with an increased risk of hospitalization, more hospital days, longer average length of stay, and a prolonged (greater than 20 days) hospital stay. We conclude that both initial poor performance on the MMSE and deterioration increase the risk of hospital use and lead to more extended hospital stays. However, even with poor MMSE performance, most older persons remain out of the hospital and most of those hospitalized do not have prolonged stays; thus, MMSE score alone is insufficient as a predictor of impending hospitalization. Further studies are needed to add other measures of risk for hospitalization and prolonged hospital stays.\r"

  ".W": "We examined needle use and disposal, needlestick injuries and their management, and employee education regarding the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and needle use by means of a questionnaire sent to all long-term care facilities certified for skilled care in Minnesota. Responses were received from 297 of 349 (85.1%) homes. Nearly all homes (271 of 293; 92.5%) provided education for new nursing employees about use and disposal of needles. Disposal of needles and sharps was generally consistent with current recommendations for short-term care hospitals. Needlestick injuries were usually related to recapping and were most common in registered and licensed practical nurses but were infrequent (i.e., less than 1 injury per home per employee-year) probably because parenteral therapy is infrequently used in long-term care settings. Only slightly over half (166 of 286; 58%) of the homes had protocols for management of needlestick injuries. Although Minnesota nursing homes properly dispose of needles and sharps, many of these institutions need to develop policies for management of needlestick injuries that are consistent with current recommendations.\r"

Aeromonas hydrophila, a facultative, anaerobic gram-negative rod, has not been implicated previously in an acute diarrheal outbreak in this setting. We report 17 patients with this disorder all characterized by the acute onset of painless, nonbloody diarrhea. Thirteen of 17 (76%) patients had two to four loose bowel movements and a duration of illness of less than 48 hours. Eleven of 17 (65%) patients were afebrile. Stool cultures were obtained in 11 patients; 4 (36%) were positive for A. hydrophila. The disease was fatal in one patient who experienced profuse diarrhea and developed fever, tachycardia, and hypotension. The original source of the A. hydrophila was not identified but transmission is known to be water- or food-borne. Although usually mild and self-limited, A. hydrophila infection as noted in one patient can be fulminant and severe. A. hydrophila diarrhea responds to antibiotic therapy; it is important to consider in the differential diagnosis of acute diarrheal illness among older persons in an institutional setting.\r"

More recently, objective tests such as tympanometry and sonotubometry have been shown to be useful in confirming the diagnosis. This paper describes how computed tomographic imaging may also be useful in aiding the diagnosis. Supporting this, clinical cases of patulous tubes are demonstrated radiologically associated with congenital hemifacial microsomia and following radiotherapy for a nasopharyngeal carcinoma. The role of computed tomographic imaging in the diagnosis, research and monitoring of treatment for his condition is discussed.\r"

  ".W": "Facial nerve specimens obtained during reinnervation surgery from 31 patients with facial palsy of varying aetiology were studied. In patients who had a facial palsy after attenuation during acoustic schwannoma removal the facial nerve had normal populations of myelinated nerve fibres in the sensory zone but their numbers and sizes were severely reduced and fibrosis was increased in the motor zone. The latter also had large numbers of endoneurial tubes with thin unmyelinated axons. When the facial nerve had been severed in tumour removal, it had practically no remaining nerve fibres. In three out of four patients with middle ear cholesteatoma, the distal facial nerve stump showed severe fibrosis. In patients with iatrogenic trauma and skull fracture, the distal stump usually showed few myelinated nerve fibres, endoneurial tubes with thin unmyelinated fibres and increased fibrosis. The pathological changes observed indicate that in all cases the motor fibres distal to the lesion have undergone Wallerian degeneration and demyelination and in most a subsequent partial regeneration. However, the regeneration remained incomplete. The distal stump of the facial nerve with numerous endoneurial tubes in most cases of the material presented appear to provide favourable structural preconditions for reinnervation surgery.\r"

Three case reports are used to illustrate the presentation and diagnosis and treatment of Lyme disease. The characteristics of the disease are reviewed and the limitations of serological testing outlined. The literature has concentrated on bilateral or relapsing facial palsy. A review of palsies in Zurich that presented to the ENT clinic found only unilateral and partial palsies. The diagnosis should be considered in every case of facial palsy of unknown aetiology especially in children.\r"

Surgical approach was intra-oral in 100 cases and extra-oral in four. Immediate soft tissue reconstructions were carried out in 20 per cent cases. Post-operative complications included minor sepsis (8.6 per cent), major sepsis (2.9 per cent), haemorrhage (2.9 per cent) and fistula (3.8 per cent). Major complications occurred only in patients treated exclusively by external irradiation at doses equal to or higher than 65 Gy. Relief from pain and trismus was obtained and normal swallowing was established following radical surgery.\r"

Cautery usually sufficed in both anterior and posterior sources. No source was hidden behind a septal spur or deflection. Hypertension was associated with bleeding from the middle meatus, but not with the severity of bleeding. Patients on antihypertensive medication were more likely to be admitted. Point sources of bleeding were from prominent vessels or haemorrhagic nodules; the latter are not well recognized and are easily overlooked. Routine blood tests did not reveal unsuspected abnormalities or change management; neither did sinus X-rays. Initial examination of the nose in the acute phase by experienced personnel is suggested, to reduce admissions and avoid nasal packing.\r"
