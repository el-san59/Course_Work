Previously reported findings from series of IBM patients have suggested that clinical and pathologic features are present which readily distinguish it from idiopathic polymyositis. We report 4 cases of IBM presenting clinically and pathologically as polymyositis, each of which was refractory to therapy. Our data suggest that IBM may be a more common and heterogeneous form of inflammatory myopathy than has been previously suggested. Furthermore, IBM may be clinically and electrophysiologically indistinguishable from polymyositis. Reasons for failing to recognize IBM by pathologic studies appear to include: the skip lesion nature of the pathologic findings, failure to examine tissues by electron microscopy, and a low level of suspicion or lack of recognition. Because of its insidious clinical course and its failure to respond to immunosuppressive therapy, IBM may be an important variant of treatment-resistant polymyositis.\r"

  ".W": "Recent studies have demonstrated that retinoids (synthetic vitamin A analogs) can modulate connective tissue metabolism in human skin fibroblast cultures. In this study, we examined the effects of 3 retinoids, all-trans-retinoic acid (RA), 13-cis-RA, and an aromatic retinoid, RO-10-9359, on collagen gene expression in scleroderma fibroblast cultures and matched control fibroblast cultures. The results indicated that all-trans-RA and 13-cis-RA significantly reduced procollagen production both in control and scleroderma fibroblast cultures in a dose-dependent manner. The reduction in procollagen production was paralleled by a similar decrease in steady-state levels of type I and type III procollagen messenger RNAs, which suggests that there is coordinate inhibition on the transcriptional level. In contrast, RO-10-9359 elicited only limited effects on collagen production, and such effects were variable. The results suggest that further development of retinoids might provide an effective means to counteract tissue deposition of collagen in scleroderma and other fibrotic diseases.\r"

  ".W": "We have previously presented evidence that an intra-erythrocyte arylesterase is primarily responsible for the deacetylation of aspirin to salicylate. We now report studies on extracellular control factors. The fractional acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) hydrolysis at the completion of 20-minute incubations in suspensions of washed red blood cells (RBC) with human serum albumin (HSA) decreased sharply, from 0.6 at 0 gm/dl HSA to 0.2 at 5.0 gm/dl HSA. In RBC suspensions with oleic, linoleic, and lauric acid, ASA hydrolysis increased as fatty acid:HSA ratios increased. The addition of salicylate (SA) also resulted in an increase in the fraction hydrolyzed. In a separate, more direct, ultracentrifugation assay, unbound ASA levels were similarly affected by HSA and the other ligands. When SA and oleic acid were incubated with ASA in RBC, additive competition for binding sites was apparent at relatively low levels of the fatty acid. In the presence of increasing concentrations of sodium SA, 5-amino SA, and 4-amino SA, ASA hydrolysis in RBC suspensions was increased by an average of 137%, 75%, and 54%, respectively. The most reasonable explanation for these findings is that the intact ASA molecule binds to albumin and that the binding of competing ligands can modulate the levels of free ASA in the circulation. This, in turn, affects the amount of drug available as substrate for penetration into the RBC and reaction with the intracellular hydrolase which catalyzes ASA deacetylation. Such factors controlling drug availability, if validated in vivo, could be important with regard to the antiinflammatory and anti-platelet properties of aspirin.\r"

Under polarized microscopy, the amyloid appeared as an amorphous material with strong Congo red uptake and typical apple-green birefringence. These findings indicate that analysis of synovial fluid sediments with Congo red may represent a simple, yet sensitive, test for the diagnosis of amyloid arthropathy.\r"

Of the 34 patients who received drug immunosuppression with PX, 1 patient developed severe shunt-site infection, and an additional 4 developed bacteremia. Seven patients were given PX alone, and none of these developed clinically significant infection; however, this difference in infection rate did not reach statistical significance. Clinically significant access-related infection remains an infrequent but potentially important hazard of therapeutic PX.\r"

We report an unusual case of TC, which presented as an adhesive capsulitis, in an elderly North American black woman.

We studied the effect of these agents in 30 bottle-fed babies, 6-8 weeks old, with clinical gastroesophageal reflux pathology. Continuous 24-hour esophageal pH monitoring revealed gastroesophageal reflux pathology for all parameters studied: reflux index (18.4%), duration of the longest reflux episode (23.3 min), number of reflux episodes in 24 h (34.5), number of reflux episodes greater than 5 min (6.8). All investigations were performed in prone-anti-Trendelenburg position. The infants were treated with milk thickening agents (1 g to 115 ml, as recommended by Carre). Most (n = 25) showed clinical improvement of their symptoms. A second pH monitoring was performed under treatment conditions after 7-14 days, and showed in 24 infants a decrease of the number of reflux episodes (15.1 in 24 h) (p less than 0.001), but a comparable reflux index (17.8%) (NS) and number of long lasting (greater than 5 min) reflux episodes (7.8) (NS). The duration of the longest reflux episode, however, increased significantly (56.6 min) (p less than 0.001). In six infants all parameters were within normal ranges at follow-up. Milk thickening agents seem clinically effective as a treatment for gastroesophageal reflux in individual cases, but can lead to occult gastroesophageal reflux episodes of long duration, possibly increasing the risk for esophagitis or respiratory dysfunction.\r"

  ".W": "Heterogeneity in the expression of tumor-associated antigens, as defined by the binding of monoclonal antibodies, is a characteristic common to most, if not all, human carcinoma cell populations. Antigen-negative cells within the population can escape detection and therapy by their failure to bind the appropriate antibody. Therefore, the extent of antigenic heterogeneity is an important consideration when designing protocols for the management of cancer by administration of monoclonal antibodies. One approach to counteracting the effect of antigenic heterogeneity is the use of clone A of recombinant human leukocyte interferon (Hu-IFN-alpha A). Administration of Hu-IFN-alpha A in vivo effectively increased the amount of tumor antigen expressed by a human colon xenograft in situ and augmented the localization of a radiolabeled monoclonal antibody to the tumor site. Concomitant administration of Hu-IFN-alpha A and monoclonal antibody may thus be effective in overcoming the antigenic heterogeneity of carcinoma cell populations and in enhancing the efficacy of monoclonal antibodies in the detection and treatment of carcinoma lesions.\r"

Ventricular fibrillation was induced electrically, and after 3 minutes of no intervention, one of the three types of mechanical CPR was performed for 17 minutes. SCV CPR and vest CPR produced significantly greater aortic and right atrial systolic pressures than Thumper CPR (P less than .03). The SCV CPR technique also produced significantly higher aortic diastolic pressure and right atrial diastolic pressure than either of the other methods (P less than .03). However, coronary perfusion pressure was not different among the three mechanical methods. No differences in immediate resuscitation, 24-hour survival, or neurologic deficit scores at 24 hours were found.

The patient was treated with sympathomimetic drugs both by injection and by inhalation with complete resolution of the swelling and his symptoms within 30 minutes. The uvula is a potential cause of upper airway obstruction and should be examined in persons presenting with airway-related complaints.\r"

  ".W": "In this series of seven patients, we used the temporalis muscle flap for reconstruction of tongue and floor-of-mouth defects. For intraoral reconstruction, the temporalis muscle flap has advantages over the standard workhorse flap, the pectoralis major. The temporalis muscle flap is far less bulky, more pliable, non-hair bearing, and in closer proximity to the oral cavity. Use of this muscle does not impair mandibular function. The depression that results after the temporalis muscle has been transferred is minimal. Most of this donor area is covered by hair. The only site where the depression can be significant is at the zygomatic arch, where the tunnel into the mouth is formed after removal of the arch. If the arch is wired back into position, this aesthetic detriment is obviated. In gaining exposure of the zygomatic arch, significant traction can be placed on the soft tissues through which the temporal branch of the facial nerve runs. In one patient, a temporal nerve branch paralysis occurred that required a browpexy; in another patient, there was a transient paresis; and in the others, there was no deficit. The temporalis muscle flap is hardy and durable, and has become our mainstay flap for intraoral reconstruction.\r"

Sixty patients were stratified by site (oral cavity, 19; larynx, 14; hypopharynx, 14; oropharynx, 11; nasopharynx, one; and paranasal sinuses, one) and by stage (III, 19; IV, 41), and then randomized to receive either standard treatment (defined as preoperative irradiation followed by radical excision or irradiation alone) or adjuvant chemotherapy followed by standard treatment. An additional three patients were entered into the study, but withdrew. Chemotherapy consisted of three cycles for those patients in whom an objective tumor response was observed; nonresponders received standard treatment. Response to chemotherapy was complete in five and partial (greater than 50%) in 18 patients, for an overall response rate of 85%. The follow-up for surviving patients was a minimum of 24 months and a maximum of 44 months. Survival was compared for patients in both treatment groups according to the method of Lee and Desu. Despite excellent tumor response, actuarial survival was 70% in the standard treatment group as opposed to 56% in the experimental group. It was therefore evident that the high response rates reported in previous pilot studies do not necessarily result in improved survival in these cancers.\r"

Bony manipulation in the region of the nasal spine may have resulted in the interruption of the neurovascular supply to the right central incisor, yielding a devitalized tooth. An aberrant vascular supply, or root apex situated high in the premaxilla, can predispose to dental injury while performing bony manipulation near the nasal spine.

When multivariate analysis was applied to clinical and electrocardiographic data together, however, the 12 lead electrocardiogram did not provide independent information additional to that provided by other routine clinical findings and laboratory tests such as a history of previous myocardial infarction, clinical signs of persistent heart failure, indication for digitalis or antiarrhythmic drugs at discharge, and enlarged heart on chest x ray. In conclusion, the electrocardiogram has important prognostic value; however, it is not powerful enough to further improve the risk assessment of post-infarction patients.\r"

  ".W": "An attempt was made to stratify risk of subsequent cardiac events in post-infarct patients according to a combination of the results of clinical assessment, routine diagnostic investigations, and pre-discharge exercise testing in 350 consecutive patients who were followed up for one year. Patients were classified prospectively on the basis of the extent of myocardial damage as assessed by peak enzyme release, reciprocal change on the electrocardiogram at the time of myocardial infarction, Norris prognostic index, ability to perform a pre-discharge exercise test (and test result), and ability to tolerate beta adrenergic blockade on discharge. Of the 50 patients with contraindications to pre-discharge exercise testing, 26% died or had reinfarctions compared with 9% of the 300 exercised patients; the 24 non-exercised patients with evidence of extensive myocardial damage or reciprocal changes on the electrocardiogram were particularly at risk. Similarly, among the 300 exercised patients, extensive myocardial damage, reciprocal change on the electrocardiogram, and ST depression on exercise testing were the major risk markers in that each identified at least 75% of the patients who had subsequent cardiac events. The 63 exercised patients who had all three of these major risk markers constituted a high risk group: 18 (29%) died or had reinfarction. Of the remaining 237 patients, only 9 (4%) had cardiac events. The 35 high risk patients with exercise induced angina pectoris or clinical contraindications to beta blockade were particularly at risk; 15 (43%) died or had reinfarction. This approach to risk stratification identified a small cohort of high risk patients in a large population of myocardial infarction survivors; it also identified a large group with a very low risk of subsequent cardiac events.\r"

Both tests significantly increased heart rate and blood pressure. The reproducibility of serial evaluation of ejection fraction response to cold pressor and isometric handgrip stresses was satisfactory but the sensitivity for detecting coronary artery disease was not. Both stress tests are valuable interventions for the serial evaluation of left ventricular function by radionuclide ventriculography, but they should not be used to detect coronary artery disease.\r"

Ninety two of the 130 showed coronary stenosis resulting in a loss of more than 75% of coronary artery cross sectional area and/or acute coronary events with no other cause of death. Of these 92 subjects considered to have died suddenly of ischaemic heart disease, 64% showed plaque rupture and thrombosis which occurred at sites of previous high grades of stenosis. Twenty two subjects had intraluminal thrombosis unrelated to plaque fissuring. Thirty eight (41%) showed histological evidence of recent myocardial necrosis; acute coronary events occurred in 34 of these. There was no correlation between the duration of symptoms before death and the occurrence of acute coronary events. Acute coronary events, mainly in the form of plaque rupture, are a common finding in sudden coronary death when a careful study is made of the whole coronary arterial tree.\r"

The mitral valve area, derived from transmitral pressure half time by the formula 220/pressure half time, was compared with that estimated by cross sectional echocardiography. The transmitral pressure half time correlated well with the mitral valve area estimated by cross sectional echocardiography. The correlation between pressure half time and the cross sectional echocardiographic mitral valve area was also good for patients with pure mitral stenosis and for those with associated mitral or aortic regurgitation. The regression coefficients in the three groups of patients were significantly different. Nevertheless, a transmitral pressure half time of 175 ms correctly identified 20 of 21 patients with cross sectional echocardiographic mitral valve areas less than 1.5 cm2. There were no false positives. The Doppler formula significantly underestimated the mitral valve area determined by cross sectional echocardiography by 28(9)% in 19 patients with an echocardiographic area greater than 2 cm2 and by 14.8 (8)% in 25 patients with area of less than 2 cm2. In thirteen patients with pure mitral valve stenosis Gorlin's formula was used to calculate the mitral valve area. This was overestimated by cross sectional echocardiography by 0.16 (0.19) cm2 and underestimated by Doppler by 0.13 (0.12) cm2. Continuous wave Doppler underestimated the echocardiographic mitral valve area in patients with mild mitral stenosis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Total 10 year mortality and valve related morbidity were low and no cases of mechanical valve failure were recorded. There were no significant actuarial differences in mortality or valve related morbidity between the 2400 and 1260 valves. Starr-Edwards models 2400 and 1260 aortic valve prostheses showed excellent durability without any mechanical failures over a 10 year period. The long term outcome of isolated aortic valve replacement with these models is associated with a low frequency of valve related complications.\r"

  ".W": "The feasibility of using balloon dilatation to relieve stenosis caused by dysplasia of the pulmonary valve was assessed in seven patients (five female, mean age two years) with angiographically confirmed dysplasia who were identified among 38 patients with pulmonary valve stenosis selected for balloon dilatation over a two year period. The clinical features in three patients were consistent with Noonan's syndrome. In all patients the gradient across the valve was assessed by cross sectional echocardiography and Doppler echocardiography before cardiac catheterisation. Balloon dilatation was performed by conventional techniques. In one patient, who had balloon dilatation in the operating room before surgical valvectomy, the diameter of the valve orifice increased from 3 mm to 10 mm. Inspection showed a tear along the anterior commissure. The mean (SD) pressure gradients between the right ventricle and pulmonary artery before and immediately after dilatation in five patients were not significantly different (58 (28) and 47 (12) mm Hg) respectively. There was no overall significant change in the degree of stenosis when four of these patients were examined by Doppler echocardiography six months after operation (44 (17) mm Hg), although one patient (case 5) did show a significant reduction in gradient. This patient had angiographic and echocardiographic features of dysplasia and commissural fusion. Several echographic features were common to all patients and distinguished them from cases of typical pulmonary valve stenosis. These were: pronounced thickening of leaflets; leaflet immobility in diastole and systole; no dilatation of the sinuses of Valsalva in diastole, and supra-annular narrowing.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

There was a statistically significant inverse relation between pulmonary arterial pressures and platelet counts. Six out of the eight patients (4-16 months old) with raised mean pulmonary arterial pressure had thrombocytopenia (less than 100,000/mm3) and none of the 25 patients with a normal mean pulmonary pressure (less than or equal to 20 mm Hg) showed thrombocytopenia. Pulmonary arterial pressures were not measured in four patients: the platelet count was 7000/mm3 in the patient with a left ventricular systolic pressure of 90 mm Hg but it was greater than 100,000/mm3 in the three in whom left ventricular systolic pressure was less than 50 mm Hg. Platelet counts were positively correlated with capillary oxygen tension and inversely correlated with haematocrit in all 37 patients. Despite the persistence of pulmonary hypertension, thrombocytopenia improved after corrective surgery in five patients, even in those who had thrombocytopenia before operation. These data suggest that the presence of thrombocytopenia is not solely related to the development of pulmonary vascular disease. Pulmonary vascular disease, however, does contribute to the early development of thrombocytopenia in patients with simple aortopulmonary transposition.\r"

Plasma clearance (483 ml min-1), apparent volume of distribution (1.94 litre kg-1) and terminal half-life (3.1 h) were in agreement with other reports. Thus, there was no obvious evidence that the surgical procedure or the concomitant use of other drugs, or both, influenced the pharmacokinetics of midazolam.

  ".W": "Functional residual capacity (FRC) and breath-by-breath compliance of the ventilatory system (Crs) were measured in 10 mechanically ventilated patients during anaesthesia for lung surgery (pneumonectomy, lobectomy, lung or pleural resections or exploratory thoracotomy). In eight patients not requiring pneumonectomy, FRC of the lower lung decreased by 8 +/- 9% (mean +/- 1 SD) (P less than 0.05) while that of the upper lung increased by 75 +/- 24% (P less than 0.001) when the patient was turned to the lateral position. When the pleura was opened, FRC of the lower lung decreased by a further 10 +/- 10% (P less than 0.01). One-lung ventilation (OLV), however, increased FRC of the lower lung back to the value found in the supine position before surgery. When two-lung ventilation was re-established, FRC of the lower lung was about the same as during corresponding stages before OLV. In the two patients who underwent pneumonectomy, FRC of the remaining lung was about 30% greater after OLV than at corresponding stages before surgery. In the patients not requiring pneumonectomy, Crs decreased from 29 +/- 6 ml/cm H2O to 23 +/- 6 ml/cm H2O (P less than 0.05) on the lower side when the patient was turned on his side. The corresponding figures on the upper side were 24 +/- 8 ml/cm H2O and 30 +/- 5 ml/cm H2O respectively (P less than 0.05). There was no further significant change when the pleura was opened. After surgery when the patient was turned to the supine position, Crs of the lung not operated on was almost the same as before surgery.\r"

Propranolol 0.5 mg kg-1 altered the time to peak increase in plasma concentration of potassium after suxamethonium, but did not increase peak concentrations. In controls, the maximum change (0.83 mmol litre-1) occurred at 3 min, while in propranolol-treated dogs the peak change (0.96 mmol litre-1 occurred at 30 min. Similar results were obtained when metoprolol 0.25 mg kg-1 and ICI 118551 0.1 mg kg-1 were used, respectively, as selective beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptor blockers. The increases in potassium concentration following suxamethonium in the metoprolol group (0.98 mmol litre-1) and the ICI 118551 group (0.82 mmol litre-1) reached maximum concentrations at 30 min compared with the controls (0.79 mmol litre-1) which achieved a maximum at 3 min. Phenylephrine was infused at 8 micrograms kg-1 min-1 to produce alpha stimulation. The infusion alone altered plasma concentrations of potassium, but the haemodynamic changes were such that conclusions as to the effect of alpha-stimulation on release of potassium after suxamethonium could not be reached.\r"

The following compounds were added to the incubation solution: propionic acid, alanine and cysteine (0.1 mol litre-1 final concentration). Metocurine was also incubated with cysteine under identical conditions. Aliquots of the incubation solutions were injected i.v. to anaesthetized rats at the start (0 min) and at the end of incubation (45 min), and the indirectly elicited, single twitches of the gastrocnemius muscle were observed. Whereas inactivation of atracurium proceeded slowly in the control solution and in the presence of sodium propionate, the presence of alanine and, especially, of cysteine markedly enhanced the inactivation. Incubation of metocurine with cysteine did not alter the pharmacological responses. The concentration of cysteine decreased progressively during its incubation with atracurium (37 degrees C, pH 7.4). We conclude that the data are compatible with the postulate that a nucleophile may enhance the degradation of atracurium by a reaction with the parent compound (nucleophilic substitution reaction), by reaction with acrylates (Michael addition) or both.\r"

The contamination was caused because the vacuum and compressed air systems were located in the same machine room. This could conceivably provide a route for respiratory tract contamination in patients receiving ventilatory assistance with air-oxygen mixtures.\r"

The response was analysed at 24 and 48 h after application using light microscopy, transmission electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray microanalysis (EDX). It was found that the sodium lauryl sulphate induced a hyperplastic response in the epidermis with an increased number of keratinocytes. This response was associated with significantly increased levels of intracellular sodium and chloride. The elemental changes were most marked at 24 h, whereas the number of keratinocytes was highest at 48 h. The pattern of the elemental changes and the ultrastructural alterations are compatible with initial membrane damage followed by a transient increase in proliferative activity. The present results demonstrate that EDX is a useful tool for the analysis of functional alterations in epidermal keratinocytes under pathological conditions.\r"

Regular washing with soap and water had no appreciable effect on the dimensions of the living epidermis of either group but caused a reduction in the number of cell layers and the amount of sudanophilic material in the stratum corneum of both.

In 18 of the 24 patients, local provocation of FDE was seen at sites or previous eruption but never on clinically normal skin. With some drugs, e.g. phenazone salicylate, positive provocation of FDE was seen with all the vehicles used; with sulphamethoxazole and trimethoprim, a positive result was seen only in DMSO. To study cross-reactions to other phenazone derivatives in patients with an FDE caused by phenazone salicylate, we applied topical phenazone, aminophenazone and propyphenazone to sites of previous FDE lesions in three patients. In all three, a positive reaction was seen with phenazone, but only one patient showed positive results with aminophenazone and propyphenazone. The present study suggests that topical provocation is useful with several drugs causing FDE. Testing should always be performed on sites of previous FDE, and the sensitivity of the open topical testing can be increased in certain cases by using a vehicle which increases penetration of the drug.\r"

It was found that the planned educational intervention was incompletely carried out and was given more effectively to primigravidae in whom subsequent reduction of smoking was more evident. The effects of educative intervention on size at birth were therefore analysed for first and later pregnancies separately. The differences in birthweight and length between the intervention and control groups were concentrated almost entirely among the first born infants who were 68 g heavier and 0.75 cm longer in the intervention group than the first born infants in the control group.\r"

Blood flow characteristics were normal both in the fetus and in the maternal arcuate artery, compared with those in uncomplicated pregnancies of corresponding gestational ages. Volume blood flow remained unchanged in the fetal descending aorta, and in the umbilical vein during atenolol treatment, whereas the pulsatility index increased in the fetal descending aorta and in the arcuate artery. This suggests that the peripheral vascular resistance, both on the maternal and fetal side of the placenta, increased during short-term antihypertensive treatment with atenolol.\r"

In eight patients the fetus was judged to be acidotic and they were delivered immediately by caesarean section. In two patients the fetus was not considered to be acidotic and the pregnancy was allowed to go on. In those babies that were delivered the pH blood collected from the umbilical vein at the time of delivery was compared to the antenatal sample. There were no significant differences. The technique of antenatal umbilical vein blood sampling is readily learned and by assessment of fetal acid base status a more precise diagnosis can be made leading to appropriately planned management.\r"

Numbers of ectopic pregnancies, births, and induced and spontaneous abortions were obtained by 5-year age-groups and county of residence from the hospital discharge register. Introduction of a more sensitive pregnancy test in 1979 was coincident with the most rapid increase in the role of ectopic pregnancies. Use of incomplete denominators and varying catchment areas and correction of changing age-distribution of pregnant women did not markedly influence the time trends. Our analysis suggests that the observed increase in ectopic pregnancies in this area was partly real and partly due to better diagnosis.\r"

Increased risks of placental abruption were associated with pre-eclampsia, diabetes, and unmarried status. Neither parity nor maternal age was associated with an increased risk. Infants born after abruption were significantly smaller-for-gestation than control infants, more likely to be male, and had malformations more frequently than control infants. Apgar scores of liveborn abruption infants were significantly lower than those of controls after adjustment for infant weight, gestational age, and sex.\r"

Mean pain scores on the day after delivery were significantly reduced from 4.5 to 3.6 and analgesic requirements were also diminished by local infiltration with saline before the episiotomy repair. It is postulated that the oedema of inflammation can be accommodated under less pressure if 'slack' is created by prior distension of the tissues.\r"

Each patient had an excretory urogram, CO2 cystoscopy, uroflowmetry, water cystometry and a urethral pressure profile, using a dual sensor microtransducer catheter, at rest and during stress. Postoperatively there was a significant reduction in urethral length and urethral closure pressure; however, pressure transmission ratios were maintained, indicating no loss of bladder neck support with stress. Of the six patients with pre-operative bladder neck weakness, two (33%) had stress urinary incontinence at the 3 months assessment. No patient with a normal pre-operative assessment developed this complication. Fifteen (71%) voided by abdominal straining and this manoeuvre emptied the bladder effectively. These data suggest that patients with pre-operative evidence of an incompetent bladder neck may be predisposed to develop stress urinary incontinence after radical hysterectomy because of a reduction in the urethral closure pressure.\r"

The urinary albumin to creatinine concentration ratio was greater at all stages of pregnancy than in the non-pregnant controls and greater at 36 weeks than at 14 weeks gestation. Correcting for the observed changes in serum albumin and creatinine clearance produced evidence consistent with the hypothesis that mean glomerular permeability to albumin rises progressively during pregnancy. Reasons are given why the measurement of urinary albumin excretion may be a useful screening test in some pregnant women, and may also yield useful information on the effect of multiple pregnancies on renal function. One grand multipara was studied and found to have an increased excretion of albumin at each stage of pregnancy.\r"

The rate on Sunday was close to average. The largest number of perinatal deaths per day occurred on Wednesdays and the smallest on Sundays. Significant variations in mortality rates and percentage low birthweight were found among the 19% of infants who were born electively, but not among those born after a spontaneous onset of labour. High-risk pregnancies, including many with intra-uterine fetal death, were induced in large numbers from Tuesdays through Saturdays with a peak on Wednesdays. Low risk cases were induced mainly from Monday through Fridays with a peak on Fridays. The pattern of perinatal mortality through the week followed closely that of the risk status of pregnancies delivered electively. The results indicate that the pattern of perinatal mortality by day of the week of birth was determined by a highly organized weekly routine of selective elective delivery.\r"

Nulliparity, hydramnios, post-term pregnancy, oxytocin augmentation of labour, abnormalities of fetal heart rate and/or meconium-stained amniotic fluid, prolonged second stage of labour, emergency caesarean section, assisted vaginal delivery, low Apgar score and resuscitation at delivery and subsequent ventilatory support were all statistically significantly more common among cases than among controls. Five of the 54 babies who developed seizures died within 28 days of birth and 11 of the 49 survivors had an impairment diagnosed by 3 years of age which was usually associated with some degree of cerebral palsy. Comparison of the frequency of antecedent perinatal risk factors in the seizure babies who died, those who survived with disabilities and normal survivors failed to reveal any clear pattern.\r"

The caesarean section rate in this community increased from 7% in 1974 to 16% in 1982. Caesarean sections performed for failure to progress in labour, previous caesarean section and preterm fetal compromise before labour accounted for three quarters of the increase. Breech presentation was not a significant contributor to the increase.

Primary surgical treatment was by local excision in 14 patients, simple vulvectomy in seven patients and radical resection in 11 patients. Overall 5-year survival was 25% and only one patient was alive at 10 years. Comparison between the groups showed no benefit either in local control, disease-free interval or patient survival according to extent of primary resection. We suggest that, as in anorectal melanoma, radical resection of the primary lesion is unlikely to alter the extremely grave prognosis and its routine use should be abandoned.\r"

A 20-year-old girl has not yet recovered menstruation 5 months off chemotherapy. All the remaining women whose mean age at start of chemotherapy was 21 (9-38) are now menstruating with a median time of recovery of 41/2 months after completion of chemotherapy. Five women have so far conceived after chemotherapy resulting in three full term normal deliveries of healthy infants, one termination of pregnancy, two miscarriages and one continuing pregnancy. Gonadal function does not appear to be permanently impaired in the majority of patients receiving POMB/ACE chemotherapy for ovarian germ cell tumours.\r"

Of 40 eyes treated 36 (90%) required a single lasing session for patency (19, one application; 17, two applications), and four eyes (10%) required two sessions. Closure of the iridotomy site following Nd-YAG lasing due to pigment epithelium proliferation occurred in 10% of eyes, an incidence remarkably lower than that of argon laser iridotomy. Transitory closure or diminution of a prior patent iridotomy during the first hour after lasing was observed in 6.7% of eyes. Patency was again noted up to three weeks later and remained unchanged. Immediate postoperative complications included a marked increase in ocular pressure (42% of eyes), minimal transitory bleeding, and transitory localised corneal oedema at the lasing site. Persistent iridocorneal adhesion at the lasing site was noted in three eyes, and localised lenticular opacities, of non-progressive type, were observed in one eye.\r"

When high doses of antigen were used for challenge, a mild response was observed in unchallenged contralateral eyes. The cellular response at low doses of tuberculin consisted predominantly of mononuclear cells. At higher doses the cellular infiltrate was more pronounced, and polymorphonuclear cells tended to predominate 24 hours after challenge, while at 48 hours mononuclear cells predominated.\r"

Ninety-five cases were discovered, four of these were born elsewhere and were not subject to our protocol, which at present consists of intramuscular penicillin and topical tetracycline ointment (1%). The 91 cases represent an incidence of 3.1 cases per 1000 live births (9.1/year), an incidence approximately equal to that reported in other published studies. The clinical characteristics examined were: age, sex, race, birth weight, gestational age, Apgar scores, presence or absence of fever or other systemic illnesses, complications, type of delivery, time of year, incubation period, presence and type of discharge, uni- or bilaterality, Gram stain, Giemsa stain, culture results, antibiotic disc sensitivities, cervical culture, antibiotic therapy, sequelae, and type of prophylaxis received. Seven aetiological diagnostic categories were established: gonococcal (3%), chlamydial (3%), staphylococcal (30%), other pathogens (25%), chemical conjunctivitis (7%), culture negative/normal flora (22%), and unobtainable (10%). This distribution differs from others published. In contrast with other studies, moreover, we found few gonococcal and no chlamydial cases in neonates subject to the Mount Sinai Hospital treatment protocol. Correlation of clinical characteristics and aetiological categories showed no statistically significant trend. So far there have been no cases of ophthalmia neonatorum, treated as on our protocol, caused by penicillin resistant gonococci or chlamydiae.\r"

At the time of gonioscopy the lenses had been in situ for a median of 20 months, with a range of 3-38 months. In 75.9% of cases one or both haptics were positioned posterior to the scleral spur with some degree of iris push. Iris tuck was seen in 29.2% of cases. Three different types of fibrous tissue formations were seen in the angles. The first two types (sleeving and iris haptic adhesions) occurred in the majority of cases and were haptic related. The third type was in the form of true peripheral anterior synechiae and occurred in 17.5% of cases. In cases with haptic related adhesions only, the angle remained open. Secondary glaucoma developed in 12 cases (8.7%). Ten cases had open angles. In the remaining two cases peripheral anterior synechiae were present in more than two-thirds of the angle, which was considered to be closed. Total burial of one of the haptics occurred in 25.5% of cases. A prominent iris vessel was observed near one of the haptics in nine cases. The thin looped haptics appear to stimulate fibrous tissue formation in the majority of cases. The haptic related adhesions add to the stability of the implant. It would make dislocation of the lens unlikely, even under severe trauma to the eye. However, once formed it would make removing the implant virtually impossible without severing the haptics. With time and with burial, the haptics seem to move away from the direction of the cornea. Total insulation of the haptic from the peripheral cornea is achieved with the occurrence of total burial.\r"

Tumour related death within three years after therapy is caused by pre-existing metastases. Survival rates for less than four years after therapy are therefore irrelevant in evaluating the efficacy of therapeutic regimens. Considerably higher postirradiation than postenucleation death rates after a mean 10-year follow-up period have been reported, and this difference can be explained by a reported mean clinical tumour regression rate of 31% two years after irradiation and histopathological studies which revealed that 42 out of 43 irradiated melanomas contained viable tumour, while only 50% showed necrosis. The doubtful value of preserving vision does not justify the high risk of avoidable death from metastases in irradiated patients.\r"

Six of 23 (26%) had uveitis, 18/23 (78%) decreased lacrimal secretion, and 13/16 (81%) epithelioid cell granulomas in conjunctival biopsies. Ten patients with other diseases served as controls. Only five patients had ocular complaints and two had enlarged parotid glands. 67Ga uptake over the orbits and parotids was measured by a quantitative computer based method. Gallium uptake was significantly higher over the orbits (p less than 0.001) and parotids (p less than 0.01) in the newly detected patients and in the parotids (p less than 0.01) in the chronic group than the corresponding uptake in the controls. We suggest that in sarcoidosis an increased 67Ga uptake in the orbital and parotid areas may be a phenomenon comparable to an increased 67Ga uptake in the lungs in active alveolitis. Gallium scan is a good method for revealing even symptomless ophthalmic sarcoid changes. However, in chronic sarcoidosis an equal or only slightly increased gallium uptake over the orbits compared with background activity does not exclude ocular sarcoid disease.\r"

During a population based study of ocular disease conducted in southern Malawi we tested a simplified version of the current WHO grading scheme. Intraobserver agreement statistics were less than satisfactory for three of four graders. Interobserver agreement when compared against either a well experienced standard ophthalmologist or a consensus grade improved over time for two of the three graders. However, initial agreement for all three graders was only fair to moderate. Previous studies of trachoma grading schemes support these unsatisfactory results. A new system of classification is needed that is both accurate and reliable in a field setting.\r"

Norepinephrine (NE), serotonin (5HT), or phalloidin treatment of the endothelial cells (ECs) reduces, whereas histamine or cytochalasin B increases, the number of PMNs migrating across the ECs and amnionic membrane. In contrast, amine treatment of PMNs or acellular amnionic membrane does not alter PMN diapedesis or chemotaxis. The NE and histamine effects are blocked by appropriate receptor antagonists, but the 5HT effect is not. All the agents' effects are also reversible. Qualitatively similar effects on EC permeability to Evan's blue-labeled albumin occur with all agents; however, PMN adhesion to ECs is not affected. Previously, we reported that NE and 5HT increase stress fiber numbers and decrease EC permeability to macromolecules in vitro, whereas histamine has the opposite effects, and that NE and 5HT eliminate the erythrocyte extravasation associated with thrombocytopenia in vivo. In this study, we propose that these vasoactive amines also alter PMN diapedesis in vitro through a direct effect on the EC, in part due to alterations in the EC cytoskeleton.\r"

  ".W": "The mechanism of the antineoplastic effect of interferon (IFN) is not known and may result from direct effects on the neoplastic cells themselves, activation of intermediary effector cells, or a combination of these effects. The synthesis of specific proteins is induced in hairy cells when they are exposed to alpha-IFN in vitro. In particular, the called p80, is markedly induced. We investigated this effect in the hairy cells of seven patients in the leukemic phase of hairy cell leukemia who were being treated with subcutaneous (SC) IFN alpha 2b (r-Hu-IFN-alpha 2). Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) was carried out on [35S]methionine-labeled whole cell lysates visualized by autoradiography and silver staining. Within 2 days of starting IFN therapy, induction of specific protein synthesis, including p80 was seen by [35S]methionine labeling in freshly isolated circulating hairy cells from 6 of 6 patients tested. Therefore, alpha-IFN has a direct biochemical effect on hairy cells in vivo that is similar to in vitro effects, at least with regard to p80 synthesis, although the kinetics of this effect may vary in the two situations.\r"

NSE from leukapheresed leukemic monocytes were extracted with several types of detergent and grouped into two isoelectric point (pl) categories based on the ease of solubility: pl 5.7-6.3 (8 bands) greater than or equal to pl 6.6-7.6 (6 bands). Normal monocytes yielded only the pl 5.7-6.3 isozymes. Isozymes from both leukemic and normal monocytes were inhibited similarly by sodium fluoride, pH less than 4.7, and a serine active site inhibitor. All isozymes were bound by Sepharose-concanavalin A (Con-A) and displayed similar substrate preferences and pH v activity slopes. Under the conditions of detergent solubilization, the smallest mol wt species retaining enzymatic activity was 50 +/- 5 kd. Despite these similarities, the isozymes of pl 5.7 through 6.3 and pl greater than 6.3 exhibited different degrees or types of inhibition by phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), resistance to heat and antigenic character. Thus, the esterase isozymes represent two families of glycoproteins, both of them probable cell surface enzymes, resembling classical liver carboxyl or B-esterases (EC 3.1.1 1).\r"

The concentration in plasmas collected in EDTA from 455 normal, healthy donors is normally distributed with a mean of 2.9 micrograms/mL (46 nmol/L) and a SD of 1.0 microgram/mL (95% interval of 32% to 168% of the mean). No significant correlation to age or sex could be detected. In comparison, the concentration of protein C antigen measured with the same type of assay on the same 455 samples has a log normal distribution with a mean of 4.0 micrograms/mL (65 nmol/L) and a 95% interval of 70% to 138% of the mean. Also in marked contrast to other plasma vitamin K-dependent proteins, the total protein Z antigen level is extremely low in patients on stable warfarin therapy (range 1% to 16% of normal). Moreover, even though greater than 95% of the antigen in normal plasmas adsorbs to barium citrate (a crude reflection of the presence of gamma-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla) residues), in the patients taking warfarin almost all of the small amount of the antigen failed to adsorb, suggesting that virtually no protein Z had its full complement of Gla residues. Total protein C antigen in the same 25 patients averaged 53% of normal (34% to 72%) and 54% (average) of the total remaining antigen still adsorbed to barium citrate. The concentration of protein Z antigen in the plasma of a normal individual given a loading dose of warfarin fell at an initial rate of approximately 20% a day, indicating a plasma half-life (t1/2) of 2 to 3 days.\r"

  ".W": "Using a novel coverslip-transfer culture technique, we recently demonstrated that primitive erythroid burst-forming units (BFU-E) can migrate, proliferate, and differentiate in intimate association with stromal fibroblastoid cells in the presence of serum proteins and erythropoietin. No other exogenous hemopoietic growth factors are required. Most of the colonies that develop in this system are very large erythroid bursts, and very few granulocyte-macrophage (GM) colonies are observed. In this report, we present data indicating that the predominance of erythroid burst colonies in this culture system is due to preferential binding of primitive erythroid progenitors to the stromal fibroblastoid cells and not to differential stimulation of these erythroid progenitors by these cells. We next show that the binding of BFU-E to stromal cells is blocked by anti-fibronectin antibodies. Finally, we demonstrate the preferential binding of BFU-E to fibronectin by using glass coverslips or Petri dishes coated with purified human plasma fibronectin. The binding is blocked by a monoclonal antibody specific for the cell-binding domain of fibronectin. We conclude that: primitive erythroid progenitors bind strongly whereas G and/or M progenitors (CFU-G/M) bind only weakly to fibronectin; primitive erythroid progenitors bind to the cell-binding domain on the fibronectin molecule; and erythroid progenitors and precursors remain bound to fibronectin throughout differentiation.\r"

The cell lines are Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) negative, monoclonal, and aneuploid and should thus represent malignant cell populations and not EBV-carrying non-neoplastic B lymphoblastoid cell lines. The myeloma origin of the cell lines is also suggested by their capacity for production of monoclonal complete immunoglobulin (Ig) molecules (U-1957 and U-1958) or IgG light chains (U-1996) of the same type as the myeloma protein in vivo. All the cell lines have morphological features of plasmablasts-plasma cells but appear to represent slightly different stages of B cell differentiation. Thus, the U-1958 has plasma cell morphology, expresses only PCA-1 and OKT-10 but no other B cell antigens, and secretes 1.5 micrograms/mL of IgG/10(6) cells/24 hours. The U-1957 has plasma cell morphology and expresses Fc receptors and the LB-1 antigen in addition to the PCA-1 and OKT-10 antigens. This line produces only minimal amounts of IgG, which appears not to be secreted. The U-1996, finally, is a kappa light chain producer, has a plasmablast morphology, and expresses LB-1 in addition to the PCA-1 and OKT-10 antigens. All three cell lines are chromosomally heterogeneous and contain several markers with a 14q+ abnormality as a common characteristic abnormality. These new myeloma lines have been in continuous culture for approximately 3 years and are instrumental in studies of various aspects of the biology of human myeloma.\r"

Plasma cGMP levels were markedly elevated in untreated patients, normalized in all patients who attained complete remission, and increased promptly to pretreatment values in patients who relapsed, suggesting that their determination may be useful to monitor the patients' response to treatment.\r"

We questioned whether some of the effect was independent of oxygen loading and studied the influence of Fluosol DA (Green Cross, Osaka, Japan) and Pluronic on the rheology and adhesion of sickle red cells saturated with oxygen and carbon monoxide. A 5-vol/vol% concentration of Fluosol or equivalent concentration of Pluronic was equally effective at improving the filtration of washed sickle cells through 5-micron-diameter pores at wall shear stresses approximating 1,000 dyne/cm2. The same concentration of Pluronic reduced the extensional static rigidity of irreversibly sickled cells (ISC) by 25% and also abolished the adherence of gravity-sedimented sickle cells to endothelial monolayers in the presence of saline or plasma. The inhibition of adherence was not reversible by washing and was accomplished with equal ease by isolated treatment of sickle cells or endothelium. Pluronic had no effect on the rheology or adhesion of normal adult red cells. Neither Fluosol nor Pluronic changed sickle or normal cell shape, mean cell volume, mean cell density, or cell density distribution. A lubricating effect of Pluronic on cell surfaces could explain all of the rheological observations and offers another direction of inquiry in the search for therapy for sickle cell disease.\r"

As a result, genetically mast cell-deficient WBB6F1-W/Wv or WCB6F1-Sl/Sld mice are widely used for studies of mast cell differentiation and function. We found that mast cells developed at sites of idiopathic chronic dermatitis in WBB6F1-W/Wv mice and that the number of mast cells present in the skin of WBB6F1-W/Wv mice was proportional to the severity of the dermatitis (in ear skin, there were 33 +/- 4 mast cells/mm2 of dermis at sites of severe dermatitis v 9 +/- 3 at sites of mild dermatitis, 0.8 +/- 0.3 in skin without dermatitis, and 100 +/- 7 in the normal skin of congenic WBB6F1-+/+ mice; in back skin, the corresponding values were 2.0 +/- 0.6, 1.1 +/- 0.9, 0.025 +/- 0.025, and 26.2 +/- 3.2). The development of mast cells was a local, not systemic, consequence of the dermatitis. Thus, WBB6F1-W/Wv mice with severe dermatitis lacked mast cells in skin not showing signs of dermatitis and also in the peritoneal cavity, stomach, cecum, and tongue. Idiopathic chronic dermatitis was not associated with the local development of mast cells in WCB6F1-Sl/Sld mice, a mutant whose mast cell deficiency is due to a mechanism distinct from that of WBB6F1-W/Wv mice. These findings may have implications for understanding the nature of the mast cell deficiency in WBB6F1-W/Wv and WCB6F1-Sl/Sld mice and for the use of these mutants to analyze mast cell differentiation and function.\r"

The patient lacked detectable NK cell activity in every phase of the disease as measured by a four-hour 51Cr-release assay using K562 cells as a target. The percent lysis at a 40:1 effector:target ratio by the patient's lymphocytes was persistently below 0.3% as compared with the normal lymphocyte value of 46.2% +/- 5.8% (mean +/- SD). NK cell activity was not detectable at effector:target ratios of 10:1 to 80:1 and by prolongation of the incubation time, and the NK cell defect was not restored or improved by lymphocyte stimulation with polyinosinic-polycytidilic acid, interferon (IFN)-alpha, or interleukin 2 (IL 2). The numbers of Leu-7+ cells and Leu-11+ cells were normal as counted by flow cytometry. A single cell-in-agarose assay demonstrated normal numbers of target binding cells (TBCs), and they showed the morphology of \"large granular lymphocytes.\" However, there were no TBCs with dead targets. These results indicated that the patient's lymphocytes contained normal numbers of NK cells that were capable of recognizing and binding to a target but were incapable of killing the bound target cell. The patient's lymphocytes were then studied for their release of NKCF upon interaction with K562 cells. The patient's cells did not release NKCF, and the NK cell defect was not restored or improved by stimulation of the cells with IFN or IL 2. It is suggested that the deficient release of NKCF may have been related to the killing defect of the NK cells in this patient.\r"

When reacted with solubilized normal platelets, a rabbit antiserum to GPIIIa identified a major band at molecular weight (mol wt) 90,000 and three additional minor bands at Mr 110,000, 81,000, and 64,000. The major band could not be detected, and the minor bands were either markedly reduced or absent in the platelet samples from 14 of the 15 patients from the Iraqi-Jewish population. In contrast, in all four Arab patients tested, the major band was detectable, although at markedly reduced levels, and the minor bands were either markedly reduced or absent; an additional minor band at mol wt 47,000 was also present in the platelets from these patients. One Iraqi-Jewish patient had a unique pattern in which two of the bands were present but reduced and two were undetectable. We conclude that the protein defect, and thus presumably the genetic defect, causing Glanzmann thrombasthenia in the majority of patients in the Iraqi-Jewish population differs from that in the Arab population, and we confirm that there is considerable biochemical heterogeneity among the patients who meet the criteria for type I Glanzmann thrombasthenia.\r"

With this assay it is possible to do both tests with the same sample and same microtiter plate coated with anti-PC monoclonal antibody (MCA)JTC-4, which inhibited neither activation of PC nor activity of activated PC (APC). Even in patients undergoing heparin treatment for severe disseminated intravascular coagulation, there were no detectable differences between amidolytic activity and antigen levels of PC in patients' plasma. In addition, there was a strong correlation between the immunologic levels of PC in patients' plasma determined both by polyclonal ELISA using peroxidase-labeled immunopurified antiprotein C-IgG and those found with MCA ELISA using peroxidase-labeled MCAJTC-5, which does not bind to APC. In contrast, when oral anticoagulation therapy was started, immunologic levels of plasma PC estimated by peroxidase-labeled MCAJTC-1, a MCA that recognizes a gamma-carboxyglutamic acid domain-related conformational change of PC induced by metal ions, decreased more rapidly than did either the PC level determined by polyclonal ELISA or the percent prothrombin time. This suggested that comparison of MCAJTC-1-recognized PC levels and prothrombin time may be necessary at the beginning of oral anticoagulation therapy to treat patients safely.\r"

  ".W": "We found a novel platelet aggregating factor in a patient with steroid-responsive immune thrombocytopenic purpura that is associated with defective collagen-induced platelet functions. The aggregating factor and platelet functions were analyzed. The patient, a 58-year-old female, had purpura and prolonged bleeding time despite adequate platelet counts (greater than 140,000/microL) after steroid therapy. The patient's platelets responded normally to all agonists except collagen. Platelet adhesion to collagen fibrils was decreased. The patient's plasma induced irreversible aggregation and ATP release in normal platelet-rich plasma (PRP). This platelet aggregating factor was found in F(ab')2 fragments of the patient's IgG, which caused thromboxane B2 synthesis, elevation of cytoplasmic Ca2+ levels, and phosphorylation of 40 kDa protein in normal platelets. Platelet aggregation by the patient's IgG was inhibited by prostacyclin, dibutyryl cAMP, diltiazem, disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetate, and antimycin A plus iodoacetate, but ADP scavengers, cyclo-oxygenase inhibitors, and heparin had little or no effect. The aggregating activity of the patient's IgG absorbed to and eluted from normal platelets. The patient's Fab fragments did not induce platelet aggregation in eight of ten normal PRP but specifically inhibited aggregation induced by collagen and by the patient's IgG. The major component of an immunoprecipitate made with the patient's IgG from radiolabeled membrane proteins of normal platelet extract had a 62 kDa mol wt, while no such precipitate appeared in extracts of the patient's platelets. These results indicated that platelet aggregation by the patient's IgG was induced by the reaction of an antibody with a specific antigen on the normal platelet membrane through stimulus-response coupling. This antigen may be a collagen receptor on the platelet, most likely a polypeptide of 62 kDa under reducing condition. The defect of collagen-induced aggregation of the patient's platelets seemed to be due to alteration of the membrane protein related to this putative collagen receptor.\r"

The beta s globin gene was found to be linked almost exclusively to a beta S haplotype ( -++-), which is also common in Saudi Arabian patients from the Eastern Province (referred to as the Asian beta s haplotype). By contrast, the majority of beta A and beta degree thalassemia globin genes are linked to haplotypes common in all European and Asian populations (+-----[+/-]; --++-++). Family studies showed that there is a genetic factor elevating Hb F levels dominantly in homozygotes (SS). This factor appears to be related to the Asian beta s globin haplotype, and a mechanism for its action is discussed. There is also a high prevalence of an independent Swiss type hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin (HPFH) determinant active in both the sickle cell trait and in sickle cell disease.\r"

  ".U": "87214545\r", 
  ".W": "We describe a new spectrin variant with a truncated beta-chain. It was discovered in a 17-year-old white boy presenting with intermittent jaundice and spleen enlargement. He also displayed numerous smooth elliptocytes. On sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel, the truncated beta-chain (beta'-chain) appeared as an additional band of approximately 216 kilodaltons, migrating between spectrin beta-chain and ankyrin. It represented 30% of total beta-chain. The beta'-chain reacted with an antispectrin beta-chain monoclonal antibody. It failed to become phosphorylated when ghosts were incubated in the presence of [gamma-32P] adenosine triphosphate. Whole spectrin tetramerization was defective since the amount of spectrin dimer was increased in spectrin crude extract and the association constant of the spectrin dimer self-association was decreased. Spectrin whole tetramer isolated from spectrin crude extracts contained small quantities of beta'-chain. Spectrin tryptic peptides showed an increase of the 74,000-dalton fragment at the expense of the 80,000-dalton fragment. So far, the latter abnormality has been used to characterize a number of cases of hereditary elliptocytosis or pyropoikilocytosis with no other apparent change. In the present case, we consider that the abnormality is a consequence of the beta-chain alteration. The parents seemed asymptomatic. As a result, we regard this new spectrin variant as deriving from a de novo mutation.\r"

To explore this relationship in more detail, we have studied blood stored in citrate-phosphate-dextrose-adenine under blood bank conditions because, in this system, vesiculation occurs slowly. Vesiculation was quantitated by measuring acetylcholinesterase release, and the extent of spectrin oxidation was detected by using thiol-disulfide exchange chromatography. A strong correlation (r = .92) was found between the extent of spectrin oxidation and vesiculation when blood from five donors was analyzed at weekly intervals during storage. This strongly suggests that spectrin oxidation plays a role in the formation of spectrin-free vesicles, thereby limiting the shelf life of stored blood.\r"

Here we demonstrate that it is responsive to a third hematopoietic factor, the erythroid-specific hormone, erythropoietin (Epo). DA-1 cells are stimulated to proliferate by partly purified natural murine and human Epo, and pure recombinant human Epo. Antibody to Epo specifically blocks Epo-stimulated growth. Maximal growth stimulated by Epo and GM-CSF is similar, and considerably less than that stimulated by multi-CSF. Proliferation stimulated by Epo and GM-CSF is transient, decreasing within 24 to 48 hours of exposure. However, Epo acts cooperatively with GM-CSF to sustain proliferation. With or without GM-CSF, no obvious erythroid differentiation of DA-1 cells occurs after exposure to Epo for up to 72 hours. This is the first report of a growth factor-dependent cell line also responsive to Epo for survival and growth. The availability of this cell line model should greatly facilitate biochemical analysis of the mechanism of Epo growth-stimulating action.\r"

As expected, the RA+ group has significantly more nodules and vasculitis. In terms of clinical joint involvement, the RA- had large-joint involvement. Radiologically, seropositive disease was characterized by more severe involvement of the metacarpophalangeal joints of the thumb and index fingers and in all the metatarsophalangeal joints of the feet. There was no difference either clinically or radiologically between the two groups in terms of symmetry of joint disease or wrist involvement. Of special interest was the finding that the prevalence of HLA-DR4 was elevated to the same degree in both groups but that genetic markers for ankylosing spondylitis and for psoriasis (HLA-B27 and Cw6 respectively) were similar in both groups and not increased above control population levels. It is concluded that the entity defined as RA includes patients with and without rheumatoid factor (RF) in their serum and that this determines differences in disease expression. Whether these differences are the consequences or the cause of RF cannot be concluded on the basis of this study.\r"

The change in the levels of activity of these substances in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis treated with sulphasalazine for 6 months was assessed in 22 patients. Over this time there was a marked improvement in disease activity. This was accompanied by an early increase in red cell LSH and decrease in SOD, although by 6 months these changes had completely reversed. In addition the negative correlation between these indices at week 0 had disappeared by week 6. Over the 6 months there was a steady rise in PSH. The change in PSH is slow and is thus more likely to reflect a change in the disease process rather than an active role for the thiol, but the early changes in intracellular parameters may be of importance in the action of this drug. These changes are similar to changes found with other second-line drugs. It is also of interest that a drug which does not itself possess a thiol group is capable of altering the thiol status of cells.\r"

Rheumatologists tended to prescribe NSAIDs more often initially than simple analgesics while the reverse was true for general practitioners. Over half the patients (57%) considered pain relief as their first priority for drug treatment. Other objectives such as prevention of deformities and relief of stiffness were less important.

  ".W": "Twenty-nine patients, 27 of whom had either inflammatory disease of the pancreas or pancreatic tumour, were studied by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT). Six healthy volunteers were studied by MRI alone. The pancreatic T1 and T2 relaxation times were calculated using a multipoint iterative method with data from seven total saturation recovery and six spin echo sequences. Magnetic resonance imaging can demonstrate the normal pancreas and a variety of pathological processes greater than 1-2 cm in size, but with less spatial resolution than CT. The relaxation-time results indicated no significant discrimination between chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic tumour. A significant elevation in the relaxation times was observed, however, in those patients with calcific chronic pancreatitis compared with the non-calcific chronic pancreatitic group and normal controls, suggesting a different pathophysiology for the two subgroups of chronic pancreatitis. The active phase of acute pancreatitis was associated with significantly elevated relaxation times, which returned to normal levels during the resolved phase of the disease. Associated extrapancreatic fluid collections were characterised by their very long relaxation times. The problems associated with spatial resolution, respiratory motion and lack of quantitative tissue characterisation suggest that MRI of the pancreas, using present methods, is unlikely to contribute to the overall management of patients with exocrine pancreatic disease.\r"

Eight-six of the 899 ultrasound-guided fine-needle biopsies performed during this period were supplemented with EM using the following indications: metastatic lesions with unknown primary tumour, primary retroperitoneal tumours, tumours with atypical clinical histories and where the primary LM evaluation was unable to determine tumour cell type. Two methods of obtaining material for EM were tested, namely, fine-needle aspiration and fine-needle histological biopsy (Surecut). Both methods yielded suitable material for EM evaluation in approximately 80% of the 76 cases where tumour cells were identified by LM. However, it was technically easier to process material for EM when obtained by fine-needle histological biopsy. The results of the 62 cases where suitable material for EM was obtained were grouped according to the histopathological and clinical value of the diagnosis. In 23 cases (37%) EM was without additional diagnostic value. In 12 cases (19%), EM supplied a more precise histopathological diagnosis, but the diagnostic gain was without clinical significance. In 27 cases (44%) EM was of significant clinical value, as the diagnosis by itself was enough to change the investigative procedure and/or the treatment of the patient.\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies have shown a poor correlation between bladder damage and bladder dosage in patients treated with radiation therapy, including intracavitary therapy for uterine tumours. This study was undertaken to investigate prospectively the relationship between the cervical os and the bladder in patients undergoing intracavitary treatment. The computed tomography scans of 59 patients undergoing intracavitary treatment were analysed. The upper limit of the undistended bladder relative to the os extended from 5.5 cm cephalic to the cervix to 4.0 cm below it. The distance from the central tube to the posterior bladder wall at the level of the cervix ranged from 1.5 cm to 4.2 cm. This was positively associated with size of ovoid (p = 0.022), though with considerable individual variation. A separate analysis failed to show a consistent correlation with age or stage of disease. Thirty-nine of the 59 patients (65.5%) had asymmetrical bladders. Of these, half had \"slight\" asymmetry and the others had \"marked\" asymmetry. The thickness of the vesico-vaginal septum varied from 0.5 cm to 2.9 cm but was difficult to assess in some patients. In patients treated with medium-sized ovoids and those with Stage IB and IIB disease, the distance to the bladder base is greatest, though there is marked individual variation. These investigations reveal a marked variation in bladder position relative to the cervix in patients undergoing intracavitary therapy. The position of the bladder cannot be accurately predicted by any of these clinical criteria and requires to be defined by a radiological technique in the individual patient.\r"

Displacements from the prescription delineated by physicians were measured. The displacements included errors to block malposition, field malposition, field malrotation and patient malposition, and these were classified in two categories of displacements, those associated with the portal boundary and those with anatomic structures. Except for one rotational error, only translational errors were found. Displacements greater than 1 cm amounted to 17% with respect to the portal boundary and between 10% and 46% with respect to anatomic landmarks within the portal. From the results of the study, a margin of 1 cm around the tumour is barely sufficient if a 5% accuracy in dose delivery is desired.\r"

We have now extended this work to examine the radiation response of human small-cell lung cancer xenografts and cell lines with a wide range of plating efficiencies. Preliminary experiments using cultured cells indicated that irradiation of a single-cell suspension following disaggregation generally produced similar response data to those obtained when cultures were irradiated in situ and subsequently disaggregated. The response of eight cell lines to a single dose of 2 Gy was measured using both radionuclide uptake and clonogenic assays. There was no correlation between the two sets of data. Agreement between the radiation-response curves obtained using 3HTdR uptake and clonogenic assays was better for high plating efficiency xenografts (NCI-H69, COR-L51) than for low plating efficiency xenografts (COR-L24, COR-L31). Radionuclide uptake indicated very shallow response curves for the low plating efficiency lines. Altering the time of radionuclide addition from the standard Day 4 to other times between Day 2 and Day 6 did not greatly change the indications of radioresponsiveness provided by the assay. Growth-curve experiments for line COR-L24 showed that cell numbers at Day 4 after irradiation with 1.5 Gy or 3 Gy were very similar to those in unirradiated cultures. For NCI-H69, however, the cell numbers were very different for the different radiation doses. It appears that a high proportion of cells in lines such as COR-L24 take many days to show radiation damage as measured by reduced 3HTdR uptake.\r"

Previous techniques used to study CSF flow either are invasive or do not allow accurate measurement. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) offers a non-invasive method of studying the CSF pathways. Our technique uses MR phase images and allows quantitative measurement of flow velocities and volume-flow rates. Four volunteers were studied at the level of the second cervical vertebra (C2). The MRI pulse sequence was gated from the R-wave of the subject's electrocardiogram and 12 scans were taken corresponding to different times in the cardiac cycle. The variation in flow velocity throughout the cycle was plotted, and maximum caudad and cephalad flow velocities and flow rates were calculated. Good agreement was found between three of the four volunteers. The mean maximum caudad velocity was 2.91 cm s-1 occurring at a mean time of 190 ms after the R-wave. This corresponds to a mean maximum flow rate of 4.13 ml s-1. The total imaging time for each study was about 1 h. Technical developments, allowing simultaneous acquisition of several images throughout the cardiac cycle, will reduce this time significantly.\r"

Furthermore, the very act of contrast-agent administration causes a rapid rise in plasma ADH concentration to levels higher than would in any case be expected from modest dehydration. Since the likely effect on circulating ADH of attempted dehydration is dwarfed by the physiological response to a contrast agent, it is considered that such efforts are entirely superfluous.\r"

Women whose pattern changed from DY to N1 had a mean age of 42 years.

The mammographic pattern in the unaffected breast of the cancer case was compared with the pattern in the ipsilateral breast of the healthy twin (control). There were no differences for MZ pairs, while among DZ pairs the cancer case had a prominent parenchymal pattern significantly more often than the control, as assessed by two radiologists independently and blindly. Thus, there is a relationship between parenchymal pattern and risk of breast cancer even when the controls are the twin sisters of breast-cancer cases and are themselves at high risk. The overall similarity, despite disease discordance, in parenchymal pattern of the twins (more evident among MZ than DZ pairs) suggests a familial, possibly genetic influence on parenchymal pattern.\r"

  ".W": "One hundred and one patients with Stage I teratoma of the testis have had an abdomino-pelvic computed tomography (CT) scan. These patients have been followed up for a minimum of 18 months and only eight patients have relapsed in the abdomen alone. The abdomino-pelvic CT scan has a negative predictive value of 92%. In those shown by CT to have retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy, the distribution of disease correlates closely with that reported in the literature following retroperitoneal lymphadenectomy. The CT scan provides information about the amount of tumour present and this influences treatment. Computed tomography is the imaging modality of choice for staging patients with teratoma of the testis and invasive techniques do not appear to be justified.\r"

The results showed that all 14 patients had significant defects in the innervation of their lower urinary tract. These findings suggest that a neurological explanation for acute retention in women should always be sought before making any other diagnosis.\r"

Several studies have reported only a small reduction in potency rates following prostatectomy but have not examined the effect of surgery per se on a group of men in whom one could expect a significant incidence of reduced potency. In order to rectify this defect, a prospective study was undertaken to assess the effect of transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) and other general surgical procedures on two age-matched populations. In all cases potency and ejaculatory function and frequency of intercourse were assessed pre- and post-operatively. Potency was retained in 86% of men undergoing TURP and in all of the men undergoing general surgical procedures (p less than 0.01). Of those men who indicated that they were capable of having sexual intercourse prior to operation, 88% were unaffected by TURP. In the general surgical group 97% were unaffected. Thus it would appear that TURP has a significant effect on sexual function which cannot be accounted for by the stress of surgery or the age of the population undergoing operation.\r"

In order to find a solution to this problem, we undertook a prospective evaluation of 81 men treated for their first urethral stricture with a single urethrotomy. Fifty-one patients with a stricture 5 mm or less in length were catheterised post-operatively for 3 days. Patients with strictures longer than 5 mm were catheterised for 3 weeks (14 patients) or 6 weeks (16 patients). All were followed up for a minimum of 24 months. The stricture recurred in 33 patients (41%). We found that 3 days' catheter drainage was sufficient for patients with short strictures. Whether strictures measuring more than 5 mm might be treated similarly needs further investigation.\r"

Levels were also measured after tactile and visual sexual stimulation and following an intravenous injection of papaverine and phentolamine. A penile erection occurred in all men receiving intracavernosal vasoactive compounds. The mean VIP concentration did not alter significantly in either cavernosal or peripheral venous blood during the erection. Mean VIP concentrations were significantly greater in the neurogenic (all diabetic) group than in the other groups studied. Mean cavernosal and peripheral VIP concentrations did not alter following tactile or visual sexual stimulation and no significant alteration in mean peripheral venous VIP concentration occurred following injection of papaverine and phentolamine. The putative role of VIP in the induction of penile erection has not been elucidated in these studies.\r"

Previous cystoscopies in all 11 patients and the presence of bladder tumour at the time of sampling in six were significantly and independently associated with the isolation of anaerobic bacteria from suprapubic specimens. It was concluded that transurethral instrumentation entails a definite risk of anaerobic urinary infection in addition to the recognised risk of aerobic urinary infection. The findings suggest that the antibiotics used as prophylaxis for or treatment of patients undergoing transurethral procedures should be effective against anaerobic bacteria.\r"

We have attempted to improve on these disappointing results by fashioning a composite graft using expanded PTFE (GORE-TEX) and transposed non-reversed saphenous vein, placed between the femoral artery and anterior tibial artery. We report the early results using this technique in 25 critically ischaemic limbs. At 12 months, the cumulative graft patency for this group of patients was 65 per cent (mean follow-up of 19 months). Eighteen of the twenty-five limbs were saved and there was no mortality. This technique offers a useful alternative to other forms of distal grafting and appears superior to the results obtained using non-autogenous femorodistal conduits.\r"

Apparently, a significant number of postoperative abdominal surgery patients are not optimally perfused, and this state is not recognized by the present clinical criteria.

We studied 43 grafts (36 saphenous vein and 7 human umbilical vein) prospectively by peroperative angiography and then by clinical assessment, post-exercise Doppler ankle pressures and digital subtraction angiography at 1 week, 3 months, 6 months and 1 year. There were 11 grafts inserted for critical ischaemia, 16 for rest pain and 16 for disabling claudication. Four patients died within the year with five patient grafts and these were excluded from the final results. Eight grafts failed during the first year; four within 1 month and a further four subsequently, with no warning alteration of symptoms, ankle Doppler pressure or digital subtraction angiography. Four additional grafts were jeopardized by symptomatic stenoses. Six grafts developed an asymptomatic stenosis of greater than 50 per cent without a change in exercising ankle Doppler pressure. Three symptomatic stenoses were successfully revised but the fourth occluded on conservative management. Three asymptomatic stenoses have also been successfully revised and three have been treated conservatively. Close surveillance of femorodistal grafts is justified by this study but a deterioration in ankle brachial Doppler index was only useful in the patients with recurrent symptoms and was unable to detect half the stenoses of greater than 50 per cent. The detection of these by intravenous digital subtraction angiography might help to avoid graft failure.\r"

The increase in radioactivity in the limb following release of the cuffs is measured using a gamma camera. The mean rate of flow of blood to the limb (in ml (100 ml)-1 tissue min-1) is derived from the graph of radioactivity versus time and from the radioactivity in a sample of venous blood. The results of measurements carried out in patients with peripheral vascular disease (30 limbs) and normal controls (24 limbs) are presented. Repeated studies in 10 subjects (20 limbs) showed the method to be highly reproducible at high and low flow rates (r = 0.99). Case studies illustrating the use of the method as a screening test for peripheral vascular disease and to monitor the effects of treatment are presented.\r"

Overall mortality was 92 per cent and mortality in the 49 patients diagnosed in life was 84 per cent. Fourteen patients (14 per cent) underwent exploratory laparotomy only with no survivors, 26 (25 per cent) had bowel resection alone with 7 surviving, and 9 (9 per cent) had a revascularization procedure, 5 requiring additional bowel resection, with only one surviving. Survivors were usually younger, had a shorter history and less extensive bowel infarction. Improvements in intensive care and nutritional support with the greater use of revascularization procedures in the past 6 years have barely influenced mortality. Delays in diagnosis and treatment contribute to the poor results. Earlier diagnosis might be aided by measuring serum inorganic phosphate and, coupled with the more widespread use of emergency angiography and revascularization procedures, holds out the best hope for future improvement.\r"

Following oral administration of the carcinogen N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine for 6 months, animals were killed 6, 9 or 12 months postoperatively and their stomachs were examined for crypt cell production rate and mucosal DNA content. Compared with shams, crypt cell production rate was more than twice as high in the gastric remnant 12 months after Polya partial gastrectomy (P less than 0.001) and median DNA content was 31 per cent greater (P = 0.05). After total duodenogastric reflux, DNA content was 62 per cent greater than in shams (P = 0.02), while Roux-en-Y diversion reduced crypt cell production rate by 65 per cent (P less than 0.001). Only Polya gastrectomy increased the number of rats developing gastric carcinomas (9 versus 2 shams; P less than 0.05). Increased mucosal cell proliferation in rats with duodenogastric reflux may help to explain the development of gastric stump cancer.\r"

The diagnostic accuracy of fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) for cytology was therefore assessed in 562 patients with nodular thyroid disease, 373 of whom (66.4 per cent) had histological confirmation of the cytological diagnosis. Sixty-one aspiration biopsies were positive for malignancy, and the diagnosis was confirmed histologically in 59 of these (96.7 per cent). Thus, there were two false positive cytology results among 310 patients with proven benign disease (0.6 per cent). Four of sixty-three patients with proven carcinoma had a benign cytological diagnosis, a false negative rate of 6.3 per cent. In 57 of the 59 malignancies (96.6 per cent) correctly diagnosed by FNAB the histological type of tumour was successfully identified. Overall 367 of 373 patients received correct cytological discrimination between benign and malignant nodules, an overall accuracy of 98.4 per cent for FNAB. The sensitivity of the test was 93.7 per cent and the specificity 99.4 per cent. Besides being safe, cost-effective and reliable, FNAB directs the appropriate selection of patients for surgery and enables the correct operation to be performed for each type of tumour.\r"

It is concluded that trauma causes increased viscosity of blood in these patients. This change could predispose to deep vein thrombosis.

Systemic antibiotics given before operation resulted in a significant reduction in both the concentration and growth rate of viable bacteria in the peritoneal fluid. Lavage of the peritoneal cavity with saline resulted in a further reduction in growth rate in patients given pre-operative systemic antibiotics by an effect attributable to simple dilution. In contrast, peritoneal lavage with tetracycline (1 mg/ml) resulted in complete inhibition of bacterial growth in the residual peritoneal fluid. These observations support the policy of giving systemic antibiotics to patients with generalized peritonitis as soon as the diagnosis has been made and provide bacteriological evidence for the value of peroperative antibiotic peritoneal lavage.\r"

Extravasation of saliva from the sublingual gland due to trauma or obstruction of its ducts appears to be the most likely cause of plunging ranula. Available data suggest that the submandibular gland is usually not involved, although at the time of surgery it may be extremely difficult to exclude a submandibular origin of the cyst in the neck. Communication between the oral and cervical components of the plunging ranula probably occur via a hiatus in the mylohyoid muscle. Such communication passing directly into the submandibular compartment may simulate submandibular gland involvement. Since 1910, 139 procedures in 89 patients with plunging ranula have been reported in the English literature. The recurrence rate was 70 per cent after incision and drainage of the cyst, 53 per cent after marsupialization, 85 per cent after excision of the cyst in the neck and 2 per cent after excision of the sublingual gland via the cervical or intra-oral route. This review suggests that excision of the sublingual gland with intra-oral drainage of the cervical swelling appears to be the treatment of choice for the plunging ranula.\r"

Both layers were significantly weaker in bled animals; by 36 per cent for skin (P less than 0.02) and by 22 per cent for muscle (P = 0.02). Secondly, wound fibroblast function was assessed after 10 days by quantitative histology and autoradiography (30 control: 31 bled). There were no significant differences between the two groups for fibroblast density, replication ([3H]thymidine), or general protein synthesis ([3H]leucine). Bled animals had less dense collagen packing by 21 per cent (P less than 0.01), but 33 per cent more incorporation of ([3H]proline) by fibroblasts (P less than 0.01) compared with control animals. The effect of compensated oligaemia on wound healing is more marked in skin than in muscle; it appears to be a specific increase in collagen turnover with the increase in reabsorption exceeding that in synthesis.\r"

  ".W": "A 6 1/2 year experience in the management of hepatic colorectal metastases in a specialist unit is reviewed. During the period studied, 48 patients were referred of whom only 24 actually came to resection. There were two in-hospital deaths, at 20 and 60 days, and six patients had non-fatal complications. Although the extent of resection was greater than in most reported series (13 right hepatectomies and 6 extended right hepatectomies), the results of resection were broadly the same as those of others, with a median survival of 30 months and 2 and 3 year survivals of 50 and 44 per cent respectively. A number of factors which others have considered to be of prognostic significance were examined. Tumour clearance was the only important prognostic indicator, where a 5 mm clear margin between the tumour and cut surface produced a significant difference in survival. It is suggested that a much larger number of patients in the UK with hepatic colorectal metastases might be considered for resection.\r"

Thus the median leucocyte zinc concentration of the mothers delivering babies weighing below the 10th centile was 112 nmol/10(9) leucocytes and that of the mothers with babies weighing above the 90th centile was 229.5 nmol/10(9) leucocytes. A maternal leucocyte zinc concentration less than 120 nmol/10(9) leucocytes strongly predicted a baby weighing below the 10th centile (positive predictive value = 71.9%, negative predictive value = 91.5%, sensitivity = 64.3%, specificity = 81.8%). These findings suggest that maternal zinc concentration might have a role in antenatal screening, but larger studies are required.\r"

It has been suggested that health authorities should produce a comprehensive response to the health problems caused by unemployment, and a survey was undertaken to find how many had done so. All the regional and district health authorities in England, the health boards of Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland, and the family practitioner committees of England and Wales were asked by letter what they were doing to respond to the health problems of unemployment. A list of suggestions of what they might be doing was enclosed. The overall response rate was 77% (255/331), and 50% (127/255) of the respondents were doing something--33.3% (3/9) of the regional health authorities, 64% (101/158) of the district health authorities and health boards, and 26% (23/88) of the family practitioner committees. The paper describes what they were doing. A relation was sought between the level of unemployment in an area and the extent of the response, and a significant association was found. Half of Britain's health authorities are now responding in some way to the health problems associated with unemployment.\r"

For this purpose, the fastest possible self-paced single isometric forefinger extensions and the fastest alternating forefinger movements were tested. In addition to these fastest voluntary performances, the time course of spontaneous hyperkinetic finger movements and the peak frequency of finger and hand tremor were analysed as a measure of the temporal characteristics of involuntary movements. Comparison of these parameters in HD patients and individuals at risk with age and sex-matched normal controls revealed a significant slowing of all types of contractions or movements in the majority (up to 95%) of the patients and in up to 40% of the relatives at risk. Reaction times were only slightly prolonged, and the abnormalities of the movement parameters showed no correlation with detailed psychometric data. Hence it is unlikely that the disturbance in the execution of rapid motor acts is due to dementia. Tremor was also slower than normal and the hyperkinesias were still slower than the fastest voluntary contractions. It appears from this study that slowness of motor performance is not only evident in Parkinson's disease but may represent a more general dysfunction in basal ganglia disease.\r"

In contrast to the findings of recent case studies of word-finding difficulty (e.g., Howard and Orchard-Lisle, 1984), it was observed that the patient seemed to have a clear understanding of the items that he was trying to name, suggesting that his problems in word-finding were not semantically based. Indeed, the patient would often generate partial phonological information about the sought-after word, indicating that he had a specific target in mind, and this was reminiscent of 'tip-of-the-tongue' states in normal word-finding. A difficulty in retrieving complete phonological forms of words is considered as the probable locus of his anomia. A distinction is made between semantically-based and phonologically-based anomias.\r"

  ".W": "Because of occasional reports of exudative retinal detachment with facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSH) and deafness, we sought to determine by fluorescein angiography whether there is any general relationship between FSH muscular dystrophy and retinal vascular disease. Peripheral retinal capillary abnormalities, comprising telangiectasis, closure, leakage and microaneurysm formation, were demonstrated by angiography in 56 out of 75 individuals with clinical or genetic evidence of FSH. Only 3 patients had relevant ophthalmoscopic abnormalities of the posterior pole and in only 1 was there consequent visual loss. This study included one FSH family in which the propositus was treated for exudative retinopathy and 13 other subjects had telangiectasis, and 8 cases (including 3 parents of apparently 'sporadic' FSH cases) in which fluorescein angiography confirmed the abnormal genotype, even though clinical examination of skeletal muscle revealed no clear abnormality. There was no correlation between the severity of the muscle disease and the extent of the retinal vascular abnormality. Visual complications of telangiectasis, although rare, may present early in life and before there is overt evidence of muscle disease. Since visual loss may be preventable, ophthalmic examination should be undertaken on infants at risk of having the abnormal gene. The findings support the hypothesis that retinal capillary abnormalities are an integral part of the FSH muscular dystrophy syndrome and raise the question as to whether analogous capillary abnormalities could be implicated in the pathogenesis of FSH muscle disease.\r"

All had suffered either ischaemic hemisphere infarcts (80%) and/or transient ischaemic attacks (80%) involving one (78%) or both (22%) carotid territories. In addition, 10 subjects (14%) incurred recurrent vertebrobasilar or presyncopal episodes, many of which appeared secondary to haemodynamic insufficiency. The incidence of risk factors and concomitant vascular disease was high; 93% gave a history of heavy smoking. Thirty-four subjects were treated conservatively and followed prospectively for a mean of 42 months. Eighteen patients (53%) suffered further cerebrovascular events, an ischaemic event rate of 15% per patient per year. These were isolated transient ischaemic attacks (TIAs) in 7 and stroke in 11 patients. The latter suffered a total of 15 strokes during the follow-up period of 42 months; the annual stroke rate was 13% per patient year. Patients who had presented with ischaemic events involving more than one carotid territory were significantly more prone to subsequent cerebral infarction than those in whom symptoms had been confined to one territory (P less than 0.05). None of the 5 patients with haemodynamic TIAs who were managed conservatively developed a stroke during the follow-up period and their symptoms remitted spontaneously. Deaths per year amounted to 8%. Twenty-four patients (71%) survived, of whom half were either symptom-free or minimally disabled. In this group of preselected patients, which excludes those with severe deficits at presentation, bilateral occlusion of the carotid arteries may be a condition compatible with useful existence.\r"

  ".W": "The accuracy of reinnervation in peripheral nerves following second degree injuries, which do not disrupt the longitudinal continuity of the endoneurial sheaths, has been studied in rats. The sciatic nerve or lumbar spinal nerves (that is the extraspinal nerves before their fusion in the sciatic plexus) were crushed with fine watchmakers' forceps in neonatal and adult rats. In addition, the lumbar spinal nerves were frozen in a group of 5 adult rats. After allowing reinnervation to occur for 5 to 9 weeks, the motoneurons whose axons ran in the plantar nerve were labelled retrogradely with horseradish peroxidase. Their positions in the grey matter of the lumbar spinal cord were recorded and compared with those labelled from the contralateral unoperated plantar nerve. Very few errors of projection occurred after a crush lesion of the adult sciatic nerve but all the other lesions produced significant numbers of errors. The order, starting with the preparations with fewest errors was as follows (numbers in brackets = percentage of neurons misplaced): sciatic crush in adult (3%), sciatic crush in neonate (23%), spinal nerve freeze in adult (23%), spinal nerve crush in adult (35%), and spinal nerve crush in neonate (72%). It seems that a significant number of axonal growth cones cross endoneurial sheaths after crush or cryoinjuries. Explanations for the difference in observed reinnervation accuracy between young and old rats and between lesions in peripheral nerves and spinal nerves are discussed. The first is that axons in peripheral nerves in older rats have a less penetrable endoneurial membrane encasing them. The second is that the amount of misrouting is the same at all lesion sites but is much less easily detectable after sciatic lesions than spinal nerve lesions. This is because axons are organized in a 'musculotopic' manner in peripheral nerves and exchange of axon positions will occur largely between axons destined for the same peripheral target. In contrast, exchange of positions of axons in spinal nerves will lead to more overt errors because at this site axons destined for particular muscles do not lie side by side but are intermingled with axons innervating other peripheral targets.\r"

Infusion of hypertonic saline caused a marked rise in blood pressure in the tetraplegics but not in the normal controls. Head-up tilt resulted in a greater AVP response in the tetraplegics than in the controls because of the additional hypotensive response in the tetraplegics. Infusion of AVP itself at physiological concentrations had little effect on blood pressure in the normal subjects but resulted in a marked rise in blood pressure in the tetraplegics. Tetraplegics therefore show appropriate release of AVP to both osmotic and cardiovascular stimuli but increased sensitivity to the pressor effects of this hormone.\r"

  ".W": "Neurohypophyseal function has been investigated in 11 children undergoing pituitary or suprasellar surgery. All had corticosteroid and thyroxine replacement; 9 developed diabetes insipidus (DI) within 1-12 h of operation. At the onset of DI, the plasma vasopressin (AVP) concentration was 3.9 +/- 1.2 pmol/l, considerably higher values usually associated with cranial DI (less than 0.9 pmol/l). AVP fell significantly to 1.1 +/- 0.2 pmol/l by the second day of DI. There was a similar change of levels of the AVP prohormone/carrier peptide, neurophysin I, but plasma oxytocin did not change significantly. High performance liquid chromatography of plasma at the onset of DI revealed a major peak that coeluted with synthetic AVP and two smaller peaks of AVP immunoreactivity. Seven patients required very large doses of desamino-8-D-arginine vasopressin (DDAVP) during the first day; 4 needed smaller doses on day 2. Water deprivation tests were performed on days 6 and 14 after operation in 5 patients with prolonged DI (2 with a triple response). There were no differences in plasma AVP on the two occasions but urinary AVP excretion rate was significantly higher on day 6 (2.4 +/- 0.8 pmol/h) than day 14 (0.7 +/- 0.3 pmol/h). It is concluded that early postoperative DI is not due to decreased levels of circulating AVP but may be related to the release of biologically inactive precursors from the damaged neurohypophysis. These may lead to renal refractoriness to AVP. There is a higher urinary AVP excretion rate on day 6 than day 14 after operation in both patients with a triple response and those with uninterrupted DI. Other factors may determine whether or not a transient resolution phase of DI occurs.\r"

They were apraxic at the first examination and had a second (and in some cases, a third) neuropsychological assessment after some months. Six patients with bilateral lesions were also studied to help to define the role of the right hemisphere in recovery from IMA. Other neuropsychological variables (Token Test, Progressive Matrices and Oral Apraxia scores) and site and size of the lesion were also determined. The main results are that improvement from IMA is related to the site of the lesion (anterior lesions faring better); the evolution of IMA is related more to the evolution of oral apraxia than to the evolution of other neuropsychological variables; and the presence of a second lesion in the right hemisphere did not have the negative influence on recovery that might have been expected.\r"

The risk of suffering a stroke without premonitory transient ischaemic attacks (TIAs) was similarly low at 0.4%. Progression of EAD was the only predictor established to indicate the individual patient's cerebrovascular prognosis among a series of criteria tested (age, sex, degree and extent of carotid and/or vertebral disease, risk factors and indicators of atherosclerosis). Deterioration of EAD was observed in 108 (36%) of 296 patients by repeated Doppler examination, 174 (59%) remained constant and 14 (5%) showed an improvement. The observed low rate of strokes without premonitory TIAs is not in favour for early carotid endarterectomy in the majority of neurologically asymptomatic patients.\r"

A lesion anywhere along this pathway impaired thermoregulatory sweating and flushing on the denervated side of the forehead in most patients and also of the cheek in some cases. Emotional sweating was also diminished on the denervated side of the forehead irrespective of the site of lesion, but impairment of emotional vasodilatation was noted only with peripheral (second or third neuron) lesions. These findings suggest that sympathetic vasodilator fibres accompany vasoconstrictor and sudomotor fibres through conventional sympathetic pathways to the face. Gustatory sweating and flushing were symmetrical in most patients but flushing was more marked on the denervated side in three cases. Gustatory sweating was accompanied by flushing on the denervated side of the forehead in one patient following section of the T2 and T3 roots. It is concluded that the cervical sympathetic outflow is the main pathway for thermoregulatory flushing and emotional blushing and that diminution or absence of such vasodilator reactions is a usual component of Horner's syndrome unless the responsible lesion is confined to the first thoracic root. Gustatory vasodilatation and sweating is preserved and becomes exaggerated in some instances.\r"

There were 91 organ failures observed in 34 patients, of which 26 had MOF. The most frequently affected organ was the lung, followed by the heart, kidney, liver and the blood clotting system. The mortality rate was 76.9 per cent in MOF and 1.5 per cent in non-MOF patients. Septicaemia was closely associated with the development of MOF. Also, inhalation injury and 'shock' were contributing factors to the morbidity. Five extensively burned patients had an early development of MOF without infectious foci and this type of early MOF was attributed to endotoxaemia possibly originating from the patient's own intestinal flora.\r"

There was a significant lowering in plasma fibronectin (FN) values in all cases on post-burn day 1 (112.56-185.85 micrograms/ml) and post-burn day 2 (44.03-298.0 micrograms/ml). The concentrations returned to within the normal range in 19 survivors within 3-6 days. In five non-survivors, plasma FN levels fell progressively until death. In another nine patients with burns ranging from 3 per cent to 25 per cent TBSA, plasma FN level was found to be normal on post-burn day 1. The likely causes of the reduced concentrations of plasma fibronectin in patients with burn injuries are briefly discussed. It seems that the level of plasma fibronectin may be used as a prognostic index in burn patients.\r"

In a study of 12 control and 12 burned patients with 20-30 per cent partial skin thickness burns, 2 X 10(6) leucocytes obtained from controls and patients have been pretreated first with vitamin E, zinc and selenium and their combinations for 30 min. Then the responses of these cells to zymosan stimulation (40 X 10(6) particles per 2 X 10(6) cells) were comparatively investigated. The release of acid phosphatase, chosen as a marker of lysosomal enzyme in this study, showed a significant increase in leucocytes from burned patients (P less than 0.01). Vitamin E, zinc and selenium prevented this increase of acid phosphatase significantly (P less than 0.01), and the effect of these compounds was found to be similar rather than additive. These results suggested that the addition of the membrane-stabilizing agents may help in the treatment of burned patients.\r"

Since 1978, we have been using human amniotic membrane incorporating 0.5 per cent silver nitrate. Studies in 96 patients using this method showed that the silver-incorporated membranes gave a better therapeutic effect than plain amniotic membranes. It was noted that 0.5 per cent silver nitrate incorporated into the membranes increased their manageability, provided easier application to the burned area and created a bactericidal effect, therefore reducing the risk of contamination and infection. One of the main advantages of wound coverage with amniotic membrane is that it does not appear to discourage re-epithelization, reduces fluid, protein, heat and energy loss, increases mobility and most important this may be the ideal wound cover next to the patient's own skin. Therefore, we highly recommend the use of 0.5 per cent silver nitrate-incorporated amniotic membrane, since it is readily available and freely obtainable, has low preparation and storage costs that make it an ideal dressing to use, especially in countries where economic factors prevent the purchase of other types of dressings.\r"

  ".U": "87215269\r", 
  ".W": "During the early morning of Monday, 19 November 1984, one of the largest disasters in industrial history occurred in the Mexico City Area, causing the greatest rescue effort to assist population in an emergency ever undertaken. The tragic catastrophe started in a large LPG (Liquid Petroleum Gas) storage and distribution centre in San Juan Ixhuatepec, 20 km north of Mexico City. The facilities, owned by the Pemex State Oil Company, consisted of six spherical storage tanks (four with a volume of 1600 m3 and two with a volume of 2400 m3) and 48 horizontal cylindrical bullet tanks of different sizes. At the time of the disaster the storage tanks contained 11,000 m3 of a mixture of propane and butane. The inhabitants of San Juan Ixhuatepec numbered about 40,000, and a further 60,000 lived in the hills surrounding the village. The majority were poor country people living in one-story houses constructed of concrete pillars filled in with bricks and with roofs of iron sheets. The disaster started due to LPG leakage, probably a pipe leakage or rupture due to excess pressure. A vapour cloud built up and was slowly moved by the north-east wind towards the ground-placed flare pit located in the western part of the plant. The vapour cloud was ignited around 5:40 a.m. and was followed by an extensive fire at the plant area. The first explosion was registered on the seismograph at the University of Mexico at 05 h 44 min 52 s and was followed by a dozen explosions within the next hour, some of them of BLEVE type (Boiling Liquid Expanding Vapour Explosion) due to rupture of one or more storage tanks. Two of the explosions had an intensity of 0.5 on the Richter scale. Unburned and burning gas entered the houses south of the plant area and set fire to everything. Blast waves from the explosions not only destroyed a number of houses but also shifted several cylindrical tanks from their supports and added more gas to the fire. The smaller spheres and some of the cylinders exploded and fragments and even whole cylinders weighing around 30 tons, were scattered over distances ranging from a few to up to 1200 m.\r"

The diagnosis of a ruptured SHL was made between 4 and 18 days of life by means of clinical and sonographic findings in four of the infants; an intact SHL was diagnosed at autopsy in the other two. None of the cases was associated with parenchymal rupture of the liver. Thrombocytopenia was present in five of the six infants and in all four infants with hemoperitoneum. Other possibly relevant antecedent events included mechanical ventilation (in all six), administration of indomethacin (in all six), hypoxia (in five), bilateral pneumothorax necessitating repeated pleural drainage (in three), external cardiac massage (in three) and septicemia (in two). Two of the three infants who underwent surgery survived the operation but later died of unrelated events. One infant who was managed conservatively also survived. A large SHL should be considered in all infants of very low birth weight with unexplained hypovolemia or anemia.\r"

Limited local toxicity occurs with stings; systemic reactions to venoms are mediated by IgE antibodies and can be prevented by immunization with the appropriate venom. Skin testing with venoms detects the sensitized state, and a positive test predicts a 50 to 60% risk of an allergic response to a future sting. Because considerable crossreactivity exists between vespid venom allergens, choice of correct venom(s) for immunotherapy will not always be indicated by skin-testing with whole, unfractionated venom. Further efforts at skin testing with individual venom antigens may help to resolve problems regarding choice of venoms for immunotherapy.\r"
