  ".W": "Alpha 1-antitrypsin-Pittsburgh (AT-P), a naturally occurring lethal mutation (358Met----Arg), has been genetically engineered (rAT-P). The protein has been shown to be a potent active site-directed inhibitor of thrombin and the contact enzymes Factor XIIf, Factor XIa, and kallikrein. Because activation of the contact system is known to occur in gram-negative septicemia, the authors have hypothesized that the administration of rAT-P might modulate the course of this syndrome. Yorkshire piglets anesthetized with pentobarbital and infused with viable Pseudomonas aeruginosa (2 X 10(8) CFU) were untreated (Group I) or treated with rAT-P (Group II) and studied in a 6-hour protocol. Coagulation studies revealed that rAT-P significantly inhibited the rapid decrease in the functional concentrations of Antithrombin III, Factor XI, and fibrinogen. In addition, rAT-P markedly reduced the serum levels of fibrinogen degradation products. Survival in Group II was significantly increased during 2-5 hours but not at 6 hours when the functional levels of rAT-P in plasma were the lowest. These results indicate that this recombinant inhibitor, even at low concentrations, affords protection in experimental gram-negative septicemia.\r"

Previous studies had not evaluated intestinal absorption after long-term continuous administration of epidermal growth factor or compared luminal perfusion with systemic infusion. Epidermal growth factor (150 micrograms/kg/day) was continuously infused either systemically or luminally for 14 days into young adult Fisher strain rats. Luminal studies were performed by creating 10 cm Thiry-Vella loops. At the conclusion of the 14 day infusions, mucosal DNA concentration and absorption of carbon-14 galactose and carbon-14 glycine were determined. The increase in DNA concentration after systemic or luminal infusion of epidermal growth factor was not statistically significant. However, galactose absorption increased 1.9-fold (p less than 0.05) after systemic epidermal growth factor infusion and glycine absorption increased 4.4-fold (p less than 0.01). Luminal epidermal growth factor perfusion increased galactose absorption 2.4-fold (p less than 0.05) and glycine absorption 4.1-fold (p less than 0.01). Thus, both systemic and luminal administration of epidermal growth factor can significantly increase substrate absorption. Additional studies on the physiologic implications and clinical usefulness of these data are warranted.\r"

The presenting symptoms in all six patients were weakness and bone pain. Three patients had a bone fracture after insignificant trauma, one and probably two passed kidney stones, and a duodenal ulcer developed in two. Bone x-ray films showed generalized osteoporosis in all patients. Renal function and arterial blood pH were within normal limits in every patient. The diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism in each patient was based on repeated demonstrations of hypercalcemia, hypophosphatemia, and markedly elevated serum immunoreactive parathyroid hormone concentrations. In all six patients, removal of the parathyroid adenoma resulted in disappearance of symptoms; normalization of serum calcium, phosphorus, and immunoreactive parathyroid hormone levels; and in four of the six, improvement in radiographic evidence of osteoporosis during follow-up of from 1 to 6 years. The association of cirrhosis, portacaval shunt, and primary hyperparathyroidism has not been documented previously. Our six patients with primary hyperparathyroidism constitute 3.4 percent of 174 survivors of emergency portacaval shunt in a series of 264 unselected, consecutive patients with cirrhosis and bleeding esophageal varices. Hepatic osteodystrophy is known to have occurred in only 11 of these 174 survivors. Primary hyperparathyroidism may be a more common cause of hepatic osteodystrophy than has been previously recognized, and should be considered in patients with cirrhosis in whom weakness, bone pain, and bone demineralization develop, particularly if they have a portacaval anastomosis.\r"

  ".W": "The delay in gastric emptying after a meal is thought to result from nutrient distention-induced release of peptides and neurotransmitters in the gut. The potential contribution of the brain and central neuropeptides to the postprandial regulation of gastric emptying has not been studied adequately. The purpose of this study was twofold: to examine the relative importance and pure central stimulation (sham feeding) or pure peripheral stimulation (duodenal feeding) on gastric emptying, and to determine whether relevant neuropeptides act in the brain to slow gastric emptying of a meal. Six mongrel dogs were prepared with esophageal fistulas, gastric fistulas, duodenal fistulas, and chronic lateral cerebroventricular guides. Gastric emptying of a 300 ml saline solution meal was measured by a phenol red dye dilution technique. Sham feeding of a blenderized meal through the esophageal fistula was used as a central cephalic stimulus. Intraduodenal oleic acid was used as a peripheral stimulus. Both sham feeding and intraduodenal oleic acid inhibited gastric emptying by 59 +/- 12 percent, 73 +/- 5 percent, respectively. In separate studies, we examined the effect on gastric emptying of a bolus injection into the lateral cerebral ventricle of graded doses of corticotropin-releasing factor (110 to 440 pmol/kg), cholecystokinin (16 to 128 pmol/kg), somatostatin-14 (55 pmol/kg), human calcitonin gene-related peptide (230 pmol/kg), and neuropeptide Y (62 to 250 pmol/kg). These peptides are known to affect satiety, gastric emptying, and gastric acid secretion. Of these, only neuropeptide Y and cholecystokinin had an effect on gastric emptying when administered into the lateral cerebral ventricle. Neuropeptide Y inhibited emptying by 28 +/- 8 percent and cholecystokinin accelerated emptying by 32 +/- 12 percent (p less than 0.05). Sham feeding inhibits gastric emptying to a similar degree as intraduodenal feeding, and of the neuropeptides tested, only neuropeptide Y inhibited gastric emptying when given into the brain. The central release of neuropeptides such as neuropeptide Y during a meal may trigger neural pathways that promote postprandial delay in gastric emptying. Central signals may be as important as peripheral signals in the postprandial control of gastric emptying. Further studies are needed to determine the mechanism by which sham feeding inhibits gastric emptying and whether central release of neuropeptide Y is involved.\r"

We investigated whether either splenic reticuloendothelial clearance of a blood flow-dependent colloid or macrophage and T-cell populations might be altered by resection or autotransplantation of the spleen. Our results have shown that bloodstream reticuloendothelial clearance of technetium 99m sulfur colloid is not impaired by splenectomy, partial resection of the spleen, or splenic autotransplantation. Such clearance is dependent on spleen weight and is not related to differences in either macrophage or helper or suppressor T-cell populations. This suggests that autotransplantation of the spleen is inferior to preservation of even a small hilar remnant and implies that repair or partial resection of the spleen will provide greater protection than autotransplantation.\r"

Two minutes after induction of anesthesia, baseline hemodynamic measurements were obtained and either atracurium 0.5 mg/kg (group 1) or vecuronium 0.12 mg/kg (group 2) was administered as an intravenous bolus. Hemodynamic measurements were then repeated 2, 5, and 10 minutes after injection. Atracurium produced a statistically significant decrease in blood pressure at 2 minutes and a statistically significant increase in cardiac output and decrease in systemic vascular resistance at 2, 5, and 10 minutes. Vecuronium produced no statistically significant changes in any hemodynamic variable measured other than a decrease in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure 10 minutes after the drug was administered. The hemodynamic changes seen with atracurium were closely related to changes in serum histamine levels, whereas histamine level did not change after vecuronium. There were no statistically significant differences between the two groups, even though after atracurium statistically significant changes were observed while there were no statistically significant changes associated with vecuronium. It is concluded that when utilizing the above clinical dose range, use of vecuronium may be advantageous over use of atracurium when hemodynamic stability is crucial in the anesthetic management of cardiac surgical patients.\r"

  ".W": "S-type alpha 1-antitrypsin (alpha 1AT) is a deficiency haplotype that differs from the common normal M1 (val213) alpha 1AT haplotype by a single amino acid (glu264 to val264). To evaluate the adequacy of the antineutrophil elastase protection associated with the S homozygous state, alpha 1AT plasma and lung epithelial lining fluid (ELF) levels and antineutrophil elastase function were analyzed in 9 PISS subjects. The plasma alpha 1AT levels of SS subjects were intermediate between that of M1M1 and ZZ subjects (p less than 0.001, all comparisons) and the plasma neutrophil elastase inhibitory capacity paralleled the differences in alpha 1AT concentration (p less than 0.001, all comparisons). The association rate constant for neutrophil elastase of the purified S protein was less than that of the normal molecule (S-type, 7.1 +/- 0.1 X 10(6) M-1 s-1; M1-type, 9.6 +/- 0.2 X 10(6) M-1 s-1; p less than 0.001), but much greater than that for the Z molecule (p less than 0.001). Exposure of the purified S protein to increasing oxidant burdens resulted in a dose-dependent reduction in the ability of the molecule to inhibit neutrophil elastase in a fashion parallel to that of the M1 and Z proteins. Quantification of ELF alpha 1AT levels and antineutrophil elastase capacity demonstrated that the SS ELF parameters were, as in plasma, intermediate between M1 homozygotes and Z homozygotes. Using the association rate constant together with the quantification of ELF alpha 1AT levels, the \"in vivo lung inhibition time\" was estimated, yielding an assessment of the relative antineutrophil elastase screen of the PISS lower respiratory tract.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Two of her sisters have a similar deficiency, one with an onset of symptoms at 17 yr of age. Because of the likelihood that there are a number of different PI*QO alleles, the type in this family has been named null Mattawa (QOmattawa). All 3 homozygotes have shown a marked deterioration of lung function over a 7-yr period of follow-up. In contrast, lung function tests of 6 age-matched nonsmoking subjects with alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency, PI type ZZ, showed no abnormalities of lung function. The 15 to 20% of the normal plasma concentration of alpha 1-antitrypsin associated with the PI*Z allele appears to provide some protection to the lung in comparison with a complete deficiency state.\r"

Ten patients with PCP were restudied approximately 60 days after treatment. When clinically indicated, lung biopsies were obtained for histologic examination. Compared with mean values in control subjects (DL = 92%, DM = 101%, and VC = 35 ml/m2), all values were decreased (p less than 0.01) in patients with PCP (DL = 58%, DM = 33%, and VC = 26 ml/m2) and in those without PCP (DL = 61%, DM = 56%, and VC = 22 ml/m2). Values of DM were significantly less (p less than 0.05) in patients with, than in those without, PCP. Analysis of lung biopsies by light and electron microscopy showed overlapping morphologic abnormalities in the 2 groups of patients. In the 10 patients with PCP restudied after successful treatment, the mean DL increased from 60 to 80% (p less than 0.0005), the DM increased from 35 to 108% (p less than 0.006), and the VC did not change. These results suggest that in contrast to most disorders in which DL is decreased, PCP causes reversible alveolar-capillary block.\r"

The condition was originally described in the stomach but there have been reports of three similar lesions found in the colon. A patient with massive bleeding from a submucosal artery in the ascending colon with complete angiographic and histologic examination is the fourth case reported in the literature. This lesion is identical to previous clinical and pathological descriptions of Dieulafoy's ulcers presenting in the stomach. This pathologic entity may exist in the colon and can cause massive bleeding. Diagnosis is by angiography and by pathologic confirmation of the lesion. Treatment is primarily surgical resection because the massive bleeding precludes colonoscopic control of bleeding. The differential diagnosis of massive colonic hemorrhage should include this lesion.\r"

We used a colonoscope passed by mouth intraoperatively in order to determine the site of bleeding in four patients. All patients required resection with one requiring laser therapy as well. We found that the following principles were important in maximizing the value of this technique: (1) Good communication between the endoscopist and operating surgeon during the procedure, (2) clamping the distal small bowel to prevent air accumulation in the colon (3) examining the bowel on the way in and avoiding the use of suction to minimize scope trauma artifact, (4) turning off the room lights in order to examine the transilluminated bowel externally, (5) examining the entire small bowel if possible, and (6) marking each site externally with a suture as it is identified.\r"

Two hundred twenty two procedures were performed on 104 patients (58M:46W) during this 26 month period. The study encompasses a unique period of time in this center, as it includes the initial use of the endoscopic laser technique, the learning curves associated with its application, and finally, the time when its use became routine. Treatment of tumors was the indication in 47 per cent of the cases. Gastrointestinal bleeding of benign cause was the indication in nearly half of the patients; arteriovenous malformations were the most common causes of bleeding. Laser photocoagulation of hemorrhoids was performed in 11 cases. Upper endoscopy was the route in 33 per cent of procedures. Anoscopy, flexible sigmoidoscopy, and colonoscopy were the routes in the remainder. The time spent on the procedure and the energy delivered were found to be variables of the type of lesion and the endoscopic route. Nd-YAG laser endoscopy can be used safely and effectively for a variety of bleeding and obstructive gastrointestinal conditions. Appropriate certification for granting of privileges to laser endoscopists is of utmost importance.\r"

They had a subacute or chronic course with nonspecific symptoms, enlargement of the liver and spleen, and cardiac failure due to destruction of the cusps, without disruption of the valve ring. High-phase I-specific IgG and IgA antibody titers against Coxiella burnetii were found. C. burnetii was isolated in each patient by inoculating suspensions of valve tissue into a human fetal diploid fibroblast cell line, which was grown as monolayers on slides contained inside rubber-stoppered tube cultures. Patients were treated successfully with doxycycline, cotrimoxazole, and valve replacement and were followed up for periods of 24 to 42 months; no evidence of deterioration was found. The human fetal diploid cell culture may be an expeditious, easy, and safe method to isolate C. burnetii from cardiac valves. Valve replacement seemed necessary to cure prosthetic-valve endocarditis due to C. burnetii infection. Combined therapy with doxycycline and cotrimoxazole may control the disease and prevent reinfection of the homografts replacing the valves.\r"

  ".W": "STUDY OBJECTIVE: To compare single-dose and 10-day treatment regimens of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole in women with acute dysuria, urgency, or urinary frequency. DESIGN: Double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial. SETTING: Student health center at a major university. PATIENTS: Consecutive sample of 255 young women including 216 with a bacteriologically documented urinary tract infection. INTERVENTION: Single-dose treatment (trimethoprim, 320 mg and sulfamethoxazole, 1600 mg) given to 116 women and 10-day treatment (trimethoprim, 160 mg and sulfamethoxazole, 800 mg, twice daily) given to 125 women. Women with a history of sulfonamide allergy were given trimethoprim alone: 10 received single-dose treatment (200 mg) and 5 received 10-day treatment (100 mg, twice daily). MEASUREMENTS and MAIN RESULTS: The rates for resolution of symptoms at 3 days, 13 days, and 6 weeks after entry into the study were not significantly different between treatment groups. Among women with urinary tract infections, cumulative crude rates of recurrence in the single-dose and 10-day treatment groups, respectively, were 24% compared with 5% at 13 days after entry (P = 0.0002; 95% confidence interval [CI] for difference in proportions, 10%, 28%) and 32% compared with 21% at 6 weeks after entry (P = 0.07; 95% Cl, -2%, 24%). Factors independently associated with lower cure rates were a history of a urinary tract infection within the previous 6 weeks (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 3.8; 95% Cl, 1.4 to 10.6) and presence of 10(5) bacteria/mL or greater in an initial midstream culture (adjusted OR, 2.9; 95% Cl, 1.2 to 7.0). After controlling for these factors, the risk of failure after single-dose treatment was not statistically significantly different from 10-day treatment at 6 weeks (adjusted OR, 1.6; 95% Cl, 0.8 to 3.2; P = 0.21). Compared to 10-day treatment, single-dose treatment less effectively eradicated Escherichia coli from the vaginal flora (P less than 0.001) and led more often to early same-strain recurrences (P = 0.003). Meaningful adverse effects occurred in 12% of women given single-dose treatment compared with 25% of women receiving 10-day treatment (P = 0.009). CONCLUSIONS: Compared with single-dose treatment, 10-day treatment yields a superior cure rate at 2 weeks after the start of treatment, but by 6 weeks the advantage of longer treatment no longer exists. This effect may be explained by the lesser effectiveness of single-dose treatment in eradicating vaginal E. coli, resulting in more frequent same-strain recurrences within 2 weeks of treatment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

To confirm the association, the latter three patients were rechallenged with quinidine therapy, which caused recurrence of symptoms within 1 week. Antihistone antibodies, which are characteristic of drug-induced lupus erythematosus associated with procainamide and hydralazine therapy, were detected in all patients with quinidine-induced lupus erythematosus. An unusual characteristic of antihistone antibodies seen in two patients was the presence of high levels of IgG antibodies to histone H1 as well as H2A.H2B and H3.H4 complexes, without antibodies to the individual core histones.\r"

On light microscopy, we found groups of neurons accumulated immediately under the pia mater covering the tenia. The number of groups in different specimens varied from one to three, and the groups were rounded or oval in shape. A bundle of fibers running from the main mass of the brain stem toward these groups was revealed with a myelin-staining technique. The majority of neurons in the groups were angular in shape. These findings may contribute to our understanding of the general and surgical anatomy of the cerebellopontine angle.\r"

Microcirculatory parameters were assessed before and after ESES. Bright field microscopy was used to assess capillary diameters and red blood cell (RBC) velocity in the dorsum of the foot. Fluorescein microscopy was used with intravenously injected sodium fluorescein to study capillary density and sodium fluorescein appearance time in the dorsum of the toe. The systolic ankle/arm pressure ratio and toe pressure measurements were used as macrocirculatory parameters. After ESES, clinical improvement was confirmed by intravital microscopy. Capillary density increased (p less than 0.001), RBC velocity in capillaries already perfused before ESES increased from 0.054 mm/sec to 0.762 mm/sec (p less than 0.001), and sodium fluorescein appearance time decreased from 72 to 45 seconds (p less than 0.001). Capillary diameter did not change significantly so that the increase in RBC velocity may be interpreted as enhanced volume flow. Systolic ankle/arm pressure ratios and digital arterial pressure did not change significantly. The current results show that in patients with severe occlusive arterial disease of the lower limbs, ESES recruits capillaries not perfused in the control situation and enhances skin blood flow, improvements that may explain the beneficial clinical effects of ESES.\r"

For the 8 randomly assigned control animals, the air leak decreased over 90 minutes from a mean of 1.4 L/min to a mean of 1.1 L/min (mean decrease, 19.8%). In the 8 randomly assigned fibrin glue-treated animals, the air leak decreased from a mean of 2.1 L/min to a mean of 0.5 L/min (mean decrease, 80.8%) (p less than 0.0001). Postoperative evaluation of survivors disclosed no increased adhesions in the glue-treated animals and complete resorption of the glue at 3 months. We conclude that in this animal model, fibrin glue reduced the size of pulmonary air leaks in the early period after thoracotomy and did not lead to increased intrapleural adhesions.\r"

For aspirin use within the week before the onset of symptoms, the rate ratio estimates, adjusted for potential confounding, were 15 (95% confidence interval, 6.4 to 34) for regular use (at least four days a week) and 5.6 (confidence interval, 2.7 to 12) for occasional use. For aspirin use discontinued at least one week earlier, the estimate was 1.6 (confidence interval, 0.6 to 4.2). There was no evidence that acetaminophen use increased the risk. For the regular use of other analgesics in the week before onset, the adjusted rate ratio estimate was 9.1 (confidence interval, 2.7 to 31); there were insufficient data to evaluate occasional use. The findings suggest that the risk of bleeding is increased substantially by aspirin, even when used occasionally. With the exception of acetaminophen, other nonnarcotic analgesics may also increase the risk, but they remain to be evaluated individually.\r"

Although allograft recipients are at increased risk of infection primarily because of pharmacologic immunosuppression, whether the process of allosensitization per se alters this risk is unknown. We therefore studied the effects of cloned allosensitized murine helper or cytotoxic T cells on both interleukin 1 (IL-1) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production by syngeneic resident murine peritoneal macrophages. Endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide [LPS]) stimulated both IL-1 and PGE2 production in macrophages. Cloned T cells alone, with or without LPS pretreatment, produced neither IL-1 nor PGE2. After 48 hours of coculture with LPS-treated macrophages, cloned helper cells augmented IL-1 release by macrophages but inhibited PGE2 production. In contrast, cytotoxic T cells not only reduced IL-1 production by macrophages but also potentiated PGE2 release. These effects were not observed when macrophages were not first exposed to LPS. Thus, endotoxin renders macrophages more susceptible to allosensitized \"help\" (increases IL-1, decreases PGE2) or \"suppression\" (decreases IL-1, increases PGE2) by cytotoxic T cells. We hypothesize that, even in the absence of immunosuppression, the process of allosensitization itself may modulate the response to sepsis by altering host macrophage function.\r"

Colonic anastomoses were performed in 162 rats randomly assigned to four groups: control animals with or without fibrin sealant applied to the anastomosis and steroid-treated animals with or without fibrin sealant. At five days postoperatively, the use of steroids alone significantly reduced the anastomotic bursting pressure (ABP) and enhanced abscess and adhesion formation. The addition of fibrin sealant to the anastomosis in steroid-treated animals did not improve ABP and, in fact, further increased abscess formation. In control animals, the use of fibrin sealant also reduced ABP and enhanced abscess and adhesion formation. By ten days, there was no difference in ABP among the groups, and the rate of abscess formation was reduced in all groups. These findings indicated that short-term treatment with steroids delayed colonic anastomotic healing. Fibrin sealant did not enhance the integrity of these high-risk anastomoses. The present data do not support the use of fibrin sealant in high-risk colonic anastomoses.\r"

C3H/HEJ mice were transfused with 0.2 mL of fresh allogeneic blood obtained from C57BL/6 mice; they were killed on days 1, 3, and 7 after BT. A second group of C3H/HEJ mice was transfused with 0.2 mL/d of the same allogeneic blood on three successive days; they were killed on day 7 following the last BT. The antigen presentation function of peritoneal macrophages was measured by utilizing a D10.G4.1 T-helper cell clone; IL-2 activity in supernatants of concanavalin A-stimulated splenocytes was tested by utilizing an IL-2-dependent HT-2 cell line. The results indicate that although antigen presentation function remains unaffected after single and multiple BTs, the ability of splenocytes to generate IL-2 decreases significantly even after a single BT. Thus, the increased susceptibility to infection and the additional immune perturbations in malignant neoplasms following BT may be due in part to decreased IL-2 generation.\r"

  ".U": "88133350\r", 
  ".W": "Hydrogen peroxide, a reactive oxygen intermediate produced by activated neutrophils, has been shown to inhibit the response of human T lymphocytes to mitogens and alloantigens. Since hydrogen peroxide is known to react with iron and to induce lipid peroxidation, we compared the effects of hydrogen peroxide and a lipid peroxidation product, malondialdehyde, on the response of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells to T-cell mitogens. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells pretreated with 1 mmol/L of malondialdehyde, washed, and resuspended in fresh medium exhibited no inhibition of phytohemagglutinin responsiveness. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells treated in the same manner but with 200 mumol/L of hydrogen peroxide were inhibited by more than 95%. The addition of ferric edetate did not alter the inhibitory effects of 50 to 100 mumol/L of hydrogen peroxide, nor did the addition of deferoxamine, an iron chelator. These studies suggest that exogenous lipid peroxidation does not affect lymphocyte activation but that hydrogen peroxide has a direct inhibitory effect. Although monocytes are necessary for T-cell mitogenic responses, the effect of hydrogen peroxide was found to be directed at T lymphocytes. Exposure of T cells to a single dose of 200 mumol/L of hydrogen peroxide resulted in more than 71% suppression of the proliferative response measured 48 hours later, but the effect was spontaneously reversed by 72 to 96 hours. Repeated exposure of the cells to hydrogen peroxide resulted in continued inhibition of the proliferative response. These findings suggest that hydrogen peroxide produced by inflammatory phagocytic cells might be capable of suppressing the immune response of nearby T lymphocytes.\r"

Since these lymphocytic responses are interleukin 2 (IL-2)-mediated, we looked for a specific IL-2 inhibitor in wound fluid. We have found that wound fluid blocks the response of thymic lymphocytes and of two cloned T-helper cell lines (D10 and HT2) to exogenous human recombinant IL-2. The wound fluid enhances fibroblast proliferation, thus demonstrating that its proliferative inhibitory activity is specific for lymphocytes. The findings suggest that wound fluid contains a factor that impairs lymphocyte response to IL-2, probably at the receptor or postreceptor level.\r"

  ".W": "The spleen is a potential source for lymphokines, substances known to prime or activate macrophages. Liver macrophages or Kupffer cells are directly exposed to these products via the portal circulation. To determine whether a loss of splenic factors would alter Kupffer cell responses, we studied the effect of splenectomy or sham operation on Kupffer cell responses to endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS). We determined Kupffer cell activation using an in vitro rat hepatocyte-Kupffer cell coculture system in which Kupffer cells normally mediate a significant decrease in hepatocyte protein synthesis if triggered by LPS. We found that Kupffer cells from splenectomized rats were significantly less responsive to LPS three to 60 days after splenectomy. Kupffer cells from sham-operated animals responded normally to LPS. This was contrasted to an increased sensitivity to LPS in the first two days following splenectomy. These data suggest that both splenectomy and a loss of splenic factors alter Kupffer cell responses to septic stimuli. We propose that the decreased sensitivity to LPS after splenectomy may be due to a loss of the priming effects of splenic lymphokines. This decreased responsiveness might contribute to the increased incidence of overwhelming infection after splenectomy.\r"

Single photon emission computed tomography was performed soon after hospital admission, and three to eight hours, 20 to 24 hours, and one week later after the onset of symptoms. Initially reduced rCBF persisting up to three hours was observed in the hemisphere appropriate to the focal neurologic deficit; hyperperfusion was noted later in the same region in these patients. At 24 hours rCBF was normal in four patients, hyperemia persisted in two patients, and one patient was not restudied. The area of interest demonstrated a mean decrease of 19% +/- 7% in side-to-side asymmetry when compared with the contralateral region. In three to eight hours this reversed to a mean increase of 19% +/- 4% (delayed hyperemia). No asymmetries were observed after one week. The late hyperemic asymmetry often persisted beyond the duration of the clinical headache. It is postulated that this tardive regional hyperperfusion is a consequence of previous focal arteriolar vasoconstriction. This vascular sequence of events further delineates the diagnostic merit of studying rCBF by noninvasive single photon emission computed tomography in migraine.\r"

Immunopathological studies of one of their eyes showed that in the area of snowbanking over the pars plana there was mild to moderate inflammatory cell infiltration, consisting of mostly Pan T (Leu 4+) lymphocytes. The ratio of T helper/inducer to T suppressor/cytotoxic cells was approximately 10:1. Few macrophages (OKM1+) were identified. Very few B cells and no NK cells were observed. Some retinal vessels had a perivascular infiltration consisting of mostly T lymphocytes. Most of the inflammatory cells bore class II antigens (HLA-DR+), while T cells bore few IL-2 receptors (anti-TAC+). The snowbank consisted mainly of glial elements (GFAP+) and basement membrane components (type IV collagen and laminin) with the predominant cell the Muller cell (Mu+). A site of inflammation at the iris-ciliary body junction also stained for B cells (Leu 14+). These findings suggest that the snowbank could be formed by the glial elements of the peripheral retina. The chronic inflammation in pars planitis appears to consist of helper T cells, both in the pars plana, and the retinal vasculature.\r"

T-cell number and activity were evaluated by counts of total T-cells and T-lymphocyte subsets, and by measure of DNA synthesis in response to phytohemagglutinin and Concanavalin A. B-cells were evaluated as surface immunoglobulin- (SIg+) bearing cells and by serum immunoglobulin levels. Granulocyte activities were evaluated by responses to chemotaxis and to nitroblue tetrazolium test. Complement activity was measured by classic hemolytic complement assay. In addition, circulating immune complexes were detected in serum. MDS were associated with a significant decrease in the absolute numbers of total T (E-rosetting and T3+) cells, T4+, and T8+ cells and a dramatic decrease of the responses to Concanavalin A. An impairment of either chemotaxis or of nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) test was frequently encountered. An increase in the levels of IgG or IgA was also a frequent feature. The findings reveal that all patients with a high degree of T-cell impairment have refractory anemia associated with an excess of medullary blast cells. All in all, the data suggest that the counts of the absolute number of cells bearing the T3 and T8 phenotypes could be of prognostic value: the higher the number, the better the patient's survival.\r"

Before occlusion, the dogs were injected intravenously with radiolabeled human C1q. Labeled C1q could be detected in the cardiac lymph within minutes following injection. Rabbit antisera, prepared against substances precipitated from postreprefusion cardiac lymph by anti-human C1q, also reacted with specific constituents of isolated cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria. To evaluate whether mitochondria are the source of these C1q-binding proteins, we isolated intramyofibrillar and subsarcolemmal mitochondria from canine heart and incubated sonicates of these with purified C1q, immobilized on nitrocellulose. Molecules bound to the immobilized C1q were removed with 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, fractionated under reducing conditions by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and transferred electrophoretically to nitrocellulose paper. Antisera prepared against postreperfusion lymph reacted with a 31,000-32,000-dalton protein in these nitrocellulose paper replicas. Since this protein originates from mitochondria, binds to C1q, and is recognized by antibodies made against postreperfusion lymph, this protein is likely to be one of the subcellular constituents that, upon release from ischemic cells, activates the complement cascade. To evaluate the clinical relevance of these observations, we tested sera from 53 patients obtained 48-72 hours after hospitalization for suspected myocardial infarction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

However, its late adverse effect manifested by extreme truncal rigidity, decreased chest wall compliance, hypoventilation, respiratory acidosis and hemodynamic instability is not sufficiently appreciated. Of 380 patients who underwent aortocoronary artery bypass under high-dose (100 micrograms/kg) fentanyl anesthesia, 29 (7.6%) developed the sudden onset of extreme thoracic and abdominal rigidity, leading to respiratory depression 2 to 6 h postoperative, after an apparently normal recovery from the anesthesia. In 15 patients, a high plasma level of fentanyl (5.2 to 7.8 ng/ml) correlated with the clinical events. Administration of naloxone or a muscle relaxant rapidly reversed this late complication of fentanyl, thought to be due to re-entry of fentanyl into plasma from deposits in adipose tissue, muscle and the GI tract, leading to a secondary peak in plasma fentanyl. It is more likely to be encountered when hypothermia, rewarming, and acidosis occur in the postoperative period. Awareness of this life-threatening complication is critical in patients undergoing surgery with fentanyl anesthesia.\r"

  ".W": "Alcoholics are at risk to develop hepatitis B infections, chronic active hepatitis, and even hepatoma. Hence, immunization with hepatitis B vaccine is recommended. However, immune abnormalities may coexist which alter their responsiveness to vaccination. This study compares the immune response to this vaccine in controls (group I), alcoholics without overt liver disease (group II), and alcoholics with clinical liver disease (group III). By the seventh month after the initial vaccination, 89% in group I, 70% in group II, and 18% in group III had a response greater than 36 RIA units. The magnitude of the response was significantly different in groups I, II, and III (19,456 vs 8,326 vs 153 RIA units, respectively; P less than 0.05, group I vs III). In those who did not respond, a significant (P less than 0.02) lower helper/inducer (T4) class of lymphocytes was observed as compared to patients who exhibited an adequate response. These observations suggest: (1) that the response to hepatitis B vaccine is a T-cell-dependent event and (2) that in this population, using the existing vaccine, postvaccination evaluations of antibody concentrations are needed before protection against hepatitis B infection can be assumed.\r"

  ".U": "88137110\r", 
  ".W": "Experiments were carried out in castrate adult male rats to further examine whether endogenous opioids are involved in CRF-induced suppression of LH secretion. Serum LH levels in rats castrated 5 days earlier were significantly reduced by intracerebroventricular administration of homologous (rat) CRF (0.02-2 nmol) within 30 min posttreatment; the effects of 0.02 nmol CRF lasted for at least 2 h, whereas those of 0.2 and 2 nmol CRF were evident for up to 6 h. Rats that received sc infusions of the opioid receptor antagonist naloxone (9.6 mg/kg.day) for 48 h before testing with 0.2 nmol CRF showed a significant reduction of the LH response to CRF. Rats that received two acute injections of naloxone (2 mg/kg, iv, 30 min apart) also showed an attenuated response to the LH-suppressive effects of CRF. In another experimental model where the opioidergic control of LH secretion is absent or masked, the long term castrate rat, there was also a marked attenuation of the LH-suppressing effects of CRF. Transient replacement of testosterone in long term castrates reinstated the inhibitory effects of CRF on LH secretion. A third experiment, in which short term castrates were pretreated with an opioid antibody and then with CRF, resulted in a significant reduction of the CRF-induced reduction of serum LH levels. These observations indicate that opioid receptor-mediated events play an important part in the actions of CRF on LH secretion. On the basis of our previous experiments in vitro, we propose that CRF stimulates the release of hypothalamic opioid peptides, which in turn inhibits the activity of LHRH neurons and, thus, LH secretion.\r"

The stimulatory effects of 1,25-(OH)2D3 were observable at a concentration of 10(-10) M and maximal at a concentration of 10(-8) M. On the other hand, 1,25-(OH)2D3 inhibited their expression of the cartilage phenotype, as judged morphologically, histochemically, and biochemically by a decrease in glycosaminoglycan (GAG) synthesis. The inhibition of GAG synthesis was also dose dependent and observable at a concentration of 10(-10) M. 1,25-(OH)2D3 also stimulated the proliferation of resting cartilage cells and inhibited their GAG synthesis, but its effects on these cells were less than those on growth cartilage cells, suggesting that 1,25-(OH)2D3 acts more specifically on growth cartilage cells than on resting cartilage cells. 1,25-(OH)2D3 had no effect on either DNA synthesis or GAG synthesis of growth cartilage cells in confluent cultures. 24R,25-Dihydroxycholecalciferol [24,25-(OH)2D3] had no effect on proliferation, DNA synthesis, or GAG synthesis of growth cartilage cells in the logarithmic growth phase. However, 24,25-(OH)2D3 had no effect on DNA synthesis of these cells in confluent cultures, but stimulated their expression of the cartilage phenotype. The stimulatory effect was dose dependent and maximal at 10(-7) M. Since chondrocytes express their differentiated phenotype as they become confluent in culture, these results suggest that 1,25-(OH)2D3 stimulates the growth of rapidly proliferating chondrocytes with a poorly differentiated phenotype and suppresses their expression of the cartilage phenotype, while 24,25-(OH)2D3 stimulates expression of the differentiated phenotype of highly differentiated chondrocytes.\r"

Two hundred and fifty nine immunoglobulin secreting hybridomas have been obtained from nine patients. The antibodies have been screened for binding to food antigens, sections of human gut, and bacteria including two unidentified acid fast isolates from CD lymph nodes. Autoantibodies, and antibodies to food antigens implicated by others in the aetiology of CD were rare, comprising 1.2%, and 2.5% respectively. Most donors yielded none of these. Thus neither food antigens nor autoantigens are major antigenic stimuli in nodes draining inflammatory bowel disease. On the other hand between 19% and 83% of supernatants from different donors bound to one or more bacterial genus. The mycobacteria and the CD isolates were amongst the genera to which most antibodies bound, though binding to E coli was more frequent. Significantly more CD than UC derived supernatants bound to BCG. As mycobacteria are not though to be part of the normal bowel flora, the high percentage of hybridomas secreting antibodies which bind to this genus is surprising.\r"

No resorption of bone occurred after the opposite knee was injected with a control preparation that did not contain particles.

This segment is a good candidate for T cell epitopes since it has a propensity to form an amphipathic alpha helix. The peptides elicited 10-30% of the response induced by native Torpedo AChR. Different peptides were recognized by the autoreactive T cells of the two patients. These results suggest that the NH2-terminal region of the AChR alpha chain contains T cell-stimulating epitopes, and that the T cell autoimmune response in myasthenia gravis, like the B cell response, is heterogeneous.\r"

Although it has been inferred that the immune deficiency is a consequence of disordered MHC-restricted interactions among otherwise normal cells, the biological capabilities and differentiation of B lymphocytes deficient in class II MHC antigens have not been rigorously analyzed. We have examined the phenotypic and functional attributes of B cells with absent class II MHC antigens. Our data demonstrate that these B cells are intrinsically defective in their responses to membrane-mediated activation stimuli. In addition, virtually all the B cells had phenotypic evidence of arrested differentiation at an immature stage. Finally, these B cells also failed to express the C3d-EBV receptor normally present on all B lymphocytes. These data indicate that class II MHC molecules are vital participants in early events of the B cell activation cascade, and that other non-MHC membrane molecules may also be absent as a consequence of either arrested differentiation or as a result of the basic defect affecting the expression of MHC membrane antigens.\r"

  ".U": "88139777\r", 
  ".W": "The diurnal response of ACTH release to intravenously administered arginine vasopressin was tested in normal volunteers given consecutively moderate doses of vasopressin every 15 min (0.1, 0.3, 1.0, and 3.0 IU) at 2200 h and again at 0700 h (PM/AM). This protocol was repeated 4 wk later with the times reversed (AM/PM). A dose-related increase in ACTH secretion was observed in all subjects. When the AM response of the AM/PM protocol was compared with the PM response of the PM/AM protocol, the release of ACTH was greater in the morning (P less than 0.05) as evaluated by the following criteria: peak value of ACTH (129.9 +/- 30.4 pg/ml in the AM vs. 57.1 +/- 20.2 in the PM); area under the curve (689 in the AM vs. 259 in the PM); and, sensitivity of the ACTH dose-response curve (first significant increase in ACTH with 1 IU of vasopressin in the AM but not significant even after 3 IU in the PM). In addition, when the AM vasopressin testing followed a previous evening stimulation (PM/AM protocol), there was a blunted ACTH response compared with the AM/PM protocol. Corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) is probably the major ACTH secretagogue, but since vasopressin acts synergistically with CRF to produce an augmented release of ACTH, we suggest that the ACTH response to administered vasopressin depends upon the ambient endogenous level of CRF. We interpret our data and published data that CRF produces a lesser release of ACTH in the AM as follows: in the morning endogenous CRF is high and administered CRF produces little further release of ACTH, but administered vasopressin acting synergistically with high endogenous CRF causes a greater release of ACTH; conversely, in the evening endogenous CRF is low and administered CRF causes a greater release of ACTH, but vasopressin (a weak secretagogue by itself) gives a low ACTH response. We conclude that vasopressin stimulation of ACTH secretion can be used as an in vivo bioassay of endogenous CRF, and that there is a diurnal rhythm of CRF in hypophyseal portal blood.\r"

Myeloid colony formation was maximally enhanced by 60 ng/ml IGF-I/Sm-C and by 250 ng/ml hGH, resulting in an increase in colony numbers of 41 +/- 7 and 38 +/- 4%, respectively (P less than 0.001). Both peptides induced a 1.5-2.5-fold increase in the frequency of colonies composed of granulocytes alone, but did not alter the numbers of monocyte/macrophage or mixed granulocyte/macrophage colonies. IGF-I/Sm-C and hGH were also found to enhance myeloid maturation towards mature granulocytes in suspension cultures of human marrow cells. The effect of both peptides on human marrow granulopoiesis was similarly demonstrable in serum-free cultures stimulated with human recombinant granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor. Enhancement of human marrow granulopoiesis in vitro by hGH required the presence of marrow adherent cells and was abrogated by specific monoclonal antibodies directed against IGF-I/Sm-C receptors. The effect of hGH on marrow myeloid progenitors thus appears to be mediated by paracrine IGF-I/Sm-C.\r"

According to a previous hypothesis, MG is initiated within the thymus by immunogenic presentation of locally produced nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR) to potentially autoimmune T cells. Data of 10 consecutive MG patients demonstrate two critical features of MG thymuses that support the concept of intrathymic activation of autoreactive, AChR-specific lymphocytes. Morphologically, the thymuses showed lympho-follicular hyperplasia in nine cases and benign thymoma in one case. The paramount feature revealed by immunohistological double marker analyses was the intimate association of myoid cells (antigen producing) with interdigitating reticulum cells (potentially antigen presenting cells), both of which were surrounded by T3+ lymphocytes in thymus medulla. All 10 thymuses contained T lymphocytes reactive with AChR. This was in contrast to the peripheral immune compartment (blood) where in only 3 of 10 patients, significant T cell responses to AChR were observed. AChR-specific T cell lines could be established from 8 of 10 thymuses, all members of the helper/inducer subset as indicated by the expression of markers T3 and T4.\r"

  ".W": "Using histochemical and immunocytochemical techniques, a lectin with nominal specificity for alpha-linked N-acetyl-D-galactosamine, Dolichos biflorus agglutinin (DBA), was found to preferentially label thymocytes with an L3T4-, Lyt-2- phenotype from fetal/newborn and adult mice. Through days 14 to 16 of gestation, virtually all thymocytes bound DBA, followed by a dramatic reduction of DBA labeling during the last 4 days of gestation, reaching adult levels of about 2 to 4% of total thymocytes. At later stages of fetal development, the DBA+ cells were confined to the subcapsular area of the thymus. This apparent loss of DBA+ cells was caused by an expansion of the thymocyte population not labeled with this lectin. Affinity purification of thymocyte cell surface components with insolubilized DBA indicated that virtually all of the lectin binding to fetal thymocytes was mediated by a 120-kDa glycoprotein. In addition to thymocytes, DBA also labeled about 5% of bone marrow cells from both normal or nude mice and a small population of spleen cells as well. These results suggest that this lectin may be useful to positively select for LT34-, Lyt-2- thymocytes, and, possibly, other immature populations within the T cell lineage.\r"

  ".W": "The mAb Tm 1 was obtained from a fusion of SP2/O tumor cells with spleen cells from CF1 mouse immunized with T cells modulated by an IgM anti-CD3 mAb.mAb Tm 1 reacted with IgM anti-CD3 modulated T cells (66.6%) but not with unmodulated T cells (4.4%). Tm 1 was not expressed on T cells modulated with either IgG2a or IgG1 anti-CD3 mAb. Immunoprecipitation from 125I-labeled CD3-modulated T cells showed that Tm 1 Ag is a single polypeptide of 33 kDa under reducing and nonreducing conditions. Kinetic studies revealed that Tm 1 was detectable on T cells 10 min after incubation and maximally expressed after 4 h of incubation with IgM anti-CD3 mAb. CD3 expression was markedly modulated by this anti-CD3 mAb after the same period of incubation. Studies with cycloheximide revealed that Tm 1 expression on T cells does not require new protein synthesis. Tm 1 expression persisted long after CD3-reexpression 24 h later. Tm 1 was present on a small fraction of circulating T cells, B cells, and monocytes and absent from granulocytes, platelets, E, and thymocytes. Tm 1 was not expressed on T cells after various activation stimuli but was expressed on B cells upon activation. Additional studies indicate that IgM mAb against other T cell differentiation Ag and IgM mAb against B cell Ag also lead to the expression of Tm 1 on these cells. Thus, modulation of surface Ag by IgM mAb externalizes this cytoplasmic Ag. However, one exception has been noted. Purified mAb Tm 1 was not mitogenic and was unable to block either the T cell proliferation induced by 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate plus anti-CD3 mAb and other T cell stimuli, or the B cell proliferation induced by B cell mitogens. The role of Tm 1 on lymphocyte function remains to be determined.\r"

Within the lymphoid lineage, mAb HK1.4 bound exclusively to CTL, regardless of the expression of Lyt-2 or MHC restriction. HK1.4 mAb also bound to 40% of bone marrow cells and less than 5% of thymocytes from all mouse strains tested. Based on the tissue distribution of the determinant with which it reacted and the ability to cross-block binding of the anti-Ly-6 mAb H9/25, mAb HK1.4 appeared to react with a product of the Ly-6 locus. However, significant differences were observed between the properties of mAb HK1.4 and other, previously described anti-Ly-6 mAb. Cell proliferation and lymphokine release by cloned CTL were stimulated by culture with mAb HK1.4 alone or in the presence of non-stimulatory levels of IL-2. This proliferation and lymphokine release were not blocked by the addition of soluble anti-Lyt-2 or anti-IL-2R mAb. Activation induced by HK1.4 mAb proceeds in the absence of accessory cells, of cross-linking of the TCR, or the addition of mitogens or PMA. Stimulation of cells by anti-TCR mAb was not blocked by the addition of soluble HK1.4 mAb, and the stimulatory effects of HK1.4 and anti-TCR mAb were not additive. However, IL-2-driven proliferation of CTL clones was dramatically inhibited by the addition of HK1.4 mAb.HK1.4 mAb had no effect on Ag-specific or lectin-facilitated cytolysis. Taken together, these data indicate that mAb HK1.4 operates via an IL-2-independent pathway of activation that is also independent of the TCR.\r"

  ".W": "Normal resting T cells were stimulated through the alternate CD2 pathway. A CD3 mAb VIT3 completely blocked their proliferative response. The time interval for 50% inhibition lasted for 24 h after the onset of CD2 stimulation. Mitogen-activated cloned long term cultured T cells could also be stimulated via CD2. This proliferative response was again inhibitable by VIT3, indicating that CD3 regulates the CD2 pathway not only in resting cells, but also in lymphocytes actively involved in an Ir. T cells were further loaded with Quin2 and their free cytoplasmic Ca2+ levels were monitored in response to CD3 and CD2 stimulation. Antibodies directed against both surface R triggered a rapid elevation of Ca2+ levels. Both responses were abrogated when the cells had been treated overnight with VIT3. The free cytoplasmic Ca2+ levels of VIT3-pretreated cells, however, were not higher than those of control cells. These results point to a functional interaction between CD3 and CD2 possibly at the level of signal transducing proteins. Finally, cholera toxin was found to inhibit the Ca2+ response in Jurkat T cells. Both the CD3 and CD2 stimulation were sensitive to cholera toxin, indicating that a GTP-binding protein may be involved in signal transduction for both surface structures.\r"

  ".W": "Thymocytes that bear neither Lyt-2 nor L3T4 differentiation Ag (2-4- thymocytes) contain the precursors of mature Lyt-2+ and L3T4+ T cells. In the present study, we have identified four major subpopulations of 2-4- cells in adult C57BL/6 mice that differ in surface phenotype and in situ proliferative status. Two-color immunofluorescence analysis with RL-73 (a mAb recognizing an as yet unidentified activation Ag) and PC-61 (an anti-IL-2R mAb) revealed three distinct subsets of 2-4-thymocytes: RL-73+ IL-2R- (30%), RL-73+/-IL-2R+ (45%), and RL-73- IL-2R- (25%). The RL-73+ IL-2R- subset had the highest percentage of large blasts and cycling cells, whereas the RL-73+/- IL-2R+ and RL-73- IL-2R- subsets had intermediate and low percentages, respectively, indicating that in situ proliferation correlated better with RL-73 intensity than with IL-2R expression. An additional marker, heat-stable Ag (HSA), was found to further subdivide the RL-73- population into RL-73- HSA- (10% of total 2-4-) and RL-73- HSA+ (15%) fractions. The two latter (RL-73-) subsets appeared to be more \"mature\" than the former since they expressed high levels of Lyt-1 and appeared later during fetal thymus ontogeny. In parallel with the phenotypic analysis, we compared the in vitro activation requirements of each of the four purified 2-4- subsets. All four populations proliferated well to the combination of phorbol ester (PMA), ionomycin, and IL-2. In response to PMA and ionomycin (without added IL-2), only RL-73- HSA-cells proliferated and this proliferation was correlated with IL-2 production. However, if IL-1 was included with PMA and ionomycin then all four populations responded. Finally, a proliferative response to Con A or mitogenic anti-Thy-1 mAb was observed only for RL-73- HSA+ and (to a lesser extent) RL-73- HSA-cells. These data indicate that each of the four phenotypically distinct subpopulations of immature thymocytes can also be distinguished on the basis of their in vitro activation requirements.\r"

  ".W": "Previous models of human T cell proliferation have assumed IL-2 to be largely responsible for the clonal expansion observed after TCR complex (CD3/Ti)-mediated stimulation. By using mAb to the CD3 component of CD3/Ti as well as mAb to other nonpolymorphic T cell surface molecules, we demonstrate T cell proliferation in the absence of detectable IL-2 and define some of the conditions necessary for IL-2 production in vitro. PBL cultured with soluble OKT3 alone or OKT3 plus PMA proliferated nearly equally, but IL-2 was detectable only in the supernatants in the latter condition. RNA blot analyses at 8, 16, and 36 h consistently showed high levels of IL-2 transcripts in the OKT3 + PMA stimulated cells. In contrast, when stimulated with OKT3 alone IL-2 transcripts were barely detectable at the 8-h time point only. Anti-Tac only partially inhibited proliferation induced by either OKT3 or OKT3 + PMA, but consistently prevented it when PBL were stimulated by PMA plus exogenous human rIL-2. Cyclosporin A (CsA) was added in varying doses to PBL cultured in the presence of OKT3 + PMA. At 0.05 microgram/ml, proliferation was only partially inhibited, whereas IL-2 was undetectable. To examine the possibility that IL-4 could account for the observed proliferative response, CsA was added to PBL cultured with either OKT3 alone or OKT3 and PMA. Although IL-4 transcript levels were detectable in the presence of OKT3 alone or OKT3 + PMA, CsA at 0.05 microgram/ml allowed proliferation to occur in the absence of detectable IL-2 as well as IL-2 and IL-4 transcripts. Finally, T cell-enriched PBL were shown to proliferate and also to produce substantial quantities of IL-2 in response to immobilized OKT3 + either OKT11 or 9.3. These results strongly suggest the existence of an IL-2 and IL-4 independent pathway of human T cell proliferation and demonstrate that IL-2 production may result only when a closely defined set of stimuli are present.\r"

In contrast to most protein Ag, fibrinogen (Mr 340,000) did not need to be processed by an APC, inasmuch as intact fibrinogen was presented by both pre-fixed and chloroquine-treated macrophages. Through the use of a variety of protease inhibitors, no involvement of proteases either on the macrophage surface or in the culture medium in the presentation of fibrinogen was observed. The epitope recognized by two T cell hybridomas was localized to the peptide, A alpha (551-578), which was located on the carboxy portion of the A alpha-chain. This portion of the A alpha-chain has no defined secondary structure and must possess the conformational flexibility which allows it to directly associate with an I-Ek molecule. Thus conformational flexibility may be a major factor in determining the processing requirements of a protein Ag.\r"

We evaluated the processing requirement of this compact peptide by accessory cells for presentation to apamin-reactive T hybridoma cells (THC) by analyzing the IL-2 responses of 16 THC from apamin-primed BALB/c or C57BL/6 mice, to various forms of either native or chemically synthesized apamin analogs. These included: unfolded peptides (whose four sulfhydryl groups were blocked by acetamidomethyl residues), N-and/or C-truncated peptides, and an analog with a single amino acid substitution at position 10. Assessment of the Ag-specific THC responses in the presence of either live or formaldehyde-prefixed APC indicated the following: 1) all THC stringently required Ag processing; 2) in 8 of 16 cases, the simple unfolding of apamin was sufficient to eliminate the need for Ag processing, or even induced increased THC IL-2 responses (other cells required further antigenic alterations in addition to unfolding, or rare processing steps dependent on the integrity of the two disulfide bonds); and 3) for most THC, the Leu10 and the N terminus arm of apamin were shown to be critical for expression of the epitopes involved in T cell recognition. These data indicate that apamin, a natural peptide having an appropriate size for T cell triggering, acquires its antigenic conformation after a processing by APC which primarily involves an alteration of a disulfide bond-dependent peptide folding.\r"

One of these epitopes is clearly on the V beta 8 region, as it is defined by the antibodies KJ-16 and F23.1, known to react with the V beta 8 family of variable regions, and a functional rearranged V beta 8 gene has been cloned from this cell line. Antibodies directed at a second epitope, believed to be on V alpha because it is unaffected by anti-V beta antibodies, are completely inhibited from binding by monoclonal anti-CD3 epsilon-chain antibodies. Because the cloned Th cell line used, D10.G4.1, responds to soluble monoclonal anti-TCR antibodies, it has been possible to compare the binding of anti-R antibodies with their ability to activate this cloned T cell line. We find that for antibodies all specific for the same or a closely related epitope, activation is proportional to binding, by using antibodies that differ by greater than 100-fold in avidity for the R. By contrast, antibodies directed at different epitopes on the R differ markedly in their ability to activate the D10.G4.1 cell line. We have tested whether these differences reflect differences in the orientation of cross-linking the TCR or possible conformational changes induced in the R by the antibodies, and our data support the latter hypothesis as an explanation for the differences in activation potency between antibodies.\r"

  ".W": "To examine which cell surface molecules can operate as transducers of activation signals to early fetal thymocytes, we analyzed the ability of mAb to CD3 and Thy-1 to induce fetal thymocyte activation. Both proliferation and lymphokine secretion were used as measures of activation. We show that anti-CD3 antibodies induce activation of fetal thymocytes as early as day 13 of fetal thymus development, 2 days before CD3 can be detected by flow cytometry. In addition, an alternative activation signal can be delivered to fetal thymocytes through the Thy-1 molecule as early as it is expressed, i.e., day 13. Both CD3- and Thy-1-mediated activation of day 15 fetal thymocytes results in expansion of cells expressing a CD3-gamma delta receptor complex; no CD3-alpha beta receptor complex could be detected. IL-2 production induced by CD3- and Thy-1-induced activation of fetal thymocytes is evident at the 13th day of gestation. Finally, an additional lymphokine B cell stimulatory factor-1 (BSF-1)/IL-4 (so far known only to be produced by mature CD3- cells), is also produced by fetal thymocytes. The results demonstrate that at least two cell surface molecules, Thy-1 and CD3, can function as pathways of activation in fetal thymocytes, and that at least two lymphokines, IL-2 and BSF-1/IL-4, are produced upon activation. These findings may well reflect a role for the early appearance of CD3- cells in thymus ontogeny.\r"

IL-2 also synergized with PMA in such differentiation but was less effective than BSF-1. The combination of these two lymphokines with PMA had the most potent effect on the development of CTL. BSF-1 plus PMA stimulated a significant increase in the intracellular content of N-benzyloxycarbonyl-L-lysine thiobenzylester esterase, a granule-associated biochemical marker, whereas IL-2 plus PMA was only marginally effective. Depletion of L3T4+ cells did not result in the abrogation of these effects. Lyt-2+ T cells that were incubated for 72 h with BSF-1 plus PMA accumulated N-benzyloxycarbonyl-L-lysine thiobenzylester esterase and secreted this intragranular marker after interaction with immobilized anti-T cell receptor mAb. These BSF-1/PMA-stimulated Lyt-2+, L3T4- T cells were also able to kill FcR positive target cells in a retargeting assay with a mAb to murine T3 Ag, providing evidence that BSF-1 plus PMA acted directly on precursors of cytotoxic T cells.\r"

PMN factor was purified by large sequential scale steps, using membrane-type ion exchangers and gel filtration, followed in this order by HPLC steps with cationic ion exchangers and a hydroxylapatite column. Homogeneity was manifested based on the criteria of a single m.w. 18, 500 band on silver-stained polyacrylamide gel, a superimposable activity on a UV absorbance peak in analytic HPLC gel filtration, and detection of a single amino-terminal sequence. The homogeneous PMN factor had an isoelectric value of 7.2 and an activity of 1.9 x 10(7) U/mg in the thymocyte comitogenic assay. PMN factor stimulated one-half of the maximal response of thymocyte proliferation at 2.8 x 10(-12) M.

  ".W": "A method has been developed to measure the production by single activated T lymphocytes of two hemopoietic growth factors, granulocyte-macrophage CSF (GM-CSF) and multipotential CSF (multi-CSF or IL-3). When individual cells of the L3T4 (CD4)+ F23.1+ T cell clone E9.D4 were transferred by micromanipulation into wells coated with the monoclonal anti-T cell receptor antibody F23.1, up to 90% of cells produced CSF as detected by CSF-dependent hemopoietic cell lines. Production occurred in the absence of proliferation and did not require the addition of accessory cells or IL-2. Both the frequency of CSF-producing cells and the average production per positive cell depended on the density of the immobilized stimulating ligand, indicating that the response of each cell is not an all-or-none phenomenon but varies with the strength of stimulation. Individual cells of the clone varied over a 100-fold range in their total CSF titer with a mean value of about 0.05 U/cell. They also varied in their relative production of GM-CSF and multi-CSF. Thus, low producing cells secreted only GM-CSF whereas high producing cells also secreted multi-CSF. The failure of low producing cells to secrete multi-CSF was not genetically based since such cells could give rise to progeny that synthesized multi-CSF. These results suggest that the synthesis of these two lymphokines can be differentially regulated at the level of the single cell.\r"

  ".W": "We previously cloned cDNA for a T cell-replacing factor (TRF) that has been defined as a T cell-derived lymphokine that acts on activated B cells as a B cell growth and differentiation factor. Based on the diverse activities of rTRF on different target cells, we proposed that TRF be called IL-5. In this study, the molecular characteristics of TRF/IL-5 prepared by rDNA technology and TRF/IL-5 mRNA expression in various T cell lines and normal T cells have been studied. Specific immunoassay showed that rTRF/IL-5, which is transiently translated in vitro by rabbit reticulocyte lysate, has an apparent m.w. of 14,000. By contrast, active forms of rTRF/IL-5 translated in Xenopus oocytes has an apparent m.w. of 45,000 to 50,000 in the nonreducing condition and migrates to the m.w. of 25,000 to 30,000 under the reducing condition, indicating that active form of rTRF/IL-5 consists of dimer forms. The rTRF/IL-5 does not show detectable levels of IL-2, IL-3, and B-cell stimulatory factor 1 (IL-4) activities. Northern blot hybridization of poly (A)+ RNA from constitutively TRF-producing B151K12 T cell hybridoma revealed a single 1.7-kb band hybridizing to the cloned murine TRF/IL-5 cDNA. The expression of TRF/IL-5 mRNA in B151K12 was augmented by the stimulation with PMA plus calcium ionophore. In contrast, neither thymoma BW5147 nor IL-2-producing T cell hybridoma A55, both of which produced an undetectable level of TRF, expressed detectable levels of TRF/IL-5 mRNA. Stimulation of EL 4 and D9 cells with PMA and Con A, respectively, induced an increase in the levels of TRF/IL-5 mRNA expression accompanied by TRF/IL-5 production, whereas both cell lines did not show significant gene expression in the absence of the stimulation. In spleen cells from Mycobacterium tuberculosis-primed mice, significant expression of TRF/IL-5 mRNA was detected only when the cells were stimulated with relevant Ag, PPD. Normal spleen cells stimulated with Con A showed a significant, but approximately four-fold less expression of TRF/IL-5 mRNA. Molecular and functional properties of TRF/IL-5 will be discussed.\r"

The amino acid sequence recognized by the two mAb was determined by using synthetic peptide segments of IL-3. In both cases binding of the mAb to synthetic IL-3 was inhibited best with a hexapeptide corresponding to the amino acid residues 130-135 of IL-3, although the mAb differed in other characteristics. Neither mAb neutralized IL-3 bioactivity in vitro.

The generation of total inositol phosphates was stimulated by treatment with cytochalasin D, as was the generation of inositol trisphosphate. The cytochalasin-induced increase in inositol phosphates appeared to depend on interaction with actin, and it was inhibited by phorbol esters. Inositol phosphate production was not stimulated in splenic T lymphocytes. The results suggest that the previously observed increase in intracellular calcium produced by cytochalasin is part of a more generalized signaling event that includes phosphoinositide turnover, and, further, raise the possibility of a functional association between actin and phospholipase C.\r"

In addition, a derivative of this protein with 65 amino acids deleted from the N-terminal end of HA2 can also generate H1 subtype-specific CTL in bulk cultures. CTL clones established by stimulation with the derivative protein demonstrated cross-reactive lysis of target cells infected with virus strains of the H1 and H2 subtypes. Cold target competition experiments with CTL clones as effectors demonstrated that the Ag specificity between these two hybrid proteins is identical. Adoptive transfer of the CTL clone significantly reduced virus titers in the lungs of mice infected with the virus strains of the H1 or H2 subtype but not those infected with the H3 subtype virus in vivo, which reflects the in vitro CTL clone activity. These experiments demonstrate that an epitope on the hemagglutinin that is conserved on virus strains of the H1 and H2 subtypes induces a protective CTL response. These results suggest an alternative approach for developing influenza vaccines by using conserved antigenic sites on the hemagglutinin HA2 subunit to avoid the problem of frequent antigenic mutations of the HA1 subunit antibody binding sites.\r"

  ".W": "Viruses that cause in vivo persistent infections need to selectively compromise the host's immunologic surveillance machinery in order to survive. To understand the molecular basis of how this is accomplished we have analyzed persistent virus infection by lymphocytic choriomeningitis in its normal host, the mouse. Earlier we noted by infectious center analysis that five in 10(4) lymphocytes carried by persistently infected mice contained infectious materials throughout the course of infection. A previous publication extended these results, in BALB mice by showing that the L3T4+ lymphocyte subset in lymph nodes and spleens was predominantly involved. Using cDNA labeled probes to the viral genome and in situ hybridization we report that 1 to 2% of circulating lymphocytes from several mouse strains contain viral RNA sequences for the three viral structural genes. By FACS analysis, the Thy-1.2+, L3T4+ subset primarily harbors virus while viral sequences are usually not detected in the Lyt-2+ subset as early as 6 days after initiating infection in newborns and throughout the course of the persistence. These findings suggest that incomplete, presumably defective, virus is generated in a subset of Th lymphocytes during persistent infection and that during this time infection of cytotoxic T cell subsets is minimal.\r"

  ".W": "In order to characterize the mouse homologue of the CD2 molecule, which has not yet been identified by immunologic means, cDNA clones putatively encoding mouse CD2 have been isolated by cross-hybridization with a cDNA probe for rat CD2. The predicted amino acid sequence of the putative mouse CD2 protein is consistent with that of a transmembrane glycoprotein, i.e., it consists of an N-terminal region of 186 amino acids bearing six potential N-glycosylation sites, a hydrophobic transmembrane segment of 25 residues, and a large cytoplasmic region of 116 amino acids rich in proline and basic residues. Comparison with the human and rat CD2 sequences clearly indicated the predicted mouse protein to be the mouse equivalent. Striking evolutionary conservations between mouse, rat, and human CD2 were found in their cytoplasmic region, suggesting a functional consequence of that segment for the physiologic role of CD2, such as signal transduction. RNA blot hybridization analysis demonstrated the expression of CD2 in T lymphocytes and in the NK cell lineage in mice. These data strongly suggest that the putative mouse CD2 molecule may perform some biologic functions in mouse T lymphocytes and NK cells as documented in humans.\r"

  ".W": "This study was designed to isolate and phenotypically characterize lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells generated in vivo during administration of high dose rIL-2 to cancer patients. The development of circulating LAK effector cells in these patients was demonstrated by the ability of fresh PBL to exhibit lytic activity against the NK-resistant Daudi cell line and fresh tumor cells without prior in vitro culture with rIL-2. Kinetic studies demonstrated that circulating LAK effector cells are detectable 4 to 6 wk after the initiation of rIL-2 therapy. Cells isolated by FACS revealed that circulating LAK cells are Leu-19+, Leu-17+ but CD5-. We have previously reported that circulating Leu-19+ cells are heterogeneous with regard to the expression of CD16 and CD8. Since sorting of cells expressing Leu-19 and either low quantities of CD8 or CD16 resulted in cytolytic activity in both the positive and negative fractions, these latter two markers do not identify subpopulations of Leu-19+ cells with or without LAK cytolytic activity. Although all LAK cells generated in vivo were Leu-19+, we generated LAK cells from the Leu-19- subpopulation after in vitro culture with rIL-2, suggesting that at least some of in vitro generated LAK cells are derived from Leu-19- precursor cells. These LAK cells did not, however, express the Leu-19 surface marker. Based on the functional data reported in this paper, we conclude that circulating LAK effector cells are a phenotypically heterogeneous population that express surface Ag in association with NK cells and not T lymphocytes.\r"

Monocytes activated by TNF kill only TNF-sensitive tumor targets, whereas those activated by IFN and IL-2 can lyse both TNF-sensitive and TNF-resistant tumor targets. Monocyte cytotoxicity against TNF-sensitive lines induced by the IFN, IL-2, or TNF can be completely abrogated by the addition of anti-TNF antibodies. In contrast, anti-TNF antibodies have no effect on IFN- or IL-2-induced monocyte cytotoxicity against TNF resistant targets, confirming non-TNF-mediated lysis induced by lymphokine-activated monocytes. Neither induction of TNF receptors by IFN-gamma nor inhibition of RNA synthesis by actinomycin D increased the susceptibility of TNF-resistant tumor targets to TNF-mediated monocyte cytotoxicity. Thus, non-TNF-mediated modes of monocyte cytotoxicity are induced by IFN and IL-2, but not by TNF, indicating that different cytotoxic mechanisms are responsible for the lysis of TNF-sensitive and TNF-resistant tumor cells. In addition, these findings also suggest that TNF-sensitive lines are susceptible only to TNF-mediated killing and apparently insensitive to non-TNF-mediated monocyte cytotoxicity.\r"

Plasmid DNA was obtained from a Rob-producing isolate, F990, and a plasmid (pBR322) known to encode TEM-1. Both plasmids were labeled with 32P and hybridized to whole cell DNA obtained from the clinical isolates. All 161 isolates hybridized with one of the plasmid probes and could be classified as TEM-1- or Rob-producing isolates. Analysis of the distinctive pH profiles of the two beta-lactamases was used to confirm the findings of the DNA hybridization assay. Overall, 13 (8%) isolates obtained from patients in California, North Carolina, Tennessee, Missouri, Louisiana, and Mississippi produced the Rob beta-lactamase. The remaining isolates elaborated the TEM-1 enzyme. We conclude that ampicillin resistance in H. influenzae may be mediated by the production of Rob beta-lactamase and that the occurrence of this enzyme is not limited to the two isolates described to date.\r"

The latter two produced mostly larger bands, whereas HindIII produced smaller bands, which allowed clearer comparisons between isolates. The isolates from 69 Australian subjects and one from England each had a unique profile. Isolates from a husband and wife were different, as were those from a brother and sister. In pairs of isolates from 11 individuals, the second isolate was markedly different in six subjects. The profile changes were not associated with changes in antibiotic susceptibility or with loss of catalase or urease activity, which can occur during storage of C. pylori. These restriction endonuclease profiles suggest considerable subspecies variation in C. pylori. Plasmid bands were found in undigested DNA from 40 of the 84 C. pylori isolates.\r"

Experiments using vaccinia virus recombinants and Jurkat cells transfected with the transactivating (tat) gene of HIV-1 suggest that this enhancement is not mediated primarily by the tat protein. In addition, coinfection of H9 cells or a monocyte cell line with CMV and HIV-1 results in enhanced HIV-1 replication, as measured in a virus-yield assay or by radioimmunoassay for the p24 antigen of HIV-1. The interactions between HIV-1 and CMV are thus bidirectional.\r"

These observations suggest that both specific dysregulation of the immune response to the parasite antigen, as well as nonspecific immune activation, accounts for the clinically apparent hyperresponsive state seen in expatriates acquiring loiasis.\r"

  ".W": "Mononuclear cells infiltrating human brain tumors were isolated from seven of nine surgical biopsy specimens. These cells were small T11+, T3+ lymphocytes that did not express DR antigens or the receptor for interleukin-2. In addition, large granular lymphocytes were recovered from two of these tumors. The clonogenic potential of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL's) was assessed by limiting-dilution analysis (LDA) using a microculture system that permits proliferation of virtually 100% of normal peripheral blood T lymphocytes (PBL-T's). In comparison to normal and autologous PBL-T's, TIL's had a strikingly reduced proliferative potential revealed by a decrease in the frequency of proliferating T lymphocyte precursors calculated by LDA. On average, only one of every 100 T cells from TIL's was able to proliferate, as compared to one of every two or all of the T cells from the patient's peripheral blood or from normal donors. Furthermore, the TIL populations showed depressed proliferative responses to the lectins phytohemagglutinin and concanavalin A and to the phorbol ester 12-0-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate. Clonal analysis performed on the proliferating microcultures from three tumors demonstrated that the majority of these clones possessed cytolytic activity against various tumor cell targets. Among clones tested for cytolytic activities with glioma cells, four lysed cultured autologous tumor cells, and the specific lysis was greater than 50% in all cases. Numerous clones with natural killer (NK)-like activity were obtained from two TIL preparations, and the frequency of cytolytic T lymphocyte precursors with NK-like activity was determined for one of these preparations and was found to be higher than that in the patient's peripheral blood. Glioma cells grown in culture and then mixed with normal peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL's) were capable of inhibiting the PBL's response to lectins. This inhibitory property may account in part for the observed poor clonogenicity of TIL's from brain tumors. Nevertheless, nearly all proliferating clones displayed cytotoxicity against either autologous or allogeneic tumor cell targets and may imply selective accumulation of cytolytic effector cells at the tumor site.\r"

A broad definition of myocardial infarction incorporating electrocardiographic and clinical criteria was used to include as many new infarctions as possible. Patients were stratified by left ventricular wall motion score and number of proximal coronary artery stenoses; after adjustment for these variables, 86% of surgical and 73% of medical patients were free of new myocardial infarction at 6 years (p less than 0.0001). This advantage of surgical treatment was observed in subgroups of patients with at least one proximal 70% (or greater) stenosis in the left anterior descending coronary artery and moderate or severe impairment of left ventricular function, as well as those patients with two proximal coronary artery narrowings. In a multivariate (Cox) analysis of preoperative clinical, hemodynamic, and angiographic factors, early operation was the strongest predictor of freedom from new myocardial infarction.\r"

Cox proportional hazard analyses were used to identify determinants of late risk. Patient-related variables associated with decreased late survival rates included advanced age, cardiothoracic ratio 50% or greater, and preoperative New York Heart Association class III or IV symptoms. Moderate or severe impairment of left ventricular function as determined by angiography and advanced age were variables that decreased late event-free survival rates. Patients with bioprostheses had better survival rates (p less than 0.001) and event-free survival rates (p = 0.012) than did patients with mechanical valves. Analyses of subgroups according to the type of valve and postoperative anticoagulant management showed that both survival and event-free survival rates were decreased for patients with mechanical valves who were not taking warfarin and were enhanced for patients with bioprostheses who were not taking warfarin.\r"

Twenty-three patients, 7 women and 16 men with a mean age of 28 yr, were randomized into two groups: an experimental group (13 patients) and a control group (10 patients). Post-operatively, the patients were immobilized for 3 wk in a full leg cast with the knee flexed at an angle of 20 degrees to 30 degrees and then in a knee cast for another 3 wk. All patients had a standard program with quadriceps muscle contractions. In addition, the experimental group received electrical stimulation of the quadriceps muscle 4 X 10 min, 3 times.wk-1, at a frequency of 30 Hz. During each stimulation, the patients were requested to contract the quadriceps muscle voluntarily as well. When pre-operative measurements were compared with those at the end of the immobilization period (6 wk after the operation), a significantly larger reduction in the knee extension isometric muscle strength was found for the control group than for the experimental group. In comparisons of the data of the male subjects only, this difference was still seen to be significant. The cross-sectional area of the quadriceps muscle measured with computed tomography was significantly less reduced during the immobilization period in the experimental group than in the control group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

These two enzymes consist of approximately 36 subunits, eight of which are encoded by mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). The increased incidence of maternal, as opposed to paternal, transmission in familial mitochondrial myopathy suggests that these disorders may be caused by mutations of mtDNA. Multiple restriction endonuclease analysis of leukocyte mtDNA from patients with the disease, and their relatives, showed no differences in cleavage patterns between affected and unaffected individuals in any single maternal line. When muscle mtDNA was studied, nine of 25 patients were found to have two populations of muscle mtDNA, one of which had deletions of up to 7 kilobases in length. These observations demonstrate that mtDNA heteroplasmy can occur in man and that human disease may be associated with defects of the mitochondrial genome.\r"

The virus is harboured for life in all previously infected individuals and is apparently controlled by a population of EBV-specific memory T lymphocytes, specifically activated to recognize the functionally defined lymphocyte-detected membrane antigen. Two types (A and B) of EBV have been identified that show DNA sequence divergence within the BamH1 WYH region of the genome encoding the transformation-associated antigen, Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen 2 (EBNA 2) (ref. 4). To define the function of EBNA 2 in T-cell recognition, we have compared the ability of EBV-specific cytotoxic T-cell clones to distinguish between autologous B lymphocytes transformed by A- or B-type virus. We have now isolated both CD4 and CD8 cytotoxic T-cell clones that recognize autologous A-type but not B-type transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines, thus providing the first evidence that EBV-specific T-cell recognition can be mediated by EBNA 2. As this antigen is not expressed in Burkitt's lymphoma, this finding explains the failure of EBV-specific T-cell surveillance to eliminate the tumour.\r"

Forty-two percent of the patients recovered 20/400 or better acuity (3 of 5 postoperative cases, 4 of 6 trauma cases, and 1 of 4 keratitis cases).

  ".W": "A 5-month-old white girl having persistent oral candidiasis was brought to medical attention because of acute respiratory distress, pneumonia, and hypoxia that worsened despite supportive care and antibiotics. Bronchial lavage fluid yielded Pneumocystis carinii. The diagnosis of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) was suspected, although enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and Western blot tests were both negative for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody. Immunologic evaluation included the following results: a low normal CD4/CD8 ratio 0.88, CD4 lymphocytes 493/microL, and elevated IgA 539 mg/dL and IgM 175 mg/dL with normal IgG 492 mg/dL. Lymphocyte stimulation study results were depressed. Lymphocytes sent for culture were subsequently positive for HIV. The mother was HIV antibody positive by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blot but belonged to no high-risk group and was asymptomatic except for chronic diarrhea. The father was HIV antibody negative. The patient was treated with pentamidine and IV gamma-globulin with good clinical response and a rapid decrease of IgM and IgA toward normal values. Subsequent candidal pneumonia and candidal esophagitis were treated successfully with amphotericin B. The patient has received prophylactic IV gamma-globulin infusions for 6 months and remains HIV negative by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blot. This case of pediatric AIDS highlights the need to consider HIV infection in the differential diagnosis of any child with physical findings or illnesses suggestive of AIDS-related complex or AIDS, even when HIV serologic findings are negative and parents belong to no high-risk group. Parental testing for HIV antibody is suggested in such cases.\r"

  ".W": "Steroid 21-hydroxylase deficiency is the most common cause of congenital adrenal hyperplasia. It results from a deficiency in a specific cytochrome P450, P450c21 (P450XXIA). The gene encoding this protein (CYP21B) and a closely linked pseudogene (CYP21A) are located in the HLA complex on chromosome 6p. Many mutant alleles are associated with deletions of CYP21B; we report the cloning and characterization of a nondeleted mutant CYP21B gene. This mutant gene is expressed on transfection into mouse Y1 adrenal cells, producing mRNA levels similar to those seen after transfection of the normal CYP21B gene. In codon 172 of the mutant gene, the normal codon ATC, encoding isoleucine, has been changed to AAC, encoding asparagine. This mutation is normally present in the CYP21A pseudogene, so that it may have been transferred to the mutant CYP21B gene by gene conversion. Hybridization of oligonucleotide probes corresponding to this and two other mutations normally present in CYP21A demonstrated that 4 out of 20 patients carried the codon 172 mutation; in one of these patients, the mutation was present as part of a larger gene conversion involving at least exons 3-6. Gene conversion may be a frequent cause of 21-hydroxylase deficiency alleles due to the presence of six chi-like sequences (GCTGGGG) in the CYP21 genes and the close proximity of the CYP21A pseudogene, which has several potentially deleterious mutations.\r"

  ".U": "88144485\r", 
  ".W": "Previous studies located T-cell recognition of the nucleocapsid of the hepatitis B virus (HBcAg) to residues 120-140 in mice bearing the H-2s or H-2b haplotypes. Herein, we demonstrate that B10.S (H-2s) and B10 (H-2b) H-2 congenic strains recognize distinct T-cell sites within the p120-140 (a synthetic peptide corresponding to residues 120-140 of HBcAg) sequence defined by p120-131 and p129-140, respectively. Peptide p120-131 stimulates B10.S HBcAg-primed T cells, and reciprocally p120-131-primed T cells recognize HBcAg. Similarly, the p129-140 sequence is a T-cell recognition site relevant to the native HBcAg in the B10 strain. It is also shown that these 12-residue peptides efficiently prime T-helper cells, which are capable of eliciting antibody production to HBcAg in vivo. These observations prompted us to examine the ability of the HBcAg-specific p120-140 sequence to function as a T-cell carrier moiety as a component of a totally synthetic hepatitis B vaccine. For this purpose a synthetic B-cell epitope from the pre-S(2) region (p133-140) of the viral envelope was chosen because this sequence represents a dominant antibody-binding site of the envelope. Immunization of B10.S and B10 strains with the synthetic composite peptide c120-140-(133-140) elicited anti-peptide antibody production, which was crossreactive with the native viral envelope. Furthermore, c120-140-(133-140) immunization primed p120-131-specific T cells in the B10.S strain and p129-140-specific T cells in the B10 strain, which recognized HBcAg and provided T-helper cell function for anti-envelope antibody production in vivo. These results demonstrate the feasibility of constructing complex synthetic immunogens that represent multiple proteins of a pathogen and are capable of engaging both T and B cells relevant to the native antigens.\r"

The human T11 gene is approximately equal to 12 kilobases long and comprised of five exons. A leader exon (L) contains the 5'-untranslated region and most of the nucleotides defining the signal peptide [amino acids (aa) -24 to -5]. Two exons encode the extracellular segment; exon Ex1 is 321 base pairs (bp) long and codes for four residues of the leader peptide and aa 1-103 of the mature protein, and exon Ex2 is 231 bp long and encodes aa 104-180. Exon TM is 123 bp long and codes for the single transmembrane region of the molecule (aa 181-221). Exon C is a large 765-bp exon encoding virtually the entire cytoplasmic domain (aa 222-327) and the 3'-untranslated region. The murine T11 gene has a similar organization with exon-intron boundaries essentially identical to the human gene. Substantial conservation of nucleotide sequences between species in both 5'- and 3'-gene flanking regions equivalent to that among homologous exons suggests that murine and human genes may be regulated in a similar fashion. The probable relationship of the individual T11 exons to functional and structural protein domains is discussed.\r"

  ".W": "The expression of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) after T cell activation is regulated by NF-kappa B, an inducible DNA-binding protein that stimulates transcription. Proteins encoded by a variety of DNA viruses are also able to activate expression from the HIV enhancer. To determine how this activation occurs, specific genes from herpes simplex virus type 1 and adenovirus that activate HIV in T lymphoma cells have been identified. The cis-acting regulatory sequences in the HIV enhancer that mediate their effect have also been characterized. The relevant genes are those for ICP0-an immediate-early product of herpes simplex virus type 1-and the form of E1A encoded by the 13S messenger RNA of adenovirus. Activation of HIV by adenovirus E1A was found to depend on the TATA box, whereas herpesvirus ICP0 did not work through a single defined cis-acting element. These findings suggest multiple pathways that can be used to bypass normal cellular activation of HIV, and they raise the possibility that infection by herpes simplex virus or adenovirus may directly contribute to the activation of HIV in acquired immunodeficiency syndrome by mechanisms independent of antigenic stimulation in T cells.\r"

However, the test result one year after PD was improved compared with those before and within two months after operation, without differences from that of the control group. In new canine PD models in which drainage of the pancreatic duct, 50 per cent pancreatectomy and duodenojejunectomy were performed after three months of pancreatic duct obstruction, fibrosis surrounding the pancreatic duct was disclosed. However, the results of examination five months after PD revealed a milder degree of pancreatic fibrosis without aggravation of the lesion. The aforementioned findings indicated that the exocrine pancreas before PD was impaired due to obstructive pancreatitis and that the postoperative pancreatic function was well preserved at the level close to that in the control group even after approximately 50 per cent resection of the pancreas, if pancreatic duct drainage was effectively performed.\r"

Independent of stone size, about 35 per cent of the fragments remained in the gallbladder. Transient elevations of enzymes of the liver or pancreas occurred significantly less often with 2 millimeter fragments and were less pronounced. Gross pathologic changes of the papilla of Vater, or dilation of the bile duct were observed with 4 millimeter fragments but not with those that were 2 millimeters. The results of this study suggest that the maximal fragment size after destruction of gallstones should be as small as possible, that is, in the range of 2 millimeters.\r"

Both hospital and 4-year mortality rates were significantly reduced in the patent group by 13 and 14%, respectively (p less than or equal to 0.005 for both). Baseline variables known to be important for prognosis did not differ between the 2 groups. Patients with a patent infarct artery who underwent early acute coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) had a greater survival (p less than 0.10) and better left ventricular function (p less than 0.01) than did patients with a patent infarct artery who did not undergo CABG. This difference was associated with a lower frequency of fatal reinfarction and cardiogenic shock in the CABG group. Thus, survival is improved up to 4 years after successful thrombolysis and appears to be further enhanced by early CABG.\r"

Children 12 to 18 months of age, due for measles immunization, were given measles vaccine alone or mixed with DPT or DPTP. Their prevaccination and four-weeks postvaccination serum samples were tested for the measles virus hemagglutination-inhibition antibody titer. Although 191 children completed the study, only 160 were initially seronegative. The seroconversion rates and geometric mean antibody titers in children given measles vaccine alone, mixed with DPT, or mixed with DPTP were 98%, 96.3%, and 96.4% and 41, 53, and 53, respectively. Local and systemic reactions were no more frequent in children given the mixture of vaccines than in children given DPTP alone. In summary, injecting measles vaccine mixed with DPT or DPTP did not diminish its immunogenic potency or increase adverse reactions. We believe that freshly mixed measles and DPT or DPTP vaccines can be given together, thus avoiding two separate injections.\r"

Initial control of hemorrhage was obtained in 78 patients (95 percent). Six patients suffered major nonfatal complications, including bronchial aspiration (five patients) and esophageal rupture (one patient). Twenty-one patients rebled after balloon deflation and underwent emergency portal disconnection of the esophagus with a clip. The other patients underwent elective operation. Long-term survival rates were 49 percent at 1 year, 35 percent at 5 years, and 14 percent at 10 years. Ninety-four percent of the patients were free of recurrent variceal bleeding, as proved by endoscopy, at 1 year, 90 percent at 5 years, and 77 percent at 10 years. This study shows that temporary use of the Sengstaken-Blakemore tube for the initial control of acutely bleeding esophageal varices is effective and relatively safe. In our experience, methods for the prevention of complications were early endotracheal intubation in patients under anesthesia, avoidance of traction on the tube, and a period of tamponade not exceeding 24 hours.\r"

  ".W": "To determine whether intrathecal morphine is effective in decreasing analgesic and antihypertensive drug requirements after coronary artery bypass (CAB) surgery, a prospective, randomized, double-blind study was designed. Approximately 30 minutes before induction of anesthesia with IV sufentanil and diazepam, and 2 hours before heparinization, one group of patients (n = 16) were given morphine 0.5 mg, while the control group (n = 14) were given placebo intrathecal injections through 22- or 25-gauge lumbar puncture needles. Intraoperatively, there were no differences in the numbers of patients requiring vasodilator drugs or volatile agent titration. During the postoperative period, the treated group required significantly less (P less than 0.05) IV morphine compared with the placebo group, during the first 24 hours (1.8 +/- 0.7 vs 5.4 +/- 1.5 mg) and 30 hours (2.4 +/- 0.8 vs 8.3 +/- 1.9 mg). The treated group also required significantly less (P less than 0.05) sodium nitroprusside in the first 24 hours (58.1 +/- 29.0 vs 89.1 +/- 18.4 mg). There were no differences in pain scores, and the only complications (itching, nausea and vomiting) were infrequent. It is concluded that an intrathecal dose of 0.5 mg of morphine is efficacious in reducing analgesic and antihypertensive drug requirements after CAB surgery. Whether these results are clinically important enough to warrant the theoretical risks of postheparinization lumbar hematoma is a topic for further investigation.\r"

We designed a randomized, controlled, blinded test of their methods in laboratory rats. Venom of the fer-de-lance, Bothrops atrox, was injected subcutaneously into rats in a series of increasing doses. Half of each dose group then was shocked with a device used by the Ecuadoran group. Envenomated animals developed hemorrhagic ulcers at the injection sites, the size of which was strongly related to venom dose. Electric shock did not influence the development of morbidity or the eventual ulcer size in sublethally envenomated animals, nor did shocks reduce mortality in lethally envenomated animals. We conclude that shocks are without effect on snakebitten rats, and we discuss implications of our findings for the treatment of snakebitten human beings.\r"

  ".W": "The plasma proteinase inhibitor corresponding to alpha-1-proteinase inhibitor (alpha 1Pl) in humans was isolated from sheep plasma. Ovine alpha 1Pl is of higher molecular weight (62,000 daltons) than is human alpha 1Pl, is resistant to chemical oxidation by N-chlorosuccinimide, and has poor elastase-inactivating power compared with the corresponding inhibitor in humans. However, ovine alpha 1Pl is a potent trypsin inhibitor. Despite the differences indicated above, a partial homology (22 to 35%) exists between human and sheep alpha 1Pl, at least as analyzed through the first 20 residues of the sheep inhibitor. The weak elastase-inhibitory capacity of sheep alpha 1Pl is paralleled by the low content of elastase in the sheep neutrophil granule. These important differences between sheep and human neutrophils and plasma proteinase inhibitors should be borne in mind in designing experiments related to proteolytically mediated lung injury in the former species.\r"

  ".U": "88148582\r", 
  ".W": "Granuloma formation in the lung of patients with sarcoidosis is preceded by the accumulation of large numbers of activated T-lymphocytes, which results, at least in part, from the proliferation of T-lymphocytes within the lung. To determine whether the increased proliferation of lung T-lymphocytes in sarcoidosis results from a failure of mechanisms responsible for limiting their proliferation, we have compared the ability of purified T-lymphocytes present in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and peripheral blood from normal subjects and patients with sarcoidosis to respond to proliferative signals. The mitogen-induced proliferative response of lavage T-lymphocytes from normal subjects and patients with sarcoidosis was similar, but the response of lavage T-lymphocytes was much less than that observed using normal or sarcoid blood T-lymphocytes. The reduced proliferative response of sarcoid lavage T-lymphocytes could not be overcome by addition of accessory cells or exogenous interleukin-2, and it did not result from the presence of suppressor cells. Furthermore, sarcoid lavage lymphocytes are capable of being activated by \"mitogenic\" signals, as indicated by the ability of phytohemagglutinin to induce expression of the 4F2 surface antigen and stimulate interleukin-2 production. However, the expression of interleukin-2 receptors was reduced on stimulated sarcoid lavage T-lymphocytes compared with that observed on normal blood T-lymphocytes, which may account in part for their reduced proliferative capacity. Because mechanisms that render lavage T-lymphocytes from normal subjects refractory to proliferative signals appear to operate in sarcoidosis as well, these findings suggest that a defect in the inhibition of T-lymphocyte proliferation is unlikely to be an important cause of lymphocyte accumulation in this disorder.\r"

  ".W": "Pulmonary sarcoidosis is a chronic disorder characterized by the activation of helper/inducer T-cells in the lung without a concomitant increase in suppressor/cytotoxic T-cells. It is known that patients with sarcoidosis have circulating anti-T-cell antibodies, primarily of the IgM class. To evaluate a functional role for these antibodies in enhancing lung helper T-cell processes in pulmonary sarcoidosis, we evaluated serum and lavage fluid of patients with active sarcoidosis for the presence of anti-T-cell antibodies, the T-cell subset specificity of these antibodies, and the possible stimulatory or inhibitory effects of these antibodies on T-cells relevant to the exaggerated helper T-cell processes in sarcoidosis. Indirect immunofluorescence studies demonstrated that sarcoid patients had anti-T-cell antibodies of the IgM type reacting with autologous as well as with nonautologous normal T-cells. IgM recovered in sarcoid lavage fluid also reacted with T-cells, thus demonstrating the autoantibodies at the site of disease. Two-color immunofluorescence and flow cytometry showed that these sarcoid autoantibodies bound to mostly Leu2+ suppressor/cytotoxic T-cells, but also to a small proportion of Leu3+ helper/inducer T-cells. Incubating lymphocytes with sarcoid serum or IgM purified from sarcoid serum did not stimulate T-cell proliferation. Furthermore, when Leu2+ T-cells were stimulated with irradiated allogenic B-cells, increasing concentrations of sarcoid serum had no inhibitory effects on the activation and proliferative response of the Leu2+ T-cells. Likewise, the purified IgM anti-T-cell antibodies had no inhibitory effects on the mitogenic response of Leu2+ T-cells to the anti-T-cell antigen receptor-associated T3 complex antibody OKT3.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The incidence of resistance was 3.2% for tetracycline, 0.6% for chloramphenicol, and 12.5% for ampicillin. Resistance to ampicillin or tetracycline usually occurred alone, while 100% of chloramphenicol resistant isolates were co-resistant to tetracycline or ampicillin. More than 90% of antibiotic resistant isolates were nontypable and belonged to biotypes II, III, or V. Chart reviews of 331 patients revealed that patients with ampicillin resistant isolates were more likely than control subjects to have received ampicillin in the prior 6 wk (33% versus 6%, p less than 0.0001), whereas patients with isolates resistant to tetracycline or chloramphenicol plus tetracycline were more likely to have received tetracycline than control subjects (24% and 50%, respectively, versus 5%, p less than 0.005). The incidence of ampicillin resistance and the reluctance of physicians caring for adults to use chloramphenicol suggests that a newer cephalosporin such as cefotaxime may be the initial therapy of choice for severe H. influenzae disease in our patient population.\r"

The motivating factors for self treatment by individuals are discussed. These include advertising, lack of education, and a desire to reduce the cost of health care. Since the common OTC eye drops contain alpha-receptor stimulators, it is possible that they may either augment existing mydriasis or precipitate it if used in excessive amounts. It is difficult to estimate the number of cases of blindness from misuse of OTC eye drops. Education of the public about the dangers of self diagnosis and treatment of health problems including the red eye is necessary.\r"

The lCMRGlc was decreased in the frontal eye fields and in the paralamellar mediodorsal thalamus in the parkinsonian monkeys as compared to normal controls. No changes in lCMRGlc were observed in other areas of the oculomotor system. L-Dopa therapy reversed the oculomotor symptoms in these monkeys, as well as the decrease of lCMRGlc in the frontal eye fields and the paralamellar mediodorsal thalamus. Because the frontal eye fields are known to be involved in the initiation of voluntary saccades, these findings suggest a functional anatomical basis for the oculomotor deficits in Parkinson's disease.\r"

Both types of poikiloderma were similar with regard to T-cell antigen expression. In each case, most T cells expressed the CD4+ (helper/inducer) phenotype and lacked Leu-8 antigen. T cells were also deficient in Leu-9 antigen in most cases (MF, 11/14 [79%]; ALPP, 4/7 [57%]). These T-cell antigen deficiencies are similar to those described previously in various types of MF and indicate that such deficiencies are common in minimally infiltrated, patch-stage MF lesions. Because combined Leu-8/Leu-9 antigen deficiencies are uncommon in inflammatory skin diseases, our findings are consistent with the view that ALPP is an early form of MF, as had been suggested previously by results of clinicopathologic studies.\r"

Different phenotypes in the same patient occurring either simultaneously or during the course of the diseases were observed. Phenotypic aberration showed a statistically significant correlation with tumor stage MF, the large cerebriform tumor cell type, blast cell transformation, and diffuse dermal infiltration. In combination with longer-existing disease, more lymph node and visceral involvement and a higher mortality rate of MF in the aberrant group indicated an association with advanced disease. Its prognostic relevance for the individual patient, however, seemed limited because of the association of aberration and a long-lasting indolent course in many other patients. The assessment of phenotypic aberration formed a valuable contribution to the diagnosis of MF, especially in cases with little cellular atypia.\r"

Plasma polyclonal beta- and gamma-globulin concentrations were increased in many patients with KS and in control patients in Tanzania with chronic dermatopathies, but not in African hospital employees and patients undergoing elective surgery. Three of nine patients with locally aggressive KS possessed antibodies to human T-cell lymphotropic virus type III/lyphadenopathy-associated virus (HIV), but none had evidence of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) or the AIDS-related complex. Three patients with disseminated, rapidly progressive KS and high HIV-antibody titers had an immunologic and clinical picture consistent with AIDS. Two of 13 patients with the classic plaque/nodular form of KS had low plasma titers of HIV antibody, but the significance of these serologic findings is not known. The evidence suggests that HIV plays a role in the pathogenesis of some cases of KS in East Africa, but most patients with KS in East Africa have no evidence of overt immunologic deficiency or HIV infection.\r"

Subsequent aqueous and vitreous cultures were negative, but the intraocular inflammatory process progressed and ultimately led to enucleation of the eye. Histopathologic examination revealed granulomatous inflammation of the anterior uvea and scattered S schenckii in the anterior and posterior chambers. Electron microscopy demonstrated that most of the organisms had disorganized protoplasm. Although treatment failed to ameliorate the progressive intraocular inflammatory process, the negative cultures and the electron microscopic observations suggest that the treatment was reasonably effective in killing S schenckii within the eye. To our knowledge, this is the first case report of S schenckii endophthalmitis in a patient with human immunodeficiency virus infection.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of graded cyclocryotherapy were studied using pneumatonometry, fluorophotometry, and light and electron microscopy. Cats were treated with either 90 degrees, 180 degrees, or 270 degrees of cyclocryotherapy and were followed up for six weeks. The response of the eyes to treatment was evaluated in terms of intraocular pressure (IOP) response, aqueous humor flow rate, and permeability of the blood-aqueous barrier compared with the untreated fellow eye. The average IOP response was determined to be -20%, -44%, and -47% for the 90 degrees, 180 degrees, and 270 degrees treated eyes, respectively. The aqueous humor flow rate was estimated to be -14%, -44%, and -52% for each of the groups, respectively. Finally, the permeability of the blood-aqueous barrier, measured 60 minutes after injection of fluorescein, was estimated to be a percent increase of 22%, 332%, and 285% for each of the groups, respectively. Histologically, the maximally treated eyes (270 degrees) demonstrated greater disruption of the ciliary body compared with the control eyes. Thus, graded cyclocryotherapy causes graded destruction of the ciliary epithelium and proportionally related changes in IOP and aqueous humor dynamics.\r"

IL-1 also stimulated prostaglandin E2 and plasminogen activator synthesis, in parallel with PLA2 activation; all 3 were detectable within 6 hours of IL-1 treatment and peaked by 24 hours. Synovial cell PLA2 required calcium (5 mM) and a neutral pH (7.5) for maximal activity and appears similar to the PLA2 in synovial fluid, which has been described previously. We conclude that PLA2 can be induced by IL-1, and its secretion may contribute significantly to the inflammatory actions of IL-1.\r"

We sought to characterize the T lymphocyte subsets in the synovial fluid (SF) and peripheral blood (PB) of RA patients in an attempt to clarify the mechanism(s) responsible for these functional immune abnormalities. We used dual-immunofluorescence staining techniques with several combinations of monoclonal antibodies, including anti-4B4 and anti-2H4, which define, respectively, the helper inducer and suppressor inducer subsets of CD4+ (Leu-3+ and T4+) cells. Mononuclear cells from normal PB (n = 9), RA PB (n = 6), and RA SF (n = 9) were analyzed, after staining, by flow cytometry. We observed a significant increase (P less than 0.0002) in the number of cells bearing the helper inducer phenotype (CD4+, 4B4+), and a significant decrease (P less than 0.0002) in the number of cells bearing the suppressor inducer phenotype (CD4+, 2H4+), in RA SF compared with the levels in PB from RA patients or normal control subjects. We also observed that the CD8+, 2H4+ subset was significantly decreased (P less than 0.0001) in SF compared with that in PB. There was no significant difference in the lymphocyte subset levels in PB from RA patients and from normal subjects. These observations may account, in part, for the reduced suppressor activity, the poor response to mitogens, and the autologous mixed lymphocyte reaction, as well as the enhanced production of Ig and rheumatoid factor, that are observed in the rheumatoid joint.\r"

Moreover, we observed a strong positive correlation between the degree of disease activity and the amount of spontaneous incorporation of 3H-thymidine by B cells; the magnitude of the increase in frequency of spontaneous Ig-secreting cells in peripheral blood correlated strikingly with certain clinical features in these patients. Our findings suggest that there is heterogeneity of B cell hyperactivity in individual patients with SLE and, thus, that clinical subsets of SLE can be identified on the basis of B cell hyperactivity.\r"

Since the mobility of these molecules is regulated in part by cAMP, we sought to determine whether there is a specific defect(s) along the T cell cAMP pathway that contributes to the persistent capping disorder observed during inactive SLE. The data suggest that a defect may exist at the level of cAMP-dependent protein kinase activation or at a point distally. We propose that a disorder of cAMP-dependent protein kinase activity might account for the defect of capping observed in both the CD3, CD4 (helper/inducer) and CD3, CD8 (suppressor) subsets observed in SLE.\r"

Blood was taken after various time intervals up to 24 h for the measurement of propofol concentrations by HPLC and for the estimation of propofol protein binding. The mean blood propofol concentration was generally higher in the elderly group, but this difference was only significant at 2 min after induction. The clearance of propofol was significantly lower in the elderly (1.44 +/- 0.10 (SE) litre min-1) than in the younger patients (1.79 +/- 0.12 litre min-1). The volume of the central compartment in the elderly patients was significantly smaller (19.6 +/- 5.2 litre) than that in the young (26.3 +/- 2.9 litre). There was no difference in the volume of distribution at equilibrium (1608 +/- 246 litre in the elderly and 1757 +/- 360 litre in the young), in the volume of distribution at steady state (691 +/- 139 litre in the elderly and 771 +/- 236 litre in the young) or in the half-lives of distribution and elimination. The plasma protein binding of propofol was similar in both groups and showed no trend with time after dose.\r"

In the present study, we immortalized human B cell lines from normal individuals and from patients with malignant or benign dysglobulinemia with Epstein-Barr virus and examined, after cloning, the autoantibody reactivities of the immunoglobulins secreted by these cells. Forty-two supernatants were analyzed by enzyme-immunoassay on a panel of 13 self and non-self antigens: trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNP), DNA, L-glutamine, L-alanine, L-tyrosine (GAT), actin, myosin, tubulin, albumin, renin, spectrin, transferrin, thyroglobulin, myoglobin, peroxidase, and by immunofluorescence in tissue sections. Fourteen (33%) of the immunoglobulin-secreting cell lines were found to have an autoantibody function; seven secreted IgM, six IgA, and one IgG. The light chains were of the kappa type in 11 cases. The vast majority of these clones reacted with more than five antigens of the panel and all of them reacted with TNP. No correlation was found between a given isotype and an antibody specificity. More than half of these antibodies also reacted with cellular antigens present in tissue sections. None of the four cell lines secreting monoclonal antiviral antibodies reacted with any of the antigens of the panel. The results indicate that immunoglobulins secreted by human monoclonal lymphoid cell lines can have polyspecific autoantibody functions, similar to those found in normal human polyclonal antibodies, in human monoclonal paraproteins and in natural monoclonal antibodies synthesized by murine or rat clones obtained from physiologically normal animals.\r"

Eosinophil production was selective and first detectable after 14 days and reached a peak between 21 and 35 days when they were the predominant cell type (41% to 89%). Until day 14, all the eosinophils were typical myelocytes, developing thereafter into metamyelocytes and mature cells. All cell types had characteristic light- and electron-microscopic features, apart from the absence of granules with crystalline cores. The eosinophils produced were readily recovered, and both immature myelocytes and mature cells were functionally active in an antibody-dependent, cell-mediated cytotoxicity assay. mEDF added into the assay enhanced the cytotoxicity but to a lower degree than previously reported for peripheral blood eosinophils, which suggests that they may be partially activated. The possibility that eosinophils could be deactivated was tested by removing mEDF from the culture medium. The eosinophils retained viability and functional activity, however, and showed no increased ability to be activated by mEDF for up to six days after removing the mEDF. The liquid culture of human bone marrow was shown to be an alternative assay for eosinophil differentiation factors to colony formation.\r"

Patients' natural killer (NK) and lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cell activity was compared with that of normal donors in terms of: (a) cytolytic activity (four-hour 51Cr release assay) against an NK-sensitive target (K562), NK-resistant targets (Raji/Daudi), and fresh/cryopreserved autologous and allogeneic leukemic blasts; (b) proliferation and expansion in culture with 1,000 U/mL recombinant IL 2 (rIL 2); and (c) the cell surface phenotype of the cultured cells. In 21 of 24 patients with active disease (AP) MNCs derived from the peripheral blood (PBL) or bone marrow (BM) could be cultured and expanded in the presence of rIL 2. These cultures initially contained between 30% and 50% blasts, and during 2 to 4 weeks of culture destruction of blasts and enrichment of up to 60% in cells with the morphology of large granular lymphocytes (LGLs) was observed. Expansion in culture varied between two- and 100-fold. MNCs from all patients in remission (RP) could be activated by rIL 2 and expanded up to 30-fold after 1 to 3 weeks in culture. NK activity of fresh PBLs from AP was significantly lower than in normal controls, whereas NK activity of RP was within the normal range. High levels of postactivation NK and LAK activity on K562/Raji/Daudi and on fresh/cryopreserved leukemic blasts was generated in approximately 50% of cases of AP and in most RP. Cell surface phenotype studies showed that cultured cells derived from ANLL patients were significantly enriched (up to 40%) in NKH-1 (Leu 19) positive cells, with RP LAK cells also expressing a high proportion of CD16 positive cells (up to 40%). This study has shown that it is feasible to activate and significantly expand killer cells derived from active disease and remission ANLL patients during 1 to 3 weeks culture with IL 2 with good maintenance of cytolytic activity.

Chronic serum sickness induced by cationic human serum albumin led to capillary loop deposits in Lewis rats, whereas DA rats had mesangial deposits of rat immunoglobulin G even in control kidneys. 5. Lewis rats developed proteinuria after infusion of the polycation hexadimethrine whereas DA rats did not. 6. DA rats developed greater proteinuria after injection of puromycin aminonucleoside. 7. These results support the hypothesis that an individual's susceptibility to different forms of glomerulonephritis may result from their glomerular properties and not necessarily from their immune responses.\r"

In addition to the well known stimulatory effect, each showed a significant inhibitory effect on cAMP accumulation at low doses. cAMP concentrations in response to sCT, hCT, and rCGRP decreased to 47 +/- 2, 45 +/- 4, and 56 +/- 2% (mean +/- 1 SE) of baseline. The potency ratios for the inhibitory action of sCT, hCT, and rCGRP (1:0.25:0.005, respectively) were similar to the potency ratios for stimulatory action (1:0.3:0.005). The inhibition of cAMP accumulation developed at 300-fold lower peptide concentrations than the stimulation. Preincubation with pertussis toxin or with manganese completely abolished the inhibitory effect of the peptides, suggesting that this is mediated by an inhibitory adenylate cyclase regulatory protein. sCT, hCT, and CGRP each showed unique patterns with regard to time course of inhibition of cAMP accumulation. We conclude that 1) CT can activate an inhibitory adenylate cyclase regulatory protein and a stimulatory adenylate cyclase regulatory protein, and 2) CT effect on an inhibitory adenylate cyclase regulatory protein in MCF 7 cells is evident at far lower hormone concentrations than its effect on a stimulatory adenylate cyclase regulatory protein.\r"

  ".W": "Control of ACTH secretion in the pituitary in the absence of target cells for CRF, the most potent ACTH secretagogue, was studied in dissociated bovine anterior pituitary cells treated with a potent selective cytotoxin. The cytotoxin is a conjugate of the CRF analog [Nle21,38, Arg36]rat (r) CRF and the plant toxin gelonin. Dissociated bovine anterior pituitary cells were pretreated with vehicle, 2 nM ovine CRF, 2 nM cytotoxic conjugate, or unconjugated [Nle21,38,Arg36]rCRF and gelonin in amounts equivalent to that of 2 nM cytotoxic conjugate for 12 h, then extensively washed and cultured for 3 days before acute secretion experiments. Unstimulated ACTH secretion was similar in all groups. ACTH secretion in response to CRF was attenuated by pretreatment with the cytotoxic conjugate; CRF (2.5 nM)-stimulated secretion was 7.0, 6.3, and 2.8 times the unstimulated rate in cells pretreated with vehicle, 2 nM CRF, or 2 nM cytotoxic conjugate, respectively. Likewise, the ACTH secretory response to a cAMP analog was attenuated by pretreatment with the conjugate; 8-bromo-cAMP (10 mM)-stimulated secretion was 6.8, 7.1, and 3.3 times the unstimulated rate in cells pretreated with vehicle, CRF, or conjugate, respectively. In contrast, the ACTH responses to vasopressin (VP) or oxytocin (OR) remained intact. VP stimulated the ACTH secretion rate by 4.2, 4.0, and 3.5 times, respectively, in the three groups. OT stimulated the ACTH secretion rate by 2.7, 2.6, and 2.3 times in the three groups. Pretreatment with the conjugate attenuated the response to CRF and VP in combination by the same amount as it attenuated the response to CRF alone. The ACTH secretory responses in cells pretreated with unconjugated [Nle21,38,Arg36]rCRF and gelonin were not different from responses in cells pretreated with vehicle. These results suggest that there is a separate mechanism or cell type for OT- and VP-stimulated ACTH secretion distinct from that responsible for the action of CRF on pituitary cells.\r"

In this assay system, spleen T cells adhering to nylon wool demonstrated a high cytotoxic activity against target liver cells. The cytotoxicity was markedly reduced by prostaglandin E1 at concentrations greater than 10(-7) M. Maximum suppressive activity was obtained when prostaglandin E1 was continuously present during the assay period. By contrast, indomethacin, a specific inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis, enhanced the cytotoxic activity of effector cells. These data seem to indicate that exogenously added prostaglandin E1 has an inhibitory effect on cell-mediated cytotoxicity of effector spleen cells against target hepatocytes.\r"

Histologic examination showed there was villus shortening with time but no evidence of rejection. When perfused with isotonic saline, both allografts and controls secreted water. However, allografts and denervated controls secreted chloride, whereas innervated controls absorbed chloride (p less than 0.05). There was a marked reduction in water and sodium absorption from 30 mM glucose-saline in transplanted loops and denervated controls, whereas glucose absorption was relatively preserved in these groups at 9 days (p less than 0.01). These changes could not be accounted for by rejection or ischemia. These studies demonstrate that denervation may be a major limiting factor in intestinal transplantation.\r"

Seventy-seven patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, 68 gay men with symptoms of acute diarrhea or proctitis, and 243 gay men without gastrointestinal symptoms and participating in a natural history study of human immunodeficiency virus infection were selected for study. Approximately 12% of the asymptomatic men harbored at least one enteric pathogen; the most frequently recovered were Chlamydia trachomatis, herpes simplex virus, and Giardia lamblia. Men carrying a pathogen were more likely to be human immunodeficiency virus seropositive (48%) than men without a pathogen (25%) (p = 0.018), more likely to have fewer T helper cells (p = 0.015), and more likely to have a mucopurulent exudate (p = 0.014). We recovered an agent of enteric disease from 68% of gay men presenting with diarrhea or proctitis. Campylobacter species, herpes simplex virus, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, C. trachomatis, G. lamblia, and Shigella species were identified most frequently. The most common pathogen associated with diarrhea in acquired immunodeficiency syndrome was Cryptosporidium (16% of 49 cases). Other agents identified were Clostridium difficile, Vibrio parahemolyticus, Campylobacter species, G. lamblia, Isospora, and cytomegalovirus. Approximately half of the identifiable etiologic agents of diarrhea in acquired immunodeficiency syndrome patients were treatable with antibiotics, but these agents required special culture procedures for detection.\r"

To determine whether these defects may be secondary to disordered lymphokine production, we have simultaneously assayed interleukin-1 and interleukin-2 production in 31 chronic carriers of the hepatitis B virus. Supernatants from mononuclear cells cultured both in the presence and absence of lipopolysaccharide contained significantly increased quantities of interleukin-1 activity in patients compared with normal controls (p less than 0.01). Lysates of monocytes from patients also contained more interleukin-1 than those of controls (p less than 0.05) in the presence of lipopolysaccharide or silica, or both. These results indicate that interleukin-1 production is markedly elevated in patients with chronic hepatitis B virus infection, whereas in contrast, interleukin-2 production was found to be reduced in these patients (p less than 0.01). As one of the biological properties of interleukin-1 is to stimulate fibroblasts to produce collagen, the relationship between fibrosis in the liver biopsy specimen and interleukin production was examined. There was a highly significant correlation (p less than 0.001) between interleukin-1 production and the severity of fibrosis, suggesting that this lymphokine may be closely related to the development of cirrhosis in such patients.\r"

High ACE-specific activity was found in the monoamine-containing regions of the brainstem and in the intermediolateral column of the spinal cord. In brainstem homogenates 125I-Ang I was metabolized to angiotensin II (Ang-[1-8]) and the N-terminal heptapeptide Ang-(1-7). In the presence of MK 422 (50 microM), Ang-(1-7) was still generated, while the production of Ang-(1-8) was inhibited. This study revealed the presence of high ACE activity in monoamine regions of dog brainstem and spinal cord, and showed that the metabolite Ang-(1-7) is the major product generated from Ang I in the presence and absence of ACE inhibition.\r"

This hypothesis was investigated by the topical application of angiotensin I (Ang I), Ang II, the Ang II antagonist [Sar1, Thr8]Ang II, and the Ang I converting enzyme inhibitor MK 422 to a restricted region of the ventral medullary surface known as the glycine-sensitive area. Both Ang I (100 pmol) and Ang II (100 pmol) produced significant (p less than 0.01) increases in blood pressure (+20 +/- 4 and +31 +/- 5 mm Hg, respectively) that were associated with no change in heart rate. Furthermore, the relationship between the peak increases in blood pressure and Ang II was dose-dependent. Blockade of endogenous Ang II by [Sar1, Thr8]Ang II (13 nmol) produced a significant decrease in baseline blood pressure (-8 +/- 1 mm Hg; p less than 0.001). Similarly, topical application of MK 422 prevented the pressor effect of Ang I. Taken together, these experiments indicate that at least some components of the renin-angiotensin system exist in the ventrolateral medulla and they may modulate vasomotor outflow.\r"

  ".W": "To delineate the antigenic determinants on thyroglobulin (Tg) recognized by serum autoantibodies and peripheral blood T cells from patients with chronic thyroiditis, we studied the reactivities of three different Tg preparations, i.e. enzyme-digested Tg fragments, physically or chemically denatured Tg, or Tg with differing iodine contents. Human Tg was digested with staphylococcal V8 protease, and the fragments were separated by high performance liquid chromatography. The autoantibodies reacted with the larger fragments, but their ability to bind to small fragments was limited. On the other hand, T cells reacted similarly with all fragments, regardless of mol wt. The autoantibodies bound little to denatured Tg after its disulfide bonds were destroyed with dithiothreitol or 2-mercaptoethanol, while the reactivity of heat-denatured Tg was partially decreased, and that of Tg denatured with sodium dodecyl sulfate was conserved. Conversely, T cells reacted with Tg denatured by heating or dithiothreitol treatment. These results indicate that autoantibodies recognize mainly a conformational structure of Tg, presumably containing disulfide bonds, whereas T cells recognize the primary structure of Tg. Variations in the iodine content of Tg were not associated with altered reactivity with autoantibodies or T cells. We propose that variations in Tg conformation related to iodination of the molecule do not contribute significantly to its reactivity with autoantibodies and T cells. In addition, T cells reacted with the smaller Tg fragments containing few T3 or T4 residues to a greater extent than they did with larger Tg fragments with the same amount of T3 or T4 as native Tg. Therefore, it appears that the Tg-reactive T cells predominantly recognize determinants on the Tg molecule that are unrelated to hormone-containing sites.\r"

The average cytotoxicities of PB-MNC from Graves' patients toward K562 cells (NK-sensitive cells), Raji cells (NK-resistant cells), and autologous thyrocytes were 23.9 +/- 10.8 (+/- SD) lytic units (LU), 7.4 +/- 3.8 LU, and 11.7 +/- 4.4 LU, respectively. There were no differences in the NK and NK-like cell activity of PB-MNC between Graves' disease patients and normal subjects. In contrast to PB-MNC from patients with Graves' disease, NK and NK-like cell activity was markedly decreased in TG-MNC (NK cell activity, 2.1 +/- 2.3 LU; NK-like cell activity, 1.5 +/- 1.5 LU). TG-MNC from Graves' patients had no cytotoxic activity against autologous thyrocytes. Using the monoclonal anti-Leu 7 and anti-CD16 antibodies and a two-color immunofluorescence method, the NK cell subsets were examined in PB-MNC and TG-MNC from Graves' patients. The percentage of CD16+ cells was significantly decreased in TG-MNC compared to PB-MNC, whereas there was no significant difference in the percentage of Leu 7+ cells between PB-MNC and TG-MNC. Incubation of TG-MNC with medium only did not increase the NK and NK-like cell activity of these cells. Furthermore, incubation of autologous PB-MNC with supernatants of minced thyroid tissues did not alter their NK and NK-like cell activity. The decreased NK and NK-like cell activity of TG-MNC was augmented when these cells were incubated with recombinant interleukin-2. These results suggest that the reduction of NK cell activity in TG-MNC may allow perpetuation of B-cell activation and lead to excessive production of autoantibody in thyroid tissue.\r"

CD8 and CD4 (helper/inducer) cells were separated by the panning method. Patient's non-T cells and autologous CD4 cells were cultured with or without autologous or allogeneic CD8 cells in the presence of either pokeweed mitogen or Staphylococcus aureus strain Cowan 1 plus human thyroid microsomal antigen. Antithyroid microsomal antibody (AMA) and total immunoglobulin G (IgG)-secreting non-T cells were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot assay. With pokeweed mitogen stimulation, the suppressor effect of CD8 cells from patients with serum AMA on the induction of AMA (of IgG type)-secreting cells was significantly less than that of CD8 cells from normal subjects. CD8 cells from patients with no serum AMA suppressed the induction of AMA-secreting cells as much as did normal CD8 cells. CD8 cells from both patients and normal subjects suppressed the induction of IgG-secreting cells equally well. On the other hand, with the combination of S. aureus strain Cowan 1 and human thyroid microsomal antigen (1 mg/L) stimulation, CD8 cells from both normal subjects and patients only slightly suppressed the induction of IgG-secreting cells. However, under these circumstances, once again, CD8 cells from both normal subjects and patients with no serum AMA suppressed the induction of AMA-secreting cells, whereas CD8 cells from patients with serum AMA suppressed the induction of the AMA-secreting cells significantly less. Higher TMc concentrations enhanced the suppressor effect of CD8 cells from patients with serum AMA on the induction of AMA-secreting cells. Furthermore, Concanavalin A, when added to the stimuli described above, further inhibited the induction of both AMA- and IgG-secreting cells by CD8 cells from patients with serum AMA. There thus appears to be a relative defect of antigen-specific suppressor T lymphocyte function in CD8 cells from patients with autoimmune thyroid disease, which may result in the presence of autoantibody-secreting cells in those patients.\r"

To prevent binding of glucocorticoids by serum proteins, we used a serum-free medium containing insulin, transferrin, selenium, and epidermal growth factor. The latter was found to be essential for both basal and CRH-stimulated ACTH secretion. CRH acutely stimulated, in a dose-dependent manner, ACTH release by all adenomas studied, with an IC50 of 0.5 X 10(-9) mol/L. Prolonged exposure (10 days) to a half-maximal stimulatory concentration of CRH led to continuous stimulation of ACTH secretion. A 4-day incubation with cortisol induced a dose-dependent decrease in both basal and long term CRH-stimulated ACTH release, with no difference in the IC50 (1 X 10(-8) mol/L). These data suggest that long term exposure to CRH does not desensitize corticotroph adenoma cells. Thus, it is unlikely that long-acting analogs of CRH will be useful in the treatment of Cushing's disease. ACTH secretion from corticotroph adenomas is restrained by glucocorticoids; the sensitivity of these cells to the negative effect of glucocorticoids is not modified by long term stimulation with CRH.\r"

  ".W": "Thyroid mononuclear cells (TMC) were maintained in long term cocultures with thyroid fibroblasts and thyroid epithelial cells from patients with Graves' disease, using medium supplemented with thyroid microsomal antigen (McAg) and IL-2. The TMC consisted predominantly of T4+ (CD4+, helper) and, to a lesser extent, T8+ (CD8+, cytotoxic/suppressor) lymphocytes, with a small number of macrophages and natural killer cells. The average T4+ to T8+ ratio was 3.2. From these cultures we obtained thyroid T cell lines and clones reactive to thyroid antigens. T Cell lines were tested in a microproliferation assay using thyroglobulin (Tg), McAg, tetanus toxoid, and IL-2. Of 14 lines from 6 patients, 2 proliferated in response to McAg when TMC plus thyroid fibroblasts were used as antigen-presenting cells. Clones of thyroid lymphocytes were obtained by culturing cells at limiting dilution with IL-2, McAg, and different types of autologous accessory cells. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells plus skin fibroblasts provided the best source of accessory cells, allowing near 100% cloning efficiency. Of 26 clones tested, 6 recognized McAg, 2 were Tg reactive, and 3 were autoreactive. All phenotyped clones were of the T4+ phenotype. Our method results in production of thyroid T cell lines and clones. The fibroblasts probably provided growth factors and/or collaborated with peripheral blood mononuclear cells as antigen-presenting cells. These lines and clones from patients with Graves' disease were predominantly helper T cells, in contrast to the previously demonstrated cytotoxic/suppressor cell predominance in cells from patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis. This difference in cell function may help explain the differing clinical courses of these two closely related autoimmune thyroid diseases. The availability of long term microsomal antigen-specific T cell clones should allow careful analysis of the role these cells play in thyroid autoimmunity.\r"

  ".W": "We have recently developed a mAb designated anti-Ti gamma A, which was found to immunoprecipitate from the well characterized CD3+ TCR alpha/beta- F6C7 fetal clone a CD3-associated disulfide-linked gamma-glycoprotein. This antibody recognizes approximately 3% of adult peripheral lymphocytes and delineates a CD2+ CD3+ TCR alpha/beta- CD4- NKH1- subset where expression of CD8 appears to vary widely from one individual to another. In the present study, we have used anti-Ti gamma A mAb to assess whether gamma-chains expressed on these adult lymphocytes are used as functional R. The two activities which have been associated thus far with TCR gamma+ cells, that is, IL-2-dependent proliferation and non-MHC-restricted cytotoxicity, were investigated here by using either resting or activated Ti gamma A+ lymphocytes. On the resting state, these cells (which appear as a very homogeneous population of granular lymphocytes) mediate little if any NK activity that could not be augmented by anti-Ti gamma A mAb. In contrast, after initial stimulation by PHA plus rIL-2 and subsequent culture in the presence of IL-2, activated Ti gamma A+ lymphocytes were strongly lytic against a series of conventional NK target cell lines. This cytotoxic function was either blocked or enhanced by anti-Ti gamma A mAb, depending upon experimental conditions. With respect to proliferation, it was possible to induce responses of resting Ti gamma A+ lymphocytes with antibody-coated CNBr beads only in the presence of exogenous IL-2, whereas, in culture, the same cells proliferated directly and secreted IL-2 after treatment by anti-Ti gamma A beads. Taken together, these data demonstrate that a major subset of circulating CD3+ TCR alpha/beta- lymphocytes use protein products of T cell gamma rearranging genes as functional R structures.\r"

  ".W": "Splenic B cells from DBA/2 and NZB mice were compared with regard to precursor frequency of anti-ssDNA-producing cells. Using a modification of the splenic fragment assay, we show that NZB T cells are capable of increasing the frequency of expression of anti-ssDNA precursors in DBA/2 splenic B cells. When limiting numbers of splenic B cells of DBA/2 origin were adoptively transferred into an irradiated (1200 rad) recipient, the co-transfer of NZB T cells markedly increased the frequency of anti-ssDNA precursors in cultured splenic fragments. The anti-ssDNA produced under these conditions was exclusively IgM and exhibited a high degree of cross-reactivity with TNP and fluorescein. Thus, the increase in anti-ssDNA precursor frequency reflected an expansion of the B cell repertoire to include precursors of polyspecific antibody-producing cells that under normal circumstances are not expressed. The ability of NZB T cells to increase the anti-ssDNA precursor frequency was further defined by the CBA/N immunodeficiency gene xid, in that B cells from DBA/2.xid donors did not exhibit increased anti-ssDNA precursor frequency in the presence of NZB T cells. When NZB splenic B cells were co-transferred with DBA/2 T cells, the anti-DNA precursor frequency of the NZB B cells was not reduced. This study demonstrates that T cells can influence the emergency of B cell clones in an Ag-nonspecific manner. The well documented in vivo spontaneous polyclonal activation of NZB B cells may be secondary to T cell-mediated expansion of the B cell repertoire.\r"

  ".W": "In the present study, we have isolated and characterized the Lyt-1+, -2- T contrasuppressor (Tcs) cells from mice systemically primed with SRBC. Adoptive transfer of splenic Tcs cells from these mice abrogates oral tolerance and supports IgM and IgG anti-SRBC plaque-forming cell (PFC) responses; however, unlike the responses seen after transfer of Tcs cells derived from orally primed mice, low IgA responses were seen. Mice systemically primed with lower SRBC doses (0.01 to 1%) exhibited contrasuppression only within the L3T4- T cell subset, whereas mice primed with a high dose of SRBC (10%), harbored Lyt-1+, -2- Tcs cells in both the L3T4+ and L3T4- subsets. Both the L3T4- and L3T4+ Tcs cell subsets supported IgM and IgG responses when adoptively transferred to orally tolerized mice, and when added to tolerized spleen cell cultures. Splenic Tcs cells from systemically primed mice supported mainly IgG1 and IgG2b subclass anti-SRBC PFC responses, a pattern also seen with Tcs cells derived from orally primed mice. Both L3T4+ and L3T4- Tcs cells from systemically primed mice exhibited well established characteristics of contrasuppressor cells including binding to Vicia villosa lectin and expression of I-J. The splenic effector Tcs cells which support IgM, IgG1 and IgG2b anti-SRBC PFC responses are antigen-specific, since both L3T4- and L3T4+ Tcs cells from spleens of mice primed with 10% SRBC reverse tolerance to SRBC, but not to horse erythrocytes (HRBC). Further, both L3T4- and L3T4+ Tcs cells from HRBC-primed mice reverse tolerance to IgM and IgG anti-HRBC, but not to anti-SRBC responses. Isolation of T3-positive Lyt-1+, -2- and L3T4- Tcs cell subsets by flow cytometry followed by adoptive transfer, showed that effector Tcs cells express T3 and presumably contain an Ag-R (TCR-T3 complex). These studies show that systemic priming with heterologous RBC induces splenic Ag specific Tcs cells in a dose-dependent manner, which support IgM and IgG subclass responses, but not IgA responses.\r"

  ".W": "The production of antibody to a thymus-dependent Ag requires cooperation between the B cell and an Ag-specific Th cell. MHC restriction of this interaction implies that the Th cell recognizes Ag on the B cell surface in the context of MHC molecules and that the Ag-specific B cell gets help by acting as an APC for the Th cell. However, a number of studies have suggested that normal resting B cells are ineffective as APC, implying that the B cell must leave the resting state before it can interact specifically with a Th cell. Other studies, including our own with rabbit globulin-specific mouse T cell lines and hybridomas, show that certain T cell lines can be efficiently stimulated by normal resting B cells. One possible explanation for the above contradiction is that our B cells have become activated before presentation. Here we show that presentation by size-selected small B cells is not the result of nonspecific activation signals generated by the T cells or components of the medium. Also, although LPS activation does increase the efficiency of presentation by small B cells, use of large cells in place of small cells or preincubation of resting B cells with mitogenic doses of anti-Ig does not. Another possibility that we considered was that small B cells are unable to process Ag and that we had selected T cell lines that were capable of recognizing native Ag on the B cell surface. In the majority of cases, experiments with B cell lines and macrophages have shown that Ag presentation requires Ag processing, a sequence of events that includes internalization of Ag into an acid compartment, denaturation or digestion of Ag into fragments, and its return to the cell surface in the context of class II MHC molecules. The experiments reported here show that our T cell lines require an Ag processing step and that small resting B cells, like other APC, process Ag before presenting it to T cells. Specifically, we show that an incubation of 2 to 4 h is required after the Ag pulse before Ag presentation becomes resistant to irradiation. Shortly after the pulse, the Ag enters a pronase-resistant compartment. Although efficient Ag presentation requires initial binding to membrane Ig, Ag is no longer associated with membrane Ig at the time of presentation and is not presented in its intact form, because removal of membrane Ig by goat anti-Ig blocks presentation before but not after the Ag pulse.\r"

Such reciprocal down-regulation occurs at 0 degrees C in the presence of sodium azide and appears selective for CD2 and CD4 molecules because mAb identifying various other CD T cell surface molecules (anti-Leu2a, -OK-CLL, -W6/32, -beta 2-microglobulin, -4B4) do not modulate CD2 or CD4 R density, and because anti-CD2 mAb (anti-OKT11 and -D66 clone-1) do not alter CD8 R density (anti-OKT8, -Leu2a) and vice versa. Down-regulation of CD2 by mAb specific to CD4 is epitope-specific but does not vary on the basis of the antibody isotype used. The anti-CD4 mAb, Leu3a, was the strongest CD2 down-regulator examined followed by OKT4F. mAb specific to other CD4 epitopes (B, C, D, and E) caused only slight down-regulation of CD2 expression whereas anti-OKT4 and -OKT4A mAb had no significant regulatory effect. Also, mAb specific to the 9.6 (anti-OKT11) and D66 (anti-D66 clone 1) epitopes of the CD2 molecule down-regulated CD4 density detectable with Leu3a, OKT4, and OKT4A anti-CD4 mAb. Down-regulation of CD2 by anti-CD4 mAb also occurred with the transformed T cell line, KE-37, which demonstrates that such effects can occur without mononuclear phagocytic accessory cells. From these data it can be concluded that important T cell immunoregulatory signals may be transmitted intramembranally between CD2 and CD4 glycoproteins.\r"

A striking feature of activation through CDw40 was the promotion of strong homotypic adhesions which did not occur in populations cultured with IL-4. Whereas the CDw40 antibody down-regulated its target Ag, an increased expression of CDw40 accompanied IL-4 stimulation. Similarly, only IL-4, and not the CDw40 antibody, was able to induce the appearance of CD23 on the resting B cell surface. Functionally, the major consequence of ligating CDw40 on resting B cells was that they remained alert to subsequent mitogenic signaling--cells incubated with IL-4 developed the same sluggish response as noted in control cultures. Together, IL-4 and the CDw40 antibody provoked a small, but significant, level of DNA synthesis in tonsillar B cells which was enhanced dramatically by the inclusion of low m.w. B cell growth factor. This latter agent had no discernible direct effect on resting B lymphocytes. The different pathways which have been observed for triggering resting B cells are discussed.\r"

The responses of small (mean volume 120 mu 3), dense (greater than 1.087 specific gravity), resting (least spontaneous thymidine incorporation) B lymphocytes were augmented by irradiated (4000 rad), larger (mean volume greater than 170 mu 3), less dense (less than 1.081 specific gravity), activated (greater spontaneous thymidine incorporation) B lymphocytes. Proliferation was augmented 2- to 4-fold and polyclonal antibody-forming cell responses three- to sixfold. Maximal augmentation of the responses of 5 X 10(4) resting B cells was obtained with 10(4) activated B cells. Augmenting activity was specific for activated B lymphocytes in that responses were not augmented by irradiated thymocytes, T lymphoblasts, macrophages, or additional supernatant. B lymphocytes activated in vitro by LPS or anti-mu also had augmenting activity. Augmentation of responses was maximal only when activated B lymphocytes were added simultaneously with anti-mu. The interaction between activated and resting B lymphocytes did not appear to be genetically restricted. Interestingly, the augmenting activity of activated B cells could be reconstituted by a combination of supernatant and cell membranes from these cells but not by either alone, suggesting that two components are required, one soluble and the other membrane-bound. Thus, a functional interaction has been demonstrated between B lymphocyte subpopulations which differ in their state of activation, and this interaction appears to involve a novel mechanism of action.\r"

  ".W": "Immunization of DBA/1 mice with type II collagen resulted in typical and progressive arthritis, which is associated with the production of high titer of anti-collagen antibody and the induction of cell-mediated immunity as exemplified by delayed type hypersensitivity response as well as lymphokine production. In contrast, administration of heat-denatured collagen into DBA/1 mice failed to induce the arthritis. These mice produced only marginal antibody, whereas they developed comparable cell-mediated immunity to that induced by immunization with native collagen, and therefore the inoculation of heat-denatured collagen provided the regimen capable of inducing preferentially cell-mediated immunity without the generation of high level of antibody. Inasmuch as administration of antibody induced only marginal and transient joint swelling not associated with typical histologic lesion, the synergistic effect of humoral and cell-mediated immunities was investigated using antibody preparation and the regimen to induce selectively cell-mediated immunity. The results demonstrate that administration of antibody into DBA/1 mice pre-sensitized with heat-denatured collagen resulted in potent and progressive arthritis. Such synergy was further confirmed by the induction of arthritis in T cell-depleted DBA/1 mice that had been adoptively transferred with antibody and lymphoid cells from heat-denatured collagen-sensitized mice. Moreover, it was revealed that the nature of cells capable of transferring cell-mediated immunity was of Thy-1+ and L3T4+ Lyt-2-. These results indicate that anti-collagen antibody and L3T4+ T cell-mediated cellular immunity are crucially required for the perpetuated development of type II collagen-induced arthritis.\r"

  ".W": "The proliferative activity of thymocytes cultured with IL-2 and submitogenic concentrations of PHA is increased by 3- to 10-fold in the presence of IL-4. In contrast, IL-4 alone is unable to induce proliferative activity in thymocyte cultures and its synergistic activity is only apparent to concentrations of IL-2 above 1 U/ml. The costimulatory activity of IL-4 is abrogated by the monoclonal anti-IL-4 antibody 11B11. Furthermore, potentiation of the IL-2-mediated thymocyte proliferation is not seen with IL-1, IL-3, IFN-gamma, and granulocyte-macrophage CSF. Thymocytes are at least as responsive to IL-4 as B cells and the IL-4 costimulatory activity in fractionated thymocytes appears to be restricted mainly to the Lyt-2+/L3T4- population. In contrast, purified resting mature T cells do not respond to IL-4 plus IL-2, although they did proliferate in response to IL-4 in combination with PMA. These findings indicate that thymocytes and mature T cells are responsive to the costimulatory activity of IL-4 under quite different conditions, and that IL-4 may play an important role in thymocyte maturation in the thymus.\r"

  ".W": "We have studied the effects of IL-4 (B cell stimulatory factor 1) on the expression of MHC gene products in normal bone marrow-derived macrophages, peritoneal macrophages, and the myelomonocytic cell line WEHI-3. Using both IL-4-containing T cell supernatant and rIL-4, we have observed significant induction of both class I and class II MHC surface expression (about 1.5- to 4-fold increase) in 2-, 3-, and 4-day cultures of bone marrow-derived macrophages. This induction was also apparent at the mRNA level as assessed by Northern blot analysis using A beta, E alpha, and class I probes. Kinetic analysis revealed that induction of class II mRNA by IL-4 was slower than induction by IFN-gamma, requiring 48 h before a significant increase was noted. The magnitude of MHC induction by IL-4 was not as great as that seen with IFN-gamma, which was found to increase surface expression of MHC antigens two- to eightfold. IL-4 also differs from IFN-gamma in the repertoire of macrophages responsive to it. IL-4 was unable to induce class I or class II expression in either thioglycolate-elicited peritoneal macrophages or WEHI-3 cells whereas IFN-gamma induced MHC antigen expression on both cell types under the same conditions. These data demonstrate that IL-4 is capable of inducing both class I and class II MHC gene products in some, but not all, macrophages.\r"

The helper subset, which produces IL-4 as its autocrine growth factor, proliferates in response to IL-2 or to IL-4 in the presence of IL-1. The inflammatory subset, which produces IL-2 as its autocrine growth factor, proliferates in response to IL-2 and, in the presence of limiting amounts of IL-2, shows increased proliferation in the presence of IL-4. The inflammatory subset does not proliferate in response to IL-1 plus IL-4. This ability to respond to the combination of IL-1 plus IL-4 correlates with the presence of IL-1R on the cloned lines tested. These data suggest that IL-1 may play a controlling role in the clonal expansion of CD4+ T cells of different functional types. This, in turn, suggests means by which the immune response could be directed into humoral or cell-mediated responses.\r"

Although there is little if any constitutive expression of the IL-1 beta, TNF-alpha and CSF-1 genes in freshly isolated monocytes, adherence is sufficient to induce high steady-state levels of mRNA for TNF and c-fos and more slowly that of CSF-1. Expression of mRNA for the CSF-1R gene, c-fms, was transiently down-regulated by 4 h. In contrast, the induction of high levels of IL-1 beta mRNA were achieved independent of culture conditions. Although all of these genes could be induced by adherence, actual secretion of the mediators required the exposure to a second signal derived from LPS. Thus adherence rapidly primes monocytes for a variety of inflammatory responses, the magnitude of which depends on the nature of a second \"activating\" signal. It is likely that some of these products act locally as paracrine or autocrine factors to further regulate the phenotype of the differentiating macrophage.\r"

Nonspecific tumor cell killing cannot be detected either within bulk populations of host-infiltrating cells or in populations enriched for non-adherent lymphocytes. NK activity is also detected in cells infiltrating a syngeneic sponge matrix graft although to a much lesser extent than an allogeneic graft. NK cell functional activity at the graft site precedes the appearance of alloimmune CTL by several days. The surface phenotype of the NK cell is Thy-1.2+ and L3T4- as determined by depleting the various subpopulations with antibody and C. Systemic treatment of sponge-bearing animals with repeated injections of anti-asialo GM1 (AGM1) results in inhibition of both NK activity and CTL activity recovered from the graft on days 5 to 9 after grafting, but on days 11 to 13 after grafting both NK activity and CTL activity are found within the sponge graft. Treatment of sponge-associated cells with anti-AGM1 in vitro or intrasponge injection of anti-AGM1 at various times after grafting eliminates NK activity more readily than alloimmune CTL activity. The intimate association observed between NK cells and alloimmune CTL at the graft site prompts further investigation into the role of NK cells in the allograft response.\r"

  ".W": "To investigate the effects of graft-vs-host reactions (GvHR) on cells in a central lymphoid compartment, GvHR were induced across class I/II or class II only major histocompatibility complex differences utilizing the parent into nonirradiated F1 hybrid (P----F1) model. Thymocytes were subsequently examined during the acute stage of GvHR for the expression of Lyt-2, L3T4, and Ly-6 cell surface molecules. Class I/II \"suppressive\" GvHR resulted in a dramatic decrease (greater than 85%) in total thymocyte numbers by 2 wk after parental cell injection. Although a dramatic decrease in the percentages of Lyt-2 (85%----30%) and L3T4 (95%----50%) expression was observed, the percentage of thymocytes expressing Ly-6 was markedly increased compared to uninjected controls (5%----greater than 80%). This increased percentage was not due solely to a selective loss of Ly-6 negative cells from the thymus, since the actual number of Ly-6 positive cells was greater in GvHR mice than in controls. Class II GvHR during the same time interval resulted in a less dramatic decrease (20 to 60%) in total thymocyte numbers. In addition, the effect on the percentages of Lyt-2 (85%----approximately 70%) and L3T4 (95%----approximately 85) expression was subtle and transient. However, intrathymic Ly-6 expression was again clearly enhanced (5%----20 to 30%). Class I/II \"proliferative\" or \"stimulatory\" GvHR differ from \"suppressive\" reactions in that they are characterized by stimulatory pathologic symptoms and the appearance of autoimmune abnormalities. Such GvHR were found to result in minimal alteration of total thymocyte numbers. Similarly, the percentage expression of Lyt-2 and L3T4 was marginally affected. However, the percentage of Ly-6 expression was increased from 5%----20 to 30% and thus these intrathymic lymphocyte profiles more closely resemble those of class II as compared to class I/II \"suppressive\" GvHR. The present findings therefore demonstrate that major histocompatibility complex differences alone do not necessarily determine the effects of GvHR on recipient thymocytes and that Ly-6 is a useful marker for the early detection of GvHR-associated immunologic events.\r"

  ".W": "The aggregation of a specific class of lymphocyte surface molecules results in patching, capping, and surface modulation of the aggregated ligand. Both CD4, an associative recognition structure found on helper T lymphocytes, and CD3, a component of the T cell receptor complex, are members of this functional subgroup. When 125I-labeled monoclonal antibodies reactive with either CD4 (19Thy 5D7) or CD3 (RW24B6) were bound to T lymphocytes, the subsequent addition of goat anti-mouse Ig resulted in their rapid, temperature-dependent internalization. Whereas the binding of 125I-19Thy 5D7 (anti-CD4) was inhibited by greater than 90% in the presence of unlabeled 19Thy 5D7, no inhibition occurred in the presence of unlabeled antibody reactive with CD3 (RW28C8). We took advantage of the fact that these antibodies were of different isotypes (19Thy 5D7:IgG2a; RW28C8:IgGl) to determine whether the internalization of CD3 induced the comodulation of CD4. T lymphocytes preincubated with 125I-19Thy5D7 (anti-CD4) and unlabeled RA28C8 (anti-CD3) were treated with goat anti-mouse IgGl under conditions shown to quantitatively internalize CD3. After 1 h at 37 degrees C, T lymphocytes had internalized 10.5 +/- 2.6% (n = 3) of their antibody-bound cell surface CD4. After similar incubations with media alone or with goat anti-mouse IgGl in the absence of prebound RW28C8 (anti-CD3), no internalization of CD4 could be detected. Control antibodies reactive with CD45R (2H4, IgGl) also failed to induce the internalization of CD4. Similar results were obtained by using a helper T cell clone (T4C1) that internalized 9.6 +/- 2.8% (n = 3) of its antibody-bound cell surface CD4 in response to CD3 modulation. In a reciprocal experiment, 125I-anti-CD3 (RW24B6, IgG2b) was preincubated with T4Cl cells together with unlabeled anti-CD4 (12T4D11, IgG1) prior to the addition of goat anti-mouse IgGl. The quantitative modulation of CD4 induced the co-internalization of 4.6 +/- 0.6% (n = 3) of cell surface CD3. These results suggest that approximately 5% of the CD3:T cell receptor complexes on helper T lymphocytes are specifically associated with CD4. Furthermore, our results suggest that an average of two CD4 molecules associate with each CD3:T cell receptor complex.\r"

  ".W": "In vivo exposure of human epidermis to UV abrogates the function of T6+DR+ Langerhans cells and induces the appearance of Ag-presenting T6-DR+ OKM5+ cells in the epidermis. Since UV exposure of murine skin results in Ts lymphocyte activation, we investigated the capacity of human epidermal cells (EC) harvested 3 days after in vivo UV exposure to activate regulatory and effector autologous T lymphocyte subsets. T lymphocytes were separated into CD8+ suppressor/cytotoxic lymphocytes and CD4+ helper/inducer lymphocytes by C lysis and panning. The CD4+ subset was further divided by using the 2H4 mAB to obtain CD4+2H4+ lymphocytes (inducers of TS lymphocytes) and CD4+2H4- lymphocytes (inducers of B cell Ig production and inducers of cytotoxic T cells). Unirradiated suction blister-derived EC from control skin (C-EC) and from skin exposed in vivo to UV (UV-EC) were cultured with purified autologous T lymphocyte subsets in the absence of added Ag. The resultant T lymphocyte proliferation was detected by [3H]thymidine uptake. UV-EC were highly effective in the stimulation of CD4+ lymphocytes, whereas C-EC were poor stimulators. The stimulator effect of UV-EC was abrogated after depletion of DR+ UV-EC. When CD4+ lymphocytes were fractionated, UV-EC consistently demonstrated enhanced ability to stimulate suppressor-inducer CD4+2H4+ lymphocytes relative to C-EC. Although less responsive than CD4+2H4+ lymphocytes, CD4+2H4- lymphocytes also demonstrated greater proliferation to UV-EC than to C-EC. Neither UV-EC nor C-EC were able to activate CD8+ lymphocytes devoid of CD4+ lymphocytes. However, after addition of rIL-2 at concentrations that allow binding only to the high affinity IL-2R on T lymphocytes, UV-EC induced vigorous proliferation of CD8+ lymphocytes, whereas C-EC induced only background levels of proliferation. C lysis of leukocytes resident within UV-EC resulted in 66 to 70% reduction of CD8+ lymphocyte proliferation. In conclusion, UV-EC may activate CD8+ lymphocytes by at least two pathways: (1) UV-EC activation of CD4+2H4+ lymphocytes may induce differentiation/proliferation of CD8+ suppressor cells and (2) UV-EC activation of CD4+ cells may induce IL-2 production, that, in combination with UV-induced epidermal leukocytes, stimulates CD8+ cells.\r"

In the present study, we investigated the role of CD4 in the different phases of the cytolytic reaction mediated by human CD4+ class II MHC-specific CTL clones by using a single cell assay. It was found that the anti-CD4+ mAb OKT4A, which blocks cytotoxic reactions by CD4+ CTL clones as measured with a 51Cr release assay, only marginally affects the formation of conjugates. It appeared that OKT4A more strongly blocked the post-binding phase of the cytolytic reaction. In contrast, anti-leukocyte function-associated mAb strongly blocked the formation of conjugates but not the subsequent lytic phase. As was found previously with CD8+ CTL clones, anti-TCR mAb generally did not affect the formation of conjugates. One exception was noted. The activity of a CD4+ CTL clone, HY-640, could not be blocked by OKT4A, but was affected by an anti-TCR mAb. This anti-TCR mAb could partly reduce the formation of conjugates between HY-640 cells and their specific target cells. These results suggest that this clone has a high affinity TCR, which can contribute to the formation of conjugates. Although preincubation of the CTL clones with OKT4A only marginally affects the number of conjugates upon subsequent mixture with target cells, it was observed that incubation at 37 degrees C of preformed conjugates with OKT4A markedly reduced the number of conjugates. This dissociation of preformed conjugates was optimal only after 2 h of incubation. In contrast, an anti-leukocyte function-associated mAb induced a much more rapid dissociation of preformed conjugates.\r"

  ".W": "mAb to rat cytochrome c (cyt c), totaling 556, were produced by individual clones of secondary B lymphocytes from nine groups of five BALB/c mice each in vitro using the splenic focus culture system. Inasmuch as rat and mouse cyt c are identical, these B cells can be considered specific for a self-antigen. The mAb were categorized into specificity groups based on their reactivities with a panel of seven cyts c that differ at two to six amino acid residues. The number of distinct specificities for the native protein was restricted to fewer than 20. Different groups of mice expressed the same specificities at comparable frequencies, including a single dominant one, and the total number of secondary cyt c-specific B cells was constant among groups of mice. This suggests that the acquisition of the secondary B cell specificity repertoire for this self-antigen is regulated. However, it is indeed possible that each specificity group may comprise a number of distinct mAb molecules that have arisen stochastically. Specificities expressed by as few as 1% of the total mAb were observed. Thus, it is likely that the identified specificities reflect the secondary B cell specificity repertoire for rat cyt c. The dominant specificity expressed by 50% of the mAb was characterized by elimination of antigen recognition as a result of replacement of aspartic acid by glutamic acid at position 62. Minor specificities expressed by 19% of the mAb were characterized by more subtle affects of an amino acid change at position 62 and/or an amino acid substitution from rat cyt c at position 60. Antibodies in other specificity groups reacted with epitopes in the region of residues 44 and 47. Whereas substitutions at positions 44, 47, 60, and 62 eliminated recognition by most of the mAb, changes at position 92 and at 103 also appeared to affect the binding of some mAb in the region around residues 60 and 62. The amino acid residues implicated in the recognition by murine mAb of murine cyt c have been shown previously to be involved in the epitopes of foreign mammalian cyt c. Therefore, self-tolerance cannot fully explain the restriction of the epitopes to these regions on foreign mammalian cyt c.\r"

At the mRNA level, B2A2+ DN thymocytes express full length gamma and delta transcripts but no alpha message and only short (1 kb) B transcripts. In contrast, the B2A2- DN subset expresses full length alpha and beta transcripts and minimal levels of delta transcripts.

Suppressor cell activities were assayed for their ability to suppress proliferation in a fresh allogeneic MLC after treatment to prevent their own proliferation. The ability to generate both specific and nonspecific suppressor cells decreased with age, whereas pre-existing suppressor cells were detected in spleens from the majority of the aged animals but not in spleens from young animals. The decrease in suppressor cell activity was not due to any requirement for age matching between donors of suppressor and target cells. The specific and nonspecific MLC-generated suppressor cells inhibited both the proliferative response in the assay MLC and the generation of cytotoxic cells. The pre-existing suppressor cells only suppressed the proliferative response and not the generation of cytotoxic cells. The changes seen with age in these suppressor cell populations suggest that the ability to generate suppression (both allospecific and nonspecific) to newly encountered Ag declines with age, whereas a resident splenic suppressor cell population accumulates over the lifetime of the animals.\r"

  ".W": "As B cells mature during ontogeny the CD22 human differentiation Ag is exported from the cytoplasm onto the membrane. Surface expression is lost in terminal differentiation and after activation. In tonsils, CD22 is expressed on the surface of 60 to 80% of the dense B cells. Some IgM+ dense cells, however, and buoyant in vivo activated B cells are CD22-. This differential expression of CD22 and the finding that an anti-CD22 mAb augmented anti-Ig induced B cell proliferation suggested that CD22 may play a role in B cell activation. In this study we have found that CD22+ but not CD22- B cells could be triggered by anti-IgM or anti-IgD to have increased free intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i). The presence of CD22 rather than of IgD seems to determine the ability of B cells to respond to anti-Ig with a [Ca2+]i flux. Also the proliferative response to anti-Ig or anti-Ig + B cell growth factor was restricted to the CD22+ population. Anti-CD22 mAb, although not inducing [Ca2+]i on their own after binding to B cells, did augment [Ca2+]i fluxes by anti-Ig when cross-linked. Together these results suggest that CD22 may regulate triggering of B cells through surface Ig perhaps by acting as a \"bridge\" to transmit an early signal into the cytoplasm.\r"

We show here that another T cell-surface molecule than CD2 is involved in rosette formation. Four mAb have been obtained reacting with human T cells that block rosettes with E from many species, including autologous cells. They react with a molecule, we termed E2, which is actively synthetized by T and monocytic cells. Immunoprecipitation revealed a major 32-kDa band. Immunoblots revealed a major 32-kDa band and a minor 20-kDa band. This molecule was detected on all T cells tested--and present at high densities on corticothymocytes, but at low densities on medullary thymocytes. It was also found on monocytes but not on B cells. However B-CLL cells did carry this molecule. E2 molecules were also detected on nonhematologic cells. Together with the recent evidence that 3 molecules from the erythrocyte surface are also involved for rosettes, intricate molecular interactions would account for adhesion of T cells to autologous E and possibly autologous nucleated cells.\r"

T cell lines of the helper/inducer class, which were isolated from hepatitis B vaccine recipients, were found to react strongly and in an Ag-specific way with peptides corresponding to a sequence of 10 to 30 amino acids near the amino terminus of the HBsAg molecule. Cells with surface expression of the antigenic determinant contained in these synthetic peptides induced both proliferative and cytotoxic responses in the hepatitis B-specific T cells. The results indicate that amino acid residues 24-27 of HBsAg could be directly involved in this T cell determinant. Inhibition studies with mAb to MHC class II Ag and target cells from various HLA-typed individuals suggest that some T cell responses to this determinant of HBsAg might be restricted by the DPw4 molecule. However, the possibility exists that more than one of the MHC class II molecules could be involved as restricting elements of T cell responses to this synthetic peptide. In vivo experiments with synthetic peptides such as those described here are needed to demonstrate the possibility of enhancing HBsAg immune responses in some individuals.\r"

We studied the clearance and organ localization of small DNA anti-DNA IC formed at different Ag/antibody ratios in normal mice. IC formed at Ag excess, containing areas of \"exposed\" DNA not covered by IgG, showed rapid Ag-mediated clearance from the circulation by the liver. DNAse digestion of these IC in vitro yielded small IC devoid of exposed DNA that were cleared more slowly from the circulation. IC formed at antibody excess were cleared by an Ag-independent mechanism at rates proportional to the number of IgG in the IC. None of the IC studied bound significantly to complement receptors on circulating cells in vivo or in vitro. For all IC, after initial rapid clearance, 10 to 20% of the injected material persisted in the circulation. Analysis of these IC showed that they were processed in vivo to yield complexes similar to those generated by in vitro DNAse digestion. We conclude that IC containing exposed DNA are removed rapidly from the circulation by Ag-mediated clearance. However, in vivo processing of IC occurs to yield smaller IC that are cleared slowly. We propose that these IC containing small DNA may persist in the circulation and accumulate in tissues, thereby playing an important role in the pathogenesis of tissue injury in SLE.\r"

  ".U": "88154490\r", 
  ".W": "We have been studying the effects of tobacco glycoprotein (TGP), a polyphenol-rich glycoprotein isolated from cured tobacco leaves, on the immune system. We have shown previously that mice immunized with TGP produce preferentially antibodies of the IgE isotype and that TGP is a T cell-independent B cell mitogen for mice, which stimulates B cell proliferation and B cell differentiation into Ig-secreting cells. We report herein that TGP stimulates a significant increase in [3H]TdR incorporation by human PBL and by human cord blood lymphocytes. The magnitude of the proliferative response of PBL to TGP does not correlate with the donor's titer of IgE antibodies to TGP, as assayed by a wheal and flare response after an i.d. injection of TGP, neither does it correlate with the donor's smoking history. [3H]TdR uptake is not observed before day 5 of culture, and the response peaks between days 5 and 10 of culture. Analysis of the cellular basis for the proliferative response suggests that T cells are proliferating. Two-parameter analysis by flow cytometry shows that CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+ cells are in the S + G2 + M phases, but not Ig-bearing cells or monocytes. A significant increase in HLA-DR (Ia)-bearing cells is observed on cells in all of the cell cycle phases. This increase coincides with cells entering the S phase. No increase is observed in the expression of the IL-2-R as assayed by the anti-Tac antibody. TGP also stimulates human PBL to differentiate and to produce Ig of the IgM, IgG, and IgA isotypes, without stimulating a detectable B cell proliferative response. The proliferative response of PBL is clearly due to TGP and not to contamination with LPS, because by the limulus amebocyte assay the TGP preparation contains less than 2% LPS, which could not account for the stimulation observed.\r"

  ".W": "Myasthenia gravis (MG) and its animal model, experimental autoimmune MG (EAMG), are T cell-dependent diseases mediated by antibodies against acetylcholine receptor (AChR) on skeletal muscle. Most of the antibodies are directed toward conformation-dependent epitopes on the AChR, whereas T cells recognize denatured AChR. In search of T cell epitopes in EAMG, we tested 24 synthetic peptides covering 62% of the alpha-subunit sequence of Torpedo californica electric organ AChR in the T cell proliferation assay with lymph node cells from rats immunized with AChR. In Lewis rats, 2 of these peptides, [Tyr 100]alpha 100-116 and [Gly 89, Tyr 90]alpha 73-90, strongly stimulated T cells and, of these, [Tyr 100]alpha 100-116 was much more potent; 4 other peptides were weakly mitogenic and 18 were ineffective. None of the 24 synthetic peptides alone stimulated anti-AChR production and, when added to cultures along with AChR, [Tyr 100]alpha 100-116 and [Gly 89, Tyr 90]alpha 73-90 suppressed antibody production. Of twelve cloned T cell lines specific to AChR, 4 responded to [Tyr 100]alpha 100-116, indicating the importance of the epitope in alpha 101-116 in Lewis rats. In three other strains of rats whose responses to AChR and its subunits were similar to those in the Lewis rat, neither [Tyr 100]alpha 100-116 nor [Gly 89, Tyr 90]alpha 73-90 was stimulatory. Instead, completely different sets of peptides stimulated their T cells. When peptides were used as immunogens, each strain (except Lewis rats) responded only to the peptides that stimulated AChR-immune T cells from the same strain. Genetically restricted T cell recognition of AChR peptides in rats suggests that T cells from MG patients with different major histocompatibility haplotypes may recognize different AChR peptides.\r"

  ".W": "An evocation of arthritis by an Ag-specific lymphokine has recently been considered with the description of arthritogenic factor (AF) in rats with collagen arthritis. Because rats with CFA-induced arthritis also exhibit T cell reactivity to native type II collagen, T cell lines specific for this protein were established from CFA-injected rats. Supernatant material from these lines contained a type II collagen-binding lymphokine with functional and biochemical attributes identical with those described for AF, i.e., it was a 65-kDa species cross-reacting immunoprotein possessing the ability to incite an erosive, proliferative synovitis when injected into the knee joint of naive recipients. Similarities were also observed with HPLC and on two-dimensional gels. Lymph node cells from rats with arthritis created by injection of the synthetic adjuvant, CP-20,961 failed to produce AF, suggesting that this material is not a ubiquitous concomitant of inflammatory arthritis in the rat. Test injections into sites contiguous with the ear cartilage plate and into fibroblast-lined s.c. pouches suggested that cartilage was a requisite for the induction of inflammation by AF. These data identify a potentially shared effector pathway in the collagen and adjuvant models. The presence of AF in two frequently used models further supports the hypothesis that Ag-specific lymphokines can create autoimmune disease.\r"

EAE was elicited in all strains of mice tested, but the clinical and histologic features varied. SJL (H-2s) mice had a high incidence of both clinical and histologic disease characterized by early onset of clinical signs. Inguinal lymph node T cells from diseased animals responded specifically [( 3H]thymidine incorporation) to proteolipid protein and not to myelin basic protein. In contrast, BALB/c (H-2d), DBA/1 (H-2q), C57BL/6 (H-2b), AKR (H-2k), CBA (H-2k), C3H (H-2k), B10.BR (H-2k), and C57BR (H-2k) mice showed a later onset of clinical signs and typically a lower disease incidence. However, the most marked variations in disease incidence occurred among BALB/c (H-2d) substrains in which the incidence of EAE ranged from eight of nine (BALB/cPt) to complete resistance (BALB/cWt and BALB/cORNL). Because these BALB/c substrains were initially derived from the same inbred genetic source and are serologically identical at H-2, these results suggest that expression of proteolipid protein-induced EAE in the mouse involves additional loci outside the MHC.\r"

To address this question, we generated mitogen-stimulated T cell clones from normal human lymphoid follicles of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (appendix). Both the T cell clones and clonal supernatants provided preferential help for IgA secretion by PWM-stimulated B cells. Many of these CD3+, CD4+, 4B4+, DR+ helper clones co-expressed Fc-gamma and Fc-alpha R, but there was poor correlation between the expression of Fc-alpha R and IgA help (p = 0.31). Most of the T cell clones helped both IgM+A- and IgM-A+ B cell populations to secrete IgA, suggesting that they mediate switch of isotype-uncommitted B cells as well as post-switch expansion of IgA-committed B cells; however, some of the T cell clones helped IgM+A- B cell populations much more than IgM-A+ B cell populations, suggesting that, in this case, the regulatory effect is predominantly at the level of B cell switch. In all, these results show that the mucosal immune system contains individual T cells which are capable of positively regulating IgA-specific isotype differentiation at two levels of B cell development, thus allowing for efficient generation of IgA-secreting B cells.\r"

A marked splenomegaly due to the accumulation of hemopoietic precursors was seen, but no increase was found in the lymphoid organs in the total number of cells belonging to the T or B lymphocyte lineage, i.e., of L3T4+ or Lyt-2+, or of allospecific cytotoxic T lymphocyte precursor for the T lineage, or of sIg+ or B220+ cells, or of B colony-forming cells for the B lineage; total activity of natural killer and lymphokine-activated killer cells was decreased. In contrast to the splenomegaly, a marked diminution in the number of thymocytes was observed, suggesting that rIL-3 in large amounts does suppress the T lymphopoiesis, perhaps as the result of the selective stimulation of early progenitor cells toward the hemopoietic pathway. rIL-3 perfusion during immunization increased the IgM and IgG responses to a T cell-dependent antigen, human IgG, and prevented tolerance induction by the deaggregated human IgG, although in the same conditions it did not modify the response to a T cell-independent antigen. Our results suggest that in vivo IL-3 does not act directly on lymphocytes or their precursors, but may potentiate the humoral immune response to T cell-dependent antigens, presumably by acting on accessory cells.\r"

IL-1 alpha and -beta mRNA levels were concomitantly suppressed by glucocorticoid treatment, as determined by Northern blotting analysis.

Of two L3T4+ clones that can be induced to become cytolytic by a combination of antigen and IL-1, only one accumulated TNF-beta mRNA in the process. The PC60 rat X mouse T cell hybrid, which becomes cytolytic in response to a combination of IL-1 and IL-2, also failed to accumulate TNF mRNA after stimulation with these agents.

On the other hand, cross-linking of B cell surface Ig R by Ag analogues does not lead to BLAST-2 expression. By utilizing the BLAST-2 induction assay as a positive control for efficient Th-B cell interaction, we have investigated the biochemical basis of human B cell activation mediated by Ag and Th cells. Our data demonstrate that ligands for sIg R, including F(ab')2 goat anti-human IgM and Staphylococcus aureus protein A, stimulate the metabolism of B cell membrane inositol lipids as assessed by: 1) increased [3H]inositol phosphates formation in myo-[3H]inositol-labeled B cells; 2) selective incorporation of [32P]orthophosphate into phosphatidic acid and phosphatidylinositol, but not into phosphatidylethanolamine or phosphatidylcholine; and 3) rapid increase in B cell cytoplasmic ionized Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i). In contrast, direct Th-B cell interaction leads to high intensity BLAST-2 expression on the B cell surface but this response is not mediated by changes in inositol lipid metabolism or [Ca2+]i. Further, Th-B cell interaction does not affect the changes in B cell inositol lipid metabolism or [Ca2+]i triggered by sIg cross-linking. Taken together, our results suggest that Ag and Th cells induce different functional B cell responses by activating distinct second messenger systems within the B cell.\r"

  ".W": "Previous findings support the prediction that drugs which antagonize the action of calcium should inhibit cytolytic T lymphocyte (CTL)-mediated killing without inhibiting the formation of Ag-specific CTL-target cell conjugates. This would contrast with other CTL-inhibiting drugs, nearly all of which inhibit conjugate formation. Testing this prediction, we found that two calcium channel blockers (verapamil and ruthenium red) inhibit killing only when the extracellular calcium concentration is low (100 microM), and, as predicted, do not inhibit conjugate formation. Surprisingly, the esterase inhibitor N alpha-p-tosyl-L-lysine choloromethylketone also inhibited killing without inhibiting conjugate formation. Unexpectedly, we found that the amount of calcium required by CTL varies by four-fold or more. CTL produced in vivo, or by a single Ag stimulation cycle in vitro, require more than 130 microM calcium for optimal killing, whereas 30 microM suffices for CTL primed in vivo plus boosted in vitro. The rate of admission of calcium into the cytoplasm by physiologic channels did not appear to be the limiting factor for the former type of CTL. Recent findings indicate that allospecific CTL produced in vivo may lack cytoplasmic granules, and may kill by an unidentified mechanism distinct from the exocytosis of granules prominent in CTL lines or clones maintained in vitro. The differences in calcium requirements reported here may reflect differences in mechanisms of killing.\r"

  ".W": "Mechanisms involved in modulation of the immune response in persons with chronic Onchocerca volvulus infection are poorly understood. In this study in vitro reactivity of PBMC to O. volvulus antigen (Ovag), streptolysin O (SL-O) and the mitogen PHA was tested in 62 infected individuals (INF), 17 persons living in the endemic area with exposure to the infection, but with no detectable infection (END), and 7 healthy controls (CTRL) in Liberia, West Africa. Mean blastogenic responses to Ovag were minimal and did not differ between the groups. There was, however, heterogenous reactivity to Ovag in the INF and END. For example, individuals with a history of therapy, and half of those less than 17 yr old who were tested, showed high responses. No significant differences in the response to SL-O or PHA were detected between the groups. IL-2 production in response to Ovag was minimal in the majority of infected subjects. Exogenous IL-2 was found to cause a significant increase in mean responses to Ovag and SL-O in INF and END only. Similarly, Ovag did not stimulate IL-1 production in most INF, whereas stimulation with LPS led to significantly greater production of IL-1. Depletion of plastic and nylon wool adherent cells did not increase responses to parasite-related antigen in INF, END or CTRL; however, responses to SL-O were augmented in INF, an effect that was also observed in CTRL. Finally, depletion of CD8 or CD16 cells in INF by C lysis did not increase blastogenic responses. These results indicate that cell-mediated immunity to parasite-related Ag as reflected in lymphocyte responses in vitro is diminished in infected individuals, and that this may be caused by defects in T cell activation.\r"

  ".W": "Experiments were conducted in an effort to determine the ability of B and T lymphocytes to serve as APC for the activation of HSV-primed splenic T cells to become class I-restricted, HSV-specific CTL. The results showed that both freshly isolated splenic B cells as well as LPS and dextran sulfate (L/D)-activated B cells were effective at stimulating the generation of CTL during a 5-day in vitro culture. There was no requirement for the addition of exogenous IL-2 to the culture and, since murine B cells do not appear to express either membrane or secreted IL-1, this lymphokine appears to either not be required for the activation of virus-specific CTL or to be provided by the T cells themselves. When normal B cells were separated into fractions enriched for resting vs activated cells and then tested for their ability to stimulate the generation of HSV-specific CTL, it was found that while the activated B cells were quite effective at stimulating the generation of CTL, resting B cells were ineffective at carrying out this function. In contrast to normal B cells, normal T cells were unable to act as APC. However, Con A-activated T lymphoblasts were equivalent to L/D B cells in their ability to mediate the generation of CTL activity. L/D B cells that had been pulsed with HSV and then incubated at 37 degrees C for greater than 1 h could be fixed with paraformaldehyde and were still able to function as APC. The finding that L/D B cells, that had been fixed at 1 h or less after exposure to HSV, were unable to function as APC suggested that either active Ag \"processing\" steps may be required for the presentation of Ag in the context of class I molecules or that there is a requirement for the synthesis of viral protein Ag before presentation.\r"

Human and rat pneumocystis were not antigenically identical. Specific antibodies against rat P. carinii Ag were found in 18 of 79 rats by the immunoblot method. Specific antibodies against human P. carinii Ag were found in 32 of 33 adult human sera, but in only 1 of 8 sera from infants and children. Specific antibodies were found in sera of 13 of the 14 adults with no history of P. carinii pneumonia, and all 19 patients with recently diagnosed P. carinii pneumonia, including 9 patients with P. carinii pneumonia associated with AIDS. The results of this study support previous suggestions that a large proportion of adults have been exposed to P. carinii and provide a basis for the further investigations of host-P. carinii interactions.\r"

  ".W": "We describe herein functional attributes and generation of immunologic suppressor activity elaborated in response to oncogenic virus infection. Malignant rabbit fibroma virus-induced immunologic suppressor factor (VISF) is a T cell product produced in peak quantities by spleen cells taken from infected rabbits 7 days after infection in vivo. Its production does not appear to require macrophage participation. VISF is highly labile, 3.5 to 12 kDa, and capable of suppressing both B and T lymphocytic responses. Indomethacin and the cyclic nucleotides cAMP and cGMP inhibit its generation. VISF activity is neither antigen nor species specific. It suppresses murine and leporine immune responses to antigens unrelated to the inducing virus. Comparable suppressor activity may be induced by infecting an apparently non-functional rabbit T lymphoma line, RL-5, with malignant rabbit fibroma virus. VISF is principally a suppressor-inducer factor: in vitro, lymphocytes exposed to VISF do not show decreased immunologic responsiveness until 4 days of culture. VISF induces T suppressor cell activity when normal spleen cells are exposed briefly to VISF. Thus, immunosuppressive consequences of malignant fibroma virus infection are partially mediated by a small, non-specific T cell-derived suppressor lymphokine with unique functional characteristics. Non-specific immunologic dysfunction that often attends virus infections may reflect the activity of such factors in humans as well.\r"

The construction and expression of a chimeric class II/class I gene encoding the first two exons of A kappa alpha linked to the C2, TM and cytoplasmic exons of H-2Dd (A kappa alpha 1/DdC2) are described. High levels of A kappa alpha 1/DdC2 protein were detected on transfected L cells with a DdC2-specific mAb. An anti-Ia xenoantiserum specifically bound to A kappa alpha 1/DdC2-transfected L cells, although 12 different mAb reactive against I-A kappa alpha and an anti-Ia kappa alloantiserum did not bind these cells. However, alloreactive Ia kappa-specific CTL lines were able specifically to lyse cells expressing the hybrid A kappa alpha 1/DdC2 molecule. This indicates that the isolated A kappa alpha 1 domain preserves some of the structure of the native molecule and demonstrates the recognition by T cells of domain-specific A alpha allodeterminants.\r"

  ".W": "We investigated the peritumoral inflammatory infiltrate in 22 basal cell carcinoma (BCC) from 18 patients using a series of monoclonal antibodies. In all the 22 BCC the infiltrate consisted mainly of T cells (55 +/- 15%) and only in three cases an invasion of the tumor nests by these cells was observed. The T helper (TH) subset predominated over the T suppressor/cytotoxic (TS/C) subset (TH/TS/C ratio of 1.9 +/- 0.8). In 8 of 22 BCC mild infiltrate was observed with 48 +/- 13% T cells and a TH/TS/C ratio of 1.5 +/- 0.6. In 14 of 22 BCC moderate to heavy infiltrate with 59 +/- 15% T cells and a TH/TS/C ratio of 2.0 +/- 1.0 was observed. There was a significant difference in the percentage of T cells in BCC with moderate to heavy infiltrate and that in BCC with mild infiltration. The mean percentage of HLA-DR+ cells was 54 +/- 11%; Langerhans cells (LC) 4 +/- 5%; and Leu-M5+ (monocytes and macrophages) 16 +/- 11%. Less than 2% Leu-14+(B) cells were seen in the infiltrate. The mean percentage of Leu-7+ (natural killer) cells was 4 +/- 4%, and only 1 of 22 BCC Leu-7+ cells invaded tumor nests, contacting with tumor cells. From these results we concluded that T cells play a major role in the defence against BCC proliferation. The main role of Langerhans cells and Leu-M5+ cells may be that of antigen presentation. B cells and NK cells probably play a minor role in the local defence against BCC proliferation.\r"

Receptor-mediated endocytosis induced by the binding of the monoclonal anti-T6 antibody BL6 involves coated pits, coated vesicles, endosomes, the smooth endoplasmic reticulum, and lysosomes. After RME, gold-labeled Birbeck granules (BGs) appear in the cell center. In the present study, by modifying the experimental conditions but retaining the presence of gold-labeled BL6, we have observed (in addition to the above-mentioned gold-labeled organelles) images that appear to correspond to BG-like structures. These structures, like the intracytoplasmic BGs, are pentalaminar and gold-labeled, but they differ from the intracytoplasmic BGs by their attachment to the cell membrane, their length, the frequent presence of a coat, and by prolongation by one or more coated pits. Birbeck granule-like structures seem to result, at the ultrastructural level, from receptor ligand interactions and from modifications of the LC shape.\r"

In the present study we tried to determine whether the effects on NK cell activity were caused by the UVB or the UVA components of radiation from solarium lamps by filtering out UVB with Mylar sheeting. Groups of 10 normal subjects were either left untreated or exposed for 30 min on 12 consecutive days to radiation that was filtered or not filtered through a 0.1 mm thick Mylar sheeting. NK cell activity was depressed in the group exposed to solarium radiation and this was not prevented by filtration through Mylar. The latter procedure, however, appeared to prevent changes in blood lymphocyte subsets that are induced by solarium radiation as well as the reduction in Langerhans cell numbers in skin biopsies taken after exposure to solarium radiation. Suppression of NK cell activity was evident up to 14 days after cessation of UVR exposure. This would be consistent with the replacement of NK cells from bone marrow that had been damaged as a result of direct effects of UVA on NK cells in the microcirculation of the skin or else indicate functional suppression of NK cells by suppressor cells induced by UVR as postulated for UVR-induced suppression of delayed hypersensitivity responses in murine models. These studies suggest that UVA may be important in the induction of certain effects on the immune system in human subjects. Further studies are required to assess the implications of these findings with respect to induction of neoplasia and the design of sunscreens effective against UVA.\r"

After application of DNFB, there was a homogenous cytoplasmic labeling of all epidermal cells. The intracellular localization of the DNP groups was not restricted to cytoplasmic organelles belonging to the endocytotic - lysosomal system. The numerous endocytotic organelles, Birbeck granules, and lysosomes of the Langerhans cells (LCs) typically observed after application of contact sensitizers also did not show an increased number of gold particles. Skin painting with DNTB resulted in a similar distribution and time-course of immunolabeling, but this compound did not induce cellular and the endocytotic activation of LCs as seen after DNFB application. These results demonstrate that contact sensitizers do not require specific cellular uptake and intracellular processing by the endocytotic - lysosomal compartment of the LCs before membrane presentation. However, a cellular and endocytotic activation of the LCs by haptens may be an important mechanism for T effector cell activation.\r"

Gamma scintillation images were obtained 18 hr postinfusion, and radiation dosimetry estimates were performed. At 24 hr postinfusion, each patient received a 100-mCi 131I-T101 (10 mg) therapy dose. Results obtained after plasmapheresis showed a significant reduction, ranging from 28%-61%, in HAMA titers. Blood clearances were markedly different between initial therapy and retreatment therapy for patient with high HAMA titers, reflecting immune complex formation.

  ".W": "The measurement of glucose utilization rate (GUR) by positron emission tomography (PET) using 18F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) is a valuable method to assess the grade of malignancy of brain tumors. We have designed a feasibility trial to determine whether PET could be used to image and predict the grade of malignancy of human extremity musculoskeletal tumors. Five patients with extremity tumors (four soft-tissue tumors and one osteogenic tumor) were studied. Peak and mean apparent GURs were determined in the tumor region. All tumors were subsequently resected and graded in a standard fashion using the NCI grading system. Peak apparent GURs ranged from 3.3 mg/100 g/min to 15.2 mg/100 g/min, with the highest values found in the high grade tumors. Although the number of patients studied was small, a good correspondence was shown between GURs and histopathologic grading. Our results indicate that PET can be used to image and evaluate the metabolic activity of human musculoskeletal tumors.\r"

  ".W": "A newly developed and validated noninvasive quantitative SPECT method was used to measure the in vivo uptake of [57Co]bleomycin (Co-bleo) in 13 human brain tumors and the uptake of [99mTc]glucoheptonate (GH) in 23 brain tumors. Significant differences in tumor uptake were found. The tumor concentration over time, the tumor to blood radio at 30 min and the tumor cumulative concentration of radioactivity showed marked differences even between tumors with the same histology. Only a weak correlation was found between tumor concentration of Co-bleo and of GH. Therefore a simple imaging agent such as GH cannot, at the present time, serve as an indicator of individual tumor uptake and further experience with other agents is still necessary. Contrary to the generally held view, no correlation was found between the concentration of drug in the blood and its tumor concentration. It is suggested therefore that the level of a drug in the blood cannot be used as a criterion of the amount that will penetrate the tumor. Direct SPECT measurement of the concentration of the drug in the tumor itself should be performed. The bioavailability of a drug is critical in order for it to exert it tumoricidal effect. The results, showing marked differences in uptake between brain tumors, suggest that before chemotherapy is administered, uptake of the chemotherapeutic drug in the individual tumor to be treated should be assessed and comparisons should be made between the uptake of a series of drugs to determine which drug would be most efficacious on the basis of its uptake as well as its tumor cell killing potential.\r"

An axially symmetric phantom consisting of a cylinder with a sphere is imaged with either the cylinder or the sphere containing 99mTc. An iterative peak-erosion algorithm and a fitting algorithm are given and employed to analyze the acquired spectra. Adequate separation into an unscattered component and a Compton-scattered component is judged on the basis of filtered-backprojection reconstruction of corrected projections. In the reconstructions, attenuation correction is based on the known geometry and the total attenuation cross section for water. An independent test of the accuracy of separation is not made. For both algorithms, reconstructed slices for the cold-sphere, hot-surround phantom have the correct shape as confirmed by simulation results that take into account the measured dependence of system resolution on depth. For the inverse phantom, a hot sphere in a cold surround, quantitative results with the fitting algorithm are accurate but with a particular number of iterations of the erosion algorithm are less good. (A greater number of iterations would improve the 26% error with the algorithm, however.) These preliminary results encourage us to believe that a method for correcting for Compton-scattering in a wide variety of objects can be found, thus helping to achieve quantitative SPECT.\r"

Scattered events were acquired with 360-degree rotation of the gamma camera and transverse section images were reconstructed using a filtered backprojection method. The boundary of section images obtained with three different geometric arrangements of the source and the camera were compared. The 90-degree Compton scatter method, using a source external to the cylinder and at 90 degrees to the front of the detector, was found to give the best boundary definition. Similarly, detection of scattered events using a radionuclide source placed outside a human body was capable of providing good boundary information for the large stack of contiguous section images produced by a rotating SPECT camera. Calculations confirmed the profound influence of boundary errors on SPECT quantitations.\r"

However, 67Cu is readily transferred from the usual chelates of EDTA or DTPA to albumen. We developed a new macrocycle (6-p-nitrobenzyl-TETA) to chelate copper. Bifunctional chelating agent p-bromoacetamidobenzyl-TETA was conjugated to Lym-1, a monoclonal antibody against human B cell lymphoma, without significantly altering its immunoreactivity. This conjugate was stably labeled with 67Cu under conditions chosen to optimize the yield of a high specific activity radiopharmaceutical. The biodistribution in RAJI tumor bearing mice demonstrated significant tumor uptake (14.7% ID per gram) and extended residence time (120 hr) in contrast to normal organs. After 24 hr, radioactivity was continuously cleared from all tissues except the tumor. This study suggests 67Cu labeled Lym-1 to be a promising radiopharmaceutical for potential use for radioimmunotherapy of B cell lymphoma.\r"

PET determinations of LV blood-pool activity were compared with dispersion-corrected beta probe time-activity curves. In 15 experiments involving four dogs under a wide range of physiologic conditions, LV time-activity curves obtained with PET matched well in shape with those obtained with the beta probe. Linear regression yielded slopes within 10% of unity (95% confidence interval) and high correlation (r greater than 0.968, p less than 0.001).

This study evaluates the important PET performance parameters of image resolution, true sensitivity, scatter background, accidental background, and realistic maximum radioactivity in the field of view for both BGO and BaF2 in an identical non-time-of-flight, whole-body camera configuration. These performance parameters are evaluated for three phantoms simulating (a) the head, (b) whole-body cross-section and (c) heart/kidney. This study finds that the high stopping power of BGO yields higher sensitivity, higher resolution, less vignetting, better immunity from scattered gamma, and lower accident/true ratio at any dose level. The faster BaF2 timing acceptance window is traded off by its vulnerability to noncoincidental scatter-gamma which increases accidental coincidences. The BGO is found to be a better choice for non-time-of-flight systems especially with large objects which produce a lot of noncoincidental scatter-gammas. This study also found that the practical diminishing return maximum activity within the field-of-view is approximately 20-25 mCi for existing conventional cameras.\r"

Suggesting that partial correlations may not preserve the true (but unknown) intrasubject correlation structure within the brain, others have used a theoretical example to show how an artifactually large negative partial correlation coefficient might arise. Here, we show that such an example is highly unlikely when applied to resting cerebral metabolism, and can be identified in experimental data by testing for a bimodal distribution of partial correlation values. We then show that partial correlations or reference ratio correlations of experimental resting metabolic rates give values which closely approximate the intrasubject correlation coefficients.\r"

Four hours after the once daily morning dose of ketoconazole, the patients had significantly elevated baseline desoxycorticosterone (DOC) and precursor/product ratios, and blunted cortisol and aldosterone responses to ACTH stimulation. Twenty-four hours after ketoconazole ingestion, both DOC and DOC/corticosterone ratio were approaching normal; the cortisol response to ACTH was normal in all but two of the 10 study patients, and these two had significantly improved response compared with their own 4-hour values. There appeared to be no differential adrenal response related to either duration of treatment (greater than 12 vs less than 12 months) or dose of medication per kilogram (greater than 18 or less than 18 mg/kg/d). Our data suggest that ketoconazole impairs production of cortisol and aldosterone by imposing a partial and temporary block at the 11-beta-hydroxylase step of steroid hormone synthesis. None of the patients required adrenal steroid replacement therapy in times of acute illness or surgery, and none had clinical evidence of adrenal insufficiency.\r"

  ".W": "Systemic 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) causes parkinsonism in humans and other primates, but not in rats; mice are intermediate in their susceptibility which varies among strains. We hypothesized previously that the rat's resistance to systemic MPTP toxicity is likely due to the unique enrichment of its blood-brain barrier with enzymes that metabolize MPTP. MPTP metabolites, such as 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+) and 1-methyl-4-phenyl-2,3-dihydropyridinium, may have difficulty in traversing biological membranes and reaching the brain sites of toxicity. We tested this hypothesis by studying MPTP metabolism: 1) in vitro, by human, rat and mouse brain microvessels and 2) in vivo, in the brain and liver of Wistar rats and two strains of mice known to react differently to systemic MPTP. We found that rat brain microvessels were very efficient at converting MPTP to MPP+ and that this conversion was abolished by pargyline. Microvessels from C57 black mice, which are more sensitive to MPTP toxicity than CF1 white mice, were less capable of metabolizing MPTP to MPP+. Human microvessels were least capable of producing MPP+. In vivo metabolism of MPTP in Wistar rats and the two strains of mice showed that the clearance of MPTP and its metabolites from the brains was most rapid in rats, intermediate in white mice and slowest in black mice. On the other hand, liver metabolism of MPTP by the three groups of animals showed a high rate of MPTP metabolism to a compound(s) other than MPP+ in rats, and a lower rate in mice.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The effect of 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP) was investigated at the frog neuromuscular junction to elucidate the mechanism by which mitochondrial inhibitors increase transmitter release. After a prolonged lag time (30 min), DNP (10(-4) M) caused an increase in miniature endplate potential frequency (MEPP F), which peaked within 10 min and then declined toward, but not reaching, control values. The time course and peak effect of the response were not altered by Na and Ca channel blockade [produced by 3 microM tetrodotoxin (TTX) plus 1.8 mM Co++], but the lag time was sufficient to prevent influex of ions at the nerve terminal, as the same concentration caused complete block of a 50-fold MEPP F increase to 15 mM [K+]. The results suggest that mitochondrial inhibitors produce their effect primarily by reversing the Ca++ uniporter and not by a Na+-mediated stimulation of the Na+-Ca++ antiporter. Their mechanism in this regard differs from that underlying the MEPP F increase produced by cardiac glycosides. The long lag time with DNP may be due to Na pump inhibition and nerve terminal swelling, and the shortening of lag time by TTX plus Co++ to an inhibition of Na+ influx and swelling. Finally, the block of MEPP F with TTX plus Co++ indicates that the MEPP F increase with Co++ alone is probably due to entry of Co++ through unblocked Na channels.\r"

  ".W": "This is the first morphological study of interleukin-2-stimulated human peripheral blood mononuclear (PBM) cells resulting in lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cell activity against human glioma-derived tumor cells in vitro, in which high-resolution differential interference video light microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy were used. A subset of cells within the LAK cell population are the effector cells and have an asymmetric cellular architecture characteristic of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and natural killer (NK) cells. Upon binding to target cells, the LAK effector cell nucleus is positioned away from the target cell, whereas the granules, Golgi apparatus, and microtubules orient toward the target cell. These LAK-glioma cell conjugates form very tight plasma membrane bonds with numerous interdigitations, and vesicles were found in the small extracellular spaces between the cells. This morphology was not observed in unstimulated PBM-glioma cell co-cultures. Glioma-derived cells react to LAK effector cells by blebbing, becoming round, and rapidly detaching from the substrate. The injured glioma-derived cells had a highly condensed cytoplasm and chromatin, lobular nucleus, and severe plasma membrane blebs, which are consistent with an apoptotic rather than an osmotic lysis mechanism of cell death. This study provides morphological evidence that supports a common cytotoxic mechanism for CTLs, NK cells, and LAK effector cells. The cytotoxic mechanism is based on the local exocytosis of vesicles by the effector cell into the small extracellular space between the effector-target cell conjugate. Granules found in CTLs, NK cells, and LAK cells contain a pore-forming protein that inserts holes in the target cell's plasma membrane through which a lethal substance(s) not yet identified is thought to enter the cell.\r"

  ".W": "Significant tumor regressions in mice with established carcinomas, sarcomas, and melanomas and in humans with advanced cancers have been observed following immunotherapy with lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells and recombinant interleukin-2 (IL-2). However, dose escalations of LAK cells and IL-2 have been prevented by the development of a vascular leak syndrome (VLS). Although IL-2 alone can produce this VLS, we investigated the role of transferred LAK cells, generated by the incubation of syngeneic splenocytes in IL-2, in mediating this phenomenon. We used a murine model to quantitate the vascular leak by measuring the extravasation of iv injected 125I-bovine serum albumin. A permeability index (PI) was calculated by dividing the mean cpm of tissues from treated mice by those from control animals. The systemic transfer of LAK cells and IL-2 produced a significantly greater extravasation of albumin in the lungs, liver, and kidneys than after Hanks' balanced salt solution, IL-2, or LAK cells alone (in the lungs, for example, PI = 4.7, 1.4, and 1.6 after LAK cells and IL-2, LAK cells alone, and IL-2 alone, respectively). To eliminate the contribution to the leak by host lymphocytes, we irradiated mice before cell transfer. As compared to controls, LAK cells and IL-2 resulted in higher extravasation in the lungs, liver, kidneys, and spleen. However, a similar vascular leak was not observed in the lungs, liver, and kidneys after treatment with IL-2 plus fresh or cultured (without IL-2) splenocytes. Moreover, the combination of IL-2 excipient and LAK cells or IL-2 and irradiated LAK cells did not produce a fluid leak. The development of the VLS by LAK cells was directly related to the dose of concurrently administered IL-2 and the number of injected cells. Depletion of Thy 1.2-positive lymphocytes using antibody and complement prior to generating the LAK cells used in adoptive transfer did not abrogate the VLS in any of the organs tested. Similarly, depletion of L3T4 and Lyt-2 positive cells in vivo using monoclonal antibodies prior to harvesting spleens for generation of LAK cells also had no impact on the VLS. In contrast, in vitro treatment of LAK precursor cells with antibody to asialo-GM-1 plus complement completely eliminated the VLS when the depleted cells were cultured in IL-2 and subsequently transferred.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "There has been a resurgence of interest in the concept of presealing high-porosity knitted Dacron prostheses with an absorbable biologic material. Such a material should provide reliable porosity control, preferably reducing water porosity from 2000 ml/cm2/min to less than 50 ml/cm2/min. It should not interfere with the fibrous and vascular ingrowth that securely anchors the developing pseudointima. In previous studies, we have examined fibrin glue and two forms of aldehyde cross-linked insoluble collagen used as Dacron sealants. We concluded that delayed resorption of the sealant as seen with glutaraldehyde cross-linked insoluble collagen results in undesirable healing characteristics, particularly lack of adhesion between pseudointima and the luminal surface of a prosthesis. This study examines a new sealant. Soluble collagen (gelatin) is treated to reduce the number of free amino groups available for aldehyde cross-linking. It is then weakly cross-linked with an aldehyde mixture and applied to a knitted Dacron prosthesis. Water porosity studies have confirmed satisfactory porosity control. Both rat subcutaneous and canine circulatory implants for 6 months reveal relatively rapid and complete sealant resorption without undesirable modification of the normal healing process of knitted Dacron.\r"

Within one year after this operation, fibrodysplastic aneurysms developed in previously angiographically normal visceral arteries. The patient came to us with massive lower gastrointestinal bleeding caused by rupture of a visceral fibrodysplastic aneurysm of the middle colic artery into the transverse colon. The classification, the origin, the localization, and the natural history of fibrodysplasia are discussed.\r"

To understand the pathogenesis of these tumors better, we determined the immunophenotype of the tumor cells and analyzed tumor-cell DNA for EBV genomes and for lymphoid-cell gene rearrangements. More than 80 percent of the cells in tumors had an activated helper T-cell phenotype (T4, T11, la positive). The EBV genome was found by in situ hybridization in tumor tissue from each patient. Southern blot assay of DNA digests from one patient showed the same pattern as that of the EBV-infected marmoset line, B95-8. DNA digests from two patients showed a monoclonal proliferation of T cells determined on the basis of uniform T-cell-receptor gene rearrangements and a single band for the joined termini of the EBV genome. We conclude that EBV may infect T cells and contribute to lymphomas in selected patients with severe EBV infections.\r"

  ".W": "Human B cell stimulatory factor 2 (BSF-2) was originally characterized and isolated as a T cell-derived factor that caused the terminal maturation of activated B cells to immunoglobulin-producing cells. Molecular cloning of the complementary DNA predicts that BSF-2 is a protein of relative molecular mass (Mr) 26,000 similar or identical to interferon beta 2, hybridoma plasmacytoma growth factor and hepatocyte stimulating factor. IL-6 has been proposed as a name for this molecule. It is now known that BSF-2 has a wide variety of biological functions and that its target cells are not restricted to normal B cells. Responses are also seen in T cells, plasmacytomas, hepatocytes, haematopoietic stem cells, fibroblasts and rat phoeochromocytoma, PC12 (Satoh, T. et al., manuscript in preparation). Of particular interest to this report is that human BSF-2 is a potent growth factor for murine plasmacytomas and hybridomas. This observation suggested to us that constitutive expression of BSF-2 or its receptor could be responsible for the generation of human myelomas. In this study we report that myeloma cells freshly isolated from patients produce BSF-2 and express its receptors. Moreover, anti-BSF-2 antibody inhibits the in vitro growth of myeloma cells. This is direct evidence that an autocrine loop is operating in oncogenesis of human myelomas.\r"

Bovine brain messenger RNA contains a 7.5-kilobase transcript corresponding to the isolated cDNA; a related transcript of the same size is present in mRNA from some but not all human cell lines tested. Southern blot analysis of the bovine genome indicated that one or possibly two genes hybridize to the cloned PLC-148 cDNA. There is a striking sequence similarity between specific regions of PLC-148 and the non-catalytic domain of the non-receptor tyrosine kinases. The newly characterized crk transforming gene of the avian sarcoma virus CT10 also contains extensive sequence similarities with PLC-148.\r"

Of 125 patients with GI perforations treated between 1979 and 1986, 41 (33%) were on steroids, 24 for neurologic disease. Median duration of steroid therapy was 24 days; 20 (91%) of the neurologic patients perforated within 30 days. The steroid group had more free peritoneal involvement (p less than 0.00001), but fewer signs and symptoms of peritonitis (p less than 0.000001) than the nonsteroid group. Seventeen patients were receiving steroids for cord compression; they had significantly more rectosigmoid perforations (p less than 0.014) and associated constipation (p less than 0.000001) than the 108 remaining patients. GI perforation is a less well-recognized complication of steroid therapy in neurologic patients than is GI bleeding though it occurs as frequently, is more difficult to diagnose, and far more serious. In steroid-treated patients, prevention of constipation might avert this serious complication, while early diagnosis will improve the outcome.\r"

Poly(A)-containing RNA from HTC rat hepatoma cells, which have been shown to possess high levels of tumor ALDH, was used as template to synthesize double-stranded cDNA. The cDNA was methylated to protect internal sites. Two different synthetic DNA linkers were added sequentially to the cDNA to insure correct orientation for expression from the lac promoter of pUC8. A library of 100,000 independent members carrying inserts greater than 1 kilobase was obtained. From this library, two apparently identical tumor ALDH clones, differing only in size, were identified with an indirect immunological probe. The larger of the cDNA clones identified, pTALDH, was chosen for further study. Interestingly, since tumor ALDH is a dimeric enzyme, pTALDH directs synthesis of a functional tumor ALDH in the bacterial cell. The cDNA sequence has been confirmed by comparison to the amino acid sequence of tumor ALDH purified from HTC cells.\r"

In murine Swiss 3T3 cells, [D-Arg1,D-Phe5,D-Trp7,9,Leu11]substance P proved to be a bombesin antagonist as judged by the following criteria: (i) inhibition of DNA synthesis induced by gastrin-releasing peptide and other bombesin-like peptides; (ii) inhibition of 125I-labeled gastrin-releasing peptide binding to the bombesin/gastrin-releasing peptide receptor; (iii) reduction in cross-linking of the Mr 75,000-85,000 protein putatively a component of the bombesin/gastrin-releasing peptide receptor; (iv) blocking of early cellular events that precede mitogenesis--calcium mobilization and inhibition of epidermal growth factor binding. [D-Arg1,D-Phe5,D-Trp7,9,Leu11]substance P was 5-fold more potent than the antagonist [D-Arg1,D-Pro2,D-Trp7,9,Leu11]substance P. [D-Arg1,D-Phe5,D-Trp7,9,Leu11]substance P also inhibits mitogenesis induced by vasopressin but not that induced by a variety of other mitogens. Both antagonists reversibly inhibited the growth of small cell lung cancer in vitro in a concentration-dependent manner. Peptide antagonists could, therefore, have far-reaching therapeutic implications.\r"

LMW-BCGF causes a slow [Ca2+]i increase in peripheral blood and tonsillar B cells but has no effect on [Ca2+]i in resting T cells. B-cell [Ca2+]i responses mediated by anti-surface immunoglobulin (sIg) or anti-CD19 are potentiated by LMW-BCGF, but anti-sIg and anti-CD19 do not show additive [Ca2+]i responses. LMW-BCGF- and anti-CD19-induced [Ca2+]i signals are similar to the sIgM or sIgD-mediated signals in that they are inhibited by prior treatment with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. However, LMW-BCGF- and CD19-mediated signals do not depend on the expression of sIg, since they were also observed on sIg-B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells. Both anti-CD19 and LMW-BCGF stimulated in vitro colony formation by ALL cells and showed additive effects when used together. [Ca2+]i responses to LMW-BCGF or CD19 cross-linking were also evident on certain pre-B-cell and lymphoma B-cell lines.\r"

Moreover, several other H-2L-reactive CTL generated independently were also able to recognize H-2Ld either as an intact alloantigen or as a peptide in conjunction with appropriate class I restriction elements. These data demonstrate that an H-2 peptide can reconstitute a CTL target structure and suggest that some alloreactive T cells in fact might be directed against allogeneic class I peptides in the context of a class I framework.\r"

In vitro, the effect of EDF on epidermal cells resulted in an increased number of rapidly proliferating colonies composed mainly of basal keratinocytes. Control cultures grown in the absence of EDF had a high proportion of terminally differentiated cells. In fibroblast cultures EDF inhibited the ability of fibroblasts to cause contraction of collagen sponges by 90%. Epidermal growth factor, basic fibroblast growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, transforming growth factor beta, nerve growth factor, and extracts of WI-38 cells (human embryonic lung fibroblasts) did not have this inhibitory activity. Application of EDF to surgical wounds stimulated extensive migration and proliferation of keratinocytes from remnants of glands, hair follicles, and wound edges. The restoration of complete epidermal coverage of wounds treated with EDF occurred twice as rapidly as that of control wounds. In addition, regenerating dermis in the EDF-treated wounds contained 1/5th to 1/15th as many cells as wounds treated with epidermal growth factor, urogastrone, transforming growth factor, or phosphate-buffered saline. The use of EDF to enhance re-epithelization and to prevent scar formation is proposed.\r"

Forty-four healthy adult men and women were assigned randomly to one of three treatment groups. Group 1 (n = 15) received TENS to appropriate auricular points for wrist pain, Group 2 (n = 14) received TENS to inappropriate (placebo) auricular points, and Group 3 (n = 15) received no TENS. We measured experimental pain threshold at the wrist after an electrical stimulus during one pretreatment and three posttreatment time periods. Group 1 was the only group that had a statistically significant increase (p less than .05) in pain threshold after testing. This increase remained significant for all posttreatment measurements for Group 1. These results suggest that high intensity, low frequency TENS applied to appropriate auricular acupuncture points can increase pain threshold.\r"

They found that the percentage of background subtraction was the single most important factor affecting volume calculation. The smaller the volume, the greater the amount of background subtraction needed before the ROI is drawn. As an acceptable means to circumvent the varying percentage of background subtraction for different volumes, a calibration curve was constructed relating the true volume with the calculated volume for a fixed percentage of background subtraction. The use of a 128 X 128 acquisition matrix and zooming of the reconstructed images were necessary for accurate calculation of volumes smaller than 300 mL.\r"

  ".W": "To determine how soon radiation-induced lung injury is detectable, to compare the CT findings with those on chest radiographs, and to observe the appearance of the abnormality during the acute phase, we performed 83 CT studies in 17 radiotherapy patients at relatively short intervals. All 17 patients received fractionated radiotherapy to the thorax with a large irradiated lung volume. The CT findings were variable; pulmonary infiltrates were homogeneous, patchy, or discrete. CT abnormalities were evident in 15 of 17 cases within 16 weeks after radiotherapy; in 13 of these it was detected within 4 weeks. In three of these 15 cases, no abnormality was detected on chest radiographs, and in three other cases, the change was observed much later on chest radiographs than on CT scans. In the other nine cases, abnormalities were detected simultaneously on CT scans and chest radiographs. In four cases, extensive radiation pneumonitis was observed on CT, but in two of these, the change was misdiagnosed on the chest radiograph. We conclude that CT is useful in the detection of acute radiation-induced pulmonary disease.\r"

  ".W": "For the CT diagnosis of pathologically enlarged nodes, information concerning the size of normal nodes is required. We studied 40 adult cadavers and determined the number and size of normal lymph nodes for each region of the mediastinum, counting all nodes and directly measuring the short and long diameters of each in the transverse plane of the node. The location of each node was classified according to the American Thoracic Society system, and the range and standard maximum sizes of normal lymph nodes in each location were determined. Nodes were found in 90-100% of cadavers in regions 4, 7, and 10; and in 68-85% of cadavers in regions 2 and 6. The average number of lymph nodes found was 3.5-4.8 in regions 4, 6, and 10R; 2.1-2.9 in regions 2, 7, and 10L; and 0.1-1.2 in all other regions. The mean short transverse diameters ranged from 2.4 to 5.6 mm, and the mean long transverse diameters ranged from 3.9 to 10.0 mm. The largest mean short and long transverse diameters were found in region 7, the next largest were in region 10R, followed by regions 4, 5, and 10L. We noted a different maximum normal size of lymph nodes in each region of the mediastinum. The short transverse diameter, which showed a smaller variation, appeared to be a more useful parameter than the long transverse diameter. We propose a standard for maximum normal short transverse diameters for nodes in each region of the mediastinum as follows: 12 mm for nodes in region 7; 10 mm for nodes in regions 4 and 10R; and 8 mm for nodes in other regions. The maximum long transverse diameters showed a wider variation, ranging from 25 to 10 mm.\r"

  ".W": "The interpretations of 314 thoracic aortograms obtained over a 4 1/2-year period for possible traumatic rupture were reviewed to determine the frequency and causes of false-positive examinations. The radiographs and clinical records of all patients whose aortograms were abnormal or equivocal were examined. Two hundred consecutive thoracic aortograms that had been interpreted as normal were reviewed to determine the frequency and character of normal morphologic variations at the aortic isthmus, with particular attention to ductus diverticula, in an attempt to identify means of reducing the number of examinations that were equivocal or false-positive for aortic rupture. Aortic rupture was diagnosed with confidence in 12 patients (4%), and all were surgically proved. Another nine aortograms (3%) were equivocal when standard aortographic criteria for rupture were used. For four of the nine, further imaging studies indicated normal aortas, but five patients underwent thoracotomy. Two of these had aortic rupture, two had ductus diverticula, and one had an ulcerated plaque at the site of aortographic abnormality. Thus, false-positive aortograms led to unnecessary surgery in three cases--1% of all 314 aortograms and 14% of the 21 aortograms that were not clearly normal. In summary, two (14%) of 14 aortic ruptures in our series could not be distinguished at aortography from anatomic variants or disease not requiring surgery. To avoid false-negative diagnosis, we must accept occasional false-positive diagnoses, necessitating exploratory thoracotomy with its attendant risks.\r"
