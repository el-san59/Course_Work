The overall response rate was 74% (37/50), with 25 patients (50%) achieving complete haematological and biochemical remission. These remissions were associated with a good quality of life as measured by performance status, pain grade, and the reversal of humoral immunosuppression. 6 patients died during the VAMP phase and there was 1 death related to HDM. The achievement of complete remission, as defined here, in such a high proportion of patients is exceptional and may represent a useful advance in the management of myeloma.\r"

HBV-specific DNA was detected in ten maternal serum samples, eight samples of colostral whey, eight samples of colostral cells, and one cord blood sample. Four infants of mothers with HBV-DNA-positive colostrum showed low responsiveness to hepatitis B vaccine. The infant whose cord blood was positive for HBV DNA showed low responsiveness to hepatitis B vaccine and subsequently became an HBV carrier. These results suggest the need for further study to evaluate whether breastfeeding is advisable for HBV carriers.\r"

There was no evidence that any form of treatment (ie, vitamin D in high doses, vitamin D plus phosphate supplements, or calcitriol plus phosphate) had any effect on adult height, symptoms, or alkaline phosphatase levels. There was a negative relation between adult height and the number of osteotomies undergone. The complications of treatment, such as renal failure, which occurred secondary to vitamin D intoxication in 3 patients in their twenties, may outweight any possible benefits. Until a treatment is established as effective in controlled trials, it may be better that these patients remain untreated.\r"

Studies of the nature and prevalence of the disorder have been hindered by problems of definition and assessment. In this study 80 unselected stroke patients were assessed for the presence and severity of neglect on the behavioural inattention test. The six subtests of this battery all intercorrelated highly, and a subsequent factor analysis showed that all tests loaded significantly on one underlying factor. The construct of neglect as defined by performance on the battery is therefore robust. Nonetheless, the individual tests differed substantially in their sensitivity. Star cancellation was the most sensitive measure of neglect and correctly diagnosed all patients whose aggregate score on the full battery fell below that of the control population.\r"

  ".W": "To find out the types of atherosclerotic plaques that fissure and where they fissure, plaques from 85 patients who had died from coronary thrombosis were examined histologically. 67 of the plaques contained an eccentric pool of extracellular lipid in the intima; 42 (63%) of these plaques had fissured at the junction of the plaque cap with the more normal intima, and the other 25 (37%) had torn through the centre of the cap. Computer modelling of different forms of plaque showed that at systole eccentric pools of lipid concentrated stress on the plaque cap, especially near the edge of the plaque. When the lipid pool occupied less than 15% of the vessel circumference, and when the plaque cap was less stiff than the adjacent normal intima, the point of maximum stress was over the centre of the plaque. Computer modelling also showed that the distribution of circumferential tensile stress across the intima was radically altered by atherosclerotic plaques. Regions of high circumferential stress correlated well with the site of intimal tears found at necropsy. The histological findings showed that site of tearing was influenced by variation in the mechanical strength of cap tissue due to focal accumulation of foam cells. Focal weak points in the cap would explain tears which were not at the point of maximum stress.\r"

Arterial compliance in non-fish eaters, as measured by doppler ultrasonography, was significantly lower than that in fish eaters in the healthy group, in the NIDDM group, and in the two groups combined. In non-fish eaters an increase in proximal resistance at the common femoral artery and in the posterior tibial artery was significant only in the combined groups and in healthy subjects, respectively. The results support the hypothesis that fish consumption may be important for better arterial wall characteristics.\r"

By multivariate analysis, the time of resection in relation to the menstrual cycle is an independent predictor of the likelihood of future metastatic disease. Patients who underwent resection during the perimenstrual period had a more than quadrupled risk of recurrence and death compared with women operated upon during days 7 to 20 of the menstrual cycle.\r"

Twelve of these patients (30%) had some measurable residual hearing before implantation, although all had profound hearing loss, with no understanding of speech. All patients received a multichannel cochlear implant with all 22 electrodes inserted in each patient by an experienced cochlear implant surgeon. Audiometric testing was repeated between 2 and 24 months after implantation. Pure-tone threshold responses in the implanted ear were significantly reduced postimplant, while pure-tone threshold responses in the nonimplanted ear were stable.\r"

Snoring has caused marriage breakdown and murder. It can lead to hypertension, heart failure, and the obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. Since Ikematsu developed palatopharyngoplasty (PPP) in 1952 and Fujita introduced it to North America in 1981, numerous reports have alluded to its efficacy in the management of snoring. From June 1986 to February 1988, 110 PPP operations were performed at The Wellesley Hospital, University of Toronto. Of these, 58 patients responded to review and questionnaire. Elimination or improvement of their snoring was reported by 75.9% of patients. Complications encountered are discussed. We conclude that palatopharyngoplasty (PPP) is a safe and effective technique in the treatment of problematic snoring.\r"

Graft removal and delayed reconstruction were necessary in only one patient who suffered an infection in the first postoperative week. To date, no delayed complications are known to have occurred in any patient. As anticipated, long-term follow-up has been erratic (6 weeks to 5 years) and only suggestions rather than definite guidelines for the management of the sinus component of the injury can be made. However, this group of patients clearly demonstrates that multiple free autogenous grafts can be safely used for the acute reconstruction of contaminated central craniofacial fractures that are intimately related to the intracranial structures.\r"

Thirty-six 4-cm x 4-cm dorsal skin flaps were raised on guinea pigs and sutured back into place. Eighteen of these flaps were simultaneously treated with a single application of Baker's solution and a 24-hour occlusive tape dressing. A mean of 3.1 cm2 of the nonpeeled flaps necrosed, compared with 6.3 cm2 of the peeled flaps, a statistically significant increase in tissue loss in flaps that were simultaneously chemically peeled. We conclude that application of Baker's solution with an occlusive tape dressing to an acutely raised skin flap impairs skin flap viability and may result in skin flap necrosis.\r"

Results are presented, and the advantages and limitations of this approach are compared and contrasted with those of nasal packing and arterial ligation.

  ".W": "Transposition of the spinal accessory (XI) and facial (VII) nerves has been used successfully in reanimation of facial paralysis, but because of the severity of symptoms associated with denervation of the trapezius muscle, this technique has largely been abandoned. Hypoglossal-facial (XII-VII) nerve anastomosis has now become a more favored procedure; however, the resultant hemiglossal atrophy carries some morbidity. Transposition of the sternocleidomastoid (SCM) branch of the accessory nerve as a way to avoid shoulder paralysis was reported more than 20 years ago with initially excellent results, yet few follow-up studies have been done. Twenty-one fresh cadaver dissections of the accessory nerve-SCM branch and facial nerve were performed to determine if adequate numbers of fascicle groups and sufficient proximal nerve length are available for an adequate end-to-end anastomosis without nerve interposition grafting. This paper presents our anatomic and histologic findings to support the use of proximal SCM nerve anastomosis to distal facial nerve in facial reanimation. When feasible, the use of this technique to correct facial paralysis is encouraged rather than hypoglossal-to-facial nerve anastomotic repair.\r"

Although otitis media is a significant source of sepsis in infants, tympanocentesis is not routinely employed in the work-up of infants with sepsis who have abnormal otoscopic findings. Charts of 40 consecutive infants who had sepsis and were undergoing tympanocentesis as part of their emergency room work-up were reviewed. Results of middle-ear aspirations from these infants, the bacteriology of middle-ear effusions, and the role of this information in their clinical management is presented. In 80% of these patients, clinical management was directly affected by tympanocentesis data. Tympanocentesis is a safe, effective diagnostic and therapeutic procedure with which otolaryngologists can provide important bacteriologic information to the pediatricians who are managing infants with sepsis.\r"

Complete eradication of heterotransplanted human tumors in nude mice was possible if tumors were first \"sensitized\" to Rh-123 and then treated with the Argon laser. Prior to initiation of human testing of this technique, the toxicity and pathological changes in BALB/c mice were tested by an escalating dose schedule after systemic injection of Rh-123. Animals' body weight, blood chemistry, enzymes and organ evaluation for histology, and ultrastructural changes were analyzed for 3 weeks after injection with Rh-123. The results of this study demonstrate that Rh-123 has significant systemic toxicity in BALB/c mice injected at doses of 10 micrograms/g of body weight and above, manifested by chronic weight loss and elevation of muscle enzymes with death of the animals injected at doses higher than 50 micrograms/g of body weight. At doses of 1 micrograms/g of Rh-123, no local or systemic toxicity was observed even after a 3-week follow-up, suggesting that safe and effective tumor sensitization might be possible in humans at this concentration. The high effectiveness of this new technique of photodynamic therapy and the low toxicity of this dye in this preclinical model system suggests that Rh-123 and the Argon laser may represent a powerful new method for treatment of superficial malignancies.\r"

The first spinal nerve in 15 frogs was labeled with extracellular injections of horseradish peroxidase. The brain stem and the posterior root were sectioned serially. The trajectories of the fibers in the central nervous system were reconstructed, and the number and diameters of the fibers in the posterior root were determined. The average number of fibers in the first posterior root was 143 +/- 6.2, their number decreasing exponentially with increased diameter. After entering the spinal cord the fibers were located in the dorsal funiculus. The thick and medium-sized fibers coursed medially in relation to the thin ones, giving collaterals to the spinal cord and to the obex region. The thinnest fibers projected to the reticular formation and nucleus of the solitary tract. Only collaterals from fibers of medium and thick caliber reached the vestibular area in their trajectory to the cerebellum (spinocerebellar fibers). All the vestibular nuclei received collaterals and endings from the spinocerebellar fibers, the ventral nucleus being the most innervated. The total number of branches for the vestibular area, however, was very small. The results of this experiment are correlated with physiological and anatomical findings described in the literature.\r"

The effect of these two EBV isolates on ability of cells to fuse has been studied to determine if there are differences in the biological properties of the different EBV isolates, particularly the isolates obtained from nasopharyngeal carcinoma such as NPC-EBV. The frequency of cell fusion between NPC-EBV-superinfected Raji cells and EBVR-negative epithelial cells (Ad-AH) was increased more than 30-fold in the presence of medium containing 1% dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO). However, the frequency of cell fusion between HR-1-EBV-superinfected Raji cells and Ad-AH cells was unaffected under the same conditions. The data show that differences in the ability of cells to fuse are induced by variants of EBV in response to DMSO. These differences may be important in elucidating the different biological properties of EBV isolates and might have implications for the pathophysiology of EBV-associated illness.\r"

In a double-blind, randomized, crossover study, we compared the effect of an aerosol of the loop diuretic furosemide with that of a placebo on the early (within 60 minutes) and late (4 to 12 hours) asthmatic responses to a specific inhaled allergen. We studied 11 subjects with mild allergic asthma, who had both early and late asthmatic responses to a specific inhaled allergen in a preliminary challenge. After placebo administration, the maximal changes (mean +/- SE) from base line in the forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) and specific airway resistance were, respectively, a decrease of 35 +/- 4 percent and an increase of 288 +/- 56 percent between 0 and 60 minutes after inhalation of the allergen (early response) and a decrease of 35 +/- 5 percent and an increase of 301 +/- 40 percent between 4 and 12 hours (late response). After furosemide administration (4 ml; 10 mg per milliliter), the early response to inhaled allergen was markedly attenuated in all the subjects, and the late response in all but one. The maximal changes in the FEV1 and specific airway resistance were, respectively, a decrease of 11 +/- 2 percent and an increase of 61 +/- 2 percent between 0 and 60 minutes and a decrease of 20 +/- 4 percent and an increase of 178 +/- 25 percent between 4 and 12 hours (P less than 0.05 for all comparisons). No significant differences were seen in the bronchoconstrictor response to inhaled methacholine after furosemide or placebo administration. We conclude that a furosemide-sensitive mechanism in the airways is involved in the pathogenesis of the reactions of patients with allergic asthma. Whether inhaled furosemide might be useful in the treatment of allergic asthma is uncertain and will require further study.\r"

  ".U": "90014987\r", 
  ".W": "The incidence of end-stage renal disease in patients with diabetes mellitus is reportedly higher among blacks than among whites. This finding may be explained by the greater prevalence of diabetes among blacks. The relation of the type of diabetes to the risk of diabetic end-stage renal disease is largely unstudied. We addressed these issues in a study of all the black and white diabetic patients with end-stage renal disease (470 blacks and 861 whites) reported to the Michigan Kidney Registry who began treatment during 1974 through 1983. We also reviewed the medical records of a subpopulation of such patients (284 blacks and 310 whites) who were less than 65 years of age at the start of treatment for end-stage renal disease to determine what type of diabetes they had. In this study, we made use of national data on the prevalence of diabetes. We found that the incidence of diabetic end-stage renal disease was 2.6-fold higher (P less than or equal to 0.0001) among blacks after we adjusted for the higher prevalence of diabetes among blacks, with the excess risk occurring predominantly among blacks with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). Most black patients with diabetic end-stage renal disease had NIDDM (77 percent), whereas most white patients with diabetic end-stage renal disease had insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) (58 percent) (P less than or equal to 0.0005 for the difference between the races). For both races combined, the risk of diabetic end-stage renal disease during the 10-year period we studied was markedly greater for patients with IDDM (5.8 percent) than for those with NIDDM (0.5 percent). Our results indicate an increased risk of diabetic end-stage renal disease among blacks as compared with whites, particularly blacks with NIDDM. Although the risk of diabetic end-stage renal disease is higher in patients with IDDM, the majority of patients with diabetic end-stage renal disease in the population we studied had NIDDM.\r"

  ".W": "Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) has been associated with serious or fatal lymphoproliferative disease in immunocompromised patients. EBV nuclear protein 2 and latent membrane protein are characteristically expressed in B lymphocytes proliferating in vitro in response to growth transformation by EBV. These two proteins are thought to be effectors of lymphocyte growth since they increase the expression of B-lymphocyte activation (CD23) and cell-adhesion (LFA 3 and ICAM 1) molecules in vitro. Using monoclonal antibody-immune microscopy, we have demonstrated that these two EBV proteins and their associated B-lymphocyte activation or adhesion molecules are expressed in the infiltrating B lymphocytes in immunocompromised patients with EBV lymphoproliferative disease. These monoclonal antibodies should be useful in the early diagnosis of EBV lymphoproliferative disease and in distinguishing it from other B-lymphocyte cancers associated with EBV, such as Burkitt's lymphoma. The finding of EBV nuclear protein 2 and latent membrane protein and their associated activation or adhesion molecules provides a further pathophysiologic link between EBV and the proliferation of B lymphocytes in immunocompromised patients.\r"

  ".W": "Diabetes insipidus is a well-recognized complication of Langerhans-cell histiocytosis (histiocytosis X), but its frequency and natural history are not well defined. Of 52 children with histiocytosis whom we studied, 12 (23 percent) had diabetes insipidus. Only two children had diabetes insipidus at presentation with histiocytosis, but the cumulative risk that it would develop during the first four years after the presentation and diagnosis of histiocytosis was found to be 42 percent. Diabetes insipidus occurred most often among children with multisystem disease and those with proptosis. To determine the natural history of diabetes insipidus in children with histiocytosis, we measured the response of urinary arginine vasopressin to water deprivation every six months in 21 children who did not have diabetes insipidus and who had had histiocytosis for less than four years. Five of the 21 children (24 percent) had subnormal responses during the initial test. One subsequently had spontaneous improvement in the functioning of the posterior pituitary, and diabetes insipidus subsequently developed in two, as it did in one of the children who initially had normal function of the posterior pituitary. Two of the children received irradiation to the pituitary within two to four weeks after diabetes insipidus developed, but they had no improvement in pituitary function. However, diabetes insipidus improved transiently during prednisolone therapy in one of these children and improved permanently after etoposide therapy in another child. We conclude that prospective study with the use of a simple water-deprivation test will allow partial defects of posterior-pituitary function to be detected in patients with histiocytosis and will permit a more appropriate evaluation of the effects of therapeutic intervention.\r"

Panic attacks, which do not meet these diagnostic criteria fully, are two to three times more prevalent. Since panic symptoms can mimic those of other medical disorders, patients with these symptoms use medical services frequently. To determine the risk of suicidal ideation and suicide attempts in panic disorder and attacks, we studied a random sample of 18,011 adults drawn from five U.S. communities. Subjects who had panic disorder, as compared with other psychiatric disorders, had more suicidal ideation and suicide attempts, with an adjusted odds ratio for suicide attempts of 2.62 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.83 to 3.74). The odds ratio was 17.99 (95 percent confidence interval, 12.18 to 26.58) when the group with panic disorder was compared with subjects who had no psychiatric disorder. Twenty percent of the subjects with panic disorder and 12 percent of those with panic attacks had made suicide attempts. These results could not be explained by the coexistence of major depression or of alcohol or drug abuse. We conclude that panic disorder and attacks are associated with an increased risk of suicidal ideation and suicide attempts. Physicians working in general medical settings and emergency departments should be alert to this problem.\r"

On the basis of the World Health Organization's criteria, 714 had normal glucose tolerance, 326 had impaired glucose tolerance, and 146 had non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). After adjustment for age, obesity, and family history of diabetes, increased parity was associated with a significantly increased risk of both NIDDM (odds ratio, 1.16 [95 percent confidence interval, 1.04 to 1.29] per pregnancy) and impaired glucose tolerance (odds ratio 1.10 [95 percent confidence interval, 1.01 to 1.19] per pregnancy). Obesity, whether estimated by means of the body-mass index or the waist-hip ratio, was significantly associated with an increased risk of both NIDDM and impaired glucose tolerance, but this factor did not explain the association between parity and diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance; neither the maximal lifetime body-mass index nor the waist-hip ratio was significantly associated with parity in this cohort. We conclude that there is a slight increase in the risk of NIDDM or impaired glucose tolerance with increasing parity many years after childbearing and that this association is not explained by obesity.\r"

Twenty-eight of the men have died, as compared with 8.3 deaths expected. This increased mortality was attributable to asbestos-associated diseases. Fifteen deaths were caused by cancer, as compared with 1.8 expected (relative risk, 8.2; 95 percent confidence interval, 4.6 to 13.4), including eight from lung cancer, five from malignant mesothelioma, and two from other types of cancer. There were seven deaths from nonmalignant respiratory disease, as compared with 0.5 expected (relative risk, 14.7; 95 percent confidence interval, 5.9 to 30.3), of which five were due primarily to asbestosis. In contrast, the mortality rates from cardiovascular diseases and all other causes were not increased. Four of the five living workers have pulmonary asbestosis; three of them have recently diagnosed cancers, including two additional lung cancers. We conclude that the extremely high morbidity and mortality in these workers were caused by intense exposure to crocidolite asbestos fibers.\r"

We studied the incidence of breast cancer prospectively in a cohort of 1201 women who received x-ray treatment in infancy for an enlarged thymus gland and in their 2469 nonirradiated sisters. After an average of 36 years of follow-up, there were 22 breast cancers in the irradiated group and 12 among their sisters, yielding an adjusted rate ratio of 3.6 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.8 to 7.3). The estimated mean absorbed dose of radiation to the breast was 0.69 Gy. The first breast cancer was diagnosed 28 years after irradiation. The dose-response relation was linear (P less than 0.0001), with a relative risk of 3.48 for 1 Gy of radiation (95 percent confidence interval, 2.1 to 6.2) and an additive excess risk of 5.7 per 10(4) person-years per gray (95 percent confidence interval, 2.9 to 9.5). We conclude that exposure of the female breast to ionizing radiation in infancy increases the risk of breast cancer later in life.\r"

  ".W": "The increasing use of mammography to screen asymptomatic women makes it important to know the risk of breast cancer associated with exposure to low levels of ionizing radiation. We examined the mortality from breast cancer in a cohort of 31,710 women who had been treated for tuberculosis at Canadian sanatoriums between 1930 and 1952. A substantial proportion (26.4 percent) had received radiation doses to the breast of 10 cGy or more from repeated fluoroscopic examinations during therapeutic pneumothoraxes. Women exposed to greater than or equal to 10 cGy of radiation had a relative risk of death from breast cancer of 1.36, as compared with those exposed to less than 10 cGy (95 percent confidence interval, 1.11 to 1.67; P = 0.001). The data were most consistent with a linear dose-response relation. The risk was greatest among women who had been exposed to radiation when they were between 10 and 14 years of age; they had a relative risk of 4.5 per gray, and an additive risk of 6.1 per 10(4) person-years per gray. With increasing age at first exposure, there was substantially less excess risk, and the radiation effect appeared to peak approximately 25 to 34 years after the first exposure. Our additive model for lifetime risk predicts that exposure to 1 cGy at the age of 40 increases the number of deaths from breast cancer by 42 per million women. We conclude that the risk of breast cancer associated with radiation decreases sharply with increasing age at exposure and that even a small benefit to women of screening mammography would outweigh any possible risk of radiation-induced breast cancer.\r"

  ".W": "To determine whether day-care workers acquire cytomegalovirus infection from the children they care for, we studied 610 women employed at 34 day-care centers over two years. Forty-one percent of the caretakers were seropositive for cytomegalovirus. After adjustment for the effects of race, marital status, and age on seropositivity, the women who cared for children younger than two years of age had a significantly higher seropositivity rate (46 percent) than the women who cared for children older than two years of age (35 percent) (relative risk, 1.29; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.05 to 1.57; P less than 0.02). Of 202 initially seronegative caretakers (observed for an average of 305 days per woman), 19 seroconverted, for an annual seroconversion rate of 11 percent. This rate was significantly higher than the 2 percent annual rate of seroconversion among 229 seronegative women (11 of whom seroconverted) in a comparison group of female hospital employees observed for an average of 781 days per woman (relative risk, 5.0; 95 percent confidence interval, 2.4 to 10.5; P less than 0.001). At three day-care centers in which the children were also studied, seven of the nine women shed isolates of cytomegalovirus in their saliva or urine that had EcoRI and BamHI DNA-digestion patterns identical to the DNA patterns of isolates shed by one or more children in their care. We conclude that workers in day-care centers may acquire cytomegalovirus infection from the children in their care and that this risk is significantly greater among those who care for children less than two years of age.\r"

  ".W": "Patients who undergo peripheral vascular surgery are at increased risk for postoperative cardiac events and are difficult to assess preoperatively because of limitations on their activity. We prospectively studied 176 consecutive eligible patients undergoing elective vascular surgery to determine the value in predicting a postoperative cardiac event of preoperative electrocardiographic monitoring to detect myocardial ischemia. Of the 176 patients, 32 (18 percent) had 75 episodes of monitored ischemic ST-segment depression preoperatively (of which 73 were asymptomatic), and 13 (7 percent) met strict criteria for major postoperative cardiac events, including 1 with a fatal myocardial infarction, 3 with nonfatal infarctions, 4 with unstable angina, and 5 with ischemic pulmonary edema. Of the 32 patients with ischemia before their operations, 12 had postoperative events (univariate relative risk, 54; 95 percent confidence interval, 7.2 to 400). Only 1 postoperative event occurred among 144 patients who did not have preoperative ischemia. The sensitivity of preoperative ischemia was 92 percent, the specificity 88 percent, the predictive value of a positive result 38 percent, and the predictive value of a negative result 99 percent. In multivariate analyses, preoperative ischemia was the most significant correlate of postoperative cardiac events and remained a statistically significant independent correlate even after we had controlled for all other preoperative factors (multivariate relative risk, 24.4; 95 percent confidence interval, 6.8 to 88). These preliminary data suggest that preoperative electrocardiographic monitoring to detect episodes of myocardial ischemia is a useful method for assessing cardiac risk in patients who undergo elective vascular surgery. In particular, the absence of ischemia during monitoring indicates a very low risk.\r"

  ".W": "Since 1975 nearly 1 million persons have entered the United States from Southeast Asia, where infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) is hyperendemic. To evaluate the prevalence and patterns of transmission of HBV infection among the children of refugees from Southeast Asia, we studied 196 refugee families with 257 children born in the United States. Of 31 children born in the United States to mothers with infectious disease, 17 (55 percent) had been infected with HBV. Of 226 children whose mothers did not have infectious disease, 15 had HBV infection--a prevalence of 6.6 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 4.1 to 10.7). The risk of infection was greatest (26 percent) among children living in households with children with infectious disease (relative risk, 5.5; confidence interval, 2.3 to 13.4). Exposure to fathers or other adults with infectious disease was not significantly associated with infection. Of children from households with no persons with infectious disease, 3.9 percent (confidence interval, 1.7 to 8.8) were infected. Nearly half (46 percent) the cases of HBV infection among the U.S.-born children of refugees were not attributable to perinatal transmission from a mother with infectious disease. We conclude that child-to-child transmission may be occurring within and between households. Current recommendations to immunize the newborns of mothers with infectious disease are not sufficient to protect all U.S.-born children of Southeast Asian refugees from HBV infection early in life, when the risk of chronic sequelae and premature death is highest. We recommend that the HBV vaccination policy be expanded to include all newborns of Southeast Asian immigrants.\r"

The molecular and structural mechanisms of these movements are uncertain. Dictyostelium discoideum contains two forms of myosin. Here we show by immunofluorescence microscopy that non-filamentous myosin I occurs at the leading edges of the lamellipodial projections of migrating Dictyostelium amoebae, which are devoid of myosin II, whereas filamentous myosin II is concentrated in the posterior of the cells. On the basis of these locations of the two forms of myosin and their known biochemical and biophysical properties, we suggest that actomyosin I may contribute to the forces that cause extension at the leading edge of a motile cell, while the contraction of actomyosin II at the rear squeezes the cell mass forward. Myosin I isozymes might have similar roles in metazoan cells, for example at the leading edges of neuronal growth cones, and in the extension of lamellipodia and pseudopodia of leukocytes, macrophages and fibroblasts.\r"

Here we report that the Kruppel (Kr) gene product (Kr) binds to the sequence AAGGGGTTAA, whereas the hunchback (hb) gene product (Hb) recognizes the consensus ACNCAAAAAANTA. We have identified binding sites for these proteins upstream of the two hb promoters, which we suggest could mediate the repression of hb by Kr and perhaps allow hb to influence its own expression.\r"

  ".W": "Segmental pattern formation in Drosophila proceeds in a hierarchical manner whereby the embryo is stepwise divided into progressively finer regions until it reaches its final metameric form. Maternal genes initiate this process by imparting on the egg a distinct antero-posterior polarity and by directing from the two polar centres the activities of the zygotic genes. The anterior system is strictly dependent on the product of the maternal gene bicoid (bcd), without which all pattern elements in the anterior region of the embryo fail to develop. The posterior system seems to lack such a morphogen. Rather, the known posterior maternal determinants simply define the boundaries within which abdominal segmentation can occur, and the process that actively generates the abdominal body pattern may be entirely due to the interactions between the zygotic genes. The most likely candidates among the zygotic genes that could fulfil the role of initiating the posterior pattern-forming process are the gap genes, as they are the first segmentation genes to be expressed in the embryo. Here we describe the interactions between the gap genes Kruppel (Kr), knirps (kni) and tailless (tll). We show that kni expression is repressed by tll activity, whereas it is directly enhanced by Kr activity. Thus, Kr activity is present throughout the domain of kni expression and forms a long-range protein gradient, which in combination with kni activity is required for abdominal segmentation of the embryo.\r"

The promoter sequences that are sufficient for generating this spatially restricted pattern of expression are located within 669 base pairs upstream of the transcription start site. Multiple transcriptional activators and repressors interact with this 'zebra-stripe' promoter unit to bring about the positional specificity of ftz transcription. Here we report that the homoeodomain-containing protein encoded by caudal (cad) is one such regulator. The cad gene product can increase the level of ftz transcription in the posterior half of the embryo by interacting with multiple copies of a TTTATG consensus sequence located in the zebra-stripe unit. This result demonstrates one pathway by which the product of a maternally expressed segmentation gene, expressed in an antero-posterior concentration gradient, can directly regulate the expression of a pair-rule gene.\r"

This effect of chromosomal position on gene expression may reflect the organization of chromosomes into topologically constrained loops and functional domains. To assess the biological significance of these loop domains, the anchorage of DNA to the nuclear scaffold has been studied at specific gene loci. We have previously defined cis-acting regions flanking the chicken lysozyme-gene domain that mediate the attachment of the chromatin to the nuclear scaffold. These 'A-elements' map to the 5' and 3' boundaries of the region of general DNase sensitivity in the active chromatin, which contains the lysozyme gene and its cis-regulatory elements. Here we report that when a reporter gene is flanked by 5' A-elements from the lysozyme gene, its expression in stably transfected cells is significantly elevated and is independent of chromosomal position.\r"

  ".U": "90015121\r", 
  ".W": "Neurons and other cells, such as those of epithelia, accumulate particular proteins in spatially discrete domains of the plasma membrane. This enrichment is probably important for localization of function, but it is not clear how it is accomplished. One proposal for epithelial cells is that proteins contain targeting signals which guide preferential accumulation in basal or apical membranes. The growth-cone membrane of a neuron serves as a specialized transduction system, which helps to convert cues from its environment into regulated growth. Because it can be physically separated from the cell soma, it has been possible to show that the growth-cone membrane contains a restricted set of total cellular proteins, although, to our knowledge, no proteins are limited to that structure. One of the most prominent proteins in the growth-cone membrane is GAP-43. Basi et al. have suggested that the N-terminus of GAP-43 might be important for the binding of GAP-43 to the growth-cone membrane. Skene and Virag recently found that the cysteines in the N-terminus are fatty-acylated and that this post-translational modification correlates with membrane-binding ability. We investigated the binding of GAP-43 to the growth-cone membrane by mutational analysis and by laser-scanning confocal microscopy of fusion proteins that included regions of GAP-43 and chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT). We found that a short stretch of the GAP-43 N-terminus suffices to direct accumulation in growth-cone membranes, especially in the filopodia. This supports a previous proposal for the importance of this region of GAP-43 in determining the membrane distribution of GAP-43.\r"

Although the action of acetylcholine at muscarinic receptor has been well characterized, relatively little is known at the cellular level concerning nicotinic receptor stimulation in brain. Central nicotinic receptors have been implicated in Alzheimer's disease, seizure activity, the generation of slow-wave theta rhythm in the hippocampus and the potential abuse liability of nicotine. At the neuronal level, nicotinic agonists have been most often associated with postsynaptically mediated excitation and membrane depolarization at various sites, including Renshaw spinal motoneurons, locus coeruleus and the medial habenular nucleus. Nicotine acting presynaptically can produce either excitation or inhibition indirectly through the release of endogeneous transmitters or modulators. Whereas a direct inhibitory effect of nicotine has been suggested by one in vivo extracellular recording study in rat cerebellar Purkinje neurons, the mechanism(s) underlying this action is not yet known. We now report our findings obtained using in vitro intracellular methods in a submerged brain slice preparation in which application of nicotinic agonists to rat dorsolateral septal neurons reveal a direct membrane hyperpolarization mediated by an increase in potassium conductance.\r"

The central nervous system is formed subsequently from the neurogenic region of the ectoderm, in which progenitor cells of the neuroblasts and ventral epidermis are intermingled. Two classes of genes govern the segregation of neuroblasts and peripheral sensory organs. The pro-neural class of genes, for example, the achaete-scute complex, participates in the initial decision to make each uniquely positioned neuroblast or sensory organ, but are initially expressed in groups of cells. The segregation of a neuroblast or sensory organ from an equivalent group of equipotential cells involves a mechanism of lateral inhibition whereby the future epidermal cells are prevented from engaging in the primary dominant neural fate. In the absence of this inhibitory signal, all cells of the group will become neural by default. The neurogenic class of genes is thought to mediate these cell interactions. Here we report that cells in embryos mutant for shaggy which are unable to adopt any of the early initial fates, instead develop neural characteristics.\r"

Of the guanine residues, all of which show equal reactivity towards the carcinogen, only binding to the 3'-most proximal guanine within the NarI site is able to trigger the frameshift event. We selected the non-palindromic dodecamer d(ACCGGCGCCACA), whose sequence corresponds to the most mutagenic NarI site in pBR322 DNA; for X-ray structure analysis. Its molecular structure determined at 2.8 A resolution reveals significant deviations from the structure of canonical B-form DNA, with partial opening of three G-C base pairs, high propeller twist values and sequence-dependent three-centred hydrogen bonds. This crystal structure shows a novel kind of packing in which helices are locked together by groove-backbone interactions. The partial opening of G-C base pairs is induced by interactions of phosphate anionic oxygen atoms with the amino group of cytosine bases. This provides a model for close approach of DNA molecules during biological processes, such as recombination.\r"

  ".U": "90015165\r", 
  ".W": "The auditory system of the horseshoe bat is finely tuned to the bat's individual vocalization frequency. To compensate for flight-induced Doppler shifts in the echo frequency, the horseshoe bat adjusts the frequency of its echo-location call to maintain the echo frequency within the narrow range to which its auditory system is best tuned. In this report I describe neurons in the midbrain tegmentum of the horseshoe bat, with properties that strongly indicate their involvement in this Doppler-shift compensation. The activity of these neurons was influenced by both sound emission and auditory stimuli. Neuronal discharges in response to vocalization, however, differed from those in response to purely auditory stimuli that mimicked the bat call. When an auditory stimulus was temporally locked to a preceding vocalization, the response was dependent on the time delay between the two. This delay-sensitivity completely disappeared when vocalizations were simulated acoustically. Only those vocalization and 'echo' parameters were encoded that occur in Doppler-shift compensation. In conclusion, I suggest a model for the regulation of the vocalization frequency through auditory feedback.\r"

  ".W": "The dynamic response of nerve cells to synaptic activation and the spatial distribution of biochemical processes regulated by ion concentration are critically dependent on the cell-surface distribution of ion channels. In the hippocampus, intracellular calcium-ion concentration is thought to influence the biochemical events associated with kindling, excitotoxicity, and long-term potentiation. Computer models of hippocampal pyramidal cells also indicate that calcium-channel location influences dynamic characteristics such as bursting. Here, we have used in situ microfluorometric imaging in brain slices to directly measure the spatial distribution of calcium accumulation in guinea-pig CA1 pyramidal cells during trains of orthodromic synaptic stimulation. Calcium accumulation is substantial throughout the entire proximal section of the apical and basal dendrites. Most of this accumulation results from influx through non-NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) voltage-gated calcium channels, and in the apical dendrite it drops steeply as the dendrite enters stratum moleculare, the termination zone of perforant path afferents. These results demonstrate a marked segregation of calcium-channel activity and directly show a spatial distribution of calcium accumulation during orthodromic synaptic activation.\r"

  ".W": "Since the isolation of an HIV-2-related virus from captive macaques (SIVMAC), the origin of human immunodeficiency viruses, a much debated subject, has been attributed to monkeys. The sequence of SIVAGM, which is derived from a naturally infected African green monkey, shows equal relatedness to HIV-1 and HIV-2, suggesting that the derivation of these viruses from SIVAGM is unlikely. Recent sequence analysis of SIV from a captive sooty mangabey (SIVMAC), however, shows its close relatedness to HIV-2 and SIVMAC, indicating a possible origin of HIV-2 and SIVMAC from SIVSM (refs 4, 7, 9). We report here the sequence of a novel simian lentivirus, SIVMND, isolated from a wild-caught mandrill in Africa. It is distinct from the three other main groups, HIV-1, HIV-2/SIVMAC/SIVSM and SIVAGM, and therefore represents a fourth main group of primate lentiviruses. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that these four main virus groups might have diverged from a common ancestor at about the same time, long before the spread of AIDS in humans.\r"

We immunized Lewis rats with a synthetic peptide representing a hypervariable region of the TCR V beta 8 molecule. Subsequent induction of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, a paralytic disease of the central nervous system mediated primarily by V beta 8+ T cells specific for myelin basic protein was prevented. T cells specific for the TCR V beta 8 peptide conferred passive protection against the disease to naive rats, apparently by shifting the predominant T-cell response away from the major encephalitogenic epitope of basic protein. This is the first report demonstrating the use of a synthetic TCR V-region peptide to induce specific regulatory immunity and has important implications for the regulation of human disease characterized by common TCR V-gene usage.\r"

  ".W": "We have investigated the role of cytoskeletal contraction in the capping of surface proteins crosslinked by concanavalin A on mutant Dictyostelium cells lacking conventional myosin. Measurements of cellular deformability to indicate the development of cortical tension show that cells of the wild-type parental strain, AX4, stiffen early during capping and relax back towards the softer resting state as the process is completed. Mutant cells lacking myosin (mhcA-) have a lower resting-state stiffness, and fail to stiffen and to cap crosslinked proteins on binding concanavalin A. Hence conventional myosin is essential both for capping and for the concomitant increase in cell stiffness. Furthermore, depletion of cellular ATP by azide causes a 'rigor' contraction in AX4 cells which makes them stiffen and become spherical. By contrast, the mhcA- cells fail to respond in these ways. These measurements of cortical tension in non-muscle cells can thus be directly correlated with the presence of conventional myosin, demonstrating that contractile tension generated by myosin can drive both a change of cell shape and the capping of crosslinked surface receptors.\r"

Halogenated species also contribute to global warming. The significance of the anaesthetics in stratospheric ozone loss or in 'greenhouse' heating depends on their atmospheric lifetimes. Because reaction with hydroxyl (OH) radicals is likely to be the main homogeneous sink for these species in the troposphere, we have measured absolute rates of reaction with OH. Comparison with a one-dimensional model indicates that the lifetimes of halothane, enflurane and isoflurane with respect to this reaction are 2, 6 and 5 years, respectively. Thus the small production of the anaesthetics is not offset by anomalously long atmospheric lifetimes to give a large atmospheric burden of the compounds. The anaesthetics will contribute at most a fraction of approximately 5 x 10(-4) to the total atmospheric content of chlorine-containing species.\r"

  ".W": "It has long been contentious whether the large representation of the fovea in the primate visual cortex (V1) indicates a selective magnification of this part of the retina, or whether it merely reflects the density of retinal ganglion cells. The measurement of the retinal ganglion-cell density is complicated by lateral displacements of cells around the fovea and the presence of displaced amacrine cells in the ganglion cell layer. We have now identified displaced amacrine cells by GABA immunohistochemistry and by retrograde degeneration of ganglion cells. By reconstructing the fovea from serial sections, we were able to compare the densities of cones, cone pedicles and ganglion cells; in this way we found that there are more than three ganglion cells per foveal cone. Between the central and the peripheral retina, the ganglion cell density changes by a factor of 1,000-2,000, which is within the range of estimates of the cortical magnification factor. There is therefore no need to postulate a selective magnification of the fovea in the geniculate and/or the visual cortex.\r"

  ".W": "Many regions of the mammalian brain are characterized by iterated ensembles of nerve cells which can be distinguished anatomically and physiologically. A particularly striking example is the pattern of glomeruli in the olfactory bulbs; other instances are columns and 'blobs' in the visual cortex, barrels and columns in the somatosensory cortex, and striasomes and cell islands in the neostriatum. Understanding the generation of these neuronal ensembles has a bearing on a variety of important neurobiological problems, including the nature of critical periods, the age-dependent response of the nervous system to injury and the manner in which neural information is stored. Analysis of these issues has usually been restricted to studies of the brains of different individuals at various ages. Many questions about the formation of such units, however, can only be answered by observing the same brain repeatedly in a living animal. This strategy would enable a direct assessment of how these units are assembled, whether the initial ensembles persist and whether units are lost or gained as an animal matures. We have succeeded in studying the pattern of glomeruli in the mouse olfactory bulb on two separate occasions during postnatal development. Comparison of the patterns observed at intervals of up to three weeks show that this part of the brain is gradually constructed by the addition of new glomeruli to a persisting population.\r"

  ".W": "T lymphocytes differentiate in the thymus, where functionally immature, CD4+CD8+ (double positive) thymocytes develop into functionally mature CD4+ helper cells and CD8+ cytotoxic (single positive) T cells. The thymus is the site where self-reactive T cells are negatively selected (clonally deleted) and where T cells with the capacity to recognize foreign antigens in association with self-proteins encoded by the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) are positively selected. The net result of these developmental pathways is a T-cell repertoire that is both self-tolerant and self-restricted. One unresolved issue is the identity of the thymic stromal cells that mediate the negative and positive selection of the T-cell repertoire. Previous work has pointed to a bone-marrow-derived macrophage or dendritic cell as the inducer of tolerance, whereas a radiation-resistant, deoxyguanosine-resistant thymic cell seems to mediate the positive selection of self-MHC restricted T cells. Thymic stromal cells in the cortex interact with the T-cell antigen receptor on thymocytes. Using several strains of transgenic mice that express the class II MHC molecule I-E in specific regions of the thymus, we show directly that the positive selection of T cells is mediated by an I-E-bearing cell in the thymic cortex.\r"

  ".W": "In urodele amphibians, the progenitor cells that regenerate amputated limbs (known as the blastema) normally replace only the missing structures. After systemic delivery of retinoic acid (RA), more proximal structures are also formed, indicating that RA can control position specification in the proximal-distal axis of the regenerating limb. According to dose and experimental context, retinoids can also re-specify the anteroposterior axis of the limb, induce deletions of skeletal elements, or block re-growth completely. To study the molecular basis of these morphogenetic effects, we screened complementary DNA libraries of newt regenerative tissues (limbs and tails) for hormone nuclear receptors activated by RA. Two functional retinoic acid receptors (RARs) were identified, one of which is the newt homologue of the human alpha-receptor (RAR alpha). The second receptor, called RAR delta, is novel. Sequence analysis suggests that the composite newt RAR previously reported is chimaeric, consisting of 5'RAR-beta-like and 3' RAR delta clones. We conclude that multiple RARs are expressed during limb regeneration in amphibians and suggest that receptor heterogeneity may underlie the different effects of retinoids on limb morphogenesis.\r"

  ".U": "90015191\r", 
  ".W": "A key question concerning the mechanism of transcriptional activation by enhancers is about the role of the DNA that connects the enhancer to the promoter. The linking DNA will be important if a regulatory protein(s) binds to the enhancer and then tracks or slides along the DNA to the promoter, or if, on binding, the protein(s) alters the topological state of the DNA. By contrast, if the linking DNA loops out to allow the formation of a promoter-enhancer complex, or if the enhancer increases the local concentration of a transcription factor, co-linearity of the promoter and the enhancer will not be strictly required. In Xenopus laevis, the transcription of the ribosomal RNA genes is stimulated by an enhancer composed of repetitive sequences in the intergenic spacer regions. These repetitive elements contain 60 or 81 base pairs, and their activity is relatively independent of their position and orientation. When the enhancer and promoter sequences are each located on separate DNA molecules, however, the enhancer is no longer able to augment transcription. We have now tested whether or not this apparent requirement for having the enhancer and promoter in cis can be overcome by keeping them in close proximity while locating them separately on different molecules. This was achieved by generating multiply intertwined, dimeric-catenanes in which the enhancer and promoter were located in trans on different rings. By injecting these catenanes into frog oocytes and measuring the activity of the enhancers in a series of competition assays, we were able to demonstrate that such enhancers can augment transcription in vivo.\r"

  ".W": "T lymphocytes are predisposed to recognition of foreign protein fragments bound to cell-surface molecules encoded by the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). There is now compelling evidence that this specificity is a consequence of a selection process operating on developing T lymphocytes in the thymus. As a result of this positive selection, thymocytes that express antigen receptors with a threshold affinity for self MHC-encoded glycoproteins preferentially emigrate from the thymus and seed peripheral lymphoid organs. The specificity for both foreign antigen and MHC molecules is imparted by the alpha and beta chains of the T-cell antigen receptor (TCR). Two other T-cell surface proteins, CD4 and CD8, which bind non-polymorphic regions of class II and class I MHC molecules respectively, are also involved in these recognition events and play an integral role in thymic selection. In order to elucidate the developmental pathways of class II MHC-restricted T cells in relation to these essential accessory molecules, we have produced TCR-transgenic mice expressing a receptor specific for a fragment of pigeon cytochrome c and the Ek (class II MHC) molecule. The transgenic TCR is expressed on virtually all T cells in mice expressing Ek. The thymuses of these mice contain an abnormally high percentage of mature CD4+CD8- cells. In addition, the peripheral T-cell population is almost exclusively CD4+, demonstrating that the MHC specificity of the TCR determines the phenotype of T cells during selection in the thymus.\r"

  ".W": "Antigen-specific T lymphocytes appear to recognize foreign antigens in the form of peptide fragments presented within the antigen-binding groove of class I or class II molecules encoded by the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). Alloreactive T cells also show specificity for MHC molecules, and various reports suggest that residues of the MHC molecules constitute at least part of the ligand to which alloreactive T-cell receptors bind. The X-ray crystal structure of the human MHC class I molecule, HLA-A2, has provided evidence to strengthen the argument that MHC-bound self-peptide might also contribute to such recognition. We now provide direct evidence for this, showing that at least some alloreactive cytotoxic T lymphocyte clones recognize peptide fragments derived from cytoplasmic proteins. We reasoned that if self-peptides were involved in allorecognition, then the sequence of some of these peptides could vary between species, resulting in species-restricted distribution of the relevant ligand(s). Several alloreactive cytotoxic T lymphocyte clones specific for H-2Kb, expressed by the murine cell line EL4, did not lyse a human-cell transfectant expressing the H-2Kb molecule (Jurkat-Kb cells). However, these clones were able to lyse Jurkat-Kb cells sensitized by preincubation with an EL4 cytoplasmic extract cleaved by cyanogen bromide. The sensitizing activity from this extract was destroyed by protease and appeared to be due to a peptide consisting of 10 to 15 amino acids.\r"

With the exception of the high-affinity receptor for immunoglobulin E (Fc epsilon RI), these receptors were thought to consist of single polypeptides. Fc epsilon RI is a tetrameric complex of one alpha-subunit, one beta-subunit and two gamma-subunits. Here we report the cloning of a polypeptide identical to the gamma-chains of Fc epsilon RI, from mouse macrophages that do not express this receptor. Biosynthetic labelling and gene transfer together show that these gamma-chains associate with one of the macrophage receptors (Fc gamma RIIa). The human homologue, Fc gamma RIII (CD16), from natural killer cells is also expected to associate with gamma-chains. It is possible that these gamma-chains and the homologous zeta-chains of the T-cell antigen receptor belong to a new family of related proteins which share a common role in the signal transducing pathway.\r"

In addition, Lox2 shares homology with sequences in the bithorax complex Ultra-bithorax (Ubx) and abdominal A (abdA) genes in a region adjacent to the C-terminus of the homoeodomain. Whole mount in situ hybridization of embryos of various ages demonstrates that during early development this gene has temporally and spatially restricted patterns of expression that resemble those of the homoeotic genes of the Drosophila bithorax complex and of many vertebrate homoeobox genes. The largest accumulation of transcripts was seen in the posterior two-thirds of the developing leech central nervous system in 7-14-day-old embryos. Adult leeches also express Lox2. We propose that in Hirudo, Lox2 represents the ancestral gene of the Ubx and abdA genes of the bithorax complex of Drosophila.\r"

Here we use fluorescence energy transfer to determine the relative distances between the ends of a small DNA junction, and hence the path of the strands. Our results are consistent with the geometry of an 'X'. The interconnected helices are juxtaposed so that the continuous strands of each helix generate an antiparallel alignment, and the two interchanged strands do not cross at the centre. The acute angle of the X structure is defined by a right-handed rotation of the helical axes about the axis perpendicular to the X plane, as viewed from the centre of the X.\r"

Sixty cases of cervical trauma (fractures, subluxations, ligamentous instability, or a combination of these problems) were treated with Caspar plating. All patients obtained fusion, and stability was achieved immediately after surgery without external stabilization. No unusual surgical complications occurred, and the most dreaded complication of dural penetration by drilling or screw placement was not observed. This report details the neurological presentation, anatomical lesions, surgical therapy, and outcome of these patients. Caspar plating combines the advantage of an anterior surgical approach with immediate postoperative stabilization without external stabilization. This advantage persists even in the presence of posterior ligamentous instability. The technique is an important addition to the surgical treatment of cervical trauma.\r"

Yet, the resultant immediate fixation with minimal patient morbidity seems to indicate that this method provides an ideal stabilization construct. We describe and report the outcome of a technique of posterior cervical fixation with methylmethacrylate and wire for stabilization of traumatic fractures of the lower cervical spine. Over a 12-year period, 124 fracture-dislocations of the lower cervical spine in 99 patients (mean age, 32 years; range, 15-76 years) were treated at this institution using a posterior methylmethacrylate and wire technique. Eighty-two patients had a posterior element fracture; 28 had a vertebral compression with posterior ligamentous injury; and 14 had a ligamentous injury alone. Thirty-six patients were neurologically intact upon admission, while the rest had radiculopathy or partial or complete myelopathy. Ninety-one patients were available for follow-up [mean, 18.6 months; range, 1-100 months (8.33 years)]. Eighty-eight patients (97%) had a stable fixation and 77 (85%) had resumed preoperative activity or were working but with a residual deficit. Complications included fixation failure requiring a second operation in 3 patients, nonlethal pulmonary embolism in 2 patients, lethal pulmonary embolism in 1 patient, and a superficial wound infection in 3 patients (none affected the underlying fixation construct). These results indicate that this technique is a safe, simple, and effective method for stabilizing the lower cervical spine that allows rapid patient mobility with minimal morbidity.\r"

Symptoms were related to tumor location, which was similar to that of meningioma. The operative mortality was 9% overall, and has been zero since 1974 (18 patients). The average time before the first recurrence was 47 months, with the recurrence rates at 1, 5, and 10 years after surgery being 15, 65, and 76%, respectively. Ten patients have developed extraneural metastasis, mostly to lung and bone, at an average of 99 months after the first operation. The 10- and 15-year rates of metastasis were 33 and 64%, respectively. The average survival period has been 84 months, with survival rates at 5, 10, and 15 years after surgery of 67, 40, and 23%, respectively. The histological diagnosis of the tumor was not related to survival or recurrence and did not change with recurrence. Tentorial and posterior fossa tumors tended to be more lethal. Total tumor resection favorably affected recurrence and survival, as opposed to subtotal resection. Metastasis adversely affected survival, and was followed by death at an average of 24 months after its diagnosis. Radiation therapy after the first operation extended the average time before first recurrence from 34 to 75 months, and extended survival from 62 to 92 months.\r"

Increased uptake of 99mTc-glucoheptonate was measured in intact tumors and in various sectors of dissected tumors. The extent of 99mTc-glucoheptonate uptake greatly varied among different tumors and among different sectors of the same tumor. Ultrastructural and cytochemical analysis of the capillary endothelial wall revealed major alterations in tight junctions, which became permeable to horseradish peroxidase. In brain tissue around the tumors, uptake of 99mTc-glucoheptonate and ultrastructure of tight junctions were comparable to normal brain capillaries. The results of the present study indicate that altered endothelial tight junctions may provide the main route of transport of 99mTc-glucoheptonate through the endothelial wall.\r"

  ".W": "During the last 17 years, complete autopsies were performed on 51 patients who died of cerebral glioblastoma, and 14 were found to have dissemination by cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). In these 14 cases of glioma, the extent of intraparenchymal invasion by the primary tumor and the degree of seeding were studied in connection with histological findings and immunohistochemical staining for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) as the most reliable marker of astrocytic differentiation. From the findings obtained, the cases were divided into two groups. In one group, consisting of 7 gliomas, autopsy revealed intense seeding, despite only slight invasion by the primary tumor. Among these 7 extensively disseminated gliomas, 4 expressed almost no GFAP, 2 contained only a few GFAP-positive cells, and only 1 displayed an immunohistochemically high degree of astrocytic differentiation. Clinically, 6 of the 7 affected patients developed symptoms attributable to CSF seeding. In the other group consisting of the remaining 7 gliomas, only slight dissemination was seen, despite extensive infiltration of the primary tumor. Each of these 7 gliomas contained many GFAP-positive cells. None of the affected patients developed symptomatic seeding. This study shows the existence of two clinicopathologically distinct groups of disseminated cerebral glioblastomas and suggests that, regardless of morphological features, glioblastomas showing immunohistochemically poor astrocytic differentiation tend to shed tumor cells more vigorously but are less invasive at the primary site than those with many GFAP-positive cells. It is also suggested that, as a consequence, the former glioma type produces symptomatic seeding more frequently than the latter type.\r"

Androgen receptors were found in 8 of 19 meningiomas, but not in the 11 other brain tumors examined. Measurable glucocorticoid receptors were found in 15 of 19 meningiomas, 1 malignant lymphoma, 1 hemangioblastoma, 2 craniopharyngiomas, 1 neurilemoma, 1 of 2 glioblastomas, and 1 of 2 astrocytomas. Of the 10 samples examined for tyrosine aminotransferase activity, measurable enzyme activity was found in 7 of the 8 meningiomas, but not in the single hemangioblastoma nor in the single craniopharyngioma. In accordance with other published studies, the results from this study also suggest that the growth of meningiomas may be regulated by hormones, and that the role steroid hormones and their receptors play in the meningioma is worthy of further investigation.\r"

Each of the assays was performed independently by investigators well-experienced with these assays. The NB assay is a new assay that measures functional steroid receptors--that is, the activation of the receptor and its binding to the nucleus. The assay is very sensitive and requires a relatively small amount of tissue as compared with the DCC assay. In agreement with data from other studies. PR were detected in most meningiomas by all 3 methods: in 69% of the cases by NB, in 76% by DCC, and in 89% by IP. ER were detected in only a few cases: in 33% by NB, in 2% by DCC, and in none by the IP assay. The agreement for PR sites was 62% for all 3 assays; it was 66% between the NB and DCC assays, 67% between the NB and IP assays, and 86% between the DCC and IP assays. Of 26 cases that were positive by the DCC assay, 6 (23%) were negative by NB. The overall agreement for all three ER assays was 65%. The data suggest that the majority of meningiomas contain high-affinity receptors for progesterone, that estrogen receptors are present in only a few meningiomas, and that some of these estrogen and progesterone receptors appear to be functional.\r"

All children were investigated with a CT ventriculogram and/or CT cisternogram, and no communication with the cyst was demonstrated. Three children were seen in the 1st year of life and the remaining 2 children were between 1 and 5 years of age. Hydrocephalus and developmental delay were the most common presenting features, followed by visual disturbance, squint, or ataxia. Direct surgical decompression was performed in all 5 patients to avoid long-term placement of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt. A temporary shunt was placed in 2 children because of high intracranial pressure. Direct partial excision of the cyst wall to allow long-term drainage into the basal cisterns or ventricular system was successful in all children. The presence of subdural collections postoperatively required temporary shunting in 2 children. After follow-up for between 10 and 22 months no clinical endocrinological sequelae have been detected, but 2 children have raised serum prolactin levels. Three children are developmentally delayed; one of these has regained some skills since surgery. Direct surgical decompression of suprasellar arachnoid cysts to avoid long-term shunt placement is the preferred method of surgical treatment for this condition.\r"

All patients were investigated preoperatively with MRI and intraoperatively with ultrasound. These neurodiagnostic examinations dictated the type of surgical intervention. Patients with Chiari I or Chiari II malformations, cervical hydromyelia, or basal arachnoiditis underwent decompression of the hindbrain malformations, myelotomy with drainage of the cyst, and placement of a stent. When the area of hydromyelia extended to the obex, as demonstrated by intraoperative ultrasound, the obex was plugged. Cyst-pleural shunts were placed in the children who had myelomeningoceles and thoracic hydromyelia. Patients with distal hydromyelia underwent modified terminal ventriculostomy. The classical presentation of brachial amyotrophy and dissociated sensory loss was present in only 3 patients. Progressive scoliosis without neurological deficit, pain, and Lhermitte's phenomenon were common presentations. The patients with tethered cords were generally asymptomatic from their cysts.

  ".W": "In this experimental study the feasibility of microsurgical laser-assisted repair of the oculomotor nerve in the cat was investigated. The 3rd cranial nerve was explored after a temporobasal craniectomy from its exit at the brain stem to its entrance into the cavernous sinus and transected. The cut nerve ends were loosely reapproximated and welded together with a CO2 milliwatt laser using a power setting of 80 to 90 mW and a spot size of 150 mu. Regeneration of the oculomotor nerve within an observation period of 12 months as assessed by weekly examination of the pupil diameter was excellent in 4 animals and satisfactory in 2. In the two control groups consisting of 6 animals in which the nerve reconstruction had been performed with fibrin glue or by simple nerve reapproximation minimal nerve regeneration could be observed only in one animal. The histomorphological examinations revealed good regeneration across the laser anastomosis including new formation of a perineural sheath without any significant scarring effect or constriction at the anastomotic site. It is concluded that the CO2 milliwatt laser might be a useful tool for the microsurgical repair of cranial nerves and should possibly be incorporated into the neurosurgical armamentarium of reconstructive cranial nerve surgery.\r"

A midline neck incision allowed isolation and approximation of both carotid arteries in an end-to-side fashion using four 10-0 nylon stay sutures. The laser parameters used for vessel fusion were 0.3-second 5-W pulses at a spot size of 600 microns. Anastomoses were analyzed at various time intervals from 1 day to 6 months by angiogram and histological examination. The anastomotic patency was 86%. Aneurysm formation occurred in 23%. Histological examination revealed an acute/subacute transmural injury both at the anastomotic site and several hundred microns away, with delayed re-endothelialization and some attempt at muscular and elastic regeneration. Histological assessment of the aneurysms demonstrated a total loss of the internal elastic lamina and muscularis. A brief discussion comparing Nd: YAG LAVA to other LAVA techniques follows.\r"

  ".W": "Perturbations in cerebral hemodynamics at the time of ablation of an arteriovenous shunt have been regarded as important in the pathogenesis of swelling and hemorrhage complicating resection of arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). A carotid-jugular fistula model in the rat had previously been investigated and found to simulate in part the nonhemorrhagic pathophysiology of a large cerebral arteriovenous fistula. Utilizing this model and measuring cerebral blood flow in 14 regions with a [14C]iodoantipyrine autoradiographic technique, the effects of hypocapnea on the cerebral circulation in opened and closed fistulas were investigated. Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in control animals ranged from a median of 53 to 64 ml/100 g/min at a partial arterial carbon dioxide pressure (PaCO2) of 28 +/- 2 mm Hg and 85 to 112 ml/100 g/min at a PaCO2 of 40 +/- 5 mm Hg. In animals with an open carotid-jugular fistula created 12 weeks before the study, these median rCBF values at comparable PaCO2 levels ranged, respectively, from 15 to 39 ml/100 g/min and 50 to 68 ml/100 g/min (the 25th percentile for the open fistula in the hypocapneic group was 15 ml/100 g/min in 5 of the 14 regions studied). In contrast, median rCBF in the closed fistula group ranged from 73 to 100 ml/100 g/min in hypocapneic animals and from 118 to 187 ml/100 g/min in normocapneic animals. These results demonstrate the preservation of CO2 reactivity; hypoperfusion in the presence of a carotid-jugular fistula, hyperemia on fistula occlusion, and the potential to induce cerebral ischemia with hyperventilation in this model of a cerebral arteriovenous fistula.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "90015602\r", 
  ".W": "The existence of uric acid in mammalian brain was recently reported, but it has not yet become a consensus. The mammalian brain has been thought to lack xanthine oxidase, which catalyzes hypoxanthine to xanthine and xanthine to uric acid as the last steps of ATP degradation in other tissue. Using high-performance liquid chromatography, we performed assays for hypoxanthine, xanthine, and uric acid in rat brain after cerebral ischemia. It was confirmed that all three substances showed significant augmentation in the removed brains and that the chronological order of those increases corresponded to the order in the metabolic pathway. Allopurinol, a specific inhibitor of xanthine oxidase, significantly suppressed the increases in uric acid and xanthine, and a compensatory accumulation of hypoxanthine was observed. From these results, it was concluded that uric acid does exist in the brain, increases after ischemia, and is possibly the end product of purine degradation in the brain. Furthermore, it is suggested that xanthine oxidase exists in the brain and catalyzes the reaction from hypoxanthine to xanthine and then to uric acid. These reactions catalyzed by xanthine oxidase are considered to be a source of free radicals and may play important roles in the pathogenesis of cerebral ischemic injury.\r"

In each patient, neurovascular compression was found involving the posteroinferior cerebellar artery and involving the 9th and 10th cranial nerves. In two of the patients, the compression was caused by arachnoiditis and in the other by an arterial loop. In each patient, neuralgia was successfully eliminated by microvascular decompression and by section of the upper rootlets of the vagus nerve. In one patient, partial section of the 9th cranial nerve was also performed. Because of the frequent involvement of the vagus nerve in the pathogenesis of this condition, open surgery should be preferable to percutaneous thermorhizotomy, which is unable to act selectively on the 10th cranial nerve.\r"

Spin-density sequences displayed them as hypointense areas, with relaxation times similar to those of the CSF, suggesting their cystic nature. The increased use of magnetic resonance imaging may result in coincidental imaging of involutional cystic pineal changes of many individuals; their characteristic appearance will allow the differentiation between them and pineal neoplastic conditions.\r"

Neuropathic deficit was greater in HMSN 1b (the disorder linked to Duffy) than in HMSN 1a (not linked to Duffy). Nerve conduction attributes changed significantly depending on attribute studied, age, and nerve. In patients evaluated serially, ulnar conduction velocity (CV) increased by a few meters per second in patients who were 5 to 14 or 15 to 39 years old at first examination, but decreased in patients who were older. In serial measurements, peroneal nerve amplitude decreased in all 3 age groups. We found an association between CV and amplitude or NDS at first and last examinations, suggesting an association between severity of the CV abnormality and neuropathic deficit. The severity of the CV abnormality in the young appears to predict later neurologic abnormality.\r"

Episcleritis, orbital pseudotumor, and sclerosing cholangitis accompanied a florid intracranial inflammatory pachymeningitis. The latter was associated with blindness, multiple cranial neuropathies, pseudotumor cerebri, and seizures. Extensive investigation failed to reveal an etiology. Corticosteroids were ineffective in preventing progression of the disorder, and the value of antineoplastic therapy was uncertain. Multifocal fibrosclerosis, a rare disorder, may result in a confusing array of neurologic manifestations.\r"

Serial CT studies repeated after periods of up to 2 years demonstrated significant progressive cerebral atrophy. Older DS adults without dementia, but with cognitive decline, did not show cerebral atrophy as compared with young DS subjects. These results suggest brain atrophy must be present to accompany dementia in older DS subjects, despite the presence of Alzheimer's disease neuropathology in all older subjects. The Alzheimer's disease process in DS may occur in 2 stages, the 1st with neuropathology and cognitive decline, the 2nd with additional cerebral atrophy and dementia.\r"

  ".W": "We examined suppression of EMG activity in the contracting sternocleidomastoid muscles, produced by electrical stimulation of the supraorbital nerve in 10 normal subjects and 9 patients with spasmodic torticollis. This exteroceptive reflex in the sternocleidomastoid muscle consisted of 2 or 3 phases: (1) an early, small, and unstable phase of facilitation, followed by (2) a period of suppression beginning 35 msec after the stimulus, lasting for 35 msec with a reduction in EMG activity to approximately 40% of the prestimulus level, and (3) a further phase of facilitation at a latency of 70 msec, with duration 35 msec and an increase in EMG activity to approximately 35% above prestimulus levels. The latency and duration of the suppressive phase of this reflex were similar to the exteroceptive suppression of EMG activity in the masseter muscle after supraorbital nerve stimulation (masseter silent period). In patients with spasmodic torticollis, the depth of this exteroceptive suppression in the sternocleidomastoid muscles was less than that observed in an age-matched cohort of normal subjects, although the latency and duration were normal. In contrast, exteroceptive suppression in the masseter muscle was normal. These findings suggest abnormal function of inhibitory interneuronal networks between the 5th cranial nerve and the motor neurons of the spinal accessory and upper cervical nerves which mediate exteroceptive suppression in the sternocleidomastoid muscle in patients with spasmodic torticollis.\r"

Circulating anti-acetylcholine receptor (anti-AChR) antibodies were negative in 6 of the 16 patients, but the motor end-plate fine structure in the postsynaptic regions was abnormal in all 16. Single-fiber EMG revealed no abnormalities in 8 of 13 patients studied. Our results indicate that the detection of immune complexes at the limb muscle end-plate provides a highly sensitive and confirmative method for diagnosing patients with minimal or atypical myasthenia gravis who have no detectable anti-AChR antibodies in their serum.\r"

  ".U": "90015695\r", 
  ".W": "Symptoms in patients with demyelinating disorders are associated with 3 important conduction abnormalities: complete conduction block, rate-dependent conduction block, and slowed impulse conduction. The recent observation that the electrogenic Na/K pump causes the nerve membrane hyperpolarization responsible for rate-dependent conduction block in demyelinated axons raises the possibility that focal inhibition of the pump may reverse the rate-dependent block. Since the pump is also responsible for maintaining part of the resting membrane potential, pump inhibition might have an additional effect of reversing the complete conduction block by reducing the threshold. We have demonstrated that inhibition of the pump by topical application of ouabain, a short-acting cardiac glycoside, reverses the conduction abnormalities in acutely demyelinated single rat ventral root axons by reducing the threshold of transmission. Ouabain or other cardiac glycosides show potential promise as agents for trial in the symptomatic treatment of patients with MS and other demyelinating disorders.\r"

Rightward eye deviation and right-beating nystagmus occurred with diffuse, predominantly left hemispheric 4 to 6 Hz sharp waves. No eye movements occurred in the absence of spike and wave activity. These correlations agree with current concepts of the cortical control of saccadic eye movements in monkeys studied by electrical stimulation.\r"
