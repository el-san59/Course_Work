  ".W": "Estrogens are known to increase the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and to produce fluid retention, while atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) induces an increase of the urinary output and tends to return the fluid balance to normal. The aim of this study was to test whether the levels of ANP were decreased during chronic estrogen and progestin administration, thereby possibly decreasing the amount of fluid excreted. The authors also studied women with premenstrual syndrome (PMS), because of the associated fluid retention often described with this syndrome. Levels of ANP, plasma renin activity (PRA), and aldosterone were determined in premenopausal women in the early follicular phase (EFP) and on low-dose oral contraceptives (OC), in postmenopausal patients with and without estrogen replacement therapy (ERT), and in women with PMS associated with fluid retention. The concentrations of ANP and PRA were enhanced in the women on OC, but those of aldosterone were unchanged. No differences were observed in the women on ERT or with PMS. It is concluded that the levels of PRA and ANP are affected by estrogen or progesterone therapy or the combination of the two and this response is dose dependent or additive. Furthermore, ANP and PRA do not seem to play a direct role in PMS.\r"

Ovarian biopsies demonstrated large numbers of unstimulated primordial follicles in three cases and no follicles in one case. Two of the four women were sisters, with the older having true premature menopause and the younger having resistant ovary syndrome. The explanation for the association of blepharophimosis with primary ovarian dysfunction is unknown, but the possibility of a microdeletion of genetic material containing two geographically associated but independent genes could not be confirmed or excluded by high-resolution chromosome banding. All families affected by the autosomal dominant condition of blepharophimosis should be counseled about the high incidence of ovarian dysfunction and female infertility, at least in one form of the syndrome.\r"

Treatment from cycle day 7 to 16 with 180 micrograms and 250 micrograms norgestimate led to suppression of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels, while progesterone (P) remained suppressed in 28 of 32 cycles studied, indicating inhibition of ovulation. Lack of ovulation in 30 cycles was associated in all but 3 with functional follicles, 2 of which luteinized. With 250 micrograms norgestimate, estradiol (E2) concentrations reached levels similar to those achieved during control follicular phase, but significantly higher concentrations of E2 were achieved with 180 micrograms norgestimate. Cervical mucus score was significantly depressed in all but 5 cycles (3 norgestimate 180 micrograms and 2 norgestimate 250 micrograms cycles). In conclusion, both dosages of norgestimate show good suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis and cervical mucus.\r"

Estradiol (E2) levels on the day of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) and the mean number of mature, immature and atretic oocytes per cycle did not differ between the two groups. Likewise, fertilization, cleavage, and pregnancy rates were similar for the two treatments. When daily hormone levels were compared in 11 patients during two successive treatment cycles with both stimulation protocols, the temporal pattern of FSH accumulation was repeated in both cycles, but FSH levels were significantly higher when patients received hFSH/hMG. Nevertheless, during both cycles, E2 reached similar peak levels and the mean number of follicles per cycle on the day of hCG administration was not different. We conclude that routine use of hFSH/hMG does not improve the success of an in vitro fertilization (IVF) program and that higher FSH levels do not change the individuality of ovarian response in the same woman.\r"

The number of sperm bound to the ZP was independent of previous sperm binding in in vitro fertilization (IVF), preservation of the ZP in salt solution, and fluorochrome labeling but increased linearly with time and sperm concentration. Sperm from men who had one or more failed attempts at IVF with no or few oocytes fertilized usually displayed very low ZP binding ratios of test to normal sperm. This test may predict the ability of sperm to fertilize human oocytes in vitro and should be useful in studies of human gamete interaction.\r"

The OCC were divided into three groups according to the number of cumulus-cell layers surrounding them. The OCC were then frozen and thawed (F/T), with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as cryoprotectant. The survival rates after thawing increased significantly (P less than 0.001) as the number of cumulus-cell layers increased. Germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD) was evaluated in F/T oocytes. After 2 hours, significantly (P less than 0.05) fewer oocytes demonstrated GVBD than did those in the control group. There was no difference, however, after 4 hours of culture. A significant (P less than 0.05) decrease in follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH)-dependent cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) accumulation was observed in the F/T group. However, the amount of cAMP produced was sufficient to maintain the oocyte in meiotic arrest. There was a borderline significant decrease of the coupling between cumulus cells and the oocyte in F/T OCC, as evaluated by the transport of 3H-uridine into the oocyte. It is concluded that immature rat oocytes can be successfully cryopreserved when they are surrounded by five or more layers of cumulus cells. FSH responsiveness and intercellular communication were essentially maintained. There was a slight delay in GVBD, which needs further clarification.\r"

  ".U": "89031698\r", 
  ".W": "A number of indirect studies suggest a role for endogenous arachidonic acid (AA) in pancreatic islet function. To probe the effects of this fatty acid, AA and other polyunsaturated fatty acids were exogenously provided in Ca2+-free medium to avoid the formation of insoluble or impermeant Ca2+-arachidonate complexes. Concentrations of AA of greater than or equal to 3 microM induced potent and sustained but reversible 45Ca efflux from prelabeled intact (or digitonin-permeabilized) islets; AA also induced insulin release at somewhat higher concentrations. Other unsaturated fatty acids (erucic, oleic, linoleic, linolenic, dihomo-gamma-linolenic, eicosapentaenoic, docosahexaenoic acids) were generally less active than AA itself, indicating a structure-function relationship. The effects of AA were saturable, were inhibitable by cooling, and were not accompanied in parallel by 51Cr release or trypan blue retention, suggesting a nontoxic mechanism. At low concentrations (3.3-16 microM), at which AA does not stimulate insulin release, AA-induced 45Ca efflux was not reduced by pretreatment with ionomycin (to deplete membrane-bound Ca2+ stores), suggesting stimulation of Ca2+ extrusion through the plasma membrane. At higher concentrations (greater than or equal to 25 microM), at which AA promotes insulin release, further Ca2+ efflux was stimulated, which was blunted by pretreatment with ionomycin (as well as by trifluoperazine). Conversely, pretreatment with AA obliterated the effects of ionomycin (3 microM) on cellular Ca2+ mobilization. Thus, AA also mobilizes Ca2+ from intracellular organelles, leading to a rise in free cytosolic Ca2+ (as previously reported). AA-induced 45Ca efflux and insulin release were independent of the presence of extracellular Na+ and did not require the oxygenation of AA. Dose-response curves comparing 45Ca efflux and insulin secretion suggested that AA also stimulates hormone release by at least one other mechanism in addition to Ca2+ mobilization. This second stimulatory effect of AA could be seen in digitonin-permeabilized islets, where changes in cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration were vitiated by EGTA-containing buffers. Such secretion was also saturable and was inhibited by cooling or by spermine (which inhibits protein kinase C in the islet). Furthermore, AA-induced secretion from either intact or permeabilized islets was blunted by prolonged pretreatment of islets with a phorbol ester to deplete them of protein kinase C. Thus, exogenous arachidonic acid seems to be a complete secretagogue, having stimulatory effects both on Ca2+ mobilization and Ca2+-related secretory processes, putatively the activation of protein kinase C.\r"

Basal hepatic glucose production (4.3 +/- 0.5 mg.kg-1.min-1) in the DKA patients was 1.5- to 2-fold greater (P less than .01) than in controls (2.1 +/- 0.1 mg.kg-1.min-1) and nonketotic IDDM subjects (2.9 +/- 0.3 mg.kg-1.min-1), whereas tissue glucose disposal was significantly reduced (1.7 +/- 0.1 vs. 2.1 +/- 0.1 mg.kg-1.min-1, P less than .05). After the institution of insulin therapy (1 mU.kg-1.min-1), the plasma glucose concentration fell at the rate of 60 +/- 5 mg.dl-1.h-1 to reach a value of 220 +/- 10 mg/dl, which was maintained constant for 2 h (insulin-clamp technique). Blood pH (7.21 +/- 0.06 to 7.35 +/- 0.05) and plasma bicarbonate (12 +/- 3 to 18 +/- 2 meq/L) both increased during insulin therapy (P less than .01). The decline in plasma glucose concentration during insulin therapy primarily resulted from a suppression of HGP (from 4.3 +/- 0.5 to 1.7 +/- 0.2 mg.kg-1.min-1, P less than .01) and to a lesser extent from the stimulation of tissue glucose disposal (1.7 +/- 0.2 to 2.6 +/- 0.3 mg.kg-1.min-1, P less than .01). At this time, urine glucose excretion decreased from 2.6 +/- 0.2 to 0.6 +/- 0.1 mg.kg-1.min-1.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

RX 77368 microinjected at a 7.7-pmol dose into the dorsal vagal complex or nucleus ambiguus stimulated gastric acid secretion to 62.2 +/- 15.9 and 45.3 +/- 14.3 mumol/h, respectively, whereas in the vehicle-treated group acid secretion was 0.5 +/- 1.0 mumol/h. A 10-fold higher dose of RX 77368 was inefficient when microinjected into the medial septum, central amygdala, or lateral hypothalamus. The gastric secretory response to microinjection of RX 77368 into the nucleus ambiguus was dose related (0.7-77 pmol), long-lasting (greater than 90 min), and blocked by vagotomy. TRH (144 pmol) injected into the nucleus ambiguus also stimulated gastric acid secretion but was less potent than the stable TRH analogue, whereas the unrelated peptide, oxytocin, was inactive. Intrathecal injection of RX 77368 at doses up to 2500 pmol did not modify gastric acid secretion. These results demonstrate that the dorsal vagal complex and nucleus ambiguus are TRH sites of action for stimulation of gastric acid secretion through vagal dependent pathways. These findings, added to the high concentrations of TRH-like immunoreactivity and receptors present in these nuclei, suggest a possible role of medullary TRH in the vagal regulation of gastric acid secretion.\r"

Its plasma activity, normally very low, is enhanced by intravenous heparin, which releases the enyzme from small bowel enterocytes into the blood. Plasma postheparin DAO (PHD) values have been shown to be significantly reduced in patients with malabsorption and villous atrophy and inversely correlated with 24-h fecal fat, thus suggesting that PHD reflects the mature enterocytic mass. We have assayed PHD in 51 patients with small bowel Crohn's disease by measuring the area under the plasma DAO curve over a 120-min period after an intravenous bolus of 15,000 IU of heparin. Postheparin plasma DAO was significantly lower (p less than 0.001) in patients (328 +/- 175 U/ml.min) than in 20 normal subjects (508 +/- 101 U/ml.min; range, 391-749). Postheparin diamine oxidase values were inversely correlated with Crohn's disease activity index (CDAI), but no correlation was found with extent of disease assessed radiologically by either double-contrast small bowel enema or barium meal follow-through. In 6 patients with active disease (CDAI, 297 +/- 99) and low PHD values (188 +/- 100 U/ml.min), the assay was repeated after a clinically effective course of antiinflammatory drugs. A significant increase in PHD values (388 +/- 112 U/ml.min) was observed (p less than 0.005). These data indicate that mucosal involvement is common in small bowel Crohn's disease and that PHD may be useful in assessing and monitoring mucosal damage in these patients.\r"

  ".W": "Functional renal failure of cirrhosis (FRFC) is a usually fatal syndrome of acute renal failure occurring in patients with advanced liver disease. Although not conclusively proven, most evidence suggests that renal arterial and arteriolar vasoconstriction is the cause of the renal failure in these patients. However, the mediators of the vasoconstriction remain unknown. Human atrial natriuretic factor (hANF) is a hormone with potent natriuretic, diuretic, and vasorelaxant properties. A deficiency of hANF could lead to renal arterial vasoconstriction and avid renal sodium retention as seen in FRFC. This study was undertaken to determine if patients with FRFC are deficient in circulating hANF. Seven patients with advanced alcoholic liver disease and renal failure of unknown cause (FRFC) were compared with 7 patients with advanced alcoholic liver disease, ascites, and normal serum creatinine as well as with 14 healthy volunteers. Plasma hANF was measured by radioimmunoassay. Plasma hANF was 742 +/- 227 pg/ml (mean +/- SEM) in patients with FRFC compared with 360 +/- 70 pg/ml in patients with liver disease and normal serum creatinine (p greater than 0.05) and 28 +/- 5.7 pg/ml in healthy volunteers (p less than 0.005 vs. FRFC and chronic liver disease, ascites, and normal serum creatinine). Thus, FRFC is not caused by a deficiency of circulating hANF. The elevated plasma hANF levels in patients with chronic liver disease and continued sodium retention may suggest a renal insensitivity to the natriuretic effects of hANF.\r"

Different groups of mice were kept at various concentrations of O2 (21%, 35%, and 45% O2), or were treated by either s.c. injections or i.p. injections of electrolyte solution at various doses (0, 4, 6, or 8 ml/day). Further groups were treated either with i.p. lavage, lavage with 1.5 mg/ml of gabexate, or i.p. injections of 100 mg/kg of gabexate without lavage. The potential benefits of the various regimens were assessed by measuring survival, various biochemical and histologic features, and alterations in hematocrit, pH, and blood gases. Increasing O2 concentrations reversed hypoxemia and acidosis, but had no effect on biochemical or morphologic alterations and did not improve survival. However, hydration by s.c. fluid markedly improved survival and normalized the hematocrit without having major effects on biochemical or morphologic alterations. Intraperitoneal fluid did not improve survival. Gabexate injections without lavage had a slight effect on survival and serum amylase concentration and very little effect on histology. Lavage without gabexate had a greater effect on survival, serum amylase, and histology. Addition of gabexate to the lavage fluid increased the beneficial effect of lavage. Increases in amylase and activated trypsin in ascites were markedly reduced by lavage and even more so by lavage with addition of gabexate. We conclude that sufficient hydration appears to be an important factor in supportive care for severe acute pancreatitis, whereas oxygenation without sufficient hydration has no major benefit. Peritoneal lavage with gabexate showed the greatest benefit of the various regimens for acute severe pancreatitis and is worthy of clinical trials.\r"

Arterial O2 saturation was rapidly lowered to 80 +/- 2% in 2 min and maintained for 30 min. During control experiments, ventilation increased immediately (3-5 min) and then declined so that at 25 min of hypoxia ventilation was little above that in room air. Somatostatin was associated with a small decrease in ventilation while the subjects breathed room air. With hypoxia there was no immediate increase in ventilation for the group as a whole, although an increase was observed in one subject. With somatostatin, after 25 min of hypoxia, mean ventilation was lower than at any other time in the study; as hypoxia was discontinued ventilation increased slightly. Somatostatin causes profound depression of the ventilatory response to hypoxia by a mechanism that is not known but may be central. With somatostatin hypoxia of 25-min duration tends to depress ventilation.\r"

  ".W": "Low-level chemiluminescence (C) is thought to be an index of oxidant stress. We measured the relationship between low-level C, pulmonary arterial pressure, and perfusate concentration of thromboxane B2 (TxB2) in isolated perfused rabbit lungs during challenge with tert-butyl hydroperoxide (t-bu-OOH). We also measured glutathione release as another index of oxidant stress. We found that C was correlated with each variable, suggesting that oxidant stress measured by C and by glutathione release stimulated TxB2 production and pulmonary vasoconstriction. We also investigated the contribution of active O2 metabolites produced by prostaglandin (PG) peroxidase to oxidant stress by studying the effects of t-bu-OOH before and after the use of cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase inhibitors. We found that C was augmented after inhibition, perhaps due to metabolism of t-bu-OOH by peroxidases of both arachidonic acid (AA) metabolic pathways in the absence of their normal substrates. We studied phenylbutazone, thought to inhibit peroxidases, and AA. C during t-bu-OOH administration was not augmented after phenylbutazone and was markedly inhibited after AA administration perhaps because AA competes with t-bu-OOH. To further study the role of peroxidases we pretreated the lungs with the antioxidant dithiothreitol, which inhibits peroxidases involved in both the cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase pathways. Dithiothreitol nearly abolished C produced by t-bu-OOH and also prevented the increased light caused by eicosatetrynoic acid. We directly tested the hypothesis that C occurred as a result of the interaction of t-bu-OOH and the cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase enzymes; we measured C when t-bu-OOH was added to purified PGH2 synthase or soybean lipoxygenase. The combination of t-bu-OOH with PGH2 synthase or lipoxygenase led to C that was inhibited by dithiothreitol and by the antioxidant phenol. These results suggest that enzymes involved in AA metabolism can interact with t-bu-OOH and that the action of these enzymes on t-bu-OOH leads to C. The results may mean that lipid peroxides can indirectly contribute to tissue oxidant stress due to production of active O2 metabolites as by-products of their metabolism by AA peroxidases.\r"

The efficacy and selectivity of L-651,392 were tested by measuring in vivo production of leukotriene B4 (LTB4) and cyclooxygenase products of arachidonic acid after endotoxemia before and after pretreatment with L-651,392 and ex vivo from granulocytes and whole blood stimulated with calcium ionophore from sheep before and 24 h after pretreatment with L-651,392. A novel assay for LTB4 by high-performance liquid chromatography/gas chromatography/mass spectrometry techniques was developed as a measure of 5-lipoxygenase metabolism of arachidonic acid. L-651,392 proved to be an effective in vivo 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor in sheep. L-651,392 blocked the increase in LTB4 observed in lung lymph after endotoxemia in vivo in sheep as well as inhibited by 80% the ex vivo production of LTB4 by granulocytes removed from sheep treated 24 h earlier with L-651,392. Although L-651,392 blocked the increase in cyclooxygenase products of arachidonic acid observed in lung lymph after endotoxemia in vivo in sheep, the drug probably did not function directly as a cyclooxygenase inhibitor. L-651,392 did not attenuate the ex vivo production of thromboxane B2 by whole blood from sheep treated 24 h earlier with the drug. L-651,392 attenuated the alterations in pulmonary hemodynamics, lung mechanics, oxygenation, and lung fluid and solute exchange observed after endotoxemia in sheep. We speculate that 5-lipoxygenase products are a major stimulus for cyclooxygenase metabolism of arachidonic acid after endotoxemia in sheep.\r"

The present studies demonstrate that LPS and interleukin 1 (IL-1, a mediator released by endothelial cells after exposure to LPS) enhance the adherence of Staphylococcus aureus to human umbilical vein endothelial cells. gamma-Interferon, another mediator that induces expression of some cell surface antigens on endothelial cells, had no effect on bacterial adherence. The adherence of bacteria to endothelium was increased by prior opsonization of the bacteria with fresh human serum and was reduced by prior absorption of the serum with bacteria before the use of the serum for opsonization. The capacity of LPS to increase bacterial adherence was time dependent and was maximally expressed after 6 h of exposure; it was blocked by exposure of endothelial cells to LPS in the presence of reduced temperature or dactinomycin (Actinomycin D). These observations suggest that circulating LPS not only can trigger the development of ARDS but also may predispose the lung to the development of pulmonary infections by increasing adherence of bacteria to endothelium.\r"

Parenteral naloxone (200 micrograms/kg) significantly increased instantaneous minute ventilation (VT/TT) during severe hypoxia, (inspired O2 fraction = 0.07, arterial PO2 = 28-35 Torr); however, consistent effects during moderate hypoxia (inspired O2 fraction = 0.12, arterial PO2 = 40-47 Torr) could not be demonstrated. Parenteral naloxone increased O2 consumption (VO2) in severe hypoxia as well. Despite significant increases in ventilation post-naloxone during severe hypoxia, arterial blood gas tensions remained the same. Control studies revealed that neither saline nor naloxone produced a respiratory effect during normoxia; also the preservative vehicle of naloxone induced no change in ventilation during severe hypoxia. These data suggest that, in adult dogs, endorphins are released and act to restrain ventilation during severe hypoxia; the relationship between endorphin release and moderate hypoxia is less consistent. The observed increase in ventilation post-naloxone during severe hypoxia is accompanied by an increase in metabolic rate, explaining the isocapnic response.\r"

R was measured by the ventilatory oscillations after brief (less than 10 s) CO2 challenges. Control theory suggests that such oscillations are completely governed by LG. A significant positive correlation was found between R and LG (r = 0.74, P less than 0.01, n = 85). A minimal mathematical model of respiratory control was used to predict R as a function of LG. Serial correlation analysis (r = 0.09, P greater than 0.1) of the residuals indicated statistical agreement between predictions and observations. The mean residual (0.011) was not significantly different from zero (P greater than 0.1). Also, as the model predicted, sustained periodic breathing (PB) occurred whenever the estimated LG was greater than unity. The mean LG breathing room air was 0.51 and for the 13 epochs of PB was 1.17 (range 0.71-1.65). It is concluded that PB is a quantitative extension of the relative stability continuum and corresponds to unstable operation of the CO2 control system. Furthermore, relative stability can be quantitatively predicted for each subject by a minimal mathematical model.\r"

  ".W": "Numerous mathematical models of periodic breathing (PB) currently exist. These models suggest mechanisms that may underlie many known causes of PB. However, each model that has been shown to simulate PB under reasonable conditions contains greater than 15 physiological parameters. Because some parameters exhibit a wide range of values in a population, such simulations cannot test a model's ability to account for the breathing patterns of individuals. Furthermore it is impractical to perform a direct experimental validation study that would require the estimation of each of 15 or more parameters for each subject. A minimal model of PB is presented that is suitable for direct validation. Analytic expressions are given that define the conditions for PB in terms of the following: 1) CO2 sensitivity, 2) Cardiac output, 3) Mixed venous CO2, 4) Circulation time, and 5) Mean lung volume for CO2. This model is shown to be consistent with previous models and experimental data regarding the degree of hypoxia or congestive heart failure required to produce PB. A quantitative measure of relative stability is defined as a metric of comparison to the human studies described in the accompanying paper (J. Appl. Physiol. 65: 1389-1399, 1988).\r"

At 25 degrees C and pH 7.4, the catalyzed reaction velocity was 0.32 +/- 0.04 M/s for the CA II-deficient and 1.60 +/- 0.12 M/s for the normal cells, a ratio of 1:5. Under the same conditions at 37 degrees C the relative difference between the CA II-deficient and normal cells was much less: the velocity for the CA II-deficient cells was 0.84 +/- 0.07 M/s and for the normal cells 1.60 +/- 0.32 M/s, a ratio of 1:1.9. Results were comparable for the hemolysates with the NaHCO3 reduced to 85 mM (the corresponding intracellular concentration): at 25 degrees C CA II-deficient cells had a velocity of 0.36 +/- 0.01 M/s compared with 1.12 +/- 0.04 M/s for the normal cells, a ratio of 1:3.1. At 37 degrees C again the relative difference between hemolysates from CA II normal and deficient cells was much less: the CA II-deficient cells had a reaction velocity of 1.17 +/- 0.22 M/s vs. 2.60 +/- 0.36 M/s for the normal cells, a ratio of 1:2.2. The greater fractional reduction of enzyme velocity of CA II-deficient cells at 25 degrees C compared with 37 degrees C appears to be explained by a greater chloride inhibition of the presumed CA I at the lower temperature.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We found the following. 1) Dead space and airway resistance were significantly greater during nose than during mouth breathing. 2) The slope of CO2 ventilatory responses did not differ appreciably during the two types of breathing, but CO2 occlusion pressure response was significantly enhanced during nose breathing. 3) Inhalation of warm and humid air through a mouthpiece significantly depressed CO2 ventilation and occlusion pressure responses. These results fit our observation that end-tidal PCO2 was significantly higher during nose than during mouth breathing. It is suggested that a loss of nasal functions, such as during nasal obstruction, may result in lowering of CO2, fostering apneic spells during sleep.\r"

Pledgets with 4.7 mM kainic acid were placed bilaterally on the rostral, intermediate, or caudal ventilatory chemosensitive areas for 1-2 min in chloralose-urethan-anesthetized, paralyzed, vagotomized, glomectomized, and servo-ventilated cats. Application of kainic acid on the caudal or intermediate areas produced no consistent significant effects on eucapnic phrenic output or on the slope or maximum value of the phrenic nerve response to increased end-tidal PCO2. Rostral area kainic acid produced immediate augmentation and then diminution of blood pressure and phrenic output. Apnea developed in six of nine cats by 40 min. In all five cats in which it could be tested, the slope of the CO2 response was clearly decreased. Of [3H]kainic acid applied to the rostral area, 88.4% was shown to be within 2 mm of the ventral surface. Comparison of surface application sites of this and other studies suggests that an area overlapping the border of the original rostral and intermediate areas allows access to neurons involved in the chemoreception process, which may also provide tonic facilitatory input to cardiorespiratory systems.\r"

Diaphragmatic blood flow was reduced by occlusion of the descending aorta and internal mammary arteries. The goal of this study was to demonstrate that the failing diaphragm under these conditions shows biochemical changes similar to that of skeletal muscle fatigue. Selected metabolite concentrations were determined 1) during mechanical ventilation and normal blood flow, 2) during blood flow reduction and inspiratory loading when the ratio of airway pressure to diaphragmatic electromyogram (Paw/Edi) had decreased by 50% (fatigue), and 3) at 1 h after restoration of blood flow and mechanical ventilation (recovery). During fatigue, glycogen, ATP, and phosphocreatine were 30, 50, and 50% of control levels, respectively. Glucose 6-phosphate and lactate were two- and fivefold higher, respectively, than control concentrations. During recovery, all metabolites, except ATP and lactate, returned to control concentrations. These changes were not seen in resting ischemic skeletal muscles or in the diaphragmatic samples of the mechanically ventilated animals with diaphragmatic blood flow limitation. We conclude that when the loaded and hypoperfused diaphragm fails, as indicated by lower than control Paw/Edi, metabolite changes similar to that observed in fatigued skeletal muscle occur.\r"

In five additional rats with sham CSF infusion, we found no effect of mock CSF on the response to rebreathing CO2.

DIDS, at 10 to 1,000 nM, increased the respiratory response to CO2 in a dose-related manner but had no effect on arterial pressure or heart rate. At 1,000 nM, the hypercapnic minute ventilation response was almost doubled because of both volume and rate of breathing.

In the absence of a transmural electrical gradient, L-[14C]lysine was instilled into the upstream reservoir and the rate of appearance of the radiolabel in the downstream reservoir was determined. Two lungs from the same animal were used simultaneously to determine tracer fluxes both into and out of the alveolar bath. Results showed that the radiolabel flux measured in the alveolar to the pleural direction was greater than that measured in the opposite direction in the presence of sodium in the bathing fluids. The net flux of L-[14C]lysine was saturable with [Na+], with an apparent transport coefficient (Kt) of 28 mM for Na+. Hill analysis of [14C]lysine flux vs. [Na+] indicated a coupling ratio of 1:1 between sodium and radiolabeled L-lysine. Total L-lysine flux as a function of [L-lysine] was also saturable, with Kt of 7.3 mM for L-lysine. Ouabain significantly decreased absorptive (alveolar-to-pleural) radiolabel flux, while slightly increasing the flux observed in the opposite direction. L-leucine completely inhibited absorptive net flux of L-[14C]lysine. alpha-Methylaminoisobutyric acid (MeAIB), on the other hand, only slightly reduced net flux of L-[14C]lysine from the control value. The presence of a net absorptive, Na+-dependent amino acid flux across the alveolar epithelial barrier indicates that the tissue is capable of removing amino acids and sodium from the alveolar fluid by a coupled cotransport mechanism, which may be important for both protein metabolism and fluid balance by alveolar epithelium.\r"

The effect NREM sleep on respiratory muscle activity and CO2 retention was measured in healthy subjects who increased maximum total pulmonary resistance (RLmax, 1-81 cmH2O.l-1.s) from awake to NREM sleep. We determined the effects of this sleep-induced increase in airway impedance by steady-state inhalation of a reduced-density gas mixture (79% He-21% O2, He-O2). Both arterialized blood PCO2 (PaCO2) and end-tidal PCO2 (PETCO2) were measured. Inspiratory (EMGinsp) and expiratory (EMGexp) respiratory muscle electromyogram activity was measured. NREM sleep caused 1) RLmax to increase (7 +/- 3 vs. 39 +/- 28 cmH2O.l-1.s), 2) PaCO2 and/or PETCO2 to increase in all subjects (40 +/- 2 vs. 44 +/- 3 Torr), and 3) EMGinsp to increase in 8 of 9 subjects and EMGexp to increase in 9 of 17 subjects. Compared with steady-state air breathing during NREM sleep, steady-state He-O2 breathing 1) reduced RLmax by 38%, 2) decreased PaCO2 and PETCO2 by 2 Torr, and 3) decreased both EMGinsp (-20%) and EMGexp (-54%). We concluded that the sleep-induced increase in upper airway resistance accompanied by the absence of immediate load compensation is an important determinant of CO2 retention, which, in turn, may cause augmentation of inspiratory and expiratory muscle activity above waking levels during NREM sleep.\r"

The mean base-line hematocrit of 43 +/- 5% was increased to 57 +/- 4 and 68 +/- 8%, respectively, after two exchange transfusions of packed erythrocytes. Subsequent plasma exchange transfusions returned the mean hematocrit to 44 +/- 4%. Polycythemia caused no significant arterial hypoxemia; indeed there was a slight improvement in the alveolar-arterial PO2 difference. The multiple inert gas elimination measurements showed no increase in VA/Q inhomogeneity with no increase in log SD ventilation (V) or log SD blood flow (Q). There was a shift of mean V and mean Q to high VA/Q areas because of a decrease in cardiac output, presumably caused by increased blood viscosity. This study showed no deleterious effects on pulmonary gas exchange within the hematocrit range of 36-76%.\r"

  ".W": "To test the hypothesis that atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) has a direct vasodilator effect on the pulmonary vasculature that is enhanced in hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension in the rat, we determined the effects of ANP on mean pulmonary (MPAP) and systemic arterial pressure (MSAP) in intact conscious Sprague-Dawley rats exposed to 10% O2 or room air for 4 wk. Catheters were placed in the pulmonary artery through the right jugular vein by means of a closed-chest technique. MPAP and MSAP were monitored before and after intravenous injections of graded doses of ANP. ANP produced dose-related decreases in MPAP that were greater in the hypoxic group than in air controls. There were no significant between-group differences in the systemic depressor responses to ANP or in the ANP-induced reduction in cardiac output. ANP lowered MPAP significantly in isolated perfused lungs from both hypoxia-adapted and air control rats, and this effect was significantly greater in the hypoxic than the air control lungs. These data indicate that ANP lowers pulmonary arterial pressure in rats with hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension, mainly by a direct vasodilator effect on the pulmonary vasculature.\r"

  ".W": "The role of carotid body chemoreceptors in ventilatory acclimatization to hypoxia, i.e., the progressive, time-dependent increase in ventilation during the first several hours or days of hypoxic exposure, is not well understood. The purpose of this investigation was to characterize the effects of acute and prolonged (up to 4 h) hypoxia on carotid body chemoreceptor discharge frequency in anesthetized goats. The goat was chosen for study because of its well-documented and rapid acclimatization to hypoxia. The response of the goat carotid body to acute progressive isocapnic hypoxia was similar to other species, i.e., a hyperbolic increase in discharge as arterial PO2 (PaO2) decreased. The response of 35 single chemoreceptor fibers to an isocapnic [arterial PCO2 (PaCO2) 38-40 Torr)] decrease in PaO2 of from 100 +/- 1.7 to 40.7 +/- 0.5 (SE) Torr was an increase in mean discharge frequency from 1.7 +/- 0.2 to 5.8 +/- 0.4 impulses. During sustained isocapnic steady-state hypoxia (PaO2 39.8 +/- 0.5 Torr, PaCO2, 38.4 +/- 0.4 Torr) chemoreceptor afferent discharge frequency remained constant for the first hour of hypoxic exposure. Thereafter, single-fiber chemoreceptor afferents exhibited a progressive, time-related increase in discharge (1.3 +/- 0.2 impulses.s-1.h-1, P less than 0.01) during sustained hypoxia of up to 4-h duration. These data suggest that increased carotid chemoreceptor activity contributes to ventilatory acclimatization to hypoxia.\r"

These samples were analyzed for PO2, PCO2, and pH, the concentrations of O2, CO2, K+, Na+, La-, and Cl- in whole blood, and La-, K+, Na+, and Cl- in plasma. Whole blood was hemolyzed and analyzed for PO2, PCO2, and pH. Net O2 uptake, CO2 output, L, K+, Na+, and Cl- were calculated in addition to net output of non-CO2 acid (HA) and strong ion difference ([SID]) and common ion [SID] ([K+] + [Na+] - [Cl-] - [La-]). From these data we partitioned the origins of the arteriovenous [H+] difference via the common PCO2-pH diagram and via a [H+]-PCO2 diagram and determined whether true plasma arteriovenous [H+] differences reflect plasma and cell arteriovenous [H+] differences. The arteriovenous [H+] differences of plasma and hemolyzed blood were the same, showing that true plasma does reflect plasma and cells. K+ showed a small significant but transient output. Na+ was not significant, whereas Cl- showed a significant transient uptake. Lactate output and HA, calculated for dog blood acid-base, showed transient outputs and were the same. At 5.0 min when the arteriovenous difference was largest, CO2 alone would have increased [H+] 15.9 nmol/l whereas desaturation of Hb would have decreased [H+] 4.2 nmol/l and lactate could have raised [H+] 1.0 nmol/l.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Four groups each of 7 fetuses were infused with either saline (for 156 h), TRH (25 micrograms/h in 60-s pulses for 156 h), TRH (for 156 h) combined with cortisol (1 mg/h for 84 h), or cortisol (for 84 h). Cortisol had no effect on SPC concentrations, whereas both TRH and cortisol plus TRH increased the concentration of SPC in lavage fluid but not lung tissue. Neither cortisol nor TRH significantly affected lung distensibility [V40; 0.64 +/- 0.04 and 0.57 +/- 0.10 (SE) ml/g, respectively, vs. 0.41 +/- 0.03 ml/g in controls] or stability (V5; 0.24 +/- 0.01 and 0.35 +/- 0.07 ml/g vs. 0.24 +/- 0.03 ml/g), whereas treatment with a combination of the two hormones was associated with a fourfold increase in V40 (1.70 +/- 0.16 ml/g) and V5 (1.03 +/- 0.15 ml/g). Since raised concentrations of cortisol, triiodothyronine, and estradiol-17 beta (treatment with cortisol) had no effect on V40 and V5, whereas similar hormonal changes associated with elevated prolactin levels (treatment with cortisol plus TRH) had marked effects, we conclude that prolactin plays an essential part in the synergism of cortisol and TRH.\r"

Intracellular Cl fell rapidly when ouabain or furosemide was added, indicating that isolated tracheal submucosal gland cells concentrate Cl above its electrochemical equilibrium concentration. Acetylcholine (ACh) caused a Ca2+-dependent decline in cell Cl, with an effective concentration for a 50% response (EC50) of 62 nM; this loss of cell Cl was blocked by atropine or pirenzepine. The EC50 was 6 nM in cells when 95% of the acetylcholinesterase activity was abolished by diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP) treatment. ACh continued to cause a decline in cell Cl even after a 7-day course of DFP treatment, which has been shown to abolish ACh-stimulated mucous glycoprotein secretion (23). After the 7-day course of DFP treatment, the EC50 for ACh increased to 77 nM. Thus the Cl economy of the tracheal submucosal gland cell resembles that of cells in epithelia that secrete fluid; in addition, the transmitter-dependent loss of cell Cl is under long-term metabolic control of the cell.\r"

Sodium valproate administration resulted in a 40% decrease in plasma somatostatin concentrations in the normal subjects and a 63% decrease in the somatostatinoma patient, respectively, compared to the response to placebo. Plasma C-peptide concentrations did not change in any subject. Fasting blood glucose levels decreased in the somatostatinoma patient during sodium valproate administration. These results suggest that endogenous GABA may play some role in the release of somatostatin, but not in the release of insulin.\r"

An iv bolus injection of GHRH-(1-44)-NH2 (1 microgram/kg BW) only slightly increased plasma GH concentrations in MD patients. The mean peak plasma GH level after GHRH injection [4.2 +/- 0.8 (+/- SE) micrograms/L] was significantly lower than that in 10 age-matched normal subjects (26.7 +/- 4.3 micrograms/L) or that in 6 patients with progressive muscular dystrophy (22.8 +/- 6.6 micrograms/L) whose nutritional status was similar to that of the MD patients. Even with a larger dose of GHRH (3 micrograms/kg BW), the plasma GH rises were minimal in the MD patients (mean peak, 5.9 +/- 1.8 micrograms/L). The plasma GH responses to a 30-min iv infusion of arginine (0.5 g/kg BW) and oral ingestion of L-dopa (0.5 g) were attenuated to a similar extent, whereas insulin-induced hypoglycemia caused a significant increase in plasma GH in all seven MD patients [mean peak, 17.4 +/- 4.1 (+/- SE) microgram/L]. The plasma TSH responses to TRH and plasma insulin-like growth factor I levels were similar in the MD patients and normal subjects. These findings suggest that 1) the impaired GH release after GHRH, arginine, and L-dopa administration in MD patients is not due to somatotroph deficiency, since the GH response to hypoglycemia is well preserved; and 2) insulin-induced hypoglycemia may stimulate GH release at least in part via inhibition of somatostatin release.\r"

All of the impotent men had normal general physical examinations, penile Doppler tests, psychological tests, and peripheral nerve conduction. Serum PRL, FSH, LH, and thyroid hormone concentrations were normal as were the results of provocative tests of TSH, gonadotropin, and PRL secretion. The mean serum immunoreactive LH (I-LH) levels, measured in each impotent and normal man in three samples taken at 15-min intervals, were similar [7.2 +/- 0.5 (+/-SE) vs. 6.4 +/- 0.5 mIU/mL (IU/L)]. In contrast, the mean serum bioactive LH (B-LH) level was significantly lower in the impotent men than in the normal men [15.9 +/- 2.1 (+/-SE) vs. 33.0 +/- 2.8 mIU/mL (IU/L); P less than 0.05], as was the LH bio- to immunoactive (B/I) ratio (2.1 +/- 0.2 vs. 5.6 +/- 0.5; P less than 0.02). The mean serum testosterone level in the impotent men, although all individual values were within the range of normal for our laboratory [200-900 ng/100 mL (693-3120 nmol/L)], was 25% lower than that in the normal men [347 +/- 23 vs. 450 +/- 26 ng/100 mL; P less than 0.05 (1204 +/- 81 vs. 1560 +/- 91 nmol/L)]. In addition, a significant positive correlation was found between serum testosterone levels and LH B/I ratios in the impotent men (r = 0.45; P = 0.029). Pulsatile LH secretion, measured in six impotent and four normal men in blood samples collected every 15 min for 6 h, was similar in the two groups. The mean serum I-LH levels were similar [7.5 +/- 1.1 (+/-SE) vs. 5.1 +/- 1.0 mIU/mL (IU/L)], while the mean serum B-LH level as well as the LH B/I ratio was significantly lower in the impotent men throughout the observation period [11.4 +/- 2.0 (+/-SE) vs. 26.0 +/- 3.2 mIU/mL (IU/L) and 1.4 +/- 0.2 vs. 5.4 +/- 0.6; P less than 0.05 and P less than 0.02, respectively]. The B-LH pulse amplitude in the impotent men was reduced [mean peak LH, 8.6 +/- 0.3 vs. 25.3 +/- 4.0 mIU/mL (IU/L); P less than 0.05], while the LH pulse frequency was similar in the two groups.

Confluent primary cultures of human amnion epithelial cells were adapted to serum-free medium and treated with the agonists for up to 8 h. Cumulative PGE2 output in the medium was measured by RIA. TPA, a potent activator of protein kinase-C, stimulated basal PGE2 output from less than 50 pg/well.5 h to 3 ng/well.5 h (P less than 0.01) in a time- and dose-dependent manner. 4-Methoxy-TPA, a weak tumor promoter derivative of TPA, was ineffective when tested in the same concentration range as TPA (1 nmol/L to 1 mumol/L). Neither calcium ionophore A23187 (20 nmol/L) nor arachidonate (1 mumol/L) stimulated PGE2 output alone, but each agonist potentiated the effect of TPA as much as 5-fold (P less than 0.01). 1,2-Dioctanoyl-sn-glycerol stimulated PGE2 output 4- to 7-fold (P less than 0.05), and this effect was potentiated by Ca ionophore and arachidonate. Studies involving actinomycin-D and cycloheximide indicated that the stimulatory effect of TPA was dependent on RNA synthesis during the first 60 min and on protein synthesis during the entire length of the phorbol ester treatment period (300 min). TPA was also able to stimulate PGE2 production after irreversible inactivation of PG endoperoxide synthase activity with acetylsalicylic acid. These results suggest that activation of protein kinase-C in amnion cells increases the de novo synthesis of the PG endoperoxide synthase enzyme in a RNA synthesis-dependent manner. Elevated intracellular calcium levels contribute to the stimulation apparently by increasing the availability of endogenous arachidonate for subsequent conversion to PGE2.\r"

Use of a sensitive immunoradiometric assay specific for PTH-(1-84) made it possible to determine the full range of PTH responses to perturbations in the extracellular calcium concentration. By progressively increasing the rate of administration of calcium gluconate or EDTA during rapid or slow infusions, linear rates of change in the serum calcium concentration were achieved in eight men. The slopes were 2-fold greater during the rapid infusions. Both the calcium infusions decreased serum PTH-(1-84) levels from a mean of 23.2 +/- 2.0 (+/- SE) to 6.4 +/- 1.0 and 5.6 +/- 1.0 ng/L for the rapid and slow infusions, respectively, with no obvious rate dependence. The rapid or slow EDTA infusions increased serum PTH levels to the same maximal extent (95.0 +/- 20.2 and 99.9 +/- 14.5 ng/L, respectively), also with no significant rate dependence. Thus, there was no effect of the rate of change of calcium on the PTH response, which was reflected in similar inverse sigmoidal relationships between PTH and serum total and plasma ionized calcium when the data for the slow and rapid infusions were pooled separately. Similar sigmoidal curves were found in normal women. These data suggest the feasibility of using calcium and EDTA infusions combined with an intact PTH assay to define the relationships between circulating levels of PTH-(1-84) and calcium in states of normal and deranged parathyroid physiology.\r"

Within the acromegalic group, the percent suppression of basal and GHRH-stimulated GH secretion was inversely correlated with both basal plasma GH (r = -0.751; P = 0.03 and r = -0.727; P = 0.04, respectively) and insulin-like growth factor I (r = -0.800; P = 0.02 and r = -0.727; P = 0.04, respectively) concentrations. The in vitro sensitivity to SRIH was studied in pituitary adenomas from five of the acromegalic patients in 3- to 4-day monolayer cultures of dispersed cells. The SRIH IC50 values were lowest in the tumors (8.6-44 pmol/L) from the three patients who had in vivo SRIH sensitivity (suppression of GHRH-stimulated GH secretion) comparable to that in the normal subjects. The IC50 values were higher in the tumors (150 and 21,000 pmol/L) from the two patients that were least responsive to SRIH in vivo. These results indicate that there is considerable variability of SRIH sensitivity in patients with acromegaly. Although the role of this defect in the pathogenesis of acromegaly is uncertain, it may be an important determinant in the degree of elevation of plasma GH levels.\r"

To assess the role of glycogen synthase phosphatase as a possible mediator of reduced glycogen synthase activity, we studied 30 Southwestern American Indians with a broad range of insulin action in vivo. Percutaneous biopsies of the vastus lateralis muscle were performed before and during a 440-min euglycemic clamp at plasma insulin concentrations of 89 +/- 5 and 1,470 +/- 49 microU/ml (mean +/- SEM); simultaneous glucose oxidation was determined by indirect calorimetry. After insulin stimulation, glycogen synthase activity was correlated with the total and nonoxidative glucose disposal at both low (r = 0.73, P less than 0.0001; r = 0.68, P less than 0.0001) and high (r = 0.75, P less than 0.0001; r = 0.74, P less than 0.0001) plasma insulin concentrations.

In addition, fasting glycogen synthase phosphatase activity was correlated with glycogen synthase activity after low- (r = 0.47, P less than 0.05) and high- (r = 0.50, P less than 0.01) dose insulin stimulations. These data suggest that the decreased insulin-stimulated glucose disposal and reduced glycogen synthase activation observed in insulin resistance could be secondary to a low fasting glycogen synthase phosphatase activity.\r"

  ".W": "Hemorrhage within the central nervous system (CNS) may be associated with subsequent development of seizure states or paralysis. Prior investigations indicate that hemoglobin, released from extravasated erythrocytes, may be toxic to the CNS by promoting peroxidation of lipids and inhibition of Na,K-ATPase. These deleterious effects are blocked both in vitro and in vivo by the Fe3+ chelator, desferrioxamine, indicating the involvement of free iron derived from hemoglobin. We now report that the Fe2+ chelator, ferene, also inhibits methemoglobin- and ferric iron-mediated CNS lipid oxidation, reflecting the reduction of Fe3+ by some component of the CNS. This reduction is apparent in the accumulation of the highly chromophoric ferene: Fe2+ chelate after the addition of Fe3+ salts to supernatants of murine brain homogenates. Because large amounts of ascorbic acid occur in mammalian CNS, we suspected that this reducing substance might be responsible. Indeed, the peroxidative effects of hemoglobin and iron on murine brain are blocked by washing of CNS membranes or by preincubation of crude homogenates with ascorbate oxidase. Furthermore, the addition of ascorbate to washed CNS membranes fully restores hemoglobin/iron-driven peroxidation. We conclude that posthemorrhagic CNS dysfunction may stem from damaging redox reactions between hemoglobin iron, ascorbic acid, and oxidizable components of the nervous system.\r"

To determine the direct effects of toxin A on intestinal epithelial permeability and structure in the absence of other modulating factors, we used cultured monolayers of a human intestinal epithelial cell line (T84). A toxin A concentration of 7 x 10(-1) micrograms/ml (3 x 10(-9) M) nearly abolished monolayer transepithelial resistance within 6-8 h. This marked permeability defect occurred while the monolayers were still confluent. Dual sodium-mannitol flux studies localized the permeability defect to the intercellular tight junction. Cytotoxicity assays and morphological evaluation using Nomarski optics and electron microscopy failed to demonstrate any evidence of cell damage at the time the maximum resistance response was observed. Fluorescent staining for F actin, however, revealed a marked decrease in fluorescent intensity in toxin-treated monolayers versus controls. These data show that toxin A can directly affect the barrier function of this model intestinal epithelium and initially does so by selectively enhancing tight junction permeability. Furthermore, cytoskeletal structure is markedly altered over the same time course, although the integrity of individual cells is maintained. Because the cytoskeleton of intestinal epithelial cells is known to be capable of regulating tight junction permeability, we speculate that the above effects of toxin A on epithelial barrier function result from alterations of the cytoskeleton.\r"

  ".W": "Previously we showed that hypocaloric amounts of glucose reduce leucine catabolism while an isocaloric amount of fat does not (1985. J. Clin. Invest. 76:737.). This study was designed to investigate whether the same difference exists when the entire caloric need is provided either as glucose or lipid. Rats were maintained for 3 d on total parenteral nutrition (350 cal/kg per d), after which the infusion of amino acids was discontinued and rats received the same amount of calories entirely as glucose or lipid for three more days. A third group of rats was infused with saline for 3 d. In comparison to glucose, lipid infusion resulted in higher urinary nitrogen excretion (55 +/- 3 vs. 37 +/- 2 mg N/24 h, P less than 0.05), muscle concentrations of tyrosine (95 +/- 8 vs. 42 +/- 8 microM, P less than 0.01), and leucine (168 +/- 19 vs. 84 +/- 16 microM, P less than 0.01), activity of BCKA dehydrogenase in muscle (2.2 +/- 0.2 vs. 1.4 +/- 0.04 nmol/mg protein per 30 min, P less than 0.05), and whole body rate of leucine oxidation (3.3 +/- 0.5 vs. 1.4 +/- 0.2 mumol/100 g per h, P less than 0.05). However, all these parameters were significantly lower in lipid-infused than starved rats. There was no significant difference between leucine incorporation into liver and muscle proteins of lipid and glucose-infused rats. On the other hand, starved rats showed a lower leucine incorporation into liver proteins. The data show that under conditions of adequate caloric intake lipid has an inhibitory effect on leucine catabolism but not as great as that of glucose. The mechanism of this difference may be related to a lesser inhibition of muscle protein degradation by lipid than glucose, thereby increasing the leucine pool, which in turn stimulates leucine oxidation.\r"

  ".U": "89034859\r", 
  ".W": "The objective of this study was to investigate the elastin repair process in the rat aortic smooth muscle cell culture after proteolytic injury. Although little studied in vivo, elastin repair is thought to occur through a sequential process involving enzymatic removal (debridement) of damaged fibers followed by synthesis of tropoelastin, its subsequent processing, and eventual incorporation into new insoluble elastin. A second repair mechanism of proteolytically damaged elastin in a culture system is reported here. Repair in this system relates directly to restoration of resistance to elastin solubilization by hot alkali. As expected, severe injuries were observed with porcine pancreatic elastase (PPE). Using PPE, only 6% of the elastin, relative to control, was resistant to hot alkali immediately after elastase treatment. 4 wk later, resistance to hot alkali had increased dramatically to a mean of 90%. Repair took longer after injury with 75 micrograms of PPE as compared with 50 micrograms of PPE. The limited elastic fiber proteolysis induced by either human neutrophil elastase or porcine trypsin was repaired in culture within 2 wk. Elastin that had been radiolabeled with [3H]lysine 4-5 wk before injury was converted from a hot NaOH-susceptible to a NaOH-resistant elastin fraction during recovery from PPE injury. At the same time, the frayed elastic fibers that were seen with the electron microscope immediately after PPE treatment were replaced by continuous bands of elastin that resembled those in control cultures. Restoration of NaOH resistance did not require a net increase in total cell layer elastin, suggesting that relatively little new tropoelastin incorporation into the cell layer was required for this type of repair. These results suggested a salvage repair mechanism for proteolytically damaged elastin.\r"

  ".W": "Leukotriene (LT) B4 is an important pro-inflammatory autocoid. In order to investigate the potential role of this eicosanoid in renal inflammation, in this study we determined the capability of glomeruli to synthesize this mediator. Glomeruli were able to synthesize LTB4 when provided with exogenous substrate in a dose-dependent fashion in the presence of ionophore A23187. Ionophore, although by itself a weak agonist for LTB4 formation, was required for LTB4 production from exogenous arachidonate. The identity of LTB4 was confirmed by specific radioimmunoassay, high pressure liquid chromatography, and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. The synthesis of LTB4 was inhibited by BW755C (a lipoxygenase/cyclooxygenase inhibitor) but not indomethacin. Essential fatty acid (EFA) deficiency, obtained by the deprivation of (n-6) fatty acids, is known to exert a protective effect in renal inflammatory states. This dietary manipulation markedly attenuated the ability of glomeruli to synthesize LTB4. In contrast, the synthesis of cyclooxygenase products from exogenous arachidonate was increased by EFA deficiency. Because EFA deficiency has been shown to deplete glomeruli of resident mesangial macrophages, it was hypothesized that this effect accounted for the diminished LTB4 synthesis. To test this hypothesis, glomeruli were depleted of macrophages using x-irradiation. Glomeruli from these animals exhibited a marked decrease in LTB4 synthesis. Glomerular synthesis of cyclooxygenase products was unaffected by irradiation. In sum, glomeruli have the capability to synthesize LTB4, and this capacity is correlated with the presence of glomerular macrophages. EFA deficiency attenuates the ability of glomeruli to synthesize LTB4 by depleting them of macrophages.\r"

  ".W": "In five patients with venous thromboembolic disease treated with recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA), there was a marked increase in the mean concentrations of fibrinopeptide A (from 0.6 to 5.9 nM; P less than 0.0001) and desarginine fibrinopeptide B (from 5.6 nM to 24.1 nM; P less than 0.01) 30 min after a bolus of rt-PA (0.6 mg/kg). Thrombin was unlikely to be responsible because the levels of desarginine fibrinopeptide B exceeded those of fibrinopeptide A and the changes occurred despite concomitant heparin therapy. The purpose of this study therefore, was to determine whether rt-PA directly releases the fibrinopeptides from fibrinogen. Incubation of rt-PA with heparinized plasma or purified fibrinogen resulted in time and dose-dependent release of both fibrinopeptide A and B. Contaminating thrombin was not responsible for this activity by the following criteria: the rate of rt-PA mediated fibrinopeptide B release was considerably faster than that of fibrinopeptide A, and fibrinopeptide release was unaffected by heparin, hirudin, or a monospecific antithrombin IgG. Aprotinin also had no effect on fibrinopeptide release, indicating that this activity was not plasmin mediated. Fibrinopeptide release was shown to be due to rt-PA because this activity was completely blocked by a monoclonal antibody against the enzyme. Further, the specificity of rt-PA for the thrombin cleavage sites on fibrinogen was confirmed by the demonstration that rt-PA released fibrinopeptide A or fibrinopeptide B from fibrinopeptide A or B-containing substrates, respectively. These studies thus demonstrate that (a) rt-PA releases fibrinopeptides A and B from fibrinogen thereby indicating that this enzyme is not specific for plasminogen, and (b) plasma fibrinopeptide A and desarginine fibrinopeptide B levels are not specific markers of thrombin action on fibrinogen in patients receiving rt-PA.\r"

We previously demonstrated high-affinity, specific, and functional binding of Glu-PLG as well as tissue plasminogen activator to cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). In the present study, we demonstrate binding of Lys-PLG to HUVEC, as well as conversion of Glu-PLG to Lys-PLG at the cell surface. Binding of Lys-PLG to HUVEC was saturable, reversible, epsilon-aminocaproic acid-sensitive, and involved two saturable sites with Kd's of 142 pM and 120 nM, respectively. Upon incubation with Glu-PLG, HUVEC, as well as endothelium in situ, partially converted the ligand to a Lys-PLG-like species. Conversion by HUVEC was blocked by diisopropyl-fluorophosphate, but not by other serine protease inhibitors, including alpha 2-plasmin inhibitor. Eluates of intact umbilical cord vessels contained Lys-PLG by immunoblot analysis. Lys-PLG was also identified immunohistochemically on the endothelial surface of vessels from a variety of normal and inflamed tissues. Thus, endothelial cells appear to actively modify circulating Glu-PLG, bind Lys-PLG to their surface, and thus enhance the fibrinolytic potential of the blood vessel wall.\r"

Kupffer cells obtained from normal uninfected old mice had good levels of listericidal activity, but Kupffer cells obtained from normal young mice could not kill Listeria.

Tolerant B cells showed clear defects in intermediate activation events in addition to a deficit in antibody-secreting cells. In these studies, isolated B cells were stimulated by T cell independent Ag with lymphokines, or with mitogens, in the absence of filler cells. The number of antibody-secreting cells generated from the tolerant population was consistently reduced by 70 to 80% of the control response to the specific Ag, fluoresceinated Brucella abortus (FL-BrA) +/- lymphokines. We found that similar numbers of normal and tolerant cells enlarged (entered cell cycle) when stimulated by FL-BrA, LPS, IL-4, or alpha-Ig coupled to dextran (alpha-Ig-dex). Ia induction stimulated by IL-4, LPS, FL-BrA, or alpha-Ig-dex was the same in normal and tolerant cells. However, DNA synthesis stimulated by FL-BrA, FL-BrA + IL-5, or suboptimal concentrations of LPS was reduced by 70% in the tolerant cell population. Proliferation in response to 50 micrograms/ml LPS or to low doses of alpha-Ig-dex was similar in normal and tolerant B cells. These data suggest that the primary defect in adult B cell tolerance is the ability to proliferate in response to Ag.\r"

  ".W": "We have shown previously that high levels of IFN-beta were generated in vitro from spleen cells obtained from mice experiencing graft vs host disease (GVHD). However, very little or no IFN-gamma was found in these cultures even when IL-2 or Con A was added as a stimulant of IFN-gamma production. This study was undertaken to determine if the IFNs were similarly produced in vivo during the GVH reaction and to further explore the inability of GVHD spleen cells to produce IFN-gamma in vitro. GVHD was induced across minor histocompatibilities by the i.v. injection of B10.D2 spleen cells into sub-lethally irradiated BALB/c mice. Using cytoplasmic immunofluorescence to detect IFN-beta and -gamma, both IFNs were readily detectable in vivo in spleens of mice undergoing GVHD. IFN-gamma demonstrated a distinct distribution pattern, localizing in the peri-arteriolar lymphoid regions of the spleen, whereas IFN-beta immunofluorescence appeared diffusely in all areas. Expression of both IFN-beta and -gamma was shown to be dependent on the GVH reaction, inasmuch as syngeneic controls and mice given T cell-depleted donor cells had little immunofluorescence. These results contradict in vitro data in that IFN-gamma cannot be found in GVHD spleen cell cultures even in the presence of Con A. This in vitro unresponsiveness appeared to be due to the mixing of different cell populations as a result of preparing splenic single-cell suspensions. Percoll gradient fractionation of GVH spleen cells yielded a cell population which, when stimulated with Con A, produced IFN-gamma and underwent cell proliferation. This study represents the first description of the in vivo splenic distributions of IFN-beta and -gamma during GVHD, and presents data that suggest that in vitro results may not truly reflect in vivo immune responsiveness. Thus, the IFNs may play a critical role in the complex events leading to the GVHD syndrome.\r"

  ".W": "The reported effects of the monocyte-derived cytokine IL-1 on human B lymphocytes are both varied and controversial. IL-1 has been reported to augment both proliferation and Ig secretion of previously activated human B cells. In the present study highly purified splenic B cells were cultured with rIL-1 before, simultaneously with, and after the addition of the polyclonal B cell mitogen, anti-Ig. rIL-1 had no significant effect on B cell proliferation when added simultaneously with or after B cell activation with anti-Ig. However, incubation of splenic B cells with rIL-1 for 24 h before stimulation with anti-Ig appeared to enhance mitogenesis. With the observation that rIL-1 exerted effects on resting B cells, the effect of rIL-1 on several events which accompany B cell activation was examined. rIL-1 failed to stimulate RNA synthesis, effect increases in cell size or intracellular Ca2+ levels, or lead to the hyperexpression of MHC class II or B cell activation Ag. These studies suggest that rIL-1 does not activate B cells but primes them to respond to subsequent activation.\r"

  ".U": "89035461\r", 
  ".W": "Murine B lymphocytes cultured for 24 h with rIL-4 lost (mean reduction of 88%, range 81 to 96%) the capacity to bind Ag-IgG antibody complexes to B lymphocytes as assessed by flow microfluorometry. This effect was specific in that it was not seen with IL-1, IL-2, or IFN-gamma; IL-4 did not have a similar effect on other B lymphocyte membrane molecules; and the effect was completely prevented by anti-IL-4 (mAb 11B11). More than 60% inhibition of the binding of complexes was seen with as little as 1 U/ml of IL-4 although maximal inhibition was seen with greater than or equal to 30 U/ml. IL-4-induced inhibition of the binding of complexes was time dependent (the effect was first seen after 8 h and was not maximal until 24 h), temperature dependent (it did not occur at 4 degrees C), and reversible (B lymphocytes that had lost the ability to bind complexes due to IL-4 regained this capacity when re-cultured for 24 h in the absence of IL-4). The effect could be partially prevented by IFN-gamma. The inability to bind complexes appeared to be mainly due to an alteration of Fc gamma R (Fc Receptors) II rather than down-regulation of receptor expression because IL-4 induced only a moderate reduction in the binding of two Fc gamma R II specific mAb (20% for 2.4G2 and 32% for K9.361). The IL-4-induced loss of binding of complexes to B lymphocyte Fc gamma R II appears to be a novel form of receptor regulation (function rather than expression), and likely plays a role in the up-regulation of B lymphocytes by IL-4 by preventing Fc gamma R II-mediated inhibition of B lymphocyte responses.\r"

  ".U": "89035463\r", 
  ".W": "The regulation of the activation of T lymphocyte proliferation is not well understood. It is known that the tumor promoter, PMA, which activates protein kinase C (PKC), can induce the proliferation of several murine CTL clones; in combination with calcium ionophores, which raise the level of intracellular Ca2+, PMA can also stimulate the proliferation of several HTL clones. Activation of the TCR is believed to result in the liberation of diacylglycerol, which is an activator of PKC, and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, which stimulates an increase in intracellular levels of calcium. We now report that pretreatment with cholera toxin (CT) inhibits the proliferation of murine T cell clones stimulated through the TCR/CD3 complex. In addition, CT-pretreatment blocks the proliferation of CTL clones activated with PMA or of HTL clones activated with PMA + calcium ionophore. In contrast, CT-pre-treatment inhibits much less effectively (100- to 1000-fold) the proliferation of these T cell clones stimulated with IL-2. Furthermore, activators of PKC, but not IL-2, potentiate the CT-induced cAMP elevation in T cell clones. The ability of CT to inhibit much more effectively the proliferation triggered by putative activators of PKC than that induced by IL-2 may be mediated by cAMP-dependent mechanisms.\r"

  ".U": "89035481\r", 
  ".W": "We have shown previously that stimulation of cloned murine T lymphocytes via the TCR inhibits their responsiveness to rIL-2. Signaling via the TCR is believed to result in a variety of biochemical events that include a rise in intracellular free calcium and activation (translocation) of protein kinase C. These two signals also can be generated by calcium ionophores, such as ionomycin, and by activators of protein kinase C, such as PMA. We report here that treatment of cloned murine T lymphocytes with PMA, ionomycin, or the combination led to a dose-dependent inhibition of IL-2-dependent proliferation but did not inhibit lymphokine secretion. Concentrations of PMA and ionomycin that maximally inhibited proliferation stimulated maximal lymphokine secretion and increased mitochondrial activity as assessed by measurement of cleavage of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium-bromide. Furthermore, PMA, ionomycin, the combination, or immobilized anti-CD3 mAb added after 12 to 16 h of culture with IL-2 could inhibit proliferation. These results demonstrate that PMA and ionomycin mimic stimulation of the TCR by high concentrations of immobilized anti-TCR mAb in that proliferation is inhibited and lymphokine secretion is induced. In addition, PMA or ionomycin could independently inhibit proliferation of some cells. These findings suggest that alternative mechanisms exist to regulate proliferation. Either increased levels of intracellular calcium or the physiologic events corresponding to those induced by PMA can inhibit IL-2-dependent replication of T lymphocytes.\r"

To evaluate cellular defects that may predispose infected mice to these sequelae, we studied the regulation of IFN gene expression. Spleen cells from mice infected with LP-BM5 MuLV expressed high levels of IFN-gamma mRNA by 1 wk post-inoculation and throughout the course of disease. By comparison, transcripts of IFN-alpha/beta genes were not detected in spleen cells at any time after infection. In uninfected mice, expression of IFN-alpha/beta genes is induced rapidly after infection with New-castle disease virus, but mice inoculated with LP-BM5 MuLV were unable to induce these genes by 4 wk after retroviral infection. Inhibition of IFN-alpha/beta induction due to LP-BM5 MuLV infection also occurred in nude mice, indicating this effect was not mediated by activated T cells. Furthermore, low levels of IFN-gamma transcripts were detected in spleens of nude infected mice, suggesting that cells other than T cells can express this gene. These results suggest that the normal contributions of IFN to control of microbial spread, immune surveillance, and lymphoid interactions are disrupted by infection with LP-BM5 MuLV.\r"

These CH gene alterations were found on productive, non-productive, and 14q+ chromosomes. These data support the concept of a non-specific (common) switch recombinase activity that is often ineffective. No evidence of such switch recombination was found in 25 mu- or mu+ pre-B cell leukemias with the single exception of a mu- pre-B leukemia in which subsets of the cells were producing gamma- or alpha-H chains. The switch recombinase activity gamma- or alpha-H chains. The switch recombinase activity may be restricted to the B cell lineage, inasmuch as CH gene deletions were not observed in T lineage malignancies.\r"

These libraries were generated through chronic immunization regimes that induce responses dominated by clonotypes available at the age of initial immunization. Dot blot analyses of cytoplasmic RNA from these hybridomas were performed to determine the Ig H chain V region (VH) families associated with the repertoire at each age. Although genes from most known VH families can generate hemagglutinin-specific antibodies, clonotypes prevalent during the first week of life disproportionately use VH7183 gene segments. In contrast, hybridomas representative of the repertoire in 2-wk-old individuals preferentially use VHS107, VH36-60, and VHX24 gene segments. These results demonstrate changes in VH gene family predominance that correlate with the age-related patterns of clonal emergence and turnover previously shown in the hemagglutinin-reactive B cell pool. Taken together, these findings suggest that the very early neonatal Ag-responsive B cell pool closely reflects preferential VH gene rearrangements within the pre-B cell compartment. Further, they suggest that either non-random strategies of VH gene expression, or selective clonal expansion strategies based on VH, operate even at later stages of development.\r"

  ".W": "This work describes the successful use of bispecific F(ab' gamma)2 antibody (Ab) in combination with a ribosome-inactivating protein (RIP), saporin, for the treatment of neoplastic disease in vivo. A total of three thioether-linked F(ab' gamma)2 heterodimers were prepared, each having dual specificities for saporin and the guinea pig lymphoblastic leukemia, L2C. In all three cases specificity for the L2C cells was provided by a high affinity mouse anti-idiotype (anti-Id) mAb, whereas the antisaporin activity came from either one of two mouse mAb or an affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal Ab. In vitro studies, measuring protein synthesis, showed that all three derivatives were extremely efficient at delivering saporin to L2C cells, to the extent that addition of the rabbit Fab' gamma-containing bispecific Ab to cell culture at 1 microgram/ml increased the toxicity of saporin (50% inhibiting concentration) by close to 90,000-fold. Similarly, in leukemic guinea pigs, a small dose of saporin (10 micrograms) which by itself showed no therapeutic effect, was able to completely eradicate Id-positive tumor when given in combination with an excess of bispecific Ab. Although tumors did eventually emerge in most of these animals, immunofluorescence analysis showed that in almost all instances the escaping cells were Id- variants of the L2C. Experiments to define the optimal treatment regimen in this model showed that, although the administration of saporin and bispecific Ab at separate sites could be therapeutically effective, mixing the Ab and saporin to form immune complexes before injection did generally enhance their performance. A molar surplus of bispecific Ab in these mixtures both extended the metabolic survival of the saporin and enhanced the therapeutic performance, with molar ratios above 3:1 generally being required for optimum treatment when using saporin at 10 micrograms. Derivatives containing polyclonal antisaporin were more efficient than those containing mAb, yielding optimum therapeutic results with a molar ratio of 1.5:1 when combined with 10 micrograms saporin. These findings have shown that bispecific F(ab' gamma)2 Ab, as well as being straightforward to prepare, can also function as an extremely efficient vector for delivering cytotoxic agents such as ribosome-inactivating protein to unwanted cells in vivo.\r"

Optimum responses were obtained when the average distance between peptide-Ia complexes was of the order of 200 A. This implies that T cell activation by Ag-MHC requires cross-linking of the TCR via closely packed Ag-MHC complexes. The same dose response curve to the preformed complexes was obtained whether one used a fixed concentration of Ia and varied the peptide concentration or a fixed concentration of peptide and varied the Ia concentration. In both cases there was a linear relationship between the number of peptide-Ia complexes and the response of the T cells. The association between Ia and peptide in vitro is an inefficient process, requiring prolonged incubation and a large excess of peptide over Ia. Once formed, however, the complex is extremely stable with no detectable dissociation at neutral pH after days at 4 degrees C. With several different preparations of Ia it was found that only about 10 to 20% of the purified Ia is capable of forming the long-lived complex with peptide.\r"

T cell clones were generated by stimulating individual peripheral blood T cells with PHA by a procedure that yielded a growing clone from a mean of greater than 92% of the cultured cells. A total of 65 T cell clones (44 CD4+ and 21 CD8+) generated from two individual donors were examined for their functional capabilities. All T cell clones examined secreted IL-2, IFN-gamma, and lymphotoxin/tumor necrosis factor like activity when stimulated with immobilized mAb to the CD3 complex (64.1). When 54 additional T cell clones from a third donor were analyzed, all were found to produce IL-2. Upon activation with immobilized 64.1, all CD4+ clones and 91% of the CD8+ clones induced the generation of Ig-secreting cells from purified B cells. The CD8+ clones that did not serve as Th cells alone were able to augment the capacity of fresh CD4+ cells to generate Ig-secreting cells. Each of these clones was also found to effect MHC-unrestricted cytotoxicity upon activation with immobilized 64.1. The CD8+ clones were somewhat more effective killers than CD4+ clones, although there was considerable overlap. A total of 18 clones was analyzed for TCR beta-chain gene rearrangement. Of the clones exhibiting rearrangements of the beta-chain gene, 94% were found to have a single rearrangement pattern. Finally, the detailed phenotype of 15 (11 CD4+ and 4 CD8+) of these clones was examined. Variable numbers of cells of each of the clones expressed Ag identified by mAb 4B4 (CD29), Leu 8, Leu 15 (CD11b), and NKH1. Moreover, cells of 6 of 11 CD4+ clones and 4 of 4 CD8+ clones also expressed CD45R in addition to CD29; expression of CD45R and CD29 varied with the activation status of the clone. The current data demonstrate that nearly all of the T cell clones were able to accomplish each of the functions examined regardless of the surface phenotype. Inasmuch as the clones were generated using a technique that expanded more than 92% of the circulating T cells, the data imply that the progeny of the vast majority of T cells may have the inherent capacity to exert a wide array of functional activities.\r"

In marked contrast, bi-valent cross-linking of CD8 inhibits the generation of CD8+ CTL from precursor cells and fails to induce down-modulation of cell surface CD8 expression. These results demonstrate that CD8 can transduce net positive signals, but only when the molecule is extensively cross-linked.\r"

Apparent preferential presentation by Mlsa vs Mlsb APC obtained from H-2-identical strains was seen infrequently, and when observed, analysis with the use of APC from recombinant inbred lines revealed that preferential presentation did not correlate with the Mls genotype of the APC.

This method of permeabilization leads to stable transmembrane channels that permit the introduction of small molecules into the cell but preserves the cellular structures and macromolecular contents of the CTL. We used the exocytosis of CTL-specific serine esterases as a marker of T cell activation. The TCR-activated exocytosis is functioning in such permeabilized CTL. Introduction of the membrane impermeable guanosine nucleotide-binding protein (G-protein) activating GTP-analog GTP gamma S into CTL triggers exocytosis if Ca2+ is present. For optimal exocytosis ATP is required. The G-protein inactivating GDP-analog GDP beta S inhibited exocytosis triggered via the TCR-CD3 complex but not that triggered by activating the protein kinase C. If the protein kinase C was depleted in CTL by overnight incubation with phorbolester, the response to GTP-gamma S was reduced by more than 50%. These experiments demonstrate the presence of a G-protein involved in TCR-mediated CTL triggering. In the sequence of signaling steps this G-protein is localized after TCR-triggering but before the formation of the protein kinase C-activating phosphoinositol breakdown product diacylglycerol in the sequence of signaling steps.\r"

To study further the function of these cells, the proliferative and cytotoxic responses of highly purified CD8/Leu-7-positive cells were studied in vitro. These cells had low proliferative responses when exposed to PHA or mitogenic anti-CD3 mAb compared to CD8/Leu-7-negative cells, and their proliferative responses were significantly lower after addition of IL-2 or autologous adherent cells. However, the proliferative responses of both Leu-7-positive and Leu-7-negative CD8 cells were similar when stimulated with PHA, Ionomycin, or anti-CD3 in combination with phorbol ester. In addition, CD8/Leu-7-positive cells demonstrated high proliferative responses when exposed to a combination of both PHA and SRBC, and these responses could be inhibited by prior addition of non-stimulating anti-CD2.1 mAb. CD8/Leu-7-positive cells, but not CD8/Leu-7-negative cells, mediated lectin- and anti-CD3-induced cytotoxicity against K562 target cells. Cytotoxicity was in part dependent on the CD2 Ag because it was inhibited by anti-CD2.1 mAb. Finally, when small CD8-positive T cells having low cytotoxic potential were activated with PHA plus SRBC, but not PHA alone, there was significant enhancement of their cytotoxic function. Thus, the CD2 receptor may be an important activation pathway for cytotoxic cells.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of granulocyte-macrophage (GM)-CSF on the synthesis of MHC class II molecules and on the Ag presentation capacity by bone marrow derived macrophages (BMM phi) was investigated. BMM phi obtained by in vitro culture in the presence of macrophage-CSF were negative for synthesis of I-A molecules and induced the Ag-mediated proliferation of insulin-specific T clone cells with lower efficiency than splenic accessory cells. After pulse treatment with GM-CSF for 24 to 48 h, day 12 BMM phi exhibited highly efficient Ag presentation function which was superior to that induced by IFN-gamma. Expression of membrane-bound IL-1 was augmented significantly by GM-CSF, but not by IFN-gamma. However, the T cell clone used to probe for accessory cell function of BMM phi was not dependent on IL-1 for optimal proliferation. Concomitantly, GM-CSF induced the de novo synthesis of I-A molecules, although to a lesser extent than optimal doses of IFN-gamma. Thus GM-CSF appears to elicit properties in addition to Ia molecule synthesis and membrane IL-1 expression in BMM phi being essential for efficient accessory cell function to the T clone cells. The activation of BMM phi by GM-CSF was reversible and could be repeated. These data show that GM-CSF exerts a modulatory influence on preformed BMM phi, reversibly activating cells to Ia biosynthetic potential and pronounced accessory cell capacity, thus rendering the explanation unlikely that differentiation of precursor cells into a constitutively functional state had occurred.\r"

This would require CR1 to be clustered on the cell membrane, but no direct evidence for such clustering is available. We studied the distribution of CR1 on human E by immunofluorescence and shadow-casting immuno-electron microscopy techniques with the use of a monoclonal anti-CR1 antibody followed by FITC- or gold-conjugated second antibodies, respectively. By immunofluorescence, CR1 appeared as small dots (clusters) on fixed and unfixed E prepared either at 4 degrees C or at 37 degrees C. In the same donor, the number of clusters varied extensively from cell to cell (e.g., 1 to 43 clusters/E for a donor with 520 CR1/cell), but the mean number of clusters per cell correlated significantly with the mean number of CR1/cell. These images contrasted with those obtained for Rhesus D (RhD) Ag used as controls (RhD Ag are known to be evenly distributed): only a faint uniform fluorescence was seen despite the presence of 10,000 antigenic sites. As determined by immunocytochemical method, more than 65% of the total gold particles were organized in clusters (2 to 15 gold particles/cluster) whether cells were prefixed or not. Quantitative determinations suggested that each gold particle corresponded to one CR1. The fraction of gold particles grouped into clusters of three or more receptors, the mean size of the clusters, and the maximal size of clusters correlated with the mean number of CR1 per cell. By contrast, RhD Ag were distributed homogeneously (less than 2% gold particles in clusters). These data are the first to demonstrate the preclustered nature of CR1 on E. Such distribution could explain the high binding efficiency of C3b-coated IC to E despite the low number of CR1 per cell.\r"

  ".W": "C3, C4, factor B, properdin, and C2 binding to serum-sensitive and serum-resistant gonococci was quantitated in C8-deficient and normal human serum by using fluorescein-conjugated antibodies and 3H-labeled components. Organism and serum-specific differences were noted, the most striking of which involved factor B and properdin binding to the serum-sensitive strains in the different sera. C3 binding to these organisms was quantitatively and kinetically equivalent in C8-deficient and normal human serum. In contrast, factor B and properdin binding reached a plateau after 5 min in C8-deficient serum but peaked and fell to control values in normal human serum. Identical results were obtained with normal human serum immunochemically depleted of C8. Between 7 and 15% of the bound C3 participated in formation of the alternative pathway convertase C3bBb/P. Reconstitution of the C cascade by adding purified C8 to C8-deficient serum led to the loss of factor B previously bound to the organisms. Factor B loss occurred coincident with bacterial killing and membrane disruption as observed by electron microscopy. Prevention of membrane disruption by depleting normal human serum of lysozyme had no effect on killing and failed to prevent factor B loss. Stabilization of the C3bBb complex with Ni2+ prevented factor B loss as well as gross membrane disruption but not bacterial killing. C2 (the classical pathway analog of factor B) binding to gonococci was equivalent in C8-deficient and normal human serum peaking within 2.5 min and falling to control values in both sera thereafter. We conclude that the assembly of the membrane attack complex promotes decay of C3bBb/P with release of factor B and properdin but not C3 from the organism surface. Membrane disruption does not appear to be required for this effect. This activity may represent a mechanism to limit continued C consumption.\r"

By a novel flow cytofluorometric assay and by biochemical analysis, it has been shown that anti-isotype-specific antibodies induce mIgM and mIgD to associate with the cytoskeleton of B lymphocytes in an isotype-specific fashion. The detergent solubility of other prominent B lymphocyte surface proteins, such as class I and class II MHC proteins were unaffected by cross-linking of mIg. A panel of mu-specific mAb was analyzed for their ability to induce mIgM-cytoskeletal association. Although all mAb bound mIgM, only three out of seven rendered mIgM cytoskeletally associated. Further analysis revealed a strict correlation in the capacity of mu-specific mAb to induce capping and to induce the association of mIgM with the cytoskeleton.\r"

All three cytokines induced PAF synthesis in a novel biphasic pattern with peaks of PAF synthesis 1 to 2 and 6 to 8 h after stimulation of the monocytes. In contrast, calcium ionophore A23187 elicited a single peak of early PAF synthesis. PAF in the early peak was largely retained intracellularly whereas PAF in the late peak was largely released into culture fluids. Combinations of cytokines were subadditive or antagonistic in inducing PAF synthesis. Cycloheximide inhibited the late peak of PAF synthesis indicating that protein synthesis is required for synthesis of the phospholipid PAF. Specific antibodies to TNF or IL-1-beta inhibited the late peak of PAF synthesis induced by IFN-gamma indicating that late PAF synthesis is dependent on cytokine synthesis. The quantities of PAF produced by cytokine-activated monocytes are sufficient to activate human monocytes. Thus, these studies suggest that PAF may mediate in part monocyte activation by cytokines.\r"

Both granulocyte (G)-macrophage (M) CSF and IL-3 markedly enhanced histamine release upon stimulation with anti-IgE in a dose-dependent manner (maximal enhancement 25.5% by GM-CSF and 30.8% by IL-3 as expressed as percent increase against total cellular histamine content), whereas G-CSF, M-CSF, and IL-4 had no effect. Enhancing action of these factors was still observed in the highly enriched basophil population, suggesting that this action was not via contaminating cells. Enhancement of histamine release by both factors was not necessarily IgE mediated, because they also amplified histamine release upon stimulation with FMLP and ionophore A23187. The enhancement by both factors was temperature dependent, and took place rapidly and reached plateau levels in 15 min. GM-CSF and IL-3 achieved the similar plateau level of augmentation and no additive effects were observed between them. This finding suggests that they enhance histamine release by sharing the same pathway in the release reaction.\r"

Tab-elicited Ts cells can abrogate in vivo induction and in vitro and in vivo expression of antibacterial T cell activity. Tab-elicited Ts are Ag-specific and H-2 restricted in their suppressor activity. Non-immune T cells fail to elicit suppressor activity. These studies provide additional evidence that the protective T cell response to P. aeruginosa is controlled by a network of T cells that are probably recognizing idiotypic determinants on P. aeruginosa-immune T and B cells.\r"

We have cloned and sequenced the productive Vh representing five different cells from a monoclonal chronic lymphocytic leukemia. All five Vh sequences were identical. Therefore, the Vh region in this leukemia was not the subject of detectable somatic mutation.

  ".W": "The role that somatic mutations play in the phosphocholine-specific, antibody response to Streptococcus pneumoniae was examined by studying sets of hybridomas from different individual mice. As expected most of the cell lines were from the T15 anti-phosphocholine family and were not encoded by the v1 gene of the T15 VH family and V kappa 22. A minority of antibodies were from the M603 (v1/V kappa 8) and M511 (v1/V kappa 24) families. Three additional antibodies were encoded by the v11 gene of the T15 family; two were paired with a V lambda and the other with a V kappa 1 gene. In vitro binding studies showed that T15- and M603-like antibodies had the highest affinity for S. pneumoniae. Complete sequencing of the VH and VL mRNA from 25 of the hybridomas revealed somatic mutations in 11 of the antibodies. A total of 17 independently derived T15 positive cell lines were studied in detail, six of these were mutated. These mutations were scattered throughout the V regions and the replacement to silent ratio was typical of that for framework regions. Statistical evaluation of the placement of mutations showed that there was a slight but significantly decreased frequency of mutations in complementarity determining regions. Comparisons of mutated and unmutated T15-related antibodies showed that mutations caused a decrease in binding to S. pneumoniae in every case. These results argue that the optimal specificity for this molecular form of phosphocholine is encoded in the germline and that Ag-driven events favor selection of B cells expressing these germ-line encoded antibodies.\r"

The chimeric constructs were sequentially electroporated into murine non-Ig-producing myeloma (P3.653) and hybridoma (SP2/0) cell. Significant differences were seen in expression levels between the two cell types. High levels of expression (24 to 32 micrograms/ml/10(6) cells) were seen with several of the anti-CEA SP2/0 transfectomas but not with the P3.653 cells. The SP2/0 transfectoma lines were adapted to serum-free, chemically defined media and grown in large scale fermentation cultures where they continued to secrete high levels of antibody. The chimeric antibodies remain reactive against human CEA with affinity constants comparable to that of the parental hybridoma antibody. High level expression will make practical the production of chimeric antibodies for in vivo therapeutic and diagnostic purposes.\r"

In an effort to protect autologous monocytes from lysis, we treated monolayer cultures of adherent PBMC with various doses of human rIFN-gamma and assessed their susceptibility to LAK cells. IFN-gamma was shown to lessen the sensitivity of monocytes to lysis in a dose-dependent manner. Similar treatment of FMEX, an NK-resistant melanoma tumor cell line, with IFN-gamma did not affect its susceptibility to LAK lysis. Kinetic studies demonstrated that as little as 2 h incubation with IFN-gamma was sufficient for the protective effects to take effect. Additionally, monocytes that were pulsed with IFN-gamma for 2 h, washed, and then cultured in medium alone retained their resistance to lysis for at least 3 days. Cold target inhibition studies showed that IFN-treated and untreated monocytes could effectively compete with each other for binding sites on LAK cells. Furthermore, binding studies demonstrated that there was no significant difference between the number of conjugates formed by using either IFN-treated or untreated monocytes. This indicates that resistance to lysis induced by IFN treatment affects a post-binding event and not an initial recognition signal. From these studies, it was apparent that treatment of monocytes with IFN-gamma lessened their sensitivity to LAK-mediated lysis. Thus, it may be possible through a specific sequence of IFN-gamma and IL-2 treatment that LAK activity could be manipulated against some tumor cells, but not normal cells, to abrogate some of the toxicity seen with this type of cancer therapy.\r"

  ".W": "In this study, we first established several CTL clones of (BALB/c x C57BL/6)F1 origin that were specific for either syngeneic UV female 1 or UV male 1 fibrosarcoma cell lines. All the CTL clones had Thy-1+ Lyt-2+ L3T4- phenotypes and showed Kd restriction when lysing the corresponding target cells. Sera obtained from syngeneic animals immunized with three CTL clones, 10B-5 for UV female 1, and CTL9 and CTL10 for UV male 1, showed specific inhibition of target cell lysis with the corresponding CTL clones. The inhibitory activities were found in sera of the majority of immunized animals. Because the inhibitory activity resides in protein A-binding fraction, mAb were produced by hybridizing spleen cells of hyperimmune animals. N1-56 was thus obtained from a mouse immunized with 10B-5 CTL clone reactive with UV female 1. N1-56 was clonotype specific, reacting with 10B-5 but not with other CTL lines or leukemia cell lines. No N1-56+ cells were detectable in thymocytes, lymph node cells, or spleen cells of either naive or UV female 1-immune CB6F1 mice. Immunoprecipitation showed that N1-56 reacts with 90,000 Mr molecules on 10B-5 CTL clone under nonreducing conditions and 45,000 Mr molecules under reducing conditions, indicating its reactivities with idiotypic determinants of TCR on the CTL clone. N1-56 inhibited lytic activity of 10B-5, but neither N1-56 nor alpha-10B-5 hyperimmune serum inhibited that of alpha-UV female 1 mixed lymphocyte tumor cell culture cells. N1-56 induced proliferation of 10B-5 without addition of Ag.\r"

No aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes were observed, and outer membrane compositional analyses of the resistant variants revealed porin protein and lipopolysaccharide profiles similar to those of the aminoglycoside-susceptible parental strain (PA-96). PA-96 accumulated [3H]tobramycin in a normal triphasic manner, whereas the aminoglycoside-resistant variants were unable to take up measurable quantities of [3H]tobramycin even when long incubation times (120 min) and high external aminoglycoside concentrations (27 micrograms/mL) were used. We duplicated this uptake defect for [3H]tobramycin by pretreating parental cells with KCn, which is an energy-dependent transport inhibitor. Electrical potentials of cytoplasmic membranes of the aminoglycoside-resistant variants were significantly lower than that of the parental strain (P less than .01). A ribosomally resistant mutant of the parental strain (PA-96r) showed monophasic, energy-dependent uptake of [3H]tobramycin, without the accelerated, secondary aminoglycoside uptake phase.\r"

  ".W": "Nonopsonized Candida hyphae elicit from human neutrophils a transient rise in cytosolic calcium concentrations and an oxidative burst without a detectable change in membrane potential. To determine if the signal-transduction pathway used by these organisms is mediated by guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (GNPs), we examined the functional responsiveness of neutrophils pretreated with pertussis toxin (PT). In response to serum-opsonized hyphae or zymosan, the rise in cytosolic calcium, membrane depolarization, and the respiratory burst were only partially abrogated. The transient rise in calcium induced by unopsonized hyphae was, however, completely eliminated in PT-treated neutrophils. Despite total abrogation of the calcium response, PT-treated cells could still mount a respiratory burst in response to these nonopsonized hyphae. Thus, neutrophil signaling by both serum-opsonized particles and nonopsonized hyphae is only partially mediated by PT-sensitive GNPs. Furthermore, the ability of unopsonized hyphae to elicit a respiratory burst without a calcium response suggests these events are separable and confirms the versatility of these organisms as probes for investigating neutrophil activation.\r"

Mean +/- SE serum E2 levels were higher on the day of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) administration in the miscarriage group (689.4 +/- 27.5 pg/ml) than in the nonpregnant group (527.7 +/- 25.8 pg/ml) (P = 0.018) and highest in the ongoing pregnancy group (734.6 +/- 66.5 pg/ml) (P = 0.003).

The mean diameter of the two largest follicles at the time of hCG administration was significantly greater (14.7 mm) in the group with two or more preovs retrieved than in the group with zero or one preov (13.3 mm) (P = 0.001). The relative probability of achieving a pregnancy was best predicted by the presence of two follicles greater than or equal to 16 mm in diameter on transvaginal ultrasound examination and was 1.63 times greater than that of all patients in this series.\r"

In a phase II trial in carcinoma of the pancreas, we treated 31 patients who had not received prior chemotherapy with a median ifosfamide dose of 2 g/m2/d (range, 1.5 to 2 g/m2/d) administered intravenously (IV) over one hour for five consecutive days every 3 weeks. 2-mercaptoethane sulphonate (mesna), an acrolein antagonist with known uroendothelial protective properties, was administered IV at a dose of 400 mg/m2 over 15 minutes before the daily dose of ifosfamide and repeated every four hours for two additional doses. Among 30 evaluable patients, one patient achieved a complete remission (26+ months) and another patient had a partial remission (4 months). The median duration of survival of all patients from the start of ifosfamide therapy was only 3 months (range, 1 to 26+ months). Treatments were generally well tolerated. The most common toxic effects included granulocytopenia, nausea and vomiting, malaise, anorexia, and mild hematuria. Mesna offers an adequate protection against uroendothelial injury caused by ifosfamide. Despite the previously reported response rate of greater than 20% at the same or lower doses of ifosfamide in other studies, our data suggest that ifosfamide is only marginally active against cancer of the pancreas and appears to be of minimal value in the treatment of patients with this tumor.\r"

Twenty-four monkeys were randomly assigned to one of two groups of 12. Each group underwent baseline cerebral angiography and coagulation analysis followed by right-sided craniectomy and experimental subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). An Ommaya reservoir was inserted with its catheter placed into the subarachnoid space. Twenty-four hours later one group (the tPA group) received 0.5 mg of tPA in 0.5 ml of buffer injected into the reservoir every 8 hours for three doses, while the second group (the placebo group) received the same volume of normal saline. On Day 7, angiography was repeated and the animals were sacrificed. One animal from the placebo group developed a delayed ischemic neurological deficit on Day 5 after SAH. Moderate to severe vasospasm (greater than 30% reduction in vessel caliber) was present on Day 7 in the internal carotid and middle cerebral arteries of the animals in the placebo group (p less than 0.01), while in the tPA group only mild narrowing of the anterior cerebral artery was seen. No significant change in coagulation status occurred in either group. All animals in the placebo group had a large amount of subarachnoid clot remaining at the time of sacrifice, but 11 of the 12 animals in the tPA group were completely free of clot. The results of electron microscopic studies of the cerebral arteries correlated with angiography, and there was no histological evidence of brain inflammation associated with the intrathecal use of tPA.\r"

Previous research has shown that [99mTc]phosphate compounds have high alveolar deposition and slow clearance and thus provide suitable aerosols for pulmonary ventilation studies. We have compared the pulmonary retention and blood levels of [99mTc]pyrophosphate (PYP) and [99mTc]DTPA in eight normal nonsmoking male volunteers. These two radioaerosols have comparable pulmonary deposition. Technetium-99m PYP, however, has a much slower pulmonary clearance which allows sufficient time (20 or more minutes) for SPECT data acquisition using a single-headed rotating gamma camera. While the radiation absorbed dose to the lungs for [99mTc]PYP (0.31 rad/mCi) is greater than for [99mTc]DTPA (0.11 rad/mCi), it is at a clinically acceptable and safe level.\r"

  ".W": "Ten monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) have been evaluated as agents for selective radiolabeling of human neutrophils (PMNs). Four bifunctional chelating agents (BFCA) have been compared in order to determine the one that gives the best labeling of MAbs with radionuclides. Of these, the cyclic anhydride of diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA) has been chosen for routine use since it incorporated 111In efficiently, and only minimally altered the immunoreactivity of the MAb. Two [111In]DTPA MAbs (1 microgram or less, anti-SSEA-1 and B.37.2.1) incorporated 80 +/- 5% and 72 +/- 6% of the added radioactivity with 10(7) separated PMNs in 0.5 ml plasma. In whole blood these values were 27 +/- 5% and 38 +/- 9%, respectively. Using the other three BFCAs with anti-SSEA-1, the corresponding values of 70%-80% and 3%-5%, respectively were obtained. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoretic examinations of the radioactivity that did not bind to blood cells revealed that when DTPA was used as the BFCA, 21% of the radioactivity was associated with a plasma protein of mol wt 60-80 kD and 57% remained bound to the MAb (mol wt 900 kD). When the other three BFCAs were employed, these values were greater than 42% and less than 19%, respectively. When up to 4% of the PMN surface antigens were MAb bound, the PMNs physiologic function remained unaltered. For two MAbs, anti-SSEA-1, and B 37.2.1, the PMN specificity was found to be 1.6 X 10(-11) M and 2 X 10(-11) M, respectively, and the number of cell surface antigens was estimated to be 5.1 X 10(5) and 7.8 X 10(5), respectively. For 99mTc labeling of MAbs, the use of four different reducing agents were examined. One agent, sodium-dithionite (Na2S2O4), at a concentration of 0.2 mg/ml reaction mixture and with a molar ratio 3 X 10(3):1 to the MAb, gave us results that were comparable to those obtained with [111In]MAb. We conclude that at least two of the ten MAbs, anti-SSEA-1 and B.37.2.1 are worthy of evaluation in humans.\r"

The resolution applicable to in vivo imaging is six mm or more, depending on radionuclide and reconstruction filter and is very uniform over the field of view normally used. Axial resolution can be varied by moving side collimation (maximum approximately 16 mm FWHM with interplane septa). A simple scheme has been devised to correct for loss of true coincidence events with varying count rate based on the total random and multiple coincidence rates. It is concluded that correction for scattered radiation should be implemented for reliable quantitation.\r"

However, the mammalian renal medulla has a hypertonic environment that changes with the state of hydration of the animal. In order to determine if the change in renal osmolality produces a change in the response of the inner medulla to hormones and neurotransmitters, we determined the effects of osmolality on carbachol-stimulated hydrolysis of PIs in the inner medullary slices of the rabbit kidney. The hydrolysis was determined by incorporation of [3H]inositol into PIs and the release of [3H]inositol phosphates in the presence and absence of 1 mM carbachol. The osmolality of the incubation media was increased from 300 to 1200 mOsm/kg of H2O in increments of 300 mOsm/kg of H2O by addition of either urea, NaCl, mannitol or an equiosmolar mixture of urea and NaCl. Increasing the osmolality of the incubation media by any one of these solutes decreased carbachol-stimulated release of inositol phosphates in the inner medullary slices of the rabbit kidney. Our results suggest that the effect of carbachol on PI messenger system in the renal medulla in vivo will depend on the tissue osmolality that itself depends on the state of hydration of the animal.\r"

  ".W": "Atrial natriuretic peptide II (ANP II) raises cyclic GMP and relaxes vascular smooth muscle in vitro. The manner in which ANP II relaxes vascular smooth muscle is unknown but may involve alterations in the concentration of free intracellular Ca++. To examine this possibility, changes in intracellular Ca++ were monitored in rat aortic strips using the Ca++-dependent conversion of phosphorylase b to a, while Ca++ levels and phosphorylase were measured in cultured rat aortic smooth muscle cells. ANP II produced time- and concentration-dependent decreases in phosphorylase a and tension in norepinephrine-contracted aortic strips. The decrease in the formation of phosphorylase a was accompanied by an increase in cyclic GMP content. ANP II also decreased phosphorylase a formation in K+-depolarized tissues but to a lesser extent. Agonists such as angiotensin II and arginine vasopressin, and depolarizing concentrations of K+ elevated Ca++ levels in cultured aortic cells. ANP II inhibited Ca++ accumulation to either agonists or K+, but was more effective against agonists. Phosphorylase a formation which was increased by agonists and K+ in cultured cells was also inhibited by ANP II. We conclude that phosphorylase a formation can be a useful indicator of intracellular Ca++ concentrations in smooth muscle preparations and that ANP II regulates Ca++ levels in agonist and depolarized smooth muscle, suggesting that ANP II affects mainly Ca++ removal from the cytoplasm.\r"

  ".U": "89036757\r", 
  ".W": "In Charles River CFW mice, 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) caused lethality with an LD50 of 53.8 mg/kg s.c. In mice pretreated with deprenyl, no lethality occurred with MPTP doses up to 110 mg/kg s.c. MPTP alone at doses of 30 to 90 mg/kg s.c. caused marked salivation, licking and grooming, hyperlocomotion, hyperreactivity and convulsions during the 1st hr, followed by depression, continued salivation and respiratory distress at 2 to 3 hr and at longer times, with death occurring at the higher doses. In deprenyl-pretreated mice, MPTP produced only mild and transient effects. 1-Methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+) was more potent in causing lethality than was MPTP, and deprenyl did not affect its lethality. MPTP lethality was not antagonized by EXP 561 [4-phenyl-bicyclo-(2,2,2)octan-1-amine hydrochloride monohydrate], an uptake inhibitor that prevented the neurotoxic effects of a lower dose of MPTP on striatal dopamine and cortical norepinephrine neurons. In addition to deprenyl, other monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors effective in inhibiting MAO-B (MD 240928 (R-3-[4-((3-chlorophenyl)methoxy)phenyl]-5-[(methylamino)methyl]-2- oxazolidinone methanesulfonate) and pargyline) protected against MPTP-induced lethality, but LY 51641 (N-[2-(o-chlorophenoxy)ethyl]cyclopropylamine hydrochloride) (a selective inhibitor of MAO-A) did not. The protective effect of deprenyl against MPTP-induced lethality was dose-dependent over a dose range of 0.01 to 10 mg/kg; in this range deprenyl inhibited MAO type B (MAO-B) in brain and liver. A 10-mg/kg i.p. dose of deprenyl antagonized MPTP-induced lethality as long as 14 days.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "89036759\r", 
  ".W": "We studied the effect of 4-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) on endothelium-dependent relaxation of rabbit isolated lobar pulmonary arteries contracted with phenylephrine. After full development of relaxation in response to 1.0 microM acetylcholine, addition of 10.0 nM PMA reversed relaxation rapidly and completely. This effect of PMA on acetylcholine-induced relaxation was unchanged when catalase was included in the medium. In separate groups of experiments, lobar pulmonary arteries were preincubated with 10.0 nM PMA for 20 min and then challenged with acetylcholine without washout of PMA. In these experiments PMA did not block completely the relaxation in response to addition of 1.0 microM acetylcholine. Log-concentration response curves for 0.01 to 31.6 microM acetylcholine vs. relaxation as percentage of phenylephrine-induced tone exhibited rightward shifts and depression of maxima after pretreatment with PMA. The EC50 for acetylcholine-induced relaxation was increased from 57 +/- 9.0 to 377 +/- 6.30 nM (values are mean +/- S.E.). Relaxation of lobar pulmonary arteries induced by 10.0 nM A23187 was much less sensitive to treatment with PMA than relaxation induced by acetylcholine. At least for the low concentration of PMA used here, these data are consistent with the following: 1) PMA blocks acetylcholine-induced relaxation by disrupting the link between acetylcholine receptor occupancy and the formation or release of the endothelium-derived relaxing factor, 2) PMA does not directly block the relaxant action of endothelium-derived relaxing factor on vascular smooth muscle and 3) the effect of PMA on acetylcholine-induced relaxation is not mediated by hydrogen peroxide or derived oxygen radicals.\r"

  ".W": "Risperidone was compared to the 5-hydroxytryptamine2 antagonist ritanserin and to the dopamine-D2 antagonist haloperidol. The in vitro receptor binding (neurotransmitter-, peptide- and ion channel binding sites) and neurotransmitter uptake profile were investigated. Risperidone revealed, like ritanserin, a very high binding affinity for 5-hydroxytryptamine2 receptors (Ki = 0.16 and 0.30 nM, respectively) and a slow dissociation (half-time, 31 and 160 min). In accordance, risperidone (IC50 = 0.5 nM) and ritanserin (IC50 = 1.8 nM) potently blocked serotonin-induced 32P-phosphatidic acid formation in human blood platelets. Risperidone showed, like haloperidol, high binding affinity for dopamine-D2 receptors (Ki = 3.13 and 1.55 nM, respectively) and rapid dissociation (half-time, 2.7 and 5.8 min). Risperidone displayed higher binding affinity than ritanserin and haloperidol for alpha-1 adrenergic (Ki = 0.8 nM), histamine-H1 (Ki = 2.23 nM) and alpha-2 adrenergic receptors (Ki = 7.54 nM). In in vitro superfusion experiments, risperidone and haloperidol reversed at nanomolar concentrations the inhibition by LY 171555 (a dopamine-D2 agonist) and by amphetamine of potassium and electrically evoked release of [3H]acetylcholine from striatal slices (postsynaptic dopamine-D2 effects). Both drugs reversed with similar potency the inhibition by LY 171555 of electrically evoked release of [3H]dopamine (a presynaptic dopamine-D2 effect). Risperidone did not affect the activation by amphetamine of [3H]dopamine efflux from rat striatal slices. Risperidone enhanced at nanomolar concentrations the stimulated [3H]norepinephrine efflux from cortical slices and it similarly reversed the inhibition by clonidine, at concentrations corresponding to its binding affinity for alpha-2 adrenergic receptors. The in vitro biochemical properties of risperidone are in agreement with the reported in vivo pharmacological profile, the relation to clinical findings is discussed.\r"

  ".W": "In most isolated canine basilar arteries tested, Ca++ ionophore A-23187 induced a small relaxation followed by a transient contraction. Both contraction and relaxation were abolished by removal of endothelium. The endothelium-dependent contraction induced by A-23187 was attenuated by a phospholipase A2 inhibitor (quinacrine), cyclooxygenase inhibitors (aspirin and indomethacin), a thromboxane A2 (TXA2) synthetase inhibitor (OKY-046) and a TXA2 antagonist (ONO-3708). The A-23187-induced contraction was abolished by lowering the Ca++ concentration of medium to 10%, whereas the contraction induced by 9,11-epithio-11,12-methano-TXA2 (STA2) was attenuated slightly by lowering [Ca++]. The A-23187-induced contraction was reduced markedly by nifedipine (10(-9) to 10(-7) M), but the STA2-induced contraction was only attenuated slightly by nifedipine. Bay K 8644 did not affect the A-23187- and STA2-induced contractions. The present experiments demonstrate that A-23187 induced an endothelium-dependent contraction in canine basilar artery, and suggest that Ca++ might play a key role in production of an endothelium-derived contracting factor (probably TXA2).\r"

Eighty-two such patients were reviewed during a 30-month period at a Level I trauma center. Forty-one patients (50%) developed at least one infectious complication. The most common source was respiratory, occurring in 34 patients relatively early (average, 3.2 days) in their hospital course. The severity of head injury and presence of coexisting thoracic trauma correlated statistically; administration of prophylactic antibiotics and corticosteroids did not in the development of infectious problems. Only three patients died as a result of sepsis, indicating that early recognition and prompt treatment may control the severity of infectious complications.\r"

The injury was induced by air infusion into an isolated segment of the artery; the pharmacologic agents were administered by continuous intravenous infusion. After 2 weeks the animals were killed and the arteries examined. The control animals developed a marked intimal thickening. A dose-dependent decreases in the intima to media area (I-M) ratio was seen after SH, with approximately 50% and 90% inhibition of intimal thickening at doses of 5 and 50 USP U/kg/hr, respectively. At these effective doses, the effect of SH was associated with reendothelialization of the injured area. The effects of LMWH and Org 10172 were similar to that of SH at doses of 50 anti-Xa U/kg/hr, but these agents had only about 40% inhibition at doses of 15 anti-Xa U/kg/hr. The activated partial thromboplastin times were slightly prolonged in the animals treated with 50 USP/anti-Xa U/kg/hr of SH, LMWH, and Org 10172, whereas significant anti-Xa levels were observed at doses higher than 15 USP/anti-Xa U/kg/hr. It is concluded that SH, LMWH, and Org 10172 have significant inhibitory effects of intimal thickening after injury even at nonanticoagulant levels, with SH being the most potent.\r"

Marked increase in hydration of the sural nerve was seen in more than half of the symptomatic diabetic patients. Two of 11 neurologically asymptomatic diabetics had increased nerve hydration, suggesting a presymptomatic alteration of the nerve. Symptomatic diabetics treated with aldose-reductase inhibitors had normal nerve water levels. Increased level of peripheral nerve water represents a new finding in diabetes mellitus.

Factors that limit access for some elderly patients include negative attitudes of some health professionals about whether elderly people can benefit from tube feeding and TPN, lack of adequate nutritional standards for the elderly and lack of staff in some treatment settings who are trained and have enough time to assess nutritional status in elderly patients, and payment problems. Public controversy about life-sustaining technologies for elderly people now focuses on decisions about withholding or withdrawal of tube feeding, but debate about the legal and ethical issues involved in these decisions tends to obscure the relevant clinical considerations. Research issues and clinical practice concerns related to decision making and quality of care for elderly patients on tube feeding and TPN are discussed.\r"

In each patient group the effect of either glucose infusion (approximately 4 mg/kg.min) or lipid infusion (20% Intralipid lipid emulsion infused to provide calories approximately isocaloric to the glucose infusion) was assessed. The infusion of calories as either glucose or lipid was equally effective as a means of suppressing NPC in each individual patient group, and the degree of response was governed by the clinical disease state. In the LGI and ST patients the infusion of either glucose or fat resulted in a significant suppression of NPC (p less than 0.005) of approximately 15%. However, the ongoing rate of NPC that occurred despite substrate infusion was more than twice as great in the ST patients as in the LGI patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Host weight was significantly reduced by PF and RI. Tumor growth was reduced in malnourished rats with the PF regimen resulting in the greatest decrease. Rats receiving TPN after 14 days of the RI or PF regimens had higher host weight and plasma albumin levels than malnourished rats. Tumor growth during TPN was evaluated as the percent increase and compared with that of the respective malnourished rats. The percent increase for RI-TPN rats was significantly greater although a trend toward an increase was also evident for PF-TPN rats. Tumor ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) activity and putrescine levels were increased for PF rats and decreased for RI rats while tumor ODC activity was consistently increased by TPN. Tumor growth, ODC activity, and putrescine levels were simultaneously increased only for those rats fed the RI regimen prior to TPN. These results show a disparity in tumor ODC activity, putrescine levels, and tumor growth in malnourished rats. The results of this study suggest that the nutritional origin of cachexia influences the response of the tumor to TPN and emphasizes the importance of considering the methods to induce malnutrition in designing therapuetic regimens.\r"

The grade of PSE was assessed clinically and by the number connection test, BCAA concentrations were significantly lower during the glucose infusion than during fasting or the lipid infusion. PSE was significantly less with the lipid than with the glucose infusion. Trials testing the effect of infused BCAA must take account of the opposing effect on BCAA concentrations of simultaneous glucose infusion.

We placed TLC in 126 patients needing total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and multiple venous access, prospectively randomizing them to two groups: group I received a guidewire change every 3 days, and group II received guidewire changes for mechanical or septic complications only. Tips were cultured at each line change and tips and blood for each septic episode. Catheter sepsis was defined by the criteria of the Association for Practitioners in Infection Control (APIC). There were 67 positive cultures in 52 patients, but most produced very few colonies or grew the same organisms in other infection sites. Forty-seven% of all cultures grew Staphylococci, and 23% grew Candida. APIC-defined catheter sepsis was detected in 12.7% of group I and 15.9% of group II. Although we observed no statistically significant difference in the two techniques, if we assume that a 20% difference in the incidence of catheter-induced sepsis would be important to detect, the probability of failing to detect such a difference is 0.24 with an 0.05 level of significance (two-sided). Prophylactic guidewire changes did not alter the incidence of catheter sepsis in patients with TLC who required TPN. The high rate of sepsis and Candida infection may be due to the critical illness of the immunocompromised population studied.\r"

This placebo-controlled clinical trial assessed the effect of adding fiber in the form of 'Fybogel' (Ispaghula husk), one sachet twice daily, on the occurrence of diarrhea during enteral feeding. Sixty-eight patients without prospectively defined exclusion criteria were enterally fed with 'Osmolite' in the Intensive Care Unit during the study period, 35 receiving 'Fybogel', and 33 placebo. Nineteen patients in each group had diarrhea on at least 1 day during enteral feeding, with 66 (23%) feeding days complicated by diarrhea in the 'Fybogel' group, and 68 (23%) in the placebo group. Narcotic infusions, thiopentone infusions, 'Mylanta', H2-antagonists, and nystatin suspension did not significantly affect the incidence of diarrhea. Weak correlations were found between diarrhea and the number of antibiotics each patient received (r = 0.2, p less than 0.05) and also the number of positive nonenteral bacterial cultures (r = 0.2, p less than 0.05). The addition of fiber in the form of 'Fybogel' to enteral feeds did not affect the occurrence of diarrhea.\r"

Positioning of enteral feeding tubes distal to the pylorus has been advocated as a method of reducing such complications. Various techniques have been suggested to achieve postpyloric siting. Reports have indicated that lengthening the tube or altering the distal end tip configuration, by varying the tip profile or by the addition of a weight, may facilitate spontaneous transpyloric passage of the tube. This prospective controlled clinical study using three new polyurethane tubes demonstrates that the frequency of spontaneous transpyloric passage of the tube is not affected by tip profile or by the addition of a weight. Indeed, with all three tube designs only about one-third had passed spontaneously through the pylorus at 24 hr. Once through the pylorus the unweighted tube stayed in position significantly longer than the weighted tubes (p less than 0.005). We suggest that in those patients requiring post-pyloric feeding, endoscopic or fluoroscopic techniques should be used to position the tubes at the time of insertion, and that an unweighted tube should be used to prolong tube usage.\r"

Patients were arbitrarily placed into three outcome groups: group I consisted of seven patients who received postoperative nutrition support; group II included 38 patients who received no nutrition support and did not develop complications; Group III consisted of 35 patients who received no nutrition support but developed postoperative complications. All group I patients were length of stay (LOS) outliers. Group I patients were significantly older than groups II and III (p less than 0.0003) and had a significantly longer average length of stay (ALOS) (p less than 0.001), ALOS in SICU (p less than 0.0001) and greater incidence of both septic complications (p less than 0.02) and mortality (p less than 0.02). Nutrition support in cardiac surgery patients warrants special DRG consideration in light of the significantly increased hospitalization and resource utilization as compared with all other patients in cardiac surgery.\r"

Riboflavin and folacin were not affected by the experimental conditions. The presence of Intralipid resulted in higher levels of vitamin E due to Intralipid's inherent vitamin E content; no other experimental conditions affected vitamin E. Thiamin levels decreased in admixtures containing the amino acid solution C and stored at 25 degrees C. Vitamin A levels were lower in admixtures stored in plastic but were maintained in admixtures containing Intralipid and stored in glass bottles at either temperature. Vitamin C levels were maintained in admixtures stored at 5 degrees C for all experimental conditions. The greatest vitamin C losses occurred in admixtures containing amino acid solutions C or D stored in plastic bags, or containing D stored in glass bottles at 25 degrees C.\r"

Their serum retinol levels were normal, but only 61% of their controls despite receiving two to three times the recommended daily allowance (RDA) in retinol equivalents. Commercial enteral formulas were found to contain only negligible quantities of the carotenoids and were the cause of the hypocarotenemia. To assess the ability of these patients to absorb beta-carotene, nine tube-fed patients were given 15 mg of beta-carotene (2.5 times the RDA) in a single dose. Serum concentration time curves showed that only four patients absorbed significant quantities of the beta-carotene and absorption was delayed compared to previously studied subjects taking enteral formulas as meals. These studies suggest that the efficiency of absorption of the fat soluble vitamins may be lower in tube-fed patients and that patients receiving long-term tube feeding are denied the possible protective effects of the carotenoids normally contained in the American diet.\r"

  ".U": "89037618\r", 
  ".W": "In order to investigate the role of enteral nutrients in intestinal maturation, an animal model was developed consisting of provision of intravenous nutrient infusions to immature suckling rats over the period of weaning. Age- and litter-matched controls were provided identical amounts of the parenteral solution by entered cannula using the same model. At the end of the period of weaning, animals were killed and the intestines removed for measurement of morphologic parameters and disaccharidase, DNA, and protein levels. The absence of enteral nutrients during weaning resulted in striking inhibition of intestinal growth, diminution in mucosal cell mass, and delayed development of lactase. Although the appearance of sucrase was not affected by the lack of enteral nutrients, sucrase levels rose to only one-third of control levels. Jejunoileal gradients were not present in animals deprived of enteral nutrients but were present in animals receiving enteral nutrients. These results are distinct from adult animals treated in identical experimental fashion and indicate that major parameters of intestinal maturation are altered by the absence of intraluminal nutrients. A critical role for intraluminal nutrients in regulation of intestinal development is therefore suggested. The animal model developed for these studies is well suited for investigation of the interactions of the intraluminal environment with intestinal maturation.\r"

These amino acid solutions prepared are characterized by the high concentration of branched-chain amino acids up to 40%, increased arginine and decreased glycine, phenylalanine and methionine as compared with commercially available solutions. In the PF group, each amino acid was kept within the range of standard value. Correlation between plasma amino acid profiles and the dose of each amino acid administered was obtained, from which minimum, standard, and maximum doses for each amino acid was determined. Based on these values, we proposed new formula for neonates which elicits no abnormal plasma amino acid pattern even when amino acids are administered at the dosage level of 1.5-2.5 g/kg/day.\r"

Basal and pentagastrin-stimulated pepsin (BPO, MPO) and acid (BAO, MAO) secretions were measured in three groups of infants: controls (14 infants fed normally), TPN groups (seven infants on TPN), CREN groups (14 infants on CREN). The MAO and MPO of the TPN group were significantly lower than controls (p less than 0.02), and the ratio of pentagastrin-stimulated PO/AO did not change, suggesting a large decrease of acid gastric function in the TPN group. BPO was not different from controls and BAO was significantly higher because of amino acids perfusion. The data for CREN group were not different from those of the control group, despite the fact that 11 infants were on TPN before CREN. These results demonstrate that TPN causes decreases in both acid and pepsin secretions in human infants. When TPN children are placed on CREN, these secretions return to normal.\r"

  ".W": "An explosion of research over the last seven years has led to the discovery and characterization of a peptide, originating in the heart's atria, that possesses impressive vasorelaxant and natriuretic properties. Although the several atrial peptides that have been isolated by researchers working in different laboratories vary in length, all contain the same core sequence. Cardionatrin I, a 28-amino acid peptide, is the likely active circulating hormone. In the atrial peptide's action on vascular smooth muscle, it appears especially to counter the effects of angiotensin II. The peptide's effects on renal hemodynamics and sodium excretion include a marked increase in glomerular filtration rate. Atrial hormone also induces impressive natriuresis in experimental animals, for which an increase in glomerular filtration rate may be a necessary component. Atrial hormone has been found to reduce arterial blood pressure in both animals and humans. In experimental animals, the peptide appears to lower blood pressure by different mechanisms in high- and low-renin forms of hypertension, and to lower pressure to a greater degree and with lower doses in the former as compared with the latter. In patients with essential hypertension, primary aldosteronism, congestive heart failure, renal failure, and perhaps ascitic cirrhosis, plasma ANH levels tend to be higher than they are in normotensive individuals. Atrial hormone causes marked and sustained suppression of renal renin secretion and, thus, of plasma renin levels. In addition, atrial hormone blocks aldosterone secretion and opposes the vasoconstrictive effects of angiotensin II and the sodium-retaining action of aldosterone.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Lymphoepithelioma was the most common histologic subtype. Advanced disease in stages III and IV was seen in 22.66% and 72% of the patients, respectively. Complete remission was obtained in 80 of 120 patients (66.66%) with radiation alone and in 19 of 30 patients (63.3%) who received preradiation chemotherapy and radiation. Age, sex, and histology did not influence the rate of complete remission. The N0-1 nodal status group had a significantly better response of 81% and 36% survival, as compared with the N2-3 group with a 55% response and 20% survival. Only 30 of those who received radiation alone and 10 of those who received preradiation chemotherapy are disease-free for a median period of 24 months. Twenty-six relapses have occurred within a median period of 12 months. The 5-year actuarial disease-free survival is 13%. This indicates the need for an early diagnosis and combined aggressive treatment to improve survival.\r"

  ".W": "An experimental study with six beagle dogs was conducted to evaluate a new monofilamentous absorbable suturing material--polydioxanone. Free internal mammary artery grafts, 3 cm long, were harvested via a median sternotomy and were implanted as arterial bypasses in femoral arteries (12 end-to-end anastomoses) and as arteriovenous shunts in the carotid artery-contralateral jugular vein position (12 end-to-side anastomoses). Twenty-four anastomoses were made with monofilamentous nonabsorbable suturing material, polypropylene (12 arterial, 12 shunts), to serve as control grafts. At 6 months the grafts and anastomoses were explanted and studied with light and scanning electron microscopes. Macroscopically, the polydioxanone sutures had disappeared. The major histologic finding was the foreign body reaction around the polypropylene sutures. In the electron microscopic study the endothelial line covered the anastomotic site and in the polypropylene anastomoses the suture material was bulging up from the anastomoses. No aneurysms or dilatations were seen. According to this study, polydioxanone is a suitable suturing material for small luminal arterial anastomoses and is superior to polypropylene suturing material because it causes no tissue or other late changes on the flow surfaces.\r"

  ".W": "We investigated the hypothesis that ouabain would reduce energy expenditure in the hypothermic, ischemic heart by inhibiting membrane-bound sodium/potassium-activated adenosine triphosphatase and lead to improved function on reperfusion. Additionally, we compared ouabain with another potential adjunct, the calcium channel blocker verapamil. The isolated rabbit heart was used as a model, and three experimental groups were studied after 1, 6, 12, and 24 hours of 4 degrees C ischemia. Hearts in group I were stored in a standard high potassium solution; hearts in groups II and III were stored in the same solution supplemented with verapamil (2 mg/L) and ouabain (3 mg/L), respectively. After ischemia, all hearts were reperfused for 45 minutes on a modified Langendorff apparatus, and left ventricular function was measured before freeze-clamping the heart for metabolite determination. At 1 and 6 hours, hearts in all groups functioned well, but the group III hearts had higher levels of adenosine triphosphate, phosphocreatine, total adenine nucleotides, and glycogen. After 12 hours of ischemia, function was significantly better in group III hearts (p less than 0.01) compared with that of hearts in groups I and II. Group III hearts also exhibited higher levels of high energy phosphates and glycogen. After 24 hours of storage, all hearts functioned poorly, and there was a marked decline in measured metabolites. Although we could show no improvement with the addition of verapamil, ventricular function was improved after storage in a high potassium hypothermic solution containing ouabain. Because ouabain inhibits the hydrolysis of adenosine triphosphate by sodium/potassium-activated adenosine triphosphatase, this result suggests that the glycoside maintains energy-rich phosphates necessary for optimal resumption of cardiac function.\r"

  ".W": "Neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia results from the formation of a maternal antibody to a paternal antigen on fetal platelets. Intracranial hemorrhage, which may be antenatal, occurs in approximately 15 to 20 percent of infants with this form of thrombocytopenia. In families with an affected infant, 75 percent of subsequent infants are affected. We report the results of antenatal treatment with intravenous gamma globulin, with or without dexamethasone, in seven pregnant women who had previously had infants who had severe alloimmune thrombocytopenia. The platelet count increased by a mean (+/- SD) of 72.5 +/- 62 x 10(9) per liter in the six fetuses in whom periumbilical blood sampling was performed. All seven treated fetuses had platelet counts above 30 x 10(9) at birth, and none had an intracranial hemorrhage, in contrast to all seven of their respective untreated siblings, who had lower platelet counts and three of whom had intracranial hemorrhages (antenatal in two infants). Mild intrauterine growth retardation was observed in one treated infant; all seven infants have developed normally in the two months to four years since birth. We conclude that intravenous gamma globulin, with or without dexamethasone, is effective in elevating the fetal platelet count in severe cases of neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia and in helping to avoid intracranial hemorrhage.\r"

Special properties of NMDA receptors such as their voltage-dependent blockade by Mg2+ (refs 3, 4) and their permeability to Na+, K+ as well as to Ca2+ (refs 5, 6), have led to the suggestion that these receptors are important in plasticity during development and learning. They have been implicated in long-term potentiation (LTP), a model for the study of the cellular mechanisms of learning. We report here that glutamate and NMDA, acting at typical NMDA receptors, stimulate the release of arachidonic acid (as well as 11- and 12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids from striatal neurons probably by stimulation of a Ca2+-dependent phospholipase A2. Kainate and quisqualate, as well as K+-induced depolarization were ineffective. Our results provide direct evidence in favour of the hypothesis, that arachidonic acid derivatives, produced by activation of the postsynaptic cell, could be messengers that cross the synaptic cleft to modify the presynaptic functions known to be altered during LTP. In addition, we suggest that NMDA receptors are the postsynaptic receptors which trigger the synthesis of these putative transynaptic messengers.\r"

Two hypotheses have been proposed to explain how the holoenzyme of the A kinase induces transcription. The regulatory subunits of the A kinase, which bind cAMP and DNA, and have amino-acid homology with the Escherichia coli catabolite activator protein could directly stimulate gene expression. Alternatively, phosphorylation by the catalytic subunits could induce transcription by activating proteins involved in gene transcription. To distinguish between these models, we microinjected purified preparations of the catalytic and regulatory subunits of A kinase into tissue culture cells and monitored expression of a stably integrated fusion gene containing a cAMP-responsive human promoter fused to a bacterial reporter gene, or of the endogenous c-fos gene. The catalytic subunit stimulated expression of these genes, whereas the regulatory subunit did not. These results indicate that the catalytic subunit of A kinase is sufficient to induce expression of two cAMP-responsive genes, without increasing levels of cAMP.\r"

All cats breathed 100% oxygen throughout the occlusion and during 2 hours of reperfusion. Blood pressure, PaO2, and pH remained stable for 8 hours. PaO2 increased from an average base line level of 102 +/- 15 (SD) torr to 520 +/- 45 torr in Group 1, 450 +/- 41 torr in Group 2, 480 +/- 28 torr in Group 3, and 396 +/- 151 torr in Group 4 during the administration of 100% oxygen. The average fluorocrit during occlusion was 6% in Groups 1, 2, and 3. The 24-hour mortality rate was 71% in Group 1, 43% in Group 2, 29% in Group 3, and 14% in Group 4; a midline shift and herniation were present after each fatal infarct. The survivors were sacrificed 10 days after the occlusion. There was a trend toward improvement of neurological function at sacrifice in Groups 2 and 3 compared with Groups 1 and 4. The infarct areas on coronal sections were 2.4 times larger in Group 1 (FDA only) than in Group 4 (control) (P less than 0.05).

None of the 23 patients with primary ovarian failure ovulated. Seven of 63 (11.1%) with secondary ovarian failure did ovulate, and three of 63 (4.8%) conceived and delivered normal, healthy infants. Of patients whose etiology for ovarian failure was partial ovarian resection or chemotherapy, the ovulation rate and pregnancy rate were 30.8 and 15.4%, respectively, compared with 5.0 and 1.7%, respectively, for the other patients with secondary ovarian failure. Serum estradiol and FSH obtained during hormone replacement were not predictive of the resumption of normal reproductive functions. Therefore, it is recommended that patients with secondary ovarian failure, especially in the better-prognosis group, be treated with a trial of estradiol replacement and have close monitoring for ovulation before oocyte donation.\r"

Patients taking warfarin sodium (Coumadin) have been treated without bleeding.

The time course of the pressure response to alpha-hANP were measured prior to and following intravenous administration of 50 micrograms/kg of alpha-hANP. The change in IOP and blood pressure showed the same pattern in the simultaneous record. Silver grains of 125I-alpha-hANP (10 microCi/g body weight) were detected in the ciliary processes of mice by radioautography after intravenous injection. The pupillary response was not tested in this experiment. The mechanism of IOP reduction was discussed.\r"

Seven physicians and thirty-three patients from various parts of the country participated. Each patient underwent three 2-week treatment sessions, with 1 week off treatment between each session. During each treatment session, one injection a day was given. The injection consisted of a placebo for one 2-week session, and the active allergen during the other two sessions. The active dose was determined by earlier intracutaneous provocative food testing. The diet during the study period was not varied. Medication-symptom diaries were maintained and treatment result evaluations for both individual complaints and overall results were detailed on a standard form at the end of each treatment session. While the number of foods treated per patient varied from 1 to 13, the majority were treated with 3 to 5 foods. Treatment with the active medication was more efficacious than with placebo. A few patients' symptoms were aggravated with the active medication. This indicates a correct diagnosis, but incorrect treatment dose. In the clinical setting such adverse response should be reversed. Overall, neutralization subcutaneous treatment should be beneficial approximately 75% of the time, and further enhanced by supplemental diet manipulation.\r"

Sixty-six and thirty-four cases, respectively, were performed. Follow-up questionnaires were sent to this total of 100 patients. Fifty-six patients returned completed questionnaires, which formed the basis of this report. A retrospective chart study was also carried out. The results of surgery and questionnaires are reported as statistical data, and, where applicable, the 1985 AAO-HNS criteria for reporting vertigo and hearing results in the treatment of Meniere's disease are used. Preliminary analysis of these data is reported because of its profound effect upon our treatment protocol for patients with Meniere's disease. Results on use of the Denver valve do not appear to be significantly different than the results of other shunt surgery not using the valve.\r"

This study investigates the hypothesis that lesions of the cervicovaginal area are more common in women with cancers of the head and neck region. The presence of HPV in lesions of both regions is examined. Seven female patients with cancer of the upper aerodigestive tract had DNA analysis of their carcinoma specimens. HPV type 16 was found in two of the seven (28%). Fourteen female patients with upper aerodigestive tract cancers had Papanicolaou smears to search for cytologic evidence of HPV infection, and cervicovaginal lavages to analyze DNA from exfoliated cervical cells. Five of thirteen (38%) Papanicolaou smears revealed koilocytotic atypia and three of these patients had HPV DNA types 16 or 18 identified in the cervical lavage. The incidence of cervical atypia noted is 13-fold greater than average. One patient had HPV type 16 in both her supraglottic cancer and in her cervicovaginal lavage. Evidence of HPV infection at two separate anatomic sites suggests a systemic susceptibility to HPV infection.\r"

  ".W": "Surgical access to the nasopharynx and infratemporal fossa is restricted by the bony structures that support and define these areas. Traditional surgical approaches to the nasopharynx for removal of benign neoplasms follow three directions: (1) the anterior route via the nasal cavity and the maxillary and, if necessary, the ethmoid sinuses; (2) the inferior route through the palate; and (3) the anterolateral retromaxillary pathway via the gingivobuccal sulcus into the pterygoid space. These approaches provide fair access, but limited visibility and little technical control of the neurovascular supply. For the small- to medium-sized tumor, the experienced surgeon is able to successfully manage the majority of cases using these approaches, singly or in combination. However, in patients with larger tumors--when recurrence is more common--approaches offering greater visualization have been developed, such as Panje's facial biflap, Mann's transmaxillary, and Fisch's transtemporal. These provide better access and control at the cost of increased locoregional morbidity, long operating time, and considerable technical complexity. I have developed a simpler, more direct surgical approach that combines the exposure concepts of the head and neck surgeon with the microsurgical techniques of the otosurgeon. It has been applied to eight cases, with minimal morbidity and excellent results, and appears to be the procedure of choice for cases of angiofibroma with early intracranial extension. Subsequently, a similar approach, developed previously by Holliday, has been published in which access into the anterior temporal lobe, petrous apex, and clivus are gained.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

However, a close relationship with another reported sequence for the human enzyme is established, now showing agreement between an indirectly deduced and a directly analyzed NH2-terminal structure of this enzyme type. The results provide evidence of one structural motif common to mammalian species but also suggest that genetic inconstancy 5' to, or at the start of, the region coding for the enzyme protein could be a source of intra- and interspecies diversity. This is of interest in relation to the large number of genetic variants of human glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase.\r"

The 5' genomic flanking sequence of zif/268 has sequences related to binding sites for known regulatory proteins, including four sequences that resemble the core of the serum response elements (SREs) upstream of the c-fos and actin genes.

  ".W": "The dynamics and compartmental characteristics of cAMP metabolism were examined by 18O labeling of cellular adenine nucleotide alpha phosphoryls in rat parotid gland stimulated to secrete with beta-adrenergic and cholinergic agents. The secretory response occurred in association with a rapidly increased rate of cAMP hydrolysis apparently coordinated with an equivalent increase in the rate of cAMP synthesis, since the cellular concentration of cAMP remained unchanged. The magnitude of this metabolic response was equivalent to the metabolism of 10-75 times the cellular content of cAMP within the first minute of stimulation. This increased metabolic rate occurred only during the early (1-3 min) period of stimulation, in what appeared to be an exclusive cellular compartment distinguished by a unique distribution of 18O among adenine nucleotide alpha phosphoryls. This 18O distribution contrasted with that produced by forskolin, which increased cellular cAMP concentration and elicited only a delayed response missing the early secretory component. The early acceleration of cAMP metabolism appeared linked to a stimulus-induced increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration, since the Ca2+ ionophore ionomycin produced the same metabolic response in association with secretion. These observations suggest that cAMP metabolism is involved in stimulus-secretion coupling by a Ca2+-linked mechanism different from that in which cAMP plays the role of a second messenger.\r"

Previous work has established that cII activity is regulated through the turnover of cII protein; the products of the hflA and hflB loci of Escherichia coli are needed for a degradative reaction, and lambda cIII functions in stabilizing cII. By using the cloned hflA locus, we have purified a cII-cleaving enzyme that we term HflA. Purified HflA contains three polypeptides; at least two of the subunits are products of the hflA region, and the third is probably a cleavage product of the larger of these two hflA-encoded polypeptides. The HflA protease activity cleaves cII to small fragments. We conclude that the switch between lambda developmental pathways involves regulated cleavage of cII by the specific protease HflA.\r"

We show here that the activity of the alpha domain of the polyoma virus enhancer displays a similar cell-specificity and inducibility as does the whole enhancer. We present evidence to show that its activity is determined by the balance between the activities of two factors, PEA2, a labile repressor, and PEA1, an inducible positive factor that we have characterized previously. Changes in repressor activity help account for the increase in alpha-domain activity after differentiation of F9 cells. These results suggest that PEA2 is crucial in the regulation of viral gene expression and perhaps more generally in the control of gene expression during differentiation.\r"

To determine where transcription initiates, primary (unprocessed) transcripts were specifically labeled in vitro by the capping reaction catalyzed by guanylyltransferase. Direct mapping of transcription initiation sites was accomplished by hybridization of in vitro-capped RNA with the 5' flanking sequences of mitochondrial genes and subsequent digestion with single-strand-specific RNases. The RNase protection experiments identified three transcription initiation sites for subunit 3 of cytochrome oxidase and at least six transcription initiation sites for subunit 9 of ATP synthase. Thus, transcript size heterogeneity is primarily the result of multiple transcription initiation sites for these genes rather than RNA processing. Primer extension analyses of maize mitochondrial RNA were used to precisely establish the sequences at the initiation sites. Comparison of sequences at transcription initiation sites suggests that some homology exists at these sites, although no highly conserved consensus sequence is obvious.\r"

Though its structure suggests that it can transduce a transmembrane signal, neither its extracellular ligand nor its critical intracellular substrates are known. To explore the functional properties of the protein encoded by neu, we created a fusion gene that joins the cytoplasmic domain of neu to the extracellular portion of an immunoglobulin heavy chain. The localization of the fusion polypeptide can then be controlled by coexpression with immunoglobulin light chain. In the absence of light chain, the heavy chain-neu polypeptide is expressed intracellularly and has no transforming activity. By contrast, in the presence of light chain the fusion polypeptide is expressed at the cell surface and produces tumorigenic foci. Thus, transformation apparently requires expression at the cell surface, where the neu intracellular domain can interact with components that are localized to the plasma membrane. The fusion protein is active in cellular transformation when the transmembrane domain is derived either from neu or from immunoglobulin, indicating that the neu transmembrane domain is not specifically required for transformation, although neu activation in tumors is known to result from a point mutation in this region. The extracellular immunoglobulin heavy and light chain domains of the fusion protein form a functional binding site that allows antigen to modulate its activity, reversing the transforming effect.\r"

  ".W": "Ring chromosomes that have been opened to give linear chromosomes offer an opportunity to study the DNA sequences associated with new chromosome ends. The Drosophila melanogaster chromosome C(1)A was originally a ring chromosome, consisting of two linked X chromosomes, and thus had no telomeres. This chromosome has spontaneously opened in polytene region 13, a region near the middle of the euchromatic arm of the X chromosome. The opening of the ring has produced two new telomeres on the C(1)A chromosome. Each of the new telomeres has acquired He-T DNA sequences. He-T DNA is a complex family of repeated sequences found in the telomeric and pericentric heterochromatin of D. melanogaster chromosomes. He-T DNA sequences are detected, at various levels, in the most distal band on the end of each polytene chromosome in all D. melanogaster stocks. To our knowledge, these sequences have never been detected within the euchromatic chromosomal regions in any stock. The strong correlation between He-T DNA sequences and telomeric regions suggests that He-T sequences may have a role in organizing or maintaining the ends of chromosomes. The association of He-T DNA with newly acquired telomeres in a formerly euchromatic region, polytene region 13, strengthens this correlation.\r"

This insertion mutation resulted from the integration of an ecotropic murine leukemia virus into noncoding sequences of the dilute gene. Therefore, dsu may act like other allele-specific recessive suppressors identified in Drosophila melanogaster and yeast that suppress mutations induced by retrotransposon insertions. To investigate this possibility, we have examined whether dsu could suppress a spontaneously arising allele of d, dl20J, which is shown here to result from a 3.5-kilobase deletion. These studies indicate that dsu does not function like other eukaryotic suppressor genes that suppress retrotransposon-induced mutations. We also show that dsu is not, as originally reported, a recessive gene but is semidominantly inherited. Collectively, these results allow us to propose a mechanism for the suppressor activity of dsu.\r"

The results showed that the X box element was responsible for directing tissue-specific expression when Raji cells were compared to Jurkat cells. The X box could not direct expression of the heterologous promoter in the trans-acting factor-deficient cell line, indicating that the X box is an ultimate target of the missing or defective factor in the RJ2.2.5 cell line.

  ".W": "Carcinogenesis is blocked by an extraordinary variety of agents belonging to many different classes--e.g., phenolic antioxidants, azo dyes, polycyclic aromatics, flavonoids, coumarins, cinnamates, indoles, isothiocyanates, 1,2-dithiol-3-thiones, and thiocarbamates. The only known common property of these anticarcinogens is their ability to elevate in animal cells the activities of enzymes that inactivate the reactive electrophilic forms of carcinogens. Structure-activity studies on the induction of quinone reductase [NAD(P)H:(quinone-acceptor) oxidoreductase, EC 1.6.99.2] and glutathione S-transferases have revealed that many anti-carcinogenic enzyme inducers contain a distinctive and hitherto unrecognized chemical feature (or acquire this feature after metabolism) that regulates the synthesis of these protective enzymes. The inducers are Michael reaction acceptors characterized by olefinic (or acetylenic) bonds that are rendered electrophilic (positively charged) by conjugation with electron-withdrawing substrates. The potency of inducers parallels their efficiency in Michael reactions. Many inducers are also substrates for glutathione S-transferases, which is further evidence for their electrophilicity. These generalizations have not only provided mechanistic insight into the perplexing question of how such seemingly unrelated anticarcinogens induce chemoprotective enzymes, but also have led to the prediction of the structures of inducers with potential chemoprotective activity.\r"

The precise location of the beta-amyloid precursor protein gene on chromosome 21 has not yet been determined. Here we show, by using a somatic-cell/hybrid-cell mapping panel, in situ hybridization, and transverse-alternating-field electrophoresis, that the beta-amyloid precursor protein gene is located on chromosome 21 very near the 21q21/21q22 border and probably within the region of chromosome 21 that, when trisomic, results in Down syndrome.\r"

  ".U": "89042185\r", 
  ".W": "The mechanism by which the antihypertensive agent BRL 34915 (cromakalim) affects action potential duration (APD) and effective refractory period (ERP) in isolated cardiac muscle was investigated. BRL 34915 (greater than or equal to 3 microM) shortened ERP of ferret (Mustela putorius furo) and guinea pig (Cavia porcellus) papillary muscles in a concentration-dependent fashion. The reduction in ERP resulted from a decrease in APD. ERP and APD of papillary muscles were also reduced during hypoxia produced by bubbling the physiological bathing solution with N2 instead of O2. Reduction of APD during hypoxia has previously been attributed to activation of ATP-sensitive K+ channels in heart. Glyburide, an inhibitor of ATP-sensitive K+ channels, prevented or reversed the shortening of ERP and APD produced by hypoxia and BRL 34915, respectively. These results suggest that BRL 34915 acts by opening ATP-sensitive K+ channels in heart. The actions of BRL 34915 were temperature-dependent, decreasing ERP 64% at 37 degrees C, but having no effect at 22 degrees C. The effect of BRL 34915 on K+ currents was tested directly in voltage-clamped guinea pig ventricular myocytes. As observed with the papillary muscles, BRL 34915 was without effect at 22 degrees C. At 36 degrees C, BRL 34915 (after a delay) increased outward currents positive to, and less so at potentials negative to, the K+ current reversal potential. The normal inwardly rectifying current-voltage relationship for peak K+ currents during 200-msec pulses was changed to one that was nearly ohmic. The current activated by BRL 34915 was blocked by glyburide. The data support the hypothesis that BRL 34915, like hypoxia, activates ATP-sensitive K+ channels in the heart. Based upon the profound temperature sensitivity of BRL 34915 action, this activation may be indirect, perhaps by means of modulation of an enzymatic activity that regulates gating of these channels. BRL 34915 and glyburide will be valuable tools for studying the role of ATP-sensitive K+ channels in normal and abnormal cardiac function.\r"

  ".W": "Atriopeptin (AP) is stored as the prohormone AP-126 [atrial natriuretic factor-(1-26)] in atrial granules. Cultured atrial myocytes synthesize and release only prohormone into the medium. HPLC analysis of the coronary venous effluent of media from perfused rat hearts subjected to right atrial stretch indicated the presence of the C-terminal mature hormone AP-28 [atrial natriuretic factor-(99-126)] and little or no prohormone. Absence of calcium from the perfusion medium increased total AP release and surprisingly blocked the proteolytic cleavage of the prohormone. Similarly, addition of the proteolytic inhibitor aprotinin to the perfusion medium suppressed the processing of the endogenous AP-126 released by atrial stretch. Aprotinin would be restricted to the extracellular space, which is therefore implicated as the site of prohormone processing. This suggestion was validated by the demonstration that the perfused rat heart could readily cleave exogenous prohormone to mature hormone, a process blocked by aprotinin. Hypothetically, the stimulus-release-processing event initiated by atrial stretch may require the concerted action of the synthetic cell (i.e., atrial myocyte) and a processing cell or site (e.g., the adjacent atrial mesenchymal cell) for the production of the mature AP-28, which is the circulating molecular form of this endocrine system.\r"

Further, all retroviral nucleocapsid proteins contain either one or two copies of the sequence Cys-Xaa2-Cys-Xaa4-His-Xaa4-Cys. The conservation of this sequence suggested that it is important for virus replication, and its resemblance to the \"zinc-finger\" sequences found in eukaryotic transcription factors raised the possibility that it recognizes specific sequences in viral RNA during retrovirus assembly. We used oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis to generate a series of mutations in the nucleocapsid protein-coding region of Moloney murine leukemia virus. These mutations changed single amino acids, including each of the cysteines, to serine. The mutant viral genomes direct the synthesis of virus particles; these particles lack detectable viral RNA but do contain significant levels of cellular RNAs. Thus it appears that the mutations have destroyed the ability of the viral proteins to specifically package viral RNA during virus assembly. We propose that the conserved sequence in retroviral nucleocapsid proteins functions in RNA sequence recognition and suggest that it is evolutionarily related to the zinc fingers that recognize specific sequences in double-stranded DNA.\r"

Chicken embryo vinculin contains 1066 amino acids, has a calculated Mr of 116,990, a calculated pI of 5.9, and a hydropathy index of -4.22. A search of the National Biomedical Research Foundation protein sequence data base found no proteins with significant homology to vinculin. A striking feature of the linear sequence is a proline-rich region extending between residues 837 and 879. This region contains 45% proline and 19% aspartic plus glutamic acids; it is also the longest hydrophilic stretch in the molecule. The proline-rich region separates an amino-terminal domain with a calculated pI of 5.4 from a carboxyl-terminal domain with a calculated pI of 9.7. This feature suggests a structural basis for the specific interaction of vinculin with acidic phospholipids and a mechanism for the shuttling of vinculin between cytoplasm and membrane-associated junctional plaque.\r"

The independent partial revertants analyzed are caused by the insertion of different transposons into the same region of gypsy. One partial revertant of the yellow allele y2 arose as a consequence of the insertion of the jockey mobile element into gypsy sequences, whereas a second incomplete revertant is due to the insertion of the hobo transposon. In addition, a previously isolated partial revertant of the Hairy-wing allele Hw1 resulted from the integration of the BS transposable element into the same gypsy sequences. The region affected by the insertion of the three transposons contains 12 copies of a repeated motif that shows striking homology to mammalian transcriptional enhancers. Our results suggest that these sequences, which might be involved in the transcriptional control of the gypsy element, are also responsible for the induction of mutant phenotypes by this retrotransposon.\r"

The regions of the DR alpha-chain gene that are responsible for basal and recombinant IFN-gamma-induced gene transcription have been determined by gene transfer of a series of 5' deletion mutants in which the upstream region of the DR alpha chain was linked to a reporter gene, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase. Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase transcript and protein levels were determined by S1 nuclease protection and chloramphenicol acetyltransferase enzyme assays, respectively. By using these deletion mutants, we were able to draw the following conclusions. (i) One hundred and nine base pairs of upstream sequence contains the basic DR alpha-chain gene promoter and represents the minimal amount of sequence necessary for basal gene expression. (ii) An additional 9 base pairs of upstream sequence can mediate recombinant IFN-gamma induction. (iii) Maximal recombinant IFN-gamma induction requires at most an additional 23 base pairs of upstream sequence. (iv) The sequence between positions -267 and -141 does not appear to contain any additional positive or negative regulatory elements. These results suggest that the region between positions -141 and -109 contains a critical IFN-gamma-responsive element. Substitution mutagenesis was performed to confirm this suggestion.\r"

The double-negative subset contains precursors of the other three populations and can reconstitute the thymus following intravenous or intrathymic transfer into irradiated hosts. In an attempt to establish the sequence of CD4 and CD8 expression during intrathymic development, we investigated the differentiation potential of highly purified CD8+ thymocytes by using intravenous or intrathymic adoptive transfer. Unlike the double-negative thymocyte subset, CD8+ cells did not have the ability to home to the thymus following intravenous transfer. However, when CD8+ thymocytes were injected directly into the thymus, they increased in number and gave rise to CD4+, CD8+ double-positive and CD4+ single-positive progeny. Furthermore, the rate of appearance of CD4+ cells from injected CD8+ precursors was faster than from the double-negative subset. Cells expressing a high surface density of CD8 convert to double-positive and CD4+ progeny without increasing in number, whereas CD8+ cells expressing a low surface density of the marker expand greatly and give rise to differentiated progeny. The results suggest that CD8 expression is an intermediate step on the differentiation pathway of mature CD4+ T cells.\r"

  ".W": "Membrane proteins of transporting epithelia are often distributed between apical and basolateral surfaces to produce a functionally polarized cell. The distribution of Na+,K+-ATPase [ATP phosphohydrolase (Na+/K+-transporting), EC 3.6.1.37] between apical and basolateral membranes of hepatocytes has been controversial. Because Na+,K+-ATPase activity is fluidity dependent and the physiochemical properties of the apical membrane reduces its fluidity, we investigated whether altering membrane fluidity might uncover cryptic Na+,K+-ATPase in bile canalicular (apical) surface fractions free of detectable Na+,K+-ATPase and glucagon-stimulated adenylate cyclase activities. Apical fractions exhibited higher diphenylhexatriene-fluorescence polarization values when compared with sinusoidal (basolateral) membrane fractions. When 2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethyl 8-(cis-2-n-octylcyclopropyl)octanoate (A2C) was added to each fraction, Na+,K+-ATPase, but not glucagon-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity, was activated in the apical fraction. In contrast, further activation of both enzymes was not seen in sinusoidal fractions. The A2C-induced increase in apical Na+,K+-ATPase approached 75% of the sinusoidal level. Parallel increases in apical Na+,K+-ATPase were produced by benzyl alcohol and Triton WR-1339. All three fluidizing agents decreased the order component of membrane fluidity. Na+,K+-ATPase activity in each subfraction was identically inhibited by the monoclonal antibody 9-A5, a specific inhibitor of this enzyme. These findings suggest that hepatic Na+,K+-ATPase is distributed in both surface membranes but functions more efficiently and, perhaps, specifically in the sinusoidal membranes because of their higher bulk lipid fluidity.\r"

When the m1 and m3 receptors were stimulated with carbachol, there was a rapid rise of liberated arachidonic acid, inositol phosphates, and cAMP, while m2 and m4 receptor stimulation had no detectable stimulation of these second messengers. Pretreatment with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) caused a marked acceleration and amplification of m1 and m3 receptor-mediated arachidonic acid release. In contrast, m1- and m3-mediated inositol phosphate formation was inhibited by the same PMA pretreatment. Arachidonic acid release was unaffected by manipulations of cAMP levels. Arachidonic acid production was inhibited by calcium-free medium and 3,4,5-trimethoxybenzoic acid 8-(diethylamino)octyl ester (TMB-8; an inhibitor of cytosolic calcium mobilization) yet was unaffected by verapamil, a calcium-channel blocker. These experiments show that arachidonic acid release induced by the m1 and m3 receptors is regulated independently of phospholipase C and cAMP accumulation. Carbachol stimulation of the m1 and m3 cAMP accumulation. Carbachol stimulation of the m1 and m3 receptors also markedly decreased mitogenesis as measured by thymidine incorporation. The m1 receptor-mediated inhibition of mitogenesis could be partially blocked by indomethacin, a cyclooxygenase inhibitor. The inhibition of mitogenesis could be mimicked by cAMP elevation.\r"

  ".W": "The economic effects of alcohol abuse are as damaging to the nation as the health effects, affecting the family, the community, and persons of all ages. Underaged drinking is interfering with children's development, affecting the nation's ability to respond to economic challenge in the future. The college aged may be the most difficult to educate about alcohol abuse because of drinking patterns established at an early age and susceptibility to advertising inducements. Health care costs for families with an alcoholic member are twice those for families without one, and up to half of all emergency room admissions are alcohol related. Fetal alcohol syndrome is one of the top three known causes of birth defects, and is totally preventable. Alcohol abuse and alcoholism are estimated to have cost the nation $117 billion in 1983, while nonalcoholic drug abuse that year cost $60 billion. Costs of alcohol abuse are expected to be $136 billion a year by 1990, mostly from lost productivity and employment. Between 6 and 7 million workers are alcoholic, with an undetermined loss of productivity, profits, and competitiveness of American business. Alcohol abuse contributes to the high health care costs of the elderly beneficiaries of Federal health financing programs. Heavily affected minorities include blacks, Hispanics, and Native Americans. Society tends to treat the medical and social consequences of alcohol abuse, rather than its causes. Although our experience with the consequences of alcohol abuse is greater than that for any other drug, public concern for its prevention and treatment is less than for other major illnesses or abuse of other drugs.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Prospects for research advances in alcoholism are very promising, because of the explosion in the neurosciences and advances in epidemiology and typology of the disorder. For example, the field is now ready for molecular genetics studies of the early onset form of alcoholism that is transmitted from father to son with high penetrance. Leading neuroscientists are being recruited into alcoholism research. Paradoxically, this time of new hope coincides with challenges to the scientific enterprise, such as the animal rights movement and impatience with the scientific process in the face of the public health emergencies represented by acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and drug abuse. The emergence of genetically based subtypes of alcoholism suggests that at least two discrete illness processes are involved. Mounting evidence from spinal fluid studies has rekindled interest in a key role for serotonin in the early onset form of alcoholism. One hypothesis now being explored is that genetically low brain serotonin function may be part of the predisposition to this form of alcoholism. It is known that acute alcohol intake transiently increases brain serotonin turnover. Thus, drinking might be viewed as an attempt to correct a deficit, only to produce further serotonin depletion as the drug's effect wears off, setting up a vicious cycle of repeated attempts to self-medicate. Impulsive, violent, and suicidal behavior as well as alcohol abuse are associated with the low brain serotonin activity. Persons with these problems suffer from circadian rhythm and glucose metabolism disturbances that may also be mediated by serotonin. New pharmacological probes are now available to tease out the mechanisms of altered serotonin function.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The Alcohol, Drug Abuse, and Mental Health Administration's Office for Substance Abuse Prevention (OSAP) was established to initiate programs to provide prevention and early intervention services for young people, especially high-risk youth. OSAP's starting point was the theories and models that provide the background body of knowledge. The models summarized here guide new prevention efforts and provide a framework for analyzing diverse experiences in the field. The goal has been to develop strategies based on theories and models of prevention that can reverse or prevent adolescent alcohol use. Among the psychosocial models, research in social learning theory is the theoretical basis for prevention efforts using the team approach among individuals, small groups, families, and communities. A prevention technique based on cognitive dissonance theory proposes verbal inoculations to establish or strengthen beliefs and attitudes, helping a young person to resist drinking, which may be in conflict with another, more desirable goal. In the developmental concept adolescence is a period of role confusion out of which the person's identity should emerge. Prevention efforts built on this view seek to help adolescents to form positive identities by achievement as students, athletes, and in community roles. Behavioral intention theory provides a framework for understanding the role of perceived social norms in directing behaviors. In the social development model, prevention programs should create positive peer groups and ensure that the social environment does not give mixed messages. Health behavior theory is the basis for prevention strategies directed toward a person's entire behavior instead of one aspect.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Alcoholism is an often overlooked health problem because alcoholics usually do not seek treatment for their drinking problems. They do, however, seek general medical care for other health reasons, and a number of screening techniques have proven useful for identifying alcoholics. The advantages and disadvantages of self-report, as well as biochemical techniques that have been found effective in screening for alcoholism, are discussed. We recommend that future research be aimed at developing quick, accurate, and inexpensive screening devices that also can evaluate the severity of the alcohol problem. Ideally, screening procedures would discourage feigned responses, differentiate between drinking and consequences of drinking, and permit the identification of subtypes of alcoholics. Better understanding of the types of errors made by common screening instruments would enable researchers to construct an optimal sequencing strategy for screening for alcoholism.\r"

  ".W": "Two major trends regarding alcohol use and consequences of alcohol abuse in the United States are showing significant improvement. Continued declines are evident in age-adjusted rates of liver cirrhosis mortality, and per capita alcohol consumption is at its lowest level in 15 years. Two other trends, however, are less clear. After declining in 1982 and continuing through 1984, alcohol-related morbidity--as measured by principal diagnoses listed on short-stay, community hospital discharges--showed a slight increase in 1985. Similarly, after declining every year but one since 1981, alcohol-related motor vehicle fatalities showed a significant increase in 1986. The downward trends suggest that progress is being made in efforts to reduce alcohol-related deaths and morbidity, but there are no easy explanations for any of the trends. Reductions in liver cirrhosis death rates may reflect coding changes in liver disease categories, less chronic heavy drinking, or better medical care. Lower per capita alcohol consumption may indicate the public's increased awareness of drinking risks or the aging of the U.S. population. Ironically, the recent increase in alcohol-related motor vehicle fatalities may reflect stronger enforcement of drunk driving laws and increased BAC (blood alcohol content) testing.\r"

  ".W": "It is well known that alcohol abuse is significantly involved in the incidence of casualties (that is, accidents and injuries as they are defined for the purpose of coding diagnoses in the International Classification of Diseases). Thus, a study was conducted of the feasibility of using data from the National Hospital Discharge Survey (NHDS) for the surveillance of alcohol-related casualties. Trends were analyzed over 7 years (1979-85), and results were discussed from three aspects: number and rates for comorbidity of injuries and accidents with alcohol-related diagnoses, percent of alcohol involvement for injuries and accidents, and proportionate morbidity for alcohol-related and nonalcohol-related injuries and accidents. The incidence of comorbidity and percent of alcohol involvement were found to be relatively low for both accidents and injuries--underreporting being a likely cause. Comorbidity rates over the 7-year period showed no major trends in the rates for injuries that were associated with alcohol use, but the rates for accidents that were associated with alcohol use increased in all but one of the years. Proportionate morbidity as reflected in hospital discharge records with alcohol-related diagnoses showed only small differences by sex and age group (except the 14 to 25 years group) for either injuries or accidents. Only the 25- to 44-year-old group showed a time-trend increase, and that is only for the accident category. For these reasons, we have concluded that data from the NHDS are not currently adequate for use in the surveillance of alcohol-related injuries and accidents.\r"

Alcoholism services research can be grouped into five classifications: a) descriptive studies of resources for alcoholism treatment and of the use or cost of these services, b) estimates of the need or demand for alcohol services in the population or in particular subpopulations, c) studies of the costs or cost-effectiveness of alcoholism treatment or of alternative treatments, d) studies of the possible \"cost-offsets\" of treating alcoholism, and e) studies that examine strategies for financing and reimbursement for alcoholism treatment. Research is needed to determine how alcoholism treatment services are now delivered, who uses these services, how treatment setting and organization affect service delivery, who pays for alcoholism treatment, and how reimbursement policies affect the delivery of alcoholism services. Research on large-scale social issues is also needed, such as the effects of warning labels appearing on alcoholic beverage containers or estimates of the overall cost to society of alcohol abuse.\r"

Of this total, approximately 51.1 percent was contributed by State governments, 17.9 percent by the Federal Government, 9.1 percent by county or local agencies, and 21.9 percent by other sources (for example, private health insurance). Approximately 76.5 percent of the funds was expended for treatment services, 12.6 percent for prevention services, and 10.9 percent for other services (for example, administration, research, training). Between fiscal years 1985 and 1987, total expenditures increased 31.2 percent, although great variability existed among States, with some undergoing significant cuts. The total number of alcohol and drug treatment units that received State funds was 6,632. During fiscal year 1987, admissions for alcoholism treatment in these State-supported facilities totaled 1,317,473. Most admissions were to a nonhospital environment (84.6 percent) and were for outpatient care (44.9 percent). Of the total number of admissions, 76.2 percent were men and 19.8 percent women; the sex of 4.0 percent was not reported. With regard to age, 27.4 percent were 25-34, 21.7 percent were 35-44, 10.7 percent were 21-24, and 4.1 percent were under 18. In terms of race or ethnicity, 69.7 percent of those admitted were white, 15.6 percent black, 5.5 percent Hispanic, 3.6 percent Native American, 0.2 percent Asian or Pacific Islander, 0.3 percent others, and 5.2 percent not reported.

Today, approximately 300 alcohol and substance abuse treatment programs offer services to American Indians, among them primary residential treatment, halfway houses, outreach, and aftercare. This system provides a national network upon which additional activities may be established. Along with increasing its attention to health promotion and disease prevention, the IHS has moved toward the prevention of alcoholism. A variety of preventive programs are in place that emphasize improved self-image, value and attitude clarification, decision-making, and physical and emotional effects of alcohol and substance abuse. Many begin as Head Start programs and continue through adulthood. In 1986, after consulting with both academic and tribal experts, the IHS devised a strategic plan for alcoholism control that stresses comprehensive care and prevention activities; it serves as a guide for further program development. The Secretary of Health and Human Services created a Task Force on Indian Alcoholism in 1986 to serve as a coordinating body for activities carried out by the IHS and other agencies and units of the Department. Passage of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act in 1986 added resources for the development of adolescent treatment centers and, more importantly, for community-based pre- and post-residential care for youths and their families. Concomitant with these initiatives have been several instances of increased attention by various tribes to the problem of alcoholism.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Sensitivity to gender issues in the research community has generated a modest but growing amount of data on the biological effects of alcohol consumption on women. Data generally indicate that the same amounts of alcohol have greater effects on women and that women develop more severe alcohol problems than men over shorter drinking histories. Despite a number of studies, however, there are no clear differences between women and men in the impact of alcohol consumption on cognitive processes. Although the findings are mixed, the data point toward greater physiological deterioration among women as compared with men who have similar drinking histories. These differences may be related to the differences in patterns of social recognition and reaction that occur in instances of alcoholism among women. Such differences are confirmed by other data that indicate greater social isolation and general disorganization among female alcoholics than among male alcoholics. The risks of fetal alcohol syndrome that are associated with heavy alcohol consumption among women during pregnancy have been established, and a complex of other relationships between alcohol consumption and reproductive-related systems and behaviors exists. Linkages between sexual dysfunction, sexual satisfaction, and alcohol consumption appear to exist, but have not yet become clearly understood. It appears that alcohol may be used as a self-medication to cope with perceived problems of sexuality. It also appears that heavy alcohol consumption can contribute to sexual dysfunction and dissatisfaction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In the 18th century, physicians became aware that maternal alcohol consumption resulted in excess fetal and neonatal mortality, low birth weight, and many other deleterious effects. Perhaps as a response to the temperance and Prohibition periods, scientists lost sight of or interest in the effects of alcohol in pregnancy. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, the issue surfaced again, and scientists began systematic and in-depth studies of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and alcohol-related birth defects (ARBD). Epidemiologic research now suggests that FAS has outranked Down's syndrome and spina bifida in prevalence and is now the leading known cause of mental retardation. Further, it is the only one of these three that is preventable. Because a safe limit of alcohol consumption in pregnancy is not defined, abstinence during pregnancy is the most prudent preventive measure. Factors such as race, beer drinking, maternal weight gain, and low socioeconomic status are associated with a statistical increase in the incidence of FAS. In families where one child has been diagnosed as having FAS, the incidence rate can be as much as 405-fold higher than the worldwide average. Neurobehavioral deficits can occur in the offspring of drinking mothers in the absence of a diagnosis of full FAS. The deficits differ with age and seem to persist into adulthood. Mental retardation or borderline mental retardation is a nearly ubiquitous neurological deficit in diagnosed FAS.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "There are 28 million children of alcoholics in the United States--1 of every 8 Americans. They are more likely than others to suffer from alcoholism and a wide range of physical, emotional, and mental health problems. It is probable that an inherited predisposition for the disease of alcoholism exists. Most children of alcoholics do not become alcoholic, but they are at increased risk for many other health problems. Records of the use of services provided by health maintenance organizations and of health insurance claims show that children of alcoholics use more medical and hospital services than other children. Children of alcoholics are more likely to have problems in school and to abuse alcohol and other drugs. Their mental and physical health problems persist into adulthood. Clinical findings show that life in an alcoholic family is often characterized by pain, guilt, fear, tension, and insecurity. Children do not know that alcoholism is a disease which they cannot cause, control, or cure. Because alcoholism is a family secret, children rarely seek help, even as adults. Because the children of alcoholics are in many medical and social service systems, greater awareness and understanding by health and human service professionals can lead to identification and help for this vulnerable group. It is critical for family physicians, obstetricians, pediatricians, nurses, social workers, hospital staff, and others to incorporate questions about family alcoholism in routine screening procedures for youth and adults. Recommendations and useful materials are discussed.\r"

Thirty-three percent of the victims had alcohol in their blood. Those with blood alcohol present were more likely to demonstrate such characteristics as being male, leaving no note, being found in a vehicle, having no prior attempt, using a gun, killing themselves in the evening or at night, and not being under psychiatric treatment. The results are interpreted to mean that alcohol is a contributory cause of impulsive suicides. Suicides related to long-standing conditions, such as chronic depression or physical illness, which are less spontaneous and more predictable, are less likely to involve alcohol. The alcohol-related suicide is more likely to be impulsive. Alcohol-involved suicides reflect general drinking patterns, with men drinking more than women, and most drinking being done in the evening.\r"

More than 400 chapters of local citizen groups concerned with reducing drunken driving were formed. New media coverage, measured in number of stories, increased fiftyfold from 1980 to 1984. More than 500 legislative reforms were passed. All States now have adopted a legal drinking age of 21. Many also adopted criminal and administrative per se laws and instituted penalty increases for drunken driving. By 1985, the total number of fatal crashes declined to 39,168, a decrease of 6,116, or 16 percent, from the 1980 level of 45,284. Single-vehicle fatal crashes occurring at night, those most likely to involve alcohol, declined by 20 percent, with 3,674 fewer crashes in 1985 than in 1980. Among teenage drivers, declines in fatal crashes were steeper: Fatal crashes decreased 26 percent, and single-vehicle night fatal crashes were down 34 percent. After 1984, however, the number of new citizen groups established and the number of stories appearing in the media began to decline. In 1986, after decreasing for several years, the number of fatal crashes rose 5 percent, and single-vehicle night fatal crashes rose 7 percent, up 1,060 from 1985. Among teenage drivers, the increase in single-vehicle night fatal crashes was even higher, up 17 percent. In 1987, single-vehicle night fatal crashes declined slightly but still remained higher than in 1983, 1984, or 1985.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

However, during the past 10 years, drinking and problems related to drinking and driving have gradually decreased among college students. Results of a study of students at the same 56 colleges and universities throughout the United States (3,145 in 1982-83, 2,797 in 1984-85, and 3,375 in 1987-88) revealed few changes in collegiate drinking patterns and problems attributable to the nationwide increase in the minimum age for alcohol purchase. There was a decline in the proportion of students who drank in the period during which the law changed. However, the proportion of students categorized as heavy drinkers remained constant over time and the proportion of underage students (81 percent) who drank was higher than the proportion of legal age students who drank (75 percent). Of 17 problems related to drinking, all but 5 remained stable over the time periods. Three of the problems represent the continuum of an established trend of fewer students to indicating drinking and driving-related problems. As discussed in this paper, creative alcohol programming can assist in controlling alcohol abuse among college students.\r"

  ".W": "Efforts to curtail alcohol abuse and alcoholism can be divided into primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention. Primary prevention attempts to stop a problem or illness from occurring in the first place. Secondary prevention identifies persons in the early stages of problematic or illness behavior and refers them for counseling or treatment, which is considered tertiary prevention. Five research areas concerned with primary and secondary prevention are selected for discussion: youth, the mass media, the worksite, blacks and Hispanics, and alcohol-related behavior that increases the risk of AIDS. Several of these themes have been in the forefront of alcohol prevention research; others such as AIDS are emergent areas of injury. The discussion to follow briefly summarizes research approaches, key findings, methodological shortcomings, and suggested issues for future investigation. Although scientifically solid prevention studies have been conducted, more rigorous, more comprehensive, and more innovative research is needed. Given the dynamic sociocultural and economic systems in which prevention occurs, research techniques that can address this complexity are required. A range of appropriate methodologies is described.\r"

A review of data on outcomes of treatment for long-term alcohol dependence indicates that 9 of 10 alcohol dependent persons receive no treatment for the disorder in any given year. When treatment is provided for long-term alcohol dependent persons, it has only slightly positive results. As a result, many clinicians and researchers have concluded that rather than exclusive preoccupation with long-term alcoholics, early intervention with persons who are just beginning to abuse alcohol may be a more effective use of resources.\r"

Evidence has accumulated to indicate that alcoholism is a heterogeneous entity arising from multiple etiologies. The demonstrated role of genetics in increasing the risk of alcoholism has promoted the search for biological markers that could objectively identify individuals who are genetically predisposed to alcoholism. Identifying such markers could allow for early diagnosis, focused prevention, and differential and type-specific treatment of alcoholism. Promising markers have been provided by research in electrophysiology, endocrinology, and biochemistry. Recent advances in molecular genetics are offering prospects for direct analysis of the human genome to determine elements that provide predisposition to, and protection from, alcoholism. Recent advances in research and new knowledge gained by the alcoholism treatment community and the lay public are helping to diminish the societal damage caused by alcohol abuse and alcoholism and to change prevailing attitudes about them.\r"

  ".U": "89042649\r", 
  ".W": "An empirical biobehavioral research approach to the conditions generally identified as alcohol abuse and alcoholism emphasizes the temporal ordering of participating biochemical, physiological, and behavioral events that provide an operational basis for characterizing the functional aspects of this complex disorder and identifying distinguishable features of the alcohol abuse and dependence process. The available evidence suggests that alcoholism is a condition determined by a host of continuous variables rather than an entity possessing static qualities that imply intractability. The challenge for biobehavioral research is to determine the details of how chronic and excessive alcohol drinking is generated as well as the conditions under which such overindulgence can be attenuated and prevented. Environmental context, for example, can dramatically alter the frequency and amount of alcohol intake. Such contextual malleability is suggested as an important key to at least some of the inconsistencies in the literature with regard to the conditions under which chronic and excessive alcohol intake occurs. Excessive and chronic alcohol ingestion would seem most parsimoniously viewed as a set of behaviors for which others might have been substituted, and intermittently do, rather than as a highly specific disorder or disease. Though current etiological, preventive, and therapeutic orientations emphasize the role of physical dependence and favor genetic influences as strong determinants of alcohol-related disorders, it is important to recognize that troubled drinking is malleable, waxing and then entering periods of remission, with alcohol drinking even in severely dependent individuals remaining susceptible to control by both antecedent and consequating environmental events.\r"

The outer membrane, which beta-lactam agents cross via pores composed of porin proteins, is the major individual barrier in the wall structure but does not of itself exclude these antibiotics. Rather, it slows their influx to a level that the periplasmic clearance mechanisms may manage to contain. The clearance mechanisms include hydrolysis and perhaps covalent binding by beta-lactamases and nonessential penicillin-binding proteins. The balance between uptake and clearance determines the fate of the cell, rather than one or the other factor alone. It is possible to represent this interplay mathematically for Escherichia coli, but Pseudomonas aeruginosa presents a more ambivalent picture. Moreover, the relations among porin quantity, permeability, and resistance are much better established for E. coli than for P. aeruginosa, and the possible existence of additional barrier layers--besides the outer membrane--in the latter species cannot be excluded.\r"

  ".W": "The kinetic interactions of the beta-lactamase from Enterobacter cloacae 908 R with ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, and ceftazidime have been examined in detail. With all of these cephalosporins, there is an initial rapid reaction involving opening of the beta-lactam that then decreases to a slower steady-state rate (kss) of beta-lactam hydrolysis (at 37 degrees C: ceftriaxone, kss = 0.044 s-1; cefotaxime, kss = 0.033 s-1; ceftazidime, kss = 0.011 s-1). More than stoichiometric quantities of beta-lactam are cleaved during the rapid phase, during which there is accumulation of a transiently stable cephalosporin-enzyme complex whose rate of breakdown is slower than the overall rate of hydrolysis. Qualitatively similar behavior is observed with the E. cloacae M6300 beta-lactamase. These observations eliminate the possibility that the reaction follows a simple linear kinetic scheme. A branched kinetic scheme in which an initially formed acyl intermediate partitions between deacylation and elimination of the 3' substituent is proposed to explain the data. Investigations of the interaction of ceftriaxone with the chromosomally encoded beta-lactamases from Citrobacter freundii, Providencia rettgeri, Morganella morganii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli show that the partitioning behavior of E. cloacae beta-lactamases is atypical. All of the data, however, clearly demonstrate that it is a physical impossibility for cephalosporin trapping to contribute to bacterial resistance phenotypes.\r"

  ".W": "Pseudomonas aeruginosa demonstrates high intrinsic resistance to most beta-lactam antibiotics. Two factors that are interrelated appear to be important in this intrinsic resistance: an inducible, chromosomally encoded type Id beta-lactamase and low outer-membrane permeability. beta-Lactamase-noninducible mutants are supersusceptible to many beta-lactam agents, whereas constitutively derepressed mutants are considerably more resistant even to so-called beta-lactamase-stable beta-lactams. For the latter mutants, by analysis of kinetics, it can be demonstrated that synergy between slow permeation across the outer membrane and slow hydrolysis of the beta-lactamase-stable beta-lactams can explain resistance. Wild-type P. aeruginosa allows outer membrane permeation of beta-lactam agents at rates 1%-8% of those measured for Escherichia coli. The majority of trans-outer-membrane channels formed by P. aeruginosa porin protein F are too small to allow passage of beta-lactam antibiotics. Nevertheless, this porin is apparently a conduit for beta-lactams, since protein F-deficient mutants have small changes in susceptibility to certain beta-lactam agents. This low outer-membrane permeability acting in synergy with beta-lactamase is probably responsible for intrinsic beta-lactam resistance in P. aeruginosa.\r"

Resistance emerges most often during therapy for lower respiratory tract infections. There are several unique features of this resistance to imipenem. First, cross-resistance to other beta-lactam agents is not observed. Second, the mechanism of resistance in most of the isolates studied to date appears to be related to a selective permeability barrier across the bacterial outer membrane, usually associated with discrete alterations in the electrophoretic profiles of outer membrane proteins. These data suggest that imipenem may traverse the outer membrane of P. aeruginosa via a specific porin protein that is not critical for penetration of other beta-lactam antibiotics.\r"

Structural studies of the pilin protein and the pilus fiber may aid the rational design of a peptide-based vaccine by providing information on the antigenic surface of pili that includes the identification of sequence-distant antigenic regions that are localized to single areas of the three-dimensional structure. Preliminary results suggest that the pilin subunit has structural similarity to the 4-alpha-helix bundle fold in proteins such as the coat protein subunit of tobacco mosaic virus and myohemerythrin. Therefore, the monomeric protein myohemeythrin was used to identify structural correlations for antigenic determinants on 4-alpha-helix bundle proteins such as pilin.\r"

This protein was purified from both N. gonorrhoeae and N. meningitidis and was found to contain approximately 1 mole of Fe /mole of protein. Sera from patients with gonococcal infections contained antibodies to the MIRP. Thus, the MIRP is expressed in vivo.

Two major and distinct cell-surface polysaccharides are expressed by different strains of P. aeruginosa: the serotype determinant located on the O polysaccharide side chain of the lipopolysaccharide and mucoid exopolysaccharide (MEP), an antigen usually made by isolates of P. aeruginosa from patients with cystic fibrosis. The serotype determinant has been isolated in a high-molecular-weight, non-toxic, immunogenic form known as high-molecular-weight polysaccharide. High-molecular-weight polysaccharide is safe and immunogenic in humans and elicits T cell immunity to P. aeruginosa infection in animals. Purified MEP antigen has been shown to be immunogenic in animals, and patients with cystic fibrosis colonized with mucoid P. aeruginosa respond to MEP with the production of high-titered serum antibody. In spite of brisk immune responses of patients with cystic fibrosis to MEP, they are unable to deal with the chronic respiratory colonization by mucoid P. aeruginosa. An association has been established between the presence of opsonic-killing antibody to MEP and the lack of colonization of older patients with cystic fibrosis with P. aeruginosa.\r"

Monoclonal antibodies reacting with the type II polysaccharide antigen could be divided into two general antigen binding groups on the basis of the ability of beta-methylgalactopyranoside to inhibit their binding to purified type II antigen. Various proportions of antibodies with the two specificities were observed in rabbit and human sera. Although it was previously reported that rabbit antisera could not distinguish between the sialylated and nonsialylated forms of the type Ib polysaccharide, mouse monoclonal antibodies were found to exhibit exclusive specificity for one or the other form of the antigen. Only monoclonal antibodies specific for the sialylated Ib polysaccharide were protective in a mouse model.\r"

  ".W": "The glycoprotein hormones lutropin (LH) and follitropin (FSH), which have common alpha-subunits but hormone-specific beta-subunits, are both synthesized in the gonadotroph. However, they bear Asn-linked oligosaccharides that differ in structure. Those on LH terminate with the sequence SO4-4GalNAc beta 1----4GlcNAc beta 1----2Man alpha, whereas those on FSH terminate with the sequence sialic acid alpha-Gal beta 1----4GlcNAc beta 1----2Man alpha. A GalNAc-transferase was identified in bovine pituitary membranes that recognizes features of the alpha-subunit peptide and adds GalNAc to its oligosaccharides with an apparent Michaelis constant of 25 micromolar. The different patterns of glycosylation for LH and FSH indicate that access to the protein recognition marker on the alpha-subunit is modulated by the associated beta-subunit. The tightly regulated synthesis of sulfated and sialylated oligosaccharides on the pituitary glycoprotein hormones suggests these oligosaccharides have an important biological role.\r"

  ".W": "The microtubule-associated protein MAP2 is a prominent large-sized component of purified brain microtubules that, like the 36- to 38-kilodalton tau proteins, bears antigenic determinants found in association with the neurofibrillary tangles of Alzheimer's disease. The complete sequence of mouse brain MAP2 was determined from a series of overlapping cloned complementary DNAs. The sequence of the carboxyl-terminal 185 amino acids is very similar (67 percent) to a corresponding region of tau protein, and includes a series of three imperfect repeats, each 18 amino acids long and separated by 13 or 14 amino acids. A subcloned fragment spanning the first two of the 18-amino acid repeats was expressed as a polypeptide by translation in vitro. This polypeptide copurified with microtubules through two successive cycles of polymerization and depolymerization, whereas a control polypeptide derived from the amino-terminal region of MAP2 completely failed to copurify. These data imply that the carboxyl-terminal domain containing the 18-amino acid repeats constitutes the microtubule binding site in MAP2. The occurrence of these repeats in tau protein suggests that these may be a general feature of microtubule binding proteins.\r"

  ".W": "The signal for sex determination in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is the ratio of the number of X chromosomes to the number of sets of autosomes (X/A ratio). By previous genetic tests, elements that feminized chromosomal males appeared to be widespread on the X chromosome, but the nature of these elements was not determined. In experiments to define a feminizing element molecularly, cloned sequences were added to chromosomally male embryos by microinjection into the mother. Three different X-chromosome clones, including part of an actin gene, part of a myosin heavy chain gene, and all of two myosin light chain genes, feminize chromosomal males. Both somatic and germline aspects of sex determination are affected. In contrast, about 40 kilobases of nematode autosomal DNA, phage lambda DNA, and plasmid pBR322 DNA do not affect sex determination. A feminizing region was localized to a maximum of 131 base pairs within an intron of the X-linked actin gene; a part of the gene that does not have this region is not feminizing. The results suggest that short, discrete elements found associated with many X-linked genes may act as signals for sex determination in C. elegans.\r"

The fidelity of purified HIV-1 reverse transcriptase was measured during DNA polymerization in vitro by means of three different assays. Reverse transcriptase from HIV-1 introduced base-substitution errors in DNA from the bacteriophage phi X174 amber3 at estimated frequencies of 1/2000 to 1/4000. Analyses of misincorporation rates opposite a single template adenine residue showed that HIV-1 reverse transcriptase catalyzed nucleotide mismatches with a specificity of A:C much greater than A:G greater than A:A. The high error rate of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase in vitro translates to approximately five to ten errors per HIV-1 genome per round of replication in vivo. This high error rate suggests that misincorporation by HIV-1 reverse transcriptase is, at least in part, responsible for the hypermutability of the AIDS virus. The specificity of misincorporation may provide a basis for the systematic construction of antiviral nucleosides.\r"

In 71 patients the diagnosis was made during upper gastrointestinal roentgenologic evaluation for abdominal symptoms, in three it was made during mesenteric arteriography or bleeding scan for massive rectal bleeding, in six it was made during exploratory laparotomy for acute abdominal signs and symptoms, and in the remaining six it was an incidental intraoperative finding. Surgical indications occurred in 13 patients (15%) and consisted of massive lower gastrointestinal bleeding in four patients, blind loop syndrome in three, small bowel obstruction in three, diverticular perforation in two, and chronic abdominal pain requiring jejunal resection in one. In three additional patients with melena and nine with chronic abdominal pain, jejunal diverticulosis was the only abnormality detected; none of these patients had operation. Although the majority of patients with jejunal diverticula do not require surgical treatment, it may be necessitated by complications such as bleeding, perforation, obstruction, blind loop syndrome, or intractable abdominal pain.\r"

Wound histologic changes were studied to understand the mechanism of the interaction between the laser and wound. Single implants of R3230AC mammary tumor were grown to an average diameter of 24 millimeters in the mammary ridge of 80 female fisher 344 rats. Rats were anesthesized with pentobarbital and randomized into groups, each with similar tumor size: scalpel (S), laser (L), laser with wound sterilization (LV), scalpel with sterilization (SV) and electrocautery (E). All surgical procedures were performed by the same surgeon with the same technique, with the exception of the instruments used. Tow rats from each group were sacrificed immediately and the wounds examined histologically. The Sharplan 1100 CO2 laser was used with a 125 millimeter hand piece in focus and in continuous wave for groups L and LV. Sterilization in groups LV and SV was performed with 5 millimeter spot size by heating the site gently without causing blanching of tissue. Excision in group E was performed with coagulating current from a monopolar cautery (Valley Lab). Rats were examined periodically for 30 days and those dying during this period were excluded from analysis. The incidence of wound recurrence was eight of 12 in group S; five of eight, L; four of 13, E; three of 12, LV, and two of nine, SV (p less than 0 .05). Histologic changes in the wound demonstrated viable tumor in all groups, with fewer areas present in groups E, SV and LV. Local thermal effects and the noncontact nature of the CO2 laser make it an effective adjunct in reducing local tumor recurrence by enhancing the cytoreductive capability of surgical procedures.\r"

Nine normal volunteers were enterally (n=4) or parenterally (n=5) fed a diet sufficient to maintain body weight for seven days prior to a standard challenge of endotoxin. Samples were taken prior to the infusion and hourly thereafter for six hours. Prior to the injection of endotoxin, significant differences were seen in the two feeding groups. Plasma C3a levels, absolute circulating PMN counts and chemotaxis to LTB4 were all significantly (p less than 0.02) elevated in the enterally fed group. Generation of LTB4 was higher in the intravenously fed group at base line than the orally fed group (p less than 0.05). Plasma C3a levels rose in the enterally fed group, but not in the intravenously fed group, at two hours after infusion. Neutrophil counts rose in both feeding groups after endotoxin infusion; but the change in percentage was greater in the enterally fed group than in the intravenously fed group. Chemotaxis to FMLP and ZAS was not different during the study and did not differ between the two feeding can have significant impact on neutrophil function and that parenteral nutrition may impair host responsiveness.\r"

  ".W": "Hyperventilation to extremely low arterial carbon dioxide tension (PaCO2) has been used in the management of persistent pulmonary hypertension in newborn infants. With progressive hypocarbia, cerebral vasoconstriction occurs, raising the concern that extreme hypocarbia may result in cerebral oxygen deprivation. Therefore, I evaluated regulation of the cerebral circulation during acute hypocarbia in 10 newborn lambs. Whole-brain and regional blood flows measured using radioactive microspheres, arterial and venous (sagittal sinus) blood gases, and oxygen contents were measured in each lamb at four arterial carbon dioxide tensions. Whole-brain oxygen delivery, oxygen consumption, and fractional oxygen extraction were calculated. Finally, arterial and venous lactate concentrations were measured to assess cerebral lactate production. Whole-brain blood flow (CBF) decreased in a nonlinear fashion as PaCO2 ranged from 46 to 12 mm Hg [In(CBF) = 0.025(PaCO2) + 3.38; r = 0.70, p less than 0.001]. Similar responses were demonstrated for all regional blood flows examined. Cerebral fractional oxygen extraction (E) increased in a nonlinear fashion [In(1-E) = 0.023(PaCO2)-1.37; r = 0.80, p less than 0.001], and cerebral metabolic rate for oxygen was unchanged with hypocarbia. Cerebral venous lactate concentration increased significantly (3.49 +/- 0.23 vs. 2.01 +/- 0.22 mM, p less than 0.001) during severe hypocarbia (PaCO2 of less than 22 mm Hg), and the arterial-venous lactate concentration difference became negative. These results demonstrate uniform responses of whole-brain and regional blood flows and stable cerebral oxygen consumption during moderate and severe hypocarbia. Although there is evidence for cerebral lactate production during severe hypocarbia, this is not likely to indicate cerebral hypoxia as oxygen consumption does not change.\r"

One means of producing such injury employs a helium-neon laser in the presence of intravascular Evans blue. Since the endothelium-dependent dilations produced by acetylcholine or bradykinin may be initiated by interaction with endothelial surface receptors, it is possible that the light simply inactivates or destroys these receptors. We used calcium ionophore A-23187, another dilating agent known from in vitro studies of large arteries to be endothelium-dependent, which moves calcium into endothelial cells rather than interacting with surface receptors. Our data in 10 mice show that before injury, 10(-5)M A-23187 dilated arterioles to 109 +/- 2% of control diameter. After selective endothelial injury by helium-neon laser, dilation was essentially abolished (101 +/- 1% of baseline diameter; p less than 0.01, Wilcoxon test). Undamaged sites along the arteriole still dilated to A-23187. Our data indicate that the laser must do more than inactivate surface receptors and are the first in vivo microvascular (vessels of less than 100 micron diameter) data showing endothelium dependence of the response to A-23187.\r"

A23187 relaxed these different arterial strips partially precontracted with prostaglandin F2 alpha to a similar extent. Vasopressin produced concentration-dependent relaxation in basilar and posterior communicating arterial strips, whereas middle cerebral arterial strips either contracted or relaxed slightly. Relaxations induced by A23187 and vasopressin were either abolished or converted to contractions by removal of the endothelium. In contrast, the relaxation of cerebral arterial strips to substance P was markedly attenuated but not abolished by endothelium denudation; the remaining relaxation was suppressed by indomethacin. In some cerebral arterial strips with intact endothelium, substance P caused a transient contraction that was reversed to a relaxation by indomethacin or ONO-3708, a prostaglandin antagonist. In arterial strips denuded of endothelium from the same dogs, substance P always produced relaxations. Relaxations of cerebral arterial strips to A23187 and vasopressin appear to be mediated by endothelium-derived relaxing factor. The function of vasopressin receptors in endothelial cells differs markedly in basilar and posterior communicating arteries versus middle cerebral arteries. Substance P-induced relaxations appear to be primarily associated with endothelium-derived relaxing factor and with prostaglandin I2, whereas contractions appear to be mediated by endothelium-derived prostaglandins.\r"

  ".W": "Bladder tumors confined to the mucosa and lamina propria are heterogeneous. Papillary, low-grade (I-II) noninvasive tumors (Ta) may recur frequently, thus subjecting the patient to numerous endoscopic procedures, but these patients infrequently have progression in grade or stage. Treatment need not be overly aggressive. High-grade (III) tumors confined to the mucosa (carcinoma in situ or Ta) or with lamina propria invasion (T1) require not only thorough initial endoscopic resection if possible, but extremely careful monitoring. Intravesical therapy should be seriously considered, as a subsequent tumor might invade the muscle and thus be life threatening. At this writing, there are no conclusive data to indicate which intravesical agent is most appropriate for each circumstance. Randomized trials are in progress. A few statements are possible, however. Thiotepa delays the development of low-grade tumors when used for prophylaxis. Toxicity is low, and the drug is not expensive. Mitomycin C is effective for treatment of residual superficial tumor and when instilled regularly after complete transurethral resection (prophylaxis). Side effects are infrequent (cystitis, dermatitis, rash) and almost never severe. The drug is expensive. Adriamycin appears to be active in the treatment and prophylaxis of superficial tumors, but its precise role has not been defined. Cystitis is common. BCG may be the most effective intravesical agent in the treatment of carcinoma in situ. The frequency and severity of local and systemic side effects vary with the strain but are potentially worse than with the chemotherapeutic agents. Thus, the clinician must carefully consider which patients to treat with BCG.\r"

Recently, these compounds have been applied to treating hypercalcemia of malignancy and painful bone metastases. We have used one of the oral diphosphonates, etidronate disodium, to palliate pain in 12 patients suffering from multiple bone metastases from prostate cancer. All of the patients had progressive metastatic disease following earlier endocrine therapy. Ten of 12 (83%) patients had a positive subjective and clinical response to treatment with oral etidronate disodium. Daily narcotic usage and pain intensity (measured by a zero to 10 pain scale) both decreased significantly on the etidronate protocol. There were no side effects associated with the drug in our patients.\r"

  ".W": "A double-blind randomized study was performed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of flumazenil, a benzodiazepine antagonist. The study comprised 52 patients admitted to an intensive care unit because of suspected pure or mixed benzodiazepine poisoning. The degree of consciousness was assessed according to a modified Glasgow Coma Scale (MGCS), graded from 4 to 20, immediately before and at consecutive intervals after an i.v. injection of flumazenil or placebo. If there were no clear signs of arousal within 5 min after the blind injection, an injection of flumazenil was given in open design. Five minutes after the blind administration of active drug the MGCS score was increased by an average of 7.4 (p less than 0.001) in the flumazenil group. In the placebo group the average MGCS score of 7.8 on admission was not significantly increased by placebo, but 5 min after flumazenil injection it had increased by 7.3 to 15.1 (p less than 0.001). Patients who had ingested both alcohol and benzodiazepines were aroused as promptly and clearly (MGCS +8.8; p less than 0.001) as those who had taken benzodiazepines alone (MGCS +8.4; p less than 0.001). The patients poisoned with a combination of benzodiazepines and other hypnotic drugs responded less, but still highly significantly (MGCS +5.8; p less than 0.001). Flumazenil was well tolerated and the safety of the antidote seems acceptable. It is concluded that flumazenil can facilitate differential diagnosis and that it is an effective tool in the treatment of drug overdosage when benzodiazepines are involved.\r"

  ".W": "In 73 euthyroid male patients with histologically verified alcoholic cirrhosis, thyroid hormones, thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG) and testosterone concentrations (total, non-protein- and non-SHBG-bound) were studied in relation to each other and to the degree of liver dysfunction. Serum concentrations of triiodothyronine (T3) decreased significantly (p less than 0.05) and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) increased with progressing liver dysfunction. Serum concentrations of tetraiodothyronine (T4), TBG and T4/TBG ratio did not correlate significantly with liver function. Serum T3 concentrations correlated significantly (Kendall Tau-beta = -0.33, p = 0.001) with total serum testosterone concentrations, while there was a negative correlation (Kendall Tau-beta = -0.20, p = 0.025) between testosterone and TSH values. No correlation was found between testosterone concentrations and serum levels of TBG. It is proposed that the association between T3 and TSH on one hand and testosterone concentrations on the other reflects a covariation of these variables with liver function. The TBG level was normal in most patients and was not correlated to testosterone concentrations.\r"
