  ".W": "Preoperative selection criteria for hearing conservation surgery in patients with acoustic tumors continues to be unresolved. The level of hearing that is worth saving is still debatable. However, most acoustic tumor surgeons agree that hearing preservation is less likely the larger the tumor. We reviewed the results of 106 middle fossa acoustic tumor removals with attempted hearing preservation. Measurable postoperative hearing remained in 59% of 97 cases analyzed for postoperative hearing results. Tumor size, preoperative auditory brain-stem response, and preoperative electronystagmography were found to be useful in predicting successful postoperative hearing preservation. We found no correlation between the level of preoperative hearing and our ability to preserve measurable postoperative hearing. A new classification system is proposed for reporting hearing results after acoustic tumor surgery. It is based on functional hearing results and we believe it is simpler than previously proposed systems.\r"

We have established an animal model for alpha-difluoromethylornithine-induced hearing loss. The time course for onset and recovery of the hearing loss in animals was similar to that seen in humans. Electrophysiologic and histologic data suggest that the anatomic site of alpha-difluoromethylornithine-induced hearing loss is the organ of Corti. Unlike other drugs with ototoxic effects, the specific enzymatic site of action of alpha-difluoromethylornithine is known, making it a potentially important tool in auditory research.\r"

The food challenges were performed in combination with rhinomanometry. The patients were pretreated with cromolyn or placebo by double-blind crossover schedule, in a daily oral dose of 200 mg (four times), starting 3 days before and continuing up to 3 days after the food ingestion challenge. The 38 patients previously developed 25 immediate, 24 late, and 6 delayed nasal responses to food ingestion challenge. Cromolyn fully prevented 15, significantly decreased 9, and was ineffective in 1 case of immediate nasal response. Of the 24 cases of late response, cromolyn fully prevented 10, significantly decreased 12, and was ineffective in 2. Of the 6 cases of delayed response, 2 cases were decreased significantly by cromolyn, while the other 4 cases were not. The protection effects of oral cromolyn were highly significant for the immediate and late nasal responses and nonsignificant for delayed responses. It can be concluded that cromolyn in a daily oral dose of 200 mg four times prevented the immediate and late nasal responses to ingested food.\r"

At least two monoclonal antibodies directed against each oncoprotein and specific peptide inhibition controls were used for these determinations. Hematopoietic progenitor cells (CD34+) express the highest levels of c-myb and c-myc, whereas c-fos levels in CD34+ progenitor cells are similar to c-fos levels in mature monocytes and granulocytes. Granulocytes are the only hematopoietic cells examined which do not express detectable levels of c-myb and c-myc. The levels of these oncoproteins in these normal, unstimulated BM cell populations were more closely linked to lineage and maturation stage than to the proliferative status of the given population, as determined by either DNA staining or expression of the cell-cycle specific nuclear protein, Ki67. This flow cytometric assay helps in interpreting the significance of oncoprotein levels in leukemia cells by allowing direct comparisons of a leukemia with the phenotypically similar \"normal counterpart control\" cell population in normal BM.\r"

  ".W": "A new variant of von Willebrand disease (vWD) was identified by a new analytic method which characterizes the ability of plasma von Willebrand Factor (vWF) to bind to purified factor VIII (F.VIII). vWF was isolated from small amounts of plasma by immunoadsorption with a selected monoclonal antibody to vWF previously coated onto wells of microtitration plates. Plasma F.VIII was removed from immobilized vWF by washing with 0.4 mol/L CaCl2; purified F.VIII was then added to the well. The amount of bound F.VIII was estimated directly in the wells by a chromogenic assay and immobilized vWF was estimated by an immunologic a pool of normal plasma, ten control individuals, 13 with hemophilia A and five with type I vWD. In all cases, the dose-response curves were linear and the slopes of the regression lines were essentially the same. The method was then applied to investigate the binding of vWF to F.VIII in two vWD patients (sister and brother) who demonstrated significantly lower activity of F.VIII than of vWF. The first patient, with a long history of epistaxis, bruising, and hematomas, showed a slightly prolonged bleeding time (10 minutes); 15% VIII:C and 39% of vWF:Ag and vWFRCo. Her brother, who has a bleeding syndrome but no hematomas, showed similar data (bleeding time 9 minutes, 20% VIII:C, 53% vWF:Ag and vWFRCo). Similar levels of F.VIII were observed in the two propositi by four different methods (one- and two-stage clotting and chromogenic and immunologic assays). Sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) 1.4% agarose gel electrophoresis showed that all multimers of vWF were present in both patients. vWF binding to F.VIII was markedly decreased in the two propositi. The abnormal binding of vWF to F.VIII was not corrected during pregnancy or after infusion of 1-deamino (8-D-arginine) vasopressin despite an increase in vWF levels. The qualitative abnormality of vWF in both patients was associated with a subtle alteration of the multimeric structure by SDS 3% agarose gel electrophoresis in which the two central subbands of the quintuplet of individual oligomers were undetectable or poorly visible. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions demonstrated a single band of 275 Kd in the plasma of both patients, and there was no evidence of a second band corresponding to pro-vWF, the precursor of the mature vWF subunit, suggesting that proteolytic processing of vWF was normal.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

The patient was a 42-year-old hemophiliac with a FVIII coagulant activity of 0.03 U/mL and a FVIII antigen level of 0.8 U/mL. The patient's FVIII was not thrombin activatable to levels seen in normal plasma. Immunoblotting of partially purified FVIII Okayama and normal FVIII showed that thrombin cleavage of the 92 kilodalton (Kd) heavy chain was impaired in the mutant protein. The patient's genomic DNA was amplified using the polymerase chain reaction with two sets of synthetic oligonucleotide primers spanning amino acid residues 319 to 400 and 1630 to 1720. Sequence analysis of the amplified DNA fragments revealed a cytosine to thymine transition, converting an arginine to a cysteine codon at residue 372. No abnormality was found in the FVIII light chain region analyzed. The patient's hemophilic brother and carrier mother revealed the same mutation. We conclude that the pathogenesis of hemophilia A in this patient is probably due to an arginine to cysteine substitution at a thrombin cleavage site in the FVIII heavy chain.\r"

We have examined the location of epitopes on the FVIII protein for inhibitors from hemophilia A and nonhemophilic individuals. The inhibitors were of type I or type II in the kinetics of their inactivation of FVIII. A cDNA clone of human FVIII was used to express defined FVIII protein fragments in Escherichia coli for immunoblotting with inhibitor plasma. An epitope for 18 heavy-chain inhibitors was localized to the aminoterminal 18.3 Kd of the A2 domain. Two of these inhibitors also recognized an epitope located between A1 and A2 domains. Similarly, an epitope for 23 light-chain inhibitors was localized to the C2 domain. Weaker epitopes for 13 of the same inhibitors within the C1 and C2 domains were also observed. Four of the 23 inhibitors in addition bound strongly to the A3 domain. Most inhibitors (22 of 23) were neutralized in vitro only by the FVIII fragments to which they bound on immunoblots; however, one inhibitor that was neutralized by a fragment containing the A1 domain did not bind to it on immunoblots. Conversely, 3 of 3 inhibitors that bound to the A3 domain and 5 of 15 that bound to the A2 domain were not neutralized by the corresponding fragments. The epitope specificity of an inhibitor did not depend on its source or type. Our results show that FVIII inhibitors bind to limited areas within the heavy and light chains of FVIII. Some inhibitor plasmas contain additional antibodies that may not be inhibitory.\r"

Exposure of cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells to cathepsin G and elastase isolated from human PMN at concentrations reached in vivo (100 ng/mL to 10 micrograms/mL) selectively inhibited thrombin-induced prostacyclin production and the thrombin-induced rise in cytosolic free calcium ([Ca++]i) concentration. These proteases also blocked thrombin-induced release of arachidonic acid from prelabeled endothelial cells (EC). In contrast, induction of prostacyclin (PGI2) production by arachidonate, histamine, or the calcium ionophore A23187 was not altered by treatment of EC with these proteases. The effects of the proteases were concentration-dependent, were blocked by serum or serum protease inhibitors, and were reversed when the endothelial cells were further cultured for 24 hours in the absence of the proteases. Elastase, but not cathepsin G, also produced detachment of endothelial cells. Thus, the major leukocyte proteases selectively suppress thrombin-induced prostacyclin production by human vascular endothelial cells and may alter the hemostatic balance at sites of PMN activation.\r"

  ".U": "90001546\r", 
  ".W": "The observation that aspirin inhibits the increment in tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) activity induced by venous occlusion of the forearm became controversial with the publication of several nonconfirmatory studies. The current study was performed to confirm the original observation and determine the mechanism by which aspirin suppresses the incremental t-PA activity induced by venous occlusion. Aspirin (650 mg/d X 2) caused no change in resting levels of t-PA antigen (t-PA:Ag) or activity, plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 antigen (PAI-1:Ag), or activity or t-PA-PAI-1 complexes. In contrast, aspirin reduced the increments induced by venous occlusion as follows: t-PA:Ag by 45% (P = .001); t-PA activity (euglobulin lysis time, ELT) by 43% (P = .006); and t-PA activity (alpha 2-plasmin inhibitor-plasmin complexes, PIPC) by 41% (P = .003). The inhibition of incremental t-PA activity measured as ELT or PIPC was linearly correlated with the inhibition of incremental t-PA:Ag (respectively, r = .75, P less than .02; r = .67, P less than .05). Aspirin had no effect on the increment in PAI-1:Ag induced by venous occlusion, but similar to the effect on t-PA:Ag, aspirin induced a 51% inhibition of the increment in t-PA-PAI-1 complex formation. Aspirin did not alter the ability of alpha 2-plasmin inhibitor to bind plasmin, nor the ability of plasma to support the fibrin-catalyzed generation of plasmin by t-PA, nor the subsequent formation of PIPC. Aspirin inhibits the t-PA activity induced by venous occlusion primarily by inhibiting the release of t-PA antigen.\r"

  ".W": "T cells recovering after bone marrow transplantation (BMT) were analyzed for their phenotypic and functional features by two-color immunofluorescence and a high efficiency cloning technique. A predominance of cells co-expressing natural killer (NK)-related surface antigens, such as Leu 7 (CD57) and CD11b, was detected within both the CD4+ and CD8+ subsets from 5 months postgrafting onward. Such cells are virtually absent among normal circulating CD4+ cells and account for a minority (approximately 30%) of normal CD8+ cells. Postgrafting T cells representative of the whole range of NK-related antigen co-expression were selected from six patients for clonal analyses. In control subjects, 63% and 41% of the CD4+ and CD8+ clones, respectively, produced interleukin-2 (IL-2) whereas approximately 30% of either CD4+ or CD8+ control clones produced interferon (IFN)-gamma. At variance, and irrespective of their CD4+/CD8+ phenotype, lower proportions of BMT recipient-derived clones produced IL-2 (20% and 12%, respectively), whereas the majority of both CD4+ and CD8+ clones (75% and 71%, respectively) released high amounts of IFN-gamma. Purified populations of CD57+/CD11b+ v negative cells from two BMT recipients and two control subjects were cloned and subsequently evaluated for IL-2 and IFN-gamma production. CD57+/CD11b+ cell-derived clones were poor IL-2 producers in both normal subjects and BMT patients. In contrast, IL-2-producing clones were frequent (62% to 79%) among those derived from CD57-/CD11b- cells from normal subjects, whereas they were still represented at lower than normal proportions, ie, 25% to 41%, among clones generated from BMT recipients. CD57+/CD11b+ cells gave rise to comparably high proportions of IFN-gamma producing clones in both normal subjects and BMT recipients (approximately 80%). In contrast, IFN-gamma producing clones were approximately 25% to 50% of CD57-/CD11b- cell-derived clones in both normal subjects and BMT patients. Therefore, while the predominance of NK-related antigen-positive T cells may be predictive of poor IL-2 and high IFN-gamma production, the immune derangement in long-term BMT recipients is further enhanced by the finding that all T cells may be poor IL-2 producers. It is also suggested that IL-2 production is a preferential function of T cells that do not express CD57 and CD11b, whereas IFN-gamma production is attributable to T cells that express CD57 and CD11b.\r"

  ".W": "Peripheral blood cells from nine patients with B-chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) were treated in vitro with bryostatin 1 (a macrocyclic lactone derived from a marine invertebrate). Like the phorbol ester 12-0-tetradecanoyl-phorbol 13-acetate (TPA), bryostatin 1 activates protein kinase C (PKC), which plays a central role in the phosphatidylinositol signal transduction pathway. The effects of bryostatin 1 alone and in combination with TPA or with the calcium mobilizing ionophore A23187 were assessed by morphological appearance, cell adherence and aggregation, RNA and DNA synthesis, and immunoglobulin (Ig) production. While eight of nine B-CLL cultures remained proliferatively inert, bryostatin 1 could effectively trigger activation and differentiation of B-CLL cells in all cases as inferred by the induction of morphological changes, RNA synthesis, and monotypic Ig production. Addition of calcium ionophore A23187 to bryostatin 1-exposed cells resulted in significantly increased values for RNA synthesis and Ig production and in the acquisition of plasmacytoid morphology. Bryostatin 1 and the dual signal of bryostatin 1 plus A23187 mimicked the stimulatory action of TPA and the combination of TPA plus A23187, respectively. Overall, bryostatin 1 was less active than equivalent concentrations of TPA. This lesser efficacy may, however, reflect a quantitative rather than qualitative difference. Bryostatin 1 partially antagonized TPA-mediated effects on B-CLL cells suggesting different modes of action by the two activators. These studies indicate that bryostatin 1 has effective differentiation-inducing properties on B-CLL cells that can differentiation-inducing properties on B-CLL cells that can be accentuated by a calcium ionophore.\r"

The exact localization of SRC is important for understanding the del(20q) chromosomal abnormality in myeloid neoplasias.

  ".W": "Leukemias and lymphomas can now be classified according to the particular immunoglobulin, T-cell receptor, or growth-affecting genes they are expressing. Recognition of the structural alterations of lymphoid DNA has been used to identify neoplasms of previously uncertain lineage, to aid in diagnosis, and to define the state of differentiation of the neoplasm. We have developed a procedurally simple, rapid turnaround technique for using tumor-specific gene alterations as tumor-specific markers. Probes can be constructed that will recognize only the gene expressed in the tumor and not those in any of the normal cells when used with tissue in situ hybridization. We demonstrate the application of direct sequencing of a specific gene of interest from total RNA from a patient with multiple myeloma. A probe is then generated from this sequence and applied directly to patient material.\r"

  ".W": "The identification of recurring chromosomal translocations has provided clues to the gene regions important in lymphoma development. Among 157 patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma studied by cytogenetic analysis, four new recurring translocations have been identified--t(8;9) (q24;p13), t(11;18)(q21;q21), t(14,15)(q32;q15), and an unbalanced translocation giving rise to der(22)t(17;22) (q11;p11). Each translocation appeared twice. The t(11;18) was the only karyotypic abnormality in the two patients with it, and the t(14;15) was the sole karyotypic abnormality in one patient. All translocations were found in B-cell malignancies and were associated with both nodal and extranodal disease. Among the regions affected, only the immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene MYC, and BCL2, have thus far been associated with lymphoma. The breakpoint sites identified by these translocations warrant further investigation at the molecular level.\r"

  ".U": "90001571\r", 
  ".W": "A prototypic \"immediate early\" gene, c-fos, has been extensively investigated in relation to the differentiation and activation of myelomonocytic cells. The c-fos gene product is associated in transcriptional complexes with the c-jun product. These protooncogenes are part of the regulatory network of gene expression. The present study was designed to investigate expression of the c-jun protooncogene in human circulating myelomonocytic cells. We found that c-jun is constitutively expressed in normal monocytes and granulocytes, whereas low levels of transcripts are found in lymphocytes. Acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) samples of French-American-British Cooperative Group (FAB) subtypes 1 through 4 express appreciable levels of this protooncogene. Normal phytohemagglutinin (PHA)-activated lymphocytes express high levels of c-jun. Expression in normal myelomonocytic cells is detectable even after 18 hours of culture. The c-jun transcripts in myelomonocytic cells have a half-life of approximately 20 minutes and are superinduced by cycloheximide, which affects both the degradation rate of mRNA and the transcriptional activity of the c-jun gene. Functional activation of monocytes and granulocytes with phorbol esters, lipopolysaccharide, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) increase c-jun expression. This induction is rapid, transient, and does not require intervening protein synthesis. Runoff experiments showed that in freshly isolated untreated monocytes, the c-jun gene is constitutively transcribed, and that induction by lipopolysaccharide is at least in part at the transcriptional level. Moreover, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment reduced the degradation rate of c-jun transcripts, prolonging the half-life to approximately two hours. Expression of c-jun in resting and activated monocytes and granulocytes suggests that this protooncogene may play a role in the differentiation and activation of cells belonging to the myelomonocytic lineage.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To compare computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging in investigating patients suspected of having a lesion in the posterior cranial fossa. DESIGN--Randomised allocation of newly referred patients to undergo either computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging; the alternative investigation was performed subsequently only in response to a request from the referring doctor. SETTING--A regional neuroscience centre serving 2.7 million. PATIENTS--1020 Patients recruited between April 1986 and December 1987, all suspected by neurologists, neurosurgeons, or other specialists of having a lesion in the posterior fossa and referred for neuroradiology. The groups allocated to undergo computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging were well matched in distributions of age, sex, specialty of referring doctor, investigation as an inpatient or an outpatient, suspected site of lesion, and presumed disease process; the referring doctor's confidence in the initial clinical diagnosis was also similar. INTERVENTIONS--After the patients had been imaged by either computed tomography or magnetic resonance (using a resistive magnet of 0.15 T) doctors were given the radiologist's report and a form asking if they considered that imaging with the alternative technique was necessary and, if so, why; it also asked for their current diagnoses and their confidence in them. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Number of requests for the alternative method of investigation. Assessment of characteristics of patients for whom further imaging was requested and lesions that were suspected initially and how the results of the second imaging affected clinicians' and radiologists' opinions. RESULTS--Ninety three of the 501 patients who initially underwent computed tomography were referred subsequently for magnetic resonance imaging whereas only 28 of the 493 patients who initially underwent magnetic resonance imaging were referred subsequently for computed tomography. Over the study the number of patients referred for magnetic resonance imaging after computed tomography increased but requests for computed tomography after magnetic resonance imaging decreased. The reason that clinicians gave most commonly for requesting further imaging by magnetic resonance was that the results of the initial computed tomography failed to exclude their suspected diagnosis (64 patients). This was less common in patients investigated initially by magnetic resonance imaging (eight patients). Management of 28 patients (6%) imaged initially with computed tomography and 12 patients (2%) imaged initially with magnetic resonance was changed on the basis of the results of the alternative imaging. CONCLUSIONS--Magnetic resonance imaging provided doctors with the information required to manage patients suspected of having a lesion in the posterior fossa more commonly than computed tomography, but computed tomography alone was satisfactory in 80% of cases...\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To examine associations between reported respiratory symptoms (as elicited by questionnaire) and subsequent mortality. DESIGN--Prospective cohort study. SETTING--92 General practices in Great Britain. PARTICIPANTS--A nationally representative sample of 1532 British men and women aged between 40 and 64. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Mortality from all causes, cardiovascular disease, lung cancer, and chronic bronchitis. RESULTS--Subjects were interviewed in 1958 regarding various respiratory symptoms (including cough, phlegm, breathlessness, and wheeze) by using a questionnaire which formed the basis of the Medical Research Council's questionnaire on respiratory symptoms. By the end of 1985, 889 deaths had been reported, including 51 in men due to chronic bronchitis. After adjustment for differences in age and smoking habits death rates from chronic bronchitis in men who reported symptoms were greater than those in men who did not for each of the symptoms examined. The adjusted mortality ratios were 3.4 (95% confidence interval 1.8 to 6.5) for morning cough, 3.7 (2.0 to 6.9) for morning phlegm, 6.4 (3.0 to 13.8) for breathlessness when walking on the level, and 10.5 (4.4 to 24.6) for wheeze most days or nights. Mortality ratios were also significantly raised for four episodic symptoms not usually included in more recent respiratory symptom questionnaires--namely, occasional wheeze (mortality ratio 6.0; 95% confidence interval, 2.4 to 15.1), weather affects chest (5.7; 3.1 to 10.3), breathing different in summer (4.9; 2.8 to 8.6), and cold usually goes to chest (3.7; 2.0 to 6.8). The excess mortality associated with these symptoms remained significant after further adjustment for breathlessness or phlegm. Ratios for all cause mortality in men and women were also significantly raised for most respiratory symptoms, death rates being some 20-50% higher in people reporting symptoms after adjustment for age, sex, and smoking. Breathlessness was the only symptom significantly associated with excess mortality from cardiovascular disease (mortality ratio 1.4 (95% confidence interval 1.0 to 1.9) for breathlessness when walking on the level). Ratios were generally around unity and not significant for mortality due to lung cancer. CONCLUSIONS--The results suggest that episodic symptoms, which often do not appear in standard respiratory questionnaires, predict subsequent mortality from chronic obstructive airways disease. This supports the hypothesis that reversible airflow obstruction may be a precursor of progressive and irreversible decline in ventilatory function.\r"

  ".U": "90001730\r", 
  ".W": "The use of local hyperthermia to treat cancer of the internal organs has been limited by the difficulty of controlling delivery of heat and limiting the effects to the tumour, but this can be overcome by using laser light transmitted through thin flexible fibres. Laser energy was delivered to tumours through fibres inserted percutaneously through needles directly into the centre of the tumour area. Ultrasound scanning was used to locate the tumour, position the fibres correctly within the tumour, and monitor the development of thermal necrosis in real time during laser exposure and through the subsequent period of healing. Five patients were treated (one with a tumour of the breast, one with a subcutaneous secondary tumour, one with a recurrent pancreatic tumour, and two with secondary tumours in the liver). Tumour necrosis was found on ultrasonography or computed tomography in all, and there were no immediate or delayed complications. In one patient the size of the isolated secondary tumour in the liver had not increased over 10 months, and he subsequently showed no other evidence of residual cancer. To develop this technique careful studies are essential to ensure that in every case the extent of thermal necrosis produced by absorption of the laser light can be matched to the full extent of the tumour being treated and that there is always sufficient adjacent normal tissue to ensure safe healing. These preliminary results suggest that this simple technique can be applied safely and effectively to common tumours in humans; more extensive trials in a range of cancers of solid organs are warranted.\r"

The statistics on workload were reviewed for 1987 and 1988. An overall rate of face to face consultations of 4.1 per patient per year was recorded, there being 115,965 consultations over two years for a mean list size of 14,174 patients. Four per cent (4737) of such consultations were outside normal working hours. The annual rate of visiting outside normal hours was 128.1 per 1000 patients in 1987 (1793 visits) and 131.5 per 1000 in 1988 (1888 visits). The rates of night visiting were 18.8 (262 visits) and 18.9 (271 visits) per 1000 patients in 1987 and 1988 respectively. Only 24% of all the requests for medical help out of hours (1483/6220) were dealt with by advice given on the telephone. The high rates of consultation outside normal working hours with only a small proportion being dealt with on the telephone alone may be explained by indices of deprivation. Local rotas for out of hours work are a good compromise between meeting the needs of patients and doctors in deprived areas, but there are financial implications for inner cities.\r"

Ectopic pregnancy, ovarian and non-ovarian cysts, pelvic adhesions, endometriosis, and fibroids were found, for which salpingotomy, salpingectomy and salpingo-oophorectomy, cystectomy, adhesiolysis, thermocoagulation, and myomectomy were carried out by laparoscopy. In one patient pelviscopy was repeated because of persistent tubal pregnancy after the fimbria was expressed. Laparotomies were carried out on three patients because treatment was not possible by laparoscopy and on a further patient two days after adhesiolysis had been attempted. These were the only serious complications. For the 46 cases (45 patients) in which operative laparoscopy was successful the mean stay in hospital was 1.9 days after operation, and this group of patients returned to normal activities and to work after an average of 2.3 and 2.6 weeks respectively. Most gynaecological emergencies that are managed by laparotomy can be treated by laparoscopy and benefit both patients and the health service.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To determine the courses of absorption and the interindividual and intraindividual variations in absorption of iodine-125 labelled Ultratard HM and NovoSol Basal injected subcutaneously. DESIGN--Open randomised crossover study. Each patient was tested during two study periods of five days each, during which he or she received a subcutaneous injection of either 125I-NovoSol Basal or 125I-Ultratard HM on four consecutive days. The aim was to detect a reduction in intraindividual standard deviation by a factor of two with a probability 0.95, taking 0.05 as the level of significance. This required 24 degrees of freedom and led to the choice of four courses in each of eight patients. SETTING--Referrals to the diabetes research centre in Hvidore, Copenhagen. PATIENTS--Eight insulin dependent (type I) diabetics with low or undetectable C peptide concentrations who were receiving a multiple insulin injection regimen. One patient withdrew immediately after recruitment. INTERVENTIONS--After an overnight fast patients received 96 nmol (16 IU insulin) of either 125I-NovoSol Basal or 125I-Ultratard HM injected subcutaneously into the thigh. To ensure that the insulin entered the subcutaneous fat at the same depth, ultrasonography was performed on each patient before the first injection. A different injection site on the thigh was used each day for four days in order to facilitate monitoring of the disappearance of four different depots in each patient. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE--Residual activity at the injection site was measured roughly every two hours throughout the day. No radioactivity measurements were performed overnight (10 pm till 8 am). The residual radioactivity after the injection on the first day (upper right thigh) was recorded for five days, that after the injection on the second day (upper left thigh) for four days, after the injection on the third day (lower right thigh) for three days, and after the last injection (lower left thigh) for two days. RESULTS--NovoSol Basal was absorbed according to first order kinetics with a mean t50% of 35.3 (SEM 1.4) hours; Ultratard HM was absorbed after a lag phase and the corresponding t50% was 25.5 (2.5) hours. The intraindividual variations in t50% were significantly smaller with NovoSol Basal than with Ultratard HM (18.4% v 44.5%; p less than 0.001). Interindividual variations, however, were not significantly different (25.2% v 36.9%; p = 0.38). The total variation in t50% was substantially smaller with NovoSol Basal than with Ultratard HM (20.3% v 42.8%). CONCLUSIONS--NovoSol Basal seems to be an appreciable advance over Ultratard HM as a soluble insulin preparation for obtaining reproducible 24 hour insulin concentrations in the blood\r"

Subacute and even chronic cases occur, and in these patients the presentation is varied and often insidious, leading to delay in diagnosis. Twenty two such patients (13 women and nine men) with a mean age of 44 years were seen in our connective tissue disease clinic. The mean duration of symptoms before diagnosis was 3.6 years and the mean duration of disease 5.9 years (19 years in one patient). All patients had malaise and ear, nose, and throat symptoms, and most had joint pains. Impaired renal function was seen in seven patients only. Tissue biopsy was diagnostic in half of the patients, and appreciably high titres of antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies were detected in only nine of 18 patients in whom these were measured. The most useful investigations were neutrophil counts, chest radiographs, and computed tomography of the sinuses and orbits. The most effective treatment was with intravenous pulses of cyclophosphamide. No deaths occurred. At the time of writing two patients were in remission and no longer being treated and 18 patients were in partial remission on continued treatment. Patients with subacute forms of Wegener's granulomatosis present with a variety of clinical features and the insidious presentation often leads to delay in diagnosis. A history of ear, nose, and throat symptoms was universal in our patients.\r"

DESIGN--Prospective study of cohort from general population first screened between 1972 and 1976 and followed up for an average of 11.5 years, with linkage of data from participants in the same household. SETTING--Renfrew and Paisely, adjacent burghs in urban west Scotland. SUBJECTS--15,399 Men and women (80% of all those aged 45-64 resident in Renfrew or Paisley) comprised the original cohort; 7997 attended for multiphasic screening with a cohabitee. Passive smoking and control groups were defined on the basis of a lifelong non-smoking index case and whether the cohabitee had ever smoked or never smoked. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE--Cardiorespiratory signs and symptoms and mortality. RESULTS--Each of the cardiorespiratory symptoms examined produced relative risks greater than 1.0 (though none were significant) for passive smokers compared with controls. Adjusted forced expiratory volume in one second was significantly lower in passive smokers than controls. All cause mortality was higher in passive smokers than controls (rate ratio 1.27 (95% confidence interval 0.95 to 1.70)), as were all causes of death related to smoking (rate ratio 1.30 (0.91 to 1.85] and mortality from lung cancer (rate ratio 2.41 (0.45 to 12.83)) and ischaemic heart disease (rate ratio 2.01 (1.21 to 3.35)). When passive smokers were divided into high and low exposure groups on the basis of the amount smoked by their cohabitees those highly exposed had higher rates of symptoms and death. CONCLUSION--Exposure to environmental tobacco smoke cannot be regarded as a safe involuntary habit.\r"

DESIGN--Coded analysis of serum samples taken from patients with carefully defined alcohol intake both with and without liver disease. Comparison of carbohydrate deficient transferrin with standard laboratory tests for alcohol abuse. SETTING--A teaching hospital unit with an interest in general medicine and liver disease. PATIENTS--22 \"Self confessed\" alcoholics admitting to a daily alcohol intake of at least 80 g for a minimum of three weeks; 15 of the 22 self confessed alcoholics admitted to hospital for alcohol withdrawal; 68 patients with alcoholic liver disease confirmed by biopsy attending outpatient clinics and claiming to be drinking less than 50 g alcohol daily; 47 patients with non-alcoholic liver disorders confirmed by biopsy; and 38 patients with disorders other than of the liver and no evidence of excessive alcohol consumption. INTERVENTION--Serial studies performed on the 15 patients undergoing alcohol withdrawal in hospital. MAIN OUTCOME measure--Determination of relative value of techniques for detecting alcohol abuse. RESULTS--Carbohydrate deficient transferrin was detected in 19 of the 22 (86%) self confessed alcohol abusers, none of the 47 patients with non-alcoholic liver disease, and one of the 38 (3%) controls. Withdrawal of alcohol led to the disappearance of carbohydrate deficient transferrin at a variable rate, though in some subjects it remained detectable for up to 15 days. Carbohydrate deficient transferrin was considerably superior to the currently available conventional markers for alcohol abuse. CONCLUSION--As the technique is fairly simple, sensitive, and inexpensive we suggest that it may be valuable in detecting alcohol abuse.\r"

Key findings were that 193 of those who responded had an electrocardiograph, 206 had a kit for minor operations, 119 owned a computer, and less than one third owned a microscope. Most of these practices were high investors. There seems to be a shift away from some traditional instruments towards expensive information technology. Government policies are encouraging the use of computers and such equipment, though funds are not necessarily being made available for this purpose.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To identify the main delay in the provision of hearing aids for people with impaired hearing and identify possible problems and short-comings caused by a community based hearing aid dispensing service. DESIGN--Prospective cohort analysis based on data collected from patients on the duration of hearing impairment, from the referral letters in respect of the general practitioners' findings on otoscopy, and from the ear, nose, and throat assessment in the clinic with respect to the outcome of specialist otoscopy and management of the hearing impairment. SETTING--General ear, nose, and throat outpatient clinic. PATIENTS--100 Consecutive patients aged 19-94 referred by general practitioners for the provision of hearing aids or for assessment and treatment of impaired hearing. RESULTS--Most patients with impaired hearing did not seek medical advice for at least a year. The time from referral by the general practitioner to the provision of a hearing aid was under two months. General practitioners consistently recognised normality on otoscopy but failed to recognise abnormality in eight of 45 cases. Seven patients required further investigation to exclude serious disease and nine had conditions amenable to surgery. CONCLUSIONS--The main cause of delay in treating impaired hearing is failure by patients to seek help promptly. Specialist assessment of patients with impaired hearing is preferable and does not necessarily cause delay in providing hearing aids. The provision of hearing aids should remain a hospital based service.\r"

DESIGN--Double blind, placebo controlled, randomised group comparison. SETTING--Outpatient clinic for research into osteoporosis. SUBJECTS--52 Healthy women who had had a natural menopause two and a half to five years previously. INTERVENTIONS--The 52 women were allocated randomly to two years of treatment with either salcatonin 100IU given intranasally (n = 26) or placebo (n = 26). Both groups received a calcium supplement of 500 mg daily. Seven of the women receiving salcatonin and six of those receiving placebo left the study before its end. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Bone mineral content in the spine, the total skeleton, and the forearms after two years of treatment. RESULTS--Bone mineral content in the spine was significantly higher in the women who had received salcatonin than in those who had received placebo both after one year and after two years of treatment. After one year the difference was 3.8% (95% confidence interval 0.0 to 7.6%) and after two years it was 8.2% (3.8 to 12.6%). In contrast, the bone mineral content in the distal and proximal forearms and in the total skeleton declined similarly in both groups by about 2% each year, and after two years of treatment the differences between the groups were not significant. Biochemical estimates of bone turnover were not affected by salcatonin. CONCLUSION--The results suggest that salcatonin given intranasally in the dose used prevents bone loss in the spine of early post menopausal women but does not affect the peripheral skeleton.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To determine whether dietary treatment has a similar antihypertensive effect to conventional drug treatment while being superior to drugs in improving serum lipid concentrations in obese men with mild hypertension. DESIGN--Six week run in period followed by randomisation to either diet or drug treatment groups for one year. SETTING--Outpatient clinic in city hospital. PATIENTS--61 Men aged 40-69 years, body mass index greater than or equal to 26, diastolic blood pressure 90-104 mm Hg when untreated. Exclusion criteria were signs of organ damage secondary to hypertension and diseases that might have interfered with compliance or with interpretation of results. INTERVENTIONS--Dietary treatment was based on weight reduction, restriction of sodium, and decrease of excess alcohol intake (defined as greater than or equal to 250 g alcohol per week). Drug treatment used a stepped care approach with atenolol as drug of first choice. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Diastolic blood pressure less than 90 mm Hg; absolute reductions in blood pressure and serum lipid concentrations. RESULTS--Mean body weight decreased 7.6 kg in the diet group and increased 0.9 kg in the drug treatment group (p less than 0.0001), and mean sodium excretion decreased 42 and 10 mmol/24 h respectively (p = 0.019). There was no difference in reported alcohol intake. Mean systolic blood pressure decreased 4 mm Hg in the diet group and 16 mm Hg in the drug group (p = 0.003) and diastolic blood pressure 3 and 11 mm Hg respectively (p = 0.002). Diastolic blood pressure of 90 mm Hg was attained by 29% of the diet group (nine men) and 73% (22) of those receiving drug treatment (mean difference 44%, 95% confidence interval 21 to 67%, p = 0.001). Dietary treatment produced decreases in mean serum concentrations of total and low density lipoprotein cholesterol as well as triglycerides and an increase in high density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration. In the drug treatment group the changes were in the opposite direction, and the groups differed significantly in all but total cholesterol. CONCLUSIONS--Dietary treatment was inferior to conventional drug treatment in controlling mild hypertension but superior in lowering serum concentrations of lipids.\r"

SETTING--Regional neurosurgical unit at a tertiary referral centre. PATIENTS--100 Patients with subarachnoid haemorrhage; 17 were lost during the study because of ineligibility (further surgery, previous head injury, relevant psychiatric history, and cultural differences), loss of contact, and non-compliance; a further 13 patients who developed a neurological deficit were considered separately. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE--Performance on cognitive test battery and reported changes in quality of life. RESULTS--At discharge patients with and without neurological deficit scored below established norms with most tests, but by three months the difference had resolved in patients without deficit. Reduced quality of life attributable to subarachnoid haemorrhage at one year mainly included less energy (seven patients), adverse emotional changes (five), early retirement, affected social life, and domestic tension (three each). None reported reduced capacity for work. CONCLUSIONS--Patients surviving subarachnoid haemorrhage without neurological symptoms have a good prognosis and should be encouraged to return to a normal lifestyle within about three months.\r"

Resting metabolic rate and thermogenesis induced by adrenaline were measured in five healthy children and 14 children with type I diabetes who were all free of clinical signs of late complications of diabetes mellitus but differed in their degree of glycaemic control (in eight glycated haemoglobin concentration was less than 10% and in the six others greater than or equal to 10%). When compared with the control subjects children with type I diabetes had normal resting metabolic rates but their urinary nitrogen excretion was significantly raised (11.5 (SD 5.4) mg/min in those with glycated haemoglobin concentration less than 10%, 11.6 (5.2) mg/min in those with concentration greater than or equal to 10% v 5.4 (3.0) mg/min in control subjects). During the infusion of adrenaline the diabetic children showed a threefold and sustained increase in thermogenesis and disproportionate increases in the work done by the heart, in lipid oxidation rate, and in plasma concentrations of glucose, free fatty acids, and ketone bodies. The increased thermogenic effect of adrenaline did not correlate with the degree of glycaemic control. Increased thermogenesis may explain the tissue wasting commonly seen in children with type I diabetes during intercurrent stress.\r"

A total of 711 patients in a semirural group practice evaluated the importance of 20 criteria describing different facets of care. Half the criteria were derived from Promoting Better Health (health education, easy to change doctors, all children vaccinated, health checks for adults and children under 5, regular screening for cancer, woman doctor available, doctor goes on courses, well decorated premises, convenient surgery times); the other 10 were taken from a preliminary interview study of 24 patients (staff friendly and know me, doctor listens and sorts out problems, same doctor for consultations, nurse on premises, appointments available within 48 hours, waiting time less than 20 minutes, small surgery premises, tests available at surgery). Questionnaires containing 10 pairs of criteria assigned by computer were drawn up and patients asked to give their preference in each pair. The number of times each criterion was preferred was scored and its comparative importance ranked. The three criteria most highly ranked by all patients were having a doctor who listens, having a doctor who sorts out problems, and usually seeing the same doctor (all criteria originated by patients). The three least highly valued were health education, being able to change doctor easily, and well decorated and convenient premises (all criteria originated by the government). The criteria originated by patients as a group scored significantly more highly than those originated by government as a group. In a more competitive general practice environment, in which doctors will be more inclined to satisfy the wishes of patients, officially supported indicators of good quality care might not get the encouragement that the government and doctors think that they deserve.\r"

In an analysis to find ways of measuring the design and effectiveness of hospital audit, therefore, seven main measures emerged that might serve as practical criteria. These were the definition of medical and managerial responsibilities; medical organisation; scope of audit; essential characteristics; resources needed; record keeping; and evaluation. Though generally consistent with the proposals of the government and the Department of Health, these seven principles offer some alternative approaches.\r"

DESIGN--Open, randomised follow up study of normotensive insulin dependent diabetics with nephropathy either treated or not with captopril for one year. SETTING--Outpatient diabetic clinic in a tertiary referral centre. PATIENTS--32 Normotensive patients with insulin dependent diabetes complicated by nephropathy who were randomised either to the treatment group (n = 15) or to the control group (n = 17). INTERVENTIONS--The treatment group was given captopril (25-100 mg/day) for 12 months, the average dose during the second six months of the study being 40 mg daily. Controls were not treated. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Albuminuria, arterial blood pressure, and the glomerular filtration rate. RESULTS--Mean arterial blood pressure fell by 3 (SE 2) mm Hg in the captopril treated group and rose by 6 (1) mm Hg in the controls. In addition, albuminuria declined by 11% in the captopril treated group and rose by 55% in the controls, fractional albumin clearance fell by 17% in the captopril treated group and increased by 66% in the controls, and the glomerular filtration rate declined by 3.1 (2.8)ml/min/1.73 m2 with captopril and by 6.4 (3.1) ml/min/1.73 m2 in the controls. CONCLUSION--Inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme arrests the progressive rise in albuminuria in normotensive insulin dependent diabetics with nephropathy.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To examine the role of insulin as a cardiovascular risk factor in British Asian and white men. DESIGN--Case-controlled study of survivors of first myocardial infarction. SETTING--District general hospital. PATIENTS--Consecutive series of 76 white and 74 Asian men who survived first myocardial infarction compared with 58 white and 61 Asian male controls without coronary artery disease who were randomly sampled from the community. RESULTS--More Asians than white subjects had impaired glucose tolerance or overt diabetes as measured by the two hour glucose tolerance test (23/74 (32%) v 11/76 (15%) (p less than 0.001) among patients; 17/61 (28%) v 3/58 (6%) (p less than 0.001) among controls). Insulin and C peptide concentrations were higher in both patient groups than in respective controls (p less than 0.001) and higher in Asian than in white subjects, irrespective of their glucose tolerance. Triglyceride concentrations were higher in patients than in controls (1.92 (SD 1.05) v 1.43 (0.82) mmol/l among Asian men; 1.65 (0.83) v 1.3 (0.61) mmol/l among white subjects; p less than 0.001). Total cholesterol concentrations were lower in both groups of Asians than in respective white subjects (5.78 (0.99) v 6.22 (1.04) mmol/l (p less than 0.01) among patients; 5.54 (1.01) v 5.65 (1.11) mmol/l (p less than 0.6) among controls). High density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations were lower in Asian than in white subjects. The ratio of total cholesterol to high density lipoprotein cholesterol was significantly higher (p less than 0.001) in both patient groups (6.69 (1.81) in Asian patients and 6.31 (1.91) in white patients) than in respective controls (5.24 (1.19) and 4.77 (1.43)). Regression analysis identified C peptide concentration and the ratio of total to high density lipoprotein cholesterol as powerful independent predictors of myocardial infarction in Asian and white men. Total cholesterol concentration predicted infarction in white but not in Asian men. CONCLUSIONS--Secretion and hepatic extraction of insulin are high in survivors of myocardial infarction and especially high in British Asians. Tissue resistance to the action of insulin, giving rise to increased pancreatic secretion, may be an important risk factor for coronary artery disease in both ethnic groups and may be partly responsible for the high incidence of diabetes and coronary artery disease in Asian populations.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To investigate the incidence of spontaneous abortion in a population of women in order to establish their risk of spontaneous abortion and the obstetric factors predisposing to it. DESIGN--Prospective study of women recruited by radio and poster appeal and from hospital outpatient clinics. SETTING--English provincial community. PATIENTS--630 Women from the general population intending to become pregnant. INTERVENTIONS--The viability of the pregnancy was assessed by abdominal ultrasonography before completion of the eighth week, and the assessment was repeated if vaginal bleeding occurred. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE--Spontaneous abortion or live births in women with or without a previous history of spontaneous abortion. RESULTS--The overall incidence of clinically recognisable spontaneous abortion before 20 weeks of gestation was 12% (50/407 pregnancies). The risk of spontaneous abortion in each category of patient was classified with respect to the patient's past reproductive performance and found to be influenced greatly by her previous obstetric history. In primigravidas and women with a history of consistently successful pregnancies the incidences of abortion were low (5% (4/87) and 4% (3/73) respectively), whereas women with only unsuccessful histories had a much greater risk of aborting the study pregnancy (24% (24/98)), even when their sole pregnancy had ended in abortion (20% (12/59)). The outcome of the last pregnancy also influenced the outcome of the study pregnancy; only 5% of women (5/95) whose previous pregnancy had been successful aborted, whereas the incidence of loss of pregnancy among women whose last pregnancy had aborted was 19% (40/214). CONCLUSIONS--A knowledge of the patient's reproductive history is essential for the clinical assessment of her risk of spontaneous abortion. As the most important predictive factor for spontaneous abortion is a previous abortion, the outcome of a woman's first pregnancy has profound consequences for all subsequent pregnancies.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To determine the effectiveness of an existing screening programme based in the community for ocular and vision defects in infants considered at increased risk of such defects. DESIGN--Children with ocular or vision defect by the age of 2 were ascertained by searching records. Those from populations at high risk were matched with their results from screening tests. The characteristics of the cases among this population were compared with those of the cases in the remainder of the population. Patterns of referral and age at referral were studied in both groups. SETTING--The study was conducted within Oxfordshire Health District. SUBJECTS--433 Children at high risk born in 1984 to mothers living in the health district at delivery and who either weighed less than 2000 g or weighed 2000 g and over and required admission to a special care nursery for longer than 24 hours. The low risk population (6254) were infants without these characteristics who were resident in the health district at the time of referral. INTERVENTIONS--Screening tests for vision or ocular defects already routinely used were applied by health visitors at 8 and 18 months to the children at high risk. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE--Comparison of results of screening tests with vision and ocular defects detected by the age of 2. RESULTS--Screening tests in current use for vision loss and squint in this age group were insensitive and had a low positive predictive value when applied to a high risk population. Defects that were not apparent on direct inspection were unlikely to be detected by these tests. In the high risk group the relative risk of having a defect was 2.8 (95% confidence interval 1.8 to 4.5) but 85% of all cases detected by the age of 2 were in children at low risk. Referral patterns and age of referral differed in the two groups. CONCLUSIONS--Screening by health visitors of high risk populations contributes little to the detection of vision and ocular defects. This type of evaluation needs to be applied also to low risk populations, who have different referral patterns and contribute most of the cases.\r"

One hundred and thirty practices were visited, and full data were collected from 104. Each practice agreed to establish a register of diabetics, and information and support were subsequently provided to help in developing services. In collecting information from each practice the nurse covered specific points on staff, facilities, and organisation. Over two years the service offered in 60 practices considerably improved, allowing a minimum standard of diabetic care to be achieved. This allowed coordinated and effective referral of certain patients from hospital diabetic clinics and improved services to those not attending any clinics.\r"

This fact adds to the importance of prompt and skillful intervention. At present in the United Kingdom the median time for receiving suitable management for this condition is about four to six hours. With better organisation this delay could, in most areas, be reduced to two or three hours. A major change in the care of patients with myocardial infarction is needed in which the general practitioner should have a crucial role. Health authorities, hospital physicians, general practitioners, and the ambulance services must coordinate their efforts if the potential reduction in mortality is to be realised. The district medical officer should consult colleagues and draw up guidelines for organising the care of patients who have had heart attacks. The management of patients who have had heart attacks in the community and in hospital should be continually audited. There are dangers inherent in the use of thrombolytic treatment, particularly when conditions other than myocardial infarction are treated in error. This treatment should be given only when the diagnosis is highly probable and when close observation of the patient can be ensured during the ensuing hours. Thrombolytic treatment should not, therefore, be given out of hospital except when trained, equipped personnel are in attendance. Treatment can be given in any hospital (including community hospitals) provided there are adequate diagnostic facilities and suitably experienced nursing staff.\r"

  ".W": "Eight lines of human breast tumors implanted in nude mice were treated with various antitumor agents at two different doses, maximum tolerated doses (MTD) and rational doses (RD) that were pharmacokinetically equivalent to the clinical doses; the response rates to both doses were compared. With MTD, the response rates to mitomycin C and vinblastine were 100%, and those to other agents including cyclophosphamide, nimustine (a water-soluble nitrosourea), vincristine, Adriamycin (doxorubicin; Adria Laboratories, Columbus, OH), 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), and methotrexate were 30%-50%, indicating high responsiveness to the former two agents. In contrast, when the RD were used, the response rates to the majority of these agents were 25%-40%, and those to vincristine and nimustine were 13% and 0%, respectively. These results agree with the reported clinical results compared with those with MTD, suggesting the importance of the use of clinically equivalent doses in the evaluation of antitumor efficacy in a human tumor/nude mouse system.\r"

  ".W": "The binding characteristics of fluorescein isothiocyanate conjugated lectins to normal colonic mucosa, and 43 adenomatous polyps were studied by fluorescence microscopy. The lectin, Dolichos biflorus agglutinin (DBA) stained intensely to upper crypt cells of the sigmoid colon and rectum but to a lesser degree to proximal colonic crypts or lower crypt cells distally. Peanut agglutinin (PNA) and Ulex europaeus agglutinin (UEA) did not bind to the theca of proximal or distal colonic crypts. The lectin Griffonia simplicafolia agglutinin (GSA1) bound intensely to upper and lower crypt cells of both regions. PNA binding was noted in 56% of adenomatous polyps, occurred more often in polyps of the distal colorectum, and increased with polyp size and villous histology. UEA bound to 26% of adenomatous polyps, 42% of proximal polyps, and 17% of distal polyps. DBA staining was noted in 72% of polyps without regional preference. GSA1 stained all polyp specimens. To determine if the lectin binding characteristics of an index (initial) polyp might serve as a predictor of metachronous lesions, 20 patients (29 polyps) without a history of polyps or cancer and who had at least one surveillance colonoscopy 1 to 3 years after the initial polypectomy were studied. The presence or absence of PNA, UEA, or DBA binding in an index polyp did not predict the occurrence of metachronous lesions. Five of the six patients with more than one index polyp had metachronous polyps at follow-up surveillance colonoscopy.\r"

The combination therapy with LC9018 demonstrated a significant effect on tumor reduction, compared with radiation therapy alone, at the cumulative doses of 15-Gy and 30-Gy external irradiation (P less than 0.05). Histologic study confirmed that LC9018 also enhanced the therapeutic effect of the irradiation. Moreover, LC9018 seemed to be useful in protecting the patients from leukopenia during radiotherapy. This study suggests that LC9018, when used in combination with radiotherapy, will be an effective adjuvant immunotherapeutic agent. More studies in a large series of patients will, however, be needed to establish its long-term efficacy, safety, and effects on both prognosis and enhancing radiotherapy.\r"

Chylous ascites usually occurs as a result of operative trauma to the thoracic duct, cisterna chyli, or its tributaries. About one third of all patients with chylous ascites after retroperitoneal lymph node dissection also develop secondary chylothorax. Diaphragmatic defects have been shown to be responsible for the occurrence of chylothorax secondary to chyloperitoneum. Congenital diaphragmatic weakness may result in evagination of the peritoneum causing diaphragmatic blebs, the rupture of which results in the movement of the peritoneal fluid into the pleural cavity. In the authors' patient, the rent in the diaphragm that occurred during surgery was probably responsible for the chylothorax. The role of chemotherapy, if any, in the pathophysiology of this complication is unknown. Total parenteral nutrition (TPN) is a simple and effective treatment for postoperative chylous effusions. Surgical treatments such as abdominal exploration for the repair of leaking lymphatics and peritoneovenous shunt should be reserved for patients who fail TPN.\r"

This T-cell line expressed a very unusual phenotype: CD1+, CD2-, CD3+ (cytoplasmic), CD4-, CD5+, CD7+, CD8-, interleukin-2 receptor (IL-2 R) (p55)-, and T-cell antigen receptor (TCAR) alpha beta-. Assays for reverse transcriptase activity and for human T-lymphotropic retroviral sequences in the cellular DNA were negative, indicating that the cells were not transformed by human T-lymphotropic virus (HTLV)-I, HTLV-II, or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-I. Culturing the cells in the differentiation inducing agent 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol 13-acetate induced an increased expression of CD3 but no other significant changes in T-cell markers. A small population of CD4-negative and CD8-negative T-lymphocytes exist in human peripheral blood and they exhibit natural killer (NK) and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxic (ADCC) activity. However, the authors' cell line failed to demonstrate such cytotoxic function. The TCAR gene rearrangement studies showed that both T gamma genes were rearranged while the T beta genes were in the germ line configuration and the T delta genes were deleted. HCD8 strongly expressed the antigens Leu M1 and Ki-1, markers detected only rarely on normal unstimulated human T-cells, but quite consistently found on Reed-Sternberg cells and cells of some large pleomorphic T-cell lymphomas. HCD8 may be used to study the control of Leu M1 and Ki-1 expression in T-cells and it may provide some insight into the cellular origin of the above-mentioned lymphomas.\r"

A 47-year-old man with squamous cell carcinoma of the lung resected 6 months previously presented with syncope secondary to hypotension and a low serum sodium. He was evaluated to determine if atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) might be the etiology of this clinical picture. His plasma concentration of atrial natriuretic factor was increased three-fold over that of 70 normotensive person. Further evaluation revealed metastatic lesions in the right and left cardiac atria with the mass on the left occluding 75% of the left atrial chamber. The mass effect in the atria increasing atrial stretch and atrial pressure one would expect was the main contributor to the increased ANF level. The contribution of direct tumor invasion into the atria and/or production of atrial natriuretic factor by the tumor itself to produce this elevated plasma level of atrial natriuretic factor could not be determined, but this markedly elevated level of atrial natriuretic factor does appear to be the etiology of this patient's clinical picture.\r"

Fifty-three per cent of placebo-treated patients had a PaCO2 greater than 50 mmHg and 89 per cent of these received naloxone. A 200 micrograms.kg-1 bolus of nalbuphine followed by a 50 micrograms.kg-1.hr-1 infusion achieved a mean steady state blood level of 38.2 ng.ml-1 and prevented CO2 retention greater than 50 mmHg in all but two patients, neither of whom required naloxone. There was no difference in the incidence of side effects among groups, and analgesia appeared to be unaffected by nalbuphine.\r"

  ".W": "The volume recruitment manoeuvre is a non-invasive technique used to measure respiratory mechanics in infants. Because airway pressure increases during this manoeuvre, lung volume, compliance and cardiac output may change. In order to assess possible changes in cardiopulmonary function caused by the volume recruitment manoeuvre, we applied this technique to seven intubated infant swine breathing spontaneously during anaesthesia with halothane and N2O. Tidal volume (VT), respiratory frequency, arterial blood gases, cardiac output (CO) and total respiratory compliance were measured before and after the manoeuvre. In three swine functional residual capacity (FRC) was measured by helium dilution before the manoeuvre, and in four swine diaphragmatic EMG was recorded continuously. Finally, all swine were paralysed during volume recruitment to assess the contribution of the respiratory muscles to post-manoeuvre respiratory mechanics. VT and f increased immediately after the manoeuvre but there were no significant changes in PaCO2, or alveolar to arterial oxygen gradient. There was a small but statistically significant decrease in CO. Compliance increased by 17.8 +/- 3.6 per cent and FRC increased by a mean of 41.1 ml (or 51.9 per cent increase above the baseline FRC). The increase in FRC could not be explained by active mechanisms since the diaphragmatic EMG showed no post-inspiratory activity and neuromuscular paralysis did not decrease FRC. We conclude that the volume recruitment manoeuvre increases FRC and compliance by recruiting collapsed alveoli, and this effect must be taken into consideration when applying this test to infants.\r"

  ".W": "Atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) is a peptide released from the heart in response to atrial distension. This peptide causes diuresis, vasodilatation, decreased blood pressure, and antagonizes the renin-aldosterone and antidiuretic hormone neuraxes. The influence of cardiopulmonary bypass and cardiac surgery on the circulation and release of ANF is unknown. Plasma ANF concentrations were therefore determined in patients undergoing coronary artery revascularization (CABG) and mitral valve replacement (MVR). Peptide levels were unchanged following anaesthetic induction. Plasma ANF concentrations decreased significantly during hypothermic (less than or equal to 28 degrees C) cardiopulmonary bypass in both patient groups. After 60 minutes of cardiac bypass, ANF declined from (mean +/- SEM) 512 +/- 132 to 20 +/- 6 pg.ml-1 (P less than 0.05) during MVR, and from 178 +/- 41 to 110 +/- 48 pg.ml-1 during CABG (P less than 0.05). Rewarming during bypass was associated with an increase in ANF concentration in both groups. Heparin anticoagulation and protamine reversal had no effect on immunoreactive ANF levels. In patients undergoing CABG, there was a linear relationship between plasma ANF concentration (pg.ml-1) and right atrial pressure (mmHg) prior to cardiopulmonary bypass (r = 0.86, P less than 0.005). However, one and three hours after cardiopulmonary bypass there was no significant relationship between right atrial pressure and ANF plasma levels. These results suggest that reduction in plasma ANF concentration occurs during hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass. Furthermore, the proportional relationship between atrial distension and circulating ANF concentration was altered following cardiac surgery.\r"

The presence or absence of various clinical signs was noted during tracheal or oesophageal ventilation and arterial blood gases and end-tidal CO2 were measured. Oesophageal ventilation for one minute was associated with significant decreases (P less than 0.001) in pH, PaO2 and SaO2 and a significant (P less than 0.001) increase in PaCO2. Although mean PaO2 decreased by 70 per cent and mean SaO2 decreased by 31 per cent, 43 percent of rats failed to demonstrate a decrease in SaO2 below 85 per cent. Oxygen saturation was the least reliable method for detecting oesophageal intubation (sensitivity = 0.5, specificity = 0.9, positive predictive value (PPV) = 0.8). Chest movement was the most reliable clinical sign for detecting oesophageal intubation (sensitivity = 0.9, specificity = 1.0, PPV = 1.0). Oesophageal rattle was the second most reliable clinical sign (PPV = 0.9). Moisture condensation in the tracheal tube (PPV = 1.0) and abdominal distension (PPV = 0.9) were judged to be the least reliable because each had a high false negative rate of 0.3. The most reliable method for the early detection of oesophageal intubation in rats was end-tidal, CO2 (sensitivity 1.0, specificity = 1.0, PPV = 1.0). In addition, end-tidal CO2 when used in conjunction with the four clinical signs improved the reliability of these signs.\r"

We hypothesized that vasoactive products released by leukocytes might produce constriction of atherosclerotic arteries. To test this hypothesis, we infused fmet-leu-phe (fMLP), a peptide that activates leukocytes to release their vasoactive products, into the perfused hind limb of normal and atherosclerotic cynomolgus monkeys. Infusion of fMLP did not change resistance of large arteries in normal monkeys. In contrast, fMLP produced pronounced constriction of large arteries in atherosclerotic monkeys. To determine whether leukotrienes, platelet-activating factor, or prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), which are released by leukocytes, may contribute to leukocyte-induced vasoconstriction in atherosclerotic monkeys, we injected leukotriene D4, platelet-activating factor, and PGE2 intra-arterially into the perfused hind limb. Leukotriene D4 and platelet-activating factor had minimal effects on large arteries in both normal and atherosclerotic monkeys. PGE2 produced marked constriction of large arteries in atherosclerotic, but not normal, monkeys. Thus, pronounced constriction in atherosclerotic, but not normal, arteries during infusion of fMLP suggests that products released by leukocytes may mediate vasoconstriction in atherosclerotic vessels. Vasoconstrictor responses to PGE2 are profoundly potentiated by atherosclerosis, which suggests that PGE2 may contribute to leukocyte-induced vasoconstriction.\r"

In contrast to previously described complementary DNA clones for Gi alpha 2, this complementary DNA has a complete 3'-untranslated region with the expected consensus sequence for polyadenylation. Gi alpha 2 is the predominant isoform in the heart, and its message level of 14.7 +/- 4.9 pg/10 micrograms total ventricular RNA is about fourfold lower than that of the stimulatory guanine nucleotide-binding protein.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of 1 hour of myocardial ischemia on the function of the stimulatory guanine-nucleotide-binding protein Gs was examined. This study follows our recent finding that myocardial ischemia increases the density of beta-adrenoreceptors in a conscious canine model while having the opposite effect on the activity of adenylate cyclase. Coronary artery occlusion was induced in five conscious dogs and verified by measurement of blood flow using the Doppler and microsphere techniques. Alterations in the level and function of Gs were examined in sarcolemmal membranes prepared from ischemic and nonischemic regions of the left ventricle. After 1 hour of coronary artery occlusion, the functional activity of sarcolemmal Gs, as determined by reconstitution with cyc- membranes, decreased by 27 +/- 7% in the ischemic zone. Cholera toxin labeling performed in parallel with the reconstitution studies demonstrated a similar decrease of 28 +/- 7%. This was associated with decreases in basal activity and decreases in adenylate cyclase activity stimulated by GTP, GTP plus isoproterenol, sodium fluoride, and forskolin. Thus, a defect distal to the beta-adrenoreceptor occurs in the transduction of adrenergic signals to the heart as a consequence of 1 hour of ischemia.\r"

  ".W": "In view of evidence implicating thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) as a chemical mediator of synaptic transmission onto spinal sympathetic neurons, this peptide was administered intrathecally, in a dose of 6.5 nmol, at the T9 and T2 spinal levels in the anesthetized rat. At the lower thoracic level TRH increased arterial pressure and heart rate; these effects peaked at 4-7 minutes and decayed over the next 15-20 minutes. At the upper thoracic level the pressor and cardioacceleratory responses were roughly similar in time course but were smaller in magnitude. Hexamethonium (10 mg/kg i.v.) was tested on the responses from the lower thoracic level; both pressor and cardioacceleratory responses persisted after hexamethonium pretreatment. In addition, intravenous administration of 6.5 nmol of TRH failed to alter arterial pressure or heart rate, suggesting that the effects produced by the intrathecal administration of TRH were due to an action of the peptide in the spinal cord. The results also indicate that the pressor effect and the increase in heart rate may be mediated in the sympathetic ganglia at least partly via nonnicotinic transmission. Our results provide physiological support for the possibility that TRH is a chemical mediator of synaptic transmission onto sympathetic preganglionic neurons. This study indicates that the functional sympathetic pathways utilizing TRH as a chemical mediator include those regulating arterial pressure and heart rate.\r"

  ".U": "90003703\r", 
  ".W": "To investigate whether or not hypertension with left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) modifies the mechanisms underlying the vascular adjustments to orthostatic stress, we evaluated the hemodynamic and hormonal effects of graded lower-body negative pressure (LBNP) (-10 and -40 mm Hg) before and after sympathetic blockade in 10 hypertensive patients with LVH and in five age- and sex-matched normotensive subjects. In control conditions, LBNP elicited comparable vasoconstrictor responses in the forearm in the two groups. In normotensive subjects, graded increases in plasma norepinephrine and plasma renin activity (PRA) and reductions in plasma immunoreactive atrial natriuretic factor (irANF) were recorded. In hypertensive patients, a significant increase in plasma norepinephrine and plasma renin activity was obtained only with the higher level of LBNP, whereas irANF plasma levels decreased progressively. In both groups, sympathetic blockade abolished the increase in plasma renin activity and did not modify the changes in plasma irANF induced by both levels of LBNP in control conditions. The vascular response to -10 mm Hg LBNP remained unchanged after sympathetic blockade in both groups. However, after sympathetic blockade, the vasoconstrictor response to -40 mm Hg LBNP in normal subjects was no longer different from that elicited by -10 mm Hg LBNP, whereas in hypertensive patients the vasoconstrictor response was still significantly higher than that induced by -10 mm Hg LBNP. Direct correlations between the percent changes in forearm vascular resistance and those in plasma norepinephrine and plasma renin activity were found only in normal subjects in control conditions but were not observed after sympathetic blockade. On the contrary, the inverse correlation between changes in irANF plasma levels and in forearm vascular resistance found in control conditions in both groups was still observed after sympathetic blockade. In a separate group of hypertensive patients with left ventricular hypertrophy, exogenous infusion of ANF induced an increase in venous irANF plasma levels of the same magnitude of the decrease evoked by LBNP and significantly reduced forearm vascular resistance. These data show that in hypertensive patients with left ventricular hypertrophy, sympathetic activation does not contribute to the vascular response to cardiopulmonary receptor unloading (-10 mm Hg LBNP). They also suggest that in these patients inhibition of ANF secretion may play a role in the response to a low level of LBNP so that the peripheral vasoconstriction induced by cardiopulmonary receptor unloading is comparable to that observed in normal subjects despite the lack of appropriate sympathetic reflex vasoconstriction.\r"

The patients were given synthetic atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) (99-126 alpha-hANP) at 1 and 2 pmol/kg/min in series (phases 1 and 2, 2 hours each dose) or vehicle (hemaccel) in random order on two separate occasions while on their usual diet.

After 30 minutes during phase 2, systolic blood pressure decreased significantly by 20 +/- 4 mm Hg (p less than 0.001) from basal and time-matched placebo values and remained significantly reduced (-17 +/- 4 mm Hg, p less than 0.001) by the end of the recovery period (2 hours after infusions were completed). Pulmonary systolic blood pressure decreased by 5 +/- 1 mm Hg (phase 2, p less than 0.05). Cardiac output decreased by 0.5 +/- 0.1 l/min below baseline at the end of phase 2 of ANF infusion, whereas it increased significantly (p less than 0.02) by 0.6 +/- 0.1 l/min during vehicle infusion. Systemic diastolic, pulmonary diastolic, right atrial, and wedge pressures were not significantly changed during ANF or vehicle infusions, nor were pulmonary vascular resistance or heart rate altered. Systemic vascular resistance did not change significantly during both infusions, whereas during recovery, systemic vascular resistance decreased significantly after ANF infusion was discontinued (p less than 0.05). Microhematocrit levels increased dose dependently during ANF. The maximum increase was observed at the end of phase 2 (+4.7 +/- 1.7%), whereas the microhematocrit level decreased to -2.4 +/- 0.6% with vehicle (p less than 0.001) at the end of phase 2. Urinary sodium excretion increased significantly (p less than 0.02) by the end of phase 2 under ANF infusion (+38 +/- 15%), whereas it decreased (-10 +/- 6%) under placebo infusion by the end of phase 2. Urinary magnesium excretion was significantly increased during ANF infusion from phase 1 (p less than 0.02), whereas urinary potassium levels, calcium levels, creatinine levels, volume, and glomerular filtration rate did not differ significantly between the two infusions. Plasma renin, angiotensin II, aldosterone, and catecholamine concentrations did not change significantly during ANF or vehicle infusions.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "We performed a prospective, randomized, double-blind trial in 194 unselected patients to determine the safety and efficacy of low molecular weight heparin (Fragmin) compared with standard heparin as the initial treatment of acute venous thromboembolism. Ninety-eight patients received continuous intravenous heparin, and 96 patients received Fragmin for 5-10 days. Doses were adjusted to maintain anti-Xa levels between 0.3 and 0.6 unit/ml for patients with a high risk for a bleeding complication and between 0.4 and 0.9 unit/ml for patients with a low risk for bleeding. Treatment was stopped when a therapeutic level of anticoagulation (International Normalized Ratio greater than 3.5) was reached with coumarins. Thirteen patients in the heparin group and 10 patients in the Fragmin group had a major bleeding complication. The incidence of major and minor bleeding complications combined decreased from 48.9% to 38.5% (95% confidence interval for the difference, -3.5% to +24.2%), corresponding with a relative bleeding risk reduction of 21.2%. There were no significant differences in efficacy as defined by new high-probability defects on repeat ventilation-perfusion scintigraphy of the lung in 80 patients: six of 46 patients in the heparin group and 3 of 34 patients in the Fragmin group had new defects (95% confidence interval for the difference, -9.4% to +17.8%). We conclude that low molecular weight heparin (Fragmin) given in adjusted, continuous, and intravenous doses is safe and effective as initial treatment of acute venous thromboembolism compared with heparin. There is a trend in risk reduction for bleeding in favor of low molecular weight heparin, a trend, however, that is smaller than expected compared with animal studies.\r"

Twenty-seven (79%) patients had values below 1.6 mg/dl, which contrasted in 21 of them with a lack of reciprocal elevation of T3RU values. By contrast, T4-binding capacity of TBG measured in 14 patients with low TBG concentration was normal, suggesting that the low TBG values were an artefact resulting from an altered immunoreactivity of the protein. In 2 patients with low TBG while on hemodialysis, TBG levels increased significantly after renal transplantation. This suggests that the \"low TBG syndrome\" (altered immunoreactivity in the face of normal T4-binding capacity) observed in patients on chronic hemodialysis is a consequence of uremia.\r"

Dilevalol or a placebo was administered intravenously in bolus injections of 25, 50, and 50 mg at 15-minute intervals. Fifteen minutes after a cumulative dose of 125 mg, the blood pressure was lowered by 11/9 mm Hg, compared with 2/1 mm Hg after placebo (p less than 0.01 between groups for systolic and diastolic blood pressure), an effect that persisted for at least 105 minutes. Standing systolic blood pressure was also lowered in dilevalol-treated patients without orthostatic symptoms. No significant effects on heart rate were noted. Fifteen minutes after the last dose of dilevalol, plasma norepinephrine levels increased from a baseline of 200 +/- 24 to 495 +/- 44 pg/ml (p less than 0.01), compared with a nonsignificant rise from 262 +/- 21 to 306 +/- 28 pg/ml with placebo vehicle. Dilevalol also increased alpha-human atrial natriuretic factor by 5.4 pg/ml, compared with 0.5 pg/ml after placebo (p less than 0.01 between groups). Plasma renin activity and plasma epinephrine, aldosterone, and cyclic guanosine monophosphate levels were unchanged by dilevalol. There were no significant adverse effects with dilevalol administration. Compared with placebo, dilevalol given intravenously appears to be safe and effective antihypertensive treatment.\r"

The enteral group had a needle catheter jejunostomy (NCJ) placed at laparotomy and an elemental diet begun 12 h postoperatively, advanced in volume and concentration at 8-h intervals to 100-125 ml/h of full-strength diet. Symptoms of GI complaints (nausea, vomiting, cramping, distention, and diarrhea) were monitored daily and graded as minimal, moderate, or significant. Fifty percent of the control group had one or more GI complaints during the study period; six (12%) developed moderate discomfort. In the enteral group, 59 (83%) patients reported some GI discomfort; 11 had significant complaints (two nausea, seven cramping, six distention, two diarrhea). Nine (13%) of the enteral-fed patients ultimately required total parenteral nutrition supplementation due to GI complaints. The remaining 62 (87%) enteral patients were maintained on the elemental diet for a mean of 7 days (range 5 to 20).

There was no prior history of diarrhea in any patient studied. There was a significant difference in both albumin levels and diarrhea incidence in the three groups (analysis of variance, p less than .05). Diarrhea occurred in four of 11 ICU patients while receiving feedings, but not in the healthy volunteers or non-ICU patients. The four patients with diarrhea had an average albumin level of 2.8 g/dl, while the other ICU patients had an average albumin of 2.6 g/dl. We conclude that isotonic NG tube feedings do not cause diarrhea in healthy volunteers or postoperative head and neck cancer patients. However, in some mechanically ventilated ICU patients, this regimen may cause diarrhea even though no risk factors can be clearly identified.\r"

Plasma hANP concentration did not significantly decrease during total aortic cross clamping (ACC) with complete clamping of the superior and inferior vena cavae. This finding may be explained by the suppression of endopeptidase activities and the response of hANP receptors due to the low body temperature. Plasma hANP concentration strongly increased from 56.6 +/- 8.4 to 208.9 +/- 40.7 pg/ml (n = 5) by the release of total ACC. This strong increase of hANP in the plasma may occur due to the rapid increase of atrial pressure from zero to 12.5 mm Hg caused by releasing the total ACC. The molecular form of plasma hANP obtained after the release of total ACC was alpha-hANP alone, which was estimated by gel permeation chromatography and reverse HPLC.\r"

Initially, the bronchial reactivity to IC-PGF2 alpha and the DP20-PGF2 alpha were determined. Recalculations were made two days later and again 1 h after administration of various drugs given on different days. Salbutamol and ipratropium bromide induced significant bronchodilation and of similar magnitude 1 h after administration. On the day salbutamol was given, surface area under the dose-response curve to PGF2 alpha was significantly higher and the final drop of FEV1 significantly lower than those observed on days when placebo, ipratropium bromide and cromolyn sodium were given. No differences among these values were found for placebo, ipratropium bromide and cromolyn sodium. Thus, beta 2 stimulants attenuate significantly PGF2 alpha-induced bronchospasm, while ipratropium bromide and cromolyn sodium do not have protective effect.\r"

To study the natural history of angiodysplasia and compare the efficacy of medical therapy, endoscopic electrocoagulation, and surgery, the course of 101 patients evaluated from 1974 through 1983 at the Massachusetts General Hospital was reviewed. Angiodysplasia caused bleeding that ranged from occult blood in stools to massive hemorrhage and was also observed incidentally in nonbleeding patients. Patients were followed for up to 10 years (mean of 22 months). Rebleeding was defined as evidence of hemorrhage requiring hospital admission, transfusion, or surgery. Thirty-one patients were treated surgically, 19 patients were treated endoscopically, and 36 patients were treated medically. Using life table analysis we observed similar rebleeding rates among medically and endoscopically treated groups. The surgically treated group had a frequency of rebleeding less than half that of the other groups (P = 0.15). A multivariate regression analysis failed to identify any factors other than coagulopathy to explain the different incidence of rebleeding in the patients treated by endoscopic electrocoagulation and surgery.\r"

  ".W": "To analyze interleukin-2-dependent immunoregulatory function in hepatitis B virus infection and in other forms of viral hepatitis, levels of soluble interleukin-2 receptors (sIL-2R) were measured by an enzyme-linked assay in sera from patients with acute and chronic viral hepatitis of different etiology. Increased sIL-2R levels were detected in the early phase of acute hepatitis type A and type B, but not during acute non-A, non-B hepatitis. Among 46 patients with chronic hepatitis B virus infection, levels of sIL-2R were significantly increased only in cases with chronic active hepatitis, while they were about normal in chronic persistent hepatitis or in healthy carriers of the infection. These differences were independent of virus replication, being maintained when patients were stratified according to HBeAg/anti-HBe status and to serum HBV-DNA. Nine patients with chronic active hepatitis type B and high sIL-2R levels at presentation were followed prospectively for two to eight years, and in HBeAg-positive patients, the behavior of receptor levels closely paralleled disease activity. These results, which may reflect increased shedding of IL-2R by activated T lymphocytes in patients with active destruction of HBV infected hepatocytes, indicate the usefulness and potential prognostic importance of serum sIL-2R determination in patients with chronic viral hepatitis. Patients with chronic non-A, non-B hepatitis had much lower sIL-2R levels, although their liver disease was similar to hepatitis B cases, suggesting that different pathogenetic mechanisms operate in these patients.\r"

PGI2 synthesis was assessed by determining the urinary excretion of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha and 2,3-dinor-6-keto-PGF1 alpha and TX synthesis by measuring TXB2 in serum and urine. In the resting state, prostanoid excretion and concentrations were similar in diabetic and control subjects. During 40 min of ergometric cycling exercise, the urinary excretion of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha (a hydration product of vasodilatory PGI2) increased 5.8-fold more in the 12 control subjects than in the 15 diabetic patients (P less than .02). Serum TXB2 concentration rose similarly in diabetic patients and control subjects (P less than .05). During a 75-km competitive cross-country ski race (7 h, 30 min), urinary excretion of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha rose 1.9-fold in 7 diabetic (P less than .05) and 3.3-fold in 10 control (P less than .001) subjects, whereas urinary dinor excretion, reflecting vascular PGI2 synthesis more closely, increased only in the control subjects (P less than .01). Urinary TXB2 excretion remained unchanged in both groups during long-term exercise. These data suggest that diabetic patients have normal PGI2 and TXA2 synthesis in the resting state but diminished PGI2 response to both acute and prolonged exercise.\r"

This study tests the efficacy of a specific combined regimen for a subpopulation of patients with a randomized double-masked placebo-controlled crossover design and under conditions similar to those of clinical practice. Twenty subjects with limited duration (less than 15 yr) type II diabetes who were moderately obese (less than 160% ideal wt) and proved imperfectly controlled on 10 mg glyburide twice daily completed two 4-mo crossover protocols, comparing a single injection of NPH insulin in the evening plus 10 mg glyburide in the morning with insulin plus placebo. Insulin dose was adjusted by experienced endocrinologists seeking the best glycemic control consistent with safety. All subjects had glycosylated hemoglobin values less than or equal to 150% of the control mean on combined therapy, and combined therapy was superior to insulin alone (fasting plasma glucose 8.0 +/- 0.3 vs. 11.1 +/- 0.6 mM, P less than .01; glycosylated hemoglobin 9.8 +/- 0.1 vs. 10.6 +/- 0.2%, P less than .01). Despite greater weight gain on combined therapy, blood pressure and plasma lipid concentrations were the same on the two regimens. These results suggest this simple regimen offers another option, besides multiple injections of insulin, for patients of this kind who are unsuccessful with a sulfonylurea or a single injection of insulin alone.\r"

With a monoclonal antibody, it was shown that high inhibition values were due to PAI-1. No differences in PA inhibition were noted in relation to type of diabetes, diabetic treatment, or presence or absence of vascular complications. Basal PA inhibition did not correlate with in vivo (B beta 15-42 antigen) or ex vivo (fibrin plate) fibrinolytic activity or HbA1. In patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, treatment with the anabolic steroid stanozolol significantly reduced PA inhibition. These findings suggest a further abnormality of fibrinolysis in diabetes, but the lack of a relationship among other measures of fibrinolysis renders its biologic significance uncertain.\r"

  ".W": "We studied the effect of dopamine (DA) on the rate of processing of PRL after biosynthesis and, with TRH, on the secretion of PRL of different intracellular ages. In these studies anterior pituitary (AP) PRL of lactating rats was pulse labeled either in vivo with [3H]leucine (3 microCi/g BW, injected iv 0.2, 1, 4, 8, 16, or 24 h before removing the AP for incubation) or in vitro with [3H]- or [14C]leucine (5 microCi/ml Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer for 5 min), followed by a chase period of 15-240 min of AP fragments in medium 199. Also, to determine if endogenous DA influenced PRL synthesis, the rate of [14C]-leucine incorporation into PRL was determined in AP fragments from alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine (alpha MpT)-pretreated (200 mg/kg BW) rats. Tissue and medium PRL levels were quantified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis densitometric and liquid scintillation techniques. In APs from alpha MpT-treated animals [14C]-leucine incorporation into PRL increased about 30% above control values after the 5-min pulse period, and the release of labeled PRL from alpha MpT-treated APs was about 80% higher than control values after 4 h of incubation. On the other hand, when DA (50 microM) was present in the incubation medium, AP concentrations and release of in vitro synthesized [3H]PRL were significantly decreased (45-55% compared to control values; P less than 0.001). The [3H]PRL concentration, but not that of total, i.e. unlabeled PRL, fell within the AP as the time from in vivo pulse labeling to removal of the pituitary gland increased from 8 to 24 h, thus suggesting that a loss of labeled hormone occurred as it aged within the gland. Also, it was found that biosynthesis and/or processing of PRL were markedly depressed in APs from rats whose pups were removed for 24 h. Under basal conditions, in vitro secretion of [3H]PRLs during the first 30-60 min of incubation consisted primarily of mature [3H]PRL, i.e. those labeled 4 and 8 h previously, whereas newly synthesized (labeled 0.2 and 1 h previously) and old [3H]PRL (labeled 16 and 24 h previously) were secreted at much lower rates. These data confirm previous in vivo and in vitro results on the sequential release of different age PRLs. DA (17 microM) had a significantly greater inhibitory effect on newly synthesized and older stored PRL than on PRL labeled 4-8 h previously. The converse was true with regard to the PRL stimulatory effects of TRH; it provoked greater stimulation of PRL labeled 4-8 h before incubation, thus suggesting an interdependence of the actions of DA or TRH with intracellular age of the hormone.\r"

However, the cellular basis for this phenomenon along with the relative contribution of stored hormone to basal secretion has yet to be clearly established. In the present study, we employed reverse hemolytic plaque assays to monitor basal and stimulated release of GH and PRL from individual cells in which de novo protein synthesis had been blocked. Monodispersed pituitaries from adult male rats were cultured for 21 h in the absence or presence of maximally effective doses of puromycin (100 microM) or cycloheximide (36 microM) and were then subjected to separate plaque assays for GH or PRL. Treatment with puromycin reduced the percentage of GH or PRL secretors (plaque formers) by about half. Coincubation with stimulatory secretagogues did not increase the percentages of GH or PRL secretors in control cultures, but returned the proportion in puromycin-treated cells to normal, demonstrating that cells which failed to secrete basally could still release hormone from their stored pools when stimulated. Very similar results were obtained when these experiments were repeated with cycloheximide. Taken together, these results demonstrate that only a fraction of the cells that release GH or PRL are dependent upon newly synthesized hormone for basal secretion; the remainder appear capable of mobilizing stored hormone for this purpose even in the absence of stimulation.\r"

Mechanically dispersed cultured fetal telencephalic and diencephalic cells showed a progressive increase in immunoreactive VIP in both cells and media, reaching maximum values between 110-290 pg/mg protein.culture plate on days 15-20. Immunoreactive VIP in both cells and media corresponded almost exclusively to VIP-28 on exclusion chromatography and HPLC, and was identical to the form extracted from whole fetal brain. This indicates that both the stored and secreted forms of VIP are the mature 28-amino acid-containing peptide. To determine the influence of membrane depolarization on VIP release, the potassium concentration in the medium was increased to 30 and 56 mM, inducing a marked increase in medium VIP concentrations. The effects of K+ were dependent on Ca2+ transport, since release was blocked by the addition of verapamil, a Ca2+ channel blocker (20 microM). VIP release was stimulated by Na+ channel activation using the drug veratridine (100 microM); this effect was blocked by tetrodoxin. The influence of GH-releasing factor (GRF) on VIP release was studied by adding GRF (10(-9)-10(-7) M), alone or in the presence of anti-rGRF immunoglobulins (antirat GRF immunoglobulin G) to the incubation medium. Rat GRF stimulated VIP release and the simultaneous addition of antirat GRF immunoglobulin G blocked this effect. These findings confirm that VIP regulation by brain cells corresponds to the well defined patterns of membrane activation observed in other neuronal systems. They, furthermore, demonstrate that VIP release is under GRF influence.\r"

In the present study the ontogenesis of immunoreactive rat(r) GRF (IR-GRF) in long term dissociated fetal rat cerebrocortical and hypothalamic cell cultures and the regulation of its secretion by potassium depolarization and calcium channel-blocking agents were investigated. The chromatographic profiles of IR-rGRF from cell extracts were determined and compared with those from in vivo cerebrocortical and hypothalamic tissues. Mechanically dispersed cultured telencephalic and diencephalic cells from 17- to 21-day-old fetal rats showed a progressive increase in IR-rGRF, reaching maximum values (media plus cells) between 775-1020 (pg/mg protein) in hypothalamic cells on days 10-20 and between 450 and 950 pg/mg protein in cortical cells on days 25-30. IR-rGRF from acidic extracts of cells and adult cortical and hypothalamic tissues adsorbed onto octadecylsilyl-silica columns corresponds primarily to rGRF-(1-43)OH on HPLC. In gel filtration chromatography, almost all IR-rGRF from cultured cerebrocortical cells and fetal and adult cortical tissues coeluted with rGRF-(1-43)OH. IR-rGRF from cultured hypothalamic cells showed an additional component with a higher mol wt eluting in the void volume. To determine the influence of membrane depolarization of rGRF release, potassium (K+) concentrations in the medium were increased to 30 and 56 mM, inducing a marked increase in medium rGRF concentrations. Verapamil, a Ca2+ channel blocker (20 microns) reverses the effect of 56 mM potassium depolarization, suggesting that it is at least partially dependent upon Ca2+ transport. These data indicate that fetal rat cerebrocortical and hypothalamic cells in culture produce and release rGRF in response to depolarizing agents. The presence of rGRF in cortical tissue suggests that there are other physiological roles besides those implicated in the stimulation of GH secretion.\r"

Since 12-HETE is not only a major arachidonate lipoxygenase (LO) product in the kidney, but is also a potent inhibitor of renin release, we studied the role of AII on renin inhibition and 12-HETE formation using rat renal cortical slices and isolated juxtaglomerular-like cells. In both preparations, 12-HETE was produced in a basal state. AII significantly inhibited renin release (control 100 +/- 3%, AII (10(8) M) 79 + 4%, P less than 0.01) and stimulated 12-HETE formation in slices (control 106 +/- 6%, AII 10(-8) M 177 +/- 18%, P less than 0.01) and in an enriched juxtaglomular cell preparation (control 96 +/- 3%, AII 10(-8) M 130 +/- 6%, P less than 0.001). A specific cyclooxygenase blocker, meclofenomate, or 5-LO blocker, U60,257, did not alter basal or AII-induced renin inhibition or 12-HETE formation by slices. The LO blockers BW755c, at 10(-5) M, or baicalein, 10(-6) M, did not significantly alter basal renin or 12-HETE levels, but BW755c at 10(-4) M, significantly stimulated basal renin (131 +/- 4%) and decreased basal 12-HETE levels (72 +/- 5%). However, both BW755c and baicalein blunted AII-induced renin inhibition (AII, 10(-8) M 70 +/- 3%, AII + BW755c, 10(-5) M 85 +/- 4%, P less than 0.02, AII + baicalein, 10(-6) M, 90 +/- 4%, P less than 0.005) and AII mediated 12-HETE formation (AII, 10(-8) M 150 +/- 5%, AII + BW755c, 10(-5) M 117 +/- 8%, P less than 0.02, AII + baicalein, 10(-6) M 110 +/- 3%, P less than 0.005). These results suggest that AII inhibition of renin is not mediated by the cyclooxygenase or 5-LO pathway, but rather by the 12-LO pathway. These findings reveal a new action for 12-LO products which may play a pivotal role in stimulus secretion coupling of renin secretion.\r"

  ".W": "The melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) is a cyclic neuropeptide, first isolated from salmon pituitary glands, which regulates melanin dispersion in the skin and perhaps the activity of the pituitary-adrenal axis in teleost fish. We have recently purified and characterized rat MCH (rMCH) and report here the cloning and sequencing of specific MCH cDNA isolated from a rat hypothalamic library. The sequence of rMCH found by DNA sequencing confirms the sequence deduced from the purified peptide. rMCH is located at the C-terminus of a protein precursor of 165 amino acid residues. Comparison of the amino acid sequence of prepro-MCH and that of the Aplysia peptide-A prohormone suggests that these proteins as well as other precursors may be evolutionarily related. Besides rMCH, two putative neuropeptides, termed NGE and NEI, might be generated from the same precursor. The rMCH precursor shared sequence identities with human GH-releasing factor and mammalian CRF in the regions encoding NGE and NEI. By immunohistochemical studies we have established that the amidated C-terminus of NEI is recognized by some alpha MSH and rat CRF antisera and that the C-terminal portion of NGE is responsible for the cross-reactivity revealed with one hGRF-(1-37) antiserum. Our results explain the staining of a discrete population of dorso-lateral hypothalamic neurons by heretofore seemingly unrelated antisera and provide evidence for the production of multiple novel neuropeptides from a common precursor.\r"

  ".W": "To study the occurrence of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) in overloaded ventricles, suprarenal aortic coarctation was performed on adult rats (n = 60) to induce overloaded left ventricle. In 36 rats, the overloads were released in 2 weeks. The hearts (6 rats in each group) were examined 2, 7, and 14 days after overload and 2, 7, 19, 47, and 77 days after overload release. Another group of 6 rats was coarctated for the second time for 1-6 days after 14 days of coarctation and 7 days of release. ANP immunoreactivity was examined by light and electron microscopic immunocytochemistry. ANP mRNA was studied by RNA-RNA tissue in situ hybridization. ANP immunoreactivity and ANP mRNA were found in the left ventricle 2 days after coarctation, and their amounts increased in proportion to the intraventricular pressure and the duration of coarctation. Two days after release, ANP and its mRNA began to decrease, but at 77 days ANP-containing granules still existed in the ventricular myocytes, whereas its mRNA became undetectable. The second coarctation triggered the release of the remaining ventricular ANP from the first overload and induced another cycle of increased ANP synthesis. Specific granules that do not contain ANP were found in overload-released ventricles, indicating the possible existence of other peptide hormones. These findings suggest that the extents of ventricular ANP gene expression and ANP synthesis and release are regulated by intraventricular pressure, and the occurrence of ANP in overloaded ventricles may not be a transient, immediately reversible phenomenon.\r"

  ".W": "TSH is a glycoprotein hormone composed of two subunits with attached carbohydrate chains that have varying structural characteristics. To determine the role of TRH in vivo in regulating structural characteristics of TSH carbohydrate chains, adult rats received paraventricular nuclear (PVN) lesions (n = 6) or sham lesions (n = 6). The PVN contain large amounts of TRH, and rats with lesions in these hypothalamic nuclei have been shown to have decreased plasma thyroid hormone levels. At 10 days after surgery, sc osmotic pumps infusing saline or 1 mg/kg/day TRH were placed. At 14 days after surgery, pituitaries were removed and incubated with [3H]glucosamine for 24 h. Glycopeptides prepared from secreted TSH were sequentially eluted from Concanavalin-A chromatography columns selecting unbound, weakly bound, and strongly bound forms. Plasma free T4 was lower in the PVN lesioned rats treated with saline than sham lesioned rats treated with saline (1.6 +/- 0.4 vs. 5.2 +/- 0.1 ng/dl, P less than 0.001). In vivo TRH administration in the PVN lesioned group normalized plasma free T4 but had no effect on free T4 in the sham group. Secreted TSH glycopeptides in the PVN lesioned rats treated with saline as compared to sham lesioned rats treated with saline had fewer unbound forms reflecting multiantennary structures (43 +/- 4 vs. 57 +/- 1%; P less than 0.05) and more weakly bound forms reflecting biantennary structures (50 +/- 4 vs. 35 +/- 2%; P less than 0.05). TRH administration in vivo normalized the Concanavalin-A binding pattern of secreted TSH glycopeptides in the PVN lesioned group but had no significant effect in the sham lesioned group. TSH alpha-subunit demonstrated both multi- and biantennary forms but TSH-beta subunit showed a predominance of multiantennary forms in both the PVN and sham lesioned groups treated with saline. In vivo changes in TRH levels altered TSH carbohydrate characteristics as described above for both subunits. In summary, hypothalamic hypothyroidism altered TSH carbohydrate structures, and in vivo TRH administration normalized these structures in parallel with the correction of serum free T4. In addition to reported quantitative changes in TSH in response to TRH, these qualitative changes may have an important effect on TSH action.\r"

  ".W": "The aim of this study was to determine the role of the posterior pituitary gland in the control of PRL, LH, FSH, and ACTH secretion in sheep. Posterior pituitary function was removed in ovariectomized ewes by electrical lesioning of the hypothalamo-neurohypophysial tract immediately posterior to the stalk-median eminence (LESION); controls were subjected to sham surgery (SHAM). LESION caused a 2-fold increase in plasma PRL concentrations on days 1-3 after surgery. Thereafter, concentrations gradually declined until they were similar to those in SHAM ewes. There was no change in plasma concentrations of LH, FSH, or ACTH after LESION. Plasma PRL responses to insulin in SHAM ewes were completely abolished, and the plasma PRL response to chlorpromazine was reduced to almost half by LESION. In contrast, audiovisual stress (barking dog) and serotonin challenge caused an immediate release of PRL in both LESION and SHAM ewes, with the amplitude of the responses indistinguishable between groups. LESION had no effect on the plasma ACTH responses to audiovisual stress, insulin, or serotonin. We conclude that the posterior pituitary gland is involved in the regulation of PRL under some circumstances, but not of LH, FSH, or ACTH secretion in the sheep. Accordingly, changes in PRL release after hypothalamopituitary disconnection in this species may reflect a loss of posterior lobe function rather than the removal of hypothalamic inputs. In addition, the PRL response to insulin is dependent on a functional posterior pituitary gland, whereas responses to audiovisual stress and serotonin appear to rely on inputs to the pituitary gland via the median eminence and the long hypothalamo-hypophysial portal blood vessels.\r"

Y-1 cell membranes rapidly bound [125I]ANP, with equilibrium binding (22 C) reached within 45 min. Binding of [125I]ANP was inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner by unlabeled ANP and atriopeptin-I (IC50, approximately 1.2 X 10(-9) and 1.6 X 10(-8) M, respectively), but not by C- or N-terminal-deleted ANP fragments, ACTH, or arginine vasopressin (up to 10(-6) M). Scatchard analysis revealed a single class of high affinity binding sites with a Kd of 1.6 X 10(-10) M and a binding capacity of 560 fmol/mg protein. Photo-affinity labeling demonstrated the specific binding of ANP to two protein entities of 130 and 63 kDa. ANP stimulated both cGMP synthesis and secretion from Y-1 cells (EC50, approximately 3.5 X 10(-9) M). Release of the nucleotide was inhibited by probenecid (IC50, approximately 5 X 10(-5) M). The atrial peptide partially inhibited ACTH-stimulated cAMP formation (IC50, approximately 10(-8) M) and partially antagonized basal and ACTH-stimulated steroidogenesis. The data demonstrate the presence in Y-1 cells of specific and saturable ANP receptors, activation of which leads to changes in cyclic nucleotide metabolism and inhibition of steroidogenesis.\r"

  ".U": "90005175\r", 
  ".W": "Although the pituitary-grafted rat is a classic model of chronic PRL excess, the presence of somatotropes in grafted pituitary tissue indicates a potential for GH secretion. The current study was designed to investigate GH-releasing hormone (GRH)-induced GH secretion and beta-adrenergic inhibition of GH release in animals bearing ectopic pituitary tissue free from hypothalamic control. Positive findings with regard to these in vivo experiments led us to an initial determination of GH secretion by individual somatotropes from transplanted pituitary tissue. In litters of 10 30-day-old Fisher rats, 2 male animals received subcapsular renal grafts of 3 littermate pituitary glands each. Thirty-five days after grafting, 1 group received saline (SAL) followed by GRH, and the other received the beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol (ISO) followed by GRH. Blood samples were taken before and after SAL or ISO treatment, GRH was then infused, and sampling was continued. Plasma was assayed for GH and PRL, and the reverse hemolytic plaque assay was used to determine GH release by individual somatotropes from transplanted pituitary tissue. Plasma PRL was clearly elevated in pituitary-grafted compared to muscle-grafted animals, but there was no difference in either body weight gain or basal GH levels between the groups. As shown previously, ISO itself induced a brief release of GH due to its direct effect on the pituitary gland. The GH response to GRH was greater in pituitary-grafted animals than in muscle-grafted controls after both SAL and ISO. GRH-induced GH release was suppressed by ISO pretreatment in muscle-grafted animals, but not in pituitary-grafted animals. The reverse hemolytic plaque assay unequivocally showed that transplanted pituitary tissue was capable of tonic as well as GRH-stimulated GH release. These results demonstrate that despite similar basal GH levels, animals bearing pituitary grafts release significantly greater amounts of GH in response to GRH. The evidence for GH secretion by individual somatotropes from transplanted pituitary tissue directly shows the grafted tissue to be a source of GRH-stimulated GH. The lack of beta-adrenergic inhibition of GRH-induced GH release in pituitary-grafted animals is consistent with the hypothesis that beta-adrenergic inhibition of GRH-induced GH secretion is mediated by an effect on the hypothalamus.\r"

As part of an investigation into the molecular mechanisms of such modulation we have examined the effects of surgical denervation of BAT and cold exposure (a treatment that increases neural stimulation of BAT) on the levels of mRNA encoding for the alpha-subunit of Gs, the GTP-binding protein that regulates adenylate cyclase. The G alpha s mRNA content of BAT per unit RNA was 5-10 times greater than that of lung, liver, or caudate-putamen. Surgical denervation of BAT of warm-adapted rats reduced G alpha s mRNA content by 30% within 8 h postsurgery and by 65% by 72 h. Concurrent infusion of norepinephrine completely prevented the denervation-induced decline in G alpha s mRNA at 72 h. Infusion of the beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol also prevented the denervation-induced decline in G alpha s mRNA, but infusion of the alpha 1-adrenergic agonist phenylephrine was without effect. Exposing rats to 4 C for 3 days approximately doubled the level of G alpha s mRNA. Interestingly, surgical denervation did not prevent the cold-induced increase in G alpha s mRNA levels, indicating that this effect is independent of local innervation. Despite reducing G alpha s mRNA levels by about 60%, surgical denervation failed to alter the concentration of G alpha s protein in IBAT membranes of warm-adapted rats, as determined by immunoblotting. Previous work indicates that cold exposure does not increase the concentration of G alpha s in IBAT membranes. Taken with the present results, these data indicate that there is no simple relationship between tissue G alpha s mRNA content and membrane G alpha s concentration in IBAT.\r"

  ".W": "To determine in neonates the effects of protein restriction on growth, serum IGF-I, and IGF-I gene expression, we adapted a technique for rearing neonatal rats (days 6-18 of life) artificially by continuous infusion of milk through a gastrostomy. The artificially reared (AR) animals were given isocaloric diets containing 8%, 13.5%, or 18% lactalbumin protein. The AR rats were compared to rats reared by their mothers (MR) for 18 days. The growth of AR rats was related to the amount of dietary protein, with the pups given 18% protein having the best growth (25.55 g gained during the 12 days of the study) and those given 8% protein having the worst (13.42 g). The 13.5% protein-fed animals were intermediate in weight gain (18.39 g). The weight gains of the 18% and 8% protein-fed pups were significantly different from that of the MR animals (18.37 g). An identical pattern of tail length growth was noted among the groups. Mean serum IGF-I concentrations followed the same pattern (MR, 1.66 U/ml on day 18 of life; 18% AR, 2.53; 13.5% AR, 1.52; 8% AR, 1.31). Liver IGF-I mRNA was rank-ordered identically with weight gain and serum IGF-I [MR, 23.10 pg/micrograms poly(A+) RNA; 18% AR, 27.66; 13.5% AR, 21.02; 8% AR, 18.76]. Unexpectedly, the 7.5-kilobase IGF-I mRNA size class showed a 2- to 3-fold higher abundance in all groups of AR rats compared to that in MR controls (P less than 0.01), suggesting that this IGF-I size class is regulated independently of the other species. The reductions in serum IGF-I and IGF-I mRNA during protein restriction of neonatal rats suggest that these responses are mediated by decreased IGF-I gene expression at the level of transcription or RNA stabilization.\r"

  ".W": "The nutritionally growth-retarded ovariectomized lamb provides a model system to investigate the regulation of immunoreactive and bioactive FSH release in the absence of feedback effects of ovarian products. We examined the acute effects of nutritional repletion on FSH release in this model. Five March-born lambs were weaned at 7 weeks of age and placed on a limited diet. All were ovariectomized at 31 weeks. At 37 weeks, they were fed ad libitum for 14 days. Blood samples were collected at 12 min intervals for 4 h on day -1 (restricted) and days 2, 7, and 14 of ad libitum feeding, and serum FSH concentrations were measured by both RIA and a Sertoli cell aromatase in vitro bioassay. Mean concentrations of serum immunoreactive FSH (I-FSH) and the bioactive FSH (B-FSH) increased 2- and 3-fold, respectively, after ad libitum feeding for 14 days. Pulse analyses by two objective computerized programs, DETECT and CLUSTER, revealed the presence of FSH pulses (predominantly B-FSH) during the restricted phase, as well as ad libitum fed phases, at times where I-LH pulses were not detected. In contrast to the increases in I-LH pulse frequency during ad libitum fed states, FSH pulse frequency remained stable whereas pulse amplitude increased. In addition, the overall B-FSH pulse amplitudes were 57 +/- 7% (mean +/- SE of three different pulse analyses) greater than I-FSH pulse amplitudes, implying preferential enrichment of FSH bioactivity. The results suggest that the mechanisms governing both the quantitative and qualitative changes in circulating FSH concentrations are extremely sensitive to changes in level of nutrition. The asynchronous occurrence of FSH pulses in the absence of I-LH pulses suggests that FSH may be more sensitive to small changes in GnRH secretion than I-LH, or that a hypothalamic releasing factor specific for FSH may be released.\r"

ANF (100 nM) inhibited PTH- and PGE2-stimulated cAMP production but had no effect on basal cAMP production in 21-day fetal rat calvaria. ANF increased cGMP levels, and this was not affected by PTH. ANF (10 nM) partially inhibited bone resorption stimulated by PGE2 but had no effect on control or PTH-stimulated resorption in 19-day fetal rat long bones. ANF had no effect on collagen and DNA synthesis or PGE2 production and did not alter responses to PTH or PGE2 in the fetal rat calvaria. Thus, ANF has no major direct effect on bone resorption or formation, but it is possible that ANF modulates the local regulatory function of PGE2 in bone.\r"

  ".W": "Expression of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) gene is stimulated by gonadotropins in granulosa cells. Because adrenergic agents interact with specific granulosa cell receptors to increase progesterone biosynthesis, the effects of these pounds on tPA activity and mRNA levels were also investigated. Cells obtained from immature estrogen-treated rats were initially cultured with FSH or medium alone for 2 days. They were then reincubated with various adrenergic agents before measurement of medium tPA activity using sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, followed by a fibrin overlay technique. In addition, cellular RNA was extracted, and tPA mRNA levels were analyzed using a specific rat cRNA probe. Isoproterenol, a beta-adrenergic agonist, stimulated the secretion of tPA activity in a dose-dependent manner, with FSH-pretreated cells secreting higher levels of the enzyme than cells without FSH priming. Northern blot hybridization of total RNA showed the accumulation of a 22S species tPA message in cells treated with isoproterenol, suggesting increased expression of the tPA gene. Furthermore, slot blot hybridization of RNA from these cells indicated a time-dependent increase in tPA mRNA, with maximal induction between 1-3 h of incubation. A selective beta 2-adrenergic agonist, terbutaline, but not the beta 1-agonist dobutamine, stimulated tPA activity. Also, the stimulatory effect of isoproterenol was blocked by a beta 2-antagonist (ICI-118,551) but not by a beta 1-antagonist (practolol), suggesting the involvement of a beta 2-receptor. Like FSH and LH, isoproterenol increased extra- and intracellular cAMP levels. Cotreatment of a saturating dose of isoproterenol with FSH or LH did not further stimulate tPA activity. Similar to that in cells treated with FSH, inhibition of protein synthesis by cycloheximide resulted in the superinduction of tPA mRNA in isoproterenol-treated cells. Thus, activation of beta 2-adrenergic receptors in granulosa cells induces tPA mRNA and activity, presumably through the protein kinase-A pathway shared by gonadotropins. Adrenergic neurotransmitters may be potential intraovarian regulators of this important protease.\r"

ROS cells treated with 10 nM [Nle8,Nle18,Tyr34] bovine (b) PTH-(1-34) amide (NlePTH) for 3 days showed loss of specific PTH binding and PTH-stimulated cAMP accumulation to 10% of that in vehicle-treated control cells. Treatment of these cells with both 0.5 mM 8-bromo-cAMP (8-Br-cAMP) and 1 mM methylisobutylxanthine or 100 ng/ml cholera toxin for 3 days elicited no change in either of these responses. Treatment with 10 nM NlePTH for 3 days did not modify the cAMP accumulation stimulated by 30 microM forskolin or 1 micrograms/ml cholera toxin, indicating that agonist-specific desensitization of PTH-stimulated cAMP accumulation is not due to diminished activity of either the stimulatory guanyl nucleotide regulatory subunit (Gs) or the catalytic subunit of the adenylate cyclase. Treatment of ROS cells with pertussis toxin (PT; 10 ng/ml) for 12, 24, 48, and 72 h increased specific PTH binding by 21%, 28%, 35%, and 39%. The increase in PTH binding was associated with a parallel increase in PTH-stimulated cAMP accumulation and was due to an increase in the number of PTH receptors. PTH receptor affinity remained constant (apparent Kd = 0.3 nM). PT treatment of the cells partially blocked agonist-specific PTH receptor down-regulation. PT catalyzed ADP ribosylation of 41K and 39K membrane proteins, consistent with the alpha-subunits of Gi and Go, respectively. In conclusion, agonist-induced PTH receptor down-regulation in ROS 17/2.8 cells is cAMP independent and can be reversed by PT treatment. PTH receptor expression in these cells appears to be under tonic inhibitory control by mechanisms involving a PT-sensitive G protein(s).\r"

  ".W": "The role of PRL in sexual maturation of female ferrets was examined in these studies. Longitudinal profiles of PRL secretion were obtained by thrice weekly blood sampling of intact female ferrets undergoing photoperiod-stimulated development as well as age-matched control females which remained in nonstimulatory short days. Two additional groups of intact females, one in each photocycle, were treated with the dopamine agonist drug bromocriptine throughout the study. The relationship between developmental changes in PRL secretion and the critical pubertal decrease in the efficacy of estradiol (E2) inhibitory feedback on LH secretion was studied by using additional groups of females which were ovariectomized and treated with E2 implants (OVX + E2). These latter females were housed in either long or short day photoperiods; some were treated with bromocriptine, the remainder were treated with the vehicle only. Results of this study revealed that PRL secretion in ferrets does not change acutely with an abrupt increase in day length. After 4 weeks of exposure to long days, however, a marked increase in PRL secretion occurred. This increased secretion of PRL was contemporaneous with the onset of pubertal ovarian activity in intact females and with the escape of LH from the negative feedback of E2 in OVX + E2-treated females. The further observation that pharmacological blockade of the long day-induced rise in PRL secretion also prevented the pubertal onset of ovarian activity suggested that PRL may play a critical role in the induction of puberty in this species. The mechanism by which bromocriptine prevented puberty induction was illustrated in the OVX + E2-treated ferrets in stimulatory photoperiod. The drug treatment prevented the pubertal decrease in the efficacy of E2 negative feedback on LH. These studies suggest an important interaction between the dopamine-PRL system and the GnRH-LH system in the regulation of sexual maturation of female ferrets.\r"

  ".W": "Melatonin signal transduction was examined in median eminence/pars tuberalis (ME/PT) explants from Djungarian hamsters. High affinity melatonin receptors in hamster ME/PT were first quantified by in vitro autoradiography using the potent melatonin agonist 125I-labeled melatonin ([125I]MEL). Scatchard analysis of [125I]MEL binding in ME/PT revealed high affinity receptors [dissociation constant (Kd) = 2.75 X 10(-11) M]. [125I]MEL binding was markedly reduced by guanine nucleotides; treatment with the nonhydrolyzable GTP analog guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) caused a 10-fold decrease in receptor affinity. Melatonin (10 nM) significantly inhibited forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation in ME/PT, but not in pituitary or pineal glands. In ME/PT explants, melatonin and 6-chloromelatonin inhibited forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation in a dose-dependent manner with similar potency (significant inhibition for each at concentrations greater than or equal to 100 pM). Serotonin significantly inhibited forskolin-stimulated cAMP levels only at doses greater than or equal to 100 microM. Inhibition of [125I]MEL binding in ME/PT by these three indolamines paralleled that determined for inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation. Pertussis toxin treatment (1 microgram/ml) blocked the ability of melatonin (10 nM) to inhibit forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation and significantly reduced [125I]MEL binding. Pertussis toxin ADP-ribosylated the alpha-subunits of at least two guanine nucleotide-binding proteins in ME/PT explants with molecular weights of approximately 40 K. Melatonin did not increase phosphodiesterase activity in ME/PT explants. The results strongly suggest that a signal transduction pathway for melatonin in mammals involves inhibition of adenylyl cyclase by a pertussis toxin-sensitive guanine nucleotide-binding protein.\r"

Under pentobarbital anesthesia, injection of GH-releasing factor clearly induced an increase in both plasma GH content and the number of exocytotic GH-immunopositive granules in the cells. The exocytotic events occurred from a part of the plasma membrane facing endocrine cells, including other somatotrophs, and other portions facing folliculo-stellate cells or the walls of blood vessels. When released from the plasma membrane, the GH-immunopositive secretory granules sometimes appeared to aggregate with each other and showed an irregular shape surrounded by a single unit membrane. The exocytotic secretory granules were released into the extracellular space, and then flowed into the sinusoids as irregularly shaped GH-immunopositive electron-dense masses. After reaching the vascular space via the intercellular spaces between the endothelial cells, the contents of each mass became diffusely dispersed into the blood stream, with concomitant disappearance of immunopositivity. The present study thus revealed the morphological aspects of the process of GH secretion from somatotrophs into the blood vessels.\r"

  ".W": "Serum levels of ionized calcium, 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD), and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D[1,25-(OH)2D], intact immunoreactive PTH and calcitonin were measured in the laboratory rabbit to evaluate the role of these calciotropic hormones in calcium homeostasis in this species. We confirm the finding of previous researchers that the resting serum ionized and total calcium concentrations are elevated in rabbits compared to those in other species (ionized calcium, 1.70 +/- 0.13 mmol/liter; total calcium, 3.23 +/- 0.25 mmol/liter). The serum calcium concentrations in animals maintained on a breeding farm or in the laboratory did not differ significantly despite nearly 3-fold higher levels of vitamin D in the feed at the farm, which were associated with 3- to 4-fold higher concentrations of 25OHD and 1,25-(OH)2D. Baseline intact PTH levels for the farm and laboratory populations also did not differ significantly and averaged 69.4 +/- 43.6 human pgeq/ml (laboratory animals, 52.1 +/- 28.4; breeding farm animals, 86.0 +/- 49.5 human pgeq/ml). Infusions of calcium gluconate or EDTA for 15 min into anesthetized animals in the laboratory induced dramatic reciprocal changes in the measured circulating levels of PTH. Calcium gluconate infusions (190-300 nmol/g BW) produced 50-85% increases in serum ionized calcium, which were accompanied by 74-91% decreases in PTH levels (from 68.8 +/- 29.2 at time zero to 10.1 +/- 3.1 human pgeq/ml at 15 min) as well as 7-fold increases in calcitonin levels. EDTA infusions (14-120 nmol/g BW) reduced serum ionized calcium by 9-49%, while PTH levels increased by 68-560% (from 61.4 +/- 32.3 at time zero to a maximum of 138 +/- 48.6 human pgeq/ml at 3 min). During the EDTA infusion, the PTH response was variable after 3 min despite further decreases in ionized Ca2+, indicating either exhaustion of PTH reserves or regulation of the secretory response by some parameter other than ionized calcium concentration per se. Thus, the rabbit appears to defend its serum ionized calcium concentration against hypo- and hypercalcemia by rapid changes in PTH secretion and calcitonin. Unlike other mammalian species, however, the changes in PTH occur at relatively high levels of calcium, suggesting that the parathyroid gland of the rabbit is reset to respond to changes in ionized Ca2+ within the physiological range in that species. The relative insensitivity of the rabbit parathyroid to extracellular calcium is analogous to that observed in primary hyperparathyroidism and may be a useful model to study the control of normal and abnormal PTH secretion.\r"

All animals had significantly higher plasma levels of GH and GRF and greater body weights than controls. Eight-month-old mice were killed, and the markedly enlarged pituitaries were studied by histology, immunocytochemistry, electron microscopy, and immunogold method, using double labeling at ultrastructural level. In all pituitaries, a massive hyperplasia, chiefly of mammosomatotrophs, was found. These bihormonal cells, containing GH and PRL, were demonstrated by light microscopy and ultrastructural immunocytochemistry. Electron microscopy revealed the presence of cells with characteristics of GH cells in three pituitaries and cells resembling human adenomatous mammosomatotrophs in the other three glands. All of these cells, regardless of their ultrastructural features, contained secretory granules heavily labeled for GH by immunogold technique; PRL labeling varied from cell to cell, with the predominance of a weak immunostaining and was colocalized with GH in secretory granules. These results indicate that chronic exposure to GRF excess leads to mammosomatotroph hyperplasia. It is suggested that GH cells proliferate and transform to mammosomatotrophs in response to GRF stimulation. Focal PRL cell hyperplasia noted in three pituitaries could also be due to a GRF effect. Longer exposure to GRF is needed to clarify whether GRF can cause adenoma.\r"

  ".W": "This work was undertaken to investigate the fetal adrenal corticoid secretory response to hypoxic stress in late gestation. Experiments were performed in two groups of fetal sheep of different gestational ages, group I, 129-132 (mean, 130) days and group II, 135-139 (mean, 136) days. Fetuses were prepared with chronic adrenal cannulas as well as peripheral arterial and venous catheters. With the fetus at rest and after 7, 9, 11 and, in some instances, 30 and 60 min of hypoxia (maternal FIO2 10%), precisely timed (2 min) samples of adrenal effluent were collected for determination of cortisol (F) and corticosterone (B) secretion rates. Peripheral samples were obtained intermittently for blood gas and lactate determinations. Resting corticoid secretory rates were highly variable, suggesting an episodic secretory pattern. Corticoid secretory responses to hypoxemia were significantly elevated at 7-11 min, peaked at 30 min, and remained stable at 60 min. Specifically, in group I, F secretion increased from a baseline value of 37 +/- 19 ng/min to a peak hypoxemic response of 376 +/- 80 ng/min; B secretion increased from 6 +/- 4 to 170 +/- 32 ng/min. In group II, F secretion increased from 99 +/- 20 to 653 +/- 107 ng/min; B secretion increased from 12 +/- 5 to 200 +/- 28 ng/min. When related to adrenal gland weight, there was no difference between F secretory responses in groups I and II, whereas relative B secretory responses were lower in group II than in group I at 9 and 11 min of hypoxemia. We conclude that the 129-139 day sheep fetal adrenal cortex is highly sensitive to hypoxic stress with the effect presumably mediated by elevated levels of endogenous ACTH. The B stress response decreases as gestational age advances from the 129-132 day range to 135-139 days.\r"

The FSH and LH responses to GnRH (5 micrograms/kg, iv bolus) increased significantly (p less than 0.05) by 117% and 55% after 48 h of activin-A, respectively. A small (16%), but statistically significant (p less than 0.05), increase in the T response to the GnRH challenge was also noted.

Inhibin subunit mRNAs were detected by Northern blot analysis of total RNA extracted from granulosa cell monolayers which had been incubated for 48 h in serum-free medium containing FSH (100 ng/ml) and/or a steroid (10(-6) M): estradiol (E), testosterone (T) or 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone (DHT). Levels of mRNA encoding each inhibin subunit in untreated (control) cultures were low. In cultures treated with FSH alone, levels of inhibin alpha-, beta A- and beta B-subunit mRNA were approximately 60-fold, 70-fold and 66-fold greater than control, respectively. In cultures treated with E alone, levels of inhibin alpha- and beta B-subunit mRNA were elevated approximately 4-fold and 2-fold, respectively, but the level of inhibin beta A-subunit mRNA was not measurably affected. Treatment with T or DHT alone had no consistent effect on the levels of any inhibin subunit mRNA. The stimulatory effects of FSH were not consistently altered by the presence of either androgen or estrogen. These results confirm the role of FSH in regulating inhibin alpha-subunit gene expression and provide direct evidence that both inhibin beta-subunit genes are inducible by FSH in granulosa cells. All three inhibin subunit mRNAs followed the same pattern, suggesting that their expression is coordinately regulated by FSH during granulosa cell differentiation.\r"

Clinical ES lasted 83.3 s on the average and were most frequent from day 7 to 9 of monitoring (42.3%) and during sleep (56.4%). PE were longer in duration (mean 724.5 s), most numerous during the first 2 days of monitoring (41.4%), and occurred exclusively during wakefulness.

To differentiate partial ES from PE or to establish the association of these disorders, EVA monitoring is best performed around the clock over a period of 1-2 weeks. The limited number of paroxysmal events, especially ES, signaled by the patients should be considered when designing studies of the effectiveness of pharmacologic, surgical, and other treatments.\r"

  ".W": "Terfenadine is a unique H1-receptor antagonist devoid of adverse central nervous system (CNS) effects. Terfenadine is highly protein bound and has been shown to stimulate hepatic microsomal enzymes, making an interaction with phenytoin (PHT) possible. After assuring constant PHT levels for 7 days, 12 epileptic patients were studied with PHT alone, after a single daily dose of terfenadine (60 mg twice daily), and again after 2 weeks of chronic terfenadine therapy. Samples for PHT were drawn over 24 h, and urine was collected for determination of the PHT metabolite 5-(p-hydroxyphenyl)-5-phenylhydantoin (HPPH). The pharmacokinetic parameters calculated for total and free PHT and HPPH were area under the time concentration curve (AUC), the maximum serum concentration (Cmax), the minimum serum concentration (Cmin), and the percentage of fluctuation between maximum and minimum concentrations. A factor analysis was used to clarify interrelationships. Five dependent variables were found to represent the data. These were assessed by multi-variate analysis of variance (MANOVA); p less than 0.05 was considered significant. No significant differences were observed for any of the parameters for the acute or chronic effects of terfenadine. We conclude that terfenadine does not interfere with PHT.\r"

ESM was able to prevent PTZ-, PICRO-, DMCM-, and beta-EMTBL-induced seizures. In contrast, VPA and alpha-EMTBL blocked all of these plus MESTBPS-, and BIC-induced convulsions. Only VPA prevented AMPH-induced seizures. None of the anticonvulsants blocked STR or NMDA seizures. Rotorod testing for acute neurotoxicity demonstrated that ESM was the least toxic and alpha-EMTBL and VPA were equivalent. Animals treated daily with high doses of alpha-EMTBL for a 2-week period appeared healthier and had a higher survival rate than animals treated with VPA in the same manner. After a single intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection, the duration of anticonvulsant action of alpha-EMTBL was 1.3 and 4 times longer than that of ESM and VPA, respectively. These results indicate that alpha-EMTBL has a wide spectrum of anticonvulsant action like VPA but may be less toxic and longer acting. We suggest that alpha-EMTBL is a compound worthy of further testing and development as an antiepileptic drug (AED).\r"

The temporal part of the macula and surrounding retina of the left eye were coagulated with an Argon laser and later confirmed histologically. In forebrain nonbisected baboons, intermittent light stimulation of the operated eye produced bisymmetrical and bisynchronous spikes and waves and self-sustained seizures. In forebrain-bisected baboons intermittent light stimulation of the operated eye produced spikes and waves and self-sustained seizures localized to the contralateral hemisphere. Subsequent stimulation of the nonoperated eye in the same animal produced spikes and waves and seizures either bilaterally or only in the opposite hemisphere when stimulation took place during the postictal silent period in the first hemisphere. In both cases, the tonic phase of the seizure was always bilateral but asymmetrical as shown by electromyographic recordings. Based on these data, it has been hypothesized that the tonic phase is mediated, in part, through crossed interreticular pathways, by one or both cerebral hemispheres. However, data are also compatible with a possible origin of the tonic phase of the seizure being partly localized in the medial frontal cortex. Results demonstrated (1) the usefulness of laser coagulation of the temporal portion of the macula and retina for the study of the functional independence between two cerebral hemispheres, (2) the critical role of the corpus callosum (CC) in bisynchronization and generalization of the intermittent light stimulation (ILS)-induced seizure, (3) independent excitability of each cerebral hemisphere by the ILS, and (4) the critical role of cortical visual afferents for inducing epileptic phenomena in this species.\r"

The diabetic patients' basal plasma triglyceride, total- and free- (unesterified) cholesterol, HDL cholesterol (HDL-chol), and apolipoprotein AI, AII, and B concentrations were similar to those of control subjects, but the free-cholesterol-to-lecithin ratio, a new index of cardiovascular disease risk, was significantly increased in their plasma (0.97 +/- 0.14 vs. 0.88 +/- 0.07, P less than .02) and their very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL)-low-density lipoprotein (LDL) subfraction (1.50 +/- 0.51 vs. 1.08 +/- 0.15, P less than .005).

  ".W": "Recombinant human interleukin 1 alpha (IL-1) has been found to induce prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) accumulation by isolated rat islets of Langerhans at concentrations similar to those at which the cytokine inhibits glucose-induced insulin secretion and islet glucose oxidation. Maximal stimulation of PGE2 accumulation (5 times control value) occurred at 200 pM IL-1, and half-maximal stimulation occurred at 25 pM IL-1. Significant augmentation of PGE2 accumulation by IL-1 required 10-18 h of exposure to the cytokine. Islets that had been pretreated with IL-1 for 18 h showed elevated rates of PGE2 production at basal (3-mM) and stimulatory (16.5-mM) glucose concentrations and converted exogenous arachidonic acid to PGE2 at twice the maximal rate of control islets. Exogenous PGE2 did not mimic the inhibitory effects of IL-1 on glucose-induced insulin secretion or glucose oxidation. To rule out the possibility that endogenous PGE2 is involved in the inhibitory effects of IL-1, the effect of a cyclooxygenase inhibitor on IL-1-treated islets was examined. Pharmacological blockade of PGE2 biosynthesis by 10 microM indomethacin did not influence the inhibitory effects of IL-1 on glucose-induced insulin secretion or glucose oxidation. Thus, exogenous PGE2 does not mimic the effects of IL-1 on islets, and inhibition of endogenous PGE2 biosynthesis does not suppress the effects of IL-1 on islets. These results suggest that PGE2 is not a principal mediator of the inhibitory effects of IL-1 on glucose-induced insulin secretion or glucose oxidation.\r"

  ".W": "This study investigated hemodynamic changes in diabetic rats and their relationship to changes in vascular albumin permeation and increased metabolism of glucose to sorbitol. The effects of 6 wk of streptozocin-induced diabetes and three structurally different inhibitors of aldose reductase were examined on 1) regional blood flow (assessed with 15-microns 85Sr-labeled microspheres) and vascular permeation by 125I-labeled bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 2) glomerular filtration rate (assessed by plasma clearance of 57Co-labeled EDTA) and urinary albumin excretion (determined by radial immunodiffusion assay). In diabetic rats, blood flow was significantly increased in ocular tissues (anterior uvea, posterior uvea, retina, and optic nerve), sciatic nerve, kidney, new granulation tissue, cecum, and brain. 125I-BSA permeation was increased in all of these tissues except brain. Glomerular filtration rate and 24-h urinary albumin excretion were increased 2- and 29-fold, respectively, in diabetic rats. All three aldose reductase inhibitors completely prevented or markedly reduced these hemodynamic and vascular filtration changes and increases in tissue sorbitol levels in the anterior uvea, posterior uvea, retina, sciatic nerve, and granulation tissue. These observations indicate that early diabetes-induced hemodynamic changes and increased vascular albumin permeation and urinary albumin excretion are aldose reductase-linked phenomena. Discordant effects of aldose reductase inhibitors on blood flow and vascular albumin permeation in some tissues suggest that increased vascular albumin permeation is not entirely attributable to hemodynamic changes. We hypothesize that 1) increases in blood flow may reflect impaired contractile function of smooth muscle cells in resistance arterioles and 2) increases in vascular 125I-BSA permeation and urinary albumin excretion reflect impaired vascular barrier functional integrity in addition to increased hydraulic conductance secondary to microvascular hypertension associated with decreased vascular resistance.\r"

  ".W": "Numerous studies indicate that an impaired hypothalamopituitary axis plays an important role in reproductive and thyroid disorders in diabetic humans and animal models. Yet, several questions about the pathogenesis of these diabetic complications have not been answered. To evaluate the basal secretion of single gonadotrophs and thyrotrophs in vitro, uncultured pituitary cells from control rats and 1-mo streptozocin-induced diabetic (STZ-D) rats were studied with a reverse hemolytic plaque assay and morphometry. After light-microscopy immunocytochemistry for gonadotropin and thyrotropin (TSH), we recorded the ratio of plaque-forming to non-plaque-forming cells. The area of plaques produced by luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and TSH cells and the area of plaque-forming and non-plaque-forming cells were clearly smaller in diabetic than control rats. The plaque area, however, was more severely reduced than the cell area. The percentage of LH-, FSH-, and TSH-immunoreactive plaque-forming cells was greatly decreased in diabetic compared with control animals. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that the LH-, FSH-, and TSH-secreting cells of diabetic rats released less hormone and were less numerous than the corresponding cells of control rats. Thus, several pathogenetic mechanisms might be involved in reduced gonadotropin and TSH release at the cellular level: 1) anatomical lesions of organelles involved in glycoprotein hormone synthesis and secretion, possibly due to insulin deficiency; 2) decreased gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) and thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) receptors on pituitary cells; 3) inadequate GnRH and TRH stimulation; 4) high plasma corticosterone levels; or 5) a combination of points 1-4.\r"

  ".U": "90006548\r", 
  ".W": "Chronic colitis is present in up to 50% of adult cotton-top tamarins, but the etiology is unknown. To explore one putative immunopathogenic pathway for the chronic colitis, we determined whether immune sensitization to macromolecules associated with mucosal epithelium of intestine (designated ECAC) had occurred in this primate species. Specifically, we sought to define (a) whether antigenic determinants associated with ECAC are present on tamarin gut epithelium in vivo; (b) if immunoglobulin, capable of binding ECAC, is detectable in tamarin serum; (c) whether the presence of ECAC-specific immunoglobulin is positively correlated with age of the animal or the severity of the colitis, or both; and (d) the number of glycoprotein fractions composing ECAC (denoted as P1 through P4) that are reactive with tamarin immunoglobulin. Expression of ECAC was found by immunofluorescence using characterized oligo-specific or monoclonal antibody: tamarin intestinal epithelium--but not lamina propria, muscularis mucosae, subserosa, or glycocalyx--demonstrated determinants of the ECAC antigen system. Furthermore, coded sera from 10 tamarins with biopsy-proven inflammation involving colonic intestinal mucosa and in which disease activity was moderate to severe showed ECAC-specific cytotoxicity of 3.6% +/- 1.6%. Test values for 9 of 10 of those animals were above the upper limit of normal for the assay (2.1%), and exceeded the level of lysis found with serum from histologically normal tamarins less than 2 yr old (less than 0.3%). When the data were reanalyzed by age of the animal, the incidence of ECAC-specific cytotoxicity correlated with age greater than 2 yr (r = 0.86, p less than 0.001). Epithelial cell-associated component-specific serum binding was confirmed by a second methodology (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay), where the A405 for tamarins with lesions of moderate-severe grade (0.35 +/- 0.26) clearly exceeded that for young tamarins who were histologically normal (0.02 +/- 0.039) (p less than 0.05). Most of the reactivity was directed toward the P1 fraction of ECAC. Thus, immune sensitization to a fraction of macromolecules associated with colonic epithelium has been found in the cotton-top tamarin, analogous to findings in humans with chronic inflammatory bowel disease.\r"

This finding had great potential importance, as no gene marker had previously been found to be strongly associated with inflammatory bowel disease. Therefore, an attempt to confirm it in an independent laboratory and patient population has been made in this study. Thirty patients with ulcerative colitis, 30 with Crohn's disease, and 30 healthy control subjects were studied using the Eco RV restriction enzyme and the same T-cell receptor alpha-chain complementary deoxyribonucleic acid probe as was used in the prior report. No 10-kilobase fragment or any other polymorphism using this probe-enzyme combination was found in any of the individuals studied. Polymorphisms were observed with the restriction enzyme Bgl II, but their frequencies did not distinguish between cases and controls. Therefore, there is as yet no evidence for an association between polymorphisms of Eco RV-digested genomic DNA probed with the pGA5 T-cell receptor alpha-chain complementary deoxyribonucleic acid and the predisposition to inflammatory bowel disease.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of Clostridium difficile toxin A and cholera toxin on fluid secretion, intestinal permeability, and arachidonate metabolites in rabbit ileum. Injection of 25 micrograms of either purified toxin into 10-cm ileal loops caused significant increases in fluid secretion and intestinal permeability to mannitol as well as release of prostaglandin E2 into the lumen. Toxin A, but not cholera toxin, caused a severe inflammatory reaction of the lamina propria and necrosis of enterocytes as well as increased release of leukotriene B4. The toxin A-mediated increases in prostaglandin E2 and leukotriene B4 could be blocked by prior instillation of 10 mg of 5-aminosalicylic acid into ileal loops. 5-Aminosalicylic acid also significantly diminished the expected increase in mannitol permeability after both toxins, but had no significant inhibitory effect on fluid secretion or, in the case of toxin A, intestinal inflammation. Our results indicate that C. difficile and cholera enterotoxins differ substantially in their effects on the rabbit intestine. Clostridium difficile toxin A, an inflammatory toxin, produces a striking infiltration of the lamina propria with neutrophils that is associated with increased release of leukotriene B4. In contrast, cholera toxin does not cause inflammation or leukotriene B4 release. Increased release of prostaglandin E2 occurs after exposure to both toxins and appears to be correlated with increased intestinal permeability.\r"

We have studied, in vitro, the effects of the component solutions of TPN on the induction and modulation of human monocyte procoagulant activity, an initiator of coagulation. Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells were cultured with (a) 200 microliters of dextrose solution (10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, and 50%), (b) 200 microliters of amino acid solution (full, one-half, and one-quarter strength), and (c) 200 microliters of isosmolar 10% lipid emulsion (LE). Cocultures of LE and 20% dextrose, LE and full-strength amino acid solution, and LE and bacterial lipopolysaccharide were also studied. Cells cultured with lipopolysaccharide or medium alone constituted positive and negative controls, respectively. In addition, cocultures of LE and 20% dextrose, LE and full-strength amino acid solution, and LE and lipopolysaccharide were also studied. Cells were incubated for intervals of 12-72 h, washed, frozen, and assayed for monocyte procoagulant activity (MPCA). Milliunits of MPCA were derived from a standard thromboplastin curve. In addition, spontaneous MPCA levels were measured in healthy volunteers (n = 4) and \"home\" total parenteral nutrition patients (n = 4) before and after a 2-h infusion of 500 ml of LE. Our results show that, in vitro, hypertonic dextrose and full-strength amino acid solutions induce significant levels of MPCA. Induction of MPCA by dextrose was lymphocyte-independent. Although a significant increase in MPCA by full-strength amino acid solution was seen in cultures of isolated monocytes, a lymphocyte requirement was demonstrated for full MPCA. In contrast, LE significantly inhibited the induction of MPCA by 20% dextrose and full-strength amino acid solution. This inhibitory activity was at the monocyte level. Subfractionation of the LE into triglyceride and phospholipid phases showed the inhibitory capacity to reside in the former. In vivo, patients on home total parenteral nutrition expressed higher spontaneous MPCA levels than normal controls. Ten percent lipid emulsion infusion abolished MPCA expression in both groups. These corroborative in vitro and in vivo data suggest a mechanism for the thrombogenicity of total parenteral nutrition solutions and that the inhibitory properties of LE may be of practical advantage in preventing thrombosis.\r"

  ".W": "Thrombosis is a common sequela of total parenteral nutrition. We have recently demonstrated in vitro that hypertonic total parenteral nutrition solutions are potent inducers of a tissue factor monocyte procoagulant activity, the initiating cofactor of the extrinsic clotting cascade. We have further studied, in vitro, the effects of the component solutions of total parenteral nutrition on the induction and modulation of endothelial cell procoagulant activity. Cultured porcine aortic endothelial cells were incubated with (a) 200 microliters of dextrose solution (5%, 10%, 20%, 25%, and 50%), (b) 200 microliters of amino acid solution [full strength (N), one-fourth strength, and one-half strength], and (c) 200 microliters of 10% lipid emulsion. Cocultures of lipid emulsion and 20% dextrose, lipid emulsion and full-strength 10% amino acid solution (N-amino acid), and lipid emulsion and bacterial lipopolysaccharide also were studied. Cells were incubated for intervals of 3-108 h, washed and frozen, harvested, and assayed for endothelial cell procoagulant activity. Units of endothelial cell procoagulant activity were derived from a standard thromboplastin curve. Our results show that amino acid and hypertonic dextrose total parenteral nutrition solutions are able to strongly induce endothelial cell procoagulant activity expression in vitro. In contrast, lipid emulsion significantly inhibited the induction of endothelial cell procoagulant activity by 20% dextrose, N-amino acid, and lipopolysaccharide. These results provide further evidence for the role of the cellular pathways of coagulation in total parenteral nutrition-induced thrombosis. Furthermore, the inhibitory properties of lipid emulsion may be of practical advantage in reducing total parenteral nut induced thrombosis.\r"

  ".W": "Humans with cholesterol gallstones have been reported to have alterations in the molecular species of phospholipids in bile. Both decreases in phospholipids with linoleic acid and increases in those with arachidonic acid have been found. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of a lithogenic diet (0.34% cholesterol) on the relative abundance of individual molecular species of phospholipids in the biliary tract of the prairie dog. In hepatic bile, cholesterol feeding resulted in increases in phospholipid species containing arachidonate and decreases in the major species containing its precursor, linoleate. In gallbladder bile of both control and cholesterol-fed animals, phospholipid species containing linoleate were significantly less abundant than in hepatic bile, suggesting that linoleoyl species were selectively absorbed by the gallbladder epithelium. This apparent uptake was significantly increased by cholesterol feeding. Phosphatidylcholines and phosphatidylethanolamines containing arachidonate were also significantly increased in the gallbladder mucosa of the cholesterol-fed animals. These increases in arachidonate-containing phospholipids in the gallbladder mucosa may contribute to the increase in gallbladder prostaglandin synthesis that precedes gallstone formation in this animal model.\r"

Eighty-four percent of the PEJ tubes failed and were functional for an average of only 39.5 days. The reasons for failure were: (1) separation of the inner PEJ tube from the outer gastrostomy tube (59%); (2) clogging (32%) due to small PEJ tube diameter; and (3) kinking and knotting (9%). Upper gastrointestinal bleeding occurred in 30% of the patients (7 of 23). Only one patient required blood transfusions (2 units). The etiology of the bleeding was not determined. These patients had a previous history of acid-peptic disease and bleeding occurred despite cimetidine treatment. In contrast, only 1 of the 16 nonbleeding patients had acid-peptic disease (p less than 0.0001) and none were on cimetidine. The frequency of aspiration pneumonia decreased from 13 episodes during nasogastric tube feedings to 5 episodes during PEJ tube feedings. Improvement in the design of the PEJ tubes may increase the longevity and effectiveness of the tubes.\r"

The current study tested the hypotheses that 1) acute volume-induced atrial natriuretic factor release is impaired in SHR-S compared with control NaCl-resistant SHR (SHR-R) and WKY rats maintained on basal (1%) NaCl diets; 2) dietary NaCl supplementation (8% NaCl for 2 weeks) alters acute volume-dependent atrial natriuretic factor release in these strains; and 3) replacement of the deficiency in circulating atrial natriuretic factor seen in NaCl-supplemented SHR-S can reverse the NaCl-sensitive component of hypertension. SHR-S and control SHR-R and WKY rats were placed on 1% or 8% NaCl diets at age 7 weeks; 2 weeks later, right atrial pressure and plasma atrial natriuretic factor were measured in conscious rats before and after acute volume expansion (7, 20, and 60 ml/kg, 5% dextrose, for 1 minute). The slopes of the right atrial pressure x plasma atrial natriuretic factor linear regression for the SHR-S fed both 1% and 8% NaCl were significantly shallower (p less than 0.01) than those of 1% NaCl-fed SHR-R or WKY rats. Dietary NaCl supplementation did not alter right atrial pressure in any strain and blunted acute volume-induced atrial natriuretic factor release in WKY rats, but not in SHR-S or SHR-R, suggesting the dietary NaCl-induced elevation in plasma atrial natriuretic factor levels in WKY rats may be related to impaired clearance, as well as enhanced release, of the peptide. The plasma levels of exogenous atrial natriuretic factor required to abolish the NaCl-induced pressor effect in SHR-S were 12-fold greater than endogenous plasma atrial natriuretic factor levels in 8% NaCl-fed WKY rats, suggesting that impairment of atrial natriuretic factor release does not play a major role in the pathogenesis of NaCl-sensitive hypertension in SHR-S.\r"

In this study, the effects of different intracellular concentrations of ethylene glycol-bis-N,N,N',N',-tetraacetic acid (EGTA) on Ca2+ currents were investigated. Vascular muscle cells from SHR and WKY rats were equilibrated with pipette solution containing 0.1 mM or 10 mM EGTA. Increasing the EGTA concentration from 0.1 to 10 mM in SHR vascular cells significantly enhanced the peak amplitude of the longer lasting (L) current from 87 +/- 12 pA to 152 +/- 8 pA, while the transient (T) current amplitude was not significantly different (52 +/- 7 pA and 36 +/- 7 pA, respectively). In WKY rat vascular muscle cells, the amplitudes of the T and L currents were not significantly different with the same comparison of intracellular EGTA concentrations. These observations suggest that relatively low intracellular Ca2+ concentrations can more strongly modulate Ca2+ current through the L channel in SHR than WKY rat vascular muscle cells.\r"

Postnatal changes in the response of the central neural respiratory circuits to afferent inputs may have a role in the age-related incidence of apnea. Therefore we determined the central neural apneic threshold to CO2 and superior laryngeal nerve (SLN) stimulation in halothane-anesthetized newborn (4- to 7-day-old) and older (45- to 56-day-old) lambs. The animals were vagotomized, paralyzed, and mechanically ventilated with hyperoxic gas. Phrenic nerve activity served as a monitor of central respiratory output. The CO2 and SLN apneic thresholds were defined as the arterial PCO2 when phrenic activity began after hyperventilation, and the quantity of current applied to the SLN that abolished phrenic activity, respectively. At equivalent concentrations of halothane, newborn lambs had higher CO2 apneic thresholds (P less than 0.05) and lower SLN apneic thresholds (P less than 0.05) than did older lambs. Increasing concentrations of halothane decreased (P less than 0.05) the SLN apneic threshold and increased (P less than 0.05) the CO2 apneic threshold. Equal incremental changes in halothane concentration induced similar changes in the apneic thresholds of both ages of lambs. The data suggest that with maturation, the central neural respiratory circuits become more responsive to CO2 and less responsive to SLN afferents. Halothane alters central neural responsiveness to these inputs in both ages similarly.\r"

In another study, resting animals in the various groups were injected with thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH; 2 micrograms/kg for males and 0.4 microgram/kg for females) to determine pituitary prolactin responsiveness. In males, exercise induced a significant increase in plasma prolactin levels, with the greatest increase observed in the least trained and the smallest increase in the most highly trained animals. Female rats displayed the opposite trend with the greatest increase in prolactin secretion observed in the highest trained and the smallest increase observed in the least trained animals. TRH induced similar increases in plasma prolactin in all male groups, whereas TRH-induced prolactin release was greatest in the highest trained and smallest in the least trained females. The reduced prolactin response in highly trained males may reflect their acclimation to repetitive exercise stress, whereas the enhanced response in the highly trained female rats appears to result from increased pituitary sensitivity to prolactin-releasing factors.\r"

This led to elevations in pulmonary arterial pressure and to pulmonary edema as measured by extravascular wet-to-dry weight ratios. The increase in pressure and edema was prevented by indomethacin, a cyclooxygenase enzyme inhibitor, and by 1-benzylimidazole, a selective inhibitor of thromboxane (Tx) A2 synthesis. Transvascular flux of 125I-albumin from vascular to extravascular spaces of the lung was not elevated by A23187 but was elevated by infusion of oleic acid, an agent known to produce permeability pulmonary edema. We confirmed that A23187 leads to elevations in cyclooxygenase products and that indomethacin and 1-benzylimidazole inhibit synthesis of all cyclooxygenase products and TxA2, respectively, by measuring perfusate levels of prostaglandin (PG) I2 as 6-ketoprostaglandin F1 alpha, PGE2, and PGF2 alpha and TxA2 as TxB2. We conclude that release of endogenous pulmonary arachidonic acid can lead to pulmonary edema from conversion of such arachidonic acid to cyclooxygenase products, most notably TxA2. This edema was most likely from a net hydrostatic accumulation of extravascular lung water with an unchanged permeability of the vascular space, since an index of permeability-surface area product (i.e., transvascular albumin flux) was not increased.\r"

DMTU (1-10 mM) completely blocked stable oxidants and hypochlorous acid formation by phorbol myristate acetate- and zymosan-stimulated neutrophils. DMTU also provided complete inhibition when incubated with cell-free supernatants after the formation of the MPO products. DMTU prevented the oxidative inactivation of alpha 1-antitrypsin by neutrophil-stable oxidants. Evidence that DMTU was oxidized by the MPO products was obtained by titration of oxidized DMTU with reduced glutathione. Surprisingly, supernatants from cells incubated with DMTU (10 mM) consumed two- to threefold higher amounts of reduced glutathione than supernatants from cells incubated with taurine (15 mM). Metabolic studies with stimulated neutrophils and experiments with the MPO enzyme system in a cell-free system suggested that DMTU acts by scavenging the products of the MPO pathway rather than by blocking H2O2 production in the intact cell. These findings demonstrate that DMTU blocks the neutrophil MPO pathway in addition to its known ability to scavenge other reactive O2 species. The capacity of DMTU to scavenge MPO products may explain some of its protective effects in acute lung injury.\r"

A relationship between increases in blood sulfhydryl levels, lung injury, and O2 metabolite generation during exposure to hyperoxia was suggested by two observations. First, increases in blood sulfhydryl levels occurred simultaneously with increases in lung oxidized glutathione (GSSG) levels and lung GSSG-to-GSH ratios (GSSG/GSH). Second, hyperoxia-induced increases in blood sulfhydryl levels, blood hematocrits, pleural effusion volumes, lung GSSG levels, and lung GSSG/GSH were decreased by pretreating rats with dimethylthiourea (DMTU), an O2 metabolite scavenger. Our findings indicate that exposure of rats to hyperoxia increases blood acid-soluble sulfhydryl levels in vivo and that increases in blood sulfhydryl levels may provide an accessible marker of increased oxidant exposure and/or oxidant-mediated lung injury.\r"

  ".W": "It has been assumed that increases in both O2 uptake and ventilation occurring within the first few seconds after the onset of exercise cannot be the result of changes in blood gas composition reaching the central circulation because of the circulatory delay from the exercising limbs (A. Krogh and J. Lindhard, J. Physiol. Lond. 42: 112-136, 1913). We sought to validate this assumption by measuring the time course of pulmonary arterial blood gases during the transition from rest to exercise. Six healthy men underwent pulmonary arterial catheterization and then performed transitions from rest to moderate cycle ergometer exercise. An anaerobic sampling manifold withdrew 19 samples of blood during the rest-to-exercise transition; sampling interval was usually 4 s. Blood gas analysis showed that, on average, from rest-to-steady-state exercise, O2 saturation (Svo2) fell from 71 to 41% and mixed venous PCO2 (PvCO2) rose from 42 to 59 Torr. Contrary to our expectations, Svo2 decreased and PvCO2 increased with no discernible latency after exercise onset (by 10% and 2 Torr, respectively, within 6 s). The half time for the Svo2 decrease was 32 s, whereas for the PvCO2 increase it was 80 s. The time course of superior vena cava blood gas composition was determined in several experiments; no rapid changes after exercise onset were found. We conclude that at exercise onset there is a rapid fall in Svo2 and rise in PvCO2 well in advance of arrival of blood produced by exercising legs.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The ET pigs had increased exercise tolerance, heart weight-to-body weight ratio, and skeletal muscle oxidative capacity. After anesthesia the left anterior descending coronary artery was cannulated and pump perfused with blood while aortic, central venous, and coronary perfusion pressures, electrocardiogram, heart rate, and coronary blood flow were monitored. Capillary permeability-surface area product (PS) for EDTA was determined with the single-injection indicator-diffusion method by use of an organ model based on the Sangren-Sheppard equations for capillary transport. Coronary blood flow (CBF) and PS were compared before and during maximal adenosine vasodilation with coronary perfusion pressures at 120 mmHg. Results indicate that there were no differences in base-line CBF or PS between C and ET groups. alpha-Receptor blockade with phentolamine and/or prazosin, before adenosine vasodilation, produced increases in PS in C pigs but had little effect in ET pigs. During maximal vasodilation with adenosine, ET pigs had greater CBF (447 +/- 24 vs. 366 +/- 27 ml.min-1.100 g-1) and greater PS (83 +/- 9 vs. 55 +/- 7 ml.min-1.100 g-1) than the C group. It is concluded that ET induces an increased coronary transport capacity in miniature swine that includes a 22% increase in blood flow capacity and a 51% increase in capillary exchange capacity.\r"

Under mild hypoxia, inspiratory minute ventilation during sleep showed an initial rapid increase (P less than 0.001) but then declined significantly (P less than 0.001) and stabilized. Stable levels differed among individuals and, compared with those measured before hypoxia, were significantly lower in some subjects, higher in one, and essentially unchanged in the others. The initial rapid increase in minute ventilation after mild hypoxia during sleep correlated with the respective values of hypoxic ventilatory response during the awake state (P less than 0.01), but the final lowered levels did not. We conclude that the ventilatory response after mild hypoxia during sleep is biphasic and hypoxic depression exerts considerable influence on ventilation under mild hypoxia during sleep. So we should take hypoxic depression into consideration to evaluate the response to hypoxia during sleep.\r"

Lambs undergoing a hypoxic ventilatory test [0.08 inspired O2 fraction (FIo2) for 13 min] experienced no apnea or PB in hypoxia, but all developed PB during the 1-min period immediately after their abrupt return to 0.21 FIo2. This PB occurred when alternation of arterial PO2 and PCO2 in mild hypoxic and hypocapnic conditions induced an overshoot-undershoot response of the chemical drive to breathe. The magnitude of PB was found to be greater in the animals with a higher peripheral chemoreflex sensitivity to hypoxia but ceased altogether when the hypoxic-hypocapnic conditions were resolved. When these conditions were removed more quickly, that is, when the animals were returned either to 0.50 FIo2 or to 0.03 FIco2, no PB was observed. To clarify the role of hypoxia as a central depressant on the genesis of PB, we tested to determine whether additional central tissue hypoxia, using carboxyhemoglobin (30%), would worsen the episodes of PB. No effect on breathing rhythmicity was observed. These findings suggest not only that, in newborn animals and adults, the mechanisms of post-hypoxia-induced PB are identical but that the PB elicited in mild hypoxic conditions is a peripheral chemoreflex-mediated event rather than a centrally mediated one.\r"

Basal ANF was decreased to 65% in the clonidine group compared with both the control and dihydralazine groups.

Volume loading increased plasma cGMP levels by 40% in the control and clonidine-treated groups and by 25% in the dihydralazine-treated group. It is concluded that ANF may contribute to hemodynamic effects of clonidine but not to those of dihydralazine. Dihydralazine increases plasma and urinary cGMP, supposedly by direct activation of the soluble guanylate cyclase.\r"

If this is also the cause during sleep, decreased CO2 stimulus may easily induce apnea, hypopnea, and disordered breathing. To test this hypothesis, six male volunteers were examined to compare sleep disorders during both nose-open and nose-obstructed conditions. End-tidal PCO2 during nose-obstructed sleep was lower than that during nose-open sleep in all of the subjects. Furthermore apnea during nasal obstruction occurred most frequently shortly after transition to a deeper sleep stage. These results suggest that diminished PCO2 stimulus combined with depressed behavioral activity play an important role for disordered breathing in nose-obstructed sleep.\r"

  ".W": "We compared the changes in nasal and pharyngeal resistance induced by modifications in the central respiratory drive in 8 patients with sleep apnea syndrome (SAS) with the results of 10 normal men. Upper airway pressures were measured with two low-bias flow catheters; one was placed at the tip of the epiglottis and the other above the uvula. Nasal and pharyngeal resistances were calculated at isoflow. During CO2 rebreathing and during the 2 min after maximal voluntary hyperventilation, we continuously recorded upper airway pressures, airflow, end-tidal CO2, and the mean inspiratory flow (VT/TI); inspiratory pressure generated at 0.1 s after the onset of inspiration (P0.1) was measured every 15-20 s. In both groups upper airway resistance decreased as P0.1 increased during CO2 rebreathing. When P0.1 increased by 500%, pharyngeal resistance decreased to 17.8 +/- 3.1% of base-line values in SAS patients and to 34.9 +/- 3.4% in normal subjects (mean +/- SE). During the posthyperventilation period the VT/TI fell below the base-line level in seven SAS patients and in seven normal subjects. The decrease in VT/TI was accompanied by an increase in upper airway resistance. When the VT/TI decreased by 30% of its base-line level, pharyngeal resistance increased to 319.1 +/- 50.9% in SAS and 138.5 +/- 4.7% in normal subjects (P less than 0.05). We conclude that 1) in SAS patients, as in normal subjects, the activation of upper airway dilators is reflected by indexes that quantify the central inspiratory drive and 2) the pharyngeal patency is more sensitive to the decrease of the central respiratory drive in SAS patients than in normal subjects.\r"

Large and small blood vessel resistances and compliances were studied in lungs given concentrations of acetylcholine ranging from 2.0 ng/ml to 200 micrograms/ml. The results of this study indicate that acetylcholine dilates large arteries at low concentrations (less than or equal to 20 ng/ml) and constricts small and large veins at concentrations of at least 2 micrograms/ml. Characterization of acetylcholine's effects at constant pulmonary blood flow indicates that 1) large artery vasodilation may be endothelial-derived relaxing factor-mediated because the dilation is blocked with methylene blue; 2) a vasodilator of the arachidonic acid cascade (blocked by ibuprofen), probably prostacyclin, lessens acetylcholine's pressor effects; 3) when vascular tone was increased, acetylcholine's hemodynamic effects were attenuated; and 4) acetylcholine decreased middle compartment and large vessle compliance under control but not elevated vascular tone. Under constant pressure at control vascular tone acetylcholine increases resistance in all segments except the large artery, and at elevated vascular tone the pressor effects were enhanced, and large artery resistance was increased.\r"

In 12 chronically instrumented fetal lambs, we therefore investigated potential mediation of the bradykinin response by PGI2 or other cyclooxygenase products. A 15-min infusion of bradykinin (approximately 1 microgram/kg estimated fetal wt/min) increased fetal pulmonary blood flow by 522% (P less than 0.05) and decreased pulmonary vascular resistance by 86% (P less than 0.05); plasma 6-ketoprostaglandin F1 alpha (6-keto-PGF1 alpha) concentration also increased (P less than 0.05). After cyclooxygenase inhibition by indomethacin (3 mg), bradykinin increased pulmonary blood flow by only 350% (P less than 0.05) and decreased pulmonary vascular resistance by 83% (P less than 0.05); plasma 6-keto-PGF1 alpha concentrations did not increase. The increase in pulmonary blood flow produced by bradykinin was greater before administration of indomethacin than after (P less than 0.05). These studies demonstrate that bradykinin produces fetal pulmonary vasodilation by at least two mechanisms, one dependent on and the other independent of PGI2 production, the latter mechanism predominating.\r"

In decerebrate, vagotomized, paralyzed, and ventilated cats, phasic triangularis sterni neural activity was evident in normocapnia. In most cats, activity did not commence until midexpiration. Activity then rose progressively to terminate at end expiration. Peak neural activities increased in parallel with phrenic activity in hypercapnia and fell in hypocapnia. The progressive increase in triangularis sterni neural activity within each respiratory cycle resulted from recruitment of motoneuronal activities throughout expiration. Once recruited, many motoneurons had a decrementing or constant discharge frequency. In hypercapnia, motoneuronal discharge frequencies increased, and additional activities were recruited. The number of active motoneurons and their discharge frequencies fell in hypocapnia. A similar pattern of motoneuronal activities and responses to stimuli was observed in cats with intact vagi. Factors are considered that may underlie the recruitment pattern of triangularis sterni motoneuronal activities and the inhibition of these in early expiration.\r"

Intra-arterial ANF injections lowered base-line perfusion pressures and blunted hypoxia- and ANG II-induced pressor responses in the isolated lungs. Bolus intravenous injection of ANF (10 micrograms/kg) into intact rats decreased CO and arterial blood pressures of both systemic and pulmonary circulations and increased Rsa. ANG II (0.4 micrograms/kg) increased both Rsa and Rpa, and hypoxia increased Rpa alone in the intact rats. ANF (10 micrograms/kg) inhibited both ANG II- and hypoxia-induced increases in Rpa but did not significantly affect the ANG II-induced increase in Rsa. The antagonistic effect of ANF on pulmonary vasoconstriction was reversible and dose-dependent. The threshold doses of ANF required to inhibit pulmonary vasoconstriction were in the same range as those required to elicit diuresis and natriuresis. The data demonstrate that ANF has a preferential relaxant effect on pulmonary vessels constricted by hypoxia or ANG II. Both the renal and the pulmonary vascular effects of ANF may represent fundamental physiological actions of ANF. These actions may serve as a negative feedback control system that protects the right ventricle from excessive mechanical loads.\r"

This study was designed to evaluate the relative importance of various peripheral tissues as sites of ANF action by tracing the temporal pattern of distribution of 125I-ANF and quantitating the specific binding sites. An in vivo approach, utilizing trace amount of 125I-ANF was adopted to simulate physiological conditions. 125I-ANF injected either intravenously or intra-arterially was quickly bound to peripheral tissues with less than 5% remaining in the circulation after 1 min. The relative binding capacity was greatest in the lung, followed by the kidney, right ventricle, adrenal gland, and left ventricle. The magnitude of specific ANF binding sites per gram of tissue weight followed a similar order. The data demonstrate that ANF released under all circumstances is quickly bound to the target organs, particularly the lung and the kidney, and suggest that these two organs could be the most important target organs of ANF. This evidence provides further support for the proposed hypothesis that a major evolutionary role of ANF is the protection of the right ventricle from mechanical loads.\r"

Regional blood flow and cardiac output were determined by a reference sample method, injecting 15 microns radiolabeled microspheres. During the initial 24 hours after burn injury, animals were given the same volume by continuous infusion of either lactated Ringer's solution (LR group) or a liquid diet (20% protein, 12% lipid, and 68% carbohydrate; 175 kcal/kg/24 hr) (diet group). Although cardiac outputs in the LR and diet groups were not different from each other at 24 hours and no less than that in unburned control animals, the diet group showed higher blood flow to the jejunum (+55.7%) and cecum (+98.7%) than did the LR group. Burn injury caused little change of blood flow to tissues other than the intestine. In addition, early feeding after burn injury suppressed excessive cortisol response to burn shock. The increase in gut blood flow associated with enteral feeding could have an impact on mucosal barrier function.\r"

A previous study suggested that intravenous supplementation to attain nutritional requirements was of no benefit in patients with cutaneous burns covering greater than 50% of their total body surface area. In this study 39 patients with burns greater than 50% of their total body surface area were randomly assigned to receive intravenous supplementation of enteral calories (n = 16) or enteral calories alone (n = 23). Intravenous supplementation decreased the amount of enteral calories that patients with burns could tolerate. The mortality rate was significantly higher (p less than 0.05) in the intravenously supplemented group at 63% as compared with 26% in the group receiving enteral calories alone. Both groups showed significant decrease in natural killer cell activity when compared with controls at both 0 to 7 and 7 to 14 days after injury. T cell helper/suppressor ratios were depressed in both groups when compared with controls; however, the intravenously supplemented group was significantly depressed at 7 to 14 days after burn. Both groups demonstrated hepatomegaly, moderate fatty infiltration, and cholestasis. It is suggested that intravenous supplementation should be carefully evaluated and used only in patients with total enteral failure.\r"

In this article two new drugs, prostaglandin I2 analog OP-41483 (Venopirin) and thromboxane synthetase inhibitor OKY-046 (Cataclot), were tested in addition to aspirin in animal experiments with rabbits. The rabbits were divided into five groups and measurements made before and 8 and 24 hours after burn injury. The results indicate that platelet reduction and renal dysfunction occur within 8 hours after thermal injury in the no-therapy group and renal dysfunction could not be prevented completely even by adequate infusion therapy, but treatment with OP-41483 proved to suppress platelet reduction and improve renal function. Improvement in renal function was also noted in animals treated with aspirin or OKY-046, but platelet reduction could not be prevented by these drugs. Analysis of the time course of changes in thromboxane B2 level and 6-keto prostaglandin F1 alpha level disclosed that animals treated by infusion showed an elevation in thromboxane B2 and a significant elevation in the thromboxane B2/6-keto prostaglandin F1 alpha ratio, whereas animals treated with these three drugs showed a reduction in the thromboxane B2/6-keto prostglandin F1 alpha ratio. These results indicate that an effective measure for prevention of dysfunction of the organs after thermal injury is treatment with drugs that can modify the arachidonate cascade and cause an absolute or relative reduction in TXA2.\r"

  ".W": "Dynamic changes in serum immunoreactive (ir) inhibin levels during the transition from the luteal to the follicular phase (luteal-follicular transition) were characterized during 3 consecutive cycles in 12 cycling women. Both spontaneous (first to second cycle) and GnRH antagonist-imposed premature luteolysis (second to third cycle) were evaluated. Serum FSH, LH, estradiol (E2), and progesterone (P4) levels were monitored daily by RIA for the entire study. Daily ir-inhibit levels were determined from 7 days before until 7 days after the onset of menses and from 4 days before to 10 days after the GnRH antagonist-induced bleeding by a heterologous RIA. During spontaneous luteolysis, ir-inhibin levels peaked 7 days before menses and declined in a linear fashion (r = -0.99) thereafter, reaching a sustained low level 1 day after the onset of menses. The decline of P4 and E2 levels appears to be coupled to that of ir-inhibin (r = 0.98 and r = 0.95, respectively). FSH levels showed an inverse pattern, with an acute elevation unaccompanied by LH, for 5 days before the onset of menses and reaching a plateau 2 days after. ir-Inhibin and FSH were negatively correlated (r = -0.87; P less than 0.0001). Increased LH levels did not occur until the day of menses and were negatively correlated with ir-inhibin (r = -0.50; P less than 0.05), but not E2 and P4. During the second cycle, at the midluteal phase luteolysis was induced by a single (50 micrograms/kg) im injection of a potent GnRH antagonist, [Ac-D2Nal,D4ClPhe2,D3Pal3,Arg5,DGlu6(AA),+ ++DAla10] GnRH; an acute decline of LH and FSH levels occurred, with maximal suppressions of 51% and 35%, respectively. ir-Inhibin levels decreased rapidly (40 +/- 2.8%) in parallel with E2 and P4 during the first 24 h and continued to decline for 4 days. The inverse relationship and time course of changes between FSH and ir-inhibin levels were similar to those of the spontaneous luteal-follicular transition. Six of the 12 subjects experienced partial reversal of luteolysis; the decline of ir-inhibin and the rise of FSH during the first 2 days were arrested for 4 days, which corresponded to the rebound increases in E2, P4, and LH. The subsequent fall of ir-inhibin was followed by a rise in FSH. Both the complete and incomplete luteolysis groups exhibited an orderly follicular maturation, LH surge, and luteal function during the ensuing cycle.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "To investigate the actions of acute and chronic low doses of ethinyl estradiol (EE) on the pulsatile characteristics of GH and gonadotropin release we studied seven girls with Turner's syndrome [mean age, 7.5 +/- 0.75 (+/- SE) yr] on 3 separate study days. At baseline (study I), blood was drawn every 20 min from 2000-0800 h for GH, LH, and FSH determinations. One month after study I the patients were started on 100 ng/kg EE, orally, daily, and an identical study was repeated 1 week (study II) and 5 weeks (study III) from the initiation of low dose EE therapy. A pulse detection algorithm, Cluster, was used to objectively analyze pulsatility profiles. There were consistent and significant increases in all seven patients after 5 weeks of low dose EE therapy in mean GH concentrations (study I, 7.0 +/- 1.1 micrograms/L; study III, 13.4 +/- 1.7; P = 0.008), mean area under the GH pulse (study I, 602 +/- 52 micrograms/L.min; study III, 1350 +/- 261; P = 0.026), and mean GH pulse amplitude (study I, 14.0 +/- 2.2 micrograms/L; study III, 32.8 +/- 6.0; P = 0.018); with no detectable changes in GH pulse frequency (study I, 5.3 +/- 0.6 pulses/12 h; study III, 5.3 +/- 0.4). These findings were not accompanied by any significant changes in plasma somatomedin-C or serum estradiol concentrations or urinary cytological maturation indexes. Conversely, the amount of radioimmunoassayable FSH activity was suppressed after low dose EE therapy, with a decrease in mean FSH concentrations (study I, 23.5 +/- 6.6 IU/L; study III, 5.9 +/- 1.2; P = 0.035) and mean pulse amplitude (study I, 28.6 +/- 8.6 IU/L; study III, 8.2 +/- 1.8; P = 0.038), with no detectable changes in FSH pulse frequency (study I, 7.6 +/- 0.6 pulses/12 h; study III, 7.3 +/- 0.6). Similar qualitative changes in LH pulsatility were observed after low dose estradiol administration. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that low dose EE therapy results in a significant augmentation of pulsatile GH activity, with reciprocal decreases in gonadotropin concentrations in girls with Turner's syndrome. Such observations indicate an exquisite sensitivity of gonadotrope and somatotrope function to low dose estrogen action in this prepubertal hypogonadal model.\r"

The use of Compazine as an antiemetic produced classic dystonic manifestations which resolved rapidly after discontinuation and treatment with Artane. However, he later developed a variety of neurobehavioral disturbances which led to his admission to the hospital. Extensive diagnostic procedures failed to identify any gastrointestinal or neurological causes. His condition unceasingly worsened until hypocortisolemia was serendipitously discovered, and all of his symptoms disappeared rapidly and completely with glucocorticoid replacement. Over the course of hospitalization, other than a single episode of orthostatic hypotension, the patient did not manifest any signs of adrenal insufficiency or endocrinopathy. Although detectable, his plasma ACTH level was markedly low in the presence of hypocortisolemia. His adrenal function was subnormal in the cortisol response to ACTH stimulation. His renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and catecholamine levels were normal. He had normal pituitary responses to GnRH, TRH, and insulin, with rises in plasma levels of LH, FSH, TSH, PRL, and GH, but no stimulation of ACTH. Repeated CRH tests revealed no stimulation of ACTH and cortisol. No circulating anti-ACTH, antiadrenal, or antipituitary antibody was detected. We conclude that this elderly patient had a rare syndrome of selective corticotroph dysfunction which resulted in secondary adrenal failure and exacerbated his mental and neuromuscular abnormalities. To our knowledge, these symptoms, which clearly relate to hypocortisolism, have not been previously reported.\r"

Five girls with previously untreated precocity showed significant decreases in basal serum estradiol and FSH levels and in peak LH levels (after GnRH testing) 30 days after a single im dose of leuprolide acetate for depot suspension. Mean peak FSH levels also fell greatly, but the difference was not significant. No adverse effects were noted during the first 4-6 months of monthly im injections.

  ".U": "90009217\r", 
  ".W": "There is evidence that the capacity to synthesize gonadotropins is less in teenage boys with gonadotropin deficiency (GD) than in those with constitutional delay of puberty (DP). We hypothesized that this might predispose the latter group to have a greater pituitary-testicular response to the potent long-acting GnRH agonist nafarelin. We evaluated GD patients 14.3-24.0 yr of age (n = 8) and prepubertal DP boys 14.8-17.6 yr of age (n = 3). In most subjects the response to nafarelin was compared to that of frequent nocturnal blood sampling for LH and testosterone levels. All subjects received a single dose of nafarelin (1.0 micrograms/kg, sc), and blood was then sampled at 0.5- to 4.0-h intervals for 24 h. Patients with GD could not be distinguished from those with DP by pubertal staging criteria or by baseline values of LH, FSH, or testosterone. Patients with GD exhibited no rise in plasma LH levels during sleep, in contrast to those with DP. All GD patients had LH and FSH responses distinctly less than those of the DP group between 3-24 h postnafarelin. The peak incremental responses of GD and DP to nafarelin were, respectively: LH, 5.5 +/- 2 3 (+/- SEM and 77.2 +/- 8.6 IU/L (P less than 0.02); FSH, 2.7 +/- 1.2 and 9.4 +/- 0.8 IU/L (P less than 0.005). Testosterone peak responses were lower as well (0.26 +/- 0.2 vs 1.6 +/- 0.5 nmol/L, P = 0.05). This pilot study suggests that the response to a single test dose of nafarelin distinguishes GD from DP in the teenage years as well as does measurement of nocturnal LH levels. The testosterone response to the GnRH agonist adds a new dimension to GnRH testing. Nafarelin also allows assessment of the bioactivity of endogenous gonadotropin, is a more potent stimulus of pituitary-testicular function than endogenous GnRH secretion, and is more cost-effective than nocturnal sampling.\r"

  ".W": "It is presently accepted that high circulating steroid levels during pregnancy suppress pituitary immunoreactive FSH (I-FSH) secretion from early pregnancy to term. In this study we tested the hypothesis that bioactive FSH (B-FSH) in the sera of pregnant women would likewise be suppressed. Serum samples were obtained from one woman daily for 21 days after the I-LH surge, and in a second, every 10 min for 10 h on days 10, 20, and 27 after the I-LH surge. Single serum samples were also obtained from women at 2-41 weeks of gestation. In all samples, I-LH/hCG, I-FSH, B-FSH, progesterone (P), and estradiol (E2) were measured. In the first woman, serum I-FSH levels were suppressed from days 9-21 after the LH surge (0.2 +/- 0.04 ng/mL; 1.9 +/- 0.3 IU/L), whereas serum B-FSH increased linearly from 1.7 ng/mL (5.3 IU/L) on day 9 post-I-LH surge to 6.0 ng/mL (18.6 IU/L) on day 17 (r = 0.91; P less than 0.01) and remained elevated through day 21. In the second woman, the mean +/- SE of the serum I-FSH concentrations were 0.7 +/- 0.04, 0.1 +/- 0.01, and 0.1 +/- 0.01 ng/mL (5.5 +/- 0.3, 0.9 +/- 0.1, 1.1 +/- 0.1 IU/L) on days 10, 20, and 27 post-I-LH surge, respectively. The mean serum B-FSH concentrations increased from 3.1 +/- 0.2 ng/mL (9.6 +/- 0.7 IU/L) on day 10 to 7.5 +/- 0.6 ng/mL (23.2 +/- 1.7 IU/L) on day 27. Using the DETECT pulse analysis method at the 0.01 confidence level, the serum I-FSH pattern was relatively nonpulsate, while serum B-FSH averaged 8, 7, and 10 pulses/10 h on post-LH surge days 10, 20, and 27. Incremental peak amplitudes were 3.5 +/- 0.7, 4.6 +/- 0.4, and 8.0 +/- 1.3 ng/mL (10.9 +/- 2.2, 14.3 +/- 1.2, and 24.8 +/- 4.0 IU/L), respectively. In the cross-sectional study, serum I-FSH levels remained low, while serum B-FSH concentrations increased from 4.2 +/- 0.8 ng/mL (13.2 +/- 2.5 IU/L) during the early first trimester to 59.3 +/- 2.9 ng/mL (183.8 +/- 9.0 IU/L) by the late third trimester. There was no correlation between serum B-FSH and hCG levels. Incubates of term placentae secreted B-FSH in preference to I-FSH (i.e. B-FSH, 33.0 +/- 9.6 ng/h/g placental tissue; I-FSH, 0.7 +/- 0.1 ng/h/g).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "During the period of lactation there is a need for a reliable method of contraception since the suppressive effects of lactation on ovulation decline as the duration of breastfeeding is decreased. The aim of this study was to establish that chronic treatment with a LHRH agonist would prevent ovulation throughout the period of lactation and to evaluate the effects of the treatment on estrogen production, bleeding patterns, and nursing practice. Starting 6 weeks postpartum, nine mothers took 300 micrograms LHRH agonist (buserelin), intranasally once daily for the remainder of the duration of breastfeeding [216 +/- 18 days (mean +/- SEM)]. Urinary excretion of LH, estrone, and pregnanediol was compared to that of nine control breastfeeding mothers. In the control subjects follicular development, as assessed by rises in estrone, was minimal during the first 90 days of the study. Thereafter, phases of estrogen secretion were observed. Ovulation occurred in seven of the nine mothers on one to six occasions; time to first ovulation varied from 90-296 days. In the women taking buserelin, LH and estrone were initially stimulated for 1 and 2 weeks, respectively, then declined to basal levels. No ovulations occurred in the treated group. In six treated mothers only minor fluctuations in estrone were observed during the remainder of agonist treatment. In three subjects more frequent and sustained episodes of estrogen secretion were observed, but in contrast to the controls the rises in estrone were not followed by a typical LH surge or a rise in pregnanediol. Bleeding occurred in eight of the nine of the control mothers on one to seven occasions during the study period. The first bleed in five of the mothers was anovular, while other menstrual bleeds occurred in response to falling levels of pregnanediol. Of the mothers taking buserelin, one was amenorrhoeic, and five had only one light bleeding associated with the initial stimulation of estrone. Of the three women with continued fluctuations of estrone, one had three light bleeds, one experienced frequent spotting, while one had regular bleeding. No other side-effects, such as hot flashes or changes in nursing practices, were reported. Our results indicate that LHRH agonist treatment has the potential to be developed as an acceptable method of contraception during the postpartum period. The duration of treatment may be long enough to have a significant effect on maternal-infant well-being without encountering significant problems associated with low estrogen output.\r"

Lipocytes were isolated from normal rat liver and established in primary culture. The cells synthesize and secrete a neutral proteinase, which by gelatin-substrate gel electrophoresis and gel filtration chromatography, has a molecular mass of 65,000 D. The enzyme is secreted in latent form and is activated by p-aminophenylmercuric acetate but not by trypsin. Enzyme activity in the presence of EDTA is restored selectively by zinc and is unaffected by serine-protease inhibitors. In assays with radiolabeled soluble substrates, it degrades native type IV (basement membrane) collagen but not interstitial collagen types I or V and exhibits no activity against laminin or casein. At temperatures causing partial denaturation of soluble collagen in vitro, it rapidly degrades types I and V. Thus, it is both a type IV collagenase and gelatinase. The enzyme may play a role in initiating breakdown of the subendothelial matrix in the Disse space as well as augmenting the effects of collagenases that attack native interstitial collagen.\r"

  ".W": "Activation of human neutrophils (PMN) is accompanied by rapid upregulation of CR1, the C3b receptor, and CR3, the iC3b receptor, which also serves as the PMN's major adherence protein. This is necessary for migration and phagocytosis, but the extent of expression of these proteins on PMN at inflammatory sites has not been determined. We used monoclonal antibodies and flow cytometry to assess CR1 and CR3 expression on PMN in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients chronically infected with pseudomonas and in sterile joint fluid of arthritis patients. Resting peripheral blood PMN from these patients and normals expressed similar low levels of CR1 and CR3, and the patients' PMN increased CR1 and CR3 expression normally when stimulated in vitro. CR3 expression on CF BAL PMN was 90 +/- 12% of that on the same patient's blood cells stimulated in vitro with FMLP. In contrast, CR1 expression on BAL PMN was only 27 +/- 8% of that on stimulated blood cells. Similar results were obtained for joint PMN. This pattern could be reproduced in vitro by treating FMLP-stimulated blood cells with BAL supernatants or with pseudomonas or PMN elastase. The serine protease inhibitors, PMSF and alpha 1-antitrypsin prevented the lavage supernatant from reducing CR1 expression, while metalloprotease inhibitors had no effect. Treatment of PMN with elastase in vitro decrease their ability to kill opsonized Pseudomonas aeruginosa. These results suggest that PMN at inflammatory sites have maximally upregulated expression of their complement receptors, but that CR1 is then cleaved by proteolysis in situ. Although not related to the basic defect in CF, this may interfere with efficient phagocytosis and contribute to the CF patient's inability to eradicate chronic lung infection.\r"

  ".W": "In proximal tubular cells ischemia is known to result in the redistribution of apical and basolateral domain-specific lipids and proteins into the alternate surface membrane domain. Since tight junctions are required for the maintenance of surface membrane polarity, the effect of ischemia on tight junction functional integrity was investigated. In vivo microperfusion of early loops of proximal tubules with ruthenium red (0.2%) in glutaraldehyde (2%) was used to gain selective access to and outline the apical surface membrane. Under control situations ruthenium red penetrated less than 10% of the tight junctions. After 5, 15, and 30 min of ischemia, however, there was a successive stepwise increase in tight junction penetration by ruthenium red to 29, 50, and 62%, respectively. This was associated with the rapid duration-dependent redistribution of basolateral membrane domain-specific lipids and NaK-ATPase into the apical membrane domain. Taken together, these data indicate that during ischemia proximal tubule tight junctions open, which in turn leads to the lateral intramembranous diffusion of membrane components into the alternate surface membrane domain.\r"

Only products containing high ethyl alcohol had consistently high antimicrobial activity regardless of the test method, test organism, or contact time used both in the absence and presence of bioburden. Although these specific formulations demonstrated ability to penetrate and inactivate high concentrations of microorganisms within heavy bioburden, optimum disinfection of environmental surfaces is highly formulation dependent. Other products tested showed deficiencies that contraindicate their use as environmental surface disinfectants in clinical dental settings.\r"

  ".U": "90009737\r", 
  ".W": "Technetium-99m isonitrile is a new myocardial perfusion imaging agent that accumulates according to the distribution of myocardial blood flow. However, unlike thallium-201, it does not redistribute over time. This imaging agent was used with serial quantitative planar imaging to assess the initial risk area of infarction, its change over time and the relation to infarct-related artery patency in 30 patients with a first acute myocardial infarction. Twenty-three of 30 patients were treated with recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) within 4 h after the onset of chest pain. Seven patients were treated in the conventional manner without thrombolytic therapy. Technetium-99m isonitrile was injected before or at the initiation of thrombolytic therapy, and imaging was performed several hours later. These initial images demonstrated the area at risk. Repeat imaging was performed 18 to 48 h later and at 6 to 14 days after the onset of myocardial infarction to visualize the ultimate extent of infarction. The initial area at risk varied greatly (range defect integral 2 to 61) both in patients treated with rt-PA and in those who received conventional treatment. For the total group, the initial imaging defect decreased in size in 20 patients and was unchanged or larger in 10 patients. Patients with a patent infarct-related artery had a significantly greater decrease in defect size than did patients with persistent coronary occlusion (-51 +/- 38% versus -1 +/- 26%, p = 0.0001). All patients with a decrease in defect size greater than 30% had a patent infarct-related artery. In 12 patients who also had predischarge quantitative exercise thallium-201 imaging, good agreement existed between the extent and severity of myocardial perfusion defect on the last technetium-99m isonitrile study before discharge and that noted on delayed thallium-201 imaging. It is concluded that serial planar technetium-99m isonitrile myocardial imaging in patients with acute myocardial infarction undergoing thrombolytic therapy offers a new quantitative noninvasive approach for assessment of the initial risk zone as well as the success of reperfusion.\r"

  ".W": "Current limitations of recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) therapy for acute myocardial infarction include failure to achieve recanalization in 25% of patients, reocclusion and reperfusion injury. Iloprost, a stable analogue of prostacyclin (PGI2), has been demonstrated to facilitate thrombolysis and reduce myocardial stunning in experimental models. To evaluate combined therapy, rt-PA (100 mg 3 h) and Iloprost (2 ng/kg per min for 48 h) were administered to 25 patients and then rt-PA alone (same dose) was given to an additional 25 patients with evolving myocardial infarction. At 90 min after drug administration, infarct-related vessel patency was observed in 11 (44%) of 25 who received rt-PA plus Iloprost compared with 15 (60%) of 25 who received rt-PA alone (p = 0.26). At 1 week, reocclusion had occurred in 3 (14%) of 21 patients who received combined therapy compared with 6 (26%) of 23 patients treated with rt-PA alone (p = 0.46). Ejection fraction increased significantly from baseline to 7 days for rt-PA alone whereas it decreased with combined therapy (rt-PA alone whereas it decreased with combined therapy (rt-PA alone: 47.3 +/- 11.5% at baseline to 50.4 +/- 9.8% at 7 days; rt-PA plus Iloprost: 51.3 +/- 10.1% at baseline to 49.0 +/- 9.4% at 7 days; difference between groups p = 0.05). At 4 h after therapy, fibrinogen decreased 33% for rt-PA plus Iloprost compared with a 52% for rt-PA alone (p = 0.001). Fibrinogen degradation products increased 60% more for rt-PA alone than for rt-PA plus Ilprost. Thus, the combination of rt-PA plus Iloprost at the doses employed did not improve immediate or follow-up coronary artery patency or left ventricular functional recovery compared with that achieved with rt-PA alone.\r"

The patients were studied in control conditions and after 2 to 12 days of treatment. Encainide increased the AH interval from 67 +/- 10 to 82 +/- 23 ms (p less than 0.02). Anterograde Wenckebach cycle length was increased in three patients, reduced in four, unchanged in one; it was not measurable in the remaining patients because tachycardia was induced. Retrograde Wenckebach periodicity increased from 307 +/- 71 to 401 +/- 92 ms (p less than 0.005) in all nine patients in whom it was measurable; complete retrograde block was observed in one patient. At the control study, tachycardia was induced in all patients, with a mean cycle length of 341 +/- 50 ms; after encainide, tachycardia was inducible in only 1 patient, with an increase in cycle length from 270 to 320 ms; in the other patients, tachycardia was not inducible because of a lack of retrograde (11 patients) or anterograde (2 patients) conduction. The mean plasma concentrations of encainide and its metabolites O-demethyl-encainide and 3-methoxy-O-demethyl-encainide measured in 13 patients during the repeat study were 161 +/- 304, 128 +/- 100 and 95 +/- 85 ng/ml, respectively; three poor metabolizers who presented a high concentration of the parent compound were observed in this series.

All patients were lymphopenic. The percentage and absolute number of blood T-lymphocytes (CD3) were low in two children and normal in the other children. The percentage and absolute number of helper/inducer lymphocytes (CD4) were markedly reduced in all patients. The percentage of suppressor/cytotoxic lymphocytes (CD8) was normal or elevated in all children, and the absolute number of CD8 cells was normal in three patients. The CD4/CD8 ratio was reversed in all patients. In the two patients tested, the proliferative response of peripheral blood mononuclear cells to mitogens was reduced. T-lymphocyte subsets were measured in the pleural or peritoneal fluid of three patients, and the CD4/CD8 ratio was normal or increased. In each child, the CD4/CD8 ratio in the lymphatic fluids was markedly higher than the CD4/CD8 ratio of the blood (4.0/0.45, 1.75/0.95, and 1.3/0.85). The reversed CD4/CD8 ratio in the blood in cases of chronic loss of chyle may be due to either selective transport of CD4 lymphocytes into the lymphatic fluids or a shorter half-life of CD8 compared to CD4 lymphocytes. This finding may in part explain the abnormal cellular immunity previously observed in patients with lymphangiectasia.\r"

  ".W": "We have demonstrated that human peripheral blood basophils released histamine on direct incubation with paramyxoviruses in vitro. Most histamine release occurred during the first 15 to 30 minutes after challenge, depending on the dose of virus used; release initiated by virus was complete by 1 hour. At a virus/cell ratio of 1:1, Sendai virus caused 41 +/- 9% histamine release, whereas parainfluenza type 3 (PI-3) virus caused 25 +/- 5% release and respiratory syncytial (RS) virus caused 19 +/- 5% release. Sendai, but not PI-3 or RS, also caused a decrease in cell number and release of lactic dehydrogenase; however, this apparent cell lysis did not account for all the histamine released. Incubation of cells with virus desensitized them to subsequent triggering by viruses but did not affect response of cells to other stimuli. Histamine release was dependent on the virus/cell ratio, temperature, and metabolic energy, but it was not strictly dependent on the presence of calcium in the extracellular medium. Histamine release was not affected by preincubation of cells with colchicine, suggesting that microtubules were not involved in the release process. Basophils desensitized by anti-IgE in the absence of calcium or treated with lactic acid to dissociate IgE molecules from membrane receptors released amounts of histamine similar to that of control basophils; thus, release was not initiated through Fc epsilon receptors. It was found, however, that histamine release by these viruses was greatly reduced when concanavalin A was used for desensitization. These data demonstrate that the respiratory viruses studied can cause direct nonimmunologic release of histamine from human basophils. Our findings provide evidence for another mechanism by which respiratory viruses can initiate inflammation.\r"

These studies suggested that intravenous immune globulin therapy might be a useful modality in altering immunoregulation in patients with collagen vascular autoimmune disease. In the present preliminary study, two groups of patients with collagen vascular disease were chosen: systemic lupus erythematosus and primary Sjogren's syndrome. Patients with systemic lupus erythematosus with mild clinical disease were chosen to minimize the risk of adverse effects on the disease process, particularly specific organ involvement (e.g., lupus nephritis). Each patient was used as his or her own clinical and laboratory control. Patients received 300 mg/kg of intravenous immune globulin every 4 weeks. As a whole the patient group did not experience any adverse effects from the intravenous immune globulin therapy. No clinical or laboratory changes were observed in one patient with systemic lupus erythematosus and one patient with Sjogren's syndrome. In the other patient with Sjogren's syndrome, there were subjective changes of improved well-being and increased energy levels without any objective changes in the sicca syndrome. There was a slight steroid-sparing effect (10 to 3 mg/day) but no effects on the sedimentation rate, the antinuclear antibody, or rheumatoid factor serologic studies. In a patient with steroid-dependent systemic lupus erythematosus, there was marked clinical improvement of the cutaneous vasculitis after the third infusion, with reduction in her oral steroid requirements from 25 to 7.5 mg/day.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

On the basis of that criterion, 8.6% (no. = 16) of the 185 patients were classified as malnourished. Although patients were classified as malnourished, malnutrition was among several comorbidity and complication (CC) factors, and, therefore, coding for malnutrition in any of these cases would not have increased hospital reimbursement. If malnutrition had been the only CC factor, hospital reimbursement would have been enhanced.\r"

Two hundred thirty-six responses were received. Respondents reported an increase in the use of enteral nutrition support for inpatients between 1984 and 1986. In 1986, tertiary-care hospitals also reported greater use of parenteral nutrition support and tube feeding for inpatients and home patients than did primary-care hospitals. Tertiary-care hospitals also reported higher staffing in 1986 than did primary-care hospitals in the following areas: clinical, nutrition support, and outpatient dietitians and dietetic technicians. Greater use of enteral and parenteral support for inpatients was noted by large hospitals as well as greater staffing in the following areas: clinical managers; nutrition support, clinical, outpatient, and home care dietitians; and dietetic technicians. However, the ratio of patients to RDs was greater in large than in small hospitals. There was no significant difference in patients:RD ratio between tertiary-care and primary-care hospitals. The only difference between responses from for-profit and nonprofit hospitals was in the number of nutrition support RD positions, which was larger in the nonprofit hospitals. Utilization of nutrition support for inpatients or home patients was not different for hospitals in different profit categories.\r"

Four levels of success with a corresponding indicator for evaluation were identified as: I. Management Action--management implements data and reports; II. Management Change--management initiates use of system to find solutions to problems; III. Management Uses Analytical Approach--management uses system as a routine part of problem-solving; and IV. Management Change in Task-management's role changes as a result of the computer system. Five computer functions were identified for evaluation: integrity, performance, use, efficiency, and effectiveness. Criteria, measurements, standards, and actual sections were then developed for each function. An instrument was developed on the basis of the evaluation, including forms, questionnaires, learning experiences, and scenarios. The instrument was then applied to two computer foodservice management systems--a custom-designed system and a packaged software system. The instrument was applied to software systems by the scenario method. Five criteria with key indicators were developed to determine successful application of the instrument. The evaluation model and the final instrument developed and applied in this study should be useful to dietitians evaluating a computer system 6 to 12 months after implementation in their foodservice.\r"

  ".W": "Enteral alimentation can be an effective feeding modality for use in the treatment and prevention of nutritional deficiencies. Although specialized commercial products are available for use with various disease states, many institutions are forced to restrict their enteral formularies to more conventional products in order to control costs. Nevertheless, the institutions do occasionally need a more specialized feeding. Although the details of calculating a modular feeding are commonplace for many dietitians, for others the concept is quite foreign. It is possible to individualize a modular feeding using conventional commercial formulas and common enteral modules. A method is presented for calculating such modular feedings using a step-wise approach. The limiting factors for the feeding are considered individually, starting with the most limiting factor. The patient's requirements for energy, protein, and macro- and micronutrients are also taken into consideration. The need for vitamin-mineral supplementation is determined, and the stability and osmolality of the formula are evaluated.\r"

Stepwise discriminant analysis indicated that manual dexterity explained 51% of the variance in the sisters' residential living site (ie, nursing home, retirement home, or living in community). The discriminant analysis equation using manual dexterity predicted living site correctly for 63% of the sisters in the nursing home with a specificity of 99%, a positive predictive value of 96% and negative predictive value of 84%. The addition of age and mental status to the equation improved the prediction only slightly.\r"

Two-dimensional nonequilibrium gel electrophoresis of invariant chain and class II Ag immunoprecipitates isolated from [32P]orthophosphate-labeled cells demonstrates labeling of both free and class II-associated gamma, gamma s, and p41 forms of the invariant chain. The gamma 2/gamma 3 form of the invariant chain is not phosphorylated. Phosphoamino amino acid analysis of isolated invariant chain shows phosphorylation of serine residues. The isolation of invariant chain from 32P-labeled microsome preparations digested with proteinase K demonstrates that the phosphorylation occurs in the cytoplasmic tail. Limited proteolysis of [32P]orthophosphate-, [35S]cysteine-, and [35S]methionine-labeled invariant chain also indicates that the 32P-label is incorporated into the cytoplasmic domain. These results pinpoint serine residues at positions 9, 26, and 29 in the N-terminal cytoplasmic tail as potential sites for the phosphorylation of the invariant chain. Phosphorylation may be another mechanism by which the functions of invariant chain in class II-dependent immune responses are regulated.\r"

To remove this N-linked carbohydrate, Asn-297, the oligosaccharide attachment residue, was changed to either Gln (a conservative replacement) or His for IgG1 or Lys for IgG3 (nonconservative replacements) by site-directed mutagenesis. Carbohydrate-deficient antibodies are properly assembled and secreted and bind Ag and protein A. However, aglycosylated IgG are more sensitive to most proteases than their corresponding wild-type IgG, indicating some conformational changes have occurred. Aglycosylated IgG do not bind to the human Fc gamma RI and do not activate C; depending on the isotype, C1q binding ability is either completely lost (IgG1) or dramatically decreased (IgG3). The serum half-life in mice of aglycosylated IgG1-Gln remains the same as wild-type IgG1, 6.5 +/- 0.5 days, whereas aglycosylated IgG3-Gln has a shorter half-life, 3.5 +/- 0.2 days, compared to that of wild-type IgG3, 5.1 +/- 0.4 days. These results indicate the carbohydrate interposed between CH2 domain of human IgG is necessary to maintain the appropriate structure for the maintenance of many of the effector functions dependent on the CH2 domain.\r"

  ".W": "Three rat mAb, RR3-15, RR3-16, and RR3-18, were established by fusing spleen cells from a rat immunized with the male Ag-specific cytolytic T cell clone, OH6, to mouse myeloma cells. The mAb was identified by their capacity to focus the cytolytic activity of the OH6 CTL clone on nonspecific target cells via FcR-FcR interaction. That all three mAb recognized the OH6 TCR was confirmed by immunoprecipitation studies in which each antibody precipitated a 90 kDa disulfide-linked heterodimer characteristic of the TCR. Surface immunofluorescence staining of a panel of T cell lines and splenic T cell populations showed that RR3-16 reacted not only to the OH6 T cell clone but also to a minor fraction of normal T cells. This reactivity was found to be due to the expression of a gene in the V alpha 3 family. However, RR3-16 did not react with all T cell lines and clones known to express genes from the V alpha 3 family. cDNA sequences of three independent RR3-16+ T cell hybridomas analyzed by polymerase chain reaction were identical to the previously published V alpha 3 sequence of the CTL clone C9. Thus, the mAb RR3-16 is specific for a single member of the TCR V alpha 3 gene family. Analysis of the expression of RR3-16+ TCR in CD4+ and CD8+ subsets of peripheral T cells demonstrated preferential expression on CD8+ T cells, suggesting regulated expression of this particular TCR V alpha gene.\r"

  ".W": "Exogenous activators of protein kinase C such as PMA in combination with a Ca2+ ionophore (A23187), cause secretion in rat basophilic (RBL-2H3) cells,but they do so through stimulatory signals that are not the same as those generated by Ag or oligomers of IgE. On the one hand, the synergy between PMA and A23187 and the suppression of Ag-mediated signals (hydrolysis of inositol phospholipids and rise in concentration of cytosolic Ca2+) by PMA were totally dependent on protein kinase C. The loss of synergistic and inhibitory actions of PMA, for example, correlated with the loss of protein kinase C (as determined by immunoblotting techniques) when cells were continuously exposed to PMA. Furthermore, the permeabilization of RBL-2H3 cells resulted in the loss of both protein kinase C and the inhibitory action of PMA, but both were retained if cells were exposed to PMA before permeabilization Ag-induced secretion, on the other hand, was not as dependent on the presence of protein kinase C. The potent inhibitor of this enzyme, staurosporine, which blocked completely the secretory response to the combination of PMA and A23187, did not inhibit Ag-induced secretion except at concentrations (greater than 10 nM) that inhibited Ag-stimulated hydrolysis of inositol phospholipids as well. Also RBL-2H3 cells still showed some secretory-response (approximately 25% of normal) to Ag when cells were depleted (greater than 98%) of protein kinase C by prolonged treatment with PMA. Previous studies have indicated that the secretory response to PMA and A23187 is much lower than that elicited by Ag when the concentrations of stimulants were matched to give the same increase in concentrations of cytosolic Ca2+.\r"

  ".U": "90010137\r", 
  ".W": "It is well known that Fc gamma R mediate the rapid release of agents of inflammation and, in addition, play an important role in the uptake of stimulatory antibody complexes. Activation of the FcR for human IgG1 (Fc gamma RI) on human monocytic cells triggers a transient activation of the NADPH oxidase. In this study, we tested the possibility that transience of the NADPH oxidase activation might have been the result of rapid internalization of cross-linked Fc gamma RI. Stimulatory receptor moieties were formed by cross-linking Fc gamma RI with receptor-specific mAb that are known to trigger superoxide anion release. The formation of the stimulatory receptor units was determined by quantitating the rate of superoxide anion production through its reduction of cytochrome c. This rate has been found to correlate with the rate of binding of cross-linking antibody and, therefore, the rate of formation of the stimulatory moieties (receptor aggregates). Internalization of cross-linked Fc gamma RI was measured by quantitation of cell-associated FITC-labeled Fc gamma RI-specific mAb resistant to acid elution. We found that cross-linking antibody bound to Fc gamma RI continued to be taken up by the cells well after cessation of oxidase activity. The constant rate of uptake and the differential effect of temperature on these two functions suggested that they are separately regulated. Quantitation of cross-linked receptors that were inactive, i.e., no longer stimulating superoxide anion production, indicated that 50% of internalizable, and therefore cross-linked, Fc gamma RI remained on the surface after oxidase activity had ceased. This evidence of cessation of oxidase activity before the endocytic uptake of mAb/R stimulatory units indicates that the activated state of surface cross-linked Fc gamma RI is of brief duration and that occupation of the receptors by cross-linking-ligand does not sustain the activated state of the receptor. Thus, Fc gamma RI-mediated oxidase activation is temporally limited to the formation of the stimulatory receptor moiety.\r"
