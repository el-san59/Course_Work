  ".W": "9704 ambulatory women aged 65 years or older were prospectively studied to determine whether low bone mineral density (osteopenia) was associated with mortality. Bone mineral density was measured at entry to the study by single-photon absorptiometry. 299 women died during a mean of 2.8 years' follow-up. Osteopenia was associated with increased non-trauma mortality, probably because it is a marker for several other adverse factors. Each standard deviation decrease in proximal radius bone mineral density (0.104 g/cm2) was associated with a 1.19-fold increase in mortality (95% confidence interval 1.04-1.36), adjusted for age and duration of follow-up. Diminished bone mineral density at the proximal radius was strongly associated with deaths from stroke (relative risk = 1.74; 95% CI 1.12-2.70), an association that was not confounded by history of previous stroke, hypertension, postmenopausal use of oestrogen, thiazide diuretic treatment, diabetes mellitus, and smoking. Most deaths in women with low bone mineral density are unrelated to the occurrence of fractures-an observation that should be taken into account when estimating the need for and cost-effectiveness of bone-density screening and fracture prevention programmes.\r"

  ".W": "Among the cytostatic drugs only the alkylating agents have been firmly established as being leukaemogenic. This report describes 4 cases of acute myeloid leukaemia and 1 of myelodysplasia occurring in a cohort of 212 patients with germ-cell tumours treated with etoposide, cisplatin, and bleomycin. The mean cumulative risk of leukaemic complications was 4.7% (SE 2.3) 5.7 years after start of etoposide-containing chemotherapy, and, compared with the risk in the general population, the relative risk of overt leukaemia was 336 (95% CI 92-861). No leukaemias were detected in a previous cohort of 127 patients with germ-cell tumours treated with cisplatin, bleomycin, and vinblastine. The increased risk of leukaemia was most probably due to etoposide alone or in combination with cisplatin or bleomycin, since other published work has also not revealed an excess of leukaemias among patients with germ-cell tumours treated with only cisplatin, bleomycin, and vinblastine. The risk of leukaemia was dose related since all 5 patients with leukaemic complications were among the 82 who had received a cumulative dose of more than 2000 mg/m2 etoposide, whereas no leukaemias were observed among 130 patients who had received up to 2000 mg/m2 (p = 0.004). 3 of the leukaemic patients had balanced chromosome translocations affecting bands 11q23 and 21q22. These translocations, and perhaps also other balanced aberrations, seem to be characteristic of myelodysplasia and acute leukaemia occurring after therapy with cytostatic agents acting on DNA-topoisomerase II.\r"

  ".U": "91318894\r", 
  ".W": "Modified fiber tips are used for laser angioplasty of totally occluded peripheral arteries. It has not been established, however, to what extent the mechanism of action of various laser probes is optical, thermal, or mechanical. We examined transparant contact probes (hemispherical contact probes and ball-shaped fibers) and metal laser probes, coupled to a continuous-wave Nd-YAG laser. By using homogeneous thick porcine fatty tissue samples submerged in blood plasma, tissue penetration was measured in relation to the temperature of the probe and the axial force exerted on the tissue. By using 15 W, 1 s laser pulses, the surface of transparent contact probes had to be first contaminated by carbonized tissue particles to achieve tissue penetration. Penetration increased from 1 to 10 mm per pulse when axial force increased from 20 to 100 g. Metal probes had to be sufficiently insulated from the liquid environment by water vapour entrapped in a denatured protein layer to exceed the threshold temperature of 225 degrees C for tissue penetration. When axial force increased from 20 to 80 g at 10 W continuous exposure, the velocity of tissue penetration increased in the range from 1 to 4 mm/s. Tissue penetration by modified fiber tips is attributed to both remodeling and vaporization of tissue. With transparent contact probes, tissue is heated partly by direct light absorption and partly by a hot probe surface. Axially directed force is necessary to displace lateral non-ablated tissue and to overcome mechanical resistance. We conclude that mechanical dilation due to axial catherization force (Dotter effect) contributes substantially to tissue penetration by transparent contact probes.\r"

We examined the absorption, temperature increase, and probe degradation of transparent contact probes (hemispherical contact probe and ball-shaped fibers) and metal laser probes coupled to a continuous-wave Nd-YAG laser. Temperature was recorded by means of thermocouples and the measurements were corrected for direct light absorption by the thermocouple. During 15 W, 1 s exposure, the peak temperature rise of the hemispherical contact probe in contact with tissue dropped from approximately 1,000 degrees C at the front end to below 45 degrees C (95% drop) at the lateral side. In contrast, during continuous exposure the peak temperature rise of metal laser probes in contact with tissue dropped from 560 degrees C at the front end to near 400 degrees C (30% drop) at the 5.5 mm proximal rear end. During exposure in blood or tissue, the transparent contact probes became contaminated. Their absorption increased from 5 to 33% and the probe deteriorated. Repeated use of metal laser probes in blood resulted in a higher temperature at the rear than at the front end due to backburing of the fiber. Owing to the large temperature drop along the surface of transparent contact probes, the area of thermal destruction is limited to the tissue in front of the probe, whereas along the entire surface of metal laser probes the tissue will be affected. The large difference between these temperature distributions should be respected during clinical application of the transparent contact probe and the metal laser probe.\r"

An argon laser was used to make bilateral femoral arteriovenous anastomoses in 12 dogs compared to conventional suture method in another 8 dogs. These anastomoses were evaluated for patency and aneurysm formation at 1 hour; 1, 2, 4, and 8 weeks; and 12 months after surgery. All anastomotic sites were patent and without aneurysmal change or luminal narrowing at all harvesting intervals. Histologic examination revealed that within 1 month laser anastomotic sites were almost completely healed and without intimal hyperplasia. In suture anastomoses, foreign-body reaction remained evident up to 1 year. Use of the argon laser for medium size vessel anastomoses resulted in excellent patency without aneurysm formation or intimal hyperplasia even in the long term. These data suggest promising clinical applications.\r"

  ".W": "Tissue effects of the mid-IR Holmium laser (emitting at a wave-length of 2130 nm) were evaluated. This wavelength is attractive because it combines high water absorption and easy transmission through standard optical fibres. The laser was pulsed with pulse durations in the range of 100 microseconds and repetition rates between 2 and 6 Hertz. For all experiments a repetition rate of 2 Hertz was used. The laser beam was coupled into waterfree quartz fibers with core diameters of 200 and 800 microns with an efficiency of 70 and 80%, respectively. Ablation of atherosclerotic plaque has been performed at an ablation threshold of 10J/cm2 for the 800 microns and 40J/cm2 for the 200 microns fibre. Removal of calcified plaque was possible. Ablation efficiency increased in a non-linear fashion with increasing pulse energies. The ablation rate per pulse was approximately 2 mm at energy fluences of 1000J/cm2 for the 200 microns fibre and 1.25 mm at energy fluences of 70J/cm2 for the 800 microns fibre; a further increase in energy densities did not result in higher ablation rates. On macroscopic examination only very limited thermal injury was found in crater adjacent tissue structures. Crater edges were even and did not reveal signs of crater charring or debris in the crater lumen. However, the histologic specimens revealed zones of thermal damage extending 100 up to 1000 microns lateral into adjacent tissue. Thermal damage increased with increasing radiant exposures and depended on the medium used.\r"

The primary tissue model was bovine shank bone, while human arterial calcified plaque and normal human artery wall were also studied at selected wavelengths for comparison. Laser irradiances were on the order of MW/mm2, fluences ranged up to 1000 mJ/mm2, and repetition rates varied between 0.3-10 Hz. Spot sizes on the tissue surface ranged from 150 to 850 microns. Laser craters made with wavelengths between lambda = 295 nm and lambda = 375 nm and in the lambda = 3 microns region exhibited the highest quality ablation with clean, sharp cuts following closely the spatial contour of the incident beam. Craters drilled with visible wavelengths between lambda = 450 nm and lambda = 590 nm were generally larger than the incident laser beam spot, irregular in shape and often surrounded by large flakes of tissue debris. Ablation fluence thresholds increased with wavelength through the visible wavelengths and into the mid-infrared, but dropped to their lowest values near lambda = 3 microns. Fluence thresholds obtained with the tissue under a 1 mm depth of saline were approximately twice air thresholds. Ablation yields also varied with wavelength, probably due to increased scattering in the visible region, and were the same under saline as in air.\r"

  ".W": "Laser recanalization of totally occluded swine iliac arteries was performed to assess the safety and efficacy of a lensed fiber laser angioplasty system with a holmium:YAG (2.1 microns) laser. Silica lenses of 1.0 mm, 1.3 mm, and 1.5 mm in diameter attached to the distal end of a 300-microns diameter silica fiber delivered fluences of 79.5 J/cm2, 31.4 J/cm2, and 25.5 J/cm2, respectively. The pulse duration of the laser was 250 microseconds and the repetition rate was 4 Hz. The mean length of the total occlusions was 5.3 +/- 2.0 cm (range 0.5 cm to 8.0 cm). Successful recanalization was obtained in 16/16 lesions without angiographic vessel perforation. Angiographically significant residual stenoses (greater than 50%) remained in every case following successful laser recanalization. Histologically there was minimal evidence of thermal or acoustic tissue injury; however, in 4 of 16 arteries there was evidence of deep arterial dissection following laser recanalization. We conclude that this lensed fiber coupled with a holmium:YAG laser is a safe and effective method for crossing total occlusions in the relatively straight iliac arteries of this animal model.\r"

The spread of polymerization in a camphorquinone activated resin due to 488 nm light emanating from an opaque plastic canal was compared with light emanating from a canal of the same diameter in tooth dentin. Results indicated that irradiation of a resin-filled chamber via an opaque canal generated a series of ellipsoidal forms, while irradiation via a root canal generated bullet-shaped forms of much larger volume and weight. The base of these bullet-shaped forms was flat against the dentin-resin interface and surrounded the canal. These results indicated that 488 nm argon laser light was transmitted through dentin and could act to polymerize resin at a distance of several millimeters from the canal. Further experiments verified that resin in lateral canals of tooth roots was readily polymerized by 488 nm light applied at low power levels (50 mW). These experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the argon laser in polymerizing light activated dental resins located within or adjacent to tooth dentin at distances up to several milimeters from the fiberoptic terminus. The flexibility and control that these procedures make possible in the obturation of root canals may lead to substantial improvements in endodontic therapy.\r"

A comparable utility for HPD in the endoscopic localization of colonic tumors may be possible. In this study the ability of HPD to identify 1,2 dimethylhydrazine (DMH) induced colon cancer in rats is evaluated. A total of 111 rats were studied with HPD. Sixty-nine rats received weekly injections of DMH (20 mg/kg) and 42 received injections of the vehicle alone. Twenty-four hours after the intravenous injection of 5 mg/kg of HPD, 18 DMH-induced tumors were identified by visual fluorescence using excitation by either a blue light (390-436 nm) or an argon laser (488 and 514 nm). This represented 100% of the visually or microscopically detected tumors. Seventy-five fluorescent areas were noted that did not contain evidence of cancer. The majority (63) of false positive areas contained lymphoid follicles. All but 2 false positive areas (73/75, 97%, p less than .001) were seen in DMH-treated animals, suggesting that they were an artifact of DMH treatment. HPD fluorescence did not identify microscopic dysplasia. We conclude that HPD fluorescence is an effective method of identifying early colonic cancer and may have a potential clinical role in patients at high risk for colorectal cancer.\r"

  ".W": "To date, lasers have found only limited applications in orthopedics. We employed a 308 nm XeCl excimer laser for ablation of fibrocartilage, in order to investigate the feasibility of excimer laser assisted meniscectomy. Experiments were conducted both in vitro and in vivo. For the in vitro study, human menisci, obtained during surgery and autopsy, were irradiated via a 600 microns core fiber at radiant exposures ranging between 20 mj/mm2 and 80 mj/mm2, at 20 Hz. Ablation rate measurements and histological analysis of the samples were performed. The ablation rates were found to range from 3 microns/pulse to 100 microns/pulse depending on the radiant exposure and/or the applied pressure on the fiber delivery system. Thermographic analysis was also performed during pulsed excimer as well as CW Nd:Yag and CW CO2 laser irradiation. Temperatures were lower for excimer laser (Tmax less than 65 degrees) than CW ND: Yag (Tmax less than 210 degrees) or CW CO2 (Tmax less than 202 degrees) laser. For the in vitro study, medial meniscectomy was performed in 15 rabbits with the excimer laser and a CW Nd:Yag laser in the right and left knee respectively. Excimer laser irradiation was performed at 70 mj/mm2. Nd:Yag irradiation was performed via a 600 microns core fiber at power outputs between 20 to 40 W for 10 and 20 seconds duration. The healing response to injury was investigated by histological analysis of the menisci after 1 day, 1, 2, 4, and 8 weeks following the laser procedure. Excimer laser treated menisci showed less inflammatory reaction and noticeable repair with minimal inflammatory response.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Laser induced fluorescence of intervertebral discs was investigated in this study for the first time in order to develop a fluorescence guided percutaneous excimer laser discectomy. For this purpose 35 human cadaveric intervetebral discs from level L1 to L5 were irradiated with a 308 nm XeCl excimer laser with a 60 nsec pulse width at 10, 20 and 30 mj/mm2. Laser light was transmitted over a 1000 microns core optical fiber. Fluorescence emitted from the irradiated tissue was transmitted back over the same fiber over a semireflective mirror to another optical fiber, coupled into a spectrograph and O-SMA optical simultaneous multichannel spectral analyzer system. The spectral lineshape of both the annulus fibrosus and the nucleus pulposus was characterized by a broadband emission between 320 nm and 616 nm with 3 peak emissions at 358, 423 and 457 nm. Relative intensities were calculated by forming two ratios of the peak intensities of the three peaks (R1 = I 423/I 358; R2 = I 423/I 457). Statistical analysis of both ratios revealed a highly significant discrimination between annulus fibrosus and nucleus pulposus (P less than 0.001). Under penetrating conditions multiple recorded spectra showed the spectral profile of subsequently ablated nucleus and annulus. The results of this study demonstrate that discrimination between annulus fibrosus and nucleus pulposus by excimer laser-induced fluorescence is feasible under laboratory conditions. Fluorescence spectroscopy could possibly be developed into a valuable guiding system for percutaneous laser discectomy.\r"

  ".W": "One-dimensional continuous-wave laser tissue ablation models predict that the steady-state ablation velocity is independent of the optical absorption of the tissue and proportional to laser power density. This theoretical result was tested in an experimental model that approximates the one-dimensional situation. The model consists of 3 to 4 mm-diameter polyacrylamide rods irradiated at one end with an argon laser beam with uniform power density. It was found that ablation velocity is indeed independent of the light absorption coefficient in the material and proportional to the incident power density. Analysis of the relation between the experimental velocities and the power density showed that approximately 40% of the incident laser light is reflected or attenuated in the escaping vapors. Furthermore, compared to the actual absorbed laser power, heat loss caused by thermal radiation and convection from the side surface of the rod is considerable during ablation, especially at lower power densities. This heat loss is not present in a true one-dimensional geometry and creates therefore a marked difference between the rod and one-dimensional geometry. Computations show that in the pre-ablation stage the heat losses from the rod can be neglected, compared to the absorbed energy. In this case the rod is a very good approximation of the true one-dimensional situation.\r"

In over 90% of adhesions and 96% of endometriotic implants the Nd:YAG laser could be delivered to the site and be used to restore normal anatomy. The exception was deep bowel involvement with endometriosis, which was not treated. The majority of women had marked reduction or resolution of their symptoms for up to 12 months postoperatively. We conclude that the use of the Nd:YAG laser is an appropriate method to laparoscopically treat pelvic pain resulting from endometriosis or pelvic adhesions.\r"

Although methods exist that permit laser surgery without an ET, this is frequently not feasible. The current investigation was undertaken to evaluate the efficacy of a double-cuffed stainless steel ET, first in the laboratory and subsequently in a clinical setting. Bench testing was performed using CO2 (both standard and milliwatt) and KTP/532 lasers. Only the distal polyvinyl chloride cuffed end of the tube was potentially ignitable, however, the appropriate use of saline to fill the cuffs allowed only for cuff perforation without ignition. Canine testing was performed in 10 animals: 4 dogs were intubated from 3 to 4.5 hours with the laser resistant stainless steel endotracheal tube (LRSS-ET) (Laser-Flex Tracheal Tube; Mallinckrodt Anesthesia Products, St. Louis, MO) and 2 with an aluminum tape wrapped red rubber ET. Visual and histological examination were performed in both groups at 3 and 7 days. Four dogs underwent CO2 laser laryngeal surgery with visual and histological examination performed at 7 days postoperatively. No untoward effects could be demonstrated due to the LRSS-ET. A clinical study was then performed in 24 patients who underwent laser surgery of the upper aerodigestive tract with either a CO2 or KTP/532 laser. In all cases ventilation was adequate, the shaft of the LRSS-ET proved impervious to the laser, and the distal end of the tube protected the tracheobronchial tree safely.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Although transmission of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) from mother to infant has been well documented during pregnancy and delivery, little is known about the possible transmission of HIV-1 during the postnatal period. METHODS. We conducted a prospective cohort study in Kigali, Rwanda, of 212 mother-infant pairs who were seronegative for HIV-1 at delivery. All the infants were breast-fed. The subjects were followed at three-month intervals, with Western blot assays for antibodies to HIV-1 and testing of mononuclear cells by a double polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using three sets of primers. To evaluate potential risk factors, each mother who seroconverted was matched with three seronegative control women. RESULTS. After a mean follow-up of 16.6 months, 16 of the 212 mothers became seropositive for HIV-1. Of their 16 infants, 9 became seropositive. One infant was excluded from the analysis because of a positive test by PCR on the blood sample obtained at birth. Postnatal seroconversion to HIV-1 occurred in four of the five infants born to the mothers who seroconverted during the first 3 months post partum, and in four infants of the 10 mothers who seroconverted between month 4 and month 21. In all cases, the infant seroconverted during the same three-month period as the mother. The main risk factor for maternal seroconversion was being single. CONCLUSIONS. HIV-1 infection can be transmitted from mothers to infants during the postnatal period. Colostrum and breast milk may be efficient routes for the transmission of HIV-1 from recently infected mothers to their infants.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND AND METHODS. Thyroid disease, especially hypothyroidism, is common in patients with Hodgkin's disease who have been treated with irradiation. We reviewed the records of 1787 patients (740 women and 1047 men) with Hodgkin's disease who were treated with radiation therapy alone (810 patients), radiation and chemotherapy (920 patients), or chemotherapy alone (57 patients) at Stanford University between 1961 and 1989. Among these patients, 1533 were alive at the last follow-up, and 254 had died of causes other than Hodgkin's disease. (Four other patients were excluded from the analysis because they had undergone thyroidectomy before treatment for Hodgkin's disease. The thyroid was irradiated in 1677 patients. Follow-up averaged 9.9 years. RESULTS. A total of 573 patients had clinical or biochemical evidence of thyroid disease. Among the 1677 patients whose thyroid was irradiated, the actuarial risk of thyroid disease 20 years after treatment was 52 percent, and it was 67 percent at 26 years. Hypothyroidism was found in 513 patients. A total of 486 patients received thyroxine therapy for elevated serum thyrotropin concentrations and either low free thyroxine (208 patients) or normal free thyroxine values (278 patients); 27 had transient elevations of the serum thyrotropin level that were not treated. Graves' hyperthyroidism developed in 30 patients (2 of whom had not undergone thyroid irradiation), and ophthalmopathy developed in 17 of these patients. Ophthalmopathy developed in four other patients with Graves' disease during a period of hypothyroidism (n = 3) or euthyroidism (n = 1). The risk of Graves' disease was 7.2 to 20.4 times that for normal subjects. Silent thyroiditis with thyrotoxicosis developed in six patients. Forty-four patients were found to have single or multiple thyroid nodules, 26 of whom underwent thyroidectomy. Six of the 44 had papillary or follicular cancers. Among the patients who did not undergo operation, 12 had small functioning nodules, 4 had cysts, and 2 had multinodular goiters. The actuarial risk of thyroid cancer was 1.7 percent. The risk of thyroid cancer was 15.6 times the expected risk. CONCLUSIONS. High risks of thyroid disease persist more than 25 years after patients have received radiation therapy for Hodgkin's disease, reinforcing the need for continued clinical and biochemical evaluation. Prolonged follow-up confirms an elevated risk of thyroid cancer and Graves' disease as well as hypothyroidism in these patients.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. It is not known whether psychological stress suppresses host resistance to infection. To investigate this issue, we prospectively studied the relation between psychological stress and the frequency of documented clinical colds among subjects intentionally exposed to respiratory viruses. METHODS. After completing questionnaires assessing degrees of psychological stress, 394 healthy subjects were given nasal drops containing one of five respiratory viruses (rhinovirus type 2, 9, or 14, respiratory syncytial virus, or coronavirus type 229E), and an additional 26 were given saline nasal drops. The subjects were then quarantined and monitored for the development of evidence of infection and symptoms. Clinical colds were defined as clinical symptoms in the presence of an infection verified by the isolation of virus or by an increase in the virus-specific antibody titer. RESULTS. The rates of both respiratory infection (P less than 0.005) and clinical colds (P less than 0.02) increased in a dose-response manner with increases in the degree of psychological stress. Infection rates ranged from approximately 74 percent to approximately 90 percent, according to levels of psychological stress, and the incidence of clinical colds ranged from approximately 27 percent to 47 percent. These effects were not altered when we controlled for age, sex, education, allergic status, weight, the season, the number of subjects housed together, the infectious status of subjects sharing the same housing, and virus-specific antibody status at base line (before challenge). Moreover, the associations observed were similar for all five challenge viruses. Several potential stress-illness mediators, including smoking, alcohol consumption, exercise, diet, quality of sleep, white-cell counts, and total immunoglobulin levels, did not explain the association between stress and illness. Similarly, controls for personality variables (self-esteem, personal control, and introversion-extraversion) failed to alter our findings. CONCLUSIONS. Psychological stress was associated in a dose-response manner with an increased risk of acute infectious respiratory illness, and this risk was attributable to increased rates of infection rather than to an increased frequency of symptoms after infection.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. We earlier reported that patients with recurrent respiratory papillomatosis responded to six months of treatment with lymphoblastoid interferon alfa-n1. Because another study of patients treated for one year with leukocyte interferon alfa-n3 found that the growth rate of papillomas was slowed in the first six months but returned to base line during months 7 through 12 despite persistent interferon treatment, we now report the long-term results in our original study patients who were followed for a median of four years after the original one-year crossover study. METHODS. After the patients in our study had completed the first study year, their physicians could continue or recommence treatment with lymphoblastoid interferon alfa-n1 in a dose of either 2 MU per square meter of body-surface area per day or 4 MU per square meter every other day. The extent of disease was measured by endoscopy when clinically indicated. RESULTS. Data on late-follow-up were obtained for 60 of the 66 patients. There were 22 complete remissions and 25 partial remissions; 13 patients had no response. The median duration of the complete remissions was 550 days, and 15 patients continued to be in complete remission. The median duration of partial remissions was 400 days and seven patients were still in partial remission. Thirteen of 28 patients responded to a second course of interferon after an interruption in treatment of at least one month. The rate of response in the 11 of 53 patients who had neutralizing antibody to interferon was the same as in the patients without the antibody. CONCLUSIONS. Patients with severe recurrent respiratory papillomatosis may have a sustained or repeated response to treatment with lymphoblastoid interferon alfa-n1. We recommend that patients with recurrent respiratory papillomatosis who require surgery every two to three months be given a six-month trial of interferon alfa-n1.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Although enhanced efferent cardiac sympathetic nervous activity has been proposed as an important factor in the genesis of ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death, direct clinical evidence has been lacking. METHODS. We measured the rates of total and cardiac norepinephrine spillover into the plasma, which reflect respectively overall and cardiac sympathetic nervous activity, in 12 patients who had recovered from a spontaneous, sustained episode of ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation outside the hospital 4 to 48 days earlier. The results were compared with those from three age-matched reference groups without a history of ventricular arrhythmias: 12 patients with coronary artery disease, 6 patients with chest pain but normal coronary arteries, and 12 healthy, normal subjects. RESULTS. The patients who had had ventricular arrhythmias had reduced left ventricular ejection fractions, as compared with the patients with coronary artery disease or chest pain (mean [+/- SE], 46 +/- 3 percent vs. 58 +/- 4 percent and 69 +/- 5 percent, respectively; P less than 0.003). The rates of total norepinephrine spillover into the plasma were similar in the three reference groups, but 80 percent higher in the patients with ventricular arrhythmias (P less than 0.005). The rate of cardiac norepinephrine spillover was 450 percent higher in these patients (176 +/- 39 pmol per minute, as compared with 32 +/- 8 pmol per minute in the normal subjects; P less than 0.001), a disproportionate increase relative to the increase in total spillover, which indicated selective activation of the cardiac sympathetic outflow. This increase in cardiac norepinephrine spillover was probably caused by a reduction in left ventricular function. CONCLUSIONS. These results suggest that in some patients major ventricular arrhythmias are associated with and perhaps caused by sustained and selective cardiac sympathetic activation. We speculate that depressed ventricular function was present before the ventricular arrhythmia occurred, and that this resulted in reflex cardiac sympathetic activation, which in turn contributed to the genesis of the arrhythmia.\r"

Our studies of engrailed regulation suggest that fate determination is an elaborate, multistep process. At the time in embryogenesis when the engrailed-dependent cell fate is probably determined, four modes of control act in an overlapping progression to govern engrailed expression. After activation by pair-rule genes, both an extracellular signal, wingless, and autoregulation are required for engrailed expression. Autoregulation graduates to wingless independence, but is transient, and is superseded by an engrailed-independent mode of maintenance.\r"

Trace amounts of DNA can be recovered even from 5,500-year-old bones and multicopy human mitochondrial DNA sequences can frequently be amplified from such DNA using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). But given the sensitivity of PCR, it is very difficult to exclude contaminating material. We now report the successful identification of the 8-year-old skeletal remains of a murder victim, by comparative typing of nuclear microsatellite markers in the remains and in the presumptive parents of the victim. This analysis establishes the authenticity of the bone DNA and the feasibility of bone DNA typing in forensic investigations.\r"

  ".U": "91319208\r", 
  ".W": "Many genes that control pattern formation in insects contain a conserved homeobox region which encodes a domain involved in DNA binding. One approach to understanding pattern formation in vertebrates is to examine the role of homeobox-containing genes in the developing limb. Two such genes, Hox-7.1 and Hox-8.1, are expressed in distal mesoderm, but not in the proximal core, of mouse forelimb (refs 3, 4, and D.R.D., manuscript in preparation). The proximodistal cartilage pattern in the chick wing is progressively determined in the distal mesoderm, which is maintained as a 'progress zone' by the overlying apical ectodermal ridge. Indeed, proximal cells are reprogrammed to form distal structures when placed in the progress zone and we therefore expect that genes involved in controlling limb pattern should be activated in such grafts. We tested this requirement for Hox-7.1 and Hox-8.1 in mouse limb mesoderm placed in chick wing buds. Our results reported here indicate that both genes are rapidly activated by a signal from the apical ectoderm. These properties, taken with the DNA-binding properties of the homeodomain, strongly suggest that Hox-7.1 and Hox-8.1 have fundamental roles in limb-pattern formation.\r"

  ".U": "91319209\r", 
  ".W": "Trophic control over the expression and membrane distribution of voltage-dependent ion channels is one of the principal organizing events underlying the maturation of excitable cells. The myelin sheath is a major structural determinant of regional ion channel topography in central axons, but the exact molecular signals that mediate local interactions between the oligodendrocyte and axolemma are not known. We have found that large caliber fibre pathways in the brain of the mutant mouse shiverer (shi, gene on chromosome 18), whose developmental fate of myelination is averted by deletion of five exons in the myelin basic protein gene, have a striking excess of sodium channels. As cytoplasmic membranes of shiverer oligodendroglia still adhere to axons, the evidence indicates that myelin basic protein or a myelin basic protein-dependent glial transmembrane signal associated with compact myelin formation, rather than a simple glial-axon contact inhibition or an intrinsic genetic program of neuronal differentiation, could be critical in downregulating sodium channel density in axons. Here we use the shiverer mutant to show that mature central nervous system projection neurons with large caliber unmyelinated fibres sustain functional excitability by increasing sodium channel density. This axon plasticity, triggered by the absence of a single glial protein, contributes to the unexpectedly mild degree of neurological impairment in the mutant brain without myelin, and may be a potentially inducible mechanism determining the recovery of function from dysmyelinating disease.\r"

  ".W": "Infection of macaques with simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) and human immunodeficiency virus type 2 (HIV-2) are useful models for studies of immunotherapy and vaccination against HIV as well as for testing of antiviral drugs. Vaccine research showing protective immunity in immunized monkeys has indicated that it will be possible to develop a vaccine for prevention of human HIV infection, although many hurdles remain. The design of an HIV vaccine would be helped if the basis of the protective immunity could be elucidated. Passive immune prophylaxis offers a means to determine the relative role of antibodies in protection against infection. We have studied whether a transfer of antibodies can prevent HIV-2 and SIVsm (SIV of sooty mangabey origin) infection in cynomolgus monkeys. Sera with high antibody titres were collected, heat-treated and injected into naive animals 6 h before challenge with 10-100 monkey-infectious doses of live homologous virus. All control animals treated with normal monkey serum (n = 6) or no serum (n = 39) became infected by the challenge virus, whereas five out of seven animals pretreated with antibody-containing serum at a dose of 9 ml kg-1 resisted infection. Thus passively transferred antibodies can protect against a low-dose lentivirus challenge in a nonhuman primate.\r"

In this study we used adhesive ligands and blocking antibodies to identify stromal cell-derived extracellular matrix proteins involved in promoting attachment of murine haematopoietic stem cells. Here we report that day-12 colony-forming-unit spleen (CFU-S12)5 cells and reconstituting haematopoietic stem cells attach to the C-terminal, heparin-binding fragment of fibronectin by recognizing the CS-1 peptide of the alternatively spliced non-type III connecting segment (IIICS) of human plasma fibronectin. Furthermore, CFU-S12 stem cells express the alpha 4 subunit of the VLA-4 integrin receptor, which is known to be a receptor for the CS-1 sequence, and monoclonal antibodies against the integrin alpha 4 subunit of VLA-4 block adhesion of CFU-S12 stem cells to plates coated with the C-terminal fibronectin fragment. Finally, polyclonal antibodies against the integrin beta 1 subunit of VLA-4 inhibit the formation of CFU-S12-derived spleen colonies and medullary haematopoiesis in vivo following intravenous infusion of antibody-treated bone marrow cells.\r"

Cell lines synthesizing both chains but expressing low levels of MHC class I molecules on their surface as a result of a failure in assembly and transport have been identified. We now report that although the apparent steady-state distribution in these cells of class I molecules is in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), the molecules in fact are recycled between the ER and Golgi, rather than retained in the ER. This explains the failure of class I molecules to negotiate the secretory pathway. Class I molecules do not seem to be modified by Golgi enzymes, suggesting that the proteins do not reach the Golgi apparatus during recycling. But morphological and subcellular fractionation evidence indicates that they pass through the cis Golgi or a Golgi-associated organelle, which we postulate to be the recycling organelle. This compartment, which we call the 'cis-Golgi network', would thereby be a sorting organelle that selects proteins for return to the ER.\r"

The ability to view nanometre-sized particles with the light microscope suggested a method of monitoring transcription by individual RNA polymerase molecules. We describe here the behaviour of 40-nm-diameter particles of colloidal gold attached to the ends of DNA molecules being transcribed by RNA polymerase immobilized on a glass surface. The tethered gold particles are released from the surface at times after addition of nucleoside triphosphates that are consistent with the kinetics of transcription by RNA polymerase in solution. Analysis of the brownian motion of the gold particles enabled us to measure the movement along the template DNA of individual polymerase molecules.\r"

X-ray diffraction studies have provided extensive structural information for many proteins, challenging theorists to develop reliable techniques able to use such knowledge as a base for prediction of mutants' characteristics. Here we report theoretical calculation of stabilization energies for 78 triple-site sequence variants of lambda repressor characterized experimentally by Lim and Sauer. The calculated energies correlate with the mutants' measured activities; active and inactive mutations are discriminated with 92% reliability. They correlate even more directly with the mutants' thermostabilities, correctly identifying two of the mutants to be more stable than the wild type.\r"

The folding of helical oligopeptides can be modelled by two parameters: sigma which reflects helix initiation and s which reflects propagation of a pre-existing helix and measures helical bias. Scheraga has reported s values for oligopeptides of about 1.1, implying a weak helical bias for amino-acid residues. By contrast, certain helical peptides studied by Baldwin seem to require much larger s values for alanine. Resolution of this inconsistency requires experiments that disentangle the ease of propagation from that of initiation. In this study varying lengths of polyalanine are linked to a 'template' that initiates helical structure and permits study solely of propagation. We report here that the s value for alanine in water is close to 1, supporting the earlier results of Scheraga but not the more recent results of Baldwin.\r"

  ".W": "Although amitriptyline relieves pain in many patients with painful diabetic neuropathy, side effects often preclude effective treatment. Desipramine has the least anticholinergic and sedative effects of the first generation tricyclic antidepressants. We compared a 6 week course of desipramine (mean dose, 201 mg/day) to active placebo in 20 patients with painful diabetic neuropathy in a double-blind crossover trial. Pain relief with desipramine was statistically significant in weeks 5 and 6. Eleven patients reported at least moderate relief with desipramine, compared to 2 with placebo. Pain relief tended to be greater in depressed patients, but relief was also observed in patients who did not show an antidepressant effect. We conclude that desipramine relieves pain in many patients with painful diabetic neuropathy, offering an alternative for patients unable to tolerate amitriptyline. Blockade of norepinephrine reuptake, an action shared by desipramine, amitriptyline, and other antidepressants proven effective in neuropathic pain, may mediate this analgesic effect.\r"

Blood and CSF samples were assayed for morphine and hydromorphone concentration to determine blood and CSF pharmacokinetic profiles. A maximum blood morphine concentration of 60 +/- 25 ng/ml (mean +/- S.D.) was obtained at 11 +/- 6 min (mean +/- S.D.). The blood hydromorphone peak of 14 +/- 13 ng/ml (mean +/- S.D.) occurred 8 +/- 6 min (mean +/- S.D.).

None of these measurements showed any significant post-experimental changes. Contrary to common clinical belief, these results suggest that in healthy male subjects, significant jaw pain and tenderness following repeated sustained isometric protrusion efforts are difficult to induce.\r"

Back pain subjects were measured during both low pain and high pain states. Results revealed a non-significant trend for all subjects, regardless of diagnosis, to have higher paraspinal muscle tension levels on the second (or high pain) assessment. A significant diagnosis by position interaction was observed which was similar to the interaction in our previous study which employed only a single measurement session. Analysis of simple main effects revealed this to be due to control subjects during the standing position having lower EMG levels than the back pain groups, and intervertebral disk disorder subjects having higher EMG levels than the other groups during the supported sitting position. As in our previous study, diagnosis was found to be a clinically significant factor, in that controls had much fewer clinically abnormal readings than back pain patients. The lack of a significant effect for pain state is congruent with findings in the headache literature. The importance of clearly defined diagnostic categories in low back pain research and the utility of measuring subjects in various positions is discussed, as are possible explanations for lack of significant pain state findings.\r"

A baseline period of 10 weeks was followed by 10 weekly therapy sessions. At posttreatment, improvement in measurements of reported pain intensity and behavioral and emotional adjustment to pain correlated significantly with (changes in) coping strategy use. However, at the 6-month follow-up, only pain reduction appeared to be significantly related to pretreatment-follow-up changes on CSQ scores for Perceived Control. It is concluded that a judgment about one's capability to control pain may be as important as the specific pain coping strategies used.\r"

Comparisons were made at evaluation and at a follow-up period averaging 11 months later. From evaluation to discharge, the treated group showed significant increases in physical functioning. From evaluation to long-term follow-up, both the treated and non-treated groups showed significant decreases in self-report pain ratings and interference with activities ratings.

The return-to-work rate for the treated group was 48% with an additional 28% of the patients being returned to vocational rehabilitation. None of the non-treated group returned to work or vocational rehabilitation.

This review gives an historical overview of the relevant basic and clinical literature and provides a critical examination of the clinical efficacy, choice of stimulation sites, parameters of stimulation, and effects on experimental pain. Finally, we give suggestions for future research that could more definitively determine the usefulness of deep brain stimulation for pain control.\r"

Thermograms confirmed that the experimental neuropathy produces signs resembling those of patients with neuropathic pain. The hind paws on the nerve-damaged side were abnormally hot, abnormally cold, or apparently normal 8-16 days post injury, a variability that is seen clinically in neuropathic pain patients. Abnormally cold hind paws became warm as soon as the injured sciatic nerve was transected, indicating that the underlying vasoconstriction was mediated by neural impulse activity. Xylazine (Rompun), a sympatho-inhibitory alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist that normally increases cutaneous temperature, caused the hind paw on the control side to warm, as anticipated, while causing paradoxical cooling of abnormally hot hind paws, and even of 'normal temperature' paws on the nerve-injured side. These findings shed light on possible mechanisms underlying abnormal deviations of skin temperature as a symptom of nerve injury. The findings also attest to the usefulness of the experimental animal model of neuropathic pain and of the thermographic method.\r"

  ".W": "When a peripheral nerve is severed, damaged sensory fibers emit a barrage of impulses that lasts for many seconds, or even several minutes ('injury discharge'). We have shown in rats that local anesthetic blockade of this discharge suppresses autotomy (a behavioral model of neuropathic pain). Correspondingly, mimicking prolonged injury discharge with electrical stimulation, especially of C-fibers, increased autotomy. These data support the hypothesis that injury discharge plays a role in the triggering of neuropathic pain. The mechanism of triggering autotomy was investigated using intrathecal injection of agents affecting glutamatergic transmission. A single intrathecal injection at the lumbar enlargement of the NMDA receptor blockers MK-801 and 5-APV, just prior to neurectomy, significantly suppressed autotomy. Blocking glycinergic inhibition just prior to neurectomy with a single strychnine injection strikingly enhanced autotomy. Strychnine enhancement of autotomy was prevented by prior injection of MK-801 or 5-APV. These results suggest that the expression of autotomy in rats, and by inference neuropathic pain in humans, is affected by injury discharge, possibly mediated by long-lasting, NMDA receptor-related, spinal disinhibition.\r"

Here, we have electrophysiologically characterized the functional properties of a subpopulation of these afferent fibres that supply the ventral roots of the cat sacral spinal cord. We have taken advantage of the unique anatomical arrangement of these primary afferent neurones which have their central axon in the dorsal root and project with their peripheral process into the segmental ventral root. In 10 experiments, 14 units were recorded in the dorsal root S2 which responded to electrical stimulation of the segmental ventral root. As judged by their conduction velocity ranging from 0.1 to 2.3 m/sec, all fibres were unmyelinated. In 4 cases a spot-like receptive field was located on the root where the units were reproducibly activated by mechanical stimuli, the most effective being a slight stretch. In two units tested, topical application of hypertonic saline onto the receptive field, but not at other portions of the axon elicited a long-lasting vigorous discharge with intermittent bursts. There was no obvious association of the receptive field with small blood vessels. In 5 of the 14 units including 2 with a mechanosensitive receptive field we observed latency jumps of the action potential with electrical stimulation of the ventral root close to the dorsal root ganglion. In some of these units latency jumps were also observed at other positions when the stimulation electrodes were moved centrally towards the spinal cord. We conclude that a subpopulation of unmyelinated fibres in the spinal ventral root are primary afferents innervating the root proper or its sheath.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

When administered (i.v.) before the inflammatory agent, carrageenan (CAR), CMI (0.125, 0.25 and 0.5 mg/kg) completely prevented the development of the hyperalgesia for 70-120 min according to the doses. This antinociceptive effect was suppressed by naloxone (100 micrograms/kg i.v.) for 65 min. Neither higher doses (1, 2 and 20 mg/kg, i.v.) nor CMI injected into the inflamed paw (15 min before CAR) modified pain thresholds. Moreover, CMI (0.5 and 2 mg/kg, i.v.) administered 15 min before CAR markedly increased the volume of the CAR-induced oedema. These results (1) demonstrate an opioid-dependent antinociceptive effect of CMI on this model, the doses used being lower than those active in thermal or electrical tests, and (2) tend to exclude a peripheral mechanism and an NSAID-like anti-inflammatory activity suggested by previous in vitro studies.\r"

Eleven subjects experienced the onset of symptoms with an acute illness (seven Monospot-positive). Medical history, physical examination, and laboratory testing yielded little helpful information. Serologic testing for Coxsackie B viruses 1 through 6, cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, human herpesvirus 6, and Toxoplasma gondii in subjects and healthy controls provided little evidence for an infectious cause of persistent fatigue. Children's Depression Inventory scores and psychiatric interviews with the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia-Children's Version (K-SADS) identified five subjects with major depression. On the K-SADS, the 10 fatigued subjects without major depression endorsed many secondary symptoms of depression but were less likely than depressed psychiatric clinic patients to endorse primary symptoms such as depressed mood, guilt, and suicidality. At telephone follow-up 13 to 32 months after intake, 4 subjects were completely well, 4 markedly improved, and 7 unimproved or worse. Further research is necessary to determine whether chronic fatigue in adolescents is prodromal depression, a discrete psychosomatic condition, or an infectious or immunologic disorder that mimics depression.\r"

Indications for transplantation were idiopathic cardiomyopathy (68%), congenital heart disease (21%), endocardial fibroelastosis (8%), and doxorubicin cardiomyopathy (3%). Immunosuppression was achieved with combinations of cyclosporine, prednisone, and azathioprine. Thirty-seven of 42 recipients leaving the hospital after transplantation were alive and in New York Heart Association class I at study's end. Cumulative survival was 79% at 1 year, 76% at 3 years, and 69% at 5 years. Fourteen recipients have survived more than 5 years (5.1 to 12.4 years). Hospital readmission for illness has been infrequent, decreasing from 6.8 days to 0.9 days per year over 5 years. Eleven patients have required no rehospitalization. Posttransplant deaths were due to infection (19%), rejection (4%), pulmonary hypertension (4%), coronary artery disease (2%), and lymphoproliferative disease (2%). Retransplantation was required for intractable rejection in 4 patients and advanced coronary artery disease in 2. Hypertension and elevated blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels were common in individuals receiving cyclosporine. Growth was often impaired in prepubertal children receiving daily prednisone. Based on this 15-year experience, it is concluded that heart transplantation represents a reasonable alternative for selected young patients with end-stage cardiac disease.\r"

This controlled trial is the first to compare directly the effectiveness of these two treatments for long-standing OME. Outcome variables are treatment success rates, hearing thresholds, recurrent acute otitis media episodes, and side effects of medication or complications of VT placement. One hundred twenty-five children (aged 2.5 to 7 years) who met the usual indications for surgery (long-standing [greater than 3 months] OME and conductive hearing loss) were randomly assigned to \"medical\" treatment (sulfisoxazole 75 mg/kg per day for 6 months) or \"surgical\" treatment (bilateral insertion of VTs). Subjects underwent pure-tone audiometry (500, 1000, 2000, 4000 Hz) and otomicroscopic examination at 2, 4, 6, 12, and 18 months. A significantly greater proportion of medical subjects (67%) than surgical subjects (48%) were treatment failures at 6, 12, or 18 months (P = .0208). Surgical subjects had significantly better hearing at 2 and 4 months (P values less than .01) but not at 6, 12, and 18 months (P values greater than .2). A significantly greater proportion of surgical subjects (50%) experienced complications of treatment than did medical subjects (9%) (P less than .001). Thirty-three percent of candidates for VT placement did not require surgery when treated with a 6-month course of sulfisoxazole.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The proportion of pediatricians who had encountered specific emergencies ranged from 86% for meningitis to 22% for cardiopulmonary arrest. The majority transported acutely ill children to an emergency department by ambulance. Availability of individual pieces of equipment and medications in offices ranged from 97% for epinephrine 1:1000 to 11% for bone marrow needles for intraosseous access. Combination of equipment available to manage particular emergencies ranged from 61% for severe dehydration to 11% for cardiopulmonary arrest. The equipment available in a pediatrician's office was significantly related to the type of primary work setting. Pediatrician confidence in managing the initial stabilization of emergencies ranged from 58% for seizures to 25% for epiglottitis. Confidence was related significantly to year residency was completed, Advanced Cardiac or Advanced Pediatric Life Support training, work setting, and the availability of equipment in the office. Continuing education regarding initial office management of and equipment for common emergencies should improve the pediatrician's confidence and competence in this area.\r"

A national survey of 254 ambulatory care centers was undertaken to determine their characteristics, including the number of pediatric patients seen, staffing patterns, and pediatric equipment and supplies available. Most clinics were located in urban areas and were within 5 miles of a hospital. They were staffed primarily by physicians who were board certified in emergency medicine, internal medicine, or family medicine. Not all centers had registered nurses on duty and few used extended-role nurses or physicians's assistants. The centers saw an average of 18 patients younger than 18 years of age per day. Some ambulatory care centers received emergency medical service and private ambulance calls and encountered serious illness such as chest pain, seizures, and anaphylaxis; the majority, however, handled mainly minor injuries and illnesses. Although most had pediatric equipment and supplies, some did not have a complete set of pediatric resuscitation equipment even though they were part of the emergency system offering care to the pediatric population.\r"

There were no deaths from tuberculosis. Early treatment is associated with a reduction in the serious forms of disease, eg, meningitis, miliary disease, and bone infections, and with preventing death. Medication was well tolerated: only 1.1% of the patients had adverse reactions, all of which were reversible. Consistent compliance with medication of only 62% of patients is a challenge to the medical profession. Only 22.5% of mycobacterial cultures were positive. Long-term follow-up of patients was rewarding: seven pregnancies with healthy mothers and babies, and no reactivation of tuberculosis by later infections, even those such as measles or pneumonia. The severity of disease was related largely to patient's age (3 years and younger) and intimacy of contact, the highest rate being when the mother was the contact. The long-term experiences emphasizes the value of early identification, therapeutic compliance, and comprehensive contact, tracing in the future elimination of tuberculosis. Prophylactic therapy and close observation should be considered for contacts, especially those exposed to human immunodeficiency virus infections and addicted to drugs.\r"

Transmission to nonsexual household contacts has appeared to be rare. A total of 505 sexual and nonsexual contacts of HIV-1-infected hemophiliacs in 349 households was observed. At entry, 10% of 201 sexual partners were anti-HIV-1-positive. Follow-up of 151 uninfected partners during a total of 351 person-years of observation showed no sero-conversions, although there were 13 pregnancies during that period. Eighty-seven percent of the seronegative respondents to a detailed questionnaire reported unprotected sexual contact at least occasionally. Among 304 other household members, including 108 parents who helped administer clotting factor concentrates to their children, none was seropositive at entry. Follow-up of 263 showed no seroconversions during a total of 605 person-years of observation. Thus, anti-HIV-1-positive hemophiliacs transmitted to their partners earlier in their course but were not found to do so when prospectively observed. No relationship to level of viremia as indicated by CD4 count, HIV-1 p24 antigenemia, or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome was found. Anti-HIV-1-positive hemophiliacs had not transmitted to their nonsexual household contacts before study entry and did not do so subsequently, indicating that the risk from even close nonsexual contact is extremely low.\r"

Their experience is described on the basis of 12 months of screening in 1665 children and adolescents. The overall 50th and 90th percentile values for a subgroup of 1406 routinely screened children were 156 and 197 mg/dL, respectively, but there was marked variation in these values among specific age and sex groups. Cholesterol levels decreased by age group during the early teenage years and increased thereafter, these changes occurring at ages approximately 2 years younger for girls than for boys. Further analysis of screening results for 398 sibling pairs demonstrated significant concordance between paired cholesterol levels when classified by the respective age- and sex-specific 90th percentile values for each member of the pair. Sibling pairs in which both members' cholesterol values exceeded their 90th percentile value were identified 2.4 times as frequently as expected (confidence interval 1.1 to 4.5, P = .029). The observations reported here indicate that office-based cholesterol screening in a pediatric practice may be both practical and useful, although further consideration of screening criteria is needed. Age- and sex-specific reference values for cholesterol levels during childhood could improve screening results. Special emphasis should be directed toward screening siblings of children in whom high cholesterol levels have been detected.\r"

The relation between plasma cotinine, a marker of exposure to tobacco smoke, and lipid profiles was studied in healthy adolescents from a suburban New York high school district who were undergoing preparticipation sports physicals. Forty-four percent of the adolescents reported that one or both parents currently smoked. Eleven percent of the adolescents had plasma cotinine concentrations greater than or equal to 2.5 ng/mL, the level considered indicative of exposure. Adolescents with two smoking parents had significantly higher plasma cotinine concentrations after adjustment for other factors than adolescents whose parents did not smoke. Plasma cotinine concentration greater than or equal to 2.5 ng/mL was associated with an 8.9% greater ratio of total cholesterol to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (P less than .003) and a 6.8% lower high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (P less than .03). These results suggest that passive smoking, like active smoking, leads to alterations in lipid profiles predictive of an increased risk of atherosclerosis.\r"

Fasting serum cholesterol (CHOL), triglyceride (TG) levels, and lipoprotein profiles were measured before therapy, 8 weeks after fish oil supplementation, and 4 weeks after its cessation. During 8 weeks of treatment the mean serum CHOL level did not change. The mean serum TG level, however, decreased significantly (P less than .01) from 236 +/- 31 mg/dL to 171 +/- 21 mg/dL (27.5%). Four weeks after treatment was stopped, the mean serum TG level returned to a value not significantly different from the pretreatment level (208 +/- 30 mg/dL). In a subgroup of 11 excessively hyperlipidemic patients, with serum CHOL and TG levels greater than or equal to 50% of the 90th percentile for age and sex, the mean serum TG level decreased even more (30.8%), from 286 +/- 35 mg/dL to 198 +/- 24 mg/dL (P less than .01), and the mean CHOL/high-density lipoprotein CHOL ratio decreased from 8.4 +/- 1.2 to 7.4 +/- 1.3 (P less than .05). Blood pressure and platelet counts remained stable during the entire study period. Side effects of the treatment were minimal. These results show that dietary fish oil supplementation reduces serum TG levels in young patients receiving renal replacement therapy and improves their \"atherogenic\" serum lipoprotein profile.\r"

These guidelines advocate a screening strategy that is targeted only at high-risk individuals. Detailed information regarding risk factors for hypercholesterolemia was obtained from 1001 adolescents or their parents at three urban teen clinics during routine health assessments. In addition, serum cholesterol was measured in all adolescents. The population under study was 38.2% Hispanic, 33.5% white, 15.4% black, and 11.3% Asian, with a mean age of 15.6 years (range: 12 through 21 years); 52% were female. Based on the cholesterol values, the study population was divided into two groups: (1) normal cholesterol level, less than 200 mg/dL (n = 937, mean cholesterol value = 157 mg/dL) and (2) elevated cholesterol level, greater than or equal to 200 mg/dL (n = 64, mean cholesterol value = 228 mg/dL, range = 200 through 366 mg/dL). Application of the 1985 American Academy of Pediatrics criteria for selected screening identified 30 of 64 individuals with hypercholesterolemia (sensitivity = 47%). Criteria similar to 1988 recommendations identified 40 of 64 teenagers (sensitivity = 62%). A combination of 1985 and 1988 criteria yielded a sensitivity of 44 of 64, or 69%. The specificity of these criteria was 74%, 60%, and 53%, respectively. Despite the utilization of the 1985, 1988, or a combination of both American Academy of Pediatrics criteria for hypercholesterolemia screening, this study demonstrates that many adolescents with abnormal cholesterol levels would not be identified.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Cerebrospinal fluid examinations revealed mild protein elevation in both and pleocytosis in the second infant. Enteroviruses were isolated in a nasal swab and stools of the second patient. Acute onset of flaccid paralysis with absent motor action potential and normal sensory responses, detected by electrophysiologic studies, are highly suggestive of motor anterior horn cell disease in these infants. A multifactorial setup of immune suppression, stress, and neurotoxic drugs during an acute bronchial asthma attack triggered by a viral disease may render the patient vulnerable to viral invasion of the anterior horn cell with enteroviruses other than poliovirus. The overall experience of 22 patients with this serious complication is reviewed.\r"

This places increased importance on understanding adolescent, family, and peer relationships, which are critical to healthy development among adolescents in general and to transitions to successful adulthood among youths with physical disabilities in particular. The purpose of this study was to identify the patterns of family and peer interactions. One hundred two youths with spina bifida and 60 adolescents with cerebral palsy between the ages of 12 and 22 completed written psychological measures as well as an in-depth structured interview. Approximately 90% of youths with spina bifida and cerebral palsy resided at home, of whom 80.4% and 72% lived with both parents. Almost without exception, parental relationships were defined as positive, with no difference of attitude noted toward the mother and father. Relationships with parents for teenagers with spina bifida were marked by high levels of dependence on parents for personal care such as bowel programs and, for both groups, low levels of responsibility at home and lack of discussion with parents about sexuality or menstruation. Although friends were viewed as very important by most respondents (approximately 83%), relationships were characterized by extremely limited out-of-school contacts, negligible participation with organized social activities, and a primary orientation toward sedentary activities. Finally, regarding heterosexual relationships, whereas 44.1% of respondents with spina bifida and 54.2% of respondents with cerebral palsy said their friends dated, only 14.7% and 28.3% of study participants indicated that they had ever been on a date and, even for those teenagers, heterosexual social contacts were infrequent.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The young children, relatives, neighbors, and friends of the 30,000 adults killed by firearms each year in the United States are also affected by this uniquely American epidemic. It is estimated that half of all American homes contain 200 million firearms, including 60 million handguns. Increasingly, pediatricians are becoming involved in efforts to reduce the prevalence of injuries from firearms, as parent educators, experts on children and adolescents, and advocates in the political process. This commentary is intended to aid in the last of these roles. The advocacy goal is identified as reducing the accessibility of guns in the environments of children and adolescents. The pros and cons of 17 possible approaches--ranging from mandatory safety courses in schools to handgun bans--are presented. It is concluded that, while there is no perfect approach, many available approaches will help; there is every reason to be both bold and optimistic.\r"

The sample consisted of parents of more than one third of the children and adolescents meeting inclusion criteria who were seen at a university-based pediatric clinic during a 10-week period. Parents were asked (1) whether schools need information about 16 health items, (2) who in the school should know, and (3) who should provide this information. Parents' willingness to disclose information was compared with family and child demographic data. Parents strongly believed that (1) teachers need to be informed and (2) parents should be the primary informers. The consensus that schools need information did not vary with family and child demographics. However, parents of children with poor illness prognosis, greater likelihood of emergencies, and visible illnesses were more supportive of disclosure. Most parents indicated that physicians should provide information on 10 of the 16 items. Physicians were viewed as particularly appropriate informers about recognizing emergencies and medication effects. Only 21% of the parents were aware of any prior contact between the medical care giver and the school concerning their child's illness. Thus, parents want schools informed and believe physicians should be involved in providing information.\r"

  ".W": "This study compared the acute and chronic effects of albuterol syrup (2 mg) and metaproterenol syrup (10 mg) three times a day over 28 days in 65 children, aged 6 to 9 years, with mild to moderate asthma. Wright peak flow, symptom scores, and rescue medication use were recorded twice daily during the 28 days; the acute cardiopulmonary effects of these syrups were compared over 8 hours on treatment days 1 and 28. Albuterol syrup produced a significantly greater peak magnitude of bronchodilation than metaproterenol, 29% vs 20% above baseline, respectively, on treatment day 1. Albuterol syrup had a duration of action of at least 8 hours and produced greater bronchodilation than metaproterenol syrup from 2 to 8 hours on both treatment days 1 and 28. The chronotropic effect of metaproterenol was greater than that of albuterol at 1 to 1 1/2 hours postdose on treatment days 1 and 28. There was a trend toward higher morning and evening Wright peak flow measurements during 28 days of treatment in the albuterol group. Side effects of both drugs were comparable. These findings imply therapeutic advantages of albuterol syrup over metaproterenol syrup in currently recommended doses with respect to improvement in pulmonary function, chronotropic effects, and frequency of dosing required to maintain optimum bronchodilation over a 24-hour period.\r"

Because most of these infants are fed iron-fortified formulas, it was of interest whether additional iron supplementation would enhance Hgb values. A cohort of 334 healthy, inner-city, minority, 6-month-old infants, fed iron-fortified formulas, with Hgb values ranging from 9 to 11.5 g/dL, participated in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of supplemental iron at 0, 3, and 6 mg/kg per day for 3 months. Hemoglobin values increased significantly with age, regardless of assignment to placebo or supplemental iron (means for the entire cohort: 6 months 10.9 g/dL, 8 months 11.2, 10 months 11.3, and 12 months 11.4). The proportion of \"responders\" (Hgb level increased greater than or equal to 1 g/dL) was 34% and did not differ significantly by placebo or iron dose. There were no significant differences in mean corpuscular volume or levels of erythrocyte porphyrins or serum ferritin between treatment groups. The implications of this clinical trial are twofold: (1) screening healthy infants fed iron-fortified formula at the age of 6 months is not justified, regardless of socioeconomic status; (2) the clinical practice of routinely treating low-income, \"low-Hgb\" infants with iron supplementation, without regard to dietary considerations, is unwarranted.\r"

The speech characteristics of 24 patients treated for galactosemia were examined. Fifty-four percent had the specific speech disorder, verbal dyspraxia. This finding was not related to age at diagnosis, severity of symptoms in the newborn period, or to biochemical control. There may be, however, a relation between dyspraxia and diminished IQ scores observed in the group of patients with dyspraxia judged as \"severe.\" The findings indicate the association of a specific and unusual speech defect with a specific and rare metabolic disorder.\r"

A randomized clinical trial involving 141 children (5- to 15-year-olds) tested the effectiveness of the intervention to improve the process and outcome of medical care. The intervention was contained in three brief videotapes (one each for parents, physicians, and patients) and in accompanying written materials. Materials were designed to build skills and motivation for increased child competence and participation during pediatric medical visits. Control subjects saw health education videotapes and received materials comparable in length with those of experimental subjects. Postintervention medical visit process was analyzed using videotapes of visits. Visit outcomes, assessed with standardized instruments and interviews, included children's rapport with physicians, children's anxiety, children's preference for an active health role, children's recall of information, parents' satisfaction with the medical visit, and physician satisfaction. Results indicated that physicians in the intervention group, compared with their counterparts in the control group, more often included children in discussions of medical recommendations (50% vs 29%, t = 2.39, P less than .05); that children in the intervention group, compared with control children, recalled more medication recommendations (77% vs 47%, P less than .01) and reported greater satisfaction and preference for an active health role; and that the intervention and control groups did not differ in parent satisfaction, physician satisfaction, or child anxiety. The results suggest that a brief educational intervention administered during waiting room time can positively impact physician-child rapport and children's preference for an active role in health and their acquisition of medical information.\r"

At 2 months of age, natural killer cell percent cytotoxicity was significantly higher in the breast-fed and NT+ groups compared with the NT- group (41.7 +/- 4.7, 32.2 +/- 3.4, 21.7 +/- 2.2%, respectively). Interleukin-2 production by stimulated mononuclear cells was higher in the NT+ compared with the NT- group at 2 months of age (0.90 +/- 0.28 U/mL, 0.27 +/- 0.11 U/mL, respectively); neither formula-fed group differed significantly from the breast-fed group.

At baseline, the mean age was 1.9 years (+/- 1.4), and all were symptomatic: 43% were P2A and 57% were P2B to F according to the Centers for Disease Control classification. All the patients received zidovudine for at least 6 months, and 52 of them (87%) completed a full year of therapy. The mean duration of follow-up was 346 days (+/- 42) (range, 183 to 366 days). The initial therapy consisted of four daily doses of 100 mg/m2 (400 mg/m2 per day, equivalent to 20 mg/kg per day). However, this treatment was modified when neutropenia or anemia was observed. Twenty-nine children (48%) remained at the initial therapy for the entire study. Zidovudine dosage was adjusted 92 times in the other 31 children (52%), mostly due to neutropenia (83%). Altogether, the time under full-dose therapy represented 81% of the total duration of the protocol for all patients. Children with mild symptoms, P2A at study entry, were more likely to remain under full-dose therapy than children with severe symptoms, P2B to F: the time under full-dose therapy represented 91% of the duration of the protocol for the former group and only 74% for the latter one (P less than .02). No clinical adverse experiences were attributed directly to zidovudine. Thirty-seven children were prescribed trimethoprim-sulfametoxazole as a prophylaxis for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Onset can be sudden or insidious. The syndrome is characterized primarily by localized, deep, burning pain in a limb--pain that may not follow any logical distribution. Nonpitting edema, skin hyperesthesia, and guarding of the limb usually accompany the pain. If treatment is not instituted, deformity, contracture, and wasting of the limb can eventually occur. With appropriate therapy, the process can be stopped and often reversed. The keys are a high index of suspicion, early diagnosis, and aggressive treatment.\r"

The safest and most effective pharmacologic intervention is use of benzodiazepines, either alone or in conjunction with antipsychotic agents when indicated. Seclusion or restraint may be needed for some violent patients; in such situations, close patient monitoring and explicit documentation are essential. Physicians can be held liable for injuries patients sustain while being restrained, so staff members should receive instruction in safe physical intervention techniques.\r"

  ".W": "The spatiotemporal expression of the extracellular matrix protein cytotactin/tenascin during somitogenesis suggests that it plays a role in the morphogenetic events that give rise to the pattern of neural crest (NC) development. In the present study, the spatial distribution and molecular forms of cytotactin in somites were examined using in situ hybridization, Western blotting, and immunohistochemistry during normal development and after injury. In situ hybridization showed that prior to NC cell invasion cytotactin mRNA was restricted to the caudal half of the newly formed epithelial somites. As each epithelial somite matured, giving rise to a sclerotome and dermamyotome, the mRNA was first restricted to the dermamyotome and later restricted to the rostral protion of the sclerotome, consistent with the previously reported protein distribution. Immunocytochemical analysis of the distribution of cytotactin and NC cells in embryos with ablations that removed NC cells, or with simple wounds that left NC cells in place, demonstrated that the presence of NC cells is neither necessary nor sufficient for the correct positioning of cytotactin. Immunoblotting analysis showed that cytotactin synthesized by sclerotomes in the absence of NC cells was of similar molecular mass to that produced in their presence. These findings are in accord with the notion that the abnormalities of cytotactin distribution are related to the wounding process. We conclude that, contrary to the suggestion of Stern et al. [Stern, C. D., Norris, W. E., Bronner-Fraser, M., Carlson, G. J., Faissner, A., Keynes, R. J. & Schachner, M. (1989) Development 107, 309-319], there is no causal link between the presence of NC cells and the distribution and molecular mass of sclerotomal cytotactin.\r"

  ".U": "91319693\r", 
  ".W": "Effective stimulation of CD4+ T cells in an immune response depends on activation signals transduced via not only the CD3-T-cell receptor (TCR) complex but also those generated by accessory cell-surface proteins, including some that mediate adhesion between T cells and antigen-presenting cells (APC). Three members of the Ig superfamily, CD54 [intercellular cell adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1)], CD58 [lymphocyte function-associated antigen 3 (LFA-3)], and B7, expressed on the surface of APC, have been shown to mediate both adhesion and signaling during T cell-APC interactions. Recently another member of the Ig superfamily, [vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1; INCAM110)], has been identified. VCAM-1 mediates adhesion between endothelial cells and activated lymphocytes and certain tumor cells. Here, using a soluble VCAM-1 fusion protein with receptor globulin (Rg), we examined the role of VCAM-1 in T-cell activation. We observed that CD4+ T cells, which are inefficiently stimulated by immobilized anti-TCR-1 or anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody (mAb) alone, can be induced to proliferate when exposed to immobilized VCAM-1-Rg in conjunction with either immobilized anti-TCR-1 or immobilized anti-CD3 mAb. The costimulatory effects of VCAM-1-Rg on CD4+T cells is inhibited by mAb to either the CD29 (integrin beta 1)-CD49d [very late activation antigen 4 alpha (VLA-4 alpha)] complex on the surface of CD4+ T cells or to VCAM-1. Stimulation of CD4+ T cells with immobilized VCAM-1-Rg and anti-TCR or -CD3 mAb results in the synthesis of both interleukin 2 (IL-2) receptors and IL-2. In addition, anti-CD25 (anti-IL-2 receptor a) mAb significantly inhibited the VCAM-1-Rg/anti-TCR or -CD3 mAb-driven activation of CD4+ T cells, indicating that endogenously produced IL-2 is in part responsible for the observed T-cell proliferation. Collectively, these results suggest that VCAM-1 can play an important costimulatory role during the activation of CD4+ T cells.\r"

  ".U": "91319694\r", 
  ".W": "Human corticosteroid binding globulin (hCBG) is a 50- to 55-kDa serum glycoprotein that binds cortisol and progesterone with high affinity. To map the steroid-binding domain and to investigate the folding pathways of hCBG, we have established an expression system based on infection of insect cells with a recombinant baculovirus encoding hCBG. Infected Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) cells secrete immunoreactive hCBG at high levels (16-24 pmol per 10(6) cells per 40 h), and the recombinant protein binds cortisol with an affinity and specificity equivalent to that of human serum-derived hCBG. Thus, this system has the potential to provide large amounts of wild-type and mutant hCBGs for physical-chemical analysis. Cotranslational asparagine-linked glycosylation is essential for acquisition of steroid-binding capability, as shown by the lack of cortisol-binding activity of unglycosylated hCBG secreted in the presence of tunicamycin. Golgi-associated oligosaccharide processing, however, is not required for activity, as demonstrated by the endoglycosidase H susceptibility of the fully active, secreted glycoprotein. Comparison of the steroid-binding properties of intracellular and secreted hCBG with that synthesized in vitro in the rabbit reticulocyte lysate system suggests that this protein undergoes a maturation process during transport through the secretory pathway. This system will be useful for identifying the molecular determinants of biological function in hCBG.\r"

Using a biologically active 32P-labeled human relaxin, we have previously shown by in vitro autoradiography specific relaxin binding sites in rat uterus, cervix, and brain tissues. Using the same approach, we describe here a detailed localization of human relaxin binding sites in the rat brain. Displaceable relaxin binding sites are distributed in discrete regions of the olfactory system, neocortex, hypothalamus, hippocampus, thalamus, amygdala, midbrain, and medulla of the male and female rat brain. Characterization of the relaxin binding sites in the subfornical organ and neocortex reveals a single class of high-affinity sites (Kd = 1.4 nM) in both regions. The binding of relaxin to two of the circumventricular organs (subfornical organ and organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis) and the neurosecretory magnocellular hypothalamic nuclei (i.e., paraventricular and supraoptic nuclei) provides the anatomical and biochemical basis for emerging physiological evidence suggesting a central role for relaxin in the control of blood pressure and hormone release. We conclude that specific, high-affinity relaxin binding sites are present in discrete regions of the rat brain and that the distribution of some of these sites may be consistent with a role for relaxin in control of vascular volume and blood pressure.\r"

Single-channel conductance properties were studied in planar lipid bilayers. The synthetic protein emulates the ionic conductance, ionic selectivity, and pharmacological properties of the authentic calcium channel, including the stereospecific action of agonist and antagonist enantiomers of the dihydropyridine BayK 8644. The identified sequence is identical in L-type calcium channels from skeletal muscle and isoforms of cardiac muscle, brain, and aorta. It is plausible that this structural motif represents the molecular blueprint for the pore-forming structure of voltage-gated calcium channels.\r"

  ".W": "We have applied local density functional theory, an ab initio quantum mechanical method, to study the shift in the spatial electron density of the substrate dihydrofolate that accompanies binding to the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase. The results shed light on fundamental electronic effects due to the enzyme that may contribute to catalysis. In particular, the enzyme induces a long-range polarization of the substrate that perturbs its electron density distribution in a specific and selective way in the vicinity of the bond that is reduced by the enzyme. Examination of the electron density changes that occur in folate reveals that a similar effect is seen but this time specifically at the bond that is reduced in this substrate. This suggests that the polarization effect may be implicated in the reaction mechanism and may play a role in determining the sequence whereby the 7,8-bond in folate is reduced first, followed by reduction of the 5,6-bond in the resulting dihydro compound.\r"

Pancreatic tissues from such transgenic mice were studied between 8 and 32 days of age. Virtually 100% of acinar cell nuclei had immunohistochemically detectable tumor antigen by 18 days. Tetraploid cells were demonstrated by DNA content flow cytometry by 20 days and were associated with the appearance of interphase cells that had 5-11 centrioles per cell in single thin sections of pancreatic tissue examined by electron microscopy. Mitotic cells also were observed that had 5 or more centrioles per cell that were incorporated into the poles of bipolar or at least tripolar spindle apparatuses. These observations indicate that formation of the tetraploid intermediate in the diploid----tetraploid----aneuploid sequence of pancreatic tumor formation in elastase-simian virus 40 tumor antigen transgenic mice is accompanied by the development of cells with 5 or more centrioles that can be incorporated into the poles of abnormal mitotic spindles. We speculate that cells with more than 4 centrioles are predisposed to the formation of multipolar mitoses that may yield daughter cells with chromosomal gains and losses, resulting in the subsequent development of aneuploid tumors.\r"

Mapping studies identified the preferential site of cleavage as a set of tandemly repeated dodecamers, the DR2 repeats. Endonuclease levels vary according to the proliferative state of the cell; little or no activity is detectable in extracts from quiescent cells, whereas high levels are expressed in dividing cells. Also, infection of density-arrested BSC-1 cells with HSV-1 induces a substantial increase (at least 35-fold) in endonucleolytic activity, which is first detectable at about 1 hr after infection at 32 degrees C. The elevated levels of enzyme activity then persist throughout the viral life cycle. In addition to the HSV-1 DR2 repeats, certain other G+C-rich sequences with an asymmetric distribution of purines and pyrimidines on the DNA strands and with appropriate sequences and lengths are substrates for the nuclease. These data indicate that target site recognition by the enzyme is conformation specific rather than sequence specific.\r"

  ".W": "Transgenic mice of an inbred black strain were previously produced with the Tyr-SV40E transgene, comprising simian virus 40 transforming sequences driven by the tyrosinase promoter, in order to obtain melanomas; the animals were found to be lighter than normal in coat color, to various degrees. As described here, hypopigmentation resulted from diminished differentiation of melanized pigment granules in the melanocytes of the hair bulbs in vivo and occurred autonomously in cultured melanocytes. Whereas some of the mice had single-color coats, most (7/13) had coats of two or three colors; in addition, one single-color founder produced a two-color descendant. These eight mice had patterns seen in natural genotypes; the most striking were transversely striped to various extents, with regions of left-right asymmetry on either side of the dorsal midline. The patterns visualized the same clonal developmental territories of coat melanocytes displayed in allophenic mice that are formed from conjoined early embryo cells of different color genotypes. Some of the Tyr-SV40E transgenics were also cellular genotypic mosaics, probably arising by late integration of the transgene. However, one transgenic founder with a completely striped coat proved to be true-breeding, with autosomal inheritance of the pattern. The inherited striped pattern thus exemplifies the formation of phenotypically different but genetically identical developmental clones, or phenoclones, among cells of the same type. This line of transgenic mice provides exceptional material for experimental analysis of the molecular basis for clonal variation in gene expression and of the fate of oncogenic phenoclones of melanocytes occurring in the same individual.\r"

Twenty-eight of 43 MS lesions contained TCR gamma delta cells and these were most frequently found in chronically demyelinated areas, in contrast to the previously studied CD4+, CD8+ (TCR alpha beta) population, which predominated in more active lesions. Some TCR gamma delta lymphocytes had an unusual morphology with long dendritic processes, which were sometimes interconnected forming a network. Because it is generally believed that TCR gamma delta lymphocytes function in a cytotoxic fashion in association with heat shock proteins (hsp), we examined the colocalization of TCR gamma delta cells with 65- and 70-kDa hsp (hsp65 and hsp70) in MS lesions. Hsp65 was expressed on immature oligodendrocytes at the margins of chronic lesions containing TCR gamma delta lymphocytes. The coexpression of these molecules might imply functional relationships perhaps of significance to the chronicity of the MS disease process and the failure of CNS remyelination.\r"

This modification resulted in denaturation of apolipoprotein AI on SDS/PAGE and increased the negative charge on agarose gel electrophoresis. When incubated with macrophage-derived foam cells, native HDL caused a marked efflux of cholesterol from them, leading to a decrease in the amount of cholesteryl ester in the cells. However, oxidized HDL showed a lessened effect on the decrease of cholesteryl ester in foam cells. These data suggest that oxidative modification of HDL may stimulate development of atherosclerosis by limiting efflux of cholesterol from foam cells.\r"

The variable nature of turbulent air flow makes such a remote sensing problem solvable if the animal can make use of the information conveyed by the fluctuation with time of the mixture of odor sources. Behavioral evidence suggests that such analysis takes place. An adaptive network can solve the essential problem, isolating the quality and intensity of the components within a mixture of several individual unknown odor sources. The network structure is an idealization of olfactory bulb circuitry. The dynamics of synapse change is essential to the computation. The synaptic variables themselves contain information needed by higher processing centers. The use of the same axons to convey intensity information and quality information requires time-coding of information. Covariation defines an individual odor source (object), and this may have a parallel in vision.\r"

Mutant viruses deficient in E1A expression replicate in HepG2 cells. Induction with IL-6 leads to significant enhancement of synthesis of viral early E1B and E2ae mRNAs by greater than 30-fold and increases viral replication to the wild-type levels. The E1A-substituting activity activates E1A-responsive promoters in transient transfection, and this transcriptional activity is regulated by IL-6 induction. Formation of distinct protein-promoter complexes by binding of proteins in nuclear extracts prepared from HepG2 cells to the E1A-dependent E2ae promoter further supports the possibility that this activity may be a nuclear component in the IL-6 signal transduction pathway.\r"

  ".W": "Loss of heterozygosity is a significant oncogenetic mechanism and can involve a variety of mechanisms including chromosome loss, deletion, and homologous interchromosomal mitotic recombination. Analysis of H-2 antigen-loss variants from heterozygous murine cell lines provides an experimental system to estimate the relative contributions of different mechanisms for allele loss and to compare the chromosomal patterns of mitotic and meiotic recombination. Cytotoxic anti-H-2D antibodies and complement were used to isolate 161 independent target antigen-negative clones from H-2d/H-2b heterozygous cell lines; of these, 131 (84.5%) lost the allele encoding the target antigen. Allele-loss variants were typed and scored as either heterozygous or homozygous for six H-2D-proximal chromosome 17 markers and for one distal marker by restriction enzyme-site variations and Southern analysis. A single mitotic crossover could account for 50 clones (37%), with heterozygosity for at least one proximal marker and loss of heterozygosity for all markers distal to the putative recombination site. Eighty-two allele-loss variants (60%) were homozygous for all markers; the origin of these clones could be either chromosome loss or mitotic recombination between the centromere and the most proximal marker. Only 4 clones (3%) arose through more complex events such as multiple crossovers or deletion. A mitotic linkage map for mouse chromosome 17 was constructed, and the gene order deduced from somatic recombination was identical to that obtained by conventional transmission genetics. These results demonstrate that mitotic recombination is a common event leading to allele loss, in spite of the lack of evidence for frequent somatic pairing of homologous chromosomes. Mitotic mapping provides a defined system for comparison of mitotic and meiotic recombination and may lead to practical advances for elucidating somatic mechanisms of oncogenesis and for gene therapy in targeting mutations to specific sites through homologous recombination.\r"

The adenovirus type 5 E1A oncogene, which induces susceptibility to lysis by natural killer cells and encodes epitopes recognized by cytotoxic T lymphocytes, was transfected into highly tumorigenic sarcoma cells. E1A expression in these sarcoma cells eliminated their tumorigenicity in recipients with natural killer cell activity that was competent to lyse these E1A-positive targets. Thymus-dependent responses were not required for tumor rejection. These results indicate that oncogene-regulated cellular pathways that affect neoplastic cell susceptibility to natural killer cell lytic mechanisms may influence tumor development in the immunocompetent host.\r"

More recent reports have suggested that v-abl can, however, cause a disease similar to CML. We demonstrate here that v-abl, when transduced in a helper virus-containing system, causes disease similar to, but distinct from, the CML-like syndrome induced by bcr-abl. Animals whose bone marrow has been infected by v-abl virus develop modest splenomegaly, marked granulocytosis, and malignant disease of several hematopoietic cell types. Unlike animals with CML-like disease resulting from bcr-abl, the polymorphonuclear leukocytes from animals infected with a v-abl construct do not contain the v-abl provirus at a significant frequency.

The results showed that an activin homologue is, indeed, contained in unfertilized eggs and blastulae of Xenopus laevis in a considerable amount. This activity was eluted at the same retention time as human activin A when fractionated by reversed-phase HPLC. Furthermore, the fraction containing erythroid-differentiating factor activity had mesoderm-inducing activity on Xenopus animal-cap cells. The mesoderm-inducing activity of this fraction was suppressed when coincubated with follistatin, an activin-binding protein.

We have transiently transfected these promoters fused to the human growth hormone in their methylated or unmethylated state into mouse L or F9 cells. Promoters methylated by methylase (M.) Hpa II and M.Hha I caused inhibition of reporter gene expression in L cells but not in F9 cells, while methylation of all CpGs by M.Sss I caused inhibition in both cell lines. Repression of promoter activity by M.Hpa II and M.Hha I methylation, but not by M.Sss I methylation, could be alleviated by cotransfection with an excess of untranscribable DNA methylated with M.Sss I. The methylated sites in nuclei isolated from the transfected L cells, but not F9 cells, were found to be protected from Msp I digestion. Taken together these results suggest that a factor present in L cells and missing in F9 cells mediates the methylation-directed inhibition of promoter activity. The ability of methylated DNA to overcome the inhibition seems to reflect competition for the mediator factor. Interestingly, treatment with Zn2+ ions brought about activation of the methylated promoter of the metallothionein gene. Similarly, butyrate could override the repression of the thymidine kinase methylated promoter. These activations were not accompanied by demethylation of the promoter or displacement of the mediator factor.\r"

  ".W": "Of two closely related species of geese, one, the greylag goose, lives in the Indian plains all year round, while the other, the bar-headed goose, lives at the Tibetan lakes and migrates across the Himalayas to winter in India. Another species, the Andean goose, lives in the High Andes all year round. Possession of a Hb with high oxygen affinity helps to adapt bar-headed and Andean geese to high altitudes. The Hb amino acid sequences of the bar-headed and the greylag geese differ by four substitutions, of which only one is unique among bird sequences: Pro-119 alpha (H2)----Ala. Perutz proposed that the two-carbon gap left by this substitution at the alpha 1 beta 1 contact raises the oxygen affinity, because it relaxes the tension in the deoxy or T structure [Perutz, M. F. (1983) Mol. Biol. Evol. 1, 1-28]. It was later found that the Hb of the Andean goose has a gap in the same position, due to the complementary substitution Leu-55 beta (D6)----Ser. We have tested Perutz's hypothesis by introducing each of these substitutions into human globin synthesized in Escherichia coli. The reconstituted Hbs combine cooperatively with oxygen. Their oxygen affinities exceed that of normal human Hb by an even larger factor than that found between the high-flying geese and the greylag goose. The mutant Hb Met-55 beta (D6)----Ser was crystallized. Its structure is the same as that of HbA, except in the immediate environment of the gap left by the substitution of the serine for the methionine side chain, which evidently causes the increased oxygen affinity of this Hb.\r"

  ".W": "Leukocyte adherence to endothelium is in part mediated by the transient expression of endothelial-leukocyte adhesion molecule 1 (ELAM-1) on endothelial surfaces stimulated by tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF), interleukin (IL) 1, or bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The intracellular factors controlling induction of ELAM-1 mRNA and protein are unknown. In nuclear runoff experiments with cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC), we demonstrate that transcriptional activation of the ELAM-1 gene occurs following stimulation with TNF. Sequence analysis of the 5' flanking region of the ELAM-1 gene reveals consensus DNA-binding sequences for two known transcription factors, NF-kappa B and AP-1. Gel mobility shift assays demonstrate that TNF, IL-1, or LPS (but not IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, interferon gamma, histamine, or transforming growth factor beta) induces activation of NF-kappa B-like DNA binding activity in HUVEC. In contrast, neither TNF, IL-1, nor LPS activates proteins that bind to an AP-1 consensus sequence under these experimental conditions. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, a known activator of protein kinase C (PKC), weakly induces NF-kappa B-like activity, ELAM-1 mRNA, and ELAM-1 surface expression in HUVEC. However, TNF, IL-1, and LPS do not activate PKC in HUVEC at doses that strongly induce NF-kappa B-like protein activation and ELAM-1 gene expression. PKC blockade with H7 does not inhibit activation of these NF-kappa B-like proteins but does inhibit ELAM-1 gene transcription. We conclude that PKC-independent activation of NF-kappa B in HUVEC with TNF, IL-1, or LPS is associated with, but not sufficient for, activation of ELAM-1 gene transcription.\r"

This effect of calcium on channel gating is usually explained in terms of the surface charge hypothesis, which proposes that local adsorption of calcium ion to the outside of the membrane alters the intramembranous electric field, thus influencing channel behavior indirectly. Calcium ion has also been shown to block Na channels, most strongly at negative voltage. We have examined these two apparently separate effects of calcium, the gating effect and Ca block, and find the two are closely correlated. We propose that calcium (or a suitable substitute) is an essential cofactor in normal gating and that it produces gating and blocking effects by binding within the channel.\r"

The first carotenoid of the pathway is phytoene, a colorless compound that is converted into colored carotenoids through a series of desaturation reactions. Genes coding for carotenoid desaturases have been cloned from microbes but not from plants. We report the cloning of a cDNA for pds1, a soybean (Glycine max) gene that, based on a complementation assay using the photosynthetic bacterium Rhodobacter capsulatus, codes for an enzyme that catalyzes the two desaturation reactions that convert phytoene into zeta-carotene, a yellow carotenoid. The 2281-base-pair cDNA clone analyzed contains an open reading frame with the capacity to code for a 572-residue protein of predicted Mr 63,851. Alignment of the deduced Pds1 peptide sequence with the sequences of fungal and bacterial carotenoid desaturases revealed conservation of several amino acid residues, including a dinucleotide-binding motif that could mediate binding to FAD. The Pds1 protein is synthesized in vitro as a precursor that, upon import into isolated chloroplasts, is processed to a smaller mature form. Hybridization of the pds1 cDNA to genomic blots indicated that this gene is a member of a low-copy-number gene family. One of these loci was genetically mapped using restriction fragment length polymorphisms between Glycine max and Glycine soja. We conclude that pds1 is a nuclear gene encoding a phytoene desaturase enzyme that, as its microbial counterparts, contains sequence motifs characteristic of flavoproteins.\r"

According to sedimentation equilibrium measurements, around 85% of the vesicles were devoid of protein. The remaining 15% contained either a single band 3 monomer or, when crosslinked band 3 protein was used, a single band 3 dimer. Vesicles containing either single monomers or single dimers showed a rapid, inhibitor-sensitive sulfate efflux, and the turnover numbers of band 3 for the inhibitor-sensitive flux component were identical in both systems. This shows that monomeric band 3 protein is able to transport anions and that dimerization of the protein does not change its transport activity.\r"

Although the purified preparations of SecY and SecE were still contaminated with minute amounts of other proteins, the elution profiles of SecY and SecE on column chromatographies coincided with the elution profiles of reconstituted translocation activity, indicating that SecY and SecE are the indispensable components in these preparations.

  ".U": "91319723\r", 
  ".W": "Epstein-Barr virus transformation of human B lymphocytes in vitro results in the expression of six viral nuclear antigens (EBNAs) and three viral membrane proteins. However, examination of viral gene expression in fresh Burkitt lymphoma isolates has revealed expression of only one of the nuclear antigens, EBNA-1. Previous transcriptional analyses of the EBNA-encoding genes demonstrated that all these genes are driven from one of two distal promoters located near the left end of the viral genome, raising the question of how exclusive expression of EBNA-1 occurs in Burkitt lymphoma tumors. Although most established Burkitt lymphoma cell lines (group 3) exhibit the full-expression pattern of viral antigens seen in lymphoblastoid cell lines, a few cell lines have been established that retain the restricted pattern of viral gene expression (group 1). In this paper we characterize transcription of the EBNA-1 gene in a group 1 Burkitt lymphoma cell line and show that (i) neither Cp nor Wp, the promoters involved in driving EBNA gene expression in lymphoblastoid cell lines, are active in this cell line; (ii) treatment of this cell line with 5-azacytidine, previously shown to induce expression of all EBNA genes, induced Cp and Wp activity; (iii) sizes of the EBNA-1 transcripts detected in two group 1 Burkitt lymphoma cell lines correlated with each other and were distinct from the size of the EBNA-1 transcript seen in lymphoblastoid cell lines; (iv) the EBNA-1 transcripts in the group 1 Burkitt lymphoma cell lines do not hybridize to a probe containing the common 5' exons present in all the EBNA transcripts from lymphoblastoid cell lines; and (v) anchored-PCR cloning the 5' region of the EBNA-1 transcript from one of the group 1 cell lines identified two exons, FQ and U, upstream of the EBNA-1 coding exon. The FQ exon lies just downstream of a TATAA box, which may represent the promoter for transcription of EBNA-1 in these cells. It is particularly noteworthy that an incomplete EBNA-1 cDNA clone from a nasopharyngeal carcinoma tumor line that expresses EBNA-1, but not the other EBNAs, has been characterized; this EBNA-1 transcript also contains the FQ/U splice junction, suggesting that the organization of exons upstream of the EBNA-1 coding exon is the same and that this organization may reflect a viral program for exclusive EBNA-1 expression.\r"

The recombinant 1,25-(OH)2D3 receptor is full-length, binds 1,25-(OH)2D3, and is recognized by a monoclonal antibody specific for 1,25-(OH)2D3 receptor. Densitometric scanning of Coomassie brilliant blue-stained SDS/polyacrylamide gels indicated a recombinant receptor protein level comprising 5% of the total soluble protein from the insect cells. The hydroxylapatite binding assay revealed average levels of 2 nmol of unoccupied 1,25-(OH)2D3 receptor per mg of protein in insect cells at 72 hr after infection with recombinant baculovirus. A measure of total 1,25-(OH)2D3 receptor using a ligand-independent, immunoradiometric assay disclosed average levels of 2.3 nmol of receptor per mg of protein produced by these same cells. A monoclonal antibody directed against the 1,25-(OH)2D3 receptor, and reported to cross-react with this receptor derived from several species, recognized the recombinant rat 1,25-(OH)2D3 receptor upon Western analysis. A monoclonal antibody directed specifically against the porcine receptor failed to recognize the recombinant rat 1,25-(OH)2D3 receptor protein. The cytosolic preparation of insect cells infected with recombinant baculovirus exhibited an equilibrium dissociation constant of 1 x 10(-11) M as determined by a 1,25-(OH)2D3 saturation analysis plotted by the method of Scatchard. This expression system provides an adequate source from which abundant quantities of 1,25-(OH)2D3 receptor can be purified for subsequent x-ray crystallographic analyses.\r"

A marked increase in both PDGF A- and B-chain mRNA could be demonstrated in glomerular RNA by Northern blot analysis 3 and 5 days after disease induction, corresponding to the time of mesangial cell proliferation. PDGF-R beta-subunit mRNA and protein were also increased in glomeruli in mesangial proliferative nephritis, being maximal at day 5. The principal cells expressing PDGF B-chain appeared by immunostaining to be a subpopulation of mesangial cells; in contrast, the majority of the mesangial cells expressed the PDGF-R beta-subunit protein. Both complement depletion and platelet depletion significantly reduced cell proliferation and expression of both PDGF and PDGF-R. Thus, in mesangial proliferative nephritis there is a platelet- and complement-mediated induction of PDGF A and B chain and PDGF-R beta-subunit gene transcription and protein synthesis. The finding that the majority of PDGF is produced by the mesangial cell supports the role of PDGF as an autocrine growth factor in glomerulonephritis.\r"

In the context that the lung is the major site of morbidity and mortality in CF, we evaluated airway epithelial cells for CFTR mRNA transcripts in normal individuals, normal-delta Phe508 heterozygotes, and delta Phe508 homozygotes to determine if the normal and delta Phe508 CFTR alleles are expressed in the respiratory epithelium, to what extent they are expressed, and whether there are relative differences in the expression of the normal and abnormal alleles at the mRNA level. Respiratory tract epithelial cells recovered by fiberoptic bronchoscopy with a cytology brush demonstrated CFTR mRNA transcripts with sequences appropriately reflecting the normal and delta Phe508 CFTR alleles of the various study groups. CFTR gene expression quantified by limited polymerase chain reaction amplification showed that in normal individuals, CFTR mRNA transcripts are expressed in nasal, tracheal, and bronchial epithelial cells at approximately 1-2 copies per cell, more than 100-fold greater than in pharyngeal epithelium. Importantly, allele-specific hybridization studies demonstrated that the normal and delta Phe508 CFTR alleles are expressed in the respiratory epithelium in similar amounts.\r"

This protein, TAP 29 (Trichosanthes anti-HIV protein, 29 kDa), is distinct from trichosanthin [also known as GLQ 223 (26 kDa)] in size, N-terminal amino acid sequence, and cytotoxicity. In addition to three conservative substitutions--namely, Arg-29 to Lys, Ile-37 to Val, and Pro-42 to Ser--a total difference of residues 12-16 was found. TAP 29 yielded -Lys-Lys-Lys-Val-Tyr-, whereas trichosanthin has -Ser-Ser-Tyr-Gly-Val-. Although the two proteins exhibit similar anti-HIV activity, as measured by syncytium formation, p24 expression, and HIV reverse transcriptase activity, they differ significantly in cytotoxicity, as measured by their effects on cellular DNA and protein syntheses. At the dose level of the bioassays, 0.34-340 nM, trichosanthin demonstrates a dose-dependent toxic effect on host cells. TAP 29 displays no toxic effect, even at 100 X ID50, whereas trichosanthin demonstrates 38% and 44% inhibition on cellular DNA and protein synthesis, respectively. These results indicate that the therapeutic index of TAP 29 is at least two orders of magnitude higher than that of trichosanthin. Thus TAP 29 may offer a broader safe dose range in the treatment of AIDS.\r"

  ".W": "Occupancy of the T-cell receptor complex does not appear to be a sufficient stimulus to induce a T-cell-mediated immune response. Increasing evidence suggests that cognate cell-cell interaction between an activated T cell and an antigen-presenting cell may provide such a stimulus. A candidate T-cell surface molecule for this costimulatory signal is the T-cell-restricted CD28 antigen. Following crosslinking with anti-CD28 mAb, suboptimally stimulated CD28+ T cells show increased proliferation and markedly increased secretion of a subset of lymphokines. Recently, the B-cell surface activation antigen B7 was shown to be a natural ligand for the CD28 molecule, and both B7 and CD28 are members of the immunoglobulin superfamily. Here we report that B7-transfected CHO cells can induce suboptimally activated CD28+ T cells to proliferate and secrete high levels of interleukin 2. The response is identical whether T cells are submitogenically stimulated with either phorbol myristate acetate or anti-CD3 to activate the T cells. This response is specific and can be totally abrogated with anti-B7 monoclonal antibody. As has previously been observed for anti-CD28 monoclonal antibody, B7 ligation induced secretion of interleukin 2 but not interleukin 4. We have previously demonstrated that B7 expression is restricted to activated B lymphocytes and interferon gamma-activated monocytes. Since these two cellular populations are involved in antigen presentation as well as cognate interaction with T lymphocytes, B7 is likely to represent a central constimulatory signal that is capable of amplifying an immune response.\r"

Glucocorticoids and cAMP increase PEPCK gene transcription and gluconeogenesis, whereas insulin and phorbol esters have the opposite effect. Insulin and phorbol esters are dominant, since they prevent cAMP and glucocorticoid-stimulated transcription. Basal promoter elements and hormone response elements for cAMP, glucocorticoids, and insulin have been defined in previous studies. By using stable transfectants containing a variety of different PEPCK-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase fusion gene constructs, a phorbol ester response sequence, located between positions -437 and -402 relative to the transcription start site, was identified. This region coincides with the insulin response sequence that has recently been defined in the PEPCK promoter. Using a vector containing various wild-type and mutated sequences of this region ligated to the heterologous thymidine kinase promoter, we delineated the boundaries of both elements to the 10 base pairs between positions -416 through -407. Thus, although it has been previously shown that insulin and phorbol esters repress PEPCK gene transcription through distinct pathways, the final target of insulin and phorbol ester action is the same DNA element.\r"

  ".W": "We describe here a family of biomimetic iron carriers that display high binding efficiency for ferric ions and favorable permeation properties across erythrocytic membranes. These carriers inhibit in vitro growth of Plasmodium falciparum by scavenging intracellular iron. The chemical features were realized by reproducing the iron-binding cavities of natural iron carriers (siderophores) and by systematic substitutions of their hydrophilic envelopes for more hydrophobic ones. In contrast to natural carriers, which participate in receptor-mediated iron uptake in cells and act as growth promoters, our synthetic carriers were designed to penetrate cellular membranes by diffusion, scavenge intracellular iron, and thereby act as growth inhibitors. Based on these properties we designate the compounds reversed siderophores and refer to the specific analogs of the natural ferrichrome as synthetic ferrichromes. The antimalarial activity of the synthetic ferrichromes correlated with their lipophilicity, and this antimalarial activity was averted when the chelators were applied as iron (III) complexes. The sites of synthetic ferrichrome action reside in the intraerythrocytic parasite and not in serum or on normal erythrocyte components. The agents were effective against all stages of parasite growth and against a variety of multidrug-resistant strains of P. falciparum. The most potent agent of this synthetic ferrichrome series, SF1-ileu, was not toxic to mammalian cells in culture and was 15-fold more potent and 20-fold faster acting than desferrioxamine. Taken in toto, these agents constitute a series of promising candidates for future use in malaria chemotherapy.\r"

  ".U": "91319731\r", 
  ".W": "The secretion of bile by the liver is primarily determined by the ability of the hepatocyte to transport bile acids into the bile canaliculus. A carrier-mediated process for the transport of taurocholate, the major bile acid in humans and rats, was previously demonstrated in canalicular membrane vesicles from rat liver. This process is driven by an outside-positive membrane potential that is, however, insufficient to explain the large bile acid concentration gradient between the hepatocyte and bile. In this study, we describe an ATP-dependent transport system for taurocholate in inside-out canalicular membrane vesicles from rat liver. The transport system is saturable, temperature-dependent, osmotically sensitive, specifically requires ATP, and does not function in sinusoidal membrane vesicles and right side-out canalicular membrane vesicles. Transport was inhibited by other bile acids but not by substrates for the previously demonstrated ATP-dependent canalicular transport systems for organic cations or nonbile acid organic anions. Defects in ATP-dependent canalicular transport of bile acids may contribute to reduced bile secretion (cholestasis) in various developmental, inheritable, and acquired disorders.\r"

This protein, p55, is copurified during the isolation of dematin, an actin-bundling protein of the erythrocyte membrane cytoskeleton. Fractions enriched in p55 also contain protein kinase activity that completely abolishes the actin-bundling property of purified dematin in vitro. The predicted amino acid sequence of p55 does not contain any consensus sequence corresponding to the catalytic domains of protein kinases but does contain a conserved sequence found in the noncatalytic domains of oncogene-encoded tyrosine kinases. This conserved src homology 3 (SH-3) motif appears to suppress the tyrosine kinase activity of various oncoproteins and has also been found in several plasma membrane associated proteins involved in signal transduction. Northern blot analysis indicated that p55 mRNA was constitutively expressed during erythropoiesis and underwent 2-fold amplification after induction of K562 erythroleukemia cells toward the erythropoietic lineage. The abundant expression of p55 mRNA, along with protein 4.1 mRNA, was evident in terminally differentiated human reticulocytes. Although p55 has many features consistent with known peripheral membrane proteins, its tight association with the plasma membrane is reminiscent of an integral membrane protein. This fact may be partly explained by the observation that p55 is the most extensively palmitoylated protein of the erythrocyte membrane.\r"

The truncated hGH lacked the signal peptide sequence required for its secretion. After transfection of these constructs into HeLa S3 cells, which do not normally synthesize hGH, the use of indirect immunofluorescence staining to follow the localization of the hGH chimeras demonstrated that both prothymosin and parathymosin caused targeting to the cell nucleus. Controls with a construct coding for native hGH only, and one coding for the truncated hGH lacking the signal peptide, revealed secretion into culture medium and staining in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus in the first case, and diffuse staining throughout the cytoplasm in the second. The results provide direct evidence, with proteins synthesized in situ, for the presence of nuclear localization signals in both prothymosin and parathymosin.\r"

The analysis demonstrated linkage of the disease and COL2A1 with a logarithm-of-odds score of 1.51 at zero recombination. A newly developed procedure for preparing cosmid clones was employed to isolate the allele for type II procollagen that was linked to the disease. Analysis of over 7000 nucleotides of the gene revealed a single base mutation that altered a CG dinucleotide and converted the codon CGA for arginine at amino acid position alpha 1-732 to TGA, a stop codon. From previous work on procollagen biosynthesis, it is apparent that the truncated polypeptide synthesized from an allele with a stop codon at alpha 1-732 cannot participate in the assembly of type II procollagen, and therefore that the mutation would decrease synthesis of type II procollagen. It was not apparent, however, why the mutation produced marked changes in the eye, which contains only small amounts of type II collagen, but relatively mild effects on the many cartilaginous structures of the body that are rich in the same protein.\r"

The first experiment defined the acquisition phase of the NM response for our laboratory. A group of rabbits (n = 6) was given 2 days of paired NM training; a second group (n = 6) was given 2 days of unpaired NM training. The data document a variable level of responding on day 1 for rabbits given paired training (mean +/- SEM, 21 +/- 11% CRs) but show that on day 2 most rabbits reached the behavioral asymptote (five of six rabbits responding with greater than 85% CRs). Rabbits responding at the behavioral asymptote were defined as having acquired the NM conditioned response. These data were interpreted to indicate that 1 day of training initiated processes necessary for behavioral acquisition (i.e., responding at the behavioral asymptote). A quantitative film autoradiographic study of [3H]phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate binding was then used to determine the distribution of hippocampal protein kinase C in rabbits sacrificed after receiving either 1 day of paired stimuli (n = 10), 1 day of unpaired stimuli (n = 6), or no stimuli (n = 6). Autoradiograms were analyzed by measuring binding in strictly defined regions of interest and from transept profiles. A significant increase in binding of the phorbol ester was found in the CA3 stratum oriens in the paired group relative to unpaired and naive controls. No other significant differences were found.\r"

Using in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry, we now demonstrate the presence of transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-beta 1), a potent profibrotic cytokine, in the foci containing these activated fibroblasts. These results suggest that matrix-associated TGF-beta 1 may serve as a stimulus for the persistent expression of connective tissue genes. One potential source of the TGF-beta 1 is the alveolar macrophage, and we demonstrate the expression of abundant TGF-beta 1 mRNA in alveolar macrophages in lung tissue from patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.\r"

The cholinesterase-like domain of these proteins, about 500 amino acids, may fulfill a catalytic and a structural function. We identified an aspartic acid residue that is conserved among esterases and lipases (Asp-397 in Torpedo acetylcholinesterase) but that had not been considered to be involved in the catalytic mechanism. Site-directed mutagenesis demonstrated that this residue is necessary for activity. Analysis of evolutionary relationships shows that the noncatalytic members of the family do not constitute a separate subgroup, suggesting that loss of catalytic activity occurred independently on several occasions, probably from bifunctional molecules. Cholinesterases may thus be involved in cell-cell interactions in addition to the hydrolysis of acetylcholine. This would explain their specific expression in well-defined territories during embryogenesis before the formation of cholinergic synapses and their presence in noncholinergic tissues.\r"

Heteroalleles were generated in the TK+/+ parent B-lymphoblast cell line WIL-2 by repeated exposure to the alkylating nitrogen mustard ICR-191, which preferentially causes +1 or -1 frameshifts. Resulting TK-/- mutants were selected in medium containing the toxic thymidine analog trifluorothymidine. Mutations were characterized by exon-specific polymerase chain reaction amplification and direct sequencing. In two lines, heterozygous frameshifts were located in exons 4 and 7 of the TK gene separated by approximately 8 kilobases. These lines undergo spontaneous reversion to TK+ at a frequency of less than 10(-7), and revertants can be selected in cytidine/hypoxanthine/aminopterin/thymidine medium. The nature and location of these heteroallelic mutations make large deletions, rearrangements, nondisjunction, and reduplication unlikely mechanisms for reversion to TK+. The mode of reversion to TK+ was specifically assessed by DNA sequencing, use of single-strand conformation polymorphisms, and analysis of various restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) linked to the TK gene on chromosome 17. Our data suggest that a proportion of revertants has undergone recombination and gene conversion at the TK locus, with concomitant loss of frameshifts and allele loss at linked RFLPs. Models are presented for the origin of two recombinants.\r"

  ".W": "Fragile sites are specific regions of chromosomes that are prone to breakage. In cells cultured under conditions that induce fragile site expression, high levels of inter- and intrachromosomal recombination have been observed involving chromosomal bands containing fragile sites. To determine whether expression of specific fragile sites would facilitate preferential integration of exogenous DNA at these recombination hot spots, the vector pSV2Neo was transfected into a Chinese hamster-human somatic cell hybrid containing a derivative chromosome 3 as its only human component. Chromosome 3 contains a common fragile site at band 3p14.2 (FRA3B) that is induced by aphidicolin. Both cells induced to express FRA3B and the uninduced control cells were transfected with the pSV2Neo selectable plasmid. In situ hybridization of a biotin-labeled pSV2Neo probe to metaphase chromosomes revealed one to three integration sites in each stably transfected clone. Four of 13 clones transfected under conditions of FRA3B induction showed integration of pSV2Neo at 3p14; these clones also showed specific integration into hamster chromosome 1 and a rearranged chromosome characteristic of CHO cells (mar2). The 7 control clones, however, showed an apparently random pattern of pSV2Neo integration. Significant hybridization of pSV2Neo to both FRA3B and Chinese hamster chromosomes 1 and mar2 was seen in 100 cells from pooled colonies transfected after treatment with aphidicolin. These results suggest that preferential integration of marker DNA into human and Chinese hamster fragile sites occurs with exposure to aphidicolin. The nature of the DNA sequences at fragile sites is unknown and, despite a number of approaches, these sequences have not yet been isolated; our procedure may represent an approach to the cloning of fragile sites.\r"

To our knowledge, this gene has not been evaluated in human germ-cell malignancies. In this study 67 primary testicular germ-cell tumors and 4 testicular non-germ-cell malignancies were examined to determine the prevalence and nature of RB gene alterations. Decreased expression of RB gene mRNA was found in all testicular germ-cell tumors (both seminomas and nonseminomas) examined. The RB protein could not be detected by immunohistochemical analysis in the undifferentiated cells of any germ-cell tumors whereas the differentiated malignant cells present in 14/15 teratocarcinomas expressed the protein. No gross alterations of the RB gene were found at DNA level in any of the examined specimens. This and the presence of the RB protein in the more differentiated tumor cells of teratocarcinomas suggest that changes in transcript levels rather than mutation(s) of the gene may be responsible for the absent or decreased RB expression in human germ-cell tumors. To date studies on the mechanism of RB regulation have demonstrated that it occurs at the protein level by phosphorylation of the p105 gene product. The findings presented here indicate that additional regulation might occur at the transcript level.\r"

The rate of substitution at synonymous sites was significantly higher for codons specifying the catalytic domain of the enzyme than for those encoding the NAD(+)-binding domain, but the nonsynonymous substitution rate showed the opposite relationship. For Salmonella, statistical tests for nonrandom clustering of polymorphic sites failed to provide evidence that intragenic recombination or gene conversion has contributed to the generation of allelic diversity. The topology of a tree constructed from the gapA sequences was generally similar to that of phylogenetic trees of the strains based on multilocus enzyme electrophoresis, but the level of divergence of gapA in Salmonella group V from other Salmonella and E. coli strains is much greater than that indicated by DNA hybridization for the genome as a whole.\r"

Close correspondence exists between the 3' end of the precoding intron and the 3' end of the bridge intron and between parts of the 3' noncoding region of the cDNA for the two-domain globin and the 5' end of the bridge intron.

Biol. 52, 901-905], suggests that many introns may have evolved from the 5' noncoding region of one gene and/or the 3' noncoding region of a second gene. This hypothesis implies that splice junctions would be associated with the original NH2 and COOH termini of proteins and provides an explanation for the observation that splice junctions usually map to protein surfaces. They do so because most NH2- and COOH-terminal residues are usually located on or near the surfaces of proteins.\r"

  ".W": "Two distinct soluble proteins that specifically bind 125I-labeled human growth hormone (GH) are identified in the supernatant of ultracentrifuged rabbit milk, using HPLC gel filtration. The higher molecular weight proteins is GH specific, whereas the other one is specific for prolactin (PRL). The PRL-binding protein has a very high affinity for the hormone, almost 10 times higher than the affinity of the mammary gland membrane receptor. The PRL-binding protein is immunoprecipitated by a monoclonal antibody against the PRL receptor; another monoclonal antibody, which inhibits the PRL binding to mammary gland membranes, is a poor competitor for the PRL binding to the milk protein. These findings suggest that the milk PRL-binding protein corresponds to the binding domain of the receptor, but also that the conformation of the receptor and of the binding protein might differ. The milk and the plasma GH-binding proteins have a similar binding affinity. In cross-linking experiments using 125I-labeled human GH, the Mr of the GH-binding protein and of the PRL-binding protein were estimated to be 51,000 and 33,000, respectively. The binding proteins identified in the present work are probably responsible for the transport of their specific ligands in the milk. It is also conceivable that they have a role in the effects of GH and PRL in the mammary gland and/or the intestine of the young.\r"

  ".U": "91319750\r", 
  ".W": "When the isolated D1/D2/cytochrome b559 complex was exposed to bright light, a distinctive pattern of D1 polypeptide fragments was observed under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. The major degradation product had an apparent molecular mass of 24 kDa, while other fragments were detected at 17, 14, and 10 kDa by immunoblotting. This pattern was observed when the electron acceptors 2,5-dibromo-3-methyl-6-isopropyl-p-benzoquinone or silicomolybdate were present during illumination. It is known that these conditions stabilize P680+ chlorophyll and bring about the photooxidation and destruction of pigments in the reaction center, particularly chlorophyll absorbing at 670 nm and beta-carotene. When P680+ was not allowed to accumulate, either by omission of an electron acceptor or by addition of both an electron donor (Mn2+) and an acceptor, no breakdown fragments were observed. In the former case, however, some degradation of the D1 and D2 polypeptides did occur. Under conditions that gave rise to the characteristic D1 breakdown pattern, the D2 polypeptide was also degraded to specific fragments detected at about 29 and 21 kDa by immunoblotting. The results indicate that the photoinduced degradation of D1 (and D2) does not involve exogenous proteases but is most likely an autoproteolytic process. Moreover, our data indicate that the photochemical damage giving rise to D1 and D2 degradation occurs on the oxidizing rather than the reducing side of photosystem II and involves photooxidation of the accessory pigments. The results are discussed in terms of D1 and D2 turnover and photoinhibition.\r"

A large proportion of the IPM is composed of aqueous-insoluble glycoconjugates, including chondroitin sulfate-containing proteoglycans, the distribution of which exhibits both apical-basal and photoreceptor cell type-specific heterogeneities. The precise function of most insoluble IPM constituents is unknown, although the available evidence suggests some may contribute to retinal adhesion or photoreceptor survival. We have now identified basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), or an immunologically related protein from the FGF family, within the IPM. The IPM is labeled on sections of primate retinas by a battery of polyclonal antibodies (Abs) directed against various peptide sequences of bFGF and by an Ab to bovine brain bFGF. bFGF Abs also bind to purified preparations of aqueous-insoluble IPM. All bFGF Abs utilized cross-react with equivalent low molecular mass components of 16.5-17.5 kDa on Western blots of insoluble IPM proteins, purified bFGF, and recombinant bFGF. The Abs do not bind any aqueous-soluble IPM components, suggesting that the bFGF is normally bound to an insoluble IPM constituent(s) in situ. The fact that bFGF is sequestered in the IPM and is located in such close proximity to the photoreceptors, the retinal pigmented epithelium, and Mueller's glia raises the strong possibility that it is synthesized by and regulates the activities of one or more of these three cell types in vivo.\r"

  ".W": "Genes at the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) in mammals are known to have exceptionally high polymorphism and linkage disequilibrium. In addition, these genes form highly complicated gene families that have evolved through gene conversion and unequal crossing-over. It has been shown recently that amino acid substitution at the antigen recognition site (ARS) is more rapid than synonymous substitution, suggesting some kind of positive natural selection working at the ARS. It is highly desirable to know the interactive effect of gene conversion and natural selection on the evolution and variation of MHC gene families. A population genetic model is constructed that incorporates both selection and gene conversion. Diversifying selection is assumed in which sequence diversity is enhanced not only between alleles at the same locus but also between duplicated genes. Expressed and nonexpressed loci are assumed as in the class I gene family of MHC, with gene conversion occurring among all loci. Extensive simulation studies reveal that very weak selection at individual amino acid sites in combination with gene conversion can explain the unusual pattern of evolution and polymorphisms. Here both gene conversion and natural selection contribute to enhancing polymorphism.\r"

These genetic cassettes also contained, on the same transcription unit, a gene encoding hygromycin resistance, which allowed selection for concomitant expression of the antisense gene. In transgenic lines, RNA transcripts of the predicted size and strand specificity were detected in antisense plants and sense controls. After infection of plants with TGMV, by agroinoculation, the frequency of symptom development was very significantly reduced in a number of antisense lines and correlated, broadly, with the abundance of antisense RNA transcript and with a reduction in viral DNA harvested from infected leaf tissue. We used an in vitro assay to study viral DNA replication in the absence of cell-to-cell spread; no replication was seen in five of the six antisense lines studied, in contrast to controls.\r"

To investigate the underlying mechanisms, we used the dorsal skinfold chamber model for intravital fluorescence microscopy of the microcirculation in striated muscle of awake hamsters. In control hamsters (n = 7), reperfusion after a 4-hr pressure-induced ischemia to the muscle tissue elicited the adhesion of fluorescently stained leukocytes to the endothelium of postcapillary venules, capillary obstruction, and the break-down of endothelial integrity. These microvascular manifestations of ischemia-reperfusion injury were significantly attenuated in animals (n = 7) when fed with a fish oil-enriched diet for 4 weeks prior to the experiments. In leukocyte total lipids, the fish oil diet resulted in a substantial displacement of arachidonic acid, the precursor of the potent adhesion-promoting leukotriene (LT) B4, by fish oil-derived eicosapentaenoic acid, the precursor of biologically less potent LTB5, emphasizing the mediator role of LTB4 in ischemia-reperfusion injury. These results suggest that the preservation of microvascular perfusion by dietary fish oil contributes to its protective effects on the clinical manifestations of ischemia-reperfusion injury.\r"

Binding of 125I-labeled endothelin 1 to the C6/SSPE cells was less than 5% of the binding to the C6 control cells, suggesting that the impairment in signal transduction was due to a loss of binding sites for endothelin 1. Treatment of the C6/SSPE cells with measles antiserum resulted in the loss of expression of viral proteins located in the membrane as well as inside the cells (antigenic modulation), but it restored neither the endothelin 1-induced Ca2+ rise nor the 125I-endothelin 1 binding. Cocultivation of uninfected C6 cells with C6/SSPE cells (9:1 ratio) resulting in contact-mediated transmission of measles virus showed that the 125I-endothelin 1 binding activity was gradually lost as a consequence of persistent virus infection.\r"

Virus-infected CD4+ lymphocytes were completely protected by 0.5 microM OC, whereas no toxicity was observed at concentrations below 50 microM OC. Production of infectious virus, viral p24 antigen, and virion reverse transcriptase were reduced by OC at concentrations that prevented viral cell killing. A variety of CD4+ T-cell lines were protected by OC from HIV cytopathicity, and OC inhibited two distinct strains of HIV-1. However, HIV-2 infections were unaffected by OC. OC had no direct effect on virions of HIV or on the enzymatic activities of HIV reverse transcriptase or HIV protease. Time-limited treatments of cells with OC before, during, or after exposure of cells to virus failed to protect cells from the eventual cytopathic effects of HIV, and OC failed to inhibit the production of virus from cells in which infection was established or from chronically infected cells. We conclude that the highly active OC has a reversible effect on some early stage of HIV-1 reproduction and cytopathicity. Pilot in vivo experiments showed that circulating concentrations of OC exceeding 1 microM could be achieved and sustained in hamsters for at least a week with no remarkable toxicological sequelae. OC represents a new class of anti-HIV agents that are promising candidates for drug development.\r"

Using an independent method that avoids the creation of immunoprecipitation artifacts during membrane solubilization, we have studied insulin receptor-class I product associations by determining the proximity between these class I products and the insulin receptor on intact cells with the use of fluorescence energy transfer. Significant energy transfer was seen between the insulin receptor and both murine H-2K- as well as H-2D-end products, indicating close proximity (e.g., within 10 nm). This cell-surface association is not from the relatively high class I density in that no significant energy transfer was measured between H-2K- vs. H-2D-end proteins. To extend these observations, we also tested whether class I products influence insulin-receptor binding and postbinding events as a result of their physical association. Using related cell lines positive and negative for class I expression, we found no correlation between insulin-receptor density or binding affinity with H-2 product expression. The class I-null variant, however, demonstrated an increase in insulin-mediated insulin-receptor internalization to suggest that if major histocompatibility complex class I products directly affect insulin-receptor function through specific cell-surface interactions, they may do so after ligand binding.\r"

Hematopoiesis in vivo continues unabated throughout life, suggesting that failure to obtain continuous hematopoiesis in vitro is probably due to the failure of culture conditions to accurately reproduce the in vivo state. Since bone marrow cells in vivo exist at high density and are rapidly perfused by plasma components, we examined the effects of the culture medium perfusion rate and inoculum density on longevity and productivity of human bone marrow cultures. Culture efficiency and longevity were relatively independent of the variation in inoculum density from 10(6) to 5 x 10(6) cells per ml but were significantly altered by the medium perfusion rate. Increased culture perfusion was superior to traditional Dexter schedules, with 0.5 medium volume exchange per day (3.5 volume per week) being optimal. The cultures under these conditions demonstrated an increasing rate of cell production from weeks 4 to 10, with the cell production rate doubling approximately every 2 weeks. Following weeks 10-12 in culture, the cell production rate of all cultures decayed. Production of nonadherent progenitor cells was also highest in cultures perfused at 3.5 medium volume exchanges per week, where progenitor cell production was stable from weeks 6 to 18. The nonadherent cells collected were predominantly macrophages by week 19, except for the cultures perfused at a rate of 3.5 volumes per week and seeded at 5 x 10(6) cells per ml, in which production of granulocytes remained high through week 19. Establishment of more optimal perfusion conditions supports the continuous stable generation of progenitor cells over 5 months in culture, suggesting that primitive stem cells are surviving and proliferating in these cultures.\r"

Human DNA from two human-hamster hybrid cell lines was amplified by Alu-repeat primers (Alu PCR) and the products originating from the shared human chromosomal region were cloned. To achieve this, human sequences were amplified with very similar Alu primers from the two different human-hamster hybrid cell lines. The products were then digested with an appropriate restriction enzyme (either BamHI or Sal I), combined, denatured, and reannealed. The derived heteroduplex molecules (originating from the human regions common to both cell lines) had single BamHI and Sal I cohesive ends due to the primers used, so that they could be cloned in a double-digested plasmid vector. We used this method to enrich about 10-fold for Alu PCR products from the human chromosome 19q13.2 region, resulting in a region-specific clone collection. About 90% of the recombinants with BamHI-Sal I inserts are derived from the common region. This approach allows the boundaries for the regional probe isolation to be defined by combinations of hybrids rather than single hybrid cell lines, thus permitting greater flexibility in the selection of regions for probe isolation.\r"

  ".U": "91319765\r", 
  ".W": "In preparations of synaptic terminals (synaptosomes) isolated from rat brain, the activity of phospholipase A2 (PLA2), a phospholipid hydrolase that serves a central function in signal transduction, was inhibited in a Ca(2+)-dependent manner by incubation with 60 mM K+ or with the Ca(2+)-selective ionophore ionomycin. Reversal by alkaline phosphatase treatment suggested that this inhibitory effect resulted from phosphorylation of a synaptosomal protein substrate. When lysed synaptosomes were incubated with Ca2+/calmodulin (CaM), purified Ca2+/CAM-dependent protein kinase II (Ca2+/CaM-dependent PK II) and ATP, PLA2 activity in lysates was nearly abolished within 10 min. This effect was accompanied by a marked decrease in the Vmax of the enzyme and little or no change in the Km. Furthermore, Ca2+/CaM with ATP but without exogenous Ca2+/CaM-dependent PK II partially inhibited PLA2 activity, and this effect was prevented by treating the lysates with a selective peptide inhibitor of Ca2+/CaM-dependent PK II. In contrast, incubation of intact synaptosomes with 4 beta-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate or of lysed synaptosomes with purified protein kinase C had little or no effect on PLA2 activity. The results strongly suggest that the Ca(2+)-dependent inhibition of PLA2 activity observed in intact nerve endings was produced by activation of the multifunctional Ca2+/CaM-dependent PK II. A membrane-permeable adenylyl cyclase activator, forskolin, enhanced PLA2 activity in intact synaptosomes, and cAMP-dependent protein kinase potentiated PLA2 activity in lysed synaptosomes. Furthermore, another broad-spectrum protein kinase present in synaptic terminals, casein kinase II, also potentiated PLA2 activity in lysed synaptosomes. The effects of both protein kinases were associated with a decrease in Km and no change in Vmax. The results suggest that PLA2 activity in synaptic terminals is subject to bidirectional control by distinct signal transduction pathways. Moreover, mutually antagonistic effects of the Ca2+/CaM-dependent PK II and PLA2 pathways provide a possible molecular mechanism for bidirectional modulation of neurotransmitter release.\r"

Fibrinogen and thrombomodulin bind competitively to an anion-binding exosite on thrombin. We prepared recombinant normal human thrombin and mutant thrombins with single amino acid substitutions in order to localize and distinguish the fibrinogen- and thrombomodulin-binding sites. Normal and mutant thrombins had similar amidolytic activity. Thrombin K52E had approximately 2.5-fold increased protein C-activating activity but only approximately 17% of normal fibrinogen-clotting activity. Thrombin R70E had normal fibrinogen-clotting activity but only approximately 7% of normal protein C-activating activity. Thrombin R68E had markedly reduced activity in both assays. Decreased activation of protein C correlated with decreased binding affinity for thrombomodulin, and ability to activate platelets correlated directly with fibrinogen-clotting activity. These results demonstrate that thrombins with predominantly anticoagulant or procoagulant activity can be created by mutagenesis and that thrombomodulin- and fibrinogen-binding sites on thrombin may overlap but are not identical.\r"

  ".U": "91319767\r", 
  ".W": "A protein previously purified from Drosophila embryo extracts by a DNA strand transfer assay, Rrp1 (recombination repair protein 1), has an N-terminal 427-amino acid region unrelated to known proteins, and a 252-amino acid C-terminal region with sequence homology to two DNA repair nucleases, Escherichia coli exonuclease III and Streptococcus pneumoniae exonuclease A, which are known to be active as apurinic endonucleases and as double-stranded DNA 3' exonucleases. We demonstrate here that purified Rrp1 has apurinic endonuclease and double-stranded DNA 3' exonuclease, activities and carries out single-stranded DNA renaturation in a Mg(2+)-dependent manner. Strand transfer, 3' exonuclease, and single-stranded DNA renaturation activities comigrate during column chromatography. The properties of Rrp1 suggest that it could promote homologous recombination at sites of DNA damage.\r"

  ".U": "91319768\r", 
  ".W": "The centrosome, the microtubule-organizing center of the cell, is introduced typically by the sperm at fertilization. In some mammals, however, this paternal pattern of inheritance appears to be violated. The hypothesis that the centrosome is maternally inherited was tested during parthenogenesis, polyspermy, and polygyny as well as after recovery from microtubule inhibition at first mitosis. During parthenogenesis the paternal contribution was absent, and in polyspermy the paternal contribution was multiplied. Haploid and diploid parthenogenotes as well as polyspermic and digynic fertilized eggs each segregated their centrosomes to organize a bipolar mitotic apparatus. Oocytes recovering from a nocodazole block formed two normal bipolar mitotic apparatus; the paternal chromosomes aligned at one spindle equator, while the maternal chromosomes were found at the other. These results show that the centrosome is maternally inherited from cytoplasmic sites in the mouse. The evolutionary switch from paternal to maternal inheritance in mammals might be related to the additional dangers that parthenogenesis represents: a threat to the life of the mother as well as to the life of the fetus.\r"

  ".W": "In adipocytes that have been deprived of growth hormone (GH) for at least 3 hr, GH elicits a transient insulin-like response that is followed by a period of refractoriness to further insulin-like stimulation. Exposure of adipocytes to GH in the first hour of a 3-hr incubation prevents the appearance of insulin-like sensitivity. Intracellular Ca2+ concentration [( Ca2+]i) was measured in individual adipocytes that were loaded with fura-2 hexakis(acetoxymethyl) ester after preincubation in the presence (refractory) or absence (sensitive) of recombinant human GH at 100 ng/ml. Using a dual nitrogen laser imaging microscope with computer-assisted image processing to measure fluorescence changes, we observed that resting [Ca2+]i was 220 +/- 10 nM in refractory adipocytes and 110 +/- 6 nM in sensitive adipocytes (P less than 0.001). GH had no acute effect on [Ca2+]i in sensitive adipocytes but caused a sustained 3-fold increase in [Ca2+]i in refractory cells within 3 min (P less than 0.001). Insulin did not change [Ca2+]i in either sensitive or refractory adipocytes. In refractory cells treated with insulin and GH simultaneously, insulin completely blocked the rise in [Ca2+]i due to GH. Oxytocin elicited a prompt increase in [Ca2+]i followed by a quick return to resting levels in both sensitive and refractory cells. These findings indicate that basal [Ca2+]i is increased in refractory cells and that GH produces a sustained rise in [Ca2+]i only in refractory adipocytes. We suggest that the sustained increase in [Ca2+]i produced by GH in refractory cells prevents the expression of the insulin-like response.\r"

The minimal set of peptides that would elicit antibodies to neutralize a majority of U.S. and European isolates of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 is determined with the assumption that peptides of a given length including the central Gly-Pro-Gly triad are required. In spite of the hypervariability of the PND, 90% of these 245 sequences include peptides from a set of 7 pentapeptides, 13 hexapeptides, or 17 heptapeptides. Tests of these peptide sets on 78 additional PND sequences show that 95% are covered by the 7 pentapeptides, 94% by the 13 hexapeptides, and 86% by the 17 heptapeptides. To anticipate variants not yet observed, single amino acid mutation frequencies from the 245 isolates are used to calculate an expanded set of the 10,000 most probable PND sequences. These sequences cover 86% of the total distribution expected for the central portion of the PND. Peptide lists derived from this expanded set when tested on the 78 additional sequences show that 7 pentapeptides cover 95%, 13 hexapeptides cover 94%, and 17 heptapeptides cover 94%. These results suggest that peptide cocktails of limited size with the potential to cover a large fraction of PND sequence variation may be feasible vaccine candidates.\r"

We report here that TGF-beta 1 is also the most potent chemoattractant yet described for human peripheral blood neutrophils. Recombinant TGF-beta 1 elicited dose-dependent directed migration of neutrophils under agarose that was inhibited in the presence of a neutralizing antibody to TGF-beta 1. Maximal chemotaxis was evoked by TGF-beta 1 at femtomolar concentrations, whereas conventional chemoattractants act at nanomolar concentrations: on a molar basis, TGF-beta 1 was 150,000 times more potent than fMet-Leu-Phe. In contrast, TGF-beta 1 provoked neither exocytosis nor the production of superoxide by neutrophils. We further analyzed the mechanism by which TGF-beta 1 elicits chemotaxis (GTPase activity, [Ca2+], and actin polymerization). In contrast to the conventional chemoattractant fMet-Leu-Phe, TGF-beta neither activated classic heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding proteins nor provoked global mobilization of intracellular Ca2+. Chemoattraction by both fMet-Leu-Phe and TGF-beta 1 was inhibited by cycloheximide and actinomycin D. Moreover, chemotaxis in response to TGF-beta 1 was associated with the polymerization of actin. The selectivity and potency of TGF-beta 1 as a chemoattractant suggest that it elicits directed cell migration by means of a pathway that depends not on classic intracellular signals but on protein synthesis.\r"

A significant proportion of brain cytosolic ATP in normal brain is not complexed to Mg2+, as indicated by the chemical shift delta of the beta-P resonance of ATP. The ATP beta-P resonance position in brain thus is sensitive to changes in intracellular free Mg2+ concentration and in the proportion of ATP complexed with Mg because this shift lies on the rising portion of the delta vs. Mg2+ titration curve for ATP. We have measured the ATP beta-P shift and compared intracellular free Mg2+ concentration and fractions of free ATP for normal individuals (n = 6) and a limited series of patients with brain tumors (n = 5). In four of the five spectra obtained from brain tissue containing a substantial proportion of tumor, intracellular free Mg2+ was increased, and the fraction of free ATP was decreased, compared with normal brain.\r"

This modulation is thought to play a key role in determining the differentiation of developing neurons and regulating the operation of mature neurons. Here we describe a regulation of astroglial gene expression by neuronal activity. We report that intense neuronal activity (electrically induced seizures) in rat hippocampus leads to rapid and dramatic increases in mRNA for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), an astroglia-specific intermediate filament protein. GFAP mRNA levels increased at sites of stimulation as well as in areas that were synaptically activated by the resultant seizures. When seizures were induced repetitively for many days, levels of GFAP mRNA remained chronically elevated. However, GFAP mRNA returned to control levels within a few days after the cessation of stimulation. The coupling between astroglial gene expression and neuronal activity may be a mechanism through which neuronal activity modulates the function of supporting cells that are responsible for regulating the extracellular microenvironment of the brain.\r"

This subunit is thought to have at least one of the active sites for nucleophilic attack on the phosphodiester bonds of damaged DNA. To localize the active site, mutant UvrC proteins were constructed by linker-scanning and deletion mutagenesis. In vivo studies revealed that the C-terminal 314 amino acids of the 610-amino acid UvrC protein were sufficient to confer UV resistance to cells lacking the uvrC gene. The portion of the uvrC gene encoding the C-terminal half of the protein was fused to the 3' end of the E. coli malE gene (which encodes maltose binding protein), and the fusion protein MBP-C314C was purified and characterized. The fusion protein, in combination with UvrA and UvrB subunits, reconstituted the excinuclease activity that incised the eighth phosphodiester bond 5' and the fourth phosphodiester bond 3' to a psoralen-thymine adduct. These results suggest that the C-terminal 314 amino acids of UvrC constitute a functional domain capable of interacting with the UvrB-damaged DNA complex and of inducing the two phosphodiester bond incisions characteristic of (A)BC excinuclease.\r"

The central three turns of DNA in the nucleosome have a helical periodicity of approximately 10.7 base pairs per turn, while flanking regions have a periodicity of approximately 10.0 base pairs per turn. Removal of the histone tails does not change the hydroxyl radical cleavage pattern in either mixed- or unique-sequence nucleosome samples. A tetramer of histones H3 and H4, (H3/H4)2, organizes the central 120 base pairs of DNA identically to that found in the nucleosome. Moreover, \"tailless\" octamers and the (H3/H4)2 tetramer recognize the same nucleosome positioning signals as the intact octamer.\r"

In contrast, very little binding was found with an epsilon A.A pair and none was found with an epsilon A.G pair. This suggests protein recognition of a specific structural alteration. Other defined probes with alkyl adducts did not bind. In addition, the human cell extracts and a rat liver extract were found to nick specifically at the 5' side of the epsilon A adduct, which could indicate a possible associated repair activity.\r"

  ".W": "Normal eukaryotic cells do not initiate mitosis until DNA replication has been completed. This requirement can be bypassed by exposing cells to certain chemicals. We report here that chemically induced premature mitosis is not readily achieved in all mammalian species. Although hamster cells underwent premature mitosis following treatment with caffeine, the protein phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid, and the protein kinase inhibitors 2-aminopurine and 6-dimethyl-aminopurine, the mouse and human cells examined in this study displayed little or no response to any of these compounds. Differences in cell permeability or metabolism could not account for the species specificity of these drugs, because other biochemical and mitosis-promoting activities were apparent in human cells. Cell-type specificity can be explained, however, by the timing of cyclin B synthesis and p34cdc2/cyclin B complex formation during the cell cycle. Synthesis of cyclin B and formation of a p34cdc2/cyclin B complex, both of which are required for initiation of mitosis, were prevalent in hamster cells arrested in S phase but were absent or barely detectable in arrested human cells. In hamster cells, the hyperphosphorylated form of p34cdc2 was complexed with cyclin B and underwent tyrosine dephosphorylation during caffeine-induced premature mitosis. These findings indicate that the onset of mitosis is regulated somewhat differently among mammalian cell types and that these differences affect the vulnerability of cells to drug-induced mitotic aberrations and cytogenetic damage.\r"

In AIDS, CD4 is the receptor for the human immunodeficiency virus, which binds to CD4 through envelope glycoprotein gp120. Delineation of the ligand-binding sites of CD4 is necessary for the development of immunomodulators and antiviral agents. Although the gp120 binding site has been characterized in detail, much less is known about the class II binding site, and it is as yet uncertain whether they partially or fully overlap. To investigate CD4 binding sites, a cellular adhesion assay between COS cells transiently transfected with CD4 and B lymphocytes expressing HLA class II antigens has been developed that is strictly dependent on the CD4--class II interaction, quantitative, and highly reproducible. Mutants of CD4 expressing amino acids with distinct physicochemical properties at positions Arg-54, Ala-55, Asp-56, and Ser-57 in V1, the first extracellular immunoglobulin-like domain, have been generated and studied qualitatively and quantitatively for interaction with HLA class II antigens, for membrane expression, for the integrity of CD4 epitopes recognized by a panel of monoclonal antibodies, and for gp120 binding. The results obtained show that the mutations in this tetrapeptide, which forms the core of a synthetic peptide previously shown to have immunosuppressive properties, affect the two binding functions of CD4 similarly, lending support to the hypothesis that the human immunodeficiency virus mimicks HLA class II binding to CD4.\r"

The most potent inhibition was obtained with rC.dG and dA.dT as template--primers. With rC.dG, reversible slow-binding non-competitive inhibition was observed. [3H]L-697,639 bound preferentially to enzyme-template-primer complexes. This binding was magnesium-dependent and saturable with a stoichiometry of 1 mol of [3H]L-697,639 per mol of RT heterodimer. Displacement of [3H]L-697,639 was seen with phosphonoformate. In human T-lymphoid-cell culture, L-697,639 and L-697,661 inhibited the spread of HIV-1 infection by at least 95% at concentrations of 12-200 nM. Synergism between 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine or dideoxyinosine and either of these compounds was also demonstrated in cell culture. Based upon their specificity for HIV-1 RT activity, template-primer dependence on potency and ability to displace [3H]L-697,639; a tetrahydroimidazo [4,5,1-jk] [1,4]-benzodiazepin-2(1H)-thione derivative R82150 and the dipyridodiazepinone BI-RG-587 appear to inhibit RT activity by the same mechanism as the pyridinones.\r"

  ".W": "Plasma growth hormone (GH) profiles are sexually differentiated in many species and regulate the sex-dependence of peripubescent growth rates and liver function, including steroid hydroxylase cytochrome P450 expression, by mechanisms that are poorly understood. By use of an external pump to deliver to hypophysectomized rats pulses of rat GH of varying frequency and amplitude, a critical element for liver discrimination between male and female GH patterns was identified. Liver expression of the male-specific steroid 2 alpha (or 16 alpha)-hydroxylase P450, designated CYP2C11, was stimulated by GH at both physiological and nonphysiological pulse amplitudes, durations, and frequencies, provided that an interpulse interval of no detectable GH was maintained for at least 2.5 hr. This finding suggests that hepatocytes undergo an obligatory recovery period after stimulation by a GH pulse. This period may be required to reset a GH-activated intracellular signaling pathway or may relate to the short-term absence of GH receptors at the hepatocyte surface after a cycle of GH binding and receptor internalization. These requirements were distinguished from those necessary for the stimulation by GH of normal male growth rates in hypophysectomized rats, indicating that different GH responses and, perhaps, different GH-responsive tissues recognize distinct signaling elements in the sexually dimorphic patterns of circulating GH.\r"

This method with intact yeast cells is labeled \"in vivo\" to distinguish it from methods with cell extracts, labeled \"in vitro.\" A plasmid in which the apoaequorin cDNA was joined downstream from the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene promoter was constructed and introduced into yeast cells. The intracellular concentration of apoaequorin expressed by the cDNA was approximately 1 microM, which was high enough to detect the cytosolic Ca2+. Growth of the transformed cells was normal. In the in vitro method, apoaequorin in crude cell extracts was regenerated into aequorin by mixing with coelenterazine, the substrate for the luminescence reaction, whereas in the in vivo method, aequorin was regenerated by incubating intact cells with coelenterazine. Simultaneous addition of 10 mM CaCl2 and 10 microM A23187, a Ca2+ ionophore, to coelenterazine-incorporated cells generated luminescence. Coelenterazine-incorporated cells also responded to native extracellular stimuli. A mating pheromone, alpha-factor, added to cells of mating type a or alpha, generated extracellular Ca(2+)-dependent luminescence specifically in a mating type cells, with maximal intensity occurring 45-50 min after addition of alpha-factor. Glucose added to glucose-starved G0/G1 cells stimulated an increase in extracellular Ca(2+)-dependent luminescence with maximal intensity occurring 2 min after addition. These results show the usefulness of the aequorin system in monitoring [Ca2+]i response to extracellular stimuli in yeast cells.\r"

Although amphibian blastula nuclei and other early embryonic nuclei are totipotent, to our knowledge no nucleus from an adult cell has ever been shown to be totipotent by this procedure. Transfer of Lucke renal carcinoma nuclei into enucleated eggs results in prefeeding swimming tadpoles. Inasmuch as these tadpoles die, rescue of this pluripotential tissue was attempted by grafting fragments of triploid tumor nuclear transplant tadpoles to the tails of normal diploid Rana pipiens hosts. Grafts of tumor nuclear transplant tadpole tissue were histologically indistinguishable from grafts of normally fertilized embryos and developed normal-appearing structures such as complete eyes, well-differentiated neural tissues, kidney tubules, and gut epithelium. Moreover, histological differentiation in tumor nuclear transplant grafts was comparable to that observed in 50-day-old normal larvae. Grafting enhanced the survival of tumor nuclear transplant tissue from no more than 14 days as part of the donor tadpole to 40 days at which time the grafts were harvested as healthy tissue. Thus, both differentiation and survival of tumor nuclear transplant tissue were augmented with the grafting procedure. Cytophotometric analysis of ploidy was used to confirm the tumor origin of the donor tissue.\r"

Neurons labeled intracellularly with neurobiotin or horseradish peroxidase exhibited an expansive distribution of axon collaterals in spinal cord laminae I, V, VII, VIII, IX, X, and the ventrolateral funiculi.

  ".U": "91319790\r", 
  ".W": "Polyclonal antibodies to the amino- or carboxyl-terminated peptide sequences of the GLUT4 transporter protein were used in immunoelectron microscopic studies to demonstrate the location and insulin-induced translocation of GLUT4 in intact isolated rat adipocytes. Labeling of untreated adipocytes with the amino-terminal antibody revealed 95% of GLUT4 was intracellular, associated with plasma membrane invaginations or vesicles contiguous with or within 75 nm of the cell membrane. Insulin treatment increased plasma membrane labeling approximately 13-fold, to 52% of the total transporters, and decreased intracellular labeling proportionately. In contrast, labeling of untreated adipocytes with the carboxyl-terminal antibody or with a monoclonal antibody (1F8) that binds to the carboxyl terminus of GLUT4 detected fewer transporters, only approximately 40% of which were intracellular. In insulin-treated cells, plasma membrane labeling increased approximately 20-fold, but the total number of labeled transporters also increased approximately 13-fold. The number of intracellular transporters was not changed. The insulin-induced increase in plasma membrane labeling was reversible. Thus, the vast majority of GLUT4 transporters in untreated adipocytes are intracellular in invaginations or vesicles attached or close to the plasma membrane. Insulin treatment causes translocation of transporters to the plasma membrane, which involves flow of transporters from invaginations to the cell surface and possible fusion of subplasma membrane vesicles with the plasma membrane. Differences in the labeling of intracellular transporters by peptide antibodies suggested the carboxyl-terminal epitope of intracellular transporters was masked. The unmasking of the carboxyl terminus during translocation to the plasma membrane may be part of the mechanism by which insulin stimulates glucose transport in rat adipocytes.\r"

Pneumonia unassociated with measles causes 70% of these deaths; post-measles pneumonia, 15%; pertussis, 10%; and bronchiolitis and croup syndromes, 5%. Both bacterial and viral pathogens are responsible for these deaths. The most important bacterial agents are Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Staphylococcus aureus. The data on bacterial etiology of pneumonia during the first 3 months of life are limited, and almost no information on the role of chlamydia and pertussis in this age period is available. The distribution of viral pathogens in developing countries can be summarized as follows: respiratory syncytial virus, 15%-20%; parainfluenza viruses, 7%-10%; and influenza A and B viruses and adenovirus, 2%-4%. Mixed viral and bacterial infections occur frequently. Risk factors that increase the incidence and severity of lower respiratory infection in developing countries include large family size, lateness in the birth order, crowding, low birth weight, malnutrition, vitamin A deficiency, lack of breast feeding, pollution, and young age. Effective interventions for prevention and medical case management are urgently needed to save the lives of many children predisposed to severe disease.\r"

The pathogenesis of viral bronchiolitis and pneumonia involves inoculation and early replication in the upper respiratory tract, followed by aspiration into the lower respiratory tract when both the mucosal and systemic immune systems are involved in a specific response. Both disease and recovery reflect processes of viral replication (with attendant cellular destruction) and of immune response (with attendant direct cellular destruction and release of pathogenic, along with beneficial, mediators). Factors predisposing to bacterial superinfection are poorly understood except in animal models. Conditions leading to heightened susceptibility to severe disease in the developed world are particularly common in the developing world. Increasing information on RSV and PIV infections in the developing world will likely point to their importance. Strategies for prevention of severe illnesses due to these viruses will follow from concepts elucidated through animal models and studies of infants in the developed world.\r"

Toxins secreted by the bacteria, byproducts of bacterial breakdown (e.g., pneumolysin or teichoic acid), or constituents of the intense inflammatory response in the lung might play a role in these phenomena. Malnourished children presumably carry less metabolic reserve with which they can resist the exceptional stresses of pneumococcal disease, and underlying parasitic infestation or other chronic infections, through release of potent mediators such as tumor necrosis factor or platelet-activating factor, might prime the mechanisms of host defense for a more fulminant and systemic response to infection. Vaccines that can protect infants are badly needed, and a better understanding must be gained of the mechanisms by which this pathogen continues to cause such devastating disease in the world's children and elderly.\r"

The magnitude of this problem, which contributes to many thousands-perhaps millions-of deaths each year, emphasizes the need for research on the epidemiology, pathogenesis, virulence factors, immune mechanisms, and forms of treatment relevant to ARI caused by H. influenzae in infants and implies that such studies should be given a high priority.\r"

The vaccine appears to reduce mortality by preventing bacteremia. Evidence suggests that highly invasive \"adult\" pneumococcal serotypes are comparatively more important as a cause of ALRI in developing countries where ALRI-related mortality is higher than in North America. Capsular polysaccharide vaccines are more likely to be immunogenic for these serotypes than for the \"pediatric\" serotypes. The evaluation of pneumococcal vaccines in areas where mortality is high should have the highest priority. For such trials investigators should, at minimum, define epidemiologic circumstances in terms of (1) the invasive serotypes of pneumococci, (2) the protective levels of antibody, (3) the antibody response to vaccination, and (4) the general immune status of the population.\r"

  ".W": "Haemophilus influenzae is one of the leading causes of severe bacterial infection in children of developing regions, causing 30% of the cases of culture-positive pneumonia and 20%-60% of the cases of bacterial meningitis. In infants and children, the majority of isolates from cerebrospinal fluid and blood and 16%-38% of pulmonary isolates are H. influenzae type b. The availability of several new polysaccharide-protein conjugate vaccines for the prevention of invasive disease due to H. influenzae type b prompts this review of the epidemiology of H. influenzae disease in the developing world and of the characteristics of current H. influenzae type b vaccines. To develop a strategy for use of H. influenzae type b vaccines in developing countries, the following data are needed: the age-specific attack rates of H. influenzae type b disease and the immunogenicity and efficacy of these vaccines in young infants in developing countries. Should H. influenzae type b vaccines prove to be inadequate for the prevention of H. influenzae pneumonia, the use of non-type b H. influenzae vaccines may be necessary.\r"

Hospital and community-based studies of ALRI have found that measles accounts for 6%-21% of the morbidity and 8%-93% of the mortality due to ALRI. Although live attenuated measles vaccine is one of the most effective vaccines in use today, measles has not been controlled in many parts of the world, primarily because the levels of vaccine coverage required to interrupt measles transmission have not been achieved. In addition, in some areas, a large percentage of cases of measles occur in infants who are younger than the age recommended for vaccination. Recent studies suggest that the Edmonston-Zagreb measles vaccine may be more immunogenic than other vaccine strains in young infants. A substantial proportion of ALRI could be prevented by increasing measles vaccine coverage and by the use of particular vaccine strains in younger children.\r"

Respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza and influenza viruses, and the adenoviruses are the predominant viral causes of ALRI in both developed and developing regions. In this review, the epidemiologic data from developing nations for these viral infections are summarized and the current status of viral vaccines for prevention of ALRI are described. Among the questions to be addressed before these vaccines are used in developing nations are (1) the age-specific rates of infection and disease, (2) the effect of high-dose early exposure to these viruses, and (3) the effect of malnutrition on the immunogenicity of the vaccines. Prospective family studies and other community-based approaches will be required in the acquisition of these data.\r"

Initially, full use of measles, pertussis, and diphtheria vaccines, in appropriately scheduled programs, can make an immediate contribution to the reduction of severe respiratory infection. Emerging technologies offer the promise of vaccines against bacterial and viral respiratory pathogens that are suitable for infants and children in developing countries. These technologic advances include the use of protein-polysaccharide conjugates of endemic serotypes for Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae vaccines and new approaches to the use of purified protein components or attenuated live virus with respiratory syncytial virus and paramyxovirus vaccines. Such vaccines should soon be available for evaluation in developing countries. It is timely to embark upon a program of development, evaluation, and worldwide deployment of vaccines for the control of ALRI.\r"

The magnesium adenosine triphosphate (MgATP) binding site was located by difference Fourier synthesis. The enzyme structure is bilobal with a deep cleft between the lobes. The cleft is filled by MgATP and a portion of the inhibitor peptide. The smaller lobe, consisting mostly of amino-terminal sequence, is associated with nucleotide binding, and its largely antiparallel beta sheet architecture constitutes an unusual nucleotide binding motif. The larger lobe is dominated by helical structure with a single beta sheet at the domain interface. This lobe is primarily involved in peptide binding and catalysis. Residues 40 through 280 constitute a conserved catalytic core that is shared by more than 100 protein kinases. Most of the invariant amino acids in this conserved catalytic core are clustered at the sites of nucleotide binding and catalysis.\r"

The peptide inhibitor, derived from a naturally occurring heat-stable protein kinase inhibitor, contains an amphipathic helix that is followed by a turn and an extended conformation. The extended region occupies the cleft between the two lobes of the enzyme and contains a five-residue consensus recognition sequence common to all substrates and peptide inhibitors of the catalytic subunit. The helical portion of the peptide binds to a hydrophobic groove and conveys high affinity binding. Loops from both domains converge at the active site and contribute to a network of conserved residues at the sites of magnesium adenosine triphosphate binding and catalysis. Amino acids associated with peptide recognition, nonconserved, extend over a large surface area.\r"

The two copper atoms in the monomer comprise one type I copper site (Cu-I; two His, one Cys, and one Met ligands) and one putative type II copper site (Cu-II; three His and one solvent ligands). Although ligated by adjacent amino acids Cu-I and Cu-II are approximately 12.5 A apart. Cu-II is bound with nearly perfect tetrahedral geometry by residues not within a single monomer, but from each of two monomers of the trimer.
