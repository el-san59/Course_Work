The importance of the laser is related to its small size and its flexibility. This will permit simpler access to the stone employing instruments such as small-caliber rigid ureteroscopes and small steerable flexible instruments. If these instruments can be passed without ureteral dilatation, access to the stone will be safer, and they may well extend the range of stones regularly susceptible to ureteroscopic removal.\r"

Ureteroscopic manipulation, percutaneous antegrade manipulation, and open ureterolithotomy are secondary choices. The treatment of calculi in the lower ureter--that segment between the upper border of the iliac crest and the ureterovesical junction--is somewhat controversial. Most urologists favor ureteroscopic manipulation: small stones can be extracted, while larger stones can be fragmented with ultrasonic, electrohydraulic, or even laser lithotripsy. However, manipulation in the presacral ureter is more difficult than in the juxtavesicular ureter, and all stones are not amenable to ureteroscopic management. Our experience at the University of Virginia led us to use ESWL for lower ureteral stones when ureteroscopic manipulation fails or cannot safely be accomplished or when patients refuse cystoscopy. Juxtavesicular stones are treated with a minor modification (sitting position) of standard supine ESWL, whereas presacral stones are treated with prone ESWL.\r"

For urologists with expertise in endoscopic instrumentation and technique, it is easy to learn and does not require the presence of a skilled interventional radiologist. The advantages of the technique are that it can be performed in a non-dilated collecting system and can result in more accurate and less traumatic puncture. We have found it difficult to use in the presence of staghorn calculi filling the kidney, and its application is obviously limited if access to the lower urinary tract and ureter cannot be obtained. If the technique is unsuccessful, it does not preclude or complicate immediate antegrade percutaneous or open stone removal.\r"

This is probably the most important advantage of the ureteroscopic approach to these tumors. Ureteroscopy is safe and reliable and allows examination of about 95 per cent of all patients evaluated. Success rates will continue to improve with the expanded use of flexible instruments. Ureteroscopy may also be used for treatment. However, before this mode of therapy can be accepted, further work must be done comparing the findings of the endoscopic biopsy with the pathologic stage of the cancer. Nevertheless, it does appear that low-grade localized distal ureteral tumors can be managed effectively by ureteroscopic means. Possibly low-grade tumors in the renal pelvis can also be managed by this method (see also following article). Again, methods of surveillance such as radiographic studies and urinary cytology must be used in addition to endoscopic examination for follow-up (Table 2). Extensive pyelocaliceal tumors, high-grade pelvic tumors, and high-grade ureteral tumors probably cannot be managed effectively by ureteroscopic means. Either polychronotropism or failure to control a primary tumor may prove an indication for adjuvant topical therapy. Potential side effects such as systemic absorption resulting in myelosuppression need to be considered. However, if standard dosages known to be relatively safe intravesically are employed, there should be no significant problems.\r"

Our results suggest that percutaneous operations can provide cure in selected patients, including those with a normal contralateral kidney and with small (no more than 2-cm), single, low-grade, papillary tumors that are confined to the mucosa who, in addition, have negative cytology, negative random biopsies of contiguous mucosa, and no history of or concurrent transitional cell carcinoma elsewhere in the urinary tract. Further, our results suggest that second-look procedures with resection of suspicious residual disease, Nd:YAG laser irradiation of the tumor bed, and intracavitary administration of BCG all appear to help prevent recurrences.\r"

Currently, because of its less-invasive nature, lack of external catheters, and rapid convalescence, we are continuing to use a ureteroscopic approach to endopyelotomy. However, although this method overall represents a less-invasive approach, the reader is cautioned to keep in mind that our patient series is too small and the follow-up is too brief for any conclusions to yet be drawn in favor of this method.\r"

The documented advantages for specific stone burdens and patient types should not be taken as an endorsement for pretreatment stenting on a routine basis. Universal stenting is a costly adjunct to an already costly technology, not to mention the substantial number of patients with stents who report bladder or renal discomfort that is relieved when the stents are removed. Certainly, in some cases, the constant discomfort of bladder irritability and reflex voiding secondary to polymer stents may be more incapacitating than mild colic associated with fragment passage. Complications of internal ureteral stents do occur, so judicious selection of patients for pre-ESWL stenting is advised.\r"

  ".W": "Flexible fiberoptic technology was first applied to cystoscopy in 1973, with greatly increased usage since 1982. Most procedures formerly performed with rigid cystoscopes can be done using flexible cystoscopes with minimal or no anesthesia. Patient positioning and precystocopy preparation and draping are simplified with the flexible fiberoptic instruments. Complete examination of the urethra and bladder can be performed with a single-lens system and with the patient in a variety of positions. Fiberoptic cystoscopy is limited in patients who are bleeding or have blood clots in their bladders. Withdrawal of irrigant or bladder drainage is cumbersome, and the fiberoptic image is currently not of the same caliber as that of the rigid-lens systems. Fiberoptic cystoscopy has become the procedure of choice for many urologists for ureteral stenting prior to extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy. With the advent of lithotripters that require no anesthesia, this application is likely to broaden. Future applications of flexible cystoscopy may include a flexible videocystoscope for use in diagnostic and therapeutic procedures.\r"

For example, fiberoptic telescopes and light cables must never be autoclaved; ethylene oxide is the method of choice. Disinfectant is an alternative. Loops, sheaths, high-frequency cables, resectoscopes, and working elements should be sterilized by ethylene oxide. Loops and high-frequency cables should not be soaked in a disinfectant, but other instruments may be soaked. All instruments should be dried before sterilization. Too much emphasis cannot be placed on the importance of proper storage of these very fragile fiberoptic instruments. With proper care and sterilization, these instruments will need fewer repairs and function properly for a longer time.\r"

To avoid overtreating and yet remain confident of providing the best possible care, it is important to recognize that urinary tract infections are a spectrum of diseases with different etiologies and different diagnostic and therapeutic requirements. In the vast majority of cases, the urologist's responsibility is to avoid unnecessary treatment, to educate the patient on her condition, and to provide treatment with a first-line, established antimicrobial. The excretory urogram is indicated when the patient presents with symptoms of upper tract infection or asymptomatic hematuria. Urodynamic studies are useful for the patient with an abnormal voiding pattern or suspicion of neurogenic bladder. Cystoscopy has a place only when there is suspicion of bladder tumor. The voiding cystourethrogram is the most useful study for patients with urinary tract infection when there is suspicion of urethral diverticula. Studies are not recommended during a period of acute infection. Procedures that manipulate the urethra are contraindicated.\r"

High urinary concentration is the third goal of therapy and a major criterion for selecting an appropriate drug.

A cephalosporin is administered for seven days with reculture twenty-four hours after completion of therapy. If the urine proves to be sterile, a bedtime regimen is initiated of nitrofurantoin macrocrystals, 100 mg. The objective is to target the bladder with a potent bactericidal agent that will not create resistant bacterial strains or have side effects. After two weeks, dosage is reduced to every other night for two to four weeks. If the patient continues to have recurrences, short-course self-medication is indicated. In addition to the patient with recurrent infections, other problem patients include the patient with nosocomial infection, immunocompromised patients, infants and preschool children, and the elderly.\r"

All 3 agents improved cardiac function in the presence of a developing infarct. Dopamine and dobutamine increased myocardial contractility (left ventricular dP/dt and left ventricular dP/dt/P), which would be expected to increase oxygen consumption and thus further compromise the ischemic myocardium. Dopexamine hydrochloride, however, improved cardiac function mainly by reducing afterload. The infusion of dopamine and dobutamine resulted in a high (100%) incidence of ventricular arrhythmias compared with only 63% with dopexamine hydrochloride. The effects of these agents on early ischemic arrhythmias after coronary artery ligation in anesthetized rats were also studied. Dopexamine hydrochloride reduced the incidence and severity of arrhythmias in the early stages of ischemia: At a dose of 0.25 micrograms/kg/min, the total number of ectopic beats was reduced to 375 +/- 175, from 1,250 +/- 330 in control rats (p less than 0.05).

  ".W": "Systemic blood flow distribution was determined using radionuclide-labeled microspheres in anesthetized dogs during infusions of dopexamine hydrochloride or dobutamine. Three doses of the drugs were administered intravenously, in the form of 22-minute infusions (3 X 10(-9), 10(-8), 3 X 10(-8) mol/kg/min [1.3 to 12.9 micrograms/kg/min] dopexamine hydrochloride and 10(-8), 3 X 10(-8), 10(-7) mol/kg/min [3.4 to 34.0 micrograms/kg/min] dobutamine). Both drugs induced dose-dependent acceleration of the heart rate. Blood pressure was maintained during infusions of dobutamine, while dopexamine hydrochloride induced arterial hypotension. As a result, the increments in heart rate-blood pressure product were smaller with dopexamine hydrochloride than with dobutamine. Dopexamine hydrochloride induced blood flow increments in the heart, several sections of the gastrointestinal tract, kidney and skeletal muscle. Quantitatively, these changes were different from those induced by dobutamine in only 3 organs. The myocardial blood flow increments during infusions of dopexamine hydrochloride were smaller than those of dobutamine, whereas in the stomach and in skeletal muscle, the flow increments induced by dopexamine hydrochloride were significantly greater than those induced by dobutamine. The findings suggest that dopexamine hydrochloride, by virtue of its agonist activity at beta 2-adrenergic and DA1- and DA2-dopaminergic receptors, is a powerful vasodilator.\r"

  ".W": "Studies in our laboratory have confirmed that dopexamine hydrochloride is a potent beta 2-adrenoceptor and DA1-dopamine receptor agonist. We examined the effects of dopexamine hydrochloride on both cardiac contractile force, determined by use of a Walton-Brodie strain-gauge arch sutured to the right ventricle, and heart rate in anesthetized dogs. Dopexamine hydrochloride increased cardiac contractile force and heart rate and decreased blood pressure. After administration of the ganglionic blocking agents, hexamethonium and atropine, or the selective beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonist, atenolol, the positive inotropic and chronotropic effects of dopexamine hydrochloride were reduced or eliminated, demonstrating that the drug had little or no direct beta 1-adrenoceptor action and that a myocardial beta 2-adrenoceptor action was not involved in its cardiac effects. During these investigations, dopexamine hydrochloride was found to be an inhibitor of norepinephrine uptake, potentiating the cardiac effects of both exogenously administered norepinephrine and norepinephrine released from sympathetic nerves. These results led to the following conclusions: Dopexamine hydrochloride stimulates the heart by 2 mechanisms--(1) baroreceptor-mediated release of norepinephrine resulting from hypotension produced by beta 2 adrenoceptor and DA1 dopamine receptor-mediated vasodilatation, and (2) potentiation of the released norepinephrine due to prevention of norepinephrine uptake by sympathetic nerves. The latter mechanism may be involved in the cardiac stimulation observed in patients with congestive heart failure and shock, since excessive sympathetic activity and elevated catecholamine levels are present in these conditions.\r"

  ".U": "88307265\r", 
  ".W": "In patients with severe congestive heart failure, it has been suggested that since myocardial beta 1 adrenoceptors are selectively down-regulated, activation of beta 2 receptors may be a preferable approach to augmenting contractility. Accordingly, dopexamine hydrochloride (1, 2 and 4 micrograms/kg/min) and dopamine (2 and 4 micrograms/kg/min) were administered to 8 patients with dilated cardiomyopathy. Left ventricular (LV) dimensions, thicknesses and pressures were obtained using simultaneous high-fidelity pressure measurements and echocardiographic recordings. LV contractility was assessed using the load-independent relation between LV end-systolic wall stress and rate-corrected velocity of fiber shortening. Cardiac index increased in a dose-related manner with both drugs, and was accompanied by a decline in systemic vascular resistance, a measure of peripheral arteriolar tone. LV end-diastolic pressure was unaltered except for a decrease from 29 +/- 6 to 19 +/- 5 mm Hg (p less than 0.017) at the highest dose of dopexamine hydrochloride. Heart rate was unchanged during the infusion of dopamine but increased significantly with dopexamine hydrochloride. LV end-systolic wall stress, a measure of LV internal load, decreased with both drugs. With dopamine, a dose-dependent positive inotropic effect was observed. Dopexamine hydrochloride, at the 4 micrograms/kg/min infusion dose, exerted a mild positive inotropic effect comparable to that noted with dopamine at 2 micrograms/kg/min. Thus, dopamine and dopexamine hydrochloride improved overall LV performance. With dopamine, a substantial positive inotropic effect occurred in association with a reduction in LV afterload. The increased cardiac index observed with dopexamine hydrochloride was due primarily to peripheral vasodilatation and a positive chronotropic effect.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Dopexamine hydrochloride is a new intravenous, short-acting agent with agonist activity at beta 2-adrenergic and DA1-dopaminergic receptors. The effects of dopexamine hydrochloride infusion on systemic and coronary hemodynamics, myocardial metabolism and the neuroendocrine system were evaluated in 10 patients with chronic severe congestive heart failure at baseline, at rates of 1, 2, 4 and 6 micrograms/kg/min at 15-minute intervals, and after a 1-hour infusion of the \"optimal\" dose. Right atrial pressure was reduced by 25% (p less than 0.01), pulmonary capillary wedge pressure by 26% (p less than 0.05), systemic vascular resistance by 44% (p less than 0.001) and pulmonary vascular resistance by 34% (p less than 0.01) after the optimal dose. Heart rate increased by 17% (p less than 0.01), rate-pressure product by 17% (p less than 0.01) and stroke volume index by 31% (p less than 0.001). There was no change in mean arterial pressure, myocardial oxygen consumption, coronary sinus blood flow, myocardial oxygen extraction or norepinephrine balance. None of the patients demonstrated net myocardial lactate production. These findings suggest that dopexamine hydrochloride improves systemic hemodynamics and cardiac performance without adversely affecting myocardial energetics or norepinephrine balance. Thus, dopexamine hydrochloride may be a useful agent for the short-term treatment of congestive heart failure.\r"

  ".W": "Dopexamine hydrochloride is a novel beta 2- and dopaminergic-receptor agonist proposed for intravenous therapy in patients with congestive heart failure. To gain a clearer knowledge of its efficacy relative to other agents, intravenous infusions of dopexamine hydrochloride (4 micrograms/kg/min) and dobutamine (10 micrograms/kg/min) were administered to 10 patients with congestive heart failure (ejection fraction less than 0.4). Both agents increased stroke volume and cardiac indexes to a similar degree, and both decreased systemic vascular resistance, with a trend toward a greater decrease with dopexamine hydrochloride. Although dobutamine had no significant effect on left ventricular systolic pressure, dopexamine hydrochloride caused a decrease from 121 +/- 8 to 110 +/- 7 mm Hg (p less than 0.01). Both dobutamine and dopexamine hydrochloride increased peak rate of left ventricular pressure development (dP/dt), and there was a trend to a greater increase with dobutamine (control 1,043 +/- 102 mm Hg/s; dobutamine 1,340 +/- 142 mm Hg/s; dopexamine hydrochloride 1,213 +/- 120 mm Hg/s, p = 0.067 vs dobutamine). Plasma norepinephrine levels increased only with dopexamine hydrochloride (+49%, p less than 0.05). Plasma renin activity increased with both agents (dobutamine +38%, p less than 0.06; dopexamine hydrochloride +41%, p less than 0.05). Dobutamine and dopexamine hydrochloride, therefore, improve cardiac function by way of both vasodilator and inotropic mechanisms. At the doses administered, dopexamine hydrochloride relies on a greater systemic vasodilator effect than dobutamine to achieve and increase in left ventricular performance. Increased levels of endogenous catecholamines may contribute to the increased inotropic state with dopexamine hydrochloride.\r"

Thus, dopexamine hydrochloride has beneficial short-term hemodynamic effects in patients with low-output left ventricular heart failure and the benefit appears to diminish with long-term infusion.\r"

Both drugs increased cardiac output and decreased systemic vascular resistance. Dopexamine hydrochloride appeared to increase heart rate more than dopamine although this did not reach statistical significance. Dopexamine hydrochloride produced small increases in systolic and decreases in diastolic blood pressure, whereas dopamine had a biphasic effect resulting in a decrease in mean blood pressure at low doses and an increase at the highest dose studied. With increasing dosage, there was a trend toward more vasodilator activity with dopexamine hydrochloride than with dopamine. Dopexamine hydrochloride produced fewer adverse effects than dopamine.\r"

  ".W": "Dopexamine hydrochloride, a new dopaminergic derivative with potent beta 2-agonist activity, was administered to 10 patients with severe congestive heart failure. Initially, the drug was infused at increasing dosage to achieve a maximal tolerated dose and then titrated to maintain acceptable clinical parameters over the next 48 to 72 hours. Cardiac index increased significantly during the initial titration and at peak effect. Tolerance over the duration of the study was noted in most patients, although further increases in cardiac index could usually be achieved by modest increases in the infusion rate. The peak hemodynamic effect was noted at an average infusion rate of 4.8 micrograms/kg/min. Both stroke volume and stroke work indexes increased during dopexamine hydrochloride infusion in association with decreases in mean arterial, right atrial, mean pulmonary artery and pulmonary capillary wedge pressures, systemic vascular resistance and pulmonary arteriolar resistance. Cardiac output increased by 60% during the infusion and this was out of proportion to the 12% increase in heart rate at peak effect. Most of the increase in cardiac index appeared to be due to the strong vasodilatory profile of the medication producing afterload reduction, with direct inotropic and chronotropic effects contributing to a lesser degree. Drug-related side effects occurred in 4 patients and were easily controlled by down-titration. Dopexamine hydrochloride is an effective and well-tolerated sympathomimetic agent that increases cardiac index while promoting vasodilatation.\r"

These studies have thoroughly documented the mechanisms of this arrhythmia and its associated atrioventricular conduction abnormalities, but little is known about the spontaneous clinical behavior of this arrhythmia. A group of 34 patients with paroxysmal atrial tachycardia were studied using telephone transmission of the electrocardiogram to document recurrent tachycardia. When antiarrhythmic therapy was withdrawn, median time to the first recurrence of tachycardia was 19 days, mean heart rate during spontaneous tachycardia was 203.5 +/- 34.9 beats/min, and the median duration of an attack was 20 minutes. In a group of patients who were followed while many consecutive attacks were documented, the time intervals between attacks were found to be uncorrelated and to fit an exponential probability distribution (i.e., the occurrence of paroxysmal atrial tachycardia behaved like a Poisson process). Paroxysmal atrial tachycardia does not occur in a chaotic and unpredictable fashion; it is an event that occurs according to common probability models.\r"

Moderate protein restriction led to a decrease of approximately 50% in the albumin excretion rate in patients with overt proteinuria or microalbuminuria. This decrease occurred in some patients without a decrease in glomerular filtration rate, renal plasma flow, or plasma albumin concentration and may reflect subtle changes in filtration properties or permeability of glomeruli. In this pilot study moderate protein restriction has marked effects on albumin excretion irrespective of the initial degree of renal impairment. It is therefore suitable for longer-term study of its effects on the progression of renal disease in both patients with overt and incipient diabetic nephropathy.\r"

We found that guar in a dose-related fashion increased the weight of chyme collected at midintestine, markedly reduced the percent of triolein absorbed by midintestine from 88 to 38%, and profoundly increased the passage to midintestine of large, poorly digestible pieces of steak and liver. The viscosity of the guar promoted the GI transit of large, poorly digestible pieces of food but also reduced absorption by other mechanisms.\r"

Both solubility and monomeric composition of the fiber differed widely. Fiber from husk was only 0.5% soluble and nearly completely resistant to fermentation whereas fiber from bran (38% soluble) and white flour (24% soluble) was more fermentable (62% and 55% of the intake, respectively). Fiber from commercial bran (37% soluble) was most extensively fermented; only 19% of the fiber could be detected in feces. The fecal dry weight with the husk in the diet was significantly (p less than 0.001) higher than that for the other preparations. Most of the fecal dry weight increment for husk (approximately 95%) could be accounted for as fiber whereas only 45-65% of the increment was undergraded fiber for the other preparations. An additional 20-30% could be explained by protein and approximately 15% by fat with these preparations.\r"

All groups except corneal xerosis showed satisfactory weight-height ratios. Initial serum retinol values were less than 0.35 mumol/L in 34% of all children. After oral administration of 24.4 mumol vitamin A, mean serum retinol values rose from 0.42 to 0.70 mumol/L at 10 d. After oral treatment of children with 244 or 314 mumol vitamin A, mean serum retinol remained greater than 0.56 mumol/L for 165 d. Of particular note were the low mean initial serum alpha-tocopherol concentrations (6.3 mumol/L) and alpha-tocopherol-total lipid ratios (1.5 mumol/g). Total serum lipids fell in the normal range. Oral administration of 84 mumol vitamin E raised serum alpha-tocopherol and alpha-tocopherol-total-lipid ratios by 46 and 44%, respectively. Thus, vitamin E inadequacy, which impairs vitamin A absorption and storage, may well contribute to the high incidence of clinical vitamin A deficiency in West Javan children.\r"

To obtain a more direct estimate of vitamin B-6 pools, muscle biopsies from five female and seven male adults were analyzed by cation-exchange chromatography. Total muscle mass was estimated from creatinine excretion and the assumption that muscle is 40% of the body weight. The total muscle vitamin B-6 pool was estimated to be 917 +/- 319 mumol in the females and 850 +/- 216 mumol in the males. Because muscle accounts for approximately 80% of the vitamin B-6 in the body, the total body pool of vitamin B-6 in adult humans is probably approximately 1000 mumol.\r"

These values are relatively low compared with the activity in human serum (5.26 +/- 2.92 nmol.min-1.mL-1 serum and 95.6 +/- 53.1 pmol.min-1.mg-1 protein; n = 246). Biotinidase activities of milk obtained at various times after birth were not significantly different. However, biotinidase activity in colostrum was about five times higher than that of mature milk. The existence of biotinidase activity in all specimens suggests that this enzyme plays an important nutritional role during infancy.\r"

The extent of increase and the pattern of plasma beta-carotene levels showed substantial interindividual variation. Absorption of beta-carotene was affected by dietary fat concentration. Individuals placed on a high-fat diet showed significant increases in plasma beta-carotene as compared with those placed on a low-fat diet. Pharmacological doses of beta-carotene (45 and 90 mg) were used in intermittent schedules (5-6 d intervals) without altering the steady state of beta-carotene plasma levels. Yellowing of the skin occasionally occurred during daily dosing with 45 mg beta-carotene without evidence of toxicity. The observed individual variation in bioavailability of beta-carotene raises questions regarding clinical use of this micronutrient. It appears that determination of target plasma beta-carotene concentrations is essential for effective use of this compound in prevention or treatment.\r"

This is the first reported study of relationships between Se and Se-GSHPx in human liver and muscle tissue and platelet Se-GSHPx after Se supplementation.

The intervention has been effective from the growing season 1985 and it has affected practically all domestic agricultural products. From 1984 to 1986 the mean Se concentration of different foods increased. The mean Se intake of the population, calculated on the basis of food consumption statistics and from the data of urinary Se excretion, as well as the average serum Se concentration of both urban and rural people increased also during the same period. Enrichment of fertilizers with sodium selenate seems an efficient and predictable way of increasing the Se concentration of foods and the Se intake of people in low-Se areas.\r"

Twelve subjects were given a meal containing 100 g beef labeled either intrinsically or extrinsically with 65ZnCl2. Gamma-ray emissions, as determined by whole-body counting, were used to calculate Zn absorption. Absorption values were 20.9 +/- 5.5% from the extrinsic meal and 26.4 +/- 10.6% from the intrinsic meal, a difference that was not statistically significant (p greater than 0.05). Zn absorption was thus much less than the 40% assumed in establishing the 1980 Recommended Dietary Allowance for Zn. These results also indicate that extrinsic labels of Zn are valid markers of zinc absorption in beef.\r"

Children aged 7-9 y with stunted growth showed a significantly higher percentage of carious teeth than did well-nourished children of the same age (40 and 29%, respectively; p less than 0.005).

Traumatically brain-injured patients were selected because they were a relatively homogeneous, previously healthy group with a condition whose severity was readily quantifiable. In 66 such patients, the relationships between changes in thyroid function tests (thyroxine, free thyroxine, triiodothyronine, reverse triiodothyronine, and thyrotropin levels), catecholamine and cortisol concentrations measured on admission and again four days after the accident, and neurologic function assessed by the Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) were studied. Triiodothyronine and thyroxine levels fell significantly within 24 hours of injury. Four days after the accident, patients with the greatest neurologic dysfunction had the lowest triiodothyronine and thyroxine levels; significant correlations were present between the Day 4 GCS and concomitant thyroxine (r = 0.47, p less than 0.0001), free thyroxine (r = 0.32, p less than 0.02), and triiodothyronine (r = 0.50, p less than 0.0001) levels. Reverse triiodothyronine values remained unchanged throughout the study even in the most severely affected patients; the rise in thyrotropin levels was not significant (1.2 +/- 0.2 to 1.7 +/- 0.3 microU/ml, p = NS). Patients who died or remained vegetative had thyroxine and triiodothyronine levels 30 percent to 50 percent lower than those who had a good recovery (p less than 0.05). Highly significant correlations were present between Day 4 thyroxine and triiodothyronine levels and admission and Day 4 norepinephrine and epinephrine concentrations. There was no association between admission or concomitant cortisol levels and thyroid function on Day 4; treatment with high-dose dexamethasone did not influence these indexes. Thus, patients with traumatic brain injury exhibit a gradient of thyroid dysfunction that occurs promptly, is dependent upon the degree of neurologic impairment, and reflects ultimate outcome. The significant association with catecholamine levels suggests a role for sympathetic nervous system activation in its causation, independent of a generalized stress response, since there is no correlation of thyroid test abnormality with the degree of adrenocortical secretion.\r"

  ".W": "The incidence and the clinical implications of hypocalcemia were evaluated in acutely ill patients admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit of the Detroit Receiving Hospital. Total and ionized calcium levels were prospectively evaluated upon admission for all patients over a three-month interval. A high proportion of patients (62 of 88, 70 percent) were found to have decreased levels of both total and ionized calcium. Known causes of hypocalcemia could be identified in only 28 patients (45 percent). These included hypomagnesemia (17, 28 percent), renal insufficiency (five, 8 percent), alkalosis (four, 6 percent), and acute pancreatitis (two, 3 percent). In the remaining 34 patients (55 percent), no readily identifiable cause could be found. These 34 patients had a lower mean albumin level than did the 23 normocalcemic patients (p less than 0.01), but there were no differences in age, pH, serum creatinine, magnesium, or phosphate between the two groups. Serum albumin correlated directly with ionized calcium levels (n = 82, r = 0.33, p less than 0.01), as well as with total calcium levels (n = 76, r = 0.70, p less than 0.01). There was a strong association between sepsis and hypocalcemia. Patients who survived the hospitalization had higher mean ionized calcium, total calcium, and albumin values than did nonsurvivors, but there were no differences in age, serum creatinine, magnesium, and phosphate between the two groups. The mortality of the hypocalcemic patients (44 percent) was significantly greater (p less than 0.05) than the mortality of the normocalcemic patients (17 percent). These findings suggest that hypocalcemia is a very common abnormality in acutely ill patients and is associated with a poor prognosis.\r"

Cytomegalovirus has been implicated as an etiologic factor in this syndrome. Consecutive cases of disseminated cytomegalovirus disease and viremia were reviewed for evidence of cholestasis. In 12 of 36 (33 percent) patients with cytomegalovirus infection (gastrointestinal disease [eight of 16 patients] or retinitis [four of 20 patients]), cholestatic liver enzyme abnormalities developed within three months of the diagnosis of cytomegalovirus disease. Radiologic imaging demonstrated biliary dilation in three of nine (33 percent) patients studied. Review of serial liver function tests showed no effect of ganciclovir therapy on the course of cholestatic abnormalities. AIDS patients without CMV end-organ disease were also reviewed for evidence of cholestasis. Six of 15 AIDS patients with positive blood culture results for cytomegalovirus had cholestatic liver enzyme abnormalities compared with four of 36 AIDS patients with negative viral blood culture results (p = 0.023, Fisher's exact test). Patients with cytomegalovirus retinitis, gastrointestinal disease, or viremia appear to be at increased risk for the development of cholestasis. In 3 to 11 percent of patients with cytomegalovirus retinitis or gastrointestinal disease, PS/SC may develop. This clinical association supports an etiologic role for cytomegalovirus in the PS/SC syndrome.\r"

Fungal pneumonias were diagnosed as proven or probable using defined pathologic, microbiologic, radiologic, and clinical criteria. Sixteen patients died without a complete remission; of these, all 11 who underwent autopsy were found to have invasive fungal pneumonia. The 24 patients who achieved a complete remission received one to nine (median, four) additional courses of intensive chemotherapy for remission consolidation and/or relapse, and experienced 132 episodes of severe granulocytopenia. Seven patients never had a pulmonary infection despite 34 granulocytopenic episodes. However, fungal pneumonia complicated 32 (33 percent) of 98 granulocytopenic episodes in the other 17 patients. Fifteen of the patients who achieved a complete remission had at least one episode of fungal pneumonia; 12 received further chemotherapy, and nine (75 percent) of these had a subsequent fungal pneumonia. In all, 17 (52 percent) of 33 subsequent granulocytopenic episodes experienced by patients with a prior fungal pneumonia were complicated by another fungal pneumonia. All four patients with a probable fungal pneumonia diagnosed antemortem who subsequently underwent autopsy were found to have invasive fungal disease. It would appear that patients with ANLL who have had one episode of fungal pneumonia are at high risk for recurrence during subsequent episodes of granulocytopenia. Empiric or even prophylactic amphotericin B therapy may be warranted for such patients.\r"

  ".W": "Headache and dizziness are early symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning, occurring at carboxyhemoglobin levels of greater than 10 percent. Previously, it was shown that among patients presenting to an emergency department during the winter with headache or dizziness, an algorithm for obtaining carboxyhemoglobin levels on patients who used gas stoves for heating purposes or who had similarly affected cohabitants correctly identified all patients with carboxyhemoglobin levels greater than 10 percent. To test the validity of this retrospectively derived rule, 65 patients were studied who were unaware of any carbon monoxide exposure and who presented during the winter of 1986-1987 with headache or dizziness. The algorithm correctly identified three of four patients with carboxyhemoglobin levels greater than 10 percent (sensitivity = 75 percent) and correctly excluded 45 of 61 patients with lower levels (specificity = 74 percent). The presence of symptomatic cohabitants alone was an equally sensitive (75 percent) but more specific (90 percent) marker for elevated carboxyhemoglobin levels. When data from the two cohorts were combined, stepwise multiple regression identified number of cigarettes smoked daily (F = 8.66) and concurrently symptomatic cohabitants (F = 34.71) as significant predictors of the carboxyhemoglobin level. It is concluded that a retrospectively derived rule correctly identified most cases of occult carbon monoxide poisoning when applied prospectively, and that the presence of similarly affected cohabitants was the most reliable marker for a carbon monoxide-mediated illness.\r"

The significance of the occurrence of FDH in hyperlipidemic subjects with hypothyroidism has been discussed, especially in regard to the longer time interval that may be needed to achieve an amelioration of the hypothyroid state during treatment with a normal maintenance dose of thyroxine.

But society's expectations, the resources and methodologies for such monitoring, and the practices of the pharmacologic community have all evolved rapidly over the past decade. This report describes an extensive program of scientific epidemiologic monitoring of the safety of acyclovir during the first five years following approval. The presentation highlights the emerging field of pharmacoepidemiology, describes new and important resources and approaches for investigators concerned about drug safety monitoring, and presents safety data from the first five years of monitoring. The data thus far provide no reason for new safety concerns regarding this important antiviral; however, it is cautioned that, as in all such areas of public health protection, continued vigilance is needed.\r"

An essential component of this research is the establishment of a baseline expectation of pregnancy outcomes among women with herpes not receiving acyclovir. Continuing studies will be described in this report. To supplement these structured studies, an international case registration study was established. Through the Acyclovir in Pregnancy Registry, all cases of reported prenatal exposures to acyclovir are tracked to ascertain maternal exposure, risk factor, and pregnancy outcome information. The reports originate in all countries where oral acyclovir is marketed; data consolidation and analysis are coordinated at Burroughs Wellcome Co. with the assistance of a government/industry advisory panel. This presentation summarizes provisional data from the prospective reports, including trimester of exposure and reported outcomes of pregnancy. The total number of monitored pregnancies remains too small to support conclusions about the safety of acyclovir during pregnancy at this point. The potential for the registry and other epidemiologic studies to address the safety-in-pregnancy question will be discussed.\r"

The first step in management is accurate diagnosis by virus culture or antigen recognition. General management involves explaining the natural history to the patient, giving advice on sexual behavior, contact tracing, and hygiene. Oral or intravenous acyclovir provides the most useful therapy for first attacks. Acyclovir cream has a similar effect with external lesions in mild attacks. A course of acyclovir, however, has no effect on subsequent recurrence. Recurrent attacks, being brief compared with first attacks, are less influenced by acyclovir therapy, which should be given early for maximal effect. Oral and intravenous therapy are effective in the treatment of genital and anal herpes simplex infection in patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome. When oral therapy is used, doses may need to be increased. Acyclovir therapy is a valuable development compared with previously available antivirals for genital herpes simplex infection.\r"

Young adults with a recurrent HSV II infection of the hand account for the majority of cases. A prodromal phase of up to 72 hours and a recurrence of seven to 10 days' duration occasionally associated with lymphangitis, lymphadenopathy, and lymphedema are characteristic. HSV I infection of the hand classically occurs in children with herpetic stomatitis and in health care workers infected during patient care delivery. In health care workers, the infection may last 21 to 28 days and be associated with severe pain and lymphangitis. Recurrences appear uncommon in HSV I infections. Primary infection is usually managed conservatively. Vesicle drainage for pain relief and antiviral therapy with acyclovir may be of value. For recurrent infections, acyclovir, 800 mg orally, twice daily, initiated during the prodrome in an open study of eight patients appeared effective in aborting the attack. Evaluation of long-term suppression in recurrent HSV infection of the hand is in progress.\r"

  ".W": "Neuropeptide Y (NPY) is a 36-amino-acid polypeptide which coexists with catecholamines in many adrenergic and noradrenergic neurons. It has been demonstrated to exert pressor effects in the perfused guinea pig heart and to constrict large cerebral and coronary blood vessels in animal studies. To determine if NPY might be a human coronary vasoconstrictor, the authors studied its effect on postmortem human coronary arteries. Proximal epicardial coronary rings were studied in a superfusion apparatus in Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer (37 degrees C, pH 7.4) presaturated with 95% O2-5% CO2. Concentration-response curves were obtained using NPY in 0.1% bovine serum albumin in buffer and the responses were compared to those obtained in the presence of alpha 1, beta, and cyclooxygenase antagonists. A dose-related constrictor effect was obtained with NPY, which was significantly more potent than noradrenaline, constriction often being seen at 10(-12) M concentration. A vasorelaxant effect was seen in nonatherosclerotic vessels at higher concentrations. The vasoconstriction produced by noradrenaline was potentiated by subthreshold concentrations of NPY. The vasoconstrictor effect of NPY was not inhibited by prazosin (10(-6) M), and the vasodilatory effect was not inhibited by propranolol (10(-5) M). Indomethacin (3 X 10(-6) M) did not alter either vasoconstriction or vasorelaxation. The authors conclude that NPY is a potent constrictor of the human coronary artery at concentrations that may be achievable in vivo; it may thus be a contributor to sympathetic enhancement of coronary artery tone.\r"

The authors summarize the clinical, microbiologic, and therapeutic aspects of these patients. Fever, usually higher than 39 degrees C, was the hallmark of the disease. Other manifestations of typhoid, although relatively frequent, are presented as part of a mild nonspecific symptom complex, often found only in the prodromal period. An elevated level of serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase (mean, 81 IU/ml) was the most characteristic laboratory abnormality, occurring in 94% of the patients. Blood cultures were positive in 46 of the 50 patients (92%), and were not affected by prior outpatient antibiotic therapy. The first blood culture was diagnostic in 93% of the cases. Although fever tended to disappear more rapidly among patients receiving ampicillin than among those treated with chloramphenicol, results of therapy were similar in both groups. Nevertheless, the relapse rate of 36% among 25 chloramphenicol-treated patients was significantly higher than the 9% noted among 22 patients treated with ampicillin. Except for one case of hemolytic anemia, serious complications were conspicuously absent, and outcomes were uniformly favorable.\r"

However, an increasing amount of heparin is being used in nontherapeutic protocols to implement newer, more invasive technology when the body's protective clotting mechanism would otherwise interfere. Buried in protocols, heparin has become ubiquitous in standard hospital practice. One such protocol is the use of heparinized solutions to \"flush\" arterial and venous catheters in order to maintain patency and thus, vascular access. Often these flush solutions are considered to be as innocuous as \"simple saline.\" We report a patient who experienced post-operative bleeding resulting from overuse of \"heparin flushes,\" and necessitating a second surgery. The excessive hemorrhage following this inadvertent anticoagulation has been named the \"heparin flush syndrome,\" to call attention to the serious and sometimes fatal side-effects of heparinized solutions.\r"

The effect of 6-iodoamiloride, and analog of the sodium channel blocker amiloride, on mean arterial pressure (MAP) was examined in conscious, freely moving NaCl-sensitive spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR-S) fed high (8%) or normal (1%) NaCl diets. SHR-S and age-matched NaCl-resistant SHR (SHR-R) and normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) control rats were studied at 9 weeks of age after 2 weeks on either high (8%) NaCl or control (1%) NaCl diets. 6-iodoamiloride was infused intravenously in doses of 0.38 or 0.76 mg/100 g body weight, and MAP and heart rate (HR) were monitored from a femoral arterial cannula for 2 hours. The 8% NaCl diet caused a significant elevation in MAP in SHR-S but not in SHR-R or WKY. Administration of 6-iodoamiloride (both doses) produced a significant, sustained decrease in MAP in both SHR-S and SHR-R. Maximal depressor responses to high dose 6-iodoamiloride were significantly enhanced in SHR-S fed 8% NaCl (31.2 +/- 3.7 mm Hg) compared to SHR-S fed 1% NaCl (14.8 +/- 2.4 mm Hg) or SHR-R fed either 8% or 1% NaCl diets (15.6 +/- 4.2 and 10.2 +/- 3.0 mm Hg, respectively). In contrast, feeding an 8% NaCl diet had no significant effect on the depressor responses to 6-iodoamiloride in either SHR-R or WKY rats. In WKY, these doses of 6-iodoamiloride had no significant effect on MAP in either diet group. 6-iodoamiloride had no significant effect on heart rate in any group. These results support the hypothesis that the exacerbation of hypertension in SHR-S fed a high NaCl diet may result from increased membrane sodium channel activity.\r"

Three new techniques are described as modifications of the original Nd:YAG ablation methodology and include: (1) the use of Hyskon as the uterine distending medium; (2) the attachment of a high-resolution endoscopic television camera to the eyepiece of the hysteroscope, which permits the surgeon to view the endometrial cavity and operate via a video monitor; and (3) the application of a specially designed dual-channel operating hysteroscope that allows simultaneous laser ablation and aspiration of debris. Although this operation is a valuable alternative to hysterectomy in selected clinical situations, its major deficiencies are the lack of long-term follow-up data and the absence of a surgical specimen for pathologic analysis.\r"

Pregnancy is characterized by changes in renal blood flow, plasma volume, protein concentration, and hepatic function. These physiologic changes frequently alter drug pharmacokinetics. To define the effect of pregnancy on ritodrine kinetics, we compared ritodrine pharmacokinetics in four pregnant and four nonpregnant rhesus monkeys. Significant differences were demonstrated in the distribution phase half-life (0.40 +/- 0.08 hours in the pregnant monkeys and 0.21 +/- 0.03 hours in the nonpregnant animals), volume of distribution (1.99 +/- 0.94 L/kg in the pregnant monkeys and 4.75 +/- 0.90 L/kg in the nonpregnant animals), plasma clearance (18.8 +/- 7.1 ml/min/kg in the pregnant monkeys and 27.2 +/- 5.0 ml/min/kg in the nonpregnant animals), and disposition half-life (1.8 +/- 0.4 hours in the pregnant monkeys and 3.3 +/- 0.4 hours in the nonpregnant animals). Pregnant animals receiving ritodrine had higher steady-state plasma concentrations than nonpregnant animals (104 versus 53 ng/ml at an infusion rate of 2 micrograms/kg/min).

Two groups of communicating veins could be recognized: rectovaginal and vaginovesical; their anatomic features are described. The communicating veins were unidirectional; they transmitted the dye from the rectal to the vaginovesical plexuses, but not in the reverse direction. A new concept was proposed to explain the high Escherichia coli incidence in genitourinary infections. It explains also the cause of some of the idiopathic genitourinary lesions such as recurrent cervicitis and recurrent bacteriuria. A \"cystovaginohysterography\" could be obtained by injecting the inferior mesenteric vein with barium sulfate. The rectogenital communicating veins have been used in both the diagnosis and the treatment of lesions in pelvic organs.\r"

During an 18-month period from January 1985 to June 1986, 1757 fetal echocardiograms were performed on a total of 989 antenatal patients. Cardiac anomalies were accurately predicted in 74 cases, 34 of which were associated with extracardiac or chromosomal anomalies. Twenty-three pregnancies were electively terminated. Currently the survival rate for ongoing pregnancies is 17%. A false negative diagnosis was made in 16 cases, the majority involving minor anomalies with a good prognosis and a survival rate of 81%. Prenatal detection of congenital heart disease places the fetus at high risk for chromosomal and extracardiac anomalies. Congenital heart disease detectable during pregnancy is usually severe and associated with a poor long-term prognosis. Termination of the pregnancy may be a reasonable option if a severe anomaly is detected early in pregnancy.\r"

One hundred twenty-seven infants with a gestational age less than 36 weeks (mean [+/- SE] gestational age = 31 +/- 3.2 weeks) were studied in the neonatal period with echoencephalography to determine the incidence of white matter necrosis and the perinatal variables associated with this complication. Twenty-three infants (18.3%) had white matter necrosis. Thirteen (10.3%) had cysts by day 3 (11 on day 1), indicating that the onset of white matter necrosis occurred antenatally. The incidence of antenatal white matter necrosis was inversely related to birth weight and was more frequent in infants weighing less than 1000 gm (19%). Stepwise logistic regression analysis of 31 antenatal variables showed that placental vascular anastomoses in multiple pregnancies, funisitis, and purulent amniotic fluid were the only complications associated with antenatal white matter necrosis. Follow-up neurologic evaluations were abnormal in four of six patients with antenatal white matter necrosis. The findings in this study focus attention on prenatal, rather than intrapartum and postnatal, factors as causative agents of neurologic morbidity and emphasize the importance of early and sequential evaluation of neonatal brain structures.\r"

Sixteen patients with obstruction of the proximal portion of one or two fallopian tubes (based on at least two hysterosalpingograms and one laparoscopic examination) were selected for the procedure. Four patients (25%) were found to have patent oviducts on intraoperative third tubal patency evaluation and were therefore excluded from study. Of the remaining 12 patients, tubal patency was achieved in at least one fallopian tube in 7 patients (58%), as demonstrated by hysterosalpingogram immediately after the transcervical balloon tuboplasty procedure. On follow-up 2 months to 1 year afterward, two pregnancies and one delivery occurred. We conclude that transcervical balloon tuboplasty appears to represent a useful and safe technique to achieve patency in selected cases of tubal interstitial obstruction. Reocclusion rates, long-term complication rates, and pregnancy rates after transcervical balloon tuboplasty remain to be established before the procedure should be considered a recommended alternative for either surgical tuboplasty or in vitro fertilization.\r"

However, a small number of areas were identified in which the number of procedures performed was significantly different from the state mean. During fiscal years 1982 to 1985, certain geographic subgroups consistently demonstrated incidence rates significantly greater than the state mean. Although variation (either overutilization or underutilization) from the state rate is not synonymous with inappropriate care, those physicians within the identified geographic areas must take responsibility for ascertaining the explanation for the variance.\r"

The mean gestational age at diagnosis of premature rupture of the membranes was 23.1 +/- 2.7 weeks, with a median of 23.5. The interval from rupture to delivery ranged from 1 to 152 days, with a mean of 13. There was no correlation between gestational age at the time of rupture and the latency period. Thirty-five patients received tocolytic agents and 24 received steroids. Forty-eight percent were delivered within 3 days, 67% within 1 week, and 83% within 2 weeks. There was one maternal death from sepsis; 46 (39%) had amnionitis, and 8 (6.8%) had abruptio placentae. The mean gestational age at the time of delivery was 24.7 +/- 3.6 weeks. The 118 pregnancies resulted in 124 births. There were 17 stillbirths and 67 neonatal deaths, for a total perinatal mortality of 67.7%. In patients with premature rupture of the membranes at less than or equal to 23 weeks the perinatal survival rate was 13.3%, while it was 50% in patients with premature rupture of the membranes at 24 to 26 weeks (p less than 0.0001). Information was charted at 3 to 36 months for 34 of 40 surviving infants. The intact survival rate in this group was 67%, and 33% had some form of developmental abnormality. Expectant management in such cases can be justified in only a limited number of patients (patients who understand and accept the risks and patients beyond 23 weeks of gestation).\r"

In the past, once parenteral antibiotic therapy was instituted, it was continued for 5 to 7 days and until the patient remained afebrile for 48 hours. To shorten the length of hospital stay, the length of parenteral antibiotic administration was reduced and an oral antibiotic was added, to complete a 7- to 10-day course of therapy. We evaluated the effectiveness of an even shorter course of parenteral antibiotics without the addition of oral antibiotics. Forty-two patients with chorioamnionitis and 64 with endomyometritis were enrolled in the study. Antibiotic therapy was continued until the patient's temperature was less than 99.5 degrees F for 12 to 24 hours. Of the 106 patients, only two were readmitted, both as a result of superficial wound separation. No patient had an infectious complication. A shorter course of parenteral antibiotics without the addition of an oral antibiotic gives results comparable to the standard extended treatment regimens, but is advantageous with respect to cost, patient compliance, and hospital stay.\r"

Prolonged rupture of membranes with the subsequent development of chorioamnionitis or postpartum endometritis were risk factors that commonly preceded the diagnosis of septic shock. The majority of septic shock cases occurred during the puerperium. There were two maternal deaths in this selected series. Associated complications included pulmonary edema, adult respiratory distress syndrome, disseminated intravascular coagulation, pulmonary emboli, and cardiac arrest. The primary hemodynamic derangements were reduced systemic vascular resistance with depressed myocardial function. The mean initial systemic vascular resistance index in eight surviving women was 885 +/- 253 dyne.sec/cm5.m2. Despite an overall presenting cardiac index of 4.20 +/- 2.01 L/min/m2, five patients (50%) had evidence of myocardial depression based on analysis of their left ventricular function curves. Mean arterial pressure, systemic vascular resistance, and left ventricular stroke work index all showed significant improvement after therapy. A hemodynamic algorithm based on volume therapy, inotropic agents, and peripheral vasoconstrictors is offered. This therapeutic approach is designed to optimize cardiac performance and maintenance of organ perfusion in the critically ill patient with septic hypotension during pregnancy.\r"

However, there was no difference in activity between pregnancy periods. On the other hand, nitroblue tetrazolium reduction in cervical polymorphonuclear cells excluding women with cervicitis was also greater in pregnant women than in nonpregnant women. Moreover, activity in cervical polymorphonuclear cells gradually increased as pregnancy progressed. This enhanced activity in polymorphonuclear cells may be involved not only in the defense mechanism but also in cervical ripening in pregnancy.\r"

Three of these had lymphoma (non-Hodgkin's), two had squamous cell cancer of the vulva or vagina, and one had breast carcinoma. Two of the three patients with lymphoma had recurrent genital condyloma diagnosed before the coexistent lymphoproliferative disorder was discovered. In all, 11 of 16 patients had dysplasia and neoplasia. Seven of the women had other medical conditions associated with immunosuppression. We conclude that the presence of recurrent condyloma acuminatum in women greater than or equal to 40 years of age should lead to examination for the presence of immunosuppression and its underlying cause. A high index of suspicion for concomitant genital squamous cell neoplasia and lymphoproliferative disorders should be realized. The factors relating age, recurrent condyloma, immunosuppression, and malignant disease are discussed.\r"

Prolactin is produced in vitro by decidualized human endometrium and is secreted in vivo into the uterine luminal fluid of cynomolgus monkeys. Uterine luminal fluid prolactin has not been demonstrated in vivo in human beings. To study cyclic uterine luminal fluid volumes and prolactin levels, uterine luminal fluid was aspirated 8 to 13 times each during a single menstrual cycle in six ovulatory women. No anesthesia was used. Seventy of 75 (93%) attempts were successful; there were no complications. Serum estradiol, progesterone, luteinizing hormone, and prolactin levels were assayed every 1 to 3 days. Uterine luminal fluid volume and prolactin were normalized to the luteinizing hormone peak (day 0). Uterine luminal fluid volumes were relatively constant until the early luteal phase, when they then decreased. Uterine luminal fluid prolactin was detectable in all samples. Mean values were stable until day +3 or +4, after which they rose to a peak at day +9 or +10. This study establishes that (1) frequent uterine luminal fluid sampling is possible; (2) uterine luminal fluid volume decreases in the luteal phase; (3) uterine luminal fluid prolactin is detectable in vivo in women and its concentration increases in the luteal phase; and (4) cyclic human uterine luminal fluid prolactin levels differ from those in cynomolgus monkeys and from those anticipated from human in vitro studies.\r"

We tested the hypothesis that the stimulus responsible for eliciting this intraperitoneal inflammation is retrograde menstruation by measuring the peritoneal fluid volume and leukocyte count in 16 infertile women with endometriosis before and after ovulation suppression with medroxyprogesterone acetate, 30 mg/day for 4 months. Medroxyprogesterone acetate therapy significantly reduced the peritoneal fluid volume (22.5 +/- 4.1 versus 6.8 +/- 0.9 ml mean +/- SE, p less than 0.0001), the peritoneal fluid leukocyte count (30.7 +/- 6.5 versus 7.1 +/- 0.7 x 10(6) cells per patient, p less than 0.0001), and American Fertility Society score (23.2 +/- 5.1 versus 15.4 +/- 4.1, p less than 0.0002).

A prospective study of 110 pregnancies compared amniotic fluid urea nitrogen concentrations with the lecithin/sphingomyelin ratio and presence of phosphatidylglycerol. After determination of gestational age, amniotic fluid was analyzed for urea nitrogen concentration and an aliquot was sent to the hospital's commercial laboratory for lecithin/sphingomyelin and phosphatidylglycerol measurement. An amniotic fluid urea nitrogen level less than 7.4 mg/dl predicted the presence of neonatal respiratory distress syndrome in 12 of 13 patients independent of gestational age and birth weight. This assay can be performed at the bedside with simple equipment in 70 seconds at approximately one-fortieth the cost of present standard lung maturity studies.\r"

The exact proportion of these associations is not known but is expected to be higher than that with live-birth. To estimate the risk that a fetus with an echocardiographically detected heart defect has an autosomal trisomy or Turner syndrome, we adjusted the known frequency of aneuploidy in live-born infants with congenital cardiovascular malformations by the reported rate of spontaneous abortion, with data from a population-based case-control study of congenital cardiovascular malformations in which 268 cases (12.7%) had both congenital cardiovascular malformations and a chromosome abnormality. Included in the present analysis were 188 aneuploid infants with congenital cardiovascular malformations that would have been detectable by fetal echo. When data are adjusted for the high spontaneous abortion rate of aneuploid fetuses, we estimate that there would have been more than a threefold increase in aneuploidy over the 13% seen at live-birth. Thus cytogenetic analysis is appropriate in a fetus with echo-diagnosed congenital cardiovascular malformations.\r"

Among 1231 nonsmoking white women whose blood was sampled during the second trimester of pregnancy, 31.4% had serum cotinine levels between 1.0 and 9.9 ng/ml and were therefore considered to be passively exposed to tobacco smoke. The crude mean birth weight of infants of the women passively exposed to smoke was 107 gm lower than that of infants of unexposed women, and that difference remained after the application of a multivariate analysis that included the major known birth weight-associated covariates. These findings are consistent with a causal relationship between passive exposure to tobacco smoke and birth weight and suggest that the dose-response relationship may not be linear.\r"

In each instance the mother survived, usually sustaining only minor injuries. Some degree of placental abruption or infarction occurred in each case, but fetal abnormalities were more varied. Significant fetal injuries were limited to the head and included two instances of skull fracture associated with cortical lacerations and contusions. Six of the eight fetuses were stillborn, and the other two died during the first postnatal day. At least five of the mothers were unrestrained at the time of the accident, three of whom experienced abdominal impact against the steering wheel but no external abdominal injuries. Although two mothers were wearing seat belts, in only one instance could the seat belt be implicated in contributing to the fetal injury. This study shows that lethal placental or direct fetal injury can occur even though maternal injuries are minor or insignificant. The findings also support current recommendations for use of three-point restraints.\r"

Intermittent partial occlusion of the umbilical circulation for 1 minute of every 3 minutes for 2 hours was associated with a 89% incidence of histologically confirmed damage confined to the cerebral white matter. This occurred without systemic evidence of progressive acidosis, but both fetal heart rate patterns and electrocortical activity were altered. We conclude that in the late gestation fetal lamb, umbilical cord compromise plays a causal role in a specific type of antenatal central nervous system injury.\r"

The differential permeability of endometrial and myometrial vascular beds to estrogens was evaluated in uteri samples obtained during the proliferative and secretive phases of the menstrual cycle. The effects of binding by human serum proteins on estrogen influx into the endometrium and myometrium were also determined by the use of double-isotope, single-injection, timed tissue sampling techniques adapted to the extracorporeal perfusion of human uterus. Tritiated test estrogen was injected into the uterine artery as a mixture with 14C-butanol, a free diffusible reference substance. The influx of 14C-dextran (a membrane-impermeable compound) was used to test the aspecific influx from vasculature to extravascular space. Results show that in the human perfused uterus: (1) membrane permeability plays different roles in estrogen influxes between the endometrium and myometrium; (2) during the proliferative and secretive phase of the menstrual cycle the uterine microvessels are differently permeable to the free plus protein-bound estrogens; and (3) plasma proteins decrease the endometrial and myometrial uptakes of estrogens.\r"

Fetal arterial pH and bicarbonate levels decreased, while plasma norepinephrine and epinephrine concentrations increased more than tenfold. The slope of the descending limb of the fetal heart rate deceleration curve decreased and correlated strongly with fetal arterial pH, bicarbonate, and logarithmic plasma norepinephrine and epinephrine concentrations. Fetal arterial pH and bicarbonate levels were significantly lower in the group with lower fetal heart rate deceleration slope, and a greater plasma catecholamine concentration in this group suggested a redistribution of blood flow to vital organs. Therefore, during repeated umbilical cord compression, the fetal acid-base and hormonal state was predicted by the fetal heart rate deceleration slope. This relationship may be applicable to human fetuses in the diagnosis of fetal distress caused by umbilical cord compression during labor.\r"

The school-based program, Hearty Heart and Friends, involved 15 sessions over five weeks in the third grade classrooms. The home-based program, the Home Team, involved a five-week correspondence course with the third graders, where parental involvement was necessary in order to complete the activities. Outcome measures included anthropometric, psychosocial and behavioral assessments at school, and dietary recall, food shelf inventories, and urinary sodium data collected in the students' homes. Participation rates for all aspects of the study were notably high. Eighty-six per cent of the parents participated in the Home Team and 71 per cent (nearly 1,000 families) completed the five-week course. Students in the school-based program had gained more knowledge at posttest than students in the home-based program or controls. Students in the home-based program, however, reported more behavior change, had reduced the total fat, saturated fat, and monounsaturated fat in their diets, and had more of the encouraged foods on their food shelves. The data converge to suggest the feasibility and importance of parental involvement for health behavior changes with children of this age.\r"

In the 21 remaining states, the legal status of midwives is unclear. Much of the enabling legislation restricts midwifery practice often resulting in situations similar to those in states with prohibitory laws. Given the growth of an extensive grassroots movement of lay midwives committed to quality of care, this outcome suggests that 21 states with no legislation may provide better opportunities for midwifery practice than states with enabling laws.\r"

In univariate analyses, EFM was associated with higher cesarean section rates, lower five-minute Apgar scores, and a higher rate of respiratory distress. Logistic regression analysis controlling for other risk factors for poor neonatal outcome indicated that the association of EFM with higher cesarean section rates persisted (odds ratio 1.45, 95% CI 1.16, 1.81), except in certain pregnancies at very high risk for cesarean section. EFM was associated with an Apgar score less than 6 at five minutes only if delivery was by cesarean section. EFM was not found to be independently associated with respiratory distress. Neither univariate nor multivariate analyses found an association of EFM with neonatal mortality. These results suggest that EFM may identify hypoxic infants, who are frequently delivered by cesarean section. The lack of association of EFM with beneficial neonatal outcomes is consistent either with lack of effect of EFM or with uncontrolled selection bias.\r"

We estimate a model of annual bed days for children ages six months to two and one-half years old, and separately for children two and one-half to five years old. Our results show significantly higher numbers of bed days for children in day care centers than for children at home for both age groups, controlling for confounding factors. Children in family day care have significantly more bed days than those at home, but only among the younger sample. The negative effect of family day care is less than that of child care centers. Although the relative effect of group care is to increase annual bed days by 30 to 19 per cent, the absolute effect is modest with children in group care having 1.3 to .6 more bed days per year.\r"

Fourty-four per cent of the total eligible sample responded to both questionnaires. One year after publication, 62 per cent of physicians participating in both parts of the study were aware of the report. Although availability of a copy (58 per cent), familiarity with the recommendations (81 per cent), and the extent to which care was based on the guidelines (65 per cent) were high, use of the report in practice (17 per cent) and the amount of change in practice behavior required to adhere to the guidelines (18 per cent) were low. Prior to publication of the report, more than two-thirds of responding physicians were found to be practicing in a manner congruent with nine of ten treatment recommendations studied. One year after JNC III's release, they reported practice behavior which was not significantly different. It seems that this consensus report codified, rather than changed, practice behavior in this sample.\r"

  ".W": "From a telephone survey of the health status of a random sample of the general population of Utah, we identified 255 people with adult onset diabetes. We compared them to 622 non-diabetic controls, matched for age, sex, and urban/rural country of residence. We examined diabetes as a risk factor for heart diseases, stroke, and blindness and its interaction with other known risk factors. Diabetes interacted with smoking history so as to increase the risk of stroke, heart disease, and blindness. Diabetes also interacted with hypertension in their effect on the prevalence of blindness and, to a small extent, heart disease. Among the diabetics, duration of diabetes was associated with macrovascular and microvascular complications developing after the diagnosis of diabetes. Those with longer duration of disease showed an increase in risk for microvascular (kidney disease, blindness) and macrovascular (heart disease, stroke, amputations) complications. Although the estimates were imprecise, the effect of duration on macrovascular complications was greater among diabetics with a history of hypertension; the effect on microvascular complications was greater among smokers. The findings are compared to previous studies and the utility of diabetes prevalence data is discussed.\r"

Cancer is the leading cause of YPLL in Italy (23.8 per cent of total YPLL), followed by unintentional injuries (16.3 per cent) and heart disease (11.2 per cent). Rates of YPLL for all causes decreased 12.0 per cent from 1979 to 1983, the strongest declines in absolute terms being observed for prematurity and unintentional injuries, and in percentage decline for pneumonia and influenza, and infectious diseases; during the same period, YPLL for diabetes increased. The rates of YPLL are higher for males than for females (rate ratio = 1.9) especially for causes related to lifestyle factors. Premature mortality is lower in Italy than in the USA, because of the striking difference in mortality from injuries and heart diseases.\r"

Using accident and licensure data over a five-year period, we conducted an evaluation of the impact of the enactment of mandatory driver training on: the risk of accident for newly licensed drivers; the mortality and morbidity of these accidents; the number of new drivers; and the mean age of licensure. Results of our time series analyses show that this legislation had no appreciable effect on the risk of accident or on the mortality/morbidity rate per accident for newly licensed drivers aged 18 and over. However, since 1983, the number of women under 18 years of age getting their first driver's license has increased by 20 per cent, and their mean age has decreased from over 18 to under 18. Mandatory driver training may have increased the numbers and risks of accidents for young, primarily female, drivers.\r"

Public health programs often neglect the human side of AIDS while clinicians often overlook public health issues. Current research on AIDS has failed to address many fundamental questions including: the biology of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in semen; whether present antiretroviral therapy has any effect on sexual infectivity; and whether adequate counseling was given to persons in HIV discordant partner studies. These unanswered basic questions highlight how research efforts framed from clinical, basic science, or public health viewpoints may have too narrow a focus. Three suggestions are made: 1) additional studies about the biology of HIV in the genital tract need to be conducted; 2) clinical trials studying drug therapy of HIV infection need to assess effect on HIV in the genital tract; 3) clinicians involved in studies and care of HIV infection need to implement educational strategies minimizing transmission of HIV from their patients. More interaction between public health and clinical approaches toward AIDS is needed.\r"

On days 7-12 and 14 following an infectious bloodmeal, mosquitoes were tested for their ability to transmit virus and then dissected. Dissemination (systemic infection) rates averaged 22% on days 1-14 and transmission rates 33% on days 7-14. There were no significant differences in the viral titers of midgut samples among the nondisseminated infected (virus limited to alimentary canal), disseminated infected nontransmitting, and transmitting groups of mosquitoes. The sequence of infection of the organs and tissues studied appeared to be as follows: midgut, hemolymph, remnants: salivary glands, ovaries, and thoracic ganglia.

  ".W": "In a study begun in 1985, 1,026 children between the ages of 5 and 12 years, living in an area of low Japanese encephalitis (JE) infection, were vaccinated with live-attenuated JE vaccine, strain SA14-14-2. A group of 47 of the vaccinated children, 5-6 years of age, were examined for fever and other systemic reactions every other day for 2 weeks following vaccination. None of these children had temperatures greater than 37.4 degrees C or other systemic reactions during the observation period. No untoward reactions were reported in the remainder of the vaccinated group. After immunization, seroconversion rates in seronegative children were 100% (GMT 35.3, n = 11), 100% (GMT 31.7, n = 12), and 83.3% (GMT 23, n = 10) in groups receiving vaccine diluted 1:3, 1:5, and 1:50, respectively. These results indicate that the JE SA14-14-2 live-attenuated vaccine is immunogenic and safe for children.\r"

  ".W": "Aedes mediovittatus, a forest and peridomestic mosquito found in the Caribbean area, has previously been shown to be highly susceptible to oral infection with dengue viruses in the laboratory. In the present study, the species was found to transmit all four dengue serotypes vertically (i.e., from one generation to another) at rates much higher than any observed previously for flaviviruses in mosquitoes. Vertical transmission rates (the percentage of parent females transmitting to one or more progeny) ranged up to 95%. Filial infection rates (the percentage of infected progeny) varied widely by family but rates greater than or equal to 20% for individual families were not uncommon. Since Ae. mediovittatus feeds readily on humans and is relatively abundant, there is no apparent reason why it would not serve as a vector of dengue. If it does, vertical transmission of the virus in this species would contribute to the maintenance of viral endemicity.\r"

Anaesthesia was induced with fentanyl and thiopentone; atracurium was administered and the lungs were ventilated artificially with 67% nitrous oxide in oxygen. Tracheal intubation was performed when muscle relaxation was adequate. Arterial pressure, heart rate, plasma noradrenaline and adrenaline concentrations were measured before and after tracheal intubation. A significant increase in catecholamine concentrations occurred in both groups in response to tracheal intubation but the magnitude of the increase in adrenaline was greater in the practolol group. There were no significant differences in arterial pressure or heart rate changes between the groups. We conclude that pretreatment with practolol is of no value in the attenuation of the hypertensive response to direct laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation in previously normotensive patients.\r"

Ninety-eight simulated and two genuine Grade 3 difficult intubations were attempted with the aid of a gum elastic bougie. Seventy-eight tracheal and 22 oesophageal placements of the bougie resulted. No clicks or hold up occurred with the bougie in the oesophagus. Clicks were recorded in 89.7% of tracheal placements of the bougie. Hold up at between 24-40 cm occurred in all tracheal placements. We conclude that these signs are reliable and that they should be taught as part of any difficult intubation drill in which the gum elastic bougie is used.\r"

These levels were then correlated with the appearance of the moistness of the airway mucosa secondary to premedication with atropine. This latter assessment was carried out by one anaesthetist who used a predetermined scale of 1-5, where 1 was very dry and 5 very wet. Significantly higher (p less than 0.05) plasma levels of lignocaine were achieved when the mucosa was 'very dry' especially in children under 2 years of age. The total dose of lignocaine applied to the upper airway of children should probably be reduced, in the presence of a 'dry' mucosa after effective antisialogogue premedication, and especially when less than 2 years of age.\r"

Twenty-seven patients were reversed from 91%-99% twitch depression. Recovery of the first twitch of a train-of-four to 95% of control twitch took at least 20 minutes with neostigmine 30 micrograms/kg. The higher doses were significantly faster (60 micrograms/kg p less than 0.05, 80 micrograms/kg p less than 0.01) and took 15.8 and 14.8 minutes respectively. Reversal to a train of four ratio of 0.75 was not consistently achieved in under 30 minutes with any dose of neostigmine. Nineteen patients were antagonised from a 67%-80% depression of first twitch and in all but two recovery to 95% of control took under 10 minutes. To achieve a train of four ratio of 0.75 took less than 12.5 minutes except in three patients, two of whom, both given neostigmine 30 micrograms/kg, took longer than 20 minutes. Neostigmine 60 micrograms/kg produced as rapid a degree of antagonism as 80 micrograms/kg. Heart rates after reversal decreased gradually in all groups, although the decrease was initially greater in the low dose neostigmine (30 micrograms/kg) group. A fixed 5:1 ratio of neostigmine and glycopyrronium will usually antagonise a moderate (70%-80%) pancuronium block to a train of four of greater than 75% within 12.5 minutes if at least 60 micrograms/kg of neostigmine is administered. More than 30 minutes may be required for reversal whatever the dose of neostigmine, for antagonism from greater than 90% twitch depression.\r"

There were neither differences in intubation conditions nor in the occurrence of postoperative diplopia whichever muscle relaxant was used. Deficits in grip strength and expiratory force were seen at one hour after reversal with atropine 1.2 mg and neostigmine 2.5 mg in all patients, deficits which persisted for 3 hours in those who received alcuronium. The recovery of inspiratory force was slower and less complete at up to 3 hours in those who received alcuronium and there was a high incidence of minor postoperative morbidity at up to 24 hours in each of the three groups. The only statistical difference in symptomatic morbidity was an increase in muscle weakness in those who received alcuronium compared with atracurium at 3 hours after laparoscopy. Only 25%, 20% and 31% of the patients who received atracurium, alcuronium and vecuronium respectively said that they would have liked to be day stay patients.\r"

  ".W": "The authors investigated the effects of a volatile anesthetic (isoflurane) on the functional properties of a well characterized membrane ion channel (the acetylcholine receptor channel), using the patch clamp electrophysiological method together with local microperfusion of isoflurane. They found that isoflurane causes single acetylcholine receptor channels to \"flicker\" rapidly between open and closed states, reminiscent of the kinetic pattern induced by local anesthetics. The mean amplitude of currents flowing through open channels was unchanged. Although these observations initially suggested that isoflurane blocks open ion channels, closer analysis of the \"isoflurane pattern\" revealed features inconsistent with classical open channel block: the duration of bursts of channel openings is shortened, and that of the brief closures within bursts lengthens as the concentration of isoflurane is increased. The authors suggest that isoflurane exerts its characteristic effects on the kinetic properties of acetylcholine receptor channel by an allosteric mechanism. In addition, and apart from their mechanistic significance, these effects may underlie the known potentiation by isoflurane of curariform neuromuscular blockade.\r"

  ".W": "Despite the numerous studies examining the relative merits of crystalloids versus colloids for expansion of intravascular volume, little attention has been directed to the cerebral effects of these solutions. In particular, the effect of changes in plasma oncotic pressure on brain water content are poorly understood. The authors recently examined the acute effects of changes in plasma osmolality and colloid oncotic pressure in normal animals, and found that a 65% reduction in oncotic pressure had no detectable effect on brain water content or intracranial pressure. In an effort to extend these studies to a more clinically relevant situation, the authors have now compared the acute effects of 0.9% saline, 6% hetastarch, and 5% albumin on regional cerebral water content and intracranial pressure in an animal model of brain injury produced by focal cortical freezing. Under general anesthesia and following the production of the cryogenic brain lesion, rabbits underwent a 45-min period of isovolemic hemodilution to a hematocrit of 20-25% with one of the three selected fluids. The saline group required approximately twice as much fluid (207 +/- 17 ml) to maintain a stable mean arterial pressure and central venous pressure as did the hetastarch (105 +/- 14 ml) or albumin (103 +/- 29 ml) groups. As intended, the oncotic pressure decreased by a mean of 9.6 +/- 2.4 mmHg in the saline group, while remaining stable in the hetastarch and albumin groups. There were no significant changes in osmolality in any group during the hemodilution period.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Using rats in which incomplete cerebral ischemia was induced, the authors evaluated the effects of halothane (H) and isoflurane (I) on neurologic outcome compared to nitrous oxide (N2O) controls. Incomplete cerebral ischemia was produced by right carotid artery occlusion combined with hemorrhagic hypotension. Neurologic outcome was evaluated using a graded deficit score from 0 to 5 (0 = normal, 5 = death associated with stroke). Two levels of cerebral ischemia were tested. At moderate ischemia with hypotension of 30 mmHg, an FIO2 of 0.3, and ischemic periods of 30 or 45 min, N2O produced a deficit of 4.7-5.0 and a mortality rate of 90-100%. In contrast, halothane (1 MAC) and isoflurane (1 MAC) resulted in similar deficit scores (H = 1.1-1.8, I = 1.4-1.6) and mortality rates (H = 17-30%, I = 17-20%). Cerebral blood flow (CBF) measured with radioactive microspheres showed a 60-65% decrease in the ischemic hemisphere at this level of hypotension. With severe ischemia with hypotension = 25 mmHg, FIO2 = 0.2, and a 30-min period of ischemia, deficit scores increased to 3.0 and 3.9 with 1 MAC halothane and 1 MAC isoflurane, respectively. Mortality rates also increased to 40% with halothane and 70% with isoflurane. Increasing the concentration of halothane or isoflurane to 2 MAC did not significantly improve outcome. Brain histology demonstrated extensive neuronal damage in striatal, hippocampal, and neocortical regions of N2O control treated rats, and less damage with little difference between H- and I-treated rats at each level of ischemia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Rats received either 5 or 30 mg/kg ketamine intravenously as a loading dose, followed by an infusion to maintain a steady-state level of the drug. An additional group received 30 mg/kg as a single injection only, and was studied 20 min later, by which time they were recovering consciousness (withdrawal group). Regional brain energy metabolism was evaluated with [6-14C]glucose and quantitative autoradiography during a 5-min experimental period. A subhypnotic, steady-state dose (5 mg/kg) of ketamine caused a stimulation of glucose use in most brain areas, with an average increase of 20%. At the larger steady-state dose (30 mg/kg, which is sufficient to cause anesthesia), there was no significant effect on most brain regions; some sensory nuclei were depressed (inferior colliculus, -29%; cerebellar dentate nucleus, -18%; vestibular nucleus, -16%), but glucose use in the ventral posterior hippocampus was increased by 33%. In contrast, during withdrawal from a 30-mg/kg bolus, there was a stimulation of glucose use throughout the brain (21-78%), at a time when plasma ketamine levels were similar to the levels in the 5 mg/kg group. At each steady-state dose, as well as during withdrawal, ketamine caused a notable stimulation of glucose use by the hippocampus.\r"

  ".W": "The serum and urinary concentrations of fluorinated metabolites of isoflurane after inhalation of three different concentrations of isoflurane were studied in 18 ASA physical status 1 or 2 patients, scheduled for orthopedic or otolaryngeal surgery. Isoflurane was administered for 60 min during fentanyl-nitrous oxide-oxygen, and its end-tidal concentration was maintained at 0.3, 0.6, or 1.15% (groups I, II, and III). The organic fluorine was determined by combustion and fluoride ions were analyzed by ion chromatography. The amounts were expressed in terms of fluoride ion. The concentrations of serum fluoride ion and organic fluorine increased significantly 15 min after the onset of inhalation of isoflurane. The mean peak values of fluoride ions were 3.8 +/- 1.1, 3.9 +/- 1.4, and 4.2 +/- 0.9 mumole/1 (M +/- SD) in patients in groups I, II, and III, respectively. The half-lives of fluoride ion and of organic fluorine as metabolites of isoflurane, calculated from the amounts excreted in urine, were 36 h and 41 h, respectively. The cumulative amounts of fluoride ion and organic fluorine excreted up to the 6th postoperative day were 548 +/- 230 and 785 +/- 452 mumoles in group I, 594 +/- 138 and 1,378 +/- 807 mumoles in group II, and 1,032 +/- 496 and 728 +/- 265 mumoles (M +/- SD) in group III, respectively. The urinary excreted fluoride ion increased in proportion to the dose of isoflurane and approximately 1.3 mmol was excreted per 1 MAC X hour inhalation of isoflurane. The authors concluded that isoflurane might be biotransformed to a greater extent than reported previously, although the serum fluoride ion level was found to be low.\r"

Twenty patients were studied: 12 with renal failure who were to receive kidney transplants from cadaveric donors, and eight with normal renal function. After oral premedication with diazepam, 10 mg, anesthesia was induced with thiopental, 4 mg/kg iv, and maintained with the inhalation of 60% nitrous oxide and 0.9-1.1% isoflurane, end-tidal concentration, in 40% oxygen. The force of thumb adduction in response to supramaximal ulnar nerve stimulation was monitored and recorded. An intravenous bolus of vecuronium, 0.1 mg/kg, was administered after 15 min of a stable end-tidal isoflurane concentration, as measured by mass spectrometry. Venous blood was then sampled at frequent intervals for 4 h following the bolus. Vecuronium concentrations in plasma were quantified by a sensitive and specific gas chromatographic assay. Data were analyzed by nonlinear least squares regression and described by a two-compartment model. The duration of neuromuscular blockade was longer in patients with renal failure than in those with normal renal function. This increased duration may be related to both a decreased plasma clearance and a prolonged elimination half-life of vecuronium in the renal failure group.\r"

  ".U": "88307987\r", 
  ".W": "Based primarily on results obtained during exercise treadmill testing, electrocardiographic (ECG) leads II and V5 are the suggested optimal leads for detecting intraoperative myocardial ischemia. However, these recommendations have not been validated in this setting using all 12 ECG leads. Accordingly, the authors studied 105 patients with known or suspected coronary artery disease (CAD) undergoing noncardiac surgery with general anesthesia by continuously recording the 12-lead ECG intraoperatively in all patients. The average duration of monitoring was 8.2 +/- 2.7 h (mean +/- SD). Ischemic episodes (i.e., greater than or equal to 1-mm horizontal or downsloping ST depression, greater than or equal to 1.5-mm slowly upsloping ST depression or greater than or equal to 1.5-mm ST elevation in a non-Q wave lead) occurred in 25 patients (24%). Out of 51 ischemic episodes, 45 involved ST depression alone, and the remaining six involved both ST depression and elevation. ST segment changes occurred in a single lead only in 14 episodes, while multiple leads were involved in 37 episodes. Lead sensitivity was estimated assuming that all ST segment changes were true positive responses. Sensitivity using a single lead was greatest in V5 (75%) and V4 (61%), and intermediate in II, V3, and V6 (33%, 24%, and 37%, respectively). The remaining seven leads demonstrated very low sensitivity (2-14%) or exhibited no ischemic changes (I and a VL). Combining leads V4 and V5 increased sensitivity to 90%, while the standard clinical combination, II and V5, was only 80% sensitive. Sensitivity increased to 96% by combining II, V4, and V5. The further addition of V2 and V3 (five leads) increased sensitivity to 100%. This study confirms previous recommendations for the routine use of a V5 lead (either uni- or bipolar) in all patients at risk for ischemia. V4 is more sensitive than lead II, and should be considered as a second choice. However, lead II, superior for detection of atrial dysrhythmias, is more easily obtained with conventional monitors. The use of all three would appear to be the optimal arrangement for most clinical needs, and is recommended if the clinician has the capability.\r"

  ".W": "The authors studied the wild type strain, N2, and three mutant strains of the nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans, in order to measure genetically produced changes in responses to nine volatile anesthetics. They determined the anesthetic ED50s of N2 for thiomethoxyflurane, methoxyflurane, chloroform, halothane, enflurane, isoflurane, fluroxene, flurothyl, and diethylether. The log-log relationship of the oil-gas partition coefficients (O/G) and the ED50s of these agents for N2 yields a straight line with a slope of -.997 with a R2 of .98 over a range of O/G (at 37 degrees C) from 48 to 7230. When the O/Gs are corrected to 22 degrees C, the slope is -.964 with an R2 of .98. This relationship is similar to that found in other animals. Two mutant strains, unc-79 and unc-80, show altered responses to these anesthetics. These strains are two to three times more sensitive than N2 to anesthetics with an O/G greater than that of halothane (220 at 37 degrees C), yet they differ little from N2 in response to anesthetics with lower O/Gs. unc-79 and unc-80 are about 30% more sensitive than N2 to diethylether. The double mutant unc-79; unc-80 is more sensitive to halothane, isoflurane, and fluroxene than is either mutant alone. The authors believe these data indicate an alteration at the site of action of volatile anesthetics in unc-79 and unc-80. They also postulate that the interaction of unc-79 and unc-80 indicate these genes code for enzymes in a common pathway, and that unc-79 precedes unc-80 in this pathway.\r"

The evaluation was based on patients' clinical observation, electrocardiography, echocardiography, and chest x-ray. More than a simple review, this study was undertaken with the aim of arriving at a better clinical definition of the cardiovascular manifestations found in ankylosing spondylitis. In fact, of the 40 patients, 8 (20%) had systemic hypertension for which an explanation could not be found, 4 of whom were less than forty-five years old; the echocardiogram showed mitral valve prolapse in 4 patients (10%), 2 of them with a systolic murmur and other 2 with a protosystolic click on auscultation. More significant than the changes in conduction was the finding of a sinus bradycardia in 9 patients (22.5%), and a PR interval below 120 msec in 3 patients (7.5%). The authors conclude that the extension of cardiovascular changes in ankylosing spondylitis is more vast than usually acknowledged.\r"

Before injection of contrast material, venous return from the distal part of the limb was temporarily suspended by inflating a tourniquet surrounding the lower part of the thigh to a level higher than the systolic pressure. Toward the end of the injection procedure the patient performed a valsalva maneuver. Phlebography showed that the recurrent varices were more frequently in continuity with the great saphenous vein than collateral to it. Their tortuous or irregular outline did not usually correspond in position or appearance to normal tributaries of the vein. Radiographs of excised great saphenous vein injected with barium sulfate suspension showed that the valves of tributaries proximal to the site of surgical interruption of the vein remained competent. The findings provide further evidence of neovascularization in recurrence of varices of the great saphenous vein at the site of transection.\r"

A left ventriculogram revealed highly reduced wall motion. A coronary angiogram showed left main trunk aneurysm with complete occlusion of the left anterior descending artery and ramification of the right coronary artery close to the ostium. Six months after discharge, he died suddenly. On autopsy, aneurysms were observed in the left main trunk and right coronary artery, together with an old anteroseptal myocardial infarction. Although he did not have a clear history of febrile disease in childhood, he was highly suspected to be a long-term survivor of Kawasaki disease because of the unique form and distribution of the coronary artery aneurysms.\r"

All patients had pathologic findings typical of neuroendocrine tumors by electron microscopy (22 patients), light microscopy (6 patients), or immunochemical staining (1 patient). Patient age ranged from 18 to 77 years; 21 were men and 8 were women; and 12 had no history of tobacco use. Seventeen patients had metastatic tumor at two or more locations. Common metastatic sites included the retroperitoneum, lymph nodes (particularly cervical), and mediastinum. In most patients, these neoplasms showed an aggressive biology, with rapid onset of symptoms and rapid growth of metastases. Major responses were seen in 18 of 25 patients who received combination chemotherapy; 6 patients achieved a complete response. Three patients remain disease-free more than 24 months after completing therapy. Four patients with single sites of disease received local therapy only; all remain disease-free 1 to 10 years after completion of therapy. In 4 patients, specific tumor types were eventually recognized: small cell lung cancer, 1; gastrointestinal carcinoid tumor, 2; and extragonadal germinal tumor with predominant neuroendocrine differentiation, 1. In the remaining 25 patients, no well-recognized type of neuroendocrine tumor was identified. Recognition of these tumors broadens the spectrum of neuroendocrine neoplasia, and also identifies a distinct subset of patients with poorly differentiated carcinoma of unknown primary site. Although optimal therapy remains undefined, these patients are usually responsive to combination chemotherapy, and long-term survival is attainable in a minority.\r"

  ".W": "STUDY OBJECTIVE: To determine the optimal staging evaluation at the time of initial diagnosis of mycosis fungoides or the Sezary syndrome. DESIGN: Retrospective review of a uniformly staged inception cohort. SETTING: Single-institution tertiary care center. PATIENTS: 152 consecutive patients who had mycosis fungoides with or without the Sezary syndrome within 6 months of the initial definitive diagnosis. INTERVENTION: A detailed staging evaluation including physical examination, routine laboratory studies, chest roentgenogram, lymphangiogram, peripheral blood smear, lymph node biopsy, bone marrow aspirate or biopsy, and liver biopsy in selected patients. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Univariate adverse prognostic features at initial diagnosis in patients with mycosis fungoides included (P less than 0.01) one or more cutaneous tumors or generalized erythroderma, adenopathy, blood smear involvement with Sezary cells, lymph node effacement, eosinophilia, and visceral involvement. Important, independent prognostic factors in a multivariate analysis are the presence of visceral disease and type of skin involvement. CONCLUSIONS: A staging system based on histopathologic evaluation of skin, lymph nodes, blood, and visceral sites provides more comprehensive prognostic information than clinical evaluation of skin disease and adenopathy. Patients may be divided at initial presentation into three prognostic groups: good-risk patients, who have plaque-only skin disease without lymph node, blood, or visceral involvement (median survival, greater than 12 years); intermediate-risk patients, who have cutaneous tumors, erythroderma, or plaque disease with node or blood involvement but no visceral disease or node effacement (median survival, 5 years); and poor-risk patients, who have visceral involvement or node effacement (median survival, 2.5 years).\r"

As a follow-up to a previous study of research activity in the same population, this retrospective survey focused on location of training, source of funding, structure of the training program, impact of the training experience on career development, and respondents' recommendations for changes in training programs. A predominant finding is that most postdoctoral training occurred in medical schools, and the primary source of funding was the National Institutes of Health. For faculty members with the MD degree, being an active researcher and principal investigator for a peer-reviewed research grant were associated with length of training. The average length of time between the end of postdoctoral research training and obtaining the first peer-reviewed research grant was 24 months, regardless of length of training, source of training support, training site, or type of academic degree (MD, MD-PhD, or PhD). The results of this survey suggest a tentative formula to be a successful researcher in academic medicine: 2 or more years of postdoctoral research training, including formal course work in the fundamental sciences pertinent to biomedical research; 2 to 3 years of full research support from the academic institution until the first extramural grant is obtained; and commitment of at least 33% of time to research activities. The results also suggest directions for change and improvement in future research training programs.\r"
