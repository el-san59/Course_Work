  ".W": "The development of culture conditions for growing normal human thymic epithelial (TE) cells free from contamination with other stromal cells has allowed us to identify and characterize TE cell-derived cytokines. In this study, we report that cultured human TE cells produced CSF that supported the growth of clonal hematopoietic progenitor cells in the light density fraction of human bone marrow cells. Thymic epithelial supernatants (TES) induced growth of granulocyte/macrophage colonies (CFU-GM), mixed granulocyte/erythrocyte/monocyte/megakaryocyte colonies (CFU-GEMM), and early burst-forming unit erythroid colonies (BFU-E). In addition, TES induced differentiation of the promyelocyte leukemic cell line HL-60 and stimulated growth of both granulocyte (CFU-G) and monocyte (CFU-M) colonies from murine bone marrow cells. Using anion exchange column chromatography, pluripotent CSF activities in TES were separated and shown to be distinct from an IL-1-like cytokine that has been shown as a TE cell-derived cytokine (TE-IL-1). Colony-stimulating activity supporting the growth of bone marrow CFU-GEMM, BFU-E, and CFU-GM co-eluted at 150 to 180 mM NaCl. A separate peak of CFU-GM-stimulating activity eluted early in the gradient at 20 mM NaCl. In Northern blot analysis of enriched RNA, synthetic oligonucleotide probes complementary to human G-CSF and M-CSF coding sequence each hybridized with a single RNA species of 1.7 and 4.4 kb, respectively. These data suggest that normal human TE cells synthesize G-CSF and M-CSF that promote differentiation of non-lymphoid hematopoietic cell precursors.\r"

  ".W": "NK cell-dependent resistance of F1 hybrid mice to parental H-2b hemopoietic allografts is directed to cell surface structures controlled by the Hh-1 locus in or near the H-2D region. Crucial to an understanding of this enigmatic phenomenon is the information on the biochemical nature of the Hh-1 locus-controlled structures. Therefore, we examined the effect of tunicamycin (TM), an inhibitor of asparagine-linked glycosylation and ganglioside biosynthesis, on the expression of Hh-1 determinants in H-2b/Hh-1b lymphomas. The Hh-1b determinants on EL-4 and RBL-5 cells were no longer detectable after TM treatment, as demonstrated by the failure of the treated cells to inhibit hybrid resistance to parental H-2b bone marrow cells in vivo. This interpretation was supported by the unaltered ability of the TM-treated cells to localize in the spleens of irradiated F1 hybrid recipients. In contrast, TM caused only moderate reduction in H-2Kb and H-2Db expression as measured by binding of specific antibodies. This was accompanied by reduced susceptibility to alloimmune anti-H-2Db CTL, but not to anti-H-2Kb CTL. No decrease was found in the susceptibility to NK cell cytotoxicity in vitro. These data indicate that N-linked glycosylation or ganglioside synthesis is crucial for the expression of the Hh-1 locus-controlled target structures, but not for the H-2 class I molecules. The data also show that the Hh-1b determinants are substantially different from those which confer the susceptibility to NK cell-mediated in vitro cytotoxicity.\r"

  ".W": "We have performed experiments to investigate possible physical interactions between C receptors (CR) and surface Ig (sIg) on the B cell plasma membrane. These molecules were found to be independent, non-linked, B cell surface structures, because capping CR1, CR2, sIgM, or sIgD with a specific antibody did not affect the distribution of the remainder of these molecules. Both CR1 and CR2, if bound by antibodies that did not independently cap CR, however, became associated with cross-linked sIg because CR that have been bound by intact anti-CR antibodies or their Fab fragments co-capped with sIgM or sIgD that had been bound by divalent anti-IgM or anti-IgD antibody. CR1 that had bound C3b similarly co-capped with sIg when sIg was cross-linked. Ligand-bound or even cross-linked CR did not associate with non-cross-linked sIg because sIgD, bound by a univalent Fab fragment of anti-IgD antibody, did not co-cap with CR that had been cross-linked by a sandwich of mouse anti-CR antibody and goat anti-mouse Ig. Other surface molecules, such as B1 and HLA-DR Ag, when bound by specific antibodies, did not cap with cross-linked sIg, and sIgD, when bound by a univalent Fab fragment of anti-IgD antibody, did not co-cap with cross-linked sIgM. Interactions between CR and sIg were not mediated by an association with IgG FcR because co-capping of CR and sIg was observed when F(ab')2 fragments of both anti-CR and anti-Ig antibodies were used. These results demonstrate that B cell surface CR can become associated with sIg, but only if sIg is cross-linked and CR is bound by anti-CR antibody or has bound its natural ligand.\r"

  ".W": "Human neutrophil elastase (HNE) has been well-studied with respect to its role in pathologic states, but less is known about the physiologic functions of this important granulocyte enzyme. In the present study, we show that HNE can degrade the major circumsporozoite protein of the infective (sporozoite) stage of Plasmodium vivax malaria, and that this enzyme can also interfere with the cytoadherence of human E infected with Plasmodium falciparum (strain K+ FMG-FCR3) (IE). Cytoadherence reactions are not only blocked by treatment of IE with as little as 10 fg HNE/IE, but already adherent IE are also removed by the enzyme. Normal E surface Ag are not extensively destroyed by these doses of HNE. This suggests that the effect of HNE on cytoadherence is selective and probably due to degradation of the malarial Ag exported to the IE surface and responsible for the formation of \"recognition knobs\" upon which the cytoadherence reaction depends. This conclusion, in turn, was supported by the results of Western blot analysis showing that HNE degrades a high m.w. Ag found exclusively in membrane extracts of IE. Our results suggest that one physiologic role of HNE may be degradation of parasitic antigens during host defense against malaria.\r"

We investigated the degree of epidermal differentiation that could be achieved after in vivo grafting onto nude mice by means of light and electronmicroscopy as well as by immunohistochemistry. All transplanted grafts showed a primary take. The grafts formed an epidermis with a stratum corneum and from day 7 to 14 after transplantation a distribution of a 56.5 Kd keratin protein, involucrin, profilaggrin/filaggrin, and MHC-I antigens that was similar to what is noted in normal human epidermis. These data indicate that a full terminal differentiation was only achieved after in vivo transplantation of the cultured epithelium. Pigmentation was present, but no marker of Langerhans cells was seen at 4 weeks. Although there was no evidence of the dermal equivalent after 2 weeks, we noted a strong adherence of the graft to the wound bed, with the presence of type-IV collagen, laminin, and bullous pemphigoid antigen at the dermo-epidermal junction (day 7) and hemidesmosomes, a lamina lucida and a lamina densa (day 30). No epithelial damage was noted in spite of an inflammatory infiltrate in the underlying tissue. This represents a preliminary step in the use of such a skin-equivalent in the treatment of human patients with wounds.\r"

Hairless mice were irradiated three times a week for 10 weeks with sunlamps (UVA and UVB) and the skin was examined using immunochemical and biochemical techniques. Indirect immunofluorescence was performed with antibodies directed against elastin, microfibrillar proteins, and fibronectin. Increased fluorescence was observed in the actinically damaged skin for elastin, microfibrillar proteins, and fibronectin. The elastic fiber components, elastin and microfibrillar proteins, were then isolated and quantified. Control skin contained approximately 0.1% by dry weight of elastic fiber components, whereas actinically damaged skin contained 0.2% by dry weight. These data are consistent with previous observations of elastic fiber hyperplasia in UV irradiated mice. In addition, irradiated mouse skin contained 1.12 mg of extracted fibronectin per gram wet weight as compared with 0.59 mg in control skin. Irradiated mouse skin contained increased quantities of hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulfate (uronic acid content). These studies further support the validity of the UV irradiated hairless mouse as a model of human dermal photoaging.\r"

In search of additional tools for early diagnosis and an elucidation of the pathogenic mechanisms we investigated the expression kinetics of hemopoietic differentiation and class II alloantigens on both resident and passenger skin cells after bone marrow transplantation. HLA-DR antigens, which are found normally on the dendritic epidermal Langerhans cells only, are synthesized and expressed by keratinocytes within lesions of acute and chronic cutaneous graft-vs-host disease. Within non-lesional skin, however, during the course of cutaneous graft-vs-host eruptions, no clear cut expression of keratinocyte-bound HLA-DR antigens can be identified, suggesting that this phenomenon is locally restricted rather than generalized. Furthermore, our data indicate that within lesions clinically suggestive of cutaneous graft-vs-host disease but lacking diagnostic histopathologic criteria, KC-bound HLA-DR antigens can be readily identified. The second class II alloantigens investigated within the epidermis, the HLA-DQ antigens, were seen on Langerhans cells only and were not or only rarely detectable on keratinocytes. Several subtypes of CD3+ T lymphocytes were present in the epidermis of acute graft-versus-host lesions: one portion of CD3+ T lymphocytes also displayed the CD8 antigen; one portion, mainly localized within the basal layer, displayed the CD8 and/or the CD4 antigen; and one portion did not allow identification of CD8, CD4, or Leu7 antigens. In chronic cutaneous graft-versus-host lesions CD3+/CD8+ T lymphocytes predominated. CD1+ epidermal Langerhans cells were reduced in number and appeared rounded with blunt dendrites both in acute and chronic cutaneous graft-vs-host disease, but also, though to a lesser extent, within normal appearing skin from bone marrow transplanted patients without cutaneous graft-vs-host disease.\r"

Subsequently, KTGF has been purified to high specific activity and found to be distinct from IL-2 and IL-4 by a variety of biochemical, immunologic, and immunochemical criteria. Because it was found that certain HT-2 cell lines also proliferated in response to GM-CSF, the present study asked whether KTGF was related to GM-CSF. In this study, we demonstrate that antibodies to recombinant murine GM-CSF completely neutralize the capacity of KTGF to induce HT-2 proliferation without interfering with IL-2 or IL-4 induced HT-2 proliferation. Furthermore, poly-A+ RNA homologous to murine GM-CSF cDNA as judged by S1 nuclease analysis was detected in Pam 212 cells, and protein serologically homologous to GM-CSF was found in Pam 212 conditioned medium. We conclude that KTGF is identical to GM-CSF. The T-cell activating properties of GM-CSF require further exploration.\r"

  ".W": "Based on epidemiologic data, a current hypothesis states that Fogo selvagem (FS) may be triggered by environmental factors present in endemic areas of Brazil. Because the appearance of new cases is limited to those areas, we wanted to ascertain if the presence of the pemphigus autoantibodies was restricted to the patients. To further delineate the restriction of the autoantibody response in these patients we also investigated the presence of lupus-associated autoantibodies. Using indirect immunofluorescence (IF) we tested the sera of patients with FS (n = 196), their relatives (n = 138), their cohabitants (n = 13), and normal donors from endemic (n = 38) and non-endemic areas (n = 44) for pemphigus autoantibodies. Antinuclear antibodies (ANA) and anti-nDNA antibodies were determined by indirect IF against Hep-2 cells and Crithidia lucilliae, respectively. Autoantibodies against nRNP, Ro/SSA, La/SSB, and Sm were assayed by double immune diffusion in agarose gels. FS autoantibodies were present in the sera of all patients with active disease (n = 196, 100%, titers greater than 40 to 2560), but were not found in any sera from normal individuals in endemic or non-endemic areas. The titer of the FS autoantibody showed a rough correlation with the extent and activity of the disease. Furthermore, lupus-associated autoantibodies were not present in any of the tested samples. We conclude the FS antiepidermal autoantibodies are specific serologic markers of the disease and are not present in unaffected individual from the endemic areas. As such, they provide an important marker that should be useful in ongoing epidemiologic studies aimed at identifying putative etiologic agent(s).\r"

  ".W": "High molecular weight kininogen (HMWK) is a multifunctional protein that is a parent molecule for bradykinin, a cofactor for coagulation, and an inhibitor of cysteine proteases. On immunoblot, nonreduced plasma HMWK is usually two bands at 140 kd and 120 kd; reduced plasma HMWK is a single band at 120 kd. In both concentration-dependent and time-dependent experiments kaolin-activated normal plasma HMWK becomes cleaved in an ordered sequence. When nonreduced, HMWK on immunoblot in kaolin-activated plasma changes in size from a 140 kd band through a 120 kd intermediate to result in a stable 100 kd protein. When reduced, HMWK on immunoblot in kaolin-activated plasma changes from a single 120 kd band through a 56 kd intermediate to result in a stable 46 kd protein. A similar sequence of cleavage of plasma HMWK occurs when the soluble activator dextran sulfate is used to stimulate the system. Cleavage of plasma HMWK after kaolin activation occurs similarly in factor XI-deficient plasma as in normal plasma but is decreased in prekallikrein-deficient plasma. Prolonged kaolin activation of prekallikrein-deficient plasma results in HMWK cleavage to bands below 120 kd. No band of plasma HMWK below 120 kd appears in prolonged kaolin-activated factor XII-deficient plasma. In some patients with sepsis, detectable cleavage of plasma HMWK to bands below 120 kd may not be seen, even though the patient has other evidence for contact system activation. In conclusion, these studies indicate that certain cleaved patterns of plasma HMWK on immunoblot indicate prior activation of the contact system. However, the absence of these cleaved forms of plasma HMWK in a single plasma does not exclude the occurrence of contact activation.\r"

The smooth and concise margins suggested an etiology of middle ear infection. A method which allows decalcification of ancient specimens without disintegration of the eardrum and other soft tissues within the temporal bone was described. There was evidence of histological repair at the margins of the perforation consistent with sequela of otitis media. No other abnormalities were observed in the temporal bones of this individual. There was no evidence of otosclerosis bilaterally. To our knowledge, this is the first time that a pathological tympanic membrane perforation has been histologically documented in an ancient temporal bone.\r"

One hundred and sixty three adults with active chronic otitis media were randomly allocated to receive either antibiotic/steroid ear drops or placebo therapy over a 4-6 week period. Fifty-two per cent of ears receiving active therapy, as opposed to 30 per cent on placebo therapy (p less than 0.05), became otoscopically inactive if compliance to medication was greater than 70 per cent. However, when there was an open mastoid cavity, active therapy was no more successful than placebo. Though gentamicin was the antibiotic used, there was no evidence of ototoxic inner ear damage. Surprisingly, correlation between clinical activity and patient report of a discharge was poor. Forty per cent of both treatment groups considered that their ear had become dry following therapy and these were not the same patients whose ears had become otoscopically inactive.\r"

We would therefore recommend that, in all cases of obscure cervical lymphadenopathy, CSD should be considered and a documentation of domestic pets actively sought. We would also advise that in those cases of parotid CSD in which either the diagnosis is equivocal, CS antigen is unavailable or intense parotid pain is a predominant feature, excision of the primary lesion together with surgical decompression of the parotid capsule should be performed.\r"

Highly significant (p less than 0.001) synchronous sinusoidal seasonal cycles, peaking in the first month of winter, were demonstrated for plasma levels of total (TOT-C), low-density lipoprotein (LDL-C), and high-density lipoprotein (HDL-C) cholesterol. Their mean seasonal changes (nadir to zenith) were 7.4, 6.4, and 0.8 mg/dl, respectively. An irregular but statistically significant seasonal pattern was also observed for plasma triglyceride (TG) levels, with peak levels in the autumn. The variation of these seasonal effects among subgroups and geographic locales and their correlation with seasonal weight and dietary patterns yielded few clues as to their underlying etiologic mechanisms.\r"

Their spectrum of activity allows the economical substitution of ticarcillin disodium/clavulanate potassium for anaerobe-active cephalosporins and for the traditionally used combination of clindamycin and an aminoglycoside. Indeed, the ticarcillin disodium/clavulanate potassium spectrum was judged to be broader than that of the other agents while maintaining comparable or superior clinical efficacy and safety. The beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations have also proven their economical application to the prevention of infections after trauma and elective surgery, although those indications have not been well accepted. The timing seems to be right for the expanded use of these combinations in order to lower therapeutic and prophylactic costs. This concept is concurrent with the critical assessment of the cost effectiveness, safety and usable spectrum of older therapeutic regimens. However, some of the traditional nonpenicillin treatment modalities must be maintained for those patients with a penicillin allergy.\r"

At presentation, pulmonary function tests and pulmonary mechanics were suggestive of pulmonary vascular disease, and she subsequently developed clinical signs of pulmonary hypertension. These noninvasive tests may be useful in the timing of more invasive hemodynamic studies. She initially had myasthenia gravis and then developed polymyositis, profound peripheral neuropathy, and ventilatory muscle failure. She died despite aggressive immunosuppressive therapy and plasmapheresis. Autopsy showed spinal cord changes secondary to a peripheral neuropathy and signs of neurogenic atrophy confined to the ventilatory muscles. Peripheral neuropathy may be an important cause of ventilatory muscle weakness that can be found in MCTD and systemic lupus.\r"

  ".W": "Three methods for projecting the short-term course of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) epidemic are discussed: (a) empirical extrapolation, (b) the method of \"back calculation,\" and (c) projections based on compartmental models. Extrapolation, which requires only data on AIDS incidence, is based on an assumed functional form and on the supposition that previous trends will continue. The method of back calculation incorporates both information on previous AIDS incidence and knowledge about the incubation period distribution. These calculations provide some evidence of how many infections occurred during previous time intervals. Although this information is not precise, particularly for the recent past, it is sufficient to produce stable short-term projections. Compartmental models can be used to project future prevalence of infection as well as future AIDS incidence. However, such projections are very dependent on assumptions about initial numbers of individuals infected, rates of transmission, changes in high-risk behaviors over time, and assumptions about transmission among subpopulations with differing transmission rates and initial prevalence of infection. Thus, compartmental models offer insights into the trends in an epidemic but do not currently provide a practical tool for obtaining quantitative projections. We present projections for various risk groups based on the method of back calculation and discuss the use of additional epidemiologic data to obtain accurate projections a decade in advance.\r"

  ".W": "Sepsis and multiple organ failure are common after hemorrhagic shock. The goal of the current experiments was to determine whether hemorrhagic shock would promote the translocation of bacteria from the gut to visceral organs. Twenty-four hours after being subjected to sham shock, or 30, 60, or 90 minutes of shock (30 mm Hg), rats were sacrificed and their organs quantitatively cultured for translocating bacteria. There was a direct relationship between the duration of hemorrhagic shock and the 24-hour mortality rate (p = 0.02). Bacteria did not translocate from the gut in the sham-shock rats, but did translocate to the mesenteric lymph nodes, livers, and spleens of the rats subjected to hemorrhagic shock (p less than 0.01). Rats subjected to 90 minutes of shock shock exhibited a greater degree of bacterial translocation than rats receiving 30 or 60 minutes of shock (p less than 0.05). The most common translocating bacteria were Escherichia coli and Enterococcus. Hemorrhagic shock injured the gut mucosa and caused subepithelial edema and focal areas of necrosis. Thus hemorrhagic shock followed by reinfusion of shed blood disrupts the gut barrier and allows indigenous bacteria normally contained within the gut to cause systemic infections.\r"

We investigated prospectively the incidence of persistent Proteus mirabilis bacteriuria after extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy among 15 consecutive women with Proteus mirabilis urinary tract infections and struvite calculi. All patients received parenteral gentamicin for 3 to 8 days (mean 4.7 days) immediately before and after extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy. Oral antimicrobials then were administered for 14 to 34 days (mean 25 days). Ten patients have maintained a sterile urine or experienced urinary reinfection by other organisms during 8 to 19 months (mean 13 months) of subsequent bacteriological surveillance. Of these 10 patients 9 had residual fragments. Five patients had Proteus mirabilis bacteriuria after 1 to 7 months of surveillance, including 3 with residual fragments. The mean stone size, methods and duration of renal drainage procedures, and duration of antimicrobial therapy were similar for the 2 patient groups. Proteus mirabilis was isolated from the cultures of only 3 of 11 retrievable stone fragments. In contrast to intact infected renal calculi, residual stone fragments after extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy often are susceptible to sterilization with antimicrobials.\r"

The degree of satisfaction among patients who entered the home injection phase was high. Only 55 patients who dropped out of the trial chose implantation of a penile prosthesis.

A double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial of acetohydroxamic acid was conducted at 12 Veterans Administration spinal cord injury units. A total of 210 male spinal cord injury patients with chronic urea-splitting urinary infection was enrolled for a scheduled followup of 2 years. The study data support the usefulness of acetohydroxamic acid in reducing urinary ammonia. At every followup visit the acetohydroxamic acid patients with stones had decreases in ammonia of 30 to 48 mg. per dh., while the placebo patients had increases in ammonia. Acetohydroxamic acid also retarded stone growth. Patients with stones treated with acetohydroxamic acid exhibited significantly longer intervals from randomization to first stone growth than patients treated with placebo (p less than 0.005, medians 15 versus 9 months). Acetohydroxamic acid reduced significantly the proportion of patients with stone growth at 12 months (33 versus 60 per cent, p equals 0.017). This decrease was diminished at 24 months (42 versus 60 per cent, p equals 0.260). Patient attrition was 31 per cent in the placebo group and 62 per cent in the acetohydroxamic acid group, the latter attrition being primarily owing to patient request because of mild symptoms. Of the acetohydroxamic acid and placebo patients 62 and 29 per cent, respectively, reported drug side effects but all were reversible and no unanticipated or life-threatening reactions occurred.\r"

Elimination of the mucous coat with 0.1 M HCl increased the adherence of crystals six times compared to that in bladders with an intact mucous coat. Infection with Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli, enterococci and Ureaplasma urealyticum increased the adherence six, five, four and two times, respectively.

Overall survival differences were even more striking for those with an EF of 35% or less (p = 0.003, Mantel-Cox).

A mass detected during abdominal, rectal, or vaginal examination was found in 39 patients (70%). Aneurysm size ranged from 2.5 to 18 cm (mean 5.5 cm) for the entire group. Internal iliac aneurysms tended to be larger (7.7 cm) yet demonstrated no increased risk of rupture, which was encountered in 33% of patients. Elective operative management was undertaken in 26 patients with a mortality rate of 11%. When repair had to be performed as an emergency procedure mortality increased to 33%. Aneurysm ligation, resection, or endoaneurysmorrhaphy coupled with graft interposition when necessary did not seem to influence patient survival. Eleven patients treated nonoperatively demonstrated enlargement in three, rupture in one, and progressive ureteral obstruction in one patient. Iliac aneurysms demonstrate expansile growth with eruptive and erosive complications and therefore should be managed aggressively under elective circumstances.\r"

  ".W": "A professional football franchise was studied consecutively from 1960 through 1985 for injuries incurred during regular-season games. A \"significant\" injury was defined as one requiring the player to miss at least two consecutive games (N = 331) and a \"major\" injury as one that caused the player to miss at least eight games or the equivalent time (N = 130). Significant injuries averaged 0.89 per game and major injuries 0.35 per game for the entire 26 years. Following a high injury rate prior to 1965, significant injury rates were episodic. Major injuries declined (rs = -.68; P less than .01). Since the team's first games on synthetic surfaces in 1968, there was no difference in the rates of significant injuries per game (0.57 vs 0.67) or major injuries per game (0.22 vs 0.33) between games played on grass or artificial turf, respectively. Since 1969 there has been a decline in major knee injuries (rs = -.51; P less than .05) and a decline in major injuries incurred during special-teams play (rs = -.55; P less than .05). The data indicate that this team suffered fewer injuries with the passing of time, primarily in injuries that caused a player to miss at least eight consecutive games. Observations of short duration do not lend themselves to current media perception that injury rates are higher and more serious today in professional football.\r"

Thirty patients with chronic fatigue and highly elevated titers of antibody to early antigen (greater than or equal to 1:160) were compared with 30 age- and sex-matched controls with no antibody to early antigen. There were no significant differences noted between patients and controls at the initial evaluation (symptoms, physical examination, laboratory data). Follow-up information, available for 15 matched pairs, showed no differences in outcome between patients and controls. We conclude that the antibody to EBV early antigen is not helpful in the clinical evaluation of patients with chronic fatigue.\r"

Patients were stratified by tumor size and location and by sex, with no significant differences appearing between the two treatment groups. Median follow-up for both groups was 30 months. The preoperative response rate to chemotherapy was 47%. The postoperative complication rate for patients in the operation-only group was 47%; it was 29% for patients receiving chemotherapy. The overall resectability rates were similar for the two groups. Patients responding to chemotherapy preoperatively had significantly prolonged survival (median greater than 20 months) when compared with either nonresponders (median 6.2 months) or patients receiving only operation (median 8.6 months). A highly significant correlation was noted between a weight loss of less than 10% and response to chemotherapy, which suggested that responses occurred in patients with less advanced disease. We conclude that preoperative and postoperative cisplatin, vindesine, and bleomycin chemotherapy has acceptable toxicity and does not increase the incidence of postoperative complications. The natural history of epidermoid carcinoma of the esophagus is altered and overall survival is prolonged for patients responding to preoperative chemotherapy. Potential responding patients can be identified by the degree of preoperative weight loss.\r"

  ".U": "88287553\r", 
  ".W": "Among five patients (69 to 93 years of age) in whom percutaneous transluminal balloon valvuloplasty was performed for severe aortic stenosis, fractures of cuspid calcium were observed in three, fractures and a cuspid tear in one, and no gross alterations in one. Aortic stenosis resulted from degenerative (senile) calcification of tricuspid aortic valves in two patients, calcification of congenitally bicuspid aortic valves in two, and postinflammatory (presumably rheumatic) fibrocalcific disease in one. Fractures of calcific lesions, by allowing hingelike motion along their sites, seemed to facilitate cuspid mobility and thereby provided the apparent morphologic substrate for reduction in functional stenosis. Among three cases with fused commissures (two bicuspid and one postinflammatory), however, mobility of the conjoined cusps was not achieved after valvuloplasty, despite fracture of calcific nodules in the adjacent valve pocket of one case, because the fused and calcified commissures were not split or fractured and therefore continued to act as rigid struts that impeded cuspid motion. In the current autopsy evaluation of the effects of aortic balloon valvuloplasty, greater cuspid mobility seemed to be achieved in subjects with degenerative calcific stenosis than in those with calcified bicuspid valves or distortion by postinflammatory disease.\r"

The primary mediator of this effect, gastric inhibitory polypeptide, may not account for the complete manifestation of this phenomenon. We evaluated other gastroenteric polypeptides with respect to a differential response to oral ingestion of glucose and intravenous administration of glucose at rates that achieved arterial plasma glucose concentrations matched to those from orally administered glucose. Gastrin, peptide histidine methionine, peptide YY, and neurotensin showed increases in plasma concentrations in response to oral ingestion of glucose but not to intravenous administration of glucose. Vasoactive intestinal polypeptide showed no increased concentration in response to either oral or intravenous administration of glucose. The differential responses to orally and intravenously administered glucose noted in the former gastroenteric polypeptides qualifies them as potential mediators of the incretin effect.\r"

Of the five patients with T-cell lymphocytosis, four were best categorized as having T gamma-chronic lymphoproliferative disease and had an indolent clinical course. Of the 132 patients with B-cell lymphocytosis, 121 (92%) had B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL), and 11 (8%) had small cleaved (\"lymphosarcoma\") cell leukemia. Patients with small cleaved cell leukemia had a worse clinical outcome than did those with B-CLL. We further analyzed the surface immunoglobulin (sIg) and CD20 (B-1) antigen expression patterns in B-CLL to determine whether any correlation existed with clinical outcome. A subset of patients with B-CLL in whom sIg was expressed in less than 20% of their lymphocytes had the best clinical outcome. HLA-DR (Ia-like) antigen typing helped identify B-CLL cases with minimal or no sIg expression. CD20 (B-1) antigen was weak or undetectable in most cases of B-CLL. Patients with B-CLL who had CD20 (B-1) in more than 20% of their lymphocytes did not have a different prognosis. Our data provide the incidence and natural history of the various subsets of CLL in a series of patients at a single institution. The type and extent of immunotyping necessary and practical in the clinical management of patients with CLL are explored.\r"

Visual analogue scores also indicated a significant improvement with feverfew. There were no serious side-effects.\r"

A 1-2 antigen match for HLA DR antigens (30.9% vs 4.5% for zero DR match; p less than 0.002), a zero match for HLA A/B antigens (27.5% vs 10.9% for 1 or more A/B match; p less than 0.05), and active CMV infection (26.3% vs 4.4% for no CMV infection; p less than 0.005) were independently associated with an increased risk of VBDS. The coexistence of a 1-2 HLA DR match and CMV infection carried the highest relative risk (10.1) of VBDS; these two variables were probably interdependent since either alone was associated with a low relative risk (0.45 and 0.5). The association between VBDS and active CMV infection was not a consequence of alterations in immunosuppressive therapy. The findings would be consistent with precipitation of chronic rejection by CMV-induced HLA antigen expression in patients rendered susceptible by the donor/recipient HLA antigen match.\r"

After a follow-up of 24 months the fluoride-calcium group showed a significantly lower rate of new vertebral fractures, the main adverse effect of the regimen being a higher incidence of osteoarticular pains in the ankle and foot; the risk of non-vertebral fractures was not increased, and digestive disorders arose with equal frequency in the two groups.

Most angiolipomas occur in teenagers and young adults, and are rarely described in younger children. Angiolipoma generally arises on the extremities or trunk, and it is unusual when found in the head and neck. An angiolipoma of the parotid region was suspected in an infant girl after contrast-enhanced computerized tomographic scan, and was confirmed when the mass was surgically excised. The clinical characteristics, radiological appearance, and histopathology of angiolipoma are discussed.\r"

Using immunofluorescence, the surgically denervated fast-twitch posterior latissimus dorsi (PLD) exhibited a significant increase in spectrin antigen associated with the sarcolemma and within the sarcoplasm compared with the contralateral innervated control muscle. Using gel electrophoresis followed by immunoblotting, we found a two- to three-fold increase in the levels of spectrin in the denervated PLD over that found in the innervated PLD. These levels were comparable to those found previously in slow and dystrophic muscle. The intrafiber distribution of spectrin is similar between the denervated PLD and the slow-tonic anterior latissimus dorsi (ALD). When spectrin was examined in dystrophic PLD muscle, denervation was found to have no effect. These results support our hypothesis that the concentration of spectrin within muscle fibers reflects the physiological state of those fibers. Changes in spectrin concentration may be a useful probe to study the various alterations in physical parameters found among fast, slow, dystrophic, and denervated fibers.\r"

Instead of reviewing this literature exhaustively, we have attempted to propose a model that accommodates the clinical observation that chronic stress early in life in vulnerable persons predisposes them to major depression with contemporary observations of the potential consequences of repeated central nervous system exposure to effectors of the stress response. This model accords with current clinical judgment that major depression is best treated with a combination of psychopharmacologic agents and psychotherapy. Accordingly, whereas psychopharmacologic intervention may be required to resolve an active episode of major depression and to prevent recurrences, psychotherapy may be equally important to lessen the burden of stress imposed by intense inner conflict and counterproductive defenses.\r"

  ".U": "88288396\r", 
  ".W": "The NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) class of glutamate receptor plays a critical role in a variety of forms of synaptic plasticity in the vertebrate central nervous system. One extensively studied example of plasticity is long-term potentiation (LTP), a remarkably long-lasting enhancement of synaptic efficiency induced in the hippocampus by brief, high-frequency stimulation of excitatory synapses. LTP is a strong candidate for a cellular mechanism of learning and memory. The site of LTP induction appears to be the postsynaptic cell and induction requires both activation of NMDA receptors by synaptically released glutamate and depolarization of the postsynaptic membrane. It is proposed that this depolarization relieves a voltage-dependent Mg2+ block of the NMDA receptor channel, resulting in increased calcium influx which is the trigger for the induction of LTP. This model predicts that application of a large depolarizing dose of NMDA should be sufficient to evoke LTP. In agreement with a previous study, we have found that NMDA or glutamate application does potentiate synaptic transmission in the hippocampus. This agonist-induced potentiation is, however, decremental and short-lived, unlike LTP. It is occluded shortly after the induction of LTP and a similar short-term potentiation can be evoked by synaptically released glutamate. We thus propose that LTP has two components, a short-term, decremental component which can be mimicked by NMDA receptor activation, and a long-lasting, non-decremental component which, in addition to requiring activation of NMDA receptors, requires stimulation of presynaptic afferents.\r"

  ".W": "Malaria is initiated by the inoculation of a susceptible host with sporozoites from an infected mosquito. The sporozoites enter hepatocytes and develop for a period as exoerythrocyte or hepatic stage parasites. Vaccination with irradiated sporozoites can provide protective immunity and a recent study shows that this can also be conferred by immunization with a recombinant salmonella expressing only the circumsporozoite protein that normally covers the sporozoites. Protection against infection is likely to be mediated by cytotoxic CD8+ cells, as depletion of CD8+ T cells in a sporozoite-immunized animal can completely abrogate immunity. Here we demonstrate directly the existence of CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) that recognize the circumsporozoite protein. B10.BR mice immunized with sporozoites or with recombinant vaccinia virus expressing the CS protein of Plasmodium falciparum contain CTL that specifically kill L cell fibroblasts transfected with the gene encoding the same CS protein. The peptide epitope from the CS protein that is recognized by CTL from this strain of mice is from a variant region of the protein.\r"

  ".W": "Macrophage activation--enhanced capacity to kill, in a cell that otherwise mostly scavenges--is essential for host survival from infection and contributes to containment of tumours. Both microbes and tumour cells, therefore, may be under pressure to inhibit or reverse the activation of macrophages. This reasoning led to the demonstration of macrophage deactivating factors from both microbes and tumour cells. In some circumstances the host itself probably requires the ability to deactivate macrophages. Macrophages are essential to the healing of wounds and repair of tissues damaged by inflammation. Yet the cytotoxic products of the activated macrophages can damage endothelium, fibroblasts, smooth muscle and parenchymal cells (reviewed in ref. 6). Thus, after an inflammatory site has been sterilized, the impact of macrophage activation on the host might shift from benefit to detriment. These concepts led us to search for macrophage deactivating effects among polypeptide growth factors that regulate angiogenesis, fibrogenesis and other aspects of tissue repair. Among 11 such factors, two proteins that are 71% similar proved to be potent macrophage deactivators: these are transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) and TGF-beta 2.\r"

Evaluation of these cases and review of others previously reported suggests a clinicopathologic correlation between type of cerebellar plaque and neurologic clinical course. CJD patients who showed kuru-like plaques generally had disease with early onset (average age, 49.1 years) and long duration (average, 34 months), as compared with CJD patients without kuru-like plaques. GSSD patients usually had multicentric cerebellar plaques, and cases were usually familial, had early age of onset (average, 42.7 years), and were of long duration (average, 73 months). Myoclonus was infrequent in GSSD patients and pathologically spongiform change was minimal; spinal tract degeneration was common.\r"

Twelve patients were normotolerant (NT) to glucose, five glucose-intolerant (IT), and four diabetic (DM). Insulin secretion of IT patients was increased and delayed during OGTT. Interestingly, the insulin release during arginine load was significantly decreased in NT and IT as well as in DM patients. The GH response to OGTT was altered in IT patients. Plasma glucagon after an arginine load was significantly higher in patients than in controls. The results indicate that FA is associated with insulin resistance, beta-cell deficiency, and type I diabetes. These alterations might be genetically linked or metabolically related to the primary defect in FA. Their interplay or independent effects are responsible for abnormalities of glucose metabolism in FA.\r"

Tarsoconjunctival grafts provide a strong and permanent buttress to correct the scarring of the posterior eyelid margin that characterizes cicatricial entropion. They provide a smooth mucosal surface to interface with the corneal tear film. Depending on the circumstances, we use free ipsilateral, free contralateral, or sliding \"bucket handle\" tarsoconjunctival grafting. Mucosal grafts are rarely needed.

In 12 healthy volunteers, the mean duration of mucosal adherence of Zilactin was 3.92 hours, which was significantly longer than that of a widely available topical preparation (1.38 hours, p = 0.0001). When evaluated in 20 subjects with recurrent aphthous ulcerations, Zilactin demonstrated the ability to significantly decrease ulcer pain over a 4-hour period when compared with the subjects' individual standardized level of initial discomfort, which was used as an internal control for all subsequent steps. Challenge with an irritating citrus beverage was made before and after application of the medication. A significant difference in premedication and postmedication sensitivity was shown (p = 0.0001), indicating that the film provides protection, as well as pain relief. As a result of its unique and tenacious film-forming characteristics, this agent is exceptionally effective in the treatment of oral mucosal ulcerations. Greater awareness on the part of physicians and dentists may lead to the development of additional applications.\r"

The case of a 22-month-old male child with an eosinophilic granuloma of the right mandible is presented. The diagnostic and treatment methods are reviewed and discussed. During the 4 years that the case has been followed there has been progressive healing of the lesion, but other manifestations of the disease process and of the surgical treatment have become evident. The need for close dental as well as medical follow-up in cases involving the dental structures is stressed.\r"

Aerobic microbes, particularly streptococci, are the predominant causative microbes isolated. There was a noticeable absence of obligate anaerobes. This is significant for the selection of an antibiotic for therapy. Treatment parameters were presented. An endodontic cellulitis exacerbation is most unlikely with obligate anaerobes. An endodontic flare-up perspective was attempted with some clinical parameters. The proponents of routine one-visit endodontic treatment with prophylactic drugs to prevent cellulitis exacerbations do not appear to offer any advantage to the more traditional approaches to endodontic treatment of the patient, which may be more beneficial.\r"

The purpose of this study was to identify various subpopulations of T-lymphocytes in these lesions. Fifteen periapical lesions were obtained during periapical surgery. Each specimen was quick-frozen and stored in liquid nitrogen. Immunoperoxidase staining for the presence of T-lymphocyte subpopulation, was done with the use of the monoclonal antibody and Vecta-stain ABC/peroxidase kit. Cryostat tissue sections were incubated with 3% normal horse serum. Specific monoclonal antibody (Coulter T4, T8, T11) was placed on the section, washed, and then covered with biotinylated antibody to mouse IgG. After TRIS HC1 washing, the ABC/peroxidase solution was placed on the section and 3,3-diaminobenzidine was applied; the section was washed and then counterstained with 2% methyl green. After dehydration, sections were mounted and examined under the light microscope. The presence of lymphocytes was confirmed by the appearance of brown rings around cells with lymphocyte morphology. Fourteen lesions were diagnosed as granuloma and stained positively for pan T-lymphocytes (T11), T helper cells (T4), and T cytotoxic cells (T8). The remaining specimen, diagnosed as an apical scar, contained no T-lymphocytes. The presence of T-cells in periapical lesions indicates that cell-mediated reactions participate in the pathogenesis of these lesions.\r"

In this study, eight dental intraoral film alignment instruments (including five replicates of each) were tested for accuracy in repositioning over a period of 6 months. Each instrument was made by adhering one of six impression materials (including acrylics, compounds, and elastics) onto the bite blocks of commercially available alignment instruments. The dimensional accuracy and reproducibility of the orientation of the x-ray source with respect to the object were determined over time for each instrument by measuring the horizontal and vertical angulation change in the position of a buccally placed marker on a dried mandible with a lingually placed film grid. Nine measurements were made during the 6-month test period. The most reproducible instrument was the combination of Regisil, an elastic impression material, and a Rinn XCP bite block. This combination yielded a mean absolute horizontal angulation error of 1.34 degrees +/- 0.63 and a mean absolute vertical angulation error of 2.04 degrees +/- 0.82, yielding a total angulation error of 2.44 degrees +/- 1.16. This was within the acceptable range of accuracy needed to produce diagnostically useful information when digital subtraction radiography is used.\r"

Early orbital assessment must be included to allow surgical decompression of hematoma or fracture reduction before irreversible changes to the visual pathway occur. Clinical assessment and initial, limited plain films offer an invaluable overview to set up priorities in resuscitation and subsequent direction for more detailed assessment by higher-resolution imaging. Complex facial fractures in noncontiguous structures are increasingly noted with high-velocity trauma. Open communication between clinician and radiologist should prevent only partial assessment of the true extent of involvement. Increasing use of CT (and possibly MRI in the near future) to follow persisting post-reduction complications (Fig. 14)--whether altered position of bone grafts or implants, ocular motility disorders and enophthalmos, or sinus obliteration or ablation--has resulted in the further need for the clinician and radiologist to understand each other's capabilities, in order to offer the patient maximum benefit from his or her imaging referral.\r"

The major focus of this paper is on malignancies that develop in immunodeficiency syndromes, particularly malignancies in naturally occurring immunodeficiencies and following bone marrow transplantation (BMT). As of August, 1986, 514 cases of naturally occurring immunodeficiencies have been registered at the Immunodeficiency Cancer Registry. Overall non-Hodgkin's lymphomas predominate in these patients, accounting for 48.6% of all cases. Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is the predominant malignancy in ataxia-telangiectasia, common variable immunodeficiency, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS) and severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID). The histopathology of the lymphomas differs somewhat in each of the disorders. In WAS, large cell \"histiocytic\" lymphoma predominates, with most cases having the features of B lymphocytes, including pleomorphic immunocytoma and immunoblastic lymphoma. Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in SCID also generally has B cell features and in some cases multiple copies of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) genomic DNA have been found in tumor tissue. In contrast to ataxia-telangiectasia, in which non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is also the predominant neoplasm, the morphology and cell marker characteristics are more similar to those seen in nonimmunodeficient children. The lymphomas in ataxia-telangiectasia are very heterogeneous with representation from all the major histologic subtypes. We have found no relationship between the degree of immunodeficiency and the development of malignancy. Immunodeficiency following BMT, as in naturally occurring immunodeficiencies, appears to predispose patients to the development of lymphoid malignancy, especially for recipients of partially mismatched bone marrow. In Minnesota 8 patients have developed B cell lympho-proliferative disorders (BLPD) following BMT.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Throughout the world annual RSV epidemics result in numerous hospitalizations, substantial morbidity and some mortality. Until the recent introduction of ribavirin only supportive therapy has been available for treating these infections. The development of animal models of RSV infection and the observation that some lots of immunoglobulin prepared for intravenous administration contained substantial RSV-neutralization antibody titers, prompted a series of studies examining the safety and efficacy of immunoglobulin prepared for intravenous administration in the prophylaxis and treatment of RSV infections. This discussion will review our published, or soon to be published, studies on the use of Sandoglobulin for both immunoprophylaxis and immunotherapy of RSV infections in cotton rats. It will summarize studies utilizing both parenteral and topical (tracheal) Sandoglobulin therapy for RSV infections in owl monkeys. Finally the results of a small double blind trial of parenteral albumin or Sandoglobulin in the therapy of RSV bronchiolitis and/or pneumonia in hospitalized children will be reviewed. The data show that immunoprophylaxis and immunotherapy of RSV infections in laboratory animals was well-tolerated, was safe and induced highly significant reductions in RSV shedding from the lower respiratory tract. Further, immunotherapy of RSV infections in children was also well-tolerated, induced no short or long term evidence of toxicity or injury and caused significant improvements in oxygenation and reductions in RSV shed from the respiratory tract.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Neonatal GBS infections are often rapidly progressive, suggesting that the immunity to GBS is deficient. Studies have shown that opsonic antibody is required for efficient phagocytosis and killing of GBS, and neonatal GBS infections have been associated with diminished levels of anti-GBS antibody. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) has been shown to provide protective immunity in experimental GBS infection models. However, lot to lot variation in opsonic antibody levels occurs in standard IVIG preparations. Recently hyperimmune anti-GBS IVIG has been prepared with high levels of opsonic and protective antibody to GBS. Hyperimmune IVIG preparations will allow physicians to give higher quantities of specific anti-GBS antibody without having to administer large fluid volumes or large amounts of nonspecific immunoglobulin. In addition specific immunoglobulin preparations will ensure that the IVIG contains reliable antibacterial activity. Although human studies are limited they suggest that IVIG therapy in neonates may be safe and effective in treating neonatal sepsis. However, further studies are necessary to determine the role of IVIG in preventing or treating neonatal infections.\r"

It has not been determined, however, at what level below the normal range the IgG subclass deficiency is of clinical relevance. It remains important to clarify this point because certain subclass deficiencies may be without relevance of their own. Because patients with decreases of various IgG subclasses often present with a number of diseases, the low immunoglobulin levels may signify the presence of other abnormalities of more biologic significance. IgG subclass deficiency has been noted in about 25% of patients with well-defined food allergy and in patients with asthma, diabetes mellitus, Henoch-Schonlein's purpura, Bechterew's disease, intractable epilepsy of childhood, Friedreich's ataxia and autoimmune cytopenias. Most commonly they have increased frequency of infections especially in the respiratory tract, including sinusitis, otitis media and bronchopneumonia, but also osteomyelitis, meningitis, septicemia and various skin infections. Low levels of various subclasses have been noted in connection with other immunodeficiencies such as ataxia-telangiectasia. In common variable immunodeficiency there is an obvious imbalance in the IgG subclasses. Furthermore IgG subclass deficiency can be seen in relatives of patients with common variable immunodeficiency and in IgA deficiency. They also occur in relatives of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus, diabetes mellitus type 1 and C2 deficiency. In a few cases of subclass deficiency gene deletions have been shown. Subnormal levels of IgG subclasses make a remarkable change in sex distribution around puberty from 3/1 in boys and girls to the reverse sex ratio among adults.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "After allogeneic bone marrow transplantation certain patterns of infectious complications emerge that follow the clinical course, are correlated to the immunobiology of transplantation and are almost predictable in their character and expression. The preparative regimen, designed to generate complete aplasia, will be associated with severe and sometimes life-threatening bacterial infections, predominantly with Gram-negative organisms derived from bowel flora, but also Gram-positive skin saprophytes. In this early aplastic phase, life-threatening viral infections are less common, consisting mainly of herpes simplex and possibly Epstein-Barr stomatitis and BK papovavirus cystitis. Systemic infections with invasive filamentous fungi are rare and are seen only when the induced aplasia is markedly prolonged. Once early marrow recovery has been achieved, systemic infections will generally disappear unless acute graft-vs.-host disease develops. This complication, which will lead to the breakdown of natural barriers such as skin and gastrointestinal epithelium and the marked impairment of all systemic defense mechanisms, can cause polymicrobial infections as well as set the stage for life-threatening viral infections. Such opportunistic viral infections, leading to either interstitial pneumonia or hemorrhagic gastroenteritis, are the major threat in the early recovery phase after engraftment has taken place. Usually caused by cytomegalovirus and rotavirus, respectively, these infections are the primary expression of the severe combined immunodeficiency post transplant, statistically associated with the presence of acute graft-vs.-host disease and amenable to immunologic manipulations. With the recovery of cellular and humoral immune function derived from transplanted donor lymphoid cells, the third phase of infectious complications is reached, covering 3 months to 2 years post grafting.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Systemic autoimmune diseases include systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), scleroderma, Sjogren's syndrome and dermato-polymyositis among others. These diseases are characterized by the occurrence of autoantibodies directed against nuclear antigens. Each disease is associated with a distinctive group of autoantibodies which can be used as diagnostic markers or reagents to separate one disease from another. Examples include antibodies to native DNA and to Sm antigen which are distinctive for SLE, antibodies to DNA topoisomerase I, centromere antigens and RNA polymerase I which are distinctive for scleroderma and antibodies to transfer RNA synthetases which are distinctive for dermato-polymyositis. In a sense these can be regarded as immune fingerprints which are characteristic of these disease entities and they have therefore been useful to the clinician as aids to differential diagnosis. Some insight into the nature of systemic autoimmunity has come from studies defining the molecular biology of antigens in SLE and scleroderma. In SLE some of the antigens such as Sm and U1-ribonucleoprotein are assembled as small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles which are involved in splicing of precursor messenger RNA, thus being involved in an important and essential cellular function. In scleroderma it has been shown that antigens such as DNA topo I, centromere and RNA pol I can also be demonstrated to be co-localized in close proximity at a certain point in cell division. These observations are very compelling for the hypothesis that the immunogen(s) in systemic autoimmunity might be intracellular particles composed of assemblies of protein and nucleic acids of various kinds.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Although bacterial infections predominate in patients with hypogammaglobulinemia, patients who do not produce normal amounts of immunoglobulin also have an increased incidence of viral infections. This is particularly true of infections with enteroviruses. Echovirus encephalitis has been a major problem for patients with hypogammaglobulinemia. Neurologic damage, frequently resulting in death, has been common in such patients. Because there is an obligatory extracellular phase in the cell to cell spread of enteroviruses, therapy with immunoglobulin has been attempted. In certain patients intravenous and intrathecal gammaglobulin has temporarily halted progression of the disease, but no patients have been cured by this approach. In this report we detail treatment of three children with X-linked hypogammaglobulinemia who had encephalitis caused by echovirus infections. Despite doses of intravenous immunoglobulin that maintained the patients' IgG levels within the normal range, their condition deteriorated in all cases. Treatment with intraventricular immunoglobulin was then tried. In all three cases cerebrospinal fluid protein levels and cell counts returned to normal after this treatment and the echoviruses can no longer be isolated from the cerebrospinal fluid. Follow-up time has ranged from 18 months to 4 years. Ommaya reservoirs were placed into the lateral ventricle of each patient and concentrated (6%) immunoglobulin (Sandoglobulin) was injected into the reservoir on a daily basis. On Days 1 through 7 of the regimen patients were given 120, 300, 450, 510, 540 and 600 mg of IgG, respectively. Patients then received 300 mg daily for periods ranging from 1 week to 1 month. Cultures of cerebrospinal fluid removed from the reservoir were repeatedly analyzed to determine the need for further treatment. Clinically the patients improved markedly.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Patients who received IgG therapy had earlier return of normal serum IgG levels compared to control patients; however, control patients attained normal IgG levels during the second postburn week. Serum half-lives of IgG following infusions were remarkably short (means, 47 hours for infusions within 3 days of injury and 154 hours for infusions in the third postburn week); Sandoglobulin has been reported to have approximately a 21-day half-life in normal individuals. We also measured the opsonic capacity of postburn serum, using fluorescein-labeled microbes and flow cytometry; we identified postburn opsonic defects with certain of the organisms as late as 15 days postinjury, even though serum IgG levels had normalized. These defects were corrected by the in vitro addition of Sandoglobulin to the incubation mixture.\r"

  ".U": "88289205\r", 
  ".W": "The causative agent of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome is a retrovirus, human T lymphotropic virus type III/lymphadenopathy-associated virus, now known as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Infection of children with HIV results in a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations, ranging from asymptomatic to symptomatic, with the severest disease forms including neurologic deterioration, opportunistic infections and malignancy. This virus infects preferentially T cells bearing the CD4 receptors and also seems to exhibit preference for the central nervous system. The predominant route of infection in children is transplacental, and most affected children are infected at the time of birth. For women who give birth to infants with congenital infection with HIV, the main risk factor is intravenous drug abuse; a smaller percentage of these women acquire the infection via sexual contact and a few are infected via blood transfusions. Estimates for the incidence of transmission of the virus from an infected mother to her offspring vary from about 20 to 70%. Infection in most children and adults is documented by serologic testing, inasmuch as almost all infected people are HIV antibody-positive. Mothers of congenitally affected children are always HIV antibody-positive and also frequently have immune abnormalities. Women who give birth to infected children may, however, be asymptomatic in 50% of instances or more. Because antibodies to HIV are predominantly of the IgG class, they cross the placenta. All infants born to infected women therefore acquire passively transferred antibodies to HIV irrespective of whether or not the infants are infected with the virus itself. These passively transferred antibodies may sometimes persist for as long as 15 months. Thus in infants and children under 15 months of age in the absence of symptoms, the only definitive way to establish diagnosis is by viral isolation or viral antigen detection. Clinically the HIV-infected children can be divided into two groups, symptomatic and asymptomatic. Among the symptomatic group the main diagnostic specific features are: (1) opportunistic infection, e.g. with Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia; (2) interstitial pneumonitis with respiratory distress resulting from lymphocytic interstitial pneumonitis; (3) microcephaly and other neurologic abnormalities; (4) recurrent bacterial infections.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The immunocompromised host was first defined around the host abnormalities and consequent infections that were associated with congenitally acquired deficiencies. Although the impact of the deficiency on the affected child was considerable, the numbers of such children remained small. With the advent of immunosuppressive therapy and cytotoxic regimens for the effective treatment of cancers and autoimmune diseases, an increasingly larger number of children became immunocompromised and thus subject to serious infectious complications. More recently a new population of immunocompromised children have emerged, those infected with the human immunodeficiency virus; over the next several years this group of patients threatens to become the predominant group of \"immunocompromised hosts\" in pediatrics. Regardless of whether the immunodeficiency is a genetically transmitted immunodeficiency or results from cytotoxic therapy or from infection with human immunodeficiency virus, the incidence and pattern of the infections that occur parallel the targets of the immune system that are adversely affected or destroyed. In some cases, this may represent only a single component of the immune system whereas in others, multiple aspects of the immune matrix have been altered or perturbed. Two goals apply to the management of the immunocompromised child: (1) to identify the basis for the immunodeficiency and to develop methods to restore or replenish it; (2) to define the spectrum of infectious complications that can occur in association with the immunocompromised state and to develop regimens to treat or prevent them, at least until the underlying defects can be dealt with in a more definitive manner.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Management of the resulting increased susceptibility to infections may require supplementation of antibiotic therapy with additional forms of treatment, including passive immunization with antibodies. This review discusses the use of immunoglobulin preparations for intravenous administration (IVIG) in patients with secondary immunodeficiencies associated with neoplasia. A suitable model for evaluating the prophylactic effect of IVIG is chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Many observations suggest that IVIG reduces the frequency of acute respiratory infections. Another malignant condition with decreased serum levels of polyclonal immunoglobulins and high frequency of infections is multiple myeloma. A crossover study recently demonstrated that IVIG significantly (P less than 0.01) reduced the frequency of respiratory tract infections in these patients. Furthermore the prophylactic effect of IVIG was evaluated in patients with small cell carcinoma of the lung. In a randomized prospective trial it was noticed that IVIG applied during intensive chemotherapy and irradiation courses significantly (P = 0.04) reduced the frequency of infections. Evidence for a therapeutic effect of IVIG was obtained in adult tumor patients and in children with leukemia or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma who developed severe varicella-zoster virus infections. The treatment effectively controlled fever, skin lesions and neuralgia and prevented progression of the infection. Therapeutic usefulness of IVIG in bacterial infections is still based on anecdotal evidence. Experimental data suggest that in addition to effects mediated by specific antibodies, nonspecific interactions of IgG molecules with Fc-receptors on macrophages may be clinically important.\r"

Most children were in age-appropriate and standard school classes or were only 1 year behind. Cognitive abilities remained unchanged. Children improved in gross motor function and patients' behavior significantly improved according to parents' perceptions. Enuresis was more prevalent, however, than in the population of children who had not received liver transplants. Parental divorce rates were no greater than those reported for other families with chronically ill children. Overall, objective changes in life-style as well as parents' perceptions of behavior of children appear to be improved after liver transplantation.\r"

Impaired cell-mediated immunity may predispose the patient to esophageal mucosal colonization, whereas chemotherapy-induced granulocytopenia may predispose to disseminated candidiasis. Esophageal candidiasis should be suspected in susceptible patients with complaints of substernal odynophagia or dysphagia. The diagnosis is confirmed by endoscopically directed mucosal biopsy. Esophagitis from other causes (eg. herpes simplex virus, cytomegalovirus, or bacterial infection) may develop concomitantly with esophageal candidiasis. Treatment is determined by the clinical and immune status of the patient. Amphotericin B (Fungizone) is administered to immunocompromised patients at risk for disseminated or deeply invasive candidiasis and is indicated in nongranulocytopenic patients whose symptoms prevent reliable administration of oral antifungal agents. Ketoconazole (Nizoral) may be administered to clinically stable nongranulocytopenic patients with esophageal candidiasis limited to the mucosa. Patients with AIDS and a history of esophageal candidiasis usually benefit from long-term suppression with an oral antifungal agent.\r"

  ".W": "The rat neu oncogene encodes a cell surface glycoprotein, p185, that possesses tyrosine kinase activity. The p185 polypeptide exhibits structural similarity to the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) at both the deduced amino acid and nucleic acid level. However, the neu oncogene and the gene encoding the EGFR have been shown to reside on distinct chromosomes. Comparative analysis of the sequences of the normal neu cDNA and of the neu cDNA from neuroblastomas has revealed a single point mutation leading to a valine-to-glutamic acid substitution in the transmembrane anchoring domain. This mutation converts the neu gene to a transforming gene in rodents. In humans, the gene is called ERBB2 (also NGL and HER2), and amplification and over-expression of its products have been detected in certain tumors. The rat embryonal fibroblast cell line (Rat-1) appears to express both EGFR and cellular p185 polypeptides. We have found that EGF stimulates the phosphorylation of p185 in these cells at tyrosine as well as serine and threonine residues in a specific and dose-dependent manner. This activity occurs even though radiolabeled EGF cannot bind to immunopurified p185. The EGF effect is apparently unique since platelet-derived growth factor, insulin, and transforming growth factor beta all fail to phosphorylate p185 at tyrosine. The EGF-induced effect requires interaction of the EGFR and its cognate ligand because cell lines that lack EGFR cannot be shown to phosphorylate p185, even when exposed to large amounts of EGF. Oncogenic rodent p185 and the human p185 homologue ERBB2 that is overexpressed in human breast tumor cells also can be shown to become phosphorylated on tyrosine residues by the action of EGF. Collectively, these data demonstrate that EGF mediates phosphorylation of p185 at tyrosine as well as serine/threonine through cellular kinases by a receptor-specific mechanism.\r"

The biochemical consequences of this mutation were studied by examining phosphorylation of the normal and transforming p185 molecules in membrane preparations. Here we show that the transforming p185 is phosphorylated to a much higher extent in vitro than its normal counterpart. This preferential phosphorylation has the properties that would be expected of p185 autophosphorylation: it takes place on tyrosine and requires intact p185 kinase activity. The normal p185 protein does not demonstrate increased phosphorylation even when it coexists in a transformed cell with the transforming p185 protein. These data show that transforming p185 is specifically associated with an active tyrosine kinase activity and suggest that this activity is intrinsic to the transforming protein. Thus, the transmembrane domain of p185 appears to directly regulate its kinase activity.\r"

Using the technique of photofootprinting in vivo, we previously documented equivalent transcription-dependent footprints within the putative \"TATA\" elements of both genes. To explore the functional significance of these observations, we created a 3-base-pair substitution mutation within the GAL1 promoter TATA element, which disrupted the ATATAA consensus sequence but left intact the photomodification targets. The mutation reduced galactose-induced RNA levels by a factor of 100. The mutant promoter no longer displayed the characteristic TATA sequence footprint, supporting the hypothesis that transcription activation involves the binding of a TATA box factor. We also observed a collection of transcription-correlated alterations in the modification pattern at sites between the UASG and the GAL1 TATA element, within sequences that are not required for inducible transcription. These patterns, characteristic of the induced wild-type GAL1 gene, were still galactose inducible with the TATA mutant GAl1 promoter, despite the low level of transcription from this promoter. We conclude that the GAL4-dependent protein/DNA structure responsible for the altered pattern within nonessential sequences is therefore not strictly coupled to an active TATA element or to high levels of expression. Nonetheless, the patterns probably reflect a stable protein-dependent structure that accompanies assembly of the transcription initiation complex.\r"

  ".U": "88289737\r", 
  ".W": "The araCBAD regulatory region of Escherichia coli contains two divergently oriented promoters and three sites to which AraC, the regulatory protein of the operon, can bind. This paper presents the results of in vivo dimethyl sulfate \"footprinting\" experiments to monitor occupancy of the three AraC sites and measurements of activity of the two promoters. These measurements were made both in the absence of the inducer arabinose and at various times after arabinose addition to growing cells containing the wild-type ara regulatory region or the regulatory region containing various deletions and point mutations. The data lead to the conclusion that two different DNA loops can form in the ara regulatory region. These loops are generated by AraC protein molecules binding to two different DNA sites and binding to each other. One of these loops predominates in the absence of arabinose and plays a major role in repressing activity of one of the promoters. Upon the addition of arabinose the amount of the first loop type, the repression loop, decreases and the amount of a second loop increases. Formation of this second loop precludes the counterproductive formation of the repression loop.\r"

  ".W": "The gene encoding the human erythrocyte glucose transporter, cloned from HepG2 hepatoma cells, was expressed in Escherichia coli by introducing a prokaryote-type ribosome binding site, subcloning the gene into the T7 promoter/T7 polymerase expression system, and transforming a strain that is defective in glucose transport. Cells bearing plasmids with the transporter gene take up 2-deoxy-D-glucose and D-glucose, unlike cells bearing plasmids without the transporter gene. Moreover, 2-deoxy-D-glucose uptake is inhibited by unlabeled D-glucose, cytochalasin B, or mercuric chloride but not by L-glucose. The glucose transport protein is inserted into the membrane of E. coli, as evidenced by immunoblotting experiments with two site-directed polyclonal antibodies, one directed against the COOH terminus of the glucose transporter and the other directed against a synthetic peptide containing amino acid residues 225-238. As detected with both antibodies, the protein migrates with apparent molecular mass of 34 kDa in sodium dodecyl sulfate/12% polyacrylamide, a size similar to that of the unglycosylated glucose-transport protein synthesized in vitro.\r"

  ".W": "The somatostatin-28 convertase activity involved in vitro in the processing of somatostatin-28 into the neuropeptides somatostatin-28-(1-12) and somatostatin-14 is composed of an endoprotease and a basic aminopeptidase. We report herein on the purification to apparent homogeneity of these two constituents and on their functional interrelationship. In particular we observed that after various physicochemical treatments, the 90-kDa endoprotease activity was recovered both at this molecular mass and as a 45-kDa entity. Moreover, the production of [Arg-2,Lys-1]somatostatin-14 from somatostatin-28 by the action of the endoprotease was activated in a cooperative manner by the aminopeptidase B-like enzyme. A 10-fold activation occurred when the exopeptidase was inhibited by 6.5 mM diisopropyl fluorophosphate and allowed the determination of a half-maximal activation constant (K1/2) of approximately equal to 13 nM. These observations strongly suggest that both enzymes act in a concerted manner in vitro and that they may form a complex in vivo.\r"

  ".W": "The mechanism underlying the ability of insulin to acutely activate acetyl-CoA carboxylase [acetyl-CoA: carbon-dioxide ligase (ADP-forming), EC 6.4.1.2; AcCoA-Case] has been examined in Fao Reuber hepatoma cells. Insulin promotes the rapid activation of AcCoACase, as measured in cell lysates, and this stimulation persists to the same degree after isolation of AcCoACase by avidin-Sepharose chromatography. The insulin-stimulated enzyme, as compared with control enzyme, exhibits an increase in both citrate-independent and -dependent activity and a decrease in the Ka for citrate. Direct examination of the phosphorylation state of isolated 32P-labeled AcCoACase after insulin exposure reveals a marked decrease in total enzyme phosphorylation coincident with activation. The dephosphorylation due to insulin appears to be restricted to the phosphorylation sites previously shown to regulate AcCoACase activity. All of these effects of insulin are mimicked by a low molecular weight autocrine factor, tentatively identified as an oligosaccharide, present in conditioned medium of hepatoma cells. These data suggest that insulin may activate AcCoACase by inhibiting the activity of protein kinase(s) or stimulating the activity of protein phosphatase(s) that control the phosphorylation state of the enzyme.\r"

This family of H+-ATPases is distinct from the two other families of H+-ATPases, the plasma membrane-type and the eubacterial-type. One of the subunits of the vacuolar H+-ATPase binds N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCCD) and has been implicated in the proton-conducting activity of these enzymes. We have cloned and sequenced the gene encoding the DCCD-binding protein (proteolipid) of the H+-ATPase of bovine chromaffin granules. The gene encodes a highly hydrophobic protein of 15,849 Da. Hydropathy plots revealed four transmembrane segments, one of which contains a glutamic residue that is the likely candidate for the DCCD binding site. Sequence homology with the vacuolar proteolipid and with the proteolipids of eubacterial-type H+-ATPases was detected. The proteolipids from Escherichia coli, spinach chloroplasts, and yeast mitochondria matched better to the NH2-terminal part of the vacuolar protein. The proteolipids of bovine mitochondria and Neurospora mitochondria matched better to the COOH-terminal end of the vacuolar proteolipid. These findings suggest that the proteolipids of the vacuolar H+-ATPases were evolved in parallel with the eubacterial proteolipid, from a common ancestral gene that underwent gene duplication.\r"

We have isolated a full-length cDNA clone encoding CAD, as a molecular marker specific for lignification, by immunoscreening a lambda gt11 library containing cDNAs complementary to mRNA from elicitor-treated cell cultures of bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.). The clone comprises a single long open reading frame of 1767 base pairs, 31 base pairs of 5' leader, and 152 base pairs of 3' untranslated sequence. The deduced 65-kDa CAD polypeptide has several features that are strongly conserved in alcohol dehydrogenases. Addition of fungal elicitor to cell cultures stimulates CAD transcription, which leads to a remarkably rapid, but transient, accumulation of CAD mRNA, with no detectable lag and maximal levels after 1.5 hr. Southern blot analysis of bean genomic DNA indicates that elicitor-induced CAD is encoded by a single gene. The regulatory significance of the rapid activation of this CAD gene and the possible existence of a second, divergent CAD gene involved in lignification during xylogenesis are discussed.\r"

One situation that is known to trigger premature terminal differentiation is suspension culture, when keratinocytes are deprived of substratum and intercellular contact. We have now investigated whether area of substratum contact, and hence cell shape, can regulate terminal differentiation. Keratinocytes were grown on circular adhesive islands that prevented cell-cell contact. By varying island area we could vary cell shape from fully spread to almost spherical. We found that when substratum contact was restricted, DNA synthesis was inhibited and expression of involucrin, a marker of terminal differentiation, was stimulated. Inhibition of proliferation was not a sufficient stimulus for involucrin synthesis in fully spread cells. When DNA synthesis and involucrin expression were plotted against contact area, classic dose-response curves were obtained. Thus cell shape acts as a signal for the terminal differentiation of keratinocytes in culture.\r"

This downstream open reading frame was identified as herC, a gene defined by a suppressor mutation that restores replication of a ColE1 plasmid mutant. RNA blot hybridization and S1 nuclease protection analyses of in vivo transcripts showed that prfB and herC are cotranscribed into a 2800-base transcript in the counterclockwise direction with respect to the E. coli genetic map. Thus, we refer to the two genes as the prfB-herC operon. Data are presented that suggest that supK, a mutation in Salmonella typhimurium that suppresses UGA termination, is the structural gene for Salmonella release factor 2. Translation control within the prfB-herC operon and the relationship of these genes to a tRNA methyltransferase are discussed.\r"

The bacterial M-protein DNA sequence is stable within this genetic context and is actively transcribed by viral RNA polymerase. Furthermore, high levels of immunoreactive M protein were detected in vivo when the VV:M6 delta recombinant was used to infect mammalian cells in culture. Thus, in addition to providing a powerful approach for dissecting the immunodominant domains of the M protein, the VV:M6 delta recombinant appears to be an excellent candidate vaccine for animal trials.\r"

  ".W": "Although the proteinase inhibitor alpha-2-antiplasmin (alpha 2AP) is known to control the activity of plasmin through rapid formation of stable complexes, it also efficiently inactivates chymotrypsin. These interactions are shown to occur at adjacent, overlapping sites so that plasmin attacks the inhibitor at an Arg364-Met365 peptide bond, while chymotrypsin interacts at a Met365-Ser366 sequence one residue downstream. Thus, a naturally occurring plasma serine proteinase inhibitor can have multiple specificities through interactions at adjacent sites. It also illustrates the potential flexibility of the reactive site loop in this class of inhibitors.\r"

The potential contributions to gene regulation from one such structure have been investigated by assembling a promoter capable of adopting cruciform base-pairing.

Transcription in vivo was induced as supercoiling was relaxed by growth in conditions that inhibit DNA gyrase. A DNA conformational change is therefore capable of regulating the initiation of transcription.\r"

Moreover, no estrogen receptor could be detected in these cells, indicating that pS2 gene expression is estrogen-independent in the stomach. The function of the pS2 protein in the gastrointestinal tract is unknown. However, the pS2 protein is similar in sequence to a porcine pancreatic protein that has been shown to inhibit gastrointestinal motility and gastric secretion.\r"

Macrophages have been reported to express a wide range of mitogenic factors and cytokines, but none of these factors has been shown in vivo to sustain all the wound-healing processes. It has been suggested that transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-alpha) may mediate angiogenesis, epidermal regrowth, and formation of granulation tissue in vivo. Macrophages isolated from a wound site, and not exposed to cell culture conditions, expressed messenger RNA transcripts for TGF-alpha, TGF-beta, platelet-derived growth factor A-chain, and insulin-like growth factor-1. The expression of these transcripts was determined by a novel method for RNA analysis in which low numbers of mouse macrophages were isolated from wound cylinders, their RNA was purified and reverse-transcribed, and the complementary DNA was amplified in a polymerase chain reaction primed with growth factor sequence-specific primers. This single-cell RNA phenotyping procedure is rapid and has the potential for quantification, and mRNA transcripts from a single cell or a few cells can be unambiguously demonstrated, with the simultaneous analysis of several mRNA species. Macrophages from wounds expressed TGF-alpha antigen, and wound fluids contained TGF-alpha. Elicited macrophages in culture also expressed TGF-alpha transcripts and polypeptide in a time-dependent manner after stimulation with modified low-density lipoproteins and lipopolysaccharide endotoxin, which are characteristic of the activators found in injured tissues.\r"

  ".W": "Carotid arteriography can be misleading in that roentgenographic occlusion of the internal carotid artery (ICA) may be suggested when the artery is actually anatomically patent. The distinction of occlusion versus pseudo-occlusion is crucial in recommending proper treatment. Aroused by the misinterpretation of two arteriograms by our radiology departments, a review of 780 arteriograms done on 780 patients during a three year period was begun. Of these, eight (1.0 per cent) symptomatic patients had conflicting arteriographic reports, with the radiologists reporting complete occlusion and the authors describing pseudo-occlusion. Established arteriographic criteria for pseudo-occlusion of the ICA are emphasized. These eight patients underwent carotid arterial exploration and all were found to have patent ICA. After successful carotid endarterectomy, seven of the eight patients have remained asymptomatic and have had no hemodynamically significant stenosis on noninvasive testing in the follow-up period, ranging from two to 38 months. Therefore, in evaluating patients with carotid territory symptoms, knowledge of the established arteriographic criteria for ICA pseudo-occlusion should alert the physician to the possibility of ICA patency. If this is suspected, the patient should undergo exploration of the carotid artery with subsequent endarterectomy if patency is demonstrated.\r"

Diagnosis may be further complicated by a false-negative Mantoux test (purified protein derivative skin test) and lack of evidence of tuberculosis elsewhere in the patient. Adequate treatment consists of appropriate chemotherapeutic agents and the judicious use of surgical resection. Given appropriate treatment, the outcome in most patients should be favorable.\r"

Patients with preoperative Doppler and angiographic studies consistent with arterial occlusions subsequently underwent a thromboembolectomy using a Fogarty catheter. All patients were given a bolus injection of 5,000 units of heparin intravenously at the start of the surgical procedure. In all patients studied, a clot was retrieved on the first pass, but after two additional passes, total distal blood flow was not shown to be restored on angiogram. Intraoperative angiograms showed distal emboli. All patients underwent intraoperative fibrinolytic therapy by local bolus infusion. Streptokinase, ranging from 50,000 to 200,000 units, was administered in 50,000 unit injections in ten to 15 minute intervals. Repeat attempts at thromboembolectomy with the Fogarty catheter resulted in an additional clot retrieved in all 19 patients with intraoperative angiographic, Doppler and clinical improvement. No perioperative or postoperative complications were observed, including anaphylactic reactions, uncontrollable bleeding or amputation. Four patients had nonacute femoropopliteal bypass operations within the next six months. Intraoperative fibrinolytic therapy can be a safe and effective adjunct in acute arterial embolic occlusion requiring balloon catheter thromboembolectomy.\r"

The present studies have used an established in vitro model for pulmonary cell injury to examine bacterial endotoxin 1, as a direct cytotoxic agent on the two major alveolar cell types, pulmonary endothelium and epithelium; 2, as a stimulant of neutrophil-mediated pulmonary cell injury, and 3, to examine effector mechanisms of cell-mediated damage by studying the potential effectiveness of antioxidants and antiproteolytic agents in the inhibition of this process. Endotoxin direct toxicity and stimulation of neutrophil-mediated pulmonary cell injury was observed in both pulmonary cell populations in systems free of activated serum complement. Endothelial cells were observed to be more susceptible to both the direct effect of endotoxin and to neutrophil-mediated injury when compared with epithelial cell derived monolayers. The addition of an antiprotease (soybean trypsin inhibitor [STI]) was superior to antioxidants (catalase, superoxide dismutase) in reducing the neutrophil-mediated endothelial toxicity (stimulated 51CR per cent release) observed. A 92 per cent degree of protection was observed with the highest dose of STI (5 milligrams per milliliter) used. Proteases released by activated neutrophils on endotoxin stimulation appear to be the predominant toxic species responsible for endothelial injury in this system.\r"

Growth fractions in samples from five meningioma patients not treated with MPA were determined for comparison. In the three cases of two-stage operation of the tumors, the percentage of Ki-67-positive cells in meningioma tissue was lower by a factor of 6, 5, and 3, respectively, after MPA therapy. In meningioma specimens from patients receiving no MPA therapy, Ki-67-positive cells were present in 1.02 +/- 0.48%; in samples from MPA-treated tumors the percentage of Ki-67-positive cells was 0.41 +/- 0.40 (different at p less than 0.02 [Wilcoxon's test]). In comparison to our previously published data on untreated meningiomas analyzed for progesterone receptors (PR), MPA significantly reduced the PR activity. There was no obvious correlation between PR activity and potential suppression of the tumor growth fraction. It is concluded that MPA is attractive because it reduces the growth fractions of most meningiomas and might be suitable for adjuvant hormonotherapy.\r"

  ".W": "Pancreatic polypeptide (PP) deficiency has been associated with impaired hepatic sensitivity to insulin and pancreatogenic diabetes in chronic pancreatitis. Since pancreatic resection might also result in PP deficiency, hepatic responses to insulin infusion (0.25 mU/kg/min) were determined by the euglycemic glucose clamp technique in 10 patients who had previously undergone pancreatic resection for trauma and in eight healthy control subjects. Six resection patients (RES-PP) demonstrated deficient PP levels, with a mean increase of plasma immunoreactive PP of 20 +/- 7 pg/ml above basal rate after a test meal compared with 232 +/- 82 pg/ml in control subjects (p less than 0.01) and 353 +/- 133 pg/ml in four other patients undergoing resection with normal levels of immunoreactive PP (RES + PP) (p less than 0.03). Three identical insulin infusion studies were performed in each subject, the second of which was performed during the final 2 hours of an 8-hour infusion of bovine PP (2.0 pmol/kg/min). Whereas hepatic glucose production (HGP) in control subjects fell 74% +/- 4% from a basal rate of 2.0 +/- 0.1 mg/kg/min to a 60- to 120-minute value of 0.5 +/- 0.1 mg/kg/min during insulin infusion, HGP was suppressed only 58% +/- 5% in RES-PP subjects, from 1.9 +/- 0.1 to 0.8 +/- 0.1 mg/kg/min (p less than 0.05 vs controls). Intravenous infusion of PP corrected the hepatic resistance to insulin seen in the PP-deficient group. During PP infusion, HGP was suppressed 74% +/- 5% in RES-PP subjects, from 2.1 +/- 0.2 to 0.5 +/- 0.1 mg/kg/min (p less than 0.04 compared with initial study). PP infusion produced no significant change in glucose metabolism in control and RES + PP subjects. Overall glucose disposal rates were not altered by PP infusion in any group. These findings support a role of PP as a glucoregulatory hormone and suggest that PP deficiency may serve as a reversible pathophysiologic factor in the abnormal glucose metabolism seen after pancreatic resection.\r"

In vivo phosphorus-31 nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy was used to monitor the response of tumor or brain high-energy phosphate compounds to insulin hypoglycemia, rhodamine 123, or both agents in fasting rats with subcutaneous methylcholanthrene-induced sarcomas. Insulin or rhodamine 123 alone produced a similar 50% to 60% reduction in tumor adenosine triphosphate (ATP) concentration compared with controls injected with saline solution (p less than 0.05, one-way analysis of variance [ANOVA]). The combination of insulin plus rhodamine 123 resulted in a 90% reduction of tumor ATP concentration, which was significantly different from the effect of either agent alone (p less than 0.05, one-way ANOVA). Brain phosphocreatine and ATP concentrations were unchanged by these agents. Administration of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)/glycerol, the vehicle for rhodamine, produced a 35% reduction of tumor ATP, which was similar to the effect of insulin alone but significantly different from rhodamine. The combination of DMSO/glycerol plus insulin hypoglycemia resulted in a 70% reduction in tumor ATP, which was significantly elevated compared with the combination of rhodamine plus insulin. Glucose deprivation induced by insulin, and combined with the inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation, produces an additive depression of tumor energetics. The drug vehicle DMSO/glycerol significantly depresses tumor energy metabolism, presumably because of its DMSO component, which may explain the previously reported antineoplastic efficacy of this solvent. Combinations of inhibitors directed at different points of tumor metabolism produced an enhanced depression of tumor energetics, whereas host tissue was protected.\r"

A single UV-DL pretreatment on day -3 or -7 (before transplantation) significantly prolonged survival of heart allografts from Wistar-Furth rats (W/F) in Lewis recipients from 6.8 +/- 0.8 days to 18.4 +/- 2.1 and 17.6 +/- 1.5 days (p less than 0.001), respectively. Multiple UV-DL infusions on days -14 and -7 increased the mean survival time to 20.0 +/- 0.9 days (p less than 0.001). Similarly, UV-DL infusion on day -3 or -7 significantly prolonged the mean survival time of heart allografts from ACI rats in Lewis rats. A single or multiple UV-DL infusions combined with peritransplant CyA led specifically to permanent W/F cardiac allograft survival (more than 200 days) in all recipients. Similarly, UV-DL infusion combined with peritransplant CyA led to indefinite survival of ACI cardiac allografts in two thirds of Lewis recipients. Adoptive transfer of splenocytes from long-term recipients of cardiac allografts, which specifically prolonged donor test grafts in syngeneic hosts, suggests that unresponsiveness to cardiac allografts is, in part, dependent on suppressor cells. This study emphasizes the importance of UV irradiation of DLs in the modulation of alloreactivity and the induction of donor-specific unresponsiveness in adult animals.\r"

  ".W": "Diets high in n-3 fatty acids appear to have an anti-inflammatory effect, which is thought to be due to decreased macrophage prostaglandin (PG) and thromboxane (Tx) production after incorporation of these fatty acids into cell membrane phospholipids. The effect of n-3 fatty acids incorporation on macrophage monokine release in response to septic stimuli is not well established. Kupffer cells, the fixed macrophages of the liver, were obtained from rats fed diets with fat sources derived from corn oil (CO, control), fish oil (FO, high in n-3 fatty acids), or safflower oil (SO, high in n-6 fatty acids) for 2 or 6 weeks. After exposure to bacterial lipopolysaccharide, Kupffer cells from rats fed FO for 2 or 6 weeks produced less PG and Tx than Kupffer cells from rats fed CO or SO. After 2 weeks of defined diets, interleukin-1 (IL-1) and tumor necrosis factor release were not affected by dietary fat source. In contrast, after 6 weeks of feeding, Kupffer cells from both the FO and the SO groups released less IL-1 and tumor necrosis factor when triggered by lipopolysaccharide than Kupffer's cells from animals fed the control diet that contained CO. These data suggest that altered monokine release from macrophages may contribute to the anti-inflammatory effect of diets high in n-3 fatty acids. Also shown in our results is that prolonged changes in membrane phospholipid content induced by dietary fat source can influence not only PG and Tx production but monokine release as well.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of intraperitoneal infection on small-bowel flora and on systemic immunity was studied in a rat model, with use of the delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) response to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) as a measure of global immunologic integrity. Twenty-four hours after the induction of peritonitis by cecal ligation and puncture, concentrations of Escherichia coli in the proximal gastrointestinal tract increased from fewer than 10(3) colony-forming units (CFU)/ml to more than 10(9) CFU/ml, and the DTH response decreased from 10.0 +/- 0.2 to 2.1 +/- 0.4 mm. To assess the contribution of this altered luminal flora to the observed suppression of DTH scores, cecal ligation without puncture was performed in a group of animals whose endogenous flora had been suppressed by administration of oral neomycin. Oral administration of live antibiotic-resistant E. coli to the study animals resulted in significant DTH depression compared with controls given saline solution (2.7 +/- 0.4 vs 4.4 +/- 0.4 mm, p less than 0.005), even though the gastrointestinal tract was anatomically intact. Similar depression was seen if the challenge was limited to the small bowel as a result of the prior performance of an ileostomy and occurred in the absence of significant systemic or portal levels of viable bacteria. The results suggest that gut endotoxin plays a role in the immunosuppression associated with peritonitis.\r"

In all NUNK cases, the 1-year patient survival rate (PSR) and graft survival rate (GSR) were 90% and 39%. Since November 1984, 1-year PSR and GSR for 62 NUNK recipients of pancreas transplants alone (PTA) were 93% and 48%, compared to 89% and 37% for 28 pancreas transplants after (PAK) and 89% and 73% for 20 simultaneous (SPK) with a kidney transplant. The 1-year GSR for 1984-88 technically successful (TS) PTA cases (n = 47) was 63%, versus 75% for PAK (n = 13) and 86% for SPK (n = 17) cases. The 1-year GSRs, by technique and source for 1984-88 PTA cases, were 58% for bladder-drained cadaver (n = 30), 51% for enteric-drained related (n = 32), and 29% for enteric-drained cadaver (n = 17) donor transplants, and 75% (n = 24), 77% (n = 16), and 38% (n = 13) for the corresponding TS cases. Of NUNK recipients, 35 have had grafts function for more than 1 year and all but 3 were treated with cyclosporine (CsA). In the CsA-treated recipients, serum creatinine increased and creatinine clearances decreased by a magnitude of 40% during the first 6 months but thereafter remained stable in all but 2 patients. In the patients with functioning grafts studied at 1 year, retinopathy remained stable in 59% and progressed in 41% of the eyes (n = 39). Motor nerve conduction velocities were significantly increased and muscle action potentials remained stable in 24 patients with functioning grafts studied at 1 year, while in 14 patients in whom transplants failed there was a significant decrease in evoked muscle action potentials. A sustained euglycemic, insulin-independent state can be established in nonuremic, nonkidney diabetic recipients of pancreas transplants alone, with a beneficial effect on neuropathy, lack of an immediate benefit on advanced retinopathy, and an effect on nephropathy compounded by the influence of CsA on renal function.\r"

A significant difference between the groups was noted in both the hemodynamic and clinical manifestations. All 12 Group 1 patients compensated for the increased demand for blood of the right arm through the innominate artery itself, and only one showed symptoms of vertebrobasilar insufficiency associated with right arm exercise. In all eight Group 2 patients, compensation through the innominate artery failed; six (75%) showed symptoms of vertebrobasilar insufficiency after exercise. Dynamic duplex scanning is well suited to investigate stenotic lesions of the innominate artery, the effects of arm exercise on the development of cerebral symptoms, and the source of blood flow to the arm. Dynamic duplex scanning proved to be useful in selecting patients who may be candidates for direct arterial surgery.\r"

No sign of residual dissection of the common carotid arteries was seen in 23 patients; in nine there was a dissection of both common carotid arteries, and seven patients had a unilateral carotid dissection (five right, two left). There were nine symptomatic patients with the following symptoms: transient ischemic attack (four), amaurosis fugax (four), stroke with incomplete recovery (one). Two symptomatic patients had a corresponding dissection. The generally good prognosis of all these patients suggests a conservative nonoperative treatment.\r"

In an attempt to clarify this issue we retrospectively evaluated 35 patients with the presenting diagnosis of rejection for the correlation of comparable radionuclide (RN) and ultrasound (US) examinations with biopsy findings. In 21 patients with heavy interstitial mononuclear cell infiltration, 22 of 23 serial RN studies within forty-eight hours of biopsy were positive for rejection. Only 3 of 14 comparable US studies were positive for rejection. When examinations performed within approximately fourteen days were evaluated, 7 of 11 RN studies were positive for rejection, while 2 of 9 comparable US studies were positive for rejection. However, in 14 patients with mild or no interstitial cellular infiltration, only 6 of 13 RN studies were positive, while all 4 US examinations were negative. In the group evaluated at approximately two weeks, 2 of 6 RN studies were positive, while 0 of 5 US studies were positive. We conclude that the serial RN study is more sensitive than US examination for the diagnosis of acute rejection. US, however, proved valuable in the identification of transplant complications (i.e., fluid collections, ascites, and hydronephrosis).\r"

Therefore the long-term efficacy of oral pirmenol in suppressing ventricular premature depolarizations (VPDs) was assessed in an open-label, dose-titration study. Twelve patients (eight men and four women; mean age 57 +/- 12 years) were treated for 24 to 36 months (mean 33 +/- 4). Seven had structural heart disease (three valvular heart disease, two ischemic heart disease, and two hypertensive heart disease) and five did not. The mean left ventricular ejection fraction was 0.63 +/- 0.13. Exclusion criteria included less than 30 VPDs/hr, greater than 15 beats of ventricular tachycardia (VT), or prior failure of more than two antiarrhythmic drugs. Drug efficacy was assessed by 24-hour ambulatory ECG monitoring performed every 3 months during the first year, every 4 months during the second year, and at 6-month intervals during the third year. The mean hourly frequency of VPDs during the placebo phase was 732 +/- 608. Seven patients (58%) were treated successfully with effective (greater than 75%) long-term suppression of VPDs. Two patients (17%) had a partial response with effective suppression of VPDs for the first 16 months and 5 months of treatment, respectively. Three patients failed to show consistent suppression of VPDs while receiving pirmenol. The daily dose of pirmenol ranged from 200 to 500 mg (mean 317 +/- 94 mg at the beginning of the study and 375 +/- 97 mg at the end). No proarrhythmic effects were identified during long-term treatment, and none of the patients withdrew from the study prematurely.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Holter monitoring for 24 hours showed a significant decrease in the frequency of ventricular premature beats: in the Neoton-treated group the total number of ventricular premature beats for 24 hours was 690 +/- 179 vs 2468 +/- 737 in the control group (p less than 0.02). During this period of time the number of ventricular tachycardia paroxysms was 6 +/- 2 in the treated group and 97 +/- 35 in the control group (p less than 0.01). No side effects or complications were found after administration of phosphocreatine.

  ".W": "To determine whether the association of nicardipine with propranolol had additive effects on myocardial metabolism, 16 patients with angina pectoris were studied invasively before and after 1 month of therapy with a combination of nicardipine and propranolol and compared to a group of 42 patients treated with nicardipine (n = 17) or propranolol (n = 25) alone. When data were compared at a fixed heart rate (atrial pacing), mean blood pressure was reduced with combined treatment from 96 +/- 19 to 76 +/- 13 mm Hg (p less than 0.003). Myocardial oxygen uptake and coronary sinus flow decreased significantly from 20 +/- 9 to 14 +/- 6 ml/min (p less than 0.015) and from 152 to 111 ml/min (p less than 0.05), respectively. The arterio-coronary sinus difference in oxygen content also decreased (13.3 to 12.5 ml/dl; p less than 0.0025), suggesting an improved balance between oxygen supply and demand. Such changes in coronary blood flow and myocardial oxygen uptake were not observed in the group of patients assigned to monotherapy. Lactate uptake rose and the abnormal glutamine production, which worsened with propranolol monotherapy, improved with nicardipine and propranolol (-2.0 to -1.4 mumol/min; p less than 0.05 vs propranolol). The superiority of nicardipine and propranolol over propranolol monotherapy was maintained during a pacing stress test. Thus the combination of nicardipine with a beta blocker had greater oxygen-sparing effects and restored aerobic metabolism better than either drug alone, allowing optimal use of the coronary reserve.\r"

It has been suggested that this functional impairment could be the result of an alteration in LV filling caused by a reduction in LV compliance induced by the rearrangement of biventricular geometry that occurs under these conditions. Therefore, to evaluate the effects of an acute increase or decrease in ITP on LV geometry and filling, we used two-dimensional and Doppler echocardiography to study 25 normal volunteers both during the Muller maneuver (acute decrease in ITP induced by a forced inspiration against a closed airway) and during continuous positive airway pressure breathing. During both maneuvers LV geometry was altered as demonstrated by the significant increase in the normalized curvature radius of the interventricular septum and the unchanged curvature radius of the LV free wall. LV filling was altered during both maneuvers as demonstrated by significant decreases in early peak flow velocity, early-to-late peak flow velocity ratio, and early deceleration rate. Thus, during maneuvers that acutely decrease or increase ITP, alterations in LV geometry occur. These acute distortions of LV geometry may be one of the mechanisms responsible for alterations in LV filling.\r"

  ".W": "Fenoldopam mesylate (SK&F 82526-J) is a novel benzazepine derivative. It has selective agonist activity at post-junctional (DA1) vascular dopaminergic receptors, which normally subserve renal artery vasodilation. Previous studies in normal subjects and in patients with hypertension indicate that fenoldopam increases renal blood flow and promotes a sodium diuresis. Drug efficacy was clinically evaluated in eight patients with chronic congestive heart failure (CHF) after a single oral dose of 100 mg of fenoldopam and following 3 days of therapy (100 mg four times daily). Stroke volume index acutely increased from 26 +/- 7 (mean +/- SD) to 30 +/- 4 ml/beat/m2 (p less than 0.05) and left ventricular filling pressure decreased from 26 +/- 13 to 23 +/- 11 mm Hg (p less than 0.05). Systemic vascular resistance decreased from 1513 +/- 159 to 1128 +/- 319 (p less than 0.05). Hemodynamic changes were seen as early as 30 minutes following fenoldopam and returned to control levels by 4 hours. Forearm blood flow, hepatic blood flow, and venous capacitance did not significantly change acutely, but renal blood flow index was significantly reduced (34 +/- 4 to 30 +/- 3 min-1 X 1000, p less than 0.01). Plasma norepinephrine, plasma renin activity, plasma arginine vasopressin, and plasma aldosterone did not significantly change acutely. After 3 days of treatment, 100 mg of fenoldopam again reduced the renal blood flow index (35 +/- 7 to 26 +/- 7 min-1 X 1000, p less than 0.01) and tended to increase plasma renin activity (11.7 +/- 8 to 21.2 +/- 19.4 ng/ml/hr, p = NS).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The hemodynamic effects of varying oral doses of the long-acting converting enzyme inhibitor lisinopril were studied in an acute, single-blind, parallel fashion in 55 patients with moderate to severe congestive heart failure. Doses of 2.5, 5.0, and 10 mg produced a significant increase in cardiac index and significant reductions in pulmonary capillary wedge, right atrial, pulmonary arterial, and systemic arterial pressures and systemic vascular resistance. The changes were present up to 24 hours after dosing for most parameters. There was a clear-cut dose-response relationship observed. Forty-seven patients were followed over a 3-month period, during which functional status and exercise tolerance improved. Although 26% showed some evidence of renal dysfunction with lisinopril, these changes could be normalized by decreasing either the lisinopril or the diuretic dose. These data demonstrate that the hemodynamic changes with the long-acting converting enzyme inhibitor lisinopril can be modulated with dose adjustment in patients with congestive heart failure. They also suggest that renal function changes may be normalized by adjustment of either the dose of lisinopril or the diuretic dose.\r"

The first period of monitoring began 24 hours before the first dose was given, and continued for 24 hours afterwards. A second 24-hour period of monitoring was carried out after 8 weeks of treatment, commencing immediately after the morning dose. Angiotensin II levels and serum drug levels were measured at 0, 2, 6 and 24 hours after the acute dose. BP decreased progressively from the first hour after the first dose, reached a maximum in the fifth hour (p less than 0.001) and then the effect diminished. The maximum reduction of systolic BP in any patient was 64 mm Hg, the minimum 4 mm Hg. Blood pressure was significantly (p less than 0.05) reduced throughout the 24 hours after dosing, with a mean daytime reduction of 13/12 mm Hg, and a mean nighttime reduction of 15/7 mm Hg. Angiotensin II levels were significantly (p less than 0.02) and maximally reduced by 2 hours after administration, but the reduction was no longer significant after 24 hours. Serum drug levels were also maximal 2 hours after administration. The trial population could be clearly divided into groups of good and poor responders on the basis of BP reduction. The angiotensin II levels were higher before treatment, and decreased further, in all patients with a good response than in those with a poor response.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

CsA levels were measured by whole blood radioimmunoassay. All the patients had similar patterns of CsA pharmacokinetics with a single peak blood level at two to eight hours after the drug was given. Plasmas separated from the bloods at 37 degrees C were added to third party mixed lymphocyte reactions (MLR). The kinetics of suppression of the MLR by serial plasmas did not follow the CsA levels. Instead, we observed patterns of suppression similar to those that have been described in adults. Five patients had pattern I with two peaks of plasma-mediated MLR suppression, and had no rejection episodes. Two of the patients had pattern II with only one peak of MLR suppression, and both had episodes of acute rejection. One patient showed pattern III with a pleateau of MLR suppression, and has had no rejection episodes and no obvious CsA toxicity. Three patients showed pattern IV with a continuously low level of plasma-mediated MLR suppression throughout the day, and two of them have had severe rejection episodes. Immunopharmacodynamic profiling (IP) may prove to be useful in individualizing therapeutic regimens for patients with renal allografts treated with CsA.\r"

Patients were divided into three groups: group I: no C3 deposits, 47 patients; group II: granular deposits of C3, 28 patients; and group III: linear TBM deposits, 13 patients. The incidence of acute and chronic rejection was not different. In group III, 12 grafts were lost by 5 years (92%), and the remaining patient has chronic rejection. Group III survival was significantly less than groups I and II (Kaplan-Meier curves), P = 0.02, but graft survival in groups I and II were similar. There was no association of anti-TBM antibody deposits with C3, and the mechanism of deposition is unknown. We conclude that the presence of linear C3 deposits along the TBM in the setting of allograft dysfunction is associated with decreased allograft survival.\r"

Renal disease was observed in all groups of patients with a risk factor for HIV infection with a lesser incidence, however, among homosexuals. Intravenous drug (IVD) use and possibly race appear to be important factors in the development of renal complications. Renal disease was the dominant clinical feature in eight asymptomatic HIV carriers and in 34 patients with AIDS-related complex (ARC) who had not developed the opportunistic infections and/or malignancies associated with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Ninety-one percent of consultations were requested for evaluation of proteinuria and/or renal failure. Nephrotic range proteinuria, in excess of 3 g/24 h, was present in 52 patients, and was less prevalent in homosexuals than in other groups at risk. Renal failure (serum creatinine greater than or equal to 5 mg/dL), initially present in 32 patients, eventually developed in 69 and improved in only 18 of them. A renal biopsy, obtained for work-up of nephrotic syndrome (22 patients) or renal insufficiency (3 patients), uncovered a picture of focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis in all 25 instances. Overall, 76 patients are dead, seven are lost to follow-up, and 17 are alive, of whom eight (four HIV carriers, two patients with ARC, and two with AIDS) are on maintenance hemodialysis with a mean survival time of 217 days.\r"

The first graft contained IgA deposits at the time of donation, suggesting that transmission of IgA deposits may have contributed to the nephritis of the first allograft. The second graft was free of IgA deposits at the time of donation, but the recipient developed a similar, rapidly progressive nephritis. This case points up the malignant potential of IgA nephropathy and the complex nature of transplant planning for patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) secondary to IgA nephropathy. Living-related donor (LRD) transplants seem to be associated with a higher rate of recurrence than cadaveric grafts. This higher rate may partly reflect the inadvertent transmission of subclinical IgA deposits from donor to recipient and a genetic susceptibility of certain HLA types (specifically B35 and DR4) to recurrent disease. Cadaveric transplants may be preferable in the setting of high-risk HLA types or familial patterns of IgA nephropathy.\r"

We studied a 17-year-old woman who had recurrent right flank pain, gross hematuria, and fever, without evidence of urinary tract infection. Her physical exam was remarkable for right costovertebral angle tenderness and a normal BP. Her urinalysis showed blood and protein but her creatinine clearance and 24-hour urinary calcium excretion were normal. A kidney biopsy was remarkable for arteriolar subintimal fibrous thickening and fibrin deposition, but no glomerulonephritis. Her peripheral hemostasis evaluation was normal except for circulating platelet aggregates and elevated fibrinopeptide A levels. On two occasions, her serum was unable to normally support prostacyclin (PGI2) production by cultured human umbilical endothelial cells, as measured by radioimmunoassay (RIA) of its stable metabolite 6-keto-PGF alpha. Blood samples from the right renal vein and inferior vena cava revealed a selective elevation of fibrinopeptide A in the right renal venous effluent. The presence of circulating platelet aggregates and elevated levels of fibrinopeptide A (a cleavage product of fibrin) suggests that platelet activation and fibrin deposition may play a role in the pathogenesis of this disorder. The inability of her serum to normally support the production of the potent antiplatelet and antithrombotic substance, PGI2, could represent a primary renovascular endothelial cell defect.\r"

  ".U": "88292265\r", 
  ".W": "The diagnosis of recurrent renal disease after transplantation is dependent on an accurate and complete diagnosis of the initial cause of renal failure and a similar determination of the cause of graft failure. To be classified as recurrent, the disease in the renal graft must be identical to that seen in the native kidneys. Recurrence of disease accounts for less than 2% of all graft failures, but the overall incidence of recurrent disease is probably 5 to 10 times more common. The most frequent cause of recurrent disease is glomerulonephritis, which was first recognized to recur soon after renal transplantation was introduced. It was then recognized that a variety of metabolic disorders would recur, but it has taken 25 years of experience for a clear picture to emerge of recurrence in most conditions. No initial cause of renal failure poses a contraindication to at least one attempt at transplantation, although with Fabry's disease and oxalosis, a special assessment of the risks for the individual recipient is warranted. In some patients, experience has shown the need for a delay in the commitment to transplantation (eg, in those with anti-glomerular basement membrane [GBM] antibody glomerulonephritis or Henoch Schonlein purpura), the need for the choice of a particular immunosuppressive regimen (eg, in hemolytic uremic syndrome [HUS]), the need for avoidance of primary nonfunction (eg, in oxalosis), and the desirability of avoiding live kidney donation (eg, in heterozygote donors in Fabry's disease, high-risk recipients with focal glomerulosclerosis, and in recipients with HUS). Probably all types of glomerulonephritis recur, but with great variation in frequency and severity. In some forms of glomerulonephritis, recurrence may be frequent and definite on histopathological criteria but may only have a minor clinical expression (eg, dense deposit disease, anti-GBM antibody glomerulonephritis, IgA nephropathy), but in others, recurrence is less predictable yet it is clearly associated with premature graft failure (eg, focal glomerulosclerosis, membranous nephropathy). A common theme emerging is that where the initial glomerulonephritis is aggressive and causes kidney failure over a short time, recurrence is more likely, and when present, it will lead to graft failure with an increased frequency. Clinical manifestations, the frequency of recurrence, and the prognosis of the graft are now identified for most conditions. Unexpected observations have included the rarity of recurrent systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), the immediate return of heavy proteinuria in focal glomerulosclerosis, and the predictable return of dense deposit disease.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

All five patients with myopathy, including two in whom no deletions had been detected before, were found to have variable-sized deletions extending through the 3' end of this gene. The 5' deletion breakpoints are intragenic in four cases and have been mapped precisely on the exon-containing HindIII fragment map.

Comparisons were made of 35-year-equivalent-risk values by maternal age, that is, MSAFP values (at various maternal ages) that predict the risk (of a Down syndrome offspring) equivalent to that of an average 35-year-old woman irrespective of knowledge of MSAFP. This boundary was chosen because MSAFP values that predict a greater risk than this point for younger women or a lower risk for older women are likely in many jurisdictions to alter a decision about amniocentesis that would be reached without knowledge of MSAFP. There were marked differences among available studies in these 35-year-equivalent-risk values for older women. For instance, for age 41, the values among studies vary from 1.5 MoM to 2.1 MoM and the predicted proportion of 41-year-old women likely to be affected clinically by MSAFP determinations by the above criterion is 4.4%-18%, depending on which rate schedule is used. At age 39, the variation is 1.1 to 1.9 MoM or 7.1% to 38%. Possible explanations for the variation include sampling fluctuation. Relatively few data on Down syndrome have been used to calculate the parameters of the gaussian distributions used by the studies reviewed. It is suggested that great caution be used before employing published rate schedules for genetic counseling of older women, at least until sufficient data are collected and the nature of the discrepancies among studies is clarified.\r"

These were analyzed for year of publication, sex and mean age of patients, percentage of patients with angina pectoris, percentage of patients with prior myocardial infarction, percentage of patients taking beta-blocking medications, and for angiographic referral (workup) bias, blinding of tests, and technical factors. The percentage of patients with myocardial infarction had the highest correlation with sensitivity (0.45, p = 0.0007). Only the inclusion of subjects with prior infarction and the percentage of men in the study group were independently and significantly (p less than 0.05) related to test sensitivity. Both the presence of workup bias and publication year adversely affected specificity (p less than 0.05). Of these two factors, publication year had the strongest association by stepwise linear regression. This analysis suggests that the reported sensitivity of thallium scintigraphy is higher and the specificity lower than that expected in clinical practice because of the presence of workup bias and the inappropriate inclusion of post-infarct patients.\r"

  ".W": "The hyperfiltration induced by an acute response to an oral protein and water load was investigated to ascertain whether it can modify the urinary albumin excretion (UAE) in the microalbuminuric range by further increasing the glomerular filter permeability. To this end, six patients with a single kidney selected as having microalbuminuria on a regular diet without the clinical or laboratory data of overt renal disease and eight healthy subjects received a short-term protein and water load (150 g of meat-derived protein and 1 liter of water). In patients with one kidney, mean basal UAE values were significantly higher than in control subjects (p less than 0.006), whereas endogenous creatinine clearance values were only slightly lower (p greater than 0.05). One hour after the protein and water load, an abrupt increase in microalbuminuria levels was found in patients with one kidney and mean UAE values were significantly higher than in control subjects (p less than 0.002), whereas mean creatinine clearance values were significantly lower in patients than in control subjects (p less than 0.01). High UAE (p less than 0.002) and low creatinine clearance (p less than 0.002) values were maintained over the following four hours in patients with one kidney. These data suggest that in the single kidney with reduced renal functional reserve, an oral protein and water load magnifies the pre-existing loss of glomerular permselective properties due to chronic hyperfiltration as manifested by a further increase in microalbuminuria.\r"

Following treatment with corticosteroids, remission occurred and the serum antiglomerular basement membrane antibody became negative. In 1983, he experienced a relapse with the reappearance of serum antiglomerular basement membrane antibody, the development of severe life-threatening intrapulmonary hemorrhage, and hematuria. This case illustrates that life-threatening relapse may occur in Goodpasture's syndrome despite a prolonged remission and the disappearance of detectable antiglomerular basement membrane antibody in the circulation.\r"

All patients also received prophylactic vitamin K. When National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards breakpoints for susceptibility were used, a greater proportion of pretherapy isolates of gram-negative aerobic bacilli and gram-positive organisms were found to be susceptible to cefoperazone (94 percent) and imipenem (91 percent) than to moxalactam (84 percent), ceftazidime (85 percent), or piperacillin (85 percent). In trial I, the overall response rates for documented or possible infections were 78 percent (76 of 97 patients) for cefoperazone/piperacillin and 80 percent (72 of 90 patients) for moxalactam/piperacillin. In trial II, the overall response rates were 86 percent (25 of 29 patients) for cefoperazone/piperacillin, 74 percent (20 of 27 patients) for ceftazidime/piperacillin, and 72 percent (21 of 29 patients) for imipenem alone. There was no nephrotoxicity or hemorrhage related to the study drugs. Diarrhea was more frequent with each of the double beta-lactam regimens, whereas nausea and seizures were more common with imipenem given at a dosage of 1.0 g intravenously every six hours. Seizures occurred in three of 29 imipenem-treated patients but in none of 243 patients treated with the double beta-lactam regimens (p less than 0.001). These results suggest that cefoperazone plus piperacillin provides adequate coverage for most common bacterial pathogens and is safe and effective therapy for febrile granulocytopenic patients.\r"

Thirty febrile episodes were treated with cefoperazone plus piperacillin and mezlocillin plus tobramycin, respectively. There was no significant difference between the two groups with respect to age, sex, pretherapy neutrophil count, and mean duration of therapy. The majority of patients had neutrophil counts of no more than 200/mm3 at the initiation of therapy. Only microbiologically and clinically documented infections were evaluated for efficacy. The cefoperazone plus piperacillin regimen appeared to have a comparable response rate with the mezlocillin plus tobramycin regimen (20 of 24 patients [83 percent] versus 16 of 23 patients [70 percent]). Gram-positive micro-organisms were seen predominantly in this study, with the cefoperazone plus piperacillin regimen achieving a bacteriologic response in 84 percent, as opposed to 60 percent for those organisms treated with the mezlocillin plus tobramycin regimen. Neither regimen was totally effective against coagulase-negative staphylococci. Eight superinfections occurred in the cefoperazone plus piperacillin arm, whereas 11 superinfections occurred in the mezlocillin plus tobramycin arm. Although fungal superinfections were most common, the number of gram-positive superinfections in the mezlocillin plus tobramycin arm exceeded those seen in the cefoperazone plus piperacillin arm. The incidence of antibiotic-related side effects was similar in the two groups. Hypokalemia was most frequently seen. Both skin rashes and nephrotoxicity were more common with mezlocillin plus tobramycin. Cefoperazone plus piperacillin was found to be effective empiric therapy in febrile neutropenic patients. This double beta-lactam combination may be particularly useful for patients who have or are at high risk for the development of renal insufficiency.\r"

In addition, patient acceptance of the two once-daily Uniphyl regimens was significantly (p less than 0.01) greater than that of the previous twice-daily theophylline therapy. During the fourth week of the study, the evening Uniphyl dosing schedule resulted in significantly (p less than 0.01) higher home-monitored morning peak expiratory flow rates and fewer nighttime awakenings than the pre-study twice-daily theophylline regimen.

Despite these differences in serum concentrations, morning and evening pulmonary function test values (forced expiratory volume in one second and peak expiratory flow rate) and symptom scores were nearly identical for the two preparations, as was the supplemental use of aerosol bronchodilators. Once-daily dosing with Uniphyl tablets may benefit adolescent patients with nocturnal asthma by increasing compliance and providing better asthma control. In addition, the lower daytime theophylline levels produced by this preparation may also reduce long-term adverse effects on behavior and cognition.\r"

In humans, the caliber of both the upper and lower airways shows circadian fluctuation that is amplified in disease states. The caliber of the airways of the tracheobronchial tree decreases at night and increases during the day. In asthmatic persons, the nocturnal decrease is amplified, causing peak dyspnea, wheezing, cough, sneezing, rhinorrhea, and nasal stuffiness to occur between 2:00 and 6:00 A.M.

Eighty-two percent of the patients were treated for moderate or severe disease. After a one-week evaluation of baseline theophylline therapy (with adjunctive medication), the patients substituted evening doses of the once-daily drug in approximate milligram-for-milligram equivalent doses. Concomitant medications were allowed as before. Nighttime and morning asthma control improved significantly without deterioration in the evening, and without increased side effects. Once-daily therapy resulted in markedly fewer night awakenings involving inhaler use (p less than 0.01), and near 60 percent reductions in the number of patients with nighttime or early morning exacerbations (p less than 0.01). Control of morning chest tightness, wheeze, and dyspnea improved significantly (p less than 0.01), and patients' as well as investigators' global evaluations favored once-daily treatment (p less than 0.01). Morning peak expiratory flow rates improved both at home (p less than 0.01) and at the office (p = 0.05). The forced expiratory volume in one second at the office increased modestly in the entire group.

This article reviews the basic concepts of human chronobiology and discusses the rhythm dependence of certain disease states and the pharmacodynamics of medications frequently prescribed for their treatment. Special reference is made to the nocturnal exacerbation of asthma and the use of chronobiologic principles in its treatment.\r"

  ".W": "Oxygen desaturation and subclinical coronary artery disease may predispose older patients with chronic airflow obstruction to cardiac arrhythmias, especially when high concentrations of theophylline are present in the blood. To assess the safety and efficacy of Uniphyl tablets, an oral theophylline preparation formulated for once-daily dosing, in elderly patients with chronic airflow obstruction, we conducted a randomized, three-phase, double-blind crossover study comparing evening dosing with Uniphyl tablets, Theo-Dur tablets administered twice daily, and placebo. The patients in the study were scheduled to receive each treatment for two weeks. Each day, symptoms, side effects, peak expiratory flow rates, and use of metered-dose inhalers were recorded. Near the end of each phase, serum theophylline concentrations were measured every two hours between 8:00 A.M. and 8:00 P.M. on two consecutive days. The patients underwent ambulatory Holter monitoring during the final 48 hours of each phase. Twelve patients completed the active-drug phases of the study, but seven of the 12 were removed from the placebo phase because of increasing symptom severity. The difference between the number of patients completing the active-drug and placebo phases was statistically significant (p less than 0.001). Treatment with Uniphyl tablets resulted in a significantly (p less than 0.05) greater increase in peak expiratory flow rate than Theo-Dur tablet therapy, and both active drugs increased peak expiratory flow rate more than placebo. Circadian variation in peak expiratory flow rate was seen during the placebo and Theo-Dur tablet phases but not during the Uniphyl tablet phase. Symptoms and side effects were similar during the two active-drug phases. Cardiac ectopy was observed in most of the patients, but it was not significantly greater during the theophylline phases than during the placebo phase. Furthermore, ectopic activity was not directly related to the times of maximal serum theophylline concentration.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: Physicians increasingly prescribe cyclosporine as an immunosuppressive agent for both organ-transplant and non-organ-transplant recipients. Investigators have reported a high incidence of drug-induced hypertension even when clinical nephrotoxicity was not present. We wanted to determine the reason. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A comparison was made of hypertension in 15 cyclosporine-treated transplant recipients with that in a similar group of 15 azathioprine-treated transplant recipients. RESULTS: Hypertension in the cyclosporine group responded differently from that seen in the azathioprine group and from previously described forms of post-transplantation hypertension. Hypertensive cyclosporine-treated patients show a sodium acquisitive renal state that responds to sodium restriction. Unlike rat models, which suggest cyclosporine-induced stimulation of the renin-angiotensin system, or previous forms of post-transplant hypertension in humans, plasma renin levels were not elevated and blood pressure did not respond to a test dose of captopril. CONCLUSION: Hypertension in cyclosporine-treated patients is an iatrogenic form of hypertension that may be associated with an early, subtle, renal defect in sodium excretion, a genesis of hypertension that is consistent with Guyton's view of essential hypertension.\r"

With the availability of recombinant interferon, we decided to conduct a multicenter, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial of intramuscular recombinant interferon alpha-2a to assess its efficacy and safety in the treatment of localized herpes zoster in immunosuppressed patients with cancer. PATIENTS and METHODS: Immunosuppressed cancer patients with localized herpes zoster were randomly assigned to receive placebo, 36 X 10(6) units of recombinant interferon alpha-2a per day, or 68 X 10(6) units of recombinant interferon alpha-2a per day. Due to frequent adverse effects, the 68 X 10(6) unit dose of interferon was discontinued prior to conclusion of the trial. RESULTS: Dissemination of herpes zoster occurred in 14 of the 24 patients (58 percent) who received placebo but in only four of 24 recipients (17 percent) of 36 X 10(6) units of interferon per day (p = 0.003). Adverse effects (fever, chills, headaches, gastrointestinal irritability, fatigue, and myalgias) were more common or severe in interferon-treated patients. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that interferon modifies the severity of herpes zoster in immunosuppressed patients with cancer but is associated with frequent side effects.\r"

  ".U": "88292367\r", 
  ".W": "PURPOSE: Infections of the lower respiratory tract pose an important problem in nursing homes. Despite the magnitude of this problem, few, if any, antibiotic studies have been targeted specifically at nursing home-acquired bronchopulmonary infections. Following the establishment of a teaching Extended-Care Nursing Home Program, which facilitated the early diagnosis and therapy of bronchopulmonary infections, a comparative trial of oral ciprofloxacin and intramuscular cefamandole was initiated in elderly patients with lower respiratory tract infections. In addition to assessing the relative efficacy and safety of ciprofloxacin and cefamandole, our goals were to identify problems and pitfalls associated with conducting clinical research in this nursing home setting, evaluate selected clinical and laboratory features of lower respiratory tract infection in this patient population, and measure outcomes in all study groups. PATIENTS and METHODS: During a 20-month period, 40 patients with pneumonia and 20 patients with acute bronchitis were enrolled in this randomized study. Sixty-three patients with pneumonia who were ineligible for the randomized study were also followed prospectively. The mean age of the 111 participants (123 cases) was 80.8 years; all patients had at least one chronic medical condition. RESULTS: Although Streptococcus pneumoniae was the single most common isolate, gram-negative bacteria were cultured from 81 percent of the cases that yielded pathogens from a satisfactory sputum specimen. The in-hospital mortality rate was strikingly low (6.5 percent), and a large majority of patients in all study groups were discharged safely back to their nursing homes well within the Diagnosis-Related Group length of stay. CONCLUSION: Ciprofloxacin appeared to be as safe and effective as cefamandole in this nursing home program; however, additional studies are needed to determine its role in the treatment of elderly patients with bronchopulmonary infections.\r"

In patients with pulmonary emphysema, pulmonary fibrosis, bronchial asthma, or pulmonary infections, including pneumonia and pulmonary tuberculosis, serum elastase 1 levels were greater than those of an age-matched control group. In lung cancer patients, however, the serum elastase 1 level was within normal limits. Although alpha 1-antitrypsin levels were significantly higher in patients with pulmonary infections and lung cancer than in the normal group, they were within normal limits in patients with pulmonary emphysema, pulmonary fibrosis, and bronchial asthma. Alpha 2-macroglobulin levels were slightly increased in patients with pulmonary emphysema and pneumonia. These results suggest that the increases in serum elastase 1 levels in these respiratory diseases may be mainly caused by an imbalance of elastase/antielastase system in the lung tissue and the bloodstream.\r"

  ".W": "Recent studies in patients with transmural acute myocardial infarction have demonstrated that intravenous thrombolytic therapy with streptokinase or tissue plasminogen activator improves left ventricular function and reduces mortality. To accomplish this, these agents must be infused early, ie, within 3 to 4 hours of the onset of chest pain; later administration of the agents exerts no significant beneficial effect. Tissue plasminogen activator appears to be the most effective and safest of the available thrombolytic agents: its intravenous administration is followed by coronary reperfusion in about 70% of patients, and its use is not associated with allergic reactions, a systemic fibrinolytic state, or a prolonged fibrinolytic effect. Once reperfusion has been established with an intravenous thrombolytic agent, intravenous heparin is given for several days, followed by oral aspirin to prevent reocclusion. Since many of these patients have a residual high-grade coronary artery stenosis in the infarct-related artery, mechanical alleviation of the residual stenosis with angioplasty or bypass surgery is an attractive therapy 2 to 4 days after reperfusion, and preliminary data indicate that elective coronary angioplasty 3 days after thrombolytic therapy is beneficial. However, further studies are needed to assess more definitively the use of such an aggressive therapeutic strategy.\r"

  ".W": "The Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) most frequently is the result of sepsis. Accumulation of neutrophils in lung interstitium is a well-documented phenomenon, but the nature of their presence remains obscure. We hypothesized that endotoxin causes the release of substances into lung lymph that activate neutrophils and that methylprednisolone may prevent sequestration and activation of neutrophils. We used the sheep lung lymph fistula-endotoxin model of ARDS to test this hypothesis. Unanesthetized animals were given either 0.5 microgram/kg of E. coli endotoxin intravenously alone or, on a different experimental day, an identical dose of endotoxin preceded by a 1 gm bolus of methylprednisolone plus a 1 gm/hr continuous infusion. Endotoxin infusion caused the release of substances into lung lymph that were capable of stimulating normal sheep neutrophils to aggregate, migrate, and release superoxide. This activity appeared within 1 hour of endotoxin and persisted for at least 4 hours. Pretreatment by methylprednisolone did not prevent the early activity but did significantly reduce such activity 3-4 hours after endotoxin, when the permeability defects caused by endotoxin are most pronounced. We speculate that endotoxin-stimulated production of humoral neutrophil-activating substances in the lung may play a role in the pathogenesis of acute lung injury.\r"

However, the levobunolol group had a mean decrease in pressure (0.43 mm Hg). There was no significant difference between preoperative and late postoperative pressures for any of the groups. One-way analysis of covariance of the changes in pressure from the preoperative to early postoperative period showed a significant increase for the placebo and betaxolol groups compared to the levobunolol group, without significant difference between the levobunolol and timolol groups.

  ".W": "Cytokeratins are a set of 19 proteins that together constitute the class of intermediate filament protein expressed by epithelial cells and tumors. Using a panel of 9 different monoclonal anti-cytokeratin antibodies, the authors have performed immunocytochemistry on methanol-fixed, frozen sections and methacarn-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue of human myometrial specimens. Anomalous cytokeratin expression (ACE) by smooth muscle cells was found in all specimens. Immunoblots of this tissue confirmed the presence of cytokeratin 19, and possibly 8. In addition, immunocytochemical studies demonstrated ACE in human fetal tissues within the intestinal muscularis and the heart, especially in the region of the aortic outflow tract, and in 8 of 19 cases of leiomyosarcoma from adults. Indirect immunofluorescence studies were also performed on cells explanted from myometrial tissue; the overwhelming majority of cells derived from these cultures were smooth muscle cells as verified by expression of muscle actins, and a subpopulation of these cells was found to be cytokeratin-positive. ACE was confirmed in vitro by double labeling experiments demonstrating simultaneous expression of muscle actins and cytokeratins within the same cell. The significance of this smooth muscle cell ACE is unknown, but it may be a phenotypic marker of smooth muscle in a proliferative state. ACE could be a source of confusion in the immunocytochemical analysis of poorly differentiated malignancies if a complete panel of antibodies is not employed.\r"

  ".W": "To determine which cells in kidney grafts are infected with human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) before and after transplantation, kidney specimens were studied by in situ hybridization with 35S-labeled DNA probes representing HCMV immediate-early and late genes. Pretransplantation biopsies and serial posttransplantation biopsies were obtained from 7 renal grafts. All of the transplant recipients were HCMV-seronegative at the time of transplantation and all developed primary HCMV infections. HCMV nucleic acids were not detected in biopsies taken from the healthy donor kidneys before transplantation. However, biopsies taken at various intervals after transplantation showed abundant hybridization with HCMV immediate-early and late gene probes. Virtually all of the hybridizing cells were mononuclear inflammatory cells in the interstitial spaces of the kidney. Occasional hybridization was seen with renal tubular or glomerular cells. No cytomegalic cells were seen. Biopsy specimens taken after systemic anti-HCMV chemotherapy with phosphonoformate showed no uniform reduction in HCMV gene expression. These studies demonstrate that the principal HCMV-infected cells in kidneys of renal transplant patients with primary HCMV infections are infiltrating inflammatory cells.\r"

While the administration of 6.3 x 10(-8) M chloroquine had little morphological effect on the chloroquine-resistant strain, the combination of chloroquine and verapamil resulted in typical chloroquine-related food vacuolar swelling with increased amounts of granular matrix. Secondary morphological changes included degeneration of nuclei, mitochondria, and other organelles. These effects appeared similar to those in the chloroquine-sensitive strain of P. falciparum treated with chloroquine alone or with the chloroquine/verapamil combination. Furthermore mild food vacuolar changes were seen in a small number of parasites (from both chloroquine-sensitive and -resistant groups) exposed to high concentrations (1 x 10(-4) M) of verapamil alone.\r"

Eighty-four samples contained trophozoites (ring forms) only and 11 samples contained gametocytes and trophozoites. Two patterns of pigmentation were observed in the trophozoite-containing samples: 48 (57%) contained trophozoites in which no pigment could be detected, 32 (38%) contained trophozoites with clearly detectable pigment, and 4 (5%) contained both pigmented and nonpigmented forms. Trophozoite pigmentation did not correlate with percent parasitemia or age or sex of the patients. These results indicate that microscopically observable pigment accumulation in trophozoites of P. falciparum is not required during the asexual multiplication cycle. Pigment accumulation may be triggered later in infection, perhaps as a feature of the differentiation process leading to the formation of gametocytes.\r"

Blockage of cerebral capillaries by Plasmodium falciparum infected erythrocytes appeared to be the principal cause of cerebral malaria. From electron microscopic results, it was concluded that knobs on infected erythrocytes acted as focal junctions which mediated adhesion to endothelial cells. The knobs are, therefore, important contributors to the blockage of the capillary lumen and ensuing pathological changes in cerebral tissues. Host cell molecules such as OKM5 and thrombospondin may function as endothelial cell surface receptors for the attachment of knobs of P. falciparum infected erythrocytes. Immunological events might also play a role in the pathogenesis of cerebral malaria. This was suggested by the presence of IgG, IgM, P. falciparum antigens, and knob proteins in the cerebral capillaries of the people with cerebral malaria. It will be important to assess the candidate malaria vaccines now in development not only for their efficacy in reducing parasitemia but for effects they may have on the sequestration of infected erythrocytes in the brain.\r"

The lysates are prepared from 100 microliter blood samples by a simple 3-step procedure using 2 volumes of H2O to lyse the erythrocytes (step I), 1 volume of a detergent/EDTA mix to lyse the parasites (step II), followed by the addition of 1 volume cesium trifluoroacetate (CsTFA) (step III). The parasite DNA was found to be undegraded, as shown by the unaltered pattern of repetitive sequences obtained after storage of up to 1 month at 37 degrees C, due to the inhibition of DNA degrading enzymes by the cesium salt. The bulk of protein can be removed from the samples by a 1-step precipitation. The addition of 0.3 volumes of a mixture of ethanol: chloroform: isoamyl alcohol (2.5:1:0.04 v/v) precipitates greater than 90% of the proteins from the lysates, leaving greater than 86% of the parasite DNA in the supernatant. The reduced protein content of the samples, when applied to solid supports, results in an increased signal: background ratio on autoradiograms.\r"

Total amount of IgE fixed on the mast cells, detected by reverse passive cutaneous anaphylaxis with anti-rat IgE, was significantly more in the infected rats than in uninfected rats. Worm burden at 290 days post-infection did not correlate to anti-Clonorchis IgE antibody titers, reverse passive cutaneous anaphylaxis titers, or anti-Clonorchis anaphylactic antibody on the mast cells, determined by active cutaneous anaphylaxis. Active cutaneous anaphylaxis titers interrelated to reverse passive cutaneous anaphylaxis titers, suggesting a correlation between the amount of anti-Clonorchis anaphylactic antibodies and total IgE on the mast cells. Sensitivity of passive cutaneous anaphylaxis with anti-BSA IgE antibody was significantly suppressed in Clonorchis infected rats. Moreover, anti-BSA IgE titers in the infected rats were inversely related to reverse passive cutaneous anaphylaxis titers, indicating that increase of IgE antibody on the mast cells by Clonorchis infection interfered with sensitization of anti-BSA IgE antibody.\r"

The carotid artery, innominate arteries, or both were involved in all reconstructions. Concomitant carotid or subclavian endarterectomy was performed in 14 patients, 1 of whom also had a coronary bypass at the same time. Two patients (7 percent) died in the postoperative period. Twenty-three of 24 survivors (96 percent) had relief of symptoms after operation. Only one patient had worsening of symptoms postoperatively, which was secondary to intracerebral hemorrhage. Results of this study indicate that direct revascularization of the arch branches can be carried out with minimal morbidity and mortality. Relief of presenting symptoms is to be expected, and long-term results suggest that the operation is durable.\r"

  ".W": "Recent increases in knowledge of cellular immunology, combined with developments in biotechnology, have provided new opportunities for the development of immunotherapies for the treatment of cancer in humans. One approach to therapy is that of adoptive immunotherapy, that is, the transfer to the tumor bearing host of lymphoid cells with antitumor reactivity that can mediate antitumor responses. Several lymphocyte subpopulations have now been identified that may be suitable for use in adoptive immunotherapy. Resting lymphocytes incubated in interleukin-2 (IL-2) give rise to lymphokine activated killer (LAK) cells that can lyse malignant cells, but not normal cells. Clinical studies in patients with advanced cancer have revealed that treatment with high dose IL-2 alone or in combination with LAK cells can mediate the complete or partial regression of cancer in selected patients. Other approaches are currently undergoing investigation, including the adoptive transfer of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, which, in animal models, have antitumor reactivity 50-100 times more potent than do LAK cells. Other new approaches to immunotherapy include the use of combination of lymphokines, such as the use of tumor necrosis factor or alpha interferon in conjunction with IL-2. The availability of recombinant lymphokines that provide large amounts of biologically active materials can hopefully lead to the development of effective new therapies for cancer in humans.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to identify which of the biochemical, immunological, or functional parameters derived before surgery as part of a systemic evaluation were helpful in predicting the frequency of rejection episodes, the chance of survival, and the cause risk of death (should death occur) of patients after orthotopic liver transplantation (OLTx). Ninety-eight adult patients who had an extensive preoperative protocol evaluation were studied before OLTx. The biochemical parameters assessed were albumin, prothrombin time, bilirubin, and ICG clearance. The immunologic parameters assessed included total lymphocytes, T3 cells, T4 cells, T8 cells, and the T4/T8 ratio. The degree of histocompatibility antigen (HLA) matching between the donor and the recipient was also evaluated in 80 of the 98 patients studied. Most postoperative deaths occurred within 12 weeks of the procedure (24%; 24 of 98 patients); 13 patients (13%) died within the first 6 postoperative weeks, of either bacterial or fungal sepsis. An additional 14 patients (14%) died after the initial 6 postoperative weeks due, primarily of an acquired viral and/or protozoan infection (p less than 0.01). During the first 6 weeks, survival was better for patients with cholestatic liver disease (ChLD, 93%, n = 45) and miscellaneous liver diseases (MISC, 100%, n = 10) than it was for those with parenchymal liver diseases (PLD, 77%, n = 43). Although albumin, prothrombin time, T4/T8 ratios, and per cent T8 cells were statistically different in patients with PLD as compared with those with ChLD, these parameters, as well as the per cent T4 cells, serum bilirubin level, per cent retention of ICG at 15 minutes, and the plasma ICG disappearance rate were not found to be of substantial help in predicting patient survival or non-survival. Moreover, neither the degree of HLA matching nor the number of rejection episodes differed between surviving and nonsurviving patients. The results of this study suggest that patients with PLD are at increased risk of early postoperative death after OLTx because of bacterial and/or fungal sepsis, as compared with patients operated upon for ChLD. Better pre-, intra-, and postoperative predictors of risk of death and complications are needed to reduce the early mortality observed after orthotopic liver transplantation.\r"

  ".W": "The results of randomized clinical trials evaluating commonly used methods of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis in moderate- and high-risk general surgery patients were pooled to obtain an unbiased estimate of efficacy and risks. Low-dose heparin (LDH), dextran, heparin-dihydroergotamine (HDHE), intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC), and graded elastic stockings significantly reduced the incidence of DVT; aspirin was ineffective. In contrast to other methods, elastic stockings have not been adequately studied to determine their value in reducing DVT in high-risk patients, such as those with malignancy. Only LDH and dextran were studied in numbers of patients sufficient for demonstrating a clear reduction in pulmonary embolism (PE). In comparison studies, LDH was superior to dextran in preventing DVT, but the two agents were equivalent in protecting against PE. Although HDHE was marginally better than LDH in preventing DVT, it appeared to have no advantage in preventing PE--at least in moderate-risk patients. The incidence of major hemorrhage was not increased with any of the prophylactic agents. However, wound hematomas occurred significantly more frequently with LDH, an effect noted in the pooled data from double-blind and open trials. In comparison trials with LDH, both dextran and HDHE had significantly fewer wound hematomas. LDH administered every 8 hours appeared more effective in reducing DVT than LDH administered every 12 hours; the incidence of wound hematomas was equivalent with both regimens.\r"

  ".W": "As cardiac transplantation becomes more commonplace in the treatment of end-stage heart failure and as suitable donors become less available, an increasing number of patients will require mechanical circulatory assistance to bridge to transplantation. Since 1982, refractory hemodynamic instability requiring placement of pulsatile ventricular assist devices (VADs) has developed in 11 candidates for transplantation aged 24 to 54 years (mean, 39.6 years). A pneumatic Pierce-Donachy pump was used in 9 patients and an electrical Novacor pump in 2. The cause of the cardiomyopathy was ischemic in 6, postpartum in 2, idiopathic in 2, and doxorubicin hydrochloride toxicity in 1. Seven patients required left ventricular support (LVAD); 4 required biventricular mechanical support (BVAD). Duration of support ranged from 8 hours to 91 days with flows ranging from 4.1 to 8.5 L/min (mean, 5.5 L/min). Although hemodynamic stability was achieved in all 11 patients, contraindications to transplantation developed in 5 patients during VAD support (renal failure in 4, sepsis in 3, disseminated intravascular coagulopathy in 1). The remaining 6 patients (4 with an LVAD, 2 with a BVAD) remained good candidates for transplantation despite major complications in 5 (mediastinal bleeding in 3, driveline infection in 3, development of preformed antibodies in 2, small embolic stroke caused by device malfunction in 1). The 3 patients who were supported the longest (24, 75, and 91 days) were ambulatory while awaiting a donor heart. All 6 patients underwent successful transplantation after 8 hours to 91 days (mean, 24 days) of support. Other than one sternal wound infection, there were no major complications after transplantation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Pressure-controlled intermittent coronary sinus occlusion (PICSO) was evaluated in a randomized trial in 30 patients undergoing bypass surgery. PICSO was applied for one hour during early reperfusion. Myocardial function was determined from short-axis cross-sectional views of intraoperative two-dimensional echocardiography. Changes of sectional and segmental wall motion during extracorporeal circulation were analyzed. Although sectional wall motion did not change significantly, hypokinetic segments were preserved better in PICSO-treated patients than in controls (-1.3 +/- 2.4 versus -9.1 +/- 2.6 delta% fractional area change; p less than 0.04). Although not significant, the same trend was found for normal and severely hypokinetic segments. Cumulative enzyme release was related to coronary sinus occluded pressure (r = 0.94; p less than 0.006), indicating washout of metabolites during PICSO. Three months after operation, functional classification was similarly favorable in both groups. Long-term effects of PICSO cannot be predicted because PICSO was applied only during early reperfusion. We conclude that PICSO is a safe procedure and that its short-term beneficial effects on myocardial function suggest a preservation of myocardial viability.\r"
