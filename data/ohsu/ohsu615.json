  ".U": "89040129\r", 
  ".W": "Despite the consensus that national cesarean-section rates are excessive, they continue to rise. Currently, approximately one of every four deliveries is by cesarean section. We developed an initiative to reduce the number of cesarean deliveries to a rate of 11 percent of all deliveries at our inner-city hospital. Participation by attending physicians was voluntary and not linked to any sanction. The program included a stringent requirement for a second opinion, objective criteria for the four most common indications for cesarean section, and a detailed review of all cesarean sections and of individual physicians' rates of performing them. During the first two years of the program, the cesarean-section rate fell from 17.5 percent of 1697 deliveries in 1985 to 11.5 percent of 2301 deliveries in 1987 (P less than 0.05). The proportion of infants with five-minute Apgar scores lower than 7 increased from 3 percent in 1985 to 4.9 percent in 1987 (P less than 0.05), but neither the fetal mortality rate (11.9 per 1000) nor the neonatal mortality rate (11.2 per 1000) in 1987 differed significantly from the rates in 1985. A single maternal death, unrelated to cesarean delivery, occurred during the study. Rates of both primary and repeat cesarean sections decreased, although only the decline in the rate of primary cesarean sections, from 12 to 6.8 percent, was statistically significant (P less than 0.05). During the same period, operative vaginal deliveries (i.e., forceps deliveries and midpelvic procedures) declined from 10.4 to 4.3 percent (P less than 0.05) of total deliveries. We conclude that an initiative within an obstetrics department can reduce cesarean-section rates substantially without adverse effects on the outcome for mother or infant.\r"

On the basis of physiological data, this orientation selectivity is hypothesized as being due at least partially to intracortical inhibitory mechanisms. But this hypothesis has been challenged by intracellular recordings indicating that excitatory inputs themselves are orientation-selective, so inhibition may not contribute to the observed selectivity. Also, there is controversy about the presence of intracortical horizontal connections mediating inhibition for selectivity and about the theoretical validity of such inhibitory connections. Using cross-correlation analysis of the activities of two neurons recorded simultaneously, we find that inhibitory interactions exist between cells with somewhat different, but not orthogonal, orientation preferences. This suggests that intracortical horizontal inhibition operates between 'orientation columns' to sharpen the orientation tuning of cortical neurons.\r"

No neuronal correlate for this cognitive function has so far been described, except that memory traces are thought to be localized in the cerebral cortex; the temporal lobe has been assigned as the site for visual experience because electric stimulation of this area results in imagery recall and lesions produce deficits in visual recognition of objects. We previously reported that in the anterior ventral temporal cortex of monkeys, individual neurons have a sustained activity that is highly selective for a few of the 100 coloured fractal patterns used in a visual working-memory task. Here I report the development of this selectivity through repeated trials involving the working memory. The few patterns for which a neuron was conjointly selective were frequently related to each other through stimulus-stimulus association imposed during training. The results indicate that the selectivity acquired by these cells represents a neuronal correlate of the associative long-term memory of pictures.\r"

  ".W": "Animals have different muscle fibre types: slow fibres with a low maximum velocity of shortening (Vmax) and fast fibres with a high Vmax. An advantage conferred by the use of different fibre types during locomotion has been proposed solely on the basis of their in vitro properties. Isolated muscle experiments show that force generation, mechanical power production and efficiency are all functions of V/Vmax, where V is the velocity of muscle shortening. But it is not known whether animals actually use the different fibres at shortening velocities that are optimal for mechanical power production and efficiency. Here we compare the V of muscle fibres during locomotion with their Vmax. This comparison shows that during slow locomotion, the slow fibres shorten at a velocity that gives peak mechanical power and efficiency and the fast fibres shorten at their optimal velocity when powering maximal movements. Our results also show that maximal movements are impossible without fast fibres because the slow ones cannot shorten rapidly enough.\r"

Myb genes have been identified in a broad range of species, including vertebrates, the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster and the plant Zea mays. The localization of the DNA-binding domain of the v-MYB protein to the highly conserved amino-terminal region suggests that the MYB/DNA interaction is important for MYB function. We show here that v-MYB specifically recognizes the nucleotide sequence pyAACG/TG. So like other nuclear transforming proteins, v-MYB seems to be a member of the class of sequence-specific DNA-binding factors presumably involved in gene regulation.\r"

They provide a good experimental model for the study of convergent evolution at the protein level. One proposal is that pre-existing proteins were recruited as structural eye lens proteins during evolution. This has been confirmed for the vertebrate eye lens structural proteins, or crystallins, which have been intensively studied. Despite the limited information about cephalopod eye lenses, it has been suggested that glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) are a possible evolutionary ancestor of the squid major lens proteins. Recently, the N-terminal sequence of the squid major lens protein was shown to be 55% homologous with that of the Ya subunit of the rat GST. Here, we demonstrate that the squid major lens polypeptides are encoded by a gene family of at least three members. We characterize two cDNAs corresponding to these genes and show they probably either are GST subunits themselves, or share an evolutionary ancestor with them.\r"

A proteolytic fragment of CheA cannot autophosphorylate, but can still transfer phosphate to proteins that generate excitation and adaptation signals. The site of CheA phosphorylation is His 48; mutants altered at this position are non-chemotactic. Similar mechanisms of transient protein phosphorylation and phosphoryl group transfer seem to be involved in processing sensory data and in activating specific gene expression.\r"

  ".U": "89040218\r", 
  ".W": "Schizophrenia is a common disorder with a life time prevalence of approximately 1 per cent. The illness often develops in young adults, who were previously normal, and is characterized by a constellation of symptoms including hallucinations and delusions (psychotic symptoms) and symptoms such as severely inappropriate emotional responses, a disorder of thinking and concentration, erratic behaviour as well as social and occupational deterioration. A considerable proportion of the variance in the liability to develop schizophrenia may be genetic, but segregation analysis, to establish a mode of transmission, has not produced a consistent result. One of these studies was carried out in Iceland and made use of the large family size and extensive geneaological information present in that country. Here we demonstrate genetic linkage of two DNA polymorphisms on the long arm of human chromosome 5 to schizophrenia in seven British and Icelandic families with multiple affected members. The results indicate the existence of a gene locus with a dominant schizophrenia-susceptibility allele. Inheritance of the allele in the families studied suggests that it may also predispose to psychiatric conditions such as schizophrenia spectrum disorders and a variety of other disorders. This report provides the first strong evidence for the involvement of a single gene in the causation of schizophrenia.\r"

  ".W": "Schizophrenia is a severe mental illness with a typically chronic course affecting nearly 1% of the human population. It is generally accepted that genetic factors have an important pathogenic role in a substantial portion of schizophrenia cases; however, despite decades of family studies, there is no agreed-upon mode of inheritance. The discovery of genetic aetiologic factors and resolution of the inheritance pattern(s) will undoubtably emerge from genetic linkage studies. With these objectives in mind, we undertook a linkage project, starting in 1985, in a previously well-documented kindred from north Sweden. Multipoint linkage analyses were used to screen the proximal long arm of chromosome 5 using restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) markers at five loci and the distal long arm using RFLPs at two loci, one of which was the locus for the glucocorticoid receptor. We found strong evidence against linkage between schizophrenia and the seven loci. These results, together with the positive evidence for linkage of schizophrenia with markers in the proximal long arm of chromosome 5 lead us to conclude that the genetic factors underlying schizophrenia are heterogeneous.\r"

  ".W": "The hippocampus, in particular the neocortex-hippocampus-neocortex circuit, is widely believed to be crucial in memory. Information flow in this circuit is strongly influenced by relatively sparse afferents derived from subcortical centres, such as the septum, involved in arousal, emotions and autonomic control. A powerful mechanism, by which numerically small inputs can produce profound effects, is feed-forward inhibition, that is, the activation of local inhibitory interneurons, which, in turn, control the activity of large populations of principal cells in the hippocampus. An example is the cholinergic input to the hippocampus from the septum, which is likely to be involved in feed-forward operations. Here, we demonstrate the existence of a circuit underlying another powerful mechanism of subcortical control of hippocampal information processing. We show that GABA-containing afferents originating in the septum innervate most of the GABA-containing interneurons in the hippocampus, making many synaptic contacts with each of them. Activation of the GABA-containing neurons in the septum is likely to lead to disinhibition of the principal neurons in the hippocampal formation and so this pathway is probably crucial in the induction of hippocampal electrical activity patterns, and may be involved in NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptor-mediated functions, such as memory, in a permissive manner.\r"

This resolution is far superior to that of individual receptors, and it must therefore be achieved through central neuronal mechanisms. It is unclear, however, whether such sensitivity ever emerges at the level of single neurons, or whether it is apparent only at the behavioural level through the collective action of many less-sensitive neurons. We have found that single neurons in the pre-pacemaker nucleus of a weakly electric fish are sensitive to temporal disparities as small as 1 microsecond, the highest temporal sensitivity ever observed at the single-neuron level. The remarkable temporal resolution of these pre-pacemaker neurons results from a high degree of spatial convergence of afferent inputs. These neurons represent the final elements of a sensory hierarchy and directly control the jamming avoidance response by which these fish regulate the frequency of their electric organ discharges.\r"

Laboratory work has shown a decrease in ICP after craniectomy, but also a paradoxical enhancement in the formation of underlying cerebral edema, which may act to the detriment of the patient. Since Rengachary et al. advocated craniectomy for massive cerebral infarction and reported their group of three patients, we have managed five patients with acute supratentorial cerebral infarction who progressed to uncal herniation and impending death from raised ICP and brain stem compression. All were treated with frontotemporal craniectomy after conventional medical therapy failed to achieve a response. All patients survived and are walking, despite a paresis appropriate to their original stroke. Two have returned to work. Good results with supratentorial craniectomy after infarction show that this procedure is life-saving and can also give acceptable functional recovery.\r"

Twenty-one patients had internal carotid artery occlusion, and 14 had middle cerebral artery occlusion. Isovolemic hemodilution combined with venesection and the administration of fresh plasma to reduce the hematocrit (Hct) to 33% was performed within 72 hours of the onset of symptoms. The Hct decreased by 27% and was correlated directly with whole blood viscosity (WBV) at a shear rate of 10 sec-1 after the hemodilution. The cardiac output increased by 29% after hemodilution without significant alterations in cerebral perfusion pressure and showed a good inverse correlation with the Hct and the WBV. The rCBF of the area supplied by the ischemic middle cerebral artery (MCA) increased by 30% and was related inversely to the Hct and the WBV. The cerebrospinal fluid pressure increased by 16%, but no symptoms of raised intracranial pressure were observed. The N20 peak latency of the sensory evoked potential decreased by 5%, and the neurological score was improved by 12%. Isovolemic hemodilution thus resulted in an increase of the rCBF in the area supplied by the affected MCA, leading to significant neurological improvement.\r"

  ".W": "The stainless steel cannula insertion method was applied to investigate the endothelium-dependent relaxation of canine intracranial internal carotid arteries. The arteries were precontracted by extraluminally administrated 0.67 X 10(-4) M 5-hydroxytryptamine or 10(-5) M oxyhemoglobin (oxyHb). There was no significant difference between these groups in the dose-response curves of acetylcholine (ACh)-induced relaxation. The concentration of oxyHb used was enough to abolish the endothelium-dependent relaxation by ACh when administered intraluminally in this preparation. The blocking effect of oxyHb to endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF) did not appear for at least 3 hours after the extraluminal application of 10(-5) M oxyHb. These results suggest that the inactivation of EDRF by oxyHb may not play an important role in producing cerebral vasospasm in the initial stage after subarachnoid hemorrhage.\r"

  ".W": "Excessive mechanical stress on the intervertebral disc may be one of the causes of low back pain. Most studies testing this thesis, however, have been based on quantification of the mechanical response of functional units at failure. Typically, radiography is used to demonstrate trauma to the vertebral body at the failure load. The description of failure and radiographic demonstration of damage are meaningful in specifying the tolerance limits of the structure. It is important, however, to understand the sequence underlying the initiation of injury, which may occur at subfailure physiological loads. In this study, we identified the initiation of injury to the lumbar spine by subjecting functional units to axial compressive loads using the mechanical response as a basis. Because conventional radiography failed to detect trauma at this level, advanced sectioning techniques were used. The initiation of injury (microtrauma) is defined as the point on the load-deflection curve where the structure exhibits a decreasing level of resistance for the first time before reaching its ultimate load-carrying capacity. The load deflection curve on this basis was classified into the ambient or preload phase, physiological loading phase, traumatic phase, and post-traumatic phase. Structures loaded to the end of the physiological loading phase did not exhibit any yielding or microtrauma. Injury in the form of microfractures of the endplate not detected on radiography, however, was observed under cryomicrotomy for structures loaded into the traumatic loading phase.\r"

The various histological subtypes also seemed to be distinct in their tendency to induce edema, with the transitional and meningotheliomatous subtypes associated with the more severe grades of edema. There was no correlation between grade of edema and location of the tumor. Contact of the edematous area or the tumor itself with the ventricle, which is relevant to the possibility of drainage of edema fluid into the ventricle, seemed to occur in cases of the more severe grades of edema rather than in cases showing slight or no edema.\r"

The cytoplasm surrounding the intracytoplasmic lumina was electron-dense and contained tonofilaments and desmosomal junctions. All three meningiomas showed expression of carcinoembryonic antigen, cytokeratin, and epithelial membrane antigen in the cells surrounding the hyaline bodies. Keratin, alpha-1-antitrypsin, and immunoglobulin M showed weak positive staining. There was widespread vimentin except in the cells with hyaline inclusions. Glial fibrillary acidic protein and S100 were negative. These results provide additional confirmation of immunohistochemical data that can serve as evidence for epithelial and secretory differentiation in meningiomas.\r"

In an effort to accrue further comprehensive in vitro data on this subject, we have evaluated 50 human brain and spinal tumors for estrogen, progesterone, and androgen receptor markers. Twenty-nine of the 50 tumors were meningiomas. The other 21 included 11 gliomas of various grades, 5 schwannomas, 3 metastatic carcinomas, 1 angiofibroma, and 1 craniopharyngioma. Only 8 tumors, all meningiomas, were positive for both progesterone and androgen receptors. The 8th tumor was positive for all three receptor proteins. Our study did not find a significant relationship between meningiomas and the presence of steroid receptor protein. We conclude that the use of antiestrogen agents is not indicated in the treatment of meningioma. No significant relationship to sex, menopausal status, tumor type, or tumor location was observed.\r"

  ".W": "Hyperthermia has emerged as an adjunct to other forms of brain tumor therapy. Interstitial microwave irradiation is an effective method of inducing localized brain hyperthermia. One of the problems with this technique, however, is the overheating of tissue adjacent to the antenna. In this study, a cooling system for the interstitial microwave antenna was developed for the purpose of providing uniform and accurate heating by the elimination of overheating. The ability to generate more uniform hyperthermic fields was evaluated in normal monkey brains. Six monkeys under general anesthesia and controlled respiration underwent parietooccipital craniectomies 4 x 4 cm in size. The antenna cooling system was constructed of a silicone tube 5.0 mm in outer diameter. Silicone-coated interstitial microwave antennae 1.5 mm in diameter were used. A single antenna or a square array (1.6 cm on a side) of 4 antennae was inserted into the brain with the coupled system to a depth of 2 cm. The brain tissue was heated by 2450-MHz microwave irradiation. Temperature distributions were mapped using nonperturbing thermocouples. These thermal profiles were compared with those generated without the cooling system. In the experiments with the single antenna, the antenna cooling system eliminated the overheating and rapid radial falloff in temperature, without a reduction of the hyperthermic field. In the four-antennae experiments using the cooling system, the thermal field was dramatically flattened with minimal reduction in size; however, the area maintained at a therapeutic temperature range (42-45 degrees C) was significantly enlarged by the cooling system.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Computed tomography and angiography have been relatively insensitive in imaging the tumor either at presentation or during the postoperative period. The authors present three patients with histologically proven Lhermitte-Duclos disease who have undergone magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In the first case, preoperative T1- and T2-weighted images clearly demonstrated the location and extent of the lesion, which was verified at operation. In the other two cases, only postoperative images were obtained. These demonstrated the extent of residual tumor and indicate a high probability of lesion expansion during periods of 4 and 10 years, respectively.

In this study, we investigated the effects of (S)-emopamil on the histopathologic consequences of permanent middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion in anesthetized Sprague-Dawley rats. In three treatment protocols, intraperitoneal (S)-emopamil therapy was begun either 30 minutes prior to, immediately after, or 1 hour after MCA occlusion. Nontreated and saline-treated control groups were also studied. Cortical infarct volumes in nontreated and saline-treated control rats were 85 +/- 22 and 66 +/- 19 mm3 (mean +/- SD), respectively, and did not differ statistically from one another. Corresponding cortical infarct volume values in (S)-emopamil-pretreated rats, and in rats with post-treatment at 0 hours and 1 hour, were 33 +/- 23, 29 +/- 14, and 27 +/- 16 mm3, respectively; each of these was significantly smaller than control values. In contrast to the neocortex, striatal infarct volume was not altered by (S)-emopamil treatment. The results of this study demonstrate the marked therapeutic efficacy of (S)-emopamil in focal cortical infarction, even when treatment is delayed for 1 hour following MCA occlusion.\r"

Eleven percent of patients (135/1,203) without stroke history had ischemic lesions on their first CT, unrelated to the presenting stroke. Stroke Data Bank files were reviewed to determine whether the occurrence, location, and CT characteristics of those lesions are associated with their undetected status. Two distinct patterns were seen: (1) Small lesions of 1 cm or less were left hemisphere predominant and involved the deep structures of the brain; the majority of these were clinically silent. (2) Lesions greater than 1 cm occurred more frequently in the right hemisphere and were mostly superficial; these infarcts produced signs unrecognized by the patient or family. Risk factors for silent stroke were similar to those for stroke in general. Frequencies of in-hospital complications and 30-day fatality rates from the presenting stroke were not influenced by the existence of a prior silent stroke.\r"

Many neuritic plaques are found in the amygdala, which also receives dense cholinergic innervation from the ventral forebrain, predominantly to the basolateral complex. To determine whether the regional distribution of neuritic plaques is related to the pattern of cholinergic innervation, we studied serial sections through the amygdala of four patients with Alzheimer's disease and four neurologically normal patients. We compared acetylcholinesterase reactivity, neuritic plaques stained with thioflavine S, and cytoarchitectural features in adjacent sections. Neuritic plaque counts were high in most amygdaloid nuclei but were significantly lower in the most acetylcholinesterase-positive region, the lateral portion of the basal nucleus of the amygdala. Acetylcholinesterase reactivity was reduced in the Alzheimer's cases, but the basal nucleus was easily recognized by the characteristic large neurons. The morphology of neuritic plaques also differed in the various regions. These results show that neuritic plaques occur to varying degrees in all nuclei of the amygdala, but are significantly less frequent in the region that receives the most prominent innervation from the cholinergic ventral forebrain.\r"

Angiography was performed in 17 cases and was completely normal in eight. MRI revealed mixed signal intensity centrally with a ring of decreased signal intensity peripherally on T2-weighted images and was diagnostic in five cases.

In the three patients who had complete mapping of all three fields, the average distance of localizations from central fissure was approximately 4 mm in both MEG and EEG, 3 mm in ECoG, and 3 mm in combined MEG and EEG. MEG was simpler than EEG, which was simpler than ECoG. MEG resolved ambiguities in both EEG and ECoG.

The CT lesions were in the brainstem (8 patients), basal ganglia (7), thalamus (4), or hemispheric white matter (7). Of the 13 patients who received contrast, nine had lesions that showed enhancement. In five, lesions were visualized with contrast that were not apparent without it. The CT lesions were usually accompanied by corresponding clinical deficits, although in some patients deficits were more extensive than the CT predicted. In nine patients, contrast enhancement decreased or disappeared over days to weeks, often with associated clinical improvement. In eight patients followed serially, CT abnormalities resolved completely or substantially. Based on these cases, we conclude that (1) CT abnormalities of gray and white matter occur commonly in neuro-Behcet's disease with focal deficits, and help support the diagnosis; (2) CT abnormalities, particularly contrast enhancement, correlate well with the activity of parenchymal disease; and (3) the concomitant improvement of clinical and CT abnormalities with resolution of contrast enhancement suggests that partially reversible inflammatory changes associated with breakdown of the blood-brain barrier may produce some of the neurologic and radiographic deficits in this illness.\r"

The onset was acute in 57 patients, gradual in 35, and indeterminate in 11. Of the 116 lesions, 64 were solely axonal loss in type, 23 manifested as conduction block, presumably secondary to focal demyelination, and 29 were a mixture of the two. Contrary to common belief, the pathophysiology was predominantly axonal loss regardless of etiology, including those that developed perioperatively. The peroneal motor nerve conduction study, recording tibialis anterior muscle, was the single most important electrophysiologic study; it localized all 52 lesions causing conduction block at the fibular head. In contrast, peroneal motor conduction velocity along the knee-to-fibular head segment was seldom abnormal, with slowing in only five of the 52 cases.\r"

We did not see this type of change in matched controls nor in stable multiple sclerosis studied serially. When clinical attacks appeared, there was no significant change in immune function. We conclude that changes in immune function correlate well with the activity of the disease as recognized by MRI. We suspect that decreased natural killer cell function, immunoglobulin G secretion in vitro, and concanavalin A-induced suppression are secondary to the large lesions recognized by MRI.\r"

The alteration of consciousness, the long-tract neurologic signs, and the esotropia quickly resolved. Upgaze paresis and brief bursts of convergence-retraction nystagmus were the major residual signs. Imaging techniques demonstrated lesions of the contralateral posterior thalamus in each patient. Several mechanisms are proposed to explain the acute esotropia. Impairment of monocular projections in the contralateral posterior thalamus could disinhibit neurons in the oculomotor complex, or ischemia of inputs to neurons involved with vergence control in the midbrain could result in tonic activation of the medial rectus. The clinical and radiographic findings are consistent with infarction in the territory of penetrating branches of the basilar-communicating (mesencephalic) artery. Embolism to the top of the basilar artery is presumed to be the precipitating event.\r"

The intracarotid sodium amytal procedure (ISA, or Wada test) offers the opportunity to investigate differential effects for symmetric acute dysfunction of each cerebral hemisphere in each subject. In the present study, 18 patients undergoing preoperative evaluation for epilepsy surgery were trained in a nonverbal task of tactile attention. Left/right mean ISA dosages and left/right tactile test times postinjection were matched. Results revealed more correct responses following left ISA, and greater tactile inattention with more extinction-type responses following right ISA. No effect of seizure focus, sex, order of injection, or dosage was present. The finding that tactile inattention occurs more frequently with right cerebral dysfunction is consistent with right cerebral dominance for scanning attentional mechanisms directed at the external milieu.\r"

The aim of the study was to document the value of P-ERG regarding diagnosis and prognosis of four types of optic neuropathy: optic neuritis, compressive or hereditary optic atrophy, and traumatic optic neuropathy. We documented visual loss by neuro-ophthalmologic examination and recorded pattern-reversal visual evoked potentials (P-VEP). The initial P-ERG was normal to large- and medium-sized checks in 89% and the P-VEP abnormal in 94% of eyes with acute optic nerve lesions. Forty-six eyes were followed for up to 2 years. Two groups emerged. Group A (n = 17) gradually and permanently had significant reduction of the P-ERG to three separate check sizes. All 17 had no improvement in acuity better than 20/100, retained centrocecal scotomas, and developed optic atrophy. In group B (n = 29) the P-ERG remained within normal limits to one or more check sizes. Twenty-two of these eyes recovered acuity to 20/25 or better and had resolution of the field defect. The data showed that P-VEP was superior to P-ERG in diagnosis of acute and chronic optic nerve lesions. However, significant reduction of the b-wave of the P-ERG to three separate check sizes correlated closely with failure of visual recovery and the eventual development of severe optic atrophy, suggesting a prognostic value for P-ERG in optic neuropathy.\r"

Plasma antisynaptosomal IgG is taken up to a much greater extent than nonspecific IgG by motoneurons that project outside the blood-brain barrier, as is radiolabeled antisynaptosomal IgG injected intramuscularly. Competition with unlabeled antisynaptosomal IgG inhibits the uptake of radiolabeled antisynaptosomal IgG. By contrast, competition with unlabeled nonspecific IgG does not inhibit the uptake of radiolabeled nonspecific IgG. These results support the hypothesis that certain neurons in the CNS take up IgG from the systemic circulation, and that IgG which binds to elements of the synaptic plasma membrane is taken up in greater amounts than nonspecific IgG through a process of adsorptive endocytosis at the nerve terminus. An increase in intraneuronal IgG may serve as an index of the action of antineuronal IgG at the presynaptic membrane.\r"

No patient developed weakness beyond the neck muscles or decrement of the biceps response to repetitive 3-Hz nerve stimulation. Between the baseline and the last follow-up study, the average of mean MCD increased from 29 microseconds to 38 microseconds (31%). Mean fiber density increased concurrently or earlier from 1.35 to 1.79 (33%). There were no electrophysiologic signs of presynaptic blockade, even at 2 and 4 weeks. The effects we observed are compatible with stimulation of terminal sprouting by the neurotoxin, without significant presynaptic inhibition of acetylcholine release.

Anti-AChR specificities present in the serum were broadly unchanged in 16 non-thymoma and six thymoma patients 7-30 months after thymectomy compared with an initial sample, although total anti-AChR frequently fell. The fine specificities of the anti-AChR synthesized in vitro by cultured lymphocytes from the thymus of ten patients (without thymoma) correlated significantly with that of the anti-AChR in the serum at the same time.

CS was a valuable adjunct to perimetry in PTC whereas VEP was rarely helpful.\r"

We focused on the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) which has been recommended as the most useful scale for rating impairment by the International Federation of Multiple Sclerosis Societies in its Minimal Record of Disability for Multiple Sclerosis. We consider that the EDSS has important flaws that seriously limit its usefulness. In light of the widely accepted three-tier classification of dysfunction developed by the World Health Organization, the title is inappropriate. More substantial problems include inadequate precision in defining the degree of impairment in some functional categories of the scale, and the use of a mixture of neurologic signs elicited on examination and subjective information obtained from the patient in defining the overall scale. We suggest guidelines for developing a \"Neurologic Impairment Scale\" to rate impairment in MS.\r"

Ninety-five percent of these patients were receiving medication at the time of discharge. Antihypertensives were the most commonly prescribed agents in the study population, and platelet antiaggregants were second. Sixty-four percent of patients had a change in their antihypertensive regimens. The number of patients prescribed sedative-hypnotic agents doubled over the first 48 hours after hospital admission.

Fifty-three (35%) received 500 mg ampicillin orally every 6 hours, 50 (33%) received 500 mg erythromycin orally every 6 hours, and 47 served as controls. Antibiotics were prescribed for 10 days, and the treatment was not altered by the results of cervical cultures. Of these 150 patients, 16 (11%) had positive amniotic fluid cultures. The pregnancies with positive amniotic fluid culture were characterized by significantly less time gained after admission (2.6 versus 28.7 days) and lower birth weight (1262 versus 2470 g) than in those with negative cultures. Histologic studies of the placenta revealed chorioamnionitis in 22 (16%) of 134 patients with negative amniotic fluid cultures; these pregnancies were associated with less time gained after admission (12.5 versus 31.9 days) and lower birth weight (1680 versus 2618 g) compared with pregnancies without histologic chorioamnionitis. In patients with similar gestational age and cervical dilation, the adjunctive use of antibiotic therapy resulted in a statistically significant delay from admission to delivery (30 versus 17 days). In cases of negative amniotic fluid cultures, cervical colonization with group B streptococcus and/or Gardnerella vaginalis increased the risk of prematurity, which improved significantly when ampicillin was given.\r"

We simultaneously acquired and analyzed FHR baseline, frequency of accelerations between ten to 14 beats per minute and more than 15 beats per minute in amplitude, percent of time spent in breathing and moving, and fetal breath rate. These biophysical parameters were not significantly different between the groups, implying that they may continue to provide clinically useful information in the prelabor period.\r"

Forty-seven preeclamptic women were studied within the 2-day interval before delivery. Creatinine did not correlate significantly with any of the other study parameters. However, there were significant correlations between antithrombin III activity and platelet count (r = 0.53, P less than .005) and between antithrombin III and fibrinopeptide A (r = -0.29, P less than .05). The correlation between platelet count and fibrinopeptide A was not significant. These findings support the hypothesis that antithrombin III consumption by fibrin generation is initiated by platelet activation, and is at least one cause of the low activity level known to occur in women with preeclampsia.\r"

The risk of uterine fibroids was reduced in parous women relative to nulliparous ones (relative risk 0.6) and in those who were postmenopausal (relative risk 0.1 compared with premenopausal women of the same age). Women with fibroids tended to have an earlier age at menarche and at the last birth, to be more educated, and to use intrauterine devices and oral contraceptives more frequently, although these findings were not statistically significant. Current smoking (but not past smoking) lowered the fibroid risk by about 40%. No associations were found with body mass index, history of spontaneous or induced abortions, and age at first birth.\r"

Twenty-four pathogen-free New Zealand white rabbits underwent total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy using either chromic suture or copolymer staple to close the vaginal cuff. Aerobic and anaerobic cultures were obtained from the peritoneal cavity upon entering, and from the vaginal cuff during the initial operation and on postoperative day 3 or 8. When compared with chromic suture, stapling of the vaginal cuff during hysterectomy did not result in significant reduction of postoperative bacteria isolated from the vaginal cuff or peritoneal cavity. In addition, copolymer staples were associated with histologic evidence of more extensive necrosis and cellular exudate while significantly increasing adhesion formation between the vaginal apex and surrounding viscera. Stapling the vaginal cuff does not significantly reduce bacterial count after hysterectomy, significantly increases adhesion formation, and may interfere with normal wound healing in an animal model.\r"

Eight of the subjects had recurrent or persistent genuine stress incontinence (group 1), seven had detrusor instability (group 2), and seven had normal continence and detrusor function (group 3). In addition, we evaluated ten subjects with detrusor instability but no previous surgery (group 4). There were clear and significant differences in pressure transmission ratios between the four groups. These differences suggest that subjects in group 1 have the same basic mechanisms of incontinence (ie, inefficient pressure transmission to the urethra as reflected by pressure transmission ratios less than 90%) as do never-operated women with genuine stress incontinence. Subjects in group 2 had pressure transmission ratios that were significantly higher than those in either group 3 or 4. This supports the hypothesis that obstruction may play a role in post-continence surgery detrusor instability, but not in idiopathic detrusor instability. Group 2 subjects had pressure transmission ratios very close to the ideal of 100%. We postulate that continence procedures that consistently result in pressure transmission ratios close to 100% should have the greatest chance for success without inducing complications.\r"

However, its clinical significance has not been elucidated. During 6 months, 56 patients with this pattern were identified, representing 4% of all deliveries during this period. These were compared with a control group of 500 consecutive low-risk term patients who had been monitored electronically. The lambda pattern generally appeared early in labor and lasted for a variable period of time, but rarely persisted throughout labor. The relative rates of low Apgar scores, cesarean sections, and associated nonreassuring FHR patterns were similar between the two groups. The timing or depth of the decelerative portion of the pattern did not appear to correlate with any adverse outcome. Therefore, it does not appear that the lambda pattern is associated with any adverse outcome, nor does it predict the development of other concerning FHR patterns.\r"

Acidemia with normal variability was found only in conjunction with severe variable decelerations, and may represent respiratory acidosis. In this group, two of nine acidemic fetuses demonstrated no decelerations (pH 7.04) or mild variable decelerations only (pH 7.19). The absence of late decelerations was not as reliable as the presence of accelerations in the prediction of fetal well-being. Thirty-three percent of the fetuses who failed to exhibit spontaneous or provoked FHR accelerations were acidemic. These findings suggest that in this high-risk group of fetuses, the absence of spontaneous FHR accelerations should be followed by an attempt to induce accelerations, scalp pH assessment, or cesarean section.\r"

  ".W": "Two hundred seventy-two twin pregnancies were studied by analysis of the fetal umbilical artery waveforms recorded using continuous-wave Doppler ultrasound. After the first 100 cases, a management strategy was adopted whereby all twin gestations would be studied between 28-32 weeks' gestation and the results made available to the referring obstetrician, thereby influencing clinical management. Perinatal mortality and morbidity, in pregnancies with both fetuses alive at 28 weeks' gestation, were compared between the patients studied in the first group of 100 and those studied after the Doppler examination was introduced as a clinical service. There was a decrease in perinatal mortality, both uncorrected (57.9 per 1000 to 17.9 per 1000; P less than .05) and corrected (42.1 per 1000 to 8.9 per 1000). Fetal deaths were reduced from six to one (P less than .05). This decrease in perinatal mortality was achieved without any appreciable change in the gestational age at delivery or mode of delivery between the two groups. There was a reduction in the number of infants requiring neonatal intensive care (from 38% to 24%; P less than .01).\r"

The subtypes included endocervical (60), adenosquamous (38), papillary (15), clear cell (nine), and mucoid (three). The cumulative 5-year survival was 60%, and was significantly related to the following: tumor differentiation--well-differentiated 80%, moderately differentiated 69%, poorly differentiated 41%; lymph node status--nodes positive 28%, nodes negative 82%; the amount of residual disease present in the cervix after radical hysterectomy; and the interval from the previous pelvic examination. Survival was not significantly influenced by histologic subtype, patient age, number of positive lymph nodes, or tumor size beyond 3 cm. Treatment included radical hysterectomy with or without bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, radiation therapy, radiation therapy with hysterectomy, and hysterectomy followed by radiation therapy. The best cumulative 5-year survival (93%) was found in patients treated by radical hysterectomy without bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, whereas the poorest survival (18%) was in those treated by standard hysterectomy followed by radiation therapy. Ovarian conservation seems to be an acceptable alternative to bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy in the young patient undergoing radical hysterectomy.\r"

The goals of this program were as follows: 1) to facilitate patient participation by decreasing travel expenditures, time for screening appointments, and IVF cycle cancellations, and 2) to involve community physicians in a regionalized program. We established centers in nine cities within the Washington, Alaska, Montana, and Idaho region serviced by the University of Washington, and in Alberta, Canada. A 2-day training session was held to provide participating physicians with a basic knowledge of IVF. We considered the roles of the satellite IVF physician to include identification of couples for IVF, initiation of ovulation induction cycles, and determination of appropriate induction cycles for oocyte recovery. The staff of the University Department of Laboratory Medicine standardized the methodologies for estradiol measurements and maintained a quality control analysis for all participating community laboratories. Satellite activity was coordinated through the IVF office at the University, which monitored physicians' decisions based on hormone and ultrasound data from days 7 and 8 of the stimulation cycle. Patients meeting specific ovarian response criteria arrived at the University on day 9 of the stimulation cycle and completed IVF. During 18 months, 72 patients were screened and initiated cycles at the nine participating centers. Forty-four of these patients were sent to the University for oocyte recovery, which resulted in 39 embryo transfers and eight pregnancies. This service has reached a large geographic community, dramatically reduced the cost of IVF for this community, and met with both patient and physician acceptance.\r"

It is intended to provide a quantitative assessment of the passive supports of the uterus relatively independent of the active striated muscles in the pelvis. The measurements were made by connecting to the cervix a uterine insufflation cannula with a ruler attached to it and measuring the distance from the hymen to the ectocervix while varying amounts of downward traction were applied to a tenaculum with a spring scale. In 73 asymptomatic patients, the cervix lay above the hymen by the following distance with the amount of traction stated: 0 lb = 3.50 cm, 1 lb = 2.35 cm, 2 lb = 1.65 cm, 3 lb = 1.16 cm, and 4 lb = 0.81 cm. In 22 patients examined independently by two examiners, the mean difference between these measurements was 0.29 cm, and the correlation coefficient for their measurements at each level of traction ranged from 0.86-0.94, depending on the amount of force applied. This technique of measurement could be used to study the influence of such factors as age, race, parity, menopausal status, and obstetric history on the integrity of the passive support system within a population, and can provide a way to obtain objective data to study further the passive supports of the uterus.\r"

  ".W": "Recent studies have demonstrated lower cost and morbidity associated with laparoscopic treatment of ectopic pregnancy. However, the applicability of these techniques to unselected cases of ectopic pregnancy has not yet been proved. To test the efficiency of the laparoscopic approach, an attempt was made to apply these techniques to all patients who presented with ectopic pregnancy at a medical center during a 6-month period and who met the entry criteria of hemodynamic stability; location other than abdominal with fetus, interstitial, or cervical; and visibility of the mesosalpinx. None of the 22 patients referred to the study had to be excluded because of these criteria, indicating the relative infrequency of these contraindications. All were treated successfully by laparoscopic salpingectomy (N = 12), salpingostomy (N = 8), or removal of implantations from peritoneal surfaces (N = 2). The average size of the ectopic gestation was 3.9 cm, the average amount of hemoperitoneum was 168 mL, the average additional blood loss attributable to the procedure was 30 mL, and the average drop in hematocrit postoperatively was 4.7%. The average hospital stay was 1.1 days, and patients were released for work in 1-2 weeks. An analysis of the three patients not referred to the study indicated that they may have been appropriate candidates for laparoscopic resection. This study indicates that the majority of unselected patients with ectopic pregnancy may be treated by laparoscopic procedures, with low cost and low morbidity.\r"

The device was used successfully in two obstetric patients with life-threatening intraoperative hemorrhage, one with abdominal pregnancy and the other with postpartum hemorrhage. The patients received autotransfusions of 1700 and 2200 mL, respectively, without incident. Advantages of autotransfusion over banked blood include avoidance of alloimmunization, reduction of transfusion reactions and blood-borne infections, less expense, and acceptance by most religious groups. Disadvantages include potential hemolysis and limited usefulness in the presence of bacterial contamination or malignancy. On balance, the benefits of autotransfusion outweigh the risks.\r"

The increase in the rate of RVO by age was less dramatic in the glaucoma clinic population. The two populations also differed in the frequency of the occlusion type: the ratio of the rate of branch vein occlusion to central vein occlusion was 3.2:1 in the general population, but equally distributed in the glaucoma clinic population. Persons with increased intraocular pressure and/or glaucoma were found to have a higher prevalence of RVO than persons with no history of elevated intraocular pressure.\r"

Orbital irradiation was administered to 39 patients of whom all except 4 had been treated previously with steroids. Six months later, 25 patients (64%) had responded favourably (excellent in 0, good in 9 and fair in 16 subjects) and 14 patients had not responded (36%). A favourable response to prednisone or irradiation was reflected in a general shift to lower grades in each of the classes 2-6 of the NOSPECS system. Responders were not different from non-responders with regard to age, sex, NOSPECS classification, ophthalmopathy index, interval between the onset of eye disease (or of thyroid disease if present) and the start of treatment, or the presence of thyroid disease. In conclusion, (1) the ratio of responders to non-responders is 2:1 for both prednisone treatment and orbital irradiation in Graves' ophthalmopathy, (2) the response is seen in all classes of the NOSPECS system, and (3) the response is not dependent on age, sex, severity or duration of eye disease, or the presence of thyroid disease.\r"

Although the saccadic dysmetria caused by ocular lateropulsion was recorded during memory-guided saccades in the same manner as visually guided saccades, the eyes reached precisely the intended position by corrective saccades. The mean latency of corrective saccades was significantly longer than that of corrective saccades observed for visually guided saccades. This long latency of corrective saccades supports the assumption that feedback information of the eye position is a signal generated by orbital afferents rather than a copy of the motor command.\r"

The nasal quadrants were more frequently affected than the temporal ones (p less than 0.001) and the upper quadrants were also more affected than the lower ones, especially in the cornea (p less than 0.001). Fifty-two percent had intraocular foreign bodies; industrial accidents were responsible of 65% of these injuries. They were significantly more frequent in summer than in autumn (p less than 0.001) and spring (p less than 0.01). We discuss the prognosis of these injuries and the circumstances that may influence in their occurrence, stressing the importance of prevention programs.\r"

Anatomic rigid reduction allows more precise control and stabilization of the midfacial bone fragments, particularly the frontal process of the maxilla and the medial canthal region. In addition, rigid fixation aids in preventing inferomedial displacement of the zygomatic complex by the masseter muscle. The vertical dimension of the midface can be reestablished and stabilized by bone plate fixation without the need for suspension wires. Immediate opening of the mouth afforded by rigid fixation facilitates safe airway management, patient comfort, better oral hygiene, and speech and may circumvent the need for tracheostomy when concomitant nasal fractures are present.\r"

Four juvenile male Macaca mulatta underwent mandibular surgery and 5 weeks of maxillomandibular fixation as part of a study of temporomandibular joint (TMJ) adaptations after condylar replacement. Immediately before the time the animals were killed (5 weeks postsurgically), biopsies of the masseter and temporalis muscles were obtained and submitted to histochemical analysis and calculation of muscle-fiber areas. The data were compared to histochemistry from 12 juvenile control Macaca mulatta. Significant decreases in mean cross-sectional area were exhibited in both type I (p less than 0.05) and type II (p less than 0.01) fibers in all muscles when compared to controls (n = 12). The ratio of type I to type II fibers, however, remained constant during maxillomandibular fixation in masseter and temporalis muscle samples, indicating no change in relative types of fibers. We conclude from this experimental investigation that (1) significant atrophy occurs in the temporalis and masseter muscles after 5 weeks of maxillomandibular fixation, and (2) this atrophy occurs in both type I and type II fibers, indicating that overall recruitment of the muscle (and not just of one fiber type of motor unit) was affected during fixation.\r"

The tumor cells forming narrow, anastomosing trabecular cords in histologic sections were almost exclusively well-differentiated myoepithelial cells when examined with the electron microscope. Adenoidal regions within and between the columns of tumor cells resulted from the production of excessive amounts of basal lamina and glycosaminoglycans. In one focal region, glandular lumina were formed within the trabecular cords and more solid regions of the tumor. By both immunohistochemistry (anticytokeratins and anti-S 100 protein) and electron microscopy, transitions from the principal tumor cells comprising the trabecular cords (myoepithelial cells) to luminal epithelial cells could be detected. Since the patient is free of recurrence or metastases 7 years after limited surgical resection of the tumor, the designation of polymorphous low-grade adenocarcinoma seems quite appropriate.\r"

  ".W": "Freshly extracted teeth with single canals were instrumented and filled with laterally condensed gutta-percha and sealer. After obturation, the tooth apices were treated with various retrograde techniques. The sealing ability of these techniques, namely laterally condensed gutta-percha, heat-sealed gutta-percha, and silver amalgam retrofilling, was compared on the basis of dye penetration. The apical foramen of the treated canals was then coated with different sealing materials--HelioSeal (light-activated sealant), Delton pit and fissure sealant (chemically activated sealant), and varnish--to examine their effect on the leakage resistance of these materials. Statistical analysis indicated that laterally condensed gutta-percha, as well as retrograde amalgam filling, produced a statistically significantly better seal than heat-sealed gutta-percha. Coating of the apical foramen with different sealing materials showed that HelioSeal had significantly improved the sealing capacity of all the materials tested at each time period. Delton pit and fissure sealant did not increase the sealing ability in the first week. However, this material has significantly improved the sealing ability after the first week. On the other hand, sealing of the apical foramen with varnish did not produce any significant change in the sealing capacity of the filling materials. Finally, dye penetration around all the filling and retrofilling materials, in the presence or absence of the apical seal, continued and increased with time. However, root canals sealed with Helioseal consistently showed the least amount of apical leakage of all the canals tested.\r"

  ".W": "Psychophysical experiments were carried out on 7 human participants to determine the extent to which experimentally produced first or second pain is reduced by concomitant nociceptive stimulation of body regions remote from those at which test stimuli are presented. This form of pain reduction has been termed diffuse noxious inhibitory controls (DNIC). Test stimuli used to evoke first and second pain consisted of intense electrical pulses delivered to the ankle area by subepithelial electrodes. Conditioning stimuli were 10 sec thermal stimuli (43, 47, 51 degrees C) applied to 1 cm2 areas of skin of either the dorsal surface of the contralateral foot or the abdominal region. The perceived magnitudes of first and second pains evoked by test stimuli were rated on visual analogue scales (VAS). Frankly noxious conditioning thermal stimuli (47 and 51 degrees C), but not innocuous thermal stimuli (43 degrees C), applied to the contralateral foot or abdomen reliably inhibited both first and second pain. However, the degree of inhibition was significantly greater for second pain that for first pain. In addition, the inhibitory effects did not outlast the duration of the conditioning stimulus. All of these results closely parallel electrophysiological observations about DNIC in primates. Since the extent of reduction of first pain is relatively weak and the durations of all inhibitory effects are very brief, it is unlikely that DNIC subserves the functions of relieving pain or providing a mechanism of coding pain. The spatial and temporal pattern of DNIC indicates that it may be a phenomenon associated more with the organization and production of withdrawal reflexes than with the relief of pain or pain coding.\r"

  ".W": "Pain and detection thresholds to short CO2 laser pulses were studied in healthy human subjects. Pain thresholds were significantly higher than detection thresholds in both hairy and glabrous skin; in the glabrous skin both thresholds were higher in the hairy skin. The range from detection threshold to pain threshold was larger in the glabrous skin. The minimal energy per surface area needed to produce any sensation (detection) or pain sensation decreased with increasing stimulus surface, and this spatial summation effect was to equal magnitude in the hairy and the glabrous skin. With decreasing stimulus pulse duration (from 45 to 15 msec) the detection and pain thresholds were elevated: this effect was stronger on pain thresholds. With increasing adapting skin temperature, less energy was needed to produce any sensation (detection) or pain sensation. The effect of adapting skin temperature was equal on pain and detection thresholds. The conduction velocity of fibers mediating laser evoked first sensations was in the thin fiber range (less than 10 msec), according to a reaction time study. The results suggest that short CO2 laser pulses produce both non-pain and pain sensations, but that both these sensations are based on the activation of the same primary afferent fiber population of slowly conducting nociceptive fibers. Central summation of primary afferent impulses is needed to elicit a liminal non-painful sensation, and an increased number of impulses in the same fibers produces pain.\r"

Although various studies have failed to support this concept, it has been reported that in conditions of both experimentally induced and clinical pain, high doses of the opioid antagonist naloxone induced a state of hyperalgesia and thus seemed to set off this hypothetical system. Lower doses were, however, without effect or even acted as analgesics. This study investigated the effect of 5 and 20 mg naloxone i.v., compared to placebo, on the perception of pain in healthy humans. Pain was induced by two methods, using electrical and thermal stimulation of the skin, which have previously been shown to be sensitive to the effects of opioid as well as of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory analgesics. Each of 12 males and 12 females participated in 3 experimental sessions, in which the treatments were administered double-blind according to a Latin square design. Threshold and tolerance to electrically induced pain and threshold to thermally induced pain were measured at 30 min intervals for 90 min before and 90 min after drug administration. Electrical stimuli were square wave constant current impulses of linearly increasing intensity; thermal stimuli were of constant intensity and variable duration. Threshold and tolerance to electrically induced pain were not altered by either dose of naloxone, whereas the threshold to thermally induced pain was significantly higher after both 5 and 20 mg naloxone than after placebo, the effects of the two naloxone doses not differing from each other.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Visual analog ratings were significantly lower in dysmenorrheic women during the follicular than the luteal phase. Also, these ratings were lower than those of non-dysmenorrheic women in the follicular phase. This finding may support an adaptation-levels model, in that dysmenorrheic women report less pain than do non-dysmenorrheic women because they compare cold pressor pain with internal menstrual pain.\r"

  ".U": "89041227\r", 
  ".W": "In order to determine which classes of spinal neurons are capable of mediating sympathetically maintained pain, recordings were made from single somatosensory neurons in spinal cords of anesthetized cats. Each neuron was functionally identified with mechanical stimuli, and its responses to electrical stimulation of the sympathetic trunk were recorded. Nearly half (45%) of the wide-dynamic-range (WDR) neurons tested were activated by sympathetic stimulation, but none of the high threshold (nociceptor-specific) neurons and only 17% of the low threshold neurons were activated. Sympathetic activation was most common for WDR neurons that had the following: receptive fields proximal to the toes, low thresholds for mechanical activation, and both rapidly and slowly adapting responses to pressure. The predominant WDR response to sympathetic stimulation was long latency (greater than 1 sec) excitation. Sympathetic activation of WDR neurons was abolished by each of the following procedures: subcutaneous injection of local anesthetic, cooling of the receptive field with ice, and intravenous injection of the alpha-adrenergic blocker, phentolamine. The axons of some sympathetically activated WDR were shown to project to higher centers. These results indicate that WDR neurons are the only spinal nociceptive neurons activated by sympathetic efferent activity in this preparation. Therefore, WDR neurons, rather than high threshold neurons, are most likely to mediate the spinal component of sympathetically maintained pain. These results provide supporting evidence for our previous hypothesis that sympathetically maintained pain is mediated by myelinated mechanoreceptors acting on sensitized WDR neurons. Our results also demonstrate that sympathetic activation of WDR neurons is mediated by an alpha-adrenergic mechanism in the skin.\r"

The experimental approach was to record and compare activity evoked in single WDR neurons, hair afferents, and slowly adapting type I (SAI) afferents in anesthetized cats. During electrical stimulation of the sympathetic trunk, WDR neurons responded with either an early transient burst of activity, sustained activity, or both. The early transient response was observed only in neurons with piloerection in the receptive field; this response had a similar time course to sympathetically evoked activity in hair afferents with piloerection in the receptive field. The sustained response that occurred in some WDR neurons was independent of piloerection and was similar in time course to the response evoked in SAI afferents by sympathetic stimulation. We conclude that hair and SAI afferents contribute to different components of sympathetically evoked activity in WDR neurons and that both types of afferents are likely to be involved in sympathetically maintained pain in humans.\r"

Five children with sickle cell disease and serologically proved hepatitis A infection were sicker, exhibited a similar elevation of bilirubin concentration with marked elevation of the serum transaminases and recovered more slowly. The clinical course and outcome of hepatitis A in children with sickle cell disease was similar to that of hepatitis A in normal children. Unlike early reports acute cholestatic jaundice in our patients with sickle cell disease, whether caused by hepatitis or by hepatic vasoocclusive crises, was found to be benign with an uneventful recovery.\r"

In 32 patients with diarrhea, ranging in age from 1 to 27 months old, Aeromonas spp. were the only potential bacterial enteropathogens isolated. Principal symptoms of Aeromonas-associated diarrhea were vomiting, fever and bloody stools. Diarrhea was often self-limiting and lasted for 10 days or less in 90% of patients. No secondary spread of diarrhea among close contacts was observed and no clear-cut seasonal patterns of Aeromonas isolation were found. Aeromonas caviae was the most frequently isolated species in fecal samples of patients (24 of 29 isolates) as well as controls (5 of 7 isolates). Cholera toxin cross-reactive cytotoxic enterotoxin was produced by a vast majority of Aeromonas isolates, as compared to a non-cholera toxin cross-reactive cytotonic enterotoxin. In addition no significant correlation was observed between severity of the diarrheal disease and different Aeromonas or the quantity of enterotoxins produced. In our geographic area Aeromonas spp., and A. caviae in particular, seem to be an important and frequent cause of diarrhea in young children.\r"

Increases (greater than 50%) in the half-life for aminoglycoside excretion were not associated with antileukemic or aminoglycoside therapy alone but occurred in 12 of 17 children when amphotericin B was added to the antimicrobial regimen. Seven children had impaired aminoglycoside clearance without increases (greater than 50%) in serum creatinine; hence the resulting adjustments in aminoglycoside dosage would not have been made had we relied solely on serial measurements of serum creatinine. Evidence for increased excretion of the renal enzymes N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase and alanine aminopeptidase during amphotericin B therapy suggested that damage to proximal tubular cells may contribute to the renal impairment that has been associated with this drug. Our findings underscore the value of monitoring serum aminoglycoside concentrations in children being treated with amphotericin B.\r"

Children with three or more separate injury events reported between birth and 5 years of age were 5.9 times more likely to have three or more injuries reported between 5 and 10 years of age than children without early injuries (95% confidence interval = 4.4 to 8.0). Children with one or more injuries resulting in hospitalization before 5 years of age were 2.5 times as likely to have one or more admissions to the hospital for injuries after 5 years of age than children with no early hospitalizations for injuries (95% confidence interval = 2.0 to 3.3). Stepwise regression was used to identify other predictors of injury. The number of injuries before 5 years of age were the best predictors of injuries reported between 5 and 10 years of age, followed by male sex, aggressive child behavior, young maternal age, many older, and few younger siblings. The findings of this study are consistent with two other large studies that relied on medical records rather than parental report and that focused on more severe injuries. Children with several of the identified risk factors can be predicted to have high rates of accidental injuries and may benefit from focused intervention.\r"

Of the 1,266 recorded apneas, 46% were central, 44% were mixed, and 10% were obstructive. Mixed apnea was associated with a longer mean duration and greater mean decrease in heart rate than central apnea. Apnea duration was positively correlated with both a decrease in heart rate and oxygen saturation (P less than .001), and a lower baseline saturation was associated with a greater decrease in oxygen saturation during apnea (P = .002). Theophylline therapy had no effect on apnea duration or oxygen desaturation but resulted in a decrease in the mean heart rate decrease associated with apnea. Overall, nurses diagnosed 54% of all apneic episodes and were significantly poorer at detecting mixed and obstructive events. Nursing detection of apnea improved with increasing apnea duration and was always associated with a greater decrease in heart rate. Nurses diagnosed significantly fewer mixed apnea following theophylline therapy. Improved monitoring techniques, particularly for mixed and obstructive apnea, are essential to increase apnea detection in the nursery.\r"

The recordings had been done to alleviate parental anxiety about sleep apnea. Four infants had siblings who were victims of SIDS. Two infants were studied 3.5 to 9.5 weeks before their deaths because of an unexplained apparent life-threatening event that had occurred during sleep. For each victim of SIDS, two control infants were selected from the 2,000 infants who had been tested in the same hospitals. They were matched for sex, gestational age, postnatal age, and weight at birth with the SIDS victims. Their polygraphic recordings had been performed within similar conditions. Each record was allocated a random code number and was analyzed without knowledge of the patient's identity by two independent scorers. Most sleep and cardiorespiratory variables studied did not differentiate SIDS victims from control infants. Only four variables significantly characterized the future SIDS victims: the maximal duration of central apneas, the number of sighs followed by a central apnea, the presence of obstructive apneas, and the presence of mixed apneas. Central apneas were longer during all sleep states in the SIDS victims compared with their matched controls, but none exceeded 14 seconds. Sighs immediately followed by an apnea were significantly less frequent in the future SIDS group. Obstructive and mixed sleep apneas were seen in eight of 11 SIDS victims and in only three of 22 control infants.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The major cause of mortality and morbidity in the chronic stage is due to respiratory complications. Surveillance, 24 h/d, is the best way to prevent accidental disconnection of respirator equipment from the patient and its inherent catastrophic consequences. The constant risk of disconnection adds tension to the home environment and takes away from the patient any degree of independence or privacy. Because of this, an alternative method of respiration using neck accessory muscles was developed to restore a patient-controlled, voluntary system of respiration. This method, neck breathing, is described in detail in seven children varying in age from 3 years to 16 years 3 months. All seven patients had complete paralysis of the intercostal muscles and the diaphragm. An eighth patient who was unable to learn the technique is also described. Neck breathing is also compared to glossopharygeal breathing, an alternative method of respiration developed during the polio era.\r"

The extent of tissue damage caused by the traditional (deep) technique v that caused by an alternative shallow technique was studied with an animal model. Six 3-week-old rabbits were anesthetized, intubated, and suctioned every 15 minutes for six hours by neonatal intensive care unit nurses who were unaware of the study purpose. Three rabbits were suctioned by means of the deep technique, whereas the other three received shallow suctioning achieved by inserting the catheter no further than a premeasured distance. Light microscopy showed significantly increased necrosis and inflammation following deep suctioning. Electron microscopy revealed greater loss of cilia and increased mucus with the deep technique. To confirm our initial assumption that the deep technique is still used extensively by neonatal intensive care units throughout the country, a mail survey was conducted. Of the 405 (43%) neonatal intensive care unit physicians who responded, 82% reported frequent or exclusive use of the deep technique for routine suctioning. In this study, the fact that deep suctioning results in significantly more tracheobronchial pathology than does a shallow, premeasured technique is shown. It is recommended that nurseries change their current practice and adopt the shallow technique for routine suctioning of intubated neonates.\r"

This \"AIDS anticoagulant\" does not predispose the patient to clinical bleeding despite its ability to cause a marked prolongation of the APTT. As such, careful laboratory diagnosis of the cause of abnormal coagulation test results is necessary for children with AIDS.\r"

To explore this question, a comparison was made between the results of the survey conducted by Alfred Kinsey and colleagues in the 1940s of women in the United States, the majority of whom were born between 1900 and 1929, and the results of more recent studies of the epidemiology of sexual abuse. In Kinsey's study, 24% of 4,441 women reported at least one episode of sexual abuse before adolescence; in 49% of the episodes, the perpetrator was not known to the child and, in 50%, the abuse did not involve bodily contact. These findings are compared to the results of more recent epidemiologic surveys, particularly Russell's study conducted in San Francisco in 1978. Although there are important differences in the methodologies used by Kinsey and Russell, it is likely that changes have occurred in the prevalence and nature of sexual abuse in the 20th century. Russell described a higher prevalence of sexual abuse, a greater proportion of perpetrators who were relatives or adults known to the child, and a greater proportion of serious types of sexual abuse.\r"

To examine this relationship throughout the full range of birth weights, growth data for children less than 5 years of age from the Tennessee Special Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants, and Children linked to birth certificate records for 1975 to 1985 were used. Growth status was compared for 500-g birth weight categories from 1,000 g to 4,999 g using mean Z scores and the percentage of children more than 2 SD above or less than 2 SD below the median for height for age, weight for age, and weight for height. Infants with lower birth weights were likely to remain shorter and lighter throughout childhood, especially those who were intrauterine growth retarded rather than premature. Conversely, those infants with higher birth weights were likely to remain taller and heavier and to have a higher risk of obesity. Birth weight is a strong predictor of weight and height in early childhood, not only for low birth weight children but also for those of normal and high birth weight.\r"

Since then, however, there have been a paucity of reports of pediatric cystic fibrosis complicated by allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, and, in most cases, these have been diagnosed retrospectively. A cluster of five acute cases seen during a 4-month period in a single cystic fibrosis center with a systemic illness and deterioration in respiratory status are described. In all five patients, reversible bronchoconstriction and infiltrative changes on x-ray films suggested the diagnosis. This was confirmed by the presence of (1) peripheral blood eosinophilia, (2) elevated total IgE and Aspergillus fumigatus-specific IgE, and (3) circulating serum precipitins against A fumigatus in all cases. All children tested had positive type 1 immediate hypersensitivity to skin tests for A fumigatus, in sputum eosinophilia, and Aspergillus cultured from sputum. Only three of five children were previously noted to be atopic and none had severe advanced suppurative lung disease. All children had previously received bronchodilator therapy and appropriate antibiotics. Following treatment with corticosteroids, acute symptoms and radiologic changes resolved for 1 to 5 months. To date, no children have had recurrence of their allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis while receiving alternate-day steroid treatment for 6 months.\r"

Olfactory responses of 35 affected subjects (7 to 22 years of age) were compared with those of 68 subjects of comparable age without cleft palates. Subjects were requested to identify the smell of ten common household odors. They selected their responses from an alphabetized list of the test odorants. After a practice trial, the set of odorants was presented five times in randomized sequences. The percentage of correct responses increased with age for prepubertal and pubertal subjects without cleft palates. Although the olfactory scores of girls without cleft palates continued to increase after puberty, this trend was absent in boys. On the average, the girls with cleft palates, compared with only three of 34 boys without cleft palates, had olfactory scores less than 60% correct. There was no evidence of heterogeneity in the magnitude or direction of the relationship between any of the subtypes of cleft palate and olfactory dysfunction. In this study, cleft palate is more strongly associated with olfactory deficits in boys than in girls, suggesting the possibility that the deficit may be a sex-influenced trait.\r"

The events in their prenatal course and acute neonatal course were similar, thus making comparisons of their convalescent course possible. Weight gain was greater among the transported infants for infants with birth weights greater than or equal to 2,000 g and comparable if birth weight was less than 2,000 g. Transported infants received fewer transfusions than their nontransported counterparts. Tolerance of feedings, the occurrence of apnea and bradycardia, and use and discontinuance of supplemental oxygen were similar in both groups. Major new health problems occurred in 27% of all subjects, 20% of transported infants and 32% of nontransported infants. Readmission to the tertiary center or a change in status to more intensive care in the tertiary center occurred in 10% of all infants, 7% of transported and 14% of nontransported infants. It was concluded that convalescing infants often presented new clinical problems, in similar numbers and severity whether convalescing in the tertiary center or after back transport to community hospitals. Community hospital care givers were considered alert to these new problems and to have provided appropriate care, including retransfer to the tertiary center when necessary.\r"

All children had severe neuromotor and orofacial involvement and mental retardation. More than 90% of the patients were less than fifth percentile for height and weight, and 80% were underweight for height before gastrostomy tube placement. Following gastrostomy, 33% remained underweight for height and 21% became overweight for height. The majority of children remained at less than the fifth percentile for height and weight. Improvement in linear growth was much less common than improvement in weight. Children with gastrostomies placed in the first year of life were most likely to exceed the fifth percentile for height and weight. The mechanisms of growth retardation in children severely affected by cerebral palsy are not known, but poor nutrition is thought to be the major contributor. Gastrostomy feeding in children severely affected by cerebral palsy can improve nutritional status but does not eliminate growth retardation. The importance of growth and adequate nutrition in reducing morbidity in children with severe neuromotor involvement remains to be established.\r"

The case histories of 40 children entered into a prospective treatment protocol for high-risk disease revealed that ten of 40 patients (25%) had acute renal failure, two at the time of hospital admission and eight in whom renal insufficiency developed 12 to 132 hours following initiation of cytotoxic chemotherapy. Admission values for serum lactic dehydrogenase and serum uric acid were not statistically different between patients with and without subsequent renal failure. Urine output in the 12 hours prior to antineoplastic therapy was 2.9 +/- 0.8 mL/kg/h in the eight children in whom renal failure developed and 5.3 +/- 0.4 mL/kg/h in the patients who did not (P less than .01). The urinary flow rate in the 24 hours following initiation of chemotherapy was significantly lower in children in whom renal impairment developed (1.0 +/- 0.2 mL/kg/h, mean +/- SE) compared with those who did not (3.7 +/- 0.3 mL/kg/h, P less than .001). Renal failure could not be attributed to hyperuricemia or hyperphosphatemia in the majority of patients with renal failure. One to four hemodialysis treatments (2.5 +/- 0.3) were required for the ten patients. Serum creatinine concentrations returned to normal in the nine survivors. Response to initial antineoplastic therapy was not affected by the presence of renal failure. Renal failure continues to be a major clinical problem in children with Burkitt lymphoma and B cell lymphoblastic leukemia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Single serum theophylline concentrations were determined at nonsteady-state conditions within 13.5 hours of admission (median 6.75 hours). An iterative program was applied to predict the steady-state theophylline concentration as well as necessary adjustments in dosage. Measured steady-state concentrations were then compared with the predicted values. The median measured steady-state concentration was 15 mg/L, and the median predicted steady-state level was 13 mg/L. The least squares regression line was: Measured = 0.738 predicted + 4.77; r = .721, P less than .01. No patient experienced symptoms of toxicity. This technique affords the possibility of accurate prediction of steady-state theophylline concentrations and dosing requirements with a minimum number of serum concentration determinations in children with status asthmaticus.\r"

Flexible fiberoptic bronchoscopy (n = 13) was performed and/or clinical and radiographic assessments were used to evaluate for laryngeal, tracheal, and bronchial lesions. There was no bronchoscopic evidence of necrotizing tracheobronchitis after either high-frequency jet ventilation (n = 8) or conventional ventilation (n = 5). Laryngotracheomalacia and nodular vocal cords were the most common abnormalities noted, and they occurred with equal frequency in both groups. Study infants who were not bronchoscoped had no clinical or radiographic evidence of tracheal or mainstem bronchial obstruction. One patient did have microscopic evidence of necrotizing tracheobronchitis at autopsy, however. It is concluded that short-term treatment of respiratory distress syndrome with high-frequency jet ventilation may be performed without undue risk of tracheobronchial injury.\r"

Of the cocaine users, 24% denied use at the time of the interview and were identified solely by urine assay. Cocaine users were significantly (P less than .01) less likely than nonusers to be married, Hispanic, or black born outside of the United States and were less well nourished. Users reported significantly (P less than .01) more sexually transmitted diseases, prior low birth weight infants, spontaneous and elective abortions, and greater use of alcohol, cigarettes, marijuana, opiates, and other illicit drugs during pregnancy. Because cocaine use is correlated with many potential risk factors, large sample sizes and multivariate statistical techniques are needed to determine whether cocaine use during pregnancy poses an independent risk for adverse neonatal outcomes.\r"

Socioeconomic status was estimated by the 1979 median family income of the census tract of maternal residence. For both racial groups the deterioration of residential area socioeconomic status was associated with a significant increase in the percentage of high-risk teenage mothers (less than 17 years of age), in the percentage of mothers with either no, only third trimester, or unknown prenatal care, and in the percentage of low birth weight infants. The rate of increase in the percentage of low birth weight in response to the socioeconomic deterioration of residential area was similar in black and in white groups. There was, however, a racial gap of 5% low birth weight that remained constant across all income areas. At the individual level, there were marked racial differences in the relative risks imposed by one's residential median family income, age, prenatal care, and pattern of interactions.\r"

The clinical and laboratory course of 19 children infected with HIV with thrombocytopenia is described. Bone marrow aspirates showed normal to increased numbers of megakaryocytes. Levels of antiplatelet antibodies were increased in 80% of the children and circulating immune complexes were found in 74%. Clinically significant hemorrhage leading to anemia occurred in five patients, and CNS bleeding led to a fatal outcome in an additional three children. Spontaneous remission of thrombocytopenia occurred in three of the 19 subjects. High-dose IV gamma-globulin was effective in increasing the platelet counts of six of 15 patients (40%) but resulted in a sustained remission in only one subject. Oral prednisone was effective in increasing the platelet count of two thirds of those whose platelet counts could not be controlled by IV gamma-globulin. Bleeding manifestations were eliminated in all patients whose platelet counts increased significantly. Of the 11 children whose counts increased either spontaneously or as a result of therapy, eight remain alive (72%). In contrast, all of the eight patients whose platelet counts did not improve have died. Thrombocytopenia in children with HIV disease is engendered by immune mechanisms and is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. High-dose IV gamma-globulin and/or corticosteroids are temporarily effective in increasing the platelet count and reducing bleeding in about half of thrombocytopenic patients and are recommended for use. The ability to respond to therapy correlates with improved survival.\r"

Transthoracic impedance was measured in ten ambulatory infants, 6 weeks to 9 months of age, and 37 children, 1.5 to 15 years of age, using a previously validated \"test pulse\" technique that measures transthoracic impedance without actually delivering a shock. We used hand-held \"pediatric\" (21 cm2) and \"adult\" (83 cm2) electrode paddles coated with either Redux paste or Redux creme. Transthoracic impedance in children was 108 +/- 24 omega (range 61 to 212 omega) using pediatric paddles. Using adult paddles lowered the transthoracic resistance by 47% to 57 +/- 11 omega (range 29 to 101 omega), P less than .05. In infants, transthoracic impedance (measured only with pediatric paddles) was 94 +/- 17 omega (range 74 to 124 omega). Using Redux paste as the coupling agent reduced transthoracic impedance by 13% (P less than .05). Transthoracic impedance was significantly but poorly related to body weight and body surface areas, but the correlations were not sufficiently high to be clinically useful. These data indicate that the larger adult electrode paddles will minimize transthoracic impedance and should be used when the child's thorax is large enough to permit electrode to chest contact over the entire paddle surface. This transition occurred at an approximate weight of 10 kg.\r"

  ".W": "In a longitudinal study, human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) antigen (HIV-Ag) was measured in serum specimens from 54 children with HIV-1 infection followed for a median duration of 17 months. The persistent detection of free HIV-Ag in a group of 25 children was associated with clinical deterioration in 22 (88%) and a mortality of 52%, whereas the persistent nondetection of free HIV-Ag in a group of 18 children was associated with clinical deterioration in five (28%) and a mortality of 11% during the period of observation. Nine children had transient HIV-1 antigenemia and two children converted from HIV-Ag negative to positive during the study. Free HIV-Ag levels varied inversely with antibody reactivity to viral core proteins p24 and p17 determined by Western immunoblot, suggesting either the formation of immune complexes or a balance between viral expression and the host immune response. Five mother-infant pairs were studied for HIV-Ag expression in the perinatal period. In three of these pairs, both mother and infant were HIV-Ag negative, in one pair the mother had high levels of HIV-Ag and the infant was HIV-Ag negative. In the remaining mother-infant pair, the neonate became HIV-Ag positive but the mother was HIV-Ag negative prepartum and postpartum. These data suggest that HIV-Ag probably does not cross the placenta and that the detection of free HIV-Ag in the offspring of a HIV-1 infected mother most likely indicates viral infection.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "We have witnessed six cases of the hair-thread tourniquet syndrome, an entity characterized by strangulation of an appendage (toes, fingers, or external genitalia) by hair or hair-like fibers in the pediatric population. All six of our cases were in infants, 12 days to 5 months of age. The offending fibers were hair in three of the four patients with toe injuries and synthetic fibers from mittens in the finger cases. All six patients were treated by immediate removal of the constricting fibers, and, in spite of the worrisome appearance of the tissue distal to the constriction, all six eventually healed without significant tissue loss. A review of the literature indicated 60 similar cases of this type reported, 24 involving toes, 14 involving fingers, and 22 involving genitals. The majority of the toe and external genitalia cases were caused by hair, whereas the majority of finger strangulations were caused by thread from mittens. At greatest risk for strangulation are the middle finger and third toe, followed by the index finger and second toe. Patients with finger or penile involvement were more likely to suffer significant complications from the injuries than those patients with toe involvement. Based on our own experience and that described in the literature, we recommend prompt removal of the offending fiber, followed by prolonged conservative management of the damaged distal tissue, in the hope of maximal tissue salvage. Increased physician awareness of this syndrome is mandatory for prevention, diagnosis, and early treatment.\r"

Could computer technology be incorporated in all courses so that there is no time gap between its introduction and application? Should a separate course on computer use be incorporated into the curriculum? If faculty's objectives for student education in nursing include knowledge of computers in professional practice, should this also hold true for nursing educators? After evaluating the success of their efforts to incorporate computer technology into the curriculum, C. W. Post's nursing faculty believe that further planning can resolve the problems and concerns they identified and that they will be able to expand on what they have already accomplished.\r"

Using hierarchical analysis of sets, the results indicated that the set of variables used to test the situational theory explained more variance in loneliness when entered first (62%) or second (34%) in the analysis than did the characterological set when entered first (33%) or second (5%) in the analysis. The findings suggested that the situational explanation played a more significant role than the characterological explanation in understanding loneliness in early adolescents.\r"

A subset of 11 adolescents was interviewed to validate study findings. Four sequential concepts (cognitive discomfort, distraction, cognitive comfort, and personal competence) emerged to represent the process adolescents experience to achieve hopefulness. The overall organizing construct, induced from the four core concepts, was labeled self-sustaining and defined as a natural progression adolescents who are experiencing serious health threats move through to comfort themselves and to achieve competence in resolving health threats. Results indicated adolescents are able to initiate effective and preferred strategies to achieve hopefulness and competence in resolving health threats.\r"

Teachers rated the children's Type A behavior and two of its subcomponents, impatience-aggression and competitive achievement-striving, using the Matthews Youth Test for Health. Statistically significant heritability estimates were found for Type A behavior and its subcomponents, triglycerides, systolic blood pressure, and body mass. Nevertheless, there was substantial environmental influence on these risk factors. The greatest environmental influence was observed for HDL-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, apolipoprotein-B and diastolic blood pressure.\r"

BSt was measured with a 12-category scale for 30 seconds before the 5-minute period (BSt1) and for 30 seconds after (BSt2). Sleep states decreased for both groups. BSts considered more optimal for feeding increased more during NNS (86 vs. 46). Restless states were three times less frequent after NNS (23 vs. 68). Differences between groups were nonsignificant at BSt1, but were significant at BSt2, p less than .001. In the absence of self-regulatory feeding policies based on early hunger cues, NNS for 5 minutes prefeeding is simple, brief, and suitable for implementation in busy neonatal intensive care units. Nonnutritive sucking was an effective modulator of behavioral state for this sample.\r"

Two variables of the self-regulatory process (symptom-associating and action-taking) were tested through semi-structured interviews of 173 subjects who had Type II diabetes. Most (85%) subjects associated their symptoms with a change in blood glucose levels. Of subjects who associated symptoms with elevated blood glucose, 77% took action; of subjects who associated symptoms with lowered blood glucose, 89% took action.

Subjects also completed the 45-item Psychosocial Adjustment to Illness--Self-Report Scale (PAIS-SR) described by Derogatis and Lopez (1983). Test-retest reliability for 70 subjects was, on the whole, substantial (kappa = .45 to 1.00) as was the ability of nurse clinicians to reliably categorize the qualitative component of the questionnaire into one of 12 categories (kappa = .64). The factor structure of the questionnaire supported the theoretical assumptions underlying the instrument. Three of the factors of meaning given the illness, R2 = .46, and/or three items, R2 = .60, had more power than coping behavior in explaining a person's adjustment to chronic illness. The questionnaire has accumulated reliability and validity in measuring a variety of concurrent yet divergent meanings that may be given an illness for three chronically ill populations--those with mixed cancer, rheumatological, and gastroenterological disorders.\r"

The sample consisted of 720 articles that met the definitional criteria of nursing practice research from six major refereed journals in nursing that primarily publish nursing research. Findings showed that 95% of research in nursing in the last decade was conducted by nurses as first authors, over half with doctoral degrees. Funded research increased as well as the trend toward multidisciplinary research and multisite studies. One-third of the studies focused on nursing intervention, and two-thirds were assessment-oriented. Although use of nursing conceptual models increased over the decade, theories or models from psychology, physiology, and sociology were used most often. There was an increase in use of sophisticated research methods and better reporting of reliability and validity. The use of NANDA as a taxonomy for classifying nursing practice research was assessed.\r"

  ".W": "Differentiating acute appendicitis from other causes of acute abdominal pain in children frequently remains unsatisfactory. To determine whether initial historical and physical examination findings might predict final diagnoses, 246 patients with complaints of nontraumatic and nonrecurrent acute abdominal pain were studied. All were between three and 18 years of age and had presented to a hospital-based pediatric emergency department. Each family was telephoned an average of 5.1 days after the visit to determine the patient's subsequent clinical course; operative notes and pathology reports were reviewed for patients receiving surgery. Of these patients with acute abdominal pain, both fever and vomiting were present in 18 of the 24 who eventually had diagnoses of appendicitis, compared with 49 of 222 patients with other final diagnoses (P less than 0.01, with negative predictive value 0.97, sensitivity 0.75, and specificity 0.78, but positive predictive value only 0.27). The duration of the pain at presentation and the frequency of other symptoms (eg, diarrhea, dysuria, anorexia, and lethargy) were unrelated, however, to final diagnosis, as was the duration of the pain and whether abdominal tenderness initially was localized or generalized. Nonruptured appendicitis was generally indistinguishable from ruptured appendicitis preoperatively, by both duration and symptoms. Boys were found more likely to have appendicitis (with or without rupture) than girls (18/118 or 15%, vs. 6/128 or 5%, P less than 0.05). In conclusion, fever and vomiting were noted at presentation more frequently in children with appendicitis than in children with other causes of acute abdominal pain.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Sixty-eight percent of the communities had a designated pediatric sexual assault center. Thirty-two percent were affiliated with adult facilities and 68% with pediatric facilities. Of those hospitals responding, initial evaluation was most often performed in the emergency department in 77%. Most initial evaluations were performed by resident (PL-2 or above) level physicians (59%).

  ".W": "A retrospective study was performed of 32 bacteremic children not receiving preadmission antibiotic therapy who had a diagnostic lumbar puncture for analysis of cerebrospinal fluid at the time of initial evaluation for an acute illness. In each instance, the CSF contained polymorphonuclear leukocytes without pleocytosis. Of these 32 bacteremic patients, 88% had a CSF differential cell count with 20% or fewer polymorphonuclear cells, and greater than 90% had glucose and protein concentration within the range of normal limits. All patients had a Gram-stained smear of CSF which revealed no organisms. In no instance was a CSF culture positive for a bacterial pathogen. In the bacteremic child not pretreated with antibiotics, cerebrospinal fluid which contains total white blood cell, glucose, and protein concentrations within limits of normal, a differential cell count with 20% or fewer polymorphonuclear leukocytes, and Gram-stained smear which reveals no organisms is not indicative of risk for bacterial meningitis.\r"

In retrospect, plain abdominal radiographs demonstrated characteristic mottled filling defects in the stomach from a lactobezoar.
