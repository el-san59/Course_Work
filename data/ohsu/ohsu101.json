  ".W": "To determine whether double-contrast barium enema (DCBE) or fibreoptic examination should be the first-line investigation for colonic disease 76 consecutive patients presenting for the first time to the outpatient clinic with symptoms of colonic disease deemed to need a DCBE after negative rigid sigmoidoscopy were entered into a trial. All underwent flexible sigmoidoscopy, then DCBE, and finally colonoscopy. 66 patients completed the study. DCBE alone gave the final diagnosis in 42 (67%) and colonoscopy alone in 60 (91%) (p = 0.0004). A combination of flexible sigmoidoscopy and DCBE led to the diagnosis in 50 patients (76%). With DCBE alone 73% of polyps and 64% of patients with inflammatory bowel disease were missed. No complications arose from the investigations. 32 (48%) patients found DCBE distressing and 15 (23%) found colonoscopy uncomfortable (p = 0.004). Its high diagnostic accuracy and relative lack of discomfort for patients make colonoscopy the primary procedure for investigating patients with large bowel symptoms referred to the general surgeon.\r"

Studies in cultured syncytiotrophoblasts have revealed an additional action of RU 486 at the placental level, where it impairs the production of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), human placental lactogen (hPL), and progesterone. RU 486 (10 nmol-10 mumol/l) attenuated the production of all three placental hormones, in a dose-related manner, and its effects on hCG and hPL were reversed by addition of exogenous progesterone. The specific inhibitory effects of RU 486 on placental hormone secretion indicate that its antifertility actions are attributable to competitive inhibition of progesterone action in the trophoblast as well as in the endometrium.\r"

Four of the five deaths were attributable to protracted labour with septicaemia (1), postoperative infection (2), and protracted labour with no blood pressure on admission (1). Obstetric operations could safely be performed by specially trained nurses in rural areas of developing countries and the high maternal mortality rate in such areas could thus be reduced.\r"

In each patient the healing potential of a below-knee amputation was determined preoperatively by segmental pressure studies and thermographic delineation of skin perfusion. 33 of the stumps healed by first intention, in 14 healing was delayed but occurred without the need for further surgery, and 3 stumps healed after local wedge excision. The initial mobilisation rate was 90%. Thus, there are no grounds for carrying out an initial above-knee amputation to save the patient a further operation.\r"

The cutaneous lesions were solitary or multiple papules and nodules. In some patients the lesions also affected internal organs. Histologically the neoplasms were composed of proliferating blood vessels and cells with epithelioid features. Immunoperoxidase studies of one lesion showed that the cells expressed both factor VIII antigen, a maker for endothelial cells, and alpha 1-anti-chymotrypsin, a marker for histiocytes. In some patients the lesions gradually disappeared but in two they were the cause of death, in one case from disseminated intravascular coagulation and in the other from laryngeal obstruction by the tumour.\r"

This study investigated the hypothesis that ghee, a clarified butter product prized in Indian cooking, contains cholesterol oxides and could therefore be an important source of dietary exposure to cholesterol oxides and an explanation for the high atherosclerosis risk. Substantial amounts of cholesterol oxides were found in ghee (12.3% of sterols), but not in fresh butter, by thin-layer and high-performance-liquid chromatography. Dietary exposure to cholesterol oxides from ghee may offer a logical explanation for the high frequency of atherosclerotic complications in these Indian populations.\r"

In the brain, oxygen extraction from the blood can be increased if blood pressure falls below the lower limit of autoregulation. In the coronary circulation, however, oxygen extraction is nearly maximum at rest, and lowering of blood pressure by antihypertensive therapy can lead to myocardial ischaemia.\r"

We found the common boundary between these two structures on the surface of the brain stem as well as within it. We used the Kluver-Barrera staining technique to characterize different neuronal types adjacent to the boundary. Although the majority of them in the CN were globular, we also saw a substantial number of spherical neurons. Neurons in the PBB were substantially different in shape and were mainly angular. The boundary between the PBB and CN at their closest contact runs around the caudal side of the ventral cochlear nucleus and the most proximal part of the eighth nerve. In the more dorsal region, the PBB is completely separated from the CN by the brain stem tissue. In the ventral region, the PBB runs between the seventh and eighth nerves, and it is adjacent to both. These results might aid accurate placement of the central electroauditory prosthesis and further understanding of the general anatomy of the cerebellopontine angle.\r"

Since both of these factors are related to age, identification of those patients who may benefit by delaying the surgery has been a concern to otolaryngologists. In an effort to investigate the role of eustachian tube function on the outcome, we tested the tubal function in 63 ears (56 children) undergoing tympanoplasty for central perforations. In 49 ears (78%), the graft took; of these, 33 had good middle-ear function, 8 developed persistent or recurrent otitis media, and 8 had severe retraction or atelectasis. There was a significant association (p less than 0.01) between outcome and preoperative tubal function as determined by combining the active and passive function parameters. However, the prognostic value of tubal function testing was low; predictive values for success and lack of success being 68% and 56%, respectively. Other factors, such as graft placement (medial or lateral) contralateral ear status, and child's age, were not associated with outcome. Consistent with other studies, good eustachian tube function was shown to predict good outcome, but poor tubal function was not helpful in predicting poor outcome.\r"

While potentially treatable, this lesion has been described predominantly in autopsy or animal studies. We observed clinical symptoms which reflect development of this lesion. Symptoms of acute airway obstruction (hypercarbia, respiratory acidosis, decreased chest wall movement) occurred in eight neonates undergoing treatment with high-frequency jet ventilation; five patients treated with HFJV were studied without signs of obstruction. Emergency bronchoscopy using a rigid bronchoscope was performed in the intensive care unit. The diagnosis of NTB was made by the observation of hyperemia, intraluminal debris, or the appearance of eschar formation. Necrotic debris was removed using forceps and/or suction as necessary. All patients survived treatment. Seven were long-term survivors, all with bronchopulmonary dysplasia. In patients who died, autopsy evaluation of the airway revealed a characteristic picture consisting of necrosis, neutrophil infiltration, epithelial erosion, and intraluminal obstruction.\r"

Satisfactory management is elusive and frustrating to the head and neck oncologist. Various recommended therapeutic regimens include symptomatic treatment, palliation with chemotherapy and radiation, and aggressive surgical salvage. While surgery offers the only realistic chance at cure, this procedure is fraught with significant morbidity and a poor success rate. In an attempt to clarify the role of surgical salvage in these patients, experience with 57 patients with stomal recurrence presenting to three head and neck surgical groups will be presented. Forty-one of these patients subsequently underwent definitive surgery. The overall 2-year survival for operated patients was 16% with a 24% determinate survival. Further analysis revealed a 45% 5-year survival with type 1 and 2 lesions and 9% survival with types 3 and 4. Recommendations regarding indications for surgery are made based on this experience.\r"

In 239 (94.1%) patients both the pharyngoesophagram and esophagoscopy were negative. Four esophageal tumors were found. Only one of these tumors (25%) was detected on pharyngoesophagram. We believe that the pharyngoesophagram should be a part of the initial work-up of every head and neck cancer patient and should precede esophagoscopy. However, the barium swallow cannot be relied upon exclusively to detect small simultaneous second primary esophageal malignancies.\r"

The child with laryngeal trauma may develop respiratory distress much more quickly than an adult because of the relatively small dimensions of the pediatric airway and the apparent propensity for children to develop edema of the soft tissues of the larynx. This report retrospectively reviews our experience during the past several years with ten children who experienced blunt laryngeal trauma. Emphasis is placed upon the diverse etiologies of laryngeal trauma in children and the importance of both flexible and rigid laryngoscopy in the diagnosis and management of these patients.\r"

Although radical dosage radiotherapy will control most local lesions, dissemination of lymphoma may still occur despite absence of systemic disease at initial diagnostic work-up. Subsequent control with cytotoxic drugs is frequently unsuccessful, and it is suggested that chemotherapy should be given routinely to every patient with primary nasal lymphoma and possibly to those with polymorphic reticulosis or necrosis with atypical cellular exudate (NACE).\r"

A standardized questionnaire and detailed overnight sleep study were performed before and after surgery. In addition, 15 patients were retested 1 year postoperatively. Uvulopalatopharyngoplasty resulted in a statistically significant reduction in symptoms, blood pressure, apnea index, and total apneic time. There was no significant change in patient weight or sleep gas exchange. Seventy-seven percent had a reduction in apnea index of greater than 50%, which is better than other reported series using a more conservative approach.

The high SISI score, presence of recruitment, and prolongation of the wave I (N1) latency suggested that the inner ear is responsible for hearing loss in these cases. Inner ear dysfunction was probably due to the low calcium level in inner ear fluid and/or the direct effect of vitamin D deficiency on the inner ear.\r"

  ".W": "In vascular surgery, it is now very difficult to maintain the long-term patency after a conventional vascular anastomosis, especially for small-caliber vessels. A low-energy CO2 laser was experimentally employed to make a vascular anastomosis with only a few sutures. Subsequently, it could be confirmed that optimal conditions for vascular anastomosis by laser were 20-40 mW in output and 6-12 sec/mm in irradiation time. On the other hand, pressure tolerance test as well as tensile strength test and microscopic examinations at the sites of anastomoses by laser were compared with the conventional suture method. There were no significant differences between laser and suture methods. On the basis of the excellent results of this study, the laser was clinically applied for anastomoses of the peripheral vessels in 35 patients. The first clinical laser application in the world was successful in a 44-year-old female patient with chronic renal failure in 1985. All patients are doing well without any complications from vascular anastomosis by laser. From these experimental and clinical studies, it can be concluded that anastomosis by laser should be recommended for small-caliber vessels such as aortocoronary bypass surgery.\r"

Mean surface temperature changes were measured at the site of laser impact with the artery to evaluate the resultant histopathological changes as a function of laser power. More severe thermal coagulative changes, necrosis, and swelling resulted with increased laser power. Comparison of the temperature-time relationships showed that the peak surface temperature rise at the surface of these arteries was about 25 degrees C for one pulse at 200 mW laser power, compared to an approximate 7 degrees C rise for one pulse at 120 or 150 mW laser power. Increase in the surface temperature resulted in an increased severity of histopathological injury. These results showed that necrosis of medial layer smooth muscle cells occurred beyond the laser exposure site, suggesting that heat conduction could result in significant damage to reconnected vessel and could be a factor in the formation of a weak bond or an aneurysm.\r"

Re-endothelialization of the anastomotic line began by day 3, while myofibroblast proliferation was observed in the media by day 10. By day 20 media scar was still occupied by numerous myofibroblasts and surrounded by abundant collagen and elastic fibres. At long term the endothelial repair was complete and the anastomotic strength was assured by medial collagenous network.\r"

  ".W": "The photoresection of endobronchial tumors produces smoke which is partly inhaled by the patient as well as the surgical staff. In an animal study we investigated whether a single exposure or repetitive exposures to smoke might have harmful side effects on the airways. Eleven sheep were exposed to smoke produced by laser-vaporizing (6,500 J) sections of bronchial tissue (1 cm3) in a Plexiglas chamber. The smoke analysis revealed 0.92 mg/liter particles with a mean particle size of 0.54 micron. Carbon monoxide content was estimated as 0.04%. We measured the effects of one or three separate ten-minute exposures on airway resistance, gas exchange, and mucociliary clearance rate in the trachea. We found that the smoke inhalation resulted in a decrease of arterial PO2 with relatively little change in airway mechanics. Tracheal mucus velocity, a marker of lung mucociliary clearance, was significantly depressed in a dose-dependent manner with increasing smoke exposures. Results of bronchoalveolar lavages performed before and one day after the exposure showed that the smoke inhalation induced a severe inflammation with dramatic increases of inflammatory cells. The total number of cells per milliliter lavage return increased from 3.2 million to 25 million; percent neutrophils increased from 2.3 to 45.6% and percent macrophages decreased from 86 to 41%. These findings indicate that the side effects of smoke inhalation during intrabronchial laser surgery should not be neglected. The impairment of the defense mechanism of the lung combined with the inflammation as well as hypoxia might be fatal in compromised patients. Effective smoke removal devices should be developed to protect the patient as well as the surgeon.\r"

Of the 44 deaths analyzed, 33 patients had autopsies. Infections were common and often determined to be the cause of death. Overall, infections were present in 55 percent (22/44), and judged to be a cause of death in 30 percent (13/44) of all deaths. The infections could be divided into 2 groups: those due to common bacterial organisms and those due to opportunistic infections. These two types of infections occurred with similar frequency. When compared to common bacterial infections, however, the opportunistic infections were more likely to be first diagnosed at autopsy (p = .001). In only 3 of the 15 patients with an opportunistic infection was the diagnosis made antemortem. Failure to diagnose an opportunistic infection early occurred when the infection simulated active SLE, and when the possibility of an opportunistic infection was not aggressively investigated. The most common opportunistic infections were Candida albicans and Pneumocystis carinii. The most common site of opportunistic infection was the lung. Seventeen patients had 27 common bacterial infections, chiefly sepsis from Staphylococcus aureus and aerobic gram-negative organisms. Eight patients had both a common bacterial and an opportunistic infection. Stepwise linear regression analysis showed that death from infection correlated most strongly with prednisone and cytotoxic drug use in the 3 months before final admission. No measure of lupus activity was found to correlate with death from infection, except that hypocomplementemia correlated with death from bacterial infections.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Patients with central core disease show wide variation in the clinical spectrum of muscle involvement. Some will have no symptoms and be completely normal on examination, many will show mild to moderate weakness, and a small number will be severely affected. Muscle atrophy is a frequent finding, but progression of muscle weakness is rare and occurs only slowly. Musculoskeletal deformities, including kyphoscoliosis, congenital hip dislocation, feet deformities, and joint contractures, are often seen but generally do not alter the natural history of the disease. Surgical treatment may be required for some of these abnormalities. No relationship appears to exist between the degree of muscle weakness and the presence or type of musculoskeletal deformities. Cardiac abnormalities have rarely been reported in association with central core disease. Mitral valve prolapse was noted in 3 of our patients and 2 others had cardiac arrhythmias. Central core disease and susceptibility to malignant hyperthermia was present in all 11 patients we studied (2 patients with central core disease did not have studies for malignant hyperthermia). These 11 patients came from 4 families. All patients with central core disease should be considered at risk for malignant hyperthermia unless in-vitro contracture tests show that the particular patient is free of the trait.\r"

  ".W": "LGL leukemia results from a chronic, clonal proliferation of LGL. Chronic neutropenia with recurrent bacterial infection and splenomegaly are common clinical manifestations. Rheumatoid arthritis coexists in some of these patients, who thus resemble patients with Felty syndrome. Other hematologic abnormalities that may occur include pure red-cell aplasia and adult-onset cyclic neutropenia. Lymphoid infiltration of bone marrow, splenic red pulp cords, and hepatic sinusoids is characteristic; lymph node and skin involvement are rare. Multiple serologic abnormalities are frequently present, including positive tests for rheumatoid factor and/or antinuclear antibody, polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia, and circulating immune complexes. Antineutrophil and antiplatelet antibodies are often present. Leukemic LGL exhibit phenotypic heterogeneity; the most common phenotype in our patients is CD2+, CD3+, CD8+, HNK-1+, CD16-. Despite markedly increased numbers of LGL, functional activity of the cells is usually decreased. The mechanism of cytopenias is uncertain: in pure red-cell aplasia, it appears to be due to suppressive effect on erythropoiesis by abnormal LGL, but in patients with chronic neutropenia it may be antibody-mediated. Although most patients appear to have a relatively benign clinical course, mortality from infections and progressive lymphoproliferation is substantial. Optimal therapy remains undefined. Some preliminary evidence suggests that LGL leukemia may be associated with infection with a retrovirus similar to HTLV-I. Although relatively rare, LGL leukemia is of interest because a better understanding of this disease process may contribute to our knowledge of autoimmune diseases, the immunoregulatory functions of LGL, and the mechanisms controlling normal hematopoiesis.\r"

There were eight patients with associated radiculopathies confirmed by electromyography. No meaningful differences in SSEPs were noted between those with or without root injury. Surgery confirmed the level of cord injury in 10. CSM is common with a high morbidity. The results indicate SSEPs using leg stimulation can be a sensitive indicator of cord injury in these patients and that the more commonly used arm stimulation is of value primarily for localizing the level of the myelopathy.\r"

Nerve biopsy showed a severe loss of large myelinated fibers and no demyelination. On teased nerve fiber preparations, most fibers presented uniformly short internodes. No correlation was seen between sensory conduction findings or histologic abnormalities and clinical disability. In patients SSEP changes, which were constant, and VEPs, which were frequently involved, were unrelated to the severity or duration of clinical disability. There were 14 relatives who showed clinical signs of Friedreich's disease. Slightly decreased distal conduction velocity along sensory fibers was observed in more than half of the relatives. Nerve biopsy was noncontributory. In conclusion, we could not determine whether the abnormalities observed in the siblings were an expression of a heterozygotic condition, or whether they were early signs of the disease.\r"

Sternohyoid or sternomastoid muscles were transplanted as free muscle grafts to the ventral surface of an intact sternohyoid muscle (feeder muscle). After several weeks the graft and underlying feeder muscle were removed together, frozen, serially sectioned, stained, and carefully examined for the presence or absence of nerves. It was concluded from a series of experiments that in this model muscular neurotization is a form of nerve regeneration. In order for muscular neurotization to occur, it is necessary to have (1) injury to the nerves of the intact feeder muscle and (2) a pathway upon which the regenerating nerves may grow into the graft.\r"

Hindlimb muscles were harvested 12-16 hours postflight for histochemical, biochemical, and ultrastructural analyses. The majority of the soleus and extensor digitorum longus fibers exhibited simple cell shrinkage. However, approximately 1% of the fibers in flight soleus muscles appeared necrotic. Flight muscle fibers showed increased glycogen, lower subsarcolemmal staining for mitochondrial enzymes, and fewer subsarcolemmal mitochondria. During atrophy, myofibrils were eroded by multiple focal losses of myofilaments; lysosomal autophagy was not evident. Tripeptidylaminopeptidase and calcium-activated protease activities of flight soleus fibers were significantly increased, implying a role in myofibril breakdown. Simple fiber atrophy appears to account for muscle weakening during spaceflight, but fiber necrosis is also a contributing factor.\r"

Ninety-seven of these patients (2.7 percent), who were 60 years old or younger at diagnosis, had lone atrial fibrillation (atrial fibrillation in the absence of overt cardiovascular disease or precipitating illness), and their data were reviewed to determine the incidence of thromboemboli. Twenty of these patients (21 percent) had an isolated episode of atrial fibrillation, 56 (58 percent) had recurrent atrial fibrillation, and 21 (22 percent) had chronic atrial fibrillation. The total follow-up period was 1440 person-years, with a mean of 14.8 years per patient. The mean age at diagnosis was 44 years. Nineteen cardiovascular events occurred in 17 patients; 4 patients had strokes thought to be due to emboli from atrial fibrillation, and 4 had myocardial infarctions without overt evidence of previous coronary artery disease. The probability of survival at 15 years was 94 percent among the patients with lone atrial fibrillation. At 15 years, 1.3 percent of the patients had had a stroke on a cumulative actuarial basis. On an actuarial basis, there was no difference in survival or in survival free of stroke among the patients with the three types of lone atrial fibrillation (i.e., isolated, recurrent, and chronic). We conclude that lone atrial fibrillation in patients under the age of 60 at diagnosis is associated with a very low risk of stroke. This suggests that routine anticoagulation may not be warranted.\r"

Colony growth in blood from the infants was compared with growth in blood from adults and umbilical-cord blood from term infants, in the presence of erythropoietin, 0 to 2000 mU per milliliter. Addition of increasing concentrations of erythropoietin resulted in a stepwise increase in the number of colonies derived from BFU-E (P less than 0.0005) of all three groups of subjects. Cultures stimulated with 2000 mU of erythropoietin yielded 28.1 +/- 7.6, 88.0 +/- 19.4, and 121.0 +/- 22.5 bursts (mean +/- SE) per 10(5) cells plated in blood from adults, blood from premature infants, and cord blood, respectively. Although more BFU-E-derived colonies appeared when 200 or 2000 mU were present per milliliter in cultures of the infants' blood and cord blood, the intrinsic responsiveness of BFU-E to erythropoietin was similar in all groups. Although the mean hematocrit was 26 percent, mean serum erythropoietin concentrations (+/- SD) in the infants (20.7 +/- 10.0 mU per milliliter) were not significantly different from those in the adult controls (24.0 +/- 6.5). We conclude that progenitor cells committed to erythroid differentiation are present during the anemia of prematurity, and that the intrinsic responsiveness of the circulating BFU-E pool to erythropoietin is normal. These results implicate inadequate production of erythropoietin as the cause of the anemia of prematurity and suggest that recombinant erythropoietin might provide a therapeutic alternative to transfusion for symptomatic babies with this condition.\r"

The deletion also occurred in homozygous form in four of seven French Canadian homozygotes. The deletion removes the promoter and first exon of the gene, and it abolishes the production of messenger RNA for the low-density-lipoprotein receptor. The high frequency of this mutation is presumably related to a founder effect among the 8000 ancestors of present-day French Canadians, who have had relatively little cross-breeding with groups of other national origins. This deletion has not been observed in any other ethnic group. It can be detected by analysis of genomic DNA from blood leukocytes, thus allowing direct diagnosis of familial hypercholesterolemia in a majority of affected French Canadians.\r"

However, in immunohistochemical studies of autopsy material, three distinct forms of senile cardiovascular amyloid have been characterized, including a systemic form that diffusely infiltrates the cardiac ventricles. The systemic form can be identified immunohistochemically with use of antiserum to human prealbumin. We diagnosed senile systemic amyloidosis causing cardiac dysfunction in five men (57 to 72 years old) by using antiserum to prealbumin in myocardial biopsy tissue. Clinically, the five patients were indistinguishable from patients with nonsecretory immunoglobulin-derived primary amyloidosis with cardiac involvement; only immunohistochemical staining of myocardial tissue distinguished between the two entities. This distinction is important, because the treatment and prognosis of the two disorders are different. We recommend immunohistochemical staining of myocardial tissue for prealbumin in patients with biopsy-proved cardiac amyloid in whom no monoclonal immunoglobulin light chain is detectable in the serum or urine.\r"

  ".W": "In a hospital-based cohort of 8903 black and white women, we investigated medical and socioeconomic risk factors that may explain the known increase in premature births among black women. Among the medical conditions examined, only the maternal hematocrit level (or some related factor) explained a substantial proportion (60 percent) of the increased rate of premature births to black women. Four economic, demographic, and behavioral predictors of prematurity were also examined: age less than 20 years, single marital status, receiving welfare support, and not having graduated from high school. The number of these socioeconomic risk factors occurring in a woman was strongly predictive of premature birth of her infant, regardless of the particular risk factors present. The presence of any one factor was associated with a moderate increase in the risk of prematurity (7.0 percent as compared with 4.6 percent with no risk factors present); the presence of two or more characteristics was associated with a much higher risk (11.2 percent). When the number of these four risk factors pertaining to an individual woman was taken into account, race was no longer a significant predictor of premature birth (odds ratio, 1.22; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.94 to 1.59). When both the maternal hematocrit level and the number of the four socioeconomic risk factors were taken into account, essentially all of the racial variation in prematurity was explained, with the odds ratio for prematurity among blacks being 1.03 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.79 to 1.35). We conclude that the racial difference in the rate of premature birth is attributable to specific medical and socioeconomic characteristics.\r"

  ".W": "To identify the risk factors responsible for differences in birth weight between blacks and whites, we investigated the effects of four maternal characteristics (age, parity, marital status, and education) on rates of very low birth weight (less than 1500 g) and moderately low birth weight (between 1500 and 2500 g). Using 1983 national data, we found that the black:white rate ratio was 3.0 for very low birth weight and 2.3 for moderately low birth weight. The four maternal factors had directionally similar but quantitatively different effects on very low and moderately low birth weight among blacks and whites. Furthermore, the racial differences in infants' birth weights were greater among low-risk than among high-risk mothers, especially for very low birth weight (black:white ratios of 3.4 and 1.7, respectively). We also examined secular trends in the rates of low birth weight among blacks and whites. Between 1973 and 1983, births of infants with moderately low birth weights decreased more among whites than among blacks, whereas births of infants with very low birth weights increased among blacks and decreased among whites. Fifteen percent of the decline in the rate of moderately low birth weight among whites could be attributed to favorable changes in maternal characteristics (primarily an increase in educational level). Among blacks, adverse changes in maternal characteristics (primarily an increase in births to unmarried women) accounted for 35 percent of the increase in the rate of very low birth weight. The adverse effects of childbearing by teenagers on the outcome of pregnancy among blacks appear to have been overemphasized. The persistence of large racial differences in birth weight, even among mothers at low risk, emphasizes the need for specific targeted interventions to achieve further improvements in infant health.\r"

  ".W": "Case reports of sudden death during exertion have not established an association between the sickle-cell trait (hemoglobin AS) and exercise-related death. To test this association, all deaths occurring among 2 million enlisted recruits during basic training in the U.S. Armed Forces in 1977 to 1981 were classified from autopsy and clinical records as non-sudden deaths or as sudden deaths explained or unexplained by preexisting disease. On the basis of known numbers of entering recruits (according to race, age, and sex) and published prevalence rates for hemoglobin AS (8 percent for black and 0.08 percent for nonblack recruits), death rates (per 100,000) were 32.2 for sudden unexplained deaths, 2.7 for sudden explained deaths, and 0 for non-sudden deaths among black recruits with hemoglobin AS, as compared with 1.2, 1.2, and 0.7 among black recruits without hemoglobin S and 0.7, 0.5, and 1.1 among nonblack recruits without hemoglobin S. Among black recruits the relative risk of sudden unexplained death (hemoglobin AS vs. non-hemoglobin S) was 27.6 (95 percent confidence interval, 9 to 100; P less than 0.001), whereas among all recruits this risk was 39.8 (95 percent confidence interval, 17 to 90; P less than 0.001). The relative risk of sudden unexplained death among all recruits increased with age (P less than 0.04), from 13 (ages 17 to 18) to 95 (ages 26 to 30). We conclude that recruits in basic training with the sickle-cell trait have a substantially increased, age-dependent risk of exercise-related sudden death unexplained by any known preexisting cause.\r"

  ".W": "In patients with hypertension, a pattern of left ventricular hypertrophy on the electrocardiogram is associated with a risk of sudden death in excess of the risk attributable to hypertension alone. We therefore investigated the frequency of complex ventricular arrhythmias by means of 48-hour ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring in 100 treated hypertensive patients, of whom 50 had electrocardiographic evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy and 50 did not, and in 50 normotensive controls. The groups were matched for age, sex, and smoking habits, and the two hypertensive groups were matched for blood-pressure levels before and after antihypertensive therapy. Nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, defined as greater than or equal to 3 complexes at a rate greater than or equal to 120 beats per minute, occurred in 14 (28 percent) of the 50 patients with an electrocardiographic pattern of left ventricular hypertrophy, in 4 (8 percent) of the 50 patients without hypertrophy (P less than 0.05), and in 1 (2 percent) of the control subjects. Eight of the 50 patients (16 percent) with hypertrophy had episodes of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia longer than 5 complexes, whereas no patients without hypertrophy and no controls had such episodes. The group with nonsustained ventricular tachycardia was characterized by a high left ventricular mass on echocardiography and a high prevalence of ST-T abnormalities on electrocardiography. Ventricular tachycardia was not closely related to blood-pressure levels, nor was it associated with diuretic therapy or hypokalemia. The clinical importance of these arrhythmias is uncertain. Nevertheless, our data suggest that complex ventricular arrhythmias occur commonly in hypertensive patients with left ventricular hypertrophy and may contribute to the higher incidence of sudden death in these patients.\r"

Using their methods, we studied teenage suicides in California and Pennsylvania before and after the television broadcast of the same three films. In these states, there was no evidence of an increase in teenage suicides after the films were shown. This remained true when data for New York from the study of Gould and Shaffer were combined with our data from California and Pennsylvania. We conclude that it is premature to be concerned about possibly fatal effects of fictional televised films about suicide.\r"

We conducted a multiinstitutional randomized study of the protective effects of pretreatment with corticosteroids against reactions to intravenous contrast material. We gave 6763 patients two doses of oral corticosteroids (methylprednisolone, 32 mg) approximately 12 hours and 2 hours before challenge with contrast material, one dose of oral prednisolone approximately 2 hours before challenge, or placebo in the same dosages. The two-dose corticosteroid regimen, but not the one-dose regimen, significantly reduced the incidence of reactions of all types (P less than 0.05) except a category of reactions dominated by hives, for which the reduction approached significance (P = 0.055). In recent years, several relatively expensive monomeric nonionic iodinated compounds having approximately half the osmolality of the corresponding ionic compounds and a lower reaction rate have become available. With our two-dose corticosteroid regimen, the incidence of reactions necessitating therapy in patients receiving the ionic medium approximated that reported in an unblinded nonrandomized study of patients receiving a newer intravenous nonionic medium without corticosteroid pretreatment. We conclude that the much less expensive ionic medium, if administered with corticosteroid pretreatment, may serve as a reasonable alternative to intravenous nonionic medium, without loss of safety.\r"

PSA was elevated in 122 of 127 patients with newly diagnosed, untreated prostatic cancer, including 7 of 12 patients with unsuspected early disease and all of 115 with more advanced disease. The PSA level increased with advancing clinical stage and was proportional to the estimated volume of the tumor. The PAP concentration was elevated in only 57 of the patients with cancer and correlated less closely with tumor volume. PSA was increased in 86 percent and PAP in 14 percent of the patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia. After radical prostatectomy for cancer, PSA routinely fell to undetectable levels, with a half-life of 2.2 days. If initially elevated, PAP fell to normal levels within 24 hours but always remained detectable. In six patients followed postoperatively by means of repeated measurements, PSA--but not PAP--appeared to be useful in detecting residual and early recurrence of tumor and in monitoring responses to radiation therapy. Prostate massage increased the levels of both PSA and PAP approximately 1.5 to 2 times. Needle biopsy and transurethral resection increased both considerably. We conclude that PSA is more sensitive than PAP in the detection of prostatic cancer and will probably be more useful in monitoring responses and recurrence after therapy. However, since both PSA and PAP may be elevated in benign prostatic hyperplasia, neither marker is specific.\r"

Condylomata acuminata, papules, and macules were observed in 309 of the 480 men (64.4 percent). In 204 of them (42.5 percent), macules or slightly elevated papules were detected only after application of acetic acid. Condylomata acuminata or lesions showing histologic features of condyloma were found in 121 partners (41.2 percent) of women with condyloma, but in only 10 partners (5.4 percent) of women with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. Penile lesions showing histologic features of intraepithelial neoplasia were found in 61 partners (32.8 percent) of women with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, but in only 4 partners (1.4 percent) of women with flat condyloma. Thirty-six (60 percent) of the 60 macules or papules tested contained papillomavirus DNA sequences. Human papillomavirus types 16 and 33 were almost exclusively found in penile intraepithelial neoplasia. Type 6, type 11, and the recently recognized type 42 were found in lesions showing features of condyloma or minimal histologic changes. As yet uncharacterized papillomaviruses were found in 15 percent of the specimens. These data support the concept that cervical carcinomas and precancerous lesions in women may be associated with genital papillomavirus infection in their male sexual partners.\r"

Genomic DNA was extracted from 39 tumor specimens obtained by thoracotomy and was examined for activating point mutations in codons 12, 13, and 61 of the H-ras, K-ras, and N-ras genes. A novel, highly sensitive assay based on oligonucleotide hybridization following an in vitro amplification step was employed. The K-ras gene was found to be activated by point mutations in codon 12 in 5 of 10 adenocarcinomas. Two of these tumors were less than 2 cm in size and had not metastasized. No ras gene mutations were observed in 15 squamous-cell carcinomas, 10 large-cell carcinomas, 1 carcinoid, 2 metastatic adenocarcinomas from primary tumors outside the lung, and 1 small-cell carcinoma. An approximately 20-fold amplification of the unmutated K-ras gene was observed in a tumor that proved to be a solitary lung metastasis of a rectal carcinoma. We conclude that mutational K-ras activation may be an important early event in the pathogenesis of adenocarcinoma of the lung but that amplification of ras genes or mutational activation of H-ras or N-ras does not play a major part in non-small-cell lung cancer.\r"

  ".W": "In the early decades of the century a number of geneticists and psychologists believed that intelligence in the economically advanced nations was in secular decline. Contrary to this expectation, recent data for a number of countries have shown that intelligence has been increasing at rates far greater than hitherto considered probable. A compilation of this data by Flynn for 14 economically advanced nations has shown that intelligence quotient (IQ) rises have generally been within the range of 2-12 IQ points per decade. These recent studies raise several questions, among which are precisely what abilities have been increasing over time; and whether existing data are correct in suggesting that the secular rise in Britain is lower than that in other countries. We report here that in English children there has been an increase over the past 50 years of 12.42 IQ points, averaging 2.48 points per decade. The increase has been in fluid intelligence, the mental power that underlies the acquisition of cognitive skills, rather than in crystallized intelligence, which represents the cognitive skills acquired in a particular culture.\r"

DIF-1, the major bioactive species after purification, has now been identified using a combined microchemical, spectroscopic and synthetic approach. The structure is defined as 1-(3,5-dichloro-2,6-dihydroxy-4-methoxyphenyl)-1-hexanone, and represents a new class of effector molecule. The availability of relatively large quantities of synthetic and isotopically labelled materials should now allow progress towards a detailed understanding of the pattern-forming processes in Dictyostelium development.\r"

  ".U": "87315338\r", 
  ".W": "Exocytosis, or the fusion of cytoplasmic vesicles with the cell membrane, occurs in nearly all eukaryotic cells, but its mechanism is not understood. Morphological and electrophysiological studies have suggested that membrane fusion begins with the formation of a 'fusion pore', a narrow channel across the closely adjacent membranes of vesicle and cell that forms the first connection of the vesicle lumen with the cell exterior and later dilates to allow release of vesicle contents. We used the patch clamp technique to study exocytosis of single giant secretory vesicles in mast cells of beige mice. The first opening of the fusion pore was found to generate a brief current transient, whose size and direction indicated an initial pore conductance of about 230 pS and a lumen-positive vesicle membrane potential. In time-resolved a.c. admittance measurements, the pore conductance was found to increase to much larger values within milliseconds, as if the pore dilated soon after opening. We conclude that the earliest fusion event may be the formation of a structure similar to an ion channel. Its conductance is of the same order of magnitude as that of a single gap junction channel, the only other known channel that spans two membranes.\r"

  ".W": "Knowledge of how genes are regulated during the cell cycle is essential for understanding the process of cell growth on a molecular level. Numerous studies have established that, as mammalian cells go through the cell cycle, histone mRNA levels change, the largest amount being produced in the S phase. Both transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms are responsible for this regulation and it has recently been demonstrated that nucleotide sequences in both the 5' and 3' termini of the histone gene are involved. From deletion analysis of a hamster H3.2 fusion gene, we report here that the crucial control signals for both cell-cycle regulation and high level expression in vivo are contained in a 32-nucleotide (nt) region about 150 nt upstream of the TATA sequence and do not require any histone protein coding sequence. By comparison, the promoter of the herpes simplex virus (HSV) thymidine kinase gene is serum-stimulated but not cell-cycle regulated. The cell-cycle control exerted by the histone DNA regulatory element acts at the transcriptional level, as the rate of transcription is stimulated during the DNA synthetic phase of the cell cycle. Using DNA-protein mobility shift experiments, we demonstrate the existence of high affinity cellular factors interacting with the histone H3.2 promoter sequence. The concentration of the protein-DNA complexes shows cell-cycle variation, particularly during the transition from late G1 to the DNA synthesis phase. These data provide evidence for in vivo interactions between the cell-cycle transcriptional regulatory factors and the cis-acting DNA domain.\r"

  ".W": "Protein structures are stabilized by hydrophobic and van der Waals forces, and by hydrogen bonds. The relation between these thermodynamic quantities and the actual three-dimensional structure of proteins can not be calculated precisely. However, certain empirical relations have been discovered. Hydrophobic energy is gained by the reduction of surface in contact with water. For monomeric proteins, the area of the surface accessible to solvent, and of that buried in the interior, is a simple function of molecular weight. Proteins with different shapes and secondary structures, but of the same molecular weight, have the same accessible surface area. It has been argued that there is no similar relationship for large oligomeric proteins. In this paper we show that the surface areas of oligomeric proteins, and the areas of the surface buried within them, are directly related to relative molecular mass. Although oligomers of the same molecular weight bury the same amounts of surface, the proportions buried within and between subunits vary. This has important implications for the role of subunit interfaces in the stability and activity of oligomeric proteins.\r"

  ".W": "The sinking of particulate organic matter from the euphotic zone is an important pathway for the vertical transport of many elements and organic compounds in the sea. Many natural and artificial radionuclides in surface waters are readily adsorbed onto suspended particles and are presumably scavenged and removed to depth on time scales commensurate with both particle sinking rate and retention time of the radionuclide on the particle. Previously, abyssal benthic organisms from the northeast Pacific were found to contain short-lived fission products which entered the sea surface as fallout from nuclear testing. The presence of these radionuclides at great depth could not be explained by Stokesian settling of small fallout particles and it was hypothesized that zooplankton grazing in the surface layers packaged these particle-reactive radionuclides into large, relatively dense faecal pellets which rapidly sank to depth. We report here data from a time-series sediment trap experiment and concomitant zooplankton collections which show conclusively that Chernobyl radioactivity, in particular the rare earth nuclides 141Ce and 144Ce, entering the Mediterranean as a single pulse, was rapidly removed from surface waters and transported to 200 m in a few days primarily by zooplankton grazing.\r"

Previous physiological studies of the giraffe have concentrated on arterial blood pressures in the heart and neck. Briefly, these investigations revealed that arterial pressure near the giraffe heart is about twice that in humans, to provide more normal blood pressure and perfusion to the brain. Another important question is that of how giraffes avoid pooling of blood and tissue fluid (oedema) in dependent tissues of their extremities. As monitored by radiotelemetry, the blood and tissue fluid pressures that govern transcapillary exchange vary greatly with exercise. These pressures, combined with a tight skin layer, move fluid upward against gravity. Other mechanisms that prevent oedema include precapillary vasoconstriction and low permeability of capillaries to plasma proteins.\r"

We have observed lesions characteristic of treponemal infection in a Pleistocene bear from Indiana (dated 11,500 years BP) which give a positive result when tested with the antisera used by the US Center for Disease Control for verification of syphilis infection.

Because gene induction and axonal transport are relatively slow, there may also be a need for a distinct form of intermediate memory to bridge the short- and long-term processes. We now report that a protocol producing long-term sensitization results in a decrease in the amount of regulatory subunits of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase in animals 24 h after training, with no effect on the catalytic subunit. The loss appears to be post-translational. Because a decrease in the ratio of regulatory to catalytic subunits would result in elevated kinase activity after cAMP has returned to its unstimulated concentration in sensory cells, it could be the molecular mechanism of intermediate memory.\r"

  ".W": "In aged rodents, impairments in learning and memory have been associated with an age-dependent decline in forebrain of cholinergic function, and recent evidence indicates that the cholinergic neurons in the nucleus basalis magnocellularis, the septal-diagonal band area and the striatum undergo age-dependent atrophy. Thus, as in Alzheimer-type dementia in man, degenerative changes in the forebrain cholinergic system may contribute to age-related cognitive impairments in rodents. The cause of these degenerative changes is not known. Recent studies have shown that the central cholinergic neurons in the septal-diagonal band area, nucleus basalis and striatum are sensitive to the neurotrophic protein nerve growth factor (NGF). In particular, intraventricular injections or infusions of NGF in young adult rats have been shown to prevent retrograde neuronal cell death and promote behavioural recovery after damage to the septo-hippocampal connections. It is so far not known, however, whether the atrophic cholinergic neurons in aged animals are responsive to NGF treatment. We report here that continuous intracerebral infusion of NGF over a period of four weeks can partly reverse the cholinergic cell body atrophy and improve retention of a spatial memory task in behaviourally impaired aged rats.\r"

  ".W": "Substantial evidence has implicated Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) in the aetiology of two human neoplasms, nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) and Burkitt's lymphoma. This is supported by the presence of high antibody titres to EBV early antigen and virus capsid antigen, as well as antibody to two viral-associated enzymes, DNase and DNA polymerase. Patients with NPC, particularly the undifferentiated form, are commonly found to have EBV DNA in the tumour. Ito and others have presented strong epidemiological evidence that phorbol esters are related to the unusual geographic distribution of NPC in southeastern regions of China. There appears to be a close link between the widespread EBV infection of the Asian population and the distinct regional distribution in China of plants that produce diterpene ester. Naturally occurring phorbol esters are produced by plants of the Euphorbiaceae and Thymelaeaceae, which are used as traditional herbal medicines. Although it has been established that EBV can infect epithelial cells isolated from NPC as well as certain normal epithelial cells, there has been no in vitro evidence that EBV induces neoplastic transformation in normal human epithelial cells with or without exposure to phorbol esters. We report here evidence that transformation of normal human epithelial cells results from exposure to infectious EBV and that transformation is dependent on the presence of phorbol esters.\r"

Recent studies of high-affinity interactions between the receptors and discrete regions of DNA, together with gene-transfer experiments, have led to the precise mapping of hormone regulatory elements. Nothing is known, however, about the mechanisms whereby DNA-bound receptors modulate gene transcription. At the start of transcription in prokaryotes two oligomeric molecules of several regulatory proteins must bind to two specific DNA sites and interact with one another to regulate the binding of RNA polymerase to DNA. Using electron microscopy to observe progesterone receptor binding to regulatory regions of uteroglobin and mouse mammary tumour virus genes, we demonstrate a similar binding between receptor oligomers at two DNA sites. DNA loops are formed when the hormone regulatory elements are at a distance from one another. Thus, in common with certain prokaryotic systems, protein-protein interactions may be important in steroid hormone regulation of gene transcription.\r"

Protein S from the spore coat of the Gram-negative bacterium Myxococcus xanthus has been shown to resemble calmodulin in its internally-duplicated structure and ability to bind calcium. However, it has a beta-sheet secondary structure rather than the helix-loop-helix arrangement of the eukaryotic proteins. We have determined the complete amino-acid sequence of a calcium-binding protein from the Gram-positive bacterium \"Streptomyces erythraeus\" by cloning and sequencing the corresponding gene. It contains four EF-hand motifs bearing remarkable sequence similarity to the calcium-binding sites in calmodulin. This implies that the EF-hand super-family may have evolved from ancient proteins present in prokaryotes.\r"

Suggestions that the stoichiometry in mitochondria is intrinsically variable ('slip' in the pumps) have been made but the evidence has been neither strong nor direct. We now show by direct measurement in steady-state conditions that the H+/O ratio (measured as the charge/O ratio) for isolated mitochondria respiring on succinate varies from 6 at low membrane potential to 2.5-3 at membrane potentials of about 170 mV.\r"

Although immunoglobulin promoters are tissue-specific, the octamer is also a functional element in non-tissue-specific upstream regions--like those controlling U1 and U2 small nuclear RNA and histone H2B genes--where it is associated with additional canonical elements. Specific interactions occur between the octamer motif and both lymphoid-specific and ubiquitous proteins. By using a synthetic octamer oligonucleotide inserted upstream of the beta-globin TATA box we show here that the octamer element by itself is sufficient for directing lymphocyte-specific RNA synthesis when within 70 base pairs of the start site of transcription. We also demonstrate that mutations in any position of the conserved motif interfere with this function.\r"

With this preparation we have examined the effect of activating protein kinase C in astrocytes with a phorbol ester, TPA (12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate). In most cells, TPA induced rhythmic oscillations (0.1-3.0 Hz) of membrane potential which were typically 5-10 mV in amplitude and were associated with increases of up to eightfold in input resistance during the depolarizing phase. These large changes in membrane conductance are the first reported observations of endogenously generated conductance changes in astrocytes of the mammalian CNS and they could influence excitability of surrounding neurons, possibly by altering extracellular ion concentrations.\r"

The dynamics of protonation reactions have been studied extensively in solution and in model systems involving lipid-water interfaces, but have never been resolved at the timescale of the elementary molecular event. Here we show that, under appropriate conditions, binding and unbinding reactions of single protons and deuterium ions to a single site on the L-type calcium channel can be resolved and the protonation and deprotonation rates quantified. The protonation rate constant considerably exceeds previous estimates obtained in simpler systems. The functional consequences of channel protonation is a threefold reduction of the channel conductance, independent of the applied voltage. The data are consistent with the presence of a single protonatable group with pK in the physiological pH range, close to the external mouth of the channel. The two conductance levels of the open channel might be explained by greatly differing local potentials associated with the protonated and deprotonated state of the group.\r"

  ".W": "From the first high-resolution structure of a repressor bound specifically to its DNA recognition sequence it has been shown that the phage 434 repressor protein binds as a dimer to the helix. Tight, local interactions are made at the ends of the binding site, causing the central four base pairs (bp) to become bent and overtwisted. The centre of the operator is not in contact with protein but repressor binding affinity can be reduced at least 50-fold in response to a sequence change there. This observation might be explained should the structure of the intervening DNA segment vary with its sequence, or if DNA at the centre of the operator resists the torsional and bending deformation necessary for complex formation in a sequence dependent fashion. We have considered the second hypothesis by demonstrating that DNA stiffness is sequence dependent. A method is formulated for calculating the stiffness of any particular DNA sequence, and we show that this predicted relationship between sequence and stiffness can explain the repressor binding data in a quantitative manner. We propose that the elastic properties of DNA may be of general importance to an understanding of protein-DNA binding specificity.\r"

These experiments have also revealed that the two forms have very different folding kinetics, although the possibility that one component is an obligatory intermediate for the folding of the other form could be discounted. Here we report NMR data which show that alternative unfolded states are also distinguishable. These observations led us to hypothesize that cis/trans isomerism at a single peptide bond between a proline and its preceding residue might be the origin of the conformational multiplicity. Proline 117 was identified as a likely candidate for the site concerned and a mutant protein, in which Pro 117 was replaced by Gly, was constructed in order to test this. Alternative conformations are not observed in the spectrum of this mutant, lending powerful support to this hypothesis.\r"

  ".U": "87315442\r", 
  ".W": "Receptor-mediated increases in intracellular Ca2+ levels can be caused by release from intracellular organelles and/or influx from the extracellular fluid. Noradrenaline (NA) released from sympathetic nerves acts on alpha 1-adrenoceptors to increase cytosolic Ca2+ and promote smooth muscle contraction. In many cells activation of alpha 1-adrenoceptors causes formation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate which promotes Ca2+ release from intracellular stores. The mechanism by which receptor activation opens cell surface Ca2+ channels is not known, although in some cases it may be secondary to formation of inositol phosphates or release of stored intracellular Ca2+ (ref. 3). However, alpha 1-adrenoceptors have recently been shown to have different pharmacological properties in different tissues, and it has been proposed that different alpha 1-adrenoceptor subtypes may control mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ and gating of extracellular Ca2+ influx. We here report evidence for two subtypes of alpha 1-adrenoceptors which cause contractile responses through different molecular mechanisms. One subtype stimulates inositol phosphate (InsP) formation and causes contractions which are independent of extracellular Ca2+, and the other does not stimulate inositol phosphate formation and causes contractions which require the influx of extracellular Ca2+ through dihydropyridine-sensitive channels. These results suggest that neurotransmitters and hormones may control Ca2+ release from intracellular stores and influx through voltage-gated membrane channels through distinct receptor subtypes.\r"

  ".U": "87315446\r", 
  ".W": "Human hepatitis delta (delta) virus (HDV) is a form of defective virus, which infects humans only in the presence of a co-infecting hepatitis B virus (HBV). HDV superinfection in a chronic HBV carrier often results in severe chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis, whereas acute HDV and HBV co-infection is frequently associated with fulminant hepatitis. HDV consists of a 36-nm particle, which contains an envelope with HBV surface antigen, and a nucleocapsid containing the hepatitis delta-antigen (HDAg) and an RNA genome of 1.75 kilobases (kb). Recently, the genomic RNA from an HDV serially passaged in chimpanzees has been cloned and sequenced in a study which showed that the HDV RNA is a single-stranded circular molecule with properties similar to those of viroid or virusoid. However, it is not known whether serial passages in chimpanzees had altered the properties of human HDV. Here we report the cloning and sequencing of an HDV RNA isolated directly from a patient with acute delta-hepatitis. The sequence showed considerable divergence (11%) from that of the chimpanzee-adapted HDV. Five open reading frames (ORFs) of more than 100 amino acids in both genomic and anti-genomic sense were found. The largest ORF in antigenomic sense, which can code for 214 amino acids, may correspond to the HDAg.\r"

In plants and some bacteria, this enzyme has an L8S8 structure, where L is the large catalytic subunit and S is the small subunit of unknown function. The molecule resembles a keg 105 A along the 4-fold axis and 132 A in diameter at the widest point of the keg. Here we describe the quaternary structure of RuBisCO from N. tabacum, the first L8S8 type known from an X-ray crystallographic study at near-atomic resolution (3 A). The structure shows that all eight L subunits are elongated along the 4-fold axis so that the molecule cannot be simply described as layers of subunits, as it had been from studies by electron microscopy. The structure, with its elongated and interdigitated L subunits, is evidence against a large, sliding-layer conformational change in plant RuBisCO, as proposed recently in Nature for the same enzyme from Alcaligenes eutrophus.\r"

In each case, 2 years elapsed before progressive functional decline or behavioral disabilities supervened. Radiologic studies documented asymmetric left cerebral atrophy that was progressive. The structure of the language disintegration was distinctive and not like that in Alzheimer's disease. Pathologic studies performed at postmortem examination of one patient documented asymmetric cerebral atrophy with nonspecific histopathologic changes. Biochemical studies revealed normal tissue levels of choline acetyltransferase activity, but reduced somatostatin-like immunoreactivity. Since cerebral somatostatin is largely present in intrinsic cortical neurons, while cholinergic innervation is largely derived from the basal forebrain, these findings suggest that nonfamilial dysphasic dementia may be an example of a distinct class of dementia due to intrinsic cortical degeneration, with sparing of the basal forebrain.\r"

  ".U": "87315844\r", 
  ".W": "Muscle fibers with hypercontracted zones (contractures) and plasma membrane defects are relatively frequent in Duchenne dystrophy, but artifacts might account for either. To investigate the problem further, we determined the frequency of hypercontracted muscle fibers in longitudinal, trichrome-stained paraffin sections in 143 muscle biopsy specimens in a wide variety of muscle diseases. The specimens were held at rest length during fixation. The incidence of hypercontracted fibers in Duchenne dystrophy was significantly higher than in any of the other diseases or in normal controls. We also induced contractures in rat muscle by fixation without restraint, electrical stimulation, and cutting the muscle fibers in vivo. Electron-microscopy showed no plasma membrane defects associated with the contractures, except in the cut fibers within 25 micron of their cut ends, which were probably overloaded with calcium. The results indicate that (1) in Duchenne dystrophy the contractures in muscle fibers held at rest length during fixation cannot be accounted for by artifact; (2) contractures occurring in normal muscle during fixation do not in and of themselves cause rupture of the muscle fiber plasma membrane.\r"

Three cases recovered completely. Large posterior internal capsule lesions were associated with more frequent impairment on a cancellation test. The probable mechanism of hemispatial neglect was attentional in one case and intentional in six. Visual and auditory extinction is explained by striatonigral mechanisms. Although subcortical structures participate in attentional and intentional behavior, cortical structures can substitute for their functions.\r"

Recognition of lumbrical sparing supports the electrodiagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome when the distal latency to thenar muscles or the palm-to-wrist mixed median nerve conduction velocity is normal.\r"
