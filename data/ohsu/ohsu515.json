  ".W": "A randomised, double blind, placebo controlled, crossover study of digoxin withdrawal and reintroduction was carried out over two periods of eight weeks each after long term treatment. Forty four patients with stable heart failure in sinus rhythm and plasma digoxin concentrations over 0.8 ng/ml were studied. Their progress was assessed by clinical criteria, by haemodynamic measurements (systolic time intervals and echocardiography), and by pharmacological measurements of erythrocytic sodium pump numbers and activity. After withdrawal of digoxin clinical deterioration occurred in only 25% of the patients. Furthermore, in only 9% of cases was digoxin reintroduction thought to be necessary. There was deterioration in only 11% of the patients during digoxin treatment. Deterioration during digoxin withdrawal was accompanied by changes in systolic time intervals, but similar, albeit smaller changes in systolic time intervals also occurred in patients with no deterioration. Deterioration was accompanied by changes in the pharmacological effects of digoxin on the erythrocytes, consistent with a loss of effect, and these changes did not occur in those who did not deteriorate. The occurrence of deterioration could not be predicted by any clinical, haemodynamic, or pharmacological measurements made before withdrawal.\r"

Four patients did not return for follow-up treatment. Of the remaining 18 patients, 12 had plantar warts, the other six had warts on the hands that were mainly periungual. The median duration of the warts prior to laser treatment was 5 years. The areas treated were solitary in eight and multiple in 10 cases. After an average follow-up period of 10 months (minimum 6 months), all of the treated areas were clear of warts in 10 patients (56%), some had cleared in three, and all the treated warts had relapsed in the other five patients. Side-effects were commonly observed, especially post-operative pain, temporary loss of function of the treated part and scarring. The use of the CO2 laser may clear otherwise resistant viral warts but a significant morbidity may occur with this method of treatment.\r"

  ".U": "89335650\r", 
  ".W": "Changes in sex hormones and bone turnover were studied longitudinally in 31 women aged 47-54 years who were approaching the menopause. Every 6 weeks for 2-3 years, hormones and biochemical estimates of the bone turnover were determined and the bone mass was measured at two forearm sites by single photon absorptiometry. Spinal bone mass was measured every 6 months. The bone turnover was normal in women aged 47-54 years with regular menstruation, whereas the estimates of bone resorption were high in the women with irregular menstruation. In nine women, who reached the menopause during the study, bone resorption increased significantly, whereas bone formation showed only a small increase. When the results of the nine women were combined with those of 50 women, who had passed a natural menopause within the preceding 3.5 years, the bone resorption indices reached their peak within the first postmenopausal year, whereas bone formation increased until 1.5-2 years after the last menstrual cycle. At the ultradistal forearm site the rate of bone loss was maximal (5% per year) immediately after the menopause and subsequently declined, which suggests that trabecular bone is more sensitive than cortical bone to changes in bone turnover. Spinal bone loss was identical in late peri- and early postmenopausal women. We conclude that bone resorption starts to increase during the last perimenopausal years, with a beginning acceleration in bone loss, which then becomes sharp after the menopause. The changes are related to the decline in oestrogens, but other mechanisms may also play a role.\r"

It occurred in all age groups and was due mainly to an increase in emergency admissions for acute common childhood illnesses, particularly respiratory and gastro-intestinal diseases. There was no evidence that increasing morbidity accounted for this rise; the change was due to factors in medical care. Over the 11 years the median length of stay fell from 2.4 to 1.5 days and by 1985 40% of children were discharged within a day after admission. The increase in admissions was due to lower thresholds for admission resulting in part from the increased availability of beds because of the diminishing lengths of stay.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To evaluate the effect of support with human chorionic gonadotrophin in the luteal phase in women taking part in an in vitro fertilisation programme after buserelin and human menopausal gonadotrophin were used to hyperstimulate their ovaries. DESIGN--Controlled group comparison. SETTING--Outpatient department of a private hospital. PATIENTS--115 Women with indications for in vitro fertilisation, all of whom had at least one embryo transferred. INTERVENTIONS--After suppression of the pituitary with buserelin the ovaries of all the women were stimulated with human menopausal gonadotrophin on day 4 of the luteal phase. Human chorionic gonadotrophin (10,000 IU) was given to induce ovulation, and oocytes were recovered 34 hours later. Embryos were transferred 46 to 48 hours after insemination. Women who had received the 10,000 IU of human chorionic gonadotrophin on a date that was an uneven number (n = 61) were allocated to receive support doses of 2500 IU human chorionic gonadotrophin three and six days after that date. The remaining 54 women did not receive hormonal support. END POINT--Determination of the rates of pregnancy. MEASUREMENTS and main results--Support with human chorionic gonadotrophin did not significantly alter the progesterone or oestradiol concentrations in the early or mid-luteal phase. The mean (range) progesterone concentrations in the late luteal phase in women who did not become pregnant were, however, significantly higher in those who received support (16(9-110) nmol/l nu 8(4-46) nmol/l), and the luteal phase was significantly longer in this group (14 days nu 12 days). The rate of pregnancy was significantly higher in the women who received support than in those who did not (25/61 nu 8/54). CONCLUSIONS--When buserelin and human menopausal gonadotrophin are used to hyperstimulate ovaries support with human chorionic gonadotrophin in the luteal phase has a beneficial effect on in vitro fertilisation.\r"

Corrected response rates were 83% for women and 72% for men. In women, but not in men, there was a rise in the risk of falling from 45 years, peaking in the 55-59 year age group, and sinking to a nadir at ages 70-74. In both sexes rates rose in extreme old age. These variations were not attributable to preferential response from people who had suffered a fracture. It is concluded that changes in the risk of falling interact with osteoporosis to produce a perimenopausal rise in the incidence of forearm fractures and contribute to the fluctuations in incidence of these fractures in old age.\r"

DESIGN--An open, non-randomised cohort study of flushing and non-flushing menopausal women. A before and after investigation of the effects of vaginal oestriol treatment on the circulation. SETTING--Referral based endocrinology clinic. PATIENTS--88 Consecutive menopausal women, 63 complaining of frequent hot flushes and 25 who had not flushed for at least a year. INTERVENTION--Treatment with vaginal oestriol 0.5 mg at night for six weeks in 18 of the women who had hot flushes. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS--Peripheral blood flow was measured by venous occlusion plethysmography at rest and in response to stressful mental arithmetic and anoxic forearm exercises. Blood flow in the forearm and its variability were significantly higher in flushing than in non-flushing women (4.1 (SD 1.7) and 3.1 (0.9) ml/100 ml tissue/min and 17% and 13% respectively). Blood pressure, heart rate, and blood flow in the hand were, however, similar in the two groups. No difference was found in the peripheral incremental response to either stress or anoxic exercise. Vaginal oestriol significantly lowered forearm blood flow from 4.4 (1.5) to 3.3 (1.1) ml/100 ml tissue/min but dilator responsiveness was unaffected. CONCLUSIONS--The peripheral circulation is different in menopausal women who have hot flushes compared with those who do not, with selective vasodilatation in the forearm. The lowered blood flow in the forearm after vaginal oestriol in flushing women may be relevant to the alleviation of vasomotor symptoms induced by oestrogen treatment.\r"

The health states of 122 nations were measured by reference to their infant mortality in 1965 and the changes that occurred over the next 20 years. Countries with low infant mortality in 1965 (for example, Japan and East Germany) achieved substantial, further declines over the 20 years, whereas in countries such as Rwanda and Ethiopia infant mortality hardly declined at all or even increased (Ethiopia 165/1000 to 168/1000). In 48 countries for which data were available there was a close link between the change in health state of a people and the ratio of government expenditure on health and defence. As the ratio increased in favour of defence, so the improvement in health state of a people declined; the reverse was also true. At the primary care level disparity in uptake of care both among and within communities was associated with literacy and socioeconomic state, services inadvertently being aimed at those sections most likely to benefit. The forces that act to produce this setting of unequal care must be checked at both national and primary levels if we are to have \"Health for All by the Year 2000.\"\r"

As hyperthyroidism might have recurred after potassium perchlorate treatment was stopped the dose of methimazole was not reduced until biochemical hypothyroidism (raised thyroid stimulating hormone concentrations) was achieved. The patients became euthyroid (free triiodothyronine concentration returned to normal values) in two to five weeks and hypothyroid in 10 to 14 weeks. One patient became euthyroid while taking 5 mg methimazole a day and 600 mg amiodarone weekly; the two others required substitution treatment with thyroxine sodium while taking 5 mg methimazole or 50 mg propylthiouracil (because of an allergic reaction to methimazole) and 2100 or 1400 mg amiodarone weekly. Hyperthyroidism induced by amiodarone may be treated with potassium perchlorate and methimazole given simultaneously while treatment with amiodarone is continued.\r"

SETTING--One third of the primary schools in Edinburgh. SUBJECTS--892 Children aged 6 1/2 to 7 1/2 were examined, and satisfactory tympanograms were obtained in 872. Results of assay of salivary cotinine concentrations were available for 770 children, and satisfactory tympanograms were available for 736 of these. END POINT--Correlation of the prevalence of middle ear underpressure and effusion with concentrations of the marker of nicotine, cotinine, in the saliva of the children. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS--Middle ear pressure and compliance were measured in both ears by impedance tympanometry. Salivary cotinine concentrations were assayed by gas-liquid chromatography. Cotinine concentrations increased with the number of smokers in the household. Girls had higher concentrations than boys, and children living in rented housing had higher concentrations than those living in housing owned by their parents. There was a trend towards more abnormal tympanometric findings with increasing cotinine concentration, the odds ratio for a doubling of the cotinine concentration being 1.14 (95% confidence interval 1.03 to 1.27). After adjustment for the sex of the child and housing tenure the odds ratio for a doubling of the cotinine concentration was 1.13 (1.00 to 1.28). CONCLUSIONS--The results of this study are consistent with those of case-control studies of children attending for an operation to relieve middle ear effusion. They indicate that the disease should be added to the list of recognised hazards associated with passive smoking. About one third of the cases of middle ear effusion in this study were statistically attributable to exposure to tobacco smoke.\r"

Mortality in the two treatment groups was examined in thirds of treated systolic and diastolic blood pressures. PATIENTS--339 And 352 patients allocated to placebo and active treatment, respectively. The groups were similar at randomisation in sex ratio (70% women), mean age (71.5 years), blood pressure (182/101 mm Hg), and proportion of patients with cardiovascular complications (35%). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS--In the placebo group total mortality rose with increasing systolic pressure whereas it had a U shaped relation with diastolic pressure, the total lowest mortality being in patients in the middle third of the distribution of diastolic pressure. In the group given active treatment total mortality showed a U shaped relation with systolic pressure and an inverse association with treated diastolic pressure. In both groups cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular mortality followed the same trends as total mortality. The increased mortality in the lowest thirds of pressure was not associated with an increased proportion of patients with cardiovascular complications at randomisation or with a fall in diastolic pressure exceeding the median fall in pressure in each group. In contrast, patients in the lowest thirds of pressure showed greater decreases in body weight and haemoglobin concentration than those in the middle and upper thirds of pressure. CONCLUSIONS--In patients taking active treatment total mortality was increased in the lowest thirds of treated systolic and diastolic blood pressures. This increased mortality is not necessarily explained by an exaggerated reduction in pressure induced by drugs as for diastolic pressure a U shaped relation also existed during treatment with placebo. In addition, patients in the lowest thirds of systolic and diastolic pressures were characterised by decreases in body weight and haemoglobin concentration, and the patients in the lowest thirds of diastolic pressure taking active treatment also by an increased non-cardiovascular mortality, suggesting some deterioration of general health.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To investigate the prevalence and diagnosis of chronic respiratory disease in adults. DESIGN--Screening questionnaire was sent to all patients aged 40-70 on the register of a group general practice; those responding positively were sent a detailed questionnaire and invited for assessment of respiratory function by forced expiratory volume in one second, forced vital capacity, peak flow rate, and reversibility studies with a beta adrenergic inhaler. SETTING--Group general practice in south west London. RESULTS--Of 2387 patients aged 40-70, 1444 completed a screening questionnaire. Of the 509 patients who reported cough, phlegm, wheeze, or shortness of breath, 324 responded to a detailed questionnaire, 256 of whom had simple respiratory function assessed. Chronic bronchitis affected 106 (17%) men and 58 (7%) women, and wheeze occurring at least once a week affected 60 (9%) men and 20 (3%) women. Only a half to a third of patients had received a diagnostic label of chronic bronchitis or asthma for their symptoms. There was considerable clinical and physiological similarity (including reversibility of the airways) between patients labelled as having asthma and having chronic bronchitis. A label of asthma was used more often for patients of social classes I and II. CONCLUSIONS--Comparison with prevalence surveys carried out in the 1950s showed that respiratory symptoms are as common now as then, but the risk of disabling chronic bronchitis has fallen, more among men than women, probably because of their reduced smoking. Changes in diagnostic fashion, together with increased detection, may have contributed to the upward trend in reported morbidity from asthma over the past 30 years.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To assess adherence to recommendations for an early repeat cervical smear test in women with reports of cytological abnormalities, and to evaluate the impact of reminder letters to medical practitioners when such smear tests are overdue. DESIGN--Observational study. SETTING--Cytology (gynaecological) service for Victoria, Australia. SUBJECTS--Two groups of women who had abnormal cervical smears during 1985. Women in group A had some evidence of an important dysplasia and were advised to have a repeat smear in three months' time whereas women in group B had a less serious abnormality and were advised to have a repeat smear test in six months' time. In all, 971 of the 1036 women in group A and 1401 of the 1464 women in group B were eligible to have a repeat smear analysed by the service. INTERVENTION--If a repeat smear had not been received within three months of the recommended date a reminder letter generated by the service's computer was sent to the medical practitioner who had taken the smear. END POINT--Thirty six months after the report on the abnormal smear was issued. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS--In all, 870 (90%) of the women in group A and 1154 (82%) of the women in group B had a repeat smear test. The mean time to a repeat test was 3.0 months (95% confidence interval 0.5 to 16.4) in group A and 6.0 months (1.2 to 30.3) in group B. The reminder letter to the practitioner potentially increased the rate of return for a repeat smear test by 18% in group A and 24% in group B. Adherence to the recommendation for a repeat test increased with increasing age. CONCLUSIONS--Achieving high rates of follow up smear tests and appropriate management in women with cytological abnormalities is critical to the impact of a screening programme for cervical cancer. The reminder system used in this study was not labour intensive or expensive and provided a fail safe mechanism for ensuring that reports of abnormal smears were not overlooked.\r"

SETTING--Rural community in Bangladesh being served by international health organisation. PARTICIPANTS--1011 Children aged under 5, of whom 66 died. END POINT--Efficient screening method for identifying malnourished children at risk of dying. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS--Weight was measured every month. Weight for age and monthly change in weight averaged over one and three months were calculated. Sensitivity and specificity curves were used to compare the values of these two variables in identifying children with a high risk of dying. Weight for age was more sensitive than change in weight at all levels of specificity. Changes in weight, however, were independently related to the risk of dying even when intercurrent diseases and low weight for age were taken into account. CONCLUSIONS--For identifying children with a high risk of dying weight for age is a more efficient screening tool than a recent change in weight. Growth monitoring as currently recommended for primary health care programmes in developing countries does not seem to be the most effective approach in identifying children in need of urgent help.\r"

Two thousand subjects needed for study to have a 90% chance of detecting a difference in survival rate of 7% with 95% significance. Patients were followed up until June 1988, giving follow up of 158-216 months. SETTING--A multicentre trial mainly drawing patients from centres in the United Kingdom. PATIENTS--2800 Women presenting with clinical stage I or II carcinoma of the breast from June 1970 to April 1975. INTERVENTIONS--One group of women (n = 1376) had simple mastectomy followed by immediate postoperative radiotherapy (1320 to 1510 rets). The remaining women (n = 1424) had simple mastectomy with subsequent careful observation of the axilla, radiotherapy being delayed until there was obvious progression or recurrence of disease locally. END POINT--Increased mortality in patients treated with radiotherapy from causes other than breast cancer. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS--Survival was measured from time of first treatment to death or last follow up. Deaths from any cause and from specified causes were counted as events. Comparison over the whole follow up showed a slight excess mortality in the group treated with radiotherapy (relative risk 1.04; 95% confidence interval 0.94 to 1.15). The relative risk of death from breast cancer was 0.97 (0.87 to 1.08) but that of death from other causes was 1.37 (1.09 to 1.72), the increase mainly being in women who had had tumours of the left breast (1.61 (1.17 to 2.24)) and had been treated with orthovoltage (1.85 (1.27 to 2.71)). Analysis of causes of death after five years showed a relative risk of 2.11 (1.25 to 3.59) for new malignancies and of 1.65 (1.05 to 2.58) for cardiac disease, the increase in cardiac mortality being most pronounced in patients who had had tumours of the left breast and whose treatment had included orthovoltage radiation (relative risk 2.67 (1.28 to 5.55)). CONCLUSIONS--Adjuvant radiotherapy after simple mastectomy for early breast cancer produces a small excess late mortality from other cancers and cardiac disease. The risk has to be balanced against the higher risk of local recurrence when immediate postoperative radiotherapy is not given. The balance has to be assessed for each patient, and for many patients radiotherapy will still be desirable in the initial treatment of their early breast cancer.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to obtain information on the dietary knowledge of primary health care workers and on their ability to apply this knowledge in practice. A total of 128 primary health care workers (53 general practitioners and 61 nurses) in 12 practices and 14 primary care facilitators were surveyed by questionnaire between December 1987 and June 1988. All of the practices were participating in a project to promote prevention in primary care and offered health checks designed to identify and deal with cardiovascular risk factors. The questionnaire focused on issues related to managing patients with moderate hypercholesterolaemia. The results of the study showed some important gaps in the health workers' knowledge--for example, only 91 understood that dietary intake of polyunsaturated fatty acids as a proportion of total fat intake should be increased in a diet designed to reduce serum lipid concentrations. Appreciable gaps in their ability to give practical and appropriate dietary advice were also identified: 35 gave advice that would have led to the patient losing weight (although his history indicated that he was not overweight), and 27 gave only negative advice, offering no suggestions about substituting healthy foods for unhealthy ones. The demand for primary health care workers to give dietary advice is increasing and is likely to increase further if a national screening programme for hypercholesterolaemia is recommended. The results of this survey point to a need for improved nutritional education and training in dietary counselling for general practitioners, nurses, and primary care facilitators.\r"

The interview was piloted on 25 families and then administered in a semistandardised manner to a further 45 families. Parents were asked how satisfied they were with the initial discussion about the diagnosis: 23 families were satisfied with how much information they were given; 22 with the information concerning prognosis; 20 with the pacing of the information; 33 with who was present; 32 with arrangements for follow up; and 26 were satisfied overall with the initial discussion. Clear patterns emerged about which elements of the discussion parents appreciated or resented. For example, they valued an open, sympathetic, direct, and uninterrupted discussion of the diagnosis in private that allowed sufficient time for them to take the news in and for doctors to repeat and clarify information. They disliked evasive or unsympathetic brief interviews. All parents remembered vividly the manner in which the diagnosis was imparted, and some were still preoccupied with this many years later. Analyses were carried out to test the possibility that reports of satisfaction and dissatisfaction were a function of current depression and anxiety, but no evidence was found for this.\r"

SETTING--Multicentre study in 17 hospitals in West Yorkshire. PATIENTS--1238 Rh negative women who delivered Rh positive infants after 34 weeks in their first pregnancy in 1980-1 (group 1) and 2000 similar primigravidas from 1978-9 (group 2). Obstetric data were collected for 616 women in group 1 who had a subsequent pregnancy, 536 similar women in group 2, and 410 Rh positive but otherwise similar primigravidas who delivered in the same hospitals in 1978-81 (group C). INTERVENTIONS--Anti-D immunoglobulin 100 micrograms intramuscularly was given at 28 and 34 weeks to the mothers in their first pregnancy who delivered in 1980-1. END POINTS--Detection of anti-D antibody in the first or any subsequent pregnancy in groups 1 and 2. For all three groups having subsequent pregnancies gestation at delivery, birth weight, fetal survival at one month, pre-eclampsia defined as blood pressure greater than 140/90 on two occasions more than 12 hours apart, and proteinuria greater than 0.25 milligram. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS--Antenatal immunisation to Rh(D) occurred in six mothers in group 1 and 32 group 2. Most immunisations occurred in the first or second pregnancy. The rates of abortion, gestation at delivery, birth weight, and fetal survival were not significantly different among the three groups. The incidence of pre-eclampsia was lower in mothers given antenatal anti-D immunoglobulin, but the difference was not significant. CONCLUSIONS--Antenatal prophylaxis with anti-D immunoglobulin is effective, and the effect of giving it in the first pregnancy persists into at least the second pregnancy. It seems to be safe for the fetus in the index and subsequent pregnancies.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To examine the relation between damp and mould growth and symptomatic ill health. DESIGN--Cross-sectional study of random sample of households containing children; separate and independent assessments of housing conditions (by surveyor) and health (structured interview by trained researcher). SETTING--Subjects' homes (in selected areas of public housing in Glasgow, Edinburgh, and London). SUBJECTS--Adult respondents (94% women) and 1169 children living in 597 households. END POINTS--Specific health symptoms and general evaluation of health among respondents and children over two weeks before interview; and score on general health questionnaire (only respondents). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS--Damp was found in 184 (30.8%) dwellings and actual mould growth in 274 (45.9%). Adult respondents living in damp and mouldy dwellings were likely to report more symptoms overall, including nausea and vomiting, blocked nose, breathlessness, backache, fainting, and bad nerves, than respondents in dry dwellings. Children living in damp and mouldy dwellings had a greater prevalence of respiratory symptoms (wheeze, sore throat, runny nose) and headaches and fever compared with those living in dry dwellings. The mean number of symptoms was higher in damp and mouldy houses and positively associated with increasing severity of dampness and mould (dose response relation). All these differences persisted after controlling for possible confounding factors such as household income, cigarette smoking, unemployment, and overcrowding. Other possible sources of bias that might invalidate the assumption of a causal link between housing conditions and ill health--namely, investigator bias, respondent bias, and selection bias--were also considered and ruled out. CONCLUSION--Damp and mouldy living conditions have an adverse effect on symptomatic health, particularly among children.\r"

  ".U": "89336119\r", 
  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To examine the effects of volatile substance abuse on neuropsychological functioning. DESIGN--A sample of index children and matched controls were identified by a two stage procedure. Firstly, over 5000 secondary school pupils completed a screening questionnaire, and, secondly, a sample of those who acknowledged volatile substance abuse and a matched sample of those who denied the practice were assessed in detail by means of (a) individually conducted interviews and (b) toxicological examination of breath samples (to exclude those intoxicated at the time of testing). SETTING--16 Local education authority secondary schools in London. SUBJECTS--160 Pupils aged 13-16: 80 index children who had abused volatile substances to the point of intoxication at least once (confirmed by interview) and 80 controls (confirmed by interview) matched for school year, sex, and ethnic background. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS--Neuropsychological functioning tests provided 35 main outcome measures and were administered blind. Data on educational test performance before substance abuse began were obtained retrospectively. Information on potentially confounding social factors, such as number of siblings, tenure of housing, and parents' socioeconomic and employment state was also obtained. The index children performed significantly less well than the controls in tests of vocabulary, verbal intelligence quotient, full scale intelligence quotient, and a measure of impulsivity. When background social disadvantage was taken into account these differences were no longer significant. There were no significant associations between performance on psychological testing and frequency of abuse, and relations with other aspects of the children's history of abuse were generally weak or unsystematic. Comparisons between the results of these tests and of educational tests taken before substance abuse produced equivocal findings. CONCLUSION--Volatile substance abuse, as commonly practised by secondary school pupils, is unlikely to result in neuropsychological impairment.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To define the concentrations of inhibin in serum and tissue of patients with hydatidiform mole and assess their value as a clinical marker of the condition. DESIGN--Prospective study of new patients with hydatidiform mole, comparison of paired observations, and case-control analysis. SETTING--A university hospital, two large public hospitals, and a private women's clinic in Japan. PATIENTS--Seven consecutive referred patients seen over four months with newly diagnosed complete hydatidiform mole, including one in whom the mole was accompanied by viable twin fetuses (case excluded from statistical analysis because of unique clinical features). All patients followed up for six months after evacuation of molar tissue. END POINT--Correlation of serum inhibin concentrations with trophoblastic disease. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS--Serum concentrations of inhibin, human chorionic gonadotrophin, and follicle stimulating hormone were compared before and seven to 10 days after evacuation of the mole. Before evacuation the serum inhibin concentrations (median 8.3 U/ml; 95% confidence interval 2.4 to 34.5) were significantly greater than in 21 normal women at the same stage of pregnancy (2.8 U/ml; 2.1 to 3.6), and inhibin in molar tissue was also present in high concentrations (578 U/ml cytosol; 158 to 1162). Seven to 10 days after evacuation inhibin concentrations in serum samples from the same patients declined significantly to values (0.4 U/ml; 0.1 to 1.4) similar to those seen in the follicular phase of normal menstrual cycles. None of the four patients whose serum inhibin concentrations were 0.4 U/ml or less after evacuation developed persistent trophoblastic disease. Though serum human chorionic gonadotrophin concentrations declined after evacuation (6.6 x 10(3) IU/l; 0.8 x 10(3) to 32.6 x 10(3], they remained far higher than in non-pregnant women. Serum follicle stimulating hormone concentrations remained suppressed. CONCLUSIONS--In this small study serum inhibin concentrations higher than those found in the early follicular phase one to two weeks after evacuation of a hydatidiform mole seemed to be specific for persistent trophoblastic disease. Further data are needed to confirm these promising results.\r"

INTERVENTIONS--All patients received enalapril 10 mg daily, ramipril 10 mg daily, or placebo daily for one week in random order, with a washout period of at least one week between treatments. For assessment of sensitivity of the cough reflex the patients inhaled various concentrations of capsaicin solution in random order. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Measurement of the doses of capsaicin required to cause two or more and five or more coughs or the development of a symptomatic cough. RESULTS--Blood pressure, symptoms of cough, and the sensitivity of the cough reflex to inhaled capsaicin were recorded at the start of the study and before and at the end of each treatment period. Plasma urea and creatinine concentrations and angiotensin converting enzyme activity were measured at the start of the study and the end of each treatment period. Data were analysed by two way analysis of variance. Mean blood pressure was 159/97 mm Hg at the start of the study and 152/92, 143/88, and 147/86 mm Hg after treatment with placebo, enalapril, and ramipril respectively. Mean (SE) plasma angiotensin converting enzyme activity was 2.2 (0.2) mmol/l/h after treatment with placebo and fell significantly to 1.3 (0.1) mmol/l/h and to 0.4 (0.1) mmol/l/h after treatment with enalapril and ramipril respectively. No patient complained of cough while taking placebo but three women complained of cough when taking both enalapril and ramipril. The mean (95% confidence interval) lowest dose of capsaicin causing two or more coughs was 2.4 (1.5 to 4.0), 1.8 (1.12 to 2.82), and 2.2 (1.7 to 3.0) nmol after treatment with placebo, enalapril, and ramipril respectively; none of these changes were significant. The lowest dose of capsaicin causing five or more coughs was 18.9 (13.9 to 25.8), 14.4 (8.4 to 24.5), and 15.3 (10.8 to 21.2) nmol respectively; none of these changes were significant. The three patients who complained of cough had normal sensitivity to capsaicin after treatment with placebo but had a considerably increased sensitivity after treatment with enalapril and ramipril. CONCLUSIONS--Both enalapril and ramipril increase the sensitivity of the cough reflex appreciably in patients who complain of cough during treatment, but they do not change the se\r"

DESIGN--Independent clinical evaluation and histopathological assessment. SETTING--Pigmented lesion clinic, which patients attend without an appointment for early diagnosis of melanoma. PATIENTS--86 Patients with lesions that were judged to be benign by at least one of the three doctors. INTERVENTIONS--The lesions were excised under local anaesthesia and sent for histopathological examination in coded bottles without clinical details. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE--Comparison of clinical with histopathological diagnosis for each lesion. RESULTS--A total of 120 lesions were evaluated by at least two of the three doctors. The histopathological diagnoses were made by the same pathologist. The overall sensitivity (diagnostic accuracy) for the three doctors for all types of lesion was 50%. Of the 39 dysplastic naevi, only 19 were identified correctly by all observers, and a further 24 banal lesions were wrongly diagnosed as dysplastic by at least one doctor. Particular difficulty was experienced with small (less than 5 mm), flat lesions, which can be banal or potentially malignant. CONCLUSIONS--Critical diagnosis and management decisions concerning pigmented lesions should always be based on a combination of clinical and histopathological assessments and the history of the patient.\r"

A total of 260 replies were received from an estimated available population of 350 students (134 men and 126 women). The mean alcohol consumption obtained by a quantity-frequency measure was 20.5 units/week for male students and 14.6 units/week for female students. Retrospective diary reports showed mean (SE) consumptions of 18 (2) units/week for men (n = 134) and 11 (1) units/week for women (n = 126). Consumption among the men closely matched consumption among men matched for age in the general population. Women, however, drank more than women matched for age. Male and female medical students exceeded the suggested maximum for their sex in equal proportions. Quantity-frequency data showed that 31 (23%) men drank over 35 units/week and 28 (22%) women drank over 21 units/week. Of the 59 students exceeding these limits, 51 responded positively to a standard screening questionnaire for alcohol abuse. Forty students reported that they might have a drinking problem, and 138 reported that alcohol had affected their academic performance at some time; 17 of these were affected frequently. The students suggested sensible maximum consumption figures for health education. Smoking was associated with heavy drinking, especially among the women. These results suggest that some medical students are compromising their future health and their academic performance through excessive drinking.\r"

By specific amplification the possibility of analysing the DNA from single human oocytes for a specific gene was shown, and genotypes for markers closely linked to cystic fibrosis and Duchenne muscular dystrophy were determined. Single oocytes were used to approximate the total amount of DNA present in a single cell taken for biopsy from a 4-16 cell blastocyst. With a new technique for specific DNA amplification, the polymerase chain reaction, these data can be obtained within several hours of cell isolation. Extreme care must be taken to avoid any contamination of the sample with DNA from other sources. With this technique genotyping for single gene disorders is feasible with an accuracy and on a time scale that would allow implantation of the zygote after in vitro fertilisation without freezing.\r"

Data on prescribing costs were obtained from the Scottish Prescription Pricing Bureau for 1978-87. A microcomputer system was introduced into the practice in 1983 and used initially to issue repeat prescriptions, but from 1985 onwards a new system was added to issue all prescriptions; a personal computerised drug formulary was developed in 1983. Personal prescribing costs before and after computerisation were compared with those of the other partners and those of the Lothian Health Board and Scotland combined. The prescribing costs of the partners and Lothian Health Board and Scotland combined increased almost linearly in line with inflation from 1978 to 1987. Personal prescribing costs increased steadily until 1983, when repeat prescriptions were issued by computer, and remained static for a year. Thereafter they increased steadily until 1985, when all prescriptions were issued by computer, and then showed a steady and sustained fall. Personal prescribing costs were 21.5% lower than those of the partners in 1986 and 29.5% lower in 1987. Prescribing costs were reduced when a computer was used to issue all prescriptions in conjunction with a personal, computerised formulary.\r"

These developments, in addition to an increased understanding of large bowel carcinogenesis, have shifted the risk/benefit balance toward a more aggressive approach to colorectal polyps. Mounting evidence for the adenoma-carcinoma sequence supports the position that all colorectal polyps should be removed, recovered, and evaluated. Moreover, in most cases polypectomy can be achieved endoscopically. To justify surgery today, adenomas must be too large to be removed endoscopically, located in the distal rectum, or malignant with submucosal invasion or questionable margins.\r"

The established line grows in a single-cell suspension with a doubling time of 19 hours and expresses L3 morphologic features by the French-American-British classification. Immunologic study revealed that WSU-BL cells express IgM-lambda both in the cytoplasm and on the surface and react with monoclonal antibodies to B-cell antigens (B1, B4, BL3, BL4, HLA-DR, and common acute lymphoblastic leukemia antigen [CALLA]). These cells are negative for T-cell and myeloid/monocyte antigens as well as Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen (EBNA). These results suggest that WSU-BL corresponds to an intermediate stage of B-cell differentiation. Both fresh tumor and WSU-BL cells had a hyperdiploid karyotype carrying the 8;14 chromosome translocation. Molecular studies showed that WSU-BL has a rearrangement of c-myc proto-oncogene and expresses c-myc RNA. Phorbol ester 12-0-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) were able to induce several phenotypic changes on WSU-BL cells. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of total cellular protein showed that either TPA or IFN-gamma induced both the synthesis or loss of several proteins. Analysis of the protein patterns indicated that some proteins were uniquely responsive to either TPA or IFN-gamma and others were common to both. This cell line should be valuable for future studies of cell proliferation, differentiation, and oncogenesis concerning this neoplasm.\r"

HCC-T exhibited a typical morphology of epithelial cells in culture. Population doubling time was 24 hours and HCC-T cells had characteristics of malignant cells demonstrated by the ability to grow in a soft agar medium and transplantability to nude mice. The histologic condition of the tumor transplanted to a nude mouse showed similarity to the original tumor. A chromosome analysis showed that there were ten identifiable marker chromosomes and sex chromosomes with its modal number of 64. Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) production was demonstrated by direct immunofluorescence study, but albumin or hepatitis B surface antigen were not detectable. The integration of hepatitis B viral DNA was not demonstrable in the genome of HCC-T cells or the original hepatoma.\r"

A bain anaesthetic breathing circuit was used with a fresh gas flow (VFG) of 110 ml.min-1.kg-1, and controlled ventilation was applied with a minute ventilation (VE) of 175 ml.min-1.kg-1. Arterial blood gases were analysed at the end of the operation. Nineteen of the women (86 per cent) were found to have a PaCO2 within the range for normocapnia (i.e., 4.7-5.9 kPa (35-45 mmHg), two were hypocapnic with a PaCO2 of 4.4 and 4.5 kPa (33 and 34 mmHg) respectively and one was found to have a PaCO2 of 6.2 kPa (46.5 mmHg). It was concluded that the carbon dioxide absorbed from the abdomen during laparoscopy demands fresh gas flows that are higher than normally used in the Bain circuit if a PaCO2 within the normal range is to be obtained. A simultaneous increase in VFG and VE of about 45 per cent is sufficient to achieve normocapnia.\r"

Including the current system of postexposure prophylaxis and an annual attack rate of 1 percent the current annual cost of HBV infection in The Children's Mercy Hospital is $12,630. The HBV immunization program would have to continue for 15 years before its cumulative costs ($189,133) were exceeded by those of the current system ($189,450). Therefore routine immunization of nurses would not be cost effective in the near future. If, however, a subset of high-risk employees with a 2 percent attack rate is identified, or the cost of the HBV vaccine series fell from the current $103 to $27, then routine immunization would become cost beneficial within 6 years.\r"

Highly comparable pharmacokinetic parameters were obtained after analysis of rt-PA as both an antigen and an activity. Mean clearance (antigen) was 620 +/- 70 (SD) ml/min, volume of distribution at steady state was 8.1 +/- 0.8 L, initial volume of distribution was 4.4 +/- 0.6 L, and dominant half-life was 4.4 +/- 0.3 minutes. The pharmacokinetics of rt-PA were linear, showed low interindividual variation, and are compatible with rapid hepatic elimination of the protein. Systemic plasminogen activation was minimal as assessed by hemostatic assays of plasma samples treated with anti-rt-PA Immunoglobulin G (IgG) to inhibit in vitro fibrinogenolysis. Circulating fibrinogen levels, clotting times, and coagulation factors were unchanged; plasminogen and alpha 2-antiplasmin decreased maximally to 85% and 65% of baseline values, respectively. The data are consistent with the fibrin specificity of t-PA, which is derived from its role in physiologic fibrinolysis.\r"

The effect of fenbufen (gamma-oxo-[1,1'-biphenyl]-4-butanoic acid), a known cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor, on the changes in muscle and liver protein metabolism in response to Escherichia coli endotoxin has been investigated in the rat. 2. Young male rats were fed a purified diet [18% (w/w) casein], with or without fenbufen (1.2 g/kg of diet). Groups of animals were injected with either endotoxin (LPS; Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide 0.127 B8; 3 mg/kg body weight) or saline. Rectal temperature and food intake were measured over the following 24 h period, after which time measurements were made of muscle and liver protein content and synthesis in vivo, muscle protein degradation as the difference between protein synthesis and growth rates, muscle glutamine concentration and plasma insulin. 3. Fenbufen treatment alone tended to lower rectal temperature. It also reduced plasma insulin, slightly reduced food intake and slowed growth and muscle protein turnover, although muscle glutamine concentrations were unchanged. The slower protein synthesis mainly reflected reduced translational activity, which was consistent with the reduced insulin concentration. 4. LPS treatment increased rectal temperature by 1.6 degrees C, and this was abolished by fenbufen, indicating that the dose of the drug was sufficient to block prostaglandin production in the hypothalamus. 5. LPS treatment induced similar losses in body weight and muscle protein in both control and fenbufen groups, despite a 50% lower food intake in the LPS plus fenbufen group compared with the LPS-only group. The loss of muscle protein in both groups reflected reduced protein synthesis and increased protein degradation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The purpose of this study was to determine whether the baroreceptor reflex system affects the secretion of atrial natriuretic factor directly or indirectly during acute volume expansion. 2. Lactated Ringer's solution containing low mol. wt. dextran was infused at 20 ml/kg for 1 h into dogs in which baroreceptors had been denervated surgically (Vx), dogs in which the autonomic system had been blocked with hexamethonium (Hx) and control dogs. 3. The plasma noradrenaline level was significantly higher in the Vx group and lower in the Hx group than in the control group throughout the experiment. The plasma levels of arginine vasopressin in the Vx and Hx groups were significantly higher than in the control group. 4. The plasma atrial natriuretic factor levels in the three groups showed similar increases during and after volume expansion. 5. The plasma atrial natriuretic factor level was significantly correlated with the right atrial pressure during volume expansion. 6. From these results, it seems unlikely that changes in the plasma level of atrial natriuretic factor during volume expansion are regulated by the baroreceptor reflex directly or indirectly by systemic changes in the sympathetic nervous system or arginine vasopressin secretion.\r"

  ".W": "1. We studied the effect of a low-dose infusion of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) on renal blood flow in healthy volunteers. We additionally investigated the effect of ANP on renal haemodynamic function and on urinary sodium excretion. 2. ANP induced a rise in packed cell volume and a slight increase (but no decrease) in the renal extraction of hippuran. These changes did not offset the observed fall in effective renal plasma flow. Renal blood flow thus truly decreased and renal vascular resistance increased. 3. ANP induced an increase in glomerular filtration rate and a decrease in urinary osmolality in the first hour of ANP infusion, whereas absolute and fractional sodium excretion increased significantly only in the second hour of ANP infusion. The decrease in urinary osmolality in the first hour of ANP infusion correlated with the induced natriuresis. The changes in urinary osmolality and sodium excretion both correlated with the changes in plasma ANP levels. 4. These data indicate that ANP may cause a decrease in renal blood flow and an increase of renal vascular resistance in man. Our results suggest a role for ANP-induced (intra)renal haemodynamic changes in ANP-induced natriuresis, possibly through an increase in the filtered load of sodium into a washed-out medullary interstitium.\r"

Of the 640 who underwent further medical evaluation, 299 participants (46.7 percent) who had adequate follow-up had no evidence of disease. Diverse disease entities were detected in 341 participants, which was 1.4 percent of those enrolled. Forty-one patients (0.17 percent) showed significant findings that included 29 cancers (0.12 percent) and 12 (0.05 percent) noninvasive malignant polyps. Of the cancers, there were 27 colorectal, one non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and one carcinoma of the vocal cord. In addition, 107 patients (0.45 percent) had benign polyps and 193 patients (0.82 percent) had various diseases of the gastrointestinal tract and other medical conditions. The cost of the program was modest and the results conformed to those found in previous screening surveys. The heightened public awareness of testing for colorectal disease and the detection of early lesions justifies the guaiac test screening program for mass survey.\r"

All patients were reexamined after a period of one to 2 months, under light general anesthesia, and any residual tumor or scar tissue was biopsied. Control biopsy was positive in eight patients. Three of six patients who had abdominoperineal excision died from locoregional recurrence; the remaining are alive and cancer free after 1 to 4 years. Two patients had local excision; one is alive and the other died of other cancer metastasis four years later. Seventeen patients who had negative biopsies are alive and free of disease after 1 to 5 years; two died of unrelated causes, two died with distant metastasis (present prior to treatment), and one died with locoregional recurrence. Locoregional failures occurred in four patients (13.3 percent) in the entire series. Individualization of each patient, adjustment of doses, and carefully executed radiation and chemotherapy are the most important points for the success of treatment.\r"

During exercise, plasma ANF concentrations rose threefold (P less than .001), and this increase was similar in the three groups. However, heart-rate response to exercise was impaired in the two groups of diabetic patients (P less than .004 vs. healthy subjects) but was more severely impaired in patients with CAN (P less than .03 vs. patients without CAN). In healthy subjects and patients without CAN, the increases of ANF during exercise correlated significantly with those of heart rate, systolic blood pressure, and rate-pressure product (P less than .01). In patients with CAN, the correlation was found exclusively with heart rate (P less than .01). An increase of ventricular ejection fraction occurred in all groups (P less than .001) but without showing statistical differences between groups. After 30 min of standing, a similar postural drop of plasma ANF concentrations (P less than .002) was observed in all subjects, reflecting preserved sympathetic control of vessels. In conclusion, exercise induces an increase of plasma ANF in diabetic patients with CAN. This increase, occurring similarly to healthy subjects, indicates that autonomic activation plays a minor role in ANF release during exercise. Impaired heart-rate response to exercise in patients without CAN suggests early damage of autonomic function, undetected by conventional rest tests.\r"

  ".W": "It has been reported that not all Sertoli cells store the same product or respond morphologically to secretagogue stimulation. The following studies were performed to determine whether functional differences among these cells are also present with respect to the secretion of a product. Sertoli cells obtained from 18- to 20-day-old rats were cultured for 3 days and then subjected to reverse hemolytic plaque assays for transferrin (TF). Release of TF could be detected from only 62.7 +/- 0.47% (mean +/- SE; n = 4 experiments) of all cells in culture. Results obtained from immunocytochemical staining of different batches of cells from the same dispersions agreed quite closely with these plaque assay values, indicating that not all Sertoli cells in culture contain or secrete TF. Differences in the basal rate of TF release were observed among these secretors, as evidenced by a gradual appearance of plaques over an 8-h period. Addition of FSH, cAMP, or isoproterenol to the assay incubation mixture resulted in an acceleration in the rate of plaque formation. Although approximately twice as many secretors could be identified after 0.5 and 1 h of incubation in the presence of these agents than in their absence, it still required at least 4 h for the remainder of the TF cells to form plaques. This would indicate that only a portion of all TF secretors respond acutely to these modulators. Thus, our observations that not all Sertoli cells secrete TF, and those that do release this substance respond differently to at least three stimulatory agents demonstrate clearly that Sertoli cells are heterogeneous with respect to TF release. Moreover, these findings raise the possibility that differences in the functional capacity of individual cells may be an important factor contributing to the modulation of Sertoli cell secretion.\r"

In our experiments, protein kinase-C activators increased PRL release and arachidonate liberation from anterior pituitary cells and from the PRL-secreting cell line MMQ. In cells depleted of pituitary protein kinase-Cs by chronic exposure to protein kinase-C activators, such as phorbol dibutyrate or 4 beta-phorbol 12 beta-myristate 13 alpha-acetate, TRH, angiotensin-II, and neurotensin each increased PRL release and [3H]arachidonate liberation in a normal manner. In addition, the PRL-releasing activities of protein kinase-C activators and those of TRH appeared to be synergistic, an unexpected effect if these substances were functioning through the same intracellular pathways. It, therefore, appears that phorbol diester-sensitive protein kinase-Cs may not be involved in the increased secretion of PRL or liberation of arachidonate that is caused by TRH, angiotensin-II, or neurotensin.\r"

This heterologous desensitization is rapidly reversible upon removal of hormone from the culture medium. This decrease in NaF-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity agrees well with the decrease in Gs activity, as assessed by reconstitution of the cyc- S49 cell adenylyl cyclase. Recovery from heterologous desensitization within 30 min results in restoration of Gs activity to control levels. No changes in Gs-alpha protein levels could be determined by immunoblotting using an alpha s-specific antiserum during heterologous desensitization. Similarly, no change in the beta gamma-subunits or Gi-alpha-subunits were detected by immunoblotting analysis using subunit-specific antisera. Pretreatment of cells with pertussis toxin did not block the onset of either heterologous or homologous desensitization, indicating the lack of involvement of Gi in glucagon-induced desensitization. cAMP-dependent phosphorylation of G-proteins does not account for heterologous desensitization, since none of the G-protein subunits appears to be phosphorylated even in vitro. However, Gs as the locus of change in heterologous desensitization was confirmed by the observation that addition of purified Gs to desensitized cell membranes results in enhancement of NaF-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity. From these data we conclude that postreceptor heterologous desensitization in chick hepatocytes results from a reversible decrease in Gs activity in the cell surface membrane.\r"

  ".W": "The biochemical mechanisms underlying the direct stimulatory action of dopamine (DA) withdrawal on PRL release and on the potentiation of TRH stimulation are not known. These actions can be mimicked by pretreatment of lactotrophs with the protein kinase-C (PKC) activator 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate. Previous studies have shown that administration of TRH or withdrawal of DA stimulates polyphosphoinositide breakdown, although to different degrees. We have tested whether the acute withdrawal of DA activates PKC and determined if the prior removal of DA modifies the activation of PKC by TRH. Primary cultures of dispersed anterior pituitaries from estradiol-treated rats consisting of approximately 80% lactotrophs were maintained overnight in 500 nM DA. Activation of PKC was assayed immunochemically as translocation of PKC to a membrane fraction and by in situ phosphorylation of an acid-soluble heat-stable 80K substrate. Acute withdrawal of DA induced translocation of immunoreactive PKC to the membrane fraction (25-250%) and enhanced phosphorylation (40-100%) of an 80K protein. These effects were detected within 5-15 sec of DA withdrawal and were prolonged (10-30 min). TRH induced a rapid and transient activation of both parameters. The duration and magnitude of the action of TRH were increased by prior removal of DA. These results are consistent with a role for PKC activation in transduction of the stimulation of PRL release by the withdrawal of DA. The longer lasting activation of PKC may explain at least in part the potentiation of the PRL-releasing action of TRH by the withdrawal of DA.\r"

  ".W": "Dopamine reduces the stimulation of intracellular [3H]arachidonate release produced by the two PRL-stimulating peptides angiotensin-II and TRH. This effect is concentration dependent and is mediated by stimulation of D-2 dopamine receptors. D-2 receptor agonists (bromocriptine, dihydroergocryptine, and dihydroergocristine) inhibit the release of fatty acid induced by angiotensin-II with a potency that parallels their ability to inhibit PRL release in vitro. Conversely, the selective D-2 receptor antagonist L-sulpiride completely prevents dopamine's effect, whereas SCH 23390 (a D-1 receptor antagonist) is ineffective. The inhibitory action of dopamine does not seem to be consequent to an action on the adenylate cyclase-cAMP system, as 8-bromo-cAMP (1 mM) does not affect either basal or dopamine-inhibited [3H]arachidonate release. However, a 24-h pertussis toxin pretreatment significantly reduces the action of dopamine on fatty acid release. Collectively, these results suggest that D-2 dopamine receptor-mediated inhibition of intracellular [3H]arachidonate release requires the action of a GTP-binding protein, but is not a consequence of an inhibitory action on cAMP levels.\r"

However, different potencies have been observed for the two peptides in some biological assays, suggesting that cAMP-independent second messenger pathways might be involved in PTHrP signal transduction. This hypothesis was tested in the osteogenic sarcoma cell line UMR 106-01. Addition of PTHrP-(1-34) to cell suspensions loaded with the Ca2+ indicator indo-1 produced a transient dose-dependent increase in intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i), with a maximal effect at 2 x 10(-7) M and an ED0.5 at about 4 x 10(-8) M. The amplitude and duration of the transients were similar to those induced by equimolar concentrations of bovine PTH-(1-34) (bPTH), and the dose-responses of the two peptides completely overlapped. Both full-length peptides, PTHrP-(1-141) and bPTH-(1-84), produced effects identical to those observed with the 1-34 fragments. Homologous and heterologous desensitization to both PTHrP-(1-34) and PTHrP-(1-141) occurred when the cells were prestimulated with equimolar or 10-fold lower doses of either PTHrP-(1-34) or bPTH-(1-34). Desensitization to bPTH-(1-34) was also observed when cells were prestimulated with PTHrP-(1-34). Furthermore, pretreatment with either bPTH-(3-34) or [Nle8,18, Tyr34]bPTH-(3-34) amide did not affect [Ca2+]i, but reduced the response to PTHrP-(1-34) by 55 +/- 10% (n = 3) and 67 +/- 8% (n = 3), respectively. The PTHrP-(1-34)-induced [Ca2+]i transient was not substantially affected by either extracellular Ca2+ chelation by EGTA or pretreatment with diltiazem, and nitrendipine only partially inhibited the [Ca2+]i response to PTHrP-(1-34) by about 10%. These results indicate that in osteoblastic cells PTHrP mobilizes Ca2+ from an intracellular storage pool with potency equal to that of PTH, and that the two hormones interact with the same receptor.\r"

  ".W": "Mouse clonal ACTH-secreting corticotrophs (AtT-20 cells) possess a membrane Ca2+-activated Cl- conductance which is partially blocked by the disulfonic stilbene derivative 4-acetamido-4'-isothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid (SITS). In the current study the effect of SITS on the ACTH secretory process was evaluated. SITS markedly blocked basal and forskolin-stimulated ACTH secretion from AtT-20 cells (IC50 = 2.7 x 10(-4) M). Both CRF-induced ACTH secretion and forskolin-stimulated GH secretion from acutely dispersed rat anterior pituitary cells were inhibited by SITS (IC50 = 2.4 and 1.3 x 10(-4) M, respectively). SITS did not alter unstimulated or forskolin-elicited cAMP synthesis in AtT-20 cells, and in fact, could inhibit ACTH secretion in response to cAMP-independent agonists such as the calcium channel activator BAY-K-8644 or the protein kinase-C activator 12-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (IC50 = 2.6 and 2.4 x 10(-4) M, respectively). SITS did not alter the secretion of amylase from isolated exocrine pancreatic acinar cells. Its action was also fully reversible; after its removal from the incubation medium, cells secreted ACTH without a change in response to forskolin activation. Increasing extracellular Ca2+ or the addition of up to 10(-3) M tetraethylammonium or 4-aminopyridine did not reverse the inhibitory pattern of SITS action, suggesting that its inhibitory effect is most likely not due to hyperpolarization of AtT-20 cell membranes. The inability of amiloride to inhibit ACTH secretion further suggests that inhibition of ACTH secretion provoked by SITS is not due to a blockade of Cl-/HCO3- exchange. On the other hand, SITS was able to block 44% of basal 36Cl uptake by AtT-20 cells. Exchange of incubation medium chloride for gluconate or a reduction in the osmotic strength of the medium reduced both basal and secretagogue-stimulated ACTH secretion. The data suggest that SITS may modulate chloride-dependent, osmotically driven secretion from AtT-20 cells.\r"

  ".W": "A functioning rat thyroid cell line (FRTL5) was used to study interactions of TSH with interferon-gamma (IFN gamma) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF alpha). We examined effects on growth and differentiated function. Growth was assessed by DNA, incorporation of [3H]thymidine ([3H]Tdr) into DNA, and cell number; uptake of 125I (I- uptake) and the concentration of cAMP were measured simultaneously with growth assessment. IFN gamma stimulated the 30-min I- uptake and enhanced the effect of TSH. TNF alpha had minimal effects on growth indices (slight increase in [3H]Tdr incorporation) and had no influence on I- uptake; it inhibited TSH stimulation of both growth and I- uptake. When combined, IFN gamma and TNF alpha synergized in inhibiting TSH-stimulated growth. By itself TNF alpha inhibited stimulation of I- uptake by TSH, but augmented the enhancement seen with IFN gamma. The influence of calf serum (CS) was to increase the rate of incorporation of [3H]Tdr, but a similar qualitative pattern for the actions of the cytokines remained. A reverse profile (stimulation by IFN gamma, inhibition by TNF alpha, and stimulation by the combination) was seen for I- uptake, with CS increasingly diminishing all values. TSH stimulation of growth was progressively effective with increments of CS in the medium, but consistently there was inhibition that was greater with IFN gamma than with TNF alpha and was almost total with the combined cytokines. Stimulation of I- uptake by TSH was enhanced by IFN gamma, reduced by TNF alpha, and, when serum was present, increased to a degree that was greater than additive by the combined cytokines. Growth stimulation by insulin or insulin-like growth factor-I was inhibited partially by the individual cytokines and completely by the combination. Both insulin and insulin-like growth factor-I inhibited TSH stimulation of I- uptake, but similar stimulation by the cytokines was not affected. Simultaneous with inhibition of TSH-stimulated growth, both IFN gamma and TNF alpha enhanced cAMP accumulation. The mechanism of these multiple effects of IFN gamma and TNF alpha, especially on the actions of TSH, may not currently be fully explained, but they almost certainly reflect differing modes of action. The relevance to thyroid function in man is conjectural. Especially in Graves' disease, where thyroid infiltration with cells that secrete these cytokines is common, it seems probable that both IFN gamma and TNF alpha will have significant influences on both growth and differentiated cell function.\r"

  ".W": "Since the role of GnRH in the control of FSH release and synthesis is controversial, we have examined the effect of elimination of GnRH action on gonadotropes on FSH beta gene expression, FSH release, and synthesis. GnRH stimulation of the pituitary was abolished by continuous infusion of either a GnRH antagonist or a GnRH antiserum. We also examined the effects of gonadotrope desensitization, using a continuous infusion of GnRH or GnRH agonist analog. FSH beta mRNA levels were determined by dot blot hybridization using rat FSH beta cDNA, and changes were related to pituitary and serum FSH concentrations. FSH beta mRNA levels increased after orchidectomy and correlated well with serum FSH concentrations. Overall FSH synthesis was increased after castration, as judged by elevated serum FSH and unchanged pituitary FSH content. In orchidectomized rats, continuous GnRH antagonist infusion prevented the postcastration rise in FSH beta mRNA levels and serum FSH. Pituitary FSH content was reduced at 7 days, but not at 14 days. In intact rats, GnRH antagonist infusion for 7 days had no effect on FSH beta mRNA levels, but after 14 days, there was a 33% reduction, and serum FSH was suppressed. Pituitary FSH content was decreased after GnRH antagonist treatment for 7 or 14 days. Daily injection of GnRH antiserum for 6 days abolished the increases in FSH beta mRNA levels and serum FSH in orchidectomized rats, but pituitary FSH content was unaffected. In intact rats, GnRH antiserum treatment reduced FSH beta mRNA levels by 38%, suppressed serum FSH, and decreased pituitary FSH content. When gonadotropes were desensitized by a continuous infusion of GnRH for 14 days or GnRH agonist analog for 28 days, FSH beta mRNA levels and pituitary FSH content were markedly reduced, and serum FSH was suppressed to undetectable levels. We concluded that 1) endogenous GnRH is required for the maintenance of FSH beta mRNA levels in both intact and orchidectomized rats; 2) FSH beta mRNA levels are coupled to the level of FSH biosynthesis, indicating the physiological importance of this pretranslational regulation; 3) desensitization is more effective at inhibiting FSH beta gene expression and FSH synthesis than preventing gonadotrope stimulation using the GnRH antagonist or antiserum; and 4) the actions of GnRH on FSH beta mRNA levels are paralleled by its effects on LH beta mRNA levels, suggesting that GnRH provides a common primary stimulus for the induction of both beta-subunit genes in vivo. These data provide further evidence for the crucial stimulatory role of GnRH in the control of FSH synthesis.\r"

  ".W": "The present experiments investigated the time course of maternal modulation of GH secretion and examined the possible role of milk in the regulation of GH secretion in neonatal rats. Serum GH concentrations in neonatal rats were high at birth and declined over time postpartum. Separation of rat pups from their mothers decreased, while a subsequent period of suckling increased, serum GH levels in rat pups on postpartum days 1-14, but not on day 20. The water-soluble fraction (infranatant) of rat milk contained immunoreactive (ir) rat GH-releasing hormone (rGHRH)-like material (725.06 +/- 81.29 pg/ml), ir-somatostatin-like activity (1.64 +/- 0.2 ng/ml), and irGH (4.79 +/- 0.73 ng/ml). The concentrations of these hormones tended to decrease with time postpartum and were positively correlated with each other (r = 0.70; P less than or equal to 0.0001). IrPRL was also present in the infranatant (148.44 +/- 14.55 ng/ml), but levels were not correlated with the other hormones detected. Milk infranatant stimulated GH secretion from perifused neonatal rat pituitary glands in vitro. Milk infranatant also stimulated GH secretion in vivo when administered sc or intragastrically to 2- or 8-day-old rat pups. The GH-releasing effect was not due to gastric distension or nonspecific nutritive components, as neither 0.9% saline nor nutrients (5% glucose and 10% BSA) increased serum GH levels. The presence of high concentrations of irGHRH in rat milk infranatant and the strong correlation between the irGHRH concentrations of milk samples and the in vitro GH response (r = 0.71; P less than or equal to 0.005) suggested that this peptide is a major candidate for producing the in vitro and in vivo GH-stimulating activity in rat milk. However, the minimally effective concentration of synthetic rGHRH required to stimulate GH release in the superfusion system was between 1-10 nM, which exceeds milk irGHRH levels by 100- to 1000-fold. Moreover, in vivo administration of synthetic rGHRH (sc or intragastrically) was unable to increase serum GH concentrations in 2-day-old pups, although a large dose (100 ng/g) of human GHRH sc was effective. These findings indicate that rat milk may be an important maternal factor that modulates GH secretion and, consequently, growth during the neonatal period. Rat milk has GH-releasing activity both in vivo and in vitro in neonatal rats, but the GH-releasing activities of milk are probably only minimally due to its rGHRH content.\r"

  ".U": "89338246\r", 
  ".W": "It is well established that in the pituitary gland corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) stimulates the release of beta-endorphin (beta-E) via a cAMP-linked mechanism. Studies of the mechanisms underlying the CRH stimulation of beta-E release from rat hypothalamic slices perifused in vitro are reported in this paper. The data indicate that both a cAMP-dependent and non-cAMP-dependent mechanism mediate the action of CRH in the hypothalamus. The presence of a cAMP-linked mechanism was suggested by the finding that cholera toxin (0.1-10 nM) and forskolin (2.5 x 10(-6) M), both of which act to raise intracellular cAMP levels, stimulated the release of beta-E. In both cases, no further stimulation was seen upon addition of CRH (10(-8)M). However, it was also found that preincubation of the tissue with pertussis toxin (PTX; 100 ng/ml) prevented both the CRH- and forskolin-stimulated release of beta-E. This indicated that, in addition to the cAMP-linked mechanism, a further messenger system which is connected to a PTX-sensitive G-protein may also play a role. The latter observation also implied that a further substance, which utilizes a separate second messenger system, might be involved in the CRH stimulation of beta-E release. In this regard the role of arginine vasopressin (AVP) was investigated due to the known interaction between CRH and AVP in the pituitary gland. AVP (10(-12) to 10(-6)M) itself potently and dose-dependently stimulated beta-E release, producing a maximal increase of 220% above basal levels. The AVP-induced release of beta-E was abolished in PTX-pretreated hypothalami. The apparently obligatory requirement of AVP for the CRH-stimulation of beta-E release was illustrated by the finding that blockade of AVP receptors using the AVP antagonist d(CH2)5 [Tyr(OEt)2,Val4]-AVP almost completely attenuated the CRH-stimulated release of beta-E. Furthermore, in the presence of a high concentration of AVP (10(-6)M) no further stimulation of release was seen with CRH (10(-8)M). These data therefore strongly indicate that CRH acts via the intermediacy of AVP to release beta-E from hypothalamic slices in vitro and that two separate second messenger systems are involved: a cAMP-linked mechanism connected to a cholera toxin-sensitive G-protein (CRH) and a second system linked to a PTX-sensitive G-protein (AVP).\r"

  ".W": "Three experiments were conducted with growing pigs actively immunized against a protein-conjugated somatostatin (SRIF) in Freund's adjuvant. In the first experiment, blood from 24-week-old pigs (seven immunized and eight control) was sampled at 20-min intervals for 6 h to evaluate basal GH concentrations. The animals were then injected iv with porcine GH-releasing factor (GRF)-(1-29)NH2 (10 micrograms/kg). Before GRF stimulation, immunized animals had higher (P less than 0.05) baseline mean GH levels (2.6 vs. 1.4 ng/ml) and area under the GH curve (AUC; 1632 vs. 779 ng/min.ml); they also had higher AUC after GRF administration (4268 vs. 1972 ng/min.ml). In a second experiment eight immunized and eight control pigs were injected iv four times at 90-min intervals with porcine GRF (10 micrograms/kg). Control pigs responding to the first injection did not respond to the second and third, and those responding to the second did not respond to the first, third, and fourth, indicating a decreased responsiveness that was longer than 3 h post-GRF response in control pigs. SRIF-immunized pigs had a more consistent GH response to the GRF injections. Overall, a reduced response was observed after the second and the fourth injections in immunized pigs, although five and six of eight animals had a GH peak response higher than 10 ng/ml during these periods. In a third experiment, effects of fasting, GRF, and SRIF immunization were studied. Immunization and fasting had their own positive effects on serum GH levels. Immunization increased baseline mean GH levels (5.0 vs. 2.2 ng/ml) and total AUC before (2318 vs. 1073 ng/min.ml) and after (1886 vs. 910 ng/min.ml) iv GRF stimulation (10 micrograms/kg) compared to controls. Fasting increased the mean baseline GH level (4.5 vs. 2.6 ng/ml), and it increased AUC before exogenous GRF stimulation (2009 vs. 1392 ng/min.ml). In conclusion, SRIF in pigs seems to be a potent GH-governing factor, since, when inhibited, baseline mean GH levels increase, and a consistent response to GRF is observed. Fasting could increase GH concentrations by different ways: decreasing SRIF release and increasing GRF release or modifying the sensitivity of the somatotrophs to both factors.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of the obligatory precursor of prostaglandin biosynthesis, arachidonic acid, on the release of relaxin by porcine luteal cells was examined by use of a reverse hemolytic plaque assay. In this assay, luteal cells were cocultured in monolayers with protein-A-coupled ovine erythrocytes. In the presence of porcine relaxin antiserum and complement, a zone of hemolysis, a plaque, developed around relaxin-releasing luteal cells, identified as large luteal cells (LLCs). The rate of development of plaques in time-course studies and the area of plaques were then used as an index of the rate of relaxin release and cumulative amount of hormone released, respectively. Incubation of collagenase-dispersed luteal cells derived from early pregnant pigs with 0.1-100 microM arachidonic acid (AA) resulted in dose-dependent increases in the rate of plaque formation. Despite AA stimulation, however, only 55-65% of all LLCs formed plaques during the experimental incubation period (up to 12 h). Minimally and maximally effective doses were about 1 and 10 microM, respectively. In the presence of 10 microM AA, maximal plaque formation occurred significantly faster (1-2 h) than in controls (4-8 h; P less than 0.05). The percentage of plaque-forming cells (plaque-forming LLCs) was, likewise, significantly greater in 10 microM AA-treated monolayers than in controls during the first 3-4 h of incubation. Similarly, agents that liberate endogenous AA (phospholipase A2 and melittin) also stimulated relaxin release. The stimulatory effect of AA (10 microM) on relaxin release was almost wholly blocked by a cyclooxygenase inhibitor (ibuprofen; 20 microM); but not by a lipooxygenase inhibitor (nordihydroguaretic acid; 20 microM). However, the same dose of ibuprofen (20 microM) failed to modulate the stimulatory effect of prostaglandin E2 (1 microM) or phorbol diester (4 beta-phorbol 12 beta-myristate 13 alpha-acetate; 50 nM) on the rate of relaxin release. These results indicate that a product(s) of the cyclooxygenase pathway of AA metabolism participates in the control of relaxin release, but that this metabolite(s) is not essential to the biological action of at least one stimulatory secretagogue. Moreover, this metabolite failed to influence a subpopulation of nonresponsive LLCs. These data taken in association with our previous demonstration that the pathways of both calcium mobilization and protein kinase-C activation are implicated in the regulation of relaxin release, are consistent with the view that AA liberation may amplify the actions of other signalling mechanisms.\r"

Cells of the human hepatoma line were labeled by [35S]methionine in presence of or absence of tunicamycin (TM). Media or cells were harvested at 0, 3, 6, and 20 h after the addition of excess unlabeled methionine. Media and cell lysates were incubated with anti-CBG serum and immune complexes were precipitated with Staphylococcus aureus protein A (Pansorbin). Immunoprecipitates were analyzed by fluorography after sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Immunoprecipitation of T4-binding globulin (TBG) was also carried out with anti-TBG serum. Fluorographic analysis revealed three forms of CBG: CBG1, a glycosylated, mature, and secretory form with apparent mol wt of 70 K; CBG2, a glycosylated precursor which due to incomplete carbohydrate processing has an apparent mol wt of 54 K; and CBG3, a nonglycosylated form consisting of the 40 K core protein. In absence of TM, CBG1 was observed in media and CBG2 was detected in cell lysates. The proportion of CBG1 increased during the chase, whereas that of CBG2 decreased, indicating that CBG was secreted after processing of the oligosaccharides on CBG2. In presence of TM, CBG3 was found both in media and cell lysates. The sum of CBG3 in the medium and the cell lysate decreased during the chase, whereas that of CBG1 and CBG2 remained unchanged. Similar to CBG, TBG1 (mature form, 60 K) and TBG2 (partially processed glycosylated form, 54 K) were observed in media and cell lysates, respectively, in absence of TM. However, TBG3 (nonglycosylated, 44 K) was not detected in medium. These results indicate that glycosylation is not a key factor for the secretion of CBG but is important for its stability. On the other hand the glycosylation is indispensable for the secretion of TBG.\r"

In this study, pituitary GH mRNA and peripheral serum GH levels were measured in ewes representing the major phases of the estrous cycle. There was a significant rise (P less than 0.05) in both GH mRNA and serum GH concentrations during the follicular phase of the cycle, occurring near the peak of the LH/FSH surge. Subsequently, these parameters were also measured in untreated and estradiol-treated anestrous ewes. This estradiol treatment is known to elicit a characteristic gonadotropin surge within 24 h after insertion of the estradiol implants. The estradiol-treated ewes demonstrated a serum GH surge (P less than 0.05) approximately 22 h after implantation with estradiol. However, no change was observed in GH mRNA amounts in response to the treatment, suggesting, perhaps, a different mechanism for the GH surge in these ewes vs. the surge during the normal estrous cycle. Additionally, these results are consistent with the hypothesis that the effects of GH on ovarian follicular development and maturation, previously shown in rats and humans, may also be present in the sheep. Furthermore, this may represent part of an endocrine feedback system that involves metabolic effects on reproduction.\r"

  ".W": "Rat TRH prohormone (pro-TRH) contains five separate copies of the TRH progenitor sequence, Gln-His-Pro-Gly. All five sequences are flanked by paired basic amino acid cleavage sites and linked together by connecting sequences. RIAs to synthetic TRH and prepro-TRH-(178-199) were used to investigate pro-TRH processing in the endocrine pancreas of adult rats. HPLC analysis of adult rat pancreatic extracts showed the presence of a major immunoreactive peptide eluting at the position of prepro-TRH-(178-199). An additional peak coeluting with [less than Glu172]prepro-TRH-(172-199) (less than Glu = pyroglutamyl) revealed the presence of a C-terminally extended form of TRH. Quantification of TRH in pancreatic extracts indicated the presence of 22 mol TRH/mol prepro-TRH-(178-199) and 17 mol TRH/mol [less than Glu172]prepro-TRH-(172-199). Treatment of rats with streptozotocin markedly reduced the pancreatic content of both immunoreactive TRH (-84%) and immunoreactive prepro-TRH-(178-199) (-62%). Light microscopic immunocytochemistry showed that prepro-TRH-(178-199)-like immunoreactivity was exclusively located within insulin-containing cells of the pancreatic islets. At the electron microscopic level, prepro-TRH-(178-199) immunoreactivity appeared to be concentrated in secretory granules. The present study demonstrates that processing of pro-TRH generates both non-TRH- and TRH-related peptides in the adult rat pancreas. Our data also indicate that beta-cells of the endocrine pancreas are the major source of TRH- and pro-TRH-derived peptides.\r"

Within the hypothalamus somatostatin mRNA levels are increased and GH-releasing factor mRNA levels are reduced compared to those in nontransgenic littermates. We suggest that the growth retardation in these mice is a consequence of the ectopic human GH disturbing the normal controls that regulate mouse GH synthesis and release from the pituitary. These mice provide a resource for analysis of the regulation of GH production and demonstrate that a dominant phenocopy can be made by producing transgenic mice that have local production of an extra-cellular hormone.\r"

Single treatment with mifepristone or tamoxifen caused a significant inhibition of tumor growth (90% and 75%, respectively), but no tumor remission. In contrast, single treatment with LHRH agonists caused remission of mammary tumor growth by 50% (injection) or 70% (implant), respectively. Combined treatment with mifepristone and tamoxifen caused additive tumor growth inhibitory effects resulting in the same extent of tumor remission as that observed after treatment with LHRH agonist injections alone. Combination of mifepristone with either manner of LHRH agonist administration resulted in the highest tumor remission (approximately 75%). Significant reductions in cytosolic steroid (estrogen and progesterone) receptor contents of mammary tumors were noted after various treatment modalities. The most pronounced decrements were observed after combined treatment with mifepristone and tamoxifen (residual estrogen receptor; 10%; residual progesterone receptor, 0%). On the other hand, suppression of pituitary-ovarian function was most pronounced after treatment with LHRH agonist implants alone or in combination with mifepristone. It is concluded that combination treatment with an antiprogestin and an antiestrogen or an LHRH agonist may be of great value in the endocrine therapy of breast cancer.\r"

  ".W": "Responsiveness of gonadotropes to GnRH depends, in part, on the number of plasma membrane GnRH receptors. Since the steady state level of these plasma membrane receptors is a function of the rates of both receptor generation (synthesis, unmasking, and recycling) and loss (internalization, degradation, and inactivation) we have sought to quantify the rate of synthesis of GnRH receptors in pituitary cell cultures. Further, since the protein kinase-C activator phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) has been shown to unmask a class of GnRH receptors that appear to be uncoupled from phosphoinositide turnover, we have measured the rate of synthesis of this second receptor population. The present studies use the density shift technique; incorporation of densely labeled amino acids confers a higher density to newly synthesized proteins and allows their separation by physical means. Cultures of pituitary cells were prepared from female weanling rats. After cells had attached to the culture dishes, medium was replaced at 12-h intervals with medium containing either densely labeled or normal amino acids. After the incubation, GnRH receptors were covalently linked to a photoaffinity receptor agonist [( 125I]Tyr5-[azido-benzoyl-D-Lys6-GnRH]), then solubilized with 1+ sodium dodecyl sulfate. In some cultures PMA (50 nM) was included during the photoaffinity agonist-binding step. Newly synthesized (dense) receptors were separated from previously synthesized receptors by velocity sedimentation (0-20% sucrose in 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate-10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.0; centrifuged at 156,000 x g for 24 h). Gradients were fractionated, and the radioactivity contained in each fraction was quantified. Newly synthesized GnRH receptors exhibited a higher density, as evidenced by further migration into the gradient, than did normal GnRH receptors. There was a delay of approximately 6 h between exposure to dense amino acids and the appearance of densely labeled GnRH receptors at the plasma membrane. Equilibrium for incorporation of dense amino acids into GnRH receptors was 48 h of exposure to dense amino acids. The time required for synthesis of half the entire population of GnRH receptors was 28 +/- 2 h (mean +/- SEM; n = 4). Scatchard analysis and the pattern of GnRH-stimulated LH release from densely labeled cells indicated that they bound the photoaffinity label (Kd = 0.4 nM; approximately 1 fmol receptor/microgram DNA) and secreted gonadotropin normally. Additionally, treatment with PMA caused a significant increase (181 +/- 24%) in photoaffinity agonist binding, consistent with previous observations.\r"

In the first experiment (Exp I), sexually immature (20-23 days old) intact and hypophysectomized male rats were killed 1, 3, and 7 days after surgery, and the testicular content of inhibin subunit mRNAs was determined by filter hybridization. A second group of immature, intact, or hypophysectomized rats was treated with saline or FSH for 7 days as follows: I) intact, saline; II) hypophysectomized, saline; III) hypophysectomized, FSH [0.05 microgram/100 g BW, sc, twice daily (BID)]; IV) hypophysectomized, FSH (0.50 microgram/100 g BW, sc, BID); V) hypophysectomized, FSH (5.0 micrograms/100 g BW, sc, BID); and VI) hypophysectomized, FSH (50.0 micrograms/100 g BW, sc, BID). In the second experiment (Exp II), adult (60 days old) intact or hypophysectomized animals were treated with saline, FSH, and/or testosterone for 7 days as follows: I) intact, saline; II) hypophysectomized; saline; III) hypophysectomized, 22-mm testosterone implant; IV) hypophysectomized, FSH (50.0 micrograms/100 g BW, sc, BID; and V) hypophysectomized, 22-mm testosterone implant plus FSH (50.0 micrograms/100 g BW, sc, BID. The effects of FSH and testosterone on testicular inhibin subunit mRNA levels were measured by filter hybridization. In Exp I, the level of inhibin alpha-subunit mRNA per testis was significantly lower in hypophysectomized rats than in intact controls at all time points after surgery. Replacement of FSH to hypophysectomized immature rats led to a dose-dependent increase in alpha-subunit mRNA per testis. However, hypophysectomy and FSH replacement had no significant effect on beta-B-subunit mRNA. In adult rats (Exp II), hypophysectomy significantly lowered and FSH replacement increased testicular inhibin alpha-subunit mRNA levels. Replacement of testosterone to adult animals, either alone or in combination with FSH, had no effect on expression of inhibin alpha-subunit mRNA. beta-B mRNA levels in adult testis were not significantly altered by any of the treatments. beta-A-Subunit mRNA levels were below the detection threshold of filter hybridization in both Exp I and II. Collectively, these data demonstrate that FSH regulates alpha- but not beta-B-subunit mRNA in the testis of both immature and adult rats in vivo. Differential regulation of inhibin subunits may provide a mechanism for creation and regulation of functional diversity of inhibin-related peptides in the testis.\r"

  ".W": "It is uncertain whether ERCP and associated procedures are more difficult when the papilla is inside or adjacent to a duodenal diverticulum. We have therefore reviewed the data from 2458 consecutive, prospectively reported ERCPs between November 1983 and March 1988. Three hundred and eight patients (12.5%) had periampullary diverticula and in 21 the papilla was located deep within the diverticulum of whom 227 had undergone endoscopic sphincterotomy (73.7%). Comparison was made with the 2150 patients without diverticula of whom 1223 (56.9%) had undergone sphincterotomy. The success rate of specific duct cannulation was 94.2% in the diverticulum group and 96.7% in those without diverticula (p less than 0.05). The overall success rate of endoscopic sphincterotomy was 95.2% in the diverticulum group, as compared with 98.0% in those without diverticula (p less than 0.05). The procedure related morbidity and mortality of sphincterotomy were 5.2%/0.9% and 4.0%/0.7% respectively (NS). If only those who had successful cholangiography were included there was no difference in sphincterotomy success between those with and without diverticula. The group of patients with papilla deep within diverticula had a slightly higher failure rate of pure endoscopic sphincterotomy (11.8% v 5.7%: NS) but did not have a higher complication rate. In the subgroup of patients with choledocholithiasis, duct clearance of stones was as successful after sphincterotomy in those with diverticula as in those without. Medium term complications (mean 26 months) occurred in 1.4% of patients with diverticula and in 0.7% of patients without diverticula.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The nature of these antigens has only recently been established; the 70 and 50 kD are the transacetylase E2 and component X, respectively, of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex and are distinct polypeptides. We have demonstrated, by immunoblotting, elution and rebinding of antibodies, unequivocal cross-reactivity between the major bands of the M2 antigen. In addition, cross-reactivity has been shown between antibodies binding to each of the three M2 bands of mitochondria and two major antigenic bands of both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. Conversely, antibodies eluted from these two bands of Escherichia coli were found to bind all three M2 bands of mitochondria. These results suggest that the antibodies of primary biliary cirrhosis contain both peptide-specific and cross-reacting antibodies, the latter recognizing a common \"M2 epitope\" that might include nonprotein components of the peptides. However, direct and competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays failed to implicate the coenzyme of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, lipoic acid or its amide, as the common antigenic moiety.\r"

In the present study, the renal, hemodynamic, humoral, and vascular effects of a synthetic (WY-47663) human analogue were studied in five water-loaded (15 ml H2O/kg) patients with adenomatous primary aldosteronism, a salt-sensitive, low renin, volume-expanded syndrome. ANF was infused for 3 hours at a low rate (0.005 micrograms/kg/min), which approximately doubled circulating immunoreactive ANF. Glomerular filtration rate and renal blood flow (inulin and para-aminohippurate clearance) remained stable, but sodium excretion increased significantly suggesting a dissociation between renal hemodynamics and natriuresis as well as a direct inhibitory effect on tubular sodium reabsorption by ANF. Intra-arterial diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, forearm blood flow (plethysmographic method), and arterial plasma norepinephrine did not change, but systolic blood pressure declined and hematocrit rose suggesting plasma volume contraction by ANF. Plasma aldosterone levels were unchanged indicating a loss of ANF-mediated aldosterone inhibition, possibly related to qualitative or quantitative alterations of ANF receptors in tumoral adrenal tissue. Infusion of the analogue into the brachial artery was at a rate of 0.005 micrograms/dl forearm tissue/min x 30 minutes, which also doubled local immunoreactive venous ANF concentrations and vasodilated forearm arterioles. These data suggest a physiological role for ANF in modulating body fluid volume even in human primary aldosteronism.\r"

  ".W": "Studies were carried out in normal male subjects (n = 6, age 20-35 years) to determine the interaction of angiotensin II and plasma sodium on aldosterone secretion. These relations were quantified by elevation of plasma sodium with an infusion of 5% sodium chloride (4 ml/kg/30 min i.v.) with measurements of plasma aldosterone, atrial natriuretic factor (ANF), and arginine vasopressin (AVP) over 3 hours. Two hours before sodium chloride infusion, an intravenous infusion of angiotensin II was begun at 0.5 or 5.0 ng/kg/min and continued throughout the study. Plasma potassium was maintained constant by the addition of potassium to the infusate. NaCl/KCl infusion raised plasma sodium 4 meq/l with no decreases of plasma potassium. Plasma aldosterone averaged 7 +/- 1.8 ng/dl before NaCl infusion in subjects infused with 0.5 ng angiotensin II and was not significantly reduced with sodium chloride infusion. Angiotensin II infused at 5 ng/kg/min resulted in average plasma aldosterone levels of 31 +/- 3.6 ng/dl, which sodium chloride infusion decreased to 16.6 +/- 1.3 ng/dl (p less than 0.05) in 60 minutes. Plasma aldosterone remained depressed for the remaining period of study. Plasma ANF increased from 40 to 60 pg/ml with sodium chloride infusion. We conclude that small physiological elevations of plasma sodium concentrations can signal substantial decreases of plasma aldosterone in normal human subjects in situations where plasma angiotensin II is moderately elevated. The precise mechanisms of these responses remain to be determined.\r"

  ".W": "Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was measured in 16 cranial regions in 23 children and adolescents with frequent headaches using the non-invasive Xenon-133 inhalation technique. Blood flow response to 5% carbon dioxide (CO2) was also determined in 21 patients, while response to 50% oxygen was measured in the two patients with hemoglobinopathy. Included were 10 patients with a clinical diagnosis of migraine, 4 with musculoskeletal headaches, and 3 with features of both types. Also studied were 2 patients with primary thrombocythemia, 2 patients with hemoglobinopathy and headaches, 1 patient with polycythemia, and 1 with headaches following trauma. With two exceptions, rCBF determinations were done during an asymptomatic period. Baseline rCBF values tended to be higher in these young patients than in young adults done in our laboratory. Localized reduction in the expected blood flow surge after CO2 inhalation, most often noted posteriorly, was seen in 8 of the 13 vascular headaches, but in none of the musculoskeletal headache group. Both patients with primary thrombocythemia had normal baseline flow values and altered responsiveness to CO2 similar to that seen in migraineurs; thus, the frequently reported headache and transient neurologic signs with primary thrombocythemia are probably not due to microvascular obstruction as previously suggested. These data support the concept of pediatric migraine as a disorder of vasomotor function and also add to our knowledge of normal rCBF values in younger patients. Demonstration of altered vasomotor reactivity to CO2 could prove helpful in children whose headache is atypical.\r"

Nine children participated in this single-subject, clinical replication series in which clinic-based therapist-administered, home-based child-administered, and home-based parent-administered treatment formats were evaluated. Headache activity was assessed through the use of a daily headache log. Overall, results supported the utility of temperature biofeedback in the treatment of pediatric migraine. Further, it was suggested that home-based treatments may represent an equally efficacious and more cost-effective alternative to traditional clinic-based treatments. Finally, treatment effects were found to be stable, with results maintaining through a one-year follow-up period.\r"

Maximum work capacity during the propranolol trial was significantly increased by 17% in the S group but was unaltered in the PA group. A subanaerobic threshold constant work test in five sedentary subjects demonstrated that propranolol had no effect on the respiratory response both early and late in exercise. In addition, propranolol did not impair the ability of the respiratory control system to maintain alveolar PCO2 at new set points when external dead space was added during constant load work. We conclude that alterations of gas exchange during incremental work after propranolol administration are related to both physical fitness and type of exercise.\r"

  ".W": "The renin-aldosterone system may be depressed in subjects exercising at high altitude, thereby preventing excessive angiotensin I (ANG I) and aldosterone levels, which could favor the onset of acute mountain sickness. The role of beta-adrenoceptors in hormonal responses to hypoxia was investigated in 12 subjects treated with a nonselective beta-blocker, pindolol. The subjects performed a standardized maximal bicycle ergometer exercise with (P) and without (C) acute pindolol treatment (15 mg/day) at sea level, as well as during a 5-day period at high altitude (4,350 m, barometric pressure 450 mmHg). During sea-level exercise, pindolol caused a reduction in plasma renin activity (PRA, 2.83 +/- 0.35 vs. 5.13 +/- 0.7 ng ANG I.ml-1.h-1, P less than 0.01), an increase in plasma alpha-atrial natriuretic factor (alpha-ANF) level (23.1 +/- 2.9 (P) vs. 10.4 +/- 1.5 (C) pmol/1, P less than 0.01), and no change in plasma aldosterone concentration [0.50 +/- 0.04 (P) vs. 0.53 +/- 0.03 (C) nmol/1]. Compared with sea-level values, PRA (3.45 +/- 0.7 ng ANG I.ml-1.h-1) and PA (0.39 +/- 0.03 nmol/1) were significantly lower (P less than 0.05) during exercise at high altitude. alpha-ANF was not affected by hypoxia. When beta-blockade was achieved at high altitude, exercise-induced elevation in PRA was completely abolished, but no additional decline in PA occurred. Plasma norepinephrine and epinephrine concentrations tended to be lower during maximal exercise at altitude; however, these differences were not statistically significant. Our results provide further evidence that hypoxia has a suppressive effect on the renin-aldosterone system. However, beta-adrenergic mechanisms do not appear to be responsible for inhibition of renin secretion at high altitude.\r"

Static ECF pH was acid in the superficial layers (less than 1 mm), compared with the overlying cerebrospinal fluid pH that became alkaline gradually during the experiments. In the deeper VLM areas (1-3 mm), no systematic gradients of ECF pH were observed. We found various, isolated regions where intravertebral artery injections of CO2-saturated saline evoked acidic shift of ECF pH in the time course analogous to ventilatory augmentation. Those responsive regions were found to be scattered not only in the superficial layers but also in the deeper VLM areas, although many nonresponsive regions were also intermingled among them. Occlusions of the principal vessels supplying the tested VLM regions diminished but failed to abolish the ECF pH responses to the CO2 loadings, suggesting a collateral blood flow by fine pial vessels. The present study suggests a possibility that the pH-dependent central chemoreceptors, if any, would be scattered in the deeper VLM areas as well as the superficial layers.\r"

Hypercapnia increased the tidal expiratory activity before and after bilateral vagotomy. Before vagotomy, the rate of rise (tidal expiratory activity/TEa) increased significantly and TEa was shortened. On the other hand, after vagotomy, the rate of rise remained unchanged and TEa was prolonged. An expiratory off-switch model is postulated according to the quantitative relationship between the time and amplitude of the tidal expiratory activity. The expiratory activity pattern in vagotomized rabbits was similar to that in humans.\r"

To differentiate between the plausible mechanisms of effects, we also tested the responsiveness of the afferents to cyanide and nicotine before and after almitrine. After a saturation dose of almitrine (1 mg.kg-1 followed by 0.5 mg.kg-1.h-1) the chemosensory responses to CO2 strikingly increased even during hyperoxia: the afferents showing an increased transient peak activity at the onset of hypercapnia, an augmented steady-state response to CO2 stimulus, and a decreased arterial PCO2 stimulus threshold. Thus, the effect of almitrine on carotid chemoreceptor response to hypoxia could be explained, at least in part, by its multiplicative stimulus interaction with CO2. After almitrine, the chemoreceptor response to cyanide, which is dependent on arterial PO2, was not particularly augmented relative to those of nicotine. Accordingly, the O2-sensing mechanism does not appear to be the primary site of almitrine effect. The results also indicate that the site of CO2 chemoreception resides downstream from those of hypoxia.\r"

Increasing the perfusate pH from 7.40 to 7.65 caused vasodilation, whereas raising pH to 7.70-8.10 caused vasoconstriction. Removing calcium (Ca2+) from the perfusate completely prevented the vasoconstriction caused by alkalosis. Perfusate pH strikingly affected pulmonary vascular reactivity. Acidosis inhibited the vasoconstriction caused by thromboxane and potassium chloride (KCl) but did not affect the response to angiotensin II. Alkalosis, in contrast, augmented the vasoconstriction caused by thromboxane and angiotensin II but reduced the vasoconstriction caused by KCl. Changes in pH also altered thromboxane and prostacyclin synthesis after the infusion of exogenous arachidonic acid (AA) or the endogenous release of AA by the lipid peroxide tert-butyl hydroperoxide.\r"

We verify the accuracy of the extrapolation equation by comparison with published data. Our linear equations for pure gas viscosities yield standard errors less than 0.35 microP. We also compare a nonlinear equation for calculating the viscosities of mixtures of gases with published measured viscosities of dry air, humid air, and He-O2 and N2-CO2 mixtures. The maximum difference between published and calculated values is 1.3% for 10% CO2 in N2. All other differences are less than 0.38%. For saturated humid air at 35 degrees C, a linear concentration-weighted combination of viscosities differs from our nonlinear equation by 4.9, 2.1, and 1.7% at barometric pressures of 32, 83, and 100 kPa, respectively. By use of our method, the viscosity of normal respiratory gases can be calculated to within 1% of measured values.\r"

  ".W": "Recent observations implicate angiotensin-II (AII) as a possible PRL-releasing factor. These observations prompted us to investigate the role of the renin-angiotensin system in PRL release in man. Nine normal volunteers ingesting a 20-40 mmol/day sodium, 70 mmol/day potassium diet and eight normal volunteers ingesting a 120 mmol/day sodium, 70 mmol/day potassium diet were infused with metoclopramide (2.5 mg over 1 min) and later with TRH (500 micrograms), two agents known to cause PRL release. The infusions were repeated after 36 h of oral administration of converting enzyme inhibitor [CEI; captopril (50 mg, orally, four times daily) or enalapril (5 mg, orally, twice daily)]. On a separate occasion, AII was infused at 10 ng/kg.h for 1 h into normal volunteers on normal salt diet. CEI administration lowered mean arterial pressure by 6-7 mm Hg and stimulated the release of active renin. The PRL responses on low and normal salt diet as well as before and after CEI were not statistically different. There was also no difference in the PRL responses of patients placed on captopril vs. those on enalapril. AII increased blood pressure by 11-25 mm Hg, but did not increase PRL significantly above basal concentrations during the control dextrose infusion. Five hyperprolactinemic volunteers were also given CEI for up to 4 weeks. They demonstrated no significant change in serum PRL levels. We conclude that AII in the pituitary does not significantly alter either basal PRL levels or metoclopramide- and TRH-induced PRL responses in normal subjects on low and high salt diets. In addition, CEI is not a useful therapy in patients with pathological hyperprolactinemia. These findings, however, do not exclude a role for AII in physiological regulation, since CEI does not cross the blood-brain barrier and would not be expected to alter hypothalamic AII.\r"

We performed a cross-sectional analysis on the entry data of a 5-yr prospective study of risk factors for osteoporosis to determine the correlation of bone density with serum sex steroid concentrations and body weight. We studied 292 healthy white women, aged 35-50 yr, who were menstruating regularly or had had menses in the past 12 months. Blood samples were drawn in the early follicular phase for estradiol (E2), testosterone (T), dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG). Free levels of E2 (FE2) and T (FT) were calculated based on total T and E2, SHBG, and albumin levels. Women were classified as premenopausal (FSH, less than 12 U/L) and perimenopausal (FSH greater than or equal to 12 U/L; n = 46; 16%). Bone density was measured by dual photon absorptiometry of the lumbar spine (L2-L4) and hip and by single photon absorptiometry of the wrist. Perimenopausal women were older than premenopausal women (45.5 +/- 3.5 and 41.0 +/- 3.9 yr, respectively), but did not differ in height or weight. While bone density did not correlate with age in each group, perimenopausal women had significantly lower bone density at the L2-L4 and femoral neck (L2-L4, 1.18 +/- 0.14 in perimenopausal and 1.24 +/- 0.12 g/cm2 in premenopausal women; femur, 0.84 +/- 0.11 in perimenopausal and 0.90 +/- 0.11 g/cm2 in premenopausal women; P less than 0.005). Body weight showed the strongest positive correlation with bone density. Log FT, percent FT, and FE2 percent correlated positively with bone density, even after controlling for weight. Log SHBG was negatively correlated with bone density in premenopausal women at the hip and wrist after controlling for weight. FSH was inversely correlated with bone density, and E2 and T were lower in perimenopausal than premenopausal women. These data suggest that women who are still menstruating may have relative deficiencies in both E2 and T, with reduced bone densities as a consequence.\r"

  ".W": "Eleven patients with noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus were studied before and after 6-10 weeks of glyburide therapy. Patients were studied during a 24-h period on a mixed diet comprising 30 Cal/kg divided into three meals. The following day a hyperglycemic clamp study was performed, with glucose levels clamped at 300 mg/dL (16.7 mmol/L) for a 3-h period. Insulin secretion rates were calculated by deconvolution of peripheral C-peptide concentrations using individual C-peptide clearance kinetics derived after bolus injection of biosynthetic human C-peptide. After 6-10 weeks on glyburide, the identical studies were repeated. In response to glyburide, the fasting plasma glucose level decreased from 12.3 +/- 1.2 to 6.8 +/- 0.9 mmol/L. Although the mean glucose over the 24 h of the meal study decreased from 12.7 +/- 1.4 to 10.8 +/- 1.2 mmol/L, postprandial hyperglycemia persisted on therapy, and after breakfast, glucose levels exceeded 10 mmol/L and did not return to fasting levels for the remainder of the day. Fasting serum insulin, plasma C-peptide, and the insulin secretion rate were not different before (152 +/- 48 pmol/L, 0.82 +/- 0.16 pmol/mL, and 196 +/- 34 pmol/min, respectively) and after (186 +/- 28 pmol/L, 0.91 +/- 0.11 pmol/mL, and 216 +/- 23 pmol/min, respectively) glyburide treatment despite lowering of the glucose level. However, average insulin and C-peptide concentrations over the 24-h period increased from 366 +/- 97 pmol/L and 1.35 +/- 0.19 pmol/mL to 434 +/- 76 pmol/L and 1.65 +/- 0.15 pmol/mL, respectively. The total amount of insulin secreted over the 24-h period rose from 447 +/- 58 nmol before therapy to 561 +/- 55 nmol while receiving glyburide. Insulin secretion was demonstrated to be pulsatile in all subjects, with periodicity ranging from 2-2.5 h. The number of insulin secretory pulses was not altered by glyburide, whereas pulse amplitude was enhanced after lunch and dinner, suggesting that the increased insulin secretion is characterized by increased amplitude of the individual pulses. In response to a hyperglycemic clamp at 300 mg/dL (16.7 mmol/L), insulin secretion rose more than 2-fold, from 47 +/- 9 nmol over the 3-h period before treatment to 103 +/- 21 nmol after glyburide therapy. We conclude that the predominant mechanism of action of glyburide in patients receiving therapy for 6-10 weeks is to increase the responsiveness of the beta-cell to glucose.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

No significant changes in monomeric PRL were demonstrated during the menstrual cycle, but all subjects showed a small and significant rise in BBPRL during the preovulatory phase. High PRL levels were present in day 1 menstrual plasma, but BBPRL was only present in low concentrations. All subjects (n = 5) demonstrated a rise in both PRL and BBPRL during pregnancy, with a consistent tendency for PRL to increase to a proportionately greater extent than BBPRL. One subject exhibited a rise in PRL (by 93%), but not BBPRL, 30 min after suckling. TRH caused a brisk rise in PRL (by 363 +/- 116%) but only a sluggish rise in BBPRL (by 17.5 +/- 7.4%; n = 3). Bromocriptine rapidly suppressed PRL (by 81.8 +/- 34.4%), but only slowly suppressed BBPRL (by 21.0 +/- 8.7% after 6 h; n = 3). Plasma binding studies did not demonstrate any evidence of a circulating specific PRL-binding protein. These data indicate that plasma concentrations of BBPRL may vary under the influence of a number of factors, but are much less sensitive to TRH stimulation, bromocriptine suppression, pregnancy, and suckling than PRL. The occurrence of BBPRL does not seem to be due to a specific circulating binding protein.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the effects of reversible medical castration on prostatic size and symptoms we treated 15 patients with benign prostatic hypertrophy with a long-acting GnRH analog, leuprolide (1 mg/day sc), for a minimum of 4 months. The men's serum testosterone, dihydrotestosterone, and estradiol concentrations fell to very low levels within 4-6 weeks after the initiation of treatment. Transrectal ultrasonography of the prostate demonstrated an average shrinkage of 40% after 4 months of treatment (n = 15) and 46% after 6 months of treatment (n = 11). All 15 men had improvement in urinary flow and, to a lesser extent, in nocturia and frequency. The side-effects of the therapy were decreased potency and flushing. The most dramatic improvement occurred in 4 of the 5 men who had complete urinary obstruction before treatment. One man had a suprapubic cystotomy tube removed during the fifth treatment month. Two other men who had Foley catheters before treatment are voiding well without catheters since their third treatment month. Another man who had a very large prostate (300 g) before treatment had one successful voiding trial, although he still has a suprapubic cystotomy tube. One man decided to stop treatment after 6 months. Two months later his hormone values and prostate size had returned to pretreatment levels. One man treated during the fourth and fifth months with fluoxymesterone in addition to leuprolide had regrowth of his prostate while receiving this androgen. We conclude that leuprolide treatment of men with benign prostatic hypertrophy results in shrinkage of prostatic size and concomitant improvement in the obstructive symptoms of prostatism. The prostatic shrinkage reverses when treatment is discontinued or combined with androgen.\r"

The lipolytic effect of noradrenaline was four to fivefold more marked in abdominal adipocytes than in gluteal fat cells. This regional difference was more apparent in females than in males. No site differences were observed when lipolysis was stimulated with agents acting at different postreceptor levels. The beta-adrenergic lipolytic sensitivity was 10-20 times greater in abdominal adipocytes from both sexes than in gluteal adipocytes. Abdominal adipocytes from females showed a 40 times lower alpha 2-adrenergic antilipolytic sensitivity than did gluteal adipocytes, but the adenosine receptor sensitivity was similar in both sites. Beta-receptor affinity for agonists displayed no site or sex variation. Abdominal adipocytes showed a twofold increased beta-adrenoceptor density than did gluteal cells from both sexes. The alpha 2-adrenoceptor density was similar in all regions, but in females the affinity of clonidine for these sites was 10-15 times lower in the abdominal fat cells compared with gluteal cells. In conclusion, regional differences in catecholamine-induced lipolysis are regulated at the adrenoceptor level, chiefly because of site variations in beta-adrenoceptor density. Further variations in the affinity properties of alpha 2-adrenergic receptor in females may explain why the regional differences in catecholamine-induced lipolysis are more pronounced in women than in men.\r"

A significant reduction of tonic phase tension occurred with 30 nM PK 11195 or 3 microM Ro 5-4864, but decreases of the initial (first 3 min), phasic contraction were detected only at the highest concentrations of Ro 5-4864 and PK 11195. Protoporphyrin IX, the putative endogenous ligand of the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor, (at 10-100 nM) markedly increased the effectiveness of Ro 5-4864 and PK 11195 in reducing phasic contraction. Intracellular calcium localization and distribution in fura-2 loaded single vascular cells were quantitated using a high sensitivity, two-stage microchannel plate, photon-counting (PMI-VIM) camera. Peripheral benzodiazepines reduced intracellular calcium release from centrally located calcium pools, and this decrease of calcium release was potentiated by protoporphyrin IX. The decrease in intracellular calcium activity, which was more pronounced in the central regions where sarcoplasmic reticular elements are numerous, was probably the major mechanism of these vasodilator properties. Measurements of soluble guanylate cyclase activity also supported the intracellular Ca2+ release mechanism. Under conditions where protoporphyrin IX did not significantly stimulate guanylate cyclase, Ro 5-4864 alone or more effectively in combination with protoporphyrin IX stimulated cGMP production and caused relaxation. Guanylate cyclase forms a possible target for these benzodiazepine modulators, a hypothesis that merits further investigation.\r"

T cell receptor delta gene recombinatorial events were found in 91% of acute T cell lymphoblastic leukemia, 68% of non-T, non-B lymphoid precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and 80% of mixed lineage acute leukemias. Mature B-lineage leukemias and acute nonlymphocytic leukemias retained the T-cell receptor delta gene in the germline configuration. The incidence of T cell receptor gamma and delta was particularly high in CD10+CD19+ non-T, non-B lymphoid precursor ALL. In lymphoid precursor ALL, T cell receptor delta was frequently rearranged while T cell receptor gamma was in the germline configuration. This suggests that TCR delta rearrangements may precede TCR gamma rearrangements in lymphoid ontogeny. In T-ALL, only concordant T cell receptor delta and gamma rearrangements were observed. Several distinct rearrangements were defined using a panel of restriction enzymes. Most of the rearrangements observed in T-ALL represented joining events of J delta 1 to upstream regions. In contrast, the majority of rearrangements in lymphoid precursor ALL most likely represented D-D or V-D rearrangements, which have been found to be early recombinatorial events of the TCR delta locus. We next analyzed TCR delta rearrangements in five CD3+TCR gamma/delta+ ALL and cell lines. One T-ALL, which demonstrated a different staining pattern with monoclonal antibodies against the products of the TCR gamma/delta genes than the PEER cell line, rearranges J delta 1 to a currently unidentified variable region.\r"

  ".W": "The major side effect of thrombolytic therapy is bleeding; however, the pathogenesis of this potential complication is not well understood. Accordingly, we examined the effects of aspirin and recombinant human tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) on serial template bleeding times and on hemostasis parameters in rabbits. The administration of intravenous aspirin (15 mg/kg) produced a slight prolongation in bleeding times, from 2.1 +/- 0.5 to 2.6 +/- 0.5 min (mean +/- SD, n = 26, P less than 0.01), whereas rt-PA (1 mg/kg per h for 2 h) lengthened the bleeding time from 2.4 +/- 0.3 to 3.2 +/- 0.6 min (n = 5, P = NS). Combination of aspirin with 0.5 mg/kg per h of rt-PA for 2 h prolonged the bleeding time from 2.5 +/- 0.4 to 6.2 +/- 0.9 min (n = 10, P less than 0.01), with an associated fibrinogen decrease of approximately 15%. The combination of aspirin with 1 mg/kg per h of rt-PA for 2 h prolonged the bleeding time from 3.0 +/- 0.3 to 8.3 +/- 1.4 min (n = 8, P less than 0.01) and simultaneously induced a decrease of plasma fibrinogen by approximately 40%. Virtually all animals treated with rt-PA and aspirin manifested a bleeding tendency, as evidenced by spontaneous rebleeding at sites of previously performed template bleeding times or oozing at the femoral venous catheterization site. Intravenous bolus injection of 1 mg/kg of guanidine hydrochloride-reactivated recombinant human plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (rPAI-1) at the end of the rt-PA infusion resulted in complete reversal, within 5 min, of the prolongation of the bleeding time, and in a disappearance of the bleeding tendency. Nonreactivated rPAI-1 and tranexamic acid were significantly less potent in reversing the bleeding time prolongation. These findings indicate that aspirin and rt-PA given separately do not markedly affect the template bleeding time, but in combination induce a marked prolongation associated with a significant bleeding tendency. This bleeding time prolongation can be rapidly normalized by the administration of reactivated rPAI-1.\r"

This reaction is controlled by plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1) that is either present in plasma or bound to fibrin, present in a thrombus. We studied the mechanism of in vitro inhibition of both t-PA and u-PA activity by PAI-1 bound to fibrin. It is shown that activation of latent PAI-1 unmasks a specific fibrin-binding site that is distinct from its reactive site. This reactive site of activated PAI-1 bound to fibrin is fully exposed to form complexes with t-PA and u-PA, that are unable to activate plasminogen. Upon complex formation with either one of the plasminogen activators, PAI-1 apparently undergoes a conformational change and loses its affinity for fibrin. Consequently, complexes of u-PA and PAI-1 dissociate from the fibrin matrix and are encountered in the fluid phase. In contrast, t-PA/PAI-1 complexes remain bound to fibrin. By employing recombinant t-PA deletion-mutant proteins, that precisely lack domains involved in fibrin binding, we demonstrate that binding of t-PA/PAI-1 complexes is mediated by both the \"finger\" (F) and the \"kringle-2\" (K2) domain of t-PA. A model is proposed that explains inhibition of the fibrinolytic process, at the level of plasminogen activation by t-PA, directed by PAI-1 bound to fibrin. An implication of the proposed model is that t-PA/PAI-1 complexes and free t-PA compete for the same binding sites on fibrin.\r"

Cells were isolated by bacterial collagenase digestion of trabecular bone (vertebra, rib, tibia, and femur) from 11 subjects (neonatal to adult). Confluent cultures were exposed to phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, PTH, PGE2, epidermal growth factor, 1,25(OH)2 vitamin D3, recombinant human IL-1 beta, and dexamethasone. Collagenase and TIMP were assayed immunologically and also by measurements of functional activity. Collagenase was not secreted in significant quantities by human bone cells under any tested condition. Furthermore, collagenase mRNA could not be detected in hOB. However, hOB spontaneously secreted large amounts of TIMP for at least 72 h in culture. hOB TIMP was found to be identical to human fibroblast TIMP by double immunodiffusion, metabolic labeling and immunoprecipitation, Northern blot analysis, and stoichiometry of collagenase inhibition. SDS-substrate gel electrophoresis of hOB-conditioned media revealed a prominent band of gelatinolytic activity at 68 kD, and specific polyclonal antisera established its identity with the major gelatinolytic protease of human fibroblasts. Abundant secretion of gelatinolytic, but not collagenolytic, enzymes by hOB may indicate that human osteoblasts do not initiate and direct the cleavage of osteoid collagen on the bone surface, but may participate in the preparation of the bone surface for osteoclast attachment by removal of denatured collagen peptides. The constitutive secretion of TIMP may function to regulate metalloproteinase activity.\r"

These CBMC did not respond to normal immunoglobulin, and CBMC of neonates born of uninfected mothers did not respond to antibodies against either T. cruzi or S. mansoni, or normal immunoglobulin preparations. We propose that in utero exposure of a fetus to some idiotypes expressed on placentally transferred antibodies induces anti-Id T lymphocyte sensitization, which we detect as a proliferative response by CBMC exposed to immunoaffinity-purified antibodies expressing the relevant idiotypes. This is the first experimental evidence that children born of mothers with chronic infections undergo natural in utero idiotypic manipulations and are born possessing cellular anti-Id reactivity.\r"

HIV-infected cells, like uninfected cells, did not constitutively produce any detectable amounts of protein or mRNA for TNF alpha or IL-1 beta. After stimulation with LPS or a combination of LPS plus IFN-gamma, TNF alpha and IL-1 beta were detected in tissue culture supernatants and cell lysates and transcripts for both cytokines were seen on Northern blots. No significant difference in production of these two cytokines was observed between uninfected and chronically infected cells. Acutely HIV-infected cells, however, showed phenotypic changes compatible with maturation and an increase in TNF alpha and IL-1 beta mRNA production, and released significantly higher levels of TNF alpha and IL-1 beta compared with chronically infected or uninfected cells. Furthermore, LPS stimulation of HIV-infected cells increased virus production. These results suggest that HIV-infected monocytic cells may produce increased amounts of TNF alpha and IL-1 beta in response to stimuli that could be present in vivo.\r"

IFNs have been shown to enhance the cytotoxic and antiproliferative actions of tumor necrosis factor (TNF), which is a potent mediator of inflammation and sepsis. We show that the acid-labile IFN-alpha present in AIDS sera can induce TNF synthesis and sensitize blood monocytes (BM) to endotoxin stimulation resulting in further synthesis of TNF in vitro. TNF production by BM from patients with HIV infections and normal controls was measured by a cytotoxicity assay on L929 cells using human TNF alpha as a standard. BM from AIDS patients spontaneously produce high levels of TNF and are hypersensitive to endotoxin stimulation, resulting in enhanced synthesis of TNF. In determining the mechanism involved, we demonstrated that treatment of normal BM with AIDS sera results in induction of TNF. Neutralization of the acid-labile IFN-alpha in AIDS sera with polyclonal anti-IFN-alpha antibodies results in diminution of TNF induction. In addition, pretreatment of normal BM with AIDS sera, IFN-alpha, or IFN-gamma renders the cells hypersensitive to endotoxin. Consequently, activation of the TNF system by the acid-labile IFN-alpha contributes to some of the physiological disturbances, such as the wasting syndrome, and to the pathophysiology of sepsis in AIDS patients.\r"

  ".W": "Plasmin resulted in increased neutrophil adherence to cultured ovine pulmonary artery endothelial cell monolayers in a concentration-dependent manner (10(-12)-10(-7) M). The adherence response increased fivefold above baseline within 60 min after addition of plasmin (10(-8) M) and the response persisted up to 30 min after removal of plasmin. The neutrophil adherence was mediated by the action of plasmin on neutrophils rather than endothelial cells. The response was the result of an increase in functional activity of CD18 neutrophil cell surface adhesive glycoprotein. Neutrophil adherence was inhibited by pretreatment of neutrophils with MAbs IB4 and 60.3 targeted against the beta chain of the CD18, whereas control isotypic MAb 60.5 against HLA class I antigen had no effect. The plasmin catalytic site was not involved in the response. Lys-plasminogen had reduced adherence-promoting activity relative to plasmin, whereas glu-plasminogen had no effect. Elastase-derived plasminogen fragments corresponding to kringle 1+2+3 and kringle 4 (both of which contained the lysine-binding sites) possessed neutrophil adherence-promoting activities similar to plasmin, whereas miniplasminogen (which contains the catalytic site but no lysine-binding sites) had minimal effect, indicating the involvement of lysine-binding sites in the response. Blocking lysine-binding sites of plasmin and elastase-derived plasminogen fragments with tranexamic acid (IC50 of 5 mM) inhibited neutrophil adherence. A monospecific polyclonal antibody against the lysine-binding sites also reduced the neutrophil adherence-promoting activity of plasmin. The results indicate that plasmin induces neutrophil adherence to the endothelium and that the effect is mediated by lysine-binding sites on plasmin.\r"

In the absence of factor VIIIa and factor X, normal, thrombin-treated platelets exposed 560 +/- 35 sites for factor IXa with a Kd of 2.75 +/- 0.27 mM, compared with 461 +/- 60 sites per patient platelet with Kd of 3.2 +/- 0.33 nM. The addition of factor VIIIa and factor X resulted in a decrease in the Kd for normal platelets to 0.68 nM but had no effect on the Kd for patient platelets. The concentrations of factor IXa required for half-maximal rates of factor X activation for normal (0.52 nM) and patient platelets (2.5 nM) were similar to those determined from equilibrium binding studies. Kinetic parameters for factor X activation by factor IXa showed that the Km and Kcat were identical for normal and patient platelets in the absence of factor VIIIa. In the presence of factor VIIIa, and kcat for patient platelets (163 min-1) was only 33% of that for normal platelets (491 min-1): This result can be explained by the difference in affinity for factor IXa between normal and patient platelets in the presence of factor VIIIa, suggesting impaired factor VIIIa binding to Scott syndrome platelets.\r"

  ".U": "89340923\r", 
  ".W": "Growth of a variety of human tumor cell lines is inhibited by interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) in vitro. This mechanism is not well understood. The present experiments identify two separate mechanisms which account for the growth inhibitory activity of IFN-gamma. Cell lines most sensitive to IFN-gamma (inhibited by 10-30 U/ml IFN-gamma in 3 d) were stimulated by IFN-gamma to oxidize tryptophan in media to kynurenine and completely eliminated tryptophan from the culture media after 48-72 h. Addition of L-tryptophan, but not other aromatic amino acids, other essential amino acids, or D-tryptophan, prevented inhibition of cell growth by IFN-gamma. The amount of IFN-gamma required to yield 50% inhibition of cell growth was directly related to the concentration of L-tryptophan in culture media and increased from approximately 3 to 600 U/ml as the concentration of tryptophan in the media was increased from 25 to 1,000 microM. By contrast, inhibition of growth of the cell lines, BT20 and HT29, was not prevented by addition of tryptophan. Inhibition by IFN-gamma (100-300 U/ml after 5-6 d) was, however, completely prevented by addition of two inhibitors of adenosine diphosphate-ribosyl transferase (ADP-RT), 3-aminobenzamide or nicotinamide. Activity of ADP-RT was increased in these cell lines after addition of IFN-gamma. ADP-RT catalyzes the incorporation of the ADP moiety of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) into proteins and causes depletion of intracellular NAD. All tumor cell lines tested had reduced levels of intracellular NAD after treatment with IFN-gamma and loss of NAD preceded inhibition of cell growth by 12-24 h. Inhibitors of IFN-gamma-mediated inhibition of cell growth prevented loss of levels of intracellular NAD. Generation of reactive oxygen species lead to DNA strand breaks which result in activation of ADP-RT. Increased DNA strand breaks were induced in BT20 and HT29 cells but not ME180 and A549 cells after culture with IFN-gamma. The two enzymes known to catalyze the decyclization of tryptophan to kynurenine require superoxide anion for activity. Increased amounts of superoxide anion were released from ME180 and A549 cells after culture with IFN-gamma. Reduced oxygen concentration decreased the ability of IFN-gamma to inhibit tumor cell growth in vitro. Intracellular glutathione has been shown to protect cells against oxidative damage by various agents. Elevation or reduction of intracellular glutathione concentrations lowered or raised sensitivity of cell lines to IFN-gamma, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

To characterize the in vivo mechanism of action of vanadate, we examined meal tolerance, insulin-mediated glucose disposal, in vivo liver and muscle glycogen synthesis, and in vitro glycogen synthase activity in 90% partially pancreatectomized rats. Four groups were studied: group I, sham-operated controls; group II, diabetic rats; group III, diabetic rats treated with vanadate; and group IV, diabetic rats treated with phlorizin. Insulin sensitivity, assessed with the euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp technique in awake, unstressed rats, was reduced by approximately 28% in diabetic rats. Both vanadate and phlorizin treatment completely normalized meal tolerance and insulin-mediated glucose disposal. Muscle glycogen synthesis was reduced by approximately 80% in diabetic rats (P less than 0.01) and was completely restored to normal by vanadate, but not by phlorizin treatment. Glycogen synthase activity was reduced in skeletal muscle of diabetic rats (P less than 0.05) compared with controls and was increased to supranormal levels by vanadate treatment (P less than 0.01). Phlorizin therapy did not reverse the defect in muscle glycogen synthase. These results suggest that (a) the defect in muscle glycogen synthesis is the major determinant of insulin resistance in diabetic rats; (b) both vanadate and phlorizin treatment normalize meal tolerance and insulin sensitivity in diabetic rats; (c) vanadate treatment specifically reverses the defect in muscle glycogen synthesis in diabetic rats. This effect cannot be attributed to the correction of hyperglycemia because phlorizin therapy had no direct influence on the glycogenic pathway.\r"

PTPase activity was detected in both cytosolic and particulate fractions of rat liver and produced linear dephosphorylation over a 15-min time course. In rats made insulin-deficient diabetic by streptozotocin treatment (STZ), cytosolic PTPase activity increased to 180% of the control values after 2 d of diabetes and remained elevated at 30 d (P less than 0.02). Gel filtration on Sephadex-75 revealed a single peak of activity in the cytosol in both control and diabetic animals and confirmed the increased levels. In BB diabetic rats, another model of insulin deficiency, the PTPase activity in the cytosolic fraction was increased to approximately 230% of control values. PTPase activity in the particulate fraction of liver was also increased by 30 and 80% after 2 and 8 d of STZ diabetes, respectively. However, this increase was not sustained and after 30 d of STZ diabetes, PTPase activity associated with the particulate fraction in the BB diabetic rat was reduced to approximately 70% of the control levels. Treatment of STZ diabetic rats with subcutaneous insulin or vanadate in their drinking water for 3 d reduced tyrosine PTPase activity in the particulate, but not in the cytosolic fraction. This was associated with a change in blood glucose toward normal. These data indicate insulin deficient diabetes is accompanied by significant changes in hepatic PTPase activity. Since tyrosine phosphorylation plays a central role in the cellular action of insulin receptor, an increase in PTPase activity may be an important factor in the altered insulin action associated with these diabetic states.\r"

Abnormal immunologic findings have been detected in T suppressor cell activity, B cell responsiveness, and natural kill (NK)-cell function. NK-cell function has been described as low and to be poorly responsive to high concentrations of interferon (IFN). The present study was initiated to determine the response of NK-cell function of patients with PBC to all forms of IFN (alpha, beta, and gamma) at low concentrations. Ten patients were assessed on two occasions approximately 5 months apart. There was a significant decrease in the NK-cell function in a 4-hour assay but only one patient had low NK-cell function after an 18-hour assay. The augmentation of NK-cell activity secondary to 10 and 50 U/ml of IFN-alpha, beta, and gamma was equivalent in the patients and in the control subjects. The relative increase induced by IFN was higher during the 4-hour assay than in the 18-hour assay. Hence, there may be a kinetic impairment of NK-cell function in patients with PBC, but the ultimate lytic activity, and response to the various forms of IFN, are normal.\r"

We describe a modification of this method that involves inhalation of serially doubling incremental concentrations of lysine-aspirin by a standardized technique and allows construction of concentration-response curves. In 11 subjects with asthma, mean (SEM) age 48.2 (2.9) years, the geometric mean (range) provocation concentrations of histamine and lysine-aspirin required to produce a 20% decrease in FEV1 from baseline were 0.6 (0.04 to 3.2) and 48.3 (15.5 to 219) mg/ml, respectively. No relationship was found between these values. In seven of nine subjects investigated on two consecutive occasions, bronchoconstriction with lysine-aspirin was repeatable to within a single doubling concentration difference. Bronchoconstriction provoked by lysine-aspirin was more rapid than with oral aspirin and was not followed by any late asthmatic reaction or increase in nonspecific airway hyperresponsiveness. In six subjects, premedication with the selective H1 histamine-receptor antagonist, terfenadine, had no significant effect on bronchoconstriction provoked by inhaled lysine-aspirin, indicating little role for release of histamine in the response. We conclude that inhalation of lysine-aspirin may be used as a bronchoprovocation procedure for the diagnosis and investigation of aspirin-sensitive asthma.\r"

Older GI patients (i.e., 65 years and over) had higher hospital costs, longer lengths of stay, more diagnoses and procedures per patient, and a higher mortality rate than younger patients. Both intensive care unit (ICU) and blood utilization rose with age. Thus, older GI patients consumed a disproportionately larger share of hospital resources. Our study suggests that the current DRG reimbursement scheme may be inequitable relative to the older GI medicine patient; financial disincentives from DRGs may affect elderly patients' access to and quality of care in the future.\r"

  ".W": "CTL and NK cells produce a cytolytic pore-forming protein (perforin, cytolysin) localized in their cytoplasmic granules. These cytotoxic cells are resistant to killing mediated by other lymphocytes and by purified perforin. A membrane factor, known as homologous restriction factor (HRF), has been suggested to confer protection to different cell types against both C- and perforin-mediated lysis. The granules of human large granular lymphocytes have been reported to contain, in addition to perforin, a soluble HRF activity that can be eluted from anion-exchange columns at 115 mM NaCl. Here, we report that a soluble HRF activity is absent in the granules or the cytosol of murine CTL and human NK cells. Our data indicate that the inhibition attributed to HRF could be explained by exogenous EDTA added during granule fractionation. EDTA was shown to bind to Mono Q and to elute at 90 to 120 mM NaCl. A second perforin-inhibitory activity was also eluted from such a column. However, it was present in preparations obtained not only from CTL and NK cells, but also from some perforin-susceptible tumor cell lines, indicating that it has nonrestricted distribution and suggesting that it is probably irrelevant to the perforin-protection mechanism. Our results argue against a role for soluble granule HRF or other soluble factors in mediating resistance of cytotoxic lymphocytes against perforin-mediated lysis.\r"

  ".W": "The inductive interaction between class II+ APC and Th cell was investigated in a human system at the chemical level. The study set out to test the predictions of a model of Ag presentation in which epsilon-amino groups and carbonyl groups at the surface of APC and T cell react covalently to form reversible intercellular Schiff bases. In the experimental system of oxidative mitogenesis this process results in T cell activation. If oxidative mitogenesis is an experimental amplification of a physiologic process, and intercellular Schiff base formation is essential in Ag presentation, then it should be possible to inhibit Ag presentation by prior formation of Schiff bases on the surface of participating cells. In this situation Ag-induced T cell activation and T cell activation induced by periodate oxidation should invariably behave in the same way. It should also be possible to demonstrate Schiff base formation occurring between accessory cells and lymphocytes directly and definitively by means of specific reduction with sodium cyanoborohydride. Aldehyde treatment of accessory cells should prevent this intercellular Schiff base formation. In this study the following observations were made. 1) Both Ag-specific and periodate-induced T cell activation were inhibited by aldehyde treatment of class II+ accessory cells. 2) Noncross-linking donors of carbonyl groups other than aldehydes inhibited Ag-specific T cell activation. 3) Brief, low-dose treatment of T cells with aldehydes inhibited Ag-dependent T-cell activation. 4) Exogenous amino groups in the form of lysine and other amino acids inhibited both Ag-specific and periodate-induced T-cell activation. 5) The weak reducing agent sodium cyanoborohydride which is specific for Schiff bases at neutral pH inhibited both Ag-induced and periodate-induced T cell activation. Responses to PHA were markedly prolonged by this reagent. 6) Schiff base formation occurring between accessory cells and lymphocytes was detected directly and definitively by means of radiolabeling with NaCNB(3H)3 at neutral pH. These data are consistent with the view that the formation of reversible covalent Schiff bases between ligands on APC and T cell is an essential process in Ag-induced T cell activation.\r"

We have previously shown that the functionally distinct subsets of CD4+ lymphocytes identified by anti-CD45R mAb represent cells at different stages of an activation-dependent post-thymic differentiation pathway. In the present studies, we have analyzed the functional capabilities and the lineal relationship of the subsets of CD8+ cells defined by anti-CD45R mAb. Both the CD8+CD45R+ and CD8+CD45R- subpopulations were able to proliferate in response to PHA and anti-CD3 mAb. Similarly, both subsets contained cells with suppressor functions as well as precursor cells which could develop into alloreactive CTL. However, effector CTL derived from each precursor population expressed the CD8+CD45R- phenotype, suggesting that the expression of this Ag might be altered by cell activation or maturation. Studies of purified CD8+CD45R+ cells showed that activation by mitogens or alloantigenic stimuli resulted in a defined sequence of phenotypic changes. First, these cells acquired the expression of the CD29 antigen by a mechanism independent of cell division or the presence of exogenous IL-2. This was followed by the loss of CD45R Ag expression, an event that required exogenous IL-2. When the CD8+CD45R+ precursor cells were stimulated with allogeneic cells, the alloreactive CTL that were generated acquired the CD8+CD45R- phenotype, whereas the CD8+ cells that retained CD45R expression had no CTL activity. The ability to monitor phenotypic changes associated with the post-thymic differentiation of human CD8+ CTL offers a tool for studies of the immune response against viral infections or for assessing allograft rejection.\r"

The EBV responsiveness appears to be confined to a very limited subpopulation of B cells, the nature of which is still unclear. In these studies, we sorted tonsillar B cells on the basis of their expression of the early surface activation Ag, Bac-1, and compared their proliferative responses to EBV. Bac-1+ cells responded to EBV with a relatively high level of DNA synthesis, whereas the Bac-1- cells did not. Both large and small Bac-1+ cells were responsive to EBV and the responsiveness was unrelated to the level of Bac-1 immunofluorescence intensity. Bac-1+ cells were relatively enriched for surface IgM and IgD expression. When the Bac-1- population was enriched for IgM+ cells, the proliferative response was still significantly lower than that of the Bac-1+ population. B cells acquire the ability to bind IgM relatively late after activation, and this feature did not distinguish the EBV-responsive B cells. The results suggest B cells become responsive to EBV after an early activation signal.\r"

FK-506 shares a number of immunosuppressive properties with the cyclic peptide, cyclosporin A (CsA), although 10 to 100 times more potent in this regard. These similarities suggest that both agents may share a similar mechanism(s) of action at the biochemical level. We have identified a cytoplasmic binding protein for FK-506 in the human T cell line, JURKAT, using [3H]FK-506. The FK-506 binding protein has a mr of 10 to 12 kDa (as determined by gel filtration), is heat stable and does not bind CsA. This contrasts with the CsA binding protein, cyclophilin, in that cyclophilin is heat labile and has a mr of 15 to 17 kDa. Our data suggest that FK-506 binds to a low m.w. protein(s) in JURKAT cells, which is distinct from cyclophilin. This protein may mediate the immunosuppressive effects of FK-506 in T cells. In addition, our results suggest that the immunosuppressive activity of FK-506, as with CsA, is mediated by an intracellular mechanism.\r"

We report here that rIL-1 is capable of such a negative regulatory process. The simultaneous addition of rIL-1 and rIFN-gamma to rat synovial fibroblasts resulted in decreased Ia Ag and mRNA expression when compared with synovial fibroblasts treated with IFN-gamma alone. Both rIL-1 alpha and rIL-beta inhibited to a similar degree with the level of inhibition being dependent on both the concentration of IL-1 and IFN-gamma. Other cytokines, including IFN-alpha/beta, IL-2, and TNF, had no antagonistic effect on IFN-gamma-induced Ia expression. Time course experiments showed that IL-1 inhibited when present immediately before addition of IFN-gamma or when added during the first 24 h of IFN-gamma stimulation but not at later time points. Indomethacin failed to reverse the IL-1-mediated inhibition, despite the fact that exogenously added PGE2 also inhibited IFN-gamma-induced Ia expression. IL-1 treatment of synovial cells did not alter the ability of IFN-gamma to bind to the cells. These findings provide evidence for a negative regulatory role for IL-1 on synovial fibroblasts independent of PGE2 production and thus suggest that IL-1 is capable of both pro- and antiinflammatory actions within the rheumatoid joint.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of human TNF on cultured human microvascular endothelial (HME) cells was examined. Incubation with TNF alone transformed the morphology of HME cells from a cobblestone-like appearance into a disordered array of criss-crossed, elongated, spindle-shaped cells. Coadministration of epidermal growth factor (EGF) and TNF caused even more dramatic morphologic changes than TNF alone. Addition of basic fibroblast growth factor or insulin-like growth factor-I showed rather weak effects on cell morphology than EGF. Cell growth of HME cells was stimulated up to two-fold by TNF whereas addition of EGF additively enhanced the growth rate. Treatment of HME cells with 10 ng/ml EGF increased the binding of 125I-TNF, and Scatchard analysis showed increased TNF-R number by EGF treatment. Cellular response to TNF in the absence or presence of EGF was assessed by analyzing SDS-PAGE patterns of secreted proteins from HME cells. TNF enhanced the secretion of a protein of molecular weight 25,000 Da (25 kDa) which was found to be IL-6. In contrast, secretion of a polypeptide of 29 kDa was significantly increased when HME cells were treated with EGF, but not with TNF. Coadministration of TNF and EGF synergistically increased the secretion of the 29-kDa protein. This 29-kDa protein was found to be tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases when assayed with antitissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases antibody. TNF and EGF also enhanced secretion of collagenase with Mr of approximately 55 kDa. Increased steady state levels of the inhibitor mRNA were observed when HME cells were treated with EGF, and coadministration of TNF further increased the levels. The morphologic transformation of HME cells by TNF and/or EGF is discussed in relation to their expression of the secreted proteins.\r"

This receptor (Fc gamma RI) has been partially characterized using mAb 32 which binds outside the Fc binding domain of the receptor, but nonetheless triggers Fc receptor-dependent functions. In this study, we describe the properties of four new antibodies with specificity for Fc gamma RI. Based on additivity and cross-blocking studies, we conclude that two of these antibodies (mAb 22 and 44) define a third epitope which is distinct from the binding sites for both mAb 32 and the Fc portion of human IgG. Each Fc gamma RI-specific hybridoma was selected for stable sublines expressing high levels of mAb on the cell surface, and then tested for the ability of this surface mAb to trigger antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity. All sublines were killed by human monocytes when used as targets in a 51Cr-release assay, whereas hybridomas specific for myeloid Ag other than Fc gamma RI were not killed. We conclude that Fc receptor function is triggered through binding to each of the three epitopes of Fc gamma RI that we have defined. These mAb will be useful for additional characterization of Fc gamma RI, and may, when incorporated into tumor-directed heteroantibodies, enhance tumor cell killing by human monocytes and macrophages.\r"

  ".W": "Here we have used hybrid mouse IgG1-2a and IgG2a-2b mAb to demonstrate that the interaction between the human high-affinity IgG FcR (huFc gamma RI) and monomeric mouse IgG2a mAb requires only one of the mIgG2a H chains. Recently, we reported a method for the generation and isolation of hybrid hybridomas, producing hybrid mouse mAb. Using this method we have obtained hybrid mouse (m)IgG1-2a and mIgG2a-2b mAb reacting with either horseradish peroxidase or human IgA1 (monospecific mAb) or with both Ag (bispecific mAb). Using protein A- or Ag-affinity chromatography purified hybrid mAb, we demonstrate here the binding of monomeric hybrid mIgG1-2a and mIgG2a-2b mAb to huFc gamma R on U937 cells, whereas no binding could be observed to the K562 cell line. Monomeric mouse IgG2a mAb and human IgG1 were found to be capable of inhibiting the binding of these hybrid mIgG1-2a and mIgG2a-2b mAb in a manner similar to the way they inhibited binding of monomeric mIgG2a mAb to U937 cells; this is in contrast to our findings for mIgG1 and mIgG2b mAb which did not inhibit the binding of both hybrid mAb. In addition, the binding of the hybrid mIgG1-2a and mIgG2a-2b mAb could be blocked by mAb TB-3, which is known to block huFc gamma RI-mediated binding by the \"Kurlander phenomenon\" and not by the anti-Fc gamma RII mAb CIKM5 and IV.3. These results indicate that both types of monomeric hybrid mAb are bound by the huFc gamma RI. Scatchard plots of mIgG2a, hybrid mIgG1-2a, and mIgG2a-2b mAb binding revealed similar numbers of binding sites and similar affinity constants of huFc gamma RI for these mAb (0.9 to 3.6 x 10(8) M-1). These results suggest that huFc gamma RI, present on the U937 cell line, are capable of binding monomeric hybrid mIgG1-2a and mIgG2a-2b mAb, and that this interaction requires only one of the mIgG2a H chains.\r"

Cathepsin D-treated BSA gave rise to the human octapeptide (above) as well as to an extended decapeptide with H-Tyr-Glu- at the N-terminus.

  ".U": "89341407\r", 
  ".W": "Previous studies demonstrating hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate (PIP2) and generation of inositol phosphates in neutrophils exposed to 20.0 mM NaF provide indirect evidence that activation of phospholipase-associated guanine nucleotide regulatory protein, a guanine nucleotide binding protein which regulates the activation of a membrane inositol-specific phospholipase C, is an early event in the neutrophil stimulus-response pathway triggered by fluoride. Consistent with this hypothesis, exposure of a plasma membrane rich preparation isolated from 32P labeled neutrophils to 20.0 mM NaF resulted in hydrolysis of labeled PIP2. Levels of other phospholipids were not affected. Inositol bisphosphate and inositol trisphosphate were detected in extracts of neutrophil plasma membranes exposed to fluoride. To further explore the involvement of guanine nucleotides in functional responses of intact neutrophils triggered by fluoride, we preincubated cells with 2-beta-D-ribofuranosylthiazole-4-carboxamide (tiazofurin), a selective inhibitor of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase, to diminish guanine nucleotide synthesis and then compared superoxide generation induced by FMLP, PMA, digitonin, and 20.0 mM NaF to intracellular levels of guanine nucleotides. Preincubation of neutrophils for 2.5 h at 37 degrees C with tiazofurin resulted in dose-dependent depletion of GTP and GDP. Maximal depletion of guanine nucleotides required relatively high levels of tiazofurin (200 to 400 microM) and resulted in a 55 to 60% reduction of GTP and GDP. The effects of tiazofurin on guanine nucleotides levels were not observed when neutrophils were preincubated at 4 degrees C. AT 37 degrees C, tiazofurin also decreased intracellular ATP and ADP levels but adenine nucleotide depletion was less pronounced than guanine nucleotide depletion for each concentration of tiazofurin used. When tiazofurin was removed by washing cells after incubation, adenine nucleotide quickly returned to preincubation values but guanine nucleotide levels remained depressed. Addition of exogenous guanosine (200 microM) prevented tiazofurin-dependent depletion of guanine nucleotides but had no influence on adenine nucleotide depletion. Superoxide released triggered by FMLP and F- was inhibited to an extent similar to that of guanine nucleotide depletion under different conditions of preincubation. Inhibition of superoxide release was not observed if cells were preincubated at 4 degrees C, was not rapidly reversible, and was not observed when guanosine was added with tiazofurin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Although prior studies with mAb have defined an endogenous chymotrypsin-like protease in the neutrophil (polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN)) membrane that is associated with initiation of superoxide response to inflammatory stimuli, it is not known whether extracellular proteases (in the inflammatory milieu) can also influence PMN activation. This study examined the ability of four neutral proteases: cathepsin G, elastase, chymotrypsin, and trypsin, to modify PMN superoxide response to FMLP, PMA, and arachidonate. In response to 1 microM FMLP, PMN treated with cathepsin G, chymotrypsin, or elastase showed 64%, 60%, and 32% increases, respectively, in superoxide generation when compared with control, untreated cells (p less than 0.05 for each). These increments were dependent on intact enzymatic function of the proteases, were greatest when enzyme and stimulus were added concurrently, and persisted after PMN were washed free of enzyme. Enhancement of superoxide response was not stimulus specific; in response to 10 ng/ml PMA, cells treated with cathepsin G showed a 84%, and elastase a 57%, increase in superoxide generation (p less than 0.05 for both) with a marked reduction in the time required for onset of this response. For cell activation with 80 microM arachidonate, treatment with elastase produced a 180% increase in superoxide production (p less than 0.025). Neutrophils incubated with trypsin demonstrated significant decreases in superoxide response to PMA (-34%, p less than 0.05) and arachidonate (-39%, p less than 0.01). The enzymes themselves were not stimuli for superoxide production nor were they scavengers for superoxide in cellfree system. We conclude that local release of the PMN primary-granule neutral proteases, cathepsin G, and elastase within inflammatory sites can augment neutrophil effector function by up-regulating oxidative response to defined inflammatory stimuli. This autocrine/paracrine function may provide a significant increase in antimicrobial activity, but may also enhance the potential for host tissue injury.\r"

  ".W": "We studied the effect of human IgA1, the predominant IgA subclass in serum, on C-mediated killing of Neisseria meningitidis. We purified monomeric IgA1 from normal human serum and tetravalent meningococcal polysaccharide vaccinate serum by using the following successive chromatographic steps: jacalin lectin affinity, Superose 12 FPLC gel filtration, Mono Q FPLC anion exchange, and anti-IgG affinity. SDS-PAGE, ELISA, and Western immunoblot analyses of the IgA1 detected no trace of contaminating IgG or IgM. IgA1 initiated partial or complete lysis (62 to 100%) of nine group C strains by using either normal, hypogammaglobulinemic, factor B-depleted, or properdin-deficient human serum as a C source, but IgA1 was unable to effect killing in serum chelated with 10 mM MgCl2 and 10 mM EGTA. Lytic activity was dependent on the group C strain and the source of the IgA1; neither IgA1 preparation was bactericidal for all nine strains. Removal of the Fc portion of IgA1 with pepsin completely abolished bactericidal activity. We purified and radiolabeled C component C3, and found that IgA1 did not increase C3 deposition. With the use of a group C polysaccharide ELISA, we found that the vaccinate IgA1 had a high titer of group C polysaccharide antibody, whereas the IgA1 purified from normal human serum had no detectable group C polysaccharide specificity. Absorption of the vaccinate IgA1 with alum-bound group C polysaccharide did not affect the killing of a sensitive strain, but it did potentiate the killing of a previously resistant strain. Western immunoblots of whole cell lysates, outer membrane complex, and purified lipooligosaccharide showed that the bactericidal IgA1 was specific for several outer membrane proteins. Four of the proteins recognized by both IgA1 preparations had apparent Mr of 29, 42, 66, and 74 kDa. We conclude that IgA1, when bound to specific outer membrane proteins, can initiate lysis of group C meningococci via the classical C pathway, and that initiation of lysis is an Fc-dependent event which occurs without an increase in C3 deposition.\r"

Virus antigen of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) was usually present before day 11 of the disease, especially from days 4-7. Virus isolates were more readily recovered from plasma early in the course of the illness and less frequently after day 7. The use of PBMCs rather than plasma enabled isolates to be recovered at a rate nearly twice that permitted by plasma and allowed the isolation peak of HTNV (days 4-7 after onset of disease) to extend an additional 2 or 3 d, thus prolonging the period of detectable viremia until days 8-11. PBMCs were especially useful in isolating viruses from patients with hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome in whom antibody titers were generally high during the acute phase of the disease. HTNV was isolated from the cerebrospinal fluid of patients, but was difficult to recover from other body fluids.\r"

To verify this, incorporation of [3H]paraaminobenzoic acid [( 3H]PABA) into reduced folates by P. carinii and T. gondii was investigated. Both organisms synthesized tritiated reduced folates. In P. carinii, 10-formyltetrahydrofolate and tetrahydrofolate, and in T. gondii, 5-formyltetrahydrofolate were the major synthesized folates. P. carinii remained metabolically active in vitro for only a few days. Because current systems for screening antipneumocystis agents are cumbersome, the utility of this assay system for screening therapeutic agents was investigated. Sulfonamides and pentamidine efficiently inhibited de novo folate synthesis in P. carinii. Inhibitors of dihydrofolate reductase such as trimethoprim and trimetrexate were poor inhibitors for P. carinii but efficient inhibitors for T. gondii. This study demonstrates the first unambiguous evidence of metabolic activity in P. carinii, and provides a potential assay for efficiently screening antipneumocystis drugs in vitro.\r"

To determine if beta-lactamase produced by Hemophilus influenzae and Branhamella catarrhalis have similar importance in mixed infections, a thread infection model in mice was used to evaluate the capacity of beta-lactamase produced by S. aureus, B. catarrhalis, or H. influenzae to hydrolyze ampicillin in a mixed infection with Streptococcus pneumoniae in mice. For both S. aureus and B. catarrhalis, the ampicillin concentrations at infection sites where beta-lactamase was produced were lower than at sites where beta-lactamase was not produced; however, this difference was not found when clavulanic acid was added to the ampicillin. In mixed infections with strains that did not produce beta-lactamase, ampicillin concentrations were similar with or without clavulanic acid. S. aureus was the best \"protector\" followed by B. catarrhalis. The beta-lactamase produced by H. influenzae failed to protect the S. pneumoniae. No bactericidal effect of clavulanic acid was found.\r"

The suppressed PHA blastogenic response on day 7 was not enhanced by the addition of interleukin-2 or indomethacin even though an increase in cell number expressing CD25 was observed. The removal of CD4+ or CD8+ cells enhanced the PHA response but only on days 2 or 4 and not at other sampling times, which suggests that the suppression is mediated by CD4+ or CD8+ cells. The addition of interleukin-2 alone or with PHA did not reverse the suppression at any time tested. In vitro induction of suppressor cells was performed and was blocked by the addition of indomethacin at the time of culture initiation.\r"

Reduced minus oxidized spectra of mitochondrial cytochromes revealed a decreased content of cytochrome aa3 in only one patient, but a normal content in the other. A combined deficiency of complexes I and IV in muscle might either be due to a deficiency of a single subunit common to both complexes or to a coincidental deficiency of both complexes expressed either in the same or in different fibres.\r"

ANF stimulated intracellular cGMP accumulation, as measured by specific radioimmunoassay, in a concentration-dependent manner over the same concentration range. The cGMP analog, N2-2'-O-dibutyryl cGMP also inhibited K+-induced norepinephrine and dopamine release in a concentration-dependent manner.

Endothelin produced concentration-dependent contraction of rabbit isolated aortic rings which was independent of the endothelium; the EC50 values were 6.1 and 5.6 nM for endothelium-intact and endothelium-denuded vascular rings, respectively. Endothelin (1 nM) did not induce the release or inhibit the effect of endothelium-derived relaxing factor in precontracted aortic rings. Removal of calcium from the external bathing medium reduced the maximal contractile response induced by endothelin (0.1 microM) by only 12%; however, addition of ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N'-tetraacetic acid (0.1 mM) to the calcium-free medium produced a marked inhibition (approximately 75%) of endothelin-induced contraction. The dihydropyridine calcium channel antagonists nicardipine (1 microM) or nifedipine (1 microM), and also diltiazem (1 microM), had little or no effect on endothelin concentration-response curves. Contraction produced by endothelin (30 nM) was not associated with an alteration in the levels of cyclic 3',5'-adenosine monophosphate or cyclic 3',5-guanosine monophosphate in either endothelium-intact or endothelium-denuded aortic rings. Endothelin (1 nM-0.1 microM) produced concentration-dependent stimulation of phosphatidylinositol (Pl) turnover in aortic rings when exposed to tissues for periods greater than or equal to 15 min. Endothelin-induced stimulation of Pl turnover was unaffected by nicardipine (0.1 microM). In calcium-free medium (+0.1 mM ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N'-tetraacetic acid) basal Pl turnover was reduced; however, endothelin (1 nM-0.1 microM) produced similar percentage increases over basal levels to those observed in the presence of calcium.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

SCH 39370 (30 mg/kg s.c) significantly delayed the disappearance of immunoreactive (ir) ANF from plasma in rats after an i.v. infusion of ANF (1 microgram/kg/min for 30 min): the plasma ir ANF level at 15 min postinfusion was 1.5 +/- 0.3 ng/ml vs. 0.3 +/- 0.04 ng/ml in the control. SCH 39370 also delayed the disappearance of ir ANF after infusion of the peptide (0.1 microgram/kg/min for 30 min) which increased plasma levels to those observed during volume expansion. This effect was accentuated markedly in rats with bilateral nephrectomy. The hypotensive response to injection of ANF (30 micrograms/kg i.v.) in spontaneously hypertensive rats (-38 +/- 6 mm Hg vs. -13 +/- 2 mm Hg in the control) and the diuretic and natriuretic responses to ANF in normal rats were potentiated by SCH 39370 (30 mg/kg s.c.), respectively. The results suggest that NEP can play a role in ANF disposition in vivo and that potentiation of the biological activities of high doses of ANF by SCH 39370 may be consequent to its inhibitory effect on ANF degradation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Several studies suggested that catecholamines modulate renal sodium and water excretion by direct stimulation of adrenergic receptors located on the renal proximal tubule. However, neither the mechanism nor the class of adrenoceptor involved in this effect have yet been established definitively. In the present study, we examined the effects of L-norepinephrine (NE) and selective alpha-1, alpha-2 and beta adrenergic agonists on monovalent cation transport and on Na+-K+-adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) activity from homogenates, intact tubules and highly purified basolateral membranes prepared from superficial rabbit kidney cortex. Our results showed that neither NE nor specific alpha-1, alpha-2 and beta adrenergic agonists (10 microM) modified ouabain-sensitive uptake of 86Rb+ (a K+ analog) in intact proximal tubules. Similarly, it is demonstrated that NE and alpha and beta adrenergic agonists did not affect Na+-K+-ATPase activity from homogenates, intact tubules and basolateral membranes. The integrity of the alpha-2 adrenergic receptor system, the predominant adrenergic subtype in rabbit proximal tubule, was supported by the following findings: 1) maximal binding of [3H] rauwolscine was about 4-fold higher in basolateral membranes than in homogenates; 2) 5'-guanylimidodiphosphate induced a 27-fold increase in the Ki of NE for alpha-2 receptor in basolateral membranes; 3) NE (5 microM) inhibited by 35% parathyroid hormone-stimulated cyclic AMP production in intact tubules. In conclusion, these data fail to demonstrate that NE, as well as other adrenergic agonists, directly increases Na+-K+-ATPase in the rabbit proximal tubule. Further investigations are needed to clarify the interaction of catecholamines with the renal Na+K+ pump.\r"

  ".W": "The induction of prostaglandin (PG) biosynthesis by human recombinant interleukin-1 beta (hrIL-1 beta) has been investigated using rat-isolated stomach strip preparations. hrIL-1 beta (30 and 120 pM) increased CaCl2 responses in a dose-dependent manner with both concentrations significantly potentiating maximum contraction (62.4 +/- 5.1 and 184.2 +/- 36.9%, respectively). This enhancement was characterized further using inhibitors of arachidonic acid metabolism, mRNA and protein synthesis as well as a selective leukotriene (LT) D4 antagonist. Indomethacin (5.6 microM) reduced CaCl2 contractions in the presence of hrIL-1 beta (30 pM) such that only a small residual response was evident, this being reduced further by NDGA (20 microM). Contrastingly, nordihydljroguaiaretic acid reduced only the enhancement of response due to hrIL-1 beta. These findings, supported by parallel radio-immunoassay of PGE2 in the bathing medium after drug treatments suggest strongly that the augmentation of contraction by hrIL-1 beta is due mainly to increased production of PGs. Furthermore, this enhancement is inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by the LTD4 antagonist FPL55712. Additionally, using actinomycin-D and cycloheximide we demonstrated that the hrIL-1 beta induced potentiation is dependent upon mRNA and protein biosynthesis as both compounds substantially reduced responses in the presence of the interleukin. These results provide possible evidence that hrIL-1 beta induced PG production is mediated by a lipoxygenase product, most likely LTD4, which in turn could be important for the induction of de novo protein synthesis.\r"

No age-dependent change in [3H]ouabain binding site concentration was observed. Mean value +/- S.E.M. was 268 +/- 17 pmol/g wet wt. (n = 18), range 182 to 433 pmol/g wet wt. At the age of 1 day, 3.5 month and 8 years and 8 months, unspecific uptake and retention of [3H]ouabain was 1.6, 1.4 and 1.5% of the total uptake and retention; release of specifically bound [3H]ouabain during the washout procedure took place with T 1/2 of 97, 90 and 73 hr; and apparent affinity constants for [3H]ouabain binding (KD) was 1.3 x 10(-8), 0.9 x 10(-8) and 1.2 x 10(-8) mol/l. [3H]Ouabain binding site concentrations and kinetics were in agreement with values from adults except that in children apparent affinity constant (KD) was 1.7 times the value in adults. The observation of no age-dependent changes in human skeletal muscle Na,K-adenosine triphosphatase concentration was at variance with the observations of such changes in animals. The total number of Na,K-pumps in the pool of skeletal muscles increased from 10 to 50 times that in the heart from birth to old age. The skeletal muscle pool of Na,K-pumps seems to constitute a distribution volume of importance during digitalization in children as well as adults.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "89342254\r", 
  ".W": "The effects of somatostatin on the contractile response of guinea pig cardiac preparations were investigated and compared with those of carbachol and adenosine. Somatostatin produced a concentration-dependent negative inotropic effect in the left atria, which was accompanied by a decrease in action potential duration. The maximum decrease in contractility which was obtained at 3 x 10(-6) M was around 40% of the predrug control values and far less than those produced by carbachol and adenosine. Somatostatin failed to produce inotropic effect on the papillary muscle and did not influence the spontaneously beating rate of the right atria. In the papillary muscles, however, somatostatin inhibited the positive inotropic effect of isoproterenol in a concentration-dependent manner as did carbachol and adenosine. In addition, somatostatin caused a significant inhibition of the isoproterenol-induced increase in cyclic AMP levels without affecting the basal level of cyclic AMP. In the papillary muscle, the inhibitory effect of somatostatin on the positive inotropic response to isoproterenol was significantly attenuated by pretreatment with islet-activating protein, and was significantly antagonized by the somatostatin antagonist cyclo[7-aminoheptanoyl-Phe-D-Trp-Lys-Thr(Bzl)]. These results suggest that somatostatin receptors in guinea pig ventricular muscles are coupled with adenylate cyclase via islet-activating protein-sensitive GTP-binding protein, whereas the negative inotropic effect of somatostatin in the left atria might be mediated by a subtype of somatostatin receptors which is different from that in the ventricle.\r"

  ".W": "Intravenous injection of anesthetized ventilated guinea pigs with doses of endothelin ranging from 0.25 to 2.50 micrograms/kg caused dose-dependent decreases in respiratory system conductance and compliance. These effects were maximal 1 min after injection and had disappeared 15 min thereafter. When guinea pigs were pretreated with 3 mg/kg of propranolol or 5 mg/kg of hexamethonium, endothelin-induced bronchoconstriction rose significantly, but when they were pretreated with 3 mg/kg of propranolol plus 3 mg/kg of atropine it remained unchanged. The bronchoconstrictor effects of endothelin were suppressed in guinea pigs pretreated with 0.5 or 2 mg/kg of meclofenamate but remained unchanged in those pretreated with 30 micrograms/kg of nicardipine. Endothelin did not increase either lung permeability, as assessed by 99m technetium diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid clearance, or airway responsiveness to histamine or 5-hydroxy-tryptamine. Histological studies showed that endothelin induced reversible contraction of airway and pulmonary artery smooth muscles but no inflammatory reactions. These results demonstrate that, in guinea pigs, endothelin 1) induces airway smooth muscle contraction mediated by cyclooxygenase metabolites and modulated by the autonomic nervous system and 2) does not induce airway hyperreactivity or inflammation.\r"
