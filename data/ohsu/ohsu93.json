Development and use of routine quality control methods now enable us to compare different samples from a given individual and monitor with confidence biological variation and response to medical or surgical treatment. Although our test is extremely predictive of how well a patient's specimen may do as a result of normal intercourse, artificial insemination, and human in-vitro fertilization, it must be stressed that the sperm penetration assay and the sperm capacitation index reported by our laboratory only measure the ability of a sperm to capacitate and fuse with zona-free hamster ovum. How well spermatozoa disperse the cumulus and bind to and penetrate the human zona pellucida is not measured by this test. This would be reflected by an apparent \"false-positive\" outcome in the sperm penetration assay. However, our data from 138 patients suggest that this occurs only on rare occasions (in 2 of the 138). The test can be used only as a supplement to a conventional semen analysis because other factors, such as motile concentration and motility characteristics, clearly are also of importance particularly in vivo. The results obtained by our laboratory using the optimized assay described herein demonstrate that this test can play an important role in the evaluation of an infertile man.\r"

The utilization of a scrotal cooling device as \"specific\" nonsurgical treatment for varicocele is yet to be defined. Immunologic suppression is indeed a specific form of therapy for a measurable phenomenon; unfortunately, the significance of that phenomenon as well as the best means and location of its assessment are undergoing significant reevaluation. An exciting frontier is the prospect of preventing infertility in the patient undergoing therapy for cancer, thus obviating the need for treatment of the ensuing infertility. Before specific therapies can be anticipated to have a predictable beneficial effect, these areas require active investigation to define the problem more clearly.\r"

The increase in sperm/egg interaction allowed by IVF is rewarded with a pregnancy rate that is not statistically different from that for the overall IVF population. In our last 100 consecutive cycles, after altering our ovulation induction method to produce more oocytes per retrieval attempt, our overall clinical pregnancy rate was 25 per cent. The pregnancy rate for the male-factor patients during this same time period was 20 per cent, a rate similar to the monthly fecundability rate of a normal population of fertile couples. Further, in our hands the sperm penetration assay is of great help in predicting the ability of a human sperm to fertilize a human oocyte.\r"

  ".U": "87293492\r", 
  ".W": "The success of IVF has led to the adaptation of IVF sperm processing methods for WIUI. When WIUI is used for treating oligoasthenospermia, there is a theoretical advantage because an isolated population of only the most motile, capacitated sperm are placed directly into the wife's uterus. The cervix and its mucus are bypassed, which may provide a mechanical or biochemical advantage for semen from subfertile males. Removal of seminal plasma (and prostaglandins contained therein) prevents the painful uterine contractions that can occur when raw semen is placed directly into the uterine cavity. The disadvantages of WIUI are related to its expense, problems with precise timing of ovulation, and the frustration that can occur when inseminating personnel are not available whenever ovulation occurs on weekends or holidays. Only truly committed couples who will try WIUI for multiple cycles should be selected for this method of infertility treatment. Although male-factor infertility currently is one of the main indications for WIUI, the widely variable pregnancy rates reported with WIUI leave some doubt regarding its ultimate role in the treatment of this condition. Our own preliminary results with WIUI for treatment of asthenospermia, oligoasthenospermia, and \"cervical factor\" infertility are encouraging, although the numbers of patients are small. We anticipate that with further refinement of methods of sperm processing and with the newer improved methods of home monitoring of ovulation, these results may improve. Factors that determine pregnancy rates of WIUI for the treatment of oligoasthenospermia are numerous. The degree of oligospermia and/or asthenospermia, the cooperation and persistence of the couple through the required cycles of WIUI (drop-out rate), the method and meticulousness of sperm processing, the accuracy of monitoring ovulation, the availability of insemination personnel whenever ovulation occurs (even on weekends and holidays), and possibly the duration of infertility will all play a role in the ultimate success of WIUI programs. Couples selecting WIUI must be aware that it does not now offer a high pregnancy rate when used for treatment of male-factor infertility. The apparent increased pregnancy rate of WIUI compared with other methods of AIH may have resulted from modern methods of monitoring ovulation. Studies have not yet been performed to show whether comparable pregnancy rates would be obtained if similar methods of monitoring ovulation were used with cervicovaginal methods of AIH. We believe the only clear indication for WIUI now is an abnormal sperm-cervical mucus interaction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Clinicians performing in-vitro fertilization and artificial insemination should be especially sensitive to the ethical and legal concerns raised by the selection of patients and donors, the informed consent process, and record-keeping. As reproductive technologies such as these develop, the clinician not only has a duty to monitor their safety and efficacy, but also to provide extensive information to the participants and to society at large to make possible informed decisions about how best to enhance the benefits and avoid the risks of these new technologies.\r"

The clinical results to date have been published in detail and are very satisfactory overall. Night-time incontinence is the most significant drawback of the Camey procedure. We present this limitation to all candidates as a trade-off for voiding by the urethra versus having an abdominal stoma that requires intermittent catheterization in other forms of continent diversion. The Camey ileal bladder represents a substantive addition in the ongoing search for an ideal bladder substitute.\r"

The conclusion from the analysis of factors responsible for this selectively proximal process is that sperm secretion was probably a major factor but was certainly not the only factor responsible.\r"

  ".W": "Male F1 hybrid rats bearing the R-3327 transplantable adenocarcinoma demonstrating similar growth patterns within the original sample of animals were carefully separated into control and treatment groups for each growth pattern. This assured treatment of tumors with similar cell kinetics within each group. In one group, cyclophosphamide (100 mg/kg) was injected intraperitoneally once every four weeks for eight weeks (total of two doses). In the second group, methotrexate (7.5 mg/kg) followed in ninety minutes by 5-fluorouracil (50 mg/kg) were injected intraperitoneally once each week for eight weeks (total of eight doses). These drug dosages did not depress the white cell count of the animals, and they tolerated the medicines well. Excellent suppression of tumor growth was obtained in each group with the cyclophosphamide treatment group being significant at the 0.01 level and the methotrexate-5-fluorouracil treatment group being significant at the 0.05 level.\r"

Ambulatory monitoring provides a means of identifying those patients in whom increased myocardial oxygen demand is the most important mechanism and who will respond to a beta blocker. In contrast, those patients with coronary spasm are best treated with a calcium antagonist. The history of angina pectoris and the time of onset may, in itself, be misleading. Detailed ambulatory monitoring studies show that nocturnal angina is frequently due to increased myocardial oxygen demand and in such circumstances should be treated by careful control of the heart rate using a beta blocker without intrinsic sympathomimetic activity. Other factors that will influence the choice of medical therapy must be considered. Smoking is particularly important because it not only acts detrimentally in terms of increased myocardial oxygen demand, but may also interfere with the metabolism of those antianginal agents that are metabolized in the liver. The importance of silent myocardial ischemia has been emphasized recently, and studies using ambulatory pulmonary artery monitoring have shown that silent ischemic episodes have the same significance in terms of hemodynamic effects as painful ischemic episodes. The therapeutic and prognostic implications of these findings need to be explored.\r"

  ".U": "87295734\r", 
  ".W": "Restenosis after arterial angioplasty appears to be a response to deep arterial injury, which is much more thrombogenic than superficial injury (endothelial denudation). Deep arterial injury exposes collagen, elastin and smooth muscle cells to circulating blood, releases tissue thromboplastin and causes immediate platelet-thrombus deposition as a result of activation of platelets and the clotting system, both of which mutually facilitate activation of the other. Regrowth of endothelium also is protective against platelet deposition. Platelet adherence to collagen, and thus to the arterial wall that is deeply injured, increases with shear rate (related inversely to the fourth power of luminal cross-sectional area and directly to blood flow); thus, the effect of shear rate increases the importance of adequate dilatation at the time of the procedure. Therapy that will reduce acute platelet-thrombus deposition appears to be an important factor for reduction of restenosis. Vasoconstriction occurs experimentally after arterial angioplasty in arterial segments proximal and distal to the dilated segment where there has been no necrosis of smooth muscle cells. The vasoconstriction is directly related to the severity of platelet deposition, can be reduced by reducing platelet deposition with low dose aspirin (1 mg/kg daily) and is probably mediated by vasoconstrictor substances from platelets (thromboxane A2, serotonin and other substances). Platelet-membrane receptor inhibitors to these substances reduce the vasoconstriction but do not reduce platelet deposition. Therapeutic intervention should probably involve both anticoagulation and platelet inhibition. Platelet-membrane receptor inhibition to the fibrinogen receptor, factor VIII-von Willebrand factor or both may be necessary acutely to sufficiently reduce acute platelet-thrombus deposition.\r"

Many approaches to altering these processes are available, but to date none has shown a high rate of success. Heparin has properties relevant to both processes; this makes it an attractive compound for further study. The anticoagulant action of heparin is well known. It is mediated primarily though complex formation with antithrombin III, which leads to a conformational change and an increased rate of thrombin inactivation. Heparin has additional antithrombotic actions, largely mediated through the formation of the same complex, but involving precursor elements such as factor Xa. These actions of heparin can be localized to different portions of the large, complex molecule. Additionally, experimental studies have demonstrated an antiproliferative action of heparin, a property that may be relevant to smooth muscle cell proliferation after angioplasty. This is mediated by a fairly small, functionally distinct nonanticoagulant portion of the heparin molecule. Fragments of heparin possessing particular actions are being investigated experimentally and clinically. Continued investigations of the structure and function of heparin promise to lead to a decreased rate of restenosis and a better understanding of the mechanisms of angioplasty.\r"

Acute success in dilation of the coronary lesion is likely if there is at least a resultant 1.3 mm2 minimum lumen area, equivalent to a 1.3 mm mean minimum lumen diameter, or about a 50% diameter stenosis of a typical proximal vessel. The measurement methods applied to this problem include a digital caliper, computer-assisted border recognition techniques and a video-densitometric approach to estimation of lumen area. Calipers are recommended because of their simplicity, precision and accuracy for the routine assessment of angioplasty result. Border-recognition techniques require considerable operator input to distinguish true flow channels from cul de sacs in the dissected segment. The automated scanning videodensitometry approach has theoretical appeal and has shown promise in preliminary reports; however, there is the potential for large measurement errors in the setting of dissection. Further, certain qualitative morphologic features of the dilated segment, such as longitudinal or transverse dissection or intraluminal thrombus, may effectively contribute to the prediction of acute complications and may be useful predictors of late restenosis. Because these features are best appreciated at increased arteriographic magnification, further high resolution studies will be necessary to better understand their importance.\r"

Clinical and anatomic descriptors of those patients who develop restenosis have been identified and suggest a complex, multifactorial etiology. Optimal initial enlargement of the diameter probably reduces the chance of restenosis on geometric grounds alone. The independent predictive value of a low final translesional pressure gradient indicates that adequate blood flow may reduce platelet adhesion and thrombus formation. The importance of the latter factor remains uncertain. Individual proliferative responses to the intimal and medial injury caused by balloon dilatation appear to be modulated by both lesion-specific and patient factors. Lesion-specific factors appear most important and relate to vessel site, tortuosity and branching. These factors are also thought to influence native atherogenesis but the relation between restenosis and atherogenesis remains obscure. Patient risk factors for coronary artery disease also appear to influence restenosis. Procedural factors and risk factor modification may partially modify the restenosis response; however, prevention of restenosis will depend on finding agents that block either stimulation or proliferation of smooth muscle cells.\r"

In selected patients with multivessel coronary disease, PTCA is a safe and effective procedure for the immediate relief of anginal symptoms. However, many questions remain regarding the long-term therapeutic benefit of the procedure. Few data are available on the incidence and clinical significance of restenosis after multilesion PTCA. Clearly, there is the potential for a higher rate of restenosis in patients who undergo dilatation of more than 1 lesion. Determination of restenosis rates after multilesion PTCA is important in the definition of expanded indications for this procedure. Because of the variations in definitions of restenosis and in patient selection factors, reported recurrence rates after multilesion PTCA are not easily compared between patient series. After multilesion dilatation the risk of developing at least 1 recurrent lesion ranges from 26% to 53% and appears to be greater than that reported for single lesion PTCA. Multilesion restenosis occurs in 7% to 21% of patients who undergo multilesion PTCA and is frequently observed in patients with recurrent symptoms. \"Silent\" multilesion restenosis (i.e., multiple lesion restenosis without symptoms) is rare. A higher risk of restenosis at one of several dilatation sites in a patient with extensive coronary disease should not be a deterrent in recommending multilesion PTCA to selected patients with multivessel coronary disease because the procedure provides important symptomatic relief to most. Further, recurrent narrowings are usually amenable to a second dilatation attempt if clinically indicated.\r"

Patients who needed a second angioplasty due to restenosis (n = 30) had a restenosis rate of 33%. Patients with angioplasty in the aortocoronary bypass (n = 14) had a restenosis rate of 45%. All patients were treated before, during and at least 4 to 6 months after the procedure with 60 to 100 mg of isosorbide dinitrate daily plus 160 to 360 mg of verapamil or 100 to 150 mg of gallopamil and 1.5 g of acetylsalicylic acid. In a second retrospective study 111 of 399 patients had the acetylsalicylic acid therapy discontinued or decreased. Forty-two of them developed restenosis (38%), whereas only 49 of 288 patients who continued to receive 1.5 g aspirin developed restenosis (17%). The restenosis rate was 32% in those who received the reduced dose of aspirin. Thus, a large dose of acetylsalicylic acid given before, during and 4 to 6 months after the procedure seems to be necessary to achieve a low rate of restenosis after PTCA.\r"

A second follow-up angiogram was performed in 107 patients (59%), including all patients with persistent or recurrent anginal symptoms, between 7 and 18 months after PTCA. Fifty-one of the 181 patients (28%) had restenosis on 51 of 205 successfully dilated segments (25%). The stenosis was greater than or equal to 70% in 49 of these 51 segments; it was 65% and 55%, respectively, in the 2 remaining patients. Restenosis was documented angiographically at a median time of 4.7 +/- 4 months. However, 47 patients (92%) had restenosis documented within 6 months, 2 between 7 and 12 months and 2 between 13 and 18 months after PTCA. Stepwise logistic regression analysis selected the following factors as independent predictors of restenosis after PTCA: variant angina, multivessel disease, severity of residual stenosis and less reduction in the diameter of the stenosis on the angiogram immediately after PTCA. Of these 4 factors, the degree of residual stenosis immediately after PTCA was by far the most significant. It is concluded that restenosis occurs in approximately 25% of patients, almost always within the first 6 months, after successful PTCA. The degree of residual stenosis after PTCA is the most important predictor of restenosis. Increased experience and improved instrumentation may eventually lead to less residual stenosis and better late results after PTCA.\r"

Laser balloon angioplasty, performed during the final inflation of an otherwise conventional balloon angioplasty procedure, uses the coagulative properties of Nd:YAG laser radiation to weld together disrupted tissue elements thermally, to reduce elastic recoil and to destroy viable arterial tissue. Studies in human postmortem atheromatous arteries and in animal models in vivo indicate that laser balloon angioplasty, by creating a lumen that approximates the size and smooth cylindrical shape of the balloon, should be effective in the treatment of important causes of restenosis.\r"

Arrhythmias after reperfusion did not produce clinical symptoms and did not degenerate into ventricular fibrillation even though the patients were not receiving antiarrhythmic therapy. In the 4 patients without signs of reperfusion, the prevalence and frequency of all ventricular arrhythmias during the 24 hours after treatment was lower than in patients with reperfusion, and none had an accelerated idioventricular rhythm.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Of 35 patients who were sent home with AMI, only 11 (31%) returned to the same hospital because of persistent symptoms. Compared with a control group of 105 randomly selected patients with AMI who were admitted from the emergency room, patients in whom AMI was missed were significantly younger, had less typical symptoms and were less likely to to have had prior AMI or angina or to have electrocardiographic evidence of ischemia or infarction not known to be old. Despite the less typical presentations of patients in whom AMI was missed, after controlling for age and sex, the short-term mortality rate was significantly higher among patients in whom AMI was missed but in whom it was detected through our follow-up procedures than in admitted AMI patients. As determined by independent reviewers, 49% of the missed AMIs could have been diagnosed through improved electrocardiographic reading skills or by admission of patients with recognized ischemic pain at rest or ischemic electrocardiographic changes not known to be old.\r"

  ".W": "To assess the relative role of increased ventricular preload and critical coronary lesions in ergonovine-induced myocardial ischemia, 9 normal subjects (group A), 7 patients with stable angina (group B) and 5 with variant angina (group C) were studied. In all patients, the 12-lead electrocardiogram, blood pressure and left ventricular (LV) volume (technetium-99m blood pool) were continuously recorded before and during administration of incremental doses of ergonovine given at 5-minute intervals. In all subjects, an initial LV dilatation developed; in group B and C patients, this was followed by a decrease in stroke volume and ejection fraction with subsequent onset of electrocardiographic changes and angina. The interval between these events was significantly shorter in group C and in 3 group B patients; in these patients, signs of ischemia appeared with smaller ergonovine doses and at minimal preload increase, coronary constriction being the likely mechanism of ischemia. In the remaining 4 group B patients, the onset of stroke volume, ejection fraction, electrocardiographic changes and angina was significantly delayed, occurring after administration of larger ergonovine doses when LV volume was already considerably increased. This finding suggests that the loading effect of ergonovine on LV volume, rather than on coronary constriction, could be the prevailing mechanism of ergonovine-induced ischemia in these patients.\r"

Measurements were made at rest and during exercise in 23 patients with suspected coronary artery disease (CAD) before and after either metoprolol or propranolol, given in doses to provide comparable beta 1-receptor blockade. Quantitative coronary angiography was performed at rest. Using a randomized, double-blind protocol, either beta 1 and beta 2 blockade was produced by propranolol (0.1 mg/kg intravenously), or selective beta 1 blockade was produced by metoprolol (0.15 mg/kg intravenously). As expected, at these doses both drugs produced a comparable decrease in heart rate at rest and during exercise, averaging 9% and 14% after propranolol and 10% and 16% after metoprolol. Exercise duration to ischemia was prolonged in most patients with severe CAD after either propranolol (5 of 7) or metoprolol (6 of 10) treatment. The effects of these 2 beta-blocking drugs on systemic hemodynamic values at rest and during exercise were similar. Additionally, coronary sinus flow was usually unchanged by both drugs at rest (-5% after propranolol and -4% after metoprolol, differences not significant) and decreased a similar amount during exercise (-15% after propranolol and -9% after metoprolol, both p less than 0.05). Coronary resistance did not change significantly with either drug (0% after propranolol and 3% after metoprolol), and during exercise (11% after propranolol and 3% after metoprolol), suggesting that decreases in flow were secondary to reduced demand. Furthermore, neither drug produced detectable changes in coronary artery size.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

With verapamil treatment, CO modestly increased (7%), O2 extraction decreased and VO2 did not change. In contrast to O2 utilization, the drugs produced opposite changes in mixed venous and arterial blood gas levels. Propranolol decreased mixed venous pH, increased CO2 tension and decreased the pH of arterial blood. Verapamil increased venous pH and decreased CO2 tension; pH of arterial blood did not change. The drugs yielded similar levels of antianginal efficacy, but patients exercised longer during verapamil therapy and were less fatigued. The hemodynamic and metabolic differences suggest that muscle perfusion during exercise influences the onset of fatigue and may help determine the choice of therapy.\r"

Drug titration phases ensured maximal therapy of propranolol, isosorbide or nifedipine. The combination of nifedipine and propranolol was more effective than the combination of isosorbide and propranolol in reducing angina and increasing exercise capacity (323 vs 416 seconds, p less than 0.005) during exercise treadmill testing. Nifedipine produced a greater reduction in systolic blood pressure at submaximal exercise than isosorbide. Global and regional ejection fraction at rest and exercise was assessed with radionuclide ventriculography. The substitution of nifedipine for isosorbide depressed the global ejection fraction at rest (0.61 to 0.56 p less than 0.05) and produced a slight improvement in exercise ejection fraction (0.47 to 0.51, difference not significant). The decrease in ejection fraction from rest to exercise was 0.14 to 0.04 with nifedipine (p less than 0.005). The benefit of nifedipine compared with isosorbide occurred in regions with marked exercise-induced ischemia. In patients treated with maximal beta-blocking therapy, nifedipine is an effective alternative to isosorbide as a combination agent with propranolol. The salutary effects of nifedipine included afterload reduction with exercise and possible improvements in coronary blood supply.\r"

Onset of myocardial ischemia during coronary occlusion was prevented or delayed after administration of nicardipine in 7 of the 10 patients. During infusion of nicardipine and during LAD occlusion, residual great cardiac vein blood flow increased in 9 of 10 patients compared with residual flow during occlusion before nicardipine (10%, p less than 0.05). Nicardipine also decreased mean aortic pressure, but was associated with a reflex-mediated increase in heart rate. Overall, the double product, an index of global myocardial oxygen demand, decreased 7% (p less than 0.05). Thus, nicardipine usually diminished ischemia induced by acute transient coronary occlusion by increasing collateral flow while oxygen demand decreased.\r"

VT was rendered noninducible in 6 of 54 patients (11%) taking oral amiodarone. During a mean follow-up of 32 months, these 6 patients remained free of VT or sudden cardiac death. Forty-eight patients (89%) continued to have VT inducible by programmed ventricular stimulation. However, they could be separated into 2 groups: VT-modified (20 patients) and VT-unchanged (28 patients). In the VT-modified group, the induced VT with amiodarone was slowed or rendered nonsustained, and only 3 of 20 (15%) patients during a mean follow-up of 23 months had well tolerated VT recurrences. In the VT-unchanged group, 16 of 28 patients (57%) had recurrences of VT or ventricular fibrillation during a mean follow-up of 24 months. Sudden cardiac death occurred in 6 of these 16 patients.

Therefore, muscle metabolism was examined by 31P nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) at rest and during repetitive bulb squeeze exercise in 11 patients with New York Heart Association class II to IV CHF and 7 age-matched control subjects. Serial spectra were obtained at rest, at 2 levels of exercise and during recovery. At rest, the only abnormal finding was an elevated inorganic phosphate (Pi) concentration (5.0 +/- 1.5 vs 3.6 +/- 0.4 mM, p less than 0.01). At the lower exercise level, phosphocreatine (PCr) utilization, which was followed as the ratio of [PCr]/[( PCr] + [Pi]), was greater (0.36 +/- 0.16 vs 0.53 +/- 0.10, p less than 0.02), and pH fell more rapidly and to a lower value (6.38 +/- 0.25 vs 6.85 +/- 0.17, p less than 0.001). At the higher level of exercise, the patients could not work effectively and the group differences narrowed. Compared with control subjects, acidification was disproportionately greater in relation to PCr depletion in patients, further suggesting excessive dependence on glycolytic metabolism. The Pi peak was prominently double in 5 patients, indicating presence of a population of muscle fibers undergoing unusually active glycolysis. PCr resynthesis, a reflection of oxidative phosphorylation, was delayed in 4 patients. These findings indicate that in many patients with CHF, exercising muscle has marked metabolic changes consistent with impaired substrate availability and altered biochemistry.\r"

Mitral valve orifice area was determined by the Gorlin equation, 2-dimensional echocardiography and Doppler pressure half-time. Doppler pressure half-time and catheterization estimates of mitral valve area correlated well (r = 0.85) in patients without significant mitral regurgitation. This correlation was maintained in patient subgroups with and without significant (at least 2+) AR (r = 0.86 and 0.83, respectively). Similarly, Doppler and 2-dimensional echocardiographic assessment of mitral valve area showed a strong correlation (r = 0.84). Again, the correlation between the 2 methods was similar in patients with and without significant AR (r = 0.86 and 0.82, respectively).

Mitral valve area could be quantified by 2-D echo in 39 of 43 patients and by Doppler in 31 of 34 patients, for a success rate of 91%. A reliable technique for measuring Doppler T 1/2 in nonlinear Doppler velocity tracings was a \"mid-diastolic\" line-drawing method, validated with the \"anatomic\" mitral valve area by 2-D echo (r = 0.89) and with the \"hemodynamic\" mitral valve area by the Gorlin formula (in pure MS without regurgitation) (r = 0.95). By both Doppler T 1/2 and hemodynamic P 1/2, the use of 220 ms to predict a mitral valve area of 1.0 cm2 was validated. Each T 1/2 and P 1/2 had an exponential inverse relation to the mitral valve area by the Gorlin formula in pure MS. Doppler and 2-D echocardiographic quantification of MS are complementary. Reliable measurement of T 1/2 in nonlinear velocity tracings is achieved by a mid-diastolic line-drawing method and use of the equation 220 ms/T 1/2 = mitral valve area accurately quantifies MS.\r"

In 56 patients, the degree of MR by intraoperative color Doppler correlated well with left ventricular angiography (kappa = 0.80) and with closed-chest preoperative color Doppler (kappa = 0.84) and had good interobserver reproducibility (kappa = 0.88). Good correlation was also seen between closed-chest color Doppler and angiography (kappa = 0.75). After mitral valve repair in 18 patients (15 ischemic MR, 3 cleft valves), color Doppler was used to assess severity of residual MR intraoperatively and postoperatively. Intraoperative color Doppler identified satisfactory repair (MR less than or equal to 2+) in 15 patients and failure (MR greater than or equal to 3+) in 3, whereas conventional surgical assessment of MR by fluid filling of the arrested ventricle failed to provide reliable differentiation. MR severity on subsequent closed-chest color Doppler follow-up did not change significantly compared with intraoperative evaluation after repair. Intraoperative color Doppler provides accurate grading of MR severity, offers instantaneous evaluation of the adequacy of mitral valve repair before chest closure, and appears to predict the degree of postoperative MR seen on subsequent closed-chest follow-up studies.\r"

Circulatory dynamics in the fetus differ from circulatory dynamics after birth because right and left ventricles work in parallel. Therefore, volume flow was estimated over the mitral and tricuspid orifice separately. Serial 2-D echo Doppler studies were performed in 28 normal fetuses at 4-week intervals from 15 to 18 weeks of gestation to the time of parturition. Measurement of blood flow velocities through mitral and tricuspid valve orifices and measurement of the diameter of these valve orifices were obtained from apical 4-chamber views of the fetal heart. Angle-corrected mean temporal blood flow velocities increased linearly with gestational age, whereas the area of blood flow and calculated right and left ventricular output increased exponentially. The right ventricular blood flow velocities, areas of tricuspid orifice and calculated right ventricular outputs were significantly higher than those for the left ventricle when analyzed by paired t test (0.005 greater than 2p greater than 0.001). The ratio of right to left ventricular output decreased from 1.34 +/- 0.28 (+/- standard deviation) at 15 weeks to 1.08 +/- 0.28 at 40 weeks. The combined ventricular output of the fetus near term is approximately 1,735 ml/min, whereas flow indicated for estimated fetal weight is constant at a mean value of 553 +/- 153 ml/min/kg. Thus, 2-D echo Doppler provided a means of estimating fetal cardiac blood flow at the atrioventricular orifices, and blood flow measured at these orifices increased exponentially during gestation, with a larger output from the right ventricle than from the left ventricle.\r"

  ".W": "Eight patients treated by balloon angioplasty for coarctation restenosis have been followed for 4 to 54 months (mean 40) by physical examination using Doppler pressures and by magnetic resonance imaging in a superconducting magnet operating at 0.6 tesla. Image analysis was performed by inspection and by measurement of the aorta, with particular attention to the angioplasty site and its relation to the ascending aorta at the same axial level. Similar measurements were made from immediate postangioplasty angiograms. Residual pressure gradients were 0 to 12 mm (mean 2), reflecting persistent absence of a gradient in 1 patient and further gradient reduction in 7. Images showed no aneurysm formation, mild residual or recurrent stenosis in 4 patients, minimal focal periaortic soft tissue thickening in 1 patient and an interval increase in the ratio of ballooned segment diameter to ascending aortic diameter in the 7 patients in whom it could be measured. Thus, intermediate-term results of balloon dilatation of coarctation restenosis are excellent and magnetic resonance imaging is well suited to the serial studies required in these patients.\r"

  ".W": "To investigate the nature of the dominant intrinsic cardiac pacemaker activity after the Senning procedure, endocardial mapping of the systemic venous atrium was accomplished a mean of 13 months after operation in 10 patients, aged 22 +/- 6 months. Multiple endocardial sites were measured to find the earliest atrial electrical activity timed back from the QRS complex. These data were compared with data from endocardial mapping performed in 6 patients late after the Mustard procedure. In 8 of 10 patients who had undergone the Senning procedure, the earliest activation time, corresponding by definition to the origin of the intrinsic pacemaker, was located in the inferior medial portion of the superior limb of the systemic venous atrium. In the other 2 patients who had undergone the Senning procedure, the earliest activity was in the high superior limb of the baffle at its junction with the superior vena cava. In contrast, the earliest activity in all patients who underwent the Mustard operation was at the junction of the superior vena cava and the superior limb of the systemic venous atrium. In response to programmed extrastimulation, the electrophysiologic behavior of the intrinsic pacemaker in the Senning group was abnormal compared with known normal sinus node (SN) data in only 3 of 10 patients, whereas all patients in the Mustard group had SN dysfunction. Abnormal SN function was noted in both patients in the Senning group, in whom a shift in the position of the earliest endocardial activation point was not seen.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The success of noninvasive preoperative evaluation of infants with congenital heart disease using cardiac ultrasound depends not only on diagnostic accuracy, but also on risk of morbidity and mortality as compared with infants who undergo cardiac catheterization. Fifty-six infants (age 10 weeks or younger) with coarctation of the aorta (n = 16), coarctation with ventricular septal defect (n = 12), valvar aortic stenosis (n = 10) or total anomalous pulmonary venous connection (n = 18) were examined. Thirty-one underwent noninvasive preoperative assessment and 25 underwent evaluation including cardiac catheterization. Age, level and duration of support, pH, renal function, mortality, complications of cardiac catheterization and errors of diagnosis were compared. Significant differences between the 2 groups were more frequent preoperative use of prostaglandin E1 and shorter hospital stay in the noninvasively evaluated coarctation group. Of the infants with coarctation and ventricular septal defect, 1 who had cardiac catheterization required renal transplantation and 1 evaluated noninvasively required surgery at age 3 months for mitral stenosis not discovered on preoperative evaluation. One noninvasively evaluated infant with total anomalous pulmonary venous connection had a stenotic communication between the pulmonary venous confluence and the left atrium not detected by ultrasound. Surgery was successful in the latter 2 infants. Noninvasive preoperative diagnosis of some infants with congenital heart disease can be performed without increasing the risk of operative morbidity and mortality. Eliminating cardiac catheterization reduces hospital costs, decreases total numbers of catheterizations performed and influences the structure of training programs.\r"

Patients were separated into 2 groups: Group A included 19 patients who underwent MRI after arteriography for comparison purposes and were evaluated retrospectively. Surgical confirmation was obtained in 9 of these patients. Group B included 22 patients who were studied prospectively because of abnormal chest x-ray, ultrasound or computerized tomographic findings and did not undergo arteriography before MRI. Two patients from this group had surgery. In group A, MRI correlated with the surgical or angiographic findings in 18 of 19 patients (95%). In group B, MRI was considered of diagnostic quality in all patients and no other invasive or noninvasive imaging modalities were needed for diagnosis and treatment. Thus, MRI will replace arteriography in a large proportion of patients with suspected thoracic aortic lesions.\r"

M-mode echograms were analyzed for early and late diastolic mitral leaflet separations, their ratio and E-F slope. Pulsed Doppler transmitral flow was analyzed for early and late velocities, their ratio and early flow deceleration. Early diastolic mitral valve leaflet separation was reduced in patients with hypertension (at 28 +/- 5 mm [p less than 0.05] ) and in patients with cardiomyopathy (at 22 +/- 3 mm [p less than 0.01] ). Flow velocity was also reduced in patients with hypertension (at 52 +/- 11 cm/s [p less than 0.05] ) and in patients with cardiomyopathy (at 48 +/- 15 cm/s [p less than 0.01] ). However, early leaflet separation and flow velocity were not related (r = 0.26). Late diastolic leaflet separation was similar (at 25 +/- 5 mm) in normal subjects and in those with hypertension (at 23 +/- 6 mm), but was reduced in patients with cardiomyopathy (at 18 +/- 3 mm [p less than 0.01] ). In contrast, late flow velocity was increased in patients with hypertension (at 52 +/- 12 cm/s [p less than 0.05] ) but unchanged in patients with cardiomyopathy (at 42 +/- 16 cm/s). The ratio of early to late leaflet separation was similar in all groups, whereas the ratio of flow velocities was reduced in hypertensive patients. Neither the E-F slope not early flow deceleration was altered in either pathologic group. Thus, hypertension and cardiomyopathy had similar effects in early rather than late diastole.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Enoximone is a new cardiotonic agent, active by both intravenous and oral routes of administration, that is being studied clinically for the treatment of patients with congestive heart failure. The animal pharmacology pertinent to the clinical development of enoximone is reviewed. Direct positive inotropic, positive chronotropic and vasodilator properties have been demonstrated for enoximone in several in vivo and in vitro preparations. However, positive inotropism and vasodilation are the principal effects of this agent with the inotropic effect being the most prominent. In anesthetized dogs, the cardiovascular effects produced by enoximone (0.1 to 1 mg/kg) were not accompanied by significant alterations in myocardial oxygen consumption. Cardiac function was improved by enoximone in anesthetized dogs given myocardial depressant amounts of propranolol. Studies in vivo and in vitro have indicated that the actions of enoximone are direct and not mediated by stimulation of adrenergic receptors, histaminic receptors, cholinergic receptors, Ca++-adenosine triphosphatase, Mg++-adenosine triphosphatase, adenyl cyclase or inhibition of Na+, K+-adenosine triphosphatase. However, enoximone reversed the depressant effects of verapamil in the dog heart-lung preparation; this suggests that its action resulted in the activation of slow calcium channels. Enoximone was found to be potent and highly selective inhibitor of a high affinity cyclic adenosine monophosphate-phosphodiesterase type IV-phosphodiesterase from dog heart, whereas standard inhibitors (e.g., 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine and papaverine) inhibit all 3 cardiac phosphodiesterases. Further, enoximone produced an increase in cyclic adenosine monophosphate, but not cyclic guanosine monophosphate, in the isolated, blood perfused dog papillary muscle during the peak inotropic effect.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The relative contributions of positive inotropy and vasodilation to the improvement in pump performance, however, remain uncertain. Therefore, findings from a series of dog experiments designed to resolve this issue are reviewed. Also, our current understanding of the physiologic response to enoximone in patients with cardiac failure, including the responses of myocardial oxygen consumption and efficiency, are considered. It is concluded that, enoximone produces a substantial (66 +/- 2% in dogs) increase in contractility, a relatively minor increase in heart rate (0 to 12%) and a decrease in systemic vascular resistance (-28 to -49%). These are the ranges of average responses based on review of published findings. These physiologic responses lead to an improvement in the pumping function of the failing heart; cardiac output (23 to 83%) and stroke work index (17 to 88%) are increased, and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (-19 to -59%) and right atrial pressure (-29 to -60%) are decreased. The influence of enoximone on myocardial oxygen consumption is less consistent (-18 to +33%). Nevertheless, enoximone improves the efficiency of the failing heart.\r"

In all animal species investigated (rat, dog, monkey and man), the major urinary metabolite is the sulfide oxidation product (sulfoxide); very little unchanged drug appears in urine. Both in vitro and in vivo animal studies indicate reversibility of the sulfoxidation reaction; therefore, it is presumed that sulfoxidation is reversible in man. In normal healthy subjects, no difference in extent of absorption due to dietary state is observed. In patients with New York Heart Association class III to IV CHF, median terminal disposition half-lives for enoximone and its sulfoxide metabolite are 6.2 to 7.6 hours, respectively. Enoximone and sulfoxide plasma concentrations from high dose intravenous infusion studies in patients with class III to IV CHF were also investigated. The collective data suggest nonlinearity in one or more pharmacokinetic processes, of which one may be saturation of sulfoxidation. No direct relation between enoximone and/or the sulfoxide metabolite plasma concentration and pharmacologic effect has been established.\r"

In clinical terms, cardiac failure may be described in terms of its chronicity or the extent to which signs and symptoms of right- versus left-sided heart failure are dominant. Congestive heart failure is a clinical syndrome that consists of a constellation of signs and symptoms that arise from congested organs and hypoperfused tissues. Acute cardiac failure occurs because of a decrease in myocardial contractility that can be offset by the Frank-Starling mechanism. In chronic cardiac failure dilatation and myocardial hypertrophy serve to restore ventricular function. Other compensatory responses that are invoked include a salt avid kidney, which mediates an expansion of the intravascular space, and the activation of the adrenergic nervous and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone systems and an increase in circulating arginine vasopressin. The management of acute and chronic cardiac failure can be derived from an understanding of the pathophysiologic mechanisms responsible for their appearance and include improving cardiac performance, as well as the distribution of systemic blood flow to tissues based on physiologic priorities and moment to moment variations in O2 requirements.\r"

Left ventricular dP/dt increases, despite a decrease in arterial pressure and systemic vascular resistance and without any significant change in heart rate, indicating a positive inotropic effect. A marked decrease in systemic vascular resistance indicates that decreased left ventricular outflow resistance resulting from peripheral vasodilation also contributes to improvement in left ventricular function. In some patients, left ventricular end-diastolic volume increases despite a marked decrease in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, suggesting an improvement in apparent left ventricular compliance, which may also be contributory to improved left ventricular function.\r"

Control cardiac index was 1.9 +/- 0.5 liters/min/m2 and it increased significantly by 1 hour, with a peak effect at 2 hours to 2.4 +/- 0.4 liters/min/m2 (p less than 0.05). Similarly, wedge pressure, 22 +/- 8 mm Hg at control, decreased to 16 +/- 10 by 1 hour (p less than 0.05). Six of the 12 patients received 1 mg/kg of enoximone on day 1 and 2 mg/kg on day 2. The higher dose of enoximone caused no further improvement in cardiac performance but prolonged the salutary hemodynamic effect. Subsequently, 79 patients (18 in New York Heart Association class III and 61 in class IV) with CHF (ejection fraction 17 +/- 8%) were followed over a 3 year period; the average enoximone dose was 1.7 +/- 0.7 mg/kg 3 times daily. Improvement of at least 1 functional class occurred in 55 patients (70%) at 1 month, 27 patients (34%) at 6 months and 19 (24%) maintained their improvement for over 1 year. Enoximone was discontinued in 20 patients (25%); in 5 (6%) for adverse effects and in 13 patients because of no clinical benefit. Adverse effects occurred in 14 patients (18%); 6% of all patients required discontinuation of drug. Six month survival was 50%, 42% at 1 year and 30% at 2 years.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Out of six dams fed WG during both pregnancy and lactation and nursing a total of 48 pups on day 1 of lactation, only two pups were still alive on day 15 of lactation. In contrast, CM dams still were nursing 47 pups at this time. Differences in the weight and composition of mammary tissue were directionally similar to and consistent with pup viability. The data obtained confirm the importance of protein quality in the lactation diet and also demonstrate that deficits in mammary gland development occurring during pregnancy may not necessarily be overcome by a nutritionally adequate diet consumed during lactation.\r"

To characterize the feeding patterns of PWS children and test this hypothesis, we administered an appetite test to 10 PWS children and 9 obese control children. We also examined the effects of naloxone on eating behavior of the children with PWS. While initial rate of eating did not differ, the PWS group showed a much delayed satiety resulting in a longer period of food intake. No difference in food intake was observed with naloxone (1.6 mg im, 30 min before the feeding test) treatment as compared with saline treatment.\r"

The effect of curry powder on Fe absorption from a potato meal was assessed in 64 Indian housewives. Curry powder caused a significant though modest rise in Fe absorption in two of the studies (t = 2.716, p less than 0.05 and t = 3.126, p less than 0.025) but, in the third, the effect was noted only in the more Fe-depleted subjects. There was no enhancement of Fe absorption from a dhal soup of low-Fe bioavailability (t = 0.224, p greater than 0.1). The results of both the human and animal studies suggested that curry powder's overall mild enhancing effect on Fe absorption was due to its capacity to stimulate gastric acid secretion.\r"

Subjects were age 70.0-85.1 y, lived in their own homes, and ate self-selected diets. Mean daily intakes for Zn and Cu were 90 mumol and 13.4 mumol with mean negative balances of -16 and -1.1 mumol, respectively. Both balance values significantly differed from equilibrium (p less than 0.05). For Zn and Cu, respectively, mean concentrations were 11.3 and 22.1 mumol/L plasma, 103 and 19.4 mumol/L whole blood, and 98 and 8.7 pmol/10(6) leukocytes. The results for Zn and Cu balance and leukocyte concentrations were different from those obtained by us for healthy elderly people (Am J Clin Nutr 1984;40: 1096-120). A highly significant (r = 0.75, p less than 0.001) correlation was observed between zinc balance and leukocyte zinc concentrations.\r"

Mortality was twice as high in the periurban as in the rural areas due to an outbreak of measles. In a bivariate analysis the relationship between nutritional status indicators and mortality was confounded by the age dependence of both. Using Cox's regression technique, height-for-age but not weight-for-height was positively correlated with survival. The number of children in the household was a better discriminator for death from measles than was nutritional status. Long-term factors, probably of multiple social origin, are likely causes of both relatively short stature and high mortality.\r"

The authors' results showed that LN, tumor size, and tumor grade were themselves significant predictors of early recurrence and breast cancer death. Each unit increase in LN or MG increased the risk of death by a factor of 1.5 and 2.0, respectively. However, prediction of time to recurrence or death was considerably more accurate when those parameters were used in conjunction, rather than individually. E2R was also significant in predicting death. MG separated patients within a single LN group or E2R group into two subsets having clinically and statistically different prognoses. It was found that patients who had negative lymph nodes and whose tumors were MG1 had a better prognosis than those with MG2,3 tumors; in these latter patients recurrence and death patterns were similar to those of patients with MG1 tumors having one to three positive lymph nodes. Similarly, whereas patients with four or more positive lymph nodes had bad prognoses, those bearing MG1 tumors tended to behave more like those with MG2,3 tumors and having only one to three positive lymph nodes.\r"

  ".W": "The growth fraction (GF) of human breast adenocarcinomas was studied in order to determine whether it was influenced by certain biologic characteristics of the host and whether it was modulated by the tumor's steroid hormone receptor status. It was also examined whether steroid treatment in vitro stimulated tumor's GF. Thirty-five primary breast adenocarcinomas from patients ranging in age from 26 to 85 years were analyzed for size and estrogen receptor (E2R) and progesterone receptor (PR) status. One portion of each tumor was cultured in medium 199 under four different conditions: addition of insulin alone or with 17 beta-estradiol (E), progesterone (P), or a combination of both hormones (E + P). In six cases, a dose-response curve was established for E (10(-14) to 10(-12) mol/L) and P (10(-11) to 10(-9) mol/L). Tissues were exposed to a continuous pulse of 2.5 microCi/mL (3H)-thymidine for five days before fixation and processing for autoradiography. GF ranged from 0.0074 to 0.3852, median 0.0550, and it was arbitrarily classified as low GF, less than 0.0550; or high GF, equal or greater than 0.0550. GF was significantly higher in patients with lymph nodes free of metastatic tumor than in those with positive lymph nodes. Estradiol treatment at low doses increased GF in 40% of tumors, whereas high doses increased GF in 14%. Progesterone treatment increased GF in 30% of tumors treated with low doses and in 14% of those treated with high doses. Treatment with E + P markedly depressed the GF of 85% of the tumors. It was concluded that the GF of breast carcinomas showed a great variability, which seemed to be independent of host factors such as age, menopausal status, parity history, or smoking habits; a second conclusion was that breast tumors' GF was not stimulated by steroid hormone treatment in vitro, and its response did not correlate with their hormone receptor status.\r"

By immunohistochemical methods, the authors compared a monoclonal antibody to NSE (Mab NSE) with a heterologous antiserum to NSE (Het NSE) on 348 samples of tumors of diverse histogenesis. They studied 93 neural and neuroendocrine tumors and 255 nonneuroendocrine, nonneural tumors. The Mab NSE was slightly less sensitive but clearly more specific than the Het NSE in recognizing neural and neuroendocrine differentiation. Only 2% of the nonneuroendocrine, nonneural tumors reacted positively with Mab NSE; in contrast, 20% of the same tumors were positive with the Het NSE. Moreover, intense nonspecific staining was frequent with Het NSE, which often rendered interpretation difficult. Because of its superior specificity, the Mab NSE used in this study is more valuable than the heterologous antiserum as a diagnostic reagent in tumor diagnosis.\r"

Multiple endocrine neoplasia type I (MEN-I) was present in both patients, although symptomatically latent in case 2. Immunohistochemistry showed that glucagon (A) cells were a major cell population (i.e., accounting for at least 30% of the tumor cell population) in 24 of 43 tumors (either macroadenomas or microadenomas) studied in case 1 and in 12 of 17 tumors studied in case 2. A major pancreatic polypeptide (PP) cell population was found in 12 and 7 tumors of case 1 and 2, respectively. In contrast, insulin (B) and somatostatin (D) cells were scarce in most adenomas. Gastrin-producing cells were not identified in any tumors, despite the use of different antigastrin antisera. Extrapancreatic or residual gastrinomas were not found at postmortem examination in case 1 or on appropriate surgical inspection done 24 years after the onset of the ulcer disease in patient 2. On the basis of these and of 17 additional cases collected in the literature, it is concluded that multiple A-cell tumors of the pancreas are an expression of the MEN-I and are mostly associated with ulcer disease and/or with hypergastrinemia of frequent uncertain origin. The mechanisms regulating the nonrandom phenotypic hormonal differentiation of these genetically determined tumors remain unknown.\r"

The parameters evaluated included the absolute neutrophil count, the lobularity index, and the left shift flag from the H-1, the percentage of high peroxidase cells from the H6000, the routine laboratory band count, and a reference band count. Significant intercorrelations were observed between these parameters. The diagnostic performance of the routine laboratory band count was significantly inferior to that of all other parameters. At equivalent points on their receiver operating characteristic curves, the diagnostic efficiencies of the remaining tests ranged from 61.5% for the lobularity index to 67% for the left shift flag and the percentage of high peroxidase cells. These differences were not significant statistically.\r"

Synthetic substrate assays for antithrombin-III are the methods of choice; however, most existing assay systems are semiautomated. A fully automated, antithrombin-III assay using the Kabi Chromogenic Synthetic Substrate S-2238 COATEST on the MULTISTAT III has been developed. This assay was compared with the Dade Protopath fluorometric assay. The correlation (r-sq) between the two assay systems was 0.82. Additionally, a three-way assay comparison was also performed, incorporating a new fluorometric substrate for antithrombin-III. The three-way comparative assays revealed correlation as follows: MULTISTAT III fluorometric assay and the MULTISTAT III/Kabi COATEST assay r-sq = 0.90; MULTISTAT III fluorometric assay and the Dade fluorometric assay r-sq = 0.86; and the MULTISTAT III/Kabi COATEST assay and the Dade Protopath fluorometric assay r-sq = 0.95. These automated assays were extremely cost effective and were a fraction of the cost of performing other types of antithrombin-III assays.\r"

Low titer and/or avidity with anti-lambda antibody from three of seven suppliers prevented or complicated interpretation of IEP patterns with two of four known lambda paraprotein-containing specimens but had no such effect with IFE. In view of these and various additional technical considerations, the authors suggest IFE for the routine characterization of paraproteins in the serum or urine.\r"

The anomalies included ambiguous genitalia, lack of perineal openings, and mullerian and urinary tract anomalies. Each patient had normal female chromosomes and normal adrenal gland function. We believe that this combination of anomalies represents a recognizable and specific sequence that is due to a failure of migration to and/or fusion of the urorectal septum with the cloacal membrane. This, in turn, we postulate, leads to persistence of the cloaca and cloacal membrane and failure of normal differentiation of the external genitalia. Persistence of the cloacal membrane results in absence of the urethral and vaginal openings and an imperforate anus. We propose calling this entity the urorectal septum malformation sequence.\r"

All the children tolerated the vaccine well; no reactions occurred that contraindicated further immunization. Older children had significantly more local (redness or swelling) and systemic (fever or fretfulness) reactions than younger children. Eighty percent to 90% of the children in the two older age groups had fourfold or greater increases in antibody titers to DTP antigens one month after vaccination. The postvaccine concentrations of antibody to tetanus and diphtheria were greater than 0.01 IU/mL in all children. Serologic responses to lymphocytosis promoting factor and filamentous hemagglutinin varied with age; significantly more older children than younger children had four-fold or greater increases. Acellular pertussis DTP vaccine was antigenic in young children and was less reactogenic than standard whole cell DTP vaccine according to rates reported in previous studies.\r"

All children under the age of 15 years evaluated in the monitored emergency rooms after involvement in a motor vehicle crash were included. The years 1981 and 1982 constituted the prelaw period; 1983 and 1984, the postlaw period. Those children 4 years of age or older, namely, those who were not covered by the child safety law, were the control population. The major findings for children less than 4 years of age were that (1) restraint use increased from 26% in the prelaw period to 50% in the postlaw period; (2) a significant decrease in the number of injured was documented; (3) head injuries decreased by 17%; and (4) hospital emergency room utilization did not decrease.\r"

This study describes 2082 calls received by Tucson's KIDLINE and 2208 calls received by Baltimore's KIDSLINE. The mean age of the callers was 9.7 years, with twice as many girls as boys calling. Loneliness or boredom accounted for 68% of the calls, with fewer calls for help with homework (8%), interpersonal problems (6%), medical problems (3%), and fears (2%). Medical calls were mostly for minor infectious illness; there were no calls for life-threatening emergencies. We discuss the possible implications for pediatric practice.\r"

Mean gestational age was 28 weeks (range, 26 to 33 weeks) and mean birth weight was 1110 g (range, 680 to 2000 g). After discharge, infants were monitored monthly to maintain transcutaneous oxygen tension over 55 mm Hg and/or pulse oximeter oxygen saturation over 92%. With appropriate home oxygen, all 22 infants grew as well as healthy, full-term infants (mean, 40th percentile; range, tenth to 80th percentile) when ages were corrected for prematurity. Parents discontinued oxygen therapy inappropriately in seven infants, and all seven experienced significant deceleration in weight gain. When home oxygen therapy was resumed, their weight gain improved, but the infants never regained their original percentiles during the study period. The 15 infants who continued home oxygen therapy maintained their original weight percentiles throughout the study period. These data support an important role for home nasal cannula oxygen in promoting weight gain in selected infants with BPD.\r"

Those infants who received phenobarbital did not require ventilatory assistance for more days than did placebo receivers. However, a pneumothorax or pulmonary interstitial emphysema was more likely to develop in infants who received phenobarbital than in infants who received placebo, even when adjustment was made for the presence of subependymal-intraventricular hemorrhage. We believe this is the first report of this relationship and recommend additional studies to test the hypothesis that phenobarbital contributes to the occurrence/recognition of pneumothorax or pulmonary interstitial emphysema in very-low-birth-weight infants if phenobarbital continues to be used routinely as prophylaxis or treatment.\r"

  ".W": "A statistical analysis of parental age and the incidence of new mutation has been performed. Some new data on Apert, Crouzon, and Pfeiffer syndromes is presented and combined with all available data from the literature on parental age and new mutation. Significant heterogeneity among syndromes for the rate of increase in incidence with parental age was found. A parsimonious conclusion is that mutations fall into two groups, one with a high rate of increase with age and the other with a low rate of increase with age. For the high-rate-of-increase group, a linear model relating incidence to age is rejected, while an exponential model is not. In addition, for this group, increased paternal age cannot account for the observed increase in maternal age--that is, increased maternal age also contributes to the incidence of new mutations. For the low-rate-of-increase group, increased paternal age alone can account for the observed increase in maternal ages; also, either a linear or exponential model is acceptable. In addition, there is no evidence for a mixture of parental age-independent cases with parental age-dependent cases for any of the syndromes examined. The curves reflecting incidence of new mutation and paternal age for two syndromes, Apert and neurofibromatosis, have an anomalous shape. In both cases the curve increases up to age 37 and drops at age 42 before increasing again at age 47. The usual explanation for the effect of parental age on new mutations is the mechanism of \"copy-error\" at mitotic division in male sperone that specifies an increased probability of mutation with time spent by a spermatozoon or ovum in a haploid state, a period of time that may also increase with age of the parent. A firm answer to the question of parental age and new mutation awaits identification of the molecular defect underlying some of these syndromes; we will then be in a position to determine in which parent the mutation occurred and at what age it did so.\r"

The probands were identified as having their first febrile convulsion while residents of Rochester, MN, during the years 1935-64. Parents and first- and second-degree relatives of probands were identified through the Olmsted County, MN, record-linkage system. Diagnoses of convulsive activity were made from review of medical records. The genetic models investigated included both single-major-locus and polygenic models, with likelihoods computed jointly on children and parents as well as being conditioned on parental phenotype. Possible heterogeneity was investigated by means of analyses of frequency of febrile convulsions in the proband. Analyses of the entire data set indicated that the single-major-locus models could be rejected. The most parsimonious model for these data was the pure polygenic (or common familial environment) model with a large heritable component (68% +/- 7%). However, when families were partitioned on the basis of frequency of febrile convulsions in the proband, significant heterogeneity was present. Our results indicated that the polygenic model was strongly corroborated in families of probands with a single febrile convulsion. In families of probands with multiple febrile convulsions, evidence was consistent with a single-major-locus model with nearly dominant seizure susceptibility.\r"

The present study was designed to reassess the accuracy of this method and to determine whether measuring the cystine content of purified polymorphonuclear leukocytes would improve heterozygote detection. Blood samples were obtained from 29 obligate heterozygotes for nephropathic cystinosis, one obligate heterozygote for benign cystinosis, and 18 individuals presumed to be normal. When the cystine content of mixed-leukocyte preparations was measured, three heterozygote values overlapped the normal range. When polymorphonuclear-leukocyte cystine content was measured, no heterozygote values were within the normal range. Measurement of the cystine content of purified preparations of polymorphonuclear leukocytes affords a simple method that improves the sensitivity of heterozygote detection for cystinosis.\r"

However, diagnoses of depression defined by current diagnostic criteria may not be more common in patients receiving beta-blockers than in patients with the same medical disorder receiving other medications. Seventy-seven patients undergoing elective cardiac catheterization for evaluation of chest pain received a semi-structured diagnostic psychiatric interview. Twenty-one percent of the patients receiving beta-blockers and 33 percent of the patients receiving medications other than beta-blockers met the current American Psychiatric Association criteria for major depressive disorder (DSM-III) (p = NS). The mean heart rate and state anxiety scores for patients taking beta-blockers were significantly lower than those measured in patients taking medications other than beta-blockers. No other medical or demographic differences were observed between the two groups. Despite the methodologic limitations of the study, there does not appear to be a difference in the point prevalence of depression between patients receiving beta-blockers and those receiving other medications.\r"

In normoglyceridemic patients, plasma concentrations of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and total cholesterol are closely linked, and for this reason resin treatment of elevated total cholesterol levels in these patients is rational and warranted. Hypertriglyceridemic patients may also have elevated total cholesterol concentrations, and several such patients have been treated with resin. However, resin therapy in these patients is hazardous, since the elevated cholesterol level mainly results from increased plasma concentrations of very-low-density lipoproteins or chylomicrons rather than low-density lipoproteins. In these patients, resin treatment has either no effect or an adverse effect on plasma triglyceride and cholesterol concentrations. The data presented show that fewer than 5 percent of patients whose total plasma triglyceride concentration exceeded 500 mg/dl had elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations, irrespective of total plasma cholesterol concentrations, and no patient whose plasma triglyceride concentration exceeded 1,000 mg/dl had elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. Treatment with bile acid binding resins in hypercholesterolemic patients is contraindicated in the presence of hypertriglyceridemia.\r"

  ".U": "87296070\r", 
  ".W": "The long-term effects of fructose as a natural sweetener in the physiologic meals of ambulatory obese patients with type II diabetes remain uncertain. An outpatient 12-week study was therefore conducted to evaluate the metabolic effects of crystalline fructose (60 g) supplementation of the diet of nine patients with type II diabetes (Group A, mean age 57 +/- 2 years, seven women and two men). Their results were compared with age-, sex-, and weight-matched patients with type II diabetes who were similarly studied but without fructose supplementation of their usual meals (Group B). The mean +/- SEM fasting serum glucose (224 +/- 24 versus 204 +/- 14 mg/dl) and glycosylated hemoglobin (11.57 +/- 0.49 versus 10.20 +/- 0.60 percent) values progressively decreased (p less than 0.05, week 12 versus week 0) in Group A. In contrast, both parameters increased in Group B when compared with the week 0 values, but differences were not statistically significant. Levels of fasting serum triglycerides, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol remained unchanged at week 12 compared with week 0 in Group A. However, the mean apoprotein A1 concentrations increased significantly at weeks 4 and 12 in Group A, whereas only transient changes occurred in apoprotein B100 values. Levels of mean fasting serum triglycerides increased at weeks 4 (15 percent) and 12 (38 percent) in Group B; however, no significant changes occurred in the rest of the lipid, lipoprotein, and apoprotein A1 and B100 levels. Metabolic by-products of fructose such as serum lactic acid and uric acid levels remained essentially unchanged in both groups at the end of the study. In addition, no significant weight changes were observed in either group. The fructose supplementation was well tolerated without significant adverse effects. Thus, this study demonstrates that addition of moderate amounts of fructose as a natural sweetener in the physiologic mixed meal does not appear to have deleterious effects on glycemic control and lipid and lipoprotein metabolism in ambulatory obese patients with type II diabetes and poor metabolic control. Rather, a slight improvement in glycemic control and alterations in the apoprotein compositions in favor of decreased risk for coronary artery disease may occur.\r"

Serum angiotensin converting enzyme activity and thyroid hormone levels, determined in 79 patients with intrahepatic-type liver disease and 18 patients with extrahepatic biliary obstruction, were compared with values in 129 euthyroid controls. Serum angiotensin converting enzyme activity was higher in intrahepatic disease than in extrahepatic obstruction, but statistically significant only for acute intrahepatic disease. In the patients studied, high serum angiotensin converting enzyme activity (22 units/ml or more) virtually excluded extrahepatic biliary obstruction, with a negative predictive value of 94 percent. Low serum angiotensin converting enzyme activity had a positive predictive value for extrahepatic obstruction of only 67 percent. Increased angiotensin converting enzyme activity could not be explained as a function of enhanced thyroid activity. Serum angiotensin converting enzyme activity may be useful in separating patients with intrahepatic liver disease from those with extrahepatic obstruction.\r"

In this study, urine from healthy women was analyzed for DLIS during pregnancy and following delivery, and levels were related to various clinical and urinary findings. Urinary DLIS increased progressively during pregnancy, having a linear relation to gestational week (DLIS = 0.032 week + 0.46, Syx = 0.52, r = 0.46, p less than 0.01), and fell to nonpregnant values during the first postpartum day. The urinary DLIS level correlated with urinary creatinine (r = 0.50, p less than 0.01) and urinary calcium (r = 0.56, p less than 0.01) levels. When adjusted for the gestational week, the urinary DLIS level also correlated with urinary potassium (r = 0.48, p less than 0.01), creatinine (r = 0.55, p less than 0.01), and magnesium (r = 0.55, p less than 0.01) levels. After adjustment for the urinary creatinine level, only the relation of urinary DLIS and urinary calcium levels remained significant (r = 0.44, p less than 0.05). The urinary DLIS level was not found to be related to systemic blood pressure. The ratios of sodium to potassium (r = -0.43, p less than 0.05) and calcium to magnesium (r = 0.37, p less than 0.05) were also related to gestational week but were independent of the urinary DLIS level. Thus, urinary DLIS increases progressively during pregnancy and falls to nonpregnant values on the first postpartum day, the urinary DLIS level can be related to urinary creatinine, urinary potassium, and urinary magnesium levels, and when adjusted for the urinary creatinine level, the urinary calcium level relates independently to the urinary DLIS level.\r"

It was hypothesized that patients admitted more recently would be older, more chronically and catastrophically ill, and more likely to have multiple illnesses than patients of an earlier era. Over time, length of stay and mortality rates decreased and acuteness of illness increased, whereas age, chronicity, and co-morbidity remained constant. Changes in the prevalence of some common diseases reflected evolving medical and social influences on hospital use. Modern medical residents are exposed to more patients for a shorter time. They see more acute illness but less of the ongoing process of diagnosis and treatment. Awareness of such changes can help educators design residency programs that better prepare internists for practice.\r"

To explore whether this underuse is justified, decision analysis is developed to compare a trial of labor with elective repeat cesarean section. With the use of available probability estimates and outcome scoring based on a survey of perinatologists, decision analysis identifies trial of labor as superior to elective repeat cesarean section for both the mother and the neonate. Going beyond the simple comparisons of management options and outcomes, the ethical implications of such results are discussed in terms of \"utility ethics,\" \"informed consent,\" and \"universal equality.\" Such considerations suggest that there is a professional (ethical) responsibility to increase the application of trial of labor.\r"

A persistently low biophysical score (7 or less on two examinations 2 hours apart) in the presence of a nonreactive nonstress test and absence of fetal breathing was used as an indication for delivery. Measures of pregnancy outcome included the presence of amnionitis or neonatal infection. The outcome of pregnancy in this group of patients was compared with the outcomes of two historic groups: one managed conservatively (control group) and the other managed with amniocentesis on admission to the hospital (amniocentesis group). Infection outcome, maternal as well as neonatal, and low 5-minute Apgar scores were significantly less in the study than in the control group. The frequency of neonatal sepsis was significantly less in the study than in the amniocentesis group. These data suggest that management of premature rupture of the membranes with daily fetal biophysical profiles improves pregnancy outcome by reducing the incidence of maternal and neonatal infection.\r"

Fetal heart rate data were captured and analyzed by a programmed microcomputer for group mean 30-minute fetal heart rate baseline rates and variability and incidences and dimensions of fetal heart rate accelerations and decelerations. Both groups were similar for the maternal and perinatal data examined. The fetal heart rate parameters analyzed were similar within and between each group during each 30-minute testing segment. No episodes of sustained tachycardia or bradycardia were observed. Although 13 fetuses in each group exhibited variable or late decelerations, the incidence of decelerations was no different during periods of rest or ambulation. Maternal ambulation does not elicit abnormal fetal heart rate responses in most high-risk fetuses and may be an acceptable alternative to conventional nonstress test conditions.\r"

Two-dimensional and Doppler echocardiography were performed in utero and both infants had left atrial isomerism, atrioventricular canal defects, and severe hydrops in addition to heart block. Review of the recent literature identifies a subset of congenital heart block in which the mothers have no evidence for connective tissue disease, and the fetus or neonate has complex cardiac malformations and hydrops. The common features in these babies are atrioventricular canal defects and isomerism. No reports of congenital heart disease among the children of mothers with connective tissue disease fit this description. Our recent experience and literature review emphasize the previously known association between congenital heart block and congenital heart disease. This association is especially important in light of the poor prognosis for this group of fetuses and neonates.\r"

Twenty-eight women who were no more than 4 weeks post partum from a fetal death were interviewed while waiting to see their physicians at the fetal demise clinic at Los Angeles County Women's Hospital. It was found that women were less depressed after the loss if they already had children, if they did not blame themselves for the death, and if they received a picture of the infant or were allowed to see the infant. Women benefited from sympathy from the medical personnel and being kept informed of problems as they developed.\r"

Polymorphonuclear leukocyte chemotaxis was decreased significantly in pregnant women during the second (-20%) and third (-17%) trimesters and 1 to 3 months post partum (-18%), but not during the first trimester (-6%) compared with nonpregnant control subjects. The impairment in polymorphonuclear leukocyte chemotaxis appeared to be a cell-associated rather than a humoral defect. Polymorphonuclear leukocyte adherence was decreased significantly in pregnant women during the third trimester (-16%). These data may help explain the increased incidence of infection and amelioration of certain immunologically mediated illnesses during pregnancy.\r"

There was a twofold and fourfold increase in the risk for small for gestational age birth after one and two small for gestational age births, respectively. Although an intervening average for gestational age birth decreased the risk of recurrence, these women remained at increased risk over the general population. Given the history of a previous small for gestational age birth, perinatal risks and outcomes considered individually would not improve the prediction of recurrence. However, the significantly higher frequency of these variables, considered as a group, among mothers with recurrent small for gestational age birth suggests an association with underlying maternal disease, for example, chronic hypertension, substance use and abuse, more severe fetal-neonatal compromise, and recurrent small for gestational age birth. Recurrent small for gestational age birth should initiate a search for persistent, underlying maternal disease.\r"

Third-trimester anemia (hemoglobin less than 11.5 gm/dl or 115 gm/L) was detected in 13 (15%) women. Red blood cell zinc protoporphyrin was the only test that consistently demonstrated significantly different mean values between anemic and normal subgroups. The diagnostic sensitivity and predictive value of red blood cell zinc protoporphyrin for evaluating iron depletion and risk of anemia in pregnancy compared favorably to those of ferritin and transferrin saturation measurements. The operational simplicity and low cost of red blood cell zinc protoporphyrin measurements are additional characteristics that favor this procedure for office testing.\r"

We studied the effects of age, independent of pregnancy, by comparing serum hormone levels in two groups of nulliparous, premenopausal women aged 18 to 23 and 29 to 40 years. We found that increased age during reproductive life is accompanied by a significant rise in both basal and stimulated serum follicle-stimulating hormone levels. This was accompanied by an increase in the serum level of estradiol-17 beta and the urine levels of estradiol-17 beta and 17 beta-estradiol-17-glucosiduronate. The serum level of estrone sulfate decreased with age. Serum and urine levels of other estrogens were unchanged. The basal and stimulated levels of luteinizing hormone were also unchanged. There was a significant decrease in basal and stimulated serum prolactin levels. Serum levels of dehydroepiandrosterone and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate decreased with age, but serum testosterone was unchanged. It is concluded that significant age-related changes in the female hormonal environment occur during the reproductive years.\r"

Selectivity was confirmed by measurement of urinary 2,3-dinor-6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha, an index of prostacyclin biosynthesis. Coincident with a 97% inhibition of serum thromboxane B2, urinary 2,3-dinor-thromboxane B2 was almost completely inhibited and paralleled the recovery of platelet cyclooxygenase after withdrawal of aspirin. This study demonstrates that thromboxane biosynthesis is increased in pregnancy. The increase is mainly platelet derived and is consistent with increased platelet activation throughout pregnancy.\r"

These included 26 moderate drinkers, 30 heavy drinkers, and 29 alcoholic women. Studies of 28 pregnant women who denied the use of alcohol (138 samples) showed that pregnancy itself had no effect on gamma-glutamyl transferase and mean cell volume. However, gamma-glutamyl transferase was increased in 14.9%, 31.7% and 59.1% of the samples collected from moderate drinkers, heavy drinkers, and alcoholic women, respectively, and likewise mean cell volume was elevated in 10.8%, 17.2%, and 40.2%, respectively. Either gamma-glutamyl transferase or mean cell volume was high or both were high in 27.1% of the moderate drinkers, in 38.3% of the heavy drinkers, and in 76.3% of the alcoholic women. Fetal alcohol effects developed in 42 cases. Increased gamma-glutamyl transferase predicted fetal alcohol effects in 61.5%, with a relative risk of 2.51. Elevated mean cell volume predicted fetal alcohol effects in 40.9%, with a relative risk of 2.40. These results suggest that the assay of gamma-glutamyl transferase and mean cell volume can be valuable in monitoring pregnant women with recognized or suspected alcohol abuse.\r"

Cholesterol or low-density lipoprotein cholesterol was not used as a substrate. Chorion used pregnenolone, pregnenolone sulfate, and 20 alpha-dihydroprogesterone for progesterone synthesis. Decidua also used these three substrates but produced significantly less progesterone than chorion. Amnion used only 20 alpha-dihydroprogesterone as a substrate. Exogenous human chorionic gonadotropin or gonadotropin-releasing hormone or its analogues did not influence progesterone production by any of the tissues. There were several significant changes in substrate usage for progesterone synthesis by the tissues around the time of the onset of labor. Tissue concentrations of progesterone are approximately 4 ng/mg protein, and it appears that local production rates could completely account for this. These data are compatible with the hypothesis that local regulatory mechanisms may determine progesterone concentrations in fetal membrane tissues and that important changes may occur around the time of the onset of parturition.\r"

Postterm patients (884) were managed with amniotic fluid assessments and nonstress tests (including evaluation for variable and late decelerations) twice a week. There were no perinatal deaths or major neonatal morbidity. However, the antenatal testing sensitivity, specificity, negative, or positive predictive values were not improved by combining the two tests. Individually, amniotic fluid assessment was just as accurate a predictor of fetal well-being and was a significantly more sensitive test than the nonstress test. In addition, antenatal predictors of fetal distress and intrapartum signs of fetal distress were almost exclusively those reflective of umbilical cord compromise. These findings stress the importance of antenatal screening for signs of umbilical cord compromise as an early indication of potential fetal compromise. Although the results also suggest that amniotic fluid assessment is superior to the nonstress test, they do not conclusively support the use of amniotic fluid assessment as the sole parameter for postterm antenatal surveillance.\r"

Fetal blood was obtained either by percutaneous umbilical blood sampling (n = 13) or at delivery (n = 12). Three women received digoxin for fetal indications. Healthy control fetuses had significantly less digoxin-like immunoreactive substance measured (mean concentration below the limit of the assay sensitivity) than was found in ill fetuses whose mothers received digoxin (p less than 0.005). However, the fetal concentrations of immunoreactive digoxin in fetuses with a cardiac abnormality were similar whether the mother had (0.93 +/- 0.4 ng/ml) or had not (1.27 +/- 0.4 ng/ml) received digoxin (p = 0.1452). Although there was a significant negative correlation between digoxin concentration and gestational age (R = -0.5079, p less than 0.01), the youngest fetuses examined were generally the sickest. The correlation with gestational age was not significant if the normal control fetuses were excluded. One fetus with a cardiac tachyarrhythmia was examined during and after transplacental therapy. There was no change. It is possible that previously measured \"digoxin\" in \"treated\" fetuses represents digoxin-like immunoreactive substance and that only small amounts of maternally administered digoxin actually reach the ill fetus. Our findings suggest that a randomized trial of maternal digitalization for the treatment of fetal supraventricular tachycardia is essential prior to its acceptance as effective therapy.\r"

Since heat, an end product of metabolism, is dissipated from the fetal surface, we measured the heat flux from the fetal scalp and related it to the pH of fetal scalp blood, a measure of metabolism. In 25 human fetuses at risk of intrapartum hypoxia, after the membranes had ruptured and the cervix dilated to greater than 3 cm, we attached a heat flux transducer, a platelet of 2.5 cm diameter and 1 mm thickness, to the fetal scalp and recorded continuously the heat flux from then until delivery. We also obtained one sample of fetal scalp blood in all patients and two such samples in 13 patients for the analysis of pH. We found a significant correlation between heat flux measured immediately before the scalp blood sampling (presampling values) and the pH of fetal scalp blood (r = 0.736; n = 18 presampling values; p less than 0.001). Out of 13 fetuses with two scalp blood samples, the changes in the scalp heat flux paralleled changes in scalp blood pH in 11. We conclude that fetal scalp heat flux is related to the metabolic condition of the fetus. Measuring scalp heat flux during labor could be developed into a noninvasive method for a continuous and more direct assessment of the fetal metabolic rate.\r"

Term infants delivered before labor (repeat cesarean section) had the lowest seizure rate (less than 0.2%), and this was a significantly lower (four times) frequency than that seen in term infants delivered by primary cesarean section.

Birth and death certificates were obtained on all children, and inbreeding coefficients of child, mother, and father were computed by use of the path method of tracing common ancestors in a unique genealogic registry of Amish ancestors dating back to the 1700s. Multivariate analysis with linear and log linear models showed that a lower mean gestational age and a higher risk of prematurity (less than 37 weeks) and borderline maturity (37 to 38 weeks) were significantly associated with increased maternal inbreeding but not child or paternal inbreeding. On the other hand, a higher risk of intrauterine growth retardation (less than the tenth percentile in birth weight for gestational age) and mild intrauterine growth delay (tenth to twenty-fifth percentile) were associated with increased child inbreeding but not maternal or paternal inbreeding. The analysis suggests the presence of genetic heterogeneity in the etiology of prematurity and intrauterine growth retardation; while prematurity is mostly related to the maternal genotype, intrauterine growth retardation is related to the fetal genotype. The study reemphasizes the need for separating low birth weight into prematurity and intrauterine growth retardation in genetic and epidemiologic studies.\r"

With multiple stepwise regression analysis, the best-fit formulas were developed with one, two, three, four, and five parameters, respectively. The best results were obtained by combining measurements of all five parameters: biparietal diameter, head circumference, abdominal circumference, femur length, and thigh circumference. The mean error of this formula was 6%, the mean deviation 0.3%, and the SD 7.8%. These data suggest that the addition of thigh circumference to measurements of the head, abdomen, and femur length improves the accuracy of fetal weight estimates.\r"

We performed 34 experiments in 12 chronically cannulated fetal lambs between 103 and 137 days' gestation. All animals had normal blood gas and pH values. Infusion of arginine vasopressin increased mean arterial pressure 10.1 +/- 1.1 mm Hg and decreased heart rate 50 +/- 8 bpm. Fetal heart rate decreased similarly when arginine vasopressin was infused and the hypertensive response was blocked with nitroprusside or a selective vasoconstrictor antagonist.

Retinal glial cells (presumably Muller cells) were seen fragmenting the internal limiting lamina and migrating into the overlying vitreous by projecting long microvilli into the vitreous cavity. Anterior membranes (13 patients), particularly in active disease, were likely to contain vessels, whereas posterior membranes (five patients) were more often avascular and were composed of glial cells.\r"

They found evidence of a venular defect limited to the pancreas that is specific to the BB rat.

This was confirmed by electron microscopy, which also demonstrated endothelial cell swelling, platelet aggregation, and fibrin deposition. By 48 hours, a \"thromboangiitis\" had developed that persisted through 96 hours. In vitro pulmonary angiograms done at 60 and 96 hours showed multiple filling defects; it was possible to demonstrate that these defects corresponded to the \"thromboangiitis.\" These thrombotic lesions, which were not the result of embolization from indwelling lines, closely resembled vascular changes described in the adult respiratory distress syndrome.

Foam cells were the major constituent of nascent atherosclerotic lesions in pigeons fed a 0.5% cholesterol diet for either 5 or 10 weeks. Seventy-four percent of foam cell lipid from animals at 5 weeks was in cytoplasmic droplets. The remaining lipid appeared in secondary lysosomes. After 10 weeks of cholesterol feeding, lysosomal lipid accounted for 73% of the lipid volume. The lipid accumulation correlated with increases in both size and number of lysosomes. An average of 2.4 lysosomes per 10(4) cu mu of cytoplasm was observed at 5 weeks. This value doubled by 10 weeks. The average lysosome diameter also increased between 5 and 10 weeks from 2.2 mu to 5.75 mu. Concomitantly, the complexity of lysosomes increased from simple, spherical organelles at 5 weeks to complex, multichambered organelles at 10 weeks. In contrast, lipid storage within cytoplasmic lipid droplets did not change either in size or in number. These observations suggest that by 5 weeks lipid storage within cytoplasmic droplets was maximized, and continued increases in lipid stores occurred predominantly through lysosomal loading.\r"

  ".W": "Red blood cells bearing anti-mouse IgG antibody on their surface (immunoerythrocytes) may provide for local protection of endothelial cells from the action of hydrogen peroxide. Subconfluent cultures of human umbilical vein endothelial cells responded sharply to increasing concentrations of hydrogen peroxide. Permeabilization of cellular membrane occurred at doses of hydrogen peroxide of from 1 to 3 mM, and was assured by incorporation of trypan blue stain immediately after treatment. Latent damage of cells produced by much lower doses of hydrogen peroxide (0.2-0.4 mM) could be observed after 24-hour incubation of treated cells in the normal culture medium with no hydrogen peroxide. The apparently dead cells differed from intact cells in morphology, were poorly attached to the substrate, and were readily incorporated by trypan blue, thus permitting easy visualization. Immunoerythrocytes bound to the antigen-coated surface enzymatically decreased the concentration of hydrogen peroxide in their microenvironment at least fivefold with respect to the total hydrogen peroxide concentration. Erythrocytes deposited on a part of the endothelial monolayer locally protected it from the damage at hydrogen peroxide concentrations ranging from 0.4 to 1.2 mM. Localization of protected zones corresponded precisely to the geometry of the erythrocyte coating. Immunoerythrocytes targeted to the endothelial cells by means of mouse anti-endothelial antiserum did not impair their viability and protected the endothelium from being killed at 0.3-1.2 mM hydrogen peroxide. This approach might be useful for a cell selection in mixed cell populations. The problem of local protection of cells involved in the inflammation focus are discussed.\r"

  ".W": "Proteoheparan sulfate biosynthesis was studied in cultured bovine aortic endothelial cells by means of pulse and pulse-chase experiments and subcellular fractionations. Three proteoheparan sulfate species were found in the medium. The major species, which the authors have called HS I, appeared in the medium only after an initial lag period and was also found associated with the plasma membrane. The other two (HS II and HS III) appeared in small amounts in the medium at early time points. At later times these were not readily observed because the large amounts of HS I present in the medium. The major medium species, HS I, appeared to be composed of approximately four heparan sulfate chains of approximately 35,000 daltons and a core protein of approximately 55,000 daltons apparent molecular weight. HS I appeared to be homogeneous by gel filtration on Sepharose CL 2B and 6B and elution from DEAE Sephacel, electrophoresis on Nu-Sieve agarose, and CsCl density centrifugation. After digestion with heparinase the core protein appeared to be homogeneous by S-200 Sephacel chromatography. HS I was also found associated with plasma membrane fractions of the cultured bovine aortic endothelial cells, and antisera raised against it stained epithelial and endothelial cells in patterns consistent with a cell surface localization. Of the other two species found in the medium, one (HS II) also appeared to be a component of the cell layer. This species appeared to contain approximately four heparan sulfate chains of approximately 20,000 daltons apparent molecular weight. Antisera raised against a similar molecule produced by HR 9 cell cultures stained basement membranes intensely, supporting the subcellular matrix localization of this molecule. The third species (HS III) was detected in culture medium only and apparently contained two heparan sulfate chains of approximately 20,000 daltons apparent molecular weight. These results support the concept of multiple endothelial cell proteoheparan sulfate species which exhibit differences in structure and localization and possibly diverse specialized functions.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of extracellular matrix components on proteoheparan sulfate biosynthesis was studied for bovine aortic endothelial cells in tissue culture. When the cells were maintained on a variety of different purified components of the extracellular matrix, the cells expressed the same three species of proteoheparan sulfates as the cells cultured on tissue culture plastic (HS I, HS II, and HS III). However, the amounts of the three species recovered from the tissue culture medium were found to be dependent on the substrate on which the cells are grown as well as on other factors. In comparison with plastic, much less HS I was found in the medium of cells maintained on substrates containing diverse matrix molecules, whereas the amounts of HS II and HS III essentially remained the same. In contrast, when bovine aortic organ cultures were analyzed under pulsatile flow, marked differences in the profile of proteoheparan sulfate biosynthesis were observed: HS I was found exclusively associated with the plasma membrane of the endothelial cells; HS II was localized only to the subendothelial matrix; and HS III represented the only proteoheparan sulfate species in the medium. This distribution is consistent with polarized secretion and deposition into the subcellular matrix of HS III and retention of HS I in the plasma membrane in the organ culture situation, a biosynthetic phenotype which can only be approximated at best by maintaining the endothelial cells on a substrate other than plastic. When aortic media (devoid of endothelial cells) was placed in organ culture, no HS III could be detected, which suggested that the vascular endothelial cell is the major cell type responsible for its synthesis in organ culture. Thus, the extracellular matrix, depending upon its composition and organization, may play an important role in stabilizing cell polarity and thereby contribute to maintenance of the differentiated phenotype appropriate for the endothelial cell.\r"
