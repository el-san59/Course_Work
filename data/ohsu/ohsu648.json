In point prevalence surveys made in 1982-1983, 33.7% of the persons examined were infected with Plasmodium falciparum, P. vivax, or P. malariae. Of these, 72.9% were infected with P. falciparum. In a standard fluorescent antibody test, highest level responses were to P. falciparum, followed by P. malariae, P. vivax, and P. ovale. A strong correlation was found between results of the fluorescent antibody tests and those obtained in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using P. falciparum antigens. The failure of immune responses to eliminate these species of Plasmodium in this highly isolated population is discussed.\r"

Results were highly reproducible in replicate wells and in repeated experiments. Results with nifurtimox, ketoconazole, and formycin B, compounds known to have in vivo activity against T. cruzi, revealed that the ELISA technique was capable of detecting small dose-response variations in the rate of phagocytosis of different life cycle stages of T. cruzi by normal and activated mouse macrophages.\r"

Still considered by some an endpoint in reconstruction, we have found that the judicious application of newly described dental prosthetic materials can provide the patient with improved appearance and function associated with a fully restored mandible. Twelve patients who underwent vascularized bone grafting for mandibular reconstruction had adjunctive implantation to improve either dentition or to reconstruct the temporomandibular joint. Nine patients had dental implants to restore permanent stable dentition either by placement of the mandibular bone staple plate or osseointegrated implants. Three additional patients underwent placement of metallic condylar head prostheses placed on the vascularized bone graft at the time of transfer. These patients demonstrated good mastication and an excellent incisal opening which was maintained in the late postoperative period. Vascularized bone transfer for restoration of continuity of the mandible should not be considered an endpoint in and of itself. By using implantable dental devices to restore dentition and condylar head prostheses to improve both the aesthetic result and function of the mandible to complement the vascularized osteocutaneous flap, we can bring our patients closer to the goal of total rehabilitation. The majority of these patients would otherwise never have been offered a chance at restoration of dentition. All had beneficial effects with regard to mastication and the majority also had improved speech.\r"

Sensitivity and specificity of magnetic resonance imaging was 82 percent and 97 percent, respectively; the sensitivity and specificity of the other two modalities was 59 and 98 percent for subtraction scintigraphy and 73 and 98 percent for ultrasonography. The use of preoperative imaging facilitated surgical exploration, reduced operating time, and resulted in an increased number of successful operations. There were no negative explorations in this series as compared with 19 negative explorations (2.6 percent) in our prior experience with 720 operations.\r"

Only 10% of the patients were found to have manifest Raynaud's phenomenon. The incidence was thus the same as in the general population. In addition, Raynaud's phenomenon and the carpal tunnel syndrome were poorly correlated with respect to their preliminary symptom appearances. Consequently, the carpal tunnel syndrome can no longer be regarded as a disease underlying Raynaud's phenomenon.\r"

All the examined subjects were normotensive, without diabetes or cardiopathy; all have been smokers. The eight-week total protocol consisted of an initial two-week placebo run-in period followed by two active drug phases and a two-week placebo phase, according to a double-blind, randomized, crossover design. At the end of each two-week period, ankle-arm index (AAI) and, following exercise, onset of lower extremity discomfort time (ODT), duration of exercise (ET), decrease of ankle systolic pressure after test (APD), and recovery time (RT) were determined. Moreover, at rest, just after exercise, and after recovery, simultaneous common femoral artery velocity waves were recorded and analyzed by a quantitative approach to detect the peripheral vasomotor adjustments. None of the patients required the withdrawal of the active treatments. Compared with P, C significantly reduced APD and RT, and N reduced RT and AAI; furthermore N caused a significant decrease in ODT, whereas C showed a trend, although not statistically significant, to increase ODT. Neither active therapy modified ET. These results suggest that C and N have different short-term effects on peripheral circulation in COAD. During exercise, C induces hemodynamic improvement in the ischemic lower extremity probably by inhibition of the sympathetic system and consequent reduction in collateral vessel vasoconstriction.\r"

Significantly different flux increases were noted among the three groups during the first six minutes of heating. Healthy subjects showed an initial rapid increase, followed by an abrupt reduction influx through a probable myogenic autoregulatory microcirculatory control mechanism. In patients the flux increase was slow and continuous, well correlated with the distal perfusion pressure; autoregulatory control was diminished or absent. With less than 100 mmHg perfusion pressure the microvessels are probably constantly dilated through a reduced sympathetic vasoconstriction tone, and further autoregulatory mechanisms are impaired. Measuring of functional behavior of cutaneous microcirculation under low arterial inflow pressure could represent a method for sensitive diagnosis of arterial insufficiency.\r"

Each patient was studied by means of clinical (history, blood pressure in both upper limbs, phonoendoscopic auscultation at various levels) and noninvasive instrumental examinations (CW Doppler spectrum analysis). An apparently primitive cervical bruit corresponded to a lesion of the carotid bifurcation in 61% of the cases (positive predictive value) whereas a normal bifurcation was detected in 70% of the cases in which the cervical bruit was considered as secondary (negative predictive value); the diagnostic accuracy of the \"critical auscultation\" has a value therefore of 63%, with a sensitivity of 84% and a specificity of 40%. The results obtained in the different groups of patients (symptomatic or asymptomatic) were not significantly different (chi-square). Even though maintaining the value of a cervical bruit as a sign of carotid stenosis or occlusion and consequently confirming the importance of neck auscultation, the authors conclude that the critical auscultation as commonly performed is not capable of excluding the presence of a carotid lesion with sufficient reliability, even in totally asymptomatic patients.\r"

  ".W": "At present there is no absolute way to determine which patient will respond to immunotherapy and which will not. Even in treated patients who derive clinical benefit, there is no one \"best\" immunologic parameter to follow although the generation of allergen-specific IgG seems to correlate better with clinical improvement than the other parameters. Whether or not the measurement of allergen-specific IgG4 will prove to be a useful clinical parameter is still a controversial issue and is an area for active investigation. The reason that IgG4 becomes elevated selectively over time during immunotherapy is not clear nor is its function known in the immune response to allergen. It is of interest however that IgG4 does not fix complement and may therefore account for the absence of immune complex disease in patients treated over many years. The modification of allergens through denaturization so that they are less reactive with preformed IgG has resulted in potent preparations that induce a strong IgG response. These preparations permit flexibility in dosage and in frequency of administration as well as produce no greater side effects than aqueous extracts. While these preparations would be a decided advantage over existing extracts, recent information that is accumulating regarding T cell recognition of antigen opens the way for more precise targeting of our therapy. That is, determination of the antigenic epitopes that trigger helper T cells should permit the construction of peptides that can \"block\" T cell recognition and potentially lead to immunologic unresponsiveness.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In addition, patient and investigator subjective evaluations were used to compare the effectiveness of the test medications in controlling the nasal symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis. A total of 122 patients were enrolled in this 4-week trial. Each patient received one formulation of Rhinalar for 2 weeks and then crossed over to receive the alternate formulation for an additional 2 weeks. Eighteen patients withdrew from the trial prematurely. Ten patients were lost to follow-up and eight withdrew due to side effects and/or inadequate therapeutic response. Statistical comparisons of patient evaluations of nasal burning and stinging with the two formulations of Rhinalar showed a very significant difference in terms of severity (P less than .001), duration (P less than .001), and tolerability (P = .006) in favour of the new formulation. A reduction in severity of throat irritation with the new formulation was also shown to be statistically significant (P = .006). Nausea, headache, and other side effects including watery eyes, taste perversion, and runny nose were seldom reported with either test medication. Both formulations were shown to be equally effective in relieving the nasal symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis. The considerable reduction in nasal burning and stinging and throat irritation with the new formulation of Rhinalar was shown to enhance patient acceptability and may lead to better compliance.\r"

It is wise to consider other causes of abdominal pain in patients suspected of having appendicitis, so that unnecessary operation can be avoided. It is more important to suspect appendicitis in patients who appear to have nonsurgical conditions of the abdomen, so that the incidence of perforation can be minimized.\r"

Procedure mortality was 0.3 per cent (one fatal stroke), major morbidity 0.6 per cent (one non-fatal stroke and one stroke with resolution), and minor morbidity 2.1 percent. Eighteen per cent (60/328) of the CCAs demonstrated highly significant intracerebral pathology that materially affected choice of therapy. CCA was as valuable in evaluating patients with transient ischemic attack, 22 per cent (27/121), as prior stroke, 23 per cent (22/98). CCA is highly useful for the accurate evaluation of associated disease outside the carotid bifurcation, and is therefore essential for accurate delineation of intracerebral anatomy, pathology, and flow patterns. It may be performed with reasonable patient risk, provides information not available from, or of better quality than, real time ultrasound or intravenous digital subtraction angiography, and therefore is essential for the proper selection of procedures, if any is necessary, and the proper order of those procedures.\r"

Three family members had surgical repair of the congenital stricture. Surgical repair was unnecessary in one, for whom repeated dilatations alleviated the symptoms. Since there were no direct female descendants in this family, it is unknown whether this hereditary disease is carried by a sex-linked dominant gene. There are no reports in the literature of a familial tendency to congenital strictures of the esophagus, nor are there any reports of strictures in association with gastrointestinal leiomyoma and the later development of sarcomatous degeneration. The literature is reviewed, syndromes of leiomyoma of the esophagus and gastrointestinal tract are detailed, the particulars of the family tree and the patients are described, and the study is summarized.\r"

Multiple surgical procedures have been devised to deal with this problem. An effective technique involves the creation of a tracheostoma and closure of the larynx at the first or second tracheal ring. Laryngotracheal separation is relatively easy to perform and potentially reversible. Experience with this technique in six patients who required laryngeal separation for intractable aspiration is described. The procedure was successful in preventing aspiration and recurrent pneumonia associated with neurologic dysfunction, unresectable neoplasm, and conservation laryngeal surgery. One patient of one has had a successful reconstruction.\r"

During the years 1975 to 1985, 142 patients with cicatricial pemphigoid were seen at the Mayo Clinic. There were 93 women and 49 men; the age range was 21 to 92 years. Mucosal lesions occurred most often in the mucous membranes of the oral cavity and conjunctiva. Involvement of the pharynx, larynx, and esophagus was less common. Stenosis of the nasopharynx or larynx necessitated surgical repair in several persons and caused obstructive sleep apnea in two. The otolaryngologist can make an important contribution to the early recognition, diagnosis, and management of the complications of cicatricial pemphigoid.\r"

  ".W": "Since the establishment of a clinical program in liver transplantation in 1984, 162 liver transplants have been performed in 131 patients (78 adults, 53 children). The patient mortality rate while waiting for a suitable organ has been 8% for adults and only 4% for children (25-46% reported in the literature). The low pediatric mortality is a result of the use of reduced-size liver transplants. A total of 14 procedures have been performed in recipients whose clinical condition was deteriorating and for whom no full-size graft could be located. Of 14 children, 13 were less than 3 years of age. Patient survival is 50%, comparable to survival of high-risk recipients of full-size livers. Using reduced-size liver grafting in a transplant program can lower mortality for children awaiting a transplant by overcoming size disparity. Reduced-size liver grafting will allow more effective use of donor resources and provide a potential avenue of research for organ splitting and living related donation.\r"

  ".U": "89024859\r", 
  ".W": "With refinements in surgical techniques and increased clinical experience, there has been a resurgence of interest in vascularized pancreas transplantation. From December 1986 to April 1988, 30 whole-organ vascularized pancreas transplants with pancreatico duodenocystostomy were performed simultaneously with renal transplantation. The recipient population consisted of 20 men and ten women, with a mean age of 34.7 years (range of 25-53 years). The mean duration of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) was 22.6 years (range of 10-37 years). The mean pancreas preservation time was 8.7 hours (range 3-19 years). All patients were immediately insulin-independent. Simultaneous pancreas-kidney engraftment was performed to both iliac fossae via a lower midline incision (n = 28) or through a bilateral lower abdominal incision (n = 2). The mean operating time was 5.9 hours, and packed cell transfusion requirement was 1.3 units. The mean length of hospital stay was 27.4 days. Recipients averaged 2.3 admissions (1-7), with ten patients (34.4%) requiring only one hospital admission. Postoperative immunosuppression consisted of cyclosporine, prednisone, azathioprine, and Minnesota antilymphoblast globulin (MALG). A total of 49 episodes of rejection occurred in 26 patients. Actuarial patient survival rate at two years is 96.3%. The kidney and pancreas survival rates for the same time interval is 94.0% and 84.0%, respectively. Mean serum creatinine at present is 1.75 mg/dl. In conclusion, renal transplantation in concert with pancreas transplantation has a dramatic positive impact on pancreas allograft survival. Combined engraftment does not appear to jeopardize renal allograft functional survival. In view of these results, simultaneous pancreas-kidney transplantation appears to be the treatment of choice for Type I diabetic patients.\r"

This study tests the hypothesis that adrenergic beta blockade in burns could reduce myocardial work, lipolysis, and negative nitrogen balance without adversely affecting cardiac or metabolic function. Eighteen patients with burns of 70 +/- 3% total burn surface area (TBSA) (Mean +/- SEM), were studied after a 5-day infusion of 2 mg/Kg of intravenous (I.V.) propranolol infusion every 24 hours without their cardiac output or resting energy expenditure being adversely reduced. Heart rate, left ventricular work, and rate pressure product were significantly reduced by 20, 22, and 36%, respectively (P less than 0.05). Plasma glucose, free fatty acids, triglycerides, and insulin levels remained unchanged. The rate of urea production, however, was significantly increased by 54 +/- 12% in fasted patients, and to a much lesser 12 +/- 2% in fed patients. The marked decrease in myocardial work afforded by propranolol administration may be of clinical benefit in the treatment of large burns. Variations in drug dosage and feeding regimens will, however, need to be perfected to limit catabolic effects.\r"

  ".U": "89024865\r", 
  ".W": "A number of disease states and therapeutic maneuvers common to surgical patients can result in changes in the intestinal flora, permitting bacterial overgrowth and translocation of bacteria to gut lymphoid tissue. It is possible that these changes in gut flora increase portal levels of several factors that are capable of altering macrophage activation state, including endotoxin, lymphokines, and eicosanoids. Since Kupffer cells are directly exposed to gut factors via the portal circulation, changes in intestinal flora may influence Kupffer cell responses. Using germfree rats, it has previously been shown that the presence of gut bacterial flora is important in inducing Kupffer cells to respond to endotoxin, and that an overgrowth of gram-negative bacteria can further augment Kupffer cell responses, supporting the above-mentioned hypothesis. The current set of experiments examines how intestinal gram-negative bacterial overgrowth in normal adult rats effects the response of Kupffer cells to septic stimuli. Kupffer cells were obtained from conventional rats with induced intestinal overgrowth with Escherichia coli C25 for 2 or 7 days. After 2 days of overgrowth, Kupffer cells were only slightly less responsive to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) than control Kupffer cells. However, after 7 days of overgrowth, when placed in coculture with normal hepatocytes, Kupffer cells were significantly more responsive to LPS (p less than 0.001), inducing a greater degree of suppression in hepatocyte protein synthesis at lower LPS concentrations. When cultured alone, Kupffer cells from these animals also produced more interleukin-1 (p less than 0.002) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) (p less than 0.009) in response to LPS. These results show that intestinal gram-negative bacterial overgrowth in conventional rats can have direct influences on the response of hepatic macrophages to septic stimuli, and provides further support to the hypothesis that imbalances in the intestinal flora can effect the responses of immune cells in other sites of the body.\r"

From March, 1984, to August, 1987, 53 patients underwent orthotopic heart transplantation for terminal-stage heart disease at the Second Department of Surgery, University of Vienna. All patients received CyA in increasing dosage (3 mg/kg to 6-10 mg/kg) postoperatively according to renal function, obtaining a trough high-pressure liquid chromatographic whole-blood target level of 200 to 400 ng/ml at the end of the first week. CyA was subsequently tapered to 100 to 150 ng/ml after 6 months. From March, 1984, through April, 1986, maintenance immunosuppression was carried out with a double-drug regimen of CyA and azathioprine. Since May, 1986, a triple-drug schedule was applied with CyA, azathioprine, and prednisone. Under triple-drug therapy, the incidence of mild, moderate (p less than 0.0001), and severe (p = 0.05) allograft rejection proven by endomyocardial biopsy decreased significantly with a corresponding increase of absent (p less than 0.0001) rejection. Freedom from moderate, severe, and lethal graft rejection, number of rejection episodes per patient after 1 year (double drug, 1.0, versus triple drug, 2.5), and patient survival disclosed significant improvement for recipients of the triple-drug regimen. Both groups had the same incidence of infectious complications; freedom from death by infection after 1 year was 90% versus 91% (double versus triple drug, p = 0.20).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The tumor had been identified by radiographic examination and the diagnosis confirmed by cytological examination of the sputum.

Hypercapnia is a consistent indicator of high risk. There is no difference between spinal and general anesthesia with regard to risk of pulmonary complications. In patients being evaluated for lung resection, high-risk indicators include predicted postoperative forced expiratory volume in one second of less than 1000 mL, hypercapnia, severe dyspnea on exertion, or advanced age when it is associated with advanced cardiopulmonary disease. Newer methods of assessing cardiopulmonary reserve may prove useful in identifying which patients with one or more of these risk factors are suitable operative candidates. Prevention of postoperative complications in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients should begin in the preoperative period with discontinuation of smoking at least eight weeks before surgery and vigorous pulmonary toilet in the 48 to 72 hours before surgery. Prophylactic lung expansion maneuvers can be effective in decreasing the incidence of postoperative atelectasis in high-risk patients undergoing high-risk operations.\r"

Remarkably little methodologically sound research on this subject was found. However, available evidence suggests that C-DVT propagates to the thigh in up to 20% of cases and that propagation invariably occurs before embolization. No fatal emboli were reported in patients presenting with isolated C-DVT. Traditional anticoagulation treatment with heparin sodium and warfarin sodium of symptomatic patients with C-DVT appears to prevent extension, embolization, and early recurrence. There is no convincing evidence that C-DVT leads to chronic venous insufficiency or whether the risks of anticoagulation exceed the risks of no treatment. As an option to anticoagulation, physicians may choose to follow patients with C-DVT with serial impedance plethysmography, treating only if there is evidence of proximal extension.\r"

In an attempt to identify clinical clues that might increase specificity without compromising sensitivity of the intravenous pyelogram in acute pyelonephritis, only the fever curve was statistically useful. Confined to patients who were febrile through 72 hours of appropriate antibiotic treatment, the yield of urography in demonstrating anomalies of immediate clinical significance rose from 8% to 36%. The likelihood of an acutely important abnormality was also increased fivefold in both diabetic patients and patients with a urinary pathogen other than ampicillin-sensitive Escherichia coli, but small numbers precluded statistical significance. Bacteremia was common (27%), but not helpful other than in confirming the microbiological diagnosis. Nonacute structural abnormalities were present in 43% of the patients, three to nine times more frequently than in reported cases without upper tract infection.\r"

The subjects with a history of adult psychopathology (PATH group), in comparison with subjects with no history of a psychiatric disorder (NO PATH group), had poorer quality of childhood home life and personal adaptation subsequent to parental loss as assessed by the Home Life and Personal Adaptation (HAPA) scale developed by us. Total HAPA scale scores were the single most powerful predictor of adult psychopathology, accounting for correct prediction of adult psychopathology in 80% (72/90) of the subjects. The PATH subjects had significantly increased plasma levels of cortisol and beta-endorphin immunoreactivity. Moreover, cortisol and adrenocorticotropic hormone levels significantly correlated with total HAPA scores. First-degree family history of psychiatric disorders, age at loss, and parental vs maternal loss were not significantly different between PATH and NO PATH subjects. We conclude that the quality of home life subsequent to early parental loss is critically related to the development of adult psychopathology. The hypothesis that early trauma results in enduring neuroendocrine alterations in hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis function is examined.\r"

The role the type of lesion plays in atherosclerosis has been emphasized, especially in studies concerned with the progression and therapy of this disease process. From the variety of animals listed in this review, as well as the number of different problems already studied or awaiting further study, it appears that numerous data can be reconciled to help elucidate many problems and provide information for our better understanding of atherosclerosis.

  ".U": "89025041\r", 
  ".W": "Atherosclerosis affects the major elastic and muscular arteries, but some vessels are largely spared while others may be markedly diseased. The carotid bifurcation, the coronary arteries, the infrarenal abdominal aorta, and the vessels supplying the lower extremities are at highest risk. The propensity for plaque formation at bifurcations, branchings, and curvatures has led to conjectures that local mechanical factors such as wall shear stress and mural tensile stress potentiate atherogenesis. Recent studies of the human vessels at high risk, and of corresponding models, have provided quantitative evidence that plaques tend to occur where flow velocity and shear stress are reduced and flow departs from a laminar, unidirectional pattern. Such flow characteristics tend to increase the residence time of circulating particles in susceptible regions while particles are cleared rapidly from regions of relatively high wall shear stress and laminar unidirectional flow. The flow patterns associated with plaque localization are most prominent during systole. Long-term consequences are therefore likely to be greatly enhanced by elevated heart rate and may exert a selective effect on the coronary arteries. The point-by-point redistribution of wall tension at regions of geometric transition has not been quantitatively related to plaque localization. Enlargement of arteries as plaques increase in size and the associated modeling of plaque and wall configuration tend to preserve an adequate and regular lumen cross section. Hemodynamic forces appear to determine changes in vessel diameter so as to restore normal levels of wall shear stress, while wall thickness architecture, and composition are closely related to tensile stress. Hemodynamic forces may also be implicated in the symptom-producing destabilization of plaques, especially in relation to wall instabilities near stenoses. The relative roles of wall shear stress, tensile stress, and the metabolism of the artery wall in the progression and complication of atherosclerosis remain to be clarified. Development of clinical techniques for relating hemodynamic and tensile properties to plaque location, stenosis, and composition should permit pathologists to provide new insights into the bases for the topographic and individual differences in plaque progression and outcome.\r"

  ".W": "For decades, dietary cholesterol has been recognized as the \"materia peccans\" (Anitschkow) for the induction of atherosclerosis in animals. In rabbits, chickens, and monkeys, long-term feeding of small amounts of cholesterol leads to atherosclerosis despite little or no rise in serum total cholesterol, indicating an independent contribution of dietary cholesterol to atherogenesis over-and-above its influence on serum cholesterol, possibly through effects on serum cholesterol fractions (eg, increased low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol and decreased high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol). In humans, ingestion of dietary cholesterol raises serum cholesterol, largely through its effect on low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol. Over the range of intake in usual American diets, this effect is substantial, eg, with 300 mg of cholesterol intake per 1000 kcal, rather than 100, serum cholesterol is on average about 6% to 7% higher, equivalent to a 12% to 14% greater risk of coronary heart disease (CHD). In international studies based on the Food and Agriculture Organization and the World Health Organization (Geneva) data, mean per capita dietary cholesterol levels are consistently related to CHD mortality rates. In addition, since 1981, four prospective within-population studies have shown that dietary cholesterol intake of individuals is significantly related to their long-term CHD risk, independent of and in addition to serum cholesterol, blood pressure, and cigarette use. On average, a 200-mg/1000 kcal higher intake of cholesterol at baseline was associated with a 30% higher CHD rate (95% confidence interval, 1.1 to 1.5). Conversely, lower intakes of cholesterol were associated with significantly lower risks of CHD, and of all causes mortality as well. For example, with 19 years of follow-up in the Chicago Western Electric Study, a 200-mg/1000 kcal habitual lower cholesterol intake was associated with a 37% lower risk of death from any cause, equivalent to a life expectancy longer by 3.4 years. The importance of a low-dietary cholesterol intake for prevention of CHD merits increased emphasis.\r"

One such exception is cocoa butter, which is not as cholesterolemic or atherogenic for rabbits as would be expected from its level of saturation. The reason for this anomaly is believed to be the high level of stearic acid present in cocoa butter. Peanut oil is also anaomalous, being unexpectedly atherogenic for monkeys, rabbits, and rats. Randomization of peanut oil reduces its atherogenicity, suggesting that the structure of the triglyceride comprising peanut oil may affect its atherogenic potential. Another possibility is that a lectin present in peanut oil may be responsible for its atherogenic capacity.\r"

The high incidence of Lp(a) in the plasma of patients with cardiovascular disease has been noted by many investigators.

Particular consideration has been given to three features of apoprotein E involvement in lipid cell interactions. Evidence implicating free cholesterol as a mediator of apoprotein E biosynthesis in cholesterol-loaded macrophages is presented. Experiments pointing to apoprotein E as the ligand promoting the interaction of beta-very-low-density lipoprotein (beta-VLDL) with macrophages are summarized. Finally, we describe the influence of fat and cholesterol fed to rhesus monkeys and baboons on the generation of hepatogenous (from isolated liver perfusates) VLDL enriched in cholesterol ester and apoprotein E. These hepatic VLDLs, none of which exhibits beta-electrophoretic mobility, promote cholesterol esterification in macrophages in proportion to their apoprotein E content. The complex role of apoprotein E in the genesis and reversal of atherosclerosis is briefly discussed.\r"

  ".W": "In 1968, Professor Robert Wissler published a landmark review on the role of smooth muscle cells in atherogenesis. He suggested that in future studies more attention should be given to the cytologic and metabolic characteristics of these multifunctional mesenchymal cells. This article summarizes some of our studies inspired by these words and indicates a few of the many questions that still need to be addressed. We have shown that smooth muscle cells of different phenotypes from that expressed in normal arterial media exist in regions of diffuse intimal thickenings adjacent to atheroma and also in vessels following injury. Cells of equivalent phenotype can exist in cell culture, and we have shown that they have all the characteristics of smooth muscle in atherogenesis, ie, they proliferate in response to mitogens, readily synthesize increased amounts of extracellular matrix, and accumulate large amounts of lipid. In contrast, smooth muscle cells of the phenotype that normally exists in the unaffected artery do not express these characteristics and their major function is maintenance of vessel tone. Thus a deeper knowledge of the factors that control smooth muscle phenotype is essential to an understanding of the mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis.\r"

They were regarded as synthetic phenotype. In contrast, most medial SMCs had rich filaments and fewer organelles. They were regarded as contractile phenotype. When atherosclerotic intimal and normal medial SMCs were plated on type I collagen gel, cytoplasmic cyclic adenosine monophosphate concentration increased and DNA synthesis was suppressed. Intimal SMCs cultured on the gel showed contractile phenotype. Dibutyryl cyclic adenosine monophosphate added to culture media decreased DNA synthesis and altered cellular phenotype to a contractile state. Intimal SMCs were more resistant to injury by hyperlipidemic low-density liproprotein and homocysteine. Lysosomal enzyme activity was enhanced in intimal SMCs.\r"

This article reviews the development of our ideas concerning possible pathways other than lipids that might play a role in the development of human atherosclerosis alone or in combination with one or more of the usually considered risk factors. In some instances, such as that of cigarette smoking, the proposed concept regarding genetic alterations in vascular smooth muscle suggests a mechanism for development of at least some of the lesions. Recent studies have shown that an aberration in platelet-derived growth factor gene expression is unlikely to be a factor in proliferation of smooth-muscle cells. Aberrant expression of other oncogenes or some as yet unknown virus remain as possible explanations of some of the incidence of atherosclerosis and its consequent coronary heart disease.\r"

Oxygen consumption (measured with open circuit spirometry) and heart rate were measured during treadmill walking by 21 children, wheelchair use by eight children, and, for five children, in both modes. Speeds ranged from 27 to 134 m/min, with slopes up to 15%. Energy consumption for walking was linearly related to speed, slope, heart rate, and body weight (r = .90, p less than .001); for wheelchair propulsion, energy consumption was a linear function of speed, slope, and body weight (r = .90, p less than .001). The same linear function applied for all disabled children; maximum walk/run speed over a 30 m distance correlated highly with both maximal oxygen consumption (r = .87) and speed using 70% of VO2max (r = .82). For both wheelchair use and walking, the relative energy consumption (percentage of VO2max) was highly correlated with heart rate alone (r = .93), and the absolute level of energy consumption was highly correlated with heart rate and maximum walk/run speed (r = .89). Simple clinical measures of maximum ambulatory velocity and heart rate allow accurate prediction (r = .89) of energy consumption in all children with myelomeningocele, regardless of neurologic and functional level.\r"

These results indicate that early portoenterostomy is appropriate early therapy for biliary atresia; however, prompt referral to a liver transplant center for evaluation at the first sign of cholestasis is needed to attain optimal results for transplantation.

The five patients in the symptomatic group underwent operations for symptoms suggestive of biliary tract disease, with no gallbladder found; all were symptom free postoperatively. Operative strategy should include a complete exploration, operative cholangiography, and common bile duct exploration as necessary. Possible mechanisms responsible for symptoms include primary duct stones, biliary dyskinesia, or nonbiliary disorders. Computed tomography, biliary manometry, upper gastrointestinal tract endoscopy, and endoscopic cholangiography (with or without sphincterotomy) could be employed if symptoms continue.\r"

After a bolus dose (3.6 microCi), L(1-carbon 14) LEU (0.3 microCi/min) was infused directly into the isolated, constant-flow, in vivo gracilis muscle. Arteriovenous differences for amino acids, labeled and unlabeled LEU and alpha-ketoisocaproic acid (KIC), and labeled carbon dioxide were measured at ten-minute intervals for one hour. Bacteremia increased the net release of amino acids and total N2 from muscle. Moreover, plasma LEU that was deaminated and released as KIC was increased, and there was also an increase in decarboxylated plasma LEU during bacteremia. Despite the marked increase in KIC release from skeletal muscle during bacteremia, arterial concentrations were not significantly different from those of controls. An unchanged arterial plasma KIC concentration associated with a marked increase in KIC released from skeletal muscle indicates an increase in LEU metabolism, most likely in the liver. Thus, the increased skeletal muscle catabolism is not a futile cycle but rather an essential event to meet the increased metabolic needs of the body during bacteremia.\r"

A recently proposed classification of night blindness includes a complete type associated with myopia and an incomplete type in which both hyperopia and myopia were found. Complete and incomplete types did not occur within the same pedigree. We report on a family in which three of the five affected members had hyperopia and could be classified as the incomplete type and in which a fourth member with myopia was more consistent with the complete type. The lack of myopia in three members of our pedigree can be explained by two hypotheses: crossing over of the night blindness and myopic genes on the X-chromosome, or an autosomal dominant hyperopic gene that masks the myopic gene. The data from our family support the first of these two hypotheses.\r"

The patient was treated with hourly drops of autologous serum. A ringlike infiltrate was subsequently observed, followed by reepithelialization of the graft. The patient later suffered allograft rejection of the cornea and recurrence of the epithelial defect, and a repeated penetrating keratoplasty was performed. Examination of the excised button demonstrated a total epithelial defect, changes compatible with allograft rejection, and, in addition, eosinophilic granular deposits within the superficial corneal stroma that corresponded to the \"immune ring\" observed clinically. Immunoperoxidase staining was positive for IgG, IgM, IgA, and kappa and lambda light chains. These pathologic changes lend credence to the hypothesis that the precorneal tear film may be a source of immunoglobulin that becomes deposited within the stroma.\r"

A lateral orbitotomy approach to decompression of the optic nerve is appropriate for the ophthalmologist with adequate orbital experience. A rectangular window of dura and arachnoid, measuring approximately 3 X 5 mm, is excised from the bulbous portion of the optic nerve. It is important that the arachnoid within the window is excised because an intact arachnoid is an effective barrier to cerebrospinal fluid egress. The use of operating microscope, microsurgical instrument, and microdissecting techniques are emphasized. Twenty-eight patients (40 eyes) with progressive visual loss were treated by surgical nerve sheath fenestration. A study of the indications, results, and complications of this procedure is presented in a companion article.\r"

The risk and benefit of vagal maneuvers for treating PSVT in the emergency department (ED) is inadequately defined. The purpose of this study was to determine the efficacy of nonpharmacological vagal interventions in converting spontaneous episodes of PSVT in adult patients and to derive a treatment plan for such patients based on clinical decision analysis. Seventeen adult patients who presented to the ED because of PSVT were treated with carotid sinus massage, Valsalva maneuver, and head-down tilt (alone and in combination). Only three patients converted out of PSVT with vagal intervention. The remainder received verapamil, which converted 12 of the 14 patients (86%) who received the drug (one required digoxin, one required synchronized cardioversion). Vagal maneuvers are safe in young, otherwise healthy patients but problems have been documented in the literature in older patients, who have a higher likelihood of coronary and/or cerebrovascular disease. Clinical decision analysis indicates that young patients should be treated initially with vagal maneuvers but that older patients (above approximately 65 years of age) should be treated initially with verapamil.\r"

A case is presented of 3-year follow-up of a patient with an appendicolith and acute recurrent appendicitis. The literature about appendicoliths is reviewed. In the appropriate clinical setting, a history of prior episodes of similar right lower quadrant pain does not preclude the diagnosis of appendiceal disease.

The time required for this, especially if the patient is transferred to another institution, may lead to a significant delay in treatment. In a patient with an expanding intracranial hematoma and evidence of brainstem compromise this delay may produce a worse outcome. Cranial burr hole placement can rapidly, safely, and accurately find and partially decompress most extracerebral intracranial hematomas. A burr hole placed rapidly before CT and transfer could prevent further damage to the brain by an expanding hematoma. The case of a child with a preterminal epidural hematoma whose outcome was excellent because of a burr hole placed in the emergency department (ED) is presented. In light of this case and a complete literature review, it is suggested that more frequent attempts to decompress intracranial hematomas in the ED may be warranted.\r"

Reduction in pain intensity was significantly greater 2, 3 and 4 h after the use of nalbuphine 60 mg than following dihydrocodeine 30 mg, and the mean total pain intensity difference was greater following nalbuphine 60 mg than following dihydrocodeine. Nalbuphine 60 mg effectively provided complete or good pain relief in more than 50% of the patients and only three patients in this group required additional analgesia during the period of observation, compared with nine patients in each of the other groups. However, the patients who received nalbuphine 30 mg had a significantly higher mean pain intensity before treatment than those in the other groups.

A computerised scanning microdensitometer was applied on fundus photographs of retinal vessels, and we studied changes in calibres of the blood column (W0) and in width (Wr/W0) and intensity (Ir) of the central 'light reflex'. After six months of improved metabolic control the Ir was reduced in both MI and CSII cases compared with CIT cases (p less than 0.01), indicating haemorrheological changes in the retinas. Within these six months cotton-wool spots appeared in half the patients (n = 15) on CSII and MI, but not in CIT patients. Subjects who developed cotton-wool spots, compared with those who did not, had greater intensities of reflection and larger calibres of vessels at the start of the study (p less than 0.01). On intensifying the treatment they were characterised by a larger fall in hemoglobin A1 (p less than 0.01) and by a larger decrease in Ir on arteries (p less than 0.05) and veins (p less than 0.01). The behaviour of the retinal circulation is different in patients developing transient ischaemic lesions on intensified insulin treatment from its behaviour in those who do not.\r"

Because it can raise circulating levels of factor VIII coagulant activity (FVIII) and von Willebrand factor and shorten the prolonged bleeding time, DDAVP is established as a nontransfusional form of treatment for mild and moderate hemophilia and von Willebrand disease. Recently, DDAVP has also been purported to be useful for shortening the prolonged skin bleeding times that occur with uremia, cirrhosis, and platelet dysfunctions of various etiologies. Finally, there is evidence from controlled clinical trials that DDAVP can reduce blood loss and transfusion requirements for hemostatically normal individuals undergoing spinal fusion surgery and for patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass surgery. The purpose of this report is to review the therapeutic applications of DDAVP in congenital and acquired bleeding disorders and to discuss areas in which further basic and clinical research is needed.\r"

A monoclonal anti-G-CSF antibody blocked the induction of migration by G-CSF, thus establishing that the cytokine was responsible for the activity of the recombinant preparation. Checkerboard analysis was performed by seeding different concentrations of G-CSF above and/or below the filter and revealed that the migratory response to this cytokine was best observed in the presence of a positive concentration gradient between the lower and upper compartments of the chamber, thus indicating an actual chemotactic effect. When different migrating cells were examined, rhG-CSF was inactive on large granular lymphocytes and endothelial cells under conditions in which appropriate reference attractants were active. In contrast, rhG-CSF elicited a chemotactic response in monocytes inhibited by specific antibody. Thus, G-CSF is a chemotactic signal for phagocytes. This cytokine, when produced at inflammatory sites, may contribute to the recruitment of phagocytes from the blood compartment to amplify resistance against certain noxious agents.\r"

On immunofluorescence, the MoAbs reacted with 30% to 40% of the human erythroleukemia (HEL) cells. When the HEL cells were induced to spread on fibronectin in the presence of 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), the MoAbs reacted with the focal adhesion sites. Only some of the GPIIIa MoAbs reacted with cells other than platelets, megakaryocytes, or HEL cells, and these showed focal adhesion sites in cultured human endothelial cells, fibroblasts, and epithelial cells from normal kidney tubules. They did not react, however, with transformed fibroblasts, fibrosarcoma cells, cultured cells from hypernephromas, or cultured human amnion epithelial cells. The results suggest that the platelet-type GPIIb/IIIa complex is only expressed in cells showing an ability to define megakaryoblastic differentiation. Localization of the GPIIb/IIIa complex at the induced focal adhesion sites in HEL cells and localization of the GPIIIa-like molecules in other cells suggest their direct role in the adhesion process and in the actomyocin organization of adherent cells.\r"

RTF8X, which is highly specific to K562 cells, did not react with the other 14 hematopoietic cell lines and the seven nonhematopoietic cell lines. RTF8X antigen was not detected in normal peripheral blood, but was found in less than 1% of normal marrow cells. RTF8X did not inhibit in vitro colony formation of CFU-E and BFU-E in a complement-dependent cytotoxicity assay. Cell-sorting analysis showed that, morphologically, the RTF8X-positive marrow cells from the patients and normal volunteers contained more than 60% erythroblasts and that CFU-E and BFU-E were not demonstrated in cells with RTF8X antigen. Enzyme treatment suggested that RTF8X antigen was a sialoglycolipid. These results indicate that RTF8X may recognize the surface antigen found increasingly in association with tumors of erythroid lineage. RTF8X should be useful for studies of erythroid differentiation and proliferation in patients.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of transforming growth factor beta 1 or beta 2 (TGF-beta 1 or -beta 2) on the in vitro proliferation and differentiation of normal and malignant human hematopoietic cells were studied. Both forms of TGF-beta suppressed both the normal cellular proliferation and colony formation induced by recombinant human interleukin-3 (IL-3) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). In the presence of GM-CSF or IL-3, optimal concentrations of TGF-beta (400 pmol/L) inhibited colony formation by erythroid (BFU-E), multipotential (CFU-GEMM), and granulocyte-macrophage (CFU-GM) progenitor cells by 90% to 100%, whereas granulocyte or monocyte cluster formation was not inhibited. In contrast, neither form of TGF-beta had any effect on G-CSF-induced hematopoiesis. The suppressive action appeared to be mediated directly by TGF-beta since antiproliferative responses were also observed in accessory cell-depleted bone marrow cells. In contrast to normal bone marrow cells, both GM- and G-CSF-induced proliferation of cells from patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia were suppressed in a dose-dependent manner by TGF-beta. Differential effects of TGF-beta on the proliferation of established leukemic lines were also observed since most cell lines of myelomonocytic nature studied were strongly inhibited where erythroid cell lines were either insensitive or poorly inhibited by TGF-beta. These results suggest that TGF-beta is an important modulator of human hematopoiesis that selectively regulates the growth of less mature hematopoietic cell populations with a high proliferative capacity as opposed to more differentiated cells, which are not affected by TGF-beta.\r"

  ".W": "Seventy-three patients with acute nonlymphocytic leukemia in first complete remission (CR) have received allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) with non-T-lymphocyte-depleted marrow obtained from matched sibling donors. The first 36 patients received a preparative regimen consisting of cyclophosphamide, 60 mg/kg/d (days -6 and -5), and 750 cGy single-dose total-body irradiation (TBI) (day -1). Subsequently, 37 patients received cyclophosphamide 60 mg/kg/d (days -6 and -5), and 165 cGy fractionated TBI administered twice daily for a total dose of 1,320 cGy (days -4, -3, -2, and -1). Survivors have been followed from 9 to 124 months (median, 40 months). The 61% (95% confidence interval [CI], 45% to 77%) projected disease-free survival (DFS) of 41 children less than 18 years old does not differ significantly from the 62% (95% CI, 49% to 73%) projected DFS of 32 adults at 84 months (P = .89). Similarly, the 15% (95% CI, 1% to 29%) projected relapse rate seen in children does not differ from the 9% (95% CI, 0% to 21%) seen in adults (P = .69). Multivariate Cox regression analysis of presenting features demonstrates that a presenting WBC count greater than 20,000/m3 is associated with decreased DFS (P = .01). When compared with other French-American-British (FAB) subtypes, presentation with FAB M4 or M5 morphology is significantly associated with relapse in multivariate analysis (P = .014). Other presenting features such as preparation with single-dose or fractionated TBI, interval from diagnosis to CR or CR to BMT, donor or recipient sex, and donor or recipient cytomegalovirus serology do not correlate independently with either DFS or relapse. When included in the stepwise multivariate analysis of presenting patient features, two posttransplant events, development of grades 2 to 4 acute graft-v-host disease (GVHD) (P less than .03) and development of interstitial pneumonitis (P less than .001), also correlate independently with poor DFS. Allogeneic BMT provides equivalent, prolonged DFS in both children and young adults when performed in first CR and should be considered the therapy of choice for all first CR patients under 45 years of age with a suitable donor. Continued efforts to prevent and treat acute GVHD and pneumonitis as well as efforts designed to prevent relapse in patients presenting with FAB M4 and M5 morphology should further improve outcome.\r"

An IgG2a monoclonal antibody was prepared and it neutralized two forms of MGI-2 (MGI-2A and MGI-2B) produced by mouse Krebs ascites tumor cells. The monoclonal antibody was used for affinity purification of MGI-2. This antibody also neutralized MGI-2 produced by normal mouse macrophages, normal myeloblasts incubated with IL-3, and MGI-2 produced by the lungs and found in the serum of mice injected with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The anti-MGI-2 antibody did not inhibit the activity of any one of the four myeloid growth-inducing proteins (CSF or IL-3 = MGI-1), IL-1, tumor necrosis factor, or lymphotoxin. This antibody also inhibited induction of differentiation of myeloid leukemic cells by LPS, which is mediated by the endogenous production of MGI-2, but did not inhibit induction of differentiation in these leukemic cells by dexamethasone or cytosine arabinoside, which is not mediated by MGI-2. Anti-MGI-2 antibody thus inhibited differentiation when MGI-2 was added externally to cells or when it was mediated by endogenously produced MGI-2.\r"

  ".W": "Thirty-eight patients (median age, 21 years) with acute nonlymphoblastic leukemia (ANLL) (17 patients), acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma (ALL) (18 patients), chronic myelogenous leukemia (two patients), and refractory anemia received allogeneic bone marrow transplants from HLA-identical sibling donors or a one-antigen-mismatched brother (one patient) after a preparatory regimen consisting of fractionated total body irradiation and high-dose VP 16-213 (60 to 70 mg/kg body weight). Of the 33 patients with acute leukemia who received grafts from HLA-identical donors, three patients with ANLL received transplants in first remission and one patient with standard-risk ALL received a graft while in second remission. All other patients were in more advanced stages of their disease or exhibited other high-risk features. At the time of analysis, 20 of the 33 patients were alive, with 19 of them remaining in continued complete remission for 6 to 35 months (median, 18 months). The 3-year actuarial disease-free survival rate of 56.6% +/- 9.7% (SE) and the actuarial relapse rate of 11.9% +/- 6.8% (SE) demonstrate that the combination of fractionated total body irradiation and high-dose VP 16 is an effective mode of therapy in patients with advanced leukemias. Preliminary experience cautions against the use of VP 16 instead of cyclophosphamide in any clinical situation carrying an increased risk of graft rejection because the immunosuppressive potency of VP 16 is largely untested but may be inferior to that of cyclophosphamide.\r"

  ".W": "Etoposide and cytarabine have been shown to exert high antileukemic activity and are currently under study as preparatory agents before allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. However, data concerning their engraftment-promoting potency are scarce. Therefore, we tested these agents in LEW rats receiving a myeloablative dose of busulfan followed by transfer of F1 (CAP X LEW) marrow, which is unable to induce a graft-v-host reaction (GVHR). Since busulfan by itself has only minor immunosuppressive potency, graft rejection ensues unless etoposide, cytarabine, or cyclophosphamide provide additional immunosuppression to facilitate durable engraftment. Before allogeneic bone marrow transplantation in humans, 120 mg/kg of cyclophosphamide, 60 mg/kg of etoposide, or 900 mg/kg of cytarabine are the standard doses given in conjunction with total body irradiation. Seventy-five percent of these doses administered in addition to busulfan resulted in rejection rates of 75% for cytarabine and 58% for etoposide, respectively, whereas no rejections were observed with cyclophosphamide. These data indicate that etoposide and cytarabine are inferior to cyclophosphamide in their rejection-preventing potential. Using either of these agents as substitutes for cyclophosphamide before allogeneic bone marrow transplantation may increase the risk of graft rejection in HLA-mismatched bone marrow transplantation and, in case of HLA identity, if T-depleted marrow is administered.\r"

These different types include four growth-inducing proteins called colony-stimulating factors (CSF), including interleukin-3 (IL-3), or macrophage and granulocyte inducers, type 1 (MGI-1); another type (called MGI-2) that induces myeloid differentiation of normal myeloid cells without inducing myeloid cell multiplication; and interleukin-1 (IL-1), which can act on myeloid precursor cells. Different clones of myeloid leukemic cells can differ in their ability to be induced to undergo terminal cell differentiation by different hematopoietic regulatory proteins. We have now studied the ability of cyclosporine A and recombinant IL-1 alpha to regulate in vivo differentiation of different clones of myeloid leukemic cells that are either susceptible or resistant to induction of differentiation by IL-1 in vitro. The results show that (a) cyclosporine A, like other immune-suppressing compounds such as cyclophosphamide, inhibited in vivo differentiation of myeloid leukemic cells and differentiation was restored by injecting recombinant GM-CSF; (b) recombinant IL-1 alpha induced in vivo terminal differentiation of IL-1-sensitive but not IL-1-resistant clones of myeloid leukemic cells; (c) IL-1 alpha and GM-CSF synergistically induced differentiation in vivo in a GM-CSF-responsive and IL-1-nonresponsive clone of leukemic cells; and (d) IL-1 alpha induced in vivo the rapid production and release into serum of the differentiation-inducing protein MGI-2 as well as the growth-inducing proteins M-CSF and G-CSF.\r"

The surface antigens remained intact after this fixation procedure, enabling simultaneous detection of membrane and intracellular antigens. The binding of biotinylated antibodies against several B- and T-lymphoid membrane antigens was detected with streptavidin-phycoerythrin (red fluorescence), whereas the intracellular antigens were stained with FITC-labeled polyclonal antibodies, or indirectly with FITC-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG (green fluorescence).

Regulation of SkPl and plasmin by the plasma proteinase inhibitors, alpha 2-antiplasmin (alpha 2AP) and alpha 2-macroglobulin (alpha 2M), was studied as a function of temperature in plasminogen-depleted human plasma, mouse plasma, and solutions of purified proteins. The reaction of plasmin with proteinase inhibitors in human plasma was complete. alpha 2AP was the predominant inhibitor. The fraction of alpha 2M-plasmin recovered was not affected significantly by incubation temperature. In contrast, the reaction of SkPl with human proteinase inhibitors was markedly temperature dependent. The apparent second-order rate constant for the reaction of SkPl with purified alpha 2AP at 37 degrees C (1.5 x 10(2) mol/L-1 s-1) was greater than 150-fold higher than the constant derived at 4 degrees C. In human plasma and in solutions containing mixtures of purified human proteins, alpha 2AP was the principal inhibitor of SkPl. Elevating the temperature enhanced the reaction of SkPl with alpha 2AP and alpha 2M comparably. Equivalent results were obtained when incubations were performed in platelet-rich plasma (PRP) or whole blood. In murine plasma, SkPl reacted readily with the proteinase inhibitors. The principal inhibitor of SkPl was alpha 2M. Maximum reaction between SkPl and murine alpha 2M was observed at 37 degrees C; however, significant reaction also occurred at 4 degrees C. alpha 2 AP was the predominant inhibitor of plasmin in mouse plasma. Reaction of alpha 2AP with SkPl in murine plasma was significant only after the alpha 2M was inactivated with methylamine. These results were not affected by platelets or whole blood cells. We conclude that the thrombolytic efficacy of streptokinase reflects not only the nature of the plasminogen activator complex but also the function of the proteinase inhibitors.\r"

  ".W": "We studied the effects of recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSFrh) on the internal pH of granulocytes using the fluorescent probe BCECF. GM-CSFrh did not directly alter the resting pH of granulocytes isolated from the peripheral blood; however, when the cells were preincubated for 90 minutes with the growth factor and then activated with the chemotactic peptide N-formyl met leu phe (fMLP), they exhibited both an acceleration in the initial rate of acidification and a marked delay in realkalinization. The kinetic changes both in initial acidification and in subsequent realkalinization induced by GM-CSFrh priming were not prevented by protein synthesis inhibitors and were observed in granulocytes harvested from patients with both sex-linked and autosomal recessive chronic granulomatous disease (CGD). By directly quantitating H+ ion secretion, by monitoring the effects of sodium repletion on intracellular pH, and through use of the sodium channel inhibitors amiloride and dimethyl amiloride and the Na+/K+-ATPase inhibitor ouabain, we showed that the altered kinetics of intracellular acidification and alkalinization following fMLP stimulation of GM-CSFrh-primed granulocytes could not be accounted for by changes in transmembrane proton exportation regulated by the Na+/H+ antiport channel. Although the initial acidification following fMLP was abrogated by 2-deoxy-D-glucose in both GM-CSFrh-pretreated and GM-CSFrh-untreated granulocytes, retardation of the subsequent phase of alkalinization was observed in GM-CSFrh-primed cells even after inhibition of both glycolytic and mitochondrial metabolism. Our data indicate that the increased cytosolic acidification following fMLP stimulation in granulocytes \"primed\" with GM-CSFrh does not result from disordered proton excretion but instead from increased release of intracellular free acid which is only partially coupled to glucose catabolism or to the generation of superoxide anion (O2-).\r"

With the addition of rEpo alone, no leukemic blast colony formation was stimulated in any of the cases examined. However, when rEpo and phytohemagglutinin lymphocyte-conditioned medium (PHA-LCM) were added to the culture simultaneously, in contrast to results with PHA-LCM alone, the number of leukemic blast colonies formed was significantly increased in two of the ten cases (P less than .01). These two cases were classified as M1 according to the French-American-British (FAB) classification. This enhancing effect of rEpo was observed with human recombinant granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor (rGM-CSF) or human recombinant interleukin-3 (rIL-3) but was not observed with human recombinant granulocyte CSF (rGCSF).\r"

In this study, the combined effects of EL (ET-18-OCH3, ET-16-NHCOCH3, or BM 41.440) and hyperthermia on the growth of hematopoietic progenitors, myeloid leukemic cell lines, and leukemic cells obtained from patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) were examined to determine if this combination resulted in a greater selective killing of leukemic cells than that achieved by either EL or heat alone. When the cells were treated simultaneously with EL (50 micrograms/mL) and hyperthermia (42 degrees C) for one hour, the killing of leukemic cell line cells was enhanced considerably. Among the three EL, however, the combination of ET-18-OCH3 and heat seemed to be the most cytotoxic to leukemic cell line cells with no effect on the growth of hematopoietic progenitors. An increase in the duration of treatment with ET-18-OCH3 to four hours with heat added during the last hour resulted in a further reduction of leukemic cell line cells while sparing 50% of hematopoietic progenitors after cryopreservation. The combined treatment with ET-18-OCH3 and heat also inhibited the growth of leukemic progenitors obtained from AML patients by 97% to 100%. These data indicate that the combined treatment with EL and hyperthermia might offer an efficient means to eliminate myeloid leukemic cells in vitro.\r"

  ".W": "The risk of development of CNS leukemia was investigated in 153 adults with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) who received systemic combination chemotherapy without CNS prophylaxis. Overall, 31 patients (20%) developed CNS leukemia after a median of 6 months of therapy; the estimated 1-year incidence of CNS leukemia was 21% (SE, 3.9%). Characteristics significantly associated with CNS involvement included the presence of elevated hemoglobin creatinine, alkaline phosphatase, fibrinogen, and lactic dehydrogenase levels; B-cell leukemia; and high leukemic cell proliferative activity. Multivariate analysis identified lactic dehydrogenase levels of greater than or equal to 600 U/L and greater than or equal to 14% of cells in the S + G2M compartment to have independent additive poor prognostic significance. Patients were categorized into different risk groups for CNS leukemia with 1-year incidences ranging from 4% to 55%. While related to a high occurrence of CNS leukemia at diagnosis (33%) and subsequently (100%), the low incidence of B-cell disease excluded it from the multivariate analysis. The use of systemic chemotherapy containing multiple agents with good CNS penetration and in high doses (VAD regimen) in 90 patients was associated with a trend for lower CNS leukemia at 1 year (15% v 31%), especially in the low-risk category. We propose to develop future therapies for adults with ALL that include risk-oriented CNS prophylactic approaches.\r"

  ".U": "89027116\r", 
  ".W": "Removal of sialic acid from the von Willebrand factor (vWF) subunit exposes additional cleavage sites in the amino-terminal region that are associated with loss of large multimers. The extent of large multimer loss was evaluated by examining the sites of subunit cleavage of native and carbohydrate-modified vWF after treatment with trypsin, chymotrypsin, or plasmin. In the presence of proteinase inhibitors, purified vWF was treated with neuraminidase alone to remove 90% to 95% of the sialic acid or with neuraminidase and beta-galactosidase to remove the sialic acid and 45% to 50% of the D-galactose, with little or no loss of large multimers observed. Digestion of native vWF with trypsin produced the greatest loss of large multimers, while chymotrypsin produced less and plasmin produced the least. Large multimer loss was more extensive with each enzyme after carbohydrate modification of vWF. The extent and approximate location of subunit cleavage was determined by immunoblotting and monoclonal antibody epitope mapping. Trypsin, chymotrypsin, and plasmin were shown to produce both amino- and carboxyl-terminal fragments. The number, location, and relative quantities of carboxyl-terminal fragments produced were unchanged after carbohydrate modification. However, digestion of the amino-terminal region was considerably more extensive after carbohydrate modification as judged by a marked decrease or absence of the larger fragments seen when native vWF was digested, and by the appearance of new smaller molecular mass species. Therefore, the greater loss of large multimers that occurs after carbohydrate modification is likely to be the result of cleavages in the amino-terminal region of the molecule. By protecting the vWF subunit against amino-terminal cleavage, sialic acid inhibits the loss of large multimers.\r"

  ".W": "Recombinant human (rh) interleukin-3 (IL-3) stimulated the proliferation and differentiation of erythroid, granulocyte, macrophage, eosinophil (Eo), and mixed colonies as well as megakaryocytes from human bone marrow cells. rh IL-3 was a weaker stimulus than rh granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) for day 14 myeloid cell colonies. At day 7 of incubation, rh IL-3 stimulated a few G, M, and Eo clusters but no colonies. This loss of responsiveness of myeloid cells to rh IL-3 was accentuated with further differentiation of the cells. rh IL-3 stimulated very few or no clones after five-day incubation with enriched promyelocytes and myelocytes, whereas rh GM-CSF was an efficient stimulus. Responsiveness to rh IL-3 was completely lost in postmitotic mature neutrophils. Incubation of these cells with rh IL-3 did not result in enhanced antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) of tumor cells or superoxide anion production after stimulation with formyl-methyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (FMLP), although they could be stimulated by rh GM-CSF. In addition, preincubation of neutrophils with different concentrations of rh IL-3 failed to increase or decrease their response to rh GM-CSF. In contrast to neutrophils, mature Eos could be stimulated by rh IL-3 to kill antibody-coated tumor cells. These results show that cells of the neutrophilic myeloid series lose their responsiveness to h IL-3 as they differentiate and suggest that although h IL-3 may be an important therapeutic agent to use for hematopoietic regeneration in vivo, the lack of stimulation of mature neutrophil function makes it an unlikely sole candidate as adjunct therapy for treatment of infectious diseases.\r"

Experiments using a variety of cytokines demonstrated that KT-3 proliferated in response to recombinant interleukin-2 (rIL-2), rIL-4, or rIL-6 but did not proliferate in response to rIL-1 alpha, rIL-1 beta, rIL-3, recombinant granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (rG-CSF), rGM-CSF, recombinant interferon-alpha (rIFN-alpha), rIFN-gamma, recombinant tumor necrosis factor (rTNF-alpha), or native IFN-beta. Polyclonal rabbit anti-IL-6 antibody almost completely neutralized the activities of macrophage-derived factors or IL-6 but not IL-2 or IL-4. Scatchard plot analysis demonstrated that KT-3 cells indeed express IL-6 receptors. The results indicate that the macrophage-derived factor that supports the growth of KT-3 is IL-6 and suggest that macrophage-derived IL-6 may play an important role in the histopathogenesis of Lennert's lymphoma.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To determine effectiveness of advice from general practitioners to heavy drinkers to reduce their excessive alcohol consumption (35 U or more a week for men, 21 U or more for women). DESIGN--Randomised, controlled double blind trial over 12 months with interim assessment at six months. SETTING--Group practices (n = 47; list size averaging 10,000) recruited from Medical Research Council's general practice research framework, mostly in rural or small urban settings. PATIENTS--Patients recruited after questionnaire survey. Of total of 2571 (61.2%) of 4203 patients invited for interview who attended, 909 (35.4%) stated that in past seven days they had drunk above the limits set for study and had not received advice; they were randomised to control and treatment groups. INTERVENTIONS--Patients in treatment group were interviewed by general practitioner (who had had a training session) and received advice and information about how to reduce consumption and also given a drinking diary. END POINT--Study aimed at detecting a reduction in proportion of men with excessive alcohol consumption of 30% in treatment group and 20% in control group (for women 40% and 20%, respectively) with a power of 90% at 5% level of significance. In addition, corroborative measures such as estimation of gamma-glutamyltransferase activity were included. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS--At one year a mean reduction in consumption of alcohol of 18.2 (SE 1.5) U/week had occurred in treated men compared with a reduction of 8.1 (1.6) U/week in controls (p less than 0.001). The proportion of men with excessive consumption at interview had dropped by 43.7% in the treatment group compared with 25.5% in controls (p less than 0.001). A mean reduction in weekly consumption of 11.5 (1.6) U occurred in treated women compared with 6.3 (2.0) U in controls (p less than 0.05), with proportionate reductions of excessive drinkers in treatment and control groups of 47.7% and 29.2% respectively. Reduction in consumption increased significantly with number of general practitioner interventions. At one year the mean value for gamma-glutamyltransferase activity had dropped significantly more in treated men (-2.4 (0.9)IU/l) than in controls (+1.1(1.0)IU/l; t = 2.7, p less than 0.01). Reduction in gamma-glutamyltransferase activity tended to increase with number of intervention sessions in men. Changes in gamma-glutamyltransferase activity in women and changes in other indicators in both sexes did not differ significantly between treatment and control groups.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Therapies were classified as 'definitely effective' if their effectiveness was demonstrated in at least one randomized placebo-controlled study of women with cyclical mastopathy, 'probably effective' if their effectiveness in relieving breast symptoms was demonstrated in at least one study in women with premenstrual syndrome, and 'probably not effective' if they had not been shown to improve breast symptoms in at least two studies in women with premenstrual syndrome. Bromocriptine, danazol, evening primrose oil, tamoxifen and reduction of dietary fat intake were classified as definitely effective and norethisterone and Bellergal as probably effective. Several therapeutic manoeuvres, including reduction of methylxanthine ingestion and the administration of vitamin E or diuretics, have not been adequately evaluated in women with cyclical breast symptoms. A review of the published reports of the physiological effects of therapies that were definitely or probably effective revealed that these agents acted either to alter serum prolactin levels or lipid metabolism, or both. As evidence exists that prolactin influences lipid metabolism it is postulated that cyclical mastopathy may be a disorder of lipid metabolism.\r"

All eligible patients had self-rated moderate or severe mastalgia present for at least 6 months, for which no specific therapy had been given for the previous 3 months. End points of the study were pain control, measured by linear analogue scales, relapse rate and side-effects. Pain relief was achieved in 90 per cent of those receiving 10 mg daily and 86 per cent of those given 20 mg daily. The relapse rate was also similar for both dosages, being 48 per cent and 39 per cent respectively and usually occurred within 2-3 months of discontinuing treatment. However, side-effects were reported less frequently among those receiving 10 mg daily (21 per cent versus 64 per cent; chi 2 = 11.1, P less than 0.001). Prolongation of treatment from 3 months to 6 months did not materially improve the response rate (85 per cent versus 90 per cent). Side-effects were similar, as was the relapse rate among the patients receiving the two durations of treatment. The agent proved to be significantly more effective in the relief of cyclical rather than non-cyclical pain (94 per cent versus 56 per cent). Use of tamoxifen for the treatment of mastalgia is still experimental. Nevertheless, for the majority of women with mastalgia, pain relief can be achieved using tamoxifen 10 mg daily, given for a 3-month course. As almost half these patients will develop relapse of breast pain it may be necessary to give longer courses of therapy, although the safety of this more protracted treatment has yet to be determined.\r"

  ".W": "One hundred and five patients with discrete breast lumps were examined with a 10 MHz Doppler ultrasonic flowmeter. Doppler flow signals were analysed on an Angioscan spectrum analyser. Recordings from the opposite normal breast were taken as controls and signals from the two sides compared. In 23 patients signals from the normal breast could not be recorded and therefore results of the remaining 82 patients are reported. These included 39 patients with carcinoma, 20 with fibroadenoma, 12 with cyclical nodularity and 11 with cysts. Malignant lumps exhibited significantly higher peak systolic (S) and minimum diastolic frequencies (D) in comparison to the control breast. Fibroadenoma also had a higher S and D than those of the opposite normal breast. Signals over cysts and cyclical nodularity showed no significant difference from the recordings over the control side. Despite significantly higher systolic and diastolic frequencies in the cancer group in comparison to benign lumps and normal breast, considerable overlap in the values was seen between cancer and other groups. Therefore the patterns on 10 MHz Doppler sonography are not sufficiently specific to discriminate benign from malignant breast lumps.\r"

The overall mortality was 24 per cent, all 11 deaths occurring in 24 patients seen prior to 1978 when there was often a considerable delay in the diagnosis of liver abscess (mean 90 +/- 71 days). In seven patients the diagnosis was not made until post-mortem examination. The mainstay of treatment was surgical drainage. Since 1978 high resolution imaging techniques for the liver, and in particular ultrasound, have been available. The diagnostic delay has been significantly reduced (mean 28 +/- 20 days, P less than 0.01). Patients are receiving definitive treatment at an earlier stage in the evolution of the disease process, with fewer established complications prior to treatment (P less than 0.05). Percutaneous drainage under ultrasound control is the preferred initial drainage procedure in high-risk patients. There have been no deaths in 22 patients treated for pyogenic liver abscess since 1978 (P less than 0.001).\r"

The prevalence on December 1, 1986 of epilepsy in the Cambridge series was 6.2%, ten times higher than that of epilepsy in the general population. Seizures in Wilson's disease occur at any stage of the disease, but often begin shortly after the start of treatment. Prognosis of seizures was comparable with the best quoted figures for idiopathic epilepsy: at 7 years 60% of cases had been seizure-free for at least 5 years, and 75% for at least 2 years. Possible mechanisms of seizures are discussed. Penicillamine-induced pyridoxine deficiency is probably not involved in more than a minority of cases. It is more likely that a direct effect of copper deposition is responsible for most of the seizures.\r"

Many of these unmyelinated axons are labelled by antibodies to calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), a substance found in sensory cells, axons and terminals. On this basis we suggest that there are significant numbers of unmyelinated primary afferent axons in the human posterior columns. These results indicate that unmyelinated sensory axons are more widespread than previously thought, and that they should be taken into account when considering stimulation of the posterior columns to relieve pain.\r"

  ".W": "The diagnosis of sarcoidosis depends on the clinical and radiologic features along with histologic evidence of epithelioid-cell granulomas on biopsy. The amount of histologic support required varies inversely with the certainty with which the pattern of clinical features is recognized. It is essential to exclude other recognized causes of granulomatous disease. On the basis of our experience and that of other workers, we believe that sarcoidosis must be considered in the differential diagnosis when optic nerve thickening is encountered on CT, MRI or echography. Chest roentgenography is the easiest way to confirm the diagnosis. However, as many as 15% of patients will have a normal x-ray film, and other tests may be needed to help confirm the diagnosis. Biopsy of the involved tissues may be the only way to make the diagnosis. Once a provisional diagnosis is made, investigation for systemic sarcoidosis should include chest roentgenography, determination of the serum ACE level, 67Ga scanning, pulmonary function studies, testing for delayed skin reactions (with tuberculin, C. albicans, Trichophyton and mumps virus) and blood studies (determination of the erythrocyte sedimentation rate and levels of immunoglobulins, albumin, calcium and alkaline phosphatase). Finally, conjunctival biopsy is simple to do and is quite useful in supporting the diagnosis if no other tissue is readily available.\r"

Visual acuity was measured in both eyes of each subject by means of conventional testing with an optical projection device and computerized testing with a program run on a microcomputer. Of the 222 eyes 155 (70%) showed no difference in visual acuity between the two procedures. A difference of one acuity line was found for 63 eyes (28%), and a difference of two lines was found for 4 eyes (2%). The conventional test yielded a higher acuity score in 75% of the cases in which a one-line difference was found and 50% of those in which a two-line difference was found. Our results indicate that computerized testing is a valid and effective method of assessing visual acuity in children.\r"

We performed a randomized double-blind trial comparing amoxicillin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole in 221 children in whom acute otitis media was diagnosed in an outpatient setting. Diagnosis was on the basis of symptoms, otoscopic examination and acoustic reflectometry. No culture specimens were taken. A research nurse, using the same methods, evaluated patients in a follow-up home visit at around 14 days and measured compliance by examination of the medicine bottle. Equal proportions of children in the two groups were cured or improved (88% and 87%). Therapeutic efficacy was related to compliance in both groups, and there were few side effects in either group. This study had statistical power of 80% to detect a difference of 15%. We conclude that trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole can be considered a first-line antibiotic in the treatment of acute otitis media.\r"

The cause of blepharospasm and other forms of cranial dystonia is not known. Hemifacial spasm is usually due to compression of the seventh cranial nerve at its exit from the brain stem. Cranial dystonia may result in severe disability. Hemifacial spasm tends to be much less disabling but may cause considerable distress and embarrassment. Patients affected with these disorders are often mistakenly considered to have psychiatric problems. Although the two disorders are quite distinct pathophysiologically, therapy with botulinum toxin has proven very effective in both. We review the clinical features, proposed pathophysiologic features, differential diagnosis and treatment, including the use of botulinum toxin, of cranial dystonia and hemifacial spasm.\r"

The fifth patient had metastases to the lung, pleura, and diaphragm. The remaining five patients were believed to be free of metastatic disease. Two of these five patients died of metastatic disease at 3 and 16 months, respectively, after transplantation. Interestingly, all five patients with metastatic involvement are currently alive 40.6 +/- 22 months (mean +/- standard error of mean [SEM]) after transplantation, although one of these patients currently has metastatic disease to the lungs and mediastinum. Thus, the projected 5-year actuarial survival rate is 76%, with two patients at risk after the third year.

Unfixed frozen sections of lymph nodes from four patients with Hodgkin's disease and 39 with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, together with normal lymph nodes, were studied by the avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex (ABC) technique. Two monoclonal antibodies, MYC-2 raised against recombinant human c-myc protein (reacting specifically with the c-myc products P62 and P67) and RASK-4 (raised against recombinant P21 and reacting specifically with ras-family product P21) were used. The c-myc product was detected in nuclei of ML cells and some normal, mainly germinal center, lymphocytes. When the staining intensity shown by normal germinal-center lymphocytes was graded as positive (+) or weakly positive (+/-), a very intensely positive reaction ( to ++) was observed in 37 cases (86%) of ML, a positive reaction (+) in four cases (9.3%), and a weakly positive reaction (+/-) in two cases (4.7%). The ras family oncogene product reaction was intensely positive (++) in two cases (4.7%), positive (+) in 16 cases (37.2%), weakly positive (+/-) in 13 cases (30.2%), and negative in 12 cases (27.9%). Western blot analysis confirmed an elevated level of c-myc products in two cases, which showed intense MYC-2 staining, and of ras family products in one case, which demonstrated intense RASK-4 staining. The enhanced expression of these gene products may play an important role in lymphomagenesis of such cases.\r"

This unusual pattern of relapse suggests that the patient's disseminated disease was related to infusion of malignant cells at the time of transplantation.\r"

Glucocorticoid receptor was present in seven of ten HCC samples, values ranged from 1.9 to 66.8 fmol/mg protein. Progesterone receptor was present in two of ten HCC samples with values of 1.7 and 7.2 fmol/mg protein, respectively. In the adjacent liver tissues, no measurable progesterone receptor was found and only one sample had glucocorticoid receptor with a value of 3.0 fmol/mg protein. The increase of glucocorticoid receptor in HCC samples was coincident with a decreased level of tyrosine aminotransferase and an increased level of gamma-glutamyltransferase. No correlation was found among glucocorticoid receptor level, serum or tissue alpha-fetoprotein levels. The presence of glucocorticoid receptors in HCC suggest that hormones may play an important role in the formation of hepatoma, and hormonal therapy may be useful for patients with HCC.\r"

A much weaker reaction was detected within tumor cells in six cases, in one of which it was diffuse and five focal.

  ".W": "A monoclonal antibody (anti-estrogen receptor [ER] from the ER-immunocytochemical assay [ICA] [Abbott Laboratories, Berkshire, England]), which binds to epitopes of the estrogen receptor in surgical biopsy specimens of breast carcinomas, was used in an improved alkaline phosphatase anti-alkaline phosphatase (APAAP) technique for in-situ receptor detection. This method was compared with a standard radioligand binding biochemical assay in assessing the ER status of 48 human breast carcinomas. The monoclonal antibody allowed detection of ER in the presence of estrogens or anti-estrogens and avoided problems of nonspecific intrinsic reactions, due to endogenous steroid hormones. The immunohistologic results (positive and negative) correlated well with the radioligand binding results (rs = 0.760; P less than 0.001) and allowed the additional assessment of cell morphology and tumor heterogeneity in the cryostat sections. The APAAP method provides diagnostic rapidity (approximately 4 hours) combined with sensitivity as compared with the radioligand assay (an approximately 2-day assay). The vivid red color associated with APAAP staining also was a distinct advantage compared with the brown reaction product of ER-ICA in interpreting stained sections. The results of this study indicate that the APAAP technique is an improved method for detection of ER and is applicable in routine hospital practice, thereby contributing to the immediate clinical management of patients with breast tumors.\r"

The patient characteristics of the two groups were comparable, confirming satisfactory randomization. Multivariate regression analysis failed to show any statistical significance in the antiemetic response between the two treatment groups. However, female patients receiving Adriamycin (Adria Laboratories, Columbus, OH) concurrently and obese persons exhibited more vomiting. The overall antiemetic response rate was 66%. Because the side effects were minimal, a higher dose of MCP is expected to improve emetic control without increasing toxicity. The use of a 36-hour assessment period in our study gave more meaningful data. An exponential increase in the dose of MCP is probably required, with respect to weight, to obtain the same antiemetic efficacy.\r"

Therapy consisted of combinations of vincristine, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide for 3 months. After demonstrating cross-reactivity by a panel of six monoclonal neuroblastoma (NB) antibodies with the patient's RB cells, her marrow was purged by using microsphere-linked monoclonal antibodies, and then reinfused as rescue therapy after ablative doses of etoposide and cyclophosphamide. The authors conclude that short-term induction therapy followed by marrow ablative combination chemotherapy and immunomagnetically purged autologous marrow rescue can (1) effect successful outcome in widely metastatic RB, and (2) eliminate the risk of therapy-induced second malignancies.\r"

Cirrhosis was absent in all cases, and other causes for HCC in childhood were not found. All children with HBV-associated HCC died within 6 months of diagnosis. The median survival time of these children was 2 months. Only one child with HCC of trabecular subtype without HBV association is still living after 18 months. However, this child has metastases and a local recurrence. Three other children with HCC of fibrolamellar subtype are free of disease after 2, 5, and 6 years, respectively. The high number of cases of HBV-associated HCC shows the important role of HBV infection as an etiologic factor for the development of childhood HCC in middle Europe.\r"

New pulmonary infiltrates developed in seven patients. Six deaths occurred during the initial hospitalization for transplantation, only one of which was directly attributable to infection. Stepwise logistic regression analysis retained male gender, total body irradiation, administration of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, and development of mucositis or diarrhea as predictors of decreased survival, whereas higher pretreatment albumin levels and the administration of oral nonabsorbable antifungals were associated with an increased likelihood of survival. A comparison of these infectious complications with those found in allogeneic bone marrow transplant recipients shows similarities and differences with potentially important implications for patient management.\r"

With careful attention to patient selection factors (occlusion duration, length, morphology, associated thrombus) and technique (initial use of soft guidewires and low-profile dilatation catheters, confirmation of correct wire position, examination for unsuspected distal disease, prolonged heparinization post-procedure), primary success can be achieved in more than 75% of patients. New equipment and techniques--such as thermal or specialized mechanical angioplasty--may facilitate successful crossing of the remaining 25% of total occlusions. The presence of collateral blood flow to the distal vessel provides an important \"safety net\" and explains the low incidence of emergency surgery following PTCA in this patient group. Patients undergoing successful PTCA of total occlusions should be watched carefully, given the somewhat higher incidence of abrupt reclosure and late restenosis compared with dilatation of conventional stenoses.\r"

The complexity of this ligament and associated normal kinematics of the knee challenges the ability of orthopaedists to devise effective therapeutic measures to reconstitute its function when lost. A clearer understanding of the normal role of the ACL will aid in this effort.\r"

  ".U": "89028800\r", 
  ".W": "The goal of any surgical procedure to correct the instability caused by loss of the ACL is to control the abnormal anterior excursion of the tibia on the femur. Because the main problem is loss of the ACL, it would seem most reasonable to approach this problem by performing an intra-articular reconstruction of the ACL, thus approximating as closely as possible the normal anatomy of the ACL. The classic open intra-articular ACL reconstructions are technically demanding surgical procedures that usually require a significant \"learning curve\" to achieve a level of technical expertise and confidence. In addition, postoperative complications such as adhesions, loss of motion, prolonged muscle atrophy, and a long rehabilitation period are well known. Thus, it would appear that the extra-articular reconstructive procedures for the anterior cruciate-deficient knee would offer some advantage over these more formidable surgical procedures. Whereas the main problem is certainly the loss of the ACL, the extra-articular procedures are directed more toward the most symptomatic anterior excursion of the tibia on the femur, the pivot shift phenomenon, where the anterolateral portion of the tibia moves anterior in relation to the femur. Thus, the goal of the extra-articular reconstructive procedures for anterolateral rotatory instability is to eliminate functional instability. These goals are most readily achieved by positioning some portion of the iliotibial tract posterior to the transverse center of rotation of the knee to provide a reinforcement for the lateral tibial plateau as the knee approaches terminal extension. All of the extra-articular procedures discussed in this article have been used successfully as reported by the various authors. There are many technical details inherent in each of these surgical procedures, and the reader is referred to the original articles for a more explicit description of these surgical procedures. For the individual surgeon to participate in and view the actual surgical procedure that he or she intends to perform would be the ideal situation. Various workshops where surgical procedures of the knee are actually performed and studied are currently available and are of great value to the surgeon. Of equal importance to the technical demands of the various surgical procedures is selection of the appropriate procedure for each patient. The selection must be based on many factors. The most important factor is the identification of the patient with a high level of athletic activity who is unwilling to modify his or her activity level to compensate for a deficient ACL.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Two prosthetic ligaments, the Kennedy LAD and Gore-Tex, are FDA approved for limited indications. The Kennedy LAD has been shown to be effective in augmenting an autograft with inherent structural weakness in its central portion. The proposed benefits of using this device with grafts of greater strength are unproved. The Gore-Tex ACL reconstruction allows a rapid initiation of vigorous rehabilitation and return to full activities. However, the complication rate with this procedure appears to be higher than that with autograft reconstruction. The use of allograft for ACL reconstruction also has many potential advantages and short-term clinical trials have shown good results. However, the benefits must be weighed against the possibility of long-term failure and potential spread of infectious disease.\r"

Continued research in surgical and rehabilitative management is necessary to reduce this time and expense if ACL reconstruction is to be practical for all.\r"

It has attempted to discuss the controversies surrounding these braces and to analyze the scientific data presented to date. Prophylactic braces have been shown to be ineffective in preventing knee injuries in their present-day design. Evidence has also shown that their use may even lead to increased knee injuries. On the other hand, rehabilitative braces do serve a useful purpose in regard to the operative and nonoperative treatment of ligamentous knee injuries. With their use in the application and control of joint motion, they are an important addition to the surgeon's armamentarium. One must keep in mind, however, that these braces provide little static anterior/posterior control and the hinge settings may not actually reflect true joint motion. Functional knee braces may play a role in the treatment of patients with pathologic laxity owing to an injury of the ACL. Combined with an adequate rehabilitation program and activity modification, these braces do limit excessive anterior tibial translation under low-loading conditions. However, under conditions of high loading these braces provide little or no resistance to anterior translation. Therefore, in most sporting activities, their efficacy is questionable. Knee bracing continues to be a complex and controversial topic in the field of orthopaedic surgery. The answers for the design of the \"ideal\" brace are being continually worked out and the need for more detailed, well-controlled studies continues to be great.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Also, cardiac receptor stimulation is known to interact with the expression of arterial baroreflexes. Therefore, experiments were performed to determine the effects of left circumflex coronary artery infusion of PGI2 on the baroreflex control of heart rate in conscious instrumented dogs. Dogs were instrumented chronically with an aortic catheter for the measurement of mean aortic pressure, hydraulic occluder cuffs on the descending aorta and inferior vena cava, a left ventricular catheter for the measurement of left ventricular pressure and heart rate, and a nonocclusive catheter in the left circumflex coronary artery. At the time of experimentation, arterial pressure was altered randomly in steps by partially inflating the occluders. Mean arterial pressure-heart curves (baroreflex curves) were constructed by fitting the data to a logistic curve by nonlinear regression. PGI2 infused into the left circumflex coronary artery at doses of 10, 20, and 50 ng/kg/min caused significant (p less than 0.05) inhibition of the maximum heart rate, heart rate range, and maximum slope of the curve compared to the control baroreflex curve obtained during intracoronary infusion of PGI2 vehicle. PGI2 had no significant effect on the minimum heart rate during hypertension. Since PGI2 is known to stimulate left ventricular receptors, these effects were most likely produced via stimulation of cardiac receptors. In additional experiments using beta 1-blockade with metoprolol or cholinergic blockade with atropine methyl bromide, it was shown that PGI2 attenuates baroreflex-mediated tachycardia by preventing parasympathetic withdrawal completely and by attenuating sympathetic stimulation by approximately 50%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

A follow-up study, including late functional data, of 148 patients who underwent mitral valve reconstruction at our institution was combined with a review of the literature to assess the current status of mitral reconstruction. The results indicate that mitral reconstruction by Carpentier techniques is widely applicable, durable, and relatively free of complication. Freedom from late thromboembolic and anticoagulant complications is particularly notable. These factors could prove to justify earlier operative intervention in patients with mitral insufficiency before permanent myocardial damage evolves. As mitral valve reconstruction techniques become more familiar and widely used, mitral reconstruction may become the operative procedure of choice for mitral insufficiency, especially insufficiency due to degenerative disease.\r"

Relief of symptoms, slowing of the progression of the cardiac functional abnormality, and prolongation of life provide the major agenda for the physician faced with the management of these patients. Judicious use of vasodilators, diuretics, digoxin, dietary therapy, and exercise therapy can relieve symptoms and improve the quality of life in most patients suffering from this syndrome. Recent evidence that vasodilator drugs can prolong life now provides the physician with further justification for routine use of this class of compounds. The eventual solution to the high mortality in this common disease process may be prevention of the development of overt heart failure by more prompt recognition and early treatment of the signs of ventricular dysfunction. This possibility must await the completion of current and proposed clinical trials.\r"

To determine if orthotopic cardiac transplantation impairs the capacity of the coronary vasculature to vasodilate and conduct hyperemic blood flow, maximal coronary vasodilator reserve was measured in 25 cardiac allograft recipients with no evidence of rejection 6-57 months after transplantation and in 20 normal subjects. Left ventricular wall thickness was assessed echocardiographically, and epicardial coronary anatomy was evaluated by quantitative coronary angiography. Coronary vasodilator reserve (CVDR) was measured in all patients with a coronary Doppler catheter and a maximally vasodilating dose of intracoronary papaverine. CVDR measured in the transplant recipients with normal coronary arteries, left ventricular function, and wall thickness (5.0 +/- 0.3 [mean +/- SEM] peak/resting velocity; range, 3.8-7.3; n = 16) was not different from that of normal subjects (4.8 +/- 0.2; range, 3.7-8.3). CVDR in the five cardiac allograft recipients with diffuse coronary atherosclerosis producing 30 +/- 5% narrowing (range, 25-38%) of epicardial vessel diameter also was normal (5.1 +/- 0.3; range, 4.3-6.2; n = 5). The CVDR was reduced, however, in two of the four cardiac allograft recipients with left ventricular hypertrophy. In the only transplant recipient in whom a regional wall motion abnormality was present, CVDR was abnormal in the vascular distribution of the hypokinetic wall segment (1.8) but was normal in the artery that supplied normally functioning myocardium (4.0). These findings demonstrate that in the absence of allograft rejection, acquired left ventricular hypertrophy, and regional wall motion abnormalities, coronary vasodilator reserve is normal after orthotopic human cardiac transplantation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Augmented right heart cooling (RHC) with bicaval cannulation, pulmonary artery venting, and intracavitary cooling has been advocated for prevention of right ventricular failure and supraventricular tachyarrhythmias after open heart surgery. To evaluate RHC, 78 patients undergoing coronary bypass surgery were prospectively randomized to receive added RHC (n = 38) or standard protection with single atrial cannulation (SC) (n = 40). RHC and SC patients were similar regarding right coronary artery occlusion (n = 10 and 12, respectively), number of grafts performed (3.7 +/- 1.0 and 3.4 +/- 0.9), and cross-clamp time per graft (10.2 +/- 1.8 and 9.8 +/- 2.3 minutes). RHC led to significantly lower right atrial (11.6 degrees +/- 1.0 degree vs. 19.5 degrees +/- 3.3 degrees C) and right ventricular (7.2 degrees +/- 1.9 degrees vs. 12.2 degrees +/- 1.9 degrees C) temperatures. There was no detectable deterioration in right heart function or left heart function in either group after cardiopulmonary bypass. Bypass time was longer in RHC patients (86.7 +/- 17.9 vs. 76.0 +/- 18.2 minutes, p less than 0.05). Technical problems related to multiple cannulation occurred in four RHC patients. After cross-clamp removal, creatine kinase-MB levels were significantly higher with RHC at 2 hours (14.2 +/- 7.6 vs. 6.4 +/- 4.6 IU/l, p less than 0.001), 12 hours (19.1 +/- 19.5 vs. 8.6 +/- 10.3 IU/l, p less than 0.005), and 24 hours (14.1 +/- 19.6 vs. 7.1 +/- 9.2 IU/l, p less than 0.05). Mortality and morbidity were similar in the two groups. In particular, supraventricular tachyarrythmias occurred in 11 (28.9%) RHC and 10 (25%) SC patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Experimentally, 45 isolated perfused newborn rabbit hearts (age, 0-2 days) underwent 2 hours of global ischemia at 15 degrees C with a single dose of GIK cardioplegic solution and were subsequently assigned to three groups: Group 1 hearts (n = 15) were infused with basic GIK cardioplegic solution alone (no added calcium, but measured at 0.1-0.2 mM/l); Group 2 hearts (n = 15) received GIK cardioplegic solution with calcium (1.2 mM); and Group 3 hearts (n = 15) received GIK cardioplegic solution with calcium and a PGI2 analogue (OP-41483, 300 micrograms/l).

  ".W": "Refractory cardiac transplant rejection is a major therapeutic dilemma. The effectiveness of methotrexate (MTX) in autoimmune diseases prompted us to explore its efficacy in 10 cardiac transplant recipients, aged 20-53 years (39 +/- 13 years; mean +/- SD), with biopsy evidence of drug-refractory cardiac allograft rejection. Nine cardiac transplant recipients were maintained on triple antirejection therapy (cyclosporine, azathioprine, and prednisone), and the remaining recipient was maintained on cyclosporine and prednisone. Rejection episodes treated with MTX occurred 20-422 days (165 +/- 137 days) after transplantation and were the sixth episode of rejection for one recipient, the third for four recipients, the second for four recipients, and the first for one recipient. Before MTX administration, cardiac allograft rejection persisted despite intensified immunosuppression including OKT3 antibody. MTX, given intravenously, orally, or by both routes at a dose of 10-175 mg (85 +/- 62 mg), reversed rejection in nine of 10 recipients (90%) within 7-63 days (26 +/- 18 days). Elevated pulmonary artery wedge pressures were reduced to normal levels after MTX therapy (15.2 +/- 3.5 before vs. 10.6 +/- 3.0 mm Hg after; p less than 0.05). Leukopenia occurred in five cardiac transplant recipients after treatment with MTX. Adverse reactions to MTX resolved after MTX therapy was discontinued in all but one recipient. This recipient received one of the larger MTX doses (150 mg) and developed fatal Pseudomonas pneumonia. Twelve moderate rejection episodes recurred in nine recipients, seven episodes of which were successfully re-treated with MTX. Two of these seven recipients have now been rejection-free for 15 months. Of five recurrent episodes of cardiac transplant rejection not treated with MTX, two could not be reversed and were fatal. MTX may be a valuable drug for reversing refractory cardiac allograft rejection. Before MTX therapy gains wider use, however, a clearer understanding of its enhanced ability to suppress the bone marrow is needed.\r"

Of the six patients who received the ventricular-assist pump, four received cardiac allografts after 3, 11, 21, and 31 days of pump support, respectively. Two patients died before transplantation; the causes of death were non-device-related complications. One additional patient died of Pseudomonas sepsis after staged cardiac transplantation. The remaining three patients are alive and have been followed up for as long as 2 years after staged cardiac transplantation. Of the two patients who were supported with the total artificial heart, one underwent staged cardiac transplantation after 11 days of support. Unfortunately, this patient succumbed to fungal sepsis 17 days later. The remaining patient, who received the total artificial heart after rejection of a transplanted heart, expired 379 days later before a suitable donor organ could be located. These experiences indicate that 1) the ventricular-assist pump and total artificial heart can provide reasonably safe effective circulatory support until a patient's overall physiological status is optimal, until a donor organ can be located for transplantation, or both; 2) there is a need for short-, intermediate-, and long-term support system capabilities; and 3) regardless of the patients' underlying pathology (ischemic versus nonischemic cardiomyopathy), in most instances, the simpler external ventricular-assist pump is capable of satisfactory hemodynamic circulatory assistance.\r"

Actuarial freedom from rejection was 60% and 28% at 30 days and 1 year, respectively. All but seven rejection episodes responded to initial steroid pulses or a modification of a maintenance cyclosporine and azathioprine regimen. The seven failures were rescued with further Minnesota ALG therapy. Few serious hematologic or allergic reactions to Minnesota ALG were observed, and no new malignancies occurred during the follow-up period. We conclude that Minnesota ALG is safe and effective in cardiac transplantation.\r"

  ".W": "The accessibility and success of cardiac transplantation promotes transplantation for a broad range of recipients, including those requiring intravenous inotropes or mechanical-assist devices. To determine if survival is dependent on preoperative requirements for hemodynamic support, we studied 230 patients who underwent transplant at the Loyola, Stanford, and UTAH programs from December 1, 1984 through November 30, 1986, and who were followed up for 34 months postoperatively. Group 1 (n = 132 of 230, 57%) patients required only oral medical therapy to maintain hemodynamic compensation; Group 2 (n = 69 of 230, 30%) patients were dependent on intravenous inotropic support; and Group 3 (n = 29 of 230, 13%) patients required mechanical assistance. Pretransplant characteristics showed that dilated cardiomyopathy was more common in Group 2 patients, and lower cardiac index and ejection fraction were more prevalent in Group 3 patients as expected. Although survival was lower in Group 3 only at 1 month (Group 1, 98.5%; Group 2, 92.8%; and Group 3, 86.2%; p less than 0.01), the survival advantage in Groups 1 and 2 was lost by 3 months, with 1-year survival rates of 88.6% in Group 1, 81.2% in Group 2, and 82.8% in Group 3. Allograft survival and cause of death were not different among the three groups. Acute rejection occurred at a lower monthly frequency in the first 4 months in Group 3 (Group 1, 0.47 +/- 0.03; Group 2, 0.47 +/- 0.05; and Group 3, 0.29 +/- 0.06; p less than 0.01), whereas infectious complications occurred at similar frequencies.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To increase the longevity of cardiac homografts, we performed percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) in five male patients (aged 45 +/- 7 years, mean +/- SEM); 17 lesions were dilated during eight procedures 83 +/- 11 months after cardiac transplant. PTCA was successful (greater than or equal to 20% change in vessel diameter) in 13 of 17 (76%) lesions (the degree of prePTCA stenosis was 84% +/- 3% vs. 40% +/- 4% postPTCA; p less than or equal to 0.01). Multiple PTCA procedures were performed for progressive coronary artery disease in two patients; in one patient, two procedures were 13 months apart, and, in the second patient, another three procedures were 2 and 6 months apart. Indications for PTCA included reversible thallium perfusion defects, segmental left ventricular wall-motion abnormalities, or both in the distribution of proximal coronary artery stenoses. No deterioration occurred in the four unsuccessful PTCA attempts (two patients with initial total occlusion, and two patients in whom the lesion could not be crossed with a guidewire). Noninvasive evidence of ischemia was improved immediately after PTCA in all cases. Three patients remain alive 5, 7, and 11 months, respectively, after PTCA without evidence of new ischemia. One patient died 39 months after his first PTCA, while another patient was retransplanted 8 months after the first PTCA. Thus, PTCA can be performed in cardiac transplant patients with proximal major vessel coronary artery disease and may prolong cardiac homograft function.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We examined the potential role of magnetic resonance imaging with gadolinium (Gd)-diethylenetriamine penta-acetic acid (DTPA) image enhancement for the diagnosis of cardiac graft rejection. We studied 15 rats with heterotopic cardiac transplants, nine of which received no immunosuppression, and six of which received cyclosporine, azathioprine, and methylprednisolone. The animals underwent magnetic resonance imaging, which was immediately followed by sacrifice (2-12 days after transplant). Myocardial image enhancement was assessed on T1-weighted images performed before and after administration of Gd-DTPA, 0.5 mmol/kg. Histological specimens were graded I, II, or III to indicate increasing severity of rejection. In the absence of rejection, Gd-DTPA induced mild homogeneous myocardial enhancement. Ten of 11 cases with Grade II or III rejection manifested one or more areas of intense myocardial enhancement. The extent and distribution of intense myocardial enhancement corresponded to the severity and distribution of histological rejection. Quantitative myocardial enhancement, expressed as the ratio of maximal signal intensity after Gd-DTPA to signal intensity before Gd-DTPA administration, separated Grade I animals (1.61 +/- 0.27; mean +/- SD) from Grades II (2.89 +/- 0.58) and III (3.10 +/- 0.77; p less than 0.01) animals. In conclusion, cardiac transplant rejection is characterized by intense T1-weighted image enhancement after administration of Gd-DTPA. Magnetic resonance imaging with Gd-DTPA thus has potential application in the clinical diagnosis of cardiac transplant rejection.\r"

In these patients, the diagnosis of rejection is obtained from serial endomyocardial biopsy. The absence of clinical symptoms associated with allograft rejection with cyclosporine therapy has necessitated a predetermined routine biopsy frequency that averages 10-15 biopsies per patient in the first posttransplant year. Traditionally, fluoroscopy has been used to guide the biopsy, but this technique has a number of negative features, including cumulative radiation exposure in the physician and the patient, limited portability, and the limited area of access (intraventricular septum) for biopsy. In contrast, echocardiography provides greater portability and flexibility for location of procedure performance, eliminates radiation exposure, provides important information about cardiac function, and safely allows biopsy of any area of the right ventricle, including the free wall and apex. We performed over 4,700 individual biopsies for evaluation of rejection in 58 patients who underwent orthotopic cardiac transplantation. Fluoroscopy was not required for any of the echocardiography-guided biopsies, and only two complications occurred in 4,700 biopsies. We propose, therefore, that echocardiography is a useful alternative or adjunct to fluoroscopy for guiding endocardial biopsy and is a technique that can be learned easily by anyone now performing biopsies.\r"

Thus, we could clearly and continuously monitor the biopsy needle and transverse plane of the kidney during the biopsy. We obtained diagnostically sufficient renal specimens in all subjects and found no significant complications, including macroscopic hematuria, in any case. We found that our method simultaneously visualized the biopsy needle and kidney much more clearly and made the biopsy far easier and safer than any other method previously proposed and we recommend the procedure be widely used in adult as well as child patients.\r"

  ".W": "Chronic renal failure patients on dialysis have an increased susceptibility to infection. Previous studies have demonstrated that these patients have a decreased in vitro neutrophil (PMN) chemotactic response and a reduction in C5a receptor availability on both PMN and monocytes. This study was designed to determine if other chemotactic factor-mediated responses of PMN and monocytes from hemodialysis (HD) and continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients are abnormal. The responses investigated included in vitro chemotaxis, superoxide generation, H2O2 production, and myeloperoxidase (MPO) release. These studies showed that PMN from HD and CAPD patients are significantly decreased in their chemotactic response to both C5a and fMLP when compared to normal controls. The response of HD patient's PMN to C5a was decreased by an average of 55.1% (p less than 0.005) and for CAPD patients by 49.7% (p less than 0.01). Similarly, chemotactic responses to fMLP were decreased by an average of 44.7% (p less than 0.005) for HD patients and 36.3% (p less than 0.02) for CAPD patients. Superoxide anion production by PMN and monocytes from HD and CAPD patients in response to C5a and fMLP was also significantly decreased compared to controls. PMN superoxide production in response to C5a was decreased by an average of 36.5% (p less than 0.001) for HD patients and 32.0% (p less than 0.001) for CAPD patients. fMLP-stimulated production of superoxide was also decreased but to a lesser degree with a mean decrease of 18.0% (p less than 0.01) for HD patients and 24.1% decrease (p less than 0.01) for CAPD patients. This decreased responsiveness was restricted to C5a- and fMLP-stimulated superoxide production since phorbol myristate acetate (PMA)-stimulated responses were comparable to controls. A similar pattern of decreased superoxide production was found with monocytes from these patients. Comparable decreases in chemotactic factor-stimulated responses were also observed in a flow cytometric assay of H2O2 production in both PMN and monocytes and an in vitro assay of MPO release from PMN. Analysis of the binding of fluorescent C5a to PMN showed a direct correlation between decreased C5a binding and decreased O2- production and MPO release. Since all of these chemotactic factor-stimulated events are involved in the inflammatory process and the killing of microorganisms, alterations in these WBC functions in dialysis patients may contribute to their increased susceptibility to infection.\r"

Thirteen patients were given conventional immunosuppressive treatment (azathioprine and prednisone) and the other 25 received cyclosporine. The immunostaining was performed using seven antileucocyte antibodies by alkaline phosphatase-anti-alkaline phosphatase method. Interstitial infiltrates were distributed in two patterns: diffuse infiltrates and periglomerular/perivascular aggregates. The phenotypic composition was distinct in these two patterns: in diffuse infiltrates, monocytes/macrophages (EBM 11) represented the predominant inflammatory cell and were associated with a minor component of T cells (T 11). In contrast, aggregates had a major T lymphocyte phenotype in addition with few foci of B cells. T4 subset of T lymphocytes always predominated over T8 subset. The repartition and the proportion of each cell type were not significantly different in rejecting and not rejecting grafts and were not affected by the immunosuppressive regimen.\r"

  ".W": "Among children with asymptomatic hematuria, 28 cases of nonglomerular idiopathic renal bleeding were subjected to this series of study. Intra-arterial digital subtraction angiography (DSA) and/or renal venography were performed to investigate the hematuria of unknown etiology. DSA clearly demonstrated the entrapment of the left renal vein (LRV), or nutcracker phenomenon in the majority of our patients (22 out of 28 cases): obstruction of the LRV with well-developed collaterals were found in 8 cases, and in the remaining 14 cases, various degrees of LRV compression were demonstrated. A characteristic real-time DSA image was the congestion of LRV associated with collaterals and/or intermittent venous flow at the compressed segment of LRV. The pullback pressures from LRV to the inferior vena cava (IVC) that were obtained from 5 of these patients demonstrated gradients of 2 mmHg (3 cases), 3 mmHg (1 case), and 5 mmHg (1 case), respectively. The parallel application of ultrasonography has given positive signs for LRV entrapment, although they have not necessarily coincided with the existing criteria of nutcracker phenomenon. Considering the high incidence of LRV entrapment among children with nonglomerular hematuria, most nutcracker phenomenon should be diagnosed on ultrasonography. However, intra-arterial DSA is an important tool to establish the disease entity and ultrasonic criteria.\r"

One major spot and three minor spots were detected in the ultrafiltrate as well as in the serum. One major spot was determined to be native beta 2M and three minor spots were found to be novel beta 2M. Novel beta 2M had a lower molecular weight (MW) and a higher acidic isoelectric point (pI). Novel beta 2M was recognized in the sera of 5 out of 20 hemodialysis (HD) patients without carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS), 2 of whom had been on HD from 5 to 10 years and 3 for more than 10 years, as well as in the sera of all 10 patients with CTS. By chromatofocusing, pI of novel beta 2M was 5.2, while pI of native beta 2M was 5.7. When the tissue specimen of transverse carpal ligament of 2 HD patients with CTS was examined by immunoblotting after 2.DE, the spot of novel beta 2M was larger than that of native beta 2M. It is possible that some metabolic abnormality of beta 2M occurs through long-term hemodialysis, and it is possible that novel beta 2M might relate to amyloidogenic predisposition.\r"

Seven of them have been transplanted. The evaluation of the clinical and biological parameters serum protein, phosphate, calcium, revealed acceptable values. Hemoglobin rose during the treatment period. Hypertension improved and medication was reduced. HbAlc levels were near normal with subcutaneous application of insulin. Peritonitis rate was 1/18 patient-months. Survival rate was comparable with other centers with 83% in the first and 62% in the second year. In 7 patients that have been transplanted no CAPD-related problems arose after transplantation. 6 of them are still doing well; one returned to CAPD because of graft failure. In conclusion, because of good control of hypertension, blood glucose and anemia and the avoidance of fluctuating volumes, we think CAPD to be the best method for diabetics awaiting transplantation and for those that cannot be transplanted.\r"

Several gastrointestinal hormones were found to induce splanchnic vasodilation and to augment the effective vascular surface. Different prostanoids, histamine, and bradykinin influence peritoneal mass transfer by increasing vascular permeability. Vasodilative acting drugs, diuretics and surface active compounds were found to augment peritoneal solute clearances and water efflux by acting on peritoneal vessels or the serosal surface of the peritoneal membrane. Hyperosmolar dialysis solutions increase ultrafiltration and contribute to total peritoneal clearance by convective transport. The present paper aims to summarize the current knowledge on pharmacological and physiological manipulation of peritoneal transport function and to show some ways of its clinical use.\r"

With increasing time of dialysis the alterations become more pronounced. So far a difference in the immune status of CAPD patients compared to HD patients has not been proven. The impairment of immune response might be less than in HD patients. The mechanism of this difference is not established. However, the question of immune response in uremia and its alteration by different forms of dialysis treatment is only in part and insufficiently investigated. Studies in CAPD patients have only a very preliminary character.\r"

Peritonitis incidence and in vitro bacterial opsonization has been shown to depend on IgG concentrations in the dialysate and on the ability of macrophages to produce fibronectin. Additionally, a high peritonitis incidence is associated with decreased bactericidal activity of macrophages; thus infective organisms may survive intracellularly despite intact phagocytosis. In some CAPD patients a disturbance in lymphokine and monokine release may be responsible for the reduced ability of their macrophages to kill bacteria.\r"

The problem of hypercalcemia and hyperphosphatemia can more easily controlled by CAPD than by hemodialysis. Total serum and ionized calcium levels are rapidly normalized by a CAPD regime of four 2-1 exchanges with 1.75 mmol/l Ca. Under the same CAPD regime 250-300 mg phosphate are removed per day. Depending on the ingestion of phosphate, 100-200 mg phosphate per day remain to be removed by phosphate binding agents. Since the main source of aluminum in CAPD patients is oral ingestion of aluminum-containing phosphate binders, serum levels should be regulated by diet and calcium carbonate. To suppress PTH secretion serum ionized calcium levels need to be maintained at the upper limit of normal. This can also be achieved by the use of oral calcium carbonate. Vitamin D or analogs should be prescribed only when clinically indicated by persistent hypocalcemia, osteitis fibrosa or non-aluminum related osteomalacia.\r"

The influence of various types of lesions on the growth rate and the healing process was documented. For Types I and II lesions there was a transitory growth arrest and an increased thickening of the zone of hypertrophic cells. The alterations regressed after Day 15, and by day 25, a nearly normal plate was seen. For Type III lesions an angular deformity of the tibia occurred that increased with time. For Type IV lesions, a step-off developed on the articular surface that became more severe with time. Early vascular anastomoses between the epiphysis and the metaphysis led to the formation of bone bridges in Type III and Type IV lesions.\r"

In order to achieve the necessary balance between benefits and risks with these valuable forms of therapy, patients should be referred to dermatologists with special training.\r"

Appropriate therapy for PMS is more than a pill, more than changing attitudes, more than removing stress from one's life. Indeed, therapy for PMS is not always easy, for the problems that preceded the PMS may persist and the problems created by the PMS may be slow to heal. However, the good news is that most women with PMS will experience significant improvement in their sense of well-being and their quality of life with appropriate and multidisciplinary therapy.\r"

  ".W": "Ideal anesthetic management consists of the preanesthetic attainment of a state in which a diagnostic or therapeutic procedure or surgical operation can be performed with as little physiologic and psychologic trauma as possible, and the likelihood of a speedy and uneventful postoperative course is enhanced. Significant impairment of cardiovascular, respiratory, renal and other organ system functions is common in patients facing surgery. Thus, it is imperative that preoperative evaluation be complete. Signs of congestive heart failure, myocardial ischemia or infarction or both, hypertension, electrolyte abnormalities, and cardiac arrhythmias should be aggressively sought and treated before surgery. In addition, before the induction of anesthesia, information must be obtained about the specific associated pathologies (cardiac and otherwise), drugs being used to treat these conditions, and the adequacy of the current therapies. The preoperative evaluation does not begin with the anesthesiologist's visit, but with the evaluation and care given by the primary physician. A team approach is advisable in complex cases. Appropriate consultations, including that of the anesthesiologist, should be made in a timely fashion. Except in emergency situations, the temptation to send incompletely evaluated and treated patients to the operating room should be resisted. Good preoperative preparation will improve the chances for a successful outcome.\r"

The epidermal reactivity to a panel of lectins and human antisera to pemphigus vulgaris and bullous pemphigoid antigens was compared with samples obtained from normal skin and from skin under tape occlusion. We observed selective perturbations of lectin and antibody binding in acute contact dermatitis, whether allergic or irritant. The main findings were a loss of terminal sialic acids and longer bi- and triantennary mannosyl residues as well as a loss of pemphigus vulgaris antigen. The only difference between allergic and irritant patch test reactions was in topography of loss of WGA binding sites: in the former, it was most pronounced in the lower and middle epidermis, whereas in the latter it was seen in the uppermost subcorneal layers. Our findings support a common pathway of cell membrane alterations of keratinocytes in acute contact dermatitis.\r"

The results were compared with those of a control group of patients with OSA who did not receive NCPAP. Two of six mood factors, depression and fatigue, improved significantly following treatment with NCPAP. Total Mood Disturbance (TMD) score was used to assess global mood differences. The mean TMD score for the patients before treatment was 1.7 and during treatment decreased to -7.6 (p less than 0.05). This mean decrease of 9.3 in the TMD score implies generalized improvement in mood. These findings support the opinion that sleep fragmentation and abnormalities of respiration during sleep are at least partially responsible for affective changes seen in sleep apnea. These psychologic disturbances improve after treatment with NCPAP.\r"

The expression of c-myc oncogene was greatly enhanced in all cases studied, with individual and cell-to-cell variation. In contrast, all of the specimens incubated with deoxyribonuclease after the standard pretreatment with ribonuclease T1 were negative for the expression of c-myc oncogene. The in situ hybridization permits estimation of a heterogeneous amplification of c-myc oncogene that may be related to secondary alterations occurring during the progression of the malignant lung tumors.\r"

Control lymphocytes from normal subjects, as well as from patients receiving amiodarone but without pneumonitis, failed to elaborate LIF in the presence of the drug in this test. This production of LIF suggests that pneumonitis associated with amiodarone therapy is also associated with a specific cellular immune response to the drug.\r"

This form of pulmonary edema appears to be related to markedly negative intrathoracic pressure due to forced inspiration against a closed upper airway resulting in transudation of fluid from pulmonary capillaries to the interstitium. Postanesthetic laryngospasm is the most common cause of pulmonary edema in adults (11/26 cases). The edema usually clears rapidly with supportive care. Aggressive diagnostic and therapeutic interventions may be avoided if the syndrome is recognized. Maintenance of oxygenation and a patent airway are the mainstays of treatment.\r"

We determined the frequency and types of infections identified, and the relationship to time after transplantation. Infection was found in 70 of the 111 cases (63 percent) and cytomegalovirus (CMV) was present in 90 percent of all cases with infection. Infection was identified in only five of 26 (19 percent) cases within the first 30 days after transplant, and when present, was viral. The prevalence of infection after 30 days (over 75 percent of 85 cases) was significantly higher (chi 2 = 26.2, p = 0.00001). Bacterial or yeast infections were found in only four cases (4 percent) (two cases each), and Pneumocystis carinii in six cases (6 percent). Simultaneous infection with two or more organisms was found in four cases (4 percent). Four of 25 autopsies performed within ten days after OLB revealed fungal infections with Aspergillus not detected at OLB. Thus, the prevalence of infection detected by OLB is low within the first 30 days after marrow transplantation among patients receiving broad spectrum antibiotics. CMV infection is found in most transplantation recipients who undergo OLB with diffuse infiltrates between days 30 and 180.\r"

  ".W": "We reviewed the literature evaluating pediatric asthma education interventions to assess their impact on morbidity (school absences and health care utilization). Thirteen studies were analyzed, most of which reported favorable outcomes. Of the ten studies reporting on school absences, only seven used tests of statistical significance when reporting on postintervention reductions, and of those, only two found a significant decrease in absenteeism. Similarly, among the studies reporting on utilization, not all used tests of statistical significance when reporting on postintervention decreases in physician visits, ER visits, and hospitalization. Only four of the ten studies used adequate sample sizes to detect a 20 percent reduction in school absences, and stratification of the sample by severity of asthma suggests that some programs do reduce health care utilization among those children with more severe disease. We conclude that the effectiveness of asthma educational programs on reducing school absences and health care utilization may be small. These programs are best directed toward children with moderate or severe disease. Finally, it is important for pediatricians, children with asthma, and their families to have realistic expectations about what these programs may accomplish.\r"

Autopsy showed enlarged heart, normal coronary arteries, right ventricular septal hypertrophy, quadricuspid pulmonary valve, accessory tricuspid valve, and a moderately elongated and thickened mitral valve. Conduction system revealed that the penetrating bundle was pushed to the left side of the summit of the ventricular septum by the right ventricular septal hypertrophy; it was lobulated and showed fatty-fibrous changes. These findings extended throughout the beginning of the bundle branches. We conclude that in this patient with familial sudden death and normal QT interval, the abnormal right ventricular septal hypertrophy altered the course and produced degenerative changes in the conduction system, which may have caused sudden death.\r"

However, these studies have been performed primarily in patients without tachycardia. To determine the effect of acute changes in heart rate on PA AT, atrial pacing studies were performed in seven closed-chest pigs. Pulsed Doppler PA flow velocity recordings were obtained from a parasternal position at pacing rates from 100 to 140 beats/min. PA pressure remained constant (mean +/- SD = 14 +/- 5 mm Hg) over the entire range of paced rates. When PA Doppler measurements were compared at heart rates of 100 and 140 beats/min, there were decreases at the higher heart rate in both acceleration time (110 +/- 12 vs 83 +/- 11 ms, p less than 0.01) and ejection time (ET) (315 +/- 23 vs 237 +/- 21 ms, p less than 0.01). In contrast, there was no change in either PA peak flow velocity (69 +/- 15 vs 62 +/- 18 cm/s) or the ratio of AT/ET (0.35 +/- .02 vs. .36 +/- .03). Consequently, when estimating PA pressure in states of tachycardia, the PA AT/ET ratio may be a more useful measurement than PA acceleration time.\r"

No hyperplastic polyp gave a positive ratio, but about 30 percent of villous lesions were positive. Over 50 percent of villous lesions greater than 2 cm in size had a positive ratio. The malignancy potential ratio may be a valuable marker in assessing risk of malignancy in an individual case.\r"

  ".W": "We have proposed that gastric peristaltic activity is primarily responsible for ulcerogenesis in the phenylbutazone-treated rat and that acid plays only a synergistic role. This study examines the effect of graded doses of the H2 blocker cimetidine on acid secretion and ulcerogenesis occurring during insulin-induced peristalsis in the indomethacin (Indo) -pretreated rat. The second part of the study utilizes graded gastric distension with exogenous acid to examine the role of the forceful apposition of the mucosal folds during peristalsis in lesion genesis. It is demonstrated that the inhibition of acid secretion by cimetidine reduces but does not prevent ulceration. Gastric inflation with acid obliterates mucosal folding, prevents mucosal apposition during peristalsis, and abolishes ulcerogenesis. It is concluded that mucosal compression is the primary cause of the linear lesions along the base of the mucosal folds but that acid is necessary to extend the lesions once initiated.\r"

  ".W": "Slow-moving proteinase (SMP), pepsinogen I (PG I), and pepsinogen II (PG II) are aspartic proteinases normally found in gastric mucosa. Because of differences in their cellular origins, normal gastric epithelial cells can be phenotyped by immunohistochemical staining with a panel of antisera to each proteinase. In this study, we determined aspartic proteinase phenotypes of malignant cells in 74 cases of gastric cancer by immunohistochemical staining with rabbit antiserum to human SMP, PG I, and PG II. Of the 74 cancers, 20 were histologically of the diffuse type and 54 were of the intestinal (or mixed) type. Intestinal metaplasia was characterized by the presence of SMP (but not PG I or PG II) in absorptive epithelial cells. SMP was found in 40 (54%) of the cancers (vs 31% for PG II and only 5% for PG I) and in both the intestinal and diffuse types. Of the 40 SMP-positive cancers, 14 also expressed PG II. In the latter tumors, staining of adjacent sections revealed that some malignant cells expressed only SMP or only PG II, whereas others expressed both proteinases. Overall, 49 (66%) of the cancers contained cells with proteinase phenotypes characteristic of cells in nonmalignant gastric mucosa and 23% contained cells with proteinase phenotypes characteristic of more than one cell type. The results indicate that both intestinal- and diffuse-type gastric cancers often differentiate to cell types that produce aspartic proteinases and that about one fourth contain a heterogeneous population of malignant cells.\r"

Of these three classes of steroids only the gluco- and mineralocorticoid hormones are necessary to sustain life. The availability of sensitive and specific radioimmunoassays has permitted accurate measurement of practically every steroid hormone secreted by the adrenal cortex. As in other endocrinopathies, suppression studies are employed when hyperfunction is suspected, while provocative tests are used to detect hypofunction. These dynamic studies enable the clinician to evaluate the functional status of the adrenal cortex. The anatomic configuration of the adrenal cortices is delineated by high-resolution computed tomography (and magnetic resonance imaging), obviating the need for invasive procedures such as venography or arteriography. The disorders of the adrenal cortex can be viewed from the dual perspectives of hyperfunction and hypofunction. Clinical expressions of hyperfunctional adrenocortical syndromes include Cushing's syndrome, primary hyperaldosteronism, and the adrenogenital syndrome. The expressions of hypofunctional syndromes include Addison's disease and selective hypoaldosteronism. The diagnosis and treatment of these disorders are outlined in this issue.\r"

  ".W": "Hysteroscopy has evolved from a diagnostic procedure into a therapeutic method for a variety of conditions. Instruments specifically designed for hysteroscopic operative procedures have improved. The indications for therapeutic hysteroscopy are increasing and its proper applications can improve patient's gynecologic care. These facts should stimulate the gynecologist to become proficient with hysteroscopy for diagnosis and the treatment of many intrauterine abnormalities. In selected patients there are major advantages including the avoidance of a laparotomy with the potential sequelae that can follow operations requiring entrance into the peritoneal cavity. The operative techniques have been refined and, with experience, good postoperative results and low morbidity have become evident. The septate uterus can be treated by hysteroscopic metroplasty with improved reproductive outcome. Symptomatic submucous myomas in selected patients can be removed hysteroscopically. Lysis of intrauterine adhesions has become the standard method of therapy. Foreign bodies lost in the uterine cavity or embedded IUDs can be removed atraumatically under direct vision. As the approach to intrauterine problems is refined, other applications are being investigated such as tubal cannulation, endoscopic chorionic villus sampling, and application of hysteroscopy to new reproductive technologies such as the placement of gametes in the fallopian tubes. Because of the simplicity of approaching the uterotubal ostia transcervically, hysteroscopy remains in the front line of investigation as a possible approach for inducing tubal occlusion as a permanent or temporary method of contraception. Finally, laser energy is being used in patients with intractable uterine bleeding to photocoagulate the endometrium and to create amenorrhea by means of inducing severe intrauterine adhesions.\r"

  ".U": "89031700\r", 
  ".W": "The influence of cyclic AMP (cAMP) and extracellular calcium on phosphoinositide (PI) hydrolysis in isolated islets was assessed and related to insulin output. Three stimulants were chosen to activate the beta-cell: sulfated cholecystokinin (CCK-8S, 200 nM), high-level glucose (20 mM), and the sulfonylurea tolbutamide (200 microM). The insulin secretory response to all three agonists was amplified by forskolin (which increases cAMP levels) and reduced by nitrendipine (which decreases calcium influx). All three stimulants increased the hydrolysis of inositol-containing phospholipids, an event monitored by an increase in [3H]inositol efflux from [3H]inositol-prelabeled islets and by the accumulation of labeled inositol phosphates. Forskolin, despite its positive impact on insulin secretion, reduced [3H]inositol efflux and inositol phosphate accumulation in response to all agonists. A similar inhibitory effect on these parameters was noted with nitrendipine; however, nitrendipine abolished secretion in response to all agonists. These findings support the following conclusions: 1) an increase in cellular cAMP levels reduces the quantitative impact of various agonists on these indices of PI hydrolysis; 2) despite this inhibitory effect, cAMP amplifies the insulin secretory response to these agonists; and 3) extracellular calcium is a crucial determinant of both PI hydrolysis and the ensuing insulin secretory response.\r"

  ".W": "The CDP-choline pathway is the major route of phosphatidylcholine (PC) biosynthesis in mammalian cells. The incorporation of [14C]choline into PC of isolated pancreatic islets of the rat was time dependent, glucose stimulable, and inhibited by mannoheptulose. Removal of extracellular Ca2+ enhanced glucose-stimulated choline incorporation without affecting basal levels. Glucose stimulated PC synthesis in islets labeled to equilibrium with 32PO4 in the presence or absence of extracellular Ca2+. The water-soluble intermediates of the CDP-choline pathway, phosphorylcholine and CDP-choline, accumulated to a lesser extent under Ca2+-free conditions; however, glucose enhanced the levels of these intermediates in the presence and absence of Ca2+. Thus, glucose stimulates CDP-choline-pathway activity. Ca2+-free conditions may promote flux of choline intermediates through the pathway and retard the hydrolysis of PC. The phospholipase A2-activating agents delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol and melittin enhanced [3H]choline incorporation into PC and potentiated incorporation in response to a submaximal secretagogic concentration of glucose (8.5 mM); insulin release paralleled the changes in PC. p-Bromophenacyl bromide and mepacrine reduced islet glucose utilization and glucose-stimulated [3H]choline levels in PC. An inhibitor of CTP: phosphorylcholine cytidylyltransferase, 5'-deoxy-5'-isobutylthioadenosine, reduced glucose-stimulated [14C]choline incorporation into PC; insulin release was inhibited in a parallel fashion. Thus, islet PC turnover and CDP-choline pathway activity appear to be modulated by glucose metabolism and membrane phospholipid hydrolysis. PC turnover and insulin release appear to be related.\r"

  ".W": "To investigate mechanisms underlying biosynthetic regulation of an insulin gene, the rat insulin II gene was introduced into hamster beta-cells (HIT) by cotransfection with the neomycin phosphotransferase-selectable marker. The insulin gene fragment was 2.2 kilobases (kb) in length and contained all exons, introns, and approximately 700 base pairs (bp) of 5'-flanking DNA and 300 bp of 3'-flanking DNA. The HIT cell was known to have endogenous hamster insulin production under regulation by glucose and dexamethasone. In a pool of stably transfected cells (HIT M62pR2), rat insulin II and hamster insulin were produced at comparable rates. Glucose (20 mM) stimulated cellular [3H]leucine labeling of both hamster insulin and rat insulin II by approximately twofold. Addition of 10(-6) M dexamethasone to media containing 11.1 mM glucose inhibited biosynthesis of both hamster insulin and rat insulin II by greater than 90%. Thus, with both positive and negative biosynthetic regulation, changes in the cellular labeling of exogenous rat insulin II were qualitatively and quantitatively similar to those of the endogenous hamster insulin. These data suggest that the 2.2-kb rat insulin II gene fragment contained sufficient information for both expression and apparently \"normal\" biosynthetic regulation of exogenous rat insulin II (when compared with endogenous hamster insulin) in response to glucose and dexamethasone.\r"

Insulin binding was reduced to 18.8 and 27.7% of control value, respectively. In contrast, IGF-I binding was normal in both patients. In competitive binding studies, IGF-I had 0.2% of the ability of insulin to compete with 125I-labeled insulin binding, and insulin had 0.1% of the ability of IGF-I to compete with 125I-labeled IGF-I binding in control subjects and patient fibroblasts. The dose-response curves of insulin stimulation assessed by glucose incorporation and alpha-aminoisobutyric acid uptake showed normal responsiveness, and ED50 was significantly shifted to the right in fibroblasts from both patients. However, normal responsiveness and sensitivity were observed in thymidine incorporation studies. For IGF-I, dose-response curves of glucose incorporation, alpha-aminoisobutyric acid uptake, and thymidine incorporation were all normal in both patients. These results indicate that 1) the defect is specific to the insulin-receptor binding in these patients, 2) insulin and IGF-I activate glucose incorporation and alpha-aminoisobutyric acid uptake mainly through their own specific receptors, but 3) the IGF-I receptor appears to have a more important role in stimulating thymidine incorporation than the insulin receptor in physiological condition or, alternatively, an unknown postreceptor process with cascade signal transmission may overcome the decreased insulin-receptor binding to produce a normal dose-response curve.\r"

  ".W": "Glucose usage by soluble fractions of cell extracts from two insulin-producing cell lines, RINm5F and HIT, was investigated. Analysis of enzyme activities indicated that glucose phosphorylation and phosphofructokinase are likely to be the rate-limiting steps of glycolysis in both RINm5F and HIT cell extracts. RINm5F extracts, which lack glucokinase, exhibited relatively flat concentration-dependency curves of glucose usage and showed substantial inhibition of hexokinase. HIT cell extracts, which contain glucokinase but lack hexokinase, exhibited sigmoidal concentration-dependency curves of glucose usage, reflecting almost fully expressed glucokinase activity. A reconstituted system prepared from RINm5F and HIT cell extracts exhibited a composite concentration-dependency curve of glucose usage and showed substantial inhibition of hexokinase and almost fully expressed glucokinase. However, conditions that activate phosphofructokinase, such as addition of ammonium sulfate or fructose 2,6-bisphosphate or alkalization, removed the inhibition of hexokinase without noticeably affecting the glucokinase component of usage. Results obtained with a reconstituted system containing RINm5F cell extract and purified glucokinase were consistent with these findings. The data presented here indicate that this reconstituted cell-free system serves as a valid model for the study of aspects of glycolytic control in the islet. This model illustrates the preeminent role of glucokinase in the control of glycolysis, consistent with its glucose-sensor function in the islet. In addition, these studies help to define the contribution of phosphofructokinase to the control of glycolysis and the mechanism whereby changes in phosphofructokinase activity could modulate, via changes in the glucose 6-phosphate concentration, the activity of hexokinase and hence the net glycolytic flux.\r"

  ".U": "89031708\r", 
  ".W": "To assess the role of counterregulatory hormones per se in the response to continuous insulin infusion, overnight-fasted dogs were given 5 mU.kg-1.min-1 insulin intraportally either alone (INS, n = 5), with glucose to maintain euglycemia (INS + GLU, n = 5), or with glucose and hormone replacement [i.e., glucagon, epinephrine, norepinephrine, and cortisol infusions (INS + GLU + HR, n = 6)]. The increases in counterregulatory hormones that occurred during insulin-induced hypoglycemia were simulated in the latter group. In this way, it was possible to separate the effects of hypoglycemia per se from those due to the associated counterregulatory hormone response. Glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis were measured with a combination of tracer ([ 3-3H]glucose and [U-14C]alanine) and hepatic arteriovenous (AV) difference techniques during a 40-min control and a 180-min experimental period. Insulin levels increased similarly in all groups (to congruent to 250 microU/ml), whereas plasma glucose levels decreased in INS (115 +/- 3 to 41 +/- 3 mg/dl; P less than .05) and rose slightly in both INS + GLU (108 +/- 2 to 115 +/- 4 mg/dl; P less than .05) and INS + GLU + HR (111 +/- 3 to 120 +/- 3 mg/dl; P less than .05) due to glucose infusion. Glucagon, epinephrine, norepinephrine, and cortisol were replaced in INS + GLU + HR so that the increments in their levels were 102 +/- 6, 106 +/- 14, 117 +/- 9, and 124 +/- 37%, respectively, of their increments in INS. At no time was there a significant difference between the hormone levels in INS and INS + GLU + HR. The rise in the counterregulatory hormones per se accounted for only half (53 +/- 9% by the AV difference method and 54 +/- 10% by tracer method) of the glucose production associated with hypoglycemia resulting from insulin infusion. The rate and efficiency of alanine conversion to glucose in the hormone-replacement studies were only 29 +/- 10 and 50 +/- 27% of what occurred during hypoglycemia induced by insulin infusion. In conclusion, the counterregulatory hormones alone (i.e., without accompanying hypoglycemia) can account for only 50% of the glucose production that is present during insulin-induced hypoglycemia. The remaining 50%, therefore, must result from effects of hypoglycemia other than its ability to trigger hormone release.\r"

  ".W": "CS-045 is a new oral antidiabetic agent that was effective in insulin-resistant diabetic animal models, including the KK mouse, the ob/ob mouse, and the Zucker fatty rat. CS-045 was not effective in the streptozocin-treated mouse, an insulin-deficient diabetic animal model. In fed KK mice, CS-045 lowered the plasma glucose levels in a dose-dependent manner after a single oral administration, and the hypoglycemic effect lasted for at least 18 h. In normal rats, however, plasma glucose levels were not changed after administration of CS-045. CS-045 when given chronically (2 wk) to diabetic KK and ob/ob mice as a 0.2% food admixture dramatically improved hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, and hypertriglyceridemia to near-normal values and decreased plasma lactate, free fatty acid, and ketone body levels without reducing food intake or body weight. In the obese Zucker fatty rat, oral administration of CS-045 had a similar effect in lowering plasma glucose, insulin, triglyceride, free fatty acid, lactate, and ketone body levels. The CS-045-treated Zucker fatty rats showed increased glucose tolerance and decreased insulin secretion in response to oral glucose. After 9 days of treatment, insulin binding to adipocyte plasma membranes from both CS-045-treated Zucker fatty rats and KK mice was increased. Furthermore, 2-deoxyglucose uptake in CS-045-treated adipocytes was increased and the insulin dose-response curve was shifted to the left. These findings suggest that CS-045 increases not only insulin sensitivity but also insulin responsiveness. Based on its pharmacological profile, CS-045 is a new orally effective antidiabetic agent that may reduce abnormalities of glucose and lipid metabolism in obese and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus patients with insulin resistance.\r"

  ".W": "To clarify the effect of insulin on glucose-transporter (GT) biosynthesis, we determined GT mRNA levels in human cultured skin fibroblasts, using HepG2 GT cDNA as a probe. Insulin specifically increased the GT mRNA level in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Time-course study demonstrated that the mRNA level peaked within 3 h of insulin (1 x 10(-7) M) addition. After remaining elevated for several hours, mRNA decreased and returned to the basal level after 24 h. In the cell strains from seven normal subjects, the mean (+/- SE) GT mRNA level determined after 3 h of treatment with 1 x 10(-7) M insulin was 164.3 +/- 8.5% of the level found in untreated control cells. The insulin dose-response curve of GT mRNA levels showed that the maximum stimulation was elicited at 1 x 10(-7) M, and the half-maximum stimulation occurred at approximately 5 x 10(-10) M. Degradation rates of GT mRNA determined in the presence of actinomycin D were not different between insulin-treated and untreated cells. These results suggest that insulin increases GT gene expression in cultured human fibroblasts.\r"

We report that sera from newly diagnosed nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice similarly contain an autoantibody that immunoprecipitates 64K autoantigen from detergent lysates of [35S]methionine-labeled murine islet cells. The autoantibody was detectable by weaning; it disappeared within weeks after diabetes onset and was absent in older nondiabetic NOD mice as well as all of three non-diabetes-prone control strains tested. The 64K beta-cell autoantigen may be a critical target in the immunopathogenesis of IDDM.\r"

  ".W": "The results of a clinical trial comparing slow-release 5-aminosalicylic acid tablets (Pentasa) and enteric-coated sulfasalazine tablets (Salazopyrin) with regard to the efficacy of maintaining ulcerative colitis patients in remission for 12 mo and with regard to safety of treatment are reported. Seventy-five patients with ulcerative colitis in remission for between 1 mo and 5 yr were included for analysis. Forty-nine men and 26 women, aged between 18 and 79 yr, received either Pentasa t.i.d. (1500 mg) plus Salazopyrin placebo or Salazopyrin t.i.d. (3 g) plus Pentasa placebo daily. Patients were assessed clinically, endoscopically, and histologically before and 3, 6, 9, and 12 mo after the start of treatment. Life-table analysis showed ongoing remission after 6 and 12 mo for Pentasa to be 63% (26 of 41) and 54% (22 of 41) and for Salazopyrin 72% (22 of 31) and 46% (14 of 31). These differences were not statistically significant. Three patients treated with Salazopyrin were withdrawn because of severe erythrodermia, anxiety and backache, and pregnancy, respectively. One patient on Salazopyrin experienced transient rises in serum urea, creatinine, and lactic dehydrogenase and another patient in this group reported slight reversible loss of hair. In the Pentasa group no side effects were recorded. We conclude that Pentasa is a well-tolerated drug, equally effective as Salazopyrin in maintenance of remission of ulcerative colitis.\r"

After 4 wk of treatment control gastroscopy showed ulcer healing in 54 of 76 patients (71.1%) in the antacid group, as compared with 58 of 74 patients (78.4%) in the cimetidine-treated group. The difference in healing rate of 7.3% (95% confidence interval, -6.5% to +21.1%) was not statistically significant. The symptomatic effect, measured as number of days and nights with ulcer pain, was also quite similar in the two treatment groups. However, the number of days with pain was significantly lower in the first week of treatment in the antacid group (p less than 0.01). Thus, the efficacy of a low-dose antacid tablet regimen approximated that of cimetidine (800 mg nocte) in the treatment of duodenal ulcer patients.\r"

Stool wet weight increased by 68%, stool dry weight by 57%, fecal water content by 73%, and the mean transit time by 30% on acarbose. Breath hydrogen was significantly higher on acarbose, indicating stimulated carbohydrate fermentation in the colon. Fecal bacterial mass (+78%), total stool nitrogen (+53%), bacterial nitrogen (+200%), and stool fat (+56%) were higher in the acarbose than in the control period. The stimulation of fermentation in the human large intestine may be important in colonic and possibly other diseases.\r"

At entry, 67% (95% confidence limits, 61%-74%) complained of sexual dysfunction. Sexual dysfunction was significantly (p less than 0.05) associated with lower serum concentrations of testosterone, non-protein-bound testosterone, and non-sex hormone-binding globulin-bound testosterone. The significant associations between sexual dysfunction and non-protein-bound and non-sex hormone-binding globulin-bound testosterone concentrations disappeared, however, when age, ethanol consumption, and severity of liver disease were included as covariates in the analysis. During follow-up (median 30 mo, range 1-48 mo) sexual dysfunction improved significantly (p less than 0.05) at 6, 12, and 24 mo. Furthermore, the reported libido and erectile and ejaculatory function improved significantly at the end of the follow-up period (p less than 0.01). However, the testosterone-treated patients did not differ significantly from the placebo-treated patients regarding any of the changes in sexual function. In conclusion, oral testosterone treatment does not significantly influence the type or course of sexual dysfunction in alcoholic cirrhotic men. However, sexual function improved after reduction of ethanol consumption in these patients.\r"

Injection of GIP significantly increased superior mesenteric arterial flow in a dose-related manner (by 9%, 43%, and 139% at 30 s after an injection at the doses of 3, 50, and 800 pmol/kg, respectively). In contrast, celiac arterial flow was not significantly altered by GIP at any of the three doses. Calculated vascular resistance in the superior mesenteric artery decreased after GIP infusion, whereas that in the celiac artery was not changed by GIP. Pancreatic blood flow decreased significantly after GIP injection at the doses of 50 and 800 pmol/kg (by 11% and 17%, respectively). Our data indicate that there is a substantial difference in the hemodynamic responses to GIP among splanchnic organs, and suggest that GIP acts specifically on the mesenteric vasculature.\r"

  ".W": "We measured total blood volume (125I-albumin), cardiac dimensions and function (echocardiography with Doppler), systemic hemodynamics (blood pressure and pulse), and plasma renin activity and norepinephrine levels in cirrhotic patients with and without ascites to assess the likelihood that either diminished central or arterial filling is the stimulus to sodium retention. Patients with ascites (n = 9) had significantly increased total blood volume, cardiac output, pulse rate, plasma renin activity, and plasma norepinephrine concentration, as well as decreased systemic vascular resistance and arterial blood pressure compared with patients without ascites (n = 8). Left atrial size was similar in the two groups but significantly larger than in normal control subjects. Right and left atrial pressures were also similar in retrospectively studied patients with and without ascites. Sodium retention in cirrhosis is probably not triggered by diminished central filling. Increased blood volume is compatible with either a primary hepatorenal stimulus to sodium retention or a signal arising from a region of underfilling within an otherwise expanded circulation. If the latter model is correct, a \"hyperdynamic\" systemic circulation and increased plasma neurohormone concentrations may indicate \"effective\" arterial underfilling in patients with ascites.\r"

In four controlled studies that support an association between aortic stenosis and idiopathic gastrointestinal bleeding there are major methodologic deficiencies including the following: nonblinded data collection, noncomparable diagnostic examination, nonblinded ascertainment of exposure, and noncomparable demographic susceptibility. None of the studies directly assesses angiodysplasia. Additional case reports about aortic valve replacement used to treat bleeding from angiodysplasia are limited in number and in duration of follow-up. We conclude that the existing literature does not demonstrate an association between aortic stenosis and angiodysplasia. Further controlled evaluation of this topic would be useful.\r"
