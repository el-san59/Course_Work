The visual scores (severity score) were significantly higher on skin treated with cutting oil (positive control) compared to untreated skin (negative control). The corresponding mean SVL values were also significantly higher. We also assessed the effect of 2 barrier creams on the 9 guinea pigs' skin treated with cutting oil. The visual scores on skin treated with either barrier cream were significantly higher than positive control skin. The corresponding mean SVL values on skin treated with either barrier cream were also higher (not statistically significant). It appeared that the 2 barrier creams did not confer protection against the irritant effect of the cutting oil. On the contrary, barrier creams appeared to exacerbate the irritant effect of cutting oil.\r"

(40/690 subjects: 5.8%) were more common in younger age groups, in the allergic contact dermatitis group and in subjects who had used contact lens solutions. In the 40 thimerosal-positive patients, the minimum eliciting quantity of preservative was evaluated using different test concentrations: 0.05% and 0.01% pet. (patch testing) and 1:10,000 in saline (intradermal testing). Cross-reactions between thimerosal and other mercury compounds and sensitivity to thiosalicylic acid were also examined. The results of the investigation demonstrate that many of the reactions to 0.1% thimerosal are probably irritant, because only half the subjects studied had positive patch tests when allergen concentrations 5 to 10x lower than that conventionally used for patch testing, were utilized. In these subjects, the average strength of patch test reactions was higher, intradermal testing was more often positive and cross-reactions between mercurials more frequent. These data indicate that the optimal eliciting patch test concentration for studying thimerosal sensitivity is 0.05% pet.\r"

Blind reading was performed. A logistic dose-response model was applied to the challenge results. At 48 h, a linear relationship was obtained between the intradermal induction dose (but not topical dose) and the response, resulting in a maximum sensitization rate of 40% after 3% i.d. The reactivity disappeared at re-challenge 1 week later. Following a booster closed patch on day 35, using NiSO4 10% pet., the animals were challenged with NiSO4 2% pet. and statistical analyses of 72-h readings revealed a non-linear dose-response relationship, giving a maximum response frequency of 40% after initial induction with NiSO4 3% i.d. and 2% topical.\r"

We report the results of 297 patients, almost all with leg ulcers, concomitantly tested with chlorhexidine acetate 1% aq. and chlorhexidine gluconate 1% aq. 39 patients had positive reactions to one of these compounds or to both. 36 positive reactions to the acetate were found, in contrast to 18 reactions to the gluconate. The reactions were considered relevant in 22 of 39 patients, since these patients had developed an eczema in an area where a chlorhexidine compound was used, and discontinuing the chlorhexidine compound resulted in improvement of the condition. In 10 of these 22 patients, the diagnosis would have been missed if the gluconate only had been used for testing, while the acetate failed to diagnose 2 patients. In 109 patients without leg ulcers, inconclusive patch test readings (i.e., irritant reactions or weak positive reactions) were found in 17% with chlorhexidine acetate 1% aq., compared to 5% with chlorhexidine gluconate 1% aq., indicating a high degree of irritant potential of the acetate 1% aq. We consider that some positive reactions are lost if chlorhexidine gluconate 1% aq. only is used for patch testing, but that chlorhexidine acetate 1% aq., on the other hand, is an unacceptably strong irritant. We therefore suggest that further testing with chlorhexidine acetate 1 and 0.5% aq. should be performed, in parallel with chlorhexidine gluconate 1% aq., in order to establish appropriate test concentrations. We find that up to 13% of the leg ulcer patients in this study may be sensitized to chlorhexidine, and we recommend that the indications for the drug in leg ulcer patients should be reconsidered.\r"

This high incidence is still rising and is probably due to the frequent vaccinations which are performed in Austria. Most of the patch-test-positive patients had recently been immunized with thimerosal-containing vaccines, and no other obvious sources of exposure to thimerosal could be found. On retrospective questioning, 48 out of 50 patients had had no problems with their recent immunization; the 2 who reported massive local reactions had received their injections, against the recommendation of the manufacturer, subcutaneously. In a prospective study, 12 thimerosal-sensitized persons received their follow-up immunization at our department, and no side effects occurred. This enables us to conclude that sensitization had occurred through vaccines, but that those amounts of thimerosal delivered i.m. are not sufficient to elicit clinical symptoms. Patch-test positivity to thimerosal thus represents no contra-indication to i.m. immunization with thimerosal-containing vaccines.\r"

  ".W": "Diabetes mellitus is commonly associated with systolic/diastolic hypertension, and a wealth of epidemiological data suggest that this association is independent of age and obesity. Much evidence indicates that the link between diabetes and essential hypertension is hyperinsulinemia. Thus, when hypertensive patients, whether obese or of normal body weight, are compared with age- and weight-matched normotensive control subjects, a heightened plasma insulin response to a glucose challenge is consistently found. A state of cellular resistance to insulin action subtends the observed hyperinsulinism. With the insulin/glucose-clamp technique, in combination with tracer glucose infusion and indirect calorimetry, it has been demonstrated that the insulin resistance of essential hypertension is located in peripheral tissues (muscle), is limited to nonoxidative pathways of glucose disposal (glycogen synthesis), and correlates directly with the severity of hypertension. The reasons for the association of insulin resistance and essential hypertension can be sought in at least four general types of mechanisms: Na+ retention, sympathetic nervous system overactivity, disturbed membrane ion transport, and proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells. Physiological maneuvers, such as calorie restriction (in the overweight patient) and regular physical exercise, can improve tissue sensitivity to insulin; evidence indicates that these maneuvers can also lower blood pressure in both normotensive and hypertensive individuals. Insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia are also associated with an atherogenic plasma lipid profile. Elevated plasma insulin concentrations enhance very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) synthesis, leading to hypertriglyceridemia. Progressive elimination of lipid and apolipoproteins from the VLDL particle leads to an increased formation of intermediate-density and low-density lipoproteins, both of which are atherogenic. Last, insulin, independent of its effects on blood pressure and plasma lipids, is known to be atherogenic. The hormone enhances cholesterol transport into arteriolar smooth muscle cells and increases endogenous lipid synthesis by these cells. Insulin also stimulates the proliferation of arteriolar smooth muscle cells, augments collagen synthesis in the vascular wall, increases the formation of and decreases the regression of lipid plaques, and stimulates the production of various growth factors. In summary, insulin resistance appears to be a syndrome that is associated with a clustering of metabolic disorders, including non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, obesity, hypertension, lipid abnormalities, and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.\r"

More recently, it has also become apparent that similar metabolic abnormalities occur in rodent models of hypertension. One purpose of this article is to review the experimental data that have led to the above generalizations. The second goal is to address the significance of these findings, which is certainly not clear. For example, it could be argued that the relationship between high blood pressure and the associated metabolic defects is incidental. On the other hand, there is evidence that the changes in glucose, insulin, and lipoprotein metabolism may play a role in the etiology and/or clinical course of patients with high blood pressure. Although it is impossible at this point to definitively choose between these possibilities, an effort is made to marshal the evidence in support of the latter alternative.\r"

New information indicates that resistance to insulin action on glucose uptake in peripheral tissues is a common underlying mechanism in hypertension and diabetes. In prospective trials, the effects of antihypertensive agents on insulin sensitivity and lipoprotein metabolism have been evaluated. Both beta-blockers and thiazide diuretics worsen insulin resistance and deteriorate lipoprotein metabolism. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, Ca2(+)-channel blockers, and alpha-blockers are neutral or improve these factors. These data may explain the unexpectedly high incidence of the development of diabetes among treated hypertensives and the poor effect on risk for coronary heart disease in intervention trials.\r"

  ".W": "Contrasting results have been reported regarding the prevalence of hypertension in insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), showing a slightly higher or normal percentage of IDDM patients with elevated blood pressure levels than in the general population. Most of the cross-sectional and prospective studies on the prevalence of hypertension in IDDM show an association between microalbuminuria and elevated blood pressure levels. However, it is not clear whether hypertension is simply secondary to kidney damage or whether hypertension occurs with or even before the development of impaired kidney function. Patients with IDDM have a higher exchangeable body Na+ pool. Na+ retention in IDDM is accounted for by several metabolic and hormonal abnormalities such as hyperglycemia, hyperketonemia, hyperinsulinemia, altered secretion, and resistance to atrial natriuretic peptide. High blood pressure appears to be dependent, at least at some phase, on expansion of extracellular fluid volume as a consequence of defects in the renal secretion of Na+ and water. On the other hand, a tendency toward Na+ retention characterizes all patients with IDDM, whereas hypertension develops only in a subgroup of diabetic patients. One possible explanation for these findings is that a genetic predisposition plays a role in creating susceptibility to hypertension and perhaps to diabetic nephropathy independent of diabetes, even if Na+ retention can further deteriorate this susceptibility to hypertension. With regard to this issue, it has recently been suggested that the risk of kidney disease in patients with IDDM is associated with a genetic predisposition to hypertension. Furthermore, diabetic nephropathy occurs in familial clusters, because diabetic siblings of nephropathic diabetic patients show a higher frequency of diabetic nephropathy than the diabetic siblings of nonnephropathic diabetic patients. One of the possible genetic markers that could be useful to identify the diabetic patients with susceptibility to hypertension and diabetic nephropathy is the Na+(-)Li+ countertransport activity in erythrocytes.\r"

  ".W": "The common association between diabetes mellitus and hypertension may be promoted by several mechanisms. Patients with insulin-dependent (type I) diabetes and prone to develop nephropathy often have a familial predisposition for essential hypertension, whereas normotensive healthy offspring of nondiabetic essential hypertensive parents tend to have a reduced insulin sensitivity and increased plasma insulin levels. Na+ retention occurs as a characteristic alteration in type I or non-insulin-dependent (type II) diabetes; exchangeable body Na+ (Naex) is increased by 10% on average. This abnormality develops in the uncomplicated stage of diabetes and differentiates diabetic from nondiabetic essential hypertensive subjects. Possible Na(+)- retaining mechanisms include increased glomerular filtration of glucose leading to enhanced proximal tubular Na(+)-glucose cotransport, hyperinsulinemia (which activates several tubular Na+ transporters), an extravascular shift of fluid with Na+, and, once it occurs, renal failure. The pathogenetic role of Na+ retention in diabetes-associated hypertension is supported by positive correlations between systolic or mean blood pressure and Naex and by normalization of blood pressure after removal of excess Na+ by diuretic treatment in hypertensive diabetic subjects. The latter may also have an enhanced sensitivity of blood pressure to Na+. Plasma levels of active renin, angiotensin II, aldosterone, and catecholamines are usually normal or low in metabolically stable type I or type II diabetes. However, an exaggerated vascular reactivity to norepinephrine and angiotensin II commonly occurs already at uncomplicated stages of type I or type II diabetes. This may be a manifestation of functional (i.e., intracellular electrolytes) and/or morphological (proliferation, narrowing, and stiffening) vasculopathy. Diabetes-associated Na+ retention, vasculopathy, and a presumably inherited predisposition for both diabetes and essential hypertension may represent important complementary factors favoring the frequent occurrence of hypertension in the diabetic population.\r"

These include dietary and epidemiological studies, studies on the isolated cells and tissues of hypertensive subjects, and the association of the genetic predisposition to hypertension with abnormalities of cellular Na+ handling. In isolated cells, the most convincing abnormalities have been shown in the Na+ pump, where there is also evidence of a circulating inhibitor of the pump in essential hypertension, although the nature of the agent is still uncertain. The genetic association between essential hypertension and Na+ transport is best represented by alterations in Na(+)-Li+ countertransport in hypertensive subjects and their near relatives, although interpretation is rendered more complex by the influence of nongenetic factors on this system. The demonstrated differences between hypertensive and nonhypertensive subjects in the cellular handling of Na+ have not been integrated into a totally convincing explanation of the ultimate mechanism of the condition. Attention has focused on the possible mechanisms whereby an increase in intracellular Na+ may increase the concentration of cytosolic Ca2+ in the vascular smooth muscle, which is presumed to be a necessary precondition to a chronically elevated peripheral vascular resistance.\r"

Most patients with NIDDM are obese; the incidence of hypertension in obesity and NIDDM is substantial, approaching 50% in some studies. Furthermore, hypertension is known to contribute to the increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients with obesity and NIDDM. Despite the obvious clinical importance, the pathogenesis of hypertension in obesity and NIDDM remains poorly understood. Recent studies have identified hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance as important threads that tie hypertension, obesity, and NIDDM together. The hypothesis is developed that insulin-mediated sympathetic stimulation contributes to blood pressure elevation in both obesity and NIDDM. Recruited as a mechanism to limit weight gain and restore energy balance, insulin resistance and sympathetic stimulation increase blood pressure by enhancing renal Na+ reabsorption and stimulating the cardiovascular system. In this article, we review the evidence on which this hypothesis is based.\r"

  ".W": "Borderline hypertension, a condition in which the blood pressure oscillates between normal and high values, is a predictor of future more severe hypertension. Pathophysiologically, borderline hypertension is different from established hypertension. A large proportion of such patients have elevated cardiac output and a normal vascular resistance. In established hypertension, the output is normal and resistance is elevated. The elevation of cardiac output in borderline hypertension is neurogenic; it can be abolished by an autonomic blockade of the heart. In addition to an increased cardiac sympathetic drive, increased sympathetic tone to the kidney, arterioles, and veins has also been found. In parallel with the hypersympathetic state, patients with borderline hypertension also show decreased parasympathetic tone. The enhanced sympathetic tone leads to a decreased cardiac responsiveness, and eventually, the cardiac output returns to the normal range. High blood pressure causes vascular hypertrophy, and hypertrophic vessels are hyperresponsive to vasoconstriction. These secondary changes in the responsiveness of the heart and blood vessels are the basis of transition from a high cardiac output to high-resistance hypertension. These hemodynamic changes are associated with a downregulation of the sympathetic tone. A picture of an apparently nonneurogenic high-resistance hypertension emerges. Nevertheless, when assessed in regard to the enhanced pressor responsiveness, the sympathetic drive in such patients is still excessive. Despite the apparently normal tone, the sympathetic nervous system continues to play an important pathophysiological role in established hypertension. Borderline hypertension is associated with numerous metabolic abnormalities including obesity and insulin resistance. It is tempting to view all these abnormalities as a common expression of the increased sympathetic drive in hypertension. Explanation of the basis of the association of hypertension and metabolic abnormalities promises to bring new insights into the pathophysiology of two common diseases of civilization: hypertension and diabetes mellitus.\r"

Elevated blood pressure accelerates and effective blood pressure reduction with beta-blockers and/or angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors delays the progression of nephropathy and reduces albuminuria. All previous reports dealing with the natural history of diabetic nephropathy demonstrated a cumulative death rate between 50 and 77% 10 yr after onset of nephropathy. Effective antihypertensive treatment reduced the cumulative death rate to 15-20% 10 yr after onset of nephropathy. Recent randomized control studies indicate that ACE inhibition may delay and even prevent the development of diabetic nephropathy in normotensive IDDM patients with persistent microalbuminuria. Several cross-sectional and prospective studies suggest an association between elevated blood pressure and the development and progression of diabetic retinopathy. Furthermore, carotid insufficiency or other causes of unilaterally or bilaterally reduced retinal blood flow (pressure) diminish the development of diabetic retinopathy. Diabetic retinopathy is characterized by abnormal leakage of fluorescein through the blood-retinal barrier, an abnormality that can be reversed during antihypertensive treatment. It is well documented that elevated blood pressure, poor metabolic control, and diabetic microangiopathy independently enhance the endothelial leakage of plasma proteins in diabetes mellitus. A link between capillary hypertension, increased extravasation of plasma proteins, and the development and progression of diabetic microangiopathy has been suggested. Blood pressure reduction diminishes the extravasation of plasma proteins. The above results strongly support the case for early and effective treatment of arterial blood pressure elevation in diabetes.\r"

Without major difficulty, we classified 97% of patients in more or less clearly defined syndromes. Benign frontal and benign psychomotor epilepsies of childhood were represented in this sample of patients. In either partial or generalized idiopathic epilepsies, a diagnosis of epilepsy appears justified even after a single epileptic event when sufficient electroclinical characteristics are present. Patients with symptomatic generalized epilepsies often have to be classified under two or three headings. Many children with a symptomatic generalized epilepsy also experience partial seizures. Alcoholic epilepsy is described as a veritable epileptic syndrome. The distribution of epileptic syndromes was clearly different in the two samples, casting doubt on the value of some epidemiologic surveys based on selected groups of patients.\r"

Historical data, physical examinations, and neurodiagnostic evaluations (including previous EEGs, neuroradiologic evaluations, and neuropsychologic testing) were reviewed.

A history of status epilepticus was obtained in 64% (of 22 patients), including 11 of 14 patients with physiologic events plus seizures. Abnormal findings on neurologic examination were common, especially in children with nonepileptic physiologic events. All but two patients had a history of interictal epileptiform abnormalities on previous routine EEGs. Based on identification of nonepileptic events, antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) were discontinued completely in eight patients (30%) and the total number of AEDs was reduced in nine others (33%). A diagnosis of nonepileptic events should be considered in all children with refractory seizures or multiple seizure types. Abnormal findings on routine (interictal) EEG may actually confound the diagnosis. Intensive neurodiagnostic EEG-video recording is the preferred method for distinguishing nonepileptic from epileptic seizures.\r"

Comparison group parents (n = 180) and their children jointly attended three 2-h lecture sessions followed by question-and-answer periods. Although parents' overall knowledge of epilepsy was relatively high initially, it improved considerably in both comparison and experimental groups. With regard to anxiety, at the 5-month evaluation, experimental group parents and mothers in particular were more likely than control parents to state that they were less anxious (p less than 0.001), and their anxiety, as measured by the Taylor Manifest Anxiety scale, was significantly reduced (p less than 0.01).\r"

  ".W": "We conducted a retrospective parallel longitudinal cohort study comparing surgical and medical treatment for epilepsy. The surgical group contained 201 patients treated with resective surgery for epilepsy in Norway since the first operation in 1949 until January 1988. The 185 control group patients treated medically only were closely matched for year of treatment, age at treatment, sex, seizure type, and neurologic deficit before treatment. There was no significant difference in survival between the two groups. The total monthly seizure frequency in the first and second year after operation and last year of registration (median 9 years) was significantly lower in the surgical group than in the control group (Mann-Whitney U test, two-tailed p less than 0.0001). The patterns were similar, with significant differences for subgroups with similar pretreatment status, such as seizure frequency, age, etiology and EEG-focality. Twenty-three and four-tenths percent (n = 40) of the surgically treated, and 2.9% of the controls had contracted neurologic deficits within 2 years after treatment. The difference was significant (chi square = 32.89, p less than 0.0001). Psychosis or permanent psychotic symptoms were reported in 6.7% (n = 11) of the surgically treated patients, and we suspect a higher proportion of psychotic development in the surgical group than in the control group. We conclude that surgical treatment for partial epilepsy is more successful than medical treatment in producing seizure reduction, provided the indications for operation exist. Surgical treatment produces more neurologic deficits than medical treatment (and possibly more psychiatric morbidity), and this factor must be weighed against the reduction in seizure frequency. The two treatments are equal for longterm survival.\r"

The entry criteria required at least six seizures in a 3-week baseline period (and no more than 1 week with a single seizure) with CBZ alone. Thirty subjects were randomized. Two left the study after randomization, 1 owing to seizure exacerbation, and 1 owing to hyponatremia, which may have been related to CBZ therapy. The daily dosage of 50 mg/kg (maximum 3,000 mg) FBM per day was well tolerated by all 28 patients who completed the study. Only mild adverse experience were observed during the trial. FBM reduced CBZ level (p less than 0.0001; 95% confidence interval -28%, -20%). There was no significant difference in seizure frequency between placebo and FBM periods (one-sided p = 0.172), but when a correction was made for the lower CBZ level noted during FBM periods, the data suggested a strong antiseizure effect of FBM.\r"

Patients continued carbamazepine (CBZ) for both scans: serum concentrations were not significantly changed by VPA (CBZ range 5.4-12 mg/dl). Seven patients had the \"without-VPA\" scan first. Mean interval between PET scans was 75 days. Global CMRglc was decreased by 22% by addition of VPA (7.2 +/- 1.8 mg/100 g/min without VPA, 5.6 +/- 1.1 g/min with VPA, p less than 0.05, corrected). Thirteen regions of interest (ROIs) were analyzed in each hemisphere in each PET scan. Metabolic rates were significantly lower in 15 of 26 ROIs with VPA (p less than 0.05, corrected). VPA depresses cerebral metabolism to a greater degree than do CBZ and phenytoin (PHT) but less than does phenobarbital (PB). The metabolic effect may be related to the mechanism of action and have neuropsychological implications.\r"

Every interview had a very personal character and early life experiences seemed to have a determinative influence on the attitude to the test. Persons who were without symptoms of the disease and had passed the mean age of onset within the family (usually older individuals) were largely enthusiastic about a test, as were those with slight and undetermined symptoms. Younger persons, especially those with a qualitatively good contact with the affected parent, seemed to be less interested. Contradictions during the interview were more common among those positive to testing and an ambivalence among many was reflected in a tendency towards changing opinions over time.\r"

More respondents were afraid of viral infections (48%) than bacterial infections (9%), which may be due to the media focus upon the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Thirty-five per cent believed penicillin to be effective against virus infections. Educational programmes on fever should also include information about virus infections and their treatment.\r"

It shows that people are affected in many different ways: in employment, schooling, physical activities, social interaction, personal relationships and emotional well-being. All of the people interviewed had experienced some impact on their lives, albeit to varying degrees. The overall social impact was positively correlated with the severity of the asthma itself; this correlation was statistically significant in the case of adults and children under school age.\r"

  ".U": "91257467\r", 
  ".W": "Since patients with sexually transmitted disease (STD) form the most apparent risk group for HIV infection in general practice, differences in sexual behaviour in patients with and without STD were studied. Patients fulfilling at least one of four clinical criteria for suspicion of STD were offered four microbiological tests and a serological HIV test and were asked to complete a questionnaire concerning possible HIV exposure. Control patients were selected from a sample of ordinary consulting patients in general practice, without clinical suspicion of STD. The answers to the questionnaires given by six male and 52 female patients with a positive microbiological test for STD were compared with answers given by control patients matched for sex, age, education and geographical region. Females with STD had multiple male partners more often than controls. STD patients were more uncertain whether they had had sex with a HIV-positive person, and they reported more previous gonorrhea than the control patients. The proportion of patients who reported practicing oral sex was the same in both groups, while data for anal sex were insufficient. There were no significant differences in the use of condoms with a new partner, although there was a higher proportion of never-users of condoms among the STD patients. Identifying STD patients on clinical grounds is difficult in general practice. Clinical criteria have limited sensitivity because of asymptomatic infections, and the specificity is low. Patients with microbiologically confirmed STD should receive HIV-related attention, but attention to STD patients alone is not enough. Many people without STD have sexual behaviour which may exposure them to the HIV virus. The only means to a selective approach is increased attention to an appropriate sexual medical history.\r"

A sample of 59 Gujarati Asians of mean age 62.9 years and 59 indigenous subjects of mean age 63.9 years of whom 42% (25 in each group) were female drawn from a general practice was studied. Asian subjects had a higher prevalence of diagnosed diseases, with the exception of chronic obstructive airways disease, but lower risk of falls and urinary incontinence. Asian subjects had higher life satisfaction scores and lower prevalence of depressed mood. Asian women were more likely to have had contact with primary care services. Both Asian men and women had more frequent hospital admissions, but similar levels of out-patient attendance. Body mass index, blood pressure and shoulder joint range of movement were similar for both Asians and the indigenous population. Asian subjects had significantly lower peak expiratory flow rates and hand grip strength. Asian elders have a higher risk of chronic diseases, but the impact of disease (indicated by life satisfaction, mood, and common disabilities) is less than among the indigenous population. Lower peak expiratory flow rates and grip strength among Asian elders are of concern since they may lead to premature arrival at age-related thresholds of physical capacity essential for independence in activities of daily living.\r"

To demonstrate the progress made in the family medicine clinic at the Chung Shan Medical College Hospital and to evaluate the appropriateness of this kind of family practice setting, our patient population of 616 was investigated. There were 5177 patient encounters during the period from September 1987 to August 1989. Of 616 patients, 52.3% were male, the average age was 38.5 years, 85.1% lived in Taichung, where the hospital is located, and 60.1% were insured. A total of 117 families, containing 310 members, made up 50.3% of the patient population. Most patients (64.0%) visited us after introductions by their relatives or friends. There was an average of 4.2 visits per patient per year, and only 6.3% of patients were lost to follow-up after their first visits. The three leading causes for visits to the Family Medicine Clinic were general medical examination (14.5%), acute upper respiratory tract infection (13.6%), and peptic ulcer diseases (8.0%): these comprised 36.1% of all patients' problems. The average referral rate among the 5177 patient encounters was 2.9%. Patient education about treatment of disease, immunization against hepatitis B, and screening for liver cirrhosis/hepatoma in hepatitis B antigen carriers were the most common preventative encounters in our clinic. In conclusion, university/college hospitals are certainly not the best site for service and teaching of family practice, since they are not based on ambulatory care.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The lifetime prevalence of asthma in children varies from 5 to 31%, depending on the defining criteria, and even when recent prevalence (occurring in the past two years) is examined, rates from 5 to 18% have been found. There is growing evidence which shows that signs of reversible airways disease occur in the elderly with even greater frequency and it is likely that at least 10% of the population will need asthma treatment at some stage of their lives; this means that well over five million people in the UK or 250 patients in each 'average' general practice list of 2500 merit the diagnosis of asthma at some stage of their lives. The fact that an average practice is likely to have diagnosed less than half that number clearly implies that asthma is first and foremost an under-diagnosed disease.\r"

  ".W": "The present study was designed to examine the role of electrode position during retrograde pacing in dogs with short bowel syndrome and unsevered intact duodenum. In nine beagle dogs a subtotal resection of the small bowel and jejunoileostomy was performed. In five of these dogs, an isolated blind loop (jejunum) with preserved mesenteric connections was left in situ as an additional place for a stimulation electrode. Small intestinal motility and plasma levels of insulin, glucagon, gastrin, somatostatin, and glucose were examined during pacing of the residual jejunum or the isolated loop, respectively, compared with control experiments in the same dogs without pacing. During pacing of the loop a significant (P less than 0.05-0.01) decrease in the postprandial small intestinal motility index was observed combined with a significant (P less than 0.05) increase in plasma insulin levels, whereas the postprandial increase in glucagon, somatostatin, gastrin, and glucose levels was not different from that in controls. In contrast, pacing of the jejunum increased postprandial small intestinal motility index (less than or equal to 68%), whereas the levels of the four hormones and plasma glucose were not different from those in controls. The data suggest that in dogs with intact duodenum, pacing on an excluded loop is required to obtain the desired effect of reduced intestinal motility and improved anabolic pancreatic hormone secretion.\r"

Eight patients with severe constipation were studied, none of whom had evidence of abnormal function of the pelvic floor. 99mTc-radiolabeled Amberlite resin particles (average diameter, 1 mm; Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO) with a mixed meal were used to assess gastric emptying and small bowel transit; similar particles labeled with 111In were ingested in a coated capsule that dispersed in the ileocecal region. These were used to quantify colonic transit. Five healthy volunteers were also studied. Two patients showed delayed gastric emptying and two had slow small bowel transit. Seven of the eight patients had slow colonic transit. In five, delay affected the whole colon (\"pancolonic inertia\"); in two, transit in the ascending and transverse colon was normal, but solids moved through the left colon slowly. Mean colonic transit was also measured using radiopaque markers; this technique identified the patients with slow transit, as shown by measurements of overall colonic transit by simultaneous scintigraphy. However, estimated transit through the ascending and transverse colons was considerably shorter by the radiopaque marker technique. In conclusion, idiopathic constipation is characterized by either exaggerated reservoir functions of the ascending and transverse colons and/or impairment of propulsive function in the descending colon. Particle size may influence the result of regional colonic transit tests. Transit delays in other parts of the gut suggest that, in some patients, the condition may be a more generalized motor dysfunction.\r"

The range of lipase activity in biopsy specimens from the gastric body, in 29 subjects aged from 3 months to 26 years, was 1.8-5.3 U/mg protein (1 U is 1 mumol [3H]oleic acid released from tri-[3H]olein per minute). There were no significant differences among age groups (5-19 months, 2-4 years, 6-10 years, 11-13 years, and 15-26 years). Lipase activity was low or undetectable in the gastric antrum of all subjects. Pepsin activity in specimens from the gastric body ranged from 180 to 780 pepsin units/mg protein (using hemoglobin as substrate). The antrum had significantly lower pepsin activity (P less than 0.001) than the gastric body. As with lipase activity, there were no statistically significant differences in pepsin activity among age groups. Lipase and pepsin activity was also quantified in pinch biopsy specimens from the duodenum and duodenal bulb in 13 subjects. Contrary to lipase activity, which was almost completely absent from the duodenum or duodenal bulb, these sites contained low pepsin activity (9-78 pepsin units/mg protein). The data show that in infants and children, as previously reported in adults, gastric lipase is localized primarily in the gastric body. Tissue pepsin levels and localization, reported here for the first time, are similar to those of lipase, although, contrary to lipase, the gastric antrum has considerable pepsin activity. The identical levels of lipase and pepsin activities in infants, children, and adults indicate that the gastric phase of nutrient digestion is well developed at birth.\r"

Inflammatory bowel disease tended to affect predominantly female, white, and younger veterans, these trends being more marked in cases of Crohn's disease than ulcerative colitis. Hospital discharges secondary to both Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis appeared to be more frequent in veterans from northern than southern parts of the United States, but did not show a seasonal variation different from the general pattern of all other diagnoses. The results in veterans confirm observations made in other studies and suggest that inflammatory bowel disease among different populations is modulated by similar pathophysiologic mechanisms and environmental risk factors.\r"

Of 26 patients with H. pylori infection, 22 (84%) tested positive for basophil-bound specific IgE (determined by the histamine release test) and 18 (69%) for serum specific IgE (determined by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay). In contrast, only 1 of 17 persons in whom the bacterium was not detected presented cell-bound and serum specific IgE. In the 4 histamine release test--positive but enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay--negative patients, removal of antibody from the basophil surface by acid elution showed that histamine release occurred through an IgE-dependent mechanism. When normal basophils, passively sensitized with serum from IgE-positive patients, were exposed to the H. pylori antigen, a significant release was observed, confirming the class specificity of the response. Inhibition experiments with bacteria other than H. pylori showed that the IgE antibody was specifically directed against this organism. The percentage of antigen-induced histamine release did not correlate with serum specific IgE level. However, the response of basophils to antigenic challenge was proportional to IgE-dependent cellular releasability. This finding suggests that target cell sensitivity may be the most important factor in determining the entity of biological response to the antigenic challenge. The ability of H. pylori to induce a specific IgE immune response could answer key questions regarding the mechanisms inducing gastric inflammation.\r"

Each patient was studied both after receiving a single IV bolus of omeprazole (40 mg) and after receiving a single oral dose of omeprazole (80 mg). Intravenous and oral omeprazole doses were administered 1 week apart. Gastric acid secretion and plasma concentrations of omeprazole after drug administration were determined in each patient. The area under the plasma concentration curve, clearance, and volume of distribution after IV omeprazole administration and the area under the plasma concentration curve, peak plasma concentration, and time required to reach the peak after oral omeprazole administration were not different from those reported previously for normal subjects and patients with peptic ulcer disease. Mean (+/- SEM) bioavailability of oral omeprazole for all patients was 68% +/- 16%, which was similar to the bioavailability reported previously for normal subjects. Three patients had a significantly lower bioavailability reported previously for normal subjects. Three patients had a significantly lower bioavailability (20% +/- 8%) than the others, and their basal acid outputs were significantly higher than those of the other 7 patients. For all patients there was an inverse correlation between bioavailability and basal acid output (r = 0.76; P less than 0.02). The mean (+/- SEM) elimination half-lives of IV and oral omeprazole were not different (2.3 +/- 0.4 vs. 2.4 +/- 0.5 hours) but were significantly longer than those reported previously for normal subjects (P less than 0.02). The duration of action correlated with the elimination half-life of the drug (r = 0.87; P less than 0.003) and area under the plasma concentration curve (r = 0.72; P less than 0.03). The mean durations of action of IV and oral omeprazole were not significantly different (34 +/- 7.2 vs. 35 +/- 6.2 hours). It was concluded that altered pharmacokinetics do not account for the increased drug requirement of omeprazole in patients with the Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. In contrast to a previous study, the oral and IV omeprazole had the same duration of action, suggesting that intermittent bolus administration of parenteral omeprazole will obviate the need for continuous infusion of histamine H2-receptor antagonists in patients requiring parenteral antisecretory drugs. Furthermore, an IV dose every 12 hours controlled acid secretion in all patients, suggesting this as the recommended dose interval in patients requiring parenteral drug therapy.\r"

  ".W": "Decreased life expectancy may occur after remote peptic ulcer surgery, but the cause of shortened survival is unclear. A 50-year follow-up study of an Amsterdam cohort of postgastrectomy patients who underwent ulcer surgery between 1931 and 1960 showed a statistically significant decrease in survival after a postoperative interval of 12 years or more compared with the general population. The shortened life expectancy mainly reflected decreased survival in men. In women, no significant difference in survival compared with the general population was observed. The excess mortality in men was predominantly due to a statistically significant increase in cancer-related deaths. Carcinoma of the lung accounted for the majority of excess mortality. No time relationship between lung cancer death and interval since surgery was observed. Thus, smoking, primarily in men who had undergone surgery for gastric ulcers, seems an important factor contributing to excess mortality and shortened life expectancy. Excess mortality due to tobacco use has also been observed in postmarketing surveillance of H2-receptor antagonists. Therefore, smoking cessation may provide the greatest improvement in the long-term prognosis of peptic ulcer patients, regardless of the treatment.\r"

The genetic defect responsible for adenomatous polyposis resides at a locus called APC which has been localized to the long arm of human chromosome 5. In this study, the APC locus was mapped with respect to 11 markers known to map to this chromosomal segment. Linkage of APC to four of these markers had been previously reported. Three additional markers are shown here to be linked to APC. By multipoint analysis, the APC locus maps to an interval bounded by D5S49 and D5S58. The refined map of the APC locus and the new markers described here improve the informativeness and accuracy of the presymptomatic diagnosis of familial adenomatous polyposis.\r"

In response to sublethal heat stress at 43 degrees C for 1 hour, the cells synthesized a 72-kilodalton protein and increased the synthesis of 74- and 90-kilodalton proteins, which were detected using gel electrophoresis after [35S]methionine labeling of the cells. Immunoblot analysis indicated that the 72- and 74-kilodalton proteins were members of the heat shock protein 70 family. Northern blot analysis showed the induction of a 2.6-kilobase messenger RNA of heat shock protein 70 gene only with heat treatment. Furthermore, with heat treatment, there was significant reduction of damage after ethanol treatment. This reduction was blocked with a protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide, and was associated with inhibition of synthesis of heat shock proteins. These results strongly suggest that synthesis of heat shock proteins plays an important role in the intracellular mechanism of gastric protection against ethanol.\r"

To determine if subjects with atrophic body gastritis have evidence of previous infection with H. pylori, immunoglobulin G antibody to H. pylori was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in sera of 399 Finnish subjects. In 124 subjects, multiple biopsy specimens from body and antrum had been evaluated for the presence of H. pylori by Giemsa staining. Antibody correlated well with H. pylori staining except in the subgroup with atrophic body gastritis, in whom the prevalence of seropositivity (86%) was significantly greater than the prevalence of positive staining (33%) (P less than 0.001). Twenty-five subjects had positive antibody and negative staining. This group had a significantly higher prevalence of atrophic body gastritis (80%), lower maximal acid output, lower serum pepsinogen I levels, and higher serum gastrin concentrations than did seropositive subjects with H. pylori. These data suggest that most patients with atrophic body gastritis, despite having a low incidence of current overt infection, have been infected with H. pylori at some point in their lives.\r"

To study the mechanisms involved in the development of the hepatic lesions, early changes in liver function in rats pretreated with the drug were investigated. Dosages and sampling times that did not result in hepatocellular injury, as indicated by release of marker enzymes, were applied. In isolated perfused livers from pretreated rats, bile flow and maximal secretion rate of taurocholate were decreased. An increase in biliary [14C]sucrose clearance suggested enhanced permeability of the bile tract and was correlated with increased inorganic phosphate concentration in bile. To assess the contribution of paracellular and transcellular pathways of sucrose, [14C]sucrose access into bile was analyzed by biliary off-kinetics after omission of the radioactive marker from the perfusion medium. An improved method was developed to quantitate the permeability of the bile tract by applying the classical flow equation to the paracellular portion of biliary sucrose clearance. With this method it was shown that pretreatment of rats with BCNU resulted in an increase in both diffusion and convection of paracellular sucrose from perfusate into bile. Accordingly, the fast access of horseradish peroxidase from perfusate into bile was facilitated in isolated perfused livers of BCNU-treated rats. The results indicate that an increase in paracellular permeability is an early alteration that may contribute to the development of hepatotoxic lesions caused by BCNU. It is shown that inert solute clearance can be used to assess paracellular permeability if the paracellular fraction is determined.\r"

The six different VLA dimers known so far consist of a common beta subunit and a variable alpha (1 to 6) subunit. They serve as receptors for laminin, collagen, and fibronectin or function as adhesion molecules for leukocytes and are therefore of great significance in embryogenesis, growth and repair, and in leukocyte recirculation. The distribution of the common beta and the variable alpha chains of the VLA were studied in normal, inflammatory, and cholestatic liver biopsy samples. In normal liver tissue, vascular endothelia express alpha 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6; bile duct epithelium alpha 2, 3, 5, and 6; connective tissue stroma alpha 1 and 2; hepatocytes alpha 1 and 5; sinusoidal lining cells alpha 1, 2, and 5; and mononuclear cells alpha 4. Whereas bile ducts and vascular endothelia do not show relevant changes in alpha chain expression in liver diseases, hepatocytes de novo express membranous alpha 3 and 6 in inflammatory liver diseases. In view of the role of the VLA-3 and VLA-6 as laminin receptors, this finding is in line with the production of laminin in active liver disease. Moreover, de novo expression of \"bile duct type\" alpha 2, 3, and 6 on periportal hepatocytes in cholestatic liver disease likely illustrates a phenotypic switch of hepatocytes towards bile duct epithelium during cholestasis.\r"

To determine the optimal test method, the following were examined: (a) the best dose of bentiromide (15 mg/kg or 30 mg/kg); (b) the optimal sampling time for plasma p-aminobenzoic acid; and (c) the effect of coadministration of a liquid meal. Sixty-nine children 91.6 +/- 1.0 years) were studied, including 34 controls with normal fat absorption and 35 patients (34 with cystic fibrosis) with fat maldigestion due to pancreatic insufficiency. Control and pancreatic insufficient subjects were studied in three age-matched groups: (a) low-dose bentiromide (15 mg/kg) with clear fluids; (b) high-dose bentiromide (30 mg/kg) with clear fluids; and (c) high-dose bentiromide with a liquid meal. Plasma p-aminobenzoic acid was determined at 0, 30, 60, and 90 minutes then hourly for 6 hours. The dose effect of bentiromide with clear liquids was evaluated. High-dose bentiromide best discriminated control and pancreatic insufficient subjects, due to a higher peak plasma p-aminobenzoic acid level in controls, but poor sensitivity and specificity remained. High-dose bentiromide with a liquid meal produced a delayed increase in plasma p-aminobenzoic acid in the control subjects probably caused by retarded gastric emptying. However, in the pancreatic insufficient subjects, use of a liquid meal resulted in significantly lower plasma p-aminobenzoic acid levels at all time points; plasma p-aminobenzoic acid at 2 and 3 hours completely discriminated between control and pancreatic insufficient patients. Evaluation of the data by area under the time-concentration curve failed to improve test results. In conclusion, the bentiromide test is a simple, clinically useful means of detecting pancreatic insufficiency in young children, but a higher dose administered with a liquid meal is recommended.\r"

  ".W": "The study of cholesterol gallstone disease would be facilitated if the nucleation time of cholesterol crystals could be measured in duodenal bile and was correlated with nucleation occurring in vivo. Therefore, our aims were to determine (a) if nucleation time could be measured in duodenal bile, (b) the effect of bacteria, phospholipase, protease, and dilution on the measurement of nucleation time, and (c) the ability of nucleation time of duodenal bile to reflect changes occurring in vivo that promote the formation of gallstones and, therefore, the potential usefulness of nucleation time in predicting and studying the formation of gallstones. Gallbladder bile was obtained from 27 patients undergoing elective cholecystectomy and 19 patients undergoing diagnostic duodenal biliary drainage. Among the 14 bile samples collected by drainage that nucleated within 21 days, mean nucleation time was 6.3 +/- 2.8 days. The addition of inhibitors of phospholipase or protease prolonged nucleation time slightly. Bacteria were cultured from one bile sample at the time of collection and five samples at the time of nucleation. The addition of antibiotics had no effect on nucleation time. Dilution of bile collected at cholecystectomy to the concentration of duodenal bile prolonged nucleation time. In 4 of 5 obese patients receiving a very low calorie diet and predisposed to gallstones, the nucleation time in duodenal bile shortened, and the shortest nucleation times were associated with the formation of cholesterol crystals in vivo. Thus, measurement of nucleation time in duodenal bile may be useful in predicting and studying the formation of cholesterol gallstones.\r"

After 15-20 months of treatment, 95% of the animals developed pancreatic acinar carcinomas encompassing more than 90% of the tissue. In anesthetized rats basal trypsin output was significantly elevated in the tumor group despite diminished fluid secretion. There was a linear correlation between tumor size and basal amylase and trypsin secretion. Intravenous infusion of cholecystokinin (25 IDU.kg-1.h-1) induced a significantly lower secretion of fluid per gram pancreas, as well as decreased amylase and trypsin output, in the tumor group compared with the control group. Plasma amylase and lipase levels were significantly elevated in the tumor group under both basal and stimulated conditions. The output of the lysosomal enzymes beta-D-glucuronidase and alpha-D-glucosidase was significantly increased in the tumor group under background secretin infusion. Additional cholecystokinin infusion caused a sharp increase in glucuronidase output in this group with only minimal increase in controls. Glucosidase output increased similarly in both groups. Amylase, lipase, and trypsin tumor tissue concentrations were markedly reduced by 85%, 90%, and 87%, respectively. It was concluded that the decreased secretory response of digestive enzymes may result from decreased synthesis, lowered storage capabilities, and/or a decreased/increased responsiveness to cholecystokinin. Increased glucuronidase secretion may reflect an augmented cell turnover of malignant tissue.\r"

  ".W": "Lysophosphatidylcholine is a major metabolic product in the plasma and cellular turnover of phospholipids, with well-known membrane-toxic and proinflammatory properties. Because the liver plays a key role in plasma lysophosphatidylcholine removal and biotransformation and because virtually nothing is known of these processes in a diseased organ, the hepatobiliary metabolism of lysophosphatidylcholine was investigated in rats with carbon tetrachloride-induced liver cirrhosis. Twelve adult male Wistar rats with histologically confirmed cirrhosis and 8 control animals were fitted with jugular and biliary catheters and allowed to recover. The animals were kept under constant IV infusion of taurocholate (1 mumol/min). Two microcuries of sn-1[14C]palmitoyl-lysophosphatidylcholine was administered as a single bolus. The fate of the injected radioactivity, including removal from plasma, uptake, and subcellular location in the liver and molecular and aggregative forms, was studied by combined chromatographic and radiochemical methods. Major findings were (a) that lysophosphatidylcholine has a prolonged permanence in plasma of cirrhotic rats, due both to decreased hepatic clearance and to depressed conversion into phosphatidylcholine; (b) that the rate of lysophosphatidylcholine acylation is much slower in the cirrhotic than in the normal liver, both at the microsomal and at the cytosolic level; (c) that cytosolic lysophosphatidylcholine in the cirrhotic liver, but not in the normal liver, is predominantly non-protein bound; (d) that the strict molecular selectivity of lysophosphatidylcholine acylation observed in controls is partially lost in cirrhosis; and (e) that a consistent fraction of lysophosphatidylcholine is converted into triacylglycerols in cirrhotics but not in controls. These findings show a profound derangment of lysophosphatidylcholine handling and processing in the cirrhotic liver, which is of potential pathogenetic significance.\r"

The patients had a normal upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and biopsy specimens were obtained for determination of Helicobacter pylori status. Fifteen of the 18 patients were infected with H. pylori. All patients underwent intubation with double-lumen tube and collection of cholecystokinin-stimulated pancretico-biliary secretions. Subsequently, normal saline, 0.1N hydrochloric acid, and autologous duodenal secretions were infused into the stomach in a randomized blinded fashion. A positive response was defined as the production of epigastric pain by acid and/or bile but not by saline. By this definition, only 6 patients (33%) had a positive response and none had reproduction of their usual symptoms. In patients with a negative response, only 4 remained asymptomatic during all infusions. The remaining 8 had symptoms during infusion of saline, 7 of whom also had symptoms during infusion of acid and/or duodenal secretions. Two of these patients had reproduction of their usual symptoms. In conclusion, the gastric mucosa in patients with nonulcer dyspepsia is not abnormally sensitive to acid or duodenal contents.\r"

To investigate the extent to which this increase is dependent on T lymphocytes, smooth muscle contraction was examined in athymic rats (rnu/rnu) and in their euthymic (rnu/+) littermates 6 days after infection. In both thymus-bearing and athymic rats, the highest concentrations of Trichinella were found in the jejunum where mucosal myeloperoxidase activity was increased. Muscle from infected euthymic rats generated more tension to carbachol or 5-hydroxytryptamine than that of noninfected controls. In contrast, there was no difference between the responses of muscle from infected and control athymic animals. However, when athymic rats were reconstituted with splenic mononuclear cells, increased tension to carbachol or 5-hydroxytryptamine was observed after infection. T-lymphocyte activity was demonstrated by in vitro assays in euthymic or reconstituted rats but not in athymic rats. It is concluded that some changes in intestinal smooth muscle function following Trichinella spiralis infection in the rat are T lymphocyte dependent. These results support the concept of immunomodulation of intestinal smooth muscle function.\r"

Evaluations included self-assessment and physician's assessment of well-being, functional capacity, general clinical response, clinical activities indices (National Foundation for Ileitis and Colitis/International Organization for the Study of Inflammatory Bowel Disease and Harvey-Bradshaw), and achievement of specific therapeutic goals. General clinical condition improved in 70% of the patients. Median response time was 3 months. The average Harvey-Bradshaw score decreased 37% with therapy, and a decrease of greater than or equal to 30% occurred in 66% of the subjects. An overall 72% achievement rate for specified therapeutic goals included controlling refractory disease, 73%; corticosteroid \"sparing,\" 76%; and lessening fistulization, 63%. Nine patients got worse despite therapy. Adverse effects requiring discontinuation of therapy occurred in 10%, whereas dosages were briefly lowered for mild side effects in another 10%.

The aim of this study was to establish whether endothelinlike immunoreactivity occurs in human enteric nerves and to identify endothelin binding sites using immunocytochemical and in vitro autoradiographic techniques. Endothelinlike immunoreactivity was localized to nerve bundles throughout the colon and to most of the ganglion cells of the two major plexuses, many of which costored vasoactive intestinal polypeptide. High-affinity (dissociation constant = 0.35 +/- 0.014 nmol/L; mean +/- SEM) binding sites for endothelin 1, with an apparent binding capacity of 92 +/- 6.3 amol/mm2 (mean +/- SEM), were demonstrated in the myenteric plexus, with less dense binding being found in the submucous plexus, mucosa, muscle layers, and blood vessel walls. Competition data suggested two populations of binding sites, both showing high affinities for endothelins 1 and 2, vasoactive intestinal constrictor, and sarafatoxin b but differentiated by their affinity for endothelin 3 and sarafatoxin c. This study provides evidence that endothelin is a neuropeptide in the human intestine with binding sites on neural plexuses and mucosa, suggesting a role in the modulation of intestinal motility and secretion.\r"

Peppermint oil relaxed carbachol-contracted guinea pig taenia coli (IC50, 22.1 micrograms/mL) and inhibited spontaneous activity in the guinea pig colon (IC50, 25.9 micrograms/mL) and rabbit jejunum (IC50, 15.2 micrograms/mL). Peppermint oil markedly attenuated contractile responses in the guinea pig taenia coli to acetylcholine, histamine, 5-hydroxytryptamine, and substance P. Peppermint oil reduced contractions evoked by potassium depolarization and calcium contractions evoked in depolarizing Krebs solutions in taenia coli. Potential-dependent calcium currents recorded using the whole cell clamp configuration in rabbit jejunum smooth muscle cells were inhibited by peppermint oil in a concentration-dependent manner. Peppermint oil both reduced peak current amplitude and increased the rate of current decay. The effect of peppermint oil resembled that of the dihydropyridine calcium antagonists. It is concluded that peppermint oil relaxes gastrointestinal smooth muscle by reducing calcium influx.\r"

Two fluorescent hydrophobic probes--Nile Red and 1-anilinonaphthalene-8-sulfonic acid--and a phospholipid-selective cytochemical stain--iodoplatinate--were used for fluorescence and electron microscopic studies, respectively. The results showed the presence of phospholipid and neutral lipid fluorescent hot spots in the mucous cells of both the gastric mucosa and the submucosal Brunner's glands of the duodenum. In contrast, other cell types of the stomach (parietal, chief, and endocrine cells) or the duodenum (goblet cells and villous and crypt enterocytes) were either unreactive or weakly stained with the dyes. Ultrastructurally, two classes of large infranuclear inclusion bodies were observed in these two types of mucous cells. The location and size of these inclusion bodies appeared to be in agreement with the position and size of the large hydrophobic fluorescent hot spots detected at the light microscopic level. The ultrastructural appearance, localization, and histochemical staining pattern of these lipid-containing organelles suggest that they are specific for these cell types and not a general feature of degenerative epithelium undergoing lysosome-induced autolysis. It was concluded that the mucous cells of both the stomach and the Brunner's glands contain a subcellular organelle that stores hydrophobic material constituting both neutral lipids and phospholipids. These lipidic substances may be secreted into the gastroduodenal mucous gel and provide its surface with a nonwettable lining to repel luminal acid.\r"

Serum gastrin levels increased very rapidly from 74 +/- 6 pg/mL (controls) to 438 +/- 31 pg/mL (day 1) and 727 +/- 68 pg/mL (day 4). Thereafter, a steady increase was observed until day 70 (2097 +/- 208 pg/mL). Enterochromaffinlike cell density was unchanged until day 10, but then increased progressively without reaching a plateau (144% above control on day 73). The labeling index of these cells was enhanced shortly after drug application and remained on a constant elevated level from day 14 to day 73 (about 10-fold to 12-fold above controls from day 14 to day 70). The number of gastrin cells increased rapidly within the first week and reached a plateau after 17 days (96% increase above controls). In contrast to enterochromaffinlike cells, the labeling index did not change immediately but increased on day 7 by 37% and returned beneath control values after day 28. The results suggest that in drug-induced achlorhydria, the progressive increase of enterochromaffinlike cells is explained by an enhanced mitosis, whereas other factors in addition to proliferation are responsible for the augmentation of gastrin cells.\r"

Comparing the antibody to H. pylori in the sera of patients with that of normal controls by Western blot analysis, a unique antibody was detected in the sera of patients, which reacted with the 25-kilodalton antigen of H. pylori. On the other hand, monoclonal antibody CP3 prepared in the authors' laboratory also recognized the 25-kilodalton antigen of H. pylori. Whether the serum antibody of the patient recognized the CP3 antigen purified by monoclonal antibody CP3 was then examined. Western blot analysis showed that the patient's serum reacted strongly with the affinity-purified CP3 antigen. Using monoclonal antibody CP3, an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to detect CP3 antibody in sera was established. In patients with chronic gastritis and gastric ulcers, the titer of CP3 antibody was significantly higher than in normal controls and correlated with the histological grade of antral gastritis. The detection of CP3 antibody in sera is useful in the diagnosis of chronic gastritis and gastric ulcer associated with H. pylori infection and also in evaluation of the grade of gastritis.\r"

  ".W": "The Leu-8 membrane glycoprotein is the primate homologue of the murine MEL-14 peripheral lymph node homing receptor and is expressed on a majority of circulating lymphocytes but on few lymphocytes in the intestinal lamina propria. To examine the mechanisms regulating expression of the Leu-8-molecule on lymphocytes in different tissue sites, studies of Leu-8 membrane antigen expression, Leu-8 messenger RNA, and the Leu-8 gene were performed using normal human and nonhuman primate lymphocytes. Activation of resting peripheral blood lymphocytes caused a rapid decrease in membrane Leu-8 expression, a more gradual decrease in Leu-8 messenger RNA, and an increase in expression of interleukin 2 and interleukin 2 receptor messenger RNA. However, the down regulation of Leu-8 expression during activation was reversible because both membrane Leu-8 antigen and Leu-8 messenger RNA were reexpressed after 5 days of culture. Leu-8 messenger RNA was present in lymphocytes isolated from peripheral blood, spleen, and, particularly, mesenteric lymph node, but intestinal lamina propria lymphocytes contained very low levels of Leu-8 messenger RNA. The absence of Leu-8 messenger RNA in intestinal lymphocytes and circulating Leu-8 negative lymphocytes was not caused by recent activation in vivo because these cells did not have detectable interleukin 2 messenger RNA, and intestinal lymphocytes did not express Leu-8 after culture in vitro. Phorbol myristate acetate was found to be a strong inducer of Leu-8 messenger RNA in Leu-8-positive lymphocytes; however, phorbol myristate acetate did not induce membrane Leu-8 expression or Leu-8 messenger RNA in lamina propria lymphocytes. Leu-8-negative lymphocytes in peripheral blood or lamina propria did not have evidence of deletion or rearrangement of the Leu-8 gene. Leu-8-positive Jurkat cells and peripheral blood lymphocytes and Leu-8-negative peripheral blood and intestinal lymphocytes had partial methylation of an Msp I site in proximity to the Leu-8 gene, suggesting that in Leu-8-negative lymphocytes, the Leu-8 gene previously was transcriptionally active. In summary, these studies demonstrate that intestinal lamina propria lymphocytes have the same characteristics as circulating Leu-8-negative lymphocytes with respect to their state of activation and inability to express the Leu-8 antigen. The results suggest that the majority of lymphocytes that migrate to the intestinal lamina propria are derived from the subpopulation of circulating Leu-8-negative lymphocytes.\r"

Results indicated no significant difference in rates of conservatorship between those who were offered the money management service and those who were not.

Because these data were linked to Medicaid eligibility records, it was possible to determine the total amount of nursing home use that is paid for by Medicaid and to produce estimates of the risk of Medicaid spenddown. The lifetime risk of spenddown in nursing homes was estimated to be 21.5%, with a 14.4% incidence of spenddown in any given episode. The amount of time it took to spend down was longer than reported in several other studies.\r"

Moreover, we estimated that over 40% of those who spent down to Medicaid did so within 6 months, 58% spent down within a year, and 76% spent down within 2 years. Even though a relatively small percentage of residents spent down, this group had very long stays (median stay greater than 3 years) and thus contributed quite heavily to nursing home days.\r"

  ".W": "For many years the simple view was held that contractile force in smooth muscle was proportional to cytosolic Ca2+ concentrations ([Ca2+]i). With the discovery that phosphorylation of myosin light chain by Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent myosin light chain kinase initiated contraction, regulation of the contractile elements developed more complex properties. Molecular and biochemical investigations have identified important domains of myosin light chain kinase: light chain binding sites, catalytic core, pseudosubstrate prototope, and calmodulin-binding domain. New protein phosphatase inhibitors such as okadaic acid and calyculin A should help in the identification of the physiologically important phosphatase and potential modes of regulation. The proposal of an attached, dephosphorylated myosin cross bridge (latch bridge) that can maintain force has evoked considerable controversy about the detailed functions of the myosin phosphorylation system. The latch bridge has been defined by a model based on physiological properties but has not been identified biochemically. Thin-filament proteins have been proposed as secondary sites of regulation of contractile elements, but additional studies are needed to establish physiological roles. Changes in the Ca2+ sensitivity of smooth muscle contractile elements with different modes of cellular stimulation may be related to inactivation of myosin light chain kinase or activation of protein phosphatase activities. Thus, contractile elements in smooth muscle cells are not dependent solely on [Ca2+]i but use additional regulatory mechanisms. The immediate challenge is to define their relative importance and to describe molecular-biochemical properties that provide insights into proposed physiological functions.\r"

In the glucagon stimulation test, blood was sampled 2 minutes after intravenous injection of 0.28 mumol (1 mg) glucagon, and in the clonidine suppression test, blood was sampled 3 hours after administration of oral clonidine, 1.30 mumol (0.3 mg)/70 kg body wt. Baseline levels of catechols in antecubital venous blood were abnormal, with norepinephrine greater than 7.10 nmol/l (1,200 pg/m), epinephrine greater than 1.51 nmol/l (276 pg/ml), norepinephrine/dihydroxyphenylglycol (DHPG) ratio greater than 1.09, or dopa greater than 35.53 nmol/l (7,000 pg/ml), in 30 of 39 patients with pheochromocytoma (sensitivity 77%) and 1 of 74 patients without pheochromocytoma (specificity 99%).

Results of the clonidine test were abnormal (after clonidine norepinephrine greater than 2.96 nmol/l [500 pg/ml] or less than 50% decrease from baseline) in 29 of 30 patients with pheochromocytoma (sensitivity 97%) and in 7 of 30 patients without pheochromocytoma (specificity 67%). Very high baseline levels of catechols therefore indicated the presence of pheochromocytoma, but there were several false-negative results when normal levels were obtained. The glucagon test alone was highly specific but not sensitive, and the clonidine test was highly sensitive but less specific.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Carotid baroreceptor function, the compliance of the carotid sinus wall, and the structure of the carotid artery were examined in dogs with elevated plasma norepinephrine (2,000-4,000 pg/ml) for 28 days. The dogs with high norepinephrine were normotensive (100 +/- 4.0 versus 98 +/- 4.0 mm Hg; p greater than 0.05) with bradycardia (65 +/- 4.0 versus 87 +/- 16 beats/min; p less than 0.05) compared with normal dogs in the conscious state. However, after pentobarbital anesthesia blood pressure was significantly higher in dogs with chronic norepinephrine infusion (165 +/- 6 mm Hg) compared with normal dogs (132 +/- 6 mm Hg). To assess baroreceptor sensitivity, multiunit carotid baroreceptor activity was recorded from the right carotid sinus nerve, and the carotid sinus wall compliance (sonomicrometers) was measured during nitroglycerin and phenylephrine injections. The threshold and saturation pressures increased from 96 +/- 3.9 to 117 +/- 4.2 mm Hg and from 145 +/- 4.3 to 171 +/- 5.7 mm Hg, respectively, in the normal dogs compared with the high norepinephrine dogs. The most striking differences were the marked increases in sensitivity of carotid baroreceptors (0.47 +/- 0.05 versus 1.99 +/- 0.45 spikes.sec-1.mm Hg-1; p less than 0.01) and maximum firing frequency of the baroreceptors (24 +/- 3.1 versus 48 +/- 4.4 spikes/sec; p less than 0.01), whereas the carotid sinus wall compliance was unchanged (0.014 +/- 0.003 versus 0.012 +/- 0.002 mm/mm Hg; p greater than 0.05). Similar alterations were observed using single fiber recordings, that is, an increase in threshold and saturation pressures and slope of baroreceptor units in dogs with elevated norepinephrine. The wall thickness and area of the carotid artery were determined. Both increased significantly (0.77 +/- 0.06 versus 1.30 +/- 0.12 mm and 9.0 +/- 0.8 versus 11.9 +/- 0.9 mm2; p less than 0.05) in dogs chronically infused with norepinephrine while the dry weight-to-wet weight ratio of left carotid artery tissue also increased from 26.0 +/- 0.73% to 29.0 +/- 0.57%. These studies indicate that 1) one of the possible mechanisms responsible for bradycardia in the conscious dogs with high norepinephrine is enhanced sensitivity of carotid baroreceptors; 2) the enhanced sensitivity of carotid baroreceptors is not due to a change in compliance of the carotid sinus wall; and 3) chronic elevation of norepinephrine causes hypertrophy or hyperplasia of the wall of the common carotid artery.\r"

  ".W": "The borderline hypertensive rat is the first filial offspring of the spontaneously hypertensive rat and the Wistar-Kyoto rat. In response to acute environmental stress (air jet), the borderline hypertensive rat exhibits a diuretic response, whereas the parental strains exhibit an antidiuretic response (spontaneously hypertensive rat) or no change in urine flow rate (Wistar-Kyoto rat). This study sought to investigate the role of the periventricular tissue surrounding the anteroventral third ventricle and vasopressin release in the diuretic response of the borderline hypertensive rat to acute environmental stress. Sixteen-week-old borderline hypertensive rats who had consumed a 1% NaCl diet for 10-12 weeks were given either electrolytic lesions of the anteroventral portion of the third ventricle or sham lesions. When exposed to acute environmental stress 4 weeks later, the increase in volume of dilute urine seen in the sham-lesion rats was not observed in the lesion rats. Plasma vasopressin concentration was decreased by acute environmental stress in the sham-lesion rats (15.2 +/- 4.0 to 10.9 +/- 1.7 pg/ml, p less than 0.05) but was unchanged in the lesion rats (12.3 +/- 2.0 to 13.4 +/- 4.0 pg/ml). In a separate group of intact borderline hypertensive rats, a constant intravenous infusion of vasopressin prevented the diuretic response to acute environmental stress. The results suggest that acute environmental stress produces a diuresis in the borderline hypertensive rats via a decrease in plasma vasopressin concentration that is dependent on the integrity of the periventricular tissue of the anteroventral portion of the third ventricle.\r"

Two groups were exposed to cold (5 +/- 2 degrees C) while the remaining group was kept at 26 +/- 2 degrees C. One group of cold-treated rats received food into which captopril (0.06% by weight) had been thoroughly mixed. The remaining two groups received the same food but without captopril. Systolic blood pressure of the untreated, cold-exposed group increased significantly above that of the warm-adapted, control group within 4 weeks of exposure to cold. In contrast, chronic treatment with captopril prevented the elevation of blood pressure. Rats were killed after 4 months of exposure to cold. At death, the heart, kidneys, adrenal glands, and interscapular brown fat pad were removed and weighed. Although captopril prevented the elevation of blood pressure in cold-treated rats, it did not prevent hypertrophy of the kidneys, heart, and interstitial brown adipose tissue that characteristically accompanies exposure to cold. Thus, chronic treatment with captopril prevented the elevation of blood pressure when administered at the time exposure to cold was initiated. It also reduced the elevated blood pressure of cold-treated rats when administered after blood pressure became elevated. This suggests that the renin-angiotensin system may play a role in the elevation of blood pressure during exposure to cold.\r"

  ".W": "Rats susceptible to the hypertensive effect of dietary salt (SS/Jr) have excess urinary 19-nordeoxycorticosterone compared with salt-resistant control rats (SR/Jr). 19-Nordeoxycorticosterone is a hypertensinogenic mineralocorticoid, but whether it contributes to the salt sensitivity of SS/Jr is unknown. This study sought to evaluate the contribution of 19-nordeoxycorticosterone to the salt sensitivity of SS/Jr by lowering its production with an aromatase inhibitor, 10-propargyl-androst-4-ene,3,17-dione (19-acetylenic-androstenedione, 19-AA). This aromatase inhibitor also preferentially inhibits nonaromatizing adrenal 19-hydroxylation, an essential step in the formation of 19-nordeoxycorticosterone. To test this hypothesis, inhibitor (120 mg) or vehicle pellets were implanted into male and female weanling SS/Jr at 42 days of age. A high salt diet (8% NaCl) was started and two additional pellets were implanted at 52 and 62 days of age. Systolic blood pressure was measured in all animals and urinary corticosteroids in males. Compared with vehicle, the inhibitor lowered blood pressure at 50 days of age (when it could first be measured) until 64 days of age in females and 71 days of age in males. Corticosterone and aldosterone levels were not different between 19-AA- and vehicle-treated SS/Jr. 19-Nordeoxycorticosterone levels, however, were mildly reduced with the inhibitor (0.05 less than p less than 0.10). After 28 days of high salt diet all 23 of the 19-AA-treated SS/Jr were alive, whereas almost one half of the control animals had died. These data demonstrate that 19-AA attenuates the hypertension in SS/Jr; this effect may be through reduction in 19-nordeoxycorticosterone production.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We report in the present study that chronic treatment with SnCl2, begun at age 5 weeks, prevented the development of hypertension in SHR over a period of 15 weeks at which time they were killed. Suspension of SnCl2 treatment after 8 weeks (i.e., at age 13 weeks) did not result in return of blood pressure to hypertensive levels in SHR. Age-matched WKY rats were not affected by tin treatment. These findings provide additional evidence that administration of tin, which stimulates heme oxygenase, thereby producing depletion of cytochrome P450, restores blood pressure to normal levels in SHR.\r"

  ".W": "To investigate intracellular pH (pHi) in human resistance arteries in essential hypertension, vessels were obtained from small biopsies of skin and subcutaneous fat from 14 untreated patients, and the results were compared with those from 14 matched normotensive control volunteers. Segments of isolated resistance arteries were mounted in a myograph and loaded with the pH-sensitive fluorescent dye 2',7'-bis(2-carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein. Fluorescence signals were monitored using a series of barrier filters and chromatic beam splitters. In this way both resting pHi and the changes in pHi observed during isometric contractions initiated by agonists could be recorded. Resting pHi was not different in vessels from hypertensive patients (hypertensive, 7.24 +/- 0.06 versus control, 7.25 +/- 0.04 pH units). The application of ethylisopropylamiloride (EIPA) and 4,4'-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid (DIDS) demonstrated that both Na(+)-H+ exchange and bicarbonate-dependent membrane mechanisms contributed to pHi homeostasis but that neither system was overactive in hypertension (pHi change with EIPA in vessels from hypertensive versus control subjects was -0.11 +/- 0.02 and 0.13 +/- 0.03 pH units, respectively, and pHi change with DIDS in vessels from hypertensive versus control subjects was -0.097 +/- 0.05 and -0.091 +/- 0.03 pH units, respectively). The application of norepinephrine or 125 mM K+ solution induced contraction in the arterial segments with an accompanying fall in pHi. With norepinephrine this fall was significantly attenuated in vessels from hypertensive patients. These results fail to provide evidence for raised pHi in resistance arteries in human essential hypertension, and contrary to previous reports in circulating blood cells, Na(+)-H+ exchange is not overactive in the vessels of such patients.\r"

Five hundred and seventy-seven subjects were screened in an occupational survey. Alcohol consumption, documented with a 1-week retrospective diary was divided into two categories: \"recent\" and \"previous\" intake. Recent intake was defined as the amount consumed on days 1, 2, and 3 immediately preceding blood pressure measurement. Previous intake was defined as the amount consumed on days 4, 5, and 6 preceding blood pressure measurement. High recent alcohol intake significantly raised systolic and diastolic blood pressure in both men and women. Previous alcohol intake, however, did not appear to influence blood pressure. We conclude that the effect of alcohol on blood pressure appears to be predominantly due to alcohol consumed in the few days immediately preceding blood pressure measurement, with alcohol consumption before those few days exerting little effect on blood pressure.\r"

  ".W": "The Dahl salt-sensitive rat was used to investigate the effect of hypertension on indexes of copper status and to determine the extent to which dietary manipulation of copper attenuated, or exacerbated, the rate of sodium chloride-induced hypertension. Weanling salt-sensitive rats were fed, in a 2 x 3 factorial design, one of six diets that contained one of three levels of copper (2.0 micrograms/g marginal, 12 micrograms/g adequate, or 50 micrograms/g supplemental) and either control (0.4%) or high (4%) levels of sodium. Diets were fed to the rats for 11 weeks. Rats fed the high sodium diets were characterized by high plasma copper concentrations and ceruloplasmin activities compared with their respective control sodium rats. The magnitude of the sodium-induced rise in plasma copper and ceruloplasmin was affected by dietary copper intake; however, dietary copper intake had no effect on the development of hypertension in the high sodium groups. These results suggest that altered copper metabolism is secondary, rather than primary, to the development of sodium chloride-induced hypertension in the salt-sensitive rat. Red blood cell superoxide dismutase activity was reduced in rats fed the low copper diets compared with the adequate and supplemented copper groups. At the lower levels of copper intake, sodium chloride-induced hypertension increased red blood cell superoxide dismutase activity in a manner consistent with the plasma copper and ceruloplasmin changes observed. However, at adequate or supplemental levels of dietary copper, red blood cell superoxide dismutase activity plateaued, suggesting possible saturation of copper at sites of hematopoeisis.\r"

Diuretics alone and sodium restriction alone are additive to converting enzyme inhibitor therapy. However, it is not known if these two ways of reducing sodium balance are additive in the presence of established converting enzyme inhibition. We therefore performed a double-blind crossover study of the effects of moderate sodium restriction in 21 patients with essential hypertension who were already being treated with the combination of a converting enzyme inhibitor and a diuretic. After 1 month of captopril (50 mg twice daily) and hydrochlorothiazide (25 mg once daily) therapy, with their usual sodium intake, average supine blood pressure was 147/96 +/- 5/3 (SEM) mm Hg 2 hours after treatment. Patients then reduced their sodium intake to around 80-100 mmol/day for the remainder of the study. After 2 weeks of sodium restriction, they entered a double-blind, randomized, crossover study of Slow Sodium (100 mmol sodium/day) compared with Slow Sodium placebo, while continuing sodium restriction and the above treatment.

  ".W": "Brown Norway kininogen-deficient rats had very low levels of plasma kininogens and lower levels of plasma prekallikrein, compared with those of normal rats of the same strain. Systolic blood pressure, determined by the tail-cuff method, of 5-week-old kininogen-deficient rats (106 +/- 0.4 mm Hg, n = 7) and the rate of systolic blood pressure increase with age were not different from those in normal rats. Weekly injections of deoxycorticosterone acetate (5 mg/kg s.c.) with 1% sodium chloride solution in drinking water after uninephrectomy at 7 weeks of age caused a gradual increase in the blood pressure of normal rats, reaching a plateau at 18 weeks of age, whereas that of deficient rats rose rapidly to 158 +/- 6 mm Hg 2 weeks after the start of treatment and continued to increase slightly, becoming significantly higher than normal rats at 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12 weeks of age (p less than 0.05 or 0.01). The levels of urinary prokallikrein and active kallikrein were slightly higher in deficient rats before deoxycorticosterone acetate-salt treatment but were not significantly increased after this treatment, whereas these levels in normal rats were increased 3.6- and 4.7-fold by this treatment. Urinary free kinin, collected from the ureter in untreated deficient rats, was below the detection limit. The plasma level of low molecular weight kininogen, the substrate of glandular kallikrein, was decreased in normal rats during the treatment. Continuous subcutaneous injection of aprotinin by an osmotic pump to normal rats induced significant increase in blood pressure. These results indicate that glandular kallikrein may play a suppressive role in deoxycorticosterone acetate-salt hypertension.\r"

  ".W": "This study was performed to determine divided renal efferent sympathetic nerve activity from kidneys in seven patients with renin-positive, unilateral renal artery stenosis before and 30 minutes after an acute intravenous dose of 1.25 mg enalaprilat. Renal norepinephrine release was calculated from split renal plasma flow, venoarterial plasma concentration gradients across the kidney, and the fractional extraction of tritiated norepinephrine. All patients had unilateral renin secretion, the affected kidney increasing its plasma renin activity gradient 1.7-fold, whereas no statistically significant change was noted on the contralateral side in response to enalaprilat. Total norepinephrine release to plasma and norepinephrine plasma clearance (assessed by isotope dilution) were similar before and after administration of enalaprilat (approximately 400 ng/min and 1.0 l/min), despite a 26% fall in mean arterial pressure (from 125 mm Hg, p less than 0.01). Heart rate remained unchanged. After enalaprilat, norepinephrine venoarterial difference increased in the renin-secreting kidney (from 264 to 396, SED = 57 pg/ml, p less than 0.05), whereas it increased only slightly in the contralateral kidney (from 149 to 256, SED = 72 pg/ml, NS). Tritiated norepinephrine extraction fell approximately 25% (p less than 0.01) in both kidneys. Thus, renal norepinephrine spillover increased from 49 to 62, SED = 9 ng/min (NS) and from 81 to 129, SED = 17 ng/min (p less than 0.05) from the affected and the contralateral kidney, respectively. Hence, in this relatively small study in patients with renovascular hypertension, no evidence for increased renal nerve activity could be observed in the affected kidney, despite its marked renin production.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Systemic blood pressure and right femoral blood flow were monitored in anesthetized rabbits. Arterial and femoral venous plasma angiotensin II (Ang II) and angiotensin I (Ang I) were measured by radioimmunoassay after high-performance liquid chromatography. Isoproterenol, 1 and 10 nmol/min, was infused intrafemoral arterially, reducing femoral vascular resistance by 47 +/- 5% and 60 +/- 6% in the sham-operated group, and by 50 +/- 6% and 63 +/- 4% in the nephrectomized group, respectively. The hemodynamic effect of isoproterenol was blocked by 2 mumol/kg propranolol injected intravenously plus 0.2 mumol/min infused intrafemoral arterially, indicating that the effect was beta-adrenergically mediated. In the sham-operated group, arterial Ang II and Ang I levels were increased, respectively, by 85 +/- 16% and 103 +/- 23% with the low dose of isoproterenol, and by 121 +/- 13% and 563 +/- 126% with the high dose of isoproterenol. The apparent femoral Ang II secretion rate was increased by 3.2-fold and 4.4-fold, and the apparent femoral Ang I secretion rate increased by 4.3-fold and 21.2-fold, with the low and high dose of isoproterenol, respectively. Propranolol abolished or markedly attenuated the increased arterial angiotensin levels and the increased femoral angiotensin secretion rates. Neither the low nor the high dose of isoproterenol caused any increase in plasma levels or the apparent femoral secretion rates of the angiotensins in the nephrectomized group. Low plasma levels of Ang I and Ang II remained in the nephrectomized group, representing some locally generated angiotensins.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Fractional reabsorption of water and chloride in the loop of Henle of DS/Jr rats was twice that observed in DR/Jr rats. Similar results were obtained in DS and DR rats of the Brookhaven strain. Urine flow and sodium and chloride excretions were 60% lower in DS than in DR rats at a renal perfusion pressure of 135 mm Hg.

To minimize the contribution of endogenously formed angiotensin II, all rats were pretreated with enalaprilat (2 mg i.v.) for 30 minutes before the right kidney was isolated and prepared for study. Renal perfusion pressure was set at 110 mm Hg and held constant. Afferent arteriolar diameter averaged 20.9 +/- 0.8 microns (n = 41) under control conditions. Exposure to 1.0 microM 2-chloroadenosine induced a significant (11.1 +/- 3.2%) reduction in vessel diameter, whereas a 100 microM concentration induced an afferent vasodilation (7.6 +/- 1.5%; p less than 0.05). These data are consistent with the preferential stimulation of high affinity constrictor adenosine receptors (A1) at lower concentrations and activation of lower affinity vasodilator adenosine receptors (A2) at higher concentrations. In contrast, ATP elicited a significant afferent vasoconstriction of approximately 9.2%, 12.9%, and 10.0% at concentrations in the range of 1-100 microM (p less than 0.05). Treatment with ADP, at concentrations up to 100 microM, failed to alter vessel caliber significantly. Furthermore, the nonhydrolyzable ATP analogue alpha,beta-methylene ATP produced a rapid and potent vasoconstriction, which mimicked the response to ATP. These data reveal the presence of both adenosine-sensitive P1 and ATP-sensitive P2 purinergic receptors on rat juxtamedullary afferent arterioles and demonstrate that ATP can induce afferent arteriolar vasoconstriction directly without first requiring hydrolysis to adenosine.\r"

Cortical and papillary blood flows were measured using a laser Doppler flowmeter. Cortical blood flow increased 28% after blockade of angiotensin II receptors with DuP 753 (2 mg/kg i.v., n = 6). Captopril (2 mg/kg i.v., n = 6) had no effect on cortical blood flow in rats pretreated with the angiotensin II antagonist. DuP 753 had no effect on papillary blood flow, nor did it prevent the rise in papillary blood flow produced by captopril (2 mg/kg, n = 6). Infusion of a kinin receptor antagonist, D-Arg, [Hyp3,Thi5,8,D-Phe7]-bradykinin (2.5 micrograms/min i.v.), reduced basal papillary blood flow by 15% and blocked the rise in papillary blood flow produced by captopril. Renal blood flow rose by 11% after DuP 753 (2 mg/kg, n = 6), and subsequent administration of captopril and the kinin antagonist had no effect on renal blood flow. Urine flow and sodium excretion increased after DuP 753, but captopril produced additional increases in urine flow and sodium excretion of 68% and 46% respectively. Fractional sodium excretion rose from 0.85 +/- 0.15% to 1.56 +/- 0.14% after captopril. Infusion of the kinin antagonist returned sodium and water excretion to control levels, but fractional sodium excretion was not significantly altered. Glomerular filtration rate was not altered by DuP 753 or captopril; however, it fell from 1.6 +/- 0.1 to 1.2 +/- 0.1 ml/min/g kidney wt during infusion of the kinin antagonist.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Ingestion of protein or intravenous infusion of amino acids acutely elevates glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and renal plasma flow (RPF) by unknown mechanisms. Endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF), now known to be nitric oxide derived from metabolism of L-arginine, participates in local regulation of vascular tone. To investigate the hypothesis that EDRF may participate in the renal vasodilatation and increased GFR after amino acid infusion, we characterized the effect of inhibition of EDRF synthesis with NG-monomethyl L-arginine (LNMMA) on basal renal hemodynamics and the response to infusion of a 10% mixed amino acid solution (1 ml/hr i.v.) in the rat. Renal arterial infusion of LNMMA (500 micrograms/kg/min) resulted in a significant increase in mean arterial pressure, decreases in GFR (20%) and RPF (44%), and a significant increase in filtration fraction. Pretreatment with the angiotensin II receptor antagonist Sar-Gly-angiotensin II did not prevent the increase in blood pressure but blunted the decreases in GFR (11%) and RPF (27%) after LNMMA infusion. Amino acid infusion in the untreated, fasted rat resulted in no change in blood pressure but significant increases in GFR and RPF; these effects were completely inhibited by intrarenal LNMMA but not an equihypertensive intravenous infusion of phenylephrine. In summary, EDRF participates in regulation of basal renal hemodynamics. Furthermore, amino acid-induced hyperfiltration and renal vasodilatation are completely prevented by inhibition of EDRF synthesis. We conclude that EDRF may participate in the renal hemodynamic response to amino acid infusion.\r"

Although they have been studied extensively in large vessels, little is known about their actions in renal microvessels. Using microdissected rabbit afferent arterioles, we studied the vascular response to synthetic endothelin and its interaction with EDRF and the effect of endothelin on renin release. Afferent arterioles were either microperfused in vitro at 60 mm Hg to measure luminal diameter or incubated without microperfusion to assess renin release. When added to the bath, 10(-10) or 10(-9) M endothelin decreased the diameter by 32 +/- 8% (n = 7, p less than 0.01) or 76 +/- 7% (p less than 0.0001), respectively. Pretreatment with Nw-nitro L-arginine, which inhibits synthesis of EDRF, decreased basal diameter by 15 +/- 1% (p less than 0.001) and augmented endothelin-induced constriction; decrease in diameter with 10(-10) M endothelin was 78 +/- 10% (n = 4, p less than 0.01 versus nontreated). In afferent arterioles preconstricted by endothelin, acetylcholine at concentrations of 10(-8) to 10(-5) M increased the diameter in a dose-dependent manner.

However, the features of sympathetic nerve activity are still unknown in secondary hypertension. We examined MSNA in eight patients with renovascular hypertension and in 11 patients with primary aldosteronism. Twenty patients with essential hypertension and 20 normotensive subjects who were age-matched to the patients with renovascular hypertension and those with primary aldosteronism were also studied. The MSNA of a bundle of the tibial nerve was recorded by microneurography in supine subjects and expressed as both burst rate (bursts/min) and burst incidence (bursts/100 heart beats). Plasma renin activity and the plasma concentration of angiotensin II and aldosterone were also measured. MSNA was increased in the patients with renovascular hypertension compared with the patients with primary aldosteronism and those with essential hypertension and the normotensive subjects (p less than 0.01 for each). MSNA was decreased in the patients with primary aldosteronism compared with those with essential hypertension (p less than 0.01), and it was smaller than in the normotensive subjects (p less than 0.1). Furthermore, MSNA, plasma renin activity, and the plasma concentration of angiotensin II decreased significantly in five patients with renovascular hypertension 4-10 days after successful percutaneous renal angioplasty. Thus, the changes in MSNA seem to characterize the pathophysiology of renovascular hypertension and primary aldosteronism. Activation of the renin-angiotensin system may be involved in the increase in the central outflow of sympathetic nerve activity, thus exacerbating hypertension in patients with renovascular hypertension.\r"

To evaluate the effects of treatment on hemodynamics, we compared the results of Swan-Ganz measurements in 87 preeclamptic women who had received no treatment at all with those obtained in 47 preeclamptic women who had received various drugs and intravenous fluids. Control values were obtained in 10 normotensive pregnant volunteers. Measurements were performed between 25 and 34 weeks of gestation.

Cardiac output was measured with chronically implanted electromagnetic flow probes on the ascending aorta. Regional blood flow velocity was measured with pulsed Doppler flow probes on the superior mesenteric (n = 7), left renal (n = 7), and right iliac (n = 7) arteries. Doppler flow probes were calibrated in situ in each rat to determine regional blood flow values. Neurohumoral reflex control of pressure was removed pharmacologically, and blood pressure and cardiac output were returned to resting control values with intravenous norepinephrine infusion, which was maintained at that constant level throughout the study. Hemodynamic changes were measured in response to blood volume expansion with infusion of 0.9 ml blood over 6 minutes. This small change in blood volume resulted in significant increases in vascular resistance of 15% in the whole body, 8% in the intestine, 18% in the kidney, and 15% in the hind limb. The pressure-flow slope, used as an index of autoregulation (slope = 0, perfect autoregulation; slope = 1, rigid vasculature), averaged 0.34 in the whole body, 0.52 in the intestine, 0.19 in the kidney, and 0.39 in the hind limb. When compared with the whole body, blood flow autoregulation was less in the intestine, greater in the kidney, and the same in the hind limb.\r"

Serial changes in mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate, and blood pressure variability were recorded. In sinoaortic-denervated rabbits with unilateral nephrectomy, MAP increased significantly from 109 +/- 2 to 124 +/- 3 mm Hg (day 4) and remained elevated for the rest of the experiment. This elevation of MAP was accompanied by a reduction in the standard deviation of MAP, with significant elevations in plasma vasopressin, norepinephrine, and atrial natriuretic peptide concentrations and in sodium retention. In the other groups, there were no significant changes in these vasoactive hormones. In the sham-operated sinoaortic-denervated rabbits with unilateral nephrectomy, sodium retention was similar to that of sinoaortic-denervated rabbits with unilateral nephrectomy. Continuous infusion (1 microgram/kg/hr) of a V1 antagonist prevented the elevation of blood pressure and plasma norepinephrine, the accumulation of sodium, and the reduction of blood pressure lability, whereas a bolus injection (10 micrograms/kg) on day 4 reduced blood pressure from 128 +/- 3 to 115 +/- 2 mm Hg (p less than 0.005). These results imply that vasopressin plays a crucial role in the expression of salt-induced hypertension in rabbits with compromised baroreceptor and renal function.\r"

The presence of Med I in the renal venous effluent has been established by thin-layer chromatography, by the type of vasodepressor effect when injected intravenously as a bolus into the hypertensive rat, by inhibition of the vasodepressor effect of the renal venous effluent by Tween 20 and SKF 525A (proadifen, inhibitor of cytochrome P-450), and by removal of the liver from the circulation (a procedure that inhibits extracted Med I). Med I so derived lowered blood pressure of spontaneously hypertensive rats when injected into the stomach by an indwelling tube or when given by mouth. The lowering of blood pressure was attended by no change in cardiac output and no change in heart rate. Med I given by mouth to the spontaneously hypertensive rat is a vasodilator that suppresses sympathetic tone, acting in the same way as Med I extracted from renal papillae and given intravenously. Importantly, the antihypertensive action was demonstrated in the spontaneously hypertensive rat, a model of hypertension considered to mimic idiopathic or essential hypertension of humans. Med I is a promising therapeutic agent for hypertension.\r"

Two new substrains, SHR/a and SHR/y, were developed using a series of backcrosses to isolate each of these components. The SHR/a substrain has the autosomal loci and X chromosome from the SHR strain and the Y chromosome from the Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rat strain. The SHR/y substrain has only the Y chromosome from the SHR and autosomal loci and X chromosome from the WKY strain. Throughout these breeding programs parents were chosen at random without selection for blood pressure. Males of both substrains maintained blood pressures over 180 mm Hg. Comparisons of blood pressure in these new substrains with the original parental strains can be used to determine the relative proportions of each genetic component in hypertension. The Y chromosome component contributes 34 mm Hg, which is the difference between SHR/y male and WKY male blood pressure. The total autosomal component contributes 46 mm Hg, which is the difference between SHR/a male and WKY male blood pressure. The autosomal component is a sex-influenced trait; males in the SHR/a strain have significantly higher pressures than SHR/a females. Of the 46 mm Hg estimated for the autosomal component, 41 mm Hg is the result of these loci interacting with male phenotypic sex. This sex-influenced component is separate and distinct from the Y chromosome component.\r"

Female King-Holtzman rats (n = 15), heterozygous for the testicular feminization (Tfm) gene, were crossed with male spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), and blood pressure was measured weekly from 5-14 weeks in the F1 hybrid males. Approximately 50% of the F1 hybrid males were Tfm males and androgen receptor-deficient, and 50% were normal. Blood pressure in the parent King-Holtzman males, Tfms, and female rats was also followed for the same time period. The F1 normal male hybrids had a significantly higher (p less than 0.05) systolic blood pressure than the Tfm hybrid males after 12 weeks (195 +/- 8 versus 170 +/- 8 mm Hg, respectively). Blood pressure in the male and Tfm Holtzman rats was 120 +/- 5 mm Hg and 110 +/- 6 mm Hg, respectively. Castration lowered blood pressure by 38 mm Hg in the hybrid males and 27 mm Hg in the Tfm hybrids. Female F1 hybrids also showed a pressure rise above that of female Holtzman controls (155 +/- 6 mm Hg versus 110 +/- 6 mm Hg, p less than 0.01) but lower than the F1 males and Tfm hybrids. Ovariectomized females with testosterone implants did not show an elevation in blood pressure. Plasma electrolytes, norepinephrine, and cholesterol were not significantly different between normal and Tfm hybrid males. The results suggest that the presence of an androgen receptor and a testis-derived factor mediate the blood pressure rise in the hybrid males.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The aim of this study was to investigate the action of the heptapeptide angiotensin-(1-7) on the spontaneous activity of paraventricular neurons using microiontophoresis. Recent immunocytochemical investigations have shown that this product of angiotensin I is predominantly located in cells and fibers of the forebrain and brain stem. Our results show that most neurons in the paraventricular nucleus are excited by angiotensin-(1-7) at a dose of 50-80 nA. In comparison with angiotensin II or angiotensin III, the onset of response and the occurrence of the maximal effect were significantly delayed. With higher doses of angiotensin-(1-7), there was a decrease in latency and a dose-dependent increase in firing frequency. Of all the angiotensin compounds tested, angiotensin III was the most potent. Preliminary results obtained with an angiotensin antagonist show that the action of angiotensin II, angiotensin III, and angiotensin-(1-7) is blocked by the angiotensin receptor subtype 2 antagonist CGP 42112A. Because the angiotensin-(1-7) system in the brain is associated with central vasopressinergic pathways, vasopressin was tested in a similar way. Neurons in the paraventricular nucleus that were excited by iontophoretically applied angiotensins showed a weak response to vasopressin. Occasionally, a small excitatory action was observed. Our results support the hypothesis that the heptapeptide angiotensin-(1-7) is a biologically active neuropeptide. The data also suggest that amino terminal fragments of angiotensin II are not inactive degradation products.\r"

  ".W": "We have identified two distinct cellular responses that occur in human astrocytes in the presence of angiotensin (Ang) peptides and are linked to specific receptor subtypes. Ang II and the N-terminal heptapeptide Ang-(1-7) stimulated release of prostaglandin (PG) E2 and PGI2 (measured as the stable metabolite 6-keto-PGF1 alpha). In contrast, only Ang II but not Ang-(1-7) activated phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C, leading to mobilization of intracellular calcium. The Ang II-induced PGE2 and PGI2 syntheses were attenuated by [Sar1,Ile8]Ang II but not by [Sar1,Thr8]Ang II. Ang-(1-7)-induced PGE2 and PGI2 syntheses were not inhibited by either of these two classical antagonists. DuP 753, a subtype 1-selective Ang receptor antagonist, blocked the Ang II-induced release of PGE2 but not PGI2. In contrast, CGP 42112A, the subtype 2-selective antagonist, totally blocked the Ang II-induced PGI2 release and partially attenuated the PGE2 release. Ang-(1-7)-induced PGE2 and PGI2 release was not altered by DuP 753; however, CGP 42112A totally blocked the effects of Ang-(1-7) on PG stimulation. Calcium mobilization in response to Ang II was blocked by [Sar1,Thr8]Ang II, [Sar1,Ile8]Ang II, and DuP 753 but not by CGP 42112A. These data suggest that human astrocytes contain both Ang receptor subtypes. The subtype 1 Ang receptor participates both in the release of PGs and in the mobilization of calcium, whereas the subtype 2 receptor is coupled to the release of PGs only. In addition, PG release coupled to subtype 2 Ang II receptors occurs through a calcium-independent mechanism and responds uniquely to Ang-(1-7).\r"

Anatomical evidence suggests that Ang II binding sites in the medial NTS are located presynaptically on vagal afferent fibers that may contain SP and are codistributed with SP binding sites located postsynaptically on intrinsic medial NTS neurons. To evaluate whether the similar cardiovascular effects of Ang II and SP in the medial NTS could involve Ang II-evoked release of SP, we compared the effects of these peptides on the spontaneous activity of medial NTS neurons recorded in vitro and determined whether Ang II evoked release of SP from rat medulla slices. Both Ang II and SP (1 microM in artificial cerebrospinal fluid) excited 11 of 40 medial NTS neurons. In these cells, the peak response latency was significantly longer to Ang II than to SP (59.5 +/- 4.7 versus 26.5 +/- 2.4 seconds, p less than 0.0001). When rat medulla slices were perfused with Ang II (2 microM in Krebs' bicarbonate), release of SP immunoreactivity was increased by 400% over control perfusion with Krebs' solution alone (p less than 0.05). We have provided the first evidence for an excitatory action of Ang II on neurons in the NTS of the rat and for excitation by both Ang II and SP of a subset of neurons in the medial NTS. Moreover, we have shown for the first time that Ang II can stimulate the release of SP immunoreactivity from the brain.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The subtype 1-selective Ang II receptor antagonists, DuP 753 (2-n-butyl-4-chloro-5-(hydroxymethyl)-1-[(2'-(1H- tetrazol-5-yl)biphenyl-4-yl)methyl]imidazole, potassium salt) and EXP3174 (2-n-butyl-4-chloro-1-[(2'-(1H-tetrazol-5-yl) biphenyl-4-yl)methyl]imidazole-5-carboxylic acid) given intra-arterially to the kidney caused dose-dependent reductions of renal vasoconstrictor responses to RNS but not to norepinephrine. In contrast, the subtype 2-selective Ang II receptor specific ligand, PD 123177 (1-[(4-amino-3-methylphenyl)methyl]-5-(diphenylacetyl)-4,5,6,7- tetrahydro-1H-imidazo[4,5-c]pyridine-6-carboxylic acid), did not alter the renal vasoconstrictor responses to RNS, norepinephrine, and Ang II in doses of 10-100 micrograms/kg/min i.a. Captopril also reduced the renal vasoconstrictor responses to RNS but not to norepinephrine. However, saralasin did not alter the renal vasoconstrictor responses to RNS and norepinephrine, although it was as effective as DuP 753 and EXP3174 in blocking the renal vasoconstrictor response to Ang II. These results suggest that endogenous Ang II enhances renal adrenergic function at the prejunctional site in anesthetized dogs. Analogous to the Ang II receptor in vascular smooth muscle, the prejunctional Ang II receptor appears to be of subtype 1. Mechanisms accounting for the absence of the inhibition of Ang II-mediated renal adrenergic response by saralasin remain to be determined.\r"

NG108-15 cells contain a high-affinity binding site for Ang II, with a Kd of 1.1 nM and a Bmax of 6.5 fmol/mg protein. Ang peptides competed for 125I-Ang II binding with an order of potency of Ang II greater than Ang-(2-8) much greater than Ang-(1-7). The subtype 1 (or B)-selective Ang II receptor antagonist DuP 753 as well as [Sar1,Ile8]Ang II and [Sar1,Thr8]Ang II competed for Ang II binding with high affinity, whereas the subtype 2 (or A)-selective Ang receptor antagonist CGP 42112A was partially effective only at a 300-fold higher concentration. When NG108-15 cells were induced to differentiate by treatment with dibutyryl cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate, the density of Ang II receptors increased dramatically, with little change in affinity (1.1 versus 4.2 nM) or competition by Ang peptides. In marked contrast to undifferentiated cells, CGP 42112A became a potent competitor (IC50, 1 nM) for the majority (90-95%) of Ang II binding, whereas DuP 753 competed for only 5-10% of the binding sites. Ang II caused a dose-dependent mobilization of cytosolic Ca2+ in undifferentiated NG108-15 cells through activation of phospholipase C and the production of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate. In these cells, Ca2+ mobilization was blocked by either DuP 753 or the sarcosine Ang II analogues, whereas CGP 42112A was ineffective.

Distribution studies revealed the presence of specific ANF binding sites in a number of central nervous system areas examined. C-ANF at 10(-6) M competed for 125I-ANF binding to a much lower extent than ANF in many of those structures, whereas ANF-(106-113)-NH2 at 10(-6) M did not have a significant effect on the radioligand binding except in the choroid plexus, pia-arachnoid, and olfactory bulb. Analysis of the competition curves revealed that in the choroid plexus, pia-arachnoid, olfactory bulb, subfornical organ, area postrema, and habenular nucleus, ANF interacts with its binding sites with high affinity (IC50, 0.46-0.77 nM). In contrast, C-ANF and ANF-(106-113)-NH2 competed for 125I-ANF binding with high potency (IC50, 2-16 nM) in the choroid plexus and pia-arachnoid only, where they were able to displace 60-70% of the radioligand binding. 125I-ANF cross-linking to olfactory bulb membranes resolved a specific 120-kDa band corresponding to the high molecular weight receptor but did not disclose a specifically labeled band corresponding to the low molecular mass receptor.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The brain natriuretic peptide mRNA level in the ventricle was 52% of that in the atrium, whereas the atrial natriuretic peptide mRNA level in the ventricle was approximately two orders of magnitude lower than that in the atrium. Taking atrial and ventricular weights into account, the total amount of brain natriuretic peptide mRNA in the ventricle represented 77% of that in the whole heart.

In one group (n = 19), Na+ excretion increased significantly during SNS arousal, which then decreased significantly during recovery (12.3 versus 16.0 versus 13.1 meq/hr, baseline, SNS arousal, recovery, respectively). Changes in Na+ excretion were correlated with changes in creatinine clearance from baseline to SNS arousal (r = 0.54) and SNS arousal to recovery (r = 0.58), and were accompanied by significant increases in plasma renin activity (1.5 versus 2.0 ng/ml/hr) and aldosterone (8.5 versus 10.3 ng/ml/hr) from baseline to SNS arousal. Na+ excretion decreased during SNS arousal in the other group of subjects (n = 17) and remained below baseline levels during recovery (16.2 versus 12.7 versus 11.9 meq/hr). These changes were associated with significant decreases in creatinine clearance from baseline to recovery (138 versus 121 ml/min/1.73 m2) and significant increases in plasma renin activity from baseline to SNS arousal (1.3 versus 2.2 ng/ml/hr) but not in aldosterone. Control subjects (n = 24) maintained baseline levels of each variable throughout the procedure. These results suggest that individuals differ in Na+ handling and regulation during behavioral arousal.

  ".W": "Six control dogs, six dogs treated with 1.5 mg/kg b.i.d. quinapril, and six dogs treated with 8 mg/kg q.d. minoxidil underwent 6 hours daily of hindquarter compression for 9 weeks. Minoxidil significantly decreased baseline blood pressure (-17 mm Hg; p less than or equal to 0.01), whereas quinapril decreased baseline blood pressure 11 mm Hg but not significantly (p = 0.15). Hindquarter compression elicited blood pressure increases in all three groups (control +18, quinapril +13, minoxidil +19 mm Hg). After 9 weeks, left ventricular mass in control dogs increased 22% (p less than 0.004); a similar increase was seen in minoxidil-treated dogs (+22%, p less than 0.0001) but not in the quinapril-treated group (+4%, p less than 0.15). The increase in left ventricular mass in control dogs was concentric (increased epicardial volume only), whereas in the minoxidil group, the hypertrophy was eccentric (both epicardial and endocardial volumes increased). The minimal hypertrophy in the quinapril group was concentric (no change in epicardial, but a decrease in endocardial volume). Quinapril had little hypotensive effect, but prevented the development of left ventricular hypertrophy, whereas minoxidil did not prevent hypertrophy in spite of its hypotensive effect. The mechanism of this differential effect of direct vasodilation versus converting enzyme inhibition on left ventricular hypertrophy is not fully elucidated. The results with quinapril suggest that some antihypertensive agents may positively affect left ventricular hypertrophy in spite of the absence of a large effect on baseline blood pressure or on blood pressure reactivity.\r"

These animals are normotensive. In the present study, the renal and cardiovascular systems are characterized, revealing some surprising findings. Not only are the TAG+ mice normotensive in the face of pronounced renal pathology but also in the presence of an increase in plasma volume. These data raise interesting questions about blood pressure physiology and renal function of the TAG+ mice. Blood nitrogen urea of the TAG+ animal was markedly elevated and plasma creatinine level was in the normal range, indicating prerenal azotemia without renal failure. These findings are consistent with impaired renal perfusion with secondary volume expansion probably as the result of vascular hyperplasia. These transgenic animals provide a unique genetic model for studying the physiology of primarily renal vascular hyperplasia as well as blood pressure control in a low renin state.\r"

There had been no reports of a cardiovascular role for the nucleus prepositus hypoglossi; thus, we sought to determine if electrical or chemical stimulation of that nucleus or the adjacent medial vestibular nucleus altered arterial pressure or heart rate in 24 anesthetized rats. Both types of stimuli to the caudal, but not the rostral, pole of the nucleus prepositus hypoglossi or to the medial vestibular nucleus elicited an increase in arterial pressure; bradycardia accompanied the former and tachycardia the latter. Both the nucleus prepositus hypoglossi and medial vestibular nucleus may participate in central cardiovascular regulation.\r"

Thirteen male Sprague-Dawley rats were studied. Bilateral electrolytic lesions in the LPBN were produced in six rats; the remaining seven rats were subjected to sham lesion surgery only. All rats were instrumented with vascular catheters and housed in metabolism cages. Daily measurements during the 16-day protocol included arterial pressure, heart rate, water intake, urine output, and urinary sodium excretion. Periodically throughout the protocol depressor responses to ganglion blockade and to blockade of V1-type vasopressin receptors also were measured. The protocol was divided into three control-period days, 10 days of continuous (24 hr/day) angiotensin II infusion (10 ng/min i.v.), and three recovery-period days. There were no significant differences between the two groups of rats for any variable during the control period. During angiotensin II infusion, sham-lesion rats exhibited a progressive increase in arterial pressure and the depressor response to ganglion blockade and a decrease in urinary sodium excretion. No other variable was significantly changed. In rats with LPBN lesions, arterial pressure was significantly increased only on days 1 and 3 of angiotensin II infusion. No other variable was affected. It was concluded that ablation of the LPBN in rats prevented sustained hypertension during intravenous infusion of angiotensin II by interfering with neurogenic pressor mechanisms normally activated by the peptide.\r"

  ".W": "It has been shown that endothelin-1 (ET-1) binding sites exist in the central nervous system and that the injection of intracerebroventricular ET-1 induces a pressor response. Therefore, we determined the neurohormonal and cardiovascular responses to intracerebroventricular ET-1 (25 pmol/kg) in conscious rabbits with chronically instrumented electrodes on the renal sympathetic nerve. Intracerebroventricular ET-1 provoked a prompt increase in arterial pressure and in renal sympathetic nerve activity within 5 minutes, and peak values were obtained at 20 and 40 minutes, respectively. Plasma epinephrine and norepinephrine reached peak values at 5-20 minutes. Plasma vasopressin and plasma glucose levels also increased significantly, but plasma osmolality, hematocrit, and serum sodium and potassium concentrations did not show any changes. Arterial blood gas analysis showed respiratory alkalosis. However, pretreatment with intravenous pentolinium (5 mg/kg), a ganglion blocking agent, abolished these neurohormonal and cardiovascular responses. Conversely, the same dose of intravenous ET-1 (25 pmol/kg) as that used in the intracerebroventricular experiment failed to cause any cardiovascular or renal sympathetic nerve responses. These results suggest that intracerebroventricular ET-1 acts in the central nervous system and causes a pressor response mainly through the enhancement of sympathoadrenal outflow.\r"

  ".W": "When Dahl salt-resistant (DR) rats are given mild post-deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA) hypertension, they will have, within 8 weeks, a 53% mortality on a high NaCl diet, without a rise of blood pressure. Forty-two DR rats were given DOCA in silicone (250 mg/kg) and 1% NaCl to drink. After 4 weeks, the DOCA and 1% saline were removed and replaced with a low NaCl diet and tap water. One week later, they were divided into two groups perfectly matched for blood pressure (154 mm Hg). One group had the aqueduct of Sylvius blocked with silicone and epoxy materials; the other group had a sham block. After 4 more recovery weeks on a low NaCl diet, blood pressure averaged 171 mm Hg in sham rats and 147 mm Hg in truly blocked rats (p less than 0.0001). Thus, the aqueduct block prevented most of the post-DOCA hypertension and permitted a strong post-DOCA recovery from the acute DOCA hypertension. The rats with the sham block had an actual rise in blood pressure during the post-DOCA recovery period. The vicious cycle leading to permanent post-DOCA NaCl hypertension was broken by the aqueduct block. Then both groups began an 8% high NaCl diet, and after 4 weeks, blood pressure averaged 184 mm Hg in sham and 155 mm Hg in truly blocked rats (p less than 0.0001). After 12 weeks on 8% NaCl, all sham rats had died (28 of 28), whereas only one of 14 truly blocked rats had died (93% reduction in mortality, p less than 0.0001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Because insulin resistance may be both tissue and pathway specific, it is possible that the degree to which insulin resistance is tissue specific determines whether hypertension will develop in specific individuals or animals.\r"

Resistance arteries (approximately 250-300 microns i.d.) were perfused under controlled pressure and flow conditions, and changes in arterial diameter registered with an automated video device. In any particular segment, diameter measurements were normalized to that observed at 5 mm Hg. Changes in active wall force were determined by relating the observed diameter under a particular set of conditions to the diameter at the same intramural pressure when smooth muscle tone was inhibited (calcium-free physiological saline solution) and to the diameter when smooth muscle cells were activated close to maximum (KCl; 89 mM). At 60 mm Hg, the diameter decrease of 21% in the absence of flow represented stretch-induced tone. No additional changes in diameter were encountered with a flow of 20 microliters/min. Diameter decreased a further 7% at 100 microliters/min. When intraluminal pressure was 90 mm Hg, diameter decreased 39% without flow. Additional constriction of 10% and 19% occurred at flows of 20 and 100 microliters/min, respectively. At the higher pressure, the vasoconstriction occasioned by flow was significantly greater than that at the lower pressure. After endothelium inactivation by passing hypo-osmotic Krebs' solution followed by air through the segment, mean diameter was less at each combination of pressure and flow, although this difference did not reach statistical significance. The diameter reductions to increases in pressure from 60 to 90 mm Hg and to flow at 40 microliters/min were not altered by endothelium inactivation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Resting arteriolar tone was higher in 1K1C rats than in controls, and vasodilation to acetylcholine and bradykinin, but not to nitroprusside, was reduced (p less than 0.05) in 1K1C rats compared with controls. LNMMA increased arteriolar tone (p less than 0.05) and inhibited the vasodilator responses to acetylcholine and bradykinin (p less than 0.05) in controls but not in 1K1C rats. LNMMA did not alter the response to nitroprusside in either group. Addition of indomethacin to LNMMA increased arteriolar tone and markedly reduced the response to bradykinin, but not to acetylcholine or nitroprusside, in both groups. These findings suggest that resting arteriolar tone is increased in 1K1C rats partially because of the decreased basal release or synthesis of nitric oxide. Responses to the endothelium-dependent vasodilators acetylcholine and bradykinin were attenuated in 1K1C rats, possibly because of changes in synthesis or release of nitric oxide for acetylcholine and of prostacyclin for bradykinin, because the response to the endothelium-independent vasodilator nitroprusside did not differ between the groups.\r"

In urethane-anesthetized rats, the administration of the novel nitric oxide synthesis inhibitor L-N-nitro arginine (LNA) (0.02 mmol/kg i.v.) increased mean arterial pressure and renal, mesenteric, and hindquarter vascular resistances. The intravenous administration of L-arginine (60 mg/kg plus 12 mg/kg/min i.v.) produced small reductions in arterial pressure and vascular resistances and abolished the hemodynamic effects of LNA. Pretreatment with the ganglion blocking agent chlorisondamine lowered mean arterial pressure and vascular resistances, abolished the LNA-induced pressor and renal vasoconstrictor response, and attenuated the increases in mesenteric and hindquarter resistances. In contrast, the vasodilator hydralazine lowered mean arterial pressure and vascular resistances to levels equivalent to that of ganglionic blockade; however, the subsequent administration of LNA still produced significant increases in arterial pressure and regional vascular resistances. In ganglion-blocked rats in which pressure and vascular resistances were returned to normal levels by infusion of arginine vasopressin or phenylephrine, the pressor and vasoconstrictor effects of LNA were restored. However, phenylephrine was significantly more efficacious and markedly exaggerated the action of LNA. These results suggest that the sympathetic nervous system plays an important role in modulating the synthesis or release of vascular nitric oxide through the effects of 1) normal sympathetic discharge, 2) humoral activation of alpha-adrenergic receptors, and 3) vascular tone per se.\r"

Our previous investigations in hypertensive rats failed to demonstrate changes in aortic steady-state mRNA levels of PDGF A or B chains. The current studies were performed to determine whether hypertension might affect the expression of PDGF receptors. We studied PDGF alpha- and beta-receptor gene expression by Northern analysis using human and rat cDNA probes. Studies of tissue distribution revealed that PDGF beta-receptor mRNA was most abundant in total aorta and aortic media, whereas the PDGF alpha-receptor mRNA was most abundant in the lung and was expressed at low levels in aortic tissue. Deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA)-salt hypertension induced a threefold increase in aortic steady-state PDGF beta-receptor mRNA levels. Aortic PDGF beta-receptor expression also was higher in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) when compared with age-matched normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) controls. Aortic PDGF alpha-receptor steady-state mRNA levels were unchanged in DOCA-salt hypertension and were expressed at similar levels in WKY rats and SHRs. Unlike the findings with aorta, cardiac PDGF beta- and alpha-receptor and PDGF B-chain expressions were unchanged in the DOCA-salt model and were decreased in SHRs. These findings indicate that hypertension can increase aortic steady-state mRNA levels for PDGF beta-receptor. They also indicate that tissue-specific expression of the genes of the PDGF ligand/receptor system are differentially regulated in hypertension.\r"

Transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) has a bimodal effect on vascular smooth muscle cell growth, depending on cell density. The present study investigated the relation between cell density and expression of the proto-oncogene c-fos and TGF-beta 1 in cells from WKY rats and SHRs. The results demonstrate an increased accumulation of c-fos mRNA in calf serum-stimulated SHR cells but only at a high cell density. The expression of TGF-beta 1 mRNA was enhanced in growing SHR cells at every density studied as early as 24 hours after inoculation, with a further increase at later times. The effect of exogenous TGF-beta 1 on new DNA synthesis was evaluated by [3H]thymidine incorporation. At a low cell density, TGF-beta 1 had no effect on DNA synthesis in either WKY or SHR vascular smooth muscle cells. At a high cell density, there was a significant increase of DNA synthesis in response to TGF-beta 1 in SHR cells without any effect in WKY cells. In conclusion, contact inhibition of vascular smooth muscle cells from SHRs at a higher cell density is accompanied by an earlier expression of the marker gene c-fos and preceded by an exaggerated expression of TGF-beta 1.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Loss of microvessels (anatomic rarefaction) occurs in chronic reduced renal mass (RRM) hypertension and is mediated via structural degeneration of vascular smooth muscle (VSM) and endothelial cells. The purpose of the present study was to determine if structural changes occur in VSM cells of the microvessels that remain in the tissue of rats with chronic RRM hypertension. Samples of cremaster muscles were taken from normotensive control rats and rats with acute (3-7 days) and chronic (14-28 days) RRM hypertension (75% reduction in kidney mass with 4% NaCl loading). The samples were fixed in situ and processed for light and electron microscopy. Ultrastructural morphology of VSM cells in terminal arterioles of control animals was normal. Although VSM morphology in many microvessels of RRM hypertensive rats was also normal, some vessels exhibited structural changes that were not present in arterioles of the normotensive animals. The most striking change was the appearance of more extensive dense bodies anchoring the contractile filaments around the outer membrane of the cells. Extreme vasoconstriction was observed in some arterioles of RRM rats as long as 2 weeks after salt loading. Focal areas of VSM cell proliferation were evident. Many of the changes occurring in RRM were detected as early as 1 week after the onset of hypertension. These observations suggest that renal mass reduction-salt loading hypertension is associated with early structural and functional changes in the VSM cells.\r"

  ".U": "91257980\r", 
  ".W": "In addition to preserving the permselectivity of the vascular wall and providing an antithrombogenic surface, the vascular endothelium contributes importantly to the regulation of vasomotor tone. Indeed, the endothelium participates in the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II; the enzymatic inactivation of several plasma constituents such as bradykinin, norepinephrine, serotonin, and ADP; and the synthesis and release of vasodilator substances such as prostacyclin and the recently discovered endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF). The diffusible EDRF released from the endothelium is nitric oxide or a substance closely related to it such as nitrosothiol. The endothelium also synthesizes and releases vasoconstrictive factors, including products derived from arachidonic acid metabolism and the recently discovered peptide endothelin. An increasing body of evidence from experimental and clinical studies indicates that EDRF and endothelium-derived contracting factors play an important role in vascular physiology and pathology. It has become apparent that the balance of these factors may be a major determinant of systemic and regional hemodynamics. Moreover, through generally opposite effects on growth-related vascular changes, contracting factors such as endothelin and relaxing factors such as EDRF also may be important determinants of the vascular response to injury in various disease states such as atherosclerosis and hypertension. It is clear that the vascular endothelium is a complex and dynamic organ. Understanding endothelium function in normal physiology and disease states is of potential clinical importance and should be the focus of future investigation.\r"

  ".U": "91257981\r", 
  ".W": "Recent studies suggest that humoral and endothelium-dependent mechanisms may play an important role in the cerebral circulation. Angiotensin may acutely and chronically increase resistance of large cerebral arteries and reduce cerebral microvascular pressure without changing cerebral blood flow. We hypothesize that the brain may sense reductions in microvascular pressure and initiate compensatory neurohumoral responses to raise arterial pressure. Vasopressin appears to play an important role in regulation of production of cerebrospinal fluid and brain fluid volume. Vasopressin also may be protective when intracranial pressure is elevated. Endothelium-dependent mechanisms also may have important influences on tone of cerebral vessels. Synthesis of the endothelium-derived relaxing factor nitric oxide, or a nitric oxide-containing compound, appears to influence both basal tone and responses of large cerebral arteries to acetylcholine in vivo. Large cerebral arteries dilate in response to increased blood flow in vivo, and this response may be mediated in part by release of a humoral factor by endothelium. Endothelium-dependent responses of cerebral arterioles to receptor- and nonreceptor-mediated agonists are impaired during chronic hypertension. The mechanism of impairment of endothelium-dependent responses of cerebral arterioles appears to involve production of an endothelium-derived contracting factor.\r"

This human OLC was tested for its effects on evoked tension in guinea pig left atria and aortic rings. The tissues were incubated at 37 degrees C in bicarbonate-buffered physiological salt solution gassed with 95% O2-5% CO2. In atria stimulated electrically at 1 Hz, 85 and 170 nM human OLC increased peak active force to 177 +/- 15% and 313 +/- 32% of control, respectively (n = 3), with little effect on the duration of contraction. On washout of the OLC, peak systolic force returned to the control level with a half-time of 4.3 +/- 0.5 minutes. Similar results were obtained with 160 nM plant-derived ouabain: peak systolic force increased to 310 +/- 31% of control (n = 4) and returned to the control level with a half-time of 3.8 +/- 0.2 minutes during washout. In aortic rings, neither 170 nM human OLC nor 160 nM plant ouabain (30-minute treatments) affected resting (unstimulated) tension, but they increased the contractions evoked by histamine (0.2-1.0 microM) to 156 +/- 13% (n = 4) and 143 +/- 6% (n = 4) of control responses, respectively. The mean half-time for washout of the OLC and plant ouabain-induced augmentation of histamine-evoked tension exceeded 35 minutes. These data show that human OLC has cardiotonic and vasotonic actions qualitatively and quantitatively similar to those observed with plant ouabain.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Compared with normotensive, nondiabetic controls (Cai, 25.2 +/- 1.4 nM; Mgi, 232 +/- 8 microM), Cai was elevated in both normotensive (36.8 +/- 2.7 nM, sig = 0.005) and hypertensive (43.4 +/- 2.9 nM, sig = 0.001) NIDDM subjects, and Mgi was concomitantly suppressed (normotensive: 206 +/- 11 microM, sig = 0.05; hypertensive: 196 +/- 8 microM, sig = 0.001). Similar but less striking changes were noted in obese subjects. Values of pHi were significantly lower (sig = 0.05) in all hypertensive groups compared with their normotensive controls. Continuous relations were observed for all subjects between Cai and diastolic blood pressure (r = 0.649, p less than 0.001) and body mass index (r = 0.565, p less than 0.001), between Mgi and diastolic blood pressure (r = -0.563, p less than 0.001) and fasting blood glucose (r = -0.580, p less than 0.001), and in diabetics, between pHi and diastolic blood pressure (r = -0.680, p less than 0.001). Thus, the constellation of elevated Cai and suppressed Mgi and pHi levels is characteristic of the hypertensive state. These abnormalities of cellular ion handling in whole or in part common to hypertension, diabetes, and obesity may contribute to the pathophysiology of these syndromes and may help to explain their frequent clinical coexistence.\r"

  ".W": "Some fatty acids are potent inhibitors of angiotensin binding and aldosterone production in adrenal glomerulosa cells and thereby may be involved in regulating salt and water balance. To study the possible regulation of fatty acids by salt, we measured the levels of unesterified fatty acids in plasma from patients subjected to extremes of dietary salt intake and saline infusion. Insulin and catecholamines, two known regulators of plasma fatty acids, also were measured. Infusion of 2 l saline over 4 hours caused the levels of most unesterified fatty acids to rise. Total unesterified fatty acids rose 60-100%. A high salt diet caused a smaller rise in total unesterified fatty acids (approximately 33%). In both instances, oleic and palmitoleic acids showed the greatest proportionate increases, whereas stearic acid was relatively unaffected. When salt loads were administered by either intravenous or dietary routes, plasma insulin levels fell by approximately 50%. Plasma norepinephrine increased after saline infusion but not during a high salt diet. Postsaline levels of fatty acids correlated inversely with postsaline levels of aldosterone, supporting a possible role for fatty acids as physiological regulators of the adrenal glomerulosa. A rise in plasma fatty acids and fall in insulin in response to salt loads could act in concert to increase sodium excretion, constituting a physiological mechanism contributing to salt and water balance.\r"

  ".W": "To investigate the effects of a low calorie regimen on sympathetic function and its relation to blood pressure response, 22 untreated obese essential hypertensive patients (50 +/- 2 years, body mass index 29 +/- 1 kg/m2) were hospitalized and a diet was prescribed of 2,000 kcal/day for 5 days (control period) followed by 800 kcal/day for 21 days without changing salt intake (8-10 g/day). The dose of intravenous phenylephrine infusion needed to elevate systolic blood pressure 20 mm Hg (CD20) and the 24-hour urinary excretion of norepinephrine (UNE) were measured. During the low calorie period, blood pressure normalized in 14 patients (responder group, 124 +/- 3/79 +/- 4 mm Hg) and eight remained hypertensive (poor responder group, 158 +/- 6/103 +/- 3 mm Hg). At the control period, blood pressure and body mass index were similar, but the responder group had higher UNE (134 +/- 15 micrograms/day) and CD20 (127 +/- 11 micrograms) than the poor responder group (89 +/- 6 micrograms/day and 79 +/- 13 micrograms, respectively). During the low calorie period, both UNE (87 +/- 15 micrograms/day) and CD20 (74 +/- 10 micrograms) decreased in the responder group; no change was seen in the poor responder group. Changes in UNE and systolic blood pressure were correlated (r = 0.6, p less than 0.05). In conclusion, suppression of sympathetic activity plays a role in blood pressure reduction during moderate caloric restriction.\r"

Baseline study variables included anthropometrics, clinical chemistry measurements of blood and urine, socioeconomic and lifestyle variables, and detailed erythrocyte ion transport and concentration measurements.

Controlling for age and baseline blood pressure, the following age- and sex-adjusted variables were associated with an increased risk of future hypertension (relative risks for a 2 SD difference, all p less than 0.10): family history of hypertension (2.35); height (1.97); body mass index (2.31); abdominal girth (2.66); subscapular, suprailiac, and triceps skinfold thicknesses (2.79, 2.52, and 2.28, respectively); percent ideal body weight (2.63); log triglyceride concentration (2.02); plasma uric acid (2.16); inorganic phosphate (0.50); and passive erythrocyte sodium permeability (1.59). The final model,which included all of the age- and sex-adjusted variables (p less than 0.10) in a backward elimination logistic regression analysis, consisted of age (4.78), systolic blood pressure (2.91), subscapular skinfold thickness (2.21), height (1.92), uric acid (2.06), inorganic phosphate (0.50), and family history of hypertension (1.82).

To begin the localization of the gene or genes responsible for this phenotype, we examined the association of blood pressure, lithium-sodium countertransport, and two genetic markers previously associated with hypertension--the MN blood group antigen (chromosome 4) and the plasma protein haptoglobin (chromosome 18)--in a population-based sample of 592 young adults from Tecumseh, Mich., the site of an ongoing cardiovascular epidemiological investigation. Our results suggest that the relation between MN phenotype and systolic blood pressure is significantly different and oppositely directed in men and women. Analysis of data available from previous examinations revealed that similar blood pressure differences related to MN phenotype had been present at least a decade earlier in both men and women. There also was a significant relation between systolic blood pressure and haptoglobin phenotype for the combined group of men and women. In addition to having high systolic blood pressure, men with the MM phenotype had significantly elevated red blood cell lithium-sodium countertransport activity. In studies of brother-brother pairs, we found evidence for significant genetic linkage between the MN locus and red blood cell lithium-sodium countertransport activity.\r"

We compared renal and systemic hemodynamic responses to saline infusion between normotensive sons of two hypertensive parents (SOHT) and sons of two normotensive parents (SONT) selected from the general population of Rochester, Minn. Hemodynamic measurements were performed after a week of low sodium intake (10 meq/day) and were repeated after a week of high sodium intake (200 meq/day). Despite being in the normotensive range, blood pressures in SOHT were higher than those in SONT during low sodium (124 +/- 3/85 +/- 3 versus 118 +/- 2/71 +/- 2 mm Hg, p less than 0.01) and high sodium (122 +/- 3/80 +/- 3 versus 112 +/- 2/70 +/- 2 mm Hg, p less than 0.05) conditions. Higher pressures in SOHT were associated with elevated systemic and renal vascular resistance. After a high sodium diet, renal vascular resistance in SOHT rose further during acute saline infusion, whereas systemic vascular resistance did not change. After a low sodium diet, this renal vasoconstrictor response to saline infusion in SOHT was not present, and renal vascular resistance fell to levels not different from SONT. Plasma renin activity, aldosterone, and atrial natriuretic peptide did not differ between SONT and SOHT. Circulating levels of norepinephrine were higher in SOHT. These data demonstrate a renal vasoconstrictor response to saline infusion in normotensive SOHT, which depends on prior sodium intake. This alteration in renal hemodynamics may represent an inherited abnormality related to the development of hypertension.\r"

The objectives of this study were to 1) determine whether a high sodium diet depresses arterial baroreceptor reflex function in normotensive humans, and 2) determine whether alterations in baroreceptor reflex function are related to changes in arterial compliance. Seventeen normotensive men, aged 30 +/- 2 years, received 10 and 200 meq sodium per day diets, each for 5 days, in a randomized crossover trial. Carotid baroreceptor reflex function was assessed by measuring the blood pressure response to sequential neck suction (0, -10, -20, and -30 mm Hg) and neck pressure (0, +10, +20, and +30 mm Hg). Forearm vascular resistance was determined by venous occlusion plethysmography. Arterial compliance was evaluated by calculating the quotient of the diastolic blood pressure decay time constant and forearm vascular resistance. Blood pressure averaged 124 +/- 3/62 +/- 2 mm Hg on the low sodium diet and 122 +/- 3/60 +/- 2 mm Hg on the high sodium diet (p = NS). Baroreceptor reflex slopes representing the systolic and diastolic blood pressure responses to changes in neck chamber pressure were steeper in the subjects when randomly assigned to low sodium diet than to high sodium diet. Diastolic blood pressure decay time and forearm arterial compliance were similar during low and high sodium intake. We conclude that short-term exposure to a high sodium diet depresses carotid baroreceptor reflex function in normotensive humans. This observation cannot be attributed to changes in the arterial compliance.\r"

This may be due to the fact that hemodialysis patients often receive blood transfusions but it also suggests that hemodialysis per se may induce the production of irregular isoantibodies. The blood-group specificities of the irregular isoantibodies detected were anti-N, anti-Leb + anti-HI, anti-Lea + anti-Leb, anti-H and anti-I, anti-P1, anti-rh\" (E). The majority of the cases with irregular isoantibodies were examined because of clinical problems during hemodialysis.

The NG tube had to be reinserted in three patients with B-f-S because of obstruction by clots. The direct irrigation method of CGC thus appears to be more effective for the treatment of B-f-D than B-f-S, so we investigated a three lumen, single-balloon catheter (3L-SBC) with which the bleeding site in the stomach can be cooled and pressed without removing coagula.

We studied erythrocyte osmotic fragility (EOF), mechanical fragility (EMF) and deformability (ED) before and after r-HuEPO therapy in patients on conventional dialysis treatment with a cuprophan membrane and in subjects undergoing HDF with a polyacrylonitrile membrane. Non-uremic, non-anemic subjects were enrolled as controls. Red cell membrane defects were more evident in HD than in HDF; r-HuEPO seemed to improve deformability in both groups compared to controls (p less than 0.005) possibly through the great production of red cells during this therapy.\r"

Seventeen of 21 episodes were managed successfully by changing the catheter over a guidewire, thus preserving the access site. No relapse was observed after the antibiotic therapy was stopped. Only four patients required complete removal of the catheter and subsequent use of another site.\r"

  ".W": "The use of a bloodless solution and high pressure to accelerate microporous membrane oxygenator (MMO) failure was investigated. It was hypothesized that albumin acts as a wetting agent, contributing to plasma leakage through the membrane, and that high MMO outlet pressure accelerates the process. Three MMO, B-Bentley BCM-40 (n = 7), M-Medtronic Maxima (n = 4), and S-Sarns 16310 (n = 7) were tested at 37 +/- 2 degrees C using three identical closed recirculating circuits and four conditions: 1) Lactated Ringer solution (LR) with MMO outlet pressure (Pmo) 750 mmHg; 2) LR + albumin (4 g/100 ml), Pmo 150 mmHg; 3) LR + albumin, Pmo 300 mmHg; and 4) LR + albumin, Pmo 750 mmHg. \"Blood\" flow and gas flow were maintained at 2 l/min. Failure was indicated when Na+ was detected in the effluent of the MMO exhaust gas. There were no failures without albumin in the solution. B and M showed no signs of failure under any of the test conditions at 78 hours. S failed at (mean +/- SEM) 4.9 +/- 1.0, 12.1 +/- 0.2, and 19 hours for conditions 4, 3, and 2 respectively. Preceding failure, inlet gas pressure increased more than eightfold (27 +/- 1 to 224 +/- 34 mmH2O). These preliminary results are similar to previous findings with blood and suggest that high MMO outlet pressure and the presence of albumin may promote plasma breakthrough for S. The combination may provide a basis for an accelerated bloodless test for MMO compatibility with long-term respiratory support.\r"

Due to the waterhammer effect, cavitation may primarily occur in the mitral position leading to high mechanical loading of the valve itself and of corpuscular blood elements. Ten different types of commercial mechanical heart valves were investigated in the mitral position of a pulsatile mock loop, to detect cavitation thresholds under physiologically similar conditions by cinematographic techniques. Almost all these valve prostheses show cavitation up to a ventricular pressure gradient of 5000 mmHg/s. The threshold depends on valve type and size and is sometimes within the physiological range below 2000 mmHg/s. Visible cavitation bubbles with a diameter of up to 1.8 mm and a collapse time of less than 0.1 ms suggest that vapour cavitation may play an important role for material and blood damage in mechanical heart valve prostheses.\r"

  ".W": "A wearable device for the acquisition, processing and storage of the signal from needle-type glucose sensors has been designed and developed as part of a project aimed at developing a portable artificial pancreas. The device is essential to assess the operational characteristics of miniaturized sensors in vivo. It can be connected to sensors operating at a constant potential of 0.65 Volts, and generating currents in the order of 10(-9) Amp. It is screened and equipped with filters that permit data recording and processing even in the presence of electrical noise. It can operate with sensors with different characteristics (1-200 nA full scale). The device has been designed to be worn by patients, so its weight and size have been kept to a minimum (250 g; 8.5 x 14.5 x 3.5 cm). It is powered by rechargeable Ni/Cd batteries allowing continuous operation for 72 h. The electronics consists of an analog card with operational amplifiers, and a digital one with a microprocessor (Intel 80C196, MCS-96 class, with internal 16-bit CPU supporting programs written in either C or Assembler language), a 32 Kb EPROM, and an 8 Kb RAM where the data are stored. The microprocessor can run either at 5 or 10 Mhz and features on-chip peripherals: an analog/digital (A/D) converter, a serial port (used to transfer data to a Personal Computer at the end of the 72 h), input-output (I/O) units at high-speed, and two timers. The device is programmed and prepared to operate by means of a second hand-held unit equipped with an LCD display and a 16-key numeric pad.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The total pore volumes of granular carbons START, SCN and fibrous activated carbons ACFM were 0.9-2.2. cm3/g and 0.8-1.5 cm3/g, respectively. A parallel increase in volume and specific surface area of micropores lead to a 4-5-fold increase of bilirubin adsorption from a 3% HSA solution. About 3 mg of bilirubin per 1 ml of the working column volume is removed from the solution with a 18 mg/100 ml concentration, after 8 min contact with an adsorbent after 4 hours of perfusion. Removal of bilirubin from model solutions means the conformation of albumin molecules can be restored. Carbon adsorbents synthesized for the elimination of bilirubin from protein-containing solutions can also be called deliganding adsorbents, since under some experimental conditions they eliminate other protein-bound ligands, viz. phenols by 97-99%, bile acids by 90-92% and sodium caprylate by 89-95%.\r"

The effect of treatment can be predicted from the relative depletion of antibody and the actual severity of the disease. Another formula shows how the changed catabolism of antigen after antibody binding can influence the amount of immune complexes. As an example, lymph drainage in myasthenia gravis is calculated using averaged data from three patients.\r"

  ".W": "Keratan sulphate is an integral component of the large aggregating proteoglycans of mature human articular cartilage. The keratan sulphate content of chondrocytic proteoglycans increases during maturation, and it is a useful marker of mature-type chondrocytic proteoglycans. Ordinarily, in cell culture, chondrocytes from non-neoplastic tissues dedifferentiate, diminish or cease to synthesize aggregating proteoglycans with the same amount of keratan sulphate as those formed in vivo, and do not maintain their in vivo phenotype. In tissue culture, this down-regulation of synthesis of keratan sulphate is irreversible. The study of the metabolism of mature human chondrocytes has been hampered by the absence of stable models. We report a cell-line, 105KC, derived from a human chondrosarcoma, that has maintained a stable proteoglycan phenotype during more than three years of culture. Analysis with immunofluorescence suggested that 105KC cells continued to synthesize keratan sulphate in long-term culture. Biochemical analysis demonstrated that 105KC cells maintained the production of chondrocytic large-aggregating proteoglycans and that keratan sulphate composed 13 per cent of their glycosaminoglycan content. To our knowledge, 105KC represents the first model to have maintained the post-fetal chondrocytic proteoglycan phenotype in stable culture. This study documents the feasibility of the development of mature chondrocytic cell-lines and sheds light on the biological characteristics of chondrosarcomas.\r"

In situ fixation was performed in forty-five consecutively treated patients (fifty-six hips). Thirty-nine (87 per cent) of the patients returned for examination two years after treatment. The greatest percentage of motion of the hip returned within six months after treatment. Despite loss of internal rotation of the hip, the mean foot-progression angle was 10.8 degrees. Radiography and computerized tomographic scanning revealed minimum change in the relationship of the femoral head to the femoral shaft and no change in the neck-shaft angle. Motion returned despite minimum osseous remodeling. The early return of motion (in the first three months) may have been due to relief of pain, spasm, and synovitis, while soft-tissue stretching and resorption of bone in the anterolateral part of the femoral neck may have accounted for the remainder of the increase in internal rotation.\r"

The slips were classified, by the duration of symptoms, as acute, chronic, or acute on chronic. As determined by the head-shaft angle, 42 per cent of the slips were mild; 32 per cent, moderate; and 26 per cent, severe. Reduction was performed in thirty-nine hips, and realignment was done in sixty-five hips. Treatment of chronic slips included symptomatic only in 25 per cent of the hips, a spica cast in 30 per cent, pinning in 24 per cent, and osteotomy in 20 per cent. The Iowa hip-rating and the radiographic classification of degenerative joint disease were determined at follow-up; both worsened with increasing severity of the slip and when reduction or realignment had been done. Osteonecrosis (12 per cent) and chondrolysis (16 per cent) also were more common with increasing severity of the slip and when reduction or realignment had been performed; both led to a poor result. Deterioration over time was most marked with increasing severity of the slip. The natural history of the malunited slip is mild deterioration related to the severity of the slip and complications. Techniques of realignment are associated with a risk of appreciable complications and adversely affect the natural history of the disease. Regardless of the severity of the slip, pinning in situ provided the best long-term function and delay of degenerative arthritis, with a low risk of complications.\r"

The relative frequency of postoperative infection was significantly higher in patients who were seropositive and had associated clinical symptoms (four of seventeen) than in patients who were seronegative (eight of 171) (Fisher exact test, p = 0.01). In all patients who were seropositive and had a postoperative bacterial infection, treatment with antibiotics was effective. The results of this study suggest that people who are seropositive for human immunodeficiency virus and have associated symptoms are at increased risk for postoperative infection.\r"

Two of the nine patients died, and the treatment of the other seven was dependent on the additional fractures. A second group of six patients had a fracture in the area of the lateral mass, with one fracture just anterior to or within the anterior portion of the lateral mass of the first cervical vertebra and a second fracture posterior to the lateral mass of the first cervical vertebra on the same side; resultant asymmetrical displacement of the lateral masses was seen on the open-mouth roentgenogram that was made for each patient. A third group of eleven patients sustained a Jefferson, or burst, fracture of the first cervical vertebra. These patients had either four fractures (two in the anterior arch and two in the posterior arch) or three fractures (one in the anterior arch and two in the posterior arch). Spreading of the lateral masses was relatively symmetrical on the open-mouth roentgenogram. Patients who had fractures with displacement of two to seven millimeters were treated with immobilization in a halo vest. Patients who had fractures with severe spreading of the lateral masses (more than seven millimeters) were treated with reduction of the lateral masses by axial traction until healing of the arch had occurred.

Replicas of porous hydroxyapatite that had been obtained after hydrothermal conversion of the calcium carbonate exoskeleton of coral (genus Goniopora) were implanted intramuscularly in twenty-four adult male baboons (Papio ursinus). Serial sections from specimens that had been harvested at three, six, and nine months showed that initially the formation of fibrous connective tissue was characterized by a prominent vascular component and by condensations of collagen fibers assembled at the interface of the hydroxyapatite. The morphogenesis of bone was intimately associated with the differentiation of the connective-tissue condensations. Bone formed without an intervening endochondral phase. Although the amount of bone varied considerably, in several specimens extensive bone developed, filling large portions of the porous spaces and culminating in total penetration by bone within the implants. The mean volume fraction composition of the specimens was 20.8 +/- 1.0 per cent (mean and standard error) for bone, 17.3 +/- 1.7 per cent for connective-tissue condensation, 31.9 +/- 1.0 per cent for fibrovascular tissue, 6.4 +/- 0.6 per cent for bone marrow, and 34.6 +/- 0.5 per cent for the hydroxyapatite framework. The amount of bone and marrow increased at each time-period, and the hydroxyapatite framework was significantly reduced between six and nine months. This indicated a moderate biodegradation over time, which was possibly a result of incomplete conversion of carbonate to hydroxyapatite. Linear regression analysis showed a negative correlation between the hydroxyapatite framework and the magnitude of bone formation within the porosities of the hydroxyapatite (p = 0.0001). Biochemical coating of the hydroxyapatite substratum with an allogeneic fibrin-fibronectin protein concentrate prepared from baboon plasma did not significantly increase the amount of bone formation within the porous spaces. The hydroxyapatite substratum may have functioned as a solid-phase domain for anchorage of bone morphogenetic proteins.\r"

The accuracy of magnetic resonance imaging was found to depend on both the operator and the technique and was decreased in extremely obese patients, due to difficulties in positioning, and in patients who had had a previous operation. Magnetic resonance imaging was more accurate than either computerized tomographic arthrography or ultrasonography in identifying partial-thickness tears (intrasubstance changes in the rotator cuff). Magnetic resonance imaging provided the same level of accuracy as computerized tomographic arthrography in the detection of abnormalities of the glenoid labrum.\r"

  ".W": "Twenty-nine patients (thirty sites) who had histologically confirmed aggressive fibromatosis were treated with radical courses of radiation at the University of Florida between March 1975 and February 1986. The minimum length of follow-up was two years; 76 per cent of the patients were followed for more than five years. Twenty-seven sites received doses of at least 5000 centigrays (one centigray equals one rad). Twelve patients were treated twice a day. Fourteen sites were treated with radiation postoperatively for known or presumed microscopic quantities of residual aggressive fibromatosis; in eleven, the disease was locally controlled. Sixteen sites were treated postoperatively for known grossly apparent residual disease; in fourteen, the disease was locally controlled. Over-all, aggressive fibromatosis was controlled in twenty-five (83 per cent) of the thirty sites. The six-year actuarial rate of local control was 79 per cent. The five local recurrences occurred at four, eleven, thirty-four, sixty-one, and sixty-eight months after the initiation of radiation therapy. Two of the five failures occurred in the high-dose radiation field in patients who were treated for grossly apparent disease. The remaining three failures occurred at the margin of the irradiated field in patients who were treated for assumed microscopic quantities of residual disease. There was no apparent difference in local control between patients who were treated for primary (previously untreated) aggressive fibromatosis and those who were treated after one or more recurrences. Comparison of the results of radiation therapy with published data on operative treatment shows that local control substantially improves with postoperative radiation therapy when operative margins are less than wide.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "We created unstable intertrochanteric fractures with a large posteromedial defect in eighteen pairs of fresh-frozen femora from cadavera, and used the femora to evaluate the stability of six combinations of treatment with sliding compression screws and sideplates. The variables that were tested were high (150-degree) angle plates compared with low (130-degree) angle plates, the position of the lag-screw in the femoral head and neck (in the center of the head as seen on both anteroposterior and lateral roentgenograms compared with posteroinferiorly), and whether or not medial cortical contact had been re-established with a limited osteotomy of the greater trochanter. The femora were loaded to the point of failure. The mode of failure, maximum load to failure, and bending rigidity of each method of fixation were measured. Of the six types of treatment, the use of a 150-degree-angle plate, position of the lag-screw in the center of the head as seen on both anteroposterior and lateral roentgenograms, and osteotomy of the greater trochanter resulted in the highest mean load to failure and the greatest rigidity. Over-all, re-establishment of medial cortical contact by means of an osteotomy of the greater trochanter significantly improved the mean load to failure and the rigidity of the fixation. The higher-angle plate, although more difficult to insert, increased the mean load to failure but had no effect on rigidity. The position of the lag-screw (in the center of the head as seen on both anteroposterior and lateral roentgenograms or posteroinferiorly) had no bearing on the mean load to failure, but it significantly affected the mode of failure.\r"

Preoperatively, all patients had had a dynamic varus deformity of the hindfoot and adduction of the forefoot in both the stance phase and the swing phase of gait. At an average follow-up of 6.2 years (range, 2.3 to 8.8 years), there were fourteen excellent, four good, and four poor clinical results. Two patients who had a fixed varus deformity of the hindfoot and one patient who had a very weak anterior tibial muscle had a poor result. We concluded that the combined procedure is effective for correction of a flexible varus deformity of the foot in patients who have spastic cerebral palsy.\r"

The cultures of material that was obtained by superficial swabbing of the wound and needle biopsy were inadequate for prediction of the presence of aerobic organisms. Moreover, the failure to isolate anaerobes from the material obtained by needle biopsy did not rule out the presence of anaerobic organisms. Therefore, tissue for culture of aerobic and anaerobic organisms must be obtained during operative debridement in order to identify all pathogenic organisms. Fungi were isolated from the material obtained by biopsy in two patients. In addition, histological examination of the tissue obtained at biopsy led to the diagnosis of epidermoid carcinoma in two patients in whom this diagnosis had not been suspected before biopsy. Cultures were negative for mycobacteria in all patients. An additional ten patients who had a tibial non-union and latent osteomyelitis were studied. In nine of them, cultures of material obtained by needle biopsy showed no growth. Six of these nine patients had an exacerbation of the osteomyelitis after intramedullary nailing for the non-union. Therefore, the absence of growth of organisms from tissue obtained at needle biopsy does not rule out the possibility that osteomyelitis may be reactivated after intramedullary nailing with reaming.\r"

The non-union was treated with operative implantation of a carrier (guanidine-extracted, demineralized bovine bone or a polylactic acid polymer), alone or in combination with fractions that had been enriched in bone morphogenetic protein. All sites of treatment were examined radiographically and histomorphometrically at twelve weeks after implantation. Guanidine-extracted, demineralized bovine bone, alone or combined with fifteen milligrams of canine bone morphogenetic protein, failed to induce any healing of the non-union. When polylactic acid alone had been implanted, a small amount of reparative new bone was found in the defect at three months. When polylactic acid combined with fifteen milligrams of canine bone morphogenetic protein had been implanted, a significant increase in new bone formation was seen (p less than 0.03), compared with that seen in control animals. Trabecular bone bridged the gap between the proximal and distal fragments in all four specimens from the dogs that had received that treatment. In contrast, when polylactic acid combined with bovine bone morphogenetic protein had been implanted, significant reparative new bone was not found in the defect at three months.\r"

There were twenty-one men and thirty-five women, and the median age was sixty-five years (range, thirty to seventy-nine years). Before and after total hip arthroplasty, a functional assessment was done with the Charnley-Merle d'Aubigne scoring system. The patients assessed quality of life using the Nottingham Health Profile. In the comparison of quality of life before and after the arthroplasty, significant improvement was observed regarding pain (p less than 0.0001), energy (p less than 0.0001), sleep (p less than 0.0001), and social isolation (p = 0.001). Similarly, there was a significant reduction in the frequency of health-related problems pertaining to housework (p less than 0.0001), holidays (p less than 0.0001), hobbies (p = 0.0001), social life (p less than 0.0001), sexual function (p = 0.001), and family life (p = 0.0005), and among patients who were sixty-five years old or less and who worked at paid employment (p = 0.04). Quality of life after total hip arthroplasty was in close agreement with that of a healthy reference group of similar age and sex distribution. It was concluded that quality of life after total hip arthroplasty is improved considerably. The Nottingham Health Profile is a valuable tool in the evaluation of the result of, as well as the indicators for, total hip arthroplasty.\r"

The use of the analog in the treatment of acromegaly and TSH-secreting tumors is beyond the scope of this clinical review. Patient acceptance of the analog, given chronically by the sc route, has been excellent and side effects have been few with the exception of the development of gallstones. In endocrine pancreatic and carcinoid tumors the hypersecretion of hormones such as VIP, glucagon, and gastrin and the secretory products of carcinoid tumors (e.g. 5-hydroxytryptamine and tachykinins) and their clinical effects may be successfully blocked. This allows excellent palliation of such tumors and often enables the patients to return home and lead normal social lives. Initial hopes that long-term octreotide therapy would be an effective antitumor drug, reducing tumor growth, based on experimental animal models and human tumor cell lines, have not been born out in clinical practice. A reduction in gut tumor bulk due to octreotide, rarely or never occurs as a sustained phenomenon. Eventually a decrease in, and finally an absence of, clinical effectiveness occurs despite the reintroduction of other treatment modalities.\r"

  ".U": "91258482\r", 
  ".W": "We had previously reported that serum sex hormone binding-globulin (SHBG) decreases and serum non-SHBG-bound testosterone (T) and free T increase significantly from infancy to late prepuberty in normal prepubertal children of both sexes. We had also shown an age-related delay in these changes in hypopituitary boys, which was reversed by GH treatment. Stunted growth and delayed puberty are conspicuous features of chronic renal failure (CRF). As another model of delay of growth and development, serum SHBG and serum T fractions were determined in 13 boys with CRF on chronic dialysis. In CRF, mean serum SHBG was significantly higher (99.1 +/- 68.9 nmol/L; P less than 0.05) than in 31 control (C) children of similar ages (66.2 +/- 34.9 nmol/L), while serum non-SHBG-bound T and free T were significantly lower (0.16 +/- 0.12 in CRF vs. 0.24 +/- 0.12 in C and 0.010 +/- 0.005 in CRF vs. 0.016 +/- 0.01 in C, respectively). On the other hand, serum total T (1.31 +/- 0.88 in CRF vs. 1.08 +/- 0.56 in C) and serum insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I; 1.06 +/- 0.74 in CRF vs. 1.35 +/- 1.70 in C) were not significantly different. A significant negative correlation between serum SHBG and chronological age as well as a significant positive correlation between serum non-SHBG-bound T and chronological age were found. For a given age, serum SHBG was higher, while serum non-SHBG-bound T was lower in patients with CRF (by analysis of covariance, P less than 0.01). It is postulated that, as has been proposed for hypopituitary boys, this delayed increment in serum T fractions could be responsible for the delay in the onset of puberty reported in CRF. It is known that GH decreases serum SHBG, acting on hepatic cells either directly or through the action of IGF-I. Since it has been suggested that patients with CRF have peripheral resistance to GH or IGF-I, the high levels of SHBG that we have detected in prepubertal boys with CRF could be taken as an additional evidence of this biological resistance.\r"

We first examined the general profile of the changes of the H-P-A axis from the day before surgery to the seventh day after surgery. On the day of surgery, plasma levels of CRH, ACTH, and cortisol were all significantly elevated after skin incision (phase I). During the next 2 days, plasma cortisol levels remained significantly elevated, and the both plasma CRH and ACTH levels were suppressed below the control levels obtained on the day before surgery (phase II). Several additional studies, carried out to analyze the mechanism that maintains the high plasma cortisol levels, revealed the following features of the H-P-A axis during phase II. Plasma free cortisol levels in this phase were higher than those during the preoperative period. The exogenously administered hydrocortisone clearance rate in phase II did not differ from that observed on the day before surgery. Dexamethasone administration resulted in a decrease in plasma cortisol levels similar to that observed preoperatively. Conversely, the ACTH-stimulated cortisol increase was significantly greater in phase II than that observed preoperatively. These results suggest that during and after major surgical stress, the H-P-A axis undergoes a biphasic change in the pattern of the stress response and during the second phase, not the continuous hypothalamo-pituitary drive but the increased adrenal responsiveness to ACTH is responsible at least in part for maintaining the elevated plasma cortisol level.\r"

We studied various serum and urine variables (including serum PTH, calcium, D-vitamins, and osteocalcin concentrations), bone mineral content, and bone histomorphometrics in men who at present abused alcohol and compared the results to those from men who previously had abused alcohol but who had abstained from alcohol for at least 2 yr and from normal men. No significant differences were found in bone mineral content at the two measuring sites (distal forearm, lumbar spine) between drinkers, abstainers, and controls though a considerable proportion of both current drinkers and abstainers had subnormal values. Bone formation rate and turnover (expressed by the activation frequency) was significantly reduced in the current drinkers who also had lower serum PTH, 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol, and osteocalcin concentrations. Men who had abstained from alcohol consumption for at least 2 yr had results similar to those from normal men, suggesting that the disturbances in bone metabolism in men abusing alcohol are reversible. The decrease in bone turnover in the drinkers may be explained by the observed reduction in plasma PTH concentration or a direct toxic effect of ethanol on bone tissue leading to a deficient recruitment of osteogenic cells.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of betamethasone on thyroid autoantibody responses and outcome of radioiodine therapy were determined over a period of 1 yr in a prospective randomized study of 40 patients with Graves' disease. Twenty patients were given placebo tablets, and 20 patients were treated with beta-methasone from 3 weeks before until 4 weeks after 131I therapy. At the time of inclusion in the study, the mean serum concentrations of TSH receptor antibodies, thyroid peroxidase antibodies, and thyroglobulin antibodies (TgAb) were increased in both groups. Three weeks of treatment with betamethasone reduced the thyroid peroxidase antibody and TgAb titers as well as the serum concentrations of thyroid hormones. A decrease in the TSH receptor antibody level was not statistically significant. After radioiodine therapy, transient increases in thyroid autoantibody levels were observed. The titers of the different antibodies generally changed in parallel. In some patients a detectable level of a given antibody was found only after the radioiodine treatment, and in two cases, TgAb did not appear at all, although the two other antibodies increased temporarily. Betamethasone delayed, but did not abolish, the 131I-induced antibody peaks. Betamethasone also caused a reduction in the total serum immunoglobulin G, a reduction which persisted throughout the study period. When the study ended, 17 patients given placebo and 9 patients given betamethasone (P less than 0.001) were receiving replacement therapy due to the development of hypothyroidism. These patients at this point in time had lower antibody levels than those not requiring T4. The results of this study demonstrate that betamethasone reduces and modifies the thyroid autoantibody responses as well as the outcome of radioiodine therapy in patients with Graves' disease. From a clinical point of view, these effects may be in opposite directions.\r"

  ".W": "Orthostatic tachycardia is a poorly understood syndrome in which patients develop dizziness, diaphoresis, or palpitations upon shifting from the supine to the upright posture. The present study was performed to determine whether autonomic neuropathy might be present in these patients, and whether the abnormal hemodynamic response to standing might be the result of failure of reflex vasoconstriction. We measured autonomic function in 9 patients with idiopathic orthostatic tachycardia and 2 patients with orthostatic tachycardia and insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and compared them to 33 age-matched controls. Although most patients with orthostatic tachycardia had normal vasomotor reflexes and normal surface potential amplitudes, the latency of the autonomic response, a measure of sympathetic nerve conduction velocity, was prolonged in the soles (2.44 +/- 0.08 s in patients with idiopathic orthostatic tachycardia vs. 2.12 +/- 0.04 s in controls; P less than 0.005). In 6 of 9 patients, however, the latencies were within the normal range. Autonomic surface potentials were absent in 1 diabetic patient with orthostatic tachycardia; the latency of the response in the feet was greatly prolonged (2.95 s) in the second patient. We also assessed the response of orthostatic tachycardia patients to octreotide and dihydroergotamine, which are known to have a pressor effect in patients with recognized forms of autonomic neuropathy. These agents, in combination, suppressed orthostatic tachycardia (from 116 +/- 7 to 89 +/- 6 beats/min; P less than 0.001) in patients with this syndrome. In summary, our data indicate that evidence of autonomic dysfunction is present in only a minority of patients with orthostatic tachycardia. Nevertheless, administration of the vasoconstrictor drugs dihydroergotamine and octreotide can prevent the abnormal hemodynamic response to the upright posture shown by patients with this syndrome.\r"

  ".W": "It has been reported that testosterone, 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone and 20 alpha-dihydroprogesterone, substrates for pyridine nucleotide-dependent hydroxysteroid oxidoreductases, stimulate the conversion of estrone to 17 beta-estradiol (E2) by placental villi in vitro. Their enzyme-catalyzed oxidation generates either NADH or NADPH. If the concentration of either reduced nucleotide were rate determining in the conversion of estrone to E2, then increases in NADH or NADPH levels as the result of steroid oxidation could stimulate E2 formation. In this investigation, enzymatic assays were used to quantitate NAD, NADP, NADH, and NADPH in villous tissue from term placenta under conditions where E2 formation was stimulated by 5 alpha-dihydroxytestosterone. On the basis of concurrent observations that NAD levels varied initially and decreased in tissue samples in culture over a 24-h period, the ability of villi to incorporate [14C]nicotinic acid or [14C]nicotinamide into NAD was also examined. No changes were detected in the ratios of oxidized to reduced [14C]nicotinamide nucleotides under stimulatory conditions. NAD was formed only from nicotinic acid. The data suggest that NAD and NADP reduction, if it is the basis for stimulation, is tightly coupled to reoxidation. It would also appear that media used widely for villous tissue and cell culture may not be optimal for pyridine nucleotide synthesis.\r"

  ".W": "Hyperthyroidism is associated with a marked effect on the cardiovascular system. Despite enhanced resting ventricular systolic performance, thyrotoxicosis has been implicated as a primary cause of cardiomegaly, congestive heart failure, and decreased exercise tolerance. To further assess potential alterations in ventricular function we have noninvasively studied diastolic performance in nine newly diagnosed and untreated hyperthyroid patients. Parameters including diastolic flow velocities, isovolumic relaxation time (IVRT), and the rate of diastolic flow deceleration were compared to those of an age- and sex-matched control population, and then repeat determinations were made after beta-adrenergic blockade and again when the patients were chemically and clinically euthyroid. Before treatment the IVRT was 33.0 ms, which was significantly (P less than 0.005) shorter than the control value (57.9 ms) and in combination with other measures of diastolic function indicated enhanced left ventricular relaxation. beta-Adrenergic blockade slowed the resting heart rate from 97 to 80 beats/min (P less than 0.005) and partially normalized the rate of diastolic deceleration, but had no effect on the IVRT (33.8 ms). When patients were euthyroid, the IVRT was 51.7 ms, and other measures of diastolic performance were the same as those in controls. The current data assessing resting diastolic function in hyperthyroidism are similar to those previously reported for systolic function. Our findings of enhanced cardiac diastolic performance do not support the hypothesis that thyrotoxicosis is associated with compromised left ventricular function and suggest the possibility that the cardiac symptoms that accompany hyperthyroidism may be due to noncardiac mechanisms.\r"

Cells with immunoreactivity for PST were observed in monolayer cultures of QGP-1N cells. Carbachol stimulated PST secretion and the intracellular Ca2+ mobilization concentration dependently in the range of 10(-6)-10(-4) M. The PST secretion and Ca2+ mobilization induced by carbachol were inhibited by atropine. The calcium ionophore (A23187) stimulated PST secretion. However, cholecystokinin and gastrin-releasing peptide did not stimulate either PST secretion or Ca2+ mobilization. Secretin also did not stimulate PST secretion. The glucose concentration in the culture medium had no effect on PST secretion. These results suggest that PST secretion is mainly regulated by acetylcholine through a muscarinic receptor, and that an increase in intracellular Ca2+ plays an important role in stimulus-secretion coupling in QGP-1N cells.\r"

In this study, 12 Pimas and 12 caucasians, all nondiabetic, were admitted to a metabolic ward and, in random order, fed 2 14-day weight-maintaining diets: a traditional Pima diet (percentage of calories: carbohydrate, 70% fat, 15%; protein, 15%) and a high fat modern diet (carbohydrate, 30%; fat, 50%; protein, 20%). Carbohydrate metabolism was characterized using the modified iv glucose tolerance test (minimal model), the acute insulin responses to arginine during a 3-step glycemic clamp, and the oral glucose tolerance test. Compared with the traditional diet, the modern diet was associated with a decrease in oral glucose tolerance (P less than 0.01) and higher plasma cholesterol concentrations (P less than 0.02). The decline in glucose tolerance was associated with similar insulin-mediated, but 23% lower glucose-mediated (P less than 0.001), glucose disposal, a 17% lower acute insulin response to glucose (P less than 0.03), a 9% lower beta-cell sensitivity to glucose (P less than 0.02), and similar beta-cell capacities. Pimas and caucasians responded similarly, except for larger changes in plasma lipids among the Pimas. Since glucose-mediated glucose disposal, beta-cell function, and glucose tolerance deteriorated on the modern diet, it is likely that diet composition affects the prevalence of noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus in both Pimas and caucasians.\r"

  ".W": "To determine whether serum 3 alpha-androstanediol glucuronide (3AG) reflects the overall effect of integrated adrenal androgen secretion in the virilizing form of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CVAH), circadian levels (0800, 1200, 1600, and 2000 h) of serum 3AG and 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17OHP) or 11-deoxycortisol (S), androstenedione (A), testosterone (T), and 24-h urinary 17-ketosteroids (17KS) were examined in seven patients (pts) with classical 21-hydroxylase deficiency (21OHD) and one pt with classical 11 beta-hydroxylase deficiency (11 beta OHD). Hormonal studies were conducted during the second day of dexamethasone (Dex) administration (2 mg/day). In five poorly controlled CVAH pts, including the 11 beta OHD pt, highly elevated baseline morning (AM) serum 17OHP or S as well as A levels, and elevated AM T levels in three pts decreased markedly in the evening (PM), while elevated serum 3AG showed no significant circadian changes; 17KS levels were markedly elevated for age. During Dex, moderately or slightly elevated AM 17OHP, A, or T in two to four pts with 21OHD decreased to the normal range in the PM. In the pt with 11 beta OHD, S, A, and T levels were suppressed. 3AG levels were modestly elevated or normal, without circadian changes, in these pts; 17KS levels were elevated or normal. In two other 21OHD pts, modestly elevated AM baseline 17OHP and A levels decreased in the PM; elevated AM T decreased in one pt in the PM; modestly elevated 3AG levels showed no circadian changes; 17KS levels were modestly elevated. During Dex, normal or slightly elevated serum steroids and 17KS levels were associated with normal or high normal 3AG levels without circadian changes. In one postpubertal female with 21OHD, modestly elevated AM baseline 17OHP levels decreased at 2000 h; normal A and T levels throughout the day and low normal 17KS were associated with slightly low 3AG levels, without circadian variation. During Dex treatment, normal 17OHP, A, T, and low 17KS levels were associated with low 3AG levels without circadian variation. In all pts as a group, an excellent correlation (r = 0.9) was found between either 0800 h or mean, or 2000 h serum 3AG levels and 17KS. In addition, AM and PM serum 3AG levels in five normal women were similar. We conclude that the high correlation between serum 3AG and urinary 17KS and the absence of a significant circadian variation in 3AG indicate that serum 3AG, regardless of sample time, is a useful metabolic index of integrated adrenal androgen secretion in CVAH.\r"

  ".W": "To investigate the physiological relationship between serum GH-binding proteins and 24-h GH release, we compared the 24-h GH pulse attributes in serum samples obtained at 20-min intervals to the serum GH-binding protein activity (GH-BP) from 38 normal boys between 7 5/12 and 18 4/12 yr of age. GH-BP was determined in a serum sample from each study (containing less than 1.0 micrograms/L GH) using a standardized GH-BP assay. GH-BP results are expressed as the percentage of [125I]human GH bound to the high affinity GH-BP complex (peak II) per 160 microL serum. There were significant inverse relationships between the high affinity (receptor-related) GH-BP and several characteristics of 24-h GH release. Specifically, GH-BP was significantly (P less than 0.005 for all), but negatively, correlated with mean 24-h GH concentration (r = -0.62), sum of the GH pulse amplitudes (r = -0.57), sum of the GH pulse areas (r = -0.55), interpulse mean GH concentration (r = -0.53), and number of GH pulses per 24 h (r = -0.53). In addition, GH-BP correlated positively with the mean time interval between pulses (r = 0.59). There was also a significant positive correlation (r = 0.75; P less than 0.001) between GH-BP and the subject's age-adjusted body mass index SD score (BMI-SDS). Each characteristic of 24-h GH release correlating inversely with GH-BP also correlated inversely with BMI-SDS (P less than 0.01 for all comparisons). GH-BP did not, however, correlate with plasma insulin-like growth factor-I levels, serum testosterone concentrations, or height SDS. Binding to the low affinity GH-BP (peak I) did not correlate significantly with any of the examined GH pulse attributes, BMI-SDS, or the degree of binding to the high affinity GH-BP (peak II). We conclude that an inverse relationship exists between the high affinity serum GH-BP and 24-h GH release in boys under normal physiological conditions. We speculate that abnormalities in this relationship probably also exist and may underlie some disorders of growth.\r"

High levels of expression of mdr-1/Pgp are found in both the normal adrenal and adrenocortical cancers. By RNA in situ hybridization the expression in adrenocortical cancer is shown to be widely distributed. The present study demonstrates that decreased drug accumulation mediated by mdr-1/Pgp can be overcome by clinically achievable concentrations of mitotane (o,p'-DDD). The increase in drug accumulation with the addition of mitotane is due at least in part to a decrease in drug efflux and results in an increase in cytotoxicity when agents of the natural product class are used. This effect is observed in cells with a broad range of mdr-1/Pgp expression, including levels comparable to those found in most adrenocortical cancers. Similar increases in drug accumulation can be demonstrated in an unselected adrenocortical cancer cell line that expresses mdr-1/Pgp. The finding that multidrug resistance mediated by mdr-1/Pgp can be reversed by mitotane provides a rational basis for exploring the use of mitotane in combination with natural product chemotherapeutic agents in adrenocortical cancer.\r"

Infants delivered vaginally after uncomplicated labors had higher umbilical cord plasma concentrations of AVP, ACTH, and cortisol than infants delivered without labor. Use of ephedrine, an alpha-agonist, during regional anesthesia was associated with elevated plasma AVP and ACTH concentrations compared to those in women receiving general anesthesia. At the time of delivery, 12 infants had acidemia (pH less than 7.20), as judged by pH of umbilical arterial blood. Their plasma AVP, ACTH, and cortisol levels did not differ from those of infants delivered by uncomplicated vaginal delivery, but were greater than those of infants delivered by cesarean section under general anesthesia. Moreover, in infants with acidemia, plasma concentrations of AVP and ACTH were significantly correlated, but PRL levels were unaffected by mode of delivery or acidemia. Elevated umbilical cord plasma concentrations of AVP, ACTH, and cortisol characterize term vaginal deliveries and are associated with intrauterine stress, demonstrating activation of the fetal hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and suggesting that AVP is important in ACTH release in the human fetus; however, PRL does not appear to be an important stress hormone.\r"

We investigated the endocrine effects of long-term therapy of 10 patients with meningiomas with 200 mg mifepristone daily for 1 yr. Most patients initially complained of nausea, vomiting, and/or tiredness. In four patients prednisone (7.5 mg/day) had to be given simultaneously in order to overcome these side-effects. In retrospect those patients who presented with the most severe side-effects showed the most rapidly occurring activation of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal-axis, as measured by an increase of circulating cortisol levels as well as of urinary cortisol excretion. Therapy with RU 486 activated the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis, resulting in a resetting of this system at a higher level at which the diurnal rhythm and the responsiveness to CRH stimulation were maintained, whereas the sensitivity to dexamethasone had diminished. Secondarily the production of androstenedione and estradiol increased considerably. These endocrine changes were caused by the induction of partial cortisol receptor resistance during therapy with RU 486. The compensatory overproduction of androgens and consequently of estrogens during long-term RU 486 therapy might limit its use as a single treatment in the treatment of estrogen-dependent cancer.\r"

Dexamethasone increased enzyme activity in all cases in a concentration-dependent manner (over a range of 1-1000 nmol/L). In fibroblasts from a patient with familial cortisol resistance, the response curve of dexamethasone-induced aromatase activity was shifted to the right compared to that of normal cells. However, the maximal induction of the enzyme at 1 mumol/L dexamethasone was unchanged in cortisol-resistant fibroblasts. On the other hand, in fibroblasts from the patient with the cortisol hyperreactive syndrome, the half-maximal effect of dexamethasone was similar to that in normal cells, but maximum induction of aromatase activity was 2 times greater than that in normal cells. The glucocorticoid antagonist RU 486 inhibited dexamethasone-induced aromatase activity in these patients' cells and in normal cells in a concentration-dependent manner, indicating that the altered effects of dexamethasone on aromatase induction observed in each cell type were mediated through glucocorticoid receptors.\r"

Under GH treatment the hormone binding to the high affinity BP (peak II-BP) increased in every patient to reach the mean value of 18.5 +/- 1.4%. In one patient, Scatchard plot analysis indicated that this increase was related to a higher binding capacity without any significant change in the binding affinity. A positive correlation existed between the GH-binding activity and insulin-like growth factor-I plasma levels. In nine boys with pubertal delay, the GH-specific binding to peak II-BP was normal (30.6 +/- 3.7% of radioactivity); it decreased significantly after testosterone treatment. In four boys with precocious puberty, the specific GH binding to peak II-BP was low (16.6 +/- 1.1%). It increased significantly to 21.6 +/- 1.1% of radioactivity after treatment with a LHRH analog. A negative correlation existed between plasma testosterone levels and GH binding to peak II-BP in boys presenting pubertal delay or precocious puberty. The high affinity GH-BP is regulated, and among the factors that play a role in this regulation, GH and testosterone have opposite effects.\r"

To test this hypothesis, we have used cultured dermal fibroblasts from abdominal skin biopsies of six patients with FBH and six age- and sex-matched controls as surrogate PTH-responsive tissues. Cells in 24-well plastic plates were exposed to vehicle, human PTH-(1-34) (10(-10)-10(-7) M), prostaglandin E2 (10(-6) M), or isoproterenol (10(-4) M) for 10 min in the presence of isobutylmethylxanthine, and cellular cAMP was determined by RIA. All cells responded to PTH with dose-dependent increases in cAMP, and all responded strongly to prostaglandin E2 and isoproterenol. There were no consistent or significant differences between control and FBH fibroblasts in maximal responses to the three agonists, and half-maximal stimulation was achieved with about 10(-9) M PTH in both normal and FBH cells. These data are not consistent with increased tissue sensitivity to PTH in FBH.\r"

These results further support a role of selenium in thyroid hormone metabolism. In an iodine deficient area, this selenium deficiency could lead to opposite clinical consequences: protect the general population and the fetus against iodine deficiency and brain damage; and in turn, favour the degenerative process of the thyroid gland leading to myxoedematous cretinism.\r"

  ".U": "91258502\r", 
  ".W": "GH-binding proteins (GH-BP) have recently been discovered in human plasma, but their biological function is unknown. The high affinity GH-BP is related to the GH receptor and may modulate the interaction of GH with tissue receptors, whereas the low affinity GH-BP should be inert in this regard. Modulation of receptor binding probably results in modulation of GH bioactivity. To address these issues, we examined the effects of purified GH-BPs as well as whole plasma on GH binding to receptors in human, rabbit, and female rat liver and in rat adipocytes. High affinity BP inhibited binding of GH to receptors in a dose-dependent fashion. Substantial inhibition was observed within the physiological range of BP concentrations; human liver and rat adipocytes were the most sensitive in this regard. In contrast, the low affinity BP had no effect on receptor binding of GH. Whole human plasma also inhibited GH binding to receptors. This effect could be attributed to its content of GH-BP, since removal or primary absence of the BP from plasma abolished its inhibitory effect. Purified high affinity BP also inhibited GH-dependent insulin-like growth factor-I production by cultured human fibroblasts to a degree comparable to receptor inhibition. We conclude that the circulating high affinity GH-BP, by sequestering GH, substantially interferes with binding of GH to its receptor, and that the well known inhibitory effect of plasma in RRAs for GH is largely due to this BP. GH action in human fibroblasts in vitro is similarly inhibited by this BP.\r"

In the postabsorptive state hyperthyroid patients had normal concentrations of insulin and glucagon, but increased concentrations (P less than 0.01) and turnover rates (P less than 0.01) of glycerol, NEFA, and KB. The ratio of NEFA appearance rate to glycerol appearance rate was decreased in hyperthyroid subjects (2.34 +/- 0.23 vs. 3.15 +/- 0.22; P less than 0.05), indicating that intracellular cycling between triglycerides and fatty acids was increased. The percentage of NEFA flux used for KB production, calculated from NEFA disappearance rates and KB appearance rates, was increased in hyperthyroid patients (21.20 +/- 2.75% vs. 13.37 +/- 0.63%; P less than 0.05), suggesting a diversion during hyperthyroidism of hepatic fatty acid metabolism toward ketogenesis. However, when the plasma NEFA levels of control subjects were raised by the infusion of a triglyceride emulsion to levels comparable to those observed in hyperthyroid patients their percentage of NEFA flux used for ketogenesis rose to values slightly higher (26.30%) than those of hyperthyroid subjects. In conclusion, 1) hyperthyroidism results not only in increased lipolysis, but also in enhanced triglyceride-fatty acid cycling, which could contribute to the excessive energy expenditure; and 2) the increased KB production of hyperthyroid patients results more from an increase in NEFA availability than from a direct stimulation of hepatic ketogenesis.\r"

Intermittent ACTH secretion from pituitary adenomas may result in insignificant differences between petrosal and peripheral ACTH levels at the time of sampling. Thus, pituitary stimulation during IPSS may improve the procedure. The aim of the study was to evaluate the usefulness of CRH injection in combination with IPSS. Twenty-two patients with Cushing's disease (CD; 5 macroadenomas, 16 microadenomas, and 1 corticotroph hyperplasia) and 5 patients with ectopic ACTH syndrome were studied. Bilateral IPSS was successfully carried out on 25 patients. Patients with ectopic ACTH syndrome had, before and after CRH injection, central to peripheral ACTH gradients below 1.7. Four patients with CD had basal gradients below 1.4. After CRH administration all patients with CD had gradients above 3.2. Despite correct location of central catheters, the predicted location of pituitary microadenomas was erroneous in 41% of the cases. It was not improved after CRH injection. In conclusion, the combination of CRH injection with IPSS was useful for the differential diagnosis of ACTH-dependent Cushing's syndrome, as it increased the discrimination of the procedure. On the contrary, it was useless for the preoperative location of pituitary microadenomas, which was poorly predicted by IPSS.\r"

Each subject presented a normal response after iv administration of 50 micrograms GHRH and placebo. In men each dose of pyridostigmine induced a significant increase in the GH response to GHRH, as assessed by both the maximal GH peak and the area under GH curve. In women, on the contrary, the GH response to GHRH was not potentiated by pretreatment with pyridostigmine at any given dose. Only five female subjects were tested with 120 mg pyridostigmine because of the severe side-effects of the drug at this dosage. Our present data strongly suggest that in humans there is a sex-related difference in the neuroregulation of GH secretion and this is probably expressed through a different cholinergic tone.\r"

A specific immunostaining was observed for ER and PR in HBE cells. This immunostaining was nuclear, varying from cell to cell in positivity and intensity of staining. Moreover, ER and PR immunostaining was hormone-modulated: it increased in E2-treated cells and decreased after addition of the progestin R5020. In fibroblasts, a weak ER immunostaining and a stronger PR immunostaining could be observed; however it was not modified by either E2 or progestogen treatment. Thus, in normal breast epithelial cells, E2 stimulates both its own receptor and PR, whereas the progestin R5020 lowers ER and PR content. In contrast, ER and PR content in normal breast fibroblasts seem to be independent of E2 or P action.\r"

  ".W": "It is well documented that the hypothalamic decapeptide gonadoliberin (GnRH) controls the biosynthesis and secretion of pituitary gonadotropins; however, it is still unclear whether GnRH synthesized by the placenta plays the same role with respect to hCG. In the current study we have investigated the acute response of placenta tissue to a single GnRH pulse as well as the influence of GnRH pulses on the secretion of hCG and hCG mRNA concentrations elicited several hours after application of the peptide hormone. For this purpose we have used a superfusion culture model of first trimester placenta tissue (8-12 weeks of gestation). In the first hour after explantation of the tissue, hCG secretion was decreased, and increasing amounts of free subunits were released. Afterward, the original hCG secretion rates were recovered and maintained for several days, attended by decreased levels of free subunits in the culture medium. The superfusion model was superior to static incubations, since it showed approximately a 4-fold higher amount of hCG to be secreted within 24 h (day 3 of cultures). A single GnRH pulse (1 mumol/L; 30 min) caused a significantly increased transient release of hCG (P less than 0.0001). Two GnRH pulses (concentration range, 0.01-10 mumol/L; 30 min) applied 24 h after (first pulse) and in the interval between 36-48 h after (second pulse) the start of the superfusion culture elicited a long-lasting 2-fold increase in the hCG secretion rate, which rose approximately 6 h after the second GnRH pulse. This was correlated with increased mRNA concentrations measured by means of Northern blots of total RNA. At 0.02 mumol/L GnRH, 4-fold higher beta mRNA levels were observed. The alpha mRNA levels were 2.5-fold elevated. GnRH pulses of 0.01 and 10 mumol/L, respectively, were ineffective. A further effect of GnRH pulses was augmentation of the episodic character of hCG secretion. Our results suggest that GnRH causes different specific acute and late effects on the amount and pattern of hCG secretion as well as on hCG biosynthesis at the levels of both hCG subunit mRNAs.\r"

The human islets were obtained from the Human Islet Transplant Center at Washington University Medical Center (St. Louis, MO). Substrates used to facilitate islet attachment were poly-L-lysine, gelatin, Matrigel, collagen, and bovine corneal endothelial cell matrix. RPMI-1640 medium was supplemented with either 22.2 mM glucose or 10 micrograms/mL human insulin. FGF-saporin mitotoxin was used at a concentration of 10 nM. The greatest improvement in islet cell function in either static or stimulated situations was obtained when we used bovine corneal endothelial cell matrix as the matrix, supplemented the medium with a high concentration of glucose or insulin, and eliminated fibroblast-like cells by exposing the cultures to basic FGF-saporin mitotoxin. The conditions described in this report could greatly improve the culture of human islets for use in clinical and laboratory research.\r"

  ".W": "CGS 16949A (fadrozole hydrochloride), a potent cytochrome P450-mediated steroidogenesis inhibitor, blocks aromatase at low doses, but other biosynthetic steps at higher concentrations. Recent studies demonstrated inhibition of C11-hydroxylase, corticosterone methyloxidase-II, and deoxycorticosterone to corticosterone conversion with this agent at some-what higher concentrations than those required for blockade of aromatase. Based upon phase I studies, we postulated that relatively selective inhibition of aromatase might be possible if sufficiently low doses of CGS 16949A were used. A phase II study in 54 postmenopausal women with metastatic breast cancer examined the effects of low dose CGS 16949A on estrogen, mineralocorticoid, and glucocorticoid secretion. Two dose schedules and two dose levels were chosen based upon our prior dose escalation protocol study. Plasma estrone, estradiol, and estrone sulfate as well as urinary estrone and estradiol fell equally with 1.8-4 mg CGS 16949A given either on a twice daily or three times daily dose schedule. Isotopic kinetic studies demonstrated an 84% decrease in the rate of conversion of androstenedione to estrone to 0.40 +/- 0.07% (patients receiving 1.8-4 mg CGS 16949A daily). With these three regimens, basal levels of aldosterone and cortisol did not change significantly over a 12-week period of observation. Clinical examination, plasma electrolytes, and urinary sodium/potassium ratios suggested no biological evidence of mineralo-corticoid deficiency. ACTH-stimulated cortisol concentrations, however, were blunted at each dose level compared to pretreatment values. Nonetheless, peak responses exceeded 550 nmol/L, or a basal to peak difference of 190 nmol/L or greater, in 97% of instances. This probably reflected inhibition of C11-hydroxylase, since basal and ACTH-stimulated levels of 11-deoxycortisol were increased in response to CGS 16949A. Androstenedione and 17 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone also exhibited an upward trend in response to drug treatment. ACTH-stimulated aldosterone levels were blunted to a greater extent than those of cortisol, probably as a reflection of corticosterone methyloxidase type II blockade. Overall, the results suggest that CGS 16949A, at doses of 1.8-2 mg daily, blocks aromatase effectively and does not produce clinically important inhibition of cortisol or aldosterone biosynthesis. Thus, this agent can probably be used safely without glucocorticoid or mineralocorticoid supplementation.\r"

Histopathology Departments should establish their own system, developing an audit strategy for their particular laboratory and obtaining funding in advance. The experience gained from Southampton would suggest that such local systems are best kept fairly straightforward, so that they can be managed readily and do not become too onerous. Individual departments should institute a forum for presenting the results of their audit, and should consider how they might go about correcting any inadequacies detected by their system. It is also important for a department to decide on the extent up which their findings are to be disseminated more widely, in particular to the administration and managerial staff of their institute.\r"

This correlated with the higher concentration of urea generally found in urine samples from older children compared with neonatal urines. Two of 13 neonatal urine samples, however, were inhibitory despite low urea concentrations--presumably due to metabolites derived from parenteral nutrition. The inhibitory effects of urine were effectively removed by simple dialysis or ultrafiltration. The sensitivity and specificity of PCR for detecting cytomegalovirus DNA in urine were further improved by using \"nested\" primers and a modified PCR protocol entailing the use of reduced reactants in the first 20 cycles of a two-stage 50 cycle PCR.\r"

  ".W": "Current laboratory practice in testing for HIV antibodies in western Europe was investigated by means of a questionnaire addressed to the 12 EC countries and Finland, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland. Despite inevitable regional differences there was a fair degree of homogeneity in broad laboratory organisation and in the types of tests and confirmatory strategies used. The primary test is always some form of enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), though a number of laboratories also use agglutination tests. Confirmation is by an ELISA of a different type, or by Western blot, or both. The size and workload of laboratories covered a wide range. It is suggested that laboratories doing only a small number of tests at infrequent intervals should take extra care in validating their results and should be closely monitored. Twelve of the 16 countries studied have a quality assurance scheme for monitoring laboratory performance. Participation is voluntary but is invaluable even for the largest laboratories. The results suggest that the standard of laboratory diagnosis is reasonably uniform throughout the region, which is not only important for the individual patient but means that epidemiological comparisons of data from different areas have at least a sound technical base.\r"

When 73 urine samples from 56 men with acute non-gonococcal urethritis were examined by direct immunofluorescence (MicroTrak), centrifuging 1 ml volumes of urine at 13,000 rpm for five minutes was at least as efficient for detecting C trachomatis as centrifuging larger volumes at 3000 rpm for 30 minutes. Furthermore, examination of urine produced during a visit to a sexually transmitted disease clinic was at least as efficient as examination of early morning urine for detecting C trachomatis by MicroTrak, or by an enzyme immunoassay (IDEIA). Both modifications have practical advantages and should encourage the use of urine samples for diagnosing chlamydial infections in men.\r"

  ".W": "The role of pH, citrate buffer, and urea were investigated in the suicidal destruction of Helicobacter pylori, with particular reference to the organism's urea and ammonia metabolism. The median five minute survival of H pylori in the presence of 50 mmol/l urea in 0.2 M citrate buffer at pH 6.0 was only 14%, compared with 53% in the same solution at pH 7.0. The median amount of ammonium released into the incubating solution over five minutes was lower at pH 6.0 (9 mumol) than at pH 7.0 (18 mumol) despite similar uptake of urea. The median five minute survival of H pylori in 0.2 M citrate buffer, pH 6.0, decreased from 89% to 14% when the urea concentration was increased from 1 mmol/l to 50 mmol/l. Likewise, the recovery in the incubating solution of ammonia resulting from the hydrolysis of urea fell from 27% to 3% when the initial urea concentration was increased from 1 mmol/l to 50 mmol/l. Survival of H pylori in the presence of 30 mmol/l urea at pH 6.0 was compared in 0.2 M citrate, acetate, and phosphate buffers. The median five minute survival was less in the citrate buffer, at 29%, than in either the acetate buffer 80% or the phosphate buffer 100%. The percentage recovery of ammonia was similar in the three buffers. These findings indicate that the suicidal destruction of the bacterium may be explained by intracellular accumulation of ammonia due to production in excess of the rate of excretion.\r"

The correlation between serology and the non-invasive [14C] breath test was very good. Only one of 24 culture positive patients was, while all 23 culture negative patients were, breath test negative. In a group of 46 healthy elderly persons, however, significant anomalies between serology and breath test were observed. Only 83% of the breath test negative persons were seronegative, while only 68% of the breath test positive persons were seropositive. These results can be explained in terms of age related atrophic gastritis and immune incompetence, causing reduced colonisation and decreased antibody production, respectively. These investigations suggest that non-invasive tests for H pylori infection may not be reliable in the elderly.\r"

In short term (12 day) studies chemical analysis of complete stool collections for haemderived porphyrins (HemoQuant) gave results closely correlated with those obtained by measuring stool loss of 51Cr-labelled red blood cells. Whole body counting for 59Fe was relatively insensitive to small blood losses but allowed losses to be followed up over longer periods. Chemical analysis of faecal porphyrins thus provides a satisfactory alternative to radioisotopic techniques in short term quantitation of faecal blood loss, while longer term whole body counting of 59Fe may still be appropriate in a few patients for the detection and quantification of intermittent blood losses.\r"

Values for plasma iron turnover, marrow iron turnover, and erythron transferrin uptake were derived using two ferrokinetic models. One entailed analysis of the extended plasma iron clearance over a number of days, the other comprised analysis of the initial plasma iron clearance during the first few hours of the study. A close correlation was found between the variables quantifying total erythropoiesis (marrow iron turnover and erythron transferrin uptake) in the two methodologies. Functional classifications produced by both models and based on the values for plasma iron turnover, marrow iron turnover, and erythron transferrin uptake were compared. Both models identified functional heterogeneity in the group with myelofibrosis and functional homogeneity within the MDS group. Each method produced comparable data on erythropoiesis. The main reason for analysing the extended plasma iron clearance is to differentiate levels of effective and ineffective erythropoiesis. The short analysis presents the practical advantages associated with a one-day study. This could be further enhanced if the level of effective erythropoiesis could be clearly defined.\r"

  ".U": "91258579\r", 
  ".W": "In South Africa asymptomatic wart virus infection diagnosed by morphological criteria occurs in 16-20% of all ethnic groups; the incidence in black women is 66%. To identify human papillomavirus (HPV) types the prevalence of HPV in cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) in South African women (n = 72) with age matched British women (n = 73) was compared by non-isotopic in situ hybridisation (NISH) using digoxigenin labelled probes for HPV 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33 and 35 on archival biopsy specimens. A higher proportion of British biopsy specimens (68%) contained HPV than those from South Africa (50%) in CIN 2 and 3; this difference was due to HPV 16. Thirty six per cent of the positive biopsy specimens from South African women also contained HPV 33/35 compared with 16% in the United Kingdom. There was no difference in HPV detection with age in either group. These data indicate that HPV types vary geographically, with \"minor\" HPV types being more common in South Africa. Three qualitatively distinct NISH signals were observed; a diffuse (type 1) signal in superficial cells, mainly koilocytes; a punctate signal (type 2) in basal/\"undifferentiated\" cells in CIN 3; and combined type 1 and 2 signals in CIN with wart virus infection (type 3). The punctate signal may represent HPV integration.\r"

  ".W": "In a previous study three types of HPV signal were described in CIN. It was suggested that a type 1 signal represented episomal HPV while a type 2 signal represented integrated HPV; and a type 3 signal was indicative of both episomal and integrated HPV. To test this hypothesis 91 squamous cell cancers (SCC) of the cervix from Britain and South Africa were examined for HPV 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 35. Of the South African group (n = 69) 64% contained HPV types 16 (n = 29) and 18 (n = 15). The SCC in the British group (n = 22) contained HPV 16 and HPV 33 in 12 and three cases, respectively. Of the HPV positive biopsy specimens, 86% showed a type 2 signal in keratinising and non-keratinising tumours and the remainder a type 3 signal. Type 3 signal was present only in keratinising tumours. The presence of punctate signal in 100% of HPV containing SCC, together with localisation of HPV signal to sister chromatids in tumour cell mitotic figures in vivo, provides further evidence for type 2, and the punctate component of type 3 signal representing viral integration.\r"

None of the classic (volume % epithelium and stroma) or morphometric features (nuclear area, nuclear axis ratio. shape factors) provided significant results. In Cox regression analysis a multivariate combination of the mean MI, the SD of the mean MI, and the maximum MI emerged, which provided a satisfying means of differentiating patients with a good (68% survival) and a poor (28% survival) prognosis.

Histologically, all the tumours were composed of small ducts with a double cell lining surrounded by a basement membrane. The inner cells were epithelial and the outer cells myoepithelial, the latter usually possessing clear cytoplasm. There was a variable degree of intervening hyalinised stroma. All the tumours were partly encapsulated, but also displayed local invasiveness. One of the tumours also showed areas of dedifferentiation when it later recurred and metastasised. The other three were apparently cured by initial excision, with adjuvant radiotherapy in one instance. In the past this tumour has been described as clear cell adenoma, and it was only recently that its true malignant nature, albeit low grade, was recognised. Reports of epithelial-myoepithelial carcinoma are still relatively few, with only one case described from Britain. It is recommended that this histologically distinct neoplasm deserves wider recognition.\r"

This study performed a quantitative audit of the types of specimens reported by trainees at a teaching hospital and a district general hospital. At the teaching hospital all cases are seen by trainees and it was predicted that the distribution of specimens among trainees would be entirely random. Significant variations were found in the number of skin, breast, cervix, prostate, and endometrial cases reported by each trainee. In some cases this related to a trainee having a special interest (skin and breast pathology) or areas requiring special techniques (breast pathology). At the district general hospital the workload was much higher so that juniors did not see all cases and junior trainees were not seeing bronchial, liver, or lymph node biopsy specimens. This type of audit shows that in teaching hospitals specialisation by some trainees (as encouraged by the new MRCPath exam) may be to the detriment of others and that in district general hospitals pressure of work may actually reduce a trainee's exposure to difficult cases. Without systematic audit this would not be recognised and remedied.\r"

A second Westergren ESR, using anticoagulated but undiluted blood, was measured on 58 specimens to give an ICSH \"expected\" ESR. The ESrT-system 200 result was within 12 mm/first hour of the \"expected\" result for 91% of the specimens.

  ".W": "The two doctors in this case made mistakes that could make it difficult for them to salvage their relationship and accomplish their mutual goal of Dr. Brown buying into Dr. Klein's practice. Such errors can seriously jeopardize a planned buy-in and should be avoided by others who wish to pursue this strategy. Dentists can avoid these mistakes by taking the time to discuss and clarify their intentions, and to specify the details of the arrangement at the beginning of the associateship or soon thereafter. They should also obtain qualified professional assistance to help plan and structure the arrangement. The information, knowledge and expertise is available to do it right, and there is no reason to make the kinds of mistakes made in this case. Successfully implementing an associateship buy-in or buy-out, or the outright sale or purchase of a dental practice, is no longer a mystery. These sorts of arrangements and transactions can be structured to accommodate the interests of both parties.\r"

Thermography is not useful in assessing some common dental problems, such as periapical granuloma. Promising reports, however, support its use in the diagnosis of neuralgias and atypical odontalgia, TMJ, nerve damage and repair after oral surgery, and in evaluating local dental anesthesia. Unfortunately, few if any of these studies were properly designed or conducted, limiting current attempts to define the value of thermography in dentistry. Until this situation resolves, ET of the face, for use in dentistry, can only be considered an investigational procedure. More research will clarify the precise contribution of thermography to dental problems.\r"

No statistically significant differences were observed among the restorative combinations, or among technique variables after two years in terms of retention, sensitivity or USPHS categories. However, other factors related to tooth flexure--such as occlusal stress, patient age, restorative material and restoration location--showed statistically significant associations with retention failures. These results support a tooth flexural theory of restoration retention.\r"
