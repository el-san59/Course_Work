  ".W": "A total of 359 general practitioner organisers of continuing medical education in England and Wales were sent a questionnaire on their role and responsibilities in 1985; 206 with relevant duties replied. The results of the survey showed that they were playing an effective part in planning, organising, and evaluating educational activities at district level, that many were highly qualified and experienced general practitioners, and that many had previously been concerned in vocational training. Less than half had undergone formal training for their continuing education role. Only 105 (51%) were appointed district general practitioner tutors. They were more active in postgraduate centres than in practice based education. Almost a quarter (49) spent three to five hours a week on their educational duties, but 111 (54%) spent fewer hours. Although well provided with educational resources, few had any control over district educational funds, and over half lacked office space. As to remuneration, 161 (78%) received 500 pounds or less a year and almost two thirds received no reimbursement for expenses. Most had no job description. Attention is drawn to the case for appointing general practitioner organisers of continuing medical education (\"district general practice tutors\") in all districts of England and Wales, to their role in improving the participation of general practitioners in continuing medical education, and to the urgent need for a national agreement on their job description, preparation, support, and remuneration.\r"

Diamorphine is the opioid of choice because of its high solubility. If other drugs such as antiemetics, anticholinergics, sedatives, or steroids are required they may also be given by syringe driver. This method is particularly useful for domiciliary care, where the practical difficulties of providing regular parenteral analgesia are otherwise formidable.\r"

The patients with 7S IgM had significantly higher IgM rheumatoid factor (IgM RF) and C-reactive protein levels in their sera (p less than 0.005). There was a strong correlation between 7S IgM and IgM RF levels in the sera of these patients. These data demonstrate that patients with more active and severe disease have 7S IgM present in their sera but the absence of 7S IgM from the sera of some patients with high levels of IgM RF and CRP suggest that additional factors may influence the synthesis and secretion of 7S IgM by B cells in RA.\r"

Forty-nine patients refused surgery and eight were found to have advanced inoperable tumours. Seventy-one patients had a total cystectomy. There were no operative deaths but post-operative complications occurred in nine cases. Eight patients died within 2 years but 21 were well and tumour-free at 5 years.

Four patients have been regrafted for chronic rejection and graft failure. Thirteen patients have required surgery in the postoperative period for: bleeding (two), removal of abdominal packs (four), biliary leaks and obstruction (five), duodenal perforation (one) and small bowel obstruction (one). Acute rejection was common, occurring in 30 patients and progressing to chronic rejection in 4. Ten patients developed renal failure with an 80 per cent mortality and eleven patients developed grand mal fits. Severe bleeding (greater than 70 units) was associated with previous abdominal surgery and a high mortality (88.9 per cent). Opportunistic fungal infection carried a 100 per cent mortality. Although more than half of all transplanted patients will survive for more than one year, the postoperative period is still one of high morbidity and mortality.\r"

  ".W": "During the years 1972-85, 89 children aged 0-14 were registered with leukaemia in the West Berkshire and Basingstoke and North Hampshire District Health Authorities. Two nuclear establishments are located within the health authorities, and a third is situated nearby. Fifty of the 143 electoral wards in the two district health authorities lie wholly within, or have at least half their area lying within, a circle of radius 10 km around the establishments. In those 50 electoral wards 41 children aged 0-14 were registered with leukaemia, 28.6 registrations being expected on the basis of leukaemia registration rates in England and Wales (incidence ratio = 1.4, p less than 0.05). This excess was confined to children aged 0-4, among whom there were 29 registrations of leukaemia, 14.4 being expected (incidence ratio = 2.0, p less than 0.001). In the remaining 93 electoral wards there was a small and non-significant increase in the number of registrations of leukaemia at age 0-14 (48 observed, 40.8 expected; incidence ratio = 1.2). There was no obvious trend in the incidence of childhood leukaemia over the 14 years and the overall occurrence of the malignancy in the 143 electoral wards was consistent with a random distribution. In the surrounding Oxford and Wessex Regional Health Authorities the number of registrations of leukaemia at age 0-14 was virtually identical with that expected on the basis of registration rates in England and Wales (362 observed, 372.5 expected; incidence ratio = 1.0). These data indicate that in the two district health authorities studied there was an excess incidence of childhood leukaemia during 1972-85 in the vicinity of the nuclear establishments. In the West Berkshire and Basingstoke and North Hampshire District Health Authorities an average of 60,000 children aged 0-14 lived within a 10 km radius of a nuclear establishment each year. The normal expectation of leukaemia in these children was two cases a year, whereas the recorded incidence was three cases per year, representing one extra case of leukaemia each year among these 60,000 children.\r"

It was concluded that the increase could not be accounted for by an underestimate of the risk of leukaemia per unit dose of radiation at low doses and low dose rates, nor by an underestimate of the relative biological efficiency of high as compared with low linear energy transfer radiation. One possible explanation was underestimation of doses to the red bone marrow due to the discharges at Dounreay relative to the dose from fallout, though investigation of ways in which this might have occurred did not suggest anything definite. Other possible explanations included a misconception of the site of origin of childhood leukaemia, outbreaks of an infectious disease, and exposure to some other, unidentified environmental agent. These findings weigh heavily against the hypothesis that the recent increase in childhood leukaemia near Dounreay might be accounted for by radioactive discharges from nuclear plants, unless the doses to the stem cells from which childhood leukaemia originates have been grossly underestimated.\r"

Improvement in mood was associated with domestic happiness and satisfaction at working efficiently and to time. Mood was significantly lower when the doctor was on call. Women doctors were more prone to mood changes associated with domestic matters. Responses to a questionnaire suggested that the doctors preferred traditional clinical medicine to problems of a social or psychological origin. Managerial skills would help alleviate several of the problems identified in this study and should be more prominent in the training that all doctors receive.\r"

  ".U": "87158595\r", 
  ".W": "The aging of the elderly population is of crucial importance as people who are over 80 make far greater use of health and social services than any other age group. Government guidelines on the provision of services, which are generally related to the whole population aged 65 and over, fail to take account of this change in the age structure of the elderly population and are no longer appropriate. Recent trends in the provision of domiciliary services, day care, specialist housing for the elderly, and residential care have been related to changes in the number of potential consumers. Ironically, despite the government's stated commitment to \"community care,\" the chief growth area has been private institutional care. The number of day care places and sheltered housing units has also increased in real terms, but the provision of domiciliary services, such as home help and health visitor visits to the elderly, has either fallen behind or barely matched the increase in the number of very old people. If community care is to be made a reality and if the present inadequate levels of service are to be maintained, let alone improved, then additional resources, greater cooperation among agencies, and a more imaginative approach to the development and delivery of services are urgently needed.\r"

Performance status improved in 67%, patient-scored pain improved in 75%, and quality of life improved in 58%.

Factor VIII-related antigen (FVIIIAg) was identified only in cells lining vascular spaces. Electron microscopic study of one tumor demonstrated well-formed glands having basement membranes, junctional complexes, and apical secretory granules.

  ".W": "Previously the authors reported that the fat emulsion of 1-(2-tetrahydrofuryl)-5-fluorouracil, tegafur (FT-207), yielded significantly higher concentrations of tegafur in the lymph and plasma compared to tegafur enteric-coated granules (FT-G). However, the emulsification did not improve the metabolic conversion rate of tegafur to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). A study was performed to assay the plasma and lymphatic concentrations of tegafur, 5-FU, and uracil in seven patients after radical surgery for gastric carcinoma who were given a combined oral preparation of FT-207 and uracil (UFT). Both lymph and plasma 5-FU levels after UFT were 20 times greater than those after FT-G, although FT-207 levels were not different. Patients given UFT showed significantly greater 5-FU and uracil concentrations in the lymph compared with the plasma. The results of this study suggest a potential use of UFT as an adjuvant postoperative chemotherapeutic agent for gastric carcinoma.\r"

In addition, an effort was made to derive mathematical equations that describe the CO2-profile in the expiratory limb of the Bain circuit, the amount of CO2 rebreathed, and the effect of this rebreathing on the alveolar gas composition. Data obtained with the bench model and with the equations were compared to data from the literature. The effect of the Bain circuit on gas exchange was compared to that of an equivalent dead space.\r"

  ".U": "87159932\r", 
  ".W": "In Phase I of the NHLBI trial of Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI), 290 patients admitted within 7 hr after onset of acute infarction were randomly assigned to intravenous treatment with either streptokinase (SK) or recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA). Left ventricular function was measured from contrast ventriculograms in 145 patients with both pretreatment and predischarge studies analyzable. Regional wall motion in the infarct site was measured by the centerline method and expressed in units of standard deviations (SDs) from the mean motion in 52 normal subjects. Patients treated with rt-PA (n = 77) achieved a significantly higher reperfusion rate after 90 min of treatment. Perfusion of the infarct-related artery improved from visual grade 0 or 1 (total occlusion or penetration without perfusion) to grade 2 or 3 (partial or full reperfusion) in 62% receiving rt-PA vs 31% receiving SK (n = 68) (p less than .001). However, the ejection fraction did not change significantly from before treatment to before discharge in either treatment group (+0.7 +/- 6.7% vs +1.0 +/- 8.3%, respectively). A small but significant increase in regional wall motion was observed in each of the two groups (+0.4 +/- 0.8 vs +0.3 +/- 0.8 SD/chord, respectively; each p less than .001 compared with baseline). This was countered by declines in the hyperkinesis of the noninfarct region (-0.3 +/- 1.0 SD/chord [p = .01] compared with baseline and -0.2 +/- 1.0 SD/chord [p = .23], respectively). Analysis of the combined groups revealed that the ejection fraction increased only in patients who achieved reperfusion by 90 min after onset of therapy or who had subtotal occlusions initially. There was greater recovery of left ventricular function in patients who achieved reperfusion earlier vs later than 4 hr after symptom onset and in patients with vs without some collateral circulation to the infarct-related artery.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of beta-adrenergic blockade on the salvage and functional recovery of reperfused myocardium was investigated in anesthetized dogs. Immediately after thrombotic occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery, the cardioselective beta-blocking agent metoprolol was given intravenously at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg infused over 10 min. One hour after the onset of occlusion, recanalization was initiated by intravenous infusion of recombinant human tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA, 10 micrograms/kg/min for 30 min). Anatomic infarct size expressed as percent of the left ventricular mass (I/LV), global ejection fraction, and mean systolic shortening of the segmental radii (SS) of the infarcted area were measured either after 24 hr or 1 week in six groups of six dogs each: group I (rt-PA + metoprolol, evaluated at 24 hr), group II (rt-PA + metoprolol, evaluated at 1 week, group III (rt-PA alone, evaluated at 24 hr), group IV (rt-PA alone, evaluated at 1 week), group V (persistent occlusion, evaluated at 24 hr), and group VI (persistent occlusion, evaluated at 1 week). The smallest infarcts were found in reperfused dogs given metoprolol, but the differences from dogs receiving rt-PA alone were not statistically significant (I/LV, expressed as mean +/- SEM: 5.5 +/- 0.9% in group I, 6.7 +/- 1.9% in group II, 15.4 +/- 5.0% in group III, 11.4 +/- 3.5% in group IV, 23.6 +/- 2.5% in group V, and 26.9 +/- 2.3% in group VI).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "We examined the effect of nitroglycerin (GTN) tolerance on an important determinant of nitrate-antianginal action, large coronary artery dilation, in 11 chronically instrumented conscious dogs. In addition, endothelium-mediated coronary artery dilation was studied because this shares a common dilator pathway with the nitrates, i.e., activation of soluble guanylate cyclase. With long-term GTN (1.5 micrograms/kg/min iv for 5 days) the diameters of the left circumflex and anterior descending coronary arteries showed an initial increase of 8.2 +/- 0.3% and 10.8 +/- 0.9%, respectively, returning to control levels by the second to third day of treatment. On days 4 and 5, the dose-response relations for GTN-induced epicardial artery dilation were shifted (p less than .01) to 17- to 20-fold higher doses. However, there was no attenuation of epicardial artery dilation induced by SIN-1 (n = 7), another activator of guanylate cyclase, or of endothelium-mediated dilation assessed both as flow-dependent dilation (n = 7) and as direct intra-arterial acetylcholine-induced dilation (n = 4). In addition, there was no clear tolerance to the peripheral vascular actions of GTN responsible for reflex tachycardia and increased coronary flow. We conclude that a moderate degree of nitrate tolerance to epicardial artery dilation does not affect the responsiveness to other exogenous or endogenous activators of guanylate cyclase. However, this tolerance to epicardial artery dilation, together with the maintenance of peripheral vascular actions that can induce reflex tachycardia, result in a potentially unfavorable balance of GTN effects.\r"

It is recommended that patients who are fit and have tumours confined to the tympanum should have primary surgical treatment.

In 13 non-HD patients with serum creatinine values from 2.0 to 8.3 mg/dl, mean plasma hANP (+/- SE) was 404 +/- 23 pg/ml, while it was 236 +/- 11 pg/ml in the normal control group (n = 15) and the difference was significant (p less than 0.001). In all patients as a whole, there was a positive correlation between plasma hANP and mean blood pressure (r = 0.56, p less than 0.05) but no correlation was present between plasma hANP and renal function. Fifty-six HD patients were divided into 2 groups depending on blood pressure level. Plasma levels of hANP in the hypertensive (BP greater than or equal to 150/90 mmHg, n = 21) and in the normotensive (BP less than 150/90 mmHg, n = 35) HD group were 588 +/- 58 pg/ml and 364 +/- 29 pg/ml, respectively, with plasma hANP in both HD groups significantly higher than in the controls (p less than 0.001). There was also a significant difference of plasma hANP between hypertensive and normotensive HD patients (p less than 0.01). However, when the normotensive HD group without cardiomegaly (cardiothoracic ratio less than 50%, n = 17) was compared with the control, the value of plasma hANP was not statistically different from that of the control group. These results suggest that plasma hANP in patients with impaired renal function is influenced by blood pressure and/or cardiac condition.\r"

  ".U": "87160199\r", 
  ".W": "Within the diaphyseal cortex, the primary resorption phase of Paget's disease is often limited either to the endosteum or to the central layers of the cortex. This results in primary resorption fronts that are usually discrete, both radiologically and scintigraphically. The subsequent activation of the subperiosteal cortex may be delayed, leading to secondary expanding fronts associated with subperiosteal new bone formation. Sequential radiographs of 19 untreated patients followed 6.4 +/- 1.2 years showed that the mean extension rate of the lesions within cortical bone was 8 +/- 0.5 mm/year per advancing front. This extension rate showed no significant change in 15 patients treated with calcitonin (CT) and/or ethane-1-hydroxy-1,1-diphosphonate (EHDP), but was significantly decreased in 14 patients treated with 3-amino-1-hydroxypropilidene-1,1-diphosphonate (APD). The increased remodeling rate of pagetic bone magnifies the radiologic changes due to mechanical, dystrophic, and metabolic interferences. Thus, a sclerotic pattern of the disease may rapidly change into a mixed or even a lytic pattern under the influence of any rarefying factor. Conversely, lytic pagetic bone may transform into dense bone through the administration of antiosteoclastic medications such as CT and APD. The reconstructive action of any new therapeutic regimen should be monitored radiologically.\r"

There was difficulty separating the cause of back pain in those patients with coexistent Paget's disease and osteoarthritis, even when the diseases were present at different levels of the spine. The pathogenesis of Paget's disease appears to precipitate osteoarthritis and several low back syndromes. Suppressive therapy with disodium etidronate (EHDP) for Paget's disease was of benefit in eight of 22 patients (36%) with identifiable osteoarthritis. It is suggested that EHDP and perhaps other suppressive agents for Paget's disease receive limited use in patients with back pain unless a defined pagetic lesion appears related to the clinical syndrome in the absence of identifiable osteoarthritis.\r"

Particular attention is given to the pharmacology of the drug, to methods of assessment of efficacy, and to the quality and the long-term persistence of the treatment results. These studies are compared to previously reported studies on bisphosphonates (P-C-Ps). The data suggest that the efficacy of P-C-Ps in Paget's disease results from a physiologic adaptation of all cellular processes involved in bone metabolism to a primary inhibition of bone resorption. The prolonged persistence of remissions may indicate that this is associated with disappearance rather than suppression of pathogenic material. If the low specific toxicity of the new generations of P-C-Ps is confirmed, it will be possible to induce complete and prolonged remissions through short oral or parenteral treatment courses that are associated with minimal side effects. Early institution of treatment in selected patients may prevent the development of deformity, fracture, and pain.\r"

When mean Q values of the group for each intervention were compared, close agreement was observed between dye dilution and each noninvasive method (QDOP = 1.08 QDD - 0.07 L/min X m2, r = 0.99, SEE = 0.02; QCO2 = 0.68 QDD + 0.84 L/min X m2, r = 0.97, SEE = 0.02).

However, the Doppler ultrasound technique was significantly more precise in quantitating changes in Q in individual patients. These results demonstrate that estimates of Q can be made with reasonable accuracy by either CO2 rebreathing or Doppler echocardiography.

  ".W": "The effects of increasing glucose intake on nitrogen balance, energy expenditure and fuel utilization were measured in malnourished adult patients receiving parenteral nutrition with constant nitrogen intake and high or low glucose intakes for 8 day periods. Energy balance, nitrogen balance, weight and temperature were determined daily. Blood samples taken at admission and at the end of days 7 and 8 of each diet were analysed for glucose, fatty acids, urea, insulin, glucagon and thyroid hormones. The effect of increasing glucose intake was to increase nitrogen balance by 0.28 +/- 0.08 (SEM) mg/kJ. A scheme is proposed, based on present and previous findings, of the separate effects of nitrogen and energy intake on nitrogen balance, permitting calculation of rates of repletion of fat and lean body mass from estimates of nitrogen intake and energy balance. Malnourished patients are shown to attain markedly positive nitrogen balances at zero or negative energy balances. Large errors in estimation of energy requirements have little effect on nitrogen balance. Changes in nitrogen balance were entirely due to changes in urea excretion. Creatinine excretion increased 12% with high glucose intake, attributed mainly to increased muscle mass (7%) and body temperature (4%). A 12% increase in resting energy expenditure was only partly due to costs of glycogen storage and lipogenesis; the remainder, about one-half, is probably due to glucose and insulin mediated increases in sympathetic activity. There were marked increases in 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine (T3) concentrations with time, but no difference between the high and low glucose diets. The T3/thyroxine ratio, an index of free T3 concentration, increased much more rapidly on the high than on the low glucose diet. Changes in T3 could not account for the effect of glucose, under these conditions, to increase resting energy expenditure.\r"

None of the patients had significant auscultatory findings suggestive of pulmonary secretions, and chest roentgenographic films were normal. Arterial blood gas evaluation failed to reveal the usual hypocapnia during ketoacidosis, thus prompting bronchoscopic examination or deep airway suctioning. These interventions disclosed and resolved the mucous obstruction of the compromised bronchus. Antibiotic therapy, based upon bronchial secretion Gram stain and culture, was successfully instituted in all patients. Lethargy and autonomic neuropathy are proposed as contributing factors responsible for occult mucous plugging in diabetic patients in ketoacidosis. The absence of hypocapnia in this setting may be the only clue to silent mucous plugging of airways.\r"

The standard mode, therapist-administered up-draft nebulization (UDN), is labor-intensive and therefore relatively costly. The alternative mode, self-administration by a metered dose inhaler (MDI), is less costly, but its efficacy over an entire hospitalization has heretofore not been established. Patients were enrolled after transfer to the pulmonary ward from the emergency room or intensive care units (ICU). We then randomized them to receive metaproterenol q4h either via MDI or UDN. Daily spirometry revealed that MDI and UDN were associated with equivalent bronchodilation initially and equivalent improvement at discharge. The duration of hospitalization for the two groups was also the same. Thus, the two delivery methods were equally effective. We could not attribute this equivalence to pretreatment intergroup differences or to differences in concomitant therapy with steroids, theophylline, other bronchodilators, or antibiotics. Routine use of MDI rather than UDN in all non-ICU adult patients would save $253,487 per year at our institution alone.\r"

  ".W": "Regulatory actions of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF beta) on granulosa cell function were analyzed in cells cultured from the ovaries of diethylstilbestrol-implanted rats. In the presence of a suboptimal concentration of FSH (5 ng/ml) that increased LH receptors by 100-fold during a 72-h culture, TGF beta augmented this response in a dose-dependent manner with a maximal effect at 16 pM. In contrast, the growth factor inhibited the LH receptor response to an optimal dose of FSH (50 ng) by up to 50% and was inactive in the absence of gonadotropin. TGF beta also enhanced the formation of cAMP by 5 ng FSH and partially inhibited the effects of higher FSH concentrations. However, the actions of TGF beta were more prominent on LH receptor induction than on cAMP production with either low or high amounts of FSH. In addition, TGF beta had little effect on cAMP production stimulated by cholera toxin or forskolin, but amplified the actions of these ligands as well as that of 8-bromo-cAMP on LH receptor expression. TGF beta also modulated the steroidogenic activity of the granulosa cells, with increased production of progesterone in response to 5-100 ng FSH. The bifunctional actions of TGF beta on FSH-induced LH receptor formation were observed throughout a 96-h culture period. However, the presence of the growth factor was not required for the first 24 h of culture, indicating that TGF beta alters the later events involved in LH receptor formation. TGF beta augmented the stimulatory actions of 5 ng FSH on LH receptors in the absence or presence of insulin, but its inhibitory effect on these receptors was only observed in cells treated with insulin. These results indicate that TGF beta modifies FSH action during granulosa cell development in a biphasic manner. TGF beta can exert stimulatory or inhibitory effects depending upon the concentration of FSH and the presence of insulin, and these are due to alterations in cAMP action as well as cAMP production. Autocrine and/or endocrine actions of TGF beta during granulosa cell differentiation may be involved in the processes of follicle selection and development.\r"

By using two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography, germ cells were found to increase several-fold the incorporation of [32P]orthophosphate into two phosphoproteins (which we term germ cell-dependent phosphoproteins 1 and 2 or GC1 and GC2) of Sertoli cells. Increased phosphorylation of GC1 and GC2 was rapid, germ cell dose dependent, and calcium dependent. The increased phosphorylation of GC1 appears to involve calmodulin-dependent protein kinase, while phosphorylation of GC2 appears to involve the activation of calcium/phospholipid-dependent protein kinase (protein kinase C). Medium conditioned by germ cells was capable of eliciting the same response in Sertoli cells. Germ cells had no effect on the phosphorylation of proteins in Chinese hamster ovarian cells, but did result in increased phosphorylation of a protein in TR-ST cells, which migrated similarly to GC1 of Sertoli cells. Neither Chinese hamster ovarian nor TR-ST cells had any effect on Sertoli cell protein phosphorylation. These results indicate that germ cells may be directly involved in the local regulation of Sertoli cell function within the seminiferous epithelium. The results further suggest that the mechanism of germ cell-Sertoli cell interaction involves the mobilization of intracellular calcium, activation of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase, and protein kinase C. We infer from these results that germ cell-Sertoli cell interaction may operate via hydrolysis of Sertoli cell membrane phophatidylinositols.\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies indicate that an increase in calcium in the oocyte-cumulus complex (OCC) appears to be associated with induction of oocyte maturation. In contrast, we previously showed that adenosine augments FSH inhibition of maturation in isolated rat OCC. The objective of the present studies was to assess whether adenosine may inhibit calcium-induced oocyte maturation in rat OCC. Two calcium ionophores (A23187 and ionomycin) were used for these studies. In the intact OCC, both ionophores inhibited FSH-stimulated cAMP accumulation and stimulated germinal vesicle breakdown when spontaneous maturation was inhibited by FSH, but the ionophores had no effect when maturation was inhibited by Bu2 cAMP. In contrast, adenosine amplified FSH-sensitive cAMP accumulation and augmented FSH inhibition of oocyte maturation in the intact OCC. Moreover, adenosine reversed ionophore-dependent inhibition of cAMP accumulation and ionophore induction of oocyte maturation in the intact OCC incubated with FSH. Adenosine, ionophore, or FSH had no effect on oocyte maturation in denuded oocytes. Based on these results we conclude that the ionophores induced oocyte maturation by inhibition of FSH-dependent cAMP accumulation in the cumulus compartment, an effect that was probably calcium mediated. Since adenosine reversed the ionophore effects, we suggest that adenosine antagonizes the inhibitory effect of calcium on cAMP accumulation in cumulus cells and by this mechanism amplifies FSH inhibition of oocyte maturation.\r"

  ".W": "Calcitonin (CT) binds to specific receptors in the hypothalamus and has been localized in the pituitary, suggesting a potential neuroendocrine role for this peptide. We and others have previously shown that CT given centrally markedly suppresses pulsatile GH secretion. However, the mechanism mediating this response remains to be elucidated. In the present study, we assessed the involvement of the two hypothalamic GH-regulatory peptides, somatostatin (SRIF) and GH-releasing factor (GRF), using a combination of in vivo and in vitro techniques. Six-hour GH secretory profiles were obtained from eight groups of freely moving rats bearing chronic intracerebroventricular (icv) and intraatrial cannulae. In four groups, salmon (s) CT (250 ng/10 microliters) was administered icv, whereas the remaining four groups received either normal saline (NS) icv or sCT iv. Central injection of sCT caused a severe suppression in amplitude of spontaneous GH pulses compared to NS icv-treated control rats, whereas the same dose of sCT iv had no significant effect. Passive immunization of sCT icv-injected rats with a specific antiserum to SRIF failed to restore the amplitude of GH pulses to normal values. In addition, in vitro basal and 50 mM K+-stimulated SRIF release from incubated hypothalamic fragments was not altered by sCT in doses ranging from 10(-10) to 10(-6) M. The iv administration of a bolus of rat GRF (1-29)NH2 (1 microgram) 1 h after sCT icv injection also failed to augment plasma GH levels compared to sCT iv-treated rats (16.6 +/- 10.0 vs. 326.6 +/- 63.6 ng/ml; P less than 0.001) and NS icv controls (407.2 +/- 145.4 ng/ml; P less than 0.01). Blood calcium levels decreased similarly 1 h after iv and icv sCT administration. These results demonstrate that: sCT inhibits pulsatile GH secretion via a central nervous system site of action, GH suppression induced by sCT is apparently not due solely to increased hypothalamic SRIF release, and centrally administered sCT produces an acute loss of responsiveness of somatotrophs to GRF, which can be dissociated from peripheral blood calcium levels.\r"

The differential responsiveness to estrogens of these two cell types was further demonstrated in the presence of exogenous arachidonic acid (AA), a PG precursor that markedly elevated PGF2 alpha output by both epithelial and stromal cells. In epithelial cell cultures, the increases in PGF2 alpha output obtained with mixtures of E2 and AA were about 2.5-fold greater than the sum of the increases elicited by E2 or AA alone. In contrast, the effects of AA in stromal cell cultures were not enhanced by E2. Addition of the calcium ionophore A23187 to cultures of epithelial cells resulted in a Ca2+-dependent increase in PGF2 alpha output, which could be further augmented by E2 to levels almost twice the sum of those produced by each agonist alone. Unlike its effects on epithelial cells, A23187 did not significantly increase PGF2 alpha levels in stromal cell cultures, regardless of the addition of Ca2+ (1.5 mM) or E2 (10(-8)M) to the culture medium. These results suggest that the epithelia and not the stroma are the primary targets for the effects of E2 on PGF2 alpha output by the endometrium. The synergistic effects of E2 and AA (the substrate for PG synthase) or of E2 and A23187 (a stimulator of phospholipase-mediated release of AA from phospholipid stores) on PGF2 alpha production suggest that estrogens enhance PG production in epithelial cells by elevating PG synthase activity.\r"

All were soluble in acidic acetone (pH 3.5) and insoluble in ether (pH 10.5), and could be separated on the basis of charge, using anion exchange HPLC. The effect of these fractions on aromatization of androstenedione to estradiol (basal levels or FSH stimulated) was studied in vitro using Sertoli cells from immature rat testes. Agonist activity, defined as the ability to stimulate secretion of estradiol in the absence of FSH, was present in one fraction weakly retained by the anion exchange column but eluted with a linear gradient between 0.2 and 0.5 M acetate, pH 5.0. In addition to agonist activity, this fraction inhibited binding of [125I]human (h) FSH to hFSH antiserum and to receptor. Another fraction with FSH binding inhibitory activity was more strongly retained by the anion exchange HPLC column and was eluted with 1.0 M acetate, pH 3.0. This fraction demonstrated antagonist activity, as defined by its ability to inhibit FSH-stimulated, but not basal, conversion of androstenedione to estradiol in vitro. Although it inhibited [125I]hFSH binding to receptor, no immunoreactivity could be demonstrated in this fraction. These observations demonstrate that inhibition of [125I]hFSH binding to receptor can reflect either agonist or antagonist activity, and that the latter activities are present in separate and distinct fractions derived from porcine follicular fluid.\r"

Pituitary pieces from cyclic female rats were superfused in vitro in the presence of Bu2cAMP, 8-bromo-cAMP, or forskolin or used as controls. For pituitary pieces from proestrous rats, the first significant increase in the baseline FSH secretion rate occurred after approximately 90 min of exposure to elevated cAMP resulting from forskolin treatment. By comparison, in the same system LHRH caused a 3-fold increase in FSH secretion during a 10-min exposure to the peptide. In contrast to its ineffectiveness as a secretagogue, cAMP elevation resulted in a several-fold augmentation of both LHRH- and elevated K+-stimulated FSH secretion from pituitary pieces from proestrous, but not estrous, rats; for these experiments, superfusion with a cAMP analog or forskolin for varying times preceded a 10-min pulse of either 8 nM LHRH or 47 mM K+. Augmentation of K+-stimulated secretion was evident after 30 min of cAMP elevation. Priming of LHRH-stimulated FSH secretion required 30-90 min of pretreatment with cAMP; longer exposures to cAMP analogs or forskolin were coincident with greater potentiation. Cycloheximide prevented Bu2cAMP augmentation of LHRH-stimulated FSH secretion. These data show that cAMP does not mimic the FSH release action of LHRH, but does augment LHRH- or K+-stimulated FSH secretion with characteristics that lead us to suggest that cAMP mediates, at least in part, the self-priming function of LHRH.\r"

  ".W": "The spermatogenic process of normal rats at 20, 32, and 44 days of age was characterized. Variations in numbers of degenerating and abnormal cells were noted during the cycle in most age groups, indicating a stage-related vulnerability of these cells. The most advanced cell types that were seen at a particular age were frequently abnormal or degenerating. When the numbers of viable cells available to degenerate were considered, the degeneration rate in normal pubertal animals was about 15, 10, and 2 times greater in 20-, 32-, and 44-day-old animals, respectively, than in 75-day-old animals. In 32-day-old rats, neither hypophysectomy nor hypophysectomy and subsequent hormone supplementation resulted in an alteration in the qualitative pattern of germ cell degeneration during the spermatogenic cycle compared with that in the normal animal; however, the treatments did alter the quantitative response of cellular degeneration. Three days posthypophysectomy there was a marked increase in the numbers of total degenerating germ cells. FSH (60 micrograms) given twice daily (as were all hormones) reduced the numbers of degenerating cells significantly, as did LH (13 micrograms). Low dose LH (0.3 micrograms), representing the approximate contaminating dose of LH in the 60-micrograms FSH preparation, and low dose FSH (30 micrograms) did not elicit a response significantly different from that to hypophysectomy alone. LH (13 micrograms) plus FSH (60 micrograms) reduced the levels of degenerating cells such that there was no significant difference from levels in intact 32-day-old rats. The data indicated, for the cell types studied, a lack of specificity of various hormones or hormone combinations in the survival of specific germ cell types. It emphasizes the importance of FSH in pubertal spermatogenesis as well as the synergistic actions of LH and FSH.\r"

FSH stimulated accumulation of inhibin in culture media in a dose-dependent manner with maximal stimulation (6-fold) being observed at a dose of 300 ng FSH/ml. Addition of Sm-C (30 ng/ml) either alone or in the presence of FSH (3-300 ng/ml) increased inhibin production (up to 5-fold). Sm-C alone was effective over the physiological dose range of 3-100 ng/ml. Concomitant addition of FSH (100 ng/ml) and Sm-C (3-100 ng/ml) resulted in a significant increase in inhibin production at all doses of Sm-C. The dose-dependent effects of FSH and Sm-C were also time dependent with a synergistic effect apparent after 48 h of culture. The Sm-C induced FSH inhibitory activity of granulosa cell culture media was confirmed as authentic inhibin by the demonstration of a dose-dependent neutralization of this activity by a monoclonal antibody raised against purified bovine inhibin. The data indicate a direct role for both FSH and Sm-C in ovarian inhibin production and provide additional evidence for an autocrine-paracrine role for Sm-C in granulosa cell differentiation.\r"

  ".W": "Hypothalamic-pituitary-end-organ axes are frequently controlled by long loop negative feedback homeostatic mechanisms. Insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I), IGF-II, and insulin receptors have recently been described in normal and neoplastic rat and acromegalic human pituitary cells, a finding which suggests the possibility that somatomedins might exert feedback at the level of the anterior pituitary. To study the kinetics of this feedback response, we used perifused dispersed rat anterior pituitary cells to learn if somatomedins or insulin could inhibit GH-releasing hormone (GHRH)-stimulated GH secretion. Cells were exposed to hourly boluses of 1 nM GHRH with or without varying doses of IGF or insulin. IGF-I inhibited GHRH-elicited GH release with an IC50 of 6.5 nM; maximal inhibition (approximately 67%) was achieved with 10 nM IGF-I. IGF-II was a less potent hormone, with 10 nM inhibiting about 30% of GHRH-stimulated GH release. Slight inhibition of stimulated GH release (less than 15%) was seen when cells were treated with insulin, but only when doses of insulin of 10 nM or more were used. In conclusion, nanomolar concentrations of IGF-I and IGF-II inhibited GHRH-elicited GH release from perifused rat pituitary cells in a dose-dependent manner; and insulin was not an effective inhibitor of stimulated GH release at physiological peptide concentrations. In conjunction with our previous findings that the concentrations of IGF-I and IGF-II receptors greatly exceed that of insulin receptors on normal rat pituitary cells, we hypothesize that the GH-inhibiting action of high dose insulin is mediated through an IGF receptor.\r"

  ".W": "The involvement of guanine nucleotide regulatory proteins in the steroidogenic response of the adrenal glomerulosa to angiotensin II (AII) was investigated by analyzing the effects of Bordetella pertussis toxin (PT) on several aspects of AII action. These included receptor binding, stimulation of aldosterone production and GTPase activity, inhibition of cAMP production, and attenuation of the aldosterone response at high angiotensin concentrations. Pretreatment of glomerulosa cells with PT abolished the inhibitory effects of both AII and somatostatin (SRIF) on ACTH-stimulated cAMP production. Under the same incubation conditions, the stimulation of aldosterone secretion by submaximal and maximal steroidogenic concentrations of AII was completely unaffected by the toxin. However, the attenuation of steroid responses seen with supramaximal concentrations of AII was abolished. In addition, the ability of SRIF to inhibit AII-stimulated steroid production was markedly reduced by PT treatment. The binding of [125I]AII to high affinity sites in intact cells and particulate fractions, and modulation of the binding by guanine nucleotides, were unaffected by toxin pretreatment, even under conditions where a 40-41K protein was completely ADP ribosylated. In contrast, the toxin substantially diminished the binding of [125I]Tyr0-SRIF to SRIF receptors in glomerulosa cells (by 50% after 5 h and by 90% after 20 h). These results indicate that Ni or a similar protein probably mediates the inhibition of cAMP formation by AII and the attenuation of the steroid response by high concentrations of AII as well as the inhibitory actions of SRIF in the adrenal glomerulosa cell. Furthermore, the lack of effect of PT on AII binding and stimulation of GTPase activity suggests the existence of an additional pertussis-insensitive guanine nucleotide-regulatory protein that is activated by lower concentrations of AII and mediates the stimulation of aldosterone production.\r"

Plasma inhibin levels measured by a specific RIA were very low, but detectable at 5 days of age, then progressively increased until day 17, when they showed an abrupt rise. This rise was concurrent with a dramatic fall in plasma FSH levels. At day 30, inhibin values were not significantly (P greater than 0.05) different from those of adult females. The immunoneutralization of endogenous inhibin had no statistically significant (P greater than 0.05) effect on plasma FSH levels in 10-day-old immature female rats, but markedly (P less than 0.01) increased them at day 20 and 30. These results suggest that endogenous inhibin plays a physiological role in modulating FSH secretion from day 20 of age in the female rat.\r"

  ".W": "The existence of a short-term pituitary desensitization in luteinizing hormone (LH) release to single doses of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LH-RH) in the ovariectomized rat was recently disclosed. The purpose of the present study was to investigate whether this refractoriness is also present in humans. Blood from six women with amenorrhea of suprapituitary origin was sampled every 10 minutes for 300 minutes for determination of LH and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). A pulse of 20 micrograms LH-RH was given intravenously 90 and 210 minutes after the first blood sample, and 2 micrograms LH-RH was given 30, 150, 240, and 270 minutes after t0. The mean maximal increments of LH and FSH were compared. The LH response to a 2-micrograms LH-RH bolus given 30 (t240) or 60 (t150) minutes after a 20-micrograms LH-RH pulse was significantly decreased, compared with the initial response to this dose at t30. For both LH and FSH, the response to 2 micrograms LH-RH given 30 minutes after the 20-micrograms pulse (t240) was almost absent, compared with 60 (t150) minutes after the 20-micrograms dose. We conclude that a short-term pituitary refractoriness to LH-RH is present after administration of single pulses of LH-RH in women with amenorrhea of suprapituitary origin and pulses of LH-RH in the physiologic range (2 micrograms) given to these women do not always generate LH and FSH increments that are identifiable as significant hormone pulses.\r"

  ".W": "The use of artificial insemination with husband's semen (AIH) as treatment for couples with male-related or unexplained infertility is often disappointing. The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether the induction of multiple ovulation can increase the pregnancy rates in couples treated with AIH. Multiple follicular development was induced by means of clomiphene citrate (CC) plus purified follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) in 17 couples undergoing AIH for male-related or unexplained infertility. In spite of the long duration of infertility (greater than 6 years), 10 couples (58.8%) achieved pregnancy within 6 months of treatment. This figure was significantly higher than that obtained in 120 couples who underwent AIH either during spontaneous cycles or after induction of follicular development with CC alone. These results suggest that the availability of multiple mature oocytes increases the conception rate during each cycle, as reported for in vitro fertilization (IVF) programs. It is therefore suggested that a trial of induction of multiple follicular development be performed in couples with male-related or unexplained infertility before their inclusion in protocols for invasive procedures, such as IVF or gamete intrafallopian transfer.\r"

The baseline values of PRL were significantly higher (P less than 0.025), those of luteinizing hormone unchanged, and those of follicle-stimulating hormone lower (P less than 0.025) during the treatment than in the control cycles. The maximal response of PRL to the dopamine antagonist metoclopramide was increased (P less than 0.01), whereas the maximal responses of luteinizing hormone (P less than 0.025) and follicle-stimulating hormone (P less than 0.001) to gonadotropin-releasing hormone were lowered in the treatment cycles.

In studies of effects of individual lymphokines and monokines, significant antimotility effects were observed when spermatozoa were incubated with the lymphokine gamma-interferon and the monokine tumor necrosis factor.

Each partner's practice was analyzed separately to assess whether there were differences in their practices dependent on the sex of the provider. During the year, the physicians had 3,059 patient visits and recorded 4,711 problems. In all, 773 office procedures were performed; the most common were related to health maintenance. The 1,554 laboratory tests performed also showed a concentration for the purpose of health screening. This practice was less active in the areas of acute trauma and obstetrics than other reported studies. Few differences in the individual practices of the male and female physicians were noted. Categorizing the problems according to the revised diagnostic clusters demonstrates the usefulness of that system. In spite of the urban nature of the practice, a high percentage of patients using the family practice office lived in the surrounding neighborhood.\r"

Its physiologic role is unknown and it does not belong to one of the structurally related gut peptide families. Assuming that valosin may influence gastrointestinal functions, we investigated the effect of high-performance liquid chromatography-pure valosin on gastric and exocrine pancreatic secretion and on the intestinal myoelectric activity in conscious dogs. Intravenous injection of valosin (0.125-1 microgram/kg) dose-dependently increased gastric acid secretion 80-fold over basal, corresponding to 18% of the maximal pentagastrin-induced effect. Pepsin output increased 10-fold over basal (30% of the pentagastrin-stimulated secretion). Half-maximal stimulation by pentagastrin could be further increased dose-dependently by simultaneous administration of valosin. Pancreatic bicarbonate secretion was stimulated 11-fold over basal at 1.0 microgram/kg, reaching about 6% of the secretin-induced maximal output, whereas protein secretion increased 12-fold over basal, corresponding to about 55% of the cholecystokinin-induced maximal output. In fasted dogs, spontaneously occurring migrating myoelectric complexes were substantially delayed during infusion of valosin at a dose of 0.2 microgram/kg. These experiments indicate that valosin may represent a novel member of the regulatory gastrointestinal peptides.\r"

We perfused isolated rat livers with lipoprotein-free solutions and collected bile before and after addition of human low and high density lipoproteins. When human low density lipoprotein was added to solutions perfusing livers isolated from rats previously treated with ethinyl estradiol, a hormone that increases receptor-mediated uptake of low density lipoproteins by hepatocytes, the concentrations in bile of cholesterol and phospholipid, but not bile acids, increased by approximately 25% together with the appearance of small amounts (approximately 1% of the amount perfused) of a metabolized form of human apolipoprotein B in bile. Acetylation of low density lipoprotein, a procedure that prevents this lipoprotein from binding to its receptor on hepatocytes, both abolished the appearance of immunoreactive apolipoprotein B in bile and blocked the increase in biliary cholesterol and phospholipid concentrations. Whereas the addition of a high density lipoprotein to solutions perfusing isolated livers of normal rats was associated with the appearance of small amounts (approximately 1% of the amount perfused) of apolipoproteins A-I and A-II in bile, there were no accompanying changes in the concentrations of biliary lipids. These results suggest that apolipoproteins or their fragments in bile are derived from circulating lipoproteins; in the case of apolipoprotein B, biliary excretion is dependent upon receptor-mediated uptake of low density lipoprotein by the hepatocyte. Our data are also consistent with the hypothesis that certain apolipoproteins may be involved in biliary lipid secretion, although in an as yet unclear manner.\r"

  ".W": "The metabolism of endogenous arachidonic acid P(AA) was investigated in activated neutrophils from 20 patients with Crohn's disease, 20 with ulcerative colitis, and 25 healthy volunteers. 1-14C-P(AA) was incorporated into intracellular pools of phospholipids prior to activation of the cells with ionophore A23187 and analyses of released arachidonic acid metabolites by thin layer chromatography. Total release of radioactivity expressing the release of arachidonic acid and its metabolites, was equal in the experimental and control groups, which suggests a normal substrate availability. In contrast, there was a marked increase in the relative release of leucotriene B4 (LTB4) and its omega-oxidation products, 20-hydroxy-LTB4 (20-OH-LTB4) and 20-carboxy-LTB4 (20-COOH-LTB4), with LTB4 values exceeding the reference interval in seven of 20 patients with Crohn's disease, median 8.7%, and in six of 20 patients with ulcerative colitis, median 7.7%, as compared with a median of 5.3% in healthy volunteers. Furthermore, a decreased release of unmetabolised arachidonic acid, correlating inversely with the release of LTB4 in all experimental and control groups, and normal values for the production of other metabolites of arachidonic acid--for example, 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (5-HETE) and 12-hydroxyheptadecatrienoic acid (HHT), point to an enzymatic abnormality such as increased activity of leucotriene B synthetase. An increased capacity for release of LTB4, the major pro-inflammatory metabolite of arachidonic acid lipoxygenation by polymorphonuclear leucocytes, may contribute to perpetuation of the inflammation and to tissue destruction in chronic inflammatory bowel disease.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Accumulating experimental evidence suggests that natriuresis in response to intravascular volume expansion is promoted by an endogenous regulator of Na+,K+-adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase). Efforts to purify this substance by a number of laboratories have as yet been unsuccessful. The properties of partially purified inhibitors from plasma, urine, and tissue often fail to possess the characteristics thought to be consistent with those of a physiological regulator. These include potency (Ki of approximately 1 nM), reversibility of inhibition, specificity for Na+,K+-ATPase, and responsiveness to relevant physiological stimuli. Two rather different candidate substances, extracted from urine and hypothalamus, have been purified to a high degree. Neither is a peptide, and both are of low molecular weight and resistant to acid hydrolysis. The substance from urine is rather nonpolar and interacts with digoxin-specific antibodies, while that from hypothalamus is polar and does not appear to share epitopes with the cardiac glycosides. On the serosal surface of the toad urinary bladder, the hypothalamic substance causes a reversible inhibition of Na+ transport, inhibits rubidium uptake in red blood cells by acting on the membrane's exterior surface, inhibits binding of ouabain to purified Na+,K+-ATPase, and reversibly inhibits hydrolysis of adenosine 5'-triphosphate by the enzyme with a Ki of 1.4 nM. The hypothalamic inhibitor may be differentiated from ouabain by their respective ionic requirements for optimal inhibition of enzymatic activity, and although both ouabain and the hypothalamic inhibitor fix Na+,K+-ATPase in its E2 conformation, the hypothalamic inhibitor does not promote phosphorylation of the enzyme by inorganic phosphate in the presence of Mg2+. Ionic requirements for inhibition also differentiate the hypothalamic inhibitor from vanadate ion, as does the inhibitor's activity in the presence of norepinephrine. Further enzymological and physiological studies will be facilitated by structural characterizations of the inhibitory substances and by the availability of a method to measure their concentrations in physiological fluids.\r"

Mean arterial pressure (as a percentage of control +/- SEM) during randomized infusions of 0.03, 0.1, 0.3, or 1.0 microgram/kg/min was 99 +/- 1, 95 +/- 1 (p less than 0.05), 93 +/- 1 (p less than 0.01), or 79 +/- 6% (p less than 0.001), respectively, but no tachycardia and no augmentation of the norepinephrine release rate (up to 0.3 microgram/kg/min) were observed, which is in contrast to comparable hypotension induced by hydralazine or nitroglycerin. The release rate of epinephrine (control, 6.7 +/- 0.6 ng/kg/min) declined immediately during infusions of atrial natriuretic factor to a minimum of 49 +/- 5% of control (p less than 0.001) during 0.1 microgram/kg/min and to 63 +/- 5% (0.1 greater than p greater than 0.05) or 95 +/- 13% (not significant) during 0.3 or 1.0 microgram/kg/min.

  ".W": "A condition of metabolic alkalosis has been generally observed in patients undergoing regular biofiltration (BF). The aim of this study was to assess buffer kinetics during a dialysis session in five patients regularly treated by BF for 10 months (dialyzer Biospal 3000S, Qb 301; Qd 545; UF 36.76 ml/min; dialysate CH3 COO 38 mEq/L; replacement fluid 1000 ml/h with HCO3 100 mEq/L solution). As usually happens using dialyzers with high surface area and permeability, large HCO3 losses (756 +/- 112 mEq) and CH3COO uptakes (677 +/- 152 mEq) were observed. Acetate plasma levels rose to 10.4 mEq/L, a value potentially dangerous to the cardiovascular system. The dialytic buffer gain (acetate uptake + HCO3 administered - HCO3 loss) was high (230 +/- 137 mEq/dialysis) and excessive for patients' needs. It is therefore very important to reduce either the acetate concentration in dialysate or the amount of reinfused bicarbonate. In view of the plasma acetate levels it is preferable to use a dialysis solution containing less acetate.\r"

Blood passing through the dialyzer lost 172.8 mM/h of CO2-T in AD, 149.2 mM/h in BF and gained 25.6 mM/h in BD. In AD VE, VA and PaO2 decreased significantly after 30 and 60 min., in BF for the whole duration of dialysis. PoO2 showed a significant decrease both in AD and BF after 60 min. In AD PaCO2 was significantly reduced after 120 and 180 min. All the above parameters remained unchanged in BD. VCO2 remained unchanged in all. VCO2 and R decreased both in AD and BF. However, when VCO2 was corrected for CO2 loss across the dialyzer, overall CO2 loss (ventilated plus filtered) and R returned to basal values. In AD, HCO-3 and pH fell in the first 120 min., while in BD and BF they increased from the beginning of dialysis. In AD hypoventilation, hypoxemia and inadequate correction of acid-base balance were due to the loss of HCO-3 across the filter. In BF also hypoventilation and hypoxemia were due to the loss of HCO-3 across the filter but the acid-base balance was adequately corrected by HCO-3 reinfusion. In BD, there was HCO-3 gain across the filter which induced a gradual correction of acid-base balance without impairment of ventilation.\r"

From analysis of the data it is concluded that the correction of AD-acidosis is very rapid during the early two months of BF, but the post-BF ABB may be too alkalotic, with risks if respiratory alkalosis is superimposed. After one year of BF, there were fewer pCO2 falls and pH variations; no more post-BF alkalotic rebounds were observed.\r"

  ".W": "Estimation of cardiac output by impedance cardiography (QZ) in exercise during normal breathing (NB) has been limited by motion artifact. Our objective was to obtain readable impedance cardiograms on five subjects during upright cycle exercise at 0, 50, 100, 150, and 200 W to permit comparisons of QZ during NB, expiratory breath hold (EXP) and inspiratory breath hold (INSP). Q was also determined using an equilibration CO2 rebreathing method [Q(RB)]. QZ during NB exceeded EXP QZ at 100, 150, and 200 W, and exceeded INSP QZ at 100 W (P less than 0.05). The low EXP QZ values were due to a significantly lower stroke volume at 100, 150, and 200 W (P less than 0.05). For the INSP QZ at 100 W, heart rate was lower than during EXP (P less than 0.05). Regression of QZ (NB) against Q(RB) resulted in a linear relationship (r = 0.93) over the range of Q = 7-26 1/min. The slope of the regression differed significantly from 1.0 (P less than 0.05). We conclude that QZ values obtained during EXP or INSP should not be assumed to represent QZ during NB, at least at work rates greater than 50 W. A consequence of the linear relationship between QZ(NB) and Q(RB) over the range of 0-200 W is that estimates of CO2 rebreathing cardiac output can be obtained by impedance cardiography if QZ is adjusted using an appropriate empirical factor.\r"

We measured pulmonary arterial and wedge pressures in all groups and cardiac output in the hydrostatic edema group. Postmortem, lobes were frozen at functional residual capacity and samples taken for measurements of extravascular lung water (Qwl/dQl) and for light microscopy. We also examined lobes from hydrostatic edema experiments fixed at transpulmonary pressures of 5 and 27 cmH2O. From the histology slides, bronchovascular bundles with respiratory bronchioles (n = 706) and bronchioles (n = 467) were photographed and airway and vessel areas and diameters measured. Alveolar and airway luminal edema were graded. We found that only in hydrostatic edema, pulmonary arterial and wedge pressures increased and vascular resistance fell with fluid infusion. Mean Qwl/dQl values were 3.80 +/- 0.17, 6.81 +/- 0.96, and 9.34 +/- 0.62 (SE) in control, hydrostatic, and increased permeability edema groups, respectively. By quantitative histology, airway and arterial areas and diameters did not decrease in edema and rose with increasing transpulmonary pressure. Variable quantities of air-space edema were seen. We conclude that interstitial edema does not compress small airways or arteries and that other mechanisms, including alveolar and airway luminal edema, may explain reported increases in airway resistance.\r"

However, the supporting data are inconclusive because the lipoxygenase and leukotriene receptor blockers that reduce hypoxic vasoconstriction (such as diethylcarbamazine and the FPL's) have confounding effects. We investigated BW 755C, a potent inhibitor of both lipoxygenase and cyclooxygenase, in eight intact anesthetized dogs with acute left lower lobe atelectasis. We examined two manifestations of hypoxic vasoconstriction: shunt fraction, as an inverse indicator of regional constriction in response to local hypoxia, and the pulmonary pressor response to global alveolar hypoxia, as an index of general hypoxic vasoconstriction. During normoxia, shunt fraction, measured using a sulfur hexafluoride infusion, was 32.0 +/- 7.0%. The pulmonary pressor response to hypoxia, defined as the increase in pulmonary end-diastolic gradient produced by 10% O2 inhalation, averaged 4.5 +/- 1.8 mmHg. Then, during normoxia, BW 755C was administered. Shunt fraction fell in all eight dogs from the previous mean of 32% to 25.5 +/- 6.1% (t = 6.5, P less than 0.0005). The hypoxic pressor response rose in all dogs, from the previous 4.5 mmHg to 9.0 +/- 3.5 mmHg (t = 4.5, P less than 0.005). BW 755C enhances hypoxic vasoconstriction, an effect consistent with its activity as a cyclooxygenase inhibitor. These data do not support a substantive role for the lipoxygenase pathway in hypoxic vasoconstriction.\r"

Mean slopes for linear ventilatory responses during loaded and unloaded exercise [change in minute ventilation per change in CO2 output (delta VE/delta VCO2)] measured below the anaerobic threshold were 24.1 +/- 1.3 (SE) = l/l of CO2 and 26.2 +/- 1.0 l/l of CO2, respectively (P greater than 0.10). During loaded exercise, decrements in VE, tidal volume, respiratory frequency, arterial O2 saturation, and increases in end-tidal CO2 tension were observed only when work loads exceeded 65% of the unloaded maximum. There was a significant correlation between the resting ventilatory response to hypercapnia delta VE/delta PCO2 and the ventilatory response to VCO2 during exercise (delta VE/delta VCO2; r = 0.88; P less than 0.05). The maximal inspiratory pressure generated during loading correlated with CO2 sensitivity at rest (r = 0.91; P less than 0.05) and with exercise ventilation (delta VE/delta VCO2; r = 0.83; P less than 0.05). Although resistive loading did not alter O2 uptake (VO2) or heart rate (HR) as a function of work load, maximal VO2, HR, and exercise tolerance were decreased to 90% of control values. We conclude that a modest inspiratory resistive load reduces maximum exercise capacity and that CO2 responsiveness may play a role in the control of breathing during exercise when airway resistance is artificially increased.\r"

Five healthy ponies exercised for 8 min at two work rates: 50 m/min 6% grade and 70 m/min 12% grade. PaCO2 decreased (P less than 0.05) below resting values within 1 min after commencement of exercise at both work rates and reached a nadir at 90 s. PaCO2 decreased maximally by 2.5 and 3.5 Torr at the low and moderate rate, respectively. After the nadir, PaCO2 increased across time during both work rates and reached values that were not significantly different (P greater than 0.05) from rest at minute 4 of exercise. Partial pressure of O2 in arterial blood and arterial pH reflected hyperventilation during the first 3 min of exercise. At the termination of exercise PaCO2 increased (1.5 Torr) above rest (P less than 0.05), reaching a zenith at 2-3 min of recovery. These data suggest that VA and CO2 flow to the lung are not tightly matched at the onset and offset of exercise in the pony and thus challenges the traditional concept of blood gas homeostasis during muscular exercise.\r"

  ".W": "In prior studies at high altitude, we have found that pregnancy increases maternal hypoxic ventilatory response (HVR) but the factors responsible are unknown. Changes in metabolic rate and hormones that occur during pregnancy have previously been shown to influence HVR. We therefore sought to determine the contribution of metabolic rate and hormonal changes to the pregnancy-associated rise in HVR. Pregnancy increased HVR in each of 20 normal, low-altitude (1,600 m) residents. As measured by the shape parameter A, HVR at week 36 was 237 +/- 26 (SE) or twofold higher than the 124 +/- 13 value measured 3 mo postpartum (P less than 0.01) despite the presence of the potentially depressant effects of hypocapnia [change in alveolar partial pressure of CO2 (delta PACO2) = -4 +/- 1 mmHg] and alkalosis [change in arterial pH (delta pHa) = 0.02 +/- 0.01 U] during pregnancy. Sixty percent of the increase in HVR values had occurred by week 20 of gestation at which time O2 consumption (VO2) and CO2 production (VCO2) were unchanged relative to values measured postpartum. The remaining 40% rise in HVR paralleled increases in VO2 and VCO2, and further elevation in VO2 and VCO2 with moderate exercise produced an additional increase in HVR. Serum estradiol and progesterone levels increased with pregnancy, but levels did not correlate with HVR. The women reporting the greatest symptoms of dyspnea had higher HVR A values at week 36 than the least dyspneic women (285 +/- 28 vs. 178 +/- 34, respectively, P less than 0.05). We concluded that factors intrinsic to pregnancy in combination with increased metabolic rate raised HVR twofold with pregnancy and may have contributed to the often-reported symptoms of dyspnea in pregnant women.\r"

Although the concentration of these metabolites required to have effects is several orders of magnitude greater than the concentration of these mediators in the blood, it has been postulated that local concentrations within tissues are much higher. In a direct test of this hypothesis, the concentrations of the cyclooxygenase products of arachidonic acid including prostaglandin (PG) E, PGF2 alpha, 6-keto-PGF1 alpha, and thromboxane B2, were measured in a specialized tissue compartment, the epithelial surface of the lower respiratory tract. The concentration of these mediators within this compartment was 50- to 80-fold greater than concurrent blood levels and are sufficient to likely have physiological effects. Thus the epithelial surface of the lower respiratory tract represents a specialized compartment with high local levels of cyclooxygenase products of arachidonic acid.\r"

  ".W": "Laryngeal hemiplegia increases the respiratory effort required during exercise. By use of 15-micron-diam radionuclide-labeled microspheres, respiratory muscle blood flows were studied at rest, submaximal exercise (SE), maximal exercise (ME), and ME + adenosine (3 mumol X kg-1 X min-1) in nine healthy laryngeal hemiplegic (LH) ponies to ascertain whether vasodilator reserve in these tissues may be exhausted during SE, which caused maximal respiratory frequency (f) to be reached. Blood flows were also studied in the limb muscles, and data were compared with normal ponies (M. Manohar, J. Appl. Physiol. 60: 1571-1577, 1986). The heart rate, f, and change in pleural pressure in LH ponies during SE were 205 +/- 5 beats/min, 91 +/- 10 breaths/min, and 61.2 +/- 8.7 cmH2O. Corresponding values for ME were 223 +/- 2 beats/min, 90 +/- 7 breaths/min, and 75.1 +/- 5.2 cmH2O. The treadmill speed for SE was set at 75% of that for ME. Mean aortic pressure (161 +/- 9 mmHg), diaphragmatic (206 +/- 27 ml X min-1 X 100 g-1), and intercostal muscle (124 +/- 12 ml X min-1 X 100 g-1) blood flows in LH ponies increased markedly with SE and these values were not different from ME (170 +/- 5 mmHg, 293 +/- 40 ml X min-1 X 100 g-1, 167 +/- 15 ml X min-1 X 100 g-1, respectively). This suggested that maximal vasodilation in the respiratory muscles was achieved during SE. Vascular resistance in the diaphragm and intercostal muscles of LH ponies also remained similar for SE, ME, and ME + adenosine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Anesthetized adult males (Sprague-Dawley, 400-500 g) were treated then killed at specific intervals with respect to the 13-day cycle of the seminiferous epithelium. PM MWR at 7.7 mW/g (90 min) yielded a modest decline in daily sperm production (DSP) that derived primarily from effects on primary spermatocytes. PM MWR at 4.2 mW/g was ineffective. The mean intratesticular temperature during the former reached 40 degrees C and did not exceed 38 degrees C during the latter. MWR considerably in excess of 7.7 mW/g yielded decrements in virtually all germ cell types, with primary spermatocytes again being most markedly affected. Using conventional heating, intratesticular temperatures in excess of 39 degrees C for 60 min were required for significant decrements in DSP. Levels of circulating follicle-stimulating hormone and of leutinizing hormone were resistant to either treatment. We conclude that the damage threshold and the differential sensitivity of immature germ cells to PM MWR can be adequately explained by the consequent macroscopic heating.\r"

During inspiration the onset and peak increase in volume into the upper airway preceded the onset and peak of inspiratory tidal volume by 84 +/- 8 and 638 +/- 47 ms, respectively. The volume cycle of the upper airway was nearly complete by the end of inspiratory airflow into the thorax. With progressive hypercapnia there was an increase in the change in both upper airway volume and tidal volume but the temporal sequence was preserved. End-expiratory tracheal occlusion increased the volume change in the isolated upper airway at any level of CO2; however, the effect was disproportionately greater at low rather than at high levels of CO2. Following hyperventilation-induced apnea, a change in volume in the upper airway and thorax occurred on the first inspiratory effort. In most animals at lower levels of CO2, the percent change in upper airway volume with inspiration was relatively less than tidal volume, but the reverse was true at higher levels of CO2. These differences represent dissimilarities in the mechanical forces occurring as the result of upper airway and chest wall muscle contraction during inspiration.\r"

Before and after aerosols of methacholine, diaphragm, parasternal intercostal, internal intercostal, and external oblique electromyograms were recorded during 100% O2 breathing and CO2 rebreathing. While breathing 100% O2, five dogs showed prolonged electrical activity of the diaphragm and parasternal intercostals in early expiration, postinspiratory inspiratory activity (PIIA). Aerosols of methacholine increased pulmonary resistance, decreased tidal volume, and elevated arterial PCO2. During bronchoconstriction, when PCO2 was varied by CO2 rebreathing, PIIA was shorter at low levels of PCO2, and external oblique and internal intercostal were higher at all levels of PCO2. Vagotomy shortened PIIA in dogs with prolonged PIIA. After vagotomy, methacholine had no effects on PIIA but continued to increase external oblique and internal intercostal activity at all levels of PCO2. These findings indicate that bronchoconstriction influences PIIA through a vagal reflex but augments expiratory activity, at least in part, by extravagal mechanisms.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to describe the distribution and activity pattern of respiratory neurons located in the ventrolateral medulla (VLM) of the dog. Spike activity of 129 respiratory neurons was recorded in 23 ketamine-anesthetized spontaneously breathing dogs. Pontamine blue dye was used to mark the location of each neuron. Most VLM neurons displaying respiratory related spike patterns were located in a column related closely to ambigual and retroambigual nuclei. Both inspiratory and expiratory neurons were present with inspiratory units being grouped more rostrally. The predominant inspiratory neuron firing pattern was \"late\" inspiratory, although eight \"early\" types were located. All expiratory firing patterns were the late expiratory variety. Each neuron burst pattern was characterized by determining burst duration (BD), spikes per burst (S/B), peak frequency (PF), time to peak frequency (TPF), rate of rise to peak frequency (PF/TPF), and mean frequency. CO2-induced minute ventilation increases were associated with decreases in BD and TPF and increases in PF, S/B, and PF/TPF. In 11 experiments the relative influences of vagotomy and tracheal occlusion on late inspiratory units were compared. Tracheal occlusion increased late inspiratory BD and S/B but did not alter PF/TPF. Vagotomy increased BD and S/B beyond those obtained by tracheal occlusion and, in some neurons, decreased the PF/TPF. We conclude that the location of respiratory units in the VLM of the dog is similar to that in other species, the discharge pattern of VLM respiratory units is similar to those in cat VLM, and vagotomy and tracheal occlusion affect discharge patterns differently.\r"

Respiratory mechanics were studied after end-inspiratory occlusions. Zero frequency resistance (Rmax), infinite frequency resistance (Rmin), and static elastance (Est) were calculated for the respiratory system, lung, and chest wall. Alveolar ventilation was manipulated by the addition of dead space to achieve a range of PaCO2 values of 29.3-87.3 mmHg. Cats did not become hypoxic during the experiment. Under control conditions marked frequency dependence in Rmax, Rmin, and Est of the respiratory system, lungs, and chest wall was demonstrated. The chest wall contributed 50% of the total resistance of the respiratory system. With increasing PaCO2 the only resistance observed to increase was Rmax of the lung (P less than 0.01). There were also no changes in the static elastic properties of either the lungs or the chest wall. These results suggest that hypercapnia increases resistance by changes in the lung periphery and not in the conducting airways.\r"

The time course of development of lung injury was assessed by the clearance of 99mTc-diethylenetriamine pentaacetate (99mTcDTPA) from the lung into the blood, the pharmacokinetics of tritiated prostaglandin E2 [( 3H]PGE2) in the isolated perfused lung, and by increase in the weight ratio (wet-to-dry) of lung. Two hours after ANTU administration, the clearance of 99mTcDTPA was significantly faster than in untreated animals and implied an increase in permeability of the alveolar-capillary barrier. This change preceded the increase in wet-to-dry weight ratio of lung, which was not significant until 5 h after ANTU administration. The pharmacokinetics of [3H]PGE2 were significantly altered after ANTU and these changes persisted beyond the time when both lung weight ratio and 99mTcDTPA clearance had recovered to normal values. We conclude that both 99mTcDTPA clearance and PGE2 pharmacokinetics change in ANTU-induced lung injury but with different time courses. In the progressive phase of lung injury due to ANTU, the early change in clearance of 99mTcDTPA suggests that an increased permeation of the alveolar capillary barrier by this small molecule precedes pulmonary edema due to an increased colloid permeability of the barrier. Abnormal metabolism in the pulmonary microvasculature persists when the permeability defect and edema have recovered.\r"

The distal tips of the insufflation catheters were positioned 0.5, 2.0, 3.5, and 5.0 cm from the tracheal carina. Flow rates were varied between 10 and 55 l/min and steady-state arterial blood gases were measured. At a given flow rate, arterial CO2 pressure (PaCO2) decreased as CFV was administered further into the lung up to a distance of 3.5 cm from the carina; there were no significant differences in PaCO2 at 3.5 and 5.0 cm. For a given catheter position, PaCO2 decreased with increasing flow rate up to a flow rate of 40 l/min. Further increases in flow rate had no significant effect on PaCO2. Arterial O2 pressure (PaO2) was relatively constant at all flow rates and catheter positions. We conclude that, up to a point, CO2 elimination can be improved by positioning the catheters further into the lung; advancing the catheters further than 3.5 cm from the carina may cause over-ventilation of specific lung regions resulting in a relative plateau in CO2 elimination and relatively constant PaO2's. Positioning the catheters further into the lung permits the use of lower flow rates, thus potentially minimizing the risk of barotrauma.\r"

After treatment with indomethacin (5 mg/kg), the response was significantly attenuated; Rcs increased only 40 +/- 8%. Bronchoalveolar lavage performed 5 min after a dry air challenge yielded fluid with greater concentrations of prostaglandin D2 (PGD2) and thromboxane B2 than samples from unchallenged segments. Challenge with humidified air produced a smaller physiological response than did challenge with dry air. Lavage samples obtained after dry challenge had greater concentrations of PGD2 than samples taken after challenge with humidified air. After dry air challenge, epithelial cells in lavage fluid were increased by 454 and 515% when compared with control and humidified air challenge, respectively. Significant correlations were found between epithelial cell number and PGD2 recovered in lavage fluid after dry air challenges. We conclude that both epithelial cells and prostaglandins play an important role in peripheral lung responses to dry air.\r"

None of the group II patients demonstrated lavage fluid collagenase. Treatment of lavage fluid with trypsin failed to uncover latent collagenase activity in either group, suggesting that the collagenase is present entirely in an active form.

We examined the changes in breathing pattern during hypoxic exposures lasting minutes, hours, and days using data from previous studies. Increased tidal volume accounted for the increased ventilation during 7-10 and 30 min of isocapnic and poikilocapnic (no CO2 added) hypoxic exposures as well as during 7 h of poikilocapnic hypobaric hypoxia (4,800 m). Tidal volume was also a greater overall contributor than frequency to increased ventilation in sea-level residents during 3 days of isocapnic hypobaric hypoxia (4,100-4,600 m) and in Denver (1,600 m) residents during 5 days on Pikes Peak (4,300 m). In sea-level residents during 3 days of poikilocapnic hypobaric hypoxia (3,600-4,300 m) and during 7-8 days on Pikes Peak, increased frequency accounted for the rise in ventilation. Tidal volume thus contributed more than frequency to increasing ventilation during brief hypoxia, whereas the contribution of frequency was increased in prolonged hypoxia involving a 4,300-m altitude ascent and hypocapnia.\r"

In 20 experiments in six pregnant sheep (130-145 days gestation) hypercapnia was induced by giving the ewe 4-6% CO2-18% O2 in N2 to breathe for 60 min. After 30 min of hypercapnia either naloxone (13 experiments) or saline (7 experiments) was infused intravenously for the remaining 30 min. During hypercapnia breath amplitude increased from 5.8 +/- 0.5 to 9.1 +/- 1.2 mmHg (P less than 0.001), and infusion of naloxone was associated with a further significant increase to 15.7 +/- 1.2 mmHg (P less than 0.001). Naloxone had no effect on the incidence or rate of breathing movements during hypercapnia. After hypercapnia there was a significant decrease in the incidence of fetal breathing movements in the naloxone group (14.7 +/- 3.2%). Infusion of saline during hypercapnia had no effect on incidence, rate, or amplitude of fetal breathing movements. These results suggest that endogenous opioids act to suppress or limit breath amplitude during hypercapnia but do not affect rate or incidence of breathing movements.\r"

Diaphragmatic force output was assessed by analysis of the transdiaphragmatic pressure (Pdi) generated during phrenic nerve stimulation. Pdi was measured under base-line conditions (50% O2-50% N2) and after 10 min of hypercapnia induced by breathing 5, 10, or 15% CO2 balanced with N2 and 50% O2. Pdi was significantly less than base line during the 10 and 15% hypercapnic conditions in the young (P less than 0.05) but not the older piglets. End-expiratory lung volume was noted to decrease during 15% CO2 hypercapnia. Force output augmentation occurred at this lower end-expiratory lung volume and was significantly greater in the older piglet compared with its younger counterpart (P less than 0.05). When the effects of lung volume on Pdi were corrected for, there was no age-related difference in the response to 15% CO2 hypercapnia. We conclude that severe hypercapnia has a depressant effect on diaphragmatic force output in both young and older piglets, and a differential augmentation in diaphragmatic force-output gain occurs at lower end-expiratory lung volume between young and older piglets, with the greater output occurring in the more mature animal.\r"

Possibly blocking the proliferation might block the pulmonary hypertension, providing insight into its mechanism. Because heparin, given as an antiproliferative agent, reduced hypoxic pulmonary hypertension in mice, it might also block monocrotaline-induced pulmonary hypertension. Alternatively, anticoagulation could worsen the lung injury. We found that heparin (300 and 600 U/kg sc twice daily) inhibited clotting in rats given monocrotaline but did not change the vascular leak, the right ventricular pressure, the right ventricular hypertrophy, the increased medial thickness of the pulmonary arterioles, or the production of a slow-reacting substance of anaphylaxis-like material by the lungs. A nonanticoagulant heparin fragment (2 mg/kg sc twice daily), given to avoid anticoagulation also did not influence the monocrotaline injury. Thus neither anticoagulant nor nonanticoagulant heparin either attenuated or worsened the measured effects of monocrotaline.\r"

  ".W": "The delay between air flow and gas concentration signals is generally assumed to be constant within a breath as well as from breath to breath, but it was not possible to examine the constancy of the delay with the delay determination techniques so far available. Thus we developed new methods for respiratory phase detection and delay determination. The presented algorithm for the detection of the start of inspiration and expiration (phase detection) replaces the generally used valve assembly with two pneumotachographs. Now, the pneumotachograph is used in a bidirectional mode, but with a volume criterion for phase detection replacing the less reliable threshold criterion. To measure the delay between flow and gas concentration signals, a test gas is periodically injected as a marker. This test gas contains less N2 than ambient air. Therefore, the delay is determined as time between the moment of injection and the drop of N2. These two methods rendered it possible to examine delay variations and their consequences. The investigation of various breathing patterns demonstrated that the usually assumed errors caused by delay uncertainty are underestimated. We suggest reliance on a breath-by-breath delay determination to account for delay variations.\r"

  ".W": "Receptors for CRH were identified in the pituitary gland of several primate species, and their binding characteristics were compared to the ability of CRH to elicit ACTH and cAMP responses in vitro. Autoradiographic analysis of the binding of [125I]Tyr-ovine CRH to frozen pituitary sections revealed CRH receptors in the intermediate and anterior lobes of human, marmoset, and cynomolgus monkey pituitaries. In the cynomolgus monkey, a high density of CRH receptors was present throughout the anterior and intermediate lobes. In the human pituitary, binding was concentrated in the anteromedial portion of the gland, whereas in the marmoset, binding was dense in the intermediate lobe and scattered as clusters throughout the anterior lobe. In membrane-rich fractions from the cynomolgus pituitary binding of [125I]Tyr-ovine CRH was time and temperature dependent, and was specific for CRH-related peptides; specific binding was increased by divalent cations and inhibited by guanyl nucleotides. Scatchard analyses of the binding data revealed a single class of high affinity sites [Kd, 1.93 +/- 0.23 (+/- SEM) nM], with a receptor concentration of 605 +/- 121 fmol/mg. In marmoset pituitary membranes, there were fewer receptors (200 +/- 15 fmol/mg), in agreement with the lower autoradiographic density of CRH binding. In anterior pituitary cell cultures from cynomolgus monkeys, CRH caused a dose-dependent stimulation of cAMP production and ACTH release, with half-maximum effective concentrations in the range of the CRH receptor affinity. Vasopressin and norepinephrine stimulated ACTH release to a much lesser extent, but both potentiated the stimulatory effect of CRH. Angiotensin II had no effect alone, but it also potentiated the effect of CRH. These data demonstrate the presence of CRH receptors in the primate pituitary, with characteristics similar to those in other species in their binding properties, coupling to adenylate cyclase, and functional interactions with other regulators of ACTH secretion that mediate the stimulatory effect of the peptide in the corticotroph.\r"

While all 14 women had normal glucose tolerance, the PCOD women had significantly higher mean plasma glucose levels at 30 and 60 min and higher mean incremental glucose areas [incremental areas: PCOD, 9.0 +/- 2.2 (+/- SEM); normal women, 4.0 +/- 0.8 mmol/L; P less than 0.05]. Insulin responses were significantly higher in the PCOD compared to normal women (incremental areas: PCOD, 623.8 +/- 78.3; normal women, 226.2 +/- 30.3 microU/mL; P less than 0.001). Both serum testosterone and androstenedione levels correlated with the insulin areas (r = 0.82; P less than 0.001 and r = 0.86; P less than 0.001, respectively). [125I] Insulin binding to erythrocytes revealed decreased maximum specific binding in the PCOD women (6.9 +/- 0.6%) compared to that in normal women (9.2 +/- 0.7%; P less than 0.02). While Scatchard analysis revealed similar receptor numbers, ID50 values demonstrated decreased receptor affinity in the women with PCOD. In conclusion, in the absence of acanthosis nigricans, nonobese patients with PCOD are insulin resistant, and this insulin resistance correlates with the hyperandrogenism.\r"

  ".W": "The ability of prolonged administration of a LHRH antagonist, [Ac-delta 3Pro1,4F-D-Phe2,D-Trp3,6]LHRH (4F-antagonist), to suppress serum gonadotropin and testosterone levels was studied in normal men. The 4F-antagonist was given either as a continuous 13.3 micrograms/kg X h sc infusion for 72 h or as intermittent sc injections of 100 micrograms/kg every 6 h for 7 days. Serum FSH, LH, and testosterone levels decreased in the period immediately following initiation of 4F-antagonist administration. However, an escape toward baseline levels for each of these hormones occurred during prolonged antagonist administration. When men receiving the continuous infusion were challenged with iv bolus doses of 50 micrograms LHRH, the response of LH after the first 12 h of 4F-antagonist administration was similar to that before its administration. This gonadotropin and testosterone escape suggests that, at the doses used, the inhibitory action of the antagonist on gonadotropin secretion is progressively lost. The initial decrease in androgen levels could serve to augment endogenous LHRH release, which, in turn, overcomes the pituitary effects of the antagonist, or to augment endogenous LH secretion directly. These results demonstrate that the pituitary can escape from the suppressive effects of prolonged LHRH antagonist administration and partially restore serum gonadotropin and testosterone levels to normal in man.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of increasing donor age on the susceptibility of human red blood cell Ca2+-ATPase activity to stimulation in vitro by thyroid hormone was studied in 26 normal subjects, aged 15-81 yr. Basal enzyme activity (no added thyroid hormone) was unaffected by donor age. Group analysis, young (less than or equal to 50 yr) vs. elderly (greater than 60 yr old), revealed a 23% decrease in responsiveness of the enzyme to L-T4 (P less than 0.001). Regression analysis confirmed an age-dependent decline in thyroid hormone stimulability of Ca2+-ATPase [r = -0.42 (T4 effect) and -0.38 (T3 effect); P less than 0.01]. Red cell membrane Na,K-ATPase activity was not affected by donor age. Plasma T4 and T3 concentrations in these normal subjects also did not change with age. Possible contributions of the following mechanisms to this age-correlated change in enzyme activity were examined: altered responsiveness to calmodulin of membrane Ca2+-ATPase; membrane content of endogenous calmodulin, endogenous plasma T4 and T3 concentrations, and plasma glucose concentrations. Calmodulin responsiveness is required for iodothyronine action on the enzyme, but the calmodulin responsiveness of cells from elderly donors was not significantly different from that of cells from younger donors (P greater than 0.10). There was no relationship between membrane immunoassayable calmodulin and donor age or membrane calmodulin and Ca2+-ATPase activity. There were positive correlations between donor plasma T4 level and basal enzyme activity (P less than 0.05) and between donor plasma T3 concentration and hormone-responsive Ca2+-ATPase (P less than 0.01), but these did not contribute to the age effect. Plasma glucose previously was found to modulate red cell Ca2+-ATPase activity, but did not correlate with decreased hormone responsiveness of the enzyme in elderly donors. In conclusion, we found that the susceptibility of human red cell Ca2+-ATPase to in vitro thyroid hormone stimulation declined significantly with advancing donor age. Several possible calmodulin-dependent mechanisms for this age-dependent change were excluded, and thus, we postulate that the altered hormone sensitivity of the enzyme is membrane phospholipid mediated.\r"

  ".W": "LHRH antagonists compete with endogenous LHRH for binding to receptors on pituitary gonadotrophs and thereby inhibit gonadal function by suppressing gonadotropin secretion. We studied the effects of a recently developed LHRH antagonist on the pituitary-gonadal axis in man. The antagonist Detirelix [( N-Ac-D-Nal(2)1, D-pCl-Phe2,D-Trp3, D-hArg(Et2)6, D-Ala10]LHRH) was given as a single sc injection to nine normal men at three dose levels (5, 10, and 20 mg) at intervals of at least 7 days. Serum FSH, LH, and testosterone levels were measured before treatment, at frequent intervals for 48 h, and 72, 96, and 168 h after administration of the antagonist. Mean serum FSH levels decreased (P less than 0.001) from 6.9 +/- 0.5 (+/- SEM) mIU/mL to nadirs of 4.4 +/- 1.1, 3.6 +/- 0.9, and 4.1 +/- 0.9 after the 5-, 10-, and 20-mg doses, respectively. Serum LH levels decreased (P less than 0.001) from 6.2 +/- 0.3 mIU/mL to nadirs of 3.3 +/- 0.4, 2.8 +/- 0.3, and 2.7 +/- 0.3 after all three doses. Serum testosterone levels decreased (P less than 0.001) in a dose-dependent fashion from 5.1 +/- 0.2 ng/mL to nadirs of 1.3 +/- 0.3, 0.9 +/- 0.3, and 0.6 +/- 0.1 after the same doses. After the initial testosterone decrease, however, escape occurred 12-28 h after the lower doses. The area under the response curve, describing hormone concentrations as a function of time during the study, diminished by 23 +/- 2%, 36 +/- 4%, and 36 +/- 3% for FSH, by 14 +/- 6%, 30% +/- 6%, and 34 +/- 5% for LH, and by 41 +/- 5%, 58 +/- 6%, and 68 +/- 4% for testosterone with the same doses, respectively. The apparent plasma disappearance half-life of Detirelix by RIA was at least 41 h after all three doses. Detirelix elicited only a minor local reaction; no systemic side-effects were observed within the dose range used. These results indicate that this LHRH antagonist is a safe, highly potent inhibitor of the human pituitary-gonadal axis with an exceptionally long duration of action.\r"

This study was undertaken to determine the effect of IFN gamma on the response of human thyrocytes to TSH stimulation and the relationship between the response to TSH and the expression of DR antigen induced by IFN gamma, using monolayer cultures of Graves' thyrocytes. When confluent thyrocyte monolayers were incubated with TSH or Bu2cAMP (DBcAMP) for 7-9 days, T3 and thyroglobulin concentrations in the culture medium increased gradually in a dose-dependent manner. However, when TSH or DBcAMP was added after the cells had been cultured for 4 days with IFN gamma, T3 and thyroglobulin secretion in response to both 10 mU/mL TSH and 1 mM DBcAMP was significantly inhibited. The inhibition by IFN gamma was dose dependent and correlated with the number of DR antigen-positive thyrocytes present on the last day of culture. IFN alpha and -beta did not affect the response of thyrocytes to TSH or DBcAMP stimulation. These results suggest that DR antigen-positive thyrocytes fail to respond to TSH stimulation at a site located distal to cAMP formation.\r"

  ".W": "To assess the dynamics of the suppression and recovery of plasma gonadotropins and sex steroids during and after inhibition of pituitary-ovarian function by a long-acting agonist GnRH-analog (GnRH-A), eight patients with polycystic ovarian disease were treated with 12 micrograms/kg X day GnRH-A for 56 consecutive days. In response to GnRH-A, these patients had a sharp and pronounced decline of their initially elevated immunoreactive LH and bioactive LH (bioLH) levels. Plasma immunoreactive FSH levels declined more rapidly than did bioLH, but the FSH decline was less sustained. Plasma testosterone, androstenedione, and estrone (E1) levels also declined during GnRH-A administration. The pattern of plasma androgen decrease resembled that of bioLH. There was a positive correlation between bioLH and the two androgens (r = 0.85; P less than 0.05, by Spearman's rank correlation, for both hormones). Cessation of GnRH-A administration was followed by prompt progressive increases in gonadotropin and androgen concentrations to pretreatment values. FSH recovered faster than bioLH. BioLH plasma concentrations reached pretreatment values by day 28. The recovery of plasma androstenedione and testosterone levels correlated positively with that of bioLH. Although plasma E1 levels were higher during the recovery period than during treatment, they never reached the concentrations found during the basal period, whereas estradiol concentrations were slightly but not significantly higher than those in the basal period. As a consequence, the E1 to estradiol ratio, very high in the basal period, approximated unity during recovery. These data indicate that hyperandrogenism in polycystic ovarian disease is gonadotropin dependent and accompanied by a relative abundance of LH bioactivity basally and during GnRH-A administration. Thus, the relative increase in bioLH secretion appears to be independent of the rate of gonadotropin secretion and the circulating sex steroid concentrations.\r"

A subset of pregnant mice developed overwhelming placental listeria infections. Pregnancy did not impair the maternal immune response in the liver and spleen. Pregnant mice without placental infection had numbers of listeria equivalent to nonpregnant controls and mice immunized during pregnancy had significantly less listeria than nonimmunized controls. The secondary response in immunized pregnant mice had no effect on the development of placental infection and the histologic features of placental infection were distinct from those in other organs. Our data suggest that an ineffective local immune response may contribute to the pathogenicity of listeria for the placenta.\r"

The collagen content of the capsules was estimated by hydroxyproline analysis of the tissue and by quantitative electron microscopy of collagen bundles. Heat-inactivated rMuIFN-gamma failed to reduce the fibrotic response in this assay.

  ".W": "Phosphoinositide hydrolysis in platelets stimulated by thrombin is thought to be regulated by a pertussis toxin-sensitive guanine nucleotide binding protein (G protein) referred to as Gp. The present studies examine the role of Gp in platelet responses to the thromboxane A2 analogue U46619 and in the pathway by which the phosphoinositide hydrolysis product inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3) causes secretion. In permeabilized platelets, U46619 caused phosphatidic acid formation and secretion, which were abolished by the G protein inhibitor, guanosine 5'-O-(2-thiophosphate) (GDP beta S). Unlike thrombin, however, U46619-induced phosphoinositide hydrolysis was unaffected by pertussis toxin, and U46619 was unable to inhibit the [32P]ADP ribosylation of the 42-kD pertussis toxin substrate in platelets. IP3-induced secretion, which is known to depend upon intracellular Ca release and subsequent arachidonic acid metabolism, was also inhibited by GDP beta S, as was Ca-induced secretion. These observations suggest that platelet thromboxane A2 (TxA2) receptors are coupled to a toxin-resistant form of Gp distinct from the one that is coupled to thrombin receptors, and that TxA2-stimulated phosphoinositide hydrolysis may serve as a feedback mechanism by which stimuli for arachidonic acid release, such as IP3 and Ca, amplify responses to agonists.\r"

  ".U": "87167150\r", 
  ".W": "In acute myocardial infarction, myocardial salvage is dependent on rapid restoration of blood flow. Pharmacologic (streptokinase, recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator), mechanical (percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, guide wire perforation) or combined forms of reperfusion therapy can accomplish this goal, but their effects on infarcted myocardium and vessel occlusion site have not been compared at necropsy. The heart of 19 necropsy patients who had received various forms of acute reperfusion therapy was studied: 14 had pharmacologic or combined forms of reperfusion therapy (13 streptokinase and 1 tissue-type plasminogen activator, including 4 with combined balloon angioplasty) and 5 had had purely mechanical (balloon angioplasty) reperfusion therapy. Reperfusion was initially clinically successful in all 19 patients with the average time from onset of symptoms to reperfusion being 3.7 hours. Necropsy observations separated the 19 patients into distinct subgroups based on changes in the myocardium and infarct-related coronary arteries. Of the 19 patients, 14 (74%) had hemorrhagic myocardial infarction and they all received pharmacologic or combined forms of reperfusion therapy. The remaining five patients (26%) had nonhemorrhagic (anemic) infarction and were treated with balloon angioplasty therapy alone. Increased luminal cross-sectional area was present in 8 of 9 patients with acute balloon angioplasty but severe coronary atherosclerotic plaque remained in 9 of 10 patients without acute balloon angioplasty. Severe hemorrhage surrounded angioplasty sites in all four patients who also received streptokinase or tissue-type plasminogen activator. Severe bleeding at the angioplasty site compromised the dilated coronary lumen in one patient. No patient with angioplasty alone had intraplaque bleeding. Thus, acute coronary balloon angioplasty reperfusion therapy alone appears to avoid the potentially adverse effects of myocardial and intraplaque hemorrhage while simultaneously increasing luminal cross-sectional area at the site of acute occlusion.\r"

Investigations of hemodynamic effects of transdermal nitroglycerin in patients with heart failure have demonstrated a transient reduction in pressure lasting less than the expected 24 hours. These findings could be due to the development of circulatory tolerance to the vasodilatory effects of nitroglycerin or to insufficient drug dosing. In the present study, we compared the hemodynamic effects of the first and the second doses of high dose (120 mg) transdermal nitroglycerin given 24 hours apart in 11 responders (greater than or equal to 20% reduction in mean pulmonary artery wedge pressure lasting greater than or equal to 2 hours). Initiation of nitroglycerin therapy resulted in a significant reduction in mean right atrial pressure lasting for 14 hours and in a reduction in mean pulmonary artery and mean pulmonary artery wedge pressures lasting 24 hours. After administration of the second dose, mean right atrial pressure at 2 hours (9 +/- 5 versus 7 +/- 4 mm Hg), 4 hours (8 +/- 5 versus 6 +/- 4 mm Hg) and 8 hours (8 +/- 5 versus 6 +/- 3 mm Hg) was higher than after the first dose (p less than 0.05). Both mean pulmonary artery and mean pulmonary artery wedge pressures were significantly higher after the second nitroglycerin dose.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "This review illustrates the use of computer-based Markov models to estimate cost-effectiveness and prognosis in a complex problem in clinical cardiology. Decision analysis and cost-effectiveness analysis were used to assess whether to implant a permanent cardiac pacemaker, treat with drugs, perform electrophysiologic studies or observe patients who have two clinical features--syncope and bifascicular block--that may or may not be causally related. Using a Markov process model, a computer program simulated the prognosis of five cohorts of such patients--one treated conservatively, one given empiric antiarrhythmic drug therapy, one receiving a pacemaker, one treated with empiric drugs and pacing and one tested with electrophysiologic studies. On the basis of data from published reports and expert opinion, quality-adjusted life expectancy was calculated by summing the average time a member of each cohort would survive with and without symptoms for each initial treatment choice. The costs were estimated from 1985 hospital charges. For patients with normal left ventricular function, electrophysiologic testing provides a benefit of 14 quality-adjusted months of life over observation, at an additional cost of $24,200. Empiric pacing would add 2.5 additional months, at a further cost of $14,300. In patients with poor left ventricular function, empiric drug therapy offers 1.5 additional quality-adjusted months over observation, at a cost of $6,900. Electrophysiologic testing provides a further 16.5 months at an additional cost of $16,900. These results hold when the relation between symptoms and arrhythmia is not firmly established. Varying the probabilities of underlying ventricular tachyarrhythmias, bradyarrhythmic conduction defects or noncardiac causes of syncope affects the cost-effectiveness relative to the alternative treatments.\r"

Because of the damaging effects of liver failure on other organ systems, transplant candidates frequently suffer from moderate to severe malnutrition. Chronic hepatic failure can result in deranged metabolism of not only macronutrients and micronutrients but also various hormones. Patients are frequently in a catabolic state. Wasting of the skeletal muscle mass occurs and synthesis of secretory proteins and clotting factors decreases. Hepatic encephalopathy and fluid/electrolyte imbalances often complicate the provision of appropriate nutrition support. Nutrition support may be provided by the oral route, tube feeding, parenteral nutrition, or a combination of those routes. A multidisciplinary approach to determine the appropriate nutrition support regimen is most optimal. To assess the efficacy of the support, monitoring of the nutritional/metabolic status is necessary on an ongoing basis. An aggressive nutrition support regimen can induce positive nitrogen balance, promote hepatic protein synthesis, and expand lean body mass, controlling the symptoms of malnutrition in end-stage liver disease.\r"

Quantitative scintigraphic studies with Tc-99m-labeled enteral infusion demonstrated frequent episodes of gastroesophageal reflux and aspiration of gastric contents, which increased when the infusion rate was speeded up for nutritional replacement. Gastric retention also occurred at the higher infusion rate. Thus, percutaneous gastrostomy may not decrease the frequency of aspiration in patients at risk.\r"

Furthermore, Leu-19 (NKH-1) was expressed on both CD4+ and CD8+ IL 2 dependent T cell clones, and was present on both cytotoxic and non-cytotoxic T cell clones. Thus expression of Leu-19 (NKH-1) antigen on cultured cell lines does not directly correlate with cytotoxic function, antigenic specificity, or cell lineage.\r"

  ".W": "The production and characterization of a rat mu,kappa monoclonal anti-mouse T cell subset antibody, B4B2, is reported in this paper. B4B2 typing of lymphoid tissues of commonly used inbred mouse strains revealed two types of reactivity patterns. They can be characterized as C57BL/6-like (B6-like) or C3H/He-like (C3H-like). Among B6-like strains, B4B2 recognizes 5 to 10% of spleen cells, 30 to 50% of bone marrow cells, and less than 2 to 3% of thymocytes. In C3H-like strains, B4B2 reacts with less than 1% of spleen cells, 2 to 8% of bone marrow cells, and less than 1% of thymocytes. B4B2 recognizes a T cell subset differentiation antigen expressed by B6-like strains but not by C3H-like strains. Typing of BXH recombinant inbred strains showed linked expression of B4B2 and the Ly-6 antigen. The expression of B4B2 antigen appears to be under codominant control as the median fluorescence distribution of B4B2+ cells in C57BL/6 was approximately twice that of (C57BL/6xC3H)F1. B4B2 was shown to react with approximately 40 to 50% of Lyt-2+ T cells and less than 1% of L3T4+ T cells. No staining of resting or activated B cells by B4B2 was detected. The ratio of B4B2+:Lyt-2+ cells was similar for resting T cells and activated T cells obtained from mitogen-stimulated cultures or mixed lymphocyte cultures. In neonatal spleen, substantially more B4B2+ than Lyt-2+ cells were found. With increasing age, however, a rapid decline in B4B2+ cells and a corresponding increase of Lyt-2+ cells was observed. By approximately 1 mo of age, the relative proportion of these subsets had reversed so that Lyt-2+ cells became more numerous than B4B2+ cells.\r"

  ".W": "The IJ genetic restrictions of suppressor T (Ts) cells are controlled by H-2-related determinants that are expressed on antigen-presenting cells. This has led to the hypothesis that Ts cells carry receptors for a self H-2-related ligand that is expressed on specialized antigen-presenting cells. We refer to this H-2-related ligand as the IJ interacting molecule. This report evaluates the ability of rabbit antibodies directed against idiotypes on monoclonal anti-IJ antibodies (the latter are presumably reactive with the Ts cell receptor) to bind IJ interacting molecule and to inhibit antigen presentation to Ts cells. Such anti-idiotypic reagents were prepared against T cell-reactive monoclonal anti-IJk and anti-IJd antibodies. The F(ab')2 fragments of these anti-idiotypic reagents blocked Ts cell induction. The inhibition was haplotype specific and mapped to the IJ region. The anti-idiotypic antibodies blocked the generation of Ts1, Ts2, and Ts3 cells. The cellular target of the blocking activity mediated by these anti-idiotypic antibodies is a macrophage. This was shown by using a cloned macrophage hybridoma line for both Ts induction and absorption of antibody activity. The combined data support the concept that macrophages express IJ interacting determinants that are responsible for Ts cell induction.\r"

Northern blot analysis of RNA from one of the clones shows that cells can be induced to express the genes for both IL 1 alpha and IL 1 beta.

Given previous reports that anti-CD2 moAb prevent production of interleukin 2 (IL 2), as well as up-regulation of IL 2 receptor, we chose a test system in which lymphocytes were activated by exogenously added recombinant IL 2 (rIL 2). Our studies thus allowed us to evaluate other possible mechanisms by which anti-CD2 moAb could act. We found that Leu-5b not only blocked the proliferative response of human peripheral blood leukocytes (PBL) to IL 2, but also the development of cytotoxicity as assayed in lectin-dependent cytotoxicity (LDCC). Addition of recombinant interleukin 1 beta (rIL 1 beta) reconstituted the proliferative response in the presence of Leu-5b but did not allow development of cytotoxicity. Our findings are consistent with the concept that Leu-5b delivers a signal to IL 2-responsive cells that prevents their subsequent proliferation and development of cytotoxicity, but that only the former event, i.e., proliferation, is reconstituted by the addition of IL 1 beta.\r"

  ".W": "The colon cancer cell line, HT29, produces a soluble substance (HT29 factor) that blocks mitogen-induced T cell proliferation and the production of interleukin 2 (IL 2). Inhibition of T cell proliferation by the HT29 factor is reversible and is not due to a decline in cell viability or an alteration in the kinetics of T cell proliferation. It occurs even when the HT29 factor is added only 24 hr before terminating the T cell cultures, indicating that the factor affects cell division after activation of T cells has already occurred. No inhibitory activity was found in medium conditioned by human colonic epithelial cells or fibroblasts. The factor has an apparent m.w. of 56,000 and an isoelectric point of 7.9. It is sensitive to endopeptidases, heating to 56 degrees C, and extremes of pH. The HT29 factor also suppresses IL 2 production by T cells. However, low IL 2 availability alone cannot account for the suppressive effect of the factor on T cell proliferation, because the addition of exogenous IL 2 does not reverse the inhibition. This block in IL 2 responsiveness is not primarily due to a decrease in IL 2 receptors because Tac expression on activated T cells is minimally decreased during a 24-hr exposure to the HT29 factor. In addition, IL 2-induced proliferation of mitogen-activated T cells is inhibited only slightly by the HT29 factor, indicating that a block in the interaction of IL 2 with its receptor is not its main mechanism of action. Thus the inhibition of T cell proliferation is likely to be due primarily to a mechanism independent of IL 2.\r"

Therefore, ligand-receptor occupancy appears to be required for sustaining biochemical events associated with triggering the T3/Ti complex. Studies of the time-dependent requirements for the two stimuli required for activation revealed that simultaneous stimulation with both Con A and PMA is required for 2 to 4 hr for the cell to commit itself to activation, as measured by the appearance of secreted IL 2. This 2- to 4-hr requirement correlated precisely with the appearance of IL 2 mRNA, and the appearance of IL 2 transcripts depended on protein synthesis during this critical time period.\r"

  ".U": "87167566\r", 
  ".W": "Although salicylates have been used for centuries as treatment of inflammatory diseases, the mechanism of action of these drugs is still not clear. Aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) inhibit prostaglandin biosynthesis, a property that appears to explain part of their anti-inflammatory activity. However, this mechanism does not appear to explain the anti-inflammatory properties of salicylic acid, which is a major metabolite of ASA in vivo. Results of prior studies in our laboratory have established that benzoic acid, the parent compound of the salicylate group of drugs, is decarboxylated and hydroxylated by the hydroxyl free radical (OH.) produced by stimulated granulocytes. These observations suggested that salicylates might be similarly metabolized by granulocytes. If so, the capacity of salicylates to rapidly react with OH. might relate directly to their known anti-inflammatory properties. Preliminary experiments established that salicylic acid and aspirin were decarboxylated by the hydroxyl free radical generated by the enzyme system xanthine-xanthine oxidase. We then studied the metabolism of salicylates by human granulocytes. Unstimulated granulocyte suspensions did not oxidize ASA or salicylic acid. However, suspensions stimulated by opsonized zymosan particles rapidly oxidized both substrates in pharmacological concentrations. The rate of oxidation of salicylic acid was 16-fold higher than benzoic acid, whereas the rate of oxidation of ASA was four-fold higher. The reaction was oxygen dependent and could be inhibited by known hydroxyl scavengers, particularly dimethylthiourea. The reaction could also be inhibited by superoxide dismutase and azide, indicating that O-2 and heme or an iron-dependent enzyme were required for the reaction. The reaction was not impaired by compounds known to react with the HOCL and the chloramines generated by stimulated PMN. Furthermore, salicylic acid in high concentrations did not impair the HMPS pathway, the production of O-2 or the production of H2O2 by granulocytes. These data provide evidence that salicylates are rapidly oxidized by the hydroxyl free radical produced by granulocytes and not O-2, H2O2, or HOCL. This capacity of salicylates to react rapidly and selectively react with OH. may directly relate to their anti-inflammatory properties. In addition, results of our experiments indicate that stimulated granulocytes acquire the capacity to metabolize these drugs. Therefore, several metabolites of salicylates may be produced at a site of inflammation, all of which may have altered biological activity compared with the parent compound.\r"

  ".W": "The in vivo induction of T cell-mediated immunity was studied by infecting mice with two genetically closely related mutants from Listeria monocytogenes, differing only with respect to the secretion of an active SH-dependent hemolysin. It is shown that even minute doses of hemolytic bacteria capable of growing in host tissues easily induced the expression of T cell-mediated immunity, as estimated by the level of delayed sensitivity, adoptive protection and long-lasting immunological memory. On the contrary, nonhemolytic bacteria unable to multiply in host tissues totally failed to initiate the expression of T cell-mediated immunity in vivo. This failure was even observed when mice were repeatedly infected by high doses of nonhemolytic bacteria, allowing to maintain a significant amount of viable bacteria for several days in host tissues. These results mean that the presence of viable bacteria at a significant level in the host is not sufficient per se to induce detectable T cell clonal expansion in the in vivo setting, implying that the process of bacterial growth inside macrophages is required to initiate in vivo the expression of T cell-mediated immunity.\r"

  ".U": "87167580\r", 
  ".W": "We have previously reported that BALB/c mice immunized with 10 micrograms of a Pseudomonas aeruginosa polysaccharide antigen (PS) and 100 micrograms vinblastine sulfate develop T cell-mediated protective immunity, but fail to generate an antibody response. Vinblastine functions in this system to remove a suppressor cell that normally inhibits expression of this form of immunity after PS immunization. T cells from CB.20 mice immunized with the 10 micrograms of PS and 100 micrograms vinblastine fail to kill P. aeruginosa in vitro. These mice are allotype congenic with BALB/c mice, differing at loci closely linked to the IgH-1 locus. Immunization of CB.20 mice with 10 micrograms PS and 100 micrograms vinblastine results in the appearance of T cells which suppress in vitro bactericidal activity of BALB/c T cells. In the current study we found that T cell-mediated bactericidal activity can be generated in CB.20 mice by increasing the dose of vinblastine given at the time of PS immunization. The phenotype of the CB.20 bactericidal T cell generated by high dose vinblastine is identical to that of the BALB/c bactericidal T cell, and the CB.20 bactericidal T cell can adoptively transfer protective immunity to granulocytopenic mice. After immunization of BALB/c and CB.20 mice with PS alone, approximately one log fewer CB.20 T cells than BALB/c T cells are required to suppress bacterial killing in vitro. Furthermore, the number of CB.20 T cells required to suppress in vitro bacterial killing is directly correlated with the dose of vinblastine administered at the time of immunization. Increasing the immunizing dose of PS overcomes suppressor activity and allows the generation of bactericidal T cells in BALB/c mice without a requirement for vinblastine. CB.20 mice fail to generate bactericidal T cells after immunization with high doses of PS. These results indicate that CB.20 and BALB/c mice both possess the full repertoire of T cells required to express bactericidal T cell activity and that the differences in their responses reflect only quantitative differences in suppressor cell activity.\r"

This treatment depleted the respective T cell subsets to undetectable levels in peripheral blood when assayed by immunofluorescence. In mice treated with anti-Lyt-2, induction of cytotoxic T cells was reduced to less than 1 to 2% after intravenous infection with Armstrong strain of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV). In addition, no primary swelling of the footpad could be detected following local inoculation of the virus. In animals treated with anti-L3/T4, antiviral cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses were reduced by a factor of 10. These L3/T4+ cell-depleted mice showed delayed footpad swelling after local injection of LCMV Armstrong. After intracerebral infection with LCMV, anti-Lyt-2-treated mice were resistant and those injected with anti-L3/T4 were totally susceptible to LCMV Armstrong-triggered immunopathologic disease. Virus could be detected in the blood of antibody-treated mice 7 days after inoculation; however, no virus could be measured in the blood of surviving anti-Lyt-2-treated animals 15 days after intracerebral infection. Serum titers of interferon-alpha,beta induced by viral infection remained unaffected by depletion of T cell subsets. Anti-L3/T4 antibody-treated C57BL/6 mice failed to generate IgG antibodies against the New Jersey strain of vesicular stomatitis virus, whereas Lyt-2+ cell-depleted mice had normal antivesicular stomatitis virus (New Jersey strain) IgG antibody titers.\r"

  ".W": "During the first 2 to 4 weeks of progressive visceral infection with the intracellular protozoan, Leishmania donovani, spleen cells from BALB/c mice failed in response to leishmanial antigen to produce either of the activating T cell-derived lymphokines, interleukin 2 (IL 2) or gamma-interferon (IFN-gamma). Four weeks after infection, however, antigen-induced IL 2 and IFN-gamma secretion emerged and coincided with the onset of control over parasite replication and the subsequent killing of greater than 80% of intrahepatic L. donovani. The development of this immunosecretory activity correlated with the hepatic tissue response at the site of parasitized Kupffer cells. This response progressed from Kupffer cell fusion (week 1) to fusion plus a mononuclear cell infiltrate (week 2) to well-organized granuloma formation (weeks 4 to 8). In contrast, T cell-deficient nude BALB/c mice exerted no control over L. donovani, their spleen cells failed to generate antigen-induced IFN-gamma, and at 4 weeks, their livers were devoid of any tissue reaction. Since spleen cells from 2-week infected normal mice did not produce antigen-stimulated IL 2 or IFN-gamma, these mice were treated with recombinant (r) lymphokines. Various protocols using both high and low dose human rIL 2 had no antileishmanial effect. Hepatic parasite replication was completely halted, however, by macrophage-activating doses of murine rIFN-gamma. These results reemphasize that an intact T cell-dependent response is required for successful defense against L. donovani, indicate that this immune response can be measured at both the cellular (secretory) and tissue levels, and confirm that IFN-gamma can exert an antileishmanial effect in vivo.\r"

  ".U": "87167586\r", 
  ".W": "A cross-reactive idiotype family was previously identified from a very large library of phthalate-specific hybridoma clones. The prototype of this idiotype family is the hybridoma, 2E9, secreting an IgM antibody with phthalate specificity. A portion of both primary and secondary anti-phthalate antibodies elicited in all BALB/c mice tested expresses the 2E9 cross-reactive idiotype. This idiotype has now been found in the anti-phthalate antibodies of several other inbred strains of mice (A/HeHa, DBA/2, and C3Hf/HeHa) tested but not in C57BL/6 mice. Anti-phthalate antibodies elicited from congenic mice BC.8, which express the same IgCH allotype as BALB/c mice but possess C57BL/6 genetic background, contain the 2E9 cross-reactive idiotype, whereas this idiotype is not expressed on the anti-phthalate antibodies derived from another congenic mouse CB.20, which expresses a C57BL/6 IgCH allotype and a genetic background of the BALB/c strain. These results indicate that the gene controlling the 2E9 idiotype is closely linked to the IgCH allotype locus. The 2E9 cross-reactive idiotype was also found in all of the F1 mice (BALB/c X C57BL/6) tested, and the level of expression of this idiotype in the F1 mice was quantitatively equivalent to the allotype/idiotype homozygous mice. The expression of the 2E9 idiotype in the phthalate repertoire has been followed in 12 different wild mouse populations. As expected, the 2E9 idiotype was observed in a large proportion of the wild mouse strains. Surprisingly, several examples of nonconcordance in the expression of idiotype and allotype were observed in these mice. One likely explanation for the linkage breakdown is a crossing over of the heavy chain constant and variable region gene complexes. In the SM/J inbred strain of mice, where such a crossover has occurred, nonconcordance between allotype and 2E9 idiotype expression was demonstrated. By using the recombinant inbred BXD strains of mice, the VH gene encoding the 2E9 idiotype has been mapped with respect to other known VH gene families. Relative to other VH genes the VH-Xmp is situated very close to the IgCH gene region.\r"

Although similar to amino acid sequences derived from fragments of isolated lambda-chains from several Basilea rabbits, differences in the first framework region (FR1) suggest that at least two germ-line V lambda genes are expressed. There are major differences between rabbit V lambda sequences and light chains of other species: in particular, rabbit lambda-chains have an additional four amino acids in the vicinity of the FR2-CDR2 junction. The same region also has significant homology with the human D2 germ-line mini-gene sequence, especially with a 14-nucleotide sequence previously shown to be homologous to human and rabbit heavy chain CDR2 sequences. Similar homologies in other heavy and light chain sequences suggest that D-gene segments may be derived from VH genes, perhaps by transposition. The framework regions of the rabbit lambda-chain encoded by clone pDH7 show the greatest homologies with those of human kappa- and lambda-sequences (46 to 54% homology), with that of chicken sequence (55%), and least with murine V lambda sequences (40%).\r"

  ".W": "The genes encoding 11 independently derived anti-DNA autoantibodies from the lupus-prone mouse strain, MRL-lpr/lpr, were examined with VH, D, and JH gene probes. These autoantibodies do not define new VH gene families, since all of the autoantibodies were encoded by VH genes from four of the nine known gene families. A minimum of nine different VH genes encoded this panel of 11 anti-DNA autoantibodies. These results are consistent with the stochastic use of the VH gene repertoire and the expression of multiple VH genes. However, the data is also consistent with a biased usage of the VH gene repertoire. First, two pairs of autoantibodies, one from the J558 family and one from the 7183 family, appear to express identical or closely related VH genes as determined by the position of two restriction enzyme sites 5' of the expressed VH genes. In addition, three autoantibodies that appear to be sister clones might define a third VH gene that is used repeatedly. Secondly, about 45% of the panel is encoded by the Q52 and 7183 families, which are the 3' most families. These families have been shown to be preferentially rearranged early in B cell ontogeny. This suggests that some anti-DNA autoantibodies might originate from a population of B cells that predominate early in ontogeny. An alternative hypothesis is that the potential bias in VH gene and gene family usage could be due to antigen selection. All four JH genes are expressed, although the JH1 gene appears to be underutilized in both expressed and unexpressed rearrangements. Two members of the panel that bind double-stranded DNA were encoded by two different VH gene families, the S107 family and the J558 family.\r"

We observed a decrease in the incorporation of [3H]-uridine into total RNA in macrophages treated with doses of IFN that induce cytotoxic activity. IFN-gamma was 100-fold to 1000-fold more potent that IFN-beta in inhibiting RNA synthesis. [3H]Uridine-labeled RNA was purified from IFN-activated and control macrophages and was size fractionated on agarose gels. Macrophages activated by either IFN-gamma or IFN-beta had an imbalanced accumulation of 28S ribosomal RNA compared with their accumulation of 18S ribosomal RNA. Pulse-chase experiments suggested that IFN induced a selective inhibition of the processing of 28S ribosomal RNA. These results provide the first evidence that IFN can modulate ribosomal gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. Moreover, they indicate that inhibition of 28S ribosomal RNA accumulation in macrophages is a molecular event triggered by IFN-gamma, as well as IFN-beta.\r"

After in vitro treatment of Jurkat with phytohemagglutinin (PHA) and phorbol ester (PMA), RNA transcripts of both interleukin 2 (IL 2) and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) appear, followed by secretion of both biologically active lymphokines. Employing the nuclear run-on technology, we first confirmed that the expression of both lymphokines after T cell activation is regulated at the transcriptional level. By using the recombinant approach of DNase I hypersensitivity mapping, we had previously localized a structurally unique, lymphocyte-specific genomic domain in the first intron of the human IFN-gamma gene that correlated with the transcriptional potential of that gene. By using several T cell lines that differ in their inducible expression of IFN-gamma, we have now localized several additional structural domains within the human IFN-gamma gene that appear to be coordinately involved in regulating expression. These include: a distal 5' flanking region site also seen only in T lymphocytes that can express the gene, a proximal, promoter-associated site that appears only after PHA/PMA-mediated IFN-gamma induction, and a second intronic site seen only in T cells whose IFN-gamma gene is selectively inactive. Collectively, our data suggest that T cell activation is accompanied by transcriptional level induction of lymphokine gene expression. In the case of IFN-gamma, T cell nuclei possess specific structural domains within the gene itself that seem to participate both positively and negatively in activation-mediated regulatory events.\r"

  ".W": "Rat bone marrow-derived mononuclear phagocytes, virtually homogeneous with respect to the cell lineage, do not exhibit spontaneous tumoricidal activity in the resting state. When incubated with macrophage-activating lymphokines, rat recombinant interferon-gamma (IFN), or heat-killed Corynebacterium parvum, bone marrow-derived mononuclear phagocytes readily evolve tumoricidal activity. Whereas tumoricidal activity induced by lymphokines and/or rat recombinant IFN-gamma is short-lived, that elicited by C. parvum is maintained for at least 2 wk, provided that the C. parvum organisms are continuously present in the culture. After washing off extracellular organisms, C. parvum-induced tumoricidal activity decays rapidly, suggesting that sustained extracellular stimulation is required for its maintenance. Induction of tumoricidal activity by macrophage-activating lymphokines and/or rat recombinant IFN-gamma is fully prevented by polyclonal and monoclonal anti-IFN-gamma antibodies; in contrast, induction by C. parvum is not affected by anti-IFN-gamma. Since induction of tumoricidal activity by C. parvum takes place irrespective of the presence of anti-Thy-1 antisera or cyclosporin A, T cells and/or their products appear not to be involved in this type of macrophage activation. Accordingly, present findings provide evidence for the existence of lymphokine-independent pathways of macrophage activation.\r"

Supernatants from the Doc8 and M1Do cell lines were strongly chemotactic in vitro for mononuclear phagocytes. Chemotactic activity was destroyed by proteolytic enzymes, and upon gel filtration on Sephadex G75, it eluted in the cytochrome c region corresponding to an apparent m.w. of 12,000. Upon chromatofocusing, the Sephadex-separated tumor-derived chemotactic factor (TDCF) showed an isoelectric point of 5.5 to 6. Cell lines with high tumorigenic potential contained low or no detectable chemotactic activity. When culture supernatants of cell lines with modest (M3Da) or no (M4Be) chemotactic activity were exposed to immobilized monoclonal antibodies directed against the retroviral transmembrane protein P15E, appreciable chemotactic activity was detectable (M4Be) or preexisting levels increased (M3Da). The material eluted from Sepharose-bound anti-P15E antibodies inhibited the migration of monocytes in response to chemoattractants. These findings demonstrate the coexistence in some human melanoma cell line supernatants of factors (TDCF and P15E-related inhibitor) with opposite influence on monocyte chemotaxis. That tumor cell products play a pivotal role in regulating the extravasation of monocytes into neoplastic tissues is suggested by the close correlation observed between macrophage levels in melanomas grown in nude mice and levels of chemotactic activity detectable in culture supernatants.\r"

  ".W": "Activation of murine B lymphocytes in a splenocyte stimulator population with affinity-purified goat anti-mouse IgD (G alpha M delta) antibody was previously shown by this laboratory to enhance the presentation of strongly stimulatory major histocompatibility complex (MHC) and minor lymphocyte-stimulating (Mlsa,d) determinants in a primary mixed lymphocyte reaction. In the present study, the G alpha M delta treatment of murine splenocytes was employed to enhance the detection of the weakly stimulatory non-MHC Mlsc determinant in order to study the role the MHC might play as a restricting element for the recognition of these minor antigens in a primary mixed lymphocyte reaction. Indeed, enhanced T cell proliferation to Mlsc determinants presented on G alpha M delta-treated splenocytes was observed when the responder and activated H-2-compatible stimulator cell shared certain MHC haplotypes. High responsiveness was associated with the H-2a,k,j,p haplotypes, intermediate responsiveness was associated with the H-2f,g haplotypes and low responsiveness was associated with the H-2b,s haplotypes. (Low X high responder)F1 T cells preferentially responded to the Mlsc determinants presented on G alpha M delta-treated stimulator cells of the F1 or parental high responder H-2 haplotype. When mitomycin C instead of irradiation was used to inactivate normal (non-IgD-treated) splenocytes, a similar preferential response of T cells to Mlsc determinants presented on stimulator cells of a high responder H-2 haplotype was also observed. The inability of G alpha M delta-treated splenocytes of the low responder haplotype to elicit substantial levels of T cell proliferation across an Mlsc difference could not be attributed to the failure of these stimulator cells to become activated by the anti-Ig antibody. In addition, co-culture experiments could not identify the poor T cell response to Mlsc determinants presented on certain MHC haplotypes as being caused by the induction of nonspecific suppressor cells. Presentation of Mlsc determinants caused by transgene product complementation was detectable in F1 mice derived by crossing one parent that had the Mlsc non-MHC genes and a poorly permissive H-2 haplotype with a parent that expressed a permissive H-2 haplotype but lacked the Mlsc non-MHC genes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "87167599\r", 
  ".W": "The recognition of many class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-associated antigens by T cells requires the participation of the L3T4 molecule. It has been proposed that this molecule acts to stabilize low affinity binding to antigen in association with MHC and thereby increases the avidity of T cell/antigen interactions. By using antibodies against the T cell antigen receptor (TCR) to activate T cells, thereby circumventing the requirement for antigen presenting cells and MHC-associated antigen, we have been able to study the function of L3T4 in the absence of class II MHC. We have used two monoclonal antibodies, KJ16-133.18 and F23.1, that recognize a determinant encoded by the T cell receptor V beta 8 gene family. These antibodies were used to select two clones of T cells with surface phenotype Thy-1.2+, L3T4+, Lyt-2-, KJ16-133.18+, F23.1+, IA-, IE-. One of these clones (E9.D4) was hapten-specific (anti-ABA + Iak), the other (4.35F2) was alloreactive (anti-Iak). Activation of these clones by antigen, concanavalin A (Con A) or by the F23.1 antibody was studied by assaying the production of interleukin 3 (IL 3). Both soluble and solid phase-coupled F23.1 induced T cell activation in the complete absence of class II MHC, immobilized antibody (either Sepharose-coupled or plastic-adsorbed) being more effective. The induction of IL 3 production by suboptimal doses of either Con A or plastic-adsorbed F23.1 was inhibited by the anti-L3T4 antibody GK1.5, as was the response to F23.1 coupled to Sepharose-4B beads. However, the responses to optimal or superoptimal doses of these stimuli were not inhibited. In contrast, weak responses to non-TCR cross-linking stimuli such as phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) or low concentrations of soluble F23.1 were not inhibited by GK1.5 (the latter response was usually slightly enhanced). These results show that anti-L3T4 antibodies are not inherently inhibitory, but require both ligation and cross-linking of the TCR for their effect. We propose a model whereby L3T4 interacts with the TCR during T cell activation. Anti-L3T4 antibodies sterically hinder the formation of TCR complexes and so prevent activation. However, by increasing the epitope density of the activating ligand, the avidity of the T cell/ligand interaction can be increased sufficiently to prevent this disruption.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies have indicated that the human thymus is composed of several discrete compartments. Cortical thymocytes are reactive with the monoclonal antibody anti-T6, whereas most medullary cells, unreactive with anti-T6, stain brightly with anti-T3 antibody, which defines mature T cell populations. By using an indirect immune rosette method, we isolated the minor thymocyte population (1 to 2% of all thymocytes) lacking both T3 and T6 but expressing T11 antigens. These cells could be maintained in culture supplemented with recombinant IL 2 (Rec-IL 2) for several days. Under these conditions, T3-T6- cells were shown to undergo phenotypic changes. In the absence of thymic macrophage (Mo), T3+ and T8+ thymocytes appeared in culture, whereas the development of T4+ cells strictly required the presence of Mo. The expression of T4 antigen could be largely prevented by the addition of anti-HLA-DR antibody, further indicating that Ia+ accessory cells had the ability to promote in vitro development of T4+ thymocytes. In the presence of Mo, not only T4+ but also T8+ cells were obtained. Double fluorescence staining with anti-T8-FITC and anti-T4-biotin demonstrated that after 12 days of culture, T4 and T8 antigens were mutually exclusive. Furthermore, during the course of these studies, we observed that under the culture conditions utilized (e.g., presence or absence of Mo), T3-T6-thymocytes failed to express the T6 antigen. Thus, the in vitro development of T cells bearing a mature phenotype could be obtained in the absence of intermediate expression of cortical (T6+) thymocytes.\r"

  ".U": "87167601\r", 
  ".W": "The cytotoxic reaction mediated by cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) consists of three phases: first, the CTL binds to the target cell; next, the CTL is triggered to lyse the target cell; and in the third phase, the CTL detaches from the target cell which is lysed in the absence of the CTL. Recently, we obtained evidence that human alloreactive CTL clones initially adhere to target cells without the involvement of the interaction between the T cell receptor (Tcr) and its specific target antigen. In the present study, we investigated the effect of monoclonal antibodies specific for the Tcr on the cytotoxic reaction of three CD8+ HLA-A2-specific CTL clones, using a single cell assay in which the binding event can be distinguished from the post-binding (lytic) phase of the cytolytic reaction. It was found that monoclonal antibodies directed at a variable part of the Tcr do not affect the binding phase but strongly block the lytic phase of the cytotoxic reaction. An anti-constant region Tcr antibody and an anti-CD3 reagent had a similar effect on the two phases of the reaction as the anti-variable part Tcr antibodies. In contrast, antibodies specific for LFA-1 strongly blocked the adhesion phase but did not affect the lytic phase. Antibodies specific for CD-8 had intermediate effects. They could block both the adhesion as well as the lytic phase. The effect of anti-CD8 appeared to be dependent on the CTL clone tested. One clone was found to be inhibited in the adhesion phase, but not in the lytic phase, whereas anti-CD8 hardly blocked the adhesion phase of two other CTL clones, but affected the lytic step of those clones. Our data indicate that LFA-1 is a major adhesion molecule in the CTL reaction, whereas the Tcr/CD3 complex is implicated in a phase after the initial formation of conjugates. CD8 is associated with both steps in the cytolytic reaction. In addition to its minor role in the adhesion phase, our data suggest strongly that CD-8 is involved in the triggering phase of the cytolytic reaction.\r"

  ".W": "The in vitro antibody response to dextran B1355S, a thymus-independent Type 2 antigen, requires T cell-derived lymphokines but is not thought to require an activation signal from an antigen-specific T helper cell. The present study demonstrates that there are two dextran-reactive B cell populations in BALB/c mice with respect to the T cell requirements for the generation of antibody-forming cells. One population found among dextran-reactive spleen B cells from 12- to 14-mo-old BALB/c mice generated anti-dextran PFC in the presence of B cell growth factor (BCGF II) and IL 2 or the combination of BCGF II, IL 2, and IFN-gamma. A second population of dextran-reactive B cells found in spleen and Peyer's patches of 2-mo-old unprimed mice did not respond to these same lymphokines, but did generate anti-dextran plaque-forming cells in the presence of Thy-1.2+, L3T4+ T cells from Peyer's patches. However, splenic B cells obtained from 2-mo-old mice that had been primed with dextran 2 to 3 days after birth were shown to be responsive to the same lymphokines as dextran-reactive B cells from 12- to 14-mo-old mice. These results suggest that previous priming with dextran B1355S induces a dextran-specific B cell population that can be activated to antibody-forming cells in the presence of antigen and T cell-derived lymphokines, whereas a second, unprimed population requires an additional activation signal from L3T4+ T cells.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the potential immunotherapeutic role of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) as a mononuclear phagocyte-activating agent, we examined the effector cell function of peripheral blood monocytes from healthy donors and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) patients after either in vitro and/or in vivo treatment with recombinant (r) IFN-gamma. When assayed immediately after a 24-hr in vitro pulse with 300 U/ml, normal and AIDS monocytes behaved similarly with little augmentation of their intrinsically high levels of H2O2 release and activity against Toxoplasma gondii; in contrast, activity toward the more resistant intracellular pathogen, Leishmania donovani, was appreciably enhanced by rIFN-gamma. In addition, upon testing 4 to 6 days after in vitro pulsing, both normal and AIDS monocytes showed clear evidence of persistent activation in all three assays. The capacity of IFN-gamma to similarly activate monocytes in vivo was confirmed in all ten treated AIDS patients by examining cells before and after 24-hr infusions of 0.03 and 0.5 mg of rIFN-gamma/square meter (M2) of body surface area. For postinfusion monocytes tested after 1 day in culture, H2O2 release and antitoxoplasma activity were essentially unchanged, but antileishmanial effects were augmented. After 5 to 7 days in culture, monocytes from treated patients showed 3.2- to 5.9-fold increases in H2O2-releasing capacity and increases of 49 to 68% and 35 to 61% in intracellular activity against T. gondii and L. donovani, respectively. These results indicate that the human monocyte can be induced by rIFN-gamma to express signs of both immediate and persistent activation and suggest that, as a direct activator of mononuclear phagocytes, rIFN-gamma may also have potential as an immunotherapeutic agent for patients with intracellular infections.\r"

  ".W": "Very few types of normal cells fail entirely to express class I human leukocyte antigens (HLA), and many of those cells (sperm, fetal amnion epithelial cells, and fetal trophoblasts) are related to the process of reproduction. Susceptibility of sperm to modulation of class I antigens has not been examined, but it has recently been demonstrated that amnion cells respond to exposure to IFN-gamma with readily detectable levels of class I antigens. In addition, one of two trophoblast cell lines (BeWo) has been shown to exhibit enhanced expression of class I HLA in response to IFN-gamma. Expression by a second trophoblast cell line (Jar) was not inducible. Findings in the present study included demonstration of IFN-gamma-enhanced class I-specific mRNA synthesis in JEG-3 cells, which are derived from BeWo, and failure of synthesis by Jar cells. Those results eliminated trivial explanations for the preceding findings and confirmed the responsiveness of some but not all cells of trophoblast origin to IFN-gamma. When successful modulating conditions for amnion and malignant trophoblast cells were applied to normal tissues, third trimester term chorionic cytotrophoblasts and first trimester villous syncytial and cytotrophoblasts failed to exhibit class I HLA. Neither malignant nor normal trophoblasts expressed class II HLA under any condition of testing. Failure of induction of HLA expression by normal trophoblasts could not be attributed to either loss of viability by tissue explants or failure of modulating reagents to reach the trophoblasts. The results demonstrate that regulation of expression of histocompatibility antigens by major populations of normal trophoblasts and one of two choriocarcinoma cell lines differs markedly from that of other fetal and adult cells. Uncommon regulatory mechanisms may be essential to maintenance of the trophoblast as an immunologically inert barrier between the mother and her antigenically disparate fetus.\r"

IFN-gamma did not induce any IL 1. IFN-gamma-stimulated monocyte supernatants were also negative for pyrogenic activity. However, IFN-gamma greatly enhanced the amount of IL 1 secreted when monocytes were stimulated by lipopolysaccharide or Staphylococcus aureus, even at concentrations which by themselves did not induce IL 1. IFN-alpha did not enhance IL 1 secretion induced by other stimuli. IFN-gamma enhanced IL 1 secretion by priming monocytes to be more sensitive to an IL 1-inducing stimulus. However, IFN-gamma does not enhance IL 1 induced by all stimuli, because there was no enhancement of IL 1 induced by PMA. Thus, IFN-alpha and IFN-gamma have very distinct roles in the induction and enhancement of IL 1 by monocytes.\r"

This cell line, designated B-A3, was established by Epstein Barr virus (EBV) transformation of Staphylococcus aureus Cowan I (SAC)-activated spleen B cells, and has been maintained in RPMI 1640 medium complemented with 15% fetal calf serum (FCS) without the addition of other exogenous growth factors. A proliferative response, as measured by [3H]thymidine uptake of B-A3 cells was significantly induced by either commercial IL 2-free human BCGF preparations, or phytohemagglutinin-stimulated mixed lymphocyte culture supernatant at all FCS concentrations used in the assay. The most marked proliferation due to BCGF, however, was observed in the absence of FCS. This BCGF-induced proliferation was not influenced by IL 2 or interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), because both recombinant IL 2 and IFN-gamma failed to induce proliferation. The response of B-A3 cells to a specific BCGF was additionally indicated by the responsiveness of this cell line to BCGF purified by a series of chromatographic steps. The BCGF to which B-A3 cells responded had a m.w. of 14,000 and was similar to low m.w. BCGF reported from other laboratories. Surface characterization of B-A3 cells, analyzed by flow cytometry with a panel of monoclonal antibodies, demonstrated that the majority of B-A3 cells were stained positively with Leu-12, HLA-DR, and surface IgG markers, whereas staining with surface IgM, IgD markers, pan T cell markers (Leu-4 and Leu-9), and IL 2 receptor (Tac) were consistently negative. Taken together, the human lymphoblastoid cell line we present here responded specifically to a low m.w. BCGF. This cell line may be of value in the purification of BCGF to homogeneity, in studies of the interactions of BCGF with human B cells, and in the identification of the BCGF receptor.\r"

The cell suspensions contained 8% mast cells, which on average contained 1 to 2 pg of histamine/cell. With the use of histochemical procedures based upon fixative sensitivity and dye binding, which identify functionally distinct mast cell subtypes in the rat, dispersed human intestinal mast cells contained approximately equal proportions of two histochemical subtypes analogous to those in the rat. Whether these are functionally distinct as in the rat remains to be determined. The histochemically mixed mast cell populations from the human intestinal mucosa secreted histamine in a dose- and energy-dependent manner in response to anti-IgE and A23187, but not 48/80. Theophylline, doxantrazole, quercetin, and salbutamol all significantly inhibited anti-IgE-induced histamine secretion by human intestinal mast cells, but cromolyn sodium and the experimental antisecretory drugs, nedocromil sodium and FPL 52694, did not inhibit histamine secretion by the mast cell mixture to a statistically significant extent. Cromolyn sodium inhibited histamine secretion by 15 to 30%, and whether this reflected inhibition of one of the two histochemical mast cell subtypes to a greater extent than the other or all the cells to a minimal degree remains to be established. Control investigations of the intestinal cell isolation procedure indicated that these qualities did not reflect effects of the cell dispersal procedure. Further characterization and analysis of intestinal mast cells is essential to determine if functionally distinct mast cell subtypes exist in human tissues.\r"

Ultrastructurally, these basophilic leukocytes contained segmented nuclei and granules with reticular patterns resembling those of normal basophils, and other granules with scroll and grating patterns resembling those of normal connective tissue mast cells. The 35S-labeled macromolecules isolated from these cells were approximately 140,000 m.w. Pronase-resistant proteoglycans bearing approximately 15,000 m.w. glycosaminoglycans. On incubation with chondroitinase ABC, nitrous acid, and heparinase, the 35S-labeled proteoglycans were degraded 50 to 84%, 16 to 43%, and 8 to 37%, respectively, indicating the presence of both chondroitin sulfate and heparin. As assessed by high performance liquid chromatography, the 35S-labeled chondroitin sulfate disaccharides liberated by chondroitinase ABC treatment were approximately 95% monosulfated chondroitin sulfate A and approximately 5% disulfated chondroitin sulfate E. The presence of heparin was confirmed by two-dimensional cellulose acetate electrophoresis of the 35S-labeled glycosaminoglycans. Cell preparations, enriched to 75% basophilic leukocytes by sorting for IgE+ cells, also synthesized 35S-labeled proteoglycans containing chondroitin sulfate and heparin. In one experiment, treatment of the cells with 1 microM calcium ionophore A23187 resulted in a 12% net release of both chondroitin sulfate and heparin containing 35S-labeled proteoglycans, a 57% net release of histamine, and the de novo generation of 8, 8, and 0.16 ng of immunoreactive equivalents of prostaglandin D2, leukotriene C4, and leukotriene B4, respectively, per 10(6) cells. Because only mast cells have been found to contain Pronase-resistant heparin proteoglycans, to generate PGD2 on cell activation, and to contain granules with scroll and grating patterns, these findings indicate that in some patients with myelogenous leukemia there are basophilic cells that possess properties of tissue mast cells.\r"

  ".W": "The addition of inactivated preparations of purified human T cell lymphotropic virus (HTLV-III) was found to inhibit normal human lymphocyte phytohemagglutinin (PHA)-induced blastogenesis but had no effect on concanavalin A (Con A), pokeweek mitogen, or allogeneic stimulation. The inhibition was concentration-dependent and also dependent on adding the virus preparation before or at the same time as PHA. The CD4 molecule is the receptor for HTLV-III binding. Immunopurified large envelope protein (gp120) from HTLV-III was found to bind to the CD4 molecule and also inhibited PHA-induced lymphocyte blastogenesis. These results suggest that the gp120 viral protein may alter immune function by binding to the CD4 molecule, which in turn serves as an \"off\" signal to lymphocyte response to PHA stimulation. Alternatively, by binding to the CD4 molecule, gp120 may interfere with the interaction of this molecule with class II histocompatibility antigens on accessory cells, thus selectively suppressing PHA response.\r"

  ".U": "87167638\r", 
  ".W": "Previously it was shown that macrophages (M phi) isolated from the vigorous (Vig) or modulated (Mod) liver granulomas (Gr) of Schistosoma mansoni-infected mice restored mitogen and parasite egg antigen-induced proliferative responses to accessory cell-depleted lymphocytes. Furthermore, supraoptimal concentrations of highly activated VigGrM phi suppressed lymphoproliferation to a greater extent than did the lesser activated ModGrM phi. In this study we investigated the role of soluble mediators in GrM phi accessory/regulatory activity. Indomethacin released VigGrM phi-mediated inhibition of mitogen but not antigen-induced lymphoproliferation. Extensively dialyzed serum-free GrM phi culture supernatant nonspecifically suppressed SEA- or KLH-induced blastogenesis. Culture supernatants also reduced vesicular stomatitis virus-induced plaque formation in supernatant-pretreated L-929 fibroblasts. The 20 to 45 Kd GrM phi-derived lymphoproliferation suppressive factor (SF) and the 20 to 50 Kd viral plaque-reducing factor (PRF) were stable at low pH, but became inactivated by heat and trypsin digestion. Although freshly isolated Vig or ModGrM phi contained preformed SF and PRF, in vitro production of the factors were depressed by protein synthesis inhibitors. Moreover, SF was active only when added to cultures before day 3 of the 6-day proliferation assay. Both SF and PRF were specifically retained on rabbit anti-murine IFN-alpha/beta immunoaffinity columns. Thus, the suppressive activity of Vig or ModGrM phi is in part mediated by a monokine that shares physical, biological, and antigenic characteristics with murine IFN-alpha/beta. In contrast to the suppression of antigen-driven proliferation, GrM phi culture supernatant costimulated PHA-induced mitogenesis. The 13 to 21 Kd GrM phi-derived lymphocyte-activating factor (LAF) was stable to heat, low pH, and trypsin digestion. Freshly isolated Vig or ModGrM phi contained preformed LAF, although its in vitro production was depressed by protein synthesis inhibitors. The physical and biological characteristics of GrM phi-derived LAF appear similar to IL 1. It is concluded that both Vig and ModGrM phi secrete regulatory/accessory monokines that may contribute to the initiation and maintenance of the focal inflammatory granulomatous response.\r"

  ".W": "Solubilized constituents from Listeria monocytogenes were fractionated by various techniques including isopycnic gradient centrifugation, molecular sieve chromatography, and preparative SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Fractionated material was tested in vitro for mitogenic and antigenic activity by quantitating the proliferation of splenic lymphocytes and the interleukin production by peritoneal T cells. Fractionation by isopycnic gradient centrifugation revealed both antigenic and mitogenic material fractionating with the protein at a density of 1.3 g/ml. This characteristic density, together with the reduction of activity with trypsin treatment, defined the material as protein. This material was termed soluble listerial proteins (SLP). Fractionation of SLP by molecular sieve chromatography using Sephacryl 200 (S-200) revealed predominant antigenic and mitogenic activity in proteins of greater than 100,000 m.w. In contrast, fractionation of SLP by preparative SDS-PAGE (nonreducing conditions) showed activity in groups of proteins with m.w. of less than 76,000. This difference (S-200 vs SDS-PAGE) may indicate an aggregation or subunit composition which is disrupted by SDS. When fractionated by SDS-PAGE, antigens which induced macrophage-dependent interleukin production by Listeria-immune T cells were observed over a broad range of molecular sizes. Major groups of antigenic proteins were observed at 57,000 to 76,000 m.w., approximately 40,000 and less than 25,000 m.w. Mitogenic activity (spleen cell proliferation) was associated with a more restricted group of proteins with major peaks at 57,000 and 40,000 m.w., with some weak activity in proteins less than 20,000 and greater than 64,000 m.w. Experiments involving T or B lymphocyte-depleted spleen cells and spleen cells from athymic mice revealed that the mitogenic response of splenic lymphocytes to SLP was predominantly B cell-mediated. Thus, we have defined groups of listerial proteins with potent antigenic activity with respect to T lymphocyte activation and as mitogenic activity for B cells.\r"

  ".W": "A single gene mutation results in near absence of B and T lymphocytes and their immediate progenitors in mice with severe combined immunodeficiency disease (SCID). However, long term culture conditions allowed rapid outgrowth of lymphocytes from SCID bone marrow suspensions, and this permitted their detailed analysis. The cells were judged to be committed to the B lymphocyte lineage on the basis of expression of the BP-1 antigen, as well as by the density and pattern of expression of other markers. Cultured SCID lymphocytes were indistinguishable from control BALB/c cells in terms of morphology, typing for 13 cell surface markers, and changes in cell surface antigen expression with time in culture. In contrast to cultures of normal cells, which always included IgM synthesizing cells, SCID lymphocytes rarely expressed mu heavy chains. Southern blot analysis demonstrated that at least the first Ig gene rearrangement step had occurred in most of the cultured cells. The patterns of JH gene rearrangements suggested that relatively limited population diversity existed in individual cultures of SCID and normal BALB/c marrow. In addition, there was evidence that abnormal Ig heavy chain gene rearrangements had taken place in lymphocytes from approximately 25% of the SCID cultures. These cells were distinguished by the absence of detectable JH gene segments. kappa light chain genes appeared to be unrearranged in SCID cultured lymphocytes. We conclude that the lymphopoietic microenvironments of SCID mice are probably normal, and the animals have infrequent progenitors of B cells. Aberrant or nonproductive IgH gene rearrangements may account for the absence of pre-B and B cells in SCID mice. This study demonstrates the usefulness of long term culture methodology for isolating rare subsets of non-transformed lymphoid cells from normal and genetically defective hemopoietic tissues.\r"

Human BT-20 breast and ME-180 cervix cancer cells were growth-inhibited by rTNF, whereas two other cell lines were not significantly inhibited. However, when protein synthesis was inhibited by cycloheximide, rTNF was cytotoxic for these cells but not for BT-20 cells. This finding suggested that different mechanisms are responsible for the cytostatic and cytotoxic activity of rTNF. The sensitivity of different cell lines to rTNF could not be correlated with a high number or affinity of rTNF receptors. Occupancy of only a few receptors was sufficient for rTNA cytotoxicity, but an increase in receptor number after treatment with interferon-gamma, or a decrease after pretreatment with cycloheximide, correspondingly enhanced or depressed the cytotoxicity of rTNF. It seemed possible that some cells could be protected from this effect of rTNF by synthesizing \"protective\" proteins. While searching for such proteins, we observed that rTNF induced the synthesis of two polypeptides in SK-MEL-109 melanoma cells, but not in other cancer cells. Actinomycin D added with rTNF abolished synthesis of these polypeptides, suggesting that rTNF induced transcription of the corresponding mRNAs. Surprisingly, rTNF stimulated growth of SK-MEL-109 cells cultured in medium with low serum.\r"

  ".W": "Peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) cultured in interleukin 2 (IL 2)-containing medium in conventional tissue culture develop the ability to lyse fresh tumor cells; such cells are referred to as lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells. LAK activity peaks by day 5 of culture and declines rapidly thereafter. We studied culture conditions and signals that allow for long-term culture and expansion of cells with LAK activity. By culturing cells at relatively low densities and regularly replenishing medium and recombinant IL 2 (r-IL 2), LAK function is significantly higher as compared with short-term cultures, and remains present for at least 21 days while cell numbers undergo an average 100-fold expansion. By activating these cultures with anti-CD3 (OKT3) monoclonal antibody and r-IL 2, an approximately 1000-fold expansion in the cell number is obtained with maintenance of comparable levels of LAK activity. The exogenous addition of beta interleukin 1 (beta-IL 1), interferon-beta (IFN-beta) or interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) can augment the lytic activity of cell populations expanded by anti-CD3 plus r-IL 2. These approaches may enable the in vitro generation from individual donors of much greater numbers of LAK cells for adoptive immunotherapy than can now be obtained with the 3 to 5 day in vitro culture systems.\r"

  ".W": "Modulation of protein expression during interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma)-lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-mediated macrophage tumoricidal activation has been examined by metabolic radiolabeling of various murine peritoneal macrophage populations with [35S]methionine followed by SDS-PAGE analysis. Although both IFN-gamma and LPS are capable of stimulating the expression of several proteins when used independently, combined treatment induced the enhanced or de novo expression of a 120,000 dalton polypeptide. The expression of this protein was synergistically regulated by both IFN-gamma and LPS in a manner strongly reminiscent of the functional synergism that these two agents exhibit with respect to induction of tumoricidal activity. p120 expression could be seen first at approximately 3 hr after the addition of both agents, reached optimal expression by 6 hr, and maintained elevated synthesis for up to 24 hr. This time course corresponds closely to that seen for the acquisition of tumoricidal competence. Macrophages elicited in the primed state of activity in vivo with methyl vinyl ether co-polymer II (MVE-II) did not express p120, but could be induced to do so when treated with low doses of LPS. Under similar conditions, MVE-II-elicited cells also acquire tumoricidal activity. Macrophages obtained from mice chronically infected with bacillus Calmette-Guerin constitutively expressed both p120 and cytolytic activity. If such macrophages were cultured for 24 hr, the expression of both events decayed and was lost, but could be restored by treatment with low doses of LPS. Thus the data support a strong correlation between the expression by macrophages of a novel 120,000 dalton protein and the expression of tumor cytotoxicity.\r"

  ".W": "The administration of pyrogenic doses of interleukin 1 (IL-1) to normal mice before contact sensitization with dinitrofluorobenzene (DNFB) resulted in a significant reduction in the intensity of the elicited contact hypersensitivity (CH) responses. Adoptive transfer experiments established no difference between normal and IL-1-pretreated mice regarding their capacity to generate splenic suppressor-cell activity and lymph node effector-cell activity in response to DNFB. However, a marked reduction in the intensity of elicited responses was observed when primed CH-effector cells, obtained from normal donors, were adoptively transferred to IL-1-pretreated recipients. This finding was paralleled by a consistent reduction in the ability of the adoptively transferred cells to infiltrate the tissue sites of antigen challenge in the IL-1-pretreated animals. Treatment of mice with indomethacin, a potent inhibitor of prostaglandin production, abrogated the capacity of IL-1 to depress CH responses following skin sensitization with DNFB. Similarly, indomethacin was also capable of abrogating the ability of IL-1 to depress CH responses of adoptive recipients of primed CH-effector cells. Our results indicate that the capacity of IL-1 to depress CH responses in normal mice is due to an indomethacin-sensitive process, presumably mediated through the IL-1-induced generation and action of prostaglandins. This was supported by our finding that treatment of mice with arachidonic acid or prostaglandin E2 caused a similar type of inhibition. The mechanism(s) responsible for this effect appears to act at the efferent level of the CH response, as evidenced by the reduced capacity of CH-effector cells to infiltrate the tissue sites of antigen challenge.\r"

Within 3-4 h of wounding, keratinocytes began to migrate from the edges and gradually reepithelialized the entire denuded area. Mitomycin C did not prevent the reepithelialization but did dramatically inhibit [3H]thymidine incorporation into the leading edge of cells. These results indicate that cell proliferation was not required for reepithelialization. Using a rabbit antibody against urokinase-type plasminogen activator (u-PA) and an avidin-biotin-peroxidase detection method, we localized u-PA in the keratinocytes at the leading edge of the migrating cultures. Cytochalasin B dramatically inhibited the extent of migration and also altered cell morphology; nonetheless, urokinase was detected in the limited number of cells that moved into the wounded area, even in the presence of cytochalasin B. A small but consistent enhancement (36% +/- 9) of plasminogen activator activity was observed in the supernatant of wounded cultures. These data suggest that plasminogen activator may be involved in the migration of keratinocytes that occurs during wound healing.\r"

Against T. gondii cultured in mouse peritoneal macrophages, 10(-7) M trimetrexate inhibited replication of the organism compared with 10(-6) M pyrimethamine and 10(-4) M trimethoprim. In acutely infected mice, trimetrexate alone prolonged survival and, when combined with sulfadiazine, allowed 93%-100% of mice to survive.

Cytotoxic activity correlated positively with the number of T4 lymphocytes (r = .56, P less than .001) and the amount of IL-2 produced (r = .47, P less than .01) but not with interferon production. Recombinant IL-2, but not gamma interferon, could restore cytotoxic T cell activity to control levels in patients with early HIV infection. EBV-specific serological studies paralleled the T lymphocyte investigations. The increased EBV activity observed in progressive HIV infection may be related to a diminution in the auto-reactive population of the T4 lymphocyte subset and may be amenable to IL-2 reconstitution.\r"

  ".W": "Induction ratios were determined for beta-lactamase-inducible strains of Enterobacter cloacae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa by using 10 beta-lactam agents. For E. cloacae, pre-incubation with ceftriaxone, cefoxitin, cefamandole, cefoperazone, or imipenem produced significantly larger amounts of beta-lactamase than did pre-incubation with moxalactam, clavulanate, ceftazidime, or aztreonam. For P. aeruginosa, imipenem was the best inducer, whereas ceftriaxone, piperacillin, cefoperazone, cefamandole, clavulanate, and aztreonam were poor beta-lactamase inducers. The rate of emergence of resistance by E. cloacae p99 and P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853 did not correlate with the induction ratio of the selecting agent; however, a strong correlation was noted between the mutation rate and the ratio of the MIC to the concentration of selecting antibiotic used. Emergence of resistance is related to the MIC of the antibiotic and the concentration of antibiotic used to select for resistance and is independent of the efficacy of the beta-lactam inducer. Resistant mutants arise through both beta-lactamase-dependent and -independent mechanisms.\r"

Groups of infected animals (14 per group) were treated with a single intravenous infusion of hyperimmune IgG antibody to P. aeruginosa (PA-IGIV; 500 mg/kg), tobramycin (1.7 mg/kg per 8 hr), ticarcillin (120 mg/kg per 6 hr), or combinations of these regimens. Control groups received intravenous albumin solution. Survival rates were 0% with albumin only, 0% with PA-IGIV, 43% with tobramycin (P less than .05), 86% with tobramycin plus PA-IGIV (P less than .05 vs. tobramycin alone), 7% with ticarcillin, and 43% with ticarcillin plus PA-IGIV (.05 less than P less than .10 vs. ticarcillin alone). Additive intrapulmonary killing of P. aeruginosa and prevention of bacteremia were observed in animals treated with tobramycin plus PA-IGIV compared with either treatment alone. Thus, passive immune therapy for P. aeruginosa pneumonia may be useful in the neutropenic host, but only when used in conjunction with antimicrobial agents.\r"

Ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament developed most frequently at C5, and was rare in thoracic and lumbar regions. Ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament led to stenosis of the spinal canal; more marked stenosis caused clinical myelopathy. The data showed that 30% of stenosis caused by ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament was critical for the production of myelopathy.\r"

The PA product for [14C]mannitol at the blood-nerve barrier was increased by 100% in diabetic animals, 3.12 +/- 0.15 X 10(-5) ml X s-1 X g-1, compared with controls, 1.61 +/- 0.10 X 10(-5) ml X s-1 X g-1. In contrast, PA for [14C]mannitol at the blood-brain barrier was unaltered in the diabetic animals. Following intravenous injection, no leakage of microperoxidase across the perineurium or endoneurial vessels of diabetic rats could be demonstrated by morphological techniques. Nerve blood-space, as determined with intravenous [3H]inulin, and blood-nerve barrier surface area as determined by morphometric methods, did not differ in diabetic when compared to control animals. Thus, the calculated permeability coefficient for [14C]mannitol at the blood-nerve barrier was about 100% greater in diabetic nerve compared to control nerves. The increased permeability was accompanied by a 7% increase in nerve-water content and a 32% decrease in motor-nerve conduction velocity. The results demonstrate a specific vulnerability of nerve as compared to brain in an animal model of diabetes mellitus. Chronically altered permeability to small water-soluble molecules reduces the protective effect of salt impermeability at the blood-nerve barrier against nerve edema, and may be an important pathogenic mechanism in diabetic neuropathy.\r"

In the patients treated with chemotherapy, the plasma testosterone levels remained at the lower limit of normal and the luteinizing hormone (LH) levels remained elevated for 2 years after completion of treatment. The follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels also remained significantly elevated, but showed a tendency to decrease after 2 years. Semen analysis was performed in 25 patients; of the other patients, 18 had no antegrade ejaculation, eight had undergone a vasectomy and three patients did not cooperate. Before treatment, 72% of the patients showed azoo- or oligozoospermia; 2 years after discontinuation of the chemotherapy, 48% had azoo- or oligozoospermia while 28% had more than 60 X 10(6) spermatozoa/mL. However, interestingly the proportion of patients with azoospermia had increased from 4% to 28%. In the course of this study, eight pregnancies occurred; one ended in an early spontaneous abortion; the other seven pregnancies ran an uncomplicated course. Seven healthy children were born. In 17 patients with a stage I tumor treated by hemiorchiectomy only, the testosterone, LH and FSH levels were also observed for 2 years; until 2 years after treatment, the testosterone levels remained lower and the FSH levels remained higher than normal. Insufficiency of the Leydig's cells in the unaffected gonad appeared to be responsible for the altered hormone concentrations in the blood.\r"

  ".W": "Hypoxanthine:guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) activity was measured in 14 human osteosarcomas to test whether a subset of these tumors was deficient in the purine salvage pathway enzyme and thus provide a rationale for therapy with methotrexate-thymidine rescue. All tumors contained HPRT activity within the range previously reported for xenografts of human osteosarcoma. Three patients received methotrexate (3.375 g/m2/24 hours) as a 72-hour continuous infusion with thymidine rescue (2.0 g/m2/24 hours) beginning 24 hours after the start of the methotrexate infusion. The methotrexate-thymidine infusion was well tolerated by all patients with no significant toxicity; however, there were no responses. We conclude that osteosarcomas are not deficient in HPRT activity. Therefore, the previously reported rationale for therapy of osteosarcoma with methotrexate-thymidine based on lack of activity of this enzyme is not valid. This combination, although well tolerated, is inconvenient and requires prolonged hospitalization. Therefore, without a valid rationale it cannot be recommended for therapy of patients with osteosarcoma.\r"

Most of the patients with involvement of the upper thoracic spine showed typical features of thoracic myelopathy: that is, sensory and motor deficits in both the trunk and lower extremities, sphincter disturbance, and exaggerated tendon reflexes. Several patients with involvement of the thoracolumbar junction presented with atypical symptoms of thoracic myelopathy and were sometimes misdiagnosed and treated inappropriately. Surgical treatment, particularly laminectomy, was not always successful. Inconsistencies in the surgical outcome were caused by either operative complications or reversal of the initial improvement during the follow-up period. The results of anterior surgery for the condition were more favorable; however, use of this procedure was rarely indicated.\r"

The loss of cell membrane integrity in neural elements became evident within 1 hour after injury as shown by the diffuse albumin-immunoreactivity of the cytoplasm. At the site of mechanical insult, approximately 30% of the neurofilament proteins were degraded within 1 hour, and 70% of them were lost within 4 hours after injury. A large number of cells positive for glial fibrillary acidic protein were found to demarcate the injured tissue within 1 hour after injury. The progression of tissue damage largely subsided within 48 hours. One week after injury, severe degeneration of the ascending tracts in the posterior funiculus was shown clearly by axon staining and less convincingly by myelin staining. Secondary degeneration of the corticospinal tract in distal segments remained inconspicuous for up to 3 months.\r"

  ".W": "Synthesis of mRNA was studied in the spleen and thymus of rats that had been exposed to undernutrition early in life. To achieve this objective, lactating females were separated into two groups 1 wk after they gave birth to offspring. These control and experimental dams suckled 8-11 and 13-16 pups, respectively, for a period of 2 wk. The young of both groups were then killed, and their thymus and spleen were isolated. Polyadenylated RNA (poly A+ RNA) was fractionated by affinity chromatography on an oligo-dT-cellulose column. Poly A+ RNA content as well as the percentage of poly A+ RNA in relation to total RNA were both lower in the undernourished pups than in the controls. Analysis of the in vitro translation product primed by poly A+ RNA of the thymus and spleen revealed a rise in [35S]methionine incorporation in the undernourished offspring, the increase being greater in the thymus than in the spleen. Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis, autoradiography and densitometric autoradiographic tracings confirmed these findings and demonstrated that proteins were synthesized at a higher level in the spleen and thymus of the undernourished rats than in the controls. These results show that undernutrition early in life could modulate the metabolism of mRNA and, consequently, protein synthesis in the lymphoid organs of rats. Furthermore, the data suggest that cell-mediated immunity as well as humoral immunity are both deranged in protein energy undernutrition.\r"

The PO2 generally increased after five deep breaths but was not systematically changed by sitting up. Nineteen patients (37%) had changes in PO2 greater than or equal to 10 mm Hg. The patient's mean PO2 and respiratory rate influenced these differences. Among patients with a mean PO2 less than 85 mm Hg whose respiratory rates were greater than 20/min, only 11% had a change in PO2 greater than or equal to 10 mm Hg. In contrast, among patients with a mean PO2 greater than 85 mm Hg and a respiratory rate less than 20/min, 60% had a change in PO2 greater than or equal to 10 mm Hg. Considerable variability in PO2 is introduced by commonly encountered changes in position and ventilation. These conditions must be standardized when serial blood gas results are used to assess changes in a patient's condition.\r"

Three-day balance studies were begun at days 10, 20, 30, and 40. Calcium net absorption and retention were influenced by postnatal age and calcium intake. Calcium retention best approached intrauterine accretion rates in group C. Phosphorus was well absorbed irrespective of the calcium content of the milk. Phosphorus retention increased with increments in the calcium content of the milk. Increasing the phosphorus content of the milk (groups D and E) resulted in no overall change in calcium absorption and retention but some increments in phosphorus retention.\r"

  ".W": "The ability of atriopeptin II to relax isolated ring segments of the thoracic aorta and renal, mesenteric and carotid arteries was studied in Fischer 344 rats aged 6, 12, 20 and 24 to 27 months. Vessels were precontracted with norepinephrine (aorta, mesenteric and carotid arteries) or serotonin (renal artery) in concentrations that produced approximately 50% of the maximal contractile response. Agonist concentrations used and magnitude of induced tone did not change with age, except in the carotid artery, where tone induced in vessels from the oldest group of animals was significantly greater. Thus it was possible to obtain contractile responses that were relatively stable with age in order to test the effect of age on relaxation responses effectively. There were significant differences in sensitivity to atriopeptin II and maximum relaxation among the vessels studied when comparisons were made within a single age group. Thus the thoracic aorta and carotid artery were more sensitive to atriopeptin II and had greater maximum relaxation responses than the renal and mesenteric arteries. In terms of the influence of age, for the most part neither sensitivity to atriopeptin II nor maximum relaxation response changed with age. However, there were some exceptions. Particularly in the thoracic aorta at several concentrations of atriopeptin II, relaxation in vessels from animals 12 months of age was significantly greater than in the other age groups. This difference is most likely due to an effect of maturation, as there was no further alteration in atriopeptin sensitivity into senescence.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Calcium ionophore (A23187)-stimulated prostaglandin (PG) E2 and I2 (measured as 6-keto PGF1 alpha) release from cultured rabbit coronary microvessel endothelial (RCME) cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner. A23187-stimulated PG release was reduced by the calcium channel blockers nifedipine, verapamil and diltiazem and by the intracellular calcium blocker, 8-(diethylamino)-octyl-3,4,5-trimethoxybenzoate. A23187-stimulated PG release was significantly reduced by lowering the calcium concentration in the buffer to concentrations of 0.2 mM or less. A23187-stimulated 45Ca uptake was not inhibited by nifedipine (0.5 microM), diltiazem (10 micron) or verapamil (50 microM) although these same concentrations of calcium channel blockers significantly inhibited A23187-stimulated PG release. However, these concentrations of calcium blockers did inhibit K+ (10 mM)-valinomycin (5 microM)-stimulated 45Ca uptake, indicating that, although RCME cells probably have voltage-dependent calcium channels and although calcium influx via these channels is blocked by the calcium channel blockers, voltage-dependent calcium influx plays little or no role in A23187-stimulated 45Ca influx and PG release. KCl-valinomycin significantly stimulated PG release, but this increase was not significantly affected by either nifedipine (0.5 microM) or diltiazem (10 microM) despite complete inhibition of KCl-valinomycin-stimulated 45Ca influx. Verapamil (50 microM) exhibited a small but significant suppression of KCl-valinomycin-stimulated PG release. These observations most likely indicate that calcium influx by voltage-dependent calcium channels plays little or no role in the events leading to either A23187- or KCl-valinomycin-stimulated PG release. The calmodulin antagonists, trifluoperazine and calmidazolium, also reduced A23187-stimulated PG release. In vitro studies of porcine pancreatic phospholipase (PL) A2 activity suggested that the inhibitory actions of trifluoperazine, but not the calcium antagonists, may be mediated by direct inhibitory actions on PLA2. Studies with [3H]arachidonic acid (AA)- and [14C]stearic acid-prelabeled RCME cells suggested that A23187 stimulated both PLA2 and PLC activity, leading to the release of AA. Studies with exogenous AA indicated that reducing calcium availability by reducing buffer calcium concentrations resulted in an enhanced conversion of exogenous AA to PGs. RCME cells incubated in nominally calcium-free buffer exhibited a decreased rate of AA incorporation. The observed increase in AA conversion to PGs in low calcium buffer suggests that calcium may stimulate AA uptake and acylation as well as AA release.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Cyclooxygenase inhibition with indomethacin displaced the dose-response curve to AA to the right but did not prevent the relaxant effects of the fatty acid. SKF-525A, an inhibitor of cytochrome P-450-dependent enzymes, also attenuated the response to AA although the combination of SKF-525A and indomethacin prevented any relaxant effect. Induction of cytochrome P-450-dependent enzymes in the coronary artery with 3-methylcholanthrene and beta-naphthoflavone given in vivo (40 mg/kg/day for 3 days) or depletion of these enzymes with cobalt chloride (24 mg/kg/day for 2 days) resulted in an enhancement or diminution, respectively, of AA-induced endothelial-dependent relaxations. These results implicate a cytochrome P-450-dependent mixed function oxidase in the endothelial-dependent relaxations to AA in the canine coronary artery. Precontraction of coronary arteries with U46619 in contrast to dinoprost failed to display endothelial-dependent relaxations to AA, whereas the responses to bradykinin and acetylcholine were also partially attenuated. Pharmacologic manipulations of AA metabolism via cyclooxygenase and cytochrome P-450-dependent monooxygenases indicate that the endothelial-dependent relaxations induced by bradykinin are partially dependent upon metabolites of AA, whereas the relaxations produced by acetylcholine are independent of AA metabolites, suggesting that a number of potential relaxing factors may be released from the endothelium.\r"

  ".U": "87169275\r", 
  ".W": "The relationship between the arterial relaxing, acute and long-term blood pressure lowering effects of atriopeptins were analyzed. We therefore evaluated effects of atriopeptin (103-126), i.e., atriopeptin III, and compared them to those of selected analogs. Atriopeptin (103-126) relaxed isolated aortas (1-30 nM) and lowered systolic blood pressure in conscious spontaneously hypertensive rats when high doses (4-400 nmol/kg i.v.) were administered acutely or low doses (0.4-4.0 nmol/kg/hr i.v.) were administered chronically. The relaxing effect was not affected by amino-terminal extension with up to four amino acids and by carboxy-terminal deletion of one amino acid. Further deletions lowered the relaxing potency. The observed maximal amplitude of the acute blood pressure lowering was reduced drastically by carboxy-terminal deletion of even one amino acid. This was prevented by substitution of the carboxy-terminal acid by an amide. Although not affecting the amplitude, amino-terminal extension with Arg or Arg-Arg prolonged markedly the duration of action of the acute effect. Chronic administration of atriopeptin (103-126), (103-125) and (103-123) affected blood pressure similarly. These findings illustrate different structure-activity relationships for the smooth muscle relaxing, acute and long-term antihypertensive activities of atriopeptins. From this it is suggested that the carboxy-terminal amino acids modulate differently the biological activities of atriopeptins, that amino-terminal amino acids modulate the duration of action of the acute in vivo effects and that the long-term antihypertensive effects of atriopeptins are not related directly to their arterial smooth muscle relaxing and acute blood pressure lowering effects.\r"

Using a neutron activation analysis facility adapted to provide an intensive care environment and tritiated water dilution we directly measured total body water, protein and fat before and after 10 days of IVN (mean daily non-protein energy and amino acid intakes 2,750 kcal and 127 gm) in eight adult intensive care patients. All patients had recovered from the septic shock syndrome but were still ventilator dependent at the start of IVN. Six patients survived to leave hospital. As a group, the patients lost 12.5% of body protein (mean loss 1.5 +/- SE 0.3 kg; p = 0.001) despite a gain in fat (mean 2.2 +/- 0.8 kg; p = 0.026). There were, in addition, large losses of body water in most patients (mean, 6.8 +/- 2.6 kg; p = 0.036). We conclude that substantial losses of body protein occur in critically ill septic patients despite aggressive nutritional support and that further research is urgently required on the fate of infused substrates and the efficacy of alternative nutritional therapies.\r"

Isolated urinary bladder strips were prepared from bladder base and body and the following metabolic determinations were made: glucose utilization, glycogen formation, CO2, and lactic acid formation. In addition, the effect of insulin on glucose metabolism was investigated. Glucose utilization was similar in bladder base and body (6.57 +/- 0.67 mumols/gm./2 hours in combined tissues). Eighty-one percent of the glucose utilized was metabolized to lactate whereas 11% was oxidized to CO2 and 4.7% was incorporated into glycogen. Insulin caused a small but significant increase in glucose utilization by bladder strips.\r"

No statistically significant differences were found between cases and controls in their mean intake of total fat, saturated fat, oleic acid, linoleic acid, animal protein, and cholesterol.

Consistent with other case-control studies, the present investigation did not provide strong support for the hypothesis that a high-fat diet is a risk factor for breast cancer. Further work is suggested to clarify the role of diet in determining breast cancer risk.\r"

While these factors are consistent with a role for N-nitroso compounds in the etiology of these tumors, for several other factors related to this hypothesis, no association was observed. Occupation in the rubber industry was associated with a significant relative risk of 9.0, though no other occupational associations were seen. Two previously unreported associations were with smoking nonfilter cigarettes with a significant trend and with the use of hair dyes or sprays. The data do not support an association between physical head trauma requiring medical attention and risk of brain tumors and indicate that exposure to ionizing radiation and vinyl chloride monomer does not contribute any appreciable fraction of attributable risk in the population studied. The findings warrant further detailed investigation in future epidemiologic studies.\r"

  ".W": "For examination of the effect of a low-fat diet on serum estrogen, progesterone, and gonadotropin levels, 16 patients with cystic breast disease and cyclic mastalgia were studied before dietary intervention and at 2 and 3 months thereafter. Four-day food diaries indicated that total fat intake was reduced from a prediet average of 69 g (35% of total kilocalories/day) to an average of 32 g (21% of total kilocalories) after 3 months. Highly significant reductions (P less than .001) occurred in dietary cholesterol and less changes occurred in protein and total kilocalorie consumption (P less than .05); fiber intakes were not affected. After 3 months on this low-fat diet, there were significant reductions in luteal-phase serum total estrogens (P less than .001), estrone (P less than .005), and estradiol (P less than .01); progesterone, luteinizing hormone, and follicle-stimulating hormone levels were unchanged. Two of the 16 patients were excluded from the hormone statistical analyses because the serum progesterone levels were not consistent with sampling in the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. It is concluded that a reduction of dietary fat intake to 20% of the total kilocalories will result in significant decreases in circulating estrogens in benign breast disease patients and that this effect is achievable without increasing dietary fiber consumption. Absence of changes in serum progesterone and gonadotropins during the dietary intervention is consistent with altered enterohepatic circulation of estrogens rather than with effects on the pituitary-ovarian axis.\r"

  ".W": "Total cancer deaths were not increased among 2,074 women and 1,277 men who were fluoroscopically examined an average of 73 and 91 times, respectively, during lung-collapse therapy for tuberculosis (TB). Patients who did not receive this form of therapy (2,141 women and 1,418 men) and general population rates were used for comparison. All subjects were discharged alive from eight TB sanatoria in Massachusetts between 1930 and 1954; the average follow-up was 23 years. Deaths due to breast cancer were not increased among exposed females [standardized mortality ratio (SMR) = 1.0, n = 24], and SMRs greater than 2.1 could be excluded with 95% confidence. In contrast to other series, our inability to detect a breast cancer excess was likely due to lower breast doses (66 rad) and higher average ages at exposure (28 yr) and thus lower sensitivity. A deficit of lung cancer among exposed males and females was observed (SMR = 0.8, n = 26), even though increased risks have been observed among other populations exposed to similar dose levels. The estimated average lung dose was 91 rad, and SMRs greater than 1.2 for lung cancer could be excluded with 95% confidence. Overall, this study indicates that the radiation hazard of multiple low-dose exposures experienced over many years is not greater than currently accepted estimates for breast and lung cancer. For lung cancer the radiogenic risk may be less than predicted from high-dose, single-exposure studies.\r"

Ever drinking alcohol was not associated with any substantial increase in risk [odds ratio (OR) = 1.1; 95% confidence interval (Cl) = 1.0-1.3], but there was a significant trend in risk with increasing average weekly intake (P less than .04). Women who had one or fewer drinks daily (83% of all drinkers) did not experience any excess risk compared to nondrinkers, but significant excess risks were observed among those who drank from 1 to 2 (OR = 1.3; 95% Cl = 1.0-1.7) or more than 2 (OR = 1.7; 95% Cl = 1.2-2.4) drinks a day. An increased risk associated with alcohol consumption was evident only for those who drank at younger ages (less than 30 yr), regardless of current consumption. Alcohol effects were adjusted for a variety of factors, including reproductive history, were adjusted for a variety of factors, including reproductive history, socioeconomic indicators, and obesity, but none exerted any appreciable confounding influence. The results support an association between moderate alcohol consumption in early life and subsequent breast cancer risk, although interpretation should be cautious in the absence of dietary information.\r"

  ".W": "Hepatocytes were isolated from noninbred Sprague-Dawley rats previously fed diets containing 7.5 or 15% protein. These hepatocytes were incubated in the presence of exogenous DNA for examination of their ability to metabolize 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene [(DMBA) CAS: 57-97-6] and release reactive DNA-binding metabolites to the medium. An increased formation of extracellular water-soluble metabolites of DMBA was observed in hepatocyte cultures from rats fed a 15% protein diet compared with that in cells from rats fed 7.5% protein. As dietary protein increased, there was a reduction in the release of DNA-binding metabolites by isolated hepatocytes. Bay-region dihydrodiol-epoxide adducts were formed with extracellular calf thymus DNA and hepatic DNA. However, most of the binding of DMBA with extracellular and intracellular DNA was due to unidentified DMBA-DNA adducts that eluted, upon reversed-phase chromatography, after the bay-region dihydrodiol-epoxide DMBA adducts were formed. The present studies show that feeding animals diets that are limiting in protein results in a decrease in DMBA detoxification and an increase in excretion of reactive DMBA metabolites from the liver. These results may explain the previously observed influence of dietary protein on the initiation of DMBA-induced mammary carcinogenesis in the rat.\r"

  ".W": "Measures related to red cell oxygen transport were evaluated in 17 hemodialysis patients receiving androgen therapy, 15 untreated hemodialysis patients and 15 normal subjects. Hemoglobin levels were higher in androgen-treated patients than in the untreated population and were directly related to the reticulocyte index. Hill coefficients were normal, and in vivo P5O values were increased to the same degree in both dialysis groups. However, DPG and serum phosphate explained 70% and 12%, respectively, of the variance in P5O in untreated patients but only 2% and 5% in androgen-treated subjects. In contrast, sample pH explained 34% of the variance in P5O in the androgen-treated group and less than 1% in the untreated dialysis population. Despite the relative importance of pH as a determinant of P5O in patients on androgen therapy, the Bohr coefficient in this group was only about half of that in untreated dialysis subjects. Androgen-treated patients also had lower red cell ATP levels. Finally, the expected correlation of MCHC with pH was noted in untreated dialysis subjects but not in patients receiving androgens. We conclude that androgen therapy in hemodialysis patients in addition to increasing red cell production, directly alters red cell metabolism. Moreover, although the androgen regimens used did not change the net oxygen transport characteristics of hemoglobin, they decreased the responsiveness of hemoglobin-oxygen affinity to changes in pH, DPG and phosphate. Thus, red cell adaptation to changes in oxygen supply and/or demand may be limited in androgen treated patients, and the improvement in clinical performance expected from androgen-stimulated erythropoiesis may not be realized.\r"

This phenomenon was believed to be due to immunologic cross reactivity between THP and the bacterial antigens for the same antibody. Our attempts to further purify and characterize these \"cross reactive\" antigens with ion exchange and molecular sieve chromatography were unsuccessful. When purified anti-THP antibody was conjugated to sepharose beads forming an immunoadsorption column capable of isolating THP and cross reactive antigens from solution, the bacterial extracts did not react with the affinity column. However, binding between THP and the bacterial extracts and between THP and whole bacteria were demonstrated. These findings suggest that the cross reactivity seen in the immunoassays is caused by the interaction between the bacterial extracts and THP, and is not representative of true immunologic cross reaction for a common antibody.\r"

  ".W": "The standard surgical lasers, argon ion, neodymium-yttrium aluminum garnet, and carbon dioxide, are often operated as continuous wave lasers with specific uses. Clinical trials of laser therapy for arteriosclerotic cardiovascular disease are underway with all three lasers. Therefore, we compared these three lasers under controlled experimental conditions. A thoracoabdominal exploration was performed in 17 arteriosclerotic rabbits. The aorta was isolated, heparin administered, and multiple endarterectomies were performed in each rabbit with each of the lasers. A line of laser craters was created at the proximal and distal ends of an atheroma. Continuous-wave laser radiation was used to connect the craters and thereby form proximal and distal end points. The plaques were dissected free from the aorta with laser light and the end points were fused by laser. The aortas were removed for light microscopy and the animals were killed. The endarterectomy surfaces and end points were serially sectioned and graded according to light microscopic findings (1 = worst, 4 = best). Argon ion laser endarterectomy (N = 16) required 106 +/- 10 J/cm2. The surface score was 3.5 and end point score 3.4. Neodymium-yttrium aluminum garnet laser endarterectomy (N = 13) required 1,289 +/- 115 J/cm2 with a surface score of 2.4 (p less than 0.001 from argon ion) and an end point score of 1.3 (p less than 0.001 from argon ion). Carbon dioxide laser endarterectomy (N = 9) required 30 +/- 5J/cm2 with a surface score of 2.0 (p less than 0.001 from argon ion) and and end point score of 1.6 (p less than 0.001 from argon ion). Perforation occurred in one of 16 argon ion studies (technical error, not laser), in 11 of 13 neodymium-yttrium aluminum garnet studies, and in six of nine carbon dioxide studies. This study demonstrates that of the currently available clinical continuous-wave lasers, the argon ion laser is superior for endarterectomy of experimental atheromas.\r"

  ".W": "A total of 284 patients undergoing myocardial revascularization were prospectively studied to determine if the use of intraoperative autotransfusion or intraoperative autotransfusion plus postoperative reinfusion of shed mediastinal blood decreased transfusion requirements and the use of one or both techniques was cost effective. The Haemonetics Cell Saver System was used for intraoperative autotransfusion and the Sorenson Receptaseal autotransfusion system for postoperative reinfusion of shed mediastinal blood. During Phase 1, the Cell Saver System was used for 57 patients and 93 patients served as a control group. During Phase 2, the Cell Saver System plus the autotransfusion system were used in 43 patients and 91 patients were in the control group. Separate parallel analyses to compare the blood conservation groups to control groups were conducted for each phase of the study. The patient groups were comparable with regard to age, sex, preoperative red cell mass, preoperative hematocrit value, number of bypasses, and use of internal mammary grafts. Blood conservation techniques resulted in significant reductions in the use of bank blood. During Phase 1, Cell Saver System patients received an average of 2.8 units of packed cells versus 4.7 units for control patients. Transfusion was avoided entirely in 14% of Cell Saver System patients compared to 3% of control patients. During Phase 2, patients subjected to both the Cell Saver System and the autotransfusion system received an average of 1 unit of packed red cells versus 3 units for control patients. Transfusion was required in only 42% of patients subjected to both the Cell Saver System and the autotransfusion system compared to 85% of control patients. Multiple logistic regression analysis confirmed that the use of the Cell Saver System in Phase 1 and the Cell Saver System and autotransfusion system in Phase 2 were each independently predictive of decreased transfusion requirements. The total \"blood-related costs\" (including cost for all bank blood products plus Receptaseal and Cell Saver System equipment) was slightly lower for the blood conservation patients in both Phase 1 ($555.00 versus $615.00, no significant difference) and Phase 2 ($373.00 versus $426.00, no significant difference). Intraoperative use of the Cell Saver System is associated with substantial savings of bank blood, and the addition of postoperative reinfusion of shed mediastinal blood results in further bank blood savings. The use of blood conservation techniques is cost effective; that is, the costs incurred for the blood conservation equipment are more than offset by the resultant dollar savings for blood products.\r"

In 200 consecutive patients with a pericardial defect after open heart operations, the pericardium was closed with a glutaraldehyde-preserved equine pericardial patch. Precardiac adhesions at reoperation were assessed in four groups of patients on a scale of 6, ranging from 0 (no adhesions) to 5 (calcified or ossified adhesions). Group I comprised 13 patients in whom the pericardium was left open at the first operation and an equine pericardial patch was implanted at reoperation. Group Ia included the first five Group I patients who underwent reoperation less than 1 year (early reoperation) after the initial procedure. Group Ib included the other eight patients of Group I, who underwent reoperation more than 1 year (late reoperation) after the first procedure. Group II comprised nine patients who were reoperated on after reconstruction of the pericardial sac with a glutaraldehyde-preserved equine pericardial patch. After a mean follow-up of 20.2 months, the incidence of patch-related complications was 1%. Statistical analysis shows less severe adhesions on reoperation in Group II patients (pericardial defect patched) than in Group I patients (pericardial defect left open): mean grade of adhesions 1.6 +/- 0.9 (Group II) versus 3.2 +/- 0.6 (Group I), p less than 0.001. Precardial adhesions with the pericardium left open were similar in patients having early and late reoperations: mean grade of adhesions 3.0 +/- 0.7 (Group Ia) versus 3.4 +/- 0.5 (Group Ib), no significant difference. Therefore, the glutaraldehyde-preserved equine pericardial patch can be considered a suitable material for primary closure of the pericardial sac in patients with inadequate autologous pericardium.\r"
