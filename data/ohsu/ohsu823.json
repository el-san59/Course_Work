The age-adjusted average annual incidence rates per 100,000 population were 217 for men and 370 for women (adjusted rates were 255 and 276, respectively). Incidence rates increased with age in both sexes, but more rapidly so for men, so that by 70 years of age the rate for men was higher than that for women. For the decades covered in this study, no secular trend in incidence was detected for the two sexes combined or separately.\r"

A representative sample of 1876 men and women aged 50 to 65 years living in a northern California community were interviewed to examine factors related to gender differences in quit rates in this age group. In this well-educated community, a significantly greater percentage of women (25.6%) continued to smoke relative to men (18.6%), with a greater percentage of men reporting being former smokers. Multivariate analysis revealed educational level and marital status, rather than gender, to be significant, Independent factors associated both with current cigarette use and with successful quitting. Our data indicate that it is not being female per se, but rather the disparities in educational level and marital status that are linked with being an older woman, that are associated with continued smoking in this age group. In light of this, delivery of relevant information and support on the part of physicians and other health professionals may be of particular use to this population segment.\r"

According to clinical, roentgenographic, and functional criteria, the patients were classified in one of three stages at admission as well as at least 1 year later. Digital clubbing was retrospectively recorded as present or absent by physical examination. Our results showed that 44 patients (51%) included in this study presented clubbing at the time of diagnosis. Sixteen of these patients presented with worsening of their lung disease, whereas only 5 of the 38 patients without clubbing incurred a worsening of their condition. This finding suggests that digital clubbing is frequent in pigeon breeder's disease and may help to predict clinical deterioration.\r"

Little is known about the strategies employed by practicing physicians who find enjoyment and satisfaction in their work. We conducted an open-ended survey about how a group of physicians cope with common dilemmas they face today such as mistakes, death, self-care, uncertainty, patient demands, and time demands. We describe the techniques employed by those who felt they were effectively coping. Responses were organized into five general requirements for personal growth: (1) self-awareness, (2) sharing of feelings and responsibilities, (3) self-care, (4) developing a personal philosophy, and (5) nontraditional coping skills of reframing and limit setting. General descriptions of these requirements are followed by tables of specific examples from the survey. The application of these strategies to the dilemmas cited above are presented. These descriptive findings emphasize the need for training programs and governing bodies to incorporate strategies for physicians' personal growth into their priorities. The five basic areas described herein can provide a framework for formal attention to physicians' personal development.\r"

Three of the patients had axial skeleton involvement, and one had disease of the femur.

The underlying granulomatous infection was initially revealed in one patient by histologic examination of bone and in three others only by mycobacterial culture of bone. Concomitant osseous tuberculosis should be excluded in patients with staphylococcal osteomyelitis. Evaluation using a bone protocol with histologic study and culture on Lowenstein-Jensen medium is effective in diagnosing occult osseous tuberculosis.\r"

  ".W": "Inexperienced physicians may make prognostic judgments and management decisions about acutely ill patients in the absence of supervision. We hypothesized that mathematically combining judgments of junior and senior house officers might yield aggregate judgments as good as those made by experienced critical care attending physicians. We obtained independent quantitative assessments of the likelihood of in-hospital survival for 269 sequential intensive care unit admissions from the patient's intern or resident and the critical care fellow and attending physician on duty within 24 hours of admission, and compared these judgements with mortality data. By logistic regression, the residents' and fellows' judgments added independent prognostic information to each other (likelihood ratio chi 2, 7.6; df = 1). The junior house officers' and fellows' assessments were significantly less reliable than the attending physicians' by calibration curves, and by Brier scores, 0.126 and 0.127 vs 0.119. All physicians had good discriminating ability (receiver operating characteristic areas [SE] were 0.83 [0.03], 0.85 [0.03], 0.86 [0.03], respectively). A simple average of the residents' and fellows' judgments was slightly but significantly more reliable by calibration curve and by Brier score, 0.117, and as discriminating (ROC area = 0.85, SE = 0.03) as the attending physicians' judgments. Nonmedical studies have shown that averaging independent judgments may compensate for people's tendency to make extreme estimates, and may take advantage of their complementary abilities. This first medical application of this technique suggests that this form of voting by secret ballot may prove useful for health care teams making other judgments and decisions.\r"

All subjects filled out a questionnaire that measured psychological/emotional stress in six areas: physical health, relations with friends, relations with family, relations with sex partner(s), financial, and vocation/education. These questionnaires were mailed back to us daily. Data were analyzed by General Linear Models analysis of variance to compare stress reported on each of the 6 days before a recurrence with that on days during or after a recurrence, as well as days not temporally related to recurrence. Under these conditions, in which retrospective bias was minimized, there was no significant increase in psychological/emotional stress on any day in any area preceding a recurrence of genital herpes simplex virus.\r"

Many clinicians are cautious about providing information that may bias test interpretation and result in the decreased utility of the test. We quantitatively assessed the effect of clinical information on electrocardiogram (ECG) interpretation of acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Three cardiologists were asked to give independent written interpretations of 52 ECGs devoid of clinical information. Three weeks later, the same set of ECGs was reinterpreted with clinical information that was either strongly or mildly suggestive of AMI. Of the 156 pooled ECGs, 22 changes (14%) in interpretation with the addition of clinical information were made. Eleven (50%) of the changes were from negative to positive, and 11 were from positive to negative. Changes in interpretation were not affected by the nature of the clinical information or by whether the ECG was typical for AMI. No significant changes in the sensitivity or specificity with the addition of clinical information were present. This study did not demonstrate the anticipated effect of clinical information on the ECG interpretation of AMI. Interpretation of other tests may also be unaffected by the provision of clinical information.\r"

Before the onset of illness, each case-patient had received a series of injections of human chorionic gonadotropin administered by jet injectors at clinic 1. Clinical history, risk factor assessment, serologic evaluation, and review of clinic injection records were obtained on 287 (84%) of 341 persons who had attended clinic 1 in the first 6 months of 1985. Of this cohort, 21% (60/287) had evidence of acute infection with hepatitis B virus (either documented clinical cases or antibody to hepatitis B core antigen, IgM positive). Of persons who had been given human chorionic gonadotropin at the clinic during the period studied, 24% (57/239) of those receiving human chorionic gonadotropin only by jet injector experienced acute hepatitis B virus infection. None of the 22 persons who had received injections only by syringe experienced hepatitis B virus infection. Stopping the use of the jet injectors on July 2, 1985, at clinic 1, was associated with the termination of this outbreak. This investigation demonstrated that jet injectors can become contaminated with hepatitis B virus and then may be vehicles for its transmission.\r"

To determine the relationship between clinical criteria (symptoms and signs) and three causes of vaginitis, we prospectively evaluated 22 criteria in 123 unselected symptomatic patients. Diagnoses of Candida albicans and Trichomonas vaginalis infection were based on culture. Bacterial vaginosis was defined by the presence of 3 of 4 clinical criteria. Only 49% of our patients received diagnoses, and itching was the only symptom more frequently noted among those with diagnoses. Symptoms did not differ among the three infections, and lack of vaginal odor in yeast infection was the only significantly different physical sign. Yeast and trichomonads were seen on microscopy in 63% and 75% of culture-positive specimens. Bacterial vaginosis had no significant clinical criteria beyond those that defined the diagnosis. We conclude that presenting symptoms and signs in vaginitis evaluation have limited value, and that half of the women with vaginitis may lack a microbiologic diagnosis.\r"

Lovastatin, a potent inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, has been shown to have a cholesterol-lowering effect in doses ranging from 10 to 80 mg/d. Thus far, however, no large study has been performed to show the effectiveness of low-dose lovastatin (20 mg/d) for more than a 6-week duration. Fifty-six patients with known coronary artery disease were prospectively studied, with fasting lipid values being measured at baseline and after 6, 12, 18, and 24 weeks of 20-mg/d lovastatin therapy given as a single evening dose. The total cholesterol level fell 26% from a mean baseline of 8.12 mmol/L (314 mg/dL) and triglyceride levels fell by 12% from a mean baseline of 2.46 mmol/L. The high-density lipoprotein levels increased 7.6%. One patient with known preexisting liver disease was withdrawn from the study owing to an asymptomatic significant rise in liver function test results; one subject complaining of proximal muscle weakness was also withdrawn. The maximal decrease in total cholesterol level occurred within 6 weeks of initiation of therapy. We conclude that low-dose (20-mg/d) lovastatin was effective in lowering serum cholesterol levels in patients with primary type IIa or IIb hyperlipoproteinemia with minimal short-term side effects. Further studies are needed to establish the long-term safety and effectiveness of this drug.\r"

The FMC rose from 810 +/- 39 (SEM) mg/cm at baseline to 841 +/- 41 mg/cm after 2 years of treatment, representing a mean bone mineral gain of 1.9% per year. The majority of this bone gain occurred during the first 6 months of treatment. The rate of increase in FMC in the first 6 months was +3.71 +/- 0.12 mg/cm per month compared with -0.35 +/- 0.51 mg/cm per month during the second year. Fat-corrected FMC was measured to determine whether the bone gain was real or reflected a decrease in fat mass. There was a similar rise in fat-corrected FMC (from 885 +/- 36 mg/cm at baseline to 909 +/- 39 mg/cm at 2 years). The difference between fat-corrected and uncorrected FMC, however, decreased slightly on norethindrone treatment (from 75.2 +/- 11.9 mg/cm at baseline to 67.8 +/- 11.8 mg/cm at 12 months), indicating a reduction in the subcutaneous fat layer. We conclude that norethindrone therapy in postmenopausal women with mild primary hyperparathyroidism produces a gain in bone mass that is sustained for at least 2 years.\r"

Of the 338 (90%) who responded to a follow-up questionnaire at 3 months, 8 (7%) in the desirable, 23 (22%) in the borderline, and 44 (50%) in the high group had been to see physicians concerning their cholesterol levels since the screening. In multiple logistic regression analyses only cholesterol category at time of screening, current use of antihypertensive drugs, history of coronary heart disease, and history of a high cholesterol level were associated with physician follow-up.

  ".W": "In a previous report, we demonstrated a strong association between panic disorder and suicide attempts based on data from the Epidemiologic Catchment Area study (a probability sample of more than 18,000 adults living in five US communities). In these analyses, although we controlled statistically for comorbidity of panic disorder with other psychiatric disorders, we did not directly estimate the risk of suicide attempts in persons with uncomplicated panic disorder (ie, without any other Axis I disorders) compared with those with comorbid conditions. Persons with uncomplicated panic disorder represent fewer than a third of persons with panic disorder. However, the lifetime rates of suicide attempts in persons with uncomplicated panic disorder (7%) were consistently higher than for persons with no psychiatric disorder (1%). Similar findings on the rate of suicide attempts in persons with uncomplicated major depression (7.9%) emerged. We conclude that suicide attempts are associated with panic disorder in its uncomplicated or its comorbid form and that the risks are comparable with those of major depression, comorbid and uncomplicated. These epidemiologic findings are discussed within a clinical perspective to explain why these associations may not appear obvious in clinical practice.\r"

Although they remained symptomatic, most subjects with panic disorder reported relatively little distress or social maladjustment. The course of panic disorder was characterized by fluctuating anxiety and depressive symptoms. Panic subtypes (uncomplicated, limited phobic avoidance, and extensive phobic avoidance) and Axis I and II comorbidity (major depression and personality disorders) were highly predictive of symptoms and social adjustment after 3 years. Abnormal personality was, in fact, the strongest predictor of social maladjustment in both subjects with panic disorder and controls. The results showed that while panic disorder has a favorable outcome, the illness is a chronic one that may require continuing treatment. They also show that subtypes and comorbid disturbances are important predictors of outcome.\r"

Compulsive personality disorder was diagnosed in only 6 patients (6%), 5 of whom had had onset of obsessive-compulsive symptoms before the age of 10 years, indicating that DSM-III compulsive personality disorder is not invariably a premorbid condition for the development of obsessive-compulsive disorder. Schizotypal personality disorder, at 5%, was found to be less common than in past samples, reflecting differences in either assessment methods or sampling.\r"

Eight patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder scanned previously were scanned again during treatment with the tricyclic antidepressant clomipramine hydrochloride. Comparisons of local cerebral glucose metabolic rates for both groups showed a relative decrease in regions of the orbital frontal cortex and the left caudate, and an increase in other areas of the basal ganglia, including the right anterior putamen. When comparing patients who responded well to clomipramine with those who were either poor or partial responders, we found significant decreases only in the left caudate of patients who responded well to the drug. The present study suggests that clomipramine-induced improvement in obsessive-compulsive symptoms is associated with a return of regional brain metabolism to a more normal level in regions of the orbital frontal cortex and the caudate nucleus.\r"

The prevalence of migraine of 13.3% approximates estimates from previous epidemiologic studies in other regions of the world. Consistent with previous reports, there was a strong association between migraine and depression. However, this is the first study to demonstrate this association in an unselected epidemiologic sample with standardized assessment of psychiatric diagnoses by direct interview. The association between migraine and the anxiety disorders was even stronger than that for the affective disorders. The combination of anxiety disorder and major depression, but not pure anxiety disorders, nor pure depression, were significantly associated with migraine. Our data suggest that migraine with anxiety and depression may constitute a distinct syndrome comprising anxiety, often manifested in early childhood, followed by the occurrence of migraine headaches, and then by discrete episodes of depressive disorder in adulthood. Because of the prospective longitudinal design of this study, future assessments of this cohort will provide further information on the stability of these findings and the course of this cohort as subjects proceed through adulthood.\r"

There was a high concordance (45 of 53 patients) of direction of self-reported weight change during the two episodes. Twenty-three patients lost weight during both episodes, 17 gained weight, and 5 showed no change. The extent of weight change between the two episodes was highly correlated. Self-reported weight change corresponded closely to measured weight changes in a large sample of the study population. Changes in appetite paralleled those in body weight. Duration of the episode and body mass index were related to the weight change, but two features of depression with which weight loss in depression has been associated (the endogenous character of the depression and it severity) were not. Direction and extent of weight change in unipolar depression appear to be stable patient characteristics across episodes and are thus potential markers for subtypes of depression. This stability of weight change is in sharp contrast to the lack of stability of the endogenous subtype in consecutive episodes of major depression.\r"

For comparison, we examined 10 nonaddicted control subjects. There were no significant differences between cocaine addicts and controls regarding demographics and selected DSM-III-R diagnoses other than psychoactive substance use disorder and antisocial personality disorder. There were significantly higher scores of psychiatric symptoms reported by cocaine addicts 1 week before admission. Mood-distress and depression scores recorded at admission and during short-term abstinence were significantly greater than those reported by controls. Addicts' mood-distress scores and craving for cocaine were greatest at admission and decreased gradually and steadily during the 28-day study. There were no significant differences between groups regarding reports of sleep other than difficulty falling asleep and clearheadedness on arising. Although there were significant differences in resting heart rate at admission and over time, there were no significant differences in weight gain or blood pressure. Given the absence of a classic \"withdrawal\" pattern, \"short-term abstinence\" may be a more appropriate classification of psychological and physical phenomena experienced by cocaine addicts who initiate abstinence in a controlled environment.\r"

The relationship between fetal exposure to influenza and adult schizophrenia was examined. It is possible that unknown factors produce excesses of both influenza and schizophrenia in the winter, creating an artifactual association. To control for this coincidence, the effects of season were removed from the monthly influenza and schizophrenic birth-rates by several methods. Using the residual scores, it was found that influenza rates higher than seasonally expected, occurring in the sixth month of gestation, were associated with rates of births of schizophrenics greater than seasonally expected. This association was not attributable to some winter-related, third factor or to climatic variables.\r"

The risk of death from suicide was not found to differ significantly between King County and the Vancouver area (relative risk, 0.97; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.87 to 1.09). The rate of suicide by firearms, however, was higher in King County (relative risk, 2.34; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.90 to 2.88), because the rate of suicide by handguns was 5.7 times higher there. The difference in the rates of suicide by firearms was offset by a 1.5-fold higher rate of suicide by other means in the Vancouver area. Persons 15 to 24 years old had a higher suicide rate in King County than in the Vancouver area (relative risk, 1.38; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.02 to 1.86). Virtually all the difference was due to an almost 10-fold higher rate of suicide by handguns in King County. We conclude that restricting access to handguns might be expected to reduce the suicide rate in persons 15 to 24 years old, but that it probably would not reduce the overall suicide rate.\r"

The subjects comprised 21 controls with disorders other than coeliac disease and 23 patients (14 treated, 9 untreated) with coeliac disease diagnosed by strict jejunal biopsy gold standard criteria. There was no difference between the groups in IEL numbers before challenge. Coeliac disease patients but not controls responded to FF3 with a rise in mucosal IEL (median 60.5% rise for treated, 63.0% for untreated). There was no response to challenge with beta-lactoglobulin in coeliac disease or control subjects. When a predefined, post-challenge IEL \"predictive index\" of more than 10% above baseline was used to indicate a diagnosis of coeliac disease, it gave a sensitivity of 90% and specificity of 91% (95% confidence intervals 78-93%). Rectal gluten challenge is a simple, safe, and reliable test of gluten sensitivity, both as a screening test for untreated coeliac disease and as a confirmatory test in patients with treated coeliac disease.\r"

The process is mediated by an integral membrane protein of relative molecular mass 180,000 (Mr 180K), having a large (at least 160K) cytosolic domain that, when proteolytically detached from the membrane, can competitively inhibit the binding of ribosomes to intact membranes. Isolation of this domain has led to the identification, purification and characterization of the intact ribosome receptor, as well as its functional reconstitution into lipid vesicles.\r"

  ".W": "The usefulness of a reduction in ST segment elevation to predict coronary reperfusion in myocardial infarction remains uncertain. ST segment changes and angiographic findings were compared in 45 patients soon after thrombolysis. The percentage ST segment change 3 hours after treatment (in the lead showing the greatest initial ST elevation) was compared with the TIMI perfusion grade (thrombolysis in myocardial infarction trial) obtained between 90 minutes and 3 hours after treatment. Global ejection fraction and regional wall motion were assessed by cineventriculography (11 (5) days (mean (SD))) and by gated blood pool imaging (44 (11) days). Prediction of coronary patency by a reduction of greater than 25% in ST segment elevation 3 hours after thrombolytic treatment had a sensitivity of 97% but a specificity of only 43%. Where the ST segment elevation was reduced by greater than 25% the global ejection fraction was well maintained whether or not the infarct vessel was patent. In patients with a reduction of less than 25% in ST elevation, the ejection fraction was significantly lower and regional wall motion abnormality more severe. Reduction in ST elevation of greater than 25% within 3 hours of thrombolysis indicates either a patent infarct artery or preservation of left ventricular function. When the ST segment elevation does not fall by greater than 25% persistent coronary occlusion is likely (predictive accuracy 86%) and is associated with a lower ejection fraction. These patients may benefit from further treatment or additional interventions.\r"

  ".W": "The hypothesis that the prognosis of cardiogenic shock patients is primarily dependent on cardiac pumping reserve was tested in a prospective study of 28 consecutive patients clinically diagnosed to be in cardiogenic shock and treated medically. Haemodynamic function was assessed by thermodilution Swan-Ganz catheters and arterial cannulas. The cardiac pumping reserve was evaluated by the response of the failing heart to graded incremental dobutamine infusion (2.5 to 40 micrograms/kg/min) after optimalising the left ventricular preload. Eleven of the patients survived for more than the one year of follow up and the rest died. Haemodynamic evaluation during the basal resting state was only able to identify unambiguously non-survivors whose cardiac function was most severely compromised. Survivors and non-survivors with higher values were indistinguishable by basal haemodynamic criteria. The response to dobutamine stimulation clearly separated the cardiac pump function of survivors and those who died. All patients with peak cardiac power output of less than 1.0 W or peak left ventricular stroke work index of less than 0.25 J/m2 died whereas all those with higher values lived for more than a year. Thus this study showed that haemodynamic evaluation of cardiac reserve can provide objective criteria for predicting outcome in individual patients with cardiogenic shock. The availability of such a prognostic indicator will be invaluable in formulating management plans for these patients.\r"

  ".U": "90366143\r", 
  ".W": "Transmitral flow velocities were measured by Doppler echocardiography in nine healthy men who ingested 1 g/kg of ethanol within one hour. The measurements were made before the first drink and every hour thereafter for three hours. The peak mean (SE) blood ethanol concentration was 21.4 (1.0) mmol/l. Each man was also studied after drinking fruit juice. Ethanol increased the heart rate but did not change the peak transmitral velocities, the normalised peak filling rate, the deceleration of early flow, or the duration of relaxation as measured from the second heart sound to the peak early diastolic velocity. The ratio of the peak atrial to the peak early diastolic velocity rose from 0.41 (0.03) to 0.44 (0.03) after ethanol but remained unchanged after juice. The difference between juice and ethanol was independent of changes in heart rate. The fluid balance was more negative in the ethanol experiment (-727 (114) ml v -107 (70) ml), suggesting a reduction in preload, and the ethanol-induced net loss of fluid correlated with the concomitant change in the velocity ratio. A moderate dose of ethanol causes a small acute increase of the ratio of the peak atrial to the peak early diastolic velocity of mitral flow in healthy subjects. Although this change indicates altered diastolic function of the left ventricle, most of it may result from the diuretic effect of ethanol. Any major impairment of ventricular relaxation seems unlikely.\r"

  ".W": "Indices of the severity of coarctation derived from non-invasive Doppler echocardiography were compared with measurements derived from cardiac catheterisation and angiography. In 24 Doppler studies from 17 children instantaneous peak systolic and diastolic gradients and time to half peak systolic and diastolic velocities were compared with the ratio of the coarctation diameter to the diameter of descending aorta at the level of diaphragm obtained from angiographic systolic frames of the aorta. A high peak systolic gradient (greater than 40 mm Hg) or long time to half peak diastolic velocity (greater than 100 ms) (that is, maintenance of flow in diastole) were both highly specific (100%) in detecting coarctation of the aorta where the angiographic ratio was less than or equal to 0.5. Diastolic measurements, however, were more sensitive (79% both for peak diastolic gradient and for time to half peak diastolic velocity) than systolic (57% for peak systolic gradient and 64% for time to half peak systolic velocity). Even higher sensitivity (93%) was obtained when the peak systolic gradient was greater than 40 mm Hg or the time to half peak diastolic velocity was greater than 100 ms. Examination by continuous wave Doppler echocardiography is an effective non-invasive method of assessing the severity of coarctation of the aorta, particularly when systolic and diastolic events are considered together. This approach overcomes the relatively low sensitivity of peak systolic gradient alone.\r"

Ten patients had a common atrioventricular orifice (complete defect) while two patients had separate right and left valve orifices (partial defect). Associated cardiac malformations included the tetralogy of Fallot in two, isomerism of the right atrial appendages and pulmonary atresia in two, and right isomerism and double outlet right ventricle in one. All had previously been examined by cross sectional echocardiography. Eight subsequently had angiography and six underwent surgical correction. There was one operative death and three other deaths. Three of these patients underwent postmortem examinations. Small children and infants were scanned inside a 32 cm diameter head coil. Multiple electrocardiographically gated sections 5 mm thick, separated by 0.5 mm, were acquired using a spin echo sequence with echo time of 30 ms. A combination of standard and oblique imaging planes was used. Magnetic resonance imaging was more accurate than echocardiography in predicting the size of the ventricular component of the defect. It was also better than either echocardiography and angiography in identifying the presence of ventricular hypoplasia. All these findings were confirmed by surgical or postmortem examinations or both. Magnetic resonance imaging is capable of providing detailed morphological information in children with atrioventricular septal defects which is likely to be of value in their management.\r"

In 10 patients earlier electrocardiograms did not show left axis deviation; this feature appeared when the aneurysm of the membranous septum was first seen on the echocardiogram. None of the 44 controls with perimembranous ventricular septal defect but without an aneurysm had left axis deviation. This study suggests that the appearances of conspicuous left axis deviation in a patient with ventricular septal defect indicate a spontaneous reduction in the defect by apposition of the septal tricuspid valve leaflet and by the formation of an aneurysm of the membranous septum.\r"

The ratio of the maximum diameter of the inflated balloon to the narrowest pulmonary arterial diameter varied from 1.6 to 3.3. In three patients with an initial ratio of less than or equal to 2 dilatation was repeated with a larger balloon. The right ventricular systolic pressure ranged from 0.70 to 1.25 of the simultaneously measured femoral arterial systolic pressure. The major stenosis was in the main pulmonary artery in four patients and at the pulmonary arterial bifurcation in one. After balloon angioplasty in the four patients there was no significant improvement in the ratio of right ventricular to femoral arterial systolic pressure or in the angiographic appearance. There was no change in the pressure ratio after angioplasty in the patient who had a major stenosis of the pulmonary arterial bifurcation and mild main pulmonary artery narrowing. There seemed to be a slight angiographic improvement in the bifurcation stenosis but at restudy two months later the angiographic improvement had disappeared. Balloon angioplasty of supravalvar pulmonary stenosis developing after anatomical correction for complete transposition was not successful in eight procedures. This lack of success may be attributable to a small pulmonary annulus with consequent multiple levels of stenosis and distortion of the main pulmonary artery.\r"

The tear film is seen to cover the surface of the conjunctiva and to be concentrated in its folds. Small circular areas of thin tear film appear transiently in the neighbourhood of the limbus after a blink. Occasional cells stain on the normal conjunctiva, particularly in the interpalpebral area. The density of the staining increases in dry eye conditions. Conjunctival trauma is sensitively revealed by the method, and its healing can be followed. Hard contact lenses are seen to traumatize continually the inferior limbal conjunctiva in symptomless wearers.\r"

All but one of the 35 clinical isolates of HSV were type 1 and all were sensitive to the 10 antiviral agents. A single type 2 isolate from a young man with recurrent conjunctivitis proved to be resistant to a number of the antiviral agents. Since many of the clinical isolates had been exposed to multiple and protracted antiviral drug treatment, it is suggested that antiviral drug resistance in type 1 HSV ocular infection is not a significant problem.\r"

The implanted Silastic was retained in 66 patients, with an average follow up of 3.5 years (range less than 1 to 9.5 years), though six required surgery to debulk the anterior end of the implant. Further surgery was required in 27 patients, this generally being to correct the position of either the upper or the lower lid. Volume enhancement was effective in most cases, there being a significant reduction in the degree of recession of the prosthesis and the depth of the unsightly sunken sulci of the upper and lower lids. The mobility of the orbital contents, the prosthesis, and the upper lid was not improved.\r"

We describe the range of MPXI levels in healthy and patient populations and in 10 cases of megaloblastic anemia, including five having elevated mean cell volume (MCV) and five without macrocytosis. Regardless of the MCV, our megaloblastic patients had hypersegmented neutrophils and elevated MPXI levels without visible alteration of granule content. MPXI measurement may be particularly useful in identifying cases of \"masked megaloblastic anemia\" where the MCV is below 100 fL. The advantage of the MPXI over other methods of uncovering masked megaloblastic anemia is its simplicity when performed as part of a routine complete blood count on an automated hematology instrument.\r"

  ".W": "We have examined aspects of methemoglobin (metHb) reduction in sickle and in thalassemic red blood cells (RBCs). NADH metHb reductase activity in sickle and thalassemic RBCs was significantly increased compared with normal RBCs. Because in vitro enzyme activity does not necessarily represent in vivo activity, we measured the rate of metHb reduction in intact RBCs. Intact thalassemic RBCs demonstrated a significantly increased rate of metHb reduction compared with normal RBCs. In contrast, intact sickle RBCs had a rate of metHb reduction that was similar to normal RBCs and significantly decreased relative to high reticulocyte RBCs of equivalent cell age. To determine the mechanism for the relative impairment of metHb reduction in sickle RBCs, we measured intraerythrocytic NADH, a cofactor in the metHb reduction reaction. Thalassemic RBCs had a significantly increased NADH content relative to normal RBCs. In contrast, sickle RBCs did not have an increase in NADH content. Furthermore, incubating normal RBCs under conditions that increase the NADH content resulted in an increased rate of metHb reduction. In contrast, conditions that decrease the NADH content in normal RBC resulted in a decreased rate of metHb reduction. These data and other results suggest that metHb reduction in intact RBCs is dependent on NADH content, and that the impaired metHb reduction rate in sickle RBCs may be a result of a lack of increase in NADH content. The dependence of metHb reduction on RBC NADH content and the ability to manipulate NADH content in vitro suggest a new strategy for decreasing oxidant damage to sickle RBCs in vivo.\r"

  ".U": "90366681\r", 
  ".W": "It has been hypothesized that some of the irreversible microrheologic abnormalities of sickle red blood cell (RBC) membranes could result from autoxidative perturbation. To model this possibility, we used micromechanical manipulation to examine the static extensional rigidity and inelastic or plastic behavior of normal RBCs exposed to phenazine methosulfate (PMS), an agent that generates superoxide from within the cell. In response to this stress, RBC membranes became stiff as evidenced by increasing extensional rigidity. At 50 mumol/L PMS they were as stiff as the membranes of most dense, dehydrated sickle RBCs; and at 25 mumols/L PMS the membranes were similar to somewhat less dense sickle RBCs. When examined for inelastic behavior, RBCs exposed to PMS even at 10 mumols/L showed hysteresis in loading and unloading phases of the curve relating aspiration length to suction pressure, and they developed membrane bumps that persisted after RBC release from the pipette. Examination of single cells in both isotonic and hypotonic buffers showed that the effect of PMS on RBC microheology is not mediated by cellular dehydration. Independent confirmation of the membrane stiffening effect of PMS was obtained by ektacytometric analysis of resealed RBC ghosts, with sickle-like increases in membrane rigidity observed between 50 and 100 mumol/L PMS. The rigidity of these ghosts was partially ameliorated by exposure to a thiol reductant. In terms of biochemical abnormalities, treated RBCs became significantly different from control RBCs at 25 mumol/L PMS, at which point they just began to enter the sickle range for amounts of membrane thiol oxidation and membrane-associated heme. The sickle average was achieved at 50 mumol/L PMS (for thiol oxidation) to 100 mumol/L PMS (for membrane heme). Thus, micromolar concentrations of PMS induce abnormalities of membrane microrheology that closely mimic those of unmanipulated sickle RBCs while reproducing similar degrees of oxidative biochemical change. We conclude that membrane protein oxidation could explain existence of an irreversible component to the abnormal rheology of the sickle membrane.\r"

  ".W": "We have established that 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG) content and intracellular pH exert separate, but interdependent, effects on the equilibrium solubility (csat) of deoxyhemoglobin S (deoxy-Hb S) that act in concert to modulate intraerythrocytic polymer formation. In a nonphysiologic csat assay system, a steep dependence of csat on pH in the physiologic range 7.0 to 7.6 was shown for both stripped (Hb) and DPG-saturated deoxy-Hb S (Hb-DPG). The solubility-pH profile for Hb under near-physiologic buffer conditions also showed that csat increased steeply in the same pH range (6.8 to 7.6). The effect of 2,3-DPG on csat under near-physiologic conditions was evaluated separately. At pH 7.20, the pH of the human red blood cell, csat values for Hb and Hb-DPG were 19.56 +/- 0.14 and 17.95 +/- 0.45 g/dL, respectively, indicating that the solubility of Hb-DPG is lower than that of Hb by 8.2% +/- 2.3%. Thus, binding of 2,3-DPG in the beta-cleft promotes the polymerization of deoxy-Hb S, the ultimate determinant of cell sickling. Furthermore, because of the abnormal Bohr effect of sickle blood (approximately double that of normal blood), the intracellular pH of deoxygenated sickle erythrocytes should be approximately 0.28 pH unit higher than that of oxygenated cells (ie, 7.41 v 7.13). At the higher pH, the corresponding csat for Hb-DPG is 20.22 g/dL, which is the best estimate of the intrinsic solubility of T-state Hb S under conditions that approximate closely those of pH, temperature, ionic strength, and 2,3-DPG saturation in the fully desaturated sickle erythrocyte.\r"

  ".W": "To better estimate how frequently patients with low serum cobalamin (Cbl) levels in current clinical practice are truly deficient in Cbl and to determine the incidence of atypical or nonclassic presentations of Cbl deficiency, we prospectively studied 300 unselected consecutive patients with serum Cbl concentrations less than 200 pg/mL seen at two medical centers over a 2-year period. Baseline hematologic, neuropsychiatric, and biochemical measurements were obtained, followed by a course of parenteral Cbl therapy and reassessment. A response to Cbl therapy was defined as one or more of the following: (1) an increase in hematocrit of 0.05 or more; (2) a decrease in mean cell volume of 5 fL or more; (3) a clearing of hypersegmented neutrophilis and macroovalocytes from the peripheral blood smear; and (4) an unequivocal and prompt improvement of neuropsychiatric abnormalities. Of the 300 patients with serum Cbl levels less than 200 pg/mL, 86 had one or more responses to Cbl therapy and 59 had no response. In 155, insufficient data was available. In the Cbl-responsive patients, normal values were found for the following tests: hematocrit, 44%; mean cell volume less than or equal to 100 fL, 36%; white blood cell count, 84%; platelet count, 79%; serum lactic dehydrogenase, 43%; and serum bilirubin, 83%. Peripheral blood smears were nondiagnostic in 6% when reviewed by the investigators, but 33% as reported by routine laboratories. Serum Cbl levels in the 100 to 199 pg/mL range were present in 38%. Neuropsychiatric abnormalities were noted in 28%, often in the absence of anemia, macrocytosis, or both. Serum levels of methylmalonic acid and/or total homocysteine were elevated greater than 3 SDs above the mean for normal subjects in 94% of the Cbl-responsive patients. We conclude that Cbl deficiency should be considered and investigated in patients with unexplained hematologic or neuropsychiatric abnormalities of the kind seen in Cbl deficiency, even if anemia, an elevated mean cell volume, a marked depression of the serum Cbl, or other classic hematologic or biochemical abnormalities are lacking. Levels of serum methylmalonic acid and total homocysteine are useful as ancillary diagnostic tests in the diagnostis of Cbl deficiency.\r"

  ".W": "The relationship of protein synthesis to megakaryocyte maturation has been studied in guinea pigs in vivo. Guinea pigs were injected with a single dose of [35S]methionine. Megakaryocytes and platelets were isolated daily for 4 days, and proteins from both cells were isolated by DEAE-Sephacel chromatography and analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and fluorography. All proteins in megakaryocytes corresponding to stained bands on the SDS-PAGE gels were radiolabeled at 3 hours after injection. The greatest loss of radioactivity from the megakaryocytes occurred between 1 and 3 days after injection. Only trace labeling of platelet proteins was seen at 3 hours, representing almost entirely three bands at molecular weights 47,000, 52,000, and 66,000. At 24 hours only about 13% of the maximal labeling was present, but not all proteins were labeled. The maximal labeling was at 3 days. The pattern of labeling of platelets at 3 days was identical to that of megakaryocytes at 3 hours. The protein pattern of nonmegakaryocytic marrow cells was different from that of the platelets and megakaryocytes. Data presented here suggest that most protein synthesis in megakaryocytes is completed at least 24 hours before release of the platelets to the circulation, and suggest some specificity in the proteins that are synthesized at the terminal stages of maturation.\r"

To ascertain whether variations in fat tissue fraction depend on the size of individual adipocytes or their number or both, a stereologic study of 30 human bone marrow specimens (10 with aplasia, 10 with hyperplasia, and 10 with dysplasia) was performed. A total of 23,435 adipocyte profiles were measured and two stereologic parameters were obtained in each specimen: mean diameter and number of cells per mm3 of bone marrow. The fat tissue fraction correlated positively with the size (r = .79; P less than .001) and the number/volume (r = .77; P less than .001) of adipocytes. The significance of both adipocyte size and adipocyte number/volume was confirmed by stepwise multiple regression, in which the size alone explained 62.5% of fat tissue fraction and both size and number/volume explained 95.8% of fat tissue fraction. These results are discussed from a pathophysiologic point of view.\r"

Mature megakaryocytes with an unusually high ploidy distribution were obtained after differential centrifugation and velocity sedimentation of bone marrow cells through gradients of bovine serum albumin (BSA). The cell membranes of isolated megakaryocytes and megakaryocytes in vivo stained with antisera to human platelets and human platelet membrane GPIIIa. The microenvironment of bovine megakaryocytes in vivo was investigated using antibodies to types I and IV collagen and laminin. In an attempt to duplicate the microenvironment in vitro, bovine megakaryocytes were cultured on a reconstituted basement membrane matrix (Matrigel). The cells adhered to the gel, extended radial lamellipodia, and occasionally formed lengthy pseudopodia. Ultrastructural examination of these cells showed widening and coalescence of the megakaryocyte demarcation membranes (DMS), and inclusion of platelet granules, thin filaments, and microtubules in the processes. Very few DMS vesicles were present distally in the processes. The culture of megakaryocytes on a reconstituted basement membrane may closely model the in vivo megakaryocyte microenvironment and allow the study of thrombocytopoiesis in vitro.\r"

Canine femoral arteries mounted in an organ bath were perfused with physiologic saline solution to which acetylsalicylic acid was added to block prostacyclin formation. During contraction with phenylephrine, addition of acetylcholine to the perfusing solution to evoke EDRF release relaxed the vessel wall. Washed human platelets labeled with 14C-5-hydroxytryptamine were added to the perfusing solution, and activated by thrombin infused via a branch vessel. The perfusate was collected downstream and centrifuged; the fraction of 14C-5-hydroxytryptamine appearing in the supernatant reflected the degree of platelet activation. Stimulation of EDRF release with acetylcholine inhibited 14C-5-hydroxytryptamine release. Hemoglobin (Hb) (10(-5) mol/L) blocked vascular relaxation and platelet-inhibition. RBCs at a hematocrit of 10% (treated with echothiophate to block erythrocyte cholinesterase) did not prevent relaxation but reversed the platelet inhibition. Lower hematocrits did not completely block the inhibition. Thus, erythrocyte Hb may modulate the inhibition of intraluminal platelet aggregation by EDRF.\r"

  ".W": "The expression and function of a new cytokine-induced endothelial cell adhesion protein, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), was characterized in vitro by using a monoclonal antibody, MoAb 4B9, which recognizes a functional epitope on this protein. As determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and radioimmunoprecipitation of metabolically labeled cells, VCAM-1 was minimally expressed on unstimulated human umbilical vein endothelium (HUVE), but was rapidly induced by recombinant human tumor necrosis factor-alpha (rhTNF-alpha), rh interleukin-1, and lipopolysaccharide. In contrast to intercellular adhesion molecule-1, VCAM-1 was not induced on dermal fibroblasts or arterial smooth muscle cells after stimulation with rhTNF, or on keratinocytes after stimulation with rh interferon-gamma. MoAb 4B9 significantly inhibited the adherence of peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) and lymphocytic cell lines, but not neutrophils, to rhTNF-activated HUVE. The inhibitory effect of MoAb 4B9 on PBL adherence to HUVE was additive to that produced by the CD18 MoAb 60.3. These results show that VCAM-1 mediates a CD18-independent pathway of peripheral blood lymphocyte adherence to cytokine-stimulated HUVE. We propose that lymphocyte binding to VCAM-1, induced on endothelium by cytokines, may be an important component of lymphocyte emigration at sites of inflammation or immune reaction.\r"

The association of KS in an HTLV-I infected, but not human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected, individual should alert investigators to the occurrence of KS in retroviral-associated diseases other than acquired immunodeficiency disease syndrome.

  ".W": "Thymosin beta 4 (T beta 4) was originally isolated as a thymic hormone. Its functional properties remain obscure; however, the N-terminal peptidic sequence could have a regulatory function on hematopoietic stem cell proliferation. To investigate the mechanism of T beta 4 expression, we studied T beta 4 gene expression in various leukemic cells and in established cell lines. Among leukemic cell samples obtained from leukemia patients, the T beta 4 gene was highly expressed in a lymphoid lineage, especially in adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) cells, rather than in a granulocyte lineage. The T beta 4 gene was more transcriptionally active in chronic B-cell leukemia than in acute B-cell leukemia, while it was inactive in plasma cell leukemia. We also found that cells from one of the ATL patients transcribed a heterogeneous message. T beta 4 messenger RNA increased in MOLT-3 during differentiation by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), in HL60 cells induced by TPA or dimethylsulfoxide and K562 cells stimulated by cytosine arabinoside or hemin. The genomic sequence of T beta 4 is considered to be highly conserved. Only 1 of 20 genomes from normal or hematopoietic malignant cells showed restriction fragment length polymorphism. These findings, along with previous data, suggest that T beta 4 may be a new marker of differentiation of hematopoietic cells.\r"

A two-way dose/response analysis shows that the ATRA becomes more efficient as an inhibitor with increasing doses of DFO. Flow cytometric studies further support the view that IgG ATRAS impair transferrin receptor (TR) function by causing TR down-modulation and degradation, even when the presence of DFO acts to promote increased cell surface TR expression. It is also shown that an IgG ATRA is nearly as effective as an IgM ATRA in inhibiting tumor cell growth when used in combination with DFO. Finally, studies with the iron chelator picolinic acid show that it produces only additive, or very slightly supra-additive, effects when used in combination with the ATRA. Therefore, these studies not only continue to suggest that combination chelator/ATRA therapy warrants further investigation as a tool in the therapy of hematopoietic malignancies, but also make the following new points: (1) the clinically familiar iron chelator deferoxamine, but not all iron chelators, produces synergistic inhibition of tumor growth in vitro with ATRAS; and (2) IgG ATRAS, which may be clinically more attractive reagents than IgA or IgM ATRAS because of better access to extra vascular tissue spaces, have unexpectedly been found to function as powerful growth inhibitors when used in combination with DFO.\r"

Data were collected as part of a one year prospective survey of the 17 perinatal units in the Trent region. Adequacy of provision of equipment for recognised intensive care cost was assessed using the recommendations of the British Paediatric Association and British Association of Perinatal Paediatrics. It was assumed that units without recognised intensive care cost had to be able to equip one cot to a standard of intensive care level 1 in the short term. Equipment more than 5 years old was considered likely to warrant replacement or major maintenance within the next two years. With these guidelines over 600,000 pounds would be required to provide sufficient equipment for all recognised level 1 intensive care cost and to allow units without funded cost to provide this level of care in the short term and to replace existing equipment more than 5 years old for these cost alone. This amount could be reduced by 25% by subdividing intensive care cost into levels 1 and 2, thereby reducing equipment requirements, but this would impair the units' ability to perform level 1 care at funded provision, which has already been shown to need expansion. Neither figure takes account of equipment requirements for infants requiring special care. In addition, no allowance has been made for purchase or update of ultrasound scanners or blood gas analysers. If the government's proposed reforms are to be implemented clinicians need to revise guidelines regarding essential equipment, and plans must be made to correct any existing shortfalls so that they do not become inherited financial liabilities for future budget holders.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To examine the patterns of physical activity among British schoolchildren aged 11 to 16 and to assess whether the children experience the intensity and duration of physical activity that are believed to stress the cardiopulmonary system appropriately. DESIGN--Cross sectional study of a sample of children drawn from a larger survey of coronary risk factors in children. Continuous monitoring of heart rate for 12 hour periods on three school days and one Saturday. SETTING--Two communities in Devon. SUBJECTS--266 Children (163 girls, 103 boys) aged 11 to 16 randomly selected from a sample of 707 children. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Percentage of time and number of sustained periods in which heart rate was greater than 139 beats/min. Anthropometric measures and external assessment of sexual maturity with Tanner's indices. RESULTS--The boys had heart rates greater than 139 beats/min for a significantly higher percentage of time than the girls (p less than 0.01) during the weekday (6.2% v 4.3%) and the Saturday (5.6% v 2.6%). The boys had significantly more five and 10 minute periods with heart rates greater than 139 beats/min than the girls during the Saturday and weekdays and more 20 minute periods during the weekdays. 84 Girls and 37 boys had no 10 minute period with a heart rate greater than 139 beats/min during the three weekdays and 112 girls and 65 boys had no such 10 minute period during the Saturday. No significant relation was detected in either sex between the amount or habitual physical activity (heart rate) and skinfold thickness or maturity group. CONCLUSIONS--British children have surprisingly low levels of habitual physical activity, and many children seldom undertake the volume of physical activity believed to benefit the cardiopulmonary system. Boys are more active than girls. The pubertal stage of development or body fatness, or both, do not seem to be sensitive indicators of physical activity in either girls or boys.\r"

  ".U": "90366758\r", 
  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To evaluate the need for a randomised study of treatment of spinal osteoporosis with human parathyroid peptide in the secondary prevention of crush fractures; to study the effect of human parathyroid hormone peptide 1-34 plus sex hormones on vertebral body cancellous bone; and, separately, to determine the effect of relatively low doses of sodium fluoride plus calcium on spinal bone mineral density. DESIGN--Open study of patients with primary or postmenopausal osteoporosis. All patients had serial bone densitometry of the spine by quantitative computed tomography and dual photon absorptiometry as well as serial densitometry of the radial midshaft (cortical) and radial distal (trabecular) bone by quantitative computed tomography. Changes in the spinal bone not forming the spongiosa of the vertebral bodies (\"cortical\" bone) were determined from the difference between the two axial measurements, after correction to the same units of measurement. SETTING--Northwick Park Hospital and Medical Research Council Clinical Research Centre. PATIENTS--24 Patients who fulfilled the conventional criteria for type 1 (vertebral) osteoporosis not secondary to recognised causes other than sex hormone deficiency and with at least one crush or wedge vertebral fracture and a spinal bone density (quantitative computed tomography) less than 80 mg/cm3 or two or more fractures. Twelve patients received human parathyroid peptide and 12 sodium fluoride; they were not randomised. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Trends in axial and peripheral bone mass values determined by linear, time dependent regression analyses. RESULTS--The patients receiving the peptide showed a substantial increase in vertebral spongiosa (mean 25.6 mg/cm2 two years after the start of treatment). No significant changes were seen in spinal cortical or radial bone density. The patients receiving sodium fluoride showed roughly equal increases in cancellous and cortical bone over the same period (mean increase in vertebral spongiosa 16.1 mg/cm3). No significant changes were seen in radial bone. CONCLUSIONS--Treatment of postmenopausal women with human parathyroid peptide selectively increases spinal cancellous bone density by amounts that may prove useful in secondary prevention. Peptide treatment should now be tested in a randomised study in which the important end point is prevention of fractures as the usefulness of sodium fluoride in this context is doubtful.\r"

DESIGN--Prospective study of all the operative procedures performed in one year, classified according to the British United Provident Association's schedule of procedures and scored by the \"intermediate equivalent\" value (taking the recommended fee value of an intermediate operation as 1.0) compared with the number of operations performed. SETTING--General surgical unit of Taunton and Somerset Hospital, comparing four consultant surgeons and their teams. PATIENTS--Inpatients and day patients admitted under the care of general surgeons during 1989. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE--Difference between the apparent workload represented by simple case counting (caseload) and the actual workload represented by calculation of the total \"intermediate equivalent\" value. RESULTS--The workload assessed in terms of intermediate equivalent values was greater than that suggested by case counting for complex operations (12% v 4%), operations at the district hospital (82% v 74%), and operations performed by consultants (53% v 35%) and was lower for minor operations (20% v 42%), operations at the community hospitals (18% v 26%), and operations performed by surgeons in training grades and clinical assistants (47% v 66%). CONCLUSIONS--The use of the intermediate equivalent values as an indicator of complexity allows a more realistic assessment of the operative workload than a simple case count of the number of different operations and is recommended for comparing workload in different hospitals and departments.\r"

  ".W": "An attempt was made to provide simple practical guidelines to alert general practitioners to the diagnosis of rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis and lead to early referral to hospital. The duration of illness before referral to this hospital and its effect on outcome in patients with crescentic nephritis were assessed retrospectively from the case notes of 24 patients referred over two years. Four patients had Goodpasture's syndrome, 11 Wegener's granulomatosis, seven microscopic polyarteritis, and two idiopathic progressive glomerulonephritis. The duration of symptoms before referral to the local hospital was similar in the four groups of patients and varied from one week to 28 months (mean 10 months). The duration of stay in the local hospital was two, nine, 11, and 180 days in the patients with Goodpasture's syndrome and a mean of four days (range one to eight) in those with Wegener's granulomatosis and 10 days (one to 18 days) in those with microscopic polyarteritis. In the local hospital the diagnosis was based on the results of renal biopsy and detection of antibodies to glomerular basement membrane in two patients with Goodpasture's syndrome and on the results of renal biopsy in seven of the other patients aided by the detection of antibodies to the cytoplasm of neutrophils (ANCA) in 10. Three of the 24 patients died and four required maintenance haemodialysis. Patients who present to their general practitioners with persistent non-specific symptoms should have a urine dipstick test and then blood tests and emergency referral to hospital if necessary. Hospital physicians should be aware of the speed and accuracy with which current assays can confirm a diagnosis of rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis.\r"

Previous renal surgery had been performed in 17.4% of patients in Group 1 and 36% in Group 2. There were 17.2% complicated patients in Group 1 and 51% in Group 2. The stone burden included 30.2% multiple, partial staghorn and staghorn calculi in Group 1 and 47.2% in Group 2. The use of in situ stone disintegration increased from 22.2% in Group 1 to 73.4% in Group 2 and nephrostomy drainage was necessary in 29.6% compared with 75%. Post-operative complications increased from 13.6 to 24%. Stone-free rates decreased from 92 to 51%, but the addition of other methods of treatment and the inclusion of patients with stone fragments of 2 mm or less increased these figures to 98% in Group 1 and 83% in Group 2. More complicated patients with complex stones are now being referred for PCNL. These patients require multiple treatments, including extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) and percutaneous surgery, in combination with other endoscopic and radiological procedures.\r"

The frequency of obstructive symptoms such as hesitancy, intermittency and decreased stream was low. Diurnal frequency with voiding intervals less than 3 h were recorded by more than 50% of the women and about 10% voided more frequently than every second hour. Nocturia increased significantly with age; 54 (13.6%) voided at least twice per night. About 40% complained of incontinence but this was troublesome in only 6%; 15.3, 13.3 and 11.5% had stress, urge and mixed incontinence respectively. More than 8% wore nappies or sanitary towels every day to protect against urinary leakage. Although the tendency to wear nappies or sanitary towels increased with age, the increase was not statistically significant. There was a positive correlation between the occurrence of stress incontinence and childbirth in the group as a whole.\r"

A visual analogue scale may serve to alert the surgeon to the presence of impaired detrusor contractility and the need for a fuller urodynamic assessment in patients with a low urinary flow rate prior to consideration for prostatectomy.\r"

We established an animal model to compare various types of cystoplasties, tubularised and detubularised, using ileum and caecum. Detubularisation did not abolish intrinsic bowel contractions but delayed their onset. No differences were noted in the frequency and amplitude of such contractions after detubularisation or between large and small bowel cystoplasties. Although intravenous urography did not demonstrate any abnormality in upper tract anatomy, a significant number of animals had some functional disturbance of the kidney after cystoplasty demonstrable on isotope renography, irrespective of the surgical technique. It may be possible to prevent these contractions with their associated harmful effects by preventing the bladder volume from building up excessively.\r"

The recurrence rate of tumours was estimated by the person-years method, comparing it with that of historical controls. There were statistically significant decreases in recurrent tumours following BCG therapy. To clarify the efficacy of intravesical BCG therapy, the prognostic significance of several factors was evaluated in patients with bladder cancer treated with TUR and instillation of BCG. The prophylactic effects were statistically better for those with multiple tumours, grade 3 lesions or Ta lesions than for control patients. No correlation between purified protein derivative (PPD) responsiveness and favourable results could be observed. Our results suggest that intravesical BCG instillation can alter the biological behaviour that affects the recurrence of superficial bladder cancer, especially for multiple, high grade or Ta tumours.\r"

Both tests correctly identified a patient with such advanced local disease that surgery was deemed inappropriate at examination under anaesthesia and both tests indicated that surgery might be difficult in a further patient with inoperable disease. Both tests demonstrated abnormalities in the perivesical and pelvic fat planes in all patients but they had difficulty in distinguishing between malignant infiltration and the effects of radiotherapy. Nevertheless, each test is useful in excluding gross pelvic disease and predicting involvement of adjacent organs. The advantages of the multiplanar images provided by MRI must be balanced against the high cost. CT readily demonstrates the upper abdomen, the kidneys and para-aortic nodes as well as the pelvis and is more widely available.\r"

The volume of glycine absorbed, intravenous fluid given and blood loss were calculated, and serum osmolality, sodium and glycine were measured before, during and after operation. The mean volume of glycine absorbed, fluid gain and blood loss were 0.6, 1.57 and 0.356 litres respectively. The mean weight of prostate resected was 30.8 g and resection time was 56.5 min. The mean serum osmolality dropped from 291 to 286 mOsm/l, sodium dropped from 138 to 132 mmol/l and glycine concentration increased from 293 to 3599 mumol/l post-operatively. Ten patients developed signs suggestive of the TURP syndrome. Multiple regression analysis showed that the most consistent statistically significant factors in relation to the syndrome were volumetric gain and hypo-osmolality. The latter proved to be the only significant factor later post-operatively. The increase in serum glycine and drop in serum sodium concentrations were the best serological markers, reaching significance only after excluding volumetric gain and osmolality from the analysis.\r"

The observation time per patient averaged 7.4 years; 16% of the stones passed spontaneously and 40% were removed surgically. The infection rate was 68% and 45% of the stones increased in size during the observation period. Retrospective evaluation showed that of 32 patients who underwent surgery, only 11 procedures were performed at the appropriate time. In the remaining 21 cases the timing of surgery was judged to have been too late because of the ensuing complications. In 8 patients stone growth led to staghorn calculi, 8 had acute obstruction with incipient urosepsis, 3 had chronic urinary infection and 1 had loss of kidney function. We believe that 83% of all caliceal stones require intervention (ESWL or percutaneous nephrolithotomy) within 5 years of diagnosis. Only 11% of patients with caliceal calculi remain symptom-free after 10 years.\r"

One hundred and fifty-five patients were referred by acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) physicians for general surgical management. The most frequent reason for surgical referral (64 patients) was anorectal disease which occurred in 5.9 per cent of all HIV-positive patients. One or more diagnoses were reached in 61 of the 64 patients referred with anorectal disease: warts (38 per cent of diagnoses), anorectal ulceration (26 per cent), perianal sepsis (15 per cent), neoplasia (14 per cent) and haemorrhoidal disease (8 per cent). Anorectal symptoms were relieved in 68 per cent of patients and the median survival of those treated was 17.5 months from the time of surgical referral. Both warts and perianal sepsis were associated with in situ neoplasia, but no case of progression from in situ to invasive anal squamous carcinoma was detected. The aetiology of anorectal ulcers was not clear, but surgical excision of anal ulcers and skin tags can produce healing. Palliation of anorectal symptoms in HIV-positive homosexual patients is possible but some conditions are unusual and surgeons should be familiar with their presentation and management.\r"

Within the duodenum, adenomas cluster around the ampulla of Vater, as do the majority of duodenal cancers, suggesting that bile plays a role in tumour development. We therefore tested duodenal bile from 29 postcolectomy FAP patients (27 of whom had duodenal adenomas) and 24 non-FAP patients for mutagenicity, using techniques that detect point mutations in bacteria. Results which appeared to show that FAP bile was more mutagenic than control bile could be accounted for by a feeding effect, elimination of which also eliminated 'mutagenicity'. Under the conditions of our assays we conclude that if bile is an important factor in genesis of duodenal tumours, it does not act by inducing point mutation.\r"

There were three emergency operations. The rectum was stapled transversely more than 3 cm below the tumour using the adjustable-angle linear stapler (Roticulator). Colorectal or coloanal anastomoses were constructed using the EEA circular stapler introduced per anum through the anorectal stump staple line. Ten coloanal and 19 low rectal anastomoses were achieved. A protecting transverse loop colostomy was fashioned in one patient with coloanal anastomosis who developed a vaginal tear during the procedure. In one patient technical failure necessitated conversion to abdominoperineal excision of the rectum. All staple rings and resection margins were intact and free from tumour. There were two clinical anastomotic leaks, both treated successfully with a defunctioning transverse loop colostomy. One patient developed a small infective pelvic haematoma 2 weeks after surgery which required drainage. Hospital stay ranged from 6 to 15 days (mean 8 days). Continence was normal in all patients at 8 weeks. One soft coloanal anastomotic stricture required dilatation. No recurrences have been detected during a follow-up of between 10 and 22 months.\r"

Patients were divided into four groups on the basis of disease location at time of surgery, and mean follow-up was 4.5 years. All three children with panenteric disease (group 1) have relapsed. Best results were observed in cases with disease confined to the small bowel (group 2) and ileocaecal region (group 3), in whom surgery was followed by sustained remission in six out of seven and 24 out of 30 patients respectively. In the 27 children with colitis (group 4), results were mixed. Six of the seven patients who had staged colonic resections with a primary anastomosis relapsed, as did three out of four patients given a loop ileostomy to divert the faecal flow; in contrast, 15 out of 16 children who had a subtotal colectomy with ileostomy as the primary procedure have remained well, with only minor problems involving the rectal stump. An acceleration in growth velocity was observed during the first year after operation in 89 per cent of 40 children studied. Outcome after surgery for Crohn's disease in childhood depends mainly on disease location, but is influenced by the type of primary operation performed. In addition to symptomatic relief the principal early benefit of surgery is improved growth.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to determine the manometric activity of ileoanal W pouch reservoirs following restorative proctocolectomy for ulcerative colitis and to compare the results with normal controls. Thirty-one studies were carried out; there were 15 controls (median age 52 years (range 29-80 years), 10 men, 5 women) and 16 pouch patients (median age 40 years (range 28-52 years), 13 men, 3 women). Mid-anal sphincter pressure and 'rectal' pressure were measured with a microtransducer catheter. The signals were digitalized and recorded in a portable electronic memory for later computer display and analysis. The system allowed the study of patients with minimal constraints while fully ambulant. The frequency of sampling (rectal pressure greater than or equal to sphincter pressure), sensation of flatus present and flatus being passed were 7(1-41), 3(1-7) and 1(0-3.5) per hour in the normal controls and 0(0-3), 0(0-1) and 0(0-1) respectively per hour in the pouch patients (P less than 0.001). Compared with the highly dynamic nature of the anorectum in normal subjects the patients with a pouch had very little activity. The sensation of pouch filling and the desire to defaecate were noted on 12 occasions and in six were associated with a rise in pouch pressure greater than 20 mmHg. One patient had nocturnal soiling and this was the only patient in whom frequent pouch contractions were noted. The results suggest that ileoanal pouch motility is usually quiescent and that incontinence in this group may be related to increased pouch activity.\r"

  ".W": "Thirty-two patients with high trans-sphincteric or suprasphincteric fistulae underwent fistulotomy without external sphincter division. Fifteen patients had posterior fistulae involving the deep postanal space and 17 patients had anterior fistulae. Primary healing, after removal of the seton, occurred in 25 of the 32 patients (78 per cent). Primary healing in patients with posterior fistulae occurred in 66 per cent and in 88 per cent of patients with anterior fistulae. Following surgery, eight patients (33 per cent) reported problems controlling flatus, six patients (25 per cent) reported mucous discharge and one patient (4 per cent) complained of occasional incontinence for liquid stool. No patient experienced problems controlling solid stool nor did any patient require the use of a protective pad. These results have encouraged us to use this method as the initial procedure of choice for these more difficult fistulae. A significant number of patients can be cured of their fistula while preserving the external sphincter, thereby minimizing the impact of surgical therapy on continence.\r"

Altogether 30 occult hernias were detected in 27 patients, only one of which was considered to be unrelated to the presenting symptoms. On the basis of herniography, 17 patients were spared surgical exploration and, of these 17, 16 obtained a good result. One further patient with a clinically apparent hernia on one side but with contralateral symptoms was spared unnecessary surgery because the contralateral side was radiologically normal. There was one false negative and no false positive examinations. There were three minor complications: two cases of sigmoid colon puncture and one of abdominal wall haemorrhage (all managed conservatively). There were two technical failures. These results support the Scandinavian experience that herniography has a useful role in the management of patients who may have occult hernias as the underlying cause of abdominal wall symptoms.\r"

There were five deaths from papillary thyroid carcinoma. Three of six patients with DNA aneuploid tumours on flow cytometry died (P greater than 0.05, Fisher's exact test) compared with four of eight patients whose tumours were found to be aneuploid by static densitometry (P less than 0.02). When quantitative analysis was applied to the static densitometry data, all five patients who died from papillary carcinoma were distinguished, with no false positives (P less than 0.002). The prognostic accuracy of flow cytometric DNA analysis is less than that of static densitometry in which morphological selection of malignant cells permits quantitative measurements. DNA analysis may add refinement to existing scoring systems in predicting the risk of death from papillary thyroid carcinoma. Such information could provide the basis for controlled prospective evaluation of bilateral resection as opposed to lobectomy in defined high risk patients. At present there is insufficient evidence upon which aneuploidy should be used as a determinant of the extent of operation for papillary thyroid carcinoma.\r"

In addition the circular muscle was often discontinuous at the pyloroduodenal junction with only longitudinal fibres or even fibrous tissue separating the mucosa from the serosa. In a further specimen in which a pyloromyotomy had been performed 10 weeks previously, this asymmetry was more pronounced. This anatomy suggests that in pyloric stenosis it may be safer to site the caudal part of the pyloromyotomy incision on the anterior surface, rather than on the anterosuperior surface as most authors recommend. Perforation of the mucosa is predicted to be less likely.\r"

Four cases were subsequently excluded because of a breach of the study protocol, leaving 46 cases in the study. Seventeen (37 per cent) were normoacidaemic on admission; 13 had plasma chloride concentrations of greater than or equal to 106 mmol/l and four had chloride concentrations of 100-105 mmol/l on admission. Twenty-nine (63 per cent) were alkalaemic on admission; six cases had chloride concentrations of 100-105 mmol/l and 23 cases had concentrations of less than 100 mmol/l. Of those 29 cases requiring correction of alkalaemia, normoacidaemia was achieved at a plasma chloride concentration of greater than or equal to 106 mmol/l in 21 cases (72 per cent) and at a concentration of 100-105 mmol/l in eight cases (28 per cent). Plasma chloride is a reliable parameter in the assessment and correction of alkalaemia in infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis provided that a concentration of at least 106 mmol/l is the goal.\r"

All balloons showed a similar shape of inflation curve, but compliance varied considerably, and the pressure required to burst different balloon types varied from 1060 to 1920 cmH2O. Two balloon types consistently fragmented when they burst in free space. On a specially designed mechanical rig balloon catheters were pulled through a 6 mm tube containing a fixed stenosis, with continuous measurement of traction force and intraballoon pressure. Traction force varied from 34 to 129 g (median 40 g) during passage along the tube, and from 254 to 463 g (median 350 g) during passage through the stenosis. The shear force imparted by the balloon to the tube wall was also calculated. This study provides comparative data which may help to guide surgeons in their choice of balloon embolectomy catheter.\r"

The aim of this study was to compare the oxygen tension of blood from varicose veins with that from normal legs, and to observe the effect of posture on these measurements. Twenty-six subjects (13 normal controls and 13 with uncomplicated varicose veins) had blood sampled from the long saphenous vein or a varicose vein near the ankle. Samples were taken after 30 min in the supine position and repeated after 30 min standing. Samples were also taken simultaneously from the arm. Transcutaneous oxygen measurements of the gaiter skin were performed continuously throughout the experiment. In the supine position, blood from varicose veins had a significantly higher oxygen tension (median = 6.09 kPa) than that from normal veins (median = 4.54 kPa) (P = 0.022). In all subjects, there was a higher oxygen tension in leg vein blood when lying (varicose vein median value = 6.09 kPa, control median value = 4.54 kPa) than while standing (varicose vein median value = 3.93 kPa, control median value = 3.74 kPa) (P less than 0.002, varicose vein group; P = 0.005, normal group). Changes in transcutaneous oxygen tension correlate poorly with changes in venous blood. It is concluded that the theory of arteriovenous anastomoses is only one among a number of possible explanations for the pathogenesis of varicose veins.\r"

There were two hospital deaths and two anastomotic leaks. There was a high rate of complications following surgery (subphrenic abscess, eight; severe chest infection, five; aspiration pneumonia, two; wound infection, two; and reactivation of tuberculosis, one). The hospital stay ranged from 11 to 39 days (median 21 days). Thirty-five patients had microscopic evidence of serosal involvement (S2). Thirty-three of the patients had lymph node metastases and 17 patients had involvement of N2 nodes. Four patients had histological evidence of residual suture line tumour, but only two of these returned with recurrence at the anastomosis. Follow-up (median 3 years) revealed that splenic artery nodal involvement (N2) did not worsen the prognosis after radical resection. Despite a high complication rate, thoracoabdominal radical gastrectomy is associated with an acceptable perioperative mortality rate, adequate symptom palliation and encouraging medium-term survival. The left thoracoabdominal approach gives excellent exposure for radical resection of cancer of the gastric cardia and should be the procedure of choice for curative resection of this tumour.\r"

All acute bleeding was controlled with one session of sclerotherapy using a transparent overtube. After eradication by sclerotherapy, no bleeding episodes occurred and there was no recurrence of the varices, except in three uncompliant patients, during a mean follow-up period of 33.1 months. Bleeding from a gastric ulcer and gastritis occurred in one patient each. Oesophageal stenosis occurred in nine (15 per cent) patients and gastric varices developed in two (3 per cent) patients. Twelve patients died, five from liver failure and six with hepatoma, but there was no bleeding from the gastrointestinal tract. The overall 4-year survival rate was 80 per cent.

This information should be used to ensure proper stratification in randomized trials. It may also be helpful in identifying the patient unlikely to be helped by our current treatment. Such patients should be considered for alternative approaches with the aim of improving survival.\r"

To avoid the effect of the variability of collateral circulation when groups of dogs are compared, we compared the effect of reperfusion and nonreperfusion on myocardial necrosis in a single ischemic territory, half of which was reperfused and half of which was not. The left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) territory between its last diagonal branch and the apex was studied because it was found to have uniform collateral blood flow. In 20 dogs, the LAD was occluded for 90-240 minutes to produce necrosis of different degrees of transmurality. Before release of this occlusion, the LAD was occluded distally halfway to the apex to keep the distal half nonreperfused. After 5 minutes of proximal reperfusion. Monastral blue dye was injected into the left atrium for demarcation of the reperfused region, and the heart was arrested, excised, cut parallel to the LAD, and placed into triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC) solution for delineation of the region of necrosis. The validity of TTC staining under the conditions of this study was confirmed by light and electron microscopy. The transmurality of necrosis, measured within 1 or 0.5 cm on either side of the boundary, ranged from 30% to 88% of wall thickness and was not different in the reperfused compared with the nonreperfused region (paired t test). Reperfusion did not advance the epicardial edge of necrosis compared with the nonreperfused region. In conclusion, at 5 minutes after reperfusion, comparison of necrosis in the reperfused and nonreperfused halves of a single ischemic territory could not demonstrate an extension of necrosis by reperfusion.\r"

In a canine model, lesions were created in vitro (n = 49) and in vivo (n = 31) and radiofrequency power settings were varied. Electrode-tissue interface temperature, delivered current, and voltage were recorded, and impedance was calculated. A sudden rise in electrical impedance was seen in only two of 17 ablations in vitro and in one of 16 ablations in vivo with a peak electrode-tissue interface temperature of less than 100 degrees C compared with 29 of 32 ablations in vitro (p = 0.0001) and 12 of 15 ablations in vivo with a temperature of more than 100 degrees C (p = 0.0001). This phenomenon was associated with the observation of boiling and popping at the tip in in vitro preparations and tissue avulsion and thrombus formation on the catheter tip in in vivo studies. The lesion size was directly proportional to the peak temperature for all ablations but not to the peak power, current, or voltage during radiofrequency catheter ablation in the heart. Maintaining electrode-tissue interface temperature at less than 100 degrees C during radiofrequency catheter ablation in the heart may avoid the complications associated with the sudden rise in electrical impedance.\r"

  ".W": "Of 1,801 patients in the 1985-1986 Percutaneous Transluminal Coronary Angioplasty (PTCA) Registry, 122 (6.8%) had periprocedural occlusion (4.9% in the catheterization laboratory, 1.9% outside the laboratory). Baseline patient factors independently associated with increased occlusion rates included triple-vessel disease, high risk status for surgery, and acute coronary insufficiency. Lesion characteristics showing significant positive association included severe stenosis before PTCA, diffuse or multiple discrete morphology, thrombus, and collateral flow from the lesion. Intimal tear and dissection were also very strongly associated with occlusion. Sixty patients (49%) had a transient occlusion that was reopened with PTCA, 43 (35%) were not redilated and managed with bypass surgery, and 19 (16%) were not redilated and managed medically. In-hospital mortality was 5% in each of these treatment groups, compared with 1% in occlusion-free patients. In-hospital infarction rates ranged from 27% in patients with transient occlusion to 56% in the patients managed with surgery, compared with 2% in patients without occlusion. During 2 years of follow-up, somewhat increased mortality continued in patients with occlusion, whereas follow-up infarction rates were comparable for all patients regardless of occlusion. Patients with an occlusion that was reopened or managed medically had increased rates of surgery during follow-up. Rates of repeat PTCA were comparable (about 23% by 2 years) in patients with transient occlusion and those without occlusion. Occlusion remains a serious complication of angioplasty and is associated most strongly with major events and surgical procedures that occur during the in-hospital period.\r"

Patients weighed 8 kg or more (a requirement for transvenous access with the 11F delivery sheath) and had defects suitable for closure based on two-dimensional echocardiography. The new device was at least 1.6 times the diameter of the atrial septal defect as determined by balloon sizing at catheterization. Patients were followed up by telephone, clinical examination, and echocardiography at 6 months. We attempted closure in 34 patients, with atrial septal defects ranging in diameter from 3 to 22 mm; device sizes ranged from 17 to 33 mm. Initial device position immediately after release was correct in all patients. A cerebral embolus occurred in one elderly patient before device placement--the patient died 1 week later. Two instances of early device embolization occurred, and devices were retrieved by catheter without complication. Follow-up of 31 patients discharged with devices in place, for a total of 31 patient-years, has yielded no umbrella-related complications. Adequate imaging studies in 19 patients 6.5 months after device placement revealed no atrial shunt in 12; residual flow through separate, previously unrecognized atrial septal defects occurred in two; and small residual leaks (less than 3 mm) around devices were present in five patients. This initial success indicates that double-umbrella closure of atrial septal defects will aid in the treatment of intracardiac defects.\r"

  ".U": "90367274\r", 
  ".W": "To determine the clinical consequences of reocclusion of an infarct-related artery after reperfusion therapy, we evaluated 810 patients with acute myocardial infarction. Patients were admitted into four sequential studies with similar entry criteria in which patency of the infarct-related artery was assessed by coronary arteriography 90 minutes after onset of thrombolytic therapy. Successful reperfusion was established acutely in 733 patients. Thrombolytic therapy included tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) in 517, urokinase in 87, and a combination of t-PA and urokinase in 129 patients. All patients received aspirin, intravenous heparin and nitroglycerin, and diltiazem during the recovery phase. A repeat coronary arteriogram was performed in 88% of patients at a median of 7 days after the onset of symptoms. Reocclusion of the infarct-related artery occurred in 91 patients (12.4%), and 58% of these were symptomatic. Angiographic characteristics at 90 minutes after thrombolytic therapy that were associated with reocclusion compared with sustained coronary artery patency were right coronary infarct-related artery (65% versus 44%, respectively) and Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) flow 0 or 1 (21% versus 10%, respectively) before further intervention. Median (interquartile value) degree of stenosis in the infarct-related artery at 90 minutes was similar between groups: 99% for reoccluded (value, 90/100%) compared with 95% for patent (value, 80/99%). Patients with reocclusion had similar left ventricular ejection fractions compared with patients with sustained patency at follow-up. However, patients with reocclusion at follow-up had worse infarct-zone function at -2.7 (value, -3.2/-1.8) versus -2.4 (SD/chord) (value, -3.1/-1.3) (p = 0.016). The recovery of both global and infarct-zone function was impaired by reocclusion of the infarct-related artery compared with maintained patency; median delta ejection fraction was -2 compared with 1 (p = 0.006) and median delta infarct-zone wall motion was -0.10 compared with 0.34 SD/chord (p = 0.011), respectively. In addition, patients with reocclusion had more complicated hospital courses and higher in-hospital mortality rates (11.0% versus 4.5%, respectively; p = 0.01). We conclude that reocclusion of the infarct-related artery after successful reperfusion is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality rates. Reocclusion is also detrimental to the functional recovery of both global and infarct-zone regional left ventricular function. Thus, new strategies in the postinfarction period need to be developed to prevent reocclusion of the infarct-related artery.\r"

Patients were selected who initially had normal atrial sizes and who had no evidence of significant structural or functional cardiac abnormalities other than atrial fibrillation either by history or two-dimensional and Doppler echocardiography. Fifteen patients were studied (12 men and three women; mean age, 67.3 years). Average time between studies was 20.6 months. Three orthogonal left atrial dimensions and two right atrial dimensions were measured, and all were found to increase significantly between studies. Also, highly significant increases in calculated left atrial volume (from 45.2 to 64.1 cm3, p less than 0.001) and right atrial volume (from 49.2 to 66.2 cm3, p less than 0.001) were observed. The relative extents of left and right atrial volume increase did not differ, and left ventricular size did not change significantly between studies. These results indicate that atrial enlargement can occur as a consequence of atrial fibrillation. The maintenance of sinus rhythm, therefore, may prevent atrial enlargement and its adverse clinical effects.\r"

  ".W": "Left ventricular ejection performance, wall stress, and contractile state were evaluated in 35 patients with chronic aortic regurgitation. Cineangiography and pressure measurements were obtained before and a mean of 26 months after aortic valve replacement, and data were compared with those from 30 normal control subjects. The relation between quantitative changes in wall stress and changes in ejection fraction after surgery was determined. Preoperatively, end-systolic stress was elevated in patients with aortic regurgitation (218 +/- 45 vs. 160 +/- 23 kdynes/cm2 [mean +/- SD] for control subjects, p less than 0.01), and ejection fraction was depressed (0.46 +/- 0.11 vs. 0.65 +/- 0.05, p less than 0.01). End-systolic stress decreased postoperatively (151 +/- 41 kdynes/cm2, p less than 0.01) and ejection fraction increased (0.58 +/- 0.11, p less than 0.01). The magnitude of increase in ejection fraction correlated significantly and negatively (r = -0.65) with the quantitative change in end-systolic stress after surgery. Contractile function, as assessed by the ejection phase index-end-systolic stress relation, did not significantly change: 23 of 35 patients preoperatively and 18 of 35 patients postoperatively had values that clearly fell below the 95% confidence limit of the ejection fraction-end-systolic stress relation for controls. After surgery, individual ejection fraction-end-systolic stress relationships demonstrated a shift parallel to the regression curve for the control subjects. Moreover, persistent postoperative left ventricular hypertrophy was significantly associated with persistent contractile dysfunction. Thus, late improvement in left ventricular ejection performance after aortic valve replacement can be attributed to the reduction in end-systolic stress. Contractile function itself was not improved by surgery. Persistent postoperative hypertrophy may be a marker for myocardial contractile dysfunction.\r"

To investigate the importance of this, we evaluated right and left ventricular function in 21 patients after anatomical correction and in 21 patients after Mustard or Senning operations. First-pass and equilibrium-gated radionuclide angiography were used to measure right and left ventricular ejection fractions between 17 and 78 (mean, 47) months after anatomical correction and between 3 and 187 (mean, 67) months after intra-atrial repair. The mean age of the patient groups at the time of study was 52 and 84 months, respectively. The right ventricular ejection fraction ranged from 35% to 78% (mean, 58%) in patients after anatomical correction and from 27% to 68% (mean, 51%) after intra-atrial repair (p = 0.066). The left ventricular ejection fraction ranged from 39% to 74% (mean, 58%) after anatomical correction and from 35% to 74% (mean, 58%) after intra-atrial repair (p = 0.86). The mean right and left ventricular ejection fractions of both groups were significantly lower than those of normal children. Individuals with systemic ventricular dysfunction were identified after both types of operations; however, symptomatic dysfunction occurred only after intra-atrial repair (p = 0.24).\r"

  ".U": "90367278\r", 
  ".W": "The hypothesis that human atrioventricular (AV) nodal function can be modulated selectively with a new technique of AV nodal artery catheterization was tested in eight subjects referred for diagnostic cardiac catheterization or electrophysiological studies. Three patients had no history of arrhythmias. Three patients had supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) due to reentry confined to the AV node (AVNRT). One patient had SVT due to reentry over a concealed AV bypass tract (AVRT-CBT), and one patient had nonsustained ventricular tachycardia. In each subject, sinus cycle length, AH interval, HV interval, AV nodal effective refractory period (AVN-ERP), and Wenckebach paced cycle length were measured in a control state. A flexible infusion catheter was then positioned selectively in the AV nodal artery of each subject. Through this catheter, a constant infusion of 0.1 mg/min procainamide at a flow rate of 0.125 ml/min (n = 1) or 50 micrograms/min acetylcholine at a flow rate of 0.25 ml/min (n = 4) was administered. Electrophysiological parameters were determined again during selective AV nodal artery drug infusion and during infusion of saline at identical rates. Two subjects developed transient AV nodal block during selective AV nodal catheterization alone and did not receive an infusion of drug or saline. A stable position of the AV nodal artery catheter could not be achieved in one other subject, who also received no drug or saline. In the other five subjects, drug infusion caused an increase in AVN-ERP from a control value of 312 +/- 52 msec to a value of 543 +/- 228 msec (p less than 0.05) and an increase in Wenckebach paced cycle length from a control value of 360 +/- 47 msec to a value of 572 +/- 217 msec (p less than 0.05). These parameters were unchanged from control during selective saline infusion. In two patients with AVNRT, drug infusion abolished SVT by causing complete blockade of ventriculoatrial conduction as well as lengthening of anterograde AVN-ERP. In the patient with AVRT-CBT, drug infusion abolished SVT by preventing repetitive anterograde AV conduction. Saline had no effect on SVT inducibility. Selective AV nodal artery catheterization enables AV nodal function to be modulated exclusively. Delivery of ablative agents to the AV node by this technique may be useful in patients with refractory SVT.\r"

  ".W": "Previous determinations of variability in frequency of ventricular arrhythmias have been based on repeated recordings obtained in the absence of therapy. We evaluate variability during \"effective\" treatment with antiarrhythmic drugs. Variability in the percent suppression of premature ventricular complexes (PVCs) was determined in 55 patients with chronic arrhythmias who underwent multiple ambulatory electrocardiographic recordings during evaluation of chronic therapy with antiarrhythmic drugs initially determined to be effective, which was defined as 70% or more reduction in total PVC frequency or 90% or more reduction in repetitive forms. During chronic therapy, total PVCs were suppressed by 92%, averaged after a logarithmic transformation step, and repetitive beats were suppressed by 88%. Variability in suppression was substantial. The one-sided 95% confidence intervals required a fall in suppression of total PVCs to 40% or less to exceed limits of spontaneous variability and of repetitive PVCs to 66% or less. Suppression declined at least once during therapy to less than 60% for total PVCs in 24 of 55 patients (44%) and to less than 80% for repetitive PVCs in 13 of 33 patients (39%); nine patients (16%) showed increases in PVC frequency at least once to levels above pretreatment baseline. Seven subgroups were analyzed for their effects on variability and loss of suppression: age, gender, disease etiology, cardiac function, baseline PVC frequency, use of beta-blockers, and class of antiarrhythmic drug. Differences in confidence bounds and loss of suppression were found to be determined in a complex way by subgroup differences in variability and in initial levels of PVC suppression. Variability was greater for patient subgroups with greater PVC frequency, beta-blocker therapy, and non-coronary artery disease. However, clinical loss of suppression was more common only in more elderly patients and those with worse cardiac function. In summary, substantial variability in arrhythmia frequency occurs during effective antiarrhythmic therapy, and the 95% confidence limits of spontaneous variability are broad and determined in a complex way. Careful consideration should be given before concluding on the basis of a single Holter test that changes (increases) in arrhythmia frequency, especially in certain subgroups, are caused by treatment failure.\r"

This study was designed to determine whether thrombin activity as reflected by plasma concentrations of fibrinopeptide A (FPA), a marker of the action of thrombin on fibrinogen, is increased in patients with primary pulmonary hypertension. To evaluate fibrinolytic activity, we measured plasma concentrations of tissue-type plasminogen activator, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, and cross-linked fibrin degradation products. We studied 31 patients with primary pulmonary hypertension. Plasma FPA concentrations measured by radioimmunoassay, were elevated to 87.4 +/- 36.9 ng/ml (mean +/- SEM). Fifteen minutes after administration of heparin (5,000 U), FPA concentrations decreased to 6.8 +/- 1.4 ng/ml (p less than 0.001 compared with preheparin levels). In 21 of 30 patients (70%), FPA concentrations after heparin administration were less than half the preheparin levels, a response consistent with inhibition of thrombin by heparin and the short half-life of FPA. Despite evidence for marked thrombin activity, plasma concentrations of cross-linked fibrin degradation products were normal in all but four patients. Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 activity was elevated in 19 of the 27 patients in whom it was measured, potentially limiting the fibrinolytic response. The elevations of FPA indicate that thrombin activity is increased in vivo in patients with primary pulmonary hypertension. Thus, sequential assays of plasma markers of thrombosis and fibrinolysis in vivo may help identify those patients who may benefit from treatment with anticoagulants.\r"

Significant differences in heart weight, interstitial fibrosis, replacement fibrosis, and perivascular fibrosis were found among the groups. The mean heart weight of the hypertensive-diabetic patients was significantly greater than that of the hypertensive patients and the diabetic patients. The amount of microscopic fibrosis increased between the groups, the lowest in hypertensive hearts, midrange in diabetic hearts, and highest in hypertensive-diabetic hearts. Total fibrosis correlated with heart weight among diabetic and hypertensive-diabetic patients and was significantly greater among patients with congestive heart failure, most of whom had histories of both hypertension and diabetes. The microscopic grade of fibrosis correlated significantly (p less than 0.01) with a quantitative, histochemical determination of the amount of collagen per milligram of total noncollagenous protein in the heart tissue. Myocardial fibrosis may contribute to the diastolic dysfunction typical of hypertensive-diabetic cardiomyopathy, in which congestive heart failure is a common sequela. The importance of hypertension in the pathogenesis of severe diabetic heart disease is discussed.\r"

  ".W": "Patients with borderline hypertension have exaggerated vascular responses to orthostatic stress produced by tilt or lower body negative pressure (LBNP). It has been suggested that 1) in the supine position, these patients have augmented activity of cardiopulmonary baroreceptors that exerts an increased restraint on sympathetic vasoconstrictor tone; 2) withdrawal of this augmented inhibitory baroreceptor activity during orthostatic stress elicits augmented reflex sympathetic vasoconstrictor outflow; and 3) augmented cardiopulmonary baroreceptor activity may be secondary to impaired arterial baroreflex mechanisms. To test these hypotheses, we recorded muscle sympathetic nerve activity from the peroneal nerve in seven borderline hypertensive subjects and seven age-, sex-, and weight-matched normotensive subjects during three levels of nonhypotensive LBNP and infusions of phenylephrine and nitroprusside. During LBNP, reductions of central venous pressure were similar in borderline hypertensive and normotensive subjects, and arterial pressure and heart rate values were unchanged. Increases of sympathetic nerve activity, however, were significantly greater in borderline hypertensive than in normotensive subjects at each level of LBNP, indicating an augmented gain of the cardiopulmonary baroreflex. To determine whether this augmentation is related to impairment of arterial baroreflexes, we measured changes of sympathetic nerve activity during increases and decreases of arterial pressure produced with infusions of intravenous phenylephrine and nitroprusside. Central venous pressure was held at control levels by LBNP during phenylephrine and saline infusion during nitroprusside. Changes of sympathetic nerve activity during alterations of arterial pressure were similar in borderline hypertensive and normotensive subjects. These data show that cardiopulmonary baroreflex control of SNA is augmented in borderline hypertensive subjects and that this augmentation does not result from an attenuation of the arterial baroreflex.\r"

We investigated whether the cardiovascular and neurohumoral responses to the postural stimulus of head-up tilt were affected after transplantation. Responses in eight heart-lung transplant recipients were studied and compared with those in eight normal subjects matched for age and sex during passive head-up tilt at 45 degrees for 1 hour. The transplant group had a higher initial heart rate (99 +/- 2 versus 68 +/- 2 beats/min, p less than 0.001) and diastolic blood pressure (88 +/- 5 versus 76 +/- 2 mm Hg, p less than 0.05) than did the control group. The increases in heart rate and diastolic blood pressure during head-up tilt were similar in the two groups. Systolic blood pressure remained unchanged. The decrease in cardiac output (30% versus 18%, p less than 0.05) and the increase in systemic vascular resistance (52% versus 28%, p less than 0.05) were greater in the transplant group. Baseline levels of norepinephrine, epinephrine, vasopressin, and plasma renin activity were similar in the two groups. Atrial natriuretic peptide concentrations were higher in the transplant group (26 +/- 3.8 versus 9.7 +/- 1.6 pmol/l, p less than 0.001). During head-up tilt, plasma norepinephrine levels increased to a greater extent in the transplant group than in the control group (83% versus 53%, p less than 0.01), indicating an increased sympathetic response.

  ".U": "90367284\r", 
  ".W": "In acute cardiac rejection, left ventricular diastolic function is altered, and a restrictive ventricular filling pattern occurs. Doppler echocardiographic indexes of mitral inflow have been proposed as sensitive markers of the rejection process. As rejection progresses, the restrictive ventricular filling pattern is reflected by a shortening of isovolumic relaxation time and mitral valve pressure half-time and by an increase in early transmitral filling velocity. Diastolic function is also compromised in the nonrejecting cardiac transplant recipient during the early postoperative period. This study examined the progression in Doppler-derived mitral filling indexes in 25 recent cardiac transplant recipients who demonstrated no histological evidence of transplant rejection. Isovolumic relaxation time, mitral valve pressure half-time, and early transmitral filling velocity were measured at postoperative weeks 1, 2, 4, and 6 on the day that surveillance right ventricular endomyocardial biopsies were performed. The initial indexes were comparable to previously described restrictive parameters and over the 6-week study period evolved into a nonrestrictive filling pattern. This evolution reflects a progressive improvement in postoperative diastolic function and a decrease in left heart filling pressures. None of the evaluated clinical characteristics, including preoperative pulmonary pressures, total ischemic time of the transplanted heart, cardiopulmonary bypass time, and age of the donor heart, correlated with this process. Given the increasing use of Doppler echocardiography as a means of screening for transplant rejection, it is important to have a thorough understanding of normal postoperative changes in left ventricular diastolic function.\r"

A data base of 38 characteristic mean integral maps was composed after visually selecting subgroups with nearly identical total QRS integral morphology and numerically evaluating intrasubgroup pattern uniformity and intersubgroup pattern variability. Corresponding endocardial pacing site locations were computed by a biplane cineradiographic method and outlined as segments on a standardized LV and RV polar projection. LV pacing resulted in 25 markedly different mean total QRS integral patterns, showing higher electrocardiographic sensitivity for anteroseptal (18 patterns) compared with posterolateral regions (seven patterns). RV pacing demonstrated 13 mean total QRS integral patterns, exhibiting less intersubgroup variation and comparatively low electrocardiographic sensitivity for the basal anterior and outflow regions. Comparison of LV with RV pacing revealed that QRS configurations produced at LV apical and LV midseptal sites closely resembled QRS configurations generated at RV apical, RV septal, and RV anterior sites, respectively. Total QRS time integral amplitudes showed considerable intrasubgroup variation but permitted global differentiation of spatially similar QRS patterns obtained during pacing at LV and RV sites. This study demonstrates that the QRS pattern of the total body surface electrocardiogram allows discrimination among 38 different LV and RV segments of ectopic endocardial impulse formation in patients with normal cardiac anatomy.\r"

  ".U": "90367287\r", 
  ".W": "The clinical significance of perioperative myocardial infarction (MI) after coronary artery bypass surgery is not known. Therefore, strategies for the risk stratification of these patients do not exist. This study was undertaken to define the effect of perioperative MI on prognosis after discharge from the hospital and to develop an approach to the risk stratification of these patients. Fifty-nine patients with and 115 patients without perioperative MI were observed for 30 months for the development of cardiac events (death, nonfatal MI, and admission to hospital for unstable angina or congestive heart failure). Patients with perioperative MI were significantly more likely than patients without to have a cardiac event (31% versus 12%, p less than 0.01) and multiple events (19% versus 1%, p less than 0.001). Cox regression analysis identified two independent predictors of cardiac events other than perioperative MI (relative risk, 2.7): inadequate revascularization (relative risk, 3.5) and depressed (less than 40%) postoperative ejection fraction (EF) (relative risk, 2.1). Event-free survival rate of patients with perioperative MI varied markedly depending on the number of other negative prognostic variables present. Patients with perioperative MI who were adequately revascularized and had a postoperative EF greater than 40% had an event-free survival rate similar to patients without a perioperative MI (92% versus 87%, p = NS). Patients with perioperative MI who were inadequately revascularized and had depressed postoperative EF had an event-free survival rate of 13% (p less than 0.001 versus all other subsets). Event-free survival rate was intermediate (68%) in patients with perioperative MI and with only one of the other two variables (p less than 0.001 versus other subsets). In conclusion, perioperative MI adversely affects prognosis. Patients can be stratified into low, high, and intermediate risk subsets based on a simple assessment of the adequacy of revascularization and a determination of residual left ventricular function.\r"

A critical stenosis on the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD), considered as the culprit lesion, was successfully treated by percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA). The patients were divided into two groups according to the admission electrocardiogram: T NEG group (n = 32) had persistent negative T waves, and the T POS group (n = 30) had normal positive T waves on precordial leads. The two groups had similar baseline clinical, hemodynamic, and angiographic characteristics. All patients underwent a complete clinical and angiographic evaluation (coronary arteriography and left ventriculography) before undergoing PTCA and 8 +/- 3 months later. Left ventricular anterior wall motion was evaluated by the percent shortening of three areas (S1, S2, and S3) considered as LAD-related segments on left ventriculograms. Before PTCA, there was no significant difference in global ejection fraction between the two groups despite a significant depression in anterior mean percent area shortening in the T NEG compared with the T POS group (S1, 44 versus 54, p less than 0.01; S2, 39 versus 48, p less than 0.01; S3, 44 versus 50, NS). At repeated angiography, the anterior mean percent area shortening improved significantly in the T NEG group (S1, from 44 to 61, p less than 0.001; S2, from 39 to 58, p less than 0.001; S3, from 44 to 61, p less than 0.001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In 17 patients with one-sided peripheral arterial occlusive disease, neutrophil count, proportion of activated neutrophils (by nitro blue tetrazolium test), and neutrophil filterability as a measure of passive deformability were assessed in the femoral arterial and venous blood of the diseased leg and in the femoral venous blood of the healthy leg (n = 10). The values were obtained at rest, immediately after claudication, and 10 minutes after claudication induced by repetitive toe stands. Immediately after exercise, the arterial and venous blood differences in the diseased leg were 1) neutrophil count, 9% (95% confidence interval [CI], 5-14%; relative increase in the venous blood compared with arterial blood); 2) the proportion of activated neutrophils, 26% (CI, 10-42%); and 3) the neutrophil filterability, -10% (CI, -4% to -15%). At rest and 10 minutes after exercise, neutrophil parameters did not differ significantly between the femoral arterial and venous blood. Furthermore, no arterial and venous blood differences in the neutrophil parameters were found in the healthy leg. In addition to local changes, systemic changes occurred immediately after exercise. In the femoral arterial blood, the total neutrophil count had risen by 13% (CI, 8-18%), the proportion of activated neutrophils had risen by 41% (CI, 25-58%), and average neutrophil rigidity had risen 17% (CI, 11-22%) compared with the values obtained before exercise. At 10 minutes after exercise, all neutrophil parameters were still elevated. We conclude that even short periods of ischemia, as in intermittent claudication, cause local alterations in neutrophil function and distribution.\r"

Dogs with left ventricular hypertrophy were given metoprolol or enalapril for 5-7 days before a 3-hour coronary occlusion. Infarct size and risk area were measured with triphenyltetrazolium chloride stain and barium angiography, respectively. For control (n = 15), left ventricular hypertrophy (n = 17), left ventricular hypertrophy plus metoprolol (n = 12), and left ventricular hypertrophy plus enalapril (n = 15) groups, mean arterial pressure, ratio of infarct size to risk area, and dogs experiencing sudden death were 110 +/- 4, 142 +/- 4, 121 +/- 7, and 120 +/- 3 mm Hg; 44 +/- 5%, 65 +/- 5%, 44 +/- 7%, and 30 +/- 4%; and 27%, 65%, 17%, and 53%, respectively. Thus, the excessive increase in early mortality occurring when dogs with hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy undergo coronary occlusion is interrupted with beta-blockade, possibly via electrophysiological effects rather than by changes in arterial pressure or infarct size.\r"

  ".W": "The mechanisms responsible for slowing cardiac impulse conduction through the atrioventricular (AV) node are not well understood but include anatomical architecture, presence of cells with diverse electrophysiological characteristics, and modulation by autonomic nervous system. The present study was designed to determine the site of vagally induced slowing of conduction through the AV node. We attempted to correlate the electrophysiological response of AV nodal cells to postganglionic vagal stimulation applied in different regions of the node with the morphological findings and patterns of acetylcholinesterase-positive staining of nodal tissue. This multifaceted approach revealed that vagal stimulation produced localized hyperpolarization of the cells from the N region of the AV node, which correlated with the strong acetylcholinesterase positive staining of the central nodal area. In contrast, the density of the acetylcholinesterase staining decreased toward both the AN and His bundle regions, whereas vagal stimulation had a negligible effect on the cells from these regions. These results suggest that vagal-induced depression of AV nodal conduction is produced by release of acetylcholine predominantly around the midnodal region and the depressive action of acetylcholine is concentrated on the cells occupying the same region (i.e., the N cells). Thus, there appears to be a close juxtaposition of nerve elements and effector cells in the midnodal region of the AV node. This unique combination of available neuromediator and responding cells with hyperpolarization and depressed action potential determines the midnodal region as the focus of vagal effect on AV nodal conduction.\r"

  ".W": "In pentobarbital-anesthetized dogs, transcardiac shocks of up to 30 J or pacing stimuli were delivered to myocardial tissue at different times in the electrical cycle. When delivered midway or later into electrical systole, shocks, but not pacing stimuli, greatly extended the refractory period as determined by left ventricular pacing. There was a positive correlation between both the shock energy and timing and the amount of delay. A 30-J shock given 10 msec before the end of the refractory period extended the refractory period by 63 +/- 15 msec (p less than 0.001), whereas the same shock given 40 msec earlier produced only 25 +/- 10 msec (p less than 0.001) of extension. By comparison, a 5-J shock given at those times produced 36 +/- 18 (p less than 0.005) and 10 +/- 8 msec (p less than 0.001) of extension, respectively. When delivered early into electrical systole, both a pacing stimulus and a shock had no substantial effect on the tissue refractory period. Because the tissue that is late in electrical systole would otherwise be the first to repolarize if no shock were given, the selective refractory period extension may create a period after the shock during which no tissue is repolarized to a level sufficient for wavefront propagation. Thus, the energy- and time-dependent refractory period extension may help explain the mechanism by which ventricular defibrillation occurs during transcardiac shocks.\r"

Once extracted, binding of radioactivity by the isolated heart was essentially irreversible, giving this tracer microspherelike qualities. Because Cu-PTSM can be readily prepared with the generator-produced positron-emitting copper 62 and other gamma- or positron-emitting copper radionuclides, we evaluated its usefulness for measuring regional myocardial and renal blood flow in vivo in intact dogs at rest, after ischemia, or after coronary hyperemia was induced by intravenous administration of dipyridamole. After intravenous administration of radiolabeled Cu-PTSM, the tracer cleared rapidly from the blood. Myocardial uptake of single photon-emitting 67Cu-labeled Cu-PTSM was measured directly in myocardial samples 15 minutes after tracer administration, and it increased proportionally with blood flow throughout the flow range (estimated concomitantly with radiolabeled microspheres) of 0.0-6.0 ml/g/min (n = 340 samples from 17 dogs, r = 0.99, Ycopper radioactivity = 85Xmicrosphere flow -7 chi 2 + 17). Renal uptake of radiolabeled Cu-PTSM was also proportional to blood flow. Positron emission tomography was performed in four intact dogs after intravenous administration of 64Cu-labeled Cu-PTSM (19% positron decay, t1/2 = 12.8 hours). High-quality images of heart and kidney were obtained. Accordingly, radiolabeled Cu-PTSM should be a useful, generator-produced tracer for estimating regional myocardial and renal blood flow with positron emission tomography.\r"

Mean Tc-MIBI peak instantaneous extraction was lower (0.55 +/- 0.10, p less than 0.001) and more affected by flow rate (p less than 0.05) than 201Tl peak instantaneous extraction (0.83 +/- 0.06). In contrast, the rate of 201Tl washout was significantly faster (p less than 0.05) and initially more dependent on perfusion rate (p less than 0.05) than Tc-MIBI washout. Reflecting its higher peak instantaneous extraction, 201Tl retention was 55-79% higher immediately after isotope injection (p less than 0.001) than Tc-MIBI retention, and relative changes in maximal 201Tl net uptake correlated better (p less than 0.05) with relative flow changes than maximal Tc-MIBI net uptake. However, due to its faster washout rate, the superiority of thallium over Tc-MIBI as a perfusion indicator was lost within 10 minutes of tracer injection under the present single-pass experimental conditions. These data were interpreted to indicate that 1) Tc-MIBI is not as well extracted and has a slower washout rate than 201Tl; 2) varying the coronary flow rate has significant but divergent effects on the extraction, washout, and retention of Tc-MIBI and 201Tl; and 3) the present results support continued evaluation of Tc-MIBI as a possible perfusion indicator.\r"

  ".W": "Sudden induction of ischemia by occlusion of a major branch of a coronary artery in mammalian heart sets into motion a series of events that culminates in the death of markedly ischemic myocytes. The changes begin within 8-10 seconds of occlusion and include 1) cessation of aerobic metabolism, 2) depletion of creatine phosphate, 3) onset of anaerobic glycolysis (AG), and 4) accumulation of products of anoxic metabolism in the ischemic tissue. Functional defects appear simultaneously, including depressed contractile activity and electrocardiographic changes. The demand of the ischemic myocytes for energy exceeds the supply of high-energy phosphate (approximately P) possible from AG; as a consequence, myocyte adenosine diphosphate increases, and adenylate kinase is activated to capture the approximately P bond of adenosine diphosphate. Adenosine monophosphate is a product of this reaction; it accumulates and is progressively degraded to nucleosides and bases that are lost from the myocyte. The pace of development of the short-term metabolic changes slows after 40-60 minutes of ischemia, at which time most of the severely ischemic myocytes are irreversibly injured. Early in the irreversible phase of injury tissue is characterized as follows by: 1) very low approximately P content (creatine phosphate less than 1-2% and adenosine triphosphate less than 10% of control), 2) a depressed adenine nucleotide pool that consists principally of adenosine monophosphate, 3) virtual cessation of AG, 4) low pH and low glycogen content, 5) high inosine and hypoxanthine contents, 6) a markedly increased osmolar load consisting chiefly of lactate, and 7) characteristic ultrastructural changes including cell swelling and evidence of generalized mitochondrial and marked sarcolemmal damage. Sarcolemmal disruption is the feature that we hypothesize causes irreversibility; however, its pathogenesis is unknown.\r"

  ".U": "90367313\r", 
  ".W": "Thirteen patients with chronic stable effort angina underwent continuous ambulatory electrocardiographic and intra-arterial blood pressure monitoring during normal unrestricted daily activity. Each patient underwent two studies, the first while on no treatment and the second while on beta-blocker therapy. During the control period, we recorded 182 episodes of transient ST-segment depression, of which only 30 were associated with angina, and 43 (24%) were apparently caused by increased myocardial oxygen demand. Although the majority of ischemic events (139) were not preceded by an increase in either heart rate or systolic arterial pressure, most occurred during the daytime when the levels of the rate-pressure product were higher. Throughout the day, beta-blockade significantly decreased the levels of heart rate and blood pressure and reduced the number of ischemic attacks by 56%, particularly if such attacks were not caused by increased myocardial demand. The diurnal distribution of ischemic events was not significantly affected by beta-blockade, and again, the majority were observed during the day, in coincidence with high resting levels of rate-pressure product. Whatever the behavior of heart rate and blood pressure before ischemia, ST-segment depression was invariably associated with a parallel increase in these parameters, highly suggestive of cardiac sympathetic nerve activation. We conclude that: 1) The majority of ischemic events that occurred in patients with stable angina during normal daily activity were apparently not precipitated by an excessive increase in myocardial oxygen demand but rather by transient impairment of regional myocardial perfusion. 2) The observation that most ischemic events occur when the levels of sympathetic nerve activity are high suggests that the sympathetic nervous system may play a key pathophysiological role in this syndrome, as cardiac sympathetic nerve activation can both increase metabolic demand and impair myocardial perfusion. 3) beta-Blockers significantly reduced episodes of transient myocardial ischemia in these patients, primarily by reducing cardiac metabolic requirements. The possibility that sympathetically mediated coronary vasoconstriction may also be affected by these drugs needs further investigation.\r"

Ears in which haemorrhage was absent and where the grommet had extruded did not develop tympanosclerosis. These findings would indicate that bleeding, if causally implicated is not the sole aetiological factor, but careful attention to surgical technique to reduce this may subsequently minimize the development of tympanosclerotic changes.\r"

  ".W": "This study aims to assess the indications for histological examination of polypoid lesions removed from the nose. To achieve this we have performed a national survey of consultant ENT surgeons and reviewed 2866 nasal polypectomy operations. The operations were performed between 1982 and 1988 in the Radcliffe Infirmary, Oxford and the Freeman Hospital, Newcastle. One hundred and fifty questionnaires were sent to randomly selected ENT consultants in the United Kingdom. One hundred and seventeen were returned completed (return rate 78%). The questionnaire asked whether or not the surgeon sent all polyps for examination and, if not, what his indications were for so doing. A retrospective review of all nasal polypectomy operations at the two hospitals was performed. The questionnaire revealed that 38% of the surgeons who replied sent all nasal polyps for examination and 62% did not. The commonest indications for requesting histology were unilateral polyps, abnormal appearance and a history of bleeding. The review of polypectomies showed that 74% of cases in Oxford were examined histologically and 33% in Newcastle. Two per cent of polyps were tumours, of which half were malignant. There were no cases in this study in which unsuspected malignancy was found. All cases of nasal tumours, benign or malignant, were diagnosed clinically either in the Outpatient clinic or in the operating theatre. The results of this survey suggest that it is unnecessary to send all nasal polyps for histological examination.\r"

Clinical parameters, microscopic malignancy grading (according to Jakobsson et al. and Glanz and Eichhorn), DNA cytofluorometry, analysis of therapeutic modalities and statistics regarding survival and prognosis are reported. The mean age was 70 years with a male: female ratio of 1.3:1 One hundred and four patients had T1 or T2 tumours and 109 an N0 neck. Cervical lymph node metastases were more frequent in patients with larger tumours (T3 + T4) than in those with smaller (T1 + T2) (P less than 0.01), in tumours with a high malignancy grading compared to those with a low (P less than 0.05) and in DNA non-diploid tumours compared to diploid ones (P less than 0.001). The aneuploid tumours responded better to preoperative radiotherapy than did diploid (P less than 0.01) or polyploid (P less than 0.05) tumours. Eighty-nine per cent of the recurrences occurred within 1 year of initial therapy. Secondary treatment was successful in 15 of 37 (41%) patients in whom the tumour recurred either at the primary site or in regional lymph nodes, but only in 1 of 8 (12%) with recurrences in both locations. Surgery alone or combined with radiotherapy resulted in equivalent survival rates for tumours in stages I and II. In advanced stages combined radiotherapy and surgery gave better survival figures than either modality alone (P less than 0.01; Kaplan-Meier). The presence of lymph node metastases (P less than 0.001), tumour size (P less than 0.01) and tumour ploidy (P less than 0.005) were the only clinical and histological parameters that significantly influenced survival (Cox regression analysis). Twenty-four patients developed a secondary primary malignancy; 21 of these were located in the aerodigestive tract.\r"

It was found that blood loss was highest when a nasal polypectomy and submucous resection were performed together and over the whole range of nasal surgery studied the actual blood loss was more than double the estimate during surgery. Although the blood volume recovers soon after surgery it was found that even after 6 weeks many patients had still not made up their loss of haemoglobin.\r"

ECG and chest impedance were continuously monitored and recorded. In addition, 20 control children having urological surgery were studied in the same way. All the measures of hypoxaemia (awake SaO2, baseline asleep SaO2, number of hypoxaemic episodes) differed significantly between patients and controls (P less than 0.01). When significant hypoxaemia was defined as a baseline sleeping SaO2 below 90% or one dip in SaO2 of at least 10% below the baseline per hour 15 children were found to have abnormal studies. These children could not be identified from history or clinical examination but using the criteria of mouth breathing, audible respiration at rest and an awake SaO2 of less than 96%, 14 of the 15 children were accurately identified (93% sensitivity, 86% specificity). Thus a combination of the physical signs of mouth breathing and measurement of oxygen saturation whilst awake may provide a useful clinic screening test for children suspected of suffering from sleep apnoea.\r"

In accordance with the relevant literature, which describes analogous cytoprotective effects of calcium antagonists and magnesium in association with extraskeletal calcification and ossification, the qualitative agreement of histologic findings in the epiphyseal growth plate suggests a homologous, primarily intracellular mechanism of action of both magnesium and organic calcium antagonists. This common mechanism of action of the two substances on the molar Mg-Ca quotient, with reference to intracellular calcium phosphate mineralization, is regarded as the cause of the analogous effects.\r"

Good pain relief was accomplished after 24 of the 26 surgical procedures (average follow-up, 4.3 years).

Clinical grading of muscle strength was compared pre- and postoperatively with objective testing using the Cybex II Isokinetic System, with subjective functional assessment by dictation, and with the ability of the patient to return to work. The clinical grade of muscle strength increased postoperatively by approximately one-half of a grade in both forward flexion and external rotation. However, various Cybex parameters did not significantly improve. The postoperative values were significantly less for the operated side than for the uninvolved side. Only weak statistical correlations were found between the clinical muscle grading and objective Cybex evaluation. Pain relief was obtained in 87% of the patients. Eighty-six percent of the patients returned to work, although 43% returned to light duty only. Thirty-two percent of patients reported full recovery, while 58% had decreased but satisfactory function. The study showed that although the clinical assessment of muscle strength improved early after shoulder surgery, the clinical grading of muscle power did not correlate well with objective parameters of strength, endurance, ability to work, or functional assessment. Strength did not recover to the level of the uninvolved opposite shoulder. Endurance, which is not measured by clinical grading, may decrease. Longer follow-up and rehabilitation periods are required to optimize results.\r"

The defects were defined by anatomic location to assess the rates of incorporation at different sites. The average time to incorporation was 12 months, judged by trabecular continuity. Superolateral grafts showed a greater degree of rarefaction than medial grafts. Nonprogressive migration of the graft was seen in only two cases before full incorporation of the graft. Developing lucency was seen up to 2 mm at the prosthesis-graft interface but not at the graft-ilium level. Roentgenograms suggested that integration of porous acetabular prostheses into bone may improve results of reconstructive surgery of the acetabulum.\r"

In 1984, a group of orthopedic surgeons and nurses examined the use of resources for THA patients and changed certain clinical practices to promote more cost-effective hospital care. At the end of the two-year project, orders for complete blood counts fell 72% and mean operating room time dropped 47 minutes for the participating orthopedists. For all orthopedists in the division, average length of stay (ALOS) decreased from 13 to 11 days. By the end of the following year, when clinicians received quarterly length-of-stay (LOS) data, ALOS dropped further to 9.8 days. This significant ALOS reduction was not accompanied by an increase in hospital readmissions or nursing home placements. The ALOS reduction was also not seen in elective coronary artery bypass graft patients whose ALOS did not substantially change over the same period. Two years after the project, ALOS for THA patients remained at ten days or below. This reduction in LOS and in the use of other hospital services translated into a mean total hospital charge decrease of $2045 per THA patient.\r"

The average patient age was 51.9 years. Sixty-four Anatomic Medullary Locking (AML) devices were placed in 58 patients, and 20 Porous-Coated Anatomic (PCA) devices were placed in 20 patients. The AML devices had been in situ an average of 36 months (range, 24-49 months), and the PCA devices had been in situ an average of 40 months (range, 29-51 months). The average patient ages were 52.7 and 49.2 years for AML and PCA patients, respectively. The AML devices included three that were fully coated, 59 that were five-eighths coated, and two that were one-third coated. The average preoperative Harris hip score was 38.2 for the AML devices and 33.2 for the PCA devices. The average postoperative Harris hip score was 80.7 for the AML devices and 83.8 for the PCA devices. Pain related to the implant was present in 30% of the AML devices and 30% of the PCA devices. Roentgenographically, no component demonstrated complete radiolucency, and all components demonstrated roentgenographic evidence of bone ingrowth. Roentgenographic changes with time noted for both the AML and PCA devices included: neck roundoff, neck osteolysis, neck corticocancellization, endosteal bone bridging, and distal hypertrophy. On roentgenographic zonal analysis, radiolucency greater than 1 mm was observed most frequently in the most proximal lateral zone and distal tip of the femoral component. The current series of cases, although clinically acceptable, does not support the current widespread enthusiasm for primary noncemented AML and PCA total hip systems. Cemented THA appears to produce superior clinical results, particularly when contemporary cementing techniques are employed.\r"

Analysis of two illustrative case studies, anatomic specimen cross sections, and computed tomographic scans demonstrate which vessels are at risk of injury should the inner cortex of the pelvis be penetrated. The iliac vessels are at risk of injury when penetration of the inner cortex of the pelvis occurs in the anterosuperior region of the acetabulum. The obturator vessels are at risk when penetration occurs in the anteroinferior quadrant of the acetabulum. The vessels can be within 0.5 cm of the inner cortex of the pelvis and tend to become closer with advancing age. Damage to the intrapelvic vessels may cause profound blood loss and hypotension when screw-fixation acetabular components are used. Rapid identification and immediate surgical repair of vessel lacerations are essential in the treatment of this complication.\r"

There is, however, a small subgroup of severely overcorrected patients in whom TKA is particularly difficult. These patients require special considerations. A complex ligament reconstruction has been developed to allow simultaneous implantation of a minimally constrained total knee prosthesis for patients with failed, severely overcorrected valgus high tibial osteotomies. The technique is described in five patients. The mean age of the group was 57 years and the average follow-up period was 34 months (range, 12-72 months). A 100-point knee-evaluation scale was used to rate the knees before and after TKA. The average pre- and postoperative scores were 50 and 94, respectively. None of the patients was noted to have any more than mild instability in any direction postoperatively. Despite this extensive reconstruction, the group functioned as well as most recipients of more standard primary TKAs and demonstrated it is possible to avoid highly constrained implants, custom prostheses, or major bone grafts.\r"

The shortened left distal femur was lengthened by implanting both amputation fibulae proximally. In the same surgery, the amputation os calcis was fused distally to these fibulae. The right fibula was disarticulated at the knee. The female patient was fitted with bilateral knee disarticulation prostheses. She became fully ambulatory with a walker, progressing to bilateral forearm crutches. Recurrent deformity at the fusion site of the left femoral segment to the fibulae required a subsequent wedge osteotomy and multiple surgeries during the years following. Today she remains ambulatory with the use of nonaxillary crutches, attends public school, and is without pain. She takes part in athletics within the range of her abilities and hopes to obtain a driver's license and use a modified car. She is independent and well adjusted. Her progress has been followed from the age of 11-and-one-half months to present.\r"

Splinting after reduction was used with an intermediate abduction device, which allowed immediate hip function and motion without the risk of redislocation. The results of 1178 treated hips, with follow-up examinations in 809 cases, demonstrate the efficacy of this method even for completely dislocated hips. The procedure is nonaggressive, results in a low incidence of femoral head osteonecrosis (3.4%), and is suitable for children with CDH aged six weeks to about 2.5 years.\r"

A total of 85 samples were taken and analyzed during the first three months after the fractures occurred. Serum BGP significantly increased and positively correlated with the time that had elapsed after the fracture, with an average twofold increase after two months. The fracture site and the duration of immobilization had no influence on the serum BGP levels. Serum BGP levels from the two non-fractured cases increased in the first two weeks with no subsequent consistent trend. These data suggest that serum BGP increases one to two months after a major fracture, possibly as a manifestation of bone repair. Further studies are required to determine the potential clinical value of serum BGP in the management of such patients.\r"

Eel calcitonin produced an increase in the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) content of the mononuclear cells. More than 90% of mononuclear tumor cells expressed monocyte markers; flow cytometric C3b receptor, a macrophage marker, was also detected in a few cells. These findings demonstrate that the mononuclear cells expressed phenotypes of both the osteoclast and monocyte-macrophage and that they originate in a monocyte-macrophage-osteoclast lineage. Giant-cell tumor of bone may thus provide a good model for investigating the mechanism of bone resorption in which cells of osteoclast lineage play a central role.\r"

  ".W": "The authors studied 45 cleft feet from among their patients and 128 from the literature with regard to their roentgenographic morphology. An increasing degree of malformation was found, from deepening of a central interdigital commissure to a monodactylous cleft foot. These observations resulted in a classification of six groups based on the number of metatarsal bones. Types I and II are cleft feet with minor deficiencies, both having five metatarsals. The metatarsals are all normal in Type I and partially hypoplastic in Type II. As the degree of malformation increases, only four metatarsals in Type III, three metatarsals in Type IV, and two metatarsals in Type V can be identified. Type VI represents the monodactylous cleft foot. Of the 173 feet studied, 166 could be assigned to one of these types. Two additional forms were also found: four cleft feet with central polydactyly are described as polydactylous type, and three monodactylous feet with lower-leg diastasis or tibial aplasia or both are described as diastatic type. According to the distribution of syndactylies, synostoses, and aplasias, it became evident that cleft formation begins at the second or third ray. It then proceeds in a longitudinal direction from distal to proximal as well as in a transverse direction from tibial to fibular, while the first ray remains intact. The first ray is only missing in the monodactylous cleft foot, which possesses only the fifth ray. The defects are always larger distally than proximally. Synostoses are found only at the margin of the cleft. Cross-bones are rare and usually occur in mild cases of the deformity. Another rare feature is polydactyly.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Therefore, a poly-segmental lordosis osteotomy of the lumbar spine was introduced in four to six segments using trans-pedicled screws and threaded rods in eight to ten segments (isolated correction is possible for each segment). Instead of dangerous short kinking, a poly-segmental lordosis osteotomy results in harmonious lordosis with a correction per segment of about 10 degrees, and complications are decreased. Of 177 patients undergoing the operation, there was a 2.3% mortality rate with cardiopulmonary problems, 2.3% with irreversible complications, and 18.1% with reversible complications, mostly small root lesions, of which 7% were reoperated. The 173 surviving patients had a correction of 43%, and improvement in body height of 9 cm, and improvement of flexion by 57%. Fifty-three patients have been followed for more tha 18 months. the visual axis in all cases was horizontal. No pseudoarthrosis occurred. After correction, the frequent spondylodiscitis healed. Ninety-two percent were pain free compared with 15% before the operation. Loss of correction of body height was 20%, of flexion 4%, and of the lordosis 7%, which was 18% in 37 patients after three years.\r"

Since anterior and posterior spinal structures are involved, successful decompression, correction, and stabilization require both dorsal and ventral surgery. By using segmental transpedicled and ventrolateral Instrumentation System implants, permanent fixation can be achieved. As a result, the length of the compression spondylodesis and fusion time are short. pedicular anchorage and implant design leave the joints and ligamentum flavum of healthy neighboring segments untouched. In the last five years, over 570 kyphotic deformities, including congenital kyphosis, spondylitis, tumors, and acute and neglected fractures, have been treated with this method. During a three- to five-year follow-up period of 40 patients with posttraumatic kyphoses, no additional neurologic damage, pseudarthrosis, or substantial loss of correction occurred.\r"

  ".W": "An analysis of the patellofemoral joint based on experimental determinations of pressure distributions on the patellar cartilage and vectorial calculations is presented. The extension torque of all quadriceps muscles is similar. The force transmitted to the patella by the retinacula is small in all knee positions. Because the rigid patella has its own lever arms and tendon insertions at different heights, the forces on patellar and quadriceps tendons are unequal. The small patellar contact areas change according to flexion and are dependent on quadriceps force. Retropatellar pressure is thereby limited and becomes independent of flexion angle. By virtue of the direct force transmission of the quadriceps tendon to the femur, the increase in the retropatellar force is strongly limited beyond 70 degrees. The lateral-to-medial ratio of contact areas, pressing forces, cartilage areas, and bone mass is always 1.6:1, whereas the mean pressure is the same on both facets. The osseous form of the patella does not allow identification of dysplasia because cartilage compensates for apparent incongruence, especially about the medial ridge. This permits the rigid patella to adapt itself to very different abutments. Its individual form results from functional adaptation and does not explain chondromalacia. The ventralization of the tibial tuberosity does not alter retropatellar loading. The mediodistal transfer results in a high increase of pressure on both facets.\r"

Packing of the prosthesis in the bone is ensured by large load-bearing surfaces and by specific elements intended for rotational stability. In a comprehensive follow-up review, 497 implants were studied over a period of one to 15 years (average, 45 months). Aseptic loosening occurred in only 1.2% of the prostheses, and deep infection was found in 3% of the patients in the follow-up review. According to survival statistics, the probability of finding prostheses without deep infection or loosening after more than ten years is 89%. The efficiency of total knee arthroplasty (TKA) by hinged prostheses should therefore not be judged by the results obtained with the pioneer implants, which date back to the beginnings of TKA. The clinical results obtained clearly demonstrate that there is 90 degrees knee flexion in more than 88% of the implants. A subjective appraisal demonstrated substantially less pain compared with the preoperative findings. Problems originating from the patella were recorded in less than 10%. However, in 1985, an improved prosthetic design was introduced that also provided for the replacement of the posterior surface of the patella and for a proximally extended patellar bearing. The position of the hinge and implant packing remained unchanged. The results obtained so far with the modified prosthetic design are very good.\r"

  ".W": "The relationship between leukotriene C4 (LTC4), platelet activating factor (PAF), and adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was studied in nine patients and 84 control subjects. A leukocyte adherence inhibition (LAI) assay induced by each of the ligands was used to monitor the subjects for 3 consecutive days or until clinical recovery was noted. LAI was considered to be positive if the nonadherence index (NAI) was greater than 30 for LTC4 or greater than 20 for PAF. LAI was negative in all healthy subjects using both ligands. LTC4-induced LAI was positive in all nine ARDS patients and reverted to negative after recovery from the syndrome, while three (33.3%) of nine patients responded to PAF. In contrast, of the 84 control subjects, LAI was induced by LTC4 in only three (3.3%) and by PAF in five (5.9%). The mean NAI (52.2 +/- 18) of LTC4-induced LAI in ARDS patients was significantly (p less than .05) higher when compared with the control group (-5 +/- 6.4), whereas that of PAF-induced LAI was less than 20 in both groups, indicating that LTC4 is a more specific ligand than PAF. All three patients in whom ARDS was caused by sepsis responded to both LTC4 and PAF, but results of specific receptor-antagonist experiments indicated that each compound acted independently. The mean NAI for LTC4 (58.5 +/- 10) and PAF (49.1 +/- 12) in patients with septic ARDS were significantly (p less than .05) higher when compared with those of patients with sepsis alone (0.5 +/- 9.9 and 4.4 +/- 17, respectively).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Intermittent hemodialysis in critically ill patients is often accompanied by circulatory instability and hypotension. This may hamper the removal of fluid. Therefore, slow, continuous arterial-venous hemodiafiltration (CAVHD), using the patient's arterial-venous pressure difference, was developed. In 17 critically ill patients with acute renal failure, CAVHD was initiated. Most patients (n = 13) suffered from septic shock. Five (29%) patients survived and in six (35%), renal function was recovered. Average length of treatment was 15 days. The filter life was 52 h. When a dialysate rate of 1600 ml/h was employed, urea clearance was sufficient and hemodialysis was no longer needed as compared with a dialysate rate of 800 ml/h. Hyponatremia developed in all but one patient, but was more severe in the group treated with a dialysate fluid containing 132 mmol/L Na. After using a dialysate with a higher Na content of 140 mmol/L, the average serum Na concentration was 131 mmol/L. Convective Na transport by ultrafiltration was probably responsible for most of the Na loss. In 13 (76%) patients, thrombocytopenia was present. In one patient a hematoma developed in the groin, but could be controlled by local pressure. It is concluded that CAVHD is a safe technique that might replace intermittent hemodialysis in critically ill patients.\r"

Abnormal Mg and ionized Ca levels on admission were found in 43.3% and 17% of the patients, respectively.

  ".W": "To evaluate hemodynamics during human CPR, 32 patients with witnessed cardiac arrest were studied during manual and mechanical conventional CPR. In eight patients during manual conventional CPR, peak systolic radial artery, right atrial (RAP), and pulmonary artery pressures were found to be similar (59.8 +/- 4.3, 70.8 +/- 4.7, 71.2 +/- 8.2 mm Hg) and higher than external jugular venous pressure (33.8 +/- 1.9 mm Hg, p less than .0001). The diastolic radial artery to RAP gradient was found to be only 10.7 +/- 2.1 mm Hg. In four patients, maneuvers that avoid chest compression and thus obviate cardiac compression, i.e., rhythmic compression of the abdomen, yielded arterial pressures comparable to those generated by conventional CPR (48 +/- 6.4 vs. 52.8 +/- 3.4 mm Hg, NS). In 13 other patients during mechanical conventional CPR at constant chest compression force, radial artery pressure was higher during the first compression after ventilation as compared with subsequent chest compressions (67.5 +/- 5.0 vs. 61.9 +/- 4.8 mm Hg, p less than .007). These hemodynamic observations are similar to those reported in large dogs during CPR and support the generation of vascular pressures during CPR by an increase in intrathoracic pressure. They also suggest that despite anatomic differences, the similarity of hemodynamics in dogs and humans justifies the use of large dogs as a human model during acute resuscitation studies.\r"

Data were analyzed from 36 transfusions in 32 patients who were undergoing continuous hemodynamic monitoring. Transfusions were administered for moderate to severe anemia, mean Hgb 8.3 g/dl. The diagnosis were sepsis (19/36), cardiogenic shock (14/36), connective tissue disease (2/36), and severe hypocalcemia (1/36). Benefit from transfusion was defined as an improvement in tissue oxygen utilization (increased oxygen consumption [VO2] or decreased lactate), a decrease in myocardial VO2 (MAP x HR), or a decrease in myocardial work (left ventricular work index). Mean transfusion volume was 577 ml over 4.5 h. Hgb and oxygen delivery (DO2) increased by 27% and 28%, respectively, while pulmonary artery wedge pressure and cardiac index were unchanged. No significant change was noted in VO2, or lactate, after augmentation of red cell mass. An increase occurred in myocardial work indices and MAP x HR. No changes were identified when subgroups were analyzed based on diagnosis, pretransfusion Hgb, lactate, or VO2 levels. We conclude that selective increase in DO2 by augmentation of RBC mass and oxygen-carrying capacity did not improve the shock state in these volume-resuscitated patients, regardless of the etiology of the shock.\r"

On our 162-bed medical service, construction of a separate cardiac care unit and the expansion of the MICU increased the number of core intensive care beds by 100%. We prospectively analyzed noncardiology MICU admissions 2 months before, immediately after, and 4 months after MICU expansion. Although the volume of MICU patients increased by 51% after MICU expansion, the severity of illness as determined by the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE II) score and types of admission diagnoses remained the same. Moreover, there was no change in MICU occupancy and length of stay, hospital or MICU mortality, or MICU readmission rate. The increased MICU patient volume came from the ED, transfers from other hospitals, and from other ICUs within our hospital. In contrast, the volume and severity of illness of MICU transfers from the inpatient medical floor service were constant in all time periods. These results suggest that, while MICU expansion increased patient volume, physician utilization of the MICU resources was unchanged. Our physicians used high-intensity ICU beds in a consistent fashion in response to external factors, such as ED activity, intramural ICU transfers, and referrals from other hospitals.\r"

Grading of patients may be of value to identify high-risk cases but this has never been prospectively evaluated. Conventional treatment with atropine may lead to CNS toxicity, although control of secretions may still be inadequate. We conducted a randomized, controlled trial in 44 patients to compare atropine with glycopyrrolate, a drug that may provide better control of secretions and does not cross the blood-brain barrier. Grading was performed prospectively and compared to outcome. Thirty-nine cases were evaluated (atropine 22, glycopyrrolate 17); the treatment groups were comparable at baseline. No differences could be detected in outcome except for a trend to fewer respiratory infections in the glycopyrrolate group. Thus, treatment with atropine and glycopyrrolate was equally effective. A grading of serious was associated with ventilation, complications, and a prolonged ICU stay. A revised simplified grading is proposed.\r"
