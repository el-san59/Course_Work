Of the 29 patients with abdominal pain, 12 had infectious diarrhea, eight were diagnosed as having ileus or organomegaly, and nine had miscellaneous causes for their pain. Only five patients underwent laparotomy. Two patients were operated on for pain associated with bleeding (Meckel's diverticulum and intestinal Kaposi's sarcoma); one had a perforated duodenal ulcer and one had severe ileitis. One patient was electively operated on for Burkitt's lymphoma. Laparotomy for abdominal pain is not usually necessary in patients with AIDS.

Patients who had a Kock pouch had a greater incidence of persistent postoperative dyspareunia than patients who underwent an ileoanal procedure (38% vs. 18%, p less than 0.02). Only one patient in each group reported a postoperative disturbance in ability to achieve orgasm. Most women reported no change in their menstrual cycle, but patients with a Kock pouch had more episodic vaginal discharge than patients with an ileoanal anastomosis (18% vs. 0%, p less than 0.001). Postoperative fertility was minimally impaired. Overall, the majority of women in this study who underwent proctocolectomy for benign diseases experienced enhanced sexual function after operation, which they attributed mainly to improved health.\r"

Seventy patients with colorectal or gastric cancer were compared with a control group of 23 patients with nonmalignant illness. Twenty-seven patients with cancer and 13 control patients had lost more than 10% of their pre-illness body weight. Fat and carbohydrate oxidation rates were derived from measurements of oxygen consumption, carbon dioxide production, and urinary nitrogen excretion. Patients with cancer had significantly higher fat oxidation rates (p less than 0.01) and significantly lower carbohydrate oxidation rates (p less than 0.05) when compared with controls. Weight-losing cancer patients had significantly higher fat oxidation rates when compared with weight-stable cancer patients (p less than 0.02), weight-stable controls (p less than 0.01), and weight-losing controls (p less than 0.02). Cancer patients with liver metastases (N = 14) had significantly higher fat oxidation rates (p less than 0.01) and significantly lower carbohydrate oxidation rates (p less than 0.01) compared with cancer patients who had localized disease. There were no significant differences among the groups with respect to resting energy expenditure when expressed as kilocalorie per kilogram lean body mass per day. The presence of cancer appears to be associated with abnormal fat and carbohydrate metabolism. The increased rate of fat oxidation seen in patients with cancer, especially those with weight loss or liver metastases, may be a significant factor in the development of cancer cachexia.\r"

  ".W": "The clinical courses of 347 patients undergoing gallbladder surgeries were monitored to study the epidemiology of postcholecystectomy wound infection in a hospital in which high-risk patients received prophylactic antibiotics. Overall, 3.8% of patients had wound infections. Patients who had positive bile cultures taken during surgery or positive intraoperative wound cultures had higher rates of infection than patients with negative cultures. However, there was a poor correlation among the bacterial isolates that were recovered from the bile or the wound surface during surgery and from postoperative infections. Antibiotic-sensitive enteric bacteria were recovered from bile samples at surgery, gram-positive organisms and enteric gram-negative bacteria were isolated from intraoperative cultures of the wound surface, and antibiotic-resistant gram-negative bacteria or enterococci were recovered from wounds that developed postoperative infections. There was a strong association between the prior receipt of prophylactic antibiotics and infections with antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Data suggest that bactibilia is still an important epidemiologic marker that identifies patients at high risk for subsequent wound infection. However, in patients who have received prophylactic antibiotics, intraoperative cultures cannot be relied on to guide the choice of empiric therapeutic antibiotics for postoperative infections. Bacteria responsible for these infections are not identified by cultures taken at the time of surgery and are often resistant to the class of antibiotics used for prophylaxis.\r"

Fifty-five per cent of the patients had malignant tumors in the region of the head of the pancreas. The overall operative mortality rate was 2.8%. Anastomotic leakage and fistulae occurred in 19% of the patients. Pancreatic, biliary, and enteric fistulae represented 11%, 4%, and 4%, respectively. Peptic ulcers were subsequently diagnosed in seven patients (3%), two of whom required vagotomy and antrectomy. Delayed recovery of gastric function was the most common complication of this operation, with an overall incidence of 30%. Although the cause of this gastric dysfunction is unknown, its transient nature in most patients makes expectant therapy with gastric tube drainage the best remedy when the problem is encountered. Pylorus-preserving pancreatoduodenectomy decreased the incidence of postgastric surgery syndromes that are commonly associated with the standard Whipple operation. The existing data support the continued use of the operation and the need for future laboratory and clinical investigation of its physiologic impact.\r"

  ".W": "As patients with cystic fibrosis live longer, spontaneous pneumothoraces are seen with increasing frequency. Severe underlying pulmonary disease in these patients makes them particularly susceptible to life-threatening respiratory distress. Several modalities, including chemical sclerosis and open thoracotomy with pleurectomy, have been used to treat pneumothoraces in these patients. In the past 4 years, pneumothoraces in five patients (ages 9-22 years) with cystic fibrosis have been treated with thoracoscopy and talc poudrage. All procedures were performed under either regional or general anesthesia, depending on the age of the patient. Thoracoscopy was performed with a rod lens system and a 5.5-mm trocar, using biopsy forceps to lyse pleural adhesions, all of which ensures access to the entire pleural surface. United States Pharmacopeia-certified talc was insufflated to cover the entire pleural surface. There were no complications, and the patients had minimal pleural pain. Follow-up ranged from 6 months to 4 years. No patient has had a recurrent pneumothorax on the treated side. Thoracoscopy with talc poudrage is a preferable alternative to chemical sclerosis or thoracotomy for treating pneumothoraces in patients with cystic fibrosis. The procedure may be performed under regional anesthesia and allows rapid and complete sclerosis of the pleural cavity.\r"

The transient increase in ICP is not observed during hypertonic saline (HS) resuscitation. The effect of colloid resuscitation on ICP is unknown. Beagles were anesthetized, intubated, and ventilated, maintaining pCO2 between 30-45 torr. Femoral artery, pulmonary artery, and urethral catheters were positioned. ICP was measured with a subarachnoid bolt. Forty per cent of the dog's blood volume was shed and the shock state maintained for 1 hour. Resuscitation was done with shed blood and a volume of either NS (n = 5), 3% HS (n = 5), or 10% dextran-40 (D-40, n = 5) equal to the amount of shed blood. Intravascular volume was then maintained with NS. ICP fell from baseline values (4.7 +/- 3.13 mmHg) during the shock state and increased greatly during initial fluid resuscitation in NS and D-40 groups, to 16.0 +/- 5.83 mmHg and 16.2 +/- 2.68 mmHg, respectively. ICP returned to baseline values of 3.0 +/- 1.73 mmHg in the HS group with initial resuscitation and remained at baseline values throughout resuscitation. NS and D-40 ICP were greater than HS ICP at 1 hour (p less than .001) and 2 hours (p less than .05) after resuscitation. These results demonstrate that NS or colloid resuscitation from hemorrhagic shock elevates ICP and that HS prevents elevated ICP.\r"

Fasted rats were orally administered either saline, 10 micrograms/kg dm PGE2, 20% NAC, or 10 micrograms/kg dm PGE2 plus 20% NAC. In the first study, the rats were killed 15 minutes later and their stomachs were removed and assayed for barrier mucus adherent to the gastric wall using the Alcian blue technique. In the second study, the rats were orally given 2 mL of absolute ethanol (EtOH) after receiving one of these pretreatment regimens, and 5 minutes later they were killed and their stomachs were evaluated histologically by light microscopy for the magnitude of EtOH injury. Although NAC significantly reduced the thickness of barrier mucus by 76% when compared with control animals, it did not adversely affect the ability of dm PGE2 to spare the deep epithelium from injury by EtOH. In fact, NAC was as effective a protective agent as dm PGE2. Neither agent prevented damage to the surface epithelium by EtOH, verifying previous studies regarding the protective effects of prostaglandins. These results indicate that both dm PGE2 and NAC prevent EtOH-induced damage to the deeper layers of the gastric mucosa independent of mucus gel layer thickness, suggesting that other mechanisms than mucus are involved in mediating this protection.\r"

In ten patients echocardiography of left ventricular function (LVF) was performed before operation and 2 weeks after operation. Electrocardiograms (ECG) were done before operation, during operation immediately after sectioning each sympathetic chain, and at 2 weeks after operation. The mean pulse rate decreased significantly in patients after they underwent bilateral UDS. There were no clinical arrhythmias or changes in LVF in any patient. Submaximal exercise testing and ECG tracings done at rest and after effort were obtained for 29 patients before undergoing bilateral UDS, 30 days after operation, and 1-3 more times within a 2-year postoperative period. Pulse rates taken at rest and after effort were significantly lower than those taken after operation, and the blood pressure response to exercise was blunted. ECG tracings showed a significant change in the electrical frontal plane axis and shortening of the QTc interval. These changes were evident 30 days after operation and persisted for 2 years. In conclusion, bilateral UDS has no overt arrhythmogenic effect in the young, healthy heart and its beta-blocker-like effect persists for at least 2 years.\r"

Although complications included calcific degeneration of the valve and disruption of the conduit at the site of insertion into the ventricular apex, we continue to believe in the utility of this procedure in a few patients with complex left ventricular outflow tract obstruction.\r"

Minimal tumor remains after this procedure; palliation and occasional long-term survival may be achieved in properly selected patients. Extrapleural pneumonectomy for diffuse, malignant mesothelioma was done in 33 patients (27 male and 6 female) with 18 procedures on the left side and 15 on the right. There was a history of exposure to asbestos in 16 (48%) of the patients. Histological classification revealed that 20 tumors were epithelial, 10 were mixed, and 3 were sarcomatous. Good palliation, defined as survival for 24 months with a return to fairly normal activities, was obtained in 8 patients (24%) and survival for 36 months was achieved in 5 patients. Three patients died of the disease at 59 months, 60 months, and 82 months. There were 3 operative deaths (9.1%), and serious postoperative complications occurred in 8 patients (24%). Postoperative adjunctive therapy consisting of chemotherapy or irradiation or both was given to approximately one-half of the patients. These findings indicate that extrapleural pneumonectomy for malignant mesothelioma can be done with an acceptable morbidity and mortality. Palliation is achieved in 24% of patients, and there may be an occasional long-term survivor.\r"

Mean age was 53.8 +/- 12 years. One hundred ninety-three patients (50.9%) had some type of concomitant operation, such as tricuspid annuloplasty, coronary artery bypass grafting, or resection of ascending aortic aneurysm. Ninety-one percent were in New York Heart Association (NYHA) Functional Class III or IV preoperatively. Early mortality and late mortality were 7.7% (29 patients) and 13.5% (51 patients), respectively. The actuarial survival at 7 1/2 years was 74.1 +/- 2.7% for the total group and 69.0 +/- 4.5% for those having AVR, 81.0 +/- 3.2% for those having MVR, and 67.0 +/- 8.9% for those having double valve replacement. All patients but 2 were maintained on a regimen of chronic anticoagulation with warfarin sodium. Twenty-six thromboembolic episodes occurred (2.1/100 patient-years): 13 after MVR (2.3/100 patient-years), 11 after AVR (2.1/100 patient-years), and 2 after double valve replacement (1.4/100 patient-years). Four thromboembolic episodes were fatal; no valve thrombosis occurred. There were no structural failures. Of the 350 late survivors, 92% were in NYHA Functional Classes I and II. Total valve-related complications have been minimal.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The technique involves dissection and mobilization of the AV fat pad with exposure and cryoablation of the AV junction at the site of the AV pathways. One hundred five consecutive patients with WPW syndrome with left ventricular free wall (74), posterior septal (23), and right ventricular free wall AV pathways (11) were operated on between July, 1982, and September, 1985. Three patients had multiple accessory pathways, and 9 had associated cardiac disease. Electrophysiological testing to determine the presence and site of the AV pathway was performed before and after dissection of the fat pad and again after cryoablation of the AV junction. All AV pathways but 1 were successfully ablated. There were no deaths and no incident of AV block. One hundred four patients remain free from arrhythmia in the absence of drugs after a mean follow-up of 18 months (range, 2 to 42 months). Four patients required a second operation within the first few weeks for recurrence of AV pathway conduction, and 1 patient required a third operation. In 3 of these patients, AV pathway conduction persisted after extensive dissection and exposure of the AV junction and disappeared only after cryoablation. Recurrence of AV pathway conduction in the latter patients suggests the presence of a subendocardial pathway protected from cryoablation by the warm, circulating blood pool. The closed-heart technique appears safe and efficacious. A potential limitation may be the presence of subendocardial AV pathways, which may require an alternative surgical approach at the site of the pathway to attain uniform primary success.\r"

Two died of other causes before five years, one (T2 N0) of a pulmonary embolus on the seventh postoperative day, and the other (T2 N1) of carcinoma of the prostate at 50 months. Seven patients (70%) remained well and disease-free at five years postoperation. Two of the 7 died of unrelated causes, one (T2 N0) at 72 months and one (T2 N1) at 108 months. Five remain well at 61 to 112 months after resection.

Fifty percent of the infected patients received perioperative clindamycin prophylaxis. A retrospective study was conducted in which the odds ratio estimate of the relative risk of sternotomy infection or endocarditis for patients receiving clindamycin prophylaxis compared with patients receiving cefamandole was found to be 17.0 (p less than .001) using population controls and 8.25 (p less than .001) using matched controls. Seventy-five percent of the organisms causing infections, principally Staphylococcus epidermidis, were resistant in vitro to clindamycin. Perioperative clindamycin administration was not fully effective in preventing wound infection following cardiac surgery at our hospital, thus providing indirect evidence for the efficacy of prophylaxis with cephalosporin-containing regimens. Trials of alternative antibiotics to clindamycin for prophylaxis in penicillin-allergic patients undergoing cardiac surgery are indicated.\r"

  ".W": "Adjuvant slow calcium channel blockade theoretically minimizes the calcium influx attendant to potassium-induced cardioplegic arrest, particularly if clinically acceptable levels of cardiac hypothermia are not maintained. The present study assessed the efficacy of diltiazem therapy in ameliorating perturbations of myocardial oxygen consumption that could be attributable to postischemic intracellular calcium accumulation. In 30 canine hearts, myocardial oxygen consumption was determined during incremental isovolumic pressure-volume loading before and 30 minutes after 2 hours of either 20 or 28 degrees C potassium cardioplegic arrest. The intracoronary perfusate in randomized hearts was modified by the addition of diltiazem, 150 micrograms/kg. Although systolic performance (as defined by peak developed pressure as compared with balloon volume curves) was unchanged after 20 degrees C ischemia, adjuvant diltiazem therapy prevented the 44 +/- 2% (p less than .01) decrease in peak developed pressure after 28 degrees C arrest. Moreover, the 39% augmentation of postischemic myocardial oxygen consumption at specific peak developed pressure following both 20 and 28 degrees C ischemia was attenuated with diltiazem only after the warmer ischemic interval. This difference was characterized by a larger (35 +/- 2 vs. 26 +/- 2%; p less than .025) decrease in postischemic oxygen extraction despite a comparable hyperemia. These data suggest that adjuvant diltiazem therapy during potassium-induced cardioplegic arrest preserves energy-efficient pump function only after warmer ischemia, thereby limiting the clinical application of this myoprotective regimen.\r"

We analyzed the efficacy of subendocardial resection in 24 patients with coronary artery disease and VT. All patients underwent preoperative and intraoperative mapping before subendocardial resection. Postoperative electrophysiologic studies were performed in the drug-free state 7 to 14 days after subendocardial resection. Group 1 (n = 14) had anterior, septal, or lateral sites of origin, and Group 2 (n = 10) had inferior or posterior sites of origin. Localization of presystolic electrical activity during VT by preoperative and intraoperative mapping was comparable in both groups (100%). Resectability of the site of origin was higher in Group 1. Induction of VT during a postoperative electrophysiological study was higher in Group 2. Perioperative mortality was comparable. Postoperative antiarrhythmic therapy was instituted more frequently in Group 2. Actuarial survival analysis showed improved patient survival at one year after subendocardial resection for both groups. The efficacy of subendocardial resection is related to site of origin of VT: Subendocardial resection is less efficacious in VT with inferior or posterior sites of origin because of nonresectability of the arrhythmogenic area.\r"

Compared with placebo, CGS-13080 suppressed thrombin-stimulated platelet thromboxane B2 production by 90% during cardiopulmonary bypass (p less than .001), an effect that persisted for two hours after stopping the infusion. In the CGS-13080-treated group, plasma 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha levels significantly increased over time (p less than .03) and were somewhat higher when compared with those in the placebo-treated group. This observation suggests that an \"endoperoxide shunt\" may have occurred. In the control group, an inverse correlation between platelet count and level of thromboxane B2 per platelet following in vitro thrombin stimulation (r = .5, p less than .001) was apparent, but there was no correlation between these two variables (r = .18, p less than .10) in the CGS-13080-treated group. No adverse hemodynamic or other effects attributable to CGS-13080 occurred during or immediately following cardiopulmonary bypass. These results suggest that CGS-13080 is an effective inhibitor of thromboxane B2 production during cardiopulmonary bypass in dogs and has no adverse physiological effects.\r"

  ".W": "The Blalock-Taussig (BT) shunt remains the standard systemic-to-pulmonary artery shunt. We reviewed our experience with the classic BT shunt in terms of mortality, patency, duration of palliation, and growth of the pulmonary artery. Records were reviewed in 49 consecutive patients, 25 of whom were less than one month old at the time of operation. They underwent a total of 53 BT shunts. Also, the pulmonary artery index (PAI), or the sum of the cross-sectional areas of the right and left pulmonary arteries standardized by the body surface area (BSA), was calculated. There were 4 operative deaths (7.5%) and 1 late death (2.0%). Early shunt thrombosis (within 72 hours postoperatively) occurred in 3 patients. Four patients required a second BT shunt, 5 underwent a palliative outflow tract reconstruction, and 5 required a polytetrafluoroethylene graft. Twenty-one patients underwent a corrective procedure, and 26 underwent a second cardiac catheterization. Of these 26 patients, 24 represent the subgroup used to assess the growth of the pulmonary arteries. The mean duration of palliation was 25.15 months. Mean PAI increased significantly from 127 +/- 40 mm2/BSA pre-shunt to 286.1 +/- 144 mm2/BSA post-shunt (p less than .004). This series demonstrates that the pulmonary arteries do grow after BT shunt. Pulmonary artery growth in patients with tetralogy of Fallot was greater than that in patients with single ventricle, and the duration of palliation was acceptable in most patients. Calculation of PAI may aid in the decision whether to perform a corrective surgical procedure or a second palliative shunt procedure.\r"

In each case, two distal anastomoses were made: one side-to-side to the isolated popliteal segment and the other end-to-side to a tibial or peroneal artery. Twenty-three of 25 grafts were successful; there was an immediate increase in ankle/brachial pressure index and limb salvage. Patency rates calculated by life table analysis were 90.2% at six months, 83.8% at one year, and a stable interval patency thereafter. For comparison, 65 standard femoro-tibial or peroneal vein grafts performed during the same time interval by the same surgeons were analyzed. Each graft had one distal anastomosis to a tibial or peroneal artery. Graft patency was 75% at six months, 72.6% at one year, 54.5% at two years, and 49.7% at three years. The superior patency rate of the sequential grafts was statistically significant (p less than .03). We conclude that the sequential vein graft technique may result in more complete extremity revascularization and increased graft flow, thereby improving patency rates. In selected patients with an isolated popliteal segment and a patent distal tibial or peroneal artery, the sequential graft technique should be considered.\r"

The most frequent indication for FNAB in this series occurred in 35 (53.0%) patients in whom the results of lesser procedures had been normal. Coexisting pulmonary disease, bilateral pulmonary lesions, distant metastases, and refusal to undergo surgical procedures accounted for the remaining patients. The results indicated a sensitivity (true-positive rate) of 95% and a specificity (true-negative rate) of 100%. Pneumothoraces followed aspiration biopsy in 8 patients (13.6% of the entire group), and a thoracostomy tube was required in 7 patients (10.6% of the entire group). The use of FNAB in patients suspected of harboring lung tumors furnished prompt and accurate results without serious complications. Increased experience by thoracic surgeons with this simple diagnostic tool is recommended.\r"

Such measurements, when performed without computer-based analysis, are associated with substantial variability between observers, as well as within a single observer. In addition, recent intraoperative measurements of coronary reserve in individual obstructed vessels of patients with multivessel coronary disease performed with a suction Doppler probe indicate that, in the intermediate range (10% to 90% diameter stenosis), percent stenosis measurements of coronary lesions by angiography correlates poorly with coronary reserve. These studies suggest that the physiologic significance of coronary obstructions cannot be accurately assessed by visual interpretation of coronary angiograms. More sophisticated and accurate approaches are needed for assessing the physiologic significance of coronary obstructions preoperatively.\r"

A dose response was observed, with 67% local control at 4000 rad (4000 cGy) and 91% local control at 5000 rad (5000 cGy). Despite the more advanced clinical stage of the irradiated patients, no significant difference in survival was seen between groups, with a five-year survival rate of 52% in the irradiated patients and 48% in patients treated by surgery alone. Preoperative high-dose radiotherapy was well tolerated, with a 5% incidence of major complications in both groups.\r"

  ".W": "From 1972 to 1983, we treated 78 patients who had primary epidermoid carcinoma of the anus. Forty-four of these patients were treated by protocol, while 34 patients were not treated according to protocol. Protocol consisted of fluorouracil (750 mg/m for 5 days) and mitomycin (10 to 15 mg/m on day 1), followed sequentially by 3000 rad (30 Gy) over three weeks, followed by surgery. There were 20 local excisions and 29 abdominoperineal resections in the protocol group, and 11 local excisions and 14 abdominoperineal resections in the nonprotocol group. In the protocol group, 26 patients (59%) had no residual cancer in their operative specimens, while only ten (29.9%) of the nonprotocol patients had no remaining cancer. Four (11.7%) of the 34 nonprotocol patients had pathologically positive inguinal nodes, compared with only three (4.5%) of 44 protocol patients. Thirty-four (77%) of 44 protocol patients remained free of disease, while ten patients experienced local or pelvic recurrence. In contrast, only 17 (50%) of 34 patients in the nonprotocol group remained free of disease. Of 17 recurrences, five were at distant sites. The status at this writing of all patients in the protocol group was 32 (75%), with no evidence of disease, four alive with disease, and eight dead of or with disease. Of the untreated patients, only 11 (32%) remained without evidence of disease, two were alive with disease, and 19 were dead of or with disease. Smaller carcinoma size (less than 5 cm, 27 of 32 had no evidence of disease), younger age, female gender, and deep infiltration also predicted a statistically significant survival advantage after protocol treatment. Controlled, prospective, multi-institutional trials should stratify for these factors when comparing new treatment modalities.\r"

Intraoperative GDP counts with tumor-tissue ratios of 1.5:1 or greater were obtained from 15 (75%) of 20 tumor sites, with ratios averaging 2.3:1 for fragments and 3.4:1 for whole antibody. The GDP counts contributed to intraoperative decision making in three patients, either by localization of tumor not identified by inspection or palpation or by mapping margins of resection with histologic confirmation of a local/regional recurrence. These preliminary data demonstrate that probe-directed, intraoperative radioimmunodetection can assist the surgeon in detecting subclinical tumor deposits and thus better evaluate the extent of primary or recurrent colorectal cancers intraoperatively.\r"

To understand the limitations of whatever axillary procedure is recommended, we undertook a retrospective analysis of the records of 277 women who had undergone radical or modified radical mastectomy. Of this group, 127 had metastases to at least one axillary or interpectoral lymph node. Skip metastases occurred in 13% of women with positive nodes; two women (1.6%) had metastases only to level III nodes, and two women had metastases only to interpectoral nodes. The extremely uncommon occurrence of metastases to level III alone or to interpectoral nodes alone, but the greater likelihood of skip metastases to level II, argues for both level I and level II axillary dissection preceding irradiation for patients with invasive carcinomas of the breast.\r"

In a chromium 51-release microcytotoxicity assay, PBLs, when activated in vitro against autologous tumor cells in interleukin-2, generated marked cytotoxicity against the autologous targets. In four solid-tumor systems, such generation of cytotoxicity in the PBLs could be suppressed by T-cell lines or clones derived from lymphocytes from tumor-affected lymph nodes (LNLs). The suppressions, mediated by both T8+ suppressor and T4+ suppressor-inducer cells, were restricted against only the autologous tumors in two systems. In the other cases, the suppressions were nonspecific. Clarification of the receptors through which these types of regulation are mediated might provide a new approach for immunotherapeutic manipulations in cancer.\r"

Thickness, depth of penetration, and bone involvement appear to represent the degree of general tumor aggressiveness better than does surface extent. A substitution of thickness measurement for surface diameter (T) in the present TNM staging system is suggested.\r"

Following a 16-week induction period, animals were killed and tumor formation was recorded. Tumor formation in the ascorbic acid supplement group was found to be significantly less than the control group. The beta-carotene group showed no difference in tumor formation compared with the placebo-beadlet control group. Tumor incidence was generally the same between the two control groups, and the ascorbic acid group had significantly fewer tumors than the beta-carotene group. In sum, ascorbic acid supplements in high doses significantly decreased tumor formation, whereas beta-carotene supplements in moderately high doses had no effect on tumor formation in this model.\r"

  ".W": "Recent developments in adjuvant treatment of soft tissue sarcomas of the extremities have altered the surgical approach to this disease. To assess the effects of changing management on local recurrence rates and to examine factors governing local failure, we reviewed the records of 315 adults with operable, nonmetastatic soft tissue sarcoma of the lower extremity who were treated at one institution over a ten-year period. The median follow-up was 8.2 years. One third of our patients presented with locally recurrent tumors after initial treatment elsewhere. Sixty-six percent of the lesions were above the knee, and 60% were high grade. Two thirds of the patients underwent limb-sparing surgery (LSS), which in the latter half of the study period outnumbered amputations by four to one. Local recurrence was directly related to the adequacy of the surgical margins. Adjuvant radiotherapy and chemotherapy did not significantly decrease local recurrence in patients who underwent LSS, although favorable trends were observed. A significantly increased risk of local failure was associated with age greater than 53 years, presentation with local recurrence, high tumor grade, deep location, positive nodes, and less than adequate surgical margins. Local failure also varied significantly with histologic type and was highest in patients with embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma and neurofibrosarcoma. Improved local control, particularly in patients with high-grade tumors, was observed in the latter half of the study period despite the increased use of LSS. When the data were subjected to multivariate analysis, the following variables emerged as independent predictors of local failure: age greater than 53 years, presentation with local recurrence, high grade, less than adequate margins, embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma, and neurofibrosarcoma. The key to local control of sarcomas of the extremities is resection of the tumor with adequate margins. The role of adjuvant treatment, particularly following LSS, is still being evaluated. The risk factor profile should be considered when selecting a treatment program for patients with lower extremity sarcomas.\r"

In the 77 patients with primary colorectal cancer who had had \"curative\" resection, DNA content of the tumor was an independent prognostic indicator in predicting both relapse-free and overall survival. Logistics regression analysis demonstrated that aneuploidy, ie, tumors that exhibited a population of cells with an \"abnormal\" DNA content, was the single most important variable in predicting both recurrence and death from disease, even more important than stage. However, in 56 patients with hepatic metastases from colorectal cancer, the DNA content of the liver metastases bore no relationship to the patients' survival or their response to therapy. These data suggest that tumor DNA content is an important prognostic indicator in patients with primary colorectal carcinoma but does not reflect the natural history of patients with liver metastases.\r"

Cardiac function, as assessed by left ventricular ejection fraction (EF), was determined by standard radionuclide angiography during rest and exercise. No patients in this study developed congestive heart failure. While both regimens produced net decreases in EF during rest and exercise, the high-dose doxorubicin regimen resulted in significantly greater declines in EF than the low-dose protocol. Of patients with normal baseline values, a greater percentage of patients receiving the high-dose regimen developed an abnormal EF than did those receiving the low-dose regimen, even after separating younger from older individuals. Thus, treatment-induced cardiomyopathy appears to be a significant clinical problem after both high- and low-dose doxorubicin therapy. The use of the low-dose regimen decreases the magnitude of the cardiomyopathic changes.\r"

Multiple therapies were used, but it is impossible to determine if anything other than transurethral resection altered the course in these patients.

  ".W": "In 270 patients with superior oblique paralyses treated between 1973 and 1984, congenital and traumatic causes were most frequent, and one fourth of all traumatic cases had bilateral involvement. Among the diagnostic features distinguishing bilateral from unilateral paralysis were a right hypertropia in left gaze and left hypertropia in right gaze, and a positive Bielschowsky test on tilting the head toward either shoulder. However, absence of either sign did not exclude bilateral paralysis. Large excyclotropia and a V-pattern esotropia are suggestive of but not diagnostic for bilateral paralysis. Complaints about cyclotropia are limited to acquired paralysis. Cyclotropia in the normal eye, head tilt toward the involved side, or absence of any abnormal head posture limits the diagnostic value of these associated signs. Overshoot of the contralateral superior oblique occurred in 19% of the patients and is thought to be caused by contracture of the ipsilateral superior rectus muscle. Surgical treatment in 112 patients resulted in an 85% cure rate with an average of 1.45 operations per patient.\r"

In a series of 202 patients, there was no discrete age of improvement and more than half persisted after age 10 years. The results were similar for both high and normal accommodative convergence/accommodation ratio cases. Initial hyperopia did not predict persistence; subsequent increases prior to age 7 years, and decreases thereafter, were different statistically but were clinically similar. Moreover, the occurrence of inferior oblique overaction and of dissociated vertical deviation, as well as a family history of strabismus, did not predict persistence or delayed improvement.\r"

Fifteen different sets of reasonable assumptions were tested, giving a range of theoretical success rates from 72% to 96%. The results of this study clearly indicate that a certain proportion of failures is to be expected when this or other forms of strabismus are treated surgically by a fully competent ophthalmic surgeon performing as accurately as is practically possible.\r"

Compliance with contact lens wear and occlusion therapy was good in this population. Monocular grating acuities were obtained by preferential looking during months 1 through 15 and by an operant procedure during months 16 through 53. Grating acuities of normal eyes did not differ from those obtained in an age-matched normal population and showed no evidence of occlusion amblyopia. During the first year of life, grating acuities of aphakic eyes were typically within the normal range, but lagged behind normal development during years 2 through 4. These results suggest that early surgery is associated with favorable long-term visual results but does not, even with good compliance, completely eliminate deprivation amblyopia.\r"

Koilocytosis was focally present in 30 tumors (60%). Atypia that ranged from mild to severe was present in ten lesions (20%). In addition, we examined specimens of conjunctival dysplasia or carcinoma from 61 patients. The lesions were predominantly flat proliferations of atypical epithelial cells. Twenty biopsies performed for suspected sarcoidosis were used as controls. Papillomavirus capsid antigen was demonstrated using an immunoperoxidase technique in nuclei of mature superficial epithelial cells of 23 papillomas (46%) and five dysplasias or carcinomas (8.2%) but not in the control biopsy specimens. These results suggest that papillomavirus may play a role in the etiology of conjunctival papilloma, dysplasia, and carcinoma.\r"

Eye findings were scored on paired sets of retinal photographs obtained when enrolled in this study and shortly after delivery. These findings were then correlated with measurements of diabetic regulation. Intensive therapy for the diabetes mellitus resulted in improved glucose control by the time of delivery. However, retinal abnormalities worsened as gestation proceeded in 55% of the pregnancies. Deterioration of background retinopathy correlated significantly with the levels of plasma glucose at entry and with the magnitude of improvement in glycemia achieved during the first six to 14 weeks after entry (ie, \"early changes\") and by the final week before delivery (ie, \"overall changes\"). Our findings indicate that the changing retinopathy during pregnancy cannot be interpreted without assessment of concurrent changes in the regulation of maternal diabetes and that the abrupt institution of improved diabetic control during pregnancy may be one factor in the deterioration of background retinopathy sometimes seen during pregnancy.\r"

The DNA sequences of genital tract human papillomavirus type 6 (HPV-6) were identified in conjunctival papilloma tissue by Southern transfer hybridization of tissue DNA extracted from a lesion excised at 29 months of age as well as by in situ hybridization of paraffin sections of the diagnostic biopsy specimen obtained at 11 months of age.

Wide-field specular microscopy with analysis of endothelial cell density and morphologic evaluation, pachymetry, and intraocular pressure measurements were also used to study the toxicity of the viscous solutions in an in vivo cat model with and without anterior chamber washout. All four solutions provided complete endothelial protection from mechanical trauma. Endothelial cell density and morphologic nature were unaffected during the in vivo toxicity study. A mild increase in intraocular inflammation occurred at one and two days after intraocular injection with all four viscous solutions. Intraocular pressure elevations peaked within four hours after instillation of the viscous solutions and were significantly reduced by anterior chamber washout.\r"

The ablation process was quantitated by measuring mass ablated with an electronic balance, and characterized by examining ablation craters with scanning electron microscopy. The highest ablation rate was observed at 248 nm with lower rates at 193 and 308 nm. No ablation was observed at 351 nm. Scanning electron microscopy revealed the smoothest craters at 193 nm while at 248 nm there was vacuolization in the crater walls and greater disruption of surrounding tissue. The craters made at 308 nm did not have as smooth a contour as the 193-nm lesions. The spectral absorbance of the bovine lens was calculated at the wavelengths used for ablation and correlated with ablation rates and thresholds. High peak-power, pulsed ultraviolet laser radiation may have a role in surgical removal of the lens.\r"

  ".W": "We performed posterior lip sclerectomies in 29 owl monkey eyes to determine the natural history of wound healing after filtering surgery without adjunctive antimetabolite therapy. We noted three phases of wound healing during clinical and histologic examination: early healing (days 2 to 6), intermediate healing (days 7 to 9), and late healing (days 10 to 14). In the early healing phase, all limbal fistulas except one remained open gonioscopically, but by day 6, fibroblasts had proliferated along the walls of the opening. Proliferation and migration of fibroblasts continued during the intermediate healing phase to completely occlude four and to partially occlude two of the ten fistulas in the eyes studied during this time. In the late healing phase, the limbal fistula was completely closed by granulation tissue in four of five eyes and was slitlike open in one eye. In this model of filtering surgery, wound healing at the sclerectomy site with obliteration of the limbal opening by proliferating fibroblasts occurred within the first 14 postoperative days. We believe that the short-term effects of newer treatments designed to alter wound healing after filtering surgery may be assessed in this model, which is characterized by predictable and prompt wound healing.\r"

Our experiments have indicated that the CoBF is elevated even after 60 minutes of noise exposure. This was true particularly in the areas where these frequencies stimulate the cochlea.

It has been associated with a high incidence of complications, often leading to fatal innominate artery rupture. The use of the pectoralis major myocutaneous flap has permitted wide en bloc resections of the superior mediastinum in ten patients without a major complication. Several technical innovations add versatility to the pectoralis major myocutaneous flap, including tailor fitting each skin paddle and incorporating the pectoralis minor into the muscular pedicle. Superior mediastinal resection should be performed in conjunction with laryngectomy and cervical lymph node dissection in patients who are at high risk for parastomal recurrence. We also recommend that patients with parastomal recurrence undergo this procedure for salvage.\r"

Occasionally it is due to reversible changes, such as edema, contusion, or compression of the optic nerve. The early management of visual loss due to orbital fracture is controversial. Some authors advocate emergency optic nerve decompression; others recommend steroid therapy alone. We present a case of nearly complete unilateral loss of vision after a lateral orbital fracture with compression of the optic nerve by bony fragments. Computed tomographic scanning of the orbit helped us to pinpoint the cause of visual compromise and also served as a guide in planning surgery. Large dosages of steroids, combined with early reduction of the fracture, resulted in substantial recovery of vision. This case illustrates the importance of precisely determining the nature of the injury and the cause of visual compromise. A protocol for management of these injuries is presented.\r"

Its success in risk stratification at admission was assessed by a blind review of cross sectional echocardiographic tape recordings from multiple acoustic windows. Sixty nine (20%) of the 345 patients died during hospital stay or within a one year follow up. The mean (SD) wall motion score in those who died was significantly higher than in those who survived (16.2 (5.9) vs 5.7 (3.9)). There were no differences between the group that died in hospital within three months of discharge and the group that died between three months and one year after discharge. Among the 31 patients who died in hospital, however, wall motion score was highest in 15 patients dying of cardiogenic shock (19.2 (4.2)). In 16 patients with lethal ruptures it was 13.5 (6.1). The nine patients with free wall ruptures had higher wall motion scores than those with ventricular septal rupture or papillary muscle rupture (15.7 (6.9) vs 8.5 (5.3)). Eight (3.3%) of 245 patients with a score less than 10 died, compared with 61 (61%) of 100 scoring greater than or equal to 10. The sensitivity of a score of greater than or equal to 10 in predicting death within one year was 88%, the specificity was 86%, the positive predictive value was 61%, and the negative predictive value was 97%.\r"

  ".W": "The pathophysiological role of an increase in circulating vasopressin in sustaining global and regional vasoconstriction in patients with congestive heart failure has not been established, particularly in patients with hyponatraemia. To assess this further, 20 patients with congestive heart failure refractory to digoxin and diuretics were studied before and 60 minutes after the intravenous injection (5 micrograms/kg) of the vascular antagonist of vasopressin [1(beta-mercapto-beta,beta-cyclopentamethylene-propionic acid), 2-(0-methyl) tyrosine] arginine vasopressin. Ten patients were hyponatraemic (plasma sodium less than 135 mmol/l) and 10 were normonatraemic. In both groups of patients the vascular vasopressin antagonist did not alter systemic or pulmonary artery pressures, right atrial pressure, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, cardiac index, or vascular resistances. Furthermore, there was no change in skin and hepatic blood flow in either group after the injection of the vascular antagonist. Only one patient in the hyponatraemic group showed considerable haemodynamic improvement. He had severe congestive heart failure and a high concentration of plasma vasopressin (51 pmol/l). Plasma renin activity, vasopressin, or catecholamine concentrations were not significantly changed in response to the administration of the vasopressin antagonist in either the hyponatraemic or the normonatraemic groups. Patients with hyponatraemia, however, had higher baseline plasma catecholamine concentrations, heart rate, pulmonary pressure and resistance, and lower hepatic blood flow than patients without hyponatraemia. Plasma vasopressin and plasma renin activity were slightly, though not significantly, higher in the hyponatraemic group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The ratio of left ventricular stroke volume to right ventricular stroke volume was calculated from contiguous transverse magnetic resonance images and was used to measure the severity of regurgitation in 18 patients with aortic regurgitation and 10 with mitral regurgitation. Cardiac anatomy was well demonstrated, allowing an assessment of relative chamber volumes and associated abnormalities, although valve abnormality was not well seen. There was a weak correlation between magnetic resonance measurements of left ventricular end diastolic volume and stroke volume ratio. The stroke volume ratio differed significantly in four groups with increasing angiographic severity of regurgitation, and all but the group with trivial regurgitation differed significantly from normal. There was good correlation between magnetic resonance and radionuclide measurements of left ventricular ejection fraction and stroke volume ratio, although the stroke volume ratio was consistently overestimated by radionuclide ventriculography. Correlation was less good for the right ventricular ejection fraction, which was underestimated by radionuclide ventriculography. It is concluded that magnetic resonance imaging provides valuable information in patients with valvar regurgitation, and serves as a suitable standard by which to judge conventional techniques.\r"

Medications were unchanged throughout the study; none was taking beta blockers. At the end of each month patients underwent an exercise test. During each month patients recorded symptoms and their preferred pacing mode. DDD 100 was the preferred mode (seven patients). There was significantly less chest pain with this mode than with either of the other modes. There were significantly more episodes of dizziness in VVI, and two patients who developed pacemaker syndrome were unable to complete the pacing period. Three patients developed angina during exercise testing in DDD 150. Atrial synchronous ventricular pacing is better than ventricular pacing for the control of symptoms in patients with angina pectoris provided that the upper atrial tracking rate is limited.\r"

Average duration of infusion was 80 min (range 48-166 min). This regimen provided satisfactory relaxation in 13 patients; two patients required one additional bolus of atracurium. Fourteen patients showed a sustained tetanic response to 50-Hz stimulation at the end of surgery and in these neuromuscular blockade was not antagonized. One patient required antagonism following very rapid closure of the abdomen.\r"

The early theories of anaesthesia concentrated on a unitary mechanism; however, many recent investigations emphasize specific interactions between anaesthetic agents and excitable membranes. In this study volatile anaesthetics (halothane, isoflurane, enflurane and diethyl ether) applied as vapours in clinical concentrations were observed to produce differential effects on the discharge activity of an isolated crayfish neurone. In addition, both enflurane and diethyl ether induced bursts of discharge activity at concentrations known to produce EEG seizure activity in animals and man. These observations do not support the concept of a common non-specific mechanism of action, but provide further evidence that the action of volatile anaesthetics is selective and may involve multiple sites or mechanisms, or both.\r"

The mechanisms involved in this action of tubocurarine on the plasma histamine concentration in rats, and on the isolated peritoneal mast cells were investigated. I.v. injections of tubocurarine (greater than 5 mg kg-1; corresponds to tubocurarine 4 X 10(-4) mol litre-1 in the plasma of the rats) evoked a phasic increase in plasma histamine concentration. In vitro studies showed that tubocurarine 4 X 10(-4) mol litre-1 released about 20% of the histamine contained in the isolated mast cells. Treatment of the mast cells with carbachol or atropine evoked no histamine release, nor did it modify the tubocurarine-induced release of histamine. These results suggest that the increased histamine concentrations in the plasma are attributable to an action of tubocurarine on the mast cells which is not mediated through the acetylcholine receptors distributed on these cells.\r"

The effects of three agents reported to inhibit phospholipase A2 activity (quinacrine, spermine and indomethacin), tubocurarine and dantrolene were examined on these contractures. Contractures induced by 1% halothane (0.26 +/- 0.02 g) (mean +/- SEM) were increased (0.60 +/- 0.04 g) if suxamethonium 50 mmol litre-1 was also in the bathing medium. Suxamethonium-induced contractures (0.22 +/- 0.03 g) were also enhanced when halothane was present (0.51 +/- 0.03 g). Spermine, indomethacin and dantrolene antagonized both halothane- and suxamethonium-induced contractures. Quinacrine potentiated contractures induced by either halothane or suxamethonium. Contractures induced by suxamethonium were antagonized by tubocurarine; however, contractures induced by halothane were not antagonized by tubocurarine. These results suggest that free fatty acids may be involved in contractures induced synergistically by halothane and suxamethonium. Different mechanisms are involved in the induction of contractures by suxamethonium than by halothane.\r"

In addition, we examined the effects of the same PLA2 inhibitors on contractures induced by halothane in combination with suxamethonium. The studies were conducted on directly stimulated muscle strips isolated from biopsies from patients diagnosed as MH susceptible, or not susceptible, by the halothane contracture test. The liberation of fatty acids from skeletal muscle homogenates was examined to determine whether PLA2 activity might be increased in MH susceptible patients. The three PLA2 inhibitors antagonized halothane-induced contractures of muscle from MH susceptible patients as well as induction of contractures by suxamethonium and halothane. Pre-exposing preparations that were previously unresponsive to halothane to bee venom PLA2 caused the muscle strips to respond with contractures upon subsequent challenge with halothane, but not with suxamethonium. Free fatty acid production during an in vitro incubation of skeletal muscle homogenates was greater in preparations from MH susceptible patients than in those from patients who were not susceptible. These results suggest that excess liberation of fatty acids may be involved in halothane-induced contractures of muscle from MH susceptible individuals, in the synergism observed between halothane and suxamethonium, and in human MH.\r"

Ulcer healing produced no significant changes in platelet count, and patients with non-gravitational ulcers had normal platelet counts. MPV was significantly higher in both gravitational groups than in controls after correction for platelet count, by analysis of co-variance (P = 0.01).

PHF activity was not removed by heat treatment at 100 degrees C for 2 min but was destroyed by heating at 100 degrees C for 5 min. The factor responsible for epidermal cell outgrowth in PHF may be epibolin or serum spreading factor, or may be a platelet-derived factor as yet undescribed. Viability and outgrowth were stimulated by the 'high molecular weight' fraction of PHF (greater than 30 kd). PHF plus 5% FBS gave inhibition of outgrowth, which was not PHF concentration-dependent; however, this inhibitory effect was variable with different PHF preparations. This study is the first to demonstrate an effect of platelet-derived factors on epidermal cell viability and outgrowth.\r"

It is postulated that this sac, of unknown origin, favours replication of the virions by providing a site that is both anatomically and immunologically privileged. Such relatively unimpeded growth of the virions results in an enlarged cell in which the cytoplasm and nucleus are compressed into a thin outer shell. In the aggregate, this produces a tumour of virus-packed cells rather than a tumour composed of virus-induced cell hyperplasia.\r"

Histological control of the adequacy of excision was monitored using routine vertical sections of formalin-fixed tissue. Further re-excisions were performed in 17 patients in whom tumour extended up to or within 1 high power field (approximately 0.44 mm) of the excision margin. The formalin-fixed specimens ranged from 6-60 (mean 21) mm in diameter and 2-12 (mean 5) mm in depth. After one excision the time to complete re-epithelialization was directly proportional to the surface area (r = 0.73) and ranged from 13 to 60 days (mean 33 days). Measurements of the movements of fixed reference points tattooed at the wound edges in six patients showed that movement of surrounding tissue into the defect accounted for 39-62% (mean 45%) of the reduction in surface area of the defect during healing. Post-operative complications were rare and the cosmetic results were considered good or excellent in 48 patients, fair in nine and poor, i.e. requiring corrective surgery, in three patients. Poor results were due to distortions of free margins, e.g. lower eyelid and nasal margin. The major benefit of this technique is the ease with which further excisions can be performed when histologically indicated.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We have measured plasma unbound and total phenytoin, and saliva concentrations at intervals in 11 pregnant epileptics. Plasma albumin concentrations were also measured in pregnant and non-pregnant women. Saliva phenytoin correlated closely with the plasma unbound concentrations (r = 0.98). The saliva:plasma (S:P) ratio, reflecting the free fraction, was variable during pregnancy but tended to increase to maximal values at delivery and return to non-pregnant values within 2-8 weeks thereafter. Plasma albumin concentrations correlated poorly with phenytoin binding. Binding in umbilical cord plasma appeared higher than that in maternal plasma and total fetal concentrations correlated closely with maternal plasma concentrations at delivery. No ill effects of phenytoin were detected in the newborn infant. During the third trimester phenytoin dose increments were necessary to maintain therapeutic concentrations. After delivery maternal saliva phenytoin concentrations rose, and dose reductions were necessary to avoid clinical symptoms of toxicity. It is therefore appropriate to monitor saliva phenytoin concentrations regularly both during pregnancy and the puerperium.\r"

Overall, 66% of the immunized mothers were rhesus (D) positive. Apart from four antibody specificities to rhesus system antigens, knowledge of the rhesus (D) group gave no guide to the ability of the patients to form any of the remaining 21 specificities encountered. Of the 726 antibodies 221 (30%) were not detected in the initial sample tested and 50 of the 92 patients who produced antibodies during pregnancy had not developed detectable antibody when they were sampled at 28 weeks. The significance of these late onset antibodies is discussed both in relation to the risk of haemolytic disease in the newborn and transfusion reactions in the mother. An optimum protocol for testing is defined which takes account of antibody production during the pregnancy and use of this protocol constitutes an attempt to combine maximum clinical safety with minimal consumption of resources.\r"

In pre-eclampsia and in a proportion of pregnancies with small-for-gestational age infants (SGA) the physiological changes are restricted to the decidual segments alone. In addition, complete absence of physiological changes throughout the entire length of some spiral arteries is seen in pre-eclampsia and SGA. This new observation is confirmed in a study of basal plates of placentas from abnormal pregnancies. Intraluminal endovascular trophoblast may be seen in the placental bed spiral arteries in the third trimester in pre-eclampsia and SGA, a feature not seen beyond the second trimester in normal pregnancy. These findings point to a defect in the normal interaction between migratory trophoblast and maternal uterine tissues in pre-eclampsia and in SGA.\r"

Fetal distress was assessed by electronic fetal heart rate (FHR) monitoring and fetal scalp blood pH determinations in late first stage of labour. Ominous FHR and/or low pH (less than 7.26) was more common in the diabetic group than in the control group (17.4% and 10.9%, respectively) but the difference was not statistically significant. The frequency of caesarean section and low Apgar score at 1 min was significantly higher in the diabetic group (P less than 0.05). There was no correlation between maternal blood glucose regulation and the occurrence of fetal distress in the diabetic group. The results suggest that fetal distress may be slightly more common in labour in diabetic women compared with controls managed in a similar way. Careful FHR monitoring and liberal use of fetal scalp blood pH determinations is recommended.\r"

Although the majority of patients with serious retinopathy were already under ophthalmic supervision, 39 cases (52 eyes) were found which required treatment. Eighty eyes had had previous photocoagulation, and treatment was recommended for maculopathy in 40 eyes, proliferative retinopathy in seven eyes, and combined maculopathy and proliferative retinopathy in five eyes. This suggested that existing referral criteria for photocoagulation in the population studied were reasonably accurate for proliferative retinopathy, but maculopathy was more frequently overlooked. In insulin dependent patients (IDDs) undetected maculopathy was found in 17/416 eyes, (4.0%) and in non-insulin dependent patients (NIDDs) 28/899 (3.1%). Untreated proliferative retinopathy was discovered in 5/416 (1.2%) IDD eyes and 7/899 (0.8%) of NIDD eyes. Vitreoretinal surgery was required in six eyes (0.5%) for vitreous haemorrhage or traction retinal detachment. Equipment for the treatment of diabetic retinopathy is now almost universally available in ophthalmic departments, but time for patient management by trained staff may be inadequate. Each UK ophthalmic consultant needs approximately 100 sessions per year to monitor and treat known cases of retinopathy apart from time required to train junior staff.\r"

A range of morphological changes were observed by phase contrast microscopy, and these became more atypical with increasing concentration.

All second treatments were performed at least four to six weeks after the initial session. Evaluation of the postoperative course of IOP by means of the Kaplan-Meier curve for data analysis indicated that EF patients 'failed' at a faster rate than POAG patients after both the initial and consecutive laser treatments. The rate of failure in the EF group, however, was greater following the initial 180 degrees treatment. Although patients with EF glaucoma have a large initial reduction in intraocular pressure after LTP, to increase the probability of maintaining intraocular pressures of less than or equal to 22 mmHg consecutive 180 degrees treatments should be considered.\r"

In cases 216 (69.9%) this treatment was successful for a mean follow-up period of 6.7 years after irradiation. In 53 cases (17.2%) the eye had to be enucleated, and 40 patients (12.9%) died from metastases within this period. Of the 216 successfully treated patients 114 (52.8%) developed flat scars and 49 (22.7%) retained a visual acuity of 1.5-0.5. Radiogenic late complications with damage to the retinal capillary system were the main causes of visual deterioration, especially in eyes with tumours close to the posterior pole. The survival rate is substantially higher than that for patients whose eyes were primarily enucleated. beta Ray applicators with 106Ru/106Rh can be recommended as an effective tool and a simple and cheap procedure to cure patients with small and medium sized choroidal melanomas. They save the eye without endangering our patients' lives.\r"

Although the ocular manifestations appeared similar to those described for the 1970 and 1975 outbreaks, a markedly higher rate of respiratory involvements was noted. Not observed in previous epidemics were herpes-like vesicles in the conjunctiva and eyelids of one patient and vesicles in the buccal mucosa and lips of another from whom Coxsackie virus A24 was isolated. The most interesting finding in this study was the isolation of five wild (non-Sabin) poliovirus type 1 strains. Three strains were obtained from conjunctival and two from throat swabs of patients with mild to severe conjunctivitis. It is conceivable that the rare reports of polio-like paralysis or radiculomyelitis accompanying or following AHC in a few Asian countries could be attributed to concurrent infections with a poliovirus and either enterovirus type 70 or Coxsackie virus type A24.\r"

Long-term HU therapy should be considered for severely affected adults with sickle cell anemia who are willing to accept what is probably a small risk of carcinogenesis. Preliminary chromosomal analysis and knowledge of the clastogenic properties of HU suggest that conception and pregnancy should be avoided. Pharmacokinetic studies will probably be necessary to adjust individual dosage schedules so that cytotoxicity is avoided. F cell responses can be seen in 2 to 3 weeks if the HU dose is optimal, but establishment of a large number of F cells in the circulation may take a month or longer.\r"

  ".W": "Patients with Hb SC disease were found to have microcytic and hyperchromic red cell indices despite mild reticulocytosis. Iron deficiency anemia was ruled out by the finding of normal serum ferritin levels. In order to determine whether the microcytosis was due to coexistent alpha-thalassemia, restriction endonuclease mapping was performed on genomic DNA extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes. Patients with Hb SC disease had microcytic indices despite the presence of a full complement of four alpha-genes (alpha alpha/alpha alpha), suggesting that the microcytosis may be due to cellular dehydration (or xerocytosis), since the mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration in Hb SC disease patients was significantly higher than in controls. This possibility was investigated further by the determination of RBC cation content. RBC Na levels were similar in SC and normal red cells. Hb SC RBCs, however, had significantly reduced K levels. These findings show that RBC cation content, and thus cell water, is decreased in Hb SC disease. The decreased RBC K level in the presence of normal cellular Na concentration suggests selective K loss that is not due to inhibition of the Na K pump. Ouabain-insensitive K+ efflux was increased to four times normal in SC cells. Cell dehydration was confirmed by the demonstration of increased high-density RBCs on discontinuous Stractan density gradients and by osmotic gradient ektacytometry. Cellular dehydration and its sequelae were worse in CC erythrocytes and milder in AC cells than in Hb SC red cells. Taken together, these data indicate that in Hb SC disease the RBCs are severely dehydrated and typically microcytic and hyperchromic. Hb SC RBCs seem to be dehydrated due to selective K loss. These findings suggest a functional interrelationship between Hb SC, the red cell membrane, and cation regulation.\r"

In various marrow-fetal liver combinations of stroma and recharge, the maintenance of erythroid (BFU-e) and myeloid (CFU-GM) precursors in the nonadherent phase was determined. The morphology of the fetal liver nucleated cells during culture was also examined. This study shows that fetal liver stromas efficiently support fetal BFU-e for 6 to 7 weeks in vitro. Bone marrow stromas were not able to maintain fetal BFU-e beyond 4 weeks. Significant numbers of marrow BFU-e were not sustained in vitro on either source of stroma. On the other hand, the stroma layers of fetal liver and marrow origin were equally effective in maintaining fetal CFU-GM and adult CFU-GM in long-term culture. These findings show that the human embryonic liver stroma is a preferential site for stimulating fetal erythropoiesis. They do not demonstrate differences in stroma function to explain the relative paucity of myelopoiesis in the fetal liver.\r"

Because gallium is known to bind avidly to transferrin, we examined the effect of transferrin-gallium (Tf-Ga) on hemoglobin production by Friend erythroleukemia cells in vitro. Cellular hemoglobin production, as assessed by benzidine staining, cellular hemoglobin content, and 59Fe incorporation into heme, was significantly decreased following exposure of cells to Tf-Ga. Tf-Ga led to an early decrease in cellular 59Fe incorporation even before changes in hemoglobin production were detected. A marked increase in cellular transferrin receptor expression occurred following exposure of cells to Tf-Ga. Tf-Ga inhibition of hemoglobin production could be reversed and hemoglobin production could be restored to normal by addition to the media of either transferrin-iron (Tf-Fe) or iron-pyridoxal isonicotinoyl hydrazone, a compound capable of supplying iron directly to reticulocytes for heme synthesis without transferrin as a mediator. These studies provide an explanation for the development of anemia in patients treated with gallium nitrate and suggest that gallium's mechanism of chemotherapeutic action includes inhibition of cellular iron incorporation.\r"

The two affected children had an abnormal chromosomal complement as a result of a deletion of the short arm of chromosome 8 [(46,XX,del(8)(p11.1p21.1)].

  ".U": "87076949\r", 
  ".W": "The capacity of platelets to generate thromboxane A2, reflected by measurement of serum thromboxane B2 (TxB2), greatly exceeds the systemic production of thromboxane in vivo. Thus, it is possible that substantial but incomplete inhibition of thromboxane formation ex vivo would still allow marked augmentation of thromboxane production in vivo. To address this hypothesis, we administered aspirin 120 mg, a selective inhibitor of thromboxane synthase (TxSl), 3-(1H-imidazol-1-yl-methyl)-2-methyl-1H-indole-1-propanoic acid (UK-38, 485) 200 mg, and a combination of both drugs to 12 healthy volunteers and measured the effects on serum TxB2 and urinary 2,3-dinor-thromboxane B2 (Tx-M), an index of endogenous thromboxane biosynthesis. Although serum TxB2 was maximally inhibited by 94 +/- 1% after aspirin and 96 +/- 2% after the TxSl, maximal depression of Tx-M was only 28 +/- 8% and 37 +/- 9%, respectively. Combination of aspirin with the TxSl resulted in a small but significant increase in inhibition of thromboxane generation ex vivo (98 +/- 1% v 94 +/- 1%; P less than 0.05), but a disproportionately greater fall in thromboxane synthesis in vivo (58 +/- 7%; P less than 0.01). Consistent with further inhibition of platelet thromboxane synthesis, addition of the TxSl abolished the transient decline in prostacyclin formation after aspirin alone. Administration of a lower dose of aspirin (20 mg) to 6 healthy subjects caused a small reduction in Tx-M (12 +/- 4%; P less than 0.05) and inhibited serum TxB2 by 48 +/- 2%. The relationship between inhibition of platelet capacity to form thromboxane ex vivo (serum TxB2) and synthesis in vivo (Tx-M) departed markedly from the line of identity. When total blockade of the capacity of platelets to generate thromboxane is approached, minor decrements in capacity result in a disproportionate depression of actual thromboxane biosynthesis. These results imply that pharmacologic inhibition of serum TxB2 must be virtually complete before thromboxane-dependent platelet activation is influenced in vivo.\r"

A study of the reaction of SC-UK with plasminogen is complicated by the effect of the reaction product, plasmin, on both reactants. The resultant generation of TC-UK and Lys-plasminogen produces secondary reactions which greatly augment plasminogen activation. To confine enzymatic activity to the primary reaction, after pretreatment to eliminate trace TC-UK contaminants, SC-UK was incubated with Glu- or Lys-plasminogen in the presence of aprotinin (500 KIU/mL) to inhibit generated plasmin and dansyl-glutamyl-glycyl-arginyl-chloromethylketone (20 mumol/L), which irreversibly inhibited TC-UK but not SC-UK. Analysis by reducing sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) showed a plasminogen-activating activity for SC-UK that was approximately 0.4% that of TC-UK. Both SC-UK and TC-UK preferentially activated Lys-plasminogen over Glu-plasminogen. Similarly, Glu-plasminogen activation was augmented by lysine or soluble fibrin. The ratio of the reaction rates of SC-UK and TC-UK were comparable for Glu- and Lys-plasminogen. It is concluded that there is a major difference in the catalytic activities of SC-UK and TC-UK against plasminogen that is comparable to that against synthetic substrate.\r"

  ".W": "Flow cytometry was used to identify maturational differences of erythroid lineage cells in normal human bone marrow by combining physical characteristics, the expression of multiple cell surface antigens, and nucleic acid content. Normal low-density bone marrow cells could be divided into four populations, based on forward and right-angle light scattering. Erythroid cells, at different maturational stages, were found in three of these four marrow subpopulations. The sequentially correlated expression of three cell surface markers--HLe-1, transferrin receptor, and glycophorin--allowed us to study erythroid maturation from the colony forming cell to the mature erythrocyte. HLe-1 was expressed on the earliest identifiable erythroid cells and was progressively lost as the cells matured. Transferrin receptor began to be expressed at the BFU-E stage and disappeared at the late reticulocyte stage. Transferrin receptor expression preceded glycophorin expression, the latter beginning on morphologically recognizable erythroid precursors just after the CFU-E stage. In contrast to both HLe-1 and transferrin receptor, which were progressively lost during the maturational process, once glycophorin had been maximally expressed on the cell surface, it remained at constant quantities to the mature erythrocyte stage. Although developing nucleated erythroid cells at approximately the normoblast stage had light-scattering properties similar to those of lymphoid cells, these two cell types could be resolved by cell surface antigen expression. Normoblasts were glycophorin positive and HLe negative, whereas lymphoid cells expressed HLe and either Leu 4, Leu 11, or Leu 12. Decreases in cellular nucleic acid content, corresponding first to the extrusion of the nucleus and second to the loss of reticulum, characterized the later stages of erythroid development. These characteristics and instrumentation can be used to purify erythroid cells at various developmental stages.\r"

Fifty-five patients with nonimmune thrombocytopenia had 338 +/- 37 molecules of IgG/platelet, whereas 67 patients with immune thrombocytopenia studied at the time of their initial evaluation had 4,120 +/- 494 molecules of IgG/platelet. An analysis of the distribution of values in these two groups indicated that 90% of the patients with immune thrombocytopenia had greater than 800 molecules of IgG/platelet, whereas only 7% of patients with nonimmune thrombocytopenia exceeded this amount. The immune thrombocytopenia patients included 39 idiopathic, 14 secondary, and 14 drug-induced disorders, and they did not significantly differ in their distribution of values for platelet IgG. The nonimmune thrombocytopenic patients included 12 cases with a platelet destructive mechanism; their platelet-bound IgG was similar to that of the other nonimmune patients. Twenty-seven patients with treatment resistant immune thrombocytopenia were also studied they had 2,100 +/- 670 molecules of IgG/platelet. Their values were significantly greater than those of the nonimmune thrombocytopenic patients and not significantly different from those of immune thrombocytopenic group. Their distribution of values was much broader, however, with 33% of patients having less than 800 molecules of IgG/platelet, suggesting possible alternate mechanisms in their thrombocytopenia. Thus, patients with immune thrombocytopenia have a high frequency of elevated IgG on the platelet surface which reflects the pathophysiology of this disorder. Quantitation of platelet-bound IgG provides a useful laboratory tool in the differential between immune and nonimmune thrombocytopenia.\r"

  ".W": "The ability of small acetylcholinesterase-positive (SACHE) cells to incorporate tritiated thymidine (3H-TdR) was studied in the bone marrow of mice made acutely thrombocytopenic by injection of guinea pig antimouse platelet serum (APS) and in control mice injected with normal guinea pig serum (NS). 3H-TdR was administered in vivo, and bone marrow was collected at various time points thereafter. The initial labeling index (LI) for both groups was about 30%. After four hours, the LI increased and reached peak values at 48 hours, but was lower in thrombocytopenic animals. The lower peak LI in APS-treated animals may be the result of both a faster rate of influx of unlabeled cells into the acetylcholinesterase (AChE) positive cell compartment and efflux of more heavily labeled, and probably polyploid, SACHE cells into the compartment of recognizable megakaryocytes. In both groups the increasing LI occurred concomitantly with a decreasing mean grain count. This may indicate cellular division by some fraction of SACHE cells. Heterogeneity in nuclear morphology was also demonstrated, and the frequency of individual morphologies was altered in APS-treated animals. In addition, cells that incorporated 3H-TdR were larger than those that did not. This group of small cells appears to represent a pivotal point in megakaryocytopoiesis in which the switch from mitosis to endomitosis is occurring.\r"

  ".W": "In an effort to study the rheologic effects of small amounts of hemoglobin S (HbS) polymer in sickle red cells, we have used the ektacytometer, a laser diffraction couette viscometer, to measure sickle cell deformability as a function of oxygen tension. Sickle cell populations of defined intracellular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) were isolated using Stractan density gradients and were resuspended in buffered polyvinylpyrrolidone solutions for deformability measurements. Using a gas-porous, hollow fiber gas exchange system to establish a linear gradient in oxygen tension, deformability was measured over a pO2 range of 76 to 0 mm Hg. Parallel spectroscopic determinations of oxygen saturation permitted determination of cell deformability as a function of oxygen saturation for each discrete MCHC population. From these measurements the level of oxygen saturation at which a loss in cell deformability was first detected could be defined. Then, using the data of Noguchi and Schecter, the amount of polymerized HbS in the cells at that defined level of oxygen saturation was estimated. The results of this analysis suggested that the quantity of polymer that caused a detectable loss in cell deformability increased with increasing MCHC. In addition, for MCHC above 30 g/dL, this represented a substantial fraction of the total HbS in the cell.\r"

  ".W": "Fetal hemoglobin (HbF) levels vary widely among individuals with sickle cell anemia (SS). Previous studies have suggested that HbF levels in SS individuals with alpha-thalassemia (two or three functional alpha-globin genes) are lower than HbF levels in SS individuals with four normal alpha-globin genes. Using immunocytochemical techniques, we studied F cell production as measured by % F reticulocytes, the amount of HbF per F cell, and the preferential survival of F cells versus non-F cells in 51 subjects with four alpha genes, 32 subjects with three alpha genes, and 18 subjects with two alpha genes. Comparison between alpha-globin gene groups was performed for the total sample as well as for a subset of 82 individuals who had replicate samples and a further subset of 39 age-matched individuals. %HbF levels were 6.8, 4.9, and 4.5 percent for the total four-, three-, and two-alpha-globin-gene groups, respectively. The percentage of F reticulocytes, percentage HbF per F cell, and the enrichment ratio (% F cell/% F reticulocytes) did not change significantly with alpha-globin gene number. Moreover, no correlation existed between alpha-globin gene number and the absolute number of F cells in any group studied. However, there was a strong inverse correlation (r = -0.407, P = .0001) between non-F cell levels (1.7 +/- 2, 2.2 +/- 5, 3.0 +/- 1.0 X 10(12)/L) and decreasing alpha-globin gene number. These data suggest that falling HbF levels among SS individuals with lessened numbers of alpha-globin genes reflect prolonged survival of non-F cells and are not due to intrinsic differences in F cell production or in the amount of HbF per F cell. The improved survival of non-F cells in SS alpha-thalassemia is presumed to be due to the lower MCHC observed in such individuals.\r"

We have developed a monoclonal antibody (L21) that strongly agglutinates all erythrocytes except In(Lu), and we have identified eight In(Lu) individuals among 42,000 blood donors tested. Studies of two families confirmed the dominant mode of inheritance and revealed several new features of this phenotype. The erythrocytes of all five affected individuals from the two families exhibited diminished hemagglutination by the lectin concanavalin A, although they reacted normally with several other lectins. The erythrocytes of two affected individuals in one family exhibited marked acanthocytosis. The erythrocytes of the proposita of the other family exhibited a mild degree of poikilocytosis, but the cells of the other two affected individuals in this family had normal morphology. The osmotic fragility of fresh In(Lu) erythrocytes was normal, but after incubation for 24 hours at 37 degrees C in plasma the In(Lu) cells exhibited a marked increase in resistance to osmotic lysis. During the incubation period the erythrocytes lost K+ and their total cation content was diminished. These data indicate that in addition to the suppression of blood group antigens noted previously, the In(Lu) phenotype includes a variety of morphological abnormalities and a defect in electrolyte metabolism. The use of L21 and similar monoclonal antibodies provides a more sensitive means of detecting In(Lu) erythrocytes than typing with human anti-Lub antisera.\r"

Tumoricidal dose curves were defined using malignant lymphoid (SK-DHL2 and Reh) and myeloid (HL-60) cells admixed with a 20-fold excess of irradiated marrow cells to simulate a borderline remission marrow. One-hour treatments yielded ID50 of less than 5 mumol/L of VP-16 for clonogenic units from each cell line; rare-to-zero clonogenic units survived exposure to 50 to 100 mumol/L. CFU-Mix, BFU-E, and CFU-GM were equal in their sensitivity to VP-16 (ID50s25 to 30 mumol/L). Marrows treated with 75 mumol/L were completely depleted of these colony-forming cells but produced CFU-GM in one-stage long-term marrow cultures (LTMCs). This dose had little adverse effect on the proliferative capacity of marrow stromal progenitors, as measured by CFU-F (ID50 271 mumol/L) and by the unperturbed development of adherent layers in LTMCs. Furthermore, these stromal layers were able to support hematopoiesis as well as controls in co-culture experiments with autologous marrow cells (two-stage LTMCs). In conclusion, doses of VP-16 that cleanse marrow of lymphoma-leukemia cells spare hematopoietic and stromal progenitors as demonstrated by LTMCs. These data favor the use of VP-16 in the clinical autotransplant setting.\r"

No comprehensive analysis of available data has so far been attempted in the literature either. Here we present an analysis of chromosome changes and their correlation with subtypes of lymphoma studied by conventional histology and cell surface markers, as observed in two sets of data: a group of 65 karyotypically abnormal tumors sequentially ascertained and studied by us during the period January 1, 1984 to April 30, 1985, and a larger data set derived by combining our data with those from two published series from the University of Minnesota that are comparable to our data. These combined data, which comprise the largest data set on the cytogenetics of lymphomas assembled so far, enabled a comprehensive analysis of correlation between chromosome change and tumor histology and the patterns of chromosome instability in these tumors. We found several significant associations, some previously described and others now recognized, between nonrandom chromosome gains, breaks, translocations, and deletions and histologic subtypes of tumors that characterize lymphomas. The data indicate that finding of chromosome breaks at certain sites (eg, 8q24, 14q32, 18q21) is of diagnostic value in dealing with cases of unusual lymphoma. Furthermore, nonrandom chromosome breakage exhibited three distinct patterns that reflected three levels of etiologically relevant genetic change.\r"

Infants with TOF (and possibly those with IAA) who did not have DGS and who did not die during infancy showed a normal incidence of visible HOC in radiographs taken during the first post-natal month. Radiological visibility of the HOC in the first post-natal month appears useful in the diagnosis of DGS and forms of CHD often seen in association with DGS and in assessing prognosis of neonates with certain types of CHD.\r"

A system of externally controlled intravenous anaesthesia has been developed for the single-subject hyperbaric cylinder. Pharmacological vasodilatation is induced in the anaesthetised patient who is then fluid loaded and cooled. Initial single-sensitising treatments are advocated. Twenty-nine patients with advanced mouth cancer have completed a course of this treatment, of whom five of nine were free of disease after 2 years and 10 of 21 at 1 year, with three intercurrent deaths. Fifteen have experienced local failure. This approach would appear to be practical, safe and promising.\r"

In this paper it is shown that a wide range of problems arising in fractionated radiotherapy are capable of being analysed with the aid of one basic graph. It is further demonstrated that the extrapolated response dose, which forms the conceptual fulcrum of the LQ method is an additive quantity, and that the analysis of treatments involving several component parts can be simplified by using this property. The main features of these simplifications are demonstrated using some representative worked examples.\r"

  ".W": "A survey of the practice of carotid surgery by 245 vascular and neurological surgeons in Great Britain and Ireland was conducted with a 96 per cent response. Ninety-six surgeons (41 per cent) performed at least one carotid endarterectomy in 1984 and a total of 1374 such operations were carried out in that year. The indications for carotid endarterectomy in order of frequency were transient ischaemic attack, minor stroke and stroke. Operation was hardly ever undertaken for asymptomatic carotid bruit. Eighty-six per cent of surgeons who performed carotid endarterectomy generally assessed patients in the first instance using techniques less invasive than conventional angiography, principally Doppler ultrasonography or digital subtraction angiography. Nevertheless, conventional angiograms were usually performed before surgery by 89 per cent of surgeons. Almost all surgeons operated only under general anaesthesia, while opinion on the use of an intraluminal shunt during carotid endarterectomy was divided. Despite an increase in the number of carotid endarterectomies in recent years, this operation is currently performed nineteen times less frequently in Great Britain and Ireland than in the USA. The reasons for this are explored and certain controversies surrounding carotid endarterectomy are discussed.\r"

Clinical status, isotope phlebography, venous occlusion plethysmography and foot volumetry were performed after a mean follow-up time of 38 months (range 13-75). The primary operation was successful in 17 of the 19 patients; the 2 remaining had chronic occlusions of their iliac veins. At the time of closure of the arteriovenous fistula, i.e. 3 months after thrombectomy, 14 patients had a patent iliac vein. At follow-up eight patients were considered to have a patent iliac vein, eight had a partial restitution and three had an occluded iliac vein. The group as a whole had no impaired venous emptying of the leg, but the small group of patients with occlusion at follow-up according to isotope phlebography seemed to have an impaired venous emptying. Foot volumetry showed only minor signs of valvular insufficiency, mainly in limbs with distal extension of the initial thrombus or only partial restitution of venous patency. A good long-term result can be expected after venous thrombectomy with a temporary arteriovenous fistula particularly in younger patients where the thrombosis is limited to the iliofemoral segment. This emphasizes the importance of early operation before distal extension of the thrombus occurs.\r"

In four patients there was a simple fistula between the anastomosis and the adherent duodenum, three patients had clinically infected grafts and one had a false aneurysm that had ruptured into the bowel. The four patients with a simple fistula had direct suture repair of the defect. One developed a recurrent fistula at 2 months and was successfully repaired again by direct suture. All four patients remain well at a follow-up of 1-5 years. The other four patients had the grafts excised, with local regrafting in two cases, both patients remaining well at follow-up. One patient had an axillo-bifemoral graft, but died at 30 days of overwhelming sepsis. The final patient, a girl with diffuse aneurysmal disease, had the aortic stump oversewn but no reconstruction. She died at 9 months of aortic stump disruption. These results suggest that a more conservative approach to the operative correction of secondary fistulae should be used wherever possible.\r"

The arterial pressure was measured by direct puncture of the vessel with a No. 23 gauge needle connected, via a cannula, to a pressure transducer. The pressure was measured proximal and distal to anastomoses or endarterectomies, and note was made both of the absolute pressure and waveform. At 3 months 95 per cent were patent. In nine patients (5 per cent), there was a significant fall of pressure across the reconstructed artery and in eight of these procedures were carried out to correct the fault. The technique of direct arterial pressure measurement is quick and easy to perform, with equipment that is used routinely for monitoring by the anaesthetist. There has been no evidence of damage due to the arterial puncture itself. It provides a simple, objective assessment of adequacy of an arterial reconstruction and may lead to the early correction of otherwise unrecognized faults, and thus prevent early graft occlusion.\r"

Values breathing air, 100 per cent oxygen and the rate of change of PtcO2 breathing oxygen were recorded. Of 29 below knee amputations there were 4 failures; 16 had PtcO2 values less than 35 mmHg, but 12 of the 16 healed. When the rate of change of PtcO2 during oxygen inhalation was greater than 9 mm Hg/min all below knee amputations healed; all 4 failures were found to have values less than 9 mm Hg/min while only one patient with a value of less than 9 mm Hg/min healed a below knee amputation. This study shows that low PtcO2 values are a poor indication of healing potential. A more reliable index of skin viability is provided by the dynamic measurement of PtcO2 changes during oxygen inhalation. The addition of an oxygen inhalation test, when making PtcO2 measurements, greatly enhances the applicability of the technique in the assessment of the oxygen supply to the skin.\r"

Of the 76 patients in the operatively treated group 68 were operated on in the operating theatre with a mortality of 17 per cent, while the remaining eight had a thoracotomy in the resuscitation room with a mortality of 87.5 per cent. Indications for early operation would appear to be the presence of signs of cardiac or major vascular injury (i.e. tamponade, profuse bleeding, an absent or diminished peripheral pulse, and shock not responding to aggressive resuscitation). A cautious digital exploration of the chest wound may help identify these injuries by obtaining information about the knife tract (towards or away from the heart or major vessels). The presence of shock on admission should not be an absolute indication for operation. Half the 156 patients with shock on admission were treated conservatively with no mortality. The presence of a wound over the precordium is not in itself an absolute indication for surgery. Seventy-two such patients, including 14 with shock, were successfully treated non-operatively. Massive air leaks are usually self-controlled and none of the 24 such cases required operation. The amount or rate of blood loss via the thoracotomy tube is not a reliable index of the severity of the injury and it should not be a sole criterion for the selection of the type of treatment.\r"

Analysis of data collected previously by the Royal College of Radiologists in nine accident and emergency units in the UK shows that admitting practice varied between centres and was very different from that recommended subsequently in the guidelines. Only 49 per cent (range 22 to 71 per cent) of patients who had skull X-rays and possessed symptoms and signs warranting admission were admitted to hospital and 14 per cent (range 1 to 20 per cent) of those without appropriate symptoms and signs were admitted. Rates of admission for patients with a history of unconsciousness, which according to the guidelines is not a criterion for admission, were up to ten-fold higher than for comparable patients with no such history. Implementation of the guidelines could have a substantial effect on clinical practice and could reduce admissions of patients who had skull X-rays by up to 46 per cent.\r"

The details of technique of lengthening and refashioning of the residual phallic stump after partial amputation in a further 20 patients is described using a technique which leaves a satisfactory penile stump in patients who would normally be candidates for a total amputation. In a third group of patients requiring a total amputation of penis, reconstruction was done in two stages using scrotal flaps in four with satisfactory results. The reconstructed phallus was adequate as a urinary conduit but was unsuitable for sexual function. A one stage procedure involving covering of the urethra with scrotal flaps appears an attractive alternative to the staged procedure. Conventional multistage reconstructions are not recommended.\r"

The postoperative mortality rate was 1.2 per cent. Local recurrence in RND scars was particularly common in the neck (33 per cent). RND for melanoma is a safe procedure, with significant short term but relatively little long term morbidity. Both recurrence and morbidity should be borne in mind when considering patients for prophylactic RND. Surgeons should be prepared to use axial or myocutaneous flaps where extensive skin resection is necessary. A controlled trial of prophylactic antibiotics would be useful to try to reduce the incidence of wound infection.\r"

Anaerobic and aerobic overgrowth occurred in the jejunum of patients with a poor result, but not in those with a good result or with pouch ileitis. In contrast, ileal pouch bacterial overgrowth occurred in all patients regardless of the clinical result. Patients with jejunal overgrowth had increased 24 h stool volume and stool nitrogen, but other patients did not. The larger the stool volume, the greater the anaerobic overgrowth. Pouch biopsies showed chronic inflammation in all patients, while 45 per cent had colonic metaplasia. Neither the inflammation nor the metaplasia correlated with the clinical result, nor did the clinical result correlate with the efficiency of pouch emptying. In conclusion, jejunal bacterial overgrowth after ileal pouch-anal anastomosis was associated with an increased stool output, azotorrhoea, and a poor clinical result. A distinguishing bacterial, absorptive, morphological, or emptying abnormality was not found in patients with a history of recurrent pouch ileitis.\r"

  ".W": "In 28 patients with chronic anal fissure the median anal canal pressure was 98 cmH2O, significantly higher than in control subjects (P less than 0.001). After lateral internal sphincterotomy the pressure dropped by 50 per cent to normal levels and the fissures healed with no change in pressure over 12 months. Ten patients also had normal anal pressures and were asymptomatic 4-6 years after internal sphincterotomy. Adequate internal sphincterotomy appears to reduce permanently anal canal pressure, suggesting that abnormal activity in the sphincter contributes to the development of a fissure.\r"

The commonly employed test of insulin-induced hypoglycaemia (Hollander) is tedious, risky and associated with practical limitations and theoretical objections, which have resulted in its being replaced by the modified sham feed technique in some centres. The postprandial alkaline tide is attributed to HCO3- release consequent to H+ secretion. Any procedure which reduces acid secretion is expected to affect the postprandial urinary pH. This study was performed to evaluate the effect of vagotomy on the postprandial alkaline tide by measuring prevagotomy and postvagotomy fasting and postprandial urinary pH. The results show that postprandial urinary pH falls after vagotomy and this method may be used to assess the completeness of vagotomy. The proposed test is convenient and may be used as a screening method in the assessment of vagotomy and other acid reducing operative procedures, if further validated, by comparison with already established tests.\r"

To elucidate this, anal and rectal pressures were measured simultaneously together with external anal sphincter and puborectalis electromyogram and synchronously superimposed on an image intensifier displaying the rectum outlined by barium. We studied 13 subjects at rest, and during a Valsalva manoeuvre. There was a significant rise in rectal and sphincter pressures (P less than 0.005) and external sphincter and puborectalis EMG (P less than 0.005). In a further 13 patients Valsalva manoeuvres were performed during proctography alone. In all subjects the anterior rectal wall was always clearly separated from the upper sphincter despite a maximal effort and a rectum filled with sufficient liquid to produce a desire to defaecate. These findings question the flap-valve theory of continence and suggest the puborectalis functions by sphincteric occlusion of the anal canal.\r"

The cytokinetic effects of intraluminal calcium were tested in normal and adapting colonic epithelium. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 60) weighting 356.7 +/- 24.9 g were submitted to either an 80 per cent jejuno-ileal resection or simple transection and resuture of the jejunum. Within each group, half the animals had 24 g/l calcium lactate added to the drinking water. Seven weeks postoperatively crypt cell production rate (CCPR) was determined in the lower descending colon. Among controls with transection CCPR was 4.49 cells crypt-1 h-1; calcium supplements reduced this figure by 26 per cent (P less than 0.05). As expected jejuno-ileal resection increased CCPR (by 51-61 per cent), but again calcium reduced this response by 31 per cent (P less than 0.02). Increased dietary levels of calcium thus inhibit colonic cell turnover and blunt the adaptive response to massive enterectomy, conceivably by binding tropic factors such as bile acids.\r"

Symptoms included rectal bleeding, obstruction, diarrhoea and incontinence. Significant improvement was achieved in 15 (88 per cent) and there were no complications. The procedure was carried out with simple bowel preparation and minimal sedation and, for otherwise fit individuals, the mean total hospital stay was 6.8 days, with day case therapy sometimes possible. Three patients required further therapy for recurrent symptoms 6-8 weeks after treatment. Fourteen patients died 1-39 weeks after therapy (mean survival 15 weeks). Three are alive and free of bowel symptoms after 39-54 weeks. This technique is the only non-surgical therapy that can be used safely for lesions above the peritoneal reflection and provides palliation at least as good as electrocoagulation, cryotherapy and radiotherapy with minimal upset to these seriously ill patients.\r"

The 226 patients were given 1 g metronidazole IV on induction of anaesthesia and 12 h postoperatively. Following standardized saline irrigation of the abdominal cavity, a uriculture dipslide was dipped in the residual fluid just before abdominal closure. The dipslide was incubated for 18 h, and colony counts of coliforms and Staphylococcus aureus were made. The number of colony-forming units (CFU) was classified as 0, 1-4 or greater than or equal to 5 (n = 123, 33 and 70). The patients with CFU greater than or equal to 5 were randomized to receive cefuroxime (1.5 g IV/8 h for 2 days) or no more antibiotics. In the patients given only metronidazole, the incidence of postoperative infections rose with the colony counts (5.7, 9.1 and 41.2 per cent with CFU 0, 1-4 and greater than or equal to 5). Addition of cefuroxime reduced the 41.2 per cent infection rate to 8.3 per cent (P = 0.003). The method thus identified a high-risk group in which a short postoperative course of cefuroxime significantly lowered the rate of sepsis.\r"

One group received pre-operative systemic gentamicin and metronidazole while the other group received 1 per cent topical povidone-iodine solution in addition to the antibiotics. For early appendicitis including normal and acutely inflamed appendices, only one dose of antibiotics was used. The postoperative wound sepsis was very low in both groups of patients and there was no statistical difference between them. For late appendicitis including gangrenous and perforated appendices, the antibiotics were continued for 7 days. Eight out of 51 patients who had the topical agent developed wound sepsis compared with one out of 52 patients who received no topical agent. This difference is statistically significant (P = 0.03). All wound infections presented within 2 weeks of operation and were deep. Povidone-iodine, 1 per cent, adversely affects the wound infection rate in late appendicitis and should not be used.\r"

The results of these two methods were compared. The radiologists and endoscopists were unaware of the result of each others' examination at the time of their own investigation. Altogether ten subjects with carcinoma in the rectosigmoid area were found. The radiologists and endoscopists each overlooked four of these ten carcinomas and only four of the carcinomas were diagnosed with both methods. Fifty-six of one hundred and seven adenomas were 1 cm or larger in diameter and located in the rectum or the sigmoid colon. Thirteen of the fifty-six adenomas were missed by double contrast enema and ten by endoscopy and only thirty-three adenomas were diagnosed with both methods. Neoplasms in the rectum and the sigmoid colon are sometimes difficult to diagnose with both radiology and endoscopy. Rectosigmoidoscopy (60 cm) should therefore be used as a complement to double contrast enemas if this method is chosen for investigation of a patient with rectal bleeding.\r"

Strong binding was found to disaggregated primary colorectal cancer cells, with a median of 66 per cent of the cells in the tumour gate binding the antibody. There was a median binding ratio of 8.6:1 compared with normal immunoglobulin. The pattern of immunohistological staining was typical of that for an antibody to CEA. All seven patients with primary colorectal cancer imaged pre-operatively using 111In-labelled C46 gave positive images. The median tumour:non-tumour antibody uptake ratio from resected specimens (n = 8) was 5.8:1. (1.7-7.6:1). Eight of 11 sites of secondary colorectal cancer gave positive images. The high affinity and good tumour localization of C46 have improved clinical imaging and increase the possibilities for targetting of antitumour agents.\r"

The two groups were evenly matched for age, sex, Dukes' stage and histological differentiation. There were significantly more rectal tumours in the transfused group (P less than 0.01), but the distribution of colonic lesions did not differ. Life table analysis revealed that the transfused patients had a 20 per cent greater probability of recurrence at 5 years (P less than 0.005) and there were 16 per cent more cancer related deaths (P less than 0.01). Even when all rectal cancers were excluded, a similar trend was seen for the colonic lesions: a 24 per cent greater probability of recurrence at 5 years (P less than 0.025) and 15 per cent more cancer related deaths (P less than 0.02). We conclude that blood transfusion may be associated with increased mortality and recurrence in patients undergoing curative surgery for colorectal cancer.\r"

Careful preservation of the floor of the tracts leads to re-epithelialization with disease-free skin. More radical surgery is unnecessary and the problems of covering widely excised areas in this heavily contaminated region are avoided. By spreading the treatment over several operating sessions and hospital admissions, postoperative discomfort and in-patient nursing requirements are minimized. The technique of deroofing is described and the treatment of three severe cases is discussed. One patient illustrated the recognized complication of malignant change occurring in long-standing untreated disease. A fourth case illustrates the difficulties in diagnosing perianal hidradenitis suppurativa and literature cited suggests it to be a more common condition than once thought and a diagnosis frequently missed.\r"

Peptic ulcer surgery performed at a young age (means = 29 years, range 21-37) appears to be the only identifiable risk factor. The results of medical treatment with bile salt binding agents were disappointing in the long term. In 10 out of 13 patients treated with antiperistaltic segments, the procedure had to be reversed because of episodes of severe postprandial colic, intestinal obstruction and bacterial overgrowth. A good result with relief of the explosive diarrhoea was obtained by the distal onlay reversed ileal graft in six out of seven patients. This procedure creates a passive non-propulsive segment, and has no undesirable sequelae. It should be considered in those patients in whom the diarrhoea is not controlled by conservative measures.\r"

Thirty-four were men and sixty were women, their mean age was 69.7 years and the median hospital stay was 20 days. There were 15 deaths (16 per cent) by 30 days in patients with significantly lower initial serum albumin levels (P less than 0.005) and significantly higher serum urea levels (P less than 0.05) than survivors. Eighty-two patients had common bile duct (CBD) calculi of whom 71 underwent early decompression of the biliary tree either surgically (28) or by ES(43). Early surgical decompression was associated with a significantly higher 30 day mortality (6/28) than early ES (2/43) (P less than 0.02) despite the fact that patients undergoing early ES were significantly older (P less than 0.02) and had significantly more medical risk factors (P less than 0.05). Of the 43 patients undergoing early ES 7 had had a previous cholecystectomy, 13 underwent subsequent elective cholecystectomy with no mortality and the remaining 23 had the gallbladder left in situ because of advanced age (mean age 79 years) and frailty. Only 2 of the 23 have since required cholecystectomy. We suggest that patients with acute cholangitis who do not rapidly respond to conservative treatment should undergo early ES with early surgery reserved for those who do not improve following ES. Elective cholecystectomy following successful ES can often be avoided in the elderly and frail.\r"

We compared the peak latencies of the components of this response both between these groups and with normal subjects, controlling for the effects of age. We found highly significant electrophysiological differences not only between the subcortical group (combined patients with Huntington's and Parkinson's disease) and the cortical group (patients with Alzheimer's disease), but also within the subcortical group itself. Using the pattern of electrophysiological response alone, we were able to classify correctly most of our patients using a logistic regression model. These results support the notion that there are distinguishable subtypes of dementia.\r"

  ".W": "Muscle tone, if defined as the resistance felt during passive movement of an extremity, is generally explained by the appearance of stretch reflexes. Consequently, hypotonia would be caused by a decrease or disappearance of these reflexes. This notion has never been challenged by experiments that reproduce the clinical situation. In this study two clinical tests, passive extension and flexion movements at the knee joint and a free fall of the lower leg with gravity, were applied to 72 control legs and 35 'hypotonic' legs. EMG activity was measured in the quadriceps muscle. Despite special care to obtain relaxation in the subjects, the majority of control legs showed voluntary EMG activity on passive movement. During free fall, long-latency reflexes were present in a minority of normal subjects, but the velocity of falling in these legs was within the range obtained in the legs without any EMG spikes. If the fall time was prolonged beyond the upper limit of relaxed legs, this was the result of voluntary activity, confirmed by EMG measurements. Therefore, long-latency stretch reflexes play no role in the clinical assessment of 'normal tone'. This conclusion was further supported by the observation that 'hypotonic' legs did not fall faster than relaxed control legs. If patient's legs feel flaccid this is the result of weakness preventing voluntary activity. Passive movements during the clinical examination are of great value, but only to detect spasticity or rigidity.\r"

Using this technique, the response latencies of identical sets of movements were compared across conditions in which the degree and type of advance movement information were manipulated. Specifically, prior information concerning three movement dimensions (the direction and extent of forthcoming movements, as well as the limb to be used) was or was not provided. Eight patients with Parkinson's disease and 8 neurologically normal age-matched controls served as subjects. The experiment showed that the elevated reaction times of the Parkinsonian subjects are not primarily caused by delays in response selection. Estimates of specification times for each of the three dimensions showed only a modest slowing in parkinsonians. The specification of those movement dimensions unknown before the response signal appears to occur serially, and can occur in a variable order as in normals. Since parkinsonians can initiate movements with shorter latencies when partial or complete information is available, albeit more slowly than normals, we conclude that response selection and specification processes preceding rapid discrete movements are relatively unaffected by the disease. The overall slowness in movement initiation in parkinsonians as compared with normals may in part be caused by excessive delays in motor time and, in general, to those 'input' and/or 'output' processes which are unaffected by advance information.\r"

The similarity in location and function of these joints would suggest similar proprioceptive mechanisms, but proprioceptive ability was found to be quite different for the two joints. The method of distinguishing a static-position sense from a movement sense was based on whether a subject's ability to detect a small change in joint position was impaired when the rate of rotation was progressively reduced. An awareness of static-position should not depend on the rate at which a joint is placed into position. However, if subjects use movement signals to detect changes in joint position, slowing the rate of displacement should reduce the intensity of these signals and make the displacements more difficult to detect. This method indicated a static-position sense with the MCP joint but only a movement sense with the PIP joint. It was confirmed that sensory input from regions of skin not stretched or deformed by rotation of the joint can influence proprioceptive sensibility with the fingers. Anaesthesia of the tip of the index finger or of the thumb blunted subject's perceptions of movement of the PIP joint of the index finger. However, anaesthesia of the PIP joint itself had no observable effect on the ability to sense movement of the joint.\r"

  ".W": "Changes in coordinated eye and hand movements associated with the progress of bradykinesia were studied in 31 parkinsonian patients and 8 age-matched healthy subjects. Among the parameters expressing the changes in motor behaviour, the interval between the onset of eye and hand movements was most sensitive. This parameter reflected the difference in the progress of the symptom in the two motor systems. An increase in the reaction time of the hand response appeared in patients of grade II bradykinesia; this was observed for eye movements only in patients with grade III (severe) bradykinesia. While the changes in ocular reaction time remained within the physiological range, a lengthening of the reaction time, a reduction in peak velocity, a decrease in the open-loop gain, a prolongation of movement duration, and a slow build-up in EMG activity, appeared from an early stage in hand movement. These signs of motor disturbance may appear eventually in every motor system at an advanced stage, but their development is not synchronous in different motor systems. An analysis of the responses recorded simultaneously from the two motor systems examined made it possible to evaluate the changes in the sensorimotor processes with different grades of bradykinesia. A comparison between reaction times for eye and hand movements may be useful for assessing the degree of bradykinesia in parkinsonian patients.\r"

This difficulty cannot be accounted for by frequency or familiarity and is unaffected by whether the stimulus is a line drawing, photograph or model. The deficit does not represent development lag, as normal children of the same naming age differ qualitatively. The results, which include a one year follow-up, are discussed in relation to unitary versus multiple semantic systems. The disorder includes a disturbance of memory arising during the developmental period. It is suggested that items which are involved in daily actions can be more easily remembered than those which are identified by sensory features alone, and that the preserved learning of motor skills in acquired amnesia may be of relevance.\r"

Conventional electromyography and nerve conduction studies, computerized motor unit number estimation and motor unit potential analysis, vibration threshold studies and a recently introduced technique for heat and cold threshold estimations were undertaken in all patients. The results provide unequivocal evidence of widespread nervous system dysfunction. In many patients there is significant involvement of peripheral large diameter motor and sensory fibres and of small diameter sensory fibres either peripherally and/or centrally. In the light of these results and others reviewed in the literature, the concept of myotonic dystrophy as a pure myopathy can no longer be sustained.\r"

Affected individuals are at risk of developing a number of other lesions, the most serious of which are renal carcinoma, haemangioblastomas elsewhere in the central nervous system and phaeochromocytoma. Patients with this disease can therefore present to a number of disciplines during their lifetime and unless the possibility of von Hippel-Lindau disease is considered, the patient may wrongly be assumed to have an isolated lesion. Twenty patients with cerebellar haemangioblastomas were seen between 1972 and 1985; the diagnosis of von Hippel-Lindau disease was subsequently established in 8. Although the diagnosis had not previously been considered, in retrospect 7/8 cases were known to be at risk of this syndrome. These cases came from 7 families and an additional 4 relatives are also known to have been affected. Mean age of presentation for the various manifestations of von Hippel-Lindau disease, each of which occurred in one or other of our cases, has been calculated from 9 of our patients and 107 others reported in the literature. Clinically significant manifestations almost invariably developed before the age of 50 years. Limited screening of our index cases and their at-risk relatives demonstrated one asymptomatic renal carcinoma. We propose a protocol for screening all individuals at risk of von Hippel-Lindau disease, which involves annual retinal examination from five years, and biennial computerized tomography of the head and abdomen from fifteen and twenty years, respectively.\r"

This will most certainly bring these children back into their communities, where they will make demands on general physicians and nurses. Educational integration will challenge the schools, and community groups such as the Red Cross Society and service organizations will have to fill the gaps. In doing so, these agencies and the professionals involved will have to cooperate in the interests of the child with chronic disease. However, there are sufficient rewards helping the ill child get home to make the increased effort worth while.\r"

  ".W": "The MD program at McMaster University, Hamilton, Ont., differs from that at most other Canadian universities in the profile of students admitted and in its teaching methods. To investigate influences of selection policy outcomes and the education program, the career choices of 408 McMaster graduates were compared with those of 1620 graduates of other Canadian English-language schools by analysis of data from the CMA's Physician Manpower Data Bank. Compared with graduates of other schools, McMaster graduates were more likely to have chosen internal medicine, less likely to have chosen surgery and equally likely to have chosen primary care as their medical field. Of those in primary care, a higher proportion of McMaster graduates than other graduates held certification in family medicine. This was largely responsible for the overall higher rate of certification in the McMaster group. While the nature of practice and time spent on patient care did not differ between the two groups, several variables, including time spent on professional activities other than patient care, proportion involved in research and classroom teaching, and proportion of salaried physicians employed by universities, indicated a higher than average level of interest in academic medicine among the McMaster graduates. This could be partially explained by differences in the student profile if students who are interested in education are more likely to choose an educationally innovative medical school.\r"

More variation was found for estimates in the obese subject than for those in the two subjects of normal build (p = 0.004). No difference in variation was found between consultants and house staff.
