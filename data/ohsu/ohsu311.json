  ".W": "Traveler's diarrhea affects a substantial number of travelers to high-risk areas of the world. The key to controlling this troublesome disease is prevention. The most important preventive measures depend on educating patients to consume only safe foods and pure water. Physicians cannot overemphasize the importance of avoiding high-risk foods and of boiling water if a safe water supply is not available. Prophylactic medications are a secondary consideration and should be prescribed with discretion. In most cases, diarrhea is mild and self-limited, requiring only fluid and electrolyte replacement and perhaps an antidiarrheal agent. In moderate to severe cases, the addition of an antimicrobial agent may be of benefit. Until an efficacious polyvalent vaccine is developed, caution and common sense, together with discretionary dietary and hygienic practices, are the best defenses against traveler's diarrhea. The ultimate solution is greatly improved sanitation and personal hygiene, especially in high-risk countries. However, only dreamers will consider waiting for this transformation to occur.\r"

Nickel chlorins have been reported from geological sources but not from living organisms. Its occurrence in a living system suggests a metabolic role for tunichlorin and may clarify the selective accumulation of nickel by marine tunicates. Because Trididemnum tunicates are associated with algal symbionts, tunichlorin may arise directly from the tunicate, from symbiotic algae, or from tunicate modification of an algal chlorin.\r"

The results presented here show that base composition near the center of the operator affects the operator's affinity for repressor by altering the ease with which the operator can be overtwisted into the proper configuration for complex formation. We show that both DNA flexibility and repressor flexibility influence the strength of the repressor-operator interaction: an operator with a single-strand nick at its center has a higher affinity for repressor than does the intact operator: and a repressor bearing a mutation that results in a relaxed dimer interaction is less sensitive than is wild type to changes in the flexibility of the operator. We show that the effect of noncontacted base pairs on operator affinity is independent of the slight overall bend of the operator seen in the repressor-operator complex. Central sequence effects on affinity for repressor are independent of the identity of adjacent base pairs, suggesting that the structure of the individual base pairs, not interactions between them, are responsible for the different torsional rigidities of different operators.\r"

  ".W": "The COOH-terminal amino acid of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is shown to covalently link with ethanolamine, evidence consistent with the anchorage of CEA to the plasma membrane through a phosphatidylinositol-glycan tail. Purified CEA was digested with trypsin, and the resulting peptides were isolated by reverse-phase HPLC. Tryptic hexapeptide T12, terminating atypically with alanine, corresponded in sequence (Ser-Ile-Thr-Val-Ser-Ala) with the last six residues (637-642) of the third repeating domain in the mature CEA protein. Mass determination of the hexapeptide by fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry suggested the presence of an additional ethanolamine moiety. This finding and the absence of the subsequent 26 hydrophobic residues predicted by cDNA sequence is evidence that hexapeptide T12 is the COOH-terminal peptide of mature CEA. A synthetic peptide identical to hexapeptide T12 was prepared, and ethanolamine was coupled to its COOH-terminal alanine; chromatographic properties of this synthetic ethanolamine-coupled peptide and peptide T12 were the same. B/E-linked-scan mass spectral analysis of the ethanolamine-coupled synthetic peptide and peptide T12 revealed a fragment ion series consistent with the presence of a COOH-terminal ethanolamine. Release of membrane-bound CEA from the CEA-expressing cell line LS 174T was shown by indirect immunofluorescence and flow cytometry after treatment with phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C. We conclude that CEA is processed posttranslationally to remove the hydrophobic COOH-terminal residues (643-668) with subsequent addition of an ethanolamine-glycosylphosphatidylinositol moiety and that treatment of a colonic cell line with phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C releases membrane-bound CEA.\r"

We have probed the equilibrium structure of a junction by means of hydroxyl radicals generated by the reaction of iron(II)EDTA with hydrogen peroxide. The hydroxyl radical cleavage pattern shows twofold symmetry throughout the molecule. Strong protection from hydroxyl radical attack is evident on two strands near the branch site, and weaker protection may be seen four or five residues 3' to the branch site on the other two strands. No other position appears significantly distinct from double-helical DNA controls. From these data, we conclude that the Holliday junction is a twofold symmetric complex whose four arms form two stacking domains.\r"

  ".W": "Expression of the pea rbcS-3A gene, one of a family of genes encoding the small subunit of ribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase [EC 4.1.1.39], is regulated by light and is restricted to chloroplast-containing cells. We analyzed the effects of light and development on rbcS-3A expression in transgenic plants. Two highly conserved sequences (\"boxes\" II and III) around nucleotide position -150 (relative to the transcription initiation site, +1) are required for rbcS-3A expression. The so-defined positive elements overlap with previously identified negative light-regulatory elements. In the case of box II, which has sequence similarity to the core enhancer motif of simian virus 40, a GG----CC transversion is sufficient to abolish expression. The effect of mutations in boxes II and III can only be measured when sequences upstream of -170 are removed, and because sequences both 5' and 3' of -170 can direct light-regulated and organ-specific expression. This implies that there is a redundancy of cis-acting elements in the 5' noncoding region of rbcS-3A. However, we show that the sequences upstream of -170 are dispensable only in the mature leaves of a green plant. In contrast, in the young, expanding leaves at the top of a green plant, as well as in seedlings, the distal elements are required for high-level expression. Therefore, redundancy is not absolute, and the requirements for rbcS-3A expression change during plant development.\r"

This observation suggests a functional role for one or both of these regions in enzymatic activity. We have examined the role of one of these regions, located near the amino terminus of the S1 subunit, by using a high-level recombinant expression system and progressive truncation of the gene sequence encoding the amino terminus of the molecule. A series of six truncated, recombinant proteins were produced at high levels in E. coli and examined for their enzymatic and antigenic properties. The three molecules that lacked most or all of the homology box delimited by amino acid residues 8 and 15 lacked detectable enzymatic activity. All of the three molecules in which the box was retained exhibited detectable activity. Only those recombinant molecules that possessed the homology box reacted with a neutralizing and passively protective monoclonal anti-S1 antibody. These findings identify the region of homology located near the amino terminus of S1 as an apparent enzymatic subsite and a potentially important antigenic determinant.\r"

Very little TK mRNA could be detected in either the nuclear or the cytoplasmic compartment from cells harvested in G0 or G1. At the onset of S phase, however, the level of nuclear TK mRNA precursors and mature TK mRNAs increased dramatically. The high molecular weight TK heterogeneous nuclear RNA species detected in the nuclei of S-phase cells were polyadenylylated and hybridized to intron sequences derived from the TK gene. A series of high molecular weight precursors could be chased to lower molecular weight species in the presence of actinomycin D, suggesting an ordered removal of intron sequences with the kinetics of a precursor-product relationship. These results demonstrate a striking change in the nuclear posttranscriptional processing of TK heterogeneous nuclear RNA at the G1-S boundary and, furthermore, define a model system for the examination of RNA-processing events in vivo.\r"

Most of the malignant specimens were sensitive to TNF with 13 of 18 specimens showing 90% inhibition of clonal growth (ID90) by less than 500 units of TNF per ml of culture fluid. In contrast, all 13 nonmalignant specimens tested clustered at the resistant end of the TNF response spectrum, with ID90 values being greater than 5000 units of TNF per ml of culture fluid. This differential sensitivity to TNF was seen in three cases in which malignant and nonmalignant breast epithelial tissues from the same patient were studied. To investigate the mechanism of resistance to TNF by normal cells, the presence of receptors for TNF was determined. Five of six cultures showed specific binding of 125I-labeled TNF and there was no relationship between the degree of resistance and the degree of specific binding. Simultaneous comparison of tumor responsiveness to doxorubicin and TNF revealed a positive correlation in ID90 values; these results may have important implications for the clinical use of TNF in cancer patients heavily pretreated with doxorubicin.\r"

  ".W": "We have identified specific binding sites for pancreatic polypeptide (PP) on the mucosal lining of canine small intestine. The present study was undertaken to further characterize these binding sites (receptors) on purified intestinal membranes and to establish their location on the brush border or basolateral surface of the intestinal enterocyte. Basolateral and brush border membranes were prepared by sorbitol density centrifugation. PP receptors were localized predominantly to the vascular surface, and thus binding of PP 125I-labeled on Tyr-27 to the basolateral preparation was used to evaluate receptor characteristics. Binding of PP was calcium, time, temperature, and pH dependent. Maximum specific binding of labeled PP occurred after an 8-hr incubation at 4 degrees C with 5 mM calcium at pH 6.8. Data analysis by Scatchard plot showed high- and low-affinity binding sites with relative affinities of 1.5 x 10(-9) M and 2.6 x 10(-8) M and with corresponding binding capacities of 0.23 pmol/mg and 0.84 pmol/mg of protein, respectively. This receptor was specific for PP since peptide YY and neuropeptide Y, peptides of the PP family, cross-reacted by less than 3%, as judged from comparisons of half-maximal displacement of label. Structurally dissimilar peptides, insulin and glucagon, did not compete for binding. Specific 125I-labeled PP binding was localized primarily to basolateral membranes (9.8 +/- 0.8%) with little binding by brush border membranes (0.8 +/- 0.2%). Thus, we have identified highly specific receptors for PP, located predominantly on the vascular surface of the small intestinal mucosa. These data suggest that the mucosal lining of the small intestine is a target tissue for PP and that PP participates in the hormonal regulation of fuel metabolism and substrate transport in the small intestinal mucosa.\r"

A mutant cell line obtained from the heterotrophic line is green and autotrophic. Heavy modification of amyloplast DNA with a variety of methylated bases was demonstrated by analysis of the acid hydrolysate of DNA by high-performance liquid chromatography, but little modification of chloroplast DNA from the green line was detected. When plastid DNAs from the original and green cell lines were digested with methyl-sensitive restriction enzymes, DNA methylation was detected in regions containing the genes for the large subunit of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (rbcL), subunits of chloroplast coupling factor 1 (atpA, -B, and -E), the apoprotein of P700 (psaA), and ribosomal protein S4 (rps4) but not the genes for 16S rRNA and the 32-kDa QB protein (psbA) in the original line, whereas no methylation was observed in the green line. The genes for which methylation was not detectable were found to be active as templates for in vitro transcription by Escherichia coli RNA polymerase, but the methylated genes were apparently inactive. Methylation of DNA is a likely mechanism for the regulation of expression of amyloplast DNA in sycamore cells.\r"

A construct containing only 45 base pairs of the promoter failed to target expression of the reporter to the pituitary, indicating that the pituitary expression is directed by information contained in the segment spanning positions -181 to -45. In the pituitary, immunohistochemistry showed transgene expression mainly in the growth hormone-producing cells (somatotrophs), in a subset of cells producing thyrotropin, and occasionally in prolactin-producing cells. These data establish that cis-active elements contained within the first 180 base pairs of the promoter are sufficient for transcriptional activation of the growth hormone gene in somatotrophs and suggest a functional relationship among growth hormone, prolactin, and thyrotropin gene activation.\r"

Alu repeats arising at earlier times share correlated blocks of differences from the current consensus at diagnostic positions in the sequence. Using these 26 positions, we can recognize four subfamilies and the older ones are each successively closer to the 7SL sequence. It appears that there has existed a series of conserved genes that are the primary sources of the Alu repeat family, presumably through retroposition. These genes have probably replaced each other in overlapping relays during the evolution of primates.\r"

The other subfamily, Alu-S, can be divided further into well-defined branches of sequences. These findings revise the previous picture of the Alu family and expose their complex evolutionary dynamics. They reveal sequence variations of potential importance for the proliferation of Alu repeats and relate them to their structural features. In addition, they open the possibility of using different types of Alu sequences as natural markers for studying genetic rearrangements in the genome.\r"

The equivalence principle helps explain the appearance of phenocopies. It also points to a general pathway favorable to the occurrence, during evolution, of frequent episodes corresponding to Waddington's genetic assimilation and is likely to represent one component of the system responsible for the high frequency of recurrence of parallel evolution.\r"

The strongest NS activity was found in a fraction of relatively low-density cells (1.063 less than p less than 1.075) obtained by equilibrium density centrifugation. Further purification and characterization of these NS cells by using a fluorescence-activated cell sorter indicated that wheat germ agglutinin (WGA)-positive cells have potent NS activity, whereas WGA-negative cells have no NS activity. Spleen colony-forming unit (CFU-S) assays demonstrated a significant correlation between the number of CFU-S cells and the NS activity in the bone marrow. However, WGA-positive cells obtained from the bone marrow of animals treated with 5-fluorouracil, which cells in turn were exposed to 5-fluorouracil, showed a marked reduction in NS activity. These results suggest that the pluripotent stem cells have NS activity when the cells are in the cycling phase but not when the cells are in the G0 phase.

The conjugates were capable of converting a relatively noncytotoxic prodrug, etoposide phosphate (EP), into etoposide--a drug with significant antitumor activity. In vitro studies with a human colon carcinoma cell line, H3347, demonstrated that while EP was less toxic than etoposide by a factor of greater than 100, it was equally toxic when the cells were pretreated with L6-AP, a conjugate that bound to the surface of H3347 cells. The L6-AP conjugate localized in H3347 tumor xenografts in nude mice and histological evaluation indicated that the targeted enzyme (AP) was distributed throughout the tumor mass. A strong antitumor response was observed in H3347-bearing mice that were treated with L6-AP followed 18-24 hr later by EP. This response, which included the rejection of established tumors, was superior to that of EP (P less than 0.005) or etoposide (P less than 0.001) given alone. The IF5-AP conjugate did not bind to H3347 cells and did not enhance the toxicity of EP on these cells in vitro. In addition, IF5-AP did not localize to H3347 tumors in nude mice and did not demonstrate enhanced antitumor activity in combination with the prodrug.\r"

All of the chimeric antibodies showed different degrees of ADCC with human lymphocytes, monocytes, and granulocytes and with murine macrophages. Monocytes and macrophages were able to utilize the chimeric IgG1 and, to a lesser degree, IgG4 and IgG3 antibodies to lyse tumor-cell targets in ADCC assays. The chimeric IgG1 and IgG4 antibodies were nearly as effective as the parental CO17-1A antibody in inhibiting tumor growth in nude mice.

Treatment of bovine parathyroid cells with phorbol ester, which activates protein kinase C directly, and with phospholipase C, which produces diacylglycerol, an activator of protein kinase C, significantly stimulated protein kinase C activity. Both agents also enhanced the release of parathyroid hormone. Acute exposure of bovine parathyroid cells to low extracellular calcium (0.5 mM) caused a 5- to 6-fold increase in protein kinase C activity associated with the particulate fraction. In contrast, high extracellular calcium (1.75 mM and 2.5 mM) markedly decreased membrane protein kinase C activity. These data suggest that the effects of extracellular calcium on parathyroid hormone secretion are due, at least in part, to regulation of protein kinase C activity in the parathyroid-cell membrane.\r"

  ".W": "The albumin (Alb), IgG, and IgM concentrations in the endoneurium of fascicular sural nerve biopsy samples were evaluated in controls (n = 9 or 10), diabetic patients without neuropathy (n = 6), and diabetic patients with polyneuropathy (n = 17 or 18). These values were significantly increased in diabetic patients with and without neuropathy when expressed both per endoneurial dry weight or endoneurial total protein compared to biopsy samples from healthy controls. When these concentrations, expressed per endoneurial total protein, were related to plasma concentrations similarly expressed, the resulting blood-nerve barrier (BNB) indices were significantly increased for Alb (6.1 times; P less than 0.00001), IgG (4.9 times; P = 0.00037), and IgM (2.7 times; P = 0.015). The diabetic patients without neuropathy (defined as having an index of pathology of greater than 0.65; a measure of the severity of the pathological abnormality based on morphological criteria) also had significant increases in two of these BNB indices that were intermediate between the diabetic neuropathy patients and controls (Alb, 3.9 times controls; P = 0.00002: IgG, 4.6 times controls; P = 0.00016: IgM, 1.8 times controls; not significant). No correlations were observed between the endoneurial concentrations of these plasma proteins or the BNB indices and the index of pathology, suggesting that these increases in endoneurial plasma proteins precede the pathologic alterations. The increased values for the diabetics in the absence of pathological abnormalities may prove useful in predicting neuropathic complications. The ratio of the IgG-BNB index to the Alb-BNB index was decreased 19%, and the ratio of the IgM-BNB index to the Alb-BNB index was decreased 56% in diabetic neuropathy patients compared to controls. Although the IgG and IgM concentrations are increased in the diabetic endoneurium, the Alb increase is greater and a mechanism other than size indiscriminate extravasation of plasma proteins, therefore, is suggested. Morphometric assessment of the endoneurial compartments, which would be expected to contain these plasma proteins, suggests that they are not altered in diabetic neuropathy; hence, it is hypothesized that the observed increase in endoneurial concentration of these plasma proteins results from altered transport through the endothelial or perineurial barrier, which supports an underlying vascular mechanism in the development of diabetic polyneuropathy.\r"

Weight gains of the kidneys and spleen, however, were greater with rhIGF-I than with hGH, whereas the weight of the epididymal fat pads was reduced with rhIGF-I. The weight of the thymus was increased by rhIGF-I treatment. Thus, IGF-I administered over a prolonged period of time mimics GH effects in hypophysectomized rats. Quantitative differences between rhIGF-I and hGH treatment with respect to organ weights may be related to different forms of circulating IGF-I or may be due to independent effects of GH and IGF-I. The results support the somatomedin hypothesis, but they also stress the role of GH as a modulator of IGF-I action.\r"

Material from 3 of these positives was serially transmitted in a second passage.

Its two analogues, PTX-343 and PTX-334 (the numerals denoting the number of methylenes between the amino groups of the spermine moiety), are also active on the glutamate synapse of the locust leg muscle; PTX-334 was more potent and PTX-343 was less potent than the natural toxin. Such chemicals are useful for studying, labeling, and purifying glutamate receptors and may become models for an additional class of therapeutic drugs and possibly insecticides.\r"

  ".W": "Optic tract fibers and cell bodies in the lateral geniculate nucleus of the monkey were studied intracellularly with micropipette electrodes containing the marker enzyme horseradish peroxidase. Single optic-tract fibers always projected to only one of the six geniculate layers. The majority of the axons innervating the four parvocellular laminae were red/green opponent color units; their terminations formed cylindrical columns that were perpendicular to the layers. In similar fashion, the geniculate cells in the parvocellular layers were mostly red/green units with narrow, bipolar dendritic fields oriented normal to the laminar borders. The majority of the retinal axons ending in parvocellular layers 6 and 5 were on-center units; nearly all geniculate cells in these two laminae were also on-center neurons. In layers 4 and 3 most terminating optic-tract fibers, as well as the geniculate cells themselves, were off-center units. All axons projecting to the magnocellular layers were broad-band units with spherical terminal arborizations. The magnocellular geniculate neurons, which were also broad band, had extensive spherical dendritic fields that often crossed laminar borders. Thus, the terminal patterns of each class of retinogeniculate axon closely resembled the dendritic orientations of the functionally related geniculate target cells.\r"

The high affinity (Kd, 40-100 pM) and specificity of the binding site are retained throughout the purification procedure. Analysis of the purified material on silver-stained NaDodSO4/polyacrylamide gel revealed three bands of Mr 76,000-80,000, 38,000, and 35,000. Interestingly, the binding site for 125I-labeled mast cell degranulating peptide, another putative K+-channel ligand from bee venom, which induces long-term potentiation in hippocampus, seems to reside on the same protein complex, as both binding sites copurify through the entire purification protocol.\r"

Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequences shows that the A and B forms have subunit molecular weights of 59,700 and 58,800, respectively, and have 70% sequence identity. Both sequences contain the pentapeptide Ser-Gly-Gly-Cys-Tyr, in which the obligatory cofactor FAD is covalently bound to cysteine. Based on differences in primary amino acid sequences and RNA gel blot analysis of mRNAs, the A and B forms of monoamine oxidase appear to be derived from separate genes.\r"

Poly(A)+ RNA was prepared from pancreatic AR42J cells, which normally express receptors for CCK and bombesin and the RNA injected into oocytes. The presence of these pancreatic receptors on the oocytes was then demonstrated by hormone-induced mobilization of 45Ca2+. CCK receptors were present 1 day (maximum, 2 days) after injection of RNA and were generally proportional to the amount of poly(A)+ RNA injected (1-50 ng). Oocyte CCK receptors retained selectivity for CCK analogs (CCK8 greater than unsulfated CCK8 greater than CCK4) and were blocked by the specific CCK receptor antagonist CR 1409. When poly(A)+ RNA was subjected to size fractionation on sucrose gradients, activity-inducing CCK receptors showed a single peak centered at 3 kilobases. The generality of this oocyte system for expressing Ca2+-mobilizing hormone receptors was further shown by expression of a response to bombesin after injection of AR42J cell RNA and a response to vasopressin and angiotensin II when poly(A)+ RNA from rat liver was injected. No response to CCK was demonstrable after injection of liver RNA, demonstrating the specificity of this assay.\r"

Interrater and intrarater reliability were determined for the total scores and individual item ratings using videotaped MMAS and Barthel Index assessments of seven patients with stroke. Therapists viewed and rated the videotaped assessments on two occasions separated by one month. The intrarater reliability results were higher than the interrater reliability results for total scores, and both results were acceptable statistically. Interrater and intrarater reliability of the individual item ratings were also determined. The MMAS and Barthel Index are reliable assessments of motor recovery and function for patients with stroke. Physical therapists are encouraged to use the two scales to document changes in the motor recovery and functional independence of patients with stroke.\r"

Clinicians have long noted its presence, prenatally and postnatally, but the magnitude of the problem is currently unknown. A cross-sectional design was used to test 71 primiparous women placed in one of five groups, based on placement within the childbearing year. A commonly accepted test for diastasis recti abdominis was performed. Palpation for diastasis recti abdominis at the linea alba was performed 4.5 cm above, 4.5 cm below, and at the umbilicus. Diastases were observed at all three places, but most often at the umbilicus. A significant relationship (p less than .05) was found between a woman's placement in her childbearing year and the presence or absence of the condition. Diastasis recti abdominis was observed initially in the women in the second trimester group. Its incidence peaked in the third trimester group; remained high in the women in the immediate postpartum group; and declined, but did not disappear, in the later postpartum group. These findings demonstrate the importance of testing for diastasis recti abdominis above, below, and at the umbilicus throughout and after the childbearing year.\r"

Hand function was evaluated by measuring subjects' grip and pinch strength, range of motion, edema, and sensation and with the Grip Function Test and self-assessment scale. A difference in all hand function test results was found in the extremity with the vascular access compared with the contralateral extremity. Comparison of short-term subjects (on MHD less than two years) with long-term subjects (on MHD greater than two years) revealed significantly lower handgrip strength (p less than .05) and pinch strength (p less than .05) and significantly higher hand volume (edema) (p less than .05) in the long-term group than in the short-term group. We suggest that both the chronicity of renal failure and the presence of a vascular access may contribute to deterioration of hand function. The presence of hand deterioration in patients on MHD identifies a new patient population and a need for early baseline measurement and periodic assessment by physical therapists or hand therapists as renal rehabilitation team members.\r"

Interrater reliability was tested on 91 patients in a five-week study. After a two-week training period, six physical therapists were paired so that each therapist was paired with each other therapist for one week. All patients were rated weekly with the ACIF by a pair of physical therapists. A total of 166 assessments were conducted. Concurrent validity was tested using descriptions of function of 10 hypothetical patients. Each patient description was assigned a score based on the ACIF. Ten experienced therapists were then asked to rank order the functional status of each patient based on the patient's description. The average of the physical therapists' rankings was correlated with the ranking determined with the ACIF scores. Reliability data were analyzed using Cohen's weighted Kappa. The weighted Kappa values ranged from .60 to .98. Validity data were analyzed with the Spearman rank-order correlation coefficient (rs = .81, p less than .01). The results of this study indicate that the ACIF is reliable between raters and valid in its ability to rank order functional status for patients with acute neurologic deficits.\r"

After a scoring system was established, the ACIF was examined to determine whether it met the design criteria. The average amount of time required to administer the ACIF was 12 minutes, demonstrating feasibility for use in acute care. Data from 28 patients with a cerebrovascular accident from the discharge categories of nursing home and rehabilitation center demonstrated that the ACIF was precise enough to detect functional status changes in patients with an acute neurologic impairment. Data from the original 75 patients were examined to determine the ability of the ACIF to separate patients by score into groups consistent with their discharge placement. A 1 x 3 analysis of variance and a Scheffe post hoc analysis demonstrated that the mean ACIF scores of patients in the three discharge categories were significantly different.\r"

This clinical report describes a biofeedback seat insert developed to improve erect sitting posture in children with cerebral palsy who have inadequate trunk control. The seat insert is easily placed against the back of any seating device. A momentary-contact pressure switch on the seat insert is activated when the child exerts pressure on it by extending his trunk. The pressure switch then activates a videocassette recorder or can be adapted to activate a television or radio. Five children with spastic cerebral palsy participated in this evaluation of the biofeedback seat insert. The results of this evaluation show that the children used the biofeedback seat insert effectively to actively improve their sitting posture by voluntarily extending their trunk against the pressure switch. The biofeedback seat insert offers physical therapists a valuable therapeutic training tool to encourage carry-over of improved sitting posture away from the clinical setting for children with cerebral palsy.\r"

Nineteen preoperative and perioperative variables were analysed by univariate and multivariate methods. The sole risk factor independently predictive of postoperative death was a poor functional class with a relative risk (RR) of 3.17 compared to patients with a better functional class. Independent risk factors of long term survival were; prior heart operation, presence of mitral regurgitation, age at operation and poor functional class. Estimation of the parameters of the Cox's model gave a predicted 3-year survival ranging from 95% to 11% for the most favourable and the less favourable risk factor combinations. Risk factors that affected late death were the presence of ischemic coronary etiology and poor functional class. Two modes of late death were identified each with its prognostic factor. The most common mode was cardiac-related death, its sole risk factor was the presence of ischemic coronary etiology. The RR ratio was 3.2 for patients with ischemic coronary etiology, compared to patients with other etiologies. Sudden cardiac death was the next, its independent risk factor was the age at operation with increasing hazard for younger patients.

Risk factors for early mortality, according to a stepwise logistic regression model, were male sex, concomitant heart surgery and prior valve replacement. For low-output syndrome, the major morbid event, the risk factors were endocarditic etiology, concomitant heart surgery and prior valve replacement. Survival curves were used to estimate univariate risk factors for total mortality. With a multivariate procedure, using the Cox regression model, two covariates were pin-pointed as independent prognostic factors in total mortality, viz. mitral regurgitation and concomitant heart surgery. The Cox model also showed the two covariates ischemic heart disease and endocarditic etiology to be risk factors in late mortality. Predicted 3-year survival was estimated with different combinations of these risk factors. The results were compared with earlier reports.\r"

Most of the prostheses were Starr-Edwards valves (38 silastic ball, SESB, and 96 cloth-covered, SECC). All patients received maintenance coumarin. The rate of thromboembolic complications was 1.6/100 patient-years, without difference between SESB and SECC valves although there were no episodes with SESB from 6 years postoperatively. The overall rate of valve-related complications (VRC)--thromboembolism, hemorrhage, endocarditis, re-replacement, etc.--was 4.2/100 patient-years. High preoperative cardiothoracic index (CTI) significantly increased the incidence of VRC. Preoperative NYHA class III-IV and high CTI similarly influenced the rate of serious VRC (= VRC excluding extremity emboli, epistaxis and subcutaneous bleeding). The valve-and-heart-related morbidity (= VRC including myocardial infarction and pacemaker requirement) was also influenced by preoperative CTI. The long-term complications thus were not exclusively attributable to the prosthesis, but also to preoperative patient-related data.\r"

In all cases there was histologic evidence of active infection in the surgical specimen. Only three of the 20 patients had no previous cardiac disease. The most common causal agent was Staphylococcus aureus. The indications for surgery were refractory cardiac failure or infection (18 and 2 cases, respectively). Aortic valve replacement was performed in 16 of the 20 cases, suggesting that aortic valvulopathy aggravates the course of infective endocarditis and increases the risk of heart failure. The overall mortality rate was 30%. All surviving patients were infection-free at postoperative bacteriologic follow-up. Surgery is considered to be the management of choice in active valvular, therapy-resistant bacterial endocarditis with or without cardiac failure.\r"

For further evaluation of protamine's mechanism of action, a three-part investigation was performed. In part I platelet-rich plasma (PRP) was prepared from canine blood samples (n = 6) taken before and 2 minutes after injection of protamine. In part II human PRP (n = 5) was preincubated with protamine or distilled water. Adenosine diphosphate-induced aggregation of protamine-treated platelets was unchanged, but thrombin-induced aggregation was inhibited in both canine and human preparations (p less than 0.05). In part III thrombocytopenia was produced in splenectomized dogs (n = 5), using microporous filters, to 4.5-8.4% of the initial platelet count. Protamine reversal of the heparinization caused hypotension (maximally -29 mmHg 90 s after protamine), but not pulmonary arterial hypertension. Leukopenia developed before additional thrombocytopenia appeared. Protamine-platelet interaction inhibits thrombin-induced platelet aggregation. Platelets may play an important role in the pulmonary pressure rise during protamine reversal, but do not mediate the systemic hypotension.\r"

In two others, radically extirpated localized mesothelioma was histologically classified as benign, but later proved to be malignant, causing death from recurrent disease 27 and 79 months postoperatively. Four patients with diffuse malignant mesothelioma underwent pleurectomy or open biopsy and survived for 2-9 months. Radical en-bloc pleuropneumonectomy was performed on 14 patients with diffuse malignant mesothelioma. One patient died postoperatively and the others succumbed to the disease after 3-51 (mean 20) months. The survival time was greater than or equal to 1 year in 62% of the patients and greater than 3 years in 23%. Patient age, histologic tumour type and extent of disease seemed to be important prognostic factors. Despite the generally poor prognosis, the results of radical surgery in this study appear to warrant an aggressive approach to treatment of benign or localized malignant pleural mesothelioma, and possibly also to stage I diffuse malignant mesothelioma of epithelial type.\r"

Post-operative lung function studies, including measurements of regional ventilation (Vr) and perfusion (Qr) by 133 Xenon technique showed that: 1) two weeks after surgery, forced expiratory volume at 1 s was more reduced after simple than after sleeve lobectomy, but in both groups Vr and its vertical gradient were similarly reduced in the operated lung compared to the contralateral; 2) one year after sleeve lobectomy, the vertical gradient of Vr tended to disappear in both lungs while Vr and Vr/Qr of the operated side increased significantly. These results indicate that early after surgery lung function may be less impaired after sleeve than simple lobectomy; however, long-term changes of regional lung function may occur after sleeve lobectomy resulting into a high Vr/Qr ratio in the operated lung.\r"

The technique consists of simultaneously randomizing two or three positions by oligonucleotide cassette mutagenesis, selecting for functional protein, and then sequencing to determine the spectrum of allowable substitutions at each position. Repeated application of this method to the dimer interface of the DNA-binding domain of lambda repressor reveals that the number and type of substitutions allowed at each position are extremely variable. At some positions only one or two residues are functionally acceptable; at other positions a wide range of residues and residue types are tolerated. The number of substitutions allowed at each position roughly correlates with the solvent accessibility of the wild-type side chain.\r"

A highly detailed and realistic model of the protein structures and their electrostatic interactions was used that was based on an atomic-level spatial description. Several structural features played a role in enhancing and optimizing the electron transfer efficiency of this reaction. Favorable electrostatic interactions facilitated long-lived nonspecific encounters between the proteins that allowed the severe orientational criteria for reaction to be overcome by rotational diffusion during encounters. Thus a \"reduction-in-dimensionality\" effect operated. The proteins achieved plausible electron transfer orientations in a multitude of electrostatically stable encounter complexes, rather than in a single dominant complex.\r"

Two arsenic salts (sodium arsenite and sodium arsenate) induced a high frequency of methotrexate-resistant 3T6 cells, which were shown to have amplified copies of the dihydrofolate reductase gene. The ability of arsenic to induce gene amplification may relate to its carcinogenic effects in humans since amplification of oncogenes is observed in many human tumors. The inability of arsenic to induce gene mutations may relate to the negative results of arsenic in long-term animal studies and suggests that these experiments may not detect some environmental agents that act late in the carcinogenic process in humans.\r"

Pretreatment with 10 nanomolar estradiol in vitro increased the specific nuclear binding of progesterone in four of six cell strains, indicating an induction of functional progesterone receptors. RNA blot analysis demonstrated the presence of messenger RNA for the human estrogen receptor. The data suggest that estrogen acts directly on human bone cells through a classical estrogen receptor-mediated mechanism.\r"

Neural crest cells from the axolotl embryo responded to extracellular matrix material explanted from the subepidermal migratory pathway by dispersing and by differentiating into pigment cells. In contrast, matrix material from the presumptive site of dorsal root ganglia stimulated pronounced cell-cell association and neurotypic expression. Cell line segregation during ontogeny of the neural crest that leads to diversification into pigment cells of the skin or into elements of the peripheral nervous system appears to be controlled in part by local cell-matrix interactions.\r"

The polypeptide backbone forms the interior of the hydrophilic, solvent-filled pore and the side chains form a hydrophobic and relatively regular surface on the outside of the pore. This example of a crystal structure of a solvent-filled ion pore provides a basis for understanding the physical nature of ion translocation.\r"

The pentadecapeptide crystallizes as a left-handed antiparallel double-stranded helical dimer with 5.6 amino acid residues per turn. The helix has an overall length of 31 angstroms and an average inner channel diameter of 4.80 angstroms. The channel of this crystalline form is void of ions or solvent molecules. The channel diameter varies from a minimum of 3.85 angstroms to a maximum of 5.47 angstroms and contains three pockets where the cross-channel contacts are 5.25 angstroms or greater. The range of variation seen for the phi and psi torsion angles of the backbone of the helix suggests that these potential ion binding sites can be induced to travel the length of the channel in a peristaltic manner by cooperatively varying these angles. The indole rings of the eight tryptophan residues of the dimer are overlapped in three separate regions on the outer surface of the helix when viewed down the barrel of the channel. This arrangement would permit long-chained lipid molecules to nest parallel to the outer channel surface between these protruding tryptophan regions and act like molecular splines to constrain helical twist deformations of the channel.\r"

Thus the X-ORF is proven to be a new retroviral gene. The p14 is present in SIVMne in molar amounts equivalent to those of the gag proteins. This is the first example of a retrovirus that contains a substantial quantity of a viral protein that is not a product of the gag, pro, pol, or env genes. SIV p14 and its homolog in HIV-2 may function as nucleic acid binding proteins since purified p14 binds to single-stranded nucleic acids in vitro. Antisera to the purified protein detected p14 in SIVMne, SIVmac, and a homologous protein (16 kilodaltons) in HIV-2 but did not react with HIV-1. Diagnostic procedures based on this novel protein will distinguish between HIV-1 and HIV-2.\r"

A key prediction of this view is that dishabituation and sensitization should always occur together. However, we show that dishabituation and sensitization, as well as an additional process, inhibition, can be behaviorally dissociated in Aplysia by (i) their differential time of onset, (ii) their differential sensitivity to stimulus intensity, and (iii) their differential emergence during development. A simple dual-process view cannot explain these results; rather, a multiprocess view appears necessary to account for nonassociative learning in Aplysia.\r"

Previous work indicated that the adaptation to mouse virulence is associated with the viral capsid proteins and that mutations in neutralization antigenic site I of poliovirus reduce neurovirulence of the Lansing strain in mice. The role of antigenic site I in mouse neurovirulence was further explored by constructing an antigenic hybrid virus. Six amino acids in antigenic site I of the Mahoney strain were replaced with a sequence specific for the Lansing strain by using a mutagenesis cartridge. The hybrid virus was neutralized by polyclonal antisera elicited by the type 1 and type 2 strains of poliovirus and by neutralizing monoclonal antibodies directed against antigenic site I of type 2 virus. The hybrid virus induced paralytic disease in mice, an observation demonstrating that a short sequence of amino acids in antigenic site I is an important determinant of poliovirus host range. Antigenic site I may be involved in attachment of poliovirus to cells of the mouse central nervous system.\r"

This gene is now shown to be inactivated in two of nine human breast cancer cell lines examined. The RB gene of one cell line had a homozygous internal duplication of a 5-kilobase region containing exons 5 and 6. The RB messenger RNA transcript was correspondingly lengthened, and its translation was probably terminated prematurely due to a shifted reading frame. The other cell line had a homozygous deletion of the RB gene that removed the entire gene beyond exon 2. The RB gene product, pp110RB, was not detectable in either cell line by immuno-precipitation with specific antibodies. These findings are significant in relation to proposed genetic mechanisms of breast cancer formation.\r"

Changes in the helical repeat, h, and in the winding number can be deduced solely from surface geometry and superhelix density, sigma. This treatment relates the theoretically important properties twist and writhe to the more experimentally accessible quantities phi, h, SLk, and sigma.

Glucocorticoid inhibition was conferred by a 52-nucleotide region that also contains elements crucial both for adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP) responsiveness and for placental-specific expression of this gene and was observed only under conditions in which these elements were functioning as enhancers. Purified glucocorticoid receptor was found to bind to DNA that overlap the cAMP responsive elements sites in this region.

Sera from HIV-1-infected patients and from goats immunized with polyacrylamide gel-purified HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (gp120), native gp120, or gp120-derived recombinant peptides, showed marked heterogeneity in neutralizing activity against these closely related viruses. The change of a single amino acid residue in gp120 may account for such \"clonal restriction\" of neutralizing activity.\r"

Medial corpectomy was performed at one to four levels. Iliac crest or fibular bone grafts were secured by plates anchored to the graft and adjacent vertebral bodies. All patients were placed in Minerva braces postoperatively. There was successful fusion in all cases, and no graft dislodgement or kyphosis. Early initiation of rehabilitation was achieved. Morbidity occurred in patients with severe spondylotic cervical myelopathy. This include respiratory depression requiring reintubation in 2/13 procedures, dysphagia (2/13) from loosening of the screws or prominent hardware and graft, and screw loosening (2/13). Neurological improvement was present in 85% (11/13) of patients. There was no deterioration of neurological function in any case. We conclude from this early follow-up that anterior bone fusion with supplemental plates provides effective stabilization for the unstable cervical spine. Greater morbidity risk exists in patients with severe spondylotic cervical myelopathy and spastic quadriparesis who required multilevel medial corpectomies and fusion.\r"

The clinical syndrome associated with this deformity is not well documented. In an attempt to describe this clinical syndrome more precisely, 21 patients with the diagnosis of degenerative scoliosis were identified and reviewed. Review included history with pain drawings when available, physical examination, bone densities, and standing spinal roentgenograms. Patients with spinal compression fractures, spondylolyses, prior history of scoliosis or radiographic findings consistent with an idiopathic scoliosis were excluded. Our review shows that these patients can develop, along with progressive scoliosis, loss of lumbar lordosis with a resulting flat back deformity. These patients commonly present in the sixth decade with a predominantly stenotic symptom complex, but often lack the classic feature of relief in a sitting posture. The number of male and female patients was approximately equal. Roentgenogram findings show a high angle deformity over a short number of spinal segments and an absence of bony features associated with idiopathic scoliosis such as lateral vertebral wedging and alterations of the lamina. The incidence of this condition remains to be established.\r"

Localized metastatic disease is best operated anteriorly. Primary malignancies are best treated with en bloc resection. Pain relief in metastatic disease is achieved by rigid stabilization. The unstable spine secondary to benign or malignant disease often requires stabilization for alleviation of pain; 132 stabilization procedures were performed in 100 patients. There were nine benign and 91 malignant tumors including 71 metastatic. Indications for stabilization were pathological fracture or following decompression. Anterior approaches including implant stabilization were used in those with metastatic disease limited to one to two levels or where significant kyphosis existed. Posterolateral decompression with Luque rod stabilization was indicated where disease was more widespread. In metastatic disease acrylic cement was used both anteriorly and posteriorly together with implant stabilization. Eighty-one percent had good to excellent relief of pain; 68 patients had neurological deficits. Significant neurological return was achieved in 40% of posterior decompressions and 71% of anterior decompressions in metastatic disease. All patients with benign tumors have solid fusions. In malignant disease the use of cement provided stability without loss of fixation in 87 of 91 procedures. Complications were 4% infection and failure of two Harrington rods without wiring, one Luque rod and two anterior constructs. The average longevity of patients treated for metastatic disease was 11.3 months.\r"

Etiological factors were, in descending order of frequency, distraction instrumentation with the lower end at the L5 or S1 vertebra, thoracolumbar junction kyphosis greater than 15 degrees, especially if associated with a hypokyphotic thoracic spine, and degenerative changes above and below a previous fusion. Kostuik-Harrington instrumentation was used anteriorly for the opening wedge and Dwyer cables and screws together with a midline plate were used posteriorly for the closing extension osteotomy. Malunion occurred in three patients, one requiring recorrection. Pain relief occurred in 48 (90%). Neurological complications occurred in two patients, one with permanent deficient. Follow-up averaged 4 years. Average preosteotomy lordosis L1-S1 was 21.5 degrees and was restored to 49 degrees (equal to the lordosis before the initial surgery) for an average correction of 29 degrees, (range 24 degrees to 63 degrees). Prevention of this complication can be accomplished by maintaining normal lordosis at the time of initial surgery.\r"

Reduction of the spinal fragment through kyphosis correction and distraction was evaluated using CT imaging. With kyphosis correction alone there was no decrease in canal compromise; in some cases there was a slight increase in canal compromise. Distraction, whether applied before or after kyphosis correction was the effective mechanism in reducing the fracture fragment. Kyphosis correction applied after distraction did not reduce the fragment further. Posterior devices that are used to treat burst fractures of the thoracolumbar spine with intracanal fragments should provide some form of distraction.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of a \"pure\" cyclic flexion bending moment on the three-dimensional load-displacement behavior of fresh ligamentous lumbar spine was investigated. The load-displacement behavior, for 11 L1-sacrum specimens, pre- and post-cyclic fatigue bending tests were quantified using a Selspot II system. A special fixture was designed to mount the specimen within the MTS system to administer \"pure\" cyclic flexion bending, under displacement control, for 5 hours. The testing was accomplished in a 100% humidity chamber at 0.5 Hz. The maximum cyclic bending moment, based on the literature dealing with loads experienced by the spine during activities involving lifting, was set at 3.0 Nm. An increase in motion of the order of 10% in the extension loading mode was observed. The increase in motion in other loading modes was not significant. In the extension loading mode, the increase in the anteroposterior displacement (retrodisplacement) in general was higher than the corresponding rotation component. The results suggest that the bending moment of low magnitude, usually experienced by the spine during activities of daily living, alone may not trigger the mechanical failure processes in the disc. The presence of high axial compressive loads on the disc seems to be the main contributing factor in this process. The presence of bending moments and axial twist along with axial compressive load may accelerate the unstable processes leading to low back pain.\r"

Five bipedal rats developed lumbosacral disc herniations, and the lumbar neural canal was significantly smaller in the bipedal population. There was no difference in radionuclide uptake between the two groups. Histochemical analysis of the psoas and multifidus muscles showed a significant shift from type I to type II fibers in the psoas and from type II to type I fibers in the multifidus in the bipedal population. These results indicate that upright posture places considerable stress on the lumbosacral spine and paravertebral muscles of the rat.\r"

Correlation was made between symptoms, straight leg raising, clinical neurological deficits, electrodiagnostic and CT findings. The radiation of pain above or below the knee and pain on straight leg raising did not show a high correlation with each other or with neurological deficits or CT findings. Electrodiagnostic studies often defined a radiculopathy in patients with equivocal clinical signs. CT findings did not predict the nature of symptoms or clinical and electrodiagnostic findings. Electrodiagnostic abnormalities showed the greatest ability to predict CT abnormalities. It is concluded that in chronic sciatica patients, no single diagnostic parameter is conclusive and a combination of clinical and laboratory findings is necessary to reach a diagnosis. In addition, many assumptions, valid in patients with acute pain cannot be extrapolated to patients with chronic sciatica.\r"

Information was available on each patient admitted to the program prior to his admission, at completion of the program, 6 weeks following completion of the program and 3 months following completion of the program. A telephone interview was carried out 2 1/2 years following the patient's discharge from the program. Linear regression analysis was used to identify the important independent variables with regard to the dependent variables of relief of back pain, return to work and increased activities at home. Demographic data were of no value as a predictor with the exception of age and returning to work. The patients over the age of 50 returned to work with much less frequency than those less than 50. Psychologic information from the MMPI and similar tests were of no value. The personal preadmission interview of a trained psychologist, however, was a good predictor of an individual's eventual return to work and overall improvement. Worker's Compensation and other litigation was a negative factor in a patient's prognosis. The treatment team's prognosis at the time of discharge from the program was the best overall predictor of a patient's chance of success or failure in the longterm.\r"

  ".W": "The use of colchicine for the treatment of low-back pain has been controversial; however, recent studies have shown its effectiveness when used intravenously. Studies using oral colchicine alone are lacking. The purpose of this study is to evaluate in a prospective, double-blind fashion the use of oral colchicine in the treatment of low back pain. Group I patients (15) were treated with a placebo capsule, and Group II (12) patients were treated with a colchicine capsule prescribed in a \"burst dose\" regimen. Patients were evaluated at 1, 2, 4, 6, and 12 weeks with a mean followup of 12 weeks. Parameters studied included patient characteristics, compliance, the McCoy pain drawings, pain analogue scales, the Million scale and objective tests. In terms of therapeutic response, the study shows no statistically significant difference between oral colchicine and placebo. The colchicine group did have an increased number of side effects.\r"

In contrast to the well-known hyperdynamic, low-resistance state of chronic cirrhosis, patients with the Budd-Chiari syndrome had normal cardiac index and systemic vascular resistance values before anesthesia and surgery. Opening the mesoatrial shunt produced a 46% (p less than 0.01) increase in cardiac index and a 38% (p less than 0.01) decrease in overall systemic vascular resistance. Right atrial pressure and pulmonary capillary wedge pressures were sharply increased--by 5.3 mm Hg and 4.7 mm Hg, respectively (p less than 0.01). A mathematical model was developed to assess the cause of the observed changes in systemic vascular resistance. The model suggests that the hemodynamic changes seen with shunt opening are unlikely to be the result of shunt effects alone and that dilatation of peripheral vascular beds is probable. Thus shunting converts the normal systemic vascular resistance and cardiac index of patients with the Budd-Chiari syndrome to the high-output, low-resistance state seen in patients with chronic cirrhosis. Although the physiology is complex, we conclude that the data are consistent with release, by the shunting process, of a systemic vasodilator.\r"

  ".W": "The cardiopulmonary effects of a third-degree scald burn involving the anterolateral chest wall was compared with a burn of equal size (30% of total body surface) to the flanks in anesthetized sheep with lung lymph fistulas. The chest-burn group was characterized by immediate decreases in cardiac output (6.5 to 3.0 L/min), central venous pressure (5 mm Hg to 0 mm Hg), pulmonary wedge pressure (10 mm Hg to 6 mm Hg), and urine output 1.5 ml/kg/hr to less than 0.5 ml/kg/hr. The temperature of pulmonary artery blood increased from 38 to 42 degrees C and plasma prostacyclin increased from 20 to 200 pg/ml. These changes were significantly different from those seen in the body sheep with burns. Initial fluid requirements necessary to restore filling pressures were 50% greater in the sheep with chest burns than in the sheep with body burns. An early decrease in static lung compliance was also seen after chest burn that was not the result of increased lung edema. A progressive decrease in compliance, urine output, and stroke output was also seen in the later postburn period (6 to 7 hours), which was significantly improved by a chest wall escharotomy. Postmortem analysis in the chest-burn group revealed a significantly increased malondialdehyde content, a reflection of increased oxygen radical-induced lipid peroxidation relative to the body burn. Pretreatment of the chest burn with ibuprofen, 12.5 mg/kg, prevented the initial vasodilator and lung compliance changes so that early cardiopulmonary status was identical to that seen with a body burn alone. Ibuprofen also decreased the lung tissue malondialdehyde content. We conclude that a burn involving the chest wall results in cardiopulmonary abnormalities, not seen after a body burn of a comparable size, which appear to be due to hyperthermia and an increased release of prostacyclin and O2 radicals.\r"

The cumulative survival rate of patients with fewer than 10 copies of N-myc (L group) was 73.7% 48 months after initiation of therapy, whereas the rate for those with more than 10 copies of N-myc (H group) was 0% by 20 months (P less than 0.000001). Clinical prognostic factors of neuroblastic tumors such as age, stage, histologic findings, and primary site correlated with the amplification of N-myc. N-myc amplification of more than 10 copies was evident in one of 16 (6.3%) patients less than 1 year of age and in 13 of 26 (50%) patients over 1 year of age and was detected in one of six tumors in stage II, four of 10 in stage III, seven of 16 in stage IV, and two of six in stage IV-S. The amplification occurred more frequently in patients with neuroblastoma than in those with ganglioneuroblastoma and was observed only in tumors of a suprarenal region. Preoperative chemotherapy was prescribed for 19 of the 26 patients with stage III or IV tumors and was similarly effective in both L and H groups. Ipsilateral nephrectomy or combined resection of a part of liver had to be performed in nine of 11 (82%) patients with stage III or IV tumors in the H group but in only one of 15 (6.7%) in the L group, thereby suggesting that the tumor with an amplified N-myc is more invasive. In patients in the advanced stage, total or nontotal resection of the tumor did not affect the survival in the L group, but the survival interval was prolonged significantly by the total removal of the tumor in patients in the H group. These data should aid in the surgical treatment of patients with poor-prognostic neuroblastoma and an amplified N-myc oncogene.\r"

Physiologic and metabolic parameters were monitored in the unanesthetized animals for 7 days, after which the gauze was removed and monitoring continued for another 5 days. Animals were then killed. Lung and liver tissue was inspected and analyzed for lipid peroxide content. Data were compared with those of six controls in which gauze was not implanted. We noted a transient significant increase (on day 1 only) in wound lymph, thromboxane B2, and 6-keto-PGF1 alpha from baseline values of 190 +/- 70 and 20 +/- 10 pg/ml to 1000 +/- 240 and 420 +/- 70 pg/ml, respectively. Plasma values were also significantly increased on day 1. Body temperature increased by 1 degree C and cardiac index increased by 30% during this period, whereas oxygen consumption, VO2, was not significantly increased. The VO2 and cardiac index increased by 50% over baseline, beginning on day 5, whereas systemic vascular resistance decreased. Body temperature was not increased. These changes corresponded with an increase in wound lymph monocyte count from 0% to 15% of total. The VO2 and cardiac index remained increased after gauze removal. No bacteria were found in the wound. Postmortem analysis revealed a marked monocyte-macrophage infiltration in both lung and liver. Lung water, represented as water content over dry weight, was normal. Lung and liver lipid peroxidation, measured by the by-product malondialdehyde content, increased 300% and 90% over control values, respectively. We conclude that a local, nonbacteria-induced wound inflammation increases VO2, with the increase not corresponding to increase in body temperature. Distant organ changes, namely, changes in lung and liver, were also evident 5 days after gauze removal.\r"

In portal hypertensive rats, histologic and ultrastructural evaluation demonstrated capillary endothelial abnormalities, arterialization of submucosal veins, and markedly greater severity of microvascular damage than in sham-operated controls.

Therefore we studied biliary total calcium [( Ca]) and free ionized calcium [( Ca++]) concentrations in 12 dogs before and after 6 weeks of a methionine-deficient, high-cholesterol diet. In all dogs pigment gallstones and sludge formed while the animals were on the diet. Although gallbladder function--as assessed by biliary pH, total bile salt, and bile electrolyte concentrations--was minimally altered by the diet, both [Ca] and [Ca++] increased significantly, from 10.16 +/- 0.19 to 13.16 +/- 0.57 mmol/L and 3.02 +/- 0.07 to 3.76 +/- 0.17 mmol/L, respectively. The observed increases in calcium concentrations, and specifically in [Ca++], early during stone formation in this model would increase the likelihood that bile would become saturated with at least one calcium salt and support the hypothesis that calcium is important in pigment gallstone formation.\r"

This study evaluated a thromboxane receptor blocker, BM 13.177, in a sheep endotoxin model. Sheep with chronic lung lymph fistulas were pretreated with the blocker before being given endotoxin. The blocker attenuated the early increase in pulmonary artery pressure usually seen after endotoxin (blocker + endotoxin, 31.0 +/- 14.5 mm Hg; endotoxin alone, 42.1 +/- 9.6 mm Hg). There was no effect on lymph flows during the later (permeability) phase (at 6 hours: blocker + endotoxin, 574 +/- 287% baseline; endotoxin alone, 311 +/- 102% baseline). Administration of the blocker alone increased pulmonary artery pressure, arterial pressure, and central venous pressure and decreased heart rate and cardiac index. Thromboxane receptor blockade presumably has little effect on elements of arachidonic acid metabolism other than thromboxane. Thromboxane appears to be important in the early pulmonary hypertension of the sheep endotoxin model but is relatively unimportant in the development of increased pulmonary capillary permeability.\r"

Immediate recanalization was achieved in 10 patients (45%) after urokinase therapy. In patients with successful recanalization, rapid amelioration of symptoms followed the restoration of blood flow. Thrombolytic recanalization was associated with reduction of neurologic deficits and of computed tomography-demonstrable infarction volume. The reduction of infarction volume and functional outcome correlated highly with the degree of reflow. Hemorrhagic transformation of infarction occurred in four patients and controllable extracranial bleeding in three patients.

  ".W": "Atherosclerosis in the circle of Willis and its major branches was studied prospectively in 198 men in the Honolulu Heart Program who were free of cardiovascular disease at the entry examination. The level of atherosclerosis was greater in the large arteries of the circle of Willis than in the small arteries, and autopsy-verified cerebral infarction was strongly associated with increasing severity of atherosclerosis in both. Analyses of the association of atherosclerosis scores with biologic and lifestyle characteristics measured at entry into the study indicated that atherosclerosis in the large arteries was consistently related to age, diastolic blood pressure, serum cholesterol, and height (inversely). Weak trends of association were also found with increasing serum glucose concentration, increasing cigarette use, and decreasing alcohol intake. Atherosclerosis scores in the small arteries were associated with diastolic blood pressure and serum triglyceride concentration. Analysis of dietary intake indicated that atherosclerosis scores were higher for men who reported low intakes of fat and animal protein and high intakes of vegetable protein and total carbohydrates. These patterns were consistent with similar findings on the incidence of clinical stroke in this cohort. Age-adjusted and -specific atherosclerosis scores from both the large and small arteries declined significantly during the period 1965-1983.\r"

In CT, the injection of contrast medium enhanced recent lesions in only four of the nine patients; furthermore, the effect was weak. In MRI, the injection of Gd-DTPA enhanced recent lesions in all patients except for one who was examined 4 weeks after ictus, and the effect was excellent. Recent infarcts could be identified only by Gd-DTPA-enhanced MRI in four of the nine patients. In patients with multiple small infarctions, identification of recent small infarcted lesions by CT or MRI is sometimes difficult; however, the use of Gd-DTPA in MRI makes it possible to distinguish recent infarcts from other lesions definitively.\r"

Liver dysfunction was more common among men than women due to differences in alcohol consumption. Number of thrombocytes and fibrinogen concentrations were lower, especially among men with elevated concentrations of glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase or glutamic pyruvic transaminase and/or elevated gamma-globulin fraction. Five of the 78 patients undergoing stereotactic hematoma aspiration and one of the 39 treated nonsurgically rebled. All six of the patients who rebled were men, heavy alcohol consumers with liver dysfunction. Fibrinogen concentration was abnormally low in four of the six and at the lower end of the normal range in one. Two showed thrombocytopenia and one case showed prolonged prothrombin time. These facts suggest that liver disorders produce a state in which hemorrhage occurs more readily and that this hemorrhagic tendency may be one of the causal factors of spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage.\r"

The right common carotid artery of rats was photothrombosed using a dye/light insult. Rats were given the photosensitizing dye rose bengal and irradiated for 4 minutes with an argon laser beam focused onto the exposed common carotid artery. During the irradiation, 3 ml of blood was taken from the right external carotid artery. After 10 minutes, the blood was infused into the external carotid artery of a recipient rat that had received horseradish peroxidase. Fifteen minutes after blood infusion, bilateral peroxidase extravasation was noted within cortical and subcortical areas of recipient rats, being most intense ipsilaterally. Ultrastructural studies demonstrated peroxidase reaction product within numerous endothelial vesicles of arteriolar segments. Infusion of blood from control rats did not produce similar changes. Thus, photoinduced vascular thrombosis of a large feeding artery leads to the formation of blood-borne factors that acutely alter cerebral vascular permeability.\r"

A single intracisternal injection of endotoxin provoked the reaction, and affected rats manifested neurologic deficits accompanied by pathologic lesions. Brainstem infarcts developed in only a small proportion of rats without recognized risk factors after intracisternal injection of endotoxin. Thus, stroke risk factors, which are ordinarily regarded as operating through acceleration of atherosclerosis, may predispose to brain ischemia by local effects on brain microcirculation such as those thought to underlie preparation of a tissue for the local Shwartzman reaction.\r"

  ".U": "88265222\r", 
  ".W": "Our study describes the anatomy of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) in 65 Sprague-Dawley rats and the spatial distribution of ischemic cortical lesions caused by occluding major MCA branches. The rats characteristically had at least two major MCA branches, frontal and parietal. Many rats had additional branches supplying the pyriform and temporal cortexes. Permanent occlusion of the frontal or parietal branches combined with 30 minutes of bilateral carotid artery occlusion produced visible Evans blue dye uptake by ischemic cortical areas after 24 hours. No lesions distal to the occlusion were apparent in 38% and 43% of rats with frontal and parietal branch occlusions, respectively; small lesions contiguous with the occlusion site were observed in 38% and 32% of the rats. Only 6% of the frontal and 7% of the parietal branch occlusions produced isolated distal infarcts as expected if these branches were end-arteries. Blood flow was reversed in arteries distal to the occlusion. We conclude that extensive collateral connections of the frontal and parietal MCA branches with other arterial systems protect the anterior and posterior cortical regions. In contrast, occlusions of the pyriform branch of the MCA invariably caused infarcts in the frontopyriform region. In about one third of the rats, frontal or parietal branch occlusions produced lesions involving much of the proximal MCA territory; the frontopyriform region was most consistently affected. Combined, these data suggest that the pyriform MCA branch is an end-artery and that the cortical region it supplies is prone to ischemic damage resulting from any reduction of blood flow through the main MCA trunk.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Cerebral blood flow was significantly decreased in both the subarachnoid hemorrhage and sham hemorrhage rats 3 hours after injection. However, blood flow returned to control levels by 24 hours, and measurement for 14 days after subarachnoid hemorrhage failed to show any delayed decrease in cerebral blood flow. Electron microscopic studies of basilar arteries from rats subjected to subarachnoid hemorrhage 72 hours before killing failed to show any of the morphologic changes that have been associated with vasospasm in humans or in higher animal models. Our studies indicate that the rat model of subarachnoid hemorrhage has limited applicability to the study of subarachnoid hemorrhage following ruptured cerebral aneurysms in humans. However, although rats are not a perfect model of this clinical condition, some pathophysiologic changes similar to those observed in human subarachnoid hemorrhage have been demonstrated in this model and deserve further investigation.\r"

The mean +/- SEM ATP content was 0.38 +/- 0.02 mumol/g wet wt in control rabbit basilar arteries (n = 6). The ATP content decreased significantly to 0.17 +/- 0.02 mumol/g wet wt 2 days after experimental subarachnoid hemorrhage (n = 6), although only a slight decrease was detected in the basilar arteries 2 days after cisternal injection of the same amount of artificial cerebrospinal fluid. Hypoxia significantly decreased ATP content in the control basilar arteries to 0.26 +/- 0.04 mumol/g wet wt (n = 6). The same degree of hypoxia did not decrease ATP content in the basilar arteries after subarachnoid hemorrhage. Release of L-lactate was significantly higher from the arteries after subarachnoid hemorrhage than from the control arteries under both aerobic and hypoxic conditions. Our results indicate that subarachnoid hemorrhage induced an alteration of metabolic rates in rabbit cerebral arteries. The oxygen-requiring pathways to synthesize ATP may be important in control cerebral arteries; however, after experimental subarachnoid hemorrhage, the main pathway in the cerebral arteries may shift from oxygen-requiring pathways to an anaerobic glycolytic pathway.\r"

I tested the existence of an adenylate cyclase-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) system for dilating the arterioles by topically applying the following drugs: cAMP (10(-3) M), its more potent analogue dibutyryl cAMP (10(-3) and 10(-4) M), and forskolin (10(-6) M). Forskolin activates endogenous adenylate cyclase, which leads to increases in endogenous cAMP. Each drug was applied for 30 seconds; all three produced dilation. I then applied either cAMP or forskolin in the presence or absence of 10(-4) M isobutylmethylxanthine (IMX), an inhibitor of endogenous phosphodiesterase, which destroys cAMP. The presence of IMX significantly potentiated the dilation produced by exogenous cAMP and forskolin. These data indicate that cerebral surface arterioles of mice respond to cAMP with dilation and contain the enzymes for producing and inactivating this dilator. The existence of an adenylate cyclase-cAMP dilating mechanism in pial arterioles does not rule out the simultaneous existence of other dilating mechanisms.\r"

Isometric tension of common carotid artery ring segments was measured. With a resting tension of 2.0 g determined from the baseline tension-contraction curves, precontraction was induced by 10(-5) M 5-hydroxytryptamine and endothelium-dependent relaxation was measured by application of either acetylcholine or adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP). Mean arterial blood pressure was 73.1 +/- 3.0 mm Hg in WKY and 110.0 +/- 3.1 mm Hg in SHR. These baseline values were significantly different. Acetylcholine-induced maximal relaxations were 70.1 +/- 2.6% of the 5-hydroxytryptamine-induced contraction in young WKY, 45.6 +/- 2.1% in old WKY, 35.1 +/- 1.8% in young SHR, and 21.4 +/- 2.5% in old SHR. On the other hand, ATP-induced relaxations were 52.0 +/- 3.2%, 35.7 +/- 3.8%, 21.7 +/- 3.5%, and 17.0 +/- 1.8% in the groups, respectively. Acetylcholine-induced relaxations were significantly different between WKY and SHR, young and old, independently. On the other hand, ATP-induced relaxations were also significantly different between young and old WKY, although no significant difference was observed between young and old SHR. The fact that endothelium-dependent relaxation of a cephalic artery is impaired in old rats and in hypertensive rats suggests that aging and hypertension are risk factors that may augment the disturbance of the cerebral circulation in pathologic conditions.\r"

  ".W": "From 2 hours to 23 days following experimental subarachnoid hemorrhage, the accumulation of indium-111-labeled platelets on the intimal surface of the middle cerebral artery was studied in 23 cats. Subarachnoid hemorrhage was produced by transorbital rupture of the right middle cerebral artery. Of the 23 cats, 17 exhibited right middle cerebral artery/left middle cerebral artery radioactivity ratios of greater than 1.25. When these results were compared with those of 12 control cats, 0.001 less than p less than 0.005 (chi2 test). Thus, the results from the control and experimental groups are significantly different and indicate early (after 2 hours) preferential accumulation of intimal platelets in the ruptured right middle cerebral artery compared with the unruptured left middle cerebral artery and new platelet deposition continuing for up to 23 days. However, the experimental group did not reveal a clear pattern for platelet accumulation following subarachnoid hemorrhage. There was no simple correlation between the magnitude of the radioactivity ratios and the time after hemorrhage when the cats were killed although the ratios for 2 hours to 7 days seemed greater than those for 8 to 23 days. Assuming the pivotal role of platelets in the angiopathy of subarachnoid hemorrhage, the administration of antiplatelet agents as soon as possible following its occurrence may be of value.\r"

This therapy was combined with monitoring of intracranial pressure and intermittent drainage of cerebrospinal fluid to further control intracranial pressure elevations. Thrombus and coagulopathy resolved with pentobarbital alone in one patient and after pentobarbital plus heparin therapy in the second patient. It is suggested that cases of severe distal sagittal sinus thrombosis with brain hemorrhage and intracranial hypertension may benefit from combined pentobarbital coma and intraventricular drainage. This allows for stabilization of bleeding tendencies before instituting heparin therapy when necessary. Management of sagittal sinus thrombosis with barbiturates or ventricular drainage is best performed in an intensive care unit environment with continuous monitoring of intracranial pressure and substantial electrophysiologic and neuroradiologic support.\r"

HIV seroprevalence among white donors (2/10,000 donations) was less than that among Hispanic (9/10,000; p less than 0.0001) and black donors (31/10,000; p less than 0.0001). Of 152 seropositive men interviewed, 77 percent reported sexual contact with men; of this latter group, 53 percent were bisexual. Fifteen (44%) of 34 seropositive women had apparently acquired infection from heterosexual contact, and an equal number denied having any known risk factors for HIV infection. Educational efforts must address women and bisexual men who do not perceive themselves to be at risk for HIV infection and should be specifically designed for the mores of different racial and ethnic groups.\r"

In addition, the effect of heparin or citrate anticoagulation of blood on the recovery of factor VIII (FVIII) in plasma, cryoprecipitate, and a FVIII concentrate was assessed. Citrated plasma from placebo (CP) or DDAVP-treated donors (CD) contained 1103 +/- 73 and 1470 +/- 141 units per liter of FVIII, respectively (p less than 0.01), whereas the heparinized plasma from placebo (HP) or DDAVP-treated donors (HD) contained 1328 +/- 130 (p less than 0.01) and 2023 +/- 358 units per liter (p less than 0.01), respectively. The FVIII could be recovered in both cryoprecipitate and cold-reprecipitated cryoprecipitate (CRC) fractions. DDAVP treatment improved FVIII recovery by 41 percent in the concentrate from citrated plasma (p less than 0.01) and by 127 percent in that from heparinized plasma (p less than 0.01).

Side effects caused by synthetic materials have led to the use of biologic adhesives; however, they carry the risk of transmission of infectious disease if they are prepared from pooled human blood. A procedure for the production of an autologous fibrinogen-based adhesive using polyethylene glycol to precipitate the fibrinogen-factor XIII component from plasma is described. This procedure requires 40 ml of whole blood and approximately 3 hours' preparation time, and it can be performed in any blood bank with the facilities for sterile techniques. This adhesive has been used successfully for otologic surgery in 12 patients, and further study of the use of this biologic adhesive for other microsurgical techniques should be undertaken.\r"

The same samples were then tested with immunofluorescence and 51Cr-release assays. Seven of eight patients (87.5%) tested positive for drug-dependent antibodies by the rosette assay. In contrast, two of eight (25.0%) and one of eight (12.5%) patients tested positive for drug-dependent antibodies by immunofluorescence and 51Cr release, respectively. These results demonstrate that the new rosette method is significantly more sensitive and specific for the detection of drug-dependent platelet antibodies than either immunofluorescence or 51Cr release.\r"

She did not respond to pooled random-donor platelets but recovered following a single plasma exchange. Her platelets were PlA1 negative, and her plasma contained potent anti-PlA1. In 1986, her sister (never transfused, gravida III, para III) developed PTP (platelet counts 5-15,000/microliter) following surgery-associated transfusion. She did not respond to pooled random-donor platelets. Platelet-associated IgG was markedly elevated (5365) molecules/platelet; normal, less than 660); her plasma contained a potent platelet antibody with anti-PlA1 specificity. Her platelets were subsequently shown to be PlA1 negative. The platelet count did not rise above 30,000 per microliter, despite 3 days of high-dose methylprednisolone sodium succinate and 2 weeks of prednisone (80 mg/day). Later, her platelet count increased and remained normal after steroids were discontinued. The two sisters proved to be HLA-identical, and each possessed one haplotype carrying the DR3 marker, which has been implicated as a risk factor in neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia associated with anti-PlA1.\r"

One sample failed to react with A1 red cells (RBCs) in immediate-spin (IS) tests, had anti-A and -B titers of 8192 and 2048, respectively, by indirect antiglobulin technique (IAT), and was from a diabetic patient; the parenteral administration of A substance present in porcine insulin is a possible cause of hyperimmunity in this case. The second sample was from the recipient of a single unit of group B fresh-frozen plasma; the serum anti-A and -B titers were 10,240 by IAT, but only weak reactions with A1 and B RBCs were noted in routine IS reverse typing tests; the hyperimmunity in the patient concerned was likely due to crossreacting anti-A, B stimulated by B-active glycoproteins and/or glycolipids in the transfused plasma. The third serum also had anti-A and anti-B IAT titers of 10,240 but did not react with A1 and B RBCs by IS; the hyperimmunity in this case may be related to sepsis from intestinal flora carrying A- and/or B-like antigens. These antibodies lysed A1 and/or B RBCs in tests incubated at room temperature (RT) and strongly agglutinated those RBCs by IS when diluted 10-fold with saline. The absence of the prozone phenomenon in tests with RBCs suspended in diluents containing EDTA is consistent with the previously published mechanism for anti-A prozone: namely, the steric hindrance of agglutination by the C1 component of human complement.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Since recruitment and/or recycling of FMLP receptors is required for normal CTX, the hypothesis that stored PMN might have abnormal FMLP receptor cycling was tested. The effect of storage on the proportion of high- and low-affinity FMLP receptors was also investigated. Units of PMN were tested within 4 hours of collection and after 24 and 48 hours of storage at 22 degrees C, unagitated, in 150-ml transfer packs. In comparison to fresh PMN, there was no alteration in the Kd of the high-affinity FMLP receptor of PMN stored for 24 to 48 hours; however, the Kd of the low-affinity receptor increased (fresh PMN = 36 +/- 5 nM; 24 hours = 107 +/- 19; 48 hours = 121 +/- 22; p less than 0.01 for both 24 and 48 h versus fresh PMN). Likewise, while the number of high-affinity receptors increased (fresh PMN = 25,000 +/- 6,000 receptors/PMN; 24 hours = 95,000 +/- 21,000; 48 hours = 161,000 +/- 40,000; p less than 0.01 for both 24 and 48 hours versus fresh PMN).

This study was designed to determine the effect of irradiation on neutrophil aggregation, chemotaxis, and superoxide generation. Purified neutrophils were irradiated with a Cesium source at four doses ranging from 0 to 17,500 rads. Formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (FMLP) and zymosan-treated serum (ZTS) cytotaxin-induced chemotaxis and migration were determined in the agarose assay. Neutrophil aggregation to FMLP was determined by aggregometry. Superoxide generation and random migration were not affected by irradiation at doses up to 17,500 rads. When compared to nonirradiated controls, the chemotactic response to ZTS remained normal, with an insignificant decline from 174 +/- 31.0 to 150 +/- 42.3 (mean +/- SD) units. The chemotactic response to FMLP declined insignificantly, from 228 +/- 31.3 at 0 rad to 207 +/- 26.4 at 17,500 rads. The aggregation response to FMLP remained within the normal range but declined from 0.78 +/- 0.11 to 0.61 +/- 0.18. At the radiation doses currently used to reduce the risk of transfusion-related GVHD, neutrophil superoxide generation and chemotactic response remain essentially normal.\r"

Because of F68's reported impairment of granulocyte function, it was hypothesized that F68 was also responsible for the cytotoxicity of ABS, possibly as a result of a separable fraction of the F68, separation of which could be achieved using supercritical fluid fractionation (SFF). SFF employs gases, such as carbon dioxide, under high pressure to dissolve the parent compound, a process that is followed by step-by-step precipitation and recovery of the dissolved material. The toxicity of F68 to human and animal cells was investigated by culturing Hela and B16 cells in the presence or absence of F68. Cells were grown for 4 days, harvested, and counted. Hela and B16 growth were markedly inhibited by F68. Four lots of F68 at 20 mg per ml inhibited Hela growth by 54 +/- 10 percent (p less than 0.05). In four dose-response experiments, three lots of F68 caused 50 percent inhibition of cell growth at 25 +/- 17 mg per ml. Four lots of F68 were also processed by SFF. Hela cells were grown in the presence of control media, parent (unextracted) F68, the early fractions of SFF extraction (XT), and the residual (partially purified) (RES F68). All parent F68, XT, and RES F68 were at 20 mg per ml. In 11 studies, the XT were 77 +/- 25 percent more toxic than the parent F68 (p less than 0.02), and the RES F68 were 30 +/- 11 percent less toxic than parent F68 (p less than 0.02).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

This study evaluated these filters as to their production of white cell-poor platelets. Pools of random-donor platelet concentrates were filtered. Prefiltration and postfiltration samples were evaluated for percentages of platelet recovery, white cell (WBC) removal, and platelet function. The two filter solutions tested were normal-strength saline (NSS) and fresh-frozen plasma (FFP). Postfiltration samples using NSS showed no measurable platelet aggregation with ADP, epinephrine, or collagen. However, with FFP, both filters showed 100 percent platelet aggregation with ADP, epinephrine, and collagen. The FFP filter solution provided excellent white cell removal in both filters (Imugard: 100% WBC removal or less than 1.0 X 10(6) residual WBC; Erypur: 99.5% removal or greater than 1.0 X 10(7) residual WBC); however, platelet recovery was better with Imugard (95%) than with Erypur (55%). The filtration procedure is an excellent method for the preparation of white cell-poor platelets; however, the quantity of the saline solution recommended for the filtering of red cells must be minimized for platelets.\r"

  ".W": "The pathogenesis of renal cell injury is a complex interplay among derangements in subcellular membrane function and mediators of injurious processes. Plasma and subcellular membrane injury and the resulting membrane dysfunction appear especially important. As detailed previously in this report, Cs, an extremely lipophilic compound, has the ability to bind to renal brush border membranes, interact with mitochondrial membranes resulting in multiple sites of dysfunction, and accumulate in high concentrations in renal proximal tubule cells. In spite of these interactions, Cs could not be shown to be directly toxic in vitro to proximal tubule cells. Thus, from these experiments, it is difficult to conclude that Cs-induced acute renal failure observed in vivo is due to a direct tubular toxic effect, even though Cs has the capability to interact with critical renal membranes at low concentrations. The majority of present evidence, therefore, does not suggest a toxic effect of Cs on renal epithelial cells. Instead, the acute effect of Cs to produce a decline in renal excretory function appears to be due to a fall in renal blood flow. On the other hand, the chronic effect of Cs to produce a decline in renal excretory function appears to be due to an effect of this agent to induce interstitial fibrosis. In this regard, recent findings summarized in this report demonstrate that Cs produces (over ten days) a higher than normal collagen content, as measured by hydroxyproline levels, in the kidney. In addition, this increase in collagen content with Cs treatment was associated with a significant increase in proliferation of cells in the renal interstitium, as determined by 3H-thymidine incorporation into DNA. This increase in DNA incorporation after Cs was not observed in other organs, including liver, spleen, or heart. Histologic assessment of these proliferating cells revealed them to be mononuclear. Cell surface markers also demonstrated an increase in LCA positive cells in the renal interstitium. These results, therefore, suggest a readily demonstrable effect of Cs on the renal interstitium. The relationship between Cs dosage and interstitial cell proliferation as well as the relationship between Cs-induced renal perfusion alterations and this interstitial proliferative process mandates further investigation.\r"

  ".W": "A two-stage technique for implantation of an inflatable penile prosthesis has been developed for patients undergoing radical pelvic cancer surgery. Over the past five years, this method has been utilized in 147 men undergoing radical cystectomies or prostatectomies. The technique involves implanting the reservoir and pump of the prosthesis at the time of the radical cancer operation when the lateral neurovascular bundles of erection are being sacrificed. The reservoir and pump are permanently connected, and the cylinder tubings from the pump are temporarily connected and placed in the subcutaneous tissue overlying the pubis. During a second procedure, usually six to twelve weeks later, the cylinders are implanted infrapubically and connected to the easily located pump tubing. The advantages are several. (1) The pump and reservoir are easily implanted during the pelvic surgery while importantly not adding significantly to the operative time or morbidity of the primary procedure. (2) The reservoir is easily positioned in the pelvis. (3) The scrotum with its contained pump already will be healed when the entire prosthesis is connected, bypassing the initial scrotal pain and edema. (4) Psychologically the patients feel relieved that their erectile dysfunction is being treated immediately. This two-stage technique appears to maximize the gain of early and easy implantation while minimizing the potential problems of concomitant surgery.\r"

  ".W": "Twenty-three men who underwent radical cystoprostatectomy between March 1, 1983, and October 1, 1986, were found to have not only multifocal carcinoma in situ (CIS) of the bladder but also transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) of the prostatic ducts. In 18 patients TCC was limited to the epithelium lining the prostatic ducts (CIS of prostatic ducts), but in 5 patients TCC also invaded the prostatic stroma (invasive TCC of prostatic ducts). During follow-up (mean, 26 months), in 2 of the 18 patients (11%) with CIS of the prostatic ducts metastases developed. By comparison, metastatic TCC developed in 5 of 5 patients (100%) who had invasion into the prostatic stroma. Evidence indicates that patients with multifocal CIS of the bladder should be evaluated very closely for the presence of TCC of the prostatic ducts. When TCC is present in the ducts, radical cystoprostatectomy is necessary to control this lesion before it progresses to invasion. When invasion has occurred, however, radical cystoprostatectomy alone is not sufficient therapy. Since metastatic TCC develops in 100 percent of these patients, we believe that chemotherapy (either adjuvant or neoadjuvant) should be used in addition to radical cystoprostatectomy.\r"

The positive reactions were seen to tests with the patients' own urine, but also, although less frequently, to tests with foreign urine as well. Immediate reactions (type I reactions; prick tests, scratch patch tests, and 20-minute patch tests) were not observed. The clinical morphology and the histology of the positive patch tests suggest a toxic rather than an allergic reaction, although the latter could not be totally excluded. The positive skin reactions may be relevant in the pathogenesis of interstitial cystitis suggesting a mucosal hyperreactivity to some component of urine.\r"

On retrospective analysis, 18 patients (90%) had muscle-invasive bladder cancer at their initial presentation. The interval between onset of symptoms and histologic documentation of cancer was less than two months in 14 cases (78%), and in the remaining 22 per cent, the intervals of six, six, twelve, and twenty-four months were attributable to delay in seeking medical attention or delay in biopsy. In contrast, in the 2 patients who had presented with superficial tumors, the intervals were thirteen and one hundred eighty months. It therefore appeared that most patients with invasive bladder cancer had no therapeutically significant prior clinical or symptomatic history of superficial disease, and that invasion either was already present when symptoms had begun, or occurred rapidly after symptoms had initially appeared. These findings confirm the broad applicability of this pattern of bladder cancer in the general population, thereby complementing similar findings reported in recent years by secondary referral centers.\r"

To increase reproducibility of the pad-weighing test by minimizing the influence of variation in urine load the test was done with a standardized bladder volume (50% of the cystometric bladder capacity). Twenty-five female patients with stress or mixed incontinence underwent two separate tests. Test-retest results were highly correlated (r = 0.97, p less than 0.001). Nonetheless, analysis of test-retest differences revealed a variation up to +/- 24 g between two tests. It is concluded that this setup (i.e., standardized bladder volume) of the one-hour pad-weighing test allows for a more reliable assessment of urinary incontinence for quantitative purposes.\r"

  ".W": "Eleven moderately obese women, aged 46-62 years, with a body mass index of 29-34 and with borderline hypertension (repeated diastolic blood pressure greater than 90 mmHg) fasted for 48 hours. Before the fast and after 48 hours of fasting, plasma noradrenaline, urinary noradrenaline, urine potassium, urine sodium and weight were measured. In six of the patients muscle nerve sympathetic activity was recorded from the peroneal nerve by tungsten microelectrodes for 15 min each time. The efferent muscle sympathetic activity (MSA) was expressed as the number of bursts/min. The recordings were done before the fast and after 48 hours of fasting. We found significant decreases in body weight from 88.4 +/- 2.5 kg to 86.4 +/- 2.5 kg. Systolic blood pressure (BP) was reduced from 158 +/- 3 mmHg to 146 +/- 5 mmHg (p less than 0.001) and diastolic BP from 96 +/- 3 mmHg to 89 +/- 3 mmHg (p less than 0.01) during the fast. MSA was significantly increased from 42.0 +/- 5.5 bursts/min to 44.5 +/- 5.8 (n = 6), while plasma and urine noradrenaline concentrations (n = 11) showed a non-significant tendency to increase. We conclude that the hypotensive response during the first days of extensive caloric reduction is not due to a decreased sympathetic activity. If anything, there may be weak increase of efferent sympathetic nerve activity and venous plasma levels of circulating noradrenaline. The mechanisms behind the acute hypotensive response to negative caloric balance are thus still unclear, but obviously different from long-term adaptation of the blood pressure.\r"

Cod liver oil induced an increase in serum high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol in men from the inland. Both groups showed a prolonged primary bleeding time, whereas platelet aggregation and thromboxane A2 production induced by collagen were mainly unaffected. Platelet phospholipid fatty acids showed similar changes in both groups with a decrease in n-6 and an increase in n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids. No changes were observed in total cholesterol or platelet phospholipid content. This study shows that dietary supplement with cod liver oil induces changes in serum lipids and platelets that may reduce the tendency to thrombosis both in subjects with a low and in those with a high intake of dietary fish. The effects were more pronounced in the subjects with a traditionally low fish consumption.\r"

In order to be defined as a good diet responder, at least 20% reduction of the initial serum triglyceride concentration was required. At the end of the study, half of the participants (7 men and 3 women) met the criteria of good diet responders. All of these showed an improved fibrinolytic response to DDAVP injection, and 7 out of 10 had a normalized fibrinolytic response to venous occlusion. We conclude that, through dietary measures with substantial reduction of hypertriglyceridaemia, it is possible to improve and even normalize the fibrinolytic potential.\r"

So did muscle fat in men (p less than 0.01), while muscle tissue potassium was decreased in both obese men (p less than 0.001) and obese women (p less than 0.05). The skeletal muscle Na/K-ratio tended to be higher in obese men (p less than 0.1) but was not related to body weight in women. Skeletal muscle magnesium was higher (p less than 0.01) in obese men than in lean men. No differences between lean and obese women were found. Obese men had higher diastolic blood pressure (p less than 0.05) than lean men, while there was no difference between obese and lean women. Compared with lean subjects, obese subjects thus had lower relative skeletal muscle mass and men, especially, had more fat and less potassium in the skeletal muscle.\r"

Bronchial asthma was present in three patients, and severe lung emphysema in one. These four patients had an abnormal lung function, mainly of obstructive type. There was a statistically significant difference between the remaining 21 PBC patients without chronic obstructive lung disease and the reference subjects with respect to diffusion capacity. Almost all abnormal lung function data were found in the symptomatic PBC patients (i.e. symptoms of pruritus, xanthoma, xanthelasmata, jaundice, hyperpigmentation, hepatosplenomegaly), 13 out of 18 (72%), whereas only one out of seven asymptomatic patients was affected. Nine patients (36%) had reduced diffusion capacity compared with none of the reference subjects.

Left ventricular ejection fraction, peak oxygen consumption during a progressive maximal exercise test and resting plasma norepinephrine concentration were identified as the strongest univariate predictors of prognosis. Examination of their interaction was accomplished by stratifying each variable into quartiles and then pooling quartiles for bivariate analysis. The data demonstrate that ejection fraction has the most profound effect on survival calculated from maximal oxygen consumption and norepinephrine concentration, but that each of the variables provides additional independent prognostic information when added to survival estimated from any of the other variables. Therefore, ventricular function, exercise tolerance and sympathetic nervous system activation appear to provide independent insight into the prognosis of patients with heart failure.\r"

Plasma, erythrocyte, and urinary Se and activities of glutathione peroxidase (GSH Px) in plasma, erythrocytes, and platelets were measured before intervention and after 5, 15, 30, 45, and 60 d. A placebo was given to six adults. Plasma and urinary Se were the most sensitive indices to Se exposure. Se in plasma increased steadily during the course of the study whereas urinary Se reached a plateau between 30 and 60 d. By contrast erythrocyte Se did only change after 45 d. Enzyme in plasma and erythrocytes did not respond whereas platelet GSH Px did. The plateau of activity that was observed after 15 d for plasma Se in the range 1.40-1.50 mumol/L could mean that the Se status is insufficient for an optimal function of GSH Px and implies that dietary intake in Belgium (less than 50-60 micrograms Se/d) is not adequate.\r"

Patients with severe alcoholic hepatitis had the lowest intake of nonalcohol calories and protein. Women with chronic pancreatitis had ingested alcohol for a shorter period of time than men whereas women with alcoholic hepatitis and cirrhosis had ingested less alcohol per kilogram body weight per day as compared with men. This study does not support the hypothesis that consumption of a high-protein and high-fat diet is a factor in the development of chronic pancreatitis in the alcoholic patient. The increased susceptibility of women as compared with men to alcoholic liver disease is established.\r"

Blood levels were determined for total carotenoids, vitamin A, vitamin D, vitamin E, vitamin C, riboflavin, thiamin, vitamin B-6, zinc, copper, selenium, and magnesium. Subjects were grouped into quintiles for each nutrient. Logistic regression was used to estimate the odds ratios (ORs) for cataract among subjects in the highest quintile and the middle three quintiles relative to subjects in the lowest quintile. ORs were adjusted for age, sex, race, and presence of diabetes. Results suggest that risk of cortical cataract was reduced for subjects in the highest quintile of vitamin D and total carotenoids and that persons with cataract may have lower levels of vitamin C and higher levels of vitamin B-6 and Se.\r"

Fiber intakes were calculated from neutral detergent fiber (NDF) and Southgate total dietary fiber values. IL subjects (n = 7) consumed on average 9.0 +/- 1.6 g NDF and 18.8 +/- 4.6 g total fiber daily. The NH menu provided a similar amount of NDF but more total fiber. NH residents (n = 6) consumed approximately 70-85% of the fiber served. When fiber intakes were expressed as energy, NH and IL subjects consumed similar amounts of NDF but IL subjects consumed less total fiber. Grain products were major fiber sources for both groups; IL subjects consumed more fiber from fruits. Comparisons of fiber intakes, bowel function, lifestyles, and medications suggest that dietary fiber is only part of the basis for inadequate large bowel function experienced by some elderly populations.\r"

Body composition was determined from densitometry. Phase angles for the trunk (phi t), leg (phi 1), and whole body (phi w) had significant (p less than 0.05) negative correlations with percent body fat (%BF) in each sex, and positive correlations with fat-free mass (FFM) in males. In multiple regression analyses, phi t was associated significantly with %BF after controlling for age, mean skinfold thickness, and weight/stature2 in each sex. Bioelectric phase angle for the trunk may be useful for predicting %BF in clinical and survey research.\r"

Representative values have been derived from literature data for density and water content of maternal fat-free mass throughout pregnancy. Using these values we developed a method that provides new equations for estimating fat mass from body density or total body water for any desired stage of pregnancy. The validity of the new equations based on body density is discussed using data on body weight and body density obtained from a longitudinal study on well-nourished Dutch pregnant women. Because the new equations result in more valid estimates of maternal body fat mass, we suggest that they be used in studies on energy balance in pregnancy.\r"

RMR increased slightly during lactation in spite of a decrease in fat-free body weight 2 and 6 mo postpartum. Energy intake increased during lactation (280 +/- 440 kcal/d).

During the intervention period they consumed an isocaloric diet containing approximately 25% of energy as fat and approximately 60% as carbohydrate. Total plasma triglyceride and cholesterol levels decreased significantly after 45 and 90 d of treatment (p less than 0.01). The reduction of plasma cholesterol was associated mostly with the decrease in VLDL cholesterol (p less than 0.01) while LDL cholesterol increased at days 45 and 90 of the LFHC diet (p less than 0.01). Finally, we observed a significant increase in HDL cholesterol both at days 45 and 90 of the LFHC diet (p less than 0.01).

The major finding was that in the nondieters MCT at all doses was followed by a significantly decreased caloric intake in the lunch. Dieters were unresponsive to the type of dietary fat and tended to eat the same number of calories regardless of the preload.

Mean values for predictions of FFM from S2/Z or from the product of total muscle conductive volume and the density of FFM were not significantly different from means of FFM estimated from body density by underwater weighing. This analysis demonstrates that an estimate of FFM can be obtained by summing the conductive muscle volumes of each body segment derived from the corresponding segment lengths squared, measures of bioelectric impedance, and mean muscle-specific resistivities.

A very significant increase in water and Na absorption occurred in rats with diarrhea when they were perfused with a 90-mmol/L-Na, 111-mmol/L-glucose OHS containing 30 mmol/L of L-alanine (Ala). The same effect on Na retention was observed with a protein hydrolysate (PrH) in rats with diarrhea. Glycine was not effective. Other experimental OHS were ineffective in rats with diarrhea.
