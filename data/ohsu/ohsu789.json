Thirty-five (38%) of the 93 respondents were pregnant during their residency. Seventeen complications occurred in 14 (36%) of the 39 pregnancies. Of the 17 complications, 6 (35%) were serious enough to require hospitalization. Complications resulted in time lost from work in 40% (15/39) of the pregnancies. When asked to describe the experience of being pregnant during residency, only 24% felt that it was \"pleasant,\" while 52% said the experience was \"tolerable\" and 24% found it \"miserable\"! Thirty-seven percent (13/35) stated that they would not get pregnant during residency if they had it to do over again.\r"

We hypothesized that the heavy work load of pregnant pediatric residents is tolerated because those who have experienced a residency themselves underestimate the strain of residency compared with other work. A questionnaire, designed to survey pediatricians' attitudes concerning the effects of employment on the fetus, mother, and newborn infant, was produced in two formats, which were identical except that one concerned residents, while the other concerned women employed full-time in other jobs. Each type of questionnaire was sent to 1000 randomly selected members of the American Academy of Pediatrics. Respondents in both groups shared many attitudes concerning the effects of maternal employment. Certain subgroups (eg, males, those married to spouses not employed, and those women not pregnant in residency) judged employment as more harmful in general. Contrary to the original hypothesis, however, all subgroups consistently judged residency as more deleterious than other work. Training programs need to adopt humane strategies to integrate motherhood with residency.\r"

All were intentional self-poisonings. Agents involved most often were psychotherapeutic drugs, cathartics, and/or analgesics. Potentially life-threatening drugs were often implicated in the poisoning. Diagnosis was complicated by purposefully deceptive information from patients and the presence of unsuspected toxins. Treatment was complicated by long delays to presentation for medical care and by underlying metabolic abnormalities. Decontamination efforts were complicated by the patients' prior use of emetics and cathartics. Seventeen patients required hospitalization; 4 patients suffered a complicated hospital course and a fifth patient died.\r"

Hypoplasminogenemia with normal (adult) levels of alpha 2-plasmin inhibitor and plasminogen activator inhibitor are characteristic of the newborn's lytic system. This combination suggests that the newborn may have an impaired lytic system that may explain, in part, the thrombotic events that are frequently observed. Histidine-rich glycoprotein (HRG), another fibrinolytic inhibitor, retards fibrinolysis by interfering with plasminogen's binding to fibrin. Levels of HRG have been reported to be reduced in term newborns. This finding has not been studied recently and to our knowledge, there are no reports of HRG levels in premature infants. The purpose of this study was to measure the plasma levels of HRG and plasminogen in three groups of patients: normal adults (n = 48), normal term newborns (n = 43), and normal premature newborns (n = 18). The protein levels were determined by electroimmunoassay. Cross-immunoelectrophoresis was also performed for HRG. Cord blood was employed for obtaining newborn citrated plasma. The newborns had significantly lower plasminogen and HRG levels when compared with those of the adults. Also, the HRG levels of the premature newborns were lower than those of the term newborns. In conclusion, the newborns had lower levels of HRG than adults, with premature newborns having the lowest levels. This may allow for more plasminogen to be available for fibrin binding even though newborns have hypoplasminogenemia.\r"

As a symptom, diarrhea has been described as an increase in stool frequency, an increase in stool volume, and/or a decrease in stool consistency. As a sign, diarrhea is characterized by an increase in stool water excretion to greater than 150 to 200 ml every 24 hours. Four mechanisms that may be responsible for the alterations in fluid and electrolyte movement associated with diarrhea are increased luminal osmolality, decreased fluid absorption, increased intestinal secretion, and altered intestinal motility. Specific pathogenic mechanisms for acute infectious diarrhea include tissue invasion, enterotoxin production, and adhesion of infectious agents to epithelial cells. Antidiarrheal agents remove secretagogues from the intestinal tract, stimulate fluid absorption, and inhibit electrolyte movement.\r"

  ".W": "Because there are approximately 100 over-the-counter (OTC) products available for self-treatment of acute diarrhea, it is difficult for consumers or even pharmacists and physicians to be sure which products are both safe and effective. Until Congress expanded the authority of the Food and Drug Administration in 1962, manufacturers only had to prove that their products were safe. Unfortunately, a majority of OTC products that are now available were on the market before 1962. To eliminate all noneffective products, the Food and Drug Administration established a three-phase OTC drug review process. The ultimate goal of this process is to ensure that all OTC medications are safe and effective and carry full and informative labeling. In 1975, the Advisory Review Panel on OTC Laxative, Antidiarrheal, Emetic, and Antiemetic Drug Products published its recommendations on which OTC antidiarrheal ingredients were both safe and effective [Antidiarrheal drug products for over-the-counter human use: proposed monograph. Federal Register 1975; 40: 12902-12944]. After consideration of these recommendations, public comment, and presented new evidence, the Food and Drug Administration published its preliminary safe and effective ingredient listing [Antidiarrheal drug products for over-the-counter human use: tentative final monograph. Federal Register 1986; 51 (83): 16138-16149]. At this time, only three ingredients fulfill both requirements: attapulgite, polycarbophil, and loperamide. The Food and Drug Administration's final decision (to be reported in a monograph) is still forthcoming. Upon publication of this monograph, only antidiarrheal products that contain ingredients in this listing will be allowed to be marketed.\r"

In addition, if the physician determines that the patient is not suffering from diarrheal dehydration, indicated by dry mouth, excessive thirst (or for children, inadequate fluid intake), wrinkled skin, little or no urination, dizziness, or lightheadedness, the physician may also allow the patient to be treated without an office visit. If, however, the patient is experiencing any of these symptoms, an office visit is required to facilitate further evaluation by the physician.\r"

Obese patients enrolled in a protein-sparing, calorically restricted diet were monitored over a 3-month period with in vitro examination of mitogen- and antigen-induced lymphocyte blastogenesis. The sera from these patients were evaluated for effects on neutrophil chemotaxis, phagocytosis and microbial killing. Significant changes in body weight, triglycerides and glucose occurred during the diet, and most patients exhibited urinary ketosis. The diet was associated with increased blastogenesis in unstimulated cultures and in varicella and candida antigen-stimulated cultures, but blastogenesis was unchanged for phytohemagglutinin, concanavalin A, SK-SD and histoplasma. In assays of serum effects on neutrophil function, patients with urinary ketosis had depression of chemotaxis and microbial killing but not phagocytosis when compared to baseline or nonketotic patients. This study indicates that long-term caloric restriction is associated with significant effects on in vitro lymphocyte stimulation and with significant serum effects on normal neutrophil function.\r"

Indicators of disease severity were: extent of chest roentgenographic infiltrate, serum lactic dehydrogenase activity, alveolar-arterial oxygen tension difference, and total blood lymphocyte count. All patients with sputum negative for Pneumocystis underwent bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage. Sputum analysis was 71% sensitive and 100% specific for the diagnosis of PCP. The negative predictive value of sputum analysis was 48%. There was no relationship between sputum results and the severity of PCP. This study led to the conclusions that sputum analysis is a sensitive, specific, rapid, and low-cost technique for the diagnosis of PCP, and that the sensitivity of sputum analysis for the detection of PCP is not affected by the severity of PCP.\r"

After 1 to 6 days, rats were killed and RNA was extracted from heart or gastrocnemius muscle by acid guanidinium-phenol-chloroform extraction. RNA underwent agarose electrophoresis, transfer to nitrocellulose, and hybridization with [32P]-cDNA probes specific to mRNA coding for alpha cardiac (alpha c) actin, alpha skeletal (alpha sk) actin, beta (beta) actin, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (G3PD). Results showed that alpha c actin mRNA levels in heart extracts were lowest at day 3 after injection, with a 60% decrease at 8 mg/kg ADR. beta actin and G3PD mRNAs decreased 28% and 21%, respectively. In gastrocnemius muscle extracts, both alpha sk actin and G3PD mRNAs decreased 30%. Results suggest a selective effect of ADR on depressing alpha c actin mRNA in the rat heart.

Previously we demonstrated biologic activity for TGF-beta in supernatants of fresh Hodgkin's disease (HD) cell cultures and the cell line L428 derived from nodular sclerosing HD. This study was undertaken to find evidence of TGF-beta activity directly in tissues affected by HD. Formalin-fixed tissue from 14 patients with HD, including 8 nodular sclerosis, 4 mixed cellularity, 1 lymphocyte predominance, and 1 lymphocyte depletion type were studied by immunoperoxidase technique with antibody CC (1-30) raised against a synthetic polypeptide with the same N-terminal amino acid sequence as TGF-beta 1. Transforming growth factor beta activity was demonstrated in six cases of nodular sclerosis but not in other histologic types of HD. Staining for TGF-beta was found in the cytoplasm of Reed-Sternberg (RS) cells in one case and on the surface of RS cells and their lacunar variants in five cases. Transforming growth factor beta activity associated with the extracellular matrix was localized mainly around blood vessels, zones of necrosis, at the margins of bands of collagen sclerosis, and in areas containing syncytia of RS cells. In two cases TGF-beta was associated with collections of epithelioid histiocytes or granulomas. Small lymphocytes, granulocytes, and germinal center cells were unreactive. These results suggest that TGF-beta is a growth factor of biologic importance in HD and may be responsible for many of the histologic features, such as nodular sclerosis and granulomas, that may have prognostic significance.\r"

In this paper we provide evidence by two independent techniques that antibody L26 recognizes an intracellular epitope on the CD20 antigen (a pan B-cell marker). When this antigen was redistributed on the surface of unfixed viable B cells by incubation with monoclonal anti-CD20 followed by anti-mouse Ig, the diffuse cytoplasmic staining of L26 was abolished and replaced by coincident dotlike labeling for antibody L26 and the CD20 antigen. None of the other antibodies tested (covering 10 different B-cell-associated antigens) had this effect on the L26 staining pattern. Furthermore, COS-1 cells transfected with cDNA encoding the CD20 molecule gave positive staining with antibody L26 and with two other CD20 reagents, but not with antibodies to other pan B-cell markers (eg, CD19 and CD22).\r"

However, strong immunoreactivity was observed with rabbit antiserum raised against a low molecular weight purified amyloid subunit isolated from one of the patients. This immunoreactivity was abolished by absorption with the low molecular weight amyloid fraction. The amino terminal sequence of the amyloid protein subunit was homologous to gelsolin, an actin-modulating protein, and the amyloid deposits in tissues reacted with a monoclonal antibody against gelsolin. These studies show that the amyloid protein in familial amyloidosis, Finnish type, is not related to previously identified forms of amyloid, including prealbumin (transthyretin) variants, but represents a novel amyloidogenic protein related to gelsolin, a plasma and cytoplasmic protein.\r"

Large full-thickness skin wounds made on the backs of these mice exhibited significant delays in the entry of inflammatory cells into the wound, the formation of granulation tissue, and in wound closure when compared to their nondiabetic littermates. Recombinant human platelet-derived growth factor (rPDGF-BB, 1 or 10 micrograms), recombinant human basic fibroblast growth factor (rbFGF, 1 micrograms), or combinations of both were applied topically to the wounds for 5 to 14 days after wounding. Diabetic mouse wounds treated with rPDGF-BB or rbFGF had many more fibroblasts and capillaries in the wound bed at 10 and 21 days than did wounds treated with the vehicle alone. The animals treated with growth factors also had significantly greater wound closure at 21 days than those treated with the vehicle. Combinations of rPDGF-BB and rbFGF improved all parameters of healing but not to a greater extent than either growth factor alone. The effectiveness of rPDGF-BB and rbFGF suggest that recombinant growth factors may be useful in the treatment of patients with deficient wound repair.\r"

  ".W": "Studies were performed to characterize the effects of both acute and chronic exposure to epidermal growth factor (EGF) on collagen biosynthesis by NRK52E cells, an epithelioid line established from normal rat kidney. Both conditions of exposure to EGF stimulated cell growth. Qualitative analysis revealed that NRK52E cells continued to synthesize types I, III, IV, and V collagens under all circumstances. However, both acute and chronic exposure to EGF increased two- to fourfold the amounts of collagenous proteins secreted by NRK52E cells, but decreased by 40 to 80% the amounts of collagenous material derived from the cell layers. Quantitative evaluation of type I and type III molecules confirmed that both conditions of exposure to EGF resulted in substantial increases in the amounts of these types of collagen secreted by the cells. However, analysis of the cell-associated types I and III molecules revealed that, while prolonged exposure to EGF significantly decreased the production of both types of collagen, acute exposure minimally affected type I collagen levels, but decreased type III production greater than 40%. Thus, conditions of acute exposure resulted in a slight increase in the total amount of type I collagen produced, but a slight decrease in the amount of type III collagen synthesized. In contrast, chronic exposure to EGF decreased the total amount of both collagen types synthesized, with type III being decreased to a greater extent (approximately 70%) than was type I (approximately 50%). Thus, the ratio of type III to type I collagen produced by NRK52E cells was decreased under both conditions of exposure to EGF. Therefore, these studies establish that EGF can modify matrix production in an epithelioid line of renal origin.\r"

  ".W": "High inspired oxygen concentrations during the neonatal period profoundly inhibit rat lung development, an effect that is partly reversed during recovery in air. Persistent effects of neonatal hyperoxia on the size and number of alveoli or the structure of pulmonary capillaries have not been well defined. Using light and electron microscopic morphometry plus quantitative three-dimensional reconstructions of alveoli, we examined the lungs of 40-day-old rats that were exposed to more than 95% oxygen for the first 7 days after birth. Neonatal hyperoxia administered to rats resulted in abnormally enlarged air spaces at age 40 days. The fraction of the lung consisting of parenchyma was significantly increased and alveolar surface area was 13% lower than controls. There was an abnormal enlargement of alveolar ducts, which reduced by 24% the relative amount of air in the alveoli, compared to that in the alveolar ducts. The number of alveoli per lung and the mean volume of an alveolus were not different between the groups, but alveolar size class distributions were different, with significantly more very small and very large alveoli in 40-day-old rats after neonatal hyperoxia. By scanning electron microscopy, the alveolar surface of the exposed animals had a corrugated appearance, which was especially evident along alveolar ducts. Transmission electron microscopy revealed a greater density of capillaries, particularly in the alveolar regions close to terminal airways. Based on a random sample of the entire parenchymal region, capillary blood volume per cm2 of alveolar basal lamina was 18% greater. The results demonstrate that neonatal exposure to hyperoxia can cause abnormalities in the pulmonary alveolar and capillary structure of 40-day-old rats, and that these changes are similar to some features of broncho-pulmonary dysplasia.\r"

The appearance of laminin cleavage fragments was then detected by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Treatment of supernatants with diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP), anti-human neutrophil elastase (HNE), and anti-human neutrophil cathepsin G (HNCG) IgGs effectively blocked the degradation of laminin. In contrast, treatment of supernatants with EDTA failed to inhibit laminin digestion, indicating that neutrophil metalloproteinases had little laminin-degrading activity. In additional experiments, laminin was incubated with purified HNE and HNCG. Both enzymes extensively cleaved laminin in a dose- and time-dependent manner yielding similar products, but HNE was generally more potent. Immunofluorescence microscopy of cryostat sections of mouse kidney treated with HNE or HNCG also showed widespread loss of laminin epitopes from basement membranes. The proteolytic degradation of laminin by neutrophil elastase and cathepsin G indicates an important role for these enzymes in basement membrane damage during inflammation.\r"

All-trans retinoic acid (retinoic acid) stimulated proliferation in KGM but did not further stimulate growth in Ca2(+)-supplemented KGM. The ability of retinoic acid to stimulate proliferation was inhibited in KGM prepared without Ca2+ or prepared with 0.03 mmol/l Ca2+ and in KGM treated with 1 mmol/l ethylene-glycol-bis-(beta-aminoethyl ether)N,N'-tetra acetic acid. Using 45Ca2+ to measure Ca2+ influx and efflux, it was found that retinoic acid minimally increased Ca2+ uptake into fibroblasts. In contrast, retinoic acid treatment of fibroblasts that had been pre-equilibrated for 1 day with 45Ca2+ inhibited release of intracellular Ca2+ into the extracellular fluid. Retinoic acid also stimulated 35S-methionine incorporation into trichloroacetic acid-precipitable material but in contrast to its effect on proliferation, stimulation of 35S-methionine incorporation occurred in both high-Ca2+ and low-Ca2+ medium. These data indicate that retinoic acid stimulation of proliferation, but not protein synthesis, is dependent on the concentration of Ca2+ in the extracellular environment.\r"

One hundred microliters of saline or 10 units of PLA2 suspended in saline was given as a bolus injection into either the trachea or jugular vein. Intratracheal pressure and mean arterial blood pressure were continuously monitored. The lungs were examined by light and transmission electron microscopy at 1, 10, and 30 minutes after administration. Pulmonary morphologic and physiologic changes were only observed in animals that received PLA2 via the trachea. Significant increases in peak intratracheal pressure occurred as early as 1 minute after intratracheal PLA2 administration. Morphologic evidence of airway constriction, accompanied by blebbing of the apical cytoplasm of airway epithelium, was also observed at this time. A transient increase in mean arterial blood pressure occurred 5 minutes after challenge. At 10 minutes after intratracheal PLA2, there was marked swelling of airway epithelial cells, pronounced blebbing of the apical cytoplasm, and a resultant decrease in size of the airway lumen. Morphologic changes in alveolar cell populations were initially observed 10 minutes after intratracheal PLA2. Interalveolar septa were hypercellular and multifocally thickened. There was prominent perivascular edema and alveolar spaces contained abundant proteinaceous material and occasional hemorrhage. Ultrastructurally, there was marked cell swelling and fragmentation of type I alveolar epithelium resulting in a denuded basal lamina. Sequestration of neutrophils and eosinophils, many of which lacked secretory granules, within alveolar capillaries was accompanied by aggregates of platelets and was observed in close proximity to injured endothelium. Morphologic changes indicative of cell injury were also observed in type II alveolar epithelium. Similar, but more frequent and severe, morphologic injury occurred 30 minutes after intratracheal PLA2. It is concluded that PLA2 induces pronounced morphologic and physiologic changes in the guinea pig and that the route of administration is important in the development of PLA2-induced lung injury.\r"

This was confirmed by analysis of unfixed, frozen material in one patient. Both patients had disseminated disease without organ dysfunction and were treated with prednisone. Currently, they are without signs of disease activity after 1 and 10 years. DNA histograms were normal from a patient who died from disseminated disease and from two patients with disseminated disease who experienced several relapses and various chemotherapeutical regimens. The histograms were also normal in lesions from four patients with unifocal bone involvement. Our results show that DNA aneuploidy occurs in LCH lesions in the pediatric age group. Further investigation is necessary to reveal whether DNA aneuploidy is restricted to disseminated LCH or its presence has any value in predicting the course and outcome of the disease.\r"

  ".W": "Primary choroid plexus (CP) tumors are rare neoplasms that present in childhood or, less frequently, in adult life. The majority are benign and amenable to complete surgical excision, but occasionally more invasive variants are encountered. Although generally pathologically distinct, occasionally primary CP neoplasms may be difficult to distinguish from metastatic papillary carcinomas or papillary ependymomas. Conventional cytologic markers are not sufficiently specific to permit accurate diagnosis of primary CP tumors. The authors have reported that the CP is the unique site of synthesis within the brain of transthyretin (TTR, prealbumin), a transport protein for thyroxine and retinol. They therefore investigated the utility of TTR as a biochemical marker for CP tumors. They detected intense immunoreactivity for TTR at high dilutions of primary antiserum in the neoplastic epithelium of all of nine primary CP tumors (six papillomas and three carcinomas), but not in eight cellular or three papillary intracerebral ependymomas, meningiomas, oligodendrogliomas, astrocytomas, primary extracerebral papillary carcinomas (three thyroid, two breast) or five of six cerebral metastases from systemic papillary carcinomas. In one case of cerebral metastasis from papillary thyroid carcinoma, rare isolated immunoreactive cells were observed. Faint staining of the stromal-ependymal junction was seen in myxopapillary ependymomas of the filum terminale, which were otherwise nonreactive. By in situ hybridization, TTR mRNA was abundant in neoplastic CP epithelium, confirming local TTR synthesis. The authors conclude that TTR is synthesized by neoplastic CP epithelium and is an excellent marker for primary CP neoplasms.\r"

  ".W": "Autonomic dysfunction is an increasingly recognized problem in aging animals and man. The pathologic changes that produce autonomic dysfunction in human aging are largely unknown; however, in experimental animal models specific pathologic changes have been found in selected sympathetic ganglia. To address whether similar neuropathologic changes occur in aging humans, the authors have examined paravertebral and prevertebral sympathetic ganglia from a series of 56 adult autopsied nondiabetic patients. They found significant, specific, age-related neuropathologic lesions in the prevertebral sympathetic superior mesenteric ganglia of autopsied patients. Markedly swollen dystrophic preterminal axons compressed or displaced the perikarya of principal sympathetic neurons. Ultrastructurally, these swollen presynaptic axons contained abundant disoriented neurofilaments surrounded by peripherally marginated dense core vesicles. Immunohistochemical studies demonstrated that dystrophic axons contained tyrosine hydroxylase and neuropeptide tyrosine (NPY)-like immunoreactivity but not other neuropeptides (VIP, substance P, gastrin-releasing peptide [GRP]/bombesin, met-enkephalin). Similar to the animal models of aging, lesions were much more frequent in the prevertebral superior mesenteric ganglia than in the paravertebral superior cervical ganglia. These studies demonstrate anatomic, peptidergic, and pathologic specificity in the aging human nervous system similar in many respects to that which the authors have described in experimental animal models. Neuroaxonal dystrophy in the sympathetic nervous system may underlie poorly understood alterations in clinical autonomic nervous system function that develop with age.\r"

  ".W": "Diabetic nephropathy is a major cause of the increased morbidity and mortality in insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. The most significant renal lesion of diabetic nephropathy is expansion of the glomerular mesangium. Thickening of the glomerular basement membrance is also apparent. Mesangial expansion is largely due to the accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins such as fibronectin, laminin, and type IV collagen. To determine whether high glucose is responsible for the observed increase in mesangial cell ECM protein accumulation, mesangial cells were grown in tissue culture medium containing 10 mmol/l (millimolar) glucose (normal) or 30 mmol/l glucose (high). The degree of ECM protein accumulation was determined by immunocytochemistry and a solid-phase enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) developed in the laboratory. Mesangial cells cultured for 1 week contained fibronectin as the most abundant ECM protein, followed by laminin and type IV collagen. Type IV collagen was seen only after the cells had piled up into 'hillocks' (approximately 4 weeks of continuous growth without passaging). After 4 weeks in 30 mmol/l glucose, mesangial cells contained increased amounts of all three matrix proteins. Fibronectin and laminin were increased by approximately 60%, while type IV collagen was increased 50%. Cells subcultured in medium containing 30 mmol/l glucose for 8 months displayed a twofold increase in fibronectin and laminin. Thus, high glucose per se can cause changes in mesangial cell ECM. This cell culture model should be useful in elucidating the mechanisms involved.\r"

  ".W": "Peripheral sensory nerve abnormalities were investigated in long-term streptozotocin diabetic rats using quantitative analysis. To determine whether the characteristic structural changes occur with a proximodistal gradient, three levels of the sensory peripheral nervous system were investigated: the postganglionic segment of the dorsal root, the midportion of the sciatic nerve, and the distal sural nerve. Reduction of myelinated fiber size due to reduced axonal caliber was the most characteristic change at both proximal and distal levels of the peripheral nerve. The relationship between axonal size and myelin spiral length indicated a more severe axonal atrophy in the distal portion. The axonal atrophy was related to a proportional loss of axonal neurofilaments at proximal levels, whereas in the distal sural nerve the loss of neurofilaments exceeded that which would be expected for axonal size. The universal reduction of axonal size in diabetic nerve may be accounted for by impaired supply of neurofilaments or reduced neurofilament synthesis. Such cytoskeletal defects may, in turn, lead to distal axonal degeneration or contribute to the susceptibility of diabetic nerve to various external noxi, including ischemia and hypoglycemia.\r"

  ".W": "To investigate the effects of protracted low-density lipoprotein (LDL) exposure on endothelial cell (EC) epoxyeicosatrienoic acid (EET) generation, human umbilical vein ECs were incubated in atherogenic concentrations of LDL (240 mg cholesterol per deciliter) (LDL-EC). After 4 days' incubation with LDL, EC were stimulated with human thrombin in the presence of 1-[14C]-arachidonic acid. Substantially more EET products were generated by LDL-ECs than by cells not exposed to high levels of LDL (C-EC). Thrombin stimulation caused LDL-EC to produce five- to eightfold more in 14,15-EET, 11,12-EET, 8,9-EET, and 5,6-EET, with 14,15-EET as the major product. This is the first demonstration, to date, that EETs can be induced in EC. Metapyrone (SKF-525A) markedly inhibited EC EET generation, indicating a role for the cytochrome P-450 enzyme system in human EC arachidonic acid metabolism. One EET product, 14,15-EET, has been found to be chemotactic and to promote adhesion of U937 cells, a human monocytic lymphoma cell line, to EC. Thus, protracted exposure to atherogenic LDL concentrations increases the generation of chemotactic and adhesion factors (ie, 14,15-EET) after thrombin stimulation, possibly through the cytochrome P-450 enzyme system.\r"

  ".W": "In the course of immunohistochemical characterization of murine monoclonal antibodies recognizing the human high molecular weight-melanoma associated antigen (HMW-MAA), a striking reactivity with blood vessels in the tumor stroma was noted. Immunocytochemical analysis by light and electronmicroscopy of a panel of tissues and cell lines showed that the staining of microvessels by anti-HMW-MAA monoclonal antibodies was restricted to pericytes. Correspondingly, anti-HMW-MAA monoclonal antibodies were found to react with cultured pericytes from human brain, but not with endothelial cells in serologic assays, and to immunoprecipitate from biosynthetically labeled pericytes an antigen with the characteristic structural profile of HMW-MAA. At the subcellular level, the expression of HMW-MAA in cultured pericytes was mainly restricted to microspikes that are localized in clusters on the cellular membrane. Staining by anti-HMW-MAA monoclonal antibodies of pericytes was not only found in the tumor stroma, but also in other lesions associated with angiogenesis, such as granulation tissue of wound healing and synovitis. In these lesions, microvascular staining for another marker of pericytes, ie, alpha-smooth muscle actin, also was observed. These results suggest that, in conditions associated with vascular proliferation, 1) pericytes acquire HMW-MAA and 2) the number of pericytes may be increased as compared with normal tissues.\r"

  ".W": "The early and late effects of short-term immobilization on arthritic joints have been studied. Knee joints of mice in which an antigen-induced unilateral arthritis was elicited were immobilized in extension for 3, 5, and 7 days. After 5 and 7 days' immobilization, arthritis was significantly more severe. More leukocytes infiltrated the periarticular tissues and more cellular exudate was found in the joint space. A striking observation was that large numbers of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) attached to the surface of the cartilage, a phenomenon not found in mobile arthritic joints. Electron-microscopy confirmed PMN adhesion and showed severe ruffling of the cartilage surface under immobilized conditions. Further examination of factors determining PMN sticking revealed that attachment is rapid when the cartilage surface is already damaged, and that retained immune complexes and complement play a pivotal role. The late effects of immobilization were studied after a remobilization period of 2 weeks. Enhanced matrix depletion and chondrocyte death persisted in arthritic joints that were previously immobilized for 5 and 7 days, and the latter also showed significantly increased osteophyte formation. Although these results are speculative for the human situation, this study indicates that treatment of arthritic joints by complete rest should be applied with caution.\r"

None of the 16 thymomas contained evidence of the EBV genome, even though we could detect EBV by Southern blotting when EBV DNA represents less than or equal to 1% of the total DNA and by polymerase chain reaction when a single EBV-positive cell is present among 10(5) EBV-negative cells. These results fail to demonstrate EBV genome in western thymomas and stand in contrast to those of McGuire et al (Am J Pathol 1988, 131:385) who previously reported that the EBV genome is present in thymomas occurring in southern Chinese patients. Therefore EBV does not appear to be implicated in the pathogenesis of all thymomas. The presence of EBV in eastern thymomas, regions where EBV is endemic may be due to epidemiologic factors and/or genetic predispositions.\r"

DNA and protein synthesis, incorporation of 3H-glucosamine and 3H-fucose into macromolecules, occurred in the myointima during incubation in vitro in the absence of fetal bovine serum, and with the exception of 3H-glucosamine, failed to be stimulated by it.

  ".W": "Physician payment reform has assumed a prominent place in the national health policy debate. A key component in this debate is the Harvard Resource-Based Relative Value Scale (RBRVS). The Harvard research effort relied upon several necessary methodologic assumptions and compromises that must be understood to appreciate the RBRVS's strengths and weaknesses. For example, the Harvard group surveyed too few cases to cover the range of clinical practice in a specialty, had too little input in the selection of cases that were judged to be the same or equivalent between specialties, and used an unproven extrapolation methodology to assign final values for total work to non-surveyed physician services. This methodology led to a number of anomalies in the final RBRVS, such as values for comprehensive services for some specialties that were lower for new than for established patients, and total work values for many new patient office services that were lower for Internal Medicine than for Family Practice, a finding inconsistent with empiric evidence. The Harvard RBRVS represents a significant contribution that increases our understanding of physician practice. The system should not be viewed as a finished product. Further investigation and explanation of the assumptions and anomalies are needed to construct a system that reflects adequately the complexity in physician work.\r"

We have demonstrated that the relative resource costs of providing physician services can be defined and measured in a rational and systematic way and that the results are reliable and valid. Consequently, the RBRVS is a viable basis for national payment policy and could be used for establishing a national fee schedule for physician services or to identify \"mispriced\" physician procedures. Since the release of the final report of the first phase of the Harvard RBRVS study in September of 1988, there has been extensive review, discussion, and criticism of the RBRVS. Dr. Laurence F. McMahon, Jr., in the accompanying article, provides a further critique of our research. In this paper, we review the RBRVS study and results and respond to the major criticisms that have been raised by Dr. McMahon and others. We then describe the tasks we are currently undertaking to expand and validate our research and address the important criticisms and limitations.\r"

Twenty-four of the 55 patients had been treated previously with ciprofloxacin, and 26 had an identifiable risk factor for a nosocomial infection. MRSA was a contributing factor in at least five of the 21 deaths. MRSA resistance to ciprofloxacin was detected within three months of the drug's commercial availability, apparently emerged independently at a number of the health care facilities, and has become widespread. If such resistance is found in a health care facility, ciprofloxacin may not be useful as a first line antibiotic.\r"

We defined the Level II (intermediate) and Level I (normal newborn) facilities using published criteria. Infants under 2000 gm born in Level III facilities had half the risk of perinatal death compared to those born in a Level I or II facility. No significant improvement was noted among level or volume groupings for normal birthweight infants. A loglinear regression model of hospital perinatal death rates showed that when birthweight and maternal risk were controlled, obstetrical volume added minimal explanatory power to level of nursery care.\r"

The development of a Health Information Office facilitated the collection of demographic and vital statistics data, administration of a disease surveillance system, regular monitoring of hospital and outpatient discharge diagnoses, and investigation of disease outbreaks. This office also organized community health education campaigns and disease control efforts. Examples of specific disease investigations are provided to demonstrate the utility of epidemiologic surveillance in the control of infectious disease. We conclude that simple epidemiologic methods play an important role in health planning in long-term refugee camps.\r"

Eight different descriptions of the sex, race, and sexual preference of the hypothetical patient were distributed randomly among the physicians, one description to each physician. The physicians were asked to decide whether to maintain confidentiality, notify the health department, or inform the patient's partner. Responses of 199 White male physicians were analyzed using an unconditional saturated logistic regression model. The odds ratios for these physicians saying they would send the patient's antibody status to the health department extend from 18.4 (95 percent confidence interval: 1.3, 260.1) for Black homosexual males to .5 (95 percent CI: 0, 11.5) for White homosexual females. The odds ratios for White male physicians saying they would inform the patient's partner range from 7.5 (95 percent CI: .8, 69.2) for Black heterosexual males to 1.0 (reference category) for Black homosexual females. The results suggest that when physicians decide to protect a third party by breaching an HIV-infected patient's confidentiality, their decision may be influenced in some cases by the race, sex, and sexual preference of the patient.\r"

Sociodemographic and clinical data as well as information on medical utilization were obtained from review of inpatient and outpatient hospital records. The yearly inpatient cost per patient decreased by 28 percent from $38,369 in year one to $27,714 in year two. These changes were related to shorter lengths of stay (from 20.6 days to 16.8 days per hospitalization, mean difference of 3.8 days, 95% CI of the difference -.2, 7.8), and less costly hospitalizations (from $12,463 to $9,957, mean difference of $2,506, 95% CI of the difference $135, $4,877). The probability of hospitalization, however, was similar in both years. These patterns of care were still evident after controlling for transmission category, race, site, mortality, insurance, age, gender, number and type of opportunistic diseases and time since diagnosis. Although the cost per patient per year decreased between years one and two, median survival increased by 70 percent (from 10 to 17 months). Hence overall estimated lifetime costs increased by 24 percent.\r"

Surveillance for human infections caused by B.t.-k among Lane County, Oregon residents was conducted during two seasons of aerial B.t.-k spraying for gypsy moth control. Bacillus isolates from cultures obtained for routine clinical purposes were tested for presence of Bacillus thuringiensis (B.t.). Detailed clinical information was obtained for all B.t.-positive patients. About 80,000 people lived in the first year's spray area, and 40,000 in the second year's area. A total of 55 B.t.-positive cultures were identified. The cultures had been taken from 18 different body sites or fluids. Fifty-two (95 percent) of the B.t. isolates were assessed to be probable contaminants and not the cause of clinical illness. For three patients, B.t. could neither be ruled in nor out as a pathogen. Each of these three B.t.-positive patients had preexisting medical problems. The level of risk for B.t.-k and other existing or future microbial pesticides in immunocompromised hosts deserves further study.\r"

To determine reasons for this increase, we conducted a case-control study in the metropolitan sexually transmitted diseases clinic during 1987 and 1988. Cocaine use (odds ratio [OR] 3.1; 95% confidence interval [95% CI] = 1.5, 6.5 among men; OR 5.8; 95% CI = 1.5, 33 among women) and exchange of drugs for sex (OR 3.5; 95% CI = 1.4, 8.7 among men) were risk factors for syphilis. Although cocaine users reported more sexual partners and more frequently reported sex with prostitutes, cocaine use remained a risk factor after adjustment for these behaviors. These data suggest that sexual behavior or another factor, such as availability or utilization of health care, among cocaine users leads to increased risk of syphilis in this population. Increases in cocaine use may be partly responsible for recent increases in syphilis incidence in the United States.\r"

Among men, this incidence is over 10 times greater for Blacks and four times greater for Hispanics than for Whites. The pattern of distribution of heterosexually acquired AIDS parallels the distribution of other heterosexually transmitted diseases, which are also more frequent in Black and Hispanic inner-city populations. Drug use, exchange of sex for drugs or money, and early onset of sexual activity in adolescents are increasingly associated with heterosexually transmitted infections and are likely to be very important in heterosexual transmission of HIV in inner-city US populations.\r"

A high number of transfers in the summer of 1986 diminished only slightly in summer 1987 (following implementation of COBRA). Far greater reductions occurred in summer 1988, when overcrowding forced our hospital to refuse most transfers. In contrast to changes in hospital policy, COBRA alone had little effect in this area.\r"

The time from the patient's arrival in the intensive care unit to passage of the first flatus in patients who received fentanyl anaesthesia was significantly longer than in those who received morphine (p less than 0.05). There was a significant relationship between the time to first flatus and the total dose of fentanyl, but no such relationship could be demonstrated for morphine.

Only two patients required general anaesthesia for the planned surgery. Assessment of the dermatomes blocked did not demonstrate a statistical difference between the success rates of the three groups. The more nerves detected in the paraesthesia and the nerve stimulator groups before injection of local anaesthetic the higher the success rate of the block. We advocate use of the nerve stimulator technique in view of the possible risk of neurological damage associated with paraesthesia and the technical difficulties with the catheter technique, for routine brachial plexus blockade.\r"

A simple inhalational anaesthetic technique was used; opioids and muscle relaxants were seldom given. Negative pressure ventilation was employed in the postoperative period when appropriate, and was combined with vigorous chest physiotherapy. There were three peri-operative deaths, but the overall death rate in the patients who underwent surgery was no greater throughout the study period than in those who did not require surgery.

  ".W": "A new methodology for assessment of severity of stenosis employing color Doppler imaging and relying upon spatial and temporal studies of aortic and mitral stenotic jets is described. The spatial study consisted of the detection of the jet origin with respect to upstream and downstream trajectories in the long-axis view, with further identification of each of the three levels from characteristics single-gated Doppler flow recordings, when desired. For the temporal study, color images were gated in midsystole for aortic, and in early diastole for mitral, stenosis. The final step consisted of imaging the jet cross-sectional area in the short-axis view with planimetry. Measurements were compared with those obtained by the Gorlin formula. The procedure was feasible in 43 of 48 studied cases and the correlation between hemodynamic and color Doppler data was satisfactory for both valvular lesions. The best agreement between both methods was for severe stenoses, where the standard error of estimate was the lowest. For large areas the variance in measurements was wider and the correlation coefficient decreased, but this did not cause errors in recognition. This new method provides a convenient and rapid visualization of stenotic jets and is particularly recommended for assessment of severe stenoses, where accuracy was highest for all clinical conditions.\r"

The LA TAC was generated from gated blood pool images using phase and amplitude images. The configuration of normal LA TAC was M shaped. The first peak and last peak of LA TAC were represented as points B and D, respectively. In addition, the trough following B was named point C. The presence and severity of MR was analyzed by use of three methods: (1) analysis of LA TAC, (2) analysis of left ventricular TAC, and (3) measurement of the stroke count ratio of left ventricle to right ventricle. In the diagnosis of MR using RNV, the rapid emptying fraction [REF:(B-C)/(B-A)] of LA TAC was the most sensitive index compared with the other two methods. The sensitivity and specificity of MR with Sellers' II degrees or more were 0.84 and 0.90 in LA TAC but were 0.42 and 0.90 in the count method.\r"

Each type has its characteristics related to the duration of symptoms and clinical features, and their management is not the same at all. The authors suggest that clinically this new classification may be of great help in estimating the status of the diseased limb and in selecting proper method of treatment.\r"

A total of 1031 children were born between 1964 and 1980 and started treatment before they were 4 months of age, and 808 of them were followed up prospectively. In 263 children born between 1964 and 1971 (cohort 1), the mean intelligence quotient (IQ) at 4 years rose with year of birth from 24 points below revised IQ norms to 10 points below; in 545 born between 1972 and 1980 (cohort 2) there was no further rise in IQ and the mean remained eight points below the norms. IQ fell progressively by roughly four points for each four weeks' delay in starting treatment, for each 300 mumol/l rise in mean phenylalanine concentrations during treatment, and for each five months during the first two years during which phenylalanine concentrations were below 120 mumol/l. Forty six children in cohort 2 had the most favourable treatment characteristics. Their mean IQ, after standardising for social class, was 112.6, and similar to the mean for the same group estimated by multiple regression, and to revised population IQ norms for the period during which the children were tested. The data suggest that many children who are treated early continue to suffer a mild degree of neurological impairment because of the difficulties in fully controlling the metabolic abnormality.\r"

The outcome of the late walkers was ascertained at the age of 3 years by health visitors using a standard questionnaire. Of the late walkers, 230 (56%) had an associated abnormality diagnosed before the age of 3 years, and in 77 of these children (33%) this was definite or suspected cerebral palsy. The high prevalence of late walking among infants born before 28 weeks' gestation (46%) was almost entirely accounted for by a high incidence of impairment. Late walking is a simple marker of morbidity in this group of infants.\r"

The age specific incidence in children (0-14 years) was 10 and in adults (greater than or equal to 15 years) 1.8/100,000/year. These incidence rates were higher than the incidence of Haemophilus influenzae meningitis in the same population. Blood cultures were obtained from 290 children (60%) and 185 adults (52%). H influenzae was isolated from 267 blood cultures (92%) from children and 98 blood cultures from adults (53%). Other organisms were isolated from six adults (3%). An artificial airway was established in 352 children (73%) and in 68 adults (19%); the remainder were treated conservatively. Six children and two adults died. Sweden has a high incidence of acute epiglottitis in children and the disease also occurs in adults. The importance of H influenzae in the aetiology of epiglottitis in all age groups is confirmed, but in adults many cases occur without septicaemia. The mortality is currently very low.\r"

During the earlier period 285 cases occurred, a total incidence of 16.9/100,000 children per year. In the later period 274 children were affected, an annual incidence of 17.8/100,000. The overall mortality rate fell dramatically from 11.9% to 1.8%, the latter figure comparing favourably with recent published studies from Scandinavia and the United States. There was a change in the bacteriological profile in the second period with a significant rise in cases due to Haemophilus influenzae at all ages. A fall in cases of meningococcal meningitis was significant in infants under 1 year of age only. Possible reasons for the change in the bacteriological pattern are discussed.\r"

The babies who disturbed their parents in the middle of the night were significantly more heavily wrapped in significantly warmer rooms.

  ".W": "We studied the extent to which patient characteristics influenced outcome in childhood idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura in a historical cohort of 289 children over a 20 year period (1968-87). Outcome was classified as acute or chronic depending on whether the platelet count had returned to normal (150 X 10(9)/l) by six months after diagnosis. Fifty three cases (18%) had chronic idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura. The likelihood of chronic disease was determined by logistic regression analysis of five patient variables: age, sex, season of onset of symptoms, history of recent viral illness, and duration of symptoms at presentation. A history of symptoms of greater than 14 days at presentation, adjusted for the other variables, was strongly predictive of chronic idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura; the other variables did not significantly affect outcome. At 28 days after diagnosis 138 (47%) of the study cohort had normal platelet counts. Children whose platelet counts were less than 150 X 10(9)/l had a threefold risk of progressing to chronic idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, which increased to fivefold if counts were less than 50 X 10(9)/l. Two thirds of patients in the chronic group, irrespective of treatment, remained thrombocytopenic two years after diagnosis. We conclude that a history of symptoms for greater than two weeks at presentation is strongly predictive of chronic idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura. If platelet counts are subnormal 28 days after diagnosis the risk of chronic idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura is increased with prolonged thrombocytopenia being very likely if platelet counts remain low three months after diagnosis.\r"

Overweight (72 boys, 88 girls) was defined as on or above the 90th percentile weight for height. After having controlled for the confounding variables of height and age, there were positive partial correlations between body mass index and lung function in girls whose weight was normal, in overweight girls, and in boys whose weight was normal, but not in overweight boys. In contrast to adults, body mass index has a positive effect on lung function in girls, whatever their weight. No such correlation between body mass index and lung function was seen in overweight boys. The observations may be accounted for by distinct sex dependent patterns of fat distribution in children.\r"

  ".W": "The properties of body mass indices were evaluated in a cross sectional study of the weights and heights of 5016 Chinese boys and girls aged between 3 and 18 years. Of the indices examined (weight/height (W/H), weight/height2 (W/H2), weight/height3 (W/H3) and weight/heightp (W/Hp], W/Hp was the only one that consistently showed least correlation with height, and so could be regarded as the optimal body mass index by the criterion of independence of the index from height. The exponent 'p' of W/Hp is, however, highly dependent on age; the value increases steadily between the age of 3 and 7-9 years, and then varies considerably around puberty. Only the age specific exponent ensures a lack of correlation between body mass index (W/Hp) and height. Age specific W/Hp should therefore be used in intrapopulation studies of weight or problems associated with obesity in children. Interpopulation comparison of weight and adiposity by W/H, W/H2, or W/H3 may give misleading results because of their dependence on height. Our results also suggest that the conventional weight for height charts may not be accurate enough for clinical use.\r"

All responders (good = hepatitis B surface (HBs) antibody titre greater than or equal to 10 U/l; poor = HBs antibody titre less than 10 U/l) showed pronounced increase in anti-HBs titre, in many cases above 1000 U/l. We also found positive HBs antibody response after further doses (two to four) at intervals of 15 days in non-responders (those patients who formerly had shown no HBs antibody titre after the conventional schedule of vaccination). The humoral response was always preceded by a delayed tissue hypersensitivity reaction. In conclusion, vaccine against hepatitis B virus given in low doses intradermally produces an effective immune response; it is a useful method of enhancing the antibody response in exposed patients, and of vaccinating those who do not respond initially.\r"

One half of the children demonstrated a decline in head circumference centile, which occurred in all patients treated with 24 Gy and in those patients treated with 18 Gy under the age of 3 years. In those children whose head growth was reduced, performance was significantly impaired in neuropsychological tests designed to assess concentration and short term memory. These children also developed clinically important learning difficulties in the classroom. Minor neurological dysfunction was present in almost half of the entire group. These data suggest that the treatment employed to prevent central nervous system leukaemia (primarily cranial irradiation) has a deleterious effect on head and brain growth and intellectual function.\r"

Less than 20% of deaths corresponded to the classic definition of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Babies who died during the course of potentially treatable disease had more adverse family and social factors: the parents were less likely to be owner occupiers, or own a car or telephone, their mothers were more likely to be young, to smoke, and to present late in pregnancy. Babies who died of minor disease tended to come from similar backgrounds, their families had greater levels of stress and the deaths appeared to be due to more than one factor. Babies who died with no terminal disease were younger, and more likely to be boys. Their families appeared to be demographically similar to those of a control group and to the general population.\r"

Major vessel encasement (17 patients) or occlusion (11 patients) was identified in 28 patients. There were no complications related to angiography. Among the 62 patients with normal angiograms, 48 underwent a pancreaticoduodenectomy, for a resectability rate of 77%. Among the 17 patients with vessel encasement, the resectability rate was 35%. For the 11 patients with vessel occlusion, the resectability rate was 0%. Combined with CT scan, visceral angiography is a useful adjunct in the staging of patients with periampullary tumors. Major vessel occlusion precludes resection, and major vessel encasement makes resection unlikely. If visceral angiography is normal, it is very likely that the tumor will be resectable.\r"

  ".U": "90290304\r", 
  ".W": "One hundred consecutive patients underwent intrathoracic muscle transposition between May 1977 and February 1988. Seventy-three procedures were performed to manage the complications of infection, which included treatment of bronchopleural fistula, postpneumonectomy empyema, perforations of the heart or great vessels, and fistulae of the esophagus and trachea. Prophylactic reinforcement of the repaired viscus was done in the remaining 27 patients because of either increased airway tension or previous intrathoracic radiation. There were 71 male and 29 female patients. Ages ranged from 16 to 82 years (median, 58 years). One hundred thirty muscle transpositions were performed and included 60 serratus anterior flaps, 33 latissimus dorsi, 28 pectoralis major, 3 intercostal, 2 rectus abdominus, and 4 others. The number of operations per patient ranged from 1 to 13 (median, 2). Seventy-six complications occurred in 35 patients. There were 16 operative deaths. Follow-up ranged from 3.4 to 150.7 months (median, 41 months). Infection was controlled or avoided in 73 patients. Forty-three of the operative survivors died. Cause of death was cancer in 27 patients, cardiac in 4, pulmonary in 3, infection in 3, suicide in 1, and unknown in 5. We conclude that although associated with a significant morbidity and mortality, intrathoracic muscle transposition when there is an actual or potential leak of an intrathoracic viscus can be life saving. Long-term survival, however, is determined by the pre-existing thoracic disorder.\r"

  ".W": "There is no universally accepted standard classification for liver injuries, and thus accurate comparison of reports on the subject is impossible. Most published reports on liver trauma suggest that both morbidity and mortality have a linear correlation with not only the amount of liver parenchyma injured but also with the magnitude of the surgical intervention. The exceptions are retrohepatic vein injuries, which have a mortality independent of associated parenchymal injury but should be integrated in any classification of liver injury. The classification proposed is based on the segmental anatomy of the liver (as defined by Couinaud): Grade I--Injuries requiring no operative intervention, or any injury that requires operative intervention limited to a segment or less. Grade II--Any injury that requires operative intervention involving two or more segments. Grade III--Any injury with an associated juxta- or retrohepatic vein injury. We reviewed all patients with isolated liver injuries during the past 5 years and prospectively reviewed all patients for the 6-month period from January to June 1988 and applied this classification. Sixty-nine patients had grade I injuries, with one death (1%); thirteen patients had grade II injuries, with six deaths (46%); and 13 patients had grade III injuries with nine deaths (69%). Postoperative morbidity was 7% for grade I, 57% for grade II, and 50% for grade III. This study supports the conclusion that morbidity and mortality from liver injury are directly related to the volume of parenchyma involved, and that segmental anatomy can be applied to define this volume. Mortality from retrohepatic vein injuries is independent of associated parenchymal injury. We believe that this proposed classification will provide a simple, reproducible, and accurate means for reporting and comparing liver injuries.\r"

Early transplant infections of donor origin were lethal. Late transplant pneumonitis was well tolerated and recovery was the rule. Three of nine cases had significant tracheal suture line stenosis and were managed conservatively. A technique of bronchial artery implantation using a conduit tailored from donor aorta is described. Transplant rejection was easily diagnosed and treated. Other notable complications included occasional massive pleural fluid loss, temporary space problem, and a delay in the 'resetting' of chemoreceptors resulting in moderate post-transplant hypercarbia accompanied by episodes in which the patient felt hypoxemic despite the maintenance of excellent levels of blood gases. A comprehensive rehabilitation program begun before operation is essential for success.\r"

  ".W": "Multiple levels of aortoileofemoral occlusive disease may necessitate profundoplasty or extension of the outflow anastomosis to insure pelvic and distal arterial perfusion. During the period 1978 through 1988, 1637 patients underwent elective aortic reconstruction for aneurysmal or occlusive disease. One hundred forty-five had profundoplasty performed to ensure adequate outflow. Associated disease was common with 88 (60%) patients having arteriosclerotic heart disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) present in 89 (61%) patients. Hypertension and extracranial occlusive disease was found in 68 (46%) and 56 (38%) patients, respectively. The superficial femoral artery was occluded in 108 (74%) patients, while in 17 (12%) the profunda femoris was the only patent artery in the groin. Death occurred in nine patients (6.2%). Three were due to arrhythmias or myocardial infarction and ischemic colitis was the cause of death in two. Renal failure, sepsis, aspiration and cerebral anoxia, and disseminated intravascular coagulopathy accounted for one each. Five graft limbs failed. Amputation was required in one patient, while thrombectomy or distal bypass restored flow in four patients. Seventeen graft limbs in 136 patients occluded during the follow-up period. Distal bypass was successful in four and amputation was required in the fifth patient. Extension of the profundoplasty restored flow in nine limbs, while thrombectomy alone was successful in one. Bilateral amputation was required in one patient with poor run off and insufficient autogenus venous tissue. One hundred fourteen (78.6%) of the 145 patients survived 10 years with patency in 268 of the original 290 limbs at risk (92.4%). Profundoplasty in these patients with multilevel disease seems to extend the long-term patency of aortofemoral grafts and allows return to a normal life-style.\r"

The pneumatic antishock garment, external fixation, and angiography were selectively used to control bleeding. Abdominal injuries were diagnosed using clinical examination and diagnostic peritoneal lavage. When lavage aspirate was grossly bloody, patients had no negative explorations. Microscopically positive lavages were associated with a 50% false-negative rate. Using the protocol, the mortality rate was 5%. Overall mortality rate was 10%. The combination of a trauma team approach and a specifically designed protocol reduces the number of deaths from pelvic fracture.\r"

  ".U": "90290311\r", 
  ".W": "Late infection of devitalized pancreatic and peripancreatic tissue has become the major cause of morbidity in severe acute pancreatitis. Previous experience found that peritoneal lavage for periods of 48 to 96 hours may reduce early systemic complications but did not decrease late pancreatic sepsis. A fortunate observation led to the present study of the influence of a longer period of lavage on late sepsis. Twenty-nine patients receiving primary nonoperative treatment for severe acute pancreatitis (three or more positive prognostic signs) were randomly assigned to short peritoneal lavage (SPL) for 2 days (15 patients) or to long peritoneal lavage (LPL) for 7 days (14 patients). Positive prognostic signs averaged 5 in both groups but the frequency of five or more signs was higher in LPL (71%) than in SPL (47%). Eleven patients in each group had early computed tomographic (CT) scans. Peripancreatic fluid collections were shown more commonly in LPL (82%) than in SPL (54%) patients. Longer lavage dramatically reduced the frequency of both pancreatic sepsis (22% LPL versus 40% SPL) and death from sepsis (0% LPL versus 20% SPL). Among patients with fluid collections on early CT scan, LPL led to a more marked reduction in both pancreatic sepsis (33% LPL versus 83% SPL) and death from sepsis (0% LPL versus 33% SPL). The differences were even more striking among 17 patients with five or more positive prognostic signs. In this group the incidence of pancreatic sepsis was 30% LPL versus 57% SPL and of death from sepsis 0% (LPL) versus 43% (SPL) (p = 0.05). In these patients, overall mortality was also reduced (20% LPL versus 43% SPL). When 20 patients treated by LPL were compared with 91 other patients with three or more positive prognostic signs who were treated without lavage or by lavage for periods of 2 to 4 days, the frequency of death from pancreatic sepsis was reduced from 13% to 5%. In those with five or more signs, the incidence of sepsis was reduced from 40% to 27% (p = 0.03) and of death for sepsis from 30% to 7% (p = 0.08). These findings indicate that lavage of the peritoneal cavity for 7 days may significantly reduce both the frequency and mortality rate of pancreatic sepsis in severe acute pancreatitis.\r"

These patients often require diagnostic peritoneal lavage (DPL), cranial computed tomography (CCT) scan, thoracic aortography, and multiple operations. We surveyed 408 patients with a widened mediastinum who underwent aortography from 1981 to 1989 to determine priorities of management. Multisystem injuries were common with 278 (68%) and 72 (18%) of patients requiring DPL and celiotomy, respectively. Central nervous system (CNS) injury occurred in 276 (68%) patients, and orthopedic injuries were present in 162 (40%). There were 35 thoracic aortic injuries and 17 branch injuries with 15 deaths (11 aortic, 4 branch). Mortality primarily was attributed to hemorrhage, neurologic injuries, and multisystem organ failure. We evaluated the sequence of diagnostic and therapeutic interventions to determine possible sequence errors and 98% of patients had no errors identified. Based on this experience, we have formulated a management protocol for evaluation of patients with multiple injuries and a widened mediastinum.\r"

  ".W": "We reviewed our experience in 38 patients who underwent a Fontan operation. In the first five patients ages 7.5 to 23 years (mean, 15 years), a conduit was placed from the right atrium to the small right ventricle or the pulmonary artery (PA). The remaining 33 patients, ages 7 months to 14 years (mean, 4.8 years), had a modified Fontan operation with direct systemic venous or right atrial to PA anastomosis. The diagnoses were tricuspid atresia (n = 14), single ventricle (n = 10), hypoplastic right or left ventricle (n = 9), double-outlet right ventricle with inlet ventricular septal defect and pulmonary atresia or stenosis (n = 3), criss-cross ventricles and transposition of the great arteries (n = 1), and atrioventricular canal and anomalous pulmonary venous connection (n = 1). Thirty-two patients had previous surgery. Other procedures included PA banding (n = 7), systemic to PA shunts (n = 25), Norwood operation (n = 3), and a Damus-Kaye-Stansel anastomosis (n = 1), repair of total anomolous pulmonary venous connection (n = 1), a Blalock-Hanlon atrial septectomy (n = 1), and enlargement of a restrictive ventricular septal defect (n = 1). There were four operative deaths (10.5%), three from low cardiac output and one from subaortic obstruction. There were no deaths in patients younger than 3 years of age (n = 13). Subaortic obstruction developed in six of the seven patients who had pulmonary artery banding and resulted in three deaths. In our experience, diagnosis, previous surgery, type of previous operation, PA pressure, and younger age are not risk factors for early or late death. Subaortic obstruction is a major risk factor for late death. Accordingly we now perform a Damus-Kaye-Stansel anastomosis combined with a systemic to PA shunt in those children with excessive pulmonary blood flow who anatomically are likely to develop subaortic obstruction. A modified Fontan operation can be performed any time after 1 year of age and in some patients after 6 months of age, providing the anatomy and physiology of the patient are acceptable.\r"

Our experience with this procedure includes stapled colorectal anastomoses in 75 patients and is the basis for the report. This review presents the details and advantages of the technique and the results. Complications include two patients with anastomotic leak (2.7%), and two with stenosis that required treatment (2.7%). Protective colostomy was not done in this series. There were no deaths. Our experience and that of others suggests that this modification of the EEA technique can allow a lower anastomosis in some patients, and that it can be done with greater safety and facility.\r"

Of 1662 acutely burned patients admitted to this institution between 1982 and 1989, 594 underwent near-total excision of cutaneous flame or scald burn injuries in a single procedure. Operations took less than 3 hours and there were no operative deaths. Blood losses in burns of more than 30% total body surface area (TBSA) were significantly less at 0.40 +/- 0.06 mL/cm2 and 0.49 +/- 0.49 mL/cm2 excised when surgery was performed within the first 24 hours or after the 16th day after burn, respectively, when compared to 0.75 +/- 0.02 mL/cm2 for those excised between 2 and 16 days after burn (p less than 0.05). Blood loss for burns of less than 30% TBSA was of 1.19 +/- 0.13 mL/cm2. Early excision did not increase mortality rate when compared to later excision times. We suggest that near-total excision of large burns within the first 24 hours reduces blood requirements and morbidity without adversely altering hemodynamic stability or increasing mortality risks.\r"

Thirty-two survivors have been followed from 1 to 86 months (mean, 20 months). All experienced sustained improvement in functional status and minimal late morbidity. All survivors remained in NYHA class 1 or 2. Cardiac surgical procedures in patients older than 80 years can be performed with increased but acceptable mortality and morbidity rates. Most patients achieve sustained symptomatic improvement and excellent long-term survival.\r"

Antral spike activity was unchanged during the study. Jejunal spike activity was present in the earliest recordings and occurred in 45.9% +/- 3.5% to 59.9% +/- 5.5% of slow waves. Recovery of normal colon discrete and continuous electric response activity occurred on postoperative day 5.9 +/- 1.5. Bowel sounds returned on day 2.4 +/- 0.5 and passage of flatus and stool occurred on day 5.1 +/- 0.2. The myoelectric parameters measured are not absolutely predictive of uneventful recovery from postoperative ileus but they are, as a group, more informative than any currently available clinical criteria.\r"

Although the fecal carriage rate of S. bovis increases with colonic pathology, no explanation exists for the development of bacteremia in these cases. To explore the possible contribution of hepatic dysfunction to the development of portal and systemic bacteremia, the incidence of both colonic pathology and liver disease or dysfunction was determined in 92 patients with S. bovis endocarditis and/or bacteremia. Colonic and liver evaluation had been undertaken in 47% and 93% of patients, respectively. Among these patients, colonic pathology was identified in 51%, and liver disease or dysfunction was documented in 56%. Either the underlying colonic disease or alterations in hepatic secretion of bile salts or immunoglobulins may promote the overgrowth of S. bovis and its translocation from the intestinal lumen into the portal venous system. A compromised hepatic reticuloendothelial system may then contribute to the development of S. bovis septicemia and subsequent endocarditis. We conclude that S. bovis bacteremia is an indication to the clinician of the possibility of underlying liver disease as well as colon pathology.\r"

Forty-seven of these infants had meconium aspiration syndrome and 11 had diaphragmatic hernia. The use of ECMO, when indicated, after reduction and repair of the diaphragmatic hernia, results in normal oxygen delivery, allows time for pulmonary maturation, and increases survival. A total of 27 referrals for diaphragmatic hernia were studied. Six infants had surgical repair and did not require ECMO. Eleven patients, after surgical repair, were treated with ECMO and seven survived. More importantly 10 patients died before the use of ECMO. Six infants died either before or during transport from referring hospitals and four died while in the delivery room or neonatal unit before ECMO. Of these 10 infants, eight were potential candidates for ECMO. Thirteen of the twenty-seven (48%) infants survived. Seven of eleven (64%) infants who received the benefit of ECMO survived. Eight infants who met the criteria for ECMO died before its use. Had ECMO been used in those eight infants, our data suggests that at least four may have survived. The data from this report support the concept that infants undergoing surgical repair of diaphragmatic hernia, when ECMO is not available, should be referred to an ECMO center in the early postoperative period. Furthermore infants with prenatal diagnosis of diaphragmatic hernia should be delivered at a center where surgical as well as ECMO expertise are available.\r"

We found that age-specific mortality for PD in all demographic groups had changed notably during this 23-year interval. Among whites of both sexes, substantial declines were observed among the middle-aged, while notable increases were seen in the geriatric age groups. Similar changes were found in nonwhites; among nonwhites in the geriatric age range, increases of 22% to 553% were observed among women. Men generally had a 100% higher risk of death due to PD than did women. Whites were at three times the risk of nonwhites. The observed temporal changes appear to reflect improved treatment, better case ascertainment, and a true rise in the incidence of PD, particularly among the elderly. This rise may be due to preventable environmental causes and will require further investigation.\r"

Six of the eight women experienced relapses within the first 7 weeks after delivery. The number and percent of CD8 suppressor T cells were lower, and the CD4 helper-CD8 suppressor T-cell ratio was higher in the pregnant patients with multiple sclerosis compared with pregnant control women throughout pregnancy and the first 6 months post partum. There was no evident relationship between these parameters and clinical disease activity. Levels of alpha-fetoprotein, alpha 2-pregnancy-associated glycoprotein, and pregnancy-associated plasma protein A, all immunosuppressive proteins associated with pregnancy, were not significantly different in pregnant patients with multiple sclerosis and pregnant controls without multiple sclerosis. The study suggested that the risk of clinical relapse after delivery may be higher than has been reported previously. Furthermore, although there were differences in suppressor T cells, they were not predictably linked to changes in clinical disease activity.\r"

Compared with age-matched controls, each of the cortical and subcortical metabolic values was significantly reduced, with a predominance in the frontal cortex, in both groups of patients with probable and possible PSP, without a difference between these two groups, suggesting similar underlying disease. The frontal metabolic value decreased with disease duration, but the relative frontal hypometabolism (expressed as the fronto-occipital metabolic ratio) was apparently already present in the early stages of the disease. The parkinsonian motor score was correlated with the caudate and thalamic metabolic values. The intellectual deterioration index was significantly correlated with both the frontal and the nonfrontal metabolic values. Finally, the frontal neuropsychological score was significantly correlated with only the fronto-occipital metabolic ratio. Hence, in PSP, a degenerative brain disease with subcortical lesions, the prominent frontal lobe-like syndrome essentially depends on the relative hypometabolism of the frontal cortex.\r"

At initial evaluation, association cortex metabolic asymmetries were greater in patients with DAT than in controls for all dementia severities and correlated significantly with neuropsychological discrepancies between visuospatial and language abilities in patients with moderate dementia. In mildly impaired patients, right-left metabolic asymmetries in the association cortices were directionally stable and became more pronounced over time. At initial evaluation, these patients had significant impairment, relative to controls, on tests of memory and attention to complex tasks but not on tests of language and visuospatial function. Memory, attention, language, and visuospatial impairments, however, all worsened significantly over time. In mildly impaired patients, correlations between right-left metabolic asymmetries and neuropsychological discrepancies were insignificant initially but were significant at last evaluation. These results demonstrate that heterogeneous nonmemory language and visuospatial impairments in early DAT are related to and predicted by the earlier-appearing distribution of metabolic reductions in the association neocortex.\r"

Total D1-dopamine receptor concentration was unchanged in patients with Alzheimer's disease compared with controls, but the RH sites were significantly reduced in number. Since the RH sites are thought to represent a conformational change of the receptors, induced by the interaction of agonist-bound receptor with a signal transduction protein located in the cell membrane, the reduced ratio of RH sites to total receptors suggests a functional alteration of cortical cell membranes in Alzheimer's disease. Such a cell membrane abnormality might explain why substitution therapy in Alzheimer's disease has been largely disappointing.\r"

  ".W": "Unconsciousness resulting from exposure to increased levels of head-to-foot (+Gz) acceleration stress (501 unconsciousness episodes) on a centrifuge in asymptomatic, healthy human subjects was investigated. A method for quantitatively measuring the kinetics of the unconsciousness and associated phenomenon was developed. In addition, a theoretical framework for describing the central nervous system (CNS) alteration resulting from acute reduction of blood flow was formulated to allow a method for defining unconsciousness phenomenon. The length of unconsciousness and the associated incapacitation was found to be dependent on the magnitude of the CNS insult resulting from reduced blood flow. The magnitude of the insult was determined by the onset and offset rates of the +Gz-stress and the length of time at increased +Gz. The incapacitation resulting from +Gz-stress included 11.9 seconds of absolute incapacitation (unconsciousness) and 16 seconds of relative incapacitation (confusion/disorientation) for 28 seconds of total incapacitation (period of time for lack of purposeful movement). Myoclonic convulsions were observed in approximately 70% of the unconsciousness episodes. The convulsions lasted 4 seconds and occurred following the return of CNS blood flow. The convulsions occurred after 8 seconds of unconsciousness and ended coincident with the return of consciousness. They occurred when the CNS insult was of greater magnitude. Memorable dreams occurred and were considered to occur during the terminal portion of the convulsion period. The dreams occurred with exposures having longer unconsciousness. The length of unconsciousness and incapacitation was affected by the wearing of an anti-G suit, with unconsciousness and incapacitation being reduced if the suit were worn. Performance of an anti-G straining maneuver resulted in an increased length of incapacitation by allowing the subject to get to higher levels of +Gz-stress and to sustain a greater amount of acceleration exposure. The results of this 11-year study of human unconsciousness provide a quantitative kinetic description of the phenomenon in healthy humans that is completely documented on videotape. These results should be of interest to neuropsychophysiologists investigating unconsciousness, convulsive activity, and dream phenomenon. They also provide the basis for future research aimed at solving +Gz-induced loss-of-consciousness problems in fighter-aircraft aviation.\r"

At 2 years after suffering a stroke, patients with an in-hospital diagnosis of depression (either major or minor depression) were significantly more impaired in both physical activities and language functioning than were non-depressed patients. Among patients with major depression, this disparity in the recovery profile was present even after the depression had remitted.

Both groups exhibited greater right hemisphere negativity during the Necker cube task. Whereas controls revealed greater left hemisphere negativity during linguistic tasks, the reverse was found with dyslexics. The right shift was pronounced with the reading, orthographic error detection, and antonym conditions. Differences between the two groups were also found for the pattern of cortical distribution.

In experiment 1, stimuli were applied in face-hand combinations. In experiment 2, the Face-Hand Test was ranked from 0 (no extinction) to 7 (marked extinction) using progressively greater stimulation.

Partial agenesis of the corpus callosum, a rare neurodevelopmental abnormality, was found in two patients, one of whom also had a callosal lipoma. Evidence is presented suggesting that this finding represents an increased prevalence of partial agenesis in schizophrenia. The corpus callosum develops embryologically in intimate relationship to the hippocampal formation, fornix, septum pellucidum, and cingulate gyrus. In individuals with callosal agenesis, abnormalities also occur in the development of these limbic structures. Recent neuropathologic studies have suggested the occurrence of abnormal neurogenesis in the hippocampal formation and in the cingulate gyrus in schizophrenic patients. An increased prevalence of callosal agenesis and its related limbic abnormalities would further support investigation into neurodevelopmental abnormalities of these anatomical regions in schizophrenia.\r"

Magnetic resonance imaging usually demonstrated an irregularly but sharply marginated mass with inhomogeneous density, variable enhancement with gadolinium, lack of edema in adjacent normal structures, extensive insinuation into cisternal and other cerebrospinal fluid spaces, and a high-signal intensity on proton-weighted images. Multiplanar magnetic resonance imaging was extremely helpful in displaying the full anatomic extent of the lesion and its relationship with other structures.\r"

Cell-associated HIV DNA was detected within joint fluid by in situ hybridization and the phenotypes of infected cells were established using a double-labelling immunocytochemical technique. Viral DNA was detected in dendritic cells (4-25%) isolated from both the peripheral blood and synovial fluid and in occasional lymphocytes from peripheral blood (less than 0.1%). No infected macrophages were seen. Functional studies using the mixed leucocyte reaction showed that the dendritic cells from synovial fluid were poor stimulators of allogenic peripheral blood lymphocytes whilst being effective at stimulating autologous lymphocytes. In addition, synovial fluid lymphocytes responded poorly to normal control dendritic cells. Infection of these cells with HIV could be contributing to this low stimulatory activity of antigen-presenting cells and to the unresponsiveness of lymphocytes.\r"

The pattern of articular involvement did not differ from the literature and was most often mono- or oligoarthritis with polyarticular arthralgia. We noted an early onset of articular symptoms (range 1-3 months). Incidence of early and late manifestations of LD were in keeping with previous reports. In addition, interpreting serological tests for antibodies against B. burgdorferi and the real prevalence of arthritis in LD is complicated by the possible existence of seronegative LD and by the effect of early antibiotic treatment.\r"

On warming, blood flow normally increases gradually at first, followed by rapid vasodilatation at temperatures above 33 degrees C. Normal geometric mean (95% confidence interval) blood flows at 33 degrees C and 36 degrees C were 0.19 (0.16-0.22) and 0.39 (0.29-0.53) arbitrary units respectively. In primary Raynaud's phenomenon, blood flows were 0.53 (0.44-0.62) and 1.07 (0.86-1.35) arbitrary units respectively (P less than 0.01 compared to normal subjects), showing early vasodilatation. Normal women have an intermediate response between men and primary Raynaud's patients. Responses in secondary Raynaud's phenomenon widely overlap the other groups. We conclude that an abnormal peripheral vascular response to temperature change exists in primary Raynaud's phenomenon.\r"

In comparison with previous studies, incident cases were characterized by a high age at diagnosis with the highest incidence in age groups 55-64 and 65-74, approximately 7.5/100,000/year. The incidence was low in children under 15 years of age, 0.4/100,000/year, and unexpectedly so in the 15-24 decade, 1.2/100,000/year. Patient retrieval was based on four separate sources: a computerized diagnosis register; referrals from both public health care physicians and private practitioners; and records of ANA positive individuals from the single laboratory serving the area. All incident patients were present in at least two of these sources and 11 patients were present in three. We interpret the high amount of overlap between retrieval sources, without patients detected in only one source, as evidence for a high degree of completeness in our retrieval of SLE patients.\r"

Its suitability for use with British patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) has been tested. A study on 30 patients high-lighted the need to anglicize the terminology and spelling. A further 30 patients found the modified questionnaire easier to complete than the original. The concurrent validity of this modified AIMS was then tested on 59 patients by comparison with two widely accepted standards. Physical function and pain scales were tested against the Stanford Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ). Because the HAQ has no psychological component, psychological status was compared with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HAD). Results showed a good correlation between the scales and it is concluded that the modified version of the AIMS may be used with confidence in British patients with RA.\r"

Significant improvement of circumference of PIP joints (P less than 0.001) and proximal phalanges (P less than 0.01) were found. On wearing the control gloves, some improvement was also found, but only the circumference of PIP joints decreased significantly (P less than 0.05). Nocturnal pain and morning stiffness diminished significantly on wearing both types of glove. Grip strength improved, but not significantly with both. No significant differences were detected between the effects of wearing the two types of glove. No correlation was found between the decreased swelling in the hands as measured by PIP joint circumference or circumference of the proximal phalanges and the decreased nocturnal pain or morning stiffness. This study provided no explanation for the beneficial effect of the gloves. It was shown that for some patients with painful and swollen hands, wearing gloves at night may give relief.\r"

As few as 10 copies of the plasmid in the initial reaction mix were detectable using this technique. In contrast, chlamydial DNA was not detectable in the knee joints of nine patients with definite sexually acquired reactive arthritis (SARA) or nine patients with suspected SARA. Five patients with an undifferentiated seronegative lower limb oligoarthropathy, one with Crohn's disease and another with post-enteric reactive arthritis had evidence of intra-articular chlamydial antigens as judged by fluorescein-labelled monoclonal antibody staining of joint material but, again, no chlamydia plasmid DNA was detected. The nature of the immunofluorescent staining seen in some of these samples remains to be elucidated. It could be due to the presence of chlamydial outer membrane protein or lipopolysaccharide antigens in the joints, either free or in immune complexes, or it may be artefactual. Our results indicate that viable C. trachomatis is not present in the joints of the patients in this study even in the presence of chlamydial antigen detected by fluorescence antibody testing.\r"

The same questionnaire together with 'potted' histories of five of the patients was sent to 10 consultant rheumatologists. The willingness of both patients and doctors to risk side-effects varied with both the severity of the side-effect and the potential therapeutic benefit. Doctors were more willing than patients to risk death or serious disability (Wilcoxon, P less than 0.01) for a particular expected benefit. Doctors were also more willing to risk side-effects in treating seropositive rheumatoid arthritis than in treating non-articular rheumatism. No correlation was seen for patients between acceptable risk and diagnosis, pain or smoking habits. The risks which both groups stated they were willing to accept were less than those apparently associated with antirheumatic therapy. The results disagreed markedly with those of a previous study, demonstrating the importance of the methods used in this type of work.\r"

Analysis of data collected from experiments involving animal models depends on the number of factors being varied. The number of animals influences the level of confidence associated with a result. Ignoring statistics can invalidate conclusions drawn from the experiments. Statistical considerations are also important in the presentation of results.\r"

Thirteen cases of similar reactions to sulphasalazine, all in patients treated for inflammatory bowel disease, can be found in the literature. We identify two types of pulmonary reaction, an eosinophilic pneumonitis and a fibrosing alveolitis. Adequate histological investigation is needed to differentiate between the two and management may be different. The diagnosis of pulmonary reactions are important because they can be easily confused with complications of the underlying disease but the prognosis is much better.\r"

HIV infection is not a notifiable condition in Quebec. We were asked by the ministere de la Sante et des Services sociaux du Quebec to perform a pilot project for the surveillance of HIV seropositivity using a network of sentinel physicians. From May 15, 1988, to Sept. 30, 1989, physicians from four collaborating centres collected data on the serologic status, demographic characteristics and risk factors for 4209 patients who underwent HIV antibody testing. Of the 3899 subjects included in the study 7.9% were HIV positive. Through logistic regression analysis the following variables were found to be significantly associated with HIV seropositivity: presence of HIV-related symptoms (prevalence odds ratio [POR] 36.5), origin from an endemic area (POR 9.1), homosexuality or bisexuality (POR 8.4), intravenous drug use (POR 4.2), male sex (POR 2.8), previous HIV antibody testing (POR 2.5) and previous sexually transmitted disease (POR 1.8). Over the study period we found a large increase in HIV seroprevalence among intravenous drug users (4.2% in 1988 to 19.0% in 1989) (p = 0.02). This increase might reflect a recent change in the epidemiologic pattern of HIV transmission in Quebec. Surveillance of HIV seropositivity through a network of sentinel physicians may be a reasonable alternative to mandatory reporting.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of the widely consumed drugs caffeine and phenylpropanolamine are mediated through activation of the central and sympathetic nervous systems. Severe, life-threatening, and occasionally fatal hypertensive reactions have been reported after their combined use. This study examined the possible pharmacokinetic interaction of phenylpropanolamine and caffeine. Sixteen normal subjects received combinations of caffeine, phenylpropanolamine, and placebo. In subjects receiving 400 mg caffeine plus 75 mg phenylpropanolamine, the mean (+/- SEM) peak plasma caffeine concentration of 8.0 +/- 2.2 micrograms/ml was significantly greater than after 400 mg caffeine alone (2.1 +/- 0.3 micrograms/ml; t[24] = 2.4; p less than 0.01). Physical side effects were more frequent after the phenylpropanolamine-caffeine combination than after either drug alone or after placebo. Greater increases in both systolic and diastolic blood pressures occurred after the combination than after either drug alone. Because caffeine levels can be increased greatly when certain other drugs are coconsumed, these data indicate that phenylpropanolamine may enhance absorption or inhibit elimination of caffeine and may explain increased side effects reported after their combined use.\r"

  ".W": "Because both quinidine and propranolol bind to the cytochrome P-450 responsible for the oxidation of debrisoquin, six healthy male subjects were studied to determine whether an interaction occurred between the two drugs and the pharmacodynamic consequences of that interaction. The coadministration of quinidine resulted in a doubling of the area under the plasma concentration-time curve of (+/-)-propranolol (530 +/- 99 versus 1051 +/- 138 ng.hr/ml; p less than 0.05) and a reduction in the clearance of (+/-)-propranolol from 3087 +/- 648 to 1378 +/- 173 ml/min (p less than 0.05). The metabolism of propranolol by the 4-hydroxylation pathway was almost abolished by quinidine, resulting in a fall in the partial metabolic clearance by this pathway from 678 +/- 246 to 56 +/- 11 ml/min (p less than 0.05). Quinidine differentially affected the metabolism of (+)-propranolol and (-)-propranolol, resulting in an increase of 176.6% +/- 45.5% and 100.4% +/- 25.5% in the area under the plasma concentration-time curve of (+)-propranolol and (-)-propranolol, respectively (p less than 0.05). The pharmacokinetic changes were associated with pharmacodynamic effects. The combination of propranolol and quinidine resulted in increased beta-blockade measured by reduction in exercise heart rate and prolongation of the QTc and PR intervals. We conclude that quinidine stereoselectively inhibits the metabolism of propranolol through inhibition of the debrisoquin isozyme. The increased concentration of propranolol produced by quinidine results in increased beta-blockade.\r"

The effects on bromocriptine plasma concentrations by bromocriptine coadministration with caffeine and erythromycin were evaluated in five male volunteers. Serial blood samples were obtained during a 12-hour period after a single 5 mg oral dose of bromocriptine (alone and after 4-day treatments of either erythromycin estolate, 250 mg four times/day, or caffeine, 200 mg four times/day). There were no significant alterations of bromocriptine pharmacokinetic parameters after caffeine, although statistical power was very low. With the use of erythromycin, the bromocriptine area under the concentration-time curve standardized to body weight increased significantly by 268%, whereas peak bromocriptine plasma concentration (Cmax) increased to 4.6 times the Cmax from bromocriptine alone. Time to achieve Cmax was not altered by erythromycin. We conclude that erythromycin can markedly increase the systemic bioavailability of bromocriptine, which can lead to increased therapeutic or adverse effects, whereas the effects of caffeine require further study.\r"

Excellent correlation of blood pressure reduction and plasma level was observed and linear kinetics existed. In the severe hypertensive patients, 1, 2, 4, 5, and 8 mg/hr were infused to established minimal and ineffective doses. One milligram per hour was an ineffective dose; 4, 5, and 8 mg/hr all produced significant reductions over the course of the study that were undistinguishable from each other. Two milligrams per hour produced modest reductions in blood pressure. Blood pressure reduction also correlated with plasma levels in the severe hypertensive group.\r"

To determine if this difference was because a greater proportion of the total propranolol was the more active (-)-isomer of propranolol in the Chinese subjects than in the white subjects, the relative pharmacokinetics of (+)- and (-)-isomers of propranolol after administration of a single, 80 mg oral dose of racemic propranolol was studied in 10 Chinese male and in 9 white male healthy subjects. The plasma concentrations of both (+)- and (-)-propranolol were lower in Chinese than in white subjects, resulting in significantly lower peak plasma concentrations and areas under the concentration-time curve (AUC) in Chinese subjects, the half-life of elimination did not differ significantly between Chinese and white subjects or between the two isomers. The concentrations of the active (-)-propranolol were higher in both groups of subjects because of the lower clearance of the (-)-propranolol compared with the (+)-propranolol. An excellent correlation between the clearance of (+)- and (-)-propranolol was seen in the same individual. The ratio of AUC of (-)- and (+)-propranolol did not differ between Chinese subjects (0.64 +/- 0.03) and white subjects (0.71 +/- 0.09). The data suggest that the proportion of the two isomers found in Chinese and white subjects did not differ, and therefore differences in stereoselective disposition of propranolol cannot explain the increased sensitivity seen in Chinese individuals.\r"

They were divided in three groups according to the severity of the liver disease quantitated by the Child-Pugh score. Plasma and urine concentrations of zidovudine and its glucuronidated metabolite (GAZT) were measured simultaneously by HPLC assay. Findings were compared with those previously measured in six healthy volunteers. As a consequence of a marked drop in oral clearance (10 +/- 4 versus 38 +/- 15 ml/min/kg), zidovudine concentrations, half-life, and mean residence time were increased in patients with cirrhosis. No difference could be established between the three groups. The reason for such a decrease in oral clearance of zidovudine was the reduction in the GAZT formation clearance (236 +/- 73 versus 1540 +/- 540 ml/min); this led to a decrease in the AUC ratio of GAZT and zidovudine (1.3 +/- 0.6 versus 4.6 +/- 0.7), which was directly related to the severity of the cirrhosis. In patients, as in volunteers, formation of GAZT rate limits its elimination. To avoid important cumulation of zidovudine after repeated dosing in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome who have hepatic impairment, a dosage adjustment could be proposed.\r"

  ".W": "Propafenone is a class 1c antiarrhythmic agent with moderate beta-blocking activity as a result of a structural similarity to beta-adrenoceptor antagonists. In a randomized, double-blind crossover exercise study, eight healthy volunteers were examined before and 2 1/2 hours after oral administration of 300 mg (R,S)-, 150 mg (R)-, and 150 mg (S)-propafenone hydrochloride. The mean rate pressure product was significantly reduced by (R,S)-propafenone hydrochloride (-5.2%; p = 0.045) and half-dosed (S)-propafenone hydrochloride (-5.9%; p = 0.013), whereas the (R)-enantiomer caused no significant changes. There was a significant difference between the effects of (R)- and (S)-propafenone (p = 0.033). In beta-adrenoceptor-binding inhibition experiments with (S)-(125I)iodocyanopindolol in a sarcolemma-enriched cardiac membrane preparation, the eudismic ratio of (S)- over (R)-propafenone was 54. On the spontaneously beating Langendorff-perfused guinea pig heart, 3 x 10(-6) mol/L of both (R)- and (S)-propafenone resulted in significant changes (p less than 0.01) on His bundle conduction (+79% +/- 27% and +69% +/- 9%), as well as comparable decreases in the maximal rate of pacing with 1:1 conduction of the atrial (-54% +/- 10% and -57% +/- 8%) and ventricular myocardium (-42% +/- 6% and -43% +/- 6%), indicating equal effects in sodium channel-dependent antiarrhythmic class 1 activity. Thus (R)- and (S)-propafenone exert different beta-blocking actions but equal effects on the sodium channel-dependent antiarrhythmic class 1 activity. More specific antiarrhythmic class 1 therapy with reduction of beta-blocking side effects may be attained with optically pure (R)-propafenone hydrochloride instead of the currently used racemic mixture.\r"

After a baseline assessment, subjects were paid to quit smoking for a period of 2 weeks. Forty-one (72%) of the 57 subjects were successful in quitting smoking for the 2-week period. Results indicated that, relative to the other two conditions, abstinent subjects receiving phenylpropanolamine gained 1.5 to 1.9 pounds less weight (p less than 0.05). In addition, abstinence rates were higher (p less than 0.03) and dietary intake lower for subjects receiving phenylpropanolamine (p less than 0.05) relative to the other two conditions. No changes in physical activity were observed. It is concluded that phenylpropanolamine may help reduce weight gain associated with smoking abstinence and in this way may enhance smoking cessation efforts in certain individuals.\r"

Each subject then received ascending doses of phenylephrine (0.191 to 7.6 micrograms/min) alone and with concurrent verapamil (19.1 micrograms/min) by brachial arterial infusion. Dose-ratio during verapamil infusion compared with control was 8.1 (p less than 0.05). No change in slope of the phenylephrine dose-response curve was noted; however, consistent with the dose ratio, verapamil shifted the curve to the right with a decrease in the y intercept determined by linear regression (60.0 versus 40.3 mm Hg ml/100 ml forearm volume/min; p less than 0.05). Verapamil-induced attenuation of forearm vasoconstriction elicited by phenylephrine indicates that, in humans, in vivo verapamil forearm vasodilating effects are, in part, a result of alpha 1-adrenergic blockade.\r"

These changes included reduction in spindle size, disorganization of microtubules within the spindle itself, and sometimes a complete lack of microtubules. In some oocytes, chromosome dispersal from the metaphase plate was associated with these changes. Cooling the oocyte to room temperature for only 10 minutes produced a similar pattern of disruption to spindle structure in many cases. The spindles in oocytes that were cooled for either 10 or 30 minutes and then allowed to recover at 37 degrees C for either 1 or 4 hours were found to resemble those in noncooled control oocytes in less than one half of the cases examined, although in only a few cases did the chromosomes remain dispersed. The significance of these findings for the handling of oocytes during gamete intrafallopian transfer and in vitro fertilization procedures is discussed in relation to the levels of aneuploidy detected in early human embryos.\r"

Nicotine and the presence of a varicocele were more gonadotoxic than either the varicocele or nicotine by itself. This data would lend support to the cofactor hypothesis of the pathophysiology of the varicocele.\r"

A total of 54 oocytes from four couples experiencing failed fertilization by husband's sperm were reinseminated with donor sperm, resulting in 38 zygotes (70.4% fertilization). Four zygotes were transferred during ZIFT in each case and resulted in two (50%) continuing pregnancies. Additional zygotes from donor reinsemination were cryopreserved for each couple. Donor rescue expands the utility of ZIFT as a treatment for male factor infertility.\r"

Three groups were studied, performing the laparoscopy within 1, 3, and 5 days after ovulation. The results indicate that the opening in the corpus luteum remains at least during the first 1.5 postovulatory days. The process of the closure starts thereafter and has been accomplished 4 to 5 days after ovulation. Progesterone and E2 levels in PF follow a similar pattern, showing high levels in the first, decreasing levels in the second, and low levels in the last laparoscopy groups. Therefore the significance of inspection of the ovaries and hormone level estimation in PF depend on the timing of the laparoscopy in relation to the moment of ovulation, especially in the first 5 postovulatory days.\r"

  ".W": "The existence of a secretory immune system in the female genital tract has been demonstrated by the predominance of immunoglobulin (Ig)A-producing plasma cells in human fallopian tube, uterine cervix, and vagina. Epithelium lining fallopian tubes expresses a receptor for IgA, secretory component (SC), and thus resembles other secretory tissues such as intestine, mammary, lacrimal, and salivary glands. The present study extends the characterization of the local immune system in the fallopian tube and assesses its response to infection. We examined normal and infected fallopian tubes from surgical specimens, obtained at tubal ligation and abdominal hysterectomy, for the presence of Ig-producing cells, T cells, and natural killer cells. All tubular segments contained a predominance of IgA plasma cells in the subepithelial lamina propria. The epithelial cells were strongly positive for SC. Luminal contents stained positively for IgA, SC, and J chain, suggesting that this material contained secretory IgA. Submucosal plasma cells of IgM and IgG classes were less frequent than IgA. T cells were present in numbers approximately twofold greater than plasma cells in normal fallopian tubes. T-suppressor (CD8+) cells, which may function in the induction of immune tolerance, were present in the intraepithelial spaces. Infected segments of fallopian tubes demonstrated six- to tenfold increased numbers of plasma cells of all classes. These data suggest that a local immune system is functioning in the human fallopian tube and may provide a first line of defense against tubal infection and the prevention of tubal factor infertility.\r"

We therefore investigated the long-term safety of danazol by performing a retrospective chart review of 60 female patients with hereditary angioedema treated with danazol for a continuous period of 6 months or longer. The mean age of the patients was 35.2 years and the mean duration of therapy was 59.7 months. Virtually all patients experienced one or more adverse reactions. Menstrual abnormalities (79%), weight gain (60%), muscle cramps/myalgias (40%), and transaminase elevations (40%) were the most common adverse reactions. The drug was discontinued due to adverse reactions in 8 patients. No patient has died or suffered any apparent long-term sequelae that were directly attributable to the drug. We conclude that, despite a relatively high incidence of adverse reactions, danazol has proven to be remarkably safe over the long-term in this group of patients.\r"

Responses of 17-hydroxyprogesterone, which were markedly elevated compared with controls, were identical with CRF and ACTH. However, intravenous ACTH resulted in higher androstenedione levels in comparison to CRF. Adrenocorticotropin hormone also resulted in decreased cortisol responses, confirming a defect in steroidogenesis, a finding that was not evident with CRF. Plasma ACTH responses to CRF were similar in patients and controls. We conclude that CRF may be as useful as ACTH as a diagnostic test for adult onset 21-hydroxylase deficiency, and that because normal levels of plasma ACTH were evoked by CRF in 21-hydroxylase deficiency, lower doses of exogenous ACTH may be sufficient for making this diagnosis. Although no obvious hypothalamic-pituitary dysfunction could be demonstrated in our patients with 21-hydroxylase deficiency by using CRF, our data confirm the adrenal sensitivity of patients with adult onset 21-hydroxylase deficiency.\r"

To determine whether observer accuracy improves with experience or with use of the mean values obtained from a panel of observers, the visual readings of percent diameter stenosis and \"normal\" reference segment diameter were compared with the quantitative analyses of 13 randomly chosen coronary stenoses. Visual interpretation was also performed on cineangiograms of seven phantom stenoses ranging in severity from 17% to 83%. Repeated quantitative arteriography demonstrated good intraobserver variability for minimal stenosis diameter (r = 0.91, SD = 0.23 mm) and percent diameter stenosis (r = 0.93, SD = 6.4%). When the mean of the repeated quantitative analyses was used as the standard, visual interpretations of percent diameter stenosis were found to have considerable inaccuracy (r = 0.78, SD = 14.5%). Phantom percent diameter stenosis data were better correlated (r = 0.85), but accuracy remained poor (SD = 17.8%). Fifty percent narrowings were read over a range from 30% to 95%. Substantial inaccuracies were also found for observer assessment of normal reference segment diameter (r = 0.75, SD = 0.75 mm). Observer accuracy of percent stenosis did not correlate with prior angiographic experience but was progressively improved by taking the mean value of the interpretations of three and five experienced angiographers (r = 0.88, 0.89; SD = 11.3%, 8.3%, respectively). These findings suggest that arteriographic interpretations accurate enough for interventional decisions can only be obtained using quantitative arteriography or the mean value of data from a large panel of angiographers.\r"

Variables that best correlated with the occurrence of painless ischemia by quantitative scintigraphic criteria were examined. Fifty-nine patients (57%) had no angina on exercise testing. A significantly greater percent of patients with silent ischemia than of patients with angina had a recent myocardial infarction (31% versus 7%, p less than 0.01), had no prior angina (91% versus 64%, p less than 0.01), had dyspnea as an exercise test end point (56% versus 35%, p less than 0.05) and exhibited redistribution defects in the supply regions of the right and circumflex coronary arteries (50% versus 35%, p less than 0.05). The group with exercise angina had more ST depression (64% versus 41%, p less than 0.05) and more patients with four or more redistribution defects. However, there was no difference between the two groups with respect to mean total thallium-201 perfusion score, number of redistribution defects per patient, multi-vessel thallium redistribution pattern or extent of angiographic coronary artery disease. There was also no difference between the silent ischemia and angina groups with respect to antianginal drug usage, prevalence of diabetes mellitus, exercise duration, peak exercise heart rate, peak work load, peak double (rate-pressure) product and percent of patients achieving greater than or equal to 85% of maximal predicted heart rate for age. Thus, in this study group, there was a rather high prevalence rate of silent ischemia (57%) by exercise thallium-201 criteria.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The end-systolic stress/volume ratio is currently recognized as a relatively load-independent index of myocardial contractile performance, but its dependence on ventricular size may limit its value for interpatient comparisons. In this study, the relation between the end-systolic stress/volume ratio and left ventricular end-diastolic volume was angiographically analyzed in 104 patients with normal coronary angiograms. Eighteen patients had a normal ventricle, 24 had aortic stenosis, 18 had aortic regurgitation, 9 had mitral regurgitation and 35 had cardiomyopathy. An inverse relation between the end-systolic stress/volume ratio and left ventricular end-diastolic volume was demonstrated in the normal group (r = 0.72, p less than 0.001); subjects with a larger left ventricle had a reduced index but, presumably, the same degree of contractility as that of subjects with a smaller ventricle. Attempts to normalize values by using end-diastolic volume or body surface area were unsuccessful. A similar inverse relation was demonstrated in the aortic stenosis group (r = 0.48, p less than 0.05), probably because hypertrophy helps to keep wall stress normal or low despite progressive ventricular enlargement in these patients. The end-systolic stress/volume ratio was also inversely related to left ventricular chamber size in patients with volume overload due to aortic regurgitation (r = 0.80, p less than 0.001) and in those with cardiomyopathy (r = 0.84, p less than 0.001). However, at a given left ventricular end-diastolic volume, the end-systolic stress/volume ratio was higher in patients with aortic regurgitation than in those with cardiomyopathy, suggesting better contractile performance for a comparable degree of ventricular dilation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The purpose of this study is to provide information concerning the physiologic responses of normal healthy subjects to arm ergometry relative to age and gender, which could serve as a standard for comparison. Eighty healthy subjects (age 22 to 59 years) cycled at 75 to 80 rpm (on a bicycle adapted for arm ergometry) starting at a power output of 10 W, increasing at 10 W/2 min until exhaustion. Sixty subjects were classified on the basis of age into three groups, each with 10 men and 10 women. Men achieved significantly (p less than 0.001) higher power output (95 +/- 25 W) and oxygen consumption (20.7 +/- 3.9 ml/kg per min) than did women (56 +/- 19 W and 15.5 +/- 3.1 ml/kg per min, respectively). The heart rate response to total body oxygen demand during arm ergometry was significantly higher in women than in men (p less than 0.001). These findings were also present when men and women of each age group were analyzed separately. Older subjects reached a significantly (p less than 0.02) lower peak power output than did younger subjects although they reached a similar level of oxygen consumption. Separate regression equations for predicting oxygen consumption at each power output were formulated for men and women and validated in 20 other subjects. Small differences in measured and predicted oxygen consumption at each stage were found. These data provide additional information concerning arm ergometry testing and should prove useful in diagnostic exercise testing and cardiac rehabilitation.\r"

  ".W": "During an informal study in 1973 it was noted that approximately one third of patients with congenital heart disease lived in a small area in the Tucson Valley. In 1981 groundwater for a nearly identical area was found to be contaminated with trichloroethylene and to a lesser extent with dichloroethylene and chromium. Contamination probably began during the 1950s. Affected wells were closed after discovery of contamination. This sequence of events allowed investigation of the prevalence of congenital heart disease in children whose parents were exposed to the contaminated water area as compared with children whose parents were never exposed to the contaminated water area. The contaminated water area contained 8.8% of the Tucson Valley population and 4.5% of the labor force. Using their case registry, the authors interviewed parents of 707 children with congenital heart disease who, between 1969 and 1987, 1) conceived their child in the Tucson Valley, and 2) spent the month before the first trimester and the first trimester of the case pregnancy in the Tucson Valley. Two random dialing surveys showed that only 10.5% of the Tucson Valley population had ever had work or residence contact, or both, with the contaminated water area, whereas 35% of parents of children with congenital heart disease had had such contact (p less than 0.005). The prevalence of congenital cardiac disease (excluding syndromes, children with atrial tachycardia or premature infants with patent ductus arteriosus) in the Tucson Valley was 0.7% of live births and with syndromes was calculated to be 0.82%. The odds ratio for congenital heart disease for children of parents with contaminated water area contact during the period of active contamination was three times that for those without contact (p less than 0.005) and decreased to near unity for new arrivals in the contaminated water area after well closure. The proportion of infants with congenital heart disease as compared with the number of live births was significantly higher for resident mothers in the contaminated water area than for mothers with no exposure. No other environmental agent could be identified that was localized to the contaminated water area, but one could have been missed. The data show a significant association but not a cause and effect relation between parental exposure to the contaminated water area and an increased proportion of congenital heart disease among live births as compared with the proportion of congenital heart disease among live births for parents without contaminated water area contact.\r"

The reflex may be elicited by upright tilt with or without isoproterenol infusion. In this study, an upright 90 degree tilt protocol was evaluated in 20 young patients aged 7 to 22 years with syncope but with normal cardiac and neurologic evaluations. The electrocardiogram and blood pressure were noninvasively recorded at 1 min intervals while the patient was supine (5 to 10 min) and during tilt (15 min) in the baseline state. The protocol was repeated during isoproterenol infusion at increasing doses until symptoms of syncope or near syncope were provoked or the maximal isoproterenol dose was achieved (0.07 to 0.1 microgram/kg per min). Mean heart rate, mean blood pressure and RR interval variability, expressed as the standard deviation and the mean of the absolute difference between consecutive RR intervals, were assessed. Symptoms were elicited during tilt in 16 of the 20 patients (in 4 at baseline and in 12 with isoproterenol infusion); no symptoms were induced in 4 patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Increased regional left ventricular function frequently occurs in the nonischemic myocardium after acute coronary occlusion. To further define the regional and global effects of this increased remote function in the ischemic left ventricle, 22 dogs were studied with two-dimensional echocardiography before and 1 h after left circumflex coronary artery occlusion. Two groups of dogs were identified with and without compensatory increased regional left ventricular function, defined as regional wall thickening in the nonischemic zone greater than 2 SD above baseline. After coronary occlusion, nonischemic wall thickening was 76 +/- 15% in the hyperfunction group (n = 11) and 45 +/- 14% in the nonhyperfunction group (n = 11) (p less than 0.001). Despite similar left ventricular end-diastolic cavity areas and equivalent degrees of ischemic wall thinning, dogs with increased left ventricular function in the nonischemic myocardium had a smaller extent of circumferential left ventricular dysfunction (136 +/- 33 versus 170 +/- 43 degrees, p less than 0.001) and a higher area ejection fraction (38 +/- 9% versus 27 +/- 6%, p less than 0.001). These functional differences occurred despite similar myocardial areas at risk by autoradiography (41 +/- 6% versus 37 +/- 12%, p = NS). The data suggest that increased left ventricular function in the nonischemic myocardium determines the global functional impact of acute coronary occlusion and, through interaction with adjacent myocardium, modifies the extent of circumferential left ventricular dysfunction.\r"

  ".U": "90293288\r", 
  ".W": "Although coronary flow reserve is a well established measure of the physiologic significance of atherosclerotic stenosis, cumbersome methodology has prevented its widespread clinical application. This study evaluated a new simplified method of measuring coronary flow reserve based on indicator-dilution analysis of hand-injected digital coronary arteriograms. In five dogs, the circumflex artery was instrumented with an angiographic catheter, an electromagnetic flow probe and a pneumatic occluder. For each of 18 stenoses of varying severity, arteriograms were obtained under basal conditions and during papaverine-induced hyperemia. A pair of background-corrected arterial time-density curves was generated for each stenosis by off-line computer analysis of the circumflex artery arteriograms. Coronary flow reserve was calculated from the measured areas of the time-density curves and the known volume of contrast medium used to produce each curve. Angiographic flow reserve ranged from 0.9 to 6.1 (mean 2.99), whereas electromagnetic flow reserve ranged from 0.7 to 6.9 (mean 3.02). Angiographic and electromagnetic measurements of coronary flow reserve correlated well (r = 0.86). This study establishes that indicator-dilution analysis of 30 frames/s digital coronary arteriography permits the accurate determination of coronary flow reserve. The technique described employs hand injection of small doses of radiographic contrast medium using conventional catheters, and should be readily applicable to the study of human coronary artery disease.\r"

  ".W": "Currently there is no large animal model of dilated cardiomyopathy. The smaller animal models of cardiomyopathy, such as the Syrian hamster, cannot be studied with echocardiography and cardiac catheterization, and the relevance of these models to human dilated cardiomyopathy is open to question. On the basis of some initial observations in Doberman pinschers, it was speculated that these dogs could have occult left ventricular dysfunction. Accordingly, studies were performed in 46 apparently healthy Doberman pinschers and in 41 mongrel dogs: two-dimensional echocardiography (30 dogs in each group), cardiac catheterization (16 Doberman pinschers and 12 mongrels) and coronary blood flow studies (13 Doberman pinschers and 6 mongrels). In the awake, unsedated dogs studied with echocardiography, left ventricular wall thickening was significantly less in the Dobermans than in the mongrels (28% versus 36%, p = 0.0003). In the anesthetized dogs undergoing cardiac catheterization, left ventricular ejection fraction was significantly lower in the Dobermans than in the mongrels (0.38 versus 0.63, p = 0.0001). Rest coronary blood flow and coronary blood flow reserve were similar in the two groups. It is concluded that apparently healthy Doberman pinschers have occult left ventricular dysfunction. These dogs may serve as a large animal model of dilated cardiomyopathy and should not be used experimentally to study normal cardiac physiology.\r"

  ".U": "90293293\r", 
  ".W": "Chordal rupture with a subsequent flail mitral valve leaflet is now the most common cause of pure mitral regurgitation. To describe the Doppler color flow findings in flail mitral leaflet and the determinants of these findings, Doppler color flow mapping and conventional Doppler echocardiography were performed in 31 consecutive patients presenting with a flail mitral leaflet. In the 23 patients with a posterior flail leaflet, a distinctive highly eccentric and turbulent jet directed toward the posterior wall of the aorta was noted. In the eight patients with an anterior flail leaflet, a jet directed toward the posterolateral left atrial wall was noted. Maximal regurgitant jet area was significantly larger in patients with a flail anterior leaflet (13.1 +/- 3.0 cm2) than in those with a flail posterior leaflet (5.8 +/- 3.0 cm2, p = 0.0001). Maximal jet area to left atrial ratio was also significantly higher in those with a flail anterior leaflet (0.56 +/- 0.16) than in those with a flail posterior leaflet (0.27 +/- 0.17, p = 0.0006). When systolic left atrial velocities encoded as red were incorporated into the maximal jet area measurement, 7 of the 8 patients with an anterior flail leaflet had a jet area greater than 8 cm2, consistent with severe mitral regurgitation, compared with 13 of the 23 patients with a flail posterior leaflet. There was no correlation between jet area or jet area to left atrial ratio and any hemodynamic variable. Patients with acute mitral regurgitation exhibited a trend toward smaller jet areas, but this did not reach statistical significance. Regurgitant fraction calculated from pulsed Doppler recording of mitral and aortic flow was consistent with moderately severe or severe mitral regurgitation in all cases and averaged 70%. Thus, patients with a flail mitral valve leaflet have distinctive Doppler color flow findings. A highly eccentric and turbulent jet directed posteriorly to the aorta may contribute to a systematic underestimation of severe mitral regurgitation by conventional Doppler color flow criteria. The use of pulsed Doppler ultrasound to calculate regurgitant fraction in patients with a flail mitral valve leaflet may be helpful in reliably assessing the degree of mitral regurgitation.\r"

Conduct of Research To ensure that accepted laboratory and research practices are followed and that all data are accurately collected and properly recorded; the investigator must participate in the review of original data. To carry out research in accordance with that approved by the institutional review board and ensure that fully informed consent is obtained, that the welfare of human subjects is protected and that animal welfare and laboratory safety procedures are carried out. To provide effective ongoing supervision of research trainees and technicians.

The late mortality rate after endocardial resection was 19%. There were two late cardiac-related deaths (unrelated to arrhythmias) and three late deaths from noncardiac causes.

The mean number of major arrhythmic episodes per patient was 15 (range 2 to 200) and of drug failures 4 +/- 2. Left ventricular function was severely impaired in the majority (ejection fraction 29%; range 14% to 47%) and 18 patients (66%) had a left ventricular aneurysm. Endocardial resection guided by a combination of endocardial activation mapping during tachycardia and fragmentation mapping during sinus rhythm was performed in all patients. All electrically abnormal left ventricular endocardium was excised. Eight patients (29.6%) died within 30 days of surgery. Death was not related to age, time of surgery after infarction, ventricular function, bypass time or type of arrhythmia. Patients requiring emergency surgery had a higher early postoperative mortality rate than did those undergoing planned surgery (43% versus 15%). During a follow-up period of 32 +/- 20 months, there have been no arrhythmic deaths and only three patients (16%) have required antiarrhythmic drug therapy. When required in the early weeks after infarction, surgery for ventricular arrhythmias offers a high cure rate at a risk related to the patient's preoperative arrhythmia frequency, which in turn relates to the risk of arrhythmic death.\r"

A total of 573 episodes with ST segment depression were documented: in 118 episodes (21%) the patients were symptomatic and in 455 (79%) they remained asymptomatic. Ventricular arrhythmias (greater than 5 premature ventricular beats/min, bigeminy, couplets or salvos of premature ventricular beats) occurred during 27 (5%) ischemic episodes in a subset of 10 patients (10%) (group A). The other 87 patients (90%) (group B) showed exclusively ischemic episodes without ventricular arrhythmias. Comparison of patients in group A and group B showed no differences in hemodynamic, angiographic, exercise testing and ambulatory ECG monitoring data. Ischemic episodes with and without ventricular arrhythmias showed a similar duration and amplitude of ST segment depression and a comparable heart rate at the onset of ischemia. Both types of ischemic episodes, with and without arrhythmias, occurred predominantly during the morning hours between 6:00 AM and noon, and both types remained asymptomatic to within similar percentages. The data demonstrate that ventricular arrhythmias are related to transient myocardial ischemia in only a few patients with stable angina pectoris; these arrhythmias are related neither to the degree of ischemia during ambulatory ECG monitoring nor to the occurrence of anginal symptoms.\r"

Angioplasty was successful in 143 patients (66%), unsuccessful but uncomplicated in 65 (30%) and complicated in 9 (4%) by one or more of the following criteria: Q wave myocardial infarction (2%), emergency surgery (4%) or death (0.5%). Late follow-up evaluation was obtained in 213 patients at a mean of 9 +/- 1 years. Of patients in whom angioplasty was successful, 59 (42%) of 140 required another revascularization procedure (repeat angioplasty in 26% and bypass surgery in 16%). The actuarial survival rate at 5, 9 and 10 years after successful angioplasty was 98%, 93% and 92%, respectively. Of the 65 patients with unsuccessful and uncomplicated angioplasty (usually as a result of technical factors), 58 underwent elective bypass surgery within 2 months and 56 survived. These 56 surgical patients were compared with the 140 patients with successful angioplasty. Univariate analysis of prognostic factors did not reveal significant differences between these two groups. At late follow-up study, the successful angioplasty and the successful surgical groups had similar rates of survival (93% versus 95%, p = NS) and of death or infarction, or both (11% versus 12.5%, p = NS). Repeat revascularization was required more frequently after successful angioplasty than after surgery (42% versus 18%, p less than 0.001). Crossover from angioplasty to surgery occurred slightly more often than from surgery to angioplasty (16% versus 12.5%, p = NS). The time to crossover from angioplasty to surgery occurred earlier than from surgery to angioplasty (mean 21 versus 76 months, p less than 0.001).\r"

Patients who met the standard diagnostic criteria for Marfan's syndrome were deliberately excluded. Sixty-eight percent of the patients had a diastolic murmur and chest roentgenogram revealed a dilated aortic arch in 58% and cardiomegaly in 63%. Cardiac catheterization in 76 patients demonstrated aortic root dilation in 78%, aortic regurgitation in 72%, aortic dissection in 32% and coronary artery disease in 32%. Ninety patients underwent surgery including composite graft repair with reimplantation of the coronary arteries in 34%. Follow-up, obtained on 90 (97%) of the 93 patients, ranged in duration from 0 to 137 months (mean 29). Thirty-four of the 90 patients died (age range 30 to 75 years, mean 60). Ninety-four percent of the known causes of death were related to the cardiovascular system; 65% were the result of aortic dissection or rupture or sudden death. Ninety-six percent of survivors were in New York Heart Association functional class I or II. Overall estimated survival at 1, 3 and 5 years was 72.2%, 63.5% and 57.4%, respectively. Actuarial survival in patients who underwent composite graft reconstruction was 84% at 5 years. The presence of a diastolic murmur at initial presentation was associated with a poor prognosis (p = 0.03).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Such \"inappropriate\" vasoconstriction also occurs with exercise, which causes intense vasoconstriction of coronary artery segments narrowed by atherosclerosis. This study was done to assess the cocaine-induced change in vasomotor tone of diseased and nondiseased coronary artery segments. In 18 patients (15 men, 3 women, aged 35 to 67 years), coronary artery areas in diseased and nondiseased segments were quantitated before and 15 min after administration of intranasal saline solution (6 patients) or cocaine (2 mg/kg body weight) (12 patients). No variables changed after intake of the saline solution. In response to cocaine, the luminal areas of diseased and nondiseased segments decreased, but the magnitude of vasoconstriction was greater in the diseased segments (mean +/- SD 29 +/- 23% versus 13 +/- 8%, p less than 0.05). Thus, cocaine causes vasoconstriction of diseased and nondiseased coronary artery segments, but its effect is particularly marked in the former.\r"

To test the hypothesis that even at low levels of work, patients exhibit a lower VO2 than do normal subjects, 77 patients with heart failure and 27 control subjects with a normal heart or with disease other than heart failure underwent bicycle exercise with respiratory gas analysis. Work load was increased by 10 W/min from an initial 20 W. VO2 (ml/min per kg) was measured every 15 s. The delta VO2/delta W ratio was significantly reduced only in the most severely impaired patients in heart failure class C-D (8.75 +/- 2.14 versus 11.05 +/- 0.38, p less than 0.05). Class B patients showed a lower ratio at a work load of greater than or equal to 80 W, whereas class C-D patients manifested a lower ratio at greater than or equal to 20 W. Even with a low incremental work rate protocol, compared with sedentary normal subjects or patients without heart failure, patients with heart failure demonstrate impaired oxygen uptake. This observation suggests the presence of anaerobic metabolism or delayed VO2 uptake, or both; accordingly, indirect estimates of VO2 requirements derived from intensity or duration of exercise in such patients are overestimated.\r"

During 24 h Holter electrocardiographic monitoring, mean ventricular rate (beats/min) decreased from 88 +/- 14 with placebo to 76 +/- 13 (p less than 0.001) with diltiazem and 80 +/- 11 (p less than 0.01) with verapamil. Maximal symptom-limited exercise tolerance (W) increased from 127 +/- 39 during the placebo period to 136 +/- 42 (p less than 0.01) with diltiazem and 137 +/- 39 (p less than 0.01) with verapamil. Ventricular rate and rate-pressure product were lower at rest and during exercise with diltiazem and verapamil than with placebo (p less than 0.001), with the drugs being similarly effective. Ventricular rate at maximal exercise (beats/min) was 179 +/- 13 with placebo compared with 159 +/- 21 with diltiazem and 158 +/- 23 with verapamil. Maximal oxygen uptake (ml/kg per min) was 22.3 +/- 4.5 with placebo, 23.7 +/- 4.9 (p less than 0.05) with diltiazem and 22.9 +/- 4.5 with verapamil (p = NS). Respiratory gas exchange anaerobic threshold was reached at a work load (W) of 76 +/- 21 with placebo, 84 +/- 27 (p less than 0.05) with diltiazem and 85 +/- 23 (p less than 0.01) with verapamil. In conclusion, patients with chronic atrial fibrillation have modestly improved exercise tolerance with calcium channel blockade therapy. The dromotropic responses and the effects on physical performance are of similar magnitude for diltiazem and verapamil.\r"

Free T4 index was normal in all patients. Free T3 index was reduced or reverse T3 elevated, or both, leading to a low free T3 index/reverse T3 ratio in 49 (58%) of the 84 patients. A low free T3 index/reverse T3 ratio was associated with higher right atrial, pulmonary artery and pulmonary capillary wedge pressures and lower ejection fraction, cardiac index, serum sodium, albumin and total lymphocyte count. In multivariate analysis, the free T3 index/reverse T3 ratio was the only independent predictor of poor 6 week outcome (p less than 0.001); the actuarial 1 year survival rate was 100% for patients with a normal ratio and only 37% for those with a low ratio (p less than 0.0001). A low free T3 index/reverse T3 ratio is associated with poor ventricular function and nutritional status and is the strongest predictor yet identified for short-term outcome in patients with advanced heart failure.\r"

Despite its specificity, the sensitivity of right ventricular biopsy remains uncertain because of the focal or multifocal nature of the disease. Because myocyte necrosis is an obligate component of myocarditis, the use of indium-111 antimyosin imaging was evaluated in 82 patients with suspected myocarditis. Seventy-four patients had dilated cardiomyopathy of less than 1 year's duration (mean left ventricular ejection fraction 0.30 +/- 0.02); eight patients had normal left ventricular function (mean ejection fraction 0.59 +/- 0.03). Symptoms at presentation included congestive heart failure (92%), chest pain mimicking myocardial infarction (6%) and life-threatening ventricular tachyarrhythmias (2%). All patients underwent planar and single photon emission computed tomographic (SPECT) cardiac imaging after injection of indium-111-labeled antimyosin antibody fragments and right ventricular biopsy within 48 h of imaging. Antimyosin images were interpreted as either abnormal or normal and correlated with biopsy results. On the basis of the right ventricular histologic examination, the sensitivity of antimyosin imaging was 83%, specificity 53% and predictive value of a normal scan 92%. Improvement in left ventricular function occurred within 6 months of treatment in 54% of patients with an abnormal antimyosin scan compared with 18% of those with a normal scan (p less than 0.01). Antimyosin cardiac imaging may be useful for the initial evaluation of patients with dilated and nondilated cardiomyopathy and clinically suspected myocarditis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To determine if advanced age is associated with increased mortality independent of severity of illness, we compared older and middle-aged patients admitted to a medical intensive care unit. We reviewed the charts of 130 patients age 75 years or older and 135 patients age 55 to 65 admitted over a 30-month period. We controlled for severity of illness using the Acute Physiology Assessment and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE II) system without including points for age (APACHE IIM). The groups were similar with regard to gender, whether or not they had a private attending physician, mean APACHE IIM score, and diagnoses, except that older patients had more chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Hospital stay was slightly longer in the older group (37 vs. 39 days, rank sum, P less than .02). Hospital mortality was significantly greater in the older group (39% vs. 51%, Chi-square P less than .05) with a crude relative risk of 1.32 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.01, 1.73). However, the relation of age group to mortality differed for patients with different diagnoses. When we used logistic regression to adjust for APACHE IIM, whether the patient had a private attending physician, primary admitting diagnosis, or presence of cancer, older patients did not have a significantly greater risk of dying (adjusted relative risk, 1.05; 95% CI: 0.97, 1.12). When pulmonary artery catheterization was added to the model, it independently predicted mortality adjusted relative risk, 1.47; 95% CI: 1.05, 2.06.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Platelet alpha 2-receptor numbers were significantly lower in the older subjects at 289 +/- 79 fmol/mg protein versus 388 +/- 81 fmol/mg protein in the younger subjects (P less than .01), compatible with but not proof of down-regulation by norepinephrine. However, Kd, representing receptor affinity, was similar in both groups. Therefore, studies of hormone and receptor status in various pathologic conditions should always take into account the normal changes attributable to the age of the subject population.\r"

Because the liver is intimately involved in metabolism and storage of metals, it may provide a useful site for study of these metals in AD. This study compares livers in AD and controls in their concentrations of zinc, copper, cadmium, and metallothionein, a metal-binding protein important in regulation of metal metabolism. Liver tissue was obtained from 17 patients with AD and 17 age- and sex-matched controls within 12 hours of death and stored at -70 degrees C. Neuropathologic confirmation of diagnosis was available in all cases. Liver homogenates (20%) were used for metal analysis by atomic absorption spectroscopy after wet digestion. Cytosolic metallothionein levels were quantitated by the cadmium or silver saturation method. A significant decline in body and liver weight was found in patients with AD, with no significant change in liver protein or DNA concentration. Total hepatic cadmium (P less than .001) and zinc (P less than .030) concentrations were significantly elevated in AD. The Sephadex G75 chromatographic profile was altered in AD with reduction in zinc bound to metallothionein fractions and increased binding to high molecular weight fractions. These data suggest that the metabolism of cadmium and zinc is altered in AD.\r"

Definite impairments were demonstrated in 7% to 23% of patients (depending on the function being assessed), and borderline abnormal results were common as well. Overall, 56% of patients had at least one meaningful impairment identified. Few of these problems had been recognized before the survey. Assessment required 10 to 15 minutes of interviewer time per patient (approximately 22 minutes for each problem newly uncovered). A simple education and information intervention led to physicians addressing the newly identified problem in 30% to 55% of cases. These results suggest that formal geriatric assessment instruments provide an efficient mechanism for case finding in older medical outpatients. Further studies are necessary to determine whether such interventions will lead to improved outcomes in older medical outpatients.\r"

Several studies have presented evidence to show that immune dysfunction in aged mice and humans may be due to a defect in the production of interleukin 2 (IL2) by helper T cells (TH). Cultures of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were prepared from blood samples taken at eight weeks after vaccination (0.5 mL of Armand-Frappier, 15 micrograms/0.5 mL each of A/Taiwan/1/86, A/Leningrad/360/86, and B/Ann Arbor/1/86 administered in the fall of 1987) from a group of elderly men and a young control group. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were frozen in 10% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) until all the cells were cultured. After stimulation with a 1/320 dilution of the same influenza vaccine, cultures of PBMC from young controls showed a significantly greater increase in IL2 production than the cultures of PBMC from the elderly group of patients. This was statistically significant at both day 3 (P less than .01) and day 5 (P less than .05) of culture using the Mann-Whitney U test. Previous experiments that have shown defective IL2 production related to aging have used potent mitogens such as concanavalin A and phytohemagglutinin to stimulate TH. This study provides evidence that defective IL2 production may also occur in response to physiologic antigenic stimulation and may be one explanation for the reduced efficacy of influenza vaccination in elderly persons.\r"

Compared with previously reported long-term institutional outbreaks of RSV, there were significantly fewer cases of pneumonia (5% vs. 14% to 55%) and deaths (2% vs. 6% to 20%). However, morbidity was substantial in this outbreak, with 46% of patients suffering prolonged malaise and anorexia; the mean duration of symptoms was four weeks. Respiratory syncytial virus may be an important cause of respiratory illness in nursing homes and may be unappreciated if specific diagnostic methods are not employed. The recent availability of rapid diagnostic tests and specific antiviral therapy for RSV warrant further clinical studies to develop management strategies for this infection.\r"

Tissue diagnoses were glomerulopathy (n = 252, 75.4%), acute tubular lesions (n = 18), interstitial nephritis (n = 23), vascular diseases (n = 36, including 14 with cholesterol emboli), and five miscellaneous diagnoses. Of the 55 patients with ARF, 23 had a glomerular lesion, 15 had acute tubular necrosis, and 8 had acute interstitial nephritis. Of 72 patients with SRF, 49 had a glomerulopathy, 12 had a vascular disorder, and six had acute interstitial nephritis. Hence, patients with ARF or SRF exhibited a high potential for reversible lesions. Only 11.3% of patients with CRF had potentially reversible causes. The most common causes of proteinuria were membranous glomerulopathy (34.3%), minimal change disease (14.6%), focal segmental sclerosis (11.7%), and amyloidosis (8.8%). Of the 25 patients with advanced nephrosclerosis, 24 had renal failure, 20 were hypertensive, and 13 had cholesterol emboli. Of 33 patients with diabetes mellitus, 66.7% were found to have lesions not related to diabetes. We conclude that renal biopsy is most useful in older patients with ARF or SRF because of potentially reversible renal disease. Old age alone is not a contraindication to performing a renal biopsy.\r"
