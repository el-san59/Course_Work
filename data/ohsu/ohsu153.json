  ".W": "The cheetah in the wild is \"racing towards extinction\" mostly due to habitat destruction. Its survival will probably depend on accelerated captive breeding. At this time, however, reproductive failure and liver disease threaten the future of the captive cheetah population. Histopathological evaluation of more than 100 cheetah livers identified venocclusive disease as the main hepatic lesion responsible for liver disease in this species. Analysis of the commercial feline diet by high-performance liquid chromatography and gas-liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry revealed large amounts of two phytoestrogens identified as daidzein and genistein. These compounds were found to be derived from a soybean product that was a component of the cheetah diet, and their concentrations both ranged from 18 to 35 micrograms/g diet. The adult cheetah consequently consumes approximately 50 mg/day of these weak estrogens. When extracts of the diet were tested for estrogenicity using a bioassay, a dose-related increase in uterine weight was observed. In 4 cheetahs studied, withdrawal of this feline diet by substitution with a chicken diet resulted in an improvement in conventional liver function tests and a normalization in the appearance of hepatic mitochondria. We conclude that the relatively high concentrations of phytoestrogens from soybean protein present in the commercial diet fed to captive cheetahs in North American zoos may be one of the major factors in the decline of fertility and in the etiology of liver disease in this species. The survival of the captive cheetah population could depend upon a simple change of diet by excluding exogenous estrogen.\r"

  ".U": "87247926\r", 
  ".W": "To investigate whether paracentesis could be an alternative therapy for ascites, 117 cirrhotics with tense ascites were randomly allocated into two groups. Fifty-eight patients (group 1) were treated with paracentesis (4-6 L/day until disappearance of ascites) and intravenous albumin infusion (40 g after each tap). Fifty-nine patients (group 2) were treated with spironolactone (200-400 mg/day) plus furosemide (40-240 mg/day). Patients from group 2 not responding to diuretics were treated with a LeVeen shunt. After disappearance of ascites, patients from both groups were discharged from hospital and were instructed to take diuretics. Patients developing tense ascites during follow-up were readmitted to hospital and treated according to their initial schedule. Paracentesis was effective in eliminating the ascites in 56 patients from group 1 (96.5%) and did not induce significant changes in renal and hepatic function, plasma volume, cardiac index, peripheral resistance, plasma renin activity, plasma norepinephrine and antidiuretic hormone concentration, and urinary excretion of prostaglandin E2 and 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha. Diuretics were effective in eliminating the ascites in 43 patients from group 2 (72.8%) (p less than 0.05). Ten patients in group 1 and 36 in group 2 developed complications during their first hospital stay (p less than 0.001). This difference was due to the significantly higher incidence of hepatic encephalopathy, renal impairment, and electrolyte disturbances occurring in patients treated with diuretics. The duration of hospital stay was 11.7 +/- 1.5 days for patients from group 1 and 31 +/- 2.8 days for patients from group 2 (p less than 0.001). The two groups did not differ significantly with respect to the probability of requiring readmission to hospital during follow-up, reasons for readmission, survival probability after entry into the study, and causes of death. These results indicate that paracentesis associated with intravenous albumin infusion is a fast, effective, and safe therapy for ascites in patients with cirrhosis.\r"

Prominent fibrosis and hepatocellular regeneration were also present; however, the lobular architecture was preserved.

An autoimmune pathogenesis of the bile duct destruction is suggested.\r"

In the present study, we prospectively evaluated the role of sonography in the diagnosis of biliary ascariasis and its utility in monitoring the exit of worms from the bile duct. Sonography was performed on 28 patients with biliary ascariasis proven by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography. The bile ducts were dilated on sonography in 26 patients. The characteristic sonographic features of worms in the bile duct were as follows: (a) a single, long, linear or curved echogenic structure without acoustic shadowing (2 patients); (b) multiple, long, linear, parallel echogenic strips, usually without acoustic shadowing (15 patients); (c) a thick, long, linear or curved, nonshadowing echogenic strip containing a central, longitudinal anechoic tube, probably representing the digestive tract of the worm (7 patients); and (d) characteristic movement of these long echogenic structures within the bile duct (8 patients). One patient with pancreatic ascariasis exhibited long, linear, nonshadowing echogenic strips in a dilated pancreatic duct. Other sonographic changes observed in these patients were (a) gallbladder distention (10 patients), edema of the gallbladder wall (8 patients), sludge within the gallbladder (11 patients), a coiled echogenic structure within the gallbladder (1 patient); (b) multiple liver abscesses (1 patient); and (c) edematous pancreatitis (4 patients). Sonography detected worms in the biliary tree in 24 of 28 patients (85.7%). Serial sonograms accurately demonstrated the spontaneous exit of worms in 18 patients and the persistence of worms in 3 patients. Sonography is a simple, rapid, and noninvasive method for diagnosis and follow-up of patients with biliary ascariasis.\r"

Visualization or isolation of gastric Campylobacter-like organisms (GCLOs) is significantly associated with histologic evidence of gastritis, especially of the antrum. Correlation with peptic ulceration also exists but probably is due to concurrent antral gastritis. Outbreaks of hypochlorhydria with concomitant gastritis have been attributed to GCLO infection, and a human volunteer became ill after ingesting C. pylori. Despite rapid microbiologic characterization of the organisms and the epidemiology, pathology, and serology of infection, the pathogenetic significance of GCLOs remains unknown. Whether GCLOs cause, colonize, or worsen gastritis must be considered an unanswered question at present. The efficacy of antimicrobial treatment of GCLO infection on the natural history of gastritis is not presently resolved. Nevertheless, GCLOs are at the least an important marker of inflammatory gastroduodenal disease, and attempts to ascertain their clinical significance are clearly warranted.\r"

Recent studies have shown that acute gastric ulcers occur with approximately the same frequency as in patients taking wax matrix KCl formulations. The development of acute gastric ulcers was not consistent with the proposed dispersion characteristics of the microencapsulated KCl preparation. The authors therefore endoscopically evaluated the dispersion characteristics of microencapsulated KCl in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Subjects received four capsules of Micro-K or matching placebo and endoscopy was performed 30, 60, or 120 min after each drug ingestion. The material was identified with the Olympus HM (high magnification) endoscope and then quantitatively aspirated using the 3.5-mm biopsy channel of the Pentax 34JA endoscope. Microencapsulated KCl particles dispersed poorly and were found adhering to the mucosa and to one another, as a semisolid mass, most frequently in the gastric antrum. In contrast, the placebo (ethyl cellulose) was widely dispersed throughout the stomach. The authors concluded that gastric emptying must be considered in three phases: liquids, solids, and solids which adhere to the mucosa. No unique dispersion characteristics of Micro-K Extencaps were identified, and adherence of the KCl to the gastric mucosa may explain its ability to cause occasional acute gastric ulceration.\r"

At the endoscopic examination, performed before and after the 4- or 8-week treatment, three biopsy samples were taken from the ulcer edge or from the healed tissue. Ulcer infiltration by Candida was presumed by the presence of mycetes in stained tissue samples. Healing rate was 76% at 4 weeks and 89.9% at 8 weeks. Candida infiltration was not seen in any biopsy specimen. Short-term treatment with cimetidine does not promote invasion of mycetes into the duodenal ulcer lesion.\r"

Algorithms for dose adjustments of renally excreted drugs are available, but dose adjustments must be empiric for drugs which undergo hepatic metabolism. Decreased drug clearance in combination with potentially increased sensitivity to drugs in the elderly means that, as a general rule, drug dosages should be reduced as the age of the patient increases. The frequent need for multi-drug therapy may also lead to adverse effects in the elderly compared with younger cardiac patients. Managing the geriatric patient requires careful drug monitoring and a heightened awareness of the potential for adverse drug effects.\r"

A similar number of cyclical periods of antroduodenal motor activity (GOR 94 and control 91) was studied in each group. Mean antral cycle times and the frequency of occurrence of related proximal duodenal contractions (antroduodenal coordination) were similar. Transpyloric fluid movement occurred as a number of discrete episodes in each cycle. Gastroduodenal flow was more frequent in the GOR group (mean 2.7 +/- 0.4 episodes per cycle) than in controls (mean 1.7 +/- 0.3). The mean duration of these episodes in both groups was similar at around 2.5 seconds. Duodenogastric flow (reflux) was observed in many cycles (GOR 63%; controls 54%), but there was no difference in the mean number of episodes per cycle (GOR 0.79; control 0.74) or their mean duration (two seconds for both). Transpyloric fluid flow only occurs when a pressure gradient is created across the open pylorus. These observations indicate that in GOR the gastroduodenal pressure gradient is positive more frequently than in normal controls. Gastroduodenal liquid flow but not duodenogastric reflux differs in GOR patients and controls.\r"

Overall 51% of adenomas were positive for Cal9-9. Antigen expression correlated significantly with increasing size (p less than 0.001), synchronicity with colorectal cancer (p less than 0.001), severe dysplasia (p less than 0.001) and villous typing (p less than 0.003). Discriminate analysis using the first three variables correctly classified 79% of positive and 89% of negative Cal9-9 results. The similar frequency of antigen expression seen in colorectal cancers and their synchronous adenoma suggests a field change in the tumour bearing colon. Adenomas positive for Cal9-9 may have a greater malignant potential for carcinomatous change.\r"

Before and after radical operation (removal of adenoma in primary aldosteronism and percutaneous transluminal angioplasty in renovascular hypertension), dietary NaCl intake was altered from 10 to 13 g/day in Week 1 to 1 to 3 g/day in Week 2. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) and urinary sodium excretion were measured on the last 3 days of each week. By restricting sodium intake before operation, MAP was reduced from 122 +/- 7 to 113 +/- 7 mm Hg (p less than 0.025) in primary aldosteronism but not in renovascular hypertension (130 +/- 6 to 128 +/- 5 mm Hg). The renal function curve was drawn by plotting urinary sodium excretion on the ordinate and MAP on the abscissa before and after operation. The slope of the curve was analyzed between the plotted points, and each curve was extrapolated to zero sodium excretion as an estimate of the degree of shift of the curve along the MAP axis. Before, as compared with after operation, the extrapolated x-intercept of the curve was shifted rightward in both primary aldosteronism (111 +/- 7 vs 87 +/- 4 mm Hg; p less than 0.025) and renovascular hypertension (128 +/- 5 vs 95 +/- 2 mm Hg; p less than 0.025) and the slope was depressed in primary aldosteronism (16 +/- 1 vs 40 +/- 17 [mEq/day]/mm Hg; p less than 0.025) but not in renovascular hypertension (130 +/- 75 vs 40 +/- 13 [mEq/day]/mm Hg).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Adrenalectomized rats have low plasma prorenin levels accompanied by high renin activity, suggesting enhanced prorenin activation by the action of a stimulated \"convertase\" mechanism. Cross-circulation between adrenalectomized and nephrectomized rats for 15 or 30 minutes, dramatically lowered prorenin and raised renin levels in both types of rats, suggesting extensive activation of prorenin to renin. Similarly, in vitro mixing of these bloods (without cross-circulation) raised renin activity over five times the expected calculated level, while prorenin essentially disappeared. In both cases, prorenin from nephrectomized rat plasma apparently was activated to renin by the enhanced action of \"convertase\" in the adrenalectomized rat plasma. This newly generated renin activity was, like normal plasma renin, almost completely inhibited by a monoclonal antibody against hog renin and generated an immunoreactive angiotensin I. In contrast, cross-circulation or in vitro mixing of blood from normal control and nephrectomized rats produced little detectable activation of prorenin and only modest increments of renin, suggesting relative inactivity of the \"convertase\" mechanism in normal plasma. Our data suggest that activation of plasma prorenin is a significant regulated pathway for renin production, as it is greatly stimulated after adrenalectomy and deficient after nephrectomy, thereby implicating the kidney as an important contributor to the \"convertase\" mechanism operating within the circulation.\r"

  ".W": "Release of arachidonic acid from membrane phospholipids is a limiting step in the synthesis of both cyclooxygenase products and lipoxygenase products. The direct effects of prostacyclin and some lipoxygenase products on renin release were studied using rat renal cortical slices. Prostacyclin, at concentrations of 10(-5) M, stimulated renin secretion, but this effect was short-lived. Leukotrienes or their precursor, 5-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid, did not affect basal renin release. In contrast, 10(-9) M 12-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid and 10(-8) M 12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid were potent inhibitors of renin secretion. Similarly, 15-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid and its hydroxy derivative, 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid, at somewhat higher molar concentrations (10(-6) M) also reduced basal renin. These studies confirm prostacyclin as a potential renin secretagogue; however, its action in vitro is transient, probably because of its rapid degradation. Our studies provide new evidence that products of the 12-lipoxygenase and 15-lipoxygenase pathways, reported to be present in renal vascular tissue, are potent inhibitors of renin secretion and much more active on a molar basis on renin secretion than is prostacyclin. These studies suggest the potential presence of a dual system of stimulation and suppression that may regulate renin secretion in normal and clinical states.\r"

  ".W": "Since it is not known for certain which alpha-adrenergic receptors mediate renal vasoconstriction in human essential hypertension, we infused either doxazosin (n = 7) or yohimbine (n = 7) into the renal arteries of hypertensive subjects immediately prior to diagnostic angiography. Both agents caused an increment in renal blood flow as assessed with the xenon-washout technique. Doxazosin increased renal flow from 342 +/- 36 to 360 +/- 55 ml/min per 100 g (0.05 less than p less than 0.10). Yohimbine enhanced flow from 380 +/- 41 to 485 +/- 63 ml/min per 100 g (p less than 0.01). The effect of yohimbine was significantly greater than that of doxazosin. In a control group (n = 7) receiving only saline, no changes in renal blood flow occurred. Doxazosin enhanced renin secretion in the kidney by 10 +/- 4% over levels in controls (0.05 less than p less than 0.10), whereas yohimbine increased renin release by 80 +/- 23% (p less than 0.01). The latter increase was apparently not due to alterations in flow alone, since the arteriovenous gradient for renin also widened. We conclude that in resting conditions, neurogenic vascular tone in the kidney depends mainly upon activation of alpha 2-adrenergic receptors. Moreover, these receptors exert a tonic inhibitory influence on renin release.\r"

Two weeks of intragastric administration of cyclosporin A (5 mg/kg/day or or 20 mg/kg/day) resulted in large increases in plasma renin concentration (23 +/- 5, 70 +/- 12, and 79 +/- 11 ng/ml/hr in control rats and rats receiving 5 mg and 20 mg of cyclosporin A, respectively), with no parallel increments in plasma aldosterone. In vitro angiotensin II (ANG II)-stimulated aldosterone secretion by zona glomerulosa cells obtained from cyclosporin A-treated rats was also reduced (4.8 +/- 0.5, 1.5 +/- 0.2, and 0.2 +/- 0.2 ng/10(5) cells in control rats and rats receiving 5 mg and 20 mg of cyclosporin A, respectively). In contrast, in vitro aldosterone response to graded increments of potassium (3.7-10.7 mmol/L) or adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) (10(-11)-10(-8) M) was preserved in cyclosporin A-treated rats. When added in vitro to zona glomerulosa cells from untreated rats, cyclosporin A also attenuated ANG II-stimulated aldosterone secretion, but did not affect potassium or ACTH-mediated aldosterone production. Thus, cyclosporin A-induced hyperreninemic hypoaldosteronism in the rat depends on opposing renal and adrenal effects, with a direct or feedback stimulation of renin secretion and a specific blockade of ANG II-mediated aldosterone production.\r"

We have employed the mouse submandibular gland renin complementary DNA (pDD-1D2) and the rat liver angiotensinogen complementary DNA (pRang 3) to demonstrate that renin and angiotensinogen messenger RNAs are expressed in the mouse kidney, submandibular gland, heart, adrenal, brain, and testis. To elucidate the factors that influence local tissue renin-angiotensin expressions, we studied tissue renin messenger RNA and enzymatic levels of male mice in response to sodium depletion and castration. Sodium depletion resulted in increased renin expression in the kidney, heart, and adrenal, but not in the submandibular gland and testis. Castration lowered renin levels in all extrarenal tissues but appeared to increase renin level in the kidney. Taken together, the above data demonstrate tissue-specific regulation of renin expression and imply different functions for the sodium responsive and nonresponsive systems.\r"

  ".W": "Angiotensin II (ANG II) has been postulated to have pathogenetic role in diminished glomerular function in a number of animal models of acute renal failure. The present studies were designed to test the hypothesis that modest elevations in circulating ANG II potentiate the ability of ANG II to reduce glomerular capillary surface area through an effect on ANG II binding to glomerular mesangial cells and/or influences on other modulators of function. Rat glomeruli isolated by a sieving technique were employed in vitro in an ANG II radioreceptor assay. Subpressor infusion of ANG II for 36 hours in rats increases the affinity and number of ANG II binding sites of isolated glomeruli. The ability of ANG II to influence function was tested by assessing its effect on glomerular surface area in vitro by image-analysis microscopy, a method of measuring mesangial cell contractility. The sensitivity and magnitude of ANG II-induced decrements in glomerular surface area were increased. ANG II infusion diminished glomerular prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production, increased basal cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP) production, and enhanced ANG II-induced decrements in cAMP production. In control glomeruli, only pharmacological concentrations of ANG II inhibited cAMP, but after ANG II infusion, physiological concentrations of ANG II were capable of inhibiting cAMP by as much as 57% (below basal values). In conclusion, continuous infusion of subpressor concentrations of ANG II in rats enhances the contractile response of the glomerular mesangial cell through effects on the cell's surface receptor for ANG II and on prostaglandin and cAMP production. These actions may be important mediators of the effects of ANG II on glomerular function associated with a number of experimental models of kidney disease.\r"

Nine adult mongrel dogs were chronically instrumented with aortic and vena caval catheters. After a 2-week control period, all dogs were made to gain weight by adding 2 lb/day of beef fat to their diet for 5 weeks. Blood pressure, heart rate, and body weight were measured daily before the addition of dietary fat, during the 5 weeks of the high fat diet, and for 6 weeks after the fat supplement was stopped. Plasma volume and cardiac output were measured prior to and after 5 weeks of the fat diet. During the 5-week high fat diet, the dogs' body weight increased from 22.2 +/- 2.1 to 27.4 +/- 3 kg (p less than 0.001); mean blood pressure increased from 90 +/- 5 to 112 +/- 6 mm Hg (p less than 0.01); and heart rate increased from 70 +/- 7 to 85 +/- 5 beats/min (p less than 0.05). Blood pressure, heart rate, and body weight returned to near control values after the fat diet was stopped. Over the 5-week fat diet, the dogs' plasma volume increased from 920 +/- 130 to 1059 +/- 195 ml (p less than 0.05); cardiac output increased from 2.5 +/- 0.4 to 3.1 +/- 0.3 L/min (p less than 0.05); and systemic vascular resistance increased from 35.3 +/- 8 to 38.9 +/- 9 mm Hg/L/min (p less than 0.1). Weight gain in the dogs was also associated with hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Pneumopericardium resulting in cardiac tamponade may be caused by a variety of phenomena. The onset of cardiac tamponade can indicate the presence of a rare underlying condition. As a rare complication of mechanical ventilation and PEEP, our patient experienced pneumopericardium that resulted in cardiac tamponade. Perhaps the most crucial therapy of all is astute critical care nursing assessment of patients at risk of developing the life-threatening complication of cardiac tamponade. All critical care nurses should know the signs and symptoms of cardiac tamponade. Through accurate data collection, frequent monitoring, and immediate referral to the critical care team for medical diagnosis and treatment, a patient's death can be prevented.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of norepinephrine infusion and fluid administration on diaphragmatic O2 consumption during endotoxic shock were assessed in spontaneously breathing anesthetized dogs. Blood flow was measured with the microsphere technique, and diaphragmatic venous blood was obtained via a catheter inserted into the left inferior phrenic vein. One group of dogs (n = 6) received 10 mg/kg Escherichia coli endotoxin intravenously (E group). In the second and third groups, blood pressure after endotoxin injection was restored by continuous infusion of norepinephrine tartrate (N group) or by infusion of normal saline and dextran infusion (F group). The animals were observed for 2 h after endotoxin injection. Cardiac output fell significantly in the E and N group, whereas it was restored in the F group. Minute ventilation and diaphragmatic pressure-time index rose twofold in the three groups of dogs. Diaphragmatic O2 consumption (VO2 di) increased substantially in the E group to a mean value of 3.46 ml X 100 g-1 X min-1, which was achieved by higher blood flow and by an increase in O2 extraction. In the N group, VO2 di was higher than control but was lower than that of the E group (mean value of 1.43 ml X 100 g-1 X min-1), which was achieved solely by increasing O2 extraction. In the F group, VO2 di was also lower than that of the E group (mean value of 1.51 ml X 100 g-1 X min-1), which was achieved by high diaphragmatic blood flow. Thus, at any given diaphragmatic task, the diaphragm consumed less O2 in the N and F group than in the E group.\r"

  ".U": "87250076\r", 
  ".W": "Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) may impair extrapulmonary organ function. However, the effects of PEEP on the liver are unclear. We tested the hypothesis that at a constant cardiac output (CO), PEEP does not induce changes in hepatic blood flow (QL) and parenchymal performance. In splenectomized, close-chested canine preparations (group I, n = 6), QL was derived as hepatic outflow using electromagnetic flow probes (QLemf), and hepatic performance was defined by extraction and clearance of indocyanine green (ICG). In a noninvasive model (group II, n = 7), the effects of PEEP on hepatic performance alone were similarly analyzed. Measurements were taken during intermittent positive-pressure ventilation (IPPV1), after addition of 10 cmH2O PEEP to IPPV (PEEP1), during continued PEEP but after return of CO to IPPV1 levels by intravascular volume infusions (PEEP2), and after removal of both PEEP and excess blood volume (IPPV2). Phasic inspiratory decreases in QLemf present during positive-pressure ventilation were not increased during either PEEP1 or PEEP2. Mean QLemf decreased proportionately with CO during PEEP1 (P less than 0.05), but was restored to IPPV1 levels in a parallel fashion with CO during PEEP2. The ICG pharmacokinetic responses to PEEP were complex, with differential effects on extraction and clearance. Despite this, hepatic performance was not imparied in either group. we conclude that global QL reductions during PEEP are proportional to PEEP-induced decreases in CO and are preventable by returning CO to pre-PEEP levels by intravascular volume infusions. However, covarying changes in blood volume and hepatic outflow resistance may independently modulate hepatic function.\r"

A chronic lung lymph fistula was prepared in seven sheep. After a base-line period, left atrial pressure (Pla) was increased. E. coli (10(9) X kg body wt) were given after attaining filtration independent L/P values. The sigma's for the normal lung were calculated to 0.73 for total protein and to 0.65, 0.76, and 0.91 for albumin, IgG, and IgM, respectively. The equivalent pore radii were determined to 50 and 175 A with 35% of the filtration accounted for by the large pores. After bacterial infusion, the sigma's for total protein, albumin, IgG, and IgM decreased significantly from preseptic values to 0.58, 0.50, 0.64, and 0.83, respectively. After sepsis the small pores were 50 A and the large pores 200 A with 49% of total volume flow at maximum lymph flows occurring through the large pores. Assuming a constant small-pore population the large-pore number increased 32% after bacterial infusion. These results indicate that pulmonary microvascular permeability may have increased due to the sepsis.\r"

Fasted adrenodemedullated (ADM) and sham-operated (SHAM) rats were run on a rodent treadmill (21 m/min, 15% grade) for 30 min or until exhaustion. ADM rats were infused with saline, epinephrine, glucose, or lactate during the exercise bouts. ADM saline-infused rats showed markedly reduced endurance, hypoglycemia, elevated plasma insulin, reduced blood lactate, and reduced muscle glycogenolysis compared with exercising SHAM's. Epinephrine infusion corrected all deficiencies. Glucose infusion restored endurance run times and blood glucose to normal without correcting the deficiencies in blood lactate and muscle glycogenolysis. Infusion of lactate partially corrected the hypoglycemia at 30 min of exercise, but endurance was not restored to normal and rats were hypoglycemic at exhaustion. We conclude that in the fasted exercising rat, actions of epinephrine in addition to provision of gluconeogenic substrate are essential for preventing hypoglycemia and allowing the rat to run for long periods of time.\r"

  ".W": "The characteristics and control of the increase in plasma renin activity (PRA) during environmental heating (EH) were determined in 12 unanesthetized, chronically catheterized baboons. Each EH experiment consisted of a 1.5- to 4-h exposure to an ambient temperature of 39-44 degrees C until core temperature (Tc) reached 39.5-40.0 degrees C. These EH experiments were done on the baboon in an unblocked state and during beta-adrenergic receptor blockade produced by propranolol when on normal-to-high salt intake (NHSI) and on low-salt intake (LSI). PRA rose linearly with Tc during EH, but the increase in PRA was considerably larger when the baboon was on LSI. The PRA-Tc linear regression coefficients were 2.32 and 5.98 ng angiotensin I X ml-1 X h-1 X degrees C-1 in NHSI and LSI states, respectively. This rise in PRA during EH was completely eliminated during beta-blockade in both NHSI and LSI states. It is concluded that heat stress activates the sympathetic nervous system to stimulate beta-receptor-mediated renin secretion by the kidney, this activation is controlled primarily by internal thermoreceptors, and variations in salt intake alters only the magnitude of the increase in PRA during heat stress, not the mechanisms that produce it.\r"

Since these mechanisms may be influenced differently by sodium depletion, this study examined the hypothesis that sodium depletion would have a differential effect on cutaneous and renal vascular responses to EH. Sodium depletion was produced in chronically instrumented baboons by placing them on low-salt intake for 8-19 days along with diuretic administration. EH consisted of exposing the baboon to an ambient temperature of 40-42 degrees C until core temperature (Tc) reached 39.8-40.0 degrees C. Both control plasma renin activity (PRA) and the rise in PRA with Tc during EH were considerably larger in sodium-depleted baboons. However, the magnitudes of the progressive increases in iliac vascular conductance (used as an index of hindlimb cutaneous vasodilation) and renal vascular resistance with rising Tc during EH were unaltered by sodium depletion. Therefore, neither cutaneous nor renal vascular responses to EH are influenced by elevated PRA and other changes accompanying sodium depletion in the baboon.\r"

Surfactant was removed by repeated lung lavage with isotone saline. To minimize structural damage to the lungs, pressure generated insufflation with short expiration was utilized. Aerosolized 99mTc-DTPA was administered via a bag-in-bottle system. Radioactivity was measured with a gamma camera and time-activity curves were obtained over the base of the right lung. Six nonlavaged rabbits served as controls. In six lavaged rabbits clearance of 99mTc-DTPA was significantly faster than in controls. In three rabbits given natural surfactant into the trachea after lung lavage, 99mTc-DTPA was eliminated faster than in controls but slower than in surfactant-depleted animals. The results indicate a role of surfactant on clearance rate of 99mTc-DTPA from rabbit lungs. Measurements of 99mTc-DTPA clearance may be useful in studying the function of the surfactant system in different lung disorders.\r"

The curve parameter estimates have been computed, tabulated, and statistically evaluated. The slope (quadratic coefficient) for each variable within a group and almost all variables between groups were significantly different from zero and from each other at P less than or equal to 0.0001.\r"

ACh efflux from indomethacin (INDO, 10(-6) M)-pretreated and control TSM increased with consecutive stimulations. However, efflux of ACh was greater in INDO-treated than control muscles. INDO increased the tension produced by TSM in response to EFS. Neither PGE2 (10(-8) M) nor PGI2 (10(-6) M) had any effect on ACh efflux from INDO-pretreated TSM during the first of three periods of EFS. However, PGI2 and PGE2 prevented the progressive increase in ACh efflux observed on subsequent stimulations. PGE2 but not PGI2 decreased contractions of TSM caused by EFS. Our results demonstrate that endogenous prostaglandins, probably PGE2, do inhibit EFS-evoked ACh release from canine TSM in vitro, but suggest that these prostaglandins modulate EFS-evoked contractions predominantly by postsynaptic mechanisms.\r"

Sixteen of 46 (35%) subjects had a 20% or greater drop in forced expiratory volume in 1 s at a provocative methacholine concentration less than or equal to 25 mg/ml. The degree of methacholine responsiveness was not dependent upon base-line pulmonary function values or the amount of cigarettes consumed, and there was no association between the amount of cigarettes consumed and base-line pulmonary function values. These data suggest that many young asymptomatic nonatopic smokers have increased airway responsiveness to inhaled methacholine without clinically significant hyperreactive airway disease.\r"

CPAP resulted in increased FRC, increased peak and rate of rise of diaphragmatic activity (EMGdi and EMGdi/TI), decreased peak genioglossal activity (EMGge), decreased inspiratory time and inspiratory duty cycle (P less than 0.001 for all comparisons). Inspiratory changes in Pes and Pdi, as well as Pes/EMGdi and Pdi/EMGdi also decreased (P less than 0.001 for all comparisons), but mean inspiratory airflow for a given Pes increased (P less than 0.001) on CPAP. The increase in mean inspiratory airflow for a given Pes despite the decrease in upper airway muscle activity suggests that CPAP mechanically splints the upper airway. The changes in EMGge and EMGdi after CPAP application most likely reflect the effects of CPAP and the associated changes in respiratory system mechanics on the afferent input from receptors distributed throughout the intact respiratory system.\r"

A Bird Mark 14 positive-pressure ventilator was modified such that flow is a linear function of a command signal. Flow is delivered by advancing an air valve with a servo-motor that is controlled by one of three different operational modes. In two of the modes, the difference between the electronic average of inspiratory phrenic activity (moving average) and a feedback signal determines the inspiratory flow. The feedback signal is derived from either tracheal pressure or an electronic measure of inspired volume. In the third mode, the moving average is differentiated to provide control of inspiratory flow and volume. Physiological flow profiles were created using all three operational modes. Integration of an air-valve position signal provides an electronic measure of tidal volume. An additional feature of this ventilator allows inspiratory flow and duration to be predetermined for a given breath.\r"

One had a carcinoma of the mid-ureter with a solitary kidney. Two patients had ureteral injury. One was iatrogenic from a prior operation, and the other had intrinsic ureteral disease secondary to schistosomiasis. The fourth patient had renovascular hypertension with disease extension into the interlobar renal arteries and a single kidney. The final patient had a large, renal arteriovenous malformation and polycystic kidneys. All have functioning grafts at follow-up ranging from 10 to 36 months. There is no evidence of tumor recurrence after 30 months in the patient with ureteral malignancy. The patient with renovascular hypertension has adequate blood pressure control with medication 12 months after surgery. His creatinine which had risen in the post-operative period to 4.2 mg/dl, has returned to its pre-operative valve of 1.8 mg/dl. None of the other four patients had any post-operative decline in renal function. These cases illustrate that the technique of nephrectomy, extracorporeal surgery, and renal autotransplantation can be applied to a variety of benign and malignant diseases of the kidney and ureter not amenable to conventional in-situ correction, thus allowing maximal preservation of renal parenchyma. We also have demonstrated that the procedure can be successfully performed in the presence of significant infectious risk (Case 2: indwelling nephrostomy), and retroperitoneal infection (Case 3: schistosomiasis). We feel that this procedure is currently underutilized.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Direct evaluation of the extracranial carotid artery system did not show any abnormalities. In contrast to this periorbital Doppler examination revealed positive findings with retrograde flow direction in the supratrochlear artery in 19% and 21% of all examined carotids in the hypertension and control group, respectively. Compared to direct carotid angiography, 66% of the positive supratrochlear and 13% of the positive supraorbital findings in the hypertensive patient group could be shown to be false positive results. As a possible explanation of this high incidence of a retrograde flow direction in periorbital arteries a different flow physiology in the ophthalmic artery of black Zambians compared to Caucasians is discussed.\r"

The natural taper of the vein and the presence of arteriovenous fistulas are two unique factors associated with this conduit. Utilizing intra-operative electromagnetic flowmeter (EF) measurements and post-operative duplex ultrasound scanning (DUS), we have studied the natural history of these conduits from the time of their arterialization. The EF mean arterial blood flow in 71 in-situ bypasses was 100.8 cc/ml, range 25-200. No significant correlation was found between these measurements and angiographic runoff, vein diameter, pre- or post-operative Ankle/Brachial Index (ABI) and site of distal anastomosis. Three immediate failures requiring revisions were not predicted by EF flow measurements. Using the unique combination of Doppler ultrasound measurement and real time imaging, afforded by the DUS, fistula flow was determined. These studies showed that terminal bypass segment blood flow is not significantly affected by cutaneous fistula interruption. We found that duplex ultrasound scanning is a useful tool ideally suited to the study of the arterialized saphenous vein in-situ. One of its main advantages is the ability to accurately localize the site and hemodynamic significance of any arteriovenous fistulas.\r"

In the past, bacterial endocarditis was the major source of emboli infecting the aorta. Now, gram-negative sepsis in elderly patients is often the initiating event of infection in atherosclerotic aneurysms. Four cases of gram-negative infection in aortic aneurysms were treated. The etiology, presentation, and surgical management are reviewed. Three abdominal aortic aneurysms were infected during urinary tract sepsis and one infection occurred with Salmonella septicemia. The clinical triad of fever, abdominal pain, and a pulsatile abdominal mass led to a preoperative diagnosis in three of four patients. Debridement of infected tissue and bypass through non-infected tissue planes remain the cornerstones of modern surgical management. Despite prompt diagnosis and proper surgical management, the mortality of gram-negative aortic infection remains high because of early rupture and extensive atherosclerotic disease.\r"

  ".W": "A high glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is often found early in insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM). It has been suggested that high circulating glucose, glucagon, and GH levels could play a role in this increase in GFR. On the other hand, patients with IDDM in poor metabolic control also have high circulating ketone body levels. This study was undertaken to determine whether exogenous D,L-3-hydroxybutyric acid at two infusion rates (40 and 30 mumol kg-1 min-1) for 180 min altered renal plasma flow (RPF), GFR, and the excretion rate of total protein, beta 2-microglobulin, and albumin in 11 normal (N) subjects and 11 IDDM patients in whom euglycemia was achieved and maintained using the insulin-glucose clamp technique. RPF and GFR were measured by a priming-continuous infusion of [125I]hippurate and [51Cr]EDTA, respectively. The 40 mumol kg-1 min-1 D,L-3-hydroxybutyric acid infusion increased RPF and GFR in both N and IDDM subjects. Mean RPF increased from 588 +/- 78 (+/- SD) to 706 +/- 129 mL min-1 1.73 m-2 in N and from 671 +/- 101 to 781 +/- 99 in IDDM. GFR increased from 121 +/- 11 to 151 +/- 15 ml min-1 1.73 m-2 in N and from 136 +/- 11 to 191 +/- 16 in IDDM. The filtration fraction also was significantly higher in IDDM than in N during the D,L-3-hydroxybutyric acid infusion. The 30 mumol kg-1 min-1 D,L-3-hydroxybutyric acid infusion increased RPF and GFR to a somewhat lesser extent in both groups. D,L-3-hydroxybutyric acid infusions increased the tubular reabsorption rate of ketone bodies and sodium. The increase in tubular sodium reabsorption rate was correlated significantly to that in the tubular ketone body reabsorption rate. A significant decrease in urinary pH was found during the D,L-3-hydroxybutyric acid infusion. D,L-3-Hydroxybutyrate sodium salt (30 mumol kg-1 min-1) also was infused in 5 of the 11 diabetic patients. A similar increase in GFR and RPF occurred. Both total protein and beta 2-microglobulin, but not albumin, excretion rates increased during D,L-3-hydroxybutyric acid (40 mumol kg-1 min-1) infusion in N and IDDM subjects. D,L-3-Hydroxybutyric acid infusion did not change plasma glucagon, GH, or renin activity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

The two hormones were localized in decidual tissue using the avidin-biotin immunoperoxidase procedure with antisera to human PRL and to a synthetic 14-amino acid sequence of the connecting peptide of human relaxin (hCp14). The object of using the hCp14 antiserum was to verify relaxin production by the detection of C-peptide and/or prorelaxin. Cells of the parietal decidua adherent to the fetal membranes stained with both antisera, and immunostaining for both hormones in the same cell was seen. Also, the decidua-like cells of the placental basal plate stained with both antisera. The chorionic cytotrophoblast stained with the antiserum to hCp14, but not the antiserum to human PRL, whereas the placental syncytiotrophoblast stained for PRL and/or human placental lactogen (hPL), but not hCp14. The PRL staining in all tissues was lost when anti-PRL serum absorbed with human placental lactogen (hPL) was used. This finding suggests that the antiserum to PRL could not distinguish between PRL and hPL. It appears, therefore, that the parietal decidua cells and the decidua-like cells of the placental basal plate may be capable of producing both relaxin and PRL, while the syncytiotrophoblast produces hPL and possibly PRL.\r"

  ".W": "The plasma levels of enzymatically active renin (active renin) and inactive renin (prorenin) were measured in a woman with primary ovarian failure, in whom pregnancy was established by the induction of an artificial cycle and in vitro fertilization of a donated oocyte fertilized with the sperm of her husband. The results were compared with those in nine normal pregnant women. Prepregnancy plasma active renin and prorenin levels were normal in the patient. Active renin rose 2-fold during pregnancy in both the patient and the normal pregnant women. In the first 8 weeks of pregnancy prorenin rose by 156 microU/mL in the patient, whereas it rose by 869 +/- 169 microU/mL (mean +/- SD) in the normal pregnant women. Thus, the rise in prorenin in our patient was much less than normal. Prorenin remained abnormally low throughout the pregnancy, which lasted 40 weeks. Therefore, the high prorenin levels that occur normally during pregnancy may depend on normal ovarian function. Amniotic fluid prorenin in the patient was similar to that in normal pregnant women and was 75 times higher than that in plasma. This finding suggests that prorenin production by the chorionic cells was normal in the patient and that chorionic prorenin does not contribute in any major degree to the level of prorenin in maternal plasma. Because of these findings and in light of recent evidence that the ovary secretes prorenin and produces high plasma prorenin levels in women with hyperstimulated cycles, we conclude that the ovary is the main source of the elevated plasma prorenin levels in pregnant women.\r"

Paired 3-h euglycemic insulin clamp studies were performed in random order employing insulin alone (25 mU/m2 X min) or insulin with SRIH (250 micrograms/h) and replacement of basal glucagon (0.4 ng/kg X min). Basal plasma glucose, insulin, glucagon (IRG), and GH concentrations, hepatic glucose production, and Rd were similar on each occasion. Steady state (10-180 min) plasma insulin insulin alone, 283 +/- 10 (+/- SEM); insulin, IRG, and SRIH, 284 +/- 10 pmol/L) and glucagon levels (insulin alone, 84 +/- 7; insulin, IRG, and SRIH, 82 +/- 7 ng/L) were similar. Hepatic glucose production (insulin alone, 0.66 +/- 0.12; insulin, IRG, and SRIH, 0.78 +/- 0.48 mg/kg X min) and Rd (insulin alone, 8.16 +/- 0.62; insulin, IRG, and SRIH, 8.17 +/- 0.61 mg/kg X min) were not different at steady state. We conclude that SRIH infusion with glucagon replacement does not augment insulin-mediated glucose disposal in normal young subjects at physiological insulin levels.\r"

  ".W": "Although insulin stimulates protein synthesis and inhibits protein breakdown in skeletal muscle in vitro, the actual contribution of these actions to its anabolic effects in man remains unknown. Using the forearm perfusion method together with systemic infusion of L-[ring-2,6-3H]phenylalanine and L-[1-14C]leucine, we measured steady state amino acid exchange kinetics across muscle in seven normal males before and in response to a 2-h intraarterial infusion of insulin. Postabsorptively, the muscle disposal (Rd) of phenylalanine (43 +/- 5 nmol/min per 100 ml forearm) and leucine (113 +/- 13) was exceeded by the concomitant muscle production (Ra) of these amino acids (57 +/- 5 and 126 +/- 9 nmol/min per dl, respectively), resulting in their net release from the forearm (-14 +/- 4 and -13 +/- 5 nmol/min per dl, respectively). In response to forearm hyperinsulinemia (124 +/- 11 microU/ml), the net balance of phenylalanine and leucine became positive (9 +/- 3 and 61 +/- 8 nmol/min per dl, respectively (P less than 0.005 vs. basal). Despite the marked increase in net balance, the tissue Rd for both phenylalanine (42 +/- 2) and leucine (124 +/- 9) was unchanged from baseline, while Ra was markedly suppressed (to 33 +/- 5 and 63 +/- 9 nmol/min per dl, respectively, P less than 0.01). Since phenylalanine is not metabolized in muscle (i.e., its only fates are incorporation into or release from protein) these results strongly suggest that in normal man, physiologic elevations in insulin promote net muscle protein anabolism primarily by inhibiting protein breakdown, rather than by stimulating protein synthesis.\r"

To evaluate the hypothesis that the derangements of the lower respiratory tract in this disorder are mediated by inflammatory cells in the local milieu, we utilized bronchoalveolar lavage to evaluate affected individuals before and after therapy. Inflammatory cells recovered from the lower respiratory tract of individuals with acute, untreated TPE (n = 8) revealed a striking eosinophilic alveolitis, with marked elevations in both the proportion of eosinophils (TPE 54 +/- 5%; normal 2 +/- 5%; P less than 0.001) and the concentration of eosinophils in the recovered epithelial lining fluid (ELF) (TPE 63 +/- 20 X 10(3)/microliter; normal 0.3 +/- 0.1 X 10(3)/microliter; P less than 0.01). Importantly, when individuals (n = 5) with acute TPE were treated with diethylcarbamazine (DEC), there was a marked decrease of the lung eosinophils and concomitant increase in lung function. These observations are consistent with the concept that at least some of the abnormalities found in the lung in acute TPE are mediated by an eosinophil-dominated inflammatory process in the lower respiratory tract.\r"

  ".U": "87251506\r", 
  ".W": "Over the last two decades a rapid expansion of our knowledge regarding dermatitis herpetiformis has occurred, including the discovery of IgA in the skin, the discovery of an associated gluten-sensitive enteropathy, the noting of an increased prevalence of the human lymphocyte antigens (HLA)-B8 and -DRw3, and the documentation that the skin disease of many dermatitis herpetiformis patients can be controlled by a gluten-free diet. It has also been noted that two distinct forms of dermatitis herpetiformis occur, those with granular deposits of IgA at the dermoepidermal junction (85%-95% of dermatitis herpetiformis patients) and those with linear IgA deposits (10%-15% of dermatitis herpetiformis patients). These findings are reviewed with particular emphasis on the form of dermatitis herpetiformis associated with granular IgA deposits. The current findings regarding the nature and origin of the cutaneous IgA deposits, the role of the gluten-sensitive enteropathy, and the spectrum of both the immunologic and the nonimmunologic abnormalities associated with dermatitis herpetiformis are presented, and from these data pathophysiologic mechanisms are proposed that may be involved in dermatitis herpetiformis.\r"

We describe a case of an 86-year-old female with a 67-year history of an osteomyelitic ulcer of the anterior tibia. Previous attempts at surgical extirpation of the bone followed by immediate or delayed repair by orthopedic and plastic surgery services had eventuated in recurrence of the basic osteomyelitic process. Below-the-knee amputation was recommended as the only alternative to treatment. However, we chose to apply zinc chloride fixative which penetrated the full thickness of cortical bone and revealed a wider and deeper extent of the infectious process than previously recognized. Following removal of the fixed bone, a muscle flap repair followed by split-thickness skin grafting was done by plastic surgery. The patient remains ulcer and symptom free 31 months postoperatively. We feel zinc chloride fixative is useful as an adjunct to other surgical means of extirpation of bone as it is tissue sparing and more accurately determines the extent of involved bone when infected.\r"

The purposes of this study were: 1) to verify whether these curves conform to the basic principles of indicator-dilution theory; and 2) to derive indexes of left ventricular ejection fraction from curve analysis. In seven closed chest dogs, 31 doses of the polysaccharide agent SHU-454 were injected into the left ventricular cavity during apical four chamber two-dimensional echocardiography. Data were obtained at different levels of ejection fraction, which were induced by changes in preload, afterload and contractility, and measured by single plane Simpson's rule analysis of digital subtraction left ventriculograms. In a subset of two dogs, eight incremental doses (from 1 to 8 ml) of SHU were injected in the basal state. Contrast echocardiograms were digitized off-line, the mean gray level/pixel of a region of interest inside the left ventricular cavity was measured, and the average value for three systolic frames of each beat was used to obtain time-intensity curves. A good correlation was observed between the peak of the time-intensity curve and the quantity of contrast injected (correlation coefficient r = 0.91 by a logarithmic fit). The echo intensities observed in each animal were subsequently transformed in quantity of contrast according to these functions and their natural logarithm was calculated both with and without background subtraction. All curves relating time and the natural logarithm of the corrected intensity exhibited a descending rectilinear portion (washout) in which the correlation was very good (r = 0.97 +/- 0.02 = mean +/- SD) and which was not significantly affected by background subtraction. The validity of this fit was also unaffected by heart rate (55 to 158 beats/min) and angiographic ejection fraction (22 to 74%), and only minimally influenced by duration of contrast washout (3.3 to 14.6 seconds). Ejection fraction was calculated by an algorithm derived from indicator-dilution theory: ejection fraction = [1 - e(-bd)] X 100, where b = slope of the curve and d = cardiac cycle duration. Linear regression analysis between values of ejection fraction derived by angiography and contrast echo yielded r = 0.73. A second index, based on b and d, was derived by multiple regression analysis. Linear regression analysis of this index and angiographic ejection fraction yielded a correlation of r = 0.87.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate the ability of continuous wave Doppler ultrasound recordings to reflect the magnitude and hemodynamic effects of aortic regurgitation. Forty-five patients with angiographically proved aortic regurgitation had Doppler studies performed within 24 hours of cardiac catheterization. High quality spectral recordings of the regurgitant jet were obtained in 31 patients, whereas 14 patients exhibited dropout of high velocity signals precluding measurement of maximal velocities. The slope of the peak to end-diastolic velocity decrease measured by Doppler examination was compared with the decay in the aortic to left ventricular diastolic pressure gradient by catheterization and was found to correlate well (r = 0.86). The Doppler velocity decay slope was generally higher in patients with angiographically severe rather than mild or moderate aortic regurgitation, but considerable overlap was present among groups. However, a diastolic velocity decay slope of greater than 3 m/s2 was seen only in those patients with advanced (3 or 4+) aortic regurgitation. Left ventricular end-diastolic pressure was estimated from the Doppler recordings by subtracting the end-diastolic pressure gradient obtained by the modified Bernoulli equation from the cuff diastolic blood pressure. A correlation was observed (r = 0.84) between Doppler and catheterization left ventricular end-diastolic pressure in the 31 patients with high quality spectral data, although the SEE was substantial (5.5 mm Hg). These data demonstrate that continuous wave Doppler recordings of the regurgitant jet can be useful in assessing the angiographic severity and hemodynamics of aortic regurgitation.\r"

  ".W": "To evaluate the reliability of the videodensitometric assessment of right ventricular ejection fraction, 38 patients were studied during diagnostic cardiac catheterization. Digital subtraction images of the right ventricle were obtained in both the right anterior oblique and the left anterior oblique views, using direct intraventricular injection of dilute contrast medium. From the end-diastolic and end-systolic images obtained in each view, analysis of the relative brightness values generated a videodensitometry-based right ventricular ejection fraction for both the right and the left anterior oblique views. These values were compared with those generated by applying the geometry-based Simpson's rule to the orthogonal images. Right ventricular ejection fraction ranged from 22 to 88%. Videodensitometric ejection fraction in the right anterior oblique view correlated well with that in the left anterior oblique view (r = 0.88) and each correlated well with geometry-based ejection fraction (r = 0.91 and 0.82, respectively). In a subset of 18 patients without significant cardiac disease, mean videodensitometric right ventricular ejection fraction was 68% (versus 61% in the abnormal subset), and it correlated closely with left ventricular ejection fraction (r = 0.82). Videodensitometric analysis of digital subtraction images provides a reliable method for calculating right ventricular ejection fraction that is independent of geometry and reliably separates normal from abnormal values. Application of videodensitometric techniques should simplify analysis of the response of the right ventricle to different interventions in patients with cardiac disease.\r"

This report describes the first double-blind, placebo-controlled evaluation of intravenous APSAC for coronary recanalization in acute myocardial infarction. Unequivocal documentation of recanalization was provided by coronary arteriography before and after the drug intervention. Forty patients with acute myocardial infarction underwent coronary arteriography 3.1 +/- 1.2 hours after the onset of symptoms. This demonstrated occlusion of the infarct-related coronary artery in 29 patients who were then randomized to treatment with intravenous APSAC, 30 mg (n = 16), and placebo (n = 13) 3.3 +/- 1.3 hours after the onset of symptoms. Repeat arteriography 90 minutes later demonstrated recanalization of the infarct-related coronary artery in nine patients who had received APSAC compared with only one patient who had received placebo (56 versus 8%, p less than 0.05). The 95% confidence limits for this 48% difference between the groups are 20 to 76%. Arteriography at 3 days showed persistent patency of all recanalized coronary arteries except one (APSAC group) and also showed late recanalization in another four patients, three of whom had received APSAC. In the patients who had a patent infarct-related coronary artery at the initial arteriographic study, patency was maintained throughout the study period regardless of whether the patient was randomized to APSAC (n = 4) or placebo (n = 7). Complications related to APSAC therapy were excessive bruising at the catheterization site in seven patients and minor sensitivity reactions in three.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

History of myocardial infarction before the qualifying event, congestive heart failure and age were independently associated with the frequency and complexity of ventricular premature beats. Of the 1,640 patients randomized to placebo therapy, 163 died (76 suffered sudden death) during a 25 month average follow-up period. Ventricular ectopic activity was an independent predictor of total mortality after taking into consideration 16 other prognostic factors describing past history, risk factors, physical examination and laboratory investigations. Seven categoric definitions of ventricular ectopic activity predicted mortality, with similar odds ratios ranging from 2.27 to 2.69. A reciprocal relation of the sensitivity and specificity of each definition in predicting mortality was observed. Three clinical criteria (ST depression, cardiomegaly and prior infarction) allowed stratification of patients into four subsets with respective mortality rates of 35.5% (three criteria present), 19.0% (two criteria), 11.5% (one criterion) and 4.7% (none). Presence of ventricular ectopic activity (greater than or equal to 10 ventricular premature beats/h or pairs, ventricular tachycardia or multiform complexes) was associated with higher mortality rates in all four risk strata. The relative risk was higher (3.86) in the lowest risk stratum (mortality 2.4% without and 9.1% with ventricular ectopic activity). Thus, in survivors of acute myocardial infarction, ventricular ectopic activity was more pronounced in patients with prior myocardial infarction and congestive heart failure. It predicted mortality independently of other factors. Although mortality ratios were similar for all seven arrhythmia definitions, a reciprocal relation between sensitivity and specificity of the definitions in predicting mortality existed; ventricular ectopic activity was associated with increased mortality in all risk strata, but with a higher risk ratio in the numerically larger, low risk subset.\r"

Results were compared with those in 15 normal subjects. Exercise duration among transplant recipients did not differ significantly from that in normal subjects. The heart rate at rest in transplant patients was 30% higher than in normal volunteers. Heart rate increased only 3% between rest and the first stage of exercise in transplant recipients compared with a 37% increase in the normal group (p less than 0.001). Cardiac output at rest was similar in both groups although the rate of rise of cardiac output and peak cardiac output were significantly lower among the transplant recipients. In early exercise, the means by which cardiac output increased in the transplant patients differed significantly from normal. In the transplant recipients, the left ventricular end-diastolic volume index increased 14% compared with a decrease of 2% in normal subjects (p less than 0.001) during the first stage of exercise. At the same time, the end-systolic volume index increased 6% in the transplant group but decreased 11% in normal subjects (p less than 0.001). These changes resulted in an overall increase in stroke volume by 20% in the transplant group compared with only a slight increase (+3%) in normal subjects (p less than 0.001) during the first stage of exercise. Among transplant recipients, the stroke volume index plateaued after the first stage of exercise, which, in combination with the blunted chronotropic response, resulted in a peak cardiac index 25% lower than that in normal subjects (p less than 0.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The hypothesis that ventricular arrhythmias represent an independent predictor of sudden cardiac death was examined by analyzing the published data. The frequency and complexity of ventricular arrhythmias increase progressively both with age and severity of heart disease, but no age- or disease-related norms have been established for clinical guidance. Simple and complex arrhythmias, including short runs of ventricular tachycardia, do not increase risk of sudden cardiac death in subjects without heart disease or with heart disease and normal myocardial function. Progression of nonsustained into sustained ventricular tachycardia in such individuals is rare. Simple and complex ventricular arrhythmias are not strong independent predictors of sudden death in survivors of myocardial infarction. In these, the overall incidence of sudden cardiac death averages 3.5 to 5% during the first year, but is about 15 to 20% per year in patients with severely impaired ventricular function. The results of this survey suggest that in patients with well preserved ventricular function, prophylactic use of antiarrhythmic drugs is not indicated, and that treatment of asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic ventricular arrhythmias is not likely to reduce the incidence of sudden cardiac death.\r"

The volume of use of the 12 lead ECG is 10 to 20 times greater than that of the exercise test or the ambulatory test, and it has received correspondingly more developmental and marketing attention. A great increase in the rate of adoption of computerized electrocardiography was brought about when large scale integration of computer hardware made it possible to place the entire computational package within a standard-sized ECG cart. Exercise ECG testing involves processing a data sample minutes in duration. Only a very few diagnostic possibilities are examined; emphasis is on measurements of the ST segment and on non-ECG observations. Ambulatory electrocardiography currently involves only one or two ECG leads and these are tested for only a few diagnostic possibilities; however, duration of the data sample is relatively long, usually 24 hours. Computer processing involves examination of about 100,000 cardiac cycles for RR interval, QRS shape and ST segment deviation.\r"

Risk of isolated systolic hypertension is sufficient to justify cautiously administering drug therapy if nonpharmacologic therapy fails to bring the systolic pressure less than 160 mm Hg, even though controlled studies have not been completed to prove efficacy. Both nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic therapy are recommended for those with sustained pressure elevation. Adverse effects of antihypertensive drugs may be minimized by starting with lower doses and by checking blood pressure in the upright position.\r"

  ".W": "Alloreactivity of intragraft and peripheral blood lymphocytes from tolerant canine lung allograft recipients was examined. Tolerance was induced by variable periods of treatment with cyclosporine. Analysis of effector cells from lung allografts (obtained by bronchoalveolar lavage) revealed the absence of specific cytolytic T lymphocyte (CTL) activity and the presence of a low level of cytolytic activity detected in a lectin-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity assay. In contrast, high levels of specific CTL activity and lectin-dependent activity were detected in cell preparations from lung allografts undergoing rejection. Tolerant recipients retained normal ability to generate specific CTL activity to third party alloantigens in mixed lymphocyte cultures (MLC) but had diminished ability to generate CTL to donor alloantigens in recipient X donor MLC. Addition of exogenous interleukin 2 to these MLC was unable to restore donor-specific CTL activity. Lymphocytes from tolerant recipients were, however, capable of generating proliferative responses and lectin-dependent cytotoxicity on exposure to donor alloantigens in MLC. Evidence presented in this report suggests that the lectin-dependent cytolytic activity generated in these MLC is mediated by lymphokine-activated killer cells. Such cells are likely to be activated by interleukin 2 released in the proliferative response. The results support the proposal that the cyclosporine-induced tolerant state is characterized by the relative inability to respond against major histocompatibility complex class I antigens in contrast to class II antigens and/or minor histocompatibility antigens since MLC-induced CTL are directed, for the most part, against class I molecules.\r"

The 16/6-positive sera were from patients with active SLE and, in one case, a scleroderma-polymyositis overlap syndrome; all contained anti-ssDNA antibody. Affinity chromatography was used to isolate 16/6-bearing Ig from sera of seven patients having anti-DNA and other autoantibodies. In a preliminary step, rheumatoid factors and nonspecific binding were removed by four passes of the serum through a column of immobilized normal rabbit gamma-globulin. The absorbed sera were then applied to a column of immobilized specific rabbit anti-16/6 globulin. This combined procedure depleted anti-ssDNA activity selectively. From 44 to 60% of total Ig but only 6 to 25% of anti-ssDNA activity was recovered in the material that passed through both columns. Approximately 40% of the anti-RNP/Sm and anti-SS-A/SS-B activities were recovered, reflecting a lesser degree of selective depletion of these antibodies. The specific eluate from the anti-idiotype column contained more IgG than IgM; anti-DNA activity; anti-RNP, anti-Sm, or anti-SS-A activity. Soluble DNA inhibited the binding of one eluate to RNP/Sm but not of another eluate to SS-A/SS-B. The results confirm that the genes encoding the 16/6 idiotype are widely represented in ethnically different human populations, and indicate that 16/6-bearing Ig may bind to other autoantigens as well as to DNA.\r"

  ".W": "An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was utilized to characterize nucleotide-reactive antibodies present in the sera of 67 human subjects: 27 active SLE, 20 inactive SLE, and 20 asymptomatic controls. This assay consisted of measuring the quantity of antibodies retained by a panel of immobilized 5'-nucleotide-BSA conjugates (AMP-, GMP-, CMP-, UMP-, and TMP-BSA) together with ssDNA and dsDNA antigens. Although the relative distribution of antibodies binding to nucleotide-BSA antigens (i.e., anti-GMP greater than anti-AMP greater than or equal to anti-TMP greater than anti-UMP greater than or equal to anti-CMP antibodies) was independent of clinical status, the sera of active SLE patients possessed three- and five-fold higher concentrations of these antibodies relative to those present in inactive SLE and control subjects, respectively. Affinity purification of the most dominant of these antibody populations with DNA- and GMP-agarose adsorbents suggested that the majority of anti-GMP antibodies were monospecific with respect to the guanine base moiety. For example, antibodies retained by GMP-agarose reacted with GMP-BSA and ssDNA but not with other nucleotide-BSA or dsDNA antigens. However, ELISA competition-inhibition studies with affinity-purified anti-GMP antibodies indicated that although the guanine base represents an important determinant, guanine-enriched oligo- and polynucleotides were preferred substrates (i.e., guanine-dependent, oligonucleotide specificity). This was exemplified by the finding that a 500- and 50-fold molar excess of dGMP and d(G)4 were required to achieve the same degree of inhibition as that observed with d(G)8. Finally, and as evaluated by indirect immunofluorescence with fixed HEp-2 cells, affinity-purified anti-GMP antibodies reacted with antigens restricted to nucleolar organelles.\r"

However, proteose-peptone-elicited peritoneal exudate macrophages that had been pretreated with CSF-1 (greater than or equal to 1000 U/ml) for 24 or 48 hr exhibited a significantly enhanced capacity to kill C. albicans. CSF-enhanced killing appeared to be independent of endogenously produced interferon-alpha/beta (IFN) in that enhancement by these two agents differed with regard to onset of the effect, target cell responsiveness, and duration of augmented killing. In addition, a highly specific anti-IFN antiserum that totally neutralized IFN augmentation of candidacidal activity had no effect on CSF-induced enhancement. Evidence was obtained indicating that CSF, unlike IFN, augmented mannose-inhibitable binding and ingestion of C. albicans, suggesting that augmented expression of mannose-receptors by CSF-treated macrophages was at least partially responsible for the enhanced killing.\r"

Interleukin 1 (IL 1) is released by activated monocytes and is a mediator of the inflammatory response. We determined whether purified recombinant human IL 1 could stimulate cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells to release hematopoietic growth factors. As little as 1 U/ml of IL 1 stimulated growth factor production by the endothelial cells, and increasing amounts of IL 1 enhanced growth factor production in a dose-dependent manner. Growth factor production increased within 2 to 4 hr and remained elevated for more than 48 hr. To investigate the molecular basis for these findings, oligonucleotide probes for granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF), and multi-CSF were hybridized to poly(A)-containing RNA prepared from unstimulated and IL 1-stimulated endothelial cells. Significant levels of GM-CSF and G-CSF, but not M-CSF or multi-CSF, mRNA were detected in the IL 1-stimulated endothelial cells. Biological assays performed on the IL 1-stimulated endothelial cell-conditioned medium confirmed the presence of both GM- and G-CSF. These results demonstrate that human recombinant IL 1 can stimulate endothelial cells to release GM-CSF and G-CSF, and provide a mechanism by which IL 1 could modulate both granulocyte production and function during the course of an inflammatory response.\r"

  ".W": "Nasal lavage fluids from unstimulated individuals contain a histamine-releasing factor (HRF) similar to those which we have previously described from macrophages, platelets, and from blister fluids obtained during the late cutaneous reaction. The nasal HRF was partially purified by ion-exchange chromatography and gel filtration. Although some m.w. heterogeneity was observed, the majority of the HRF eluted at an apparent m.w. range of 15,000 to 30,000. This partially purified HRF induced histamine release from basophils of certain individuals. Histamine release occurred via a mechanism which is IgE-dependent in that: basophils desensitized by exposure to anti-IgE in the absence of calcium no longer respond to HRF, and desensitization with HRF reduces responsiveness to anti-IgE; and removal of IgE from the basophil surface by using lactic acid renders cells unresponsive to HRF. We have further defined this IgE dependence and have shown that the reason that only selected basophil donors respond to HRF is due to a previously unrecognized, functional heterogeneity of IgE. Thus, passive sensitization using sera from responders restored the responsiveness of acid-stripped basophils and conferred responsiveness to basophils of a nonresponder with naturally unoccupied IgE receptors. Sera from nonresponders failed to do this even though similar numbers of IgE molecules were put onto the basophil surface in each case. This property of responder sera was due to IgE because both heating sera at 56 degrees C for 2 hr and passage of sera over anti-IgE-Sepharose (which removes greater than 90% of the IgE) markedly reduced the ability of sera to induce responsiveness, and because an excess of either purified IgE myeloma or purified penicillin-specific IgE antibody from a nonresponder competitively inhibited the ability of IgE from responder sera to induce responsiveness to HRF. We conclude that nasal lavage fluids contain an HRF which induces basophil histamine release in a specific, IgE-dependent fashion but only from individuals with the appropriate type of IgE. Because we have shown that basophils are recruited into the nose during the late-phase reaction, we suggest that nasal HRF may induce these cells to release histamine and other mediators which could contribute to the symptomatology of the late-phase reaction.\r"

  ".W": "The antigen specificity of two immunoprotective monoclonal antibodies derived from mice immunized with Escherichia coli 0111:B4 bacteria and boosted with purified lipopolysaccharide (LPS) were investigated. One of the antibodies, B7, was shown by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunostaining to bind to the O-antigen containing LPS species, whereas the other antibody, 5B10, reacted with both O-antigen containing homologs and the O-antigen-deficient LPS. 5B10 did not bind to LPS from E. coli J5, an Rc mutant of E. coli 0111:B4 that lacks both the O-antigen and outer core sugars. 5B10 did not cross-react with LPS from several other E. coli strains. Thus 5B10 appeared to recognize a type-specific epitope in the outer core of LPS exclusive of Rc determinants. The monoclonal antibody specific for the polymeric O-antigen is of the IgG3 subclass, and the monoclonal antibody 5B10 specific for the outer core of LPS is an IgG2a. Although B7 and 5B10 were equally able to protect mice from a lethal challenge of E. coli 0111:B4 organisms, the outer core-specific IgG2a antibody was much more efficient at mediating the binding of human complement C3 than the O-antigen-specific IgG3 monoclonal antibody.\r"

However, experiments using monoclonal antibodies against class I antigens showed that these antigens also play some role in the regulation of T cell activation. Three monoclonal antibodies, namely W6/32 (anti-class I HLA-A, B, C, antigens), 4E (anti-class I HLA-B antigens), and BBM.1 (anti-beta 2-microglobulin) significantly suppressed the phytohemagglutinin-induced T cell proliferation. The inhibitory effect of anti-class I antibody was found to depend on the presence of monocyte/macrophage-type adherent cells. In the presence of antibody, adherent cells released a factor that suppressed T cell proliferation. These results suggest that HLA class I antigens on Mo1+ monocyte/macrophage cells function like ligand-receptor molecules, and regulate the secretion of suppressor factor(s).\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies have demonstrated that the sensory neuropeptide substance P (SP) can modulate immune responses in vitro. Work from this laboratory has shown that SP enhances immunoglobulin synthesis by murine splenic and Peyer's patch lymphocytes stimulated with concanavalin A. One mechanism underlying these effects is the binding of SP to specific receptors on lymphocytes. We examined the distribution of SP receptors on murine T and B lymphocytes and their subsets by one and two color fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis. The specificity and nature of binding was examined using radiolabeled SP, and competitive inhibition experiments were performed with cold SP. In cytofluorimetry experiments, both T and B lymphocytes from Peyer's patches and spleen were bound to SP, with those from Peyer's patches having a higher proportion than lymphocytes from the spleen. The majority of T cells from both organs bound SP with binding being evenly distributed between Lyt-1+ and Lyt-2+ cells. Similarly, the majority of B lymphocytes from spleen and Peyer's patches showed SP binding. There were no significant isotype-specific differences within any organ. Studies using 125I-labeled SP showed specific binding to all lymphocyte subpopulations examined. SP receptors were fewer in number on cells isolated from spleen than on cells from Peyer's patches although the dissociation constants were similar for all populations examined. These studies demonstrated that SP receptors are present both on murine T and B lymphocytes from Peyer's patches and spleen. There is no evidence for differential SP receptor expression on distinct lymphocyte subsets in spleen or Peyer's patches.\r"

  ".W": "LPS stimulated human blood mononuclear leukocytes to produce a chemotactic factor for human neutrophils. The effect of LPS was dose-dependent; 10 micrograms/ml was optimal for production of chemotactic factor. Chemotactic activity was detected 3 hr after LPS stimulation, and reached its peak at 12 hr. No activity was detected in culture supernatants of unstimulated cells, provided LPS-free media were selected. Isoelectric point of the factor, determined by chromatofocusing, was approximately 8 to 8.5. Molecular weight was approximately 10 kilodaltons by Sephacryl S-200 gel filtration or by HPLC gel filtration on TSK-2000 and -3000 columns in succession. The gel filtration fractions were also assayed for IL 1 activity. The elution position of IL 1 activity corresponded to a m.w. of 18. There was no chemotactic activity in the IL 1 activity peak. Furthermore, highly purified natural Il 1 alpha and -beta and recombinant Il 1 alpha and -beta did not exhibit chemotactic activity for neutrophils in our assay. Among mononuclear leukocytes, the monocyte was the principal producer of neutrophil chemotactic factor. These results suggest that a chemotactic factor for neutrophils, different from IL 1, is produced by LPS-stimulated blood monocytes.\r"

In this report we have metabolically labeled the U937 cell line at various timepoints during its phorbol myristic acetate-induced maturation to examine the kinetics of synthesis of these proteins during monocytic differentiation, and their maturation and glycosylation. The p150,95 alpha subunit was immunoprecipitated with p150,95-specific monoclonal antibody (MAb), or an antiserum to the denatured, purified alpha X subunit. The glycosylation and polypeptide chain length of the p150,95, Mac-1, and lymphocyte function associated antigen (LFA-1) alpha and beta subunits were compared by immunoprecipitation with subunit specific MAb and antisera, and by digestion with Endo H and N-glycanase. The p150,95 alpha subunit is synthesized as a precursor of 146,000 Mr, has five to six N-linked oligosaccharides, and has a polypeptide chain backbone of 132,000 Mr. Over 50% of the carbohydrate on the mature alpha subunit of 150,000 Mr was sensitive to Endo H digestion. The p150,95 alpha and beta precursors can associate before maturation into the mature form. Conversion to the mature form was accompanied by loss of reactivity with the antiserum to the denatured alpha X subunit, suggesting a change in conformation. Mac-1 and LFA-1 alpha subunits have precursors of 160,000 Mr and 165,000 Mr, respectively, and contain N-linked carbohydrates. The polypeptide chain length for the Mac-1 alpha subunit is 137,000 Mr, and for LFA-1 is 149,000 Mr. Only 14% of the oligosaccharide on the mature LFA-1 alpha subunit was sensitive to Endo H, suggesting that unlike p150,95, most is converted to the complex type. The differences noted in the Mr of the three homologous alpha subunits are therefore due to differences in both polypeptide chain length and carbohydrate processing during biosynthesis.\r"

This conclusion is suggested by the following observations. 1) Fc epsilon R and IgE-BF share several antigenic determinants as shown by immunoprecipitation with several Mab to Fc epsilon R (MabER) and SDS-PAGE analysis of the precipitates. 2) Upon incubation at 37 degrees C, normal tonsillar lymphocytes lose their Fc epsilon R and this is associated in a time-related manner with the release in the CSN of molecules reacting with two MabER. 3) Surface radioiodinated tonsillar lymphocytes or RPMI 8866 cells release labeled IgE-binding molecules displaying the same antigenic composition and the same migration on SDS-PAGE as purified IgE-BF. 4) Peptide mapping of highly purified IgE-BF and Fc epsilon R reveals the presence of several identical fragments after digestion with either alpha-chymotrypsin, trypsin, or papain. Moreover, papain digestion of the 25-27 kD IgE-BF and of the affinity-purified Fc epsilon R, generated a 15 kD fragment reacting with two MabER and that is known to bind IgE. Although these data strongly suggest that IgE-BF may be directly derived from cell surface IgE receptors, they do not exclude the possibility that some IgE-BF may also be secreted without being first anchored in the cell membrane.\r"

The failure to detect wheat protein in these IgA-CIC, despite the association of DH with gluten-sensitive enteropathy, suggests that the IgA-CIC in DH may be similar to those seen in the IgA nephropathies and represent IgA rheumatoid factor (RF)-IgG complexes. We have examined the sera of 32 patients with DH, 16 non-DH patients positive for RF by latex fixation, and 15 normal subjects for IgA and IgM RF using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) and for IgA-CIC using an anti-C3 ELISA. Thirteen of 16 (81%) latex fixation test-positive patients had IgA RF by ELISA and 15/16 (94%) had IgM RF by ELISA. The total amount of RF detected by the ELISA (IgA + IgM RF) correlated with the latex fixation titer (r = 0.678, p = 0.004) in these latex fixation-positive patients. Six of the 16 (38%) latex fixation-positive patients also were found to have IgA-CIC. Solid phase absorption using goat antihuman C3 decreased the levels of immune complexes but not the level of IgA RF, suggesting the IgA-CIC detected do not represent uncomplexed IgA RF. In contrast, although 12 of 31 (39%) patients with DH had IgA-CIC ranging in amount from 0.331-26.0 micrograms IgA/ml (nl less than 0.150 microgram IgA/ml), only 1 of 32 (3%) DH patients had detectable levels of IgA RF (7.0 micrograms IgA/ml, nl less than 2.0 micrograms IgA/ml). Low levels of IgM RF were found in 8/32 (25%) of patients with DH (1.1-1.6 micrograms IgM/ml, nl less than 1.0 microgram IgM/ml). These data document that IgA RF is not present in the sera of patients with DH independent of the presence or absence of IgA-CIC and that it is unlikely that the IgA-CIC present are IgA RF complexed with autologous IgG.\r"

The skin biopsy showed a dermal infiltrate of predominantly T-helper lymphocytes (helper:suppressor ratio, 7:1). These cells showed strong HLA-DR plasma membrane staining. There was no HLA-DR staining in the membranes of epidermal keratinocytes. Using a monoclonal antihuman IgE, positive staining was observed in the dermis, though none was identified in the epidermis.

This reaction could not be abolished by absorption of the antibody with purified human involucrin to which the antibody reacted by immunoblot, thus indicating the presence of an additional antigenic determinant(s). Antibodies raised to CEs of human epidermis stained the cytoplasm of epidermal cells and gave a strong reaction to cytokeratins and a weak one to involucrin, indicating that in tissue the keratins are also cross-linked. The antibody prepared to bovine CEs reacted with keratins, but when absorbed with prekeratin it gave a peripheral staining pattern with epidermis and reacted strongly with a 126 kD component of the neutral buffer extract of cow snout epidermis and weakly with 205 kD and 85 kD ones. This antibody reacted with human involucrin by immunoblot while an antibody to involucrin stained 143 kD, 119 kD, 113 kD, and 107 kD polypeptides in the bovine extract. These latter 3 bands were shown to be substrates of transglutaminase. Further, a monoclonal antibody to bovine CEs reacted with the 119 kD and 113 kD bands and gave a peripheral staining pattern in the epidermis. Proof that the 126 kD protein was a precursor of the envelope was obtained by preparing an antibody to it and demonstrating peripheral staining of epidermal cells. These results point out the value of preparing antibodies to CE as an additional approach to studying the composition of CEs and demonstrate previously undescribed components in human and bovine tissue.\r"

This plasma fraction, referred to as coepibolin, alone supports no cell spreading but potentiates the activity of epibolin by at least 5-10 times. Studies reported here indicate that coepibolin activity associates with one plasma fraction, it cannot be substituted by commercial preparations of ovalbumin, soybean trypsin inhibitor, or hemoglobin, but it can be substituted by commercial bovine or human serum albumin. The activity purified to electrophoretic homogeneity comigrates with, and shows antigenic properties of albumin. Under the assay conditions coepibolin affects the extent and morphology of cell spreading: in the presence of epibolin plus coepibolin cells assume a more polar orientation than in epibolin alone. For its maximal effect coepibolin must be present continuously in the early phases of cell spreading.\r"

Cells in the low calcium culture do not have extensive cell-cell connections, as seen with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated insulin. Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated concanavalin A and Griffonia simplicifolia isolectin B4, but not peanut agglutinin (PNA), fluorescently label these cells. In 3-day-old low calcium cultures, within 2 h after raising the calcium of the medium to the normal level, intense binding of PNA to cells appears and neighboring cells are connected through bundles of filaments that are fluorescently labeled by FITC-insulin. After 2 days in normal calcium medium, the cultures exhibit relatively smooth, straightlined, cell boundaries that are labeled by FITC-insulin and cell boundaries and intracellular granules that are stained by hematoxylin. One day later, similar cell boundaries are present, but they are not significantly decorated by FITC-insulin and, under phase contrast microscopy, are dark. Free FITC gives labeling patterns similar to those given by FITC-insulin, but the FITC labeling is blocked by mercaptoethanol and dithiothreitol in contrast to FITC-insulin binding. The present results suggest the insulin moiety is involved in the labeling by FITC-insulin and the labeling is chronologically related to the stage of cell differentiation.\r"

Within 6 h after seeding, fibroblasts initiated a migration that resulted in the formation of a cellular network after 1 day of culture on top of the gel. Electron microscopy revealed that fibroblasts were able to remodel the basement membrane matrix by penetrating into the gel (from day 3), depositing fibronectin and collagen fibers, and retracting this extracellular matrix. Fibroblasts cultured on the Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm reconstituted basement membrane matrix displayed ultrastructural features characterized by a poor synthetic apparatus (rough endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi vesicles), a large cytoskeleton, and intracytoplasmic vesicles containing laminin. Thus the reconstituted basement membrane matrix is remodeled by skin fibroblasts, and reciprocally their ultrastructural morphologic features are affected by this matrix.\r"

The present study was performed to determine whether the binding of pemphigus antibodies to the surface of keratinocytes can inhibit the regeneration of cell-cell contact induced by altering from low to normal Ca++ concentration medium. Human keratinocytes (a cell line of squamous cell carcinoma, DJM-1 cell) were grown in low Ca++ medium for 4 days, then the cells were incubated in normal Ca++ medium containing 10% pemphigus (4 patients with pemphigus vulgaris and 4 patients with pemphigus foliaceus) or normal serum (treated at 56 degrees C, for 30 min) for various incubation periods (2, 6, 12, 24 h). The cells were fixed and stained with antikeratin antibody by the indirect immunofluorescence method so that the detachment of cell-cell contact was able to be clearly visualized by observing the cytoskeletal arrays of keratin filaments. The cells grown in normal Ca++ medium showed detachments of cell-cell contact 24-36 h after addition of any one of the pemphigus sera used in this study. The cells grown in low Ca++ medium formed no cell-cell contacts and expressed no pemphigus antigens. However, re-formation of cell-cell contacts and reexpression of the antigens were confirmed by immunofluorescence microscopy 30 min after the addition of Ca++ to the medium. The addition of any pemphigus vulgaris and foliaceus sera with Ca++ did not inhibit the regeneration of cell-cell contact and exerted no effects on the contact during the subsequent 12 h. However, after 24 h, these cells again lost the contact. These results indicate that pemphigus antibody and antigen reaction on the cell surface did not directly inhibit the Ca++-induced re-formation of cell-cell contact.\r"

In addition, the carboxylpropeptide was found at the cell surface and free in the ground substance. The aminopropeptide was only seen in fibrils, 20-30 nm in diameter, as previously reported. Ratios of pN-collagen/pC-collagen increased from 16 days embryonic to 3 and 9 days postembryonic skins.

We studied the course of pneumonia by histology, bronchoalveolar lavage, and quantification of colony-forming units in lungs. Mice with intact host defenses had an initial inflammatory response, consisting mostly of neutrophils, followed by a mononuclear cell infiltrate. Nocardiae were eradicated during the seven days after inoculation. Mice in which the early, predominantly neutrophil inflammatory response was prevented with mechlorethamine or antiserum to neutrophils had little inflammation, and nocardiae grew extensively. Mice in which cell-mediated immunity was impaired with cyclosporin A or cortisone acetate developed abscesses; neutrophils were abundant, but nocardiae proliferated. The occurrence of these three separate and distinct patterns suggested that both neutrophils and cell-mediated immunity are necessary for optimal control of N. asteroides infection.\r"

In highly diluted antiserum, titers of antibody to J5 LPS were reduced by 28%-41% after adsorption with seven strains of smooth gram-negative bacteria and by only 4% after adsorption with the Re mutant. Smooth gram-negative bacteria adsorbed virtually all antibody to Re LPS. Therefore, rabbit antiserum to J5 contains type-specific antibodies to core determinants distal to KDO that can obscure highly cross-reactive antibodies to lipid A-KDO in vitro. Cross-reactive antibodies are demonstrable by adsorption with whole bacteria at limiting concentrations of antibody.\r"

A restriction enzyme map of the operon was obtained, and the approximate termini of the gal genes were located by using transposon insertion mutagenesis and minicell analysis. We constructed a plasmid that contained a defined 0.4-kilobase deletion in the galE but still expressed galT and galK activities from the gal promoter. This galE deletion was recombined into the chromosomal gal operons of S. typhimurium and Salmonella typhi Ty2. The resulting strains were vigorous, nonreverting galE mutants that were sensitive to galactose-induced lysis at 0.2 mM galactose. The S. typhimurium galE derivatives were avirulent and protective in mice.\r"

We evaluated the use of a DNA probe, prepared from a 3.4-kilobase segment of the EHEC plasmid, to detect EHEC. The probe hybridized with 106 (99%) of 107 O157:H7 and 34 (77%) of 44 O26:H11, VT-positive strains from patients with colitis, HUS, and diarrheal disease and hybridized with 21 (81%) of 26 VT-positive E. coli of serotypes other than O157:H7 or O26:H11 from patients with hemorrhagic colitis and HUS. We examined 601 other strains, including 18 serotype O26 isolates of H types other than H11, 306 enteropathogenic E. coli, 60 enteroinvasive E. coli, 119 enterotoxigenic E. coli, and 20 isolates from the urinary tract and 77 isolates from the normal intestinal flora; only one (O127:H-) was positive (specificity, 99.8%). Serotype O26:H11, previously considered a classic enteropathogenic E. coli serotype, is now shown to be EHEC.\r"

Immunoglobulin antibodies to Borrelia or Treponema spirochetes, however, did not react with serovars of Leptospira interrogans in MA or IFA tests, and the prevalence of false-positive results in the reciprocal analyses was negligible.\r"

Five (38%) of 13 CMV infections were symptomatic and included hepatitis, pneumonitis, enteritis, and mononucleosis. Two of 14 patients with primary EBV infection subsequently developed, at two months and two years after initial infection, an EBV-associated lymphoproliferative syndrome, and one of 10 patients with reactivated EBV infection developed a possible EBV-associated febrile encephalopathy. Other viruses causing infection in these children included herpes simplex virus, varicella-zoster virus, adenovirus, parainfluenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, and rotavirus.\r"

Surveillance cultures were taken for oral HSV, and HSV culture and cytology were done for all oral lesions found. In a smaller number of patients, immune responses were determined. HSV reactivation was similar in the transplant and leukemic groups (46.8% vs. 50%), but a significant difference in the incidence of HSV lesion formation was noted between the two groups. Of the transplant patients in whom HSV reactivated, 31.8% developed HSV lesions; of leukemic patients in whom HSV reactivated, 100% developed HSV lesions. Differences in the incidence of formation of HSV lesions in these groups of immunosuppressed patients suggest that reactivation of HSV and formation of HSV lesions may involve different mechanisms. Low levels of antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity were noted in leukemic patients and may contribute to increased formation of HSV lesions in this group.\r"

The adsorption of the 24- and 28-kDa peptides to streptococci was inhibited by LTA. The two monoclonal antibodies that inhibited the binding of LTA to fibronectin reacted only with the 24- and 28-kDa fragments of fibronectin. Conversely, LTA, as well as lauric acid and oleic acid, blocked the binding of the same monoclonal antibodies to fibronectin.

Parasite antigen titers were significantly correlated with microfilarial counts in night blood smears (r = .64, P less than .01). Negative antigen tests in patients with clinical filariasis may be explained in part by antibody-mediated clearance of circulating antigen. Antibodies to circulating W. bancrofti antigen were detected in 41 of 55 antigen-negative sera from patients with clinical filariasis. Despite this limitation, detecting parasite antigen by enzyme immunoassay provides significant advantages over previously available methods for diagnosing active W. bancrofti infection.\r"

The results of employing these procedures are available on tens of thousands of pregnancies and offspring. This information has implications in applying some of the same technologies in human reproduction. The large number of normal progeny produced in cattle after a long prenatal development period, similar to humans, provides some assurance that these technologies, carefully applied, are safe.

  ".U": "87252682\r", 
  ".W": "There is a growing body of evidence for the role of free radicals in mediating myocardial tissue injury during myocardial ischemia and in particular during the phase of myocardial reoxygenation. Associated with myocardial ischemia and reperfusion is the generation of oxygen-derived free radicals from a variety of sources that include the mitochondrial electron transport chain; the biosynthesis of prostaglandins; the enzyme xanthine oxidase; and circulating elements in the blood, with the polymorphonuclear neutrophil assuming a primary focus of attention. Experimental studies have shown that free radical scavengers (e.g., N-[2-mercaptopropionyl]glycine) and enzymes that scavenge or degrade reactive species of oxygen (superoxide dismutase or catalase) can reduce the mass of myocardial tissue that undergoes irreversible injury. Additionally allopurinol, which inhibits the enzyme xanthine oxidase, reduces ultimate infarct size, putatively by reducing the xanthine oxidase generation of superoxide anion. Neutrophils that enter the ischemically injured myocardium under the influence of chemotactic attraction and activation of the complement system generate and release highly reactive and cytotoxic oxygen derivatives that are destructive to the vascular endothelium and to the cardiac myocytes. Studies have documented that neutrophil depletion or suppression of neutrophil function (ibuprofen, nafazatrom, BW 755C, or more recently with prostacyclin or iloprost) results in a significant salvage of myocardial tissue that is subjected to a period of regional ischemia followed by reperfusion. Our current understanding of the events associated with myocardial ischemia suggests that within the ischemic myocardial region or area at risk, there is a population of cells that are reversibly injured and that reperfusion within a specified period (less than 3 hours) of time is capable of restoring the majority of the jeopardized cells to a normal status, but that the act of reperfusion itself will lead to the sudden demise of a fraction of the cells because of the cytotoxic effects of reactive species of oxygen derived from one or more of the sources indicated above. The efforts to minimize the amount of tissue that undergoes cell death as a result of myocardial ischemia demand that early reperfusion be established. However, the reintroduction of molecular oxygen and the circulating elements of the blood will be associated with an \"explosive\" and self-limited destruction of some of the myocardial cells in the area at risk.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

In addition to its therapeutic role in psychiatric disease it is important to recognize that it has diverse effects on endocrine function. These include the development of hypothyroidism and goiter in up to 10% of patients. Hyperthyroidism is a rare but reported side effect. Other abnormalities include hypercalcemia, diabetes insipidus, and altered carbohydrate metabolism. Depending on the clinical situation it is usually not necessary to discontinue lithium treatment, but appropriate intervention to correct the resulting endocrine abnormality may be indicated. This review emphasizes that psychiatrists and clinicians caring for patients given lithium need to be aware of the possible endocrine effects of this drug.\r"

  ".U": "87252704\r", 
  ".W": "Experiments were designed to test the effect of a receptor antagonist of platelet activating factor (PAF), SRI63072, on inflammatory injury induced by in situ formation of immune complexes in two vascular districts of the rat that have different structural and hemodynamic characteristics: unilateral glomerulonephritis induced by perfusion of the left kidney of preimmunized animals with cationic human IgG, and passive reversed Arthus reaction in the skin. Three days after perfusion the left kidneys of rats not treated with SRI63072 (group I) were greatly enlarged, and pale and severe exudative and proliferative lesions were present in glomeruli. Granular deposits of human IgG, rat IgG, and rat C3 were seen by immunofluorescence microscopy, and subepithelial electron-dense deposits were visualized by electron microscopy. The right kidneys were consistently normal. The animals were severely proteinuric and had increased levels of PAF in the circulation. In contrast, rats treated with SRI63072 (group II) and studied at the same interval of time developed only mild, focal glomerulonephritis in the perfused kidneys. By immunofluorescence microscopy the glomerular deposits of human IgG and rat IgG were similar in quantity and distribution to those observed in rats of group I. Despite the fact that SRI63072 did not influence the level or the activity of the rat serum complement system, the deposits of C3 were less abundant and more focal. As in animals of group I, electron-dense deposits were present at the epithelial side of the glomerular basement membrane. Proteinuria was slight, and levels of circulating PAF were not significantly increased. These effects cannot be ascribed to interference of SRI63072 with antigen \"implantation,\" antibody binding, or local hemodynamic conditions, because the amounts of glomerular human and rat IgG were the same in treated and untreated rats; SRI63072 did not decrease the glomerular filtration rate; and SRI63072 prevented the increase in vascular permeability and the exudative lesions in passive Arthus reaction in the skin, a model less affected by hemodynamic changes than glomerulonephritis. The beneficial effect of SRI63072 indicates that PAF is an important mediator of the inflammatory process generated either in glomeruli or in the skin by in situ immune complex formation.\r"

  ".W": "To determine whether alpha-adrenergic stimulation impairs extrarenal potassium disposal in the rat, we studied the effect of an alpha-agonist and antagonist on the rise in plasma potassium concentration produced by a potassium infusion of 3 mEq KCl/kg over a 90-minute period to nephrectomized rats. Compared with KCl alone, the alpha-agonist phenylephrine caused more than a 25% increment in the peak plasma potassium, and reduced the volume of distribution of the potassium load. Addition of the alpha-blocker, phentolamine, to phenylephrine completely abolished the increment in potassium caused by KCl infusion. There were no differences in plasma bicarbonate, arterial pH, or plasma glucose levels among the groups. When an identical protocol was performed in nephrectomized rats also prepared by adrenalectomy, induction of diabetes, and chemical sympathectomy, the rise in plasma potassium level after KCl infusion was again augmented by phenylephrine. Addition of phentolamine also markedly blunted the increment in potassium in this group. These results show that alpha-adrenergics impair extrarenal potassium disposal in the rat. The effect does not depend on endogenous insulin or other potassium-regulatory factors. alpha-Adrenergics appear to play an important role in extrarenal potassium homeostasis.\r"

Unfortunately, most of these patients complain of somatic problems, not mood disturbances. Consequently, less than one half of all depressed patients in the primary care clinic are initially identified and treated for their depression. As depression causes considerable morbidity and some mortality and is treatable, methods of improving recognition should be sought. Some of these include maintaining a high index of suspicion, conducting a brief but thorough screening interview for depression, and using a depression rating scale. Benefits derived from early recognition include saving time, effort, and money spent on unnecessary tests and inappropriate treatment, and avoiding substantial suffering. The threshold for many somatic complaints can be substantially raised with resolution of depression.\r"

The tissues of intoxicated mice, administered various amounts of MA in single doses of from 0.01 to 1 mg of MA-HCl, were fixed in glutaraldehyde-containing fixatives. Cryostat and paraffin slices gave a positive reaction of MA localization by staining the brain, liver, kidney, lung, stomach, spleen, and so forth, with the aid of the indirect immunoperoxidase technique. Those of animals administered a single dose of 0.1 mg or more (over 3 to 4 mg/kg--the usual dose of MA in acute intoxication death in forensic medicine), in particular, gave a strong strong reaction, so that the diagnosis of MA intoxication can be performed by macroscopic observation of stained slices. The histochemical diagnosis of MA intoxication in clinical toxicology and pathology might be regarded as a useful tool, especially in forensic pathology. The following cells gave a strong positive reaction: nerve cells and myelin sheaths, hepatocytes, epithelial cells of the distal part of the renal tubule and of the collecting tubule, alveolar and bronchial epithelial cells of the lung, chief and parietal cells of the gastric gland, capillaries of the renal glomerulus, macrophages in the blood and tissues, and striated muscle cells including cardiocytes. The morphological evidence of the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of MA can be determined at the cellular level by immunocytochemistry.\r"

After subperineurial injection of labeled albumin, the albumin redistributed within intrafascicular clefts towards the perivascular spaces and the perineurium. These results suggest that, contrary to previous evidence, axons are exposed to serum proteins in normal nerves, and implies that they may be subject to interaction with abnormal proteins or altered serum proteins without any disruption of the BNB.\r"

  ".W": "From December 1982 to January 1986, 57 patients received allogeneic bone marrow transplantation as therapy for Philadelphia chromosome (Ph') positive chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). All patients were prepared for transplantation with cyclophosphamide 60 mg/kg (day -6, -5) and fractionated total body irradiation, 165 cGy twice daily (day -4, -3, -2, -1) and received major histocompatibility (MHC) matched donor marrow (day 0). All patients received graft-v-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis with methotrexate, prednisone, and either antithymocyte globulin (ATG) (55 patients) or OKT3 infusion (two patients). The projected survival of 29 chronic phase patients is 64% (95% confidence interval [Cl] 42% to 86%); and of 28 accelerated phase patients, 30% (95% Cl, 12% to 48%) at 30 months (P = .005). Multivariate regression analysis of pretransplant patient characteristics demonstrated that the presence of chronic phase and age less than 30 years were the only prognostic features studied that independently predicted survival. No evidence of persistent or recurrent disease has occurred in chronic phase patients; however, reappearance of the Ph' was observed in seven accelerated-phase patients, and hematologic relapse occurred in three of these seven patients. The incidence of grade II to IV acute GVHD is 63% (95% Cl, 50% to 76%) at 100 days, and that of extensive chronic GVHD is 53% (95% Cl, 33% to 74%) at 30 months. The median Karnofsky activity assessment of survivors is 100% (range, 60% to 100%), and all activity assessments less than 100% can be attributed to complications of GVHD. Bone marrow transplantation therapy for CML after preparation with cyclophosphamide and fractionated total body irradiation results in a high proportion of disease-free survival in chronic-phase patients. Survival in accelerated phase is significantly worse and is associated with relapse. GVHD has emerged as a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in this study.\r"

In 100 evaluable patients, the objective response rates were 35% for VMP and 61% for VAP, the complete response rates being 6% and 13%, respectively. In responding patients, median time to progression was 6.2 months for VMP and 7.9 months for VAP. The median survival whether measured from primary diagnosis, first metastasis, or from the start of chemotherapy was similar for both regimens. Toxicity, particularly alopecia, was appreciably lower in the VMP treated patients, but subclinical cardiotoxicity was seen within the scheduled dosage for both combinations. We conclude that VAP is clearly more active, but clinically more toxic than VMP. There is no survival advantage conferred by the more toxic combination. Cardiac toxicity is a potential hazard with either drug combination.\r"

Chemotherapeutic agents such as doxorubicin, which bind to DNA, are especially prone to cause severe extravasation skin ulcers. These ulcers are often chronic and progressive. Neither clinical nor experimental studies have shown an antidote to doxorubicin extravasation, which is best prevented by careful technique. If extravasation is suspected, the infusion should be immediately stopped. In the event of extravasation, elevation and ice are the currently recommended treatment. While small ulcerations may on occasion heal, large ulcerations require surgical excision for relief of pain and salvage of underlying tissues.\r"

Intravenously administered water labeled with oxygen-15 (H2(15)O) was used as a blood flow tracer to obtain five stimulated-state and two resting-state blood flow images in each of eight normal volunteers. Three cutaneous surfaces were tested: lips, fingers, and toes. Intense, highly focal SI responses were seen during all 39 stimulated-state trials. The SI responses from the three stimulation sites were anatomically distinct and formed a medial-to-lateral homonculus in every subject. Response magnitudes (increase in local blood flow) and response locales (expressed as proportionately measured bicommissural stereotaxic coordinates) were highly consistent among subjects and on repeated trials for each subject. These findings suggest that eliciting cerebral blood flow responses by cutaneous vibration provides a safe, rapid, and reproducible tool for locating and assessing the functional status of somatosensory cortex, and offers potential clinical and research utility. This study has established normative values for future applications of this experimental paradigm.\r"

Immunohistochemical studies revealed an intimate association between intracortical VIP-containing neurons and small blood vessels. Intracortical injection of a VIP solution (10(-5) M) produced significantly higher blood flow in the treated cortex (mean +/- standard error of the mean: 46.2 +/- 4.0 ml/100 gm/min) than in the untreated cortex (36.9 +/- 2.4 ml/100 gm/min). These data suggest that intracortical VIP-containing neurons produce dilatation of intracortical blood vessels.\r"

The introduction of computerized tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging has represented a major advance in the early detection of these cysts. The risks associated with the management of benign space-occupying lesions by open surgical procedures have made it necessary to search for safer techniques. The CT-stereotaxic method provides a simple, precise, and safe method of puncturing deep-seated space-occupying cysts. Between January, 1979, and December, 1984, 12 patients with colloid cysts in the foramen of Monro and third ventricle were operated on by this method. The operations were successful, and there were no intraoperative or postoperative complications. The advantages of the CT-stereotaxic method are discussed and the results are presented.\r"

  ".U": "87253377\r", 
  ".W": "Estrogen receptor (ER) analysis was performed in 70 meningioma samples by means of two assays: an enzyme immunoassay that used monoclonal antibodies against human ER protein (estrophilin), and a sensitive radioligand binding assay that used iodine-125-labeled estradiol as the radioligand. Low levels of ER immunoreactivity were found in tumors from 51% of patients, whereas ER binding activity was demonstrated in 40% of the meningiomas examined. In eight (11%) of the tissue samples, multiple binding sites for estradiol were observed. The immunoreactive binding sites corresponded to those of the classic high-affinity ER. In ligand binding studies, however, measurement of classic ER was considerably influenced by a second low-affinity high-capacity estrogen binding component, even at low ligand concentrations. Binding activity of the progesterone receptor (PR) and androgen receptor (AR) was determined concurrently using 17 alpha-methyl-3H-promegestone (3H-R 5020) and 17 alpha-methyl-3H-trienolone (3H-R 1881), a synthetic gestagen and androgen, respectively. High concentrations of PR were detected in 53 (76%) of the tumors, whereas a moderate number of AR binding sites were demonstrated in 33 (47%) of the tumors. A positive correlation between ER immunoreactivity and AR binding activity is suggestive of estrogen regulation of AR via the ER system. The presence of gonadal steroid receptors in a large proportion of meningiomas and the tendency toward a dependence of receptor concentrations on the histological subtype of the meningioma could have implications for tumor therapy.\r"

  ".W": "A noninvasive method was developed for quantitating the distribution of renal arteriovenous transit times of technetium-99m (99mTc) radiopharmaceuticals. Using this method, the characteristic transit times and amplitudes of the first two components of [99mTC] DTPA or MDP transit through the renal vasculature were calculated. The first component amplitude (A1) was evaluated for its ability to discriminate between 20 hypertensive patients with renovascular disease and 21 normotensive subjects. A1 was compared with three other quantitative indices: the ascending slope of the initial renal time-activity curve, the kidney-to-aorta slope ratio (K/A), and renal size. A1 nearly perfectly separated the hypertensive patients from the normotensive subjects; the ability of A1 to discriminate between these two groups is clearly superior to renal size, the initial renal slope, and K/A. We conclude that measurements of the intrarenal distribution of blood flow have distinct advantages over indices of renal blood flow that have been derived from scintillation camera measurements of 99mTc radiopharmaceuticals.\r"

  ".W": "In order to assess the effects of glucose, insulin, and exercise on skeletal muscle blood flow in vivo, we measured positron emission from the thigh muscle of anesthetized rabbits after simultaneous aortic bolus injection of 82Rb and radiolabeled microspheres (15 micron diameter). Estimates of flow with 82Rb were based on first-pass regional extraction of 82Rb by skeletal muscle. Flow estimates were made serially as a function of variations in plasma glucose and insulin and changing the muscle contractile state by electrical stimulation. Flow ranged from 3.1 ml/min/100 g at rest to 71 ml/min/100 g during stimulation. There was good agreement between the two methods of flow measurement over the entire range of flows (r = 0.96 at a slope of 0.90). Flow measured by either method did not vary significantly from baseline over a range of plasma glucose from 5 to 30 mM and plasma insulin from 0 to 20 microU/ml. When flow was increased up to 20-fold by electrical stimulation there was a decrease in extraction of 82Rb proportional to the increase in flow. However, at pharmacologic levels of insulin (greater than 150 microU/ml) flow was increased twofold as measured by radiolabeled microspheres, but not as measured by rubidium. There was no apparent decrease in extraction of 82Rb with high insulin. The discrepancy between the microsphere measured flow and rubidium measured flow with high plasma insulin levels can be explained by the assumption that the expected decrease in the extraction fraction was counteracted by an increase in Na+/K+-ATPase activity. It is concluded that the first-pass flow model gives valid estimates of skeletal muscle blood flow in vivo with 82Rb, provided that plasma insulin levels are normal.\r"

In two-kidney, one-clip (renin-dependent) hypertension, captopril (1.5 mg/kg bolus with 1.5 mg/min infusion) reduced mean arterial pressure (MAP) and ipsilateral glomerular filtration rate (GFR) without changes in the contralateral kidney. Captopril infusion resulted in alterations in both the [99mTc]DTPA and [131I]hippuran studies, which were most evident in the 15-min [99mTc]DTPA renal flow studies. In one-kidney, one-clip (volume-dependent) hypertension, captopril reduced MAP but did not alter GFR, renal plasma flow, or the radionuclide studies. These studies suggest that the [99mTc]DTPA renal flow study coupled with captopril challenge may unmask intrarenal angiotensin II-dependent functional and hemodynamic changes of the stenotic kidney, and offers promise in the detection of renin-dependent hypertension.\r"

Six healthy male volunteers ingested a tablet containing 300 mg of theophylline mixed with 3.7 MBq of [99mTc]DTPA. Anterior and posterior scintigraphic views of the abdomen were collected serially over 8 hr, after which a 200-ml solution containing 37 MBq of [99mTc] pertechnetate was ingested in order to visualize the contours of the stomach. The in vivo activity contained in the tablet was calculated from the scintigraphic views after correction of background activity, radioactive decay, and depth attenuation. The dissolution rate of [99mTc] DTPA was also measured in vitro and compared with the dissolution rate of theophylline. The results showed close dissolution rates between [99mTc]DTPA and theophylline in vivo (T1/2 184 min and 176 min, respectively), and a faster early dissolution rate of [99mTc]DTPA in vitro (T1/2 92 min versus 156 min for theophylline). The mean gastroduodenal and duodenocecal times were 72 +/- 25 min (m +/- s.d.) and 245 +/- 15 min, respectively. Scintigraphic imaging of labeled formulations with 99mTc present useful applications in pharmaceutics and pharmacology.\r"

  ".W": "Cysteine, via chelation reactions, ameliorates biochemical lesions caused by excessive ingestion of several trace elements. Because oral cysteine per se is considerably more protective than the in vivo metabolic cysteine precursors, methionine or cystine, chelation of cysteine with trace elements likely occurs primarily in the gut, thereby decreasing absorption of both cysteine and the trace element in question. Hence, using copper as an example, orally administered cysteine markedly improves growth and reduces liver copper deposition in chicks or rats fed a high level of inorganic copper. Likewise, excessive copper ingestion impairs sulfur amino acid (SAA) utilization and increases the dietary requirement for SAA. Cobalt and selenium toxicities are also ameliorated by oral cysteine ingestion, with the responses being even more striking than those occurring with copper toxicity. While inorganic arsenic poisonings are generally ameliorated by administering cysteine or a cysteine derivative (e.g., dimercaptopropanol), organic pentavalent arsenic toxicity is exacerbated by cysteine administration. Cysteine in this instance acts as a reducing agent, facilitating conversion of organic pentavalent arsenicals such as roxarsone and arsanilic acid to the more toxic trivalent state.\r"

Results from use of this technique show that PDV of cattle account for 8-10% of body tissue, but 18-25% of whole animal O2 consumption. Similarly, HEP tissues account for 1-2% of body tissues, but more of whole animal O2 consumption than PDV. Glucose, volatile fatty acids (VFA), glutamate and glutamine are used as substrates by PDV; ketones, alanine and glycine are major products of PDV metabolism that are transported to HEP tissues along with absorbed VFA, ammonia, amino acids and other products of digestion. Most amino acids, L-lactate, propionate and butyrate and ammonia in blood from PDV are removed by HEP tissues, which in turn release glucose, glutamate, branched-chain amino acids, ketones, acetate and urea to peripheral blood. Net HEP flux of glucose measured by this technique is compatible with glucose requirements for lactation and other metabolism; similarly, HEP uptake of ammonia and alpha-amino N can account for 95% of HEP release of urea N. The technique is a powerful tool for quantitation of intermediary metabolism.\r"

  ".W": "Hepatic and alimentary ketogenesis occur at similar rates in fed, nonpregnant, nonlactating goats, sheep and dairy cows. Alimentary ketogenesis begins to diminish within 24 h after fasting but compensatory increases in hepatic ketogenesis maintain total splanchnic release and, therefore, no change in circulating concentrations of ketone bodies is observed. By the third day of fast the gut is utilizing acetoacetate and beta-hydroxybutyrate and alimentary ketogenesis has ceased. Hepatic ketogenesis of both ketone bodies accelerates rapidly due to portal-drained visceral and hindquarter lipolysis and subsequent hepatic fatty acid uptake and total circulating concentrations are doubled. During pregnancy and lactation in sheep and cows alimentary ketogenesis is maintained as long as digestible organic matter intake is constant. Hepatic and total splanchnic release of beta-hydroxybutyrate increases in late gestation and early lactation. Again, this is due to increased portal-drained visceral and hindquarter free fatty acid release and hepatic free fatty acid uptake. Hindquarter uptake of both ketones during late gestation is similar to the ratio observed in nonpregnant fed sheep but the percentage of utilization decreases, perhaps reflecting partitioning to uteroplacental tissues. Hindquarter uptake of both ketone bodies in sheep increases in early lactation due to increased circulating concentrations because extraction ratios are similar to those of fed animals. Ketosis during pregnancy in sheep and lactation in cows may be prevented by beta-hydroxybutyrate stimulation of pancreatic insulin production. However, an insulin-independent intrahepatic mechanism apparently occurs in sheep.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The ability of pediatricians and hospital laboratory personnel to detect group A streptococci in patients with suspected streptococcal pharyngitis was evaluated using the TestPack Strep A and anaerobic culture. Duplicate throat specimens (for similar processing by both the pediatricians and laboratory technologists) were simultaneously collected on rayon-tipped swabs from patients with symptoms of pharyngitis. Each swab was first inoculated to a 5% sheep blood agar plate, then tested for group A streptococcus antigen using the TestPack Strep A according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cultures were incubated anaerobically at 35 degrees C for 2 nights unless positive after 1 night. Group A streptococci were identified using specific antisera. Pediatric office or laboratory cultures from 112 (31.3%) of the 358 patients contained group A streptococci. Of the patients with positive cultures, 96 (85.7%) and 107 (95.5%) were detected by the pediatricians and laboratory, respectively. Respective findings with the TestPack Strep A by the pediatricians and laboratory were sensitivity 68.8% and 74.8%, specificity 94.3% and 95.6%, predictive value of a positive result 81.5% and 87.9%, and predictive value of a negative result 89.2% and 89.9%. Anaerobic culture was significantly more sensitive than the TestPack Strep A for detection of group A streptococci by both the pediatricians (P less than 0.005) and laboratory personnel (P less than 0.05).\r"

  ".W": "A controlled prospective study was undertaken to compare the efficacy and benefits of home and hospital treatment for patients with exacerbations of pulmonary disease caused by cystic fibrosis. A total of 41 home and 41 hospital treatments were analyzed. Home and hospital patients were matched according to sex, age, pulmonary function tests, and arterial blood gas values. Both home and hospital treatments resulted in statistically significant improvement in pulmonary function. A comparison of these values did not show any statistically significant difference between groups at admission or discharge. Furthermore, the mean number of treatment days for both groups, individually determined by the primary physician, was equivalent (home 17.7 +/- 1.1 days, hospital 18.1 +/- 4.1). The mean charge for a home treatment was approximately $10,000, and for a hospital treatment $18,000. Sixty-five percent of home care patients and 68% of hospital patients required retreatment for pulmonary exacerbations within the study period; the interval between pulmonary exacerbations for the two groups was not significantly different. In addition, 85% of patients receiving treatment at home were able to maintain at least some of their school or work activities. These data indicate that home therapy for cystic fibrosis patients with pulmonary exacerbations is less costly and is as effective as in-hospital therapy.\r"

She had typical facies, a cardiac defect, hypoparathyroidism, severe T and B cell immunodeficiency, and low levels of facteur thymique serique (FTS). In vitro incubation of the peripheral blood lymphocytes with thymosin alpha 1 showed no increase in the number of T cells on two occasions. A fetal thymus for transplantation was not available, and further review of past experience with thymic cells or factors revealed inconsistent and incomplete responses. Because of the patient's worsening clinical and immunologic status, BMT was performed, with her histocompatible brother as donor. The patient has had a good clinical and immunologic response to BMT, with evidence of T cell engraftment, improved B cell function, and increased levels of serum FTS. This experience indicates that minimal thymic influence is necessary for successful BMT and that patients with DiGeorge syndrome with significant T cell deficiency may benefit from this treatment.\r"

  ".W": "Twelve pediatric patients, aged 28 months to 17 years, received OKT3 to reverse renal allograft rejection. In 11 patients, the rejection crisis was resistant to conventional antirejection therapy with high doses of prednisone or polyclonal antithymocyte globulin. Reversal of rejection was successful in 10 patients who completed a treatment course. Because of recurring resistant rejection, five patients received a second course of OKT3, which was successful in reversing the rejection crisis in two. Among these patients, the persistence or the appearance of high levels of circulating T3 lymphocytes after initiating the second treatment course correlated with treatment failure. The immediate side effects associated with OKT3 therapy were transient and medically manageable. We conclude that this monoclonal antibody preparation is a safe and effective treatment for pediatric renal allograft in recipients experiencing rejection crisis resistant to conventional therapy. However, the potential impact of this immunosuppressive medication on long-term renal allograft survival in this patient population remains to be determined.\r"

We describe 17 tumors that fit into the pathologic spectrum of CMN proposed by Beckwith, which ranges from benign renal tumors, through atypical \"gray zone\" lesions of more aggressive potential, to \"crossover\" tumors akin to clear cell sarcoma of kidney. Nine patients with histologically typical CMN were significantly younger and had smaller tumors than did eight patients with atypical CMN. Clinical features did not differ in the two groups of patients. A distinctive \"ring sign\" on renal sonography was commonly seen in patients with typical intrarenal CMN. All 17 patients were alive with no evidence of disease at a mean follow-up of 10 years. Nephrectomy was adequate therapy for younger infants and for those with typical CMN. Nephrectomy was probably also adequate therapy for infants 3 months of age or younger with atypical CMN, even if the tumor extended to the surgical resection margins and into the perinephric connective tissues. Adjuvant chemotherapy or radiation or both should be reserved for patients older than 3 months who have grossly unresected tumors and for those patients whose tumors have an unequivocally malignant histologic appearance or evidence of aggressive biologic behavior.\r"

After 10, 20, 30, 40, and 60 minutes incubation of rat aortic tissue with either plasma or buffer, the presence of PGI2 was studied by measuring by radioimmunoassay (RIA) the concentration of 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha (6-keto-PGF1 alpha). 6-keto-PGF1 alpha production increased with time in the two groups of plasma samples and in the presence of buffer, but 6-keto-PGF1 alpha production (ng/mg dried tissue) after 30 minutes incubation and mean 6-keto-PGF1 alpha production (slope of regression line, ng/mg/min) were significantly (P less than 0.01) lower in the presence of normal plasma compared with buffer, and significantly (P less than 0.01) higher in the presence of HUS plasma compared with normal plasma. There was no significant difference between buffer and HUS plasma. We conclude that, under our experimental conditions, normal plasma had an inhibitory activity on 6-keto-PGF1 alpha production by rat aorta. This inhibitory activity was absent in HUS plasma.\r"

Bay K 8644 or CGP 28392 alone had no effect on renin release from the slices, whereas both compounds produced a concentration-dependent inhibition of the release in the presence of 15 mM potassium. The Bay K 8644-induced inhibitory action was more effective and potent than that seen with CGP 28392. Bay K 8644 caused a leftward shift of the dose-response curve of the potassium-induced decrease in renin release. In contrast, the dose-response relationships of the release to norepinephrine and methoxamine were not affected by Bay K 8644. The combination of the maximum effective doses of calcium channel agonists and norepinephrine exerted an apparent additive effect on the release of renin. The inhibitory effects of Bay K 8644 and CGP 28392 were attenuated in the presence of decreased extracellular calcium concentrations. Nifedipine and verapamil elicited a blocking action on the inhibition of renin release by Bay K 8644 or CGP 28392, in a concentration-dependent manner. Calmodulin antagonists, such as trifluoperazine and calmidazolium suppressed significantly the decreasing effect of Bay K 8644 or CGP 28392 on renin release from the slices.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

This condition resembles human type I diabetes. IDDM developed in 0 of 11 (0%) mice prophylactically treated with 10 mg of cyclosporine A (CyA) per kg s.c. every 4th day from 8 to 26 weeks of age; 8 of 10 (80%) of sex- and age-matched controls developed IDDM; 2 of 8 (25%) followed up to 5 months beyond the time of drug administration developed IDDM. The distribution of specific radioactivity ([3H]CyA) was used to calculate the concentrations of CyA in serum, blood cells and various organs. Serum values of CyA produced by radioimmunoassay were higher than those estimated by the [3H]CyA method. Pancreata of CyA-treated mice were histologically normal. Pancreata of control mice showed lymphocytic infiltration of the islets of Langerhans. Neither hepatotoxicity nor nephrotoxicity assessed by biochemical and histological data was detectable in CyA-treated mice. The insulin secretory capacity of trypan blue viable functional pancreatic islets isolated post-treatment; was significantly lower in controls than in CyA-treated mice; islet content of insulin was not statistically different between controls and CyA-treated mice. We conclude that low nontoxic doses of CyA abrogate completely the development of diabetes in the female nonobese diabetic mouse and abolish lymphocytic infiltration of the islets of Langerhans against which there is autoimmunity. The effect of CyA persists well past the duration of therapy.\r"

In anesthetized rabbits, the i.v. administration of thrombin reduced the circulating number of platelets from 256,000 +/- 32,000/microliter to 8 +/- 2% of the initial value, and produced a right ventricular thrombus of 285 +/- 52 mg. All animals died within 5 min. PGI2 (0.3 microgram/kg/min) or HL 725 (2 micrograms/kg/min) did not prevent the thrombin-induced fall in the number of circulating platelets, the formation of a right ventricular thrombus or death. Administration of 2 mg/kg of CGS 13080 reduced significantly the mass of the right ventricular thrombus, but did not prevent completely the reduction in the circulating platelet count or death. After the administration of the combination of CGS 13080 with HL 725, the thrombocytopenia was transient, the right ventricular thrombus was reduced (P less than .05), and survival increased to 75% (P less than .05). The combination of PGI2 with HL 725 was similar in benefit to the combination of CGS 13080 and HL 725. Survival for the group of the combination of CGS 13080 with 725 was significantly greater than survival in the CGS 13080 or HL 725 groups, indicating a synergistic effect for the combination. The decrease in blood pressure response to HL 725 was greater with PGI2, but not with CGS 13080.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

This compound inhibits rat intestinal sucrase, maltase, isomaltase, glucoamylase and trehalase activities at micromolar concentrations. It is a much weaker inhibitor of alpha-amylase and lactase. Inhibition of sucrase was competitive with sucrose. In mice, MDL 25,637 inhibited the rise in serum glucose after a sucrose or starch load but not after a glucose load. MDL 25,637 also reduced the glycemic response to sucrose in rats. The drug was most effective when administered 0 to 30 min before the sucrose load and was as effective in streptozotocin-treated rats as in normals. The inhibition by MDL 25,637 of intestinal glucohydrolases is an effective means of reducing the hyperglycemic response to an oral sucrose or starch load and, as such, warrants further investigation as a potential drug for the treatment of diabetes mellitus.\r"

Most of these abnormalities probably would not have been identified without the screening examination. Also, the finding of an abnormal fetal cardiac position was often the main indication of a noncardiac abnormality, such as a diaphragmatic hernia. Screening imaging of the fetal cardiac position and four chambers appears to be a productive addition to the fetal anatomy survey for our particular mix of high- and low-risk patients.\r"

We provide evidence herein that resting serum levels of estrone are increased and that resting serum testosterone (T) and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) levels are decreased in male patients with SLE. The decreased serum T levels were observed even after the IV administration of 25 micrograms of LH-RH. The high basal serum prolactin (PRL) levels observed in these patients with SLE is a novel finding not previously reported that could explain why serum T and DHT levels are low in this syndrome. We observed a decrease in the pituitary response to LH-RH stimulation; this low response could also be a hormonal manifestation of hyperprolactinemia. Furthermore, it has been suggested that PRL plays a role in immunocompetence, and therefore it could have influence either directly or indirectly in the altered immunoregulation observed in SLE.\r"

Digital blood flow at room temperature was measured by venous occlusion plethysmography as perfusion pressures were lowered by elevating the hand above the level of the heart. After placebo, there was a small reduction in digital blood flow without any alteration in the perfusion pressure. After nifedipine, there was a significant reduction in both perfusion pressure and digital blood flow at each level of hand elevation. When analyzed as pressure-flow relationships, there was no significant change after nifedipine, indicating that the fall in blood flow could be accounted for by the reduction in perfusion pressure. Four of the placebo group developed Raynaud's phenomenon after the baseline study, whereas none developed Raynaud's phenomenon after nifedipine. Our results suggest that although nifedipine may reduce vascular reactivity, caution is warranted in use of this drug in patients with threatened digital ischemia because of the possibility that digital blood flow may be reduced.\r"

  ".W": "From August 1980 through May 1984, 102 adult pedestrian patients with 130 tibial fractures were admitted to the Shock Trauma Center of the Maryland Institute for Emergency Medical Services Systems. We reviewed their records for admission status, procedures performed, and results: 32 patients who died, underwent primary amputation, or were lost to followup were excluded, leaving 70 patients with 86 tibial fractures as the base study group. We grouped the data by year of admission and analyzed it in terms of the effects of changes in the treatment protocol on results, specifically the time to union. For the first year, the existing treatment protocol included: antibiotics, debridement and irrigation with a bulb syringe, stabilization according to wound size and surgeon preference, split-thickness skin graft, and bone grafting in response to delayed or nonunion. The average time to union for Grade III fractures was 58.39 weeks; average time overall was 53.95 weeks. In the fourth year, the altered treatment protocol included: antibiotics, debridement and jet lavage, scheduled rebridement, external fixation for open fractures, judicious use of open reduction/internal fixation for closed fractures, early free flap soft-tissue coverage, and early bone grafting by history and fracture pattern. The average time to union for Grade III fractures was 37.65 weeks; average time overall was 34.46 weeks. From the first to the fourth year, time to union for Grade III fractures decreased by 64.5% and time to union overall decreased by 63.9%. We feel the decrease is a direct result of early bone grafting, the fixator construct used, and judicious use of open reduction/internal fixation.\r"

When blunt abdominal aortic injury is suspected without distal ischemia, aortography may be used to define or exclude the injury and further therapy.

The urothelium samples were taken from seven human fetuses (aged seven to 21 weeks) and 19 adults. The adults were blood group A and O individuals, and their antigen expression was compared to ABO, secretor, and erythrocyte Lewis status. Detailed data on the histological location of the antigens were obtained by means of immunohistochemical methods. In fetuses expression of Lewis a and A antigens was stage-dependent, whereas the Lewis b and H antigens were consistently present at all stages. In adults the urothelial blood group antigen expression seemed to be correlated to ABO and secretor status, but not to erythrocyte Lewis type. Secretors expressed primarily ABO isoantigens on their cell membranes, whereas non-secretors (four individuals) expressed inappropriate Lewis antigens. Examination of the histological distribution of the antigens showed results different from earlier examined epithelia. In adult bladder urothelium from A secretors, only the most complex antigens (Leb, A, ALeb) were present in the basal germinative cell layer, whereas the luminal umbrella cell layer expressed both these antigens and showed a unique expression of less complex precursor antigens (H, Lea), as well as sialylated Lewis a antigens.\r"

Hybridomas were cloned after being prepared by cell fusion between mouse myeloma cell line X63Ag 8.653 and the spleen cells of BALB/c mice hyperimmune to the bladder cancer cells (grade 2) from a patient. Subsequently 12 MoAb-producing clones were obtained for the panel screening by enzyme immunoassay (EIA) and three MoAbs (no. 10, 11 and 14) were selected for reactivity to bladder cancer cells from patients, including normal epithelia. Finally No. 10 was selected as the most appropriate MoAb for this study and determined IgM with kappa-light chains by EIA. We accurately tested MoAb No. 10's reactivity with 71 malignant tumors by immunoperoxidase staining (IIP). No. 10 reacted to most TCCB cells (36/43), but did not react to any of the other tissues, including five normal epithelia, two brain tumors and three sarcomas. It was also shown by both IIP and immunofluorescent staining (IIF) that No. 10's reactivity was limited to the cancer cell membrane. These results suggest that the antigen recognized by MoAb No. 10 is one of the tumor-associated antigens and that some heterogeneity exists in its distribution.\r"

We studied 21 patients in whom obstructive nephropathy was relieved by operative or nonoperative methods. Anuria persisted from 2 to 14 days. In these patients urinary excretion of alpha-glucosidase, gamma-glutamyl-transferase, N-acetyl glucosaminidase and beta-2-microglobulin, as well as the serum creatinine were assessed weekly. Serum creatinine was the earliest index to return to normal (within 9 to 26 days). Enzymuria returned to normal within 35 to 45 days, whereas normal urinary excretion of beta-2-microglobulin occurred more than 100 days after relief of obstructive nephropathy. N-acetyl glucosaminidase and gamma-glutamyl-transferase proved to be more reliable than alpha-glucosidase in detecting recovery of the luminal membrane of the proximal tubule. The return to normal of urinary beta-2-microglobulin levels has been shown to occur later, since more specific and complex intracellular functions underlie this index. The pathophysiological aspects of recovery of obstructive nephropathy may be considered similar to those observed in ischemic acute renal failure, since in both instances hemodynamic changes are involved.\r"

Of 50 surgically removed donor kidneys examined with conventional aortography only before the routine use of intravenous digital subtraction angiography the number of renal arteries was demonstrated accurately in 46 (92 per cent). Intravenous digital subtraction angiography offers advantages over conventional aortography, including most importantly the routine performance on an outpatient basis, and decreased film cost and examination time. Although the accuracy of conventional aortography (92 per cent) in detecting the number of renal arteries is slightly greater than that for intravenous digital subtraction angiography (89 per cent), the advantages of the digital examination justify its use as the initial examination for the potential renal donor. Conventional aortography can be reserved for use in patients with equivocal or technically inadequate digital examinations.\r"

Since heparin itself does not coat the plastic catheter surface, a complex of heparin with tridodecylmethylammonium chloride (TDMAC) was used which results in hydrophobic association of hydrocarbon chains of the TDMAC with the catheter leaving the quaternary ammonium moiety of TDMAC exposed to the surface forming ionic bonds with the highly anionic sulfate groups of heparin. Coating latex catheter material with TDMAC without heparin resulted in 3.6-fold higher adherence whereas coating with the TDMAC-heparin complex reduced adherence to less than 10% of control untreated latex. TDMAC-heparin also significantly reduced bacterial adherence to teflon coated latex (Bardex) and vinyl catheter material. Less than 30% of the original heparin was removed after wash periods of up to one week. These results indicate that TDMAC-heparin coating of urethral catheters reduces bacterial adherence and thereby may delay the acquisition of catheter associated urinary tract infection.\r"

Whether THP interacts with the transitional epithelium in vivo and facilitates adhesin mediated attachment of E. coli is not known. Using immunohistochemical techniques we could not identify THP associated with formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded transitional epithelium from a variety of sites within the urinary tract. However, varying levels of THP associated with the washed exfoliated transitional cells from 10 different subjects were detected by indirect radioimmunoassay methodologies. After in vitro incubation in human urine the mean interaction of THP with the exfoliated transitional cells increased significantly but closely paralleled the mean interaction of THP with exfoliated vaginal and buccal epithelial cells after identical incubation. We conclude that the interaction of THP with transitional cells in vivo is nonspecific and occurs after detachment from the mucosa. THP may act as a natural host defense against E. coli bacteriuria by inhibition of adhesion mediated bacterial adherence to the urothelium.\r"

Sixty-six patients underwent IV-DSA as well as CT during a 2-year period. Sixty-four of the 66 patients underwent abdominal aortic aneurysm repair. The results of the 66 patients were analyzed to assess what additional information was obtained by IV-DSA concerning aneurysm size, vascular anomalies, visceral arterial anatomy, associated aneurysmal disease, and iliofemoral and distal occlusive disease. On the basis of this study, it is suggested that IV-DSA has a limited role in the preoperative evaluation of patients with abdominal aortic aneurysm.\r"

We report a case of a mycotic internal carotid artery aneurysm resulting from Salmonella enteritidis. A 20-year review of both the foreign and English language literature revealed only one other case of a mycotic carotid aneurysm resulting from Salmonella infection. The cornerstone of therapy in the past had been proximal ligation. More recently, primary reconstructive procedures with either an end-to-end anastomosis or an interposition vein graft have been described. The present case was managed with an end-to-end technique with the use of a Pruitt-Inahara shunt.\r"

Liver biopsy specimens had characteristic histological appearance, and diagnosis of adenoviral infection was confirmed with monoclonal antiadenoviral antibodies, electron microscopy, and by culture of liver tissue. In the remaining 17 patients, adenovirus was isolated from urine, stool, throat secretions, and/or blood samples, but none had any detectable visceral infection. Serotypes 1 and 2 predominated, similar to children not receiving transplants during the same time period. Three of the patients with hepatitis are alive and well; two died of liver failure. Adenoviral hepatitis did not recur in the second allograft of a patient who underwent retransplantation for combined rejection and adenoviral hepatitis, and appears, therefore, not to be a contraindication to retransplantation when liver failure ensues.\r"

The evolution of the levels of plasma glucose, insulin, and free fatty acids was followed during the 6 hr following the oral load. Carbohydrate and lipid oxidation rates were assessed simultaneously by continuous indirect calorimetry during the 6 hr following the oral load. Plasma glucose and insulin peaks occurred 30 min after ingestion of the load for both sugars. The peak of the delta glucose concentration was significantly smaller after maltitol than after sucrose (21 +/- 4 vs 38 +/- 4 mg/100 ml, p less than 0.02), as was the peak of the delta insulin concentration (9.3 +/- 2.7 microU/ml after maltitol vs 25.5 +/- 5.0 microU/ml after sucrose, p less than 0.001). The peak of the stimulation of glucose oxidation occurred 60 min after the load of sucrose and 90 min after the load of maltitol. The delta glucose oxidation was significantly lower with maltitol than with sucrose during the first 90 min after the ingestion of the load. It was slightly higher (although not significantly) with maltitol than with sucrose starting from the 210th min. Maltitol resulted in a cumulated suprabasal glucose oxidation which amounted to 40% that obtained with sucrose after 180 min.\r"

In the present report the cytoplasmic reactivity of MoAb DF3 within a spectrum of benign and malignant breast lesions was studied to define whether the DF3 antigen is expressed in the cytoplasm of potentially premalignant lesions, i.e., atypical hyperplasias, or early malignant lesions, i.e., in situ carcinomas. Biopsy specimens of breast lesions from 108 women, including 28 patients with invasive carcinoma, 12 with in situ carcinoma, 17 with atypical hyperplasia, 25 with proliferative lesions without atypia, and 26 with nonproliferative lesions, were examined for DF3 antigen expression with the use of an indirect immunohistochemical method. Atypical hyperplasias were less reactive with MoAb DF3 than invasive carcinomas (P = .05 by Wilcoxon rank sum test). No significant statistical differences were observed, however, between invasive carcinomas and in situ carcinomas or between in situ carcinomas and atypical hyperplasias on the basis of cytoplasmic DF3 reactivity. Invasive carcinomas, in situ carcinomas, and atypical hyperplasias, however, demonstrated significantly higher reactivity with MoAb DF3 in the cytoplasm than proliferative lesions without atypia and nonproliferative lesions (P less than .01). These studies demonstrate that atypical hyperplasias express elevated levels of a given tumor-associated antigen and thus provide further immunologic evidence that these lesions are premalignant.\r"

N-Nitroso-N-propylurea [(NPU) CAS: 816-57-9] induces high incidence of thymic lymphoma in F344 rats. In the present experiments, the location of NPU-target cells was examined in F344 rats. In the first experiment, bone marrow cells from NPU-treated male rats were inoculated into sublethally irradiated female rats. However, neither thymic nor other types of leukemias were induced in these rats. In the following experiment, thymectomized male rats received grafts sc with normal thymuses of age-matched female F344 rats. Continuous administration of NPU to the rats successfully induced 9 thymic lymphomas in the grafted thymuses. In 8 thymic lymphomas analyzed, 6 consisted of donor cells and the other 2 consisted of recipient cells. The present results from these 2 experiments strongly suggested that NPU-induced rat thymic lymphomas originate from intrathymic cells but not from bone marrow cells. In other words, target cells of leukemogenic activity of the chemical carcinogen NPU probably exist in the thymus of F344 rats.\r"

With the use of a direct-binding liquid competition radioimmunoassay (RIA), capable of providing truly quantitative analysis of the 21,000-dalton (p21) ras oncogene and protooncogene products, absolute levels of Ha-ras p21 have been determined in human breast and colon carcinomas, benign lesions, and/or their respective normal tissues. Enhanced Ha-ras expression was documented in 66% of breast and 100% of colon carcinomas as compared with their normal counterparts, with levels in breast carcinomas ranging from 10.1 to 50.4 pg ras p21/micrograms protein and those in colon carcinomas ranging from 18.4 to 51.7 pg ras p21/micrograms protein. Some dysplastic lesions of the breast and colon also contained elevated Ha-ras p21. Relative levels of Ha-ras p21 expression, detected by competition RIA, correlated with percent Ha-ras p21-positive cells as determined by immunohistochemical assays. By use of liquid competition RIA and immunohistochemical assays, it has been shown that levels of ras p21 expression did not always correlate between primary and metastatic colon lesions of the same patient. The use of the quantitative RIA and semiquantitative immunohistochemical assays, in concert with cDNA probes for identification of specific ras point-mutated oncogenes or protooncogenes, may now provide the means for definitive quantitative analyses of ras p21 in human carcinomas and benign lesions.\r"

HBV DNA was detected by dot-blot hybridization in 13 of 17 cases of HCC from the Shanghai area and in three of six samples from Hangzhou. The HCC cases from Shanghai were then analyzed in more detail. Fifteen of the 17 patients had serologic evidence of past or present infection with HBV (with inadequate information available for the other two), and the 13 HCC samples positive for HBV DNA all came from serologically positive patients. Southern blot analysis showed that the HBV DNA sequences were always integrated in the HCC high-molecular-weight DNA; only one or two viral copies were present per tumor cell, and no common integration site was evident. Hybridization analyses using subgenomic probes of HBV DNA revealed that the tumors seldom retained an entire HBV genome. HBV S-region sequences were always present, X-region sequences were usually represented, and C-region sequences were rarely detectable in virus-positive tumors. A fragment within the HBV DNA X-region, between nucleotides 1441 and 1526, was found to hybridize nonspecifically with cellular DNA; reported sequence data indicated that this fragment would contain approximately 70% guanine + cytosine. Histologic sections were prepared from some of the frozen tissue specimens and stained by an indirect immunoperoxidase technique for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). Only 1 of 10 HBV DNA-positive samples contained HBsAg in the cytoplasm of tumor cells, although abundant HBsAg was present in adjacent normal cells in all 10 cases. There were no significant differences in histology between HCC that contained HBV DNA sequences and those that were virus negative. These data support the premise that HBV represents a major etiologic factor in the development of HCC in the Shanghai area of China, although the molecular basis of viral involvement remains obscure.\r"

  ".W": "The double immunohistochemical detection of estrogen receptor (ER) and the estrogen-regulated 52,000-dalton protein (52kDa-P) was performed on 35 fine needle aspirates of primary breast cancers. The nuclear ER, stained brown, was differentiated from the 52kDa-P, stained in red, in the cytoplasm of the same cells. The significant correlation obtained between the percentages of positive aspirated cells and the cytosolic concentrations of these two markers showed the validity of semiquantitative detection in fine needle aspirates, which appeared to be more representative of the content of these markers in tumors than was the detection in a single tissue section. Tumor heterogeneity also was defined by this double immunostaining, since among the tumors positive for both ER and 52kDa-P (18 of 35 cases), a heterogeneous group of 12 tumors contained the markers in two distinct cell populations, whereas a more homogeneous group of 6 tumors contained double-stained cells. The first information provided by this study is that the 52kDa-P is not correlated with the ER. This absence of correlation is in accordance with other studies and indicates that the 52kDa-P is associated with tumor proliferation and possibly invasion, rather than with hormone responsiveness or differentiation. The feasibility and validity of double immunostaining of these two markers in human breast cancer aspirates should stimulate larger studies--with clinical follow-up of the patients--aimed at establishing the clinical usefulness of this presurgical test.\r"

  ".W": "A unique subline of BALB/c mice, designated \"BALB/cV,\" exhibits an intermediate mammary tumor incidence (47%) and harbors a distinct milk-transmitted mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV). Virus expression and virus-host interactions were examined during the different stages of mammary tumorigenesis (normal, preneoplastic, and neoplastic) in the BALB/cV system. Protein immunoblot analyses established the presence of correctly processed (BALB/cV)MMTV structural proteins in all types of BALB/cV mammary tissues. Competition enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays demonstrated that cells from each biologic phenotype were capable of supporting high levels of (BALB/cV)MMTV protein expression. However, mammary epithelial cells that spontaneously underwent the inappropriate pathway of squamous metaplasia did not contain detectable levels of (BALB/cV)MMTV structural proteins. Iodination experiments revealed the presence of a 68K env-related protein on the surface of BALB/cV mammary cells. Nevertheless, sera from 40 mice bearing BALB/cV-positive mammary tissues did not contain detectable levels of anti-env antibodies. Metabolic labeling experiments showed that the half-life of transformation-related, host cell protein p53 (approximately equal to 60 min) in the distinct BALB/cV mammary cell populations was similar to that reported for normal mouse 3T3 cells. It appears that p53 is not stabilized by protein interactions involving any MMTV-encoded or MMTV-induced protein in mammary tumor cells. These characteristics of the BALB/cV system are compatible with the hypothesis that MMTV is only one of two or more cooperating factors required to mediate complete mammary transformation.\r"

Autoregulation of renal blood flow apparently remains intact, but autoregulation of the GFR is impaired during ACE inhibition. Our experience is that sodium and water retention usually ensue and plasma volume expands, leading to a temporary restoration of renal blood flow and GFR towards baseline. Serum sodium is usually reduced at this time, weight in increased, and blood pressure may be partly restored. After about 1-2 weeks, natriuresis begins, although sodium balance and weight probably are not restored to normal for 4-8 weeks. As the plasma volume contracts again, blood pressure falls further and the GFR declines. Renal blood flow, however, is maintained by preferential reduction in renovascular resistance.\r"

This nodule presents the same histological picture as the biopsy of the prostatic tumor. This is a review of 15 such cases (12 collected from the literature and an additional three unpublished cases, two of which are personal observations). At the time of needling, no metastases could be clinically detected in any of the patients; the serum acid phosphatase was normal in 73% of them. The average age of the patients was 65.66 years. The perineal nodule was tender in 40% of the cases; its average size was 2.5 cm. Excision of the nodule was the most frequently employed form of management. At the time of reporting, 60% of the patients were living and well, for an average of 18.56 months after excision. In order to prevent perineal implantation, especially in patients who are at risk, it is suggested that a fine needle be employed to obtain prostatic tissue for biopsy, and that every possible therapeutic effort be made.\r"

The PLG at death was 18.0 +/- mmol/L, and the mean K-value within 3 days after pancreatectomy was 0.4% +/- 0.2%, indicating a significant impairment of glucose disappearance from the blood when compared to the control animals (P less than 0.01). Plasma insulin levels before and after stimulation with glucose were below the lowest level of insulin assay sensitivity. We conclude that in the primate, as in the dog, surgical pancreatectomy produced a reliable diabetic model, which is uniformly lethal if left untreated.\r"
