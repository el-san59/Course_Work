Severe neuronal loss and tangle formation were evident in the anterodorsal nucleus from the AD cases. Nerve cell damage was also present in the centromedian nucleus but was not associated with tangle formation and occurred in all but 2 of the brains examined. It is likely that the anterodorsal neurons are damaged locally by the Alzheimer's disease process whereas the changes in the centromedian nucleus may be related to ageing.\r"

  ".W": "In 28 patients with definite multiple sclerosis (MS) and 21 patients with a functionally complete transection of the spinal cord sympathetic skin responses (SSR) from both the palms and soles were studied. In the patients with a complete transection at T3 or 4, SSRs were impaired in the palms as well as the soles, and most patients with a transection at T11 or T12 had normal SSRs in the soles. These findings indicate that the central pathway mediating the SSR descends to the upper thoracic cord where connections are made with the sympathetic distribution to the palms, and then to the lower thoracic cord to reach the sympathetic outflow to the soles. This is compatible with the anatomical knowledge of the sympathetic system. Of the MS patients, 75% had abnormal SSR results. The SSR for the soles was more sensitive than that for the palms. The incidence of SSR abnormality was as high as those of somatosensory evoked potential (SEP) (79%) and visual evoked potential (VEP) (75%) abnormalities. Of the patients with normal SEPs 14% had impaired SSRs and 21% had abnormal SSR with normal VEPs. When the results of these 3 tests were combined, the abnormality increased to 100%. From our study, the SSR probably reflects not only postganglionic sympathetic activity but also preganglionic function. The SSR is therefore useful in evaluating myelopathy, providing information different from that given by assessment of the somatic nervous system. Since the SSR detected a few MS lesions which were not demonstrated by other evoked potentials, it is potentially a new tool for the detection of MS lesions in addition to conventional evoked potential studies.\r"

In normal subjects, magnetic stimulation produced strong facilitation of tibialis anterior (TA) motoneurons, but little or no facilitation of soleus (SOL) motoneurons. This differential facilitation of TA and SOL motoneurons was observed at all stimulus sites on the scalp and all stimulus intensities at which responses could be elicited. In subjects with CP, magnetic stimulation produced almost equal facilitation of TA and SOL motoneurons. This could not be explained by differences in the excitability of the respective motoneuron pools. It is postulated that the projections from the motor cortex to spinal motoneurons are altered in CP. These abnormal projections may contribute to the impairment of voluntary movements experienced by these subjects.\r"

  ".W": "While a relative preservation of repetition in acute transcortical aphasia (TA) has usually been associated with the functional integrity of the speech dominant (left) perisylvian area, recent amytal data (Bando et al., 1986) have suggested a fundamental role of the nondominant (right) hemisphere in language repetition. The neuroradiological correlates of repetition were studied in a consecutive series of 21 patients with acute TA. A similar frequency of either perisylvian or extraperisylvian pathology was found. In 2 patients with perisylvian pathology, the injection of amytal in the hemisphere contralateral to the lesion abolished repetition. Positron emission tomography (PET) in another patient revealed marked hypometabolism over the entire left cortical mantle ipsilateral to a basal ganglia lesion, suggesting that preserved repetition was carried out by right hemisphere structures. This was confirmed in a second patient with left extraperisylvian pathology, in whom a second lesion in the right hemisphere resulted in impaired repetition. These findings suggest that the spared contralateral hemisphere may subserve residual repetition in some transcortical aphasic patients with a lesion within or outside the speech-dominant perisylvian area.\r"

  ".W": "In rats with unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine substantia nigra lesions, the effects of selective D1 and D2 dopamine receptor antagonists on L-DOPA-induced rotation and regional cerebral glucose utilization (RCGU) changes were examined. Contralateral rotation induced by L-DOPA (25 mg/kg) was effectively blocked by D1 (SCH 23390, 1.0 mg/kg) and D2 (eticlopride, 2.0 mg/kg) antagonists, in combination, but not by either antagonist alone. This suggests that in the dopamine-depleted rat, L-DOPA administration results in the stimulation of both D1 and D2 receptor systems, each capable of independently eliciting a full motor response, L-DOPA altered RCGU in the following brain regions ipsilateral to the lesion: entopeduncular nucleus (EP, + 105%), substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr, + 121%), subthalamic nucleus (STN, + 32%), deep layers of the superior colliculus (DLSC, + 35%), and lateral habenula nucleus (LHN, -52%). The effects in the EP and SNr were blocked completely by D1 antagonist pretreatment but only partially attenuated by D2 antagonist pretreatment, indicating the critical dependence of these changes on D1 stimulation. In contrast, combined D1 and D2 antagonist pretreatment, but neither drug alone, blocked the L-DOPA-induced increases in the STN and DLSC. The effects of L-DOPA in the LHN were attenuated by either SCH 23390 or eticlopride, and blocked completely by the antagonist combination. These results provide evidence that dopamine formed following the decarboxylation of L-DOPA stimulates both D1 and D2 receptors in vivo and that stimulation of each receptor contributes uniquely to its physiological effects. Neural mechanisms of action of L-DOPA are discussed in the context of these findings.\r"

Speed of reaction (as defined by the reciprocal of reaction time (RT), movement time (MT) and total response time (TRT] and accuracy of response (as represented by the sum of errors in selecting the correct response key) were investigated comparatively as a function of side of lesion and of performance on Raven's Coloured Progressive Matrices (PM47). In contrast to movement speed (1/MT), reaction speed (1/RT) as well as total response speed (1/TRT) showed a lesion effect independent of side of damage. Conversely, accuracy was differentially impaired, LH damage being associated with a significantly higher number of errors. Speed and accuracy had different relationships with the performance on the PM47 in the two hemisphere groups. Speed was affected in parallel with changes in PM47 performance both in the LH and in RH groups, whereas accuracy was altered only in LH patients. It was concluded that speed of motor reaction is affected by unilateral brain lesions irrespective of their side, whereas decision making processes, as expressed by accuracy of response, seem to be specifically impaired by LH damage.\r"

To study this control, saccades made towards suddenly appearing visual targets (saccade task) or away from them (antisaccade task) were recorded electro-oculographically in 45 patients with limited unilateral cerebral infarction. Lesions affected (1) the superior part of the angular gyrus (area 39 of Brodmann) in the posterior parietal cortex (PPC), (2) the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) (area 46 of Brodmann), (3) the frontal eye field (FEF), or (4) the supplementary motor area (SMA). As these 4 types of lesions were located either in the right or the left cerebral hemisphere, patients were divided into 8 groups. Saccade latency, in the saccade task, and the percentage of errors (misdirected saccades made towards the visual target), in the antisaccade task, were compared in each group of patients with the values of 20 control subjects. In the saccade task, saccade latency was significantly increased bilaterally in the right PPC group. In the left PPC group, the increase in latency was less marked, and significant only for saccades made contralaterally to the lesion. In the different frontal groups, latency was unchanged or only slightly increased. These results confirm that the main area facilitating the triggering of reflexive visually-guided saccades is located in the PPC, in or near the superior part of the angular gyrus. The difference between right and left parietal lesions could be due to the predominance of the right hemisphere in the control of these saccades. In the antisaccade task, the percentage of errors was significantly increased bilaterally in both PFC groups compared with the control group and also to the FEF and SMA groups. These results suggest that the PFC is the main area in the cerebral hemisphere inhibiting reflexive visually-guided saccades.\r"

Sensitivity measured in the blind field was compared with that at matched positions in the patients' normal hemifield, and with that at corresponding positions in 2 control subjects. Results show that spectral sensitivity in the blind field, albeit reduced by up to 1 log unit, shows normal dependence on adaptation level, reflecting rod activity under scotopic, and cone activity under photopic conditions. Characteristic discontinuities in the spectral sensitivity curve seen under light adaptation are evidence for colour-opponent processes, presumably involving primate beta retinal ganglion cells.\r"

Ovarian abnormalities were detected in 33 women (2.5%), and 27 underwent exploratory laparotomy. Ovarian tumors were noted in all 27 patients, including 2 primary carcinomas and 14 serous cystadenomas. The two women with ovarian carcinomas had normal results of pelvic examinations and normal serum CA-125 levels. Both women had Stage I disease, and are alive and well after conventional therapy. TVS was time efficient, easy to perform, and well-accepted by patients. Currently, there are more than 3000 patient years of follow-up in the screened population, and there have been no deaths due to ovarian cancer. A multi-institutional trial to determine the efficacy of TVS as a screening method for ovarian cancer is indicated.\r"

Sarcomas have been associated with prior radiation therapy, toxic exposures, and genetic conditions and soft tissue sarcomas have been distinguished from bone sarcomas. For localized soft tissue sarcoma, tumor grade is the most important prognostic variable. Low-grade tumors are generally cured by wide surgical excision, but there is a significant rate of both local recurrence and development of distant metastasis in high-grade lesions. The treatment of soft tissue sarcoma histologic subtypes is generally similar grade-for-grade, with the exception of rhabomyosarcoma, Kaposi's sarcoma, and mesothelioma. Tumor location strongly influences resectability. Radiation therapy has been used successfully in conjunction with conservative surgery to improve local control rates for soft tissue sarcomas, particularly in extremity lesions. Currently, adjuvant chemotherapy remains unproven for most adult soft tissue sarcomas, but is established in the treatment of rhabdomyosarcomas, osteosarcomas, and Ewing's sarcomas.\r"

Local fields were treated with fraction sizes of 117 cGy given twice daily, with a minimum interfraction interval of 6 hours, to a total dose of 7020 cGy in 60 fractions over 6 weeks. Information regarding clinical status during HRT was available for 55 patients (44 [80%] improved, 6 remained stable, and 5 deteriorated). Results of initial and follow-up computed tomography (CT) scan and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were available for review for 52 patients. One patient had a complete response (CR) to treatment, 3 had a partial response (PR) (more than 50% response), and 40 remained stable, for a total response rate (CR + PR + stable) of 77%. Median time to disease progression was 6 months. Median survival time was 10 months. Survival rate was 39.6% (standard error [SE] = 6.6%) at 1 year and 23% (SE = 5.8%) at 2 years. Complications of treatment included an enhanced skin reaction in six patients and otitis media and/or externa in nine. One patient bled into tumor shortly after completion of HRT, and three had intralesional necrosis. Five patients continued taking steroids for protracted periods in the face of improved clinical and/or radiologic findings. Complications related to the use of steroids included opportunistic infections, impaired glucose tolerance, hypertension, osteoporosis, and significant mood changes. In no patient was there evidence of any late injury attributable to HRT. When compared with results of treatment with HRT at a lower dose level (6600 cGy), there appears to be a trend toward improved survival at 7020 cGy despite a less favorable patient population at the higher dose level. A second dose escalation to 7560 cGy in 60 fractions over 6 weeks has been implemented as planned.\r"

NK activity in untreated Stage I patients with no evidence of disease (ned) was significantly higher than in healthy controls. NK activity was shown to decline in individuals with cytotoxic drug therapy (P equals 0.036). There also were reduction in lymphocyte recoveries concomitant with chemotherapeutic intervention (P less than 0.001). Lymphocyte counts were incorporated in a calculation of absolute NK activity that more accurately reflected the significant reduction in NK activity that occurred in patients with localized and systemic disease on chemotherapy. Different chemotherapeutic agents were found to selectively affect NK activity. Stage II patients on phenylalanine mustard (P)/5-fluorouracil (F) (PF) and cyclophosphamide (C)/methotrexate (M)/5-fluorouracil (F) (CMF) protocols showed significant reductions in overall NK activity relative to healthy controls and Stage I patients with ned. Patients on P/doxorubicin (A)/F/tamoxifen (Tx) (PAFT) protocols showed reduced NK activity relative to Stage I patients. Patients on the short-dose C/A (CA) protocol showed normal levels of overall NK activity. High-risk Stage I patients on methotrexate (M)/F (MF)with sequential leucovorin rescue and patients with metastatic disease on endocrine therapy, i.e., Tx or megestrol acetate (Meg) showed overall NK activities in the range of healthy controls. Patients with systemic disease on CMF, CMF/vincristine/prednisone (CMFVP), vinblastine/A/thiotepa/fluoxymesterone (VATH), mitomycin/mitoxantrone (MtMx), and A regimens showed overall levels of absolute NK that were significantly less than either healthy controls or metastatic patients undergoing endocrine therapy. NK cytolytic data, monitored at multiple effector to target ratios, were subjected to exponential regression analysis. The elevation of NK cell responses in Stage I patients with ned and the decline of NK cell responses with cytotoxic chemotherapy were due to alterations in the maximal plateau levels of NK cell cytotoxicity represented by the A (asymptote) values. The k values obtained on regression analysis and indices of the relative killing capacities of individual NK cells remained unaltered in all populations. These results suggest that the cytolytic lymphocyte NK pool, elevated in Stage I patients with cancer, selectively declines as a result of cytotoxic therapy.\r"

Living status and disease-free survival (DFS) time were assessed for all patients on January 1, 1988. By multi-variate analyses, lymph node involvement (P = 0.0003) and tumor invasiveness (P = 0.007) were identified as the most significant covariates correlated with survival. A model including N stage (P = 0.001) and age (P = 0.03) was selected for predicting DFS rates. Children between 5 and 10 years of age had better DFS rates than those younger than 5 years of age or those older than 10 years of age. The authors suggest a prognostic classification that could allow treatment to be adjusted according to clinical staging.\r"

The study population included the affected patient (proband), nine of her blood relatives, and seven healthy volunteers. The activity of dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD), the initial enzyme of pyrimidine (and FUra) catabolism, in peripheral blood mononuclear cells was measured in each subject by a specific radiometric assay using FUra as the substrate. The proband had no detectable DPD activity. When enzyme levels in the proband and relatives were compared with that in controls, an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance was demonstrated. This is the third patient with severe FUra toxicity secondary to an alteration in pyrimidine catabolism and the second from our clinic population suggesting that the frequency of this genetic defect may be greater than previously thought. Monitoring DPD activity may be important in the management of patients experiencing severe toxicity secondary to FUra chemotherapy.\r"

The patient with rheumatoid arthritis received 5251 cGy at 210 cGy per day, followed by a 1600 cGy iridium-192 implant boost. Between 8 and 11 months post-RT she had severe breast fibrosis, retraction, and pain that required a mastectomy for relief. The patient with scleroderma received 5040 cGy at 180 cGy per day without a boost. Between 1 and 4 months post-RT the systemic symptoms of scleroderma progressed and the breast became hard and retracted. Both rheumatoid arthritis and scleroderma are chronic systemic diseases characterized by severe inflammation and an autoimmune component. The presence of scleroderma at or before treatment should be considered a contraindication to breast RT, whereas the presence of active rheumatoid arthritis should be considered a relative contraindication. An autoimmune mechanism will be presented to explain both the fibrosis and the systemic progression of collagen vascular disease that was observed.\r"

  ".W": "Since 1973, the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) has staged and stratified patients in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) protocols according to the RTOG staging system. In 1985, the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) revised its lung cancer staging system, with the principle differences from the RTOG system being the staging of involvement of the chest wall and of contralateral mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes. To determine if the AJCC system discriminated outcome differently than the RTOG system in a nonoperative series, all 850 evaluable patients treated with hyperfractionated radiation therapy (RT) on the RTOG protocol 83-11 were restaged by the AJCC system. There was 67% agreement in patient distribution between the following comparable stages in each system: RTOG Stage II/AJCC Stage II; RTOG Stage III/AJCC Stage IIIA; and RTOG Stage IV/AJCC Stage IIIB. Both systems successfully predicted for survival (P less than 0.001), although the RTOG staging was more discriminating (relative risk ratios, 1.59 versus 1.38). Among the 507 favorable patients (those with less than or equal to 5% weight loss and Karnofsky performance status [KPS] of 70 to 100), the RTOG staging was also more predictive (P = 0.004 versus P = 0.01). When RTOG Stage III (462 patients) was divided into those without contralateral mediastinal or hilar adenopathy (AJCC Stage II/IIIA) and those with (AJCC Stage IIIB), a significant survival (P = 0.0001) was noted with 2-year survival rates of 26% versus 4%, respectively. When AJCC Stage IIIA (348 patients) was divided into the patients without chest wall invasion (RTOG Stage II/III) and those with (RTOG Stage IV), a difference in 2-year survival of 22% versus 10% was observed (P = 0.002). Although both staging systems independently predict for survival, a fusion of both staging systems is the most discriminating of outcome. Future nonoperative studies in locally advanced NSCLC should stratify for contralateral nodal involvement (per AJCC staging) and chest wall invasion (per RTOG staging).\r"

No morphologic changes were observed up to doses of 540 cGy. A few intact cancer cells remained up to doses of 2700 cGy. Moderate changes in the cancer cells were noticed in patients who received 900 cGy or more, i.e., multinuclei, swollen nuclei and cytoplasms, and prominent large nucleoli. At doses of 1800 cGy or greater, many cancer nests had severely damaged cancer cells with features such as cytolysis, karyolysis, karyorrhexis, pyknosis, and bizarre giant cells. There was no mitosis in the cells of patients who received doses greater than 1800 cGy. The Ki-67-positive cancer cells showed diffuse nuclear-stainings and dot-stainings before radiation therapy. Radiation doses more than 900 cGy changed the staining pattern of the Ki-67 antibody; large irregular spot-stainings and ring-stainings were observed predominantly. The Ki-67 index initially increased with the radiation dose; the mean Ki-67 indices before radiation therapy and at radiation doses of 180 cGy, 540 cGy, and 900 cGy were 41%, 50%, 63%, and 68%, respectively. The indices decreased when the dose was increased further, and they were 39% and 20% at doses of 1800 cGy and 2700 cGy, respectively. Possible explanations, including recruitment of quiescent cells, for the change in Ki-67 staining are discussed.\r"

The most frequent first primary tumors were cancers of the breast (seven cases) and female reproductive organs (13 cases). Five patients had a childhood cancer. The median total radiation dose at the site of the PIS was 3600 cGy (1600 cGy to 11200 cGy). The median interval from start of radiation therapy to detection of PIS was 13.2 years (3.4 to 22.8 years). The PIS was of soft tissue origin in 25 of 33 cases. The most frequent histologic types were osteosarcoma (ten cases, including four extraskeletal tumors), malignant fibrous histiocytoma (ten cases), and fibrosarcoma (six cases). The overall crude 5-year survival rate was 29% (calculated from the start of treatment for PIS), and for patients initially treated with either radical surgery or combined marginal surgery and postoperative irradiation it was 67%. The authors conclude that there is a chance for cure for radically treated patients with postirradiation sarcoma that emphasizes the importance of regular long-term follow-up of cancer patients.\r"

Microscopic study was used to determine the percentage of positive cells and the staining index. The percentage of EGFR-positive cells and the EGFR staining index were higher in the ER-negative primary tumors than ER-positive primary tumors. In ER-positive cases, both the number of ER-positive cells and ER content per cell was less in the involved nodes than in the primary tumors, whereas the number of EGFR-positive cells and EGFR content per cell was greater in affected nodes. On the other hand, in the ER-negative cases the number of EGFR-positive cells and EGFR content per cell remain almost unchanged between the primary tumors and involved nodes.

It is unrelated to the histologic type of the tumor but usually reflects its aggressiveness and prognostic outlook. Its pathogenesis is controversial. The presence of eosinophil colony-stimulating factor(s) in serum and malignant tissue extracts was evaluated in two cases of malignancies accompanied by marked blood and bone marrow eosinophilia. When compared with controls, serum and tumor tissue extracts stimulated the growth of G, M, and Eo colonies in semisolid cultures of human bone marrow. Such stimulating effect was inhibited by the addition of antibodies to granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and interleukin-3. Thus, the colony-stimulating factor(s) play a role in the pathogenesis of the eosinophilia associated with some malignant tumors, and these factors appear to include GM-CSF, interleukin-3, and probably others.\r"

  ".U": "91292405\r", 
  ".W": "Prognostic predictors for node-negative breast carcinoma have not been clearly established. Immunostaining with Ki-67 antibody was performed on frozen sections of histologically proved node-negative breast carcinomas from 42 patients to examine its prognostic value and its association with other clinicopathologic and biochemical parameters, i.e., patient age and tumor size, histologic type, nuclear grade, mitotic rate, presence of vascular or lymphatic invasion, DNA ploidy, percentage of cells in S-phase, estrogen content, and c-erbB-2 amplification. Thirty-seven of the 42 tumors showed immunoreactivity with Ki-67 antibody in 1% to 55% of the tumor cells. A strongly significant correlation was observed between Ki-67 staining percentage and, respectively, nuclear grade, age, and mitotic rate. Nuclear grade 1 (the most anaplastic) tumors showed a significantly higher median percentage of cells stained (median, 14; range, 3 to 40) compared with nuclear grade 3 tumors (median, 0.5; range, 0 to 8). Thirteen patients developed recurrence; six of them died of disease. On univariate analysis, both 5-year disease-free and overall survivals were strongly associated with percentage of cells stained with Ki-67 antibody. Our results suggest that Ki-67 immunostaining correlates well with nuclear grade and clinical outcome in node-negative breast carcinoma. Because of small sample size analyzed in this study we were unable to do multivariate analysis. Therefore, further studies with larger number of cases are needed to determine whether tumor proliferative activity determined by Ki-67 immunostaining is an independent prognostic parameter or it merely reflects histopathologic features such as nuclear grade or mitotic activity.\r"

Both mitomycin and to a lesser extent cisplatin were effective as single agents against the nude mouse xenografts, and the combination of these two drugs produced a complete response both in the patient and in the xenografts. The patient survived 18 months from onset of chemotherapy and 24 months from diagnosis. The duration of clinical complete response to chemotherapy was 14 months, despite the fact that mitomycin, the most effective agent against the xenografts, was discontinued after only two cycles because the patient developed pulmonary toxicity. This direct patient-xenograft correlation further validates the usefulness of the nude mouse model in the search for effective therapies for malignant mesothelioma, a tumor characterized by frequent refractoriness to most available agents.\r"

This group included 509 patients with malignant disease (134 breast cancer patients and 375 patients with other malignancies not involving the breast) and 833 patients with benign surgical diseases (95 patients with fibroadenoma of the breast and 738 patients with other benign diseases). The results were compared with those obtained for carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) in the diagnosis of breast cancer. The CA 15-3 level was above normal (25 U/ml) in 31% of the patients with breast cancer, in 22% of patients with other malignancies, and in 9% of patients with benign diseases. The CEA level was elevated in 26% of patients with breast cancer (more than 3 ng/ml). There was a good correlation of CA 15-3 levels with the tumor stage of breast cancer. Both CA 15-3 and CEA also were determined in 671 patients who had received initial curative surgery of breast cancer and who regularly attended our follow-up clinic. The CA 15-3 was found to be more sensitive than CEA in detecting recurrences of breast cancer. In the postcare period, carcinoma recurred in 205 patients. Of these, 73% had CA 15-3 concentrations above 25 U/ml; only 50% had CEA values above 3 ng/ml (P less than 0.0001). Although neither CA 15-3 nor CEA were sensitive enough for the screening and diagnosis of early breast cancer, CA 15-3 was significantly better than CEA in the detection of breast cancer metastases.\r"

  ".W": "Fifty esophagectomies (32 specimens with squamous cell carcinoma and 18 with adenocarcinoma) were reviewed for the presence of Barrett's mucosa. The whole resected specimens were cut, and a total of 1677 blocks (measuring up to 4.0 x 0.5 cm) were obtained. In resections with squamous cell carcinoma, a mean of 33.6 sections (range, 16 to 55 sections) were excised, and in those with adenocarcinomas, a mean of 33.4 sections (range, ten to 60 sections) were cut. Barrett's mucosa (without or with dysplasia) was present in all 18 specimens with an adenocarcinoma (100%) and in 13 of the 32 specimens (40.6%) with squamous cell carcinoma. In ten of the 13 specimens with squamous cell carcinoma, adjacent areas with high-grade squamous cell dysplasia were found. The squamous cell carcinoma and/or the adjacent squamous cell dysplasia were found separated from the Barrett's mucosa by normal squamous epithelium, supporting the view that these two lesions are not related to one another. Early clinical and experimental data showed that squamous cell dysplasia antedated the development of squamous cell carcinoma in that organ. One possible suggestive of these findings is that the detection of a Barrett's esophagus (without or with dysplasia) should prompt the endoscopist also to examine carefully the rest of the esophagus to exclude mucosal alterations possibly connected with squamous cell carcinogenesis in that organ.\r"

Almost all histochemically demonstrable activity is located in the epithelium. Enzymatic activities in extracts and in histochemical preparations showed similar differences between carcinoma and benign prostatic hyperplasia and were related (R = -0.38, P = 0.0400) to Gleason's grades. The transurethrally resected prostate cancers studied contained no well-differentiated tumors and a high proportion of poorly differentiated tumors. Histochemical activity is absent in most prostatic carcinomas and decreased in others. This observation is particularly interesting in view of the growing knowledge of tumor suppressor genes.\r"

The results of surveillance cultures (throat, rectal, and urine) and blood cultures were analyzed to identify cases of Candida tropicalis and C. albicans colonization and/or fungemia. None of the patients with lymphoma who had positive surveillance cultures for C. albicans (n = 89) or C. tropicalis (n = 23) had fungemia. Among patients with leukemia, significant fungal infection was documented in 12 of 107 colonized with C. tropicalis (11.2%) versus 14 of 700 (2%) colonized with C. albicans (P less than 0.001). The two groups of children with fungemia were similar in primary diagnoses (predominantly acute lymphoblastic leukemia) and in the frequency of several known risk factors for infection, including the duration of neutropenia (absolute neutrophil counts, less than 500/microliters). Patients with C. tropicalis fungemia all had disseminated disease compared with nine of 14 patients with C. albicans fungemia. Also, subcutaneous abscesses were unique to patients with C. tropicalis in this series. Two patients in each group died of their infection; central nervous system involvement was present in both fatal cases of C. tropicalis fungemia. A high index of suspicion and the early institution of appropriate antifungal therapy are critical to the successful management of these infections in patients with leukemia.\r"

Ten patients (4.4%) had hypercalcemia, 11 patients (4.9%) had leukocytosis, and five (2.2%) had both hypercalcemia and leukocytosis. The occurrence of these two distinct paraneoplastic syndromes in the same patients was greater than could have been expected from chance alone (chi-square = 45.8, P less than 0.0001). This study demonstrates that although hypercalcemia and leukocytosis are relatively uncommon in oral cancers, when they do occur they are frequently associated. To the knowledge of the authors, this is the first report in which the frequency of the association hypercalcemia and leukocytosis is studied in detail in large numbers of patients with oral cancer.\r"

The prevalence of this lesion is not appreciated because of the dominant clinical picture of metastases occurring in other organs. The diagnosis should be suspected in any women with a history of breast cancer and any visual symptoms, particularly metamorphopsia and scotomata. A thorough ophthalmologic evaluation, aided by ultrasonography, computed tomography, or magnetic resonance scanning, usually confirms the diagnosis. Early treatment with radiation therapy can alleviate symptoms and control local disease. The recognition and treatment of this disorder is important in maximizing the quality of life in patients with metastatic breast cancer, especially because newer treatment regimens prolong survival and thereby increase the chances for ocular metastasis.\r"

  ".U": "91292418\r", 
  ".W": "A retrospective analysis was undertaken to assess the prognostic role of histologic findings in response to chemotherapy and survival in patients with metastatic breast cancer. Histologic material was available for 395 of 1587 patients treated for metastatic breast cancer at the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center between 1973 and 1984. Chemotherapy consisted of 5-fluorouracil, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide or similar drugs, with or without tamoxifen. Maintenance cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and 5-fluorouracil was continued for 2 years after a cumulative doxorubicin dose of 450 mg/m2 was administered. The histologic distribution was as follows: infiltrating ductal carcinoma, 353; invasive lobular, 14; mixed histology, ten; mucinous, seven; signet ring, four; tubular, three; papillary, two; sarcomatoid, one; and apocrine, one. Because individual histologic types occurred infrequently, the patients were divided into infiltrating ductal and nonductal groups. Baseline patient characteristics included age, performance status, estrogen-receptor status, prior hormone response, disease extent, and levels of alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin, and lactate dehydrogenase. These were similar in the two groups. Significantly more patients with nonductal histology had greater than three metastatic sites. There were also more patients with hemoglobin less than 10 mg/dl and albumin less than 3.5 mg/dl in the nonductal group of patients. However, statistically these factors did not have an impact on the results. There was a 63% response rate (17% complete and 46% partial) for the ductal group and a 60% response rate (12% complete and 48% partial) for the nonductal group. The time from initiation of chemotherapy to disease progression was identical (12 months) for the two groups. Survival from initiation of chemotherapy was not significantly different (22 months for ductal and 27 months for nonductal). Based on this study, the authors conclude that histologic findings have no bearing on patient response to chemotherapy or survival in metastatic breast cancer.\r"

Group A had a significantly higher visceral metastases-free rate than Groups B or C. Serial bone scans and radiographs of Group A patients revealed that bone lesions cranial to the junction rarely developed into visceral metastases and that bone lesions extending caudal to the junction frequently developed into visceral metastases. These results indicate that the presence of bone metastases caudal to the lumbosacral junction is predictive of visceral metastases.\r"

The ploidy of lymph node and liver metastases was compared with that of the superficial and deep specimen from the corresponding primary tumor. Among the tumors studied, 78% exhibited nondiploid stemlines. In 19% of the tumors, the ploidy of the superficial biopsy differed from that of the deep biopsy. Among these discordant tumors, all of the deep biopsy specimens corresponded in ploidy to the liver metastases, whereas most of the superficial specimens were similar in ploidy to the lymph node metastases. Our observations suggest that measurement of a single site may not be sufficient to detect nondiploid stemlines within a tumor. They also suggest that measurement of deeper parts of invasive tumors may be more reflective of the phenotype of distant metastases than measurement of superficial specimens.\r"

  ".W": "The syndrome of humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy (HHM) is thought to be mainly a result of the production of parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHRP) by malignant tumors. Serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25-DHD) concentrations are generally low in such patients, which contrasts with the findings in animal studies. A patient is reported with HHM from a clear cell ovarian carcinoma and elevated serum immunoreactive PTHRP (about five times the upper limit of normal) in whom serum 1,25-DHD concentrations were abnormally high (200 pmol/l) and associated with increased intestinal calcium absorption. Treatment with two different nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates (pamidronate and [3-dimethyl-amino-1-hydroxypropylidene]-1,1-bisphosphonate) did not normalize serum and urinary calcium despite effective inhibition of bone resorption. These observations suggested an additional intestinal contribution to the maintenance of hypercalcemia. Tumor removal was followed by decreases in serum immunoreactive PTHRP and 1,25-DHD concentrations to their respective normal ranges and normocalcemia. Separating HHM into Types I and II, according to the prevailing serum 1,25-DHD concentrations, can provide a basis for a better understanding of the pathogenesis of hypercalcemia, and it also may have practical use in the successful management of these patients.\r"

  ".W": "This study tests whether malignant melanoma (MM) patients are at higher risk of having an unrelated second cancer by comparing the observed incidence of a second cancer in a given population of MM patients with the expected number in an age-matched and sex-matched group of healthy people followed for a similar period. The analysis was based on the person-years method in which the main consideration is the follow-up period after the diagnosis of MM. Of 370 patients with histologically confirmed MM, 27 (7.3%) had a second noncutaneous invasive cancer, diagnosed either simultaneously (within 6 months, five patients) or after the diagnosis of MM (22 patients). The follow-up period for the entire MM group was 1253 person-years, a period during which the expected number of cancer cases in the normal population, according to the Israel Cancer Registry, was 6.6. The observed-expected ratio or the relative risk (RR) was 4.1 (P less than 0.01). After excluding the five patients with simultaneous diagnosis of MM and a second cancer, analysis of the remaining 22 patients in whom MM definitely preceded the second cancer showed an RR of 3.3 (P less than 0.01). For the entire group, there were nine patients with breast cancer, five with head and neck cancer (two with thyroid and three with oral cavity cancer), five with gynecologic cancer (one with uterine and four with ovarian cancer), five myeloproliferative malignancies (one with lymphoma, three with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and one with myeloma), three gastrointestinal carcinomas (two with colon and one with stomach cancer), and two soft tissue sarcomas. When the differential analysis according to gender and age was done, it was found that the RR was higher for women (5.5, P less than 0.01) than for men where the RR was 2.2 (P less than 0.05). Differential analysis for various age groups showed that the trend for second cancer was consistent in all age groups, with a slight increase in the younger ones. None of the variables of MM, such as location of the primary tumor, level of invasion, or stage, were predictive for a second cancer. Furthermore, the RR for a second cancer did not relate significantly with the treatment given to the MM patient. Concerning the type of second cancer, it was found that the RR was especially high for breast cancer--6.6. These data indicate that MM patients may be at higher risk for having a noncutaneous invasive cancer compared with the general population.\r"

Inclusion of all registered Seventh-Day Adventists regardless of religious activity and the relatively low cancer incidence rates in the Norwegian population could contribute to the nonsignificant result with regard to total cancer.

After 20 years of follow-up, 50% to 90% increases in mortality from stomach cancer (75 deaths) were found among foreign-born, their children, and among residents of the North Central states. An association was seen with low educational attainment and laboring or semiskilled occupations, primarily among immigrants and their children. Risk was evaluated in subjects who regularly smoked cigarettes (RR = 2.6, 95% CI = 1.1 to 5.8). A significant dose-response trend was observed, with subjects who smoked 30 or more cigarettes per day having more than a five-fold increased risk compared with those who never smoked. Elevated risks were also found for pipe smoking and smokeless tobacco use, but not for alcohol consumption. Analysis of dietary consumption of nine food groups revealed no significant associations with stomach cancer. However, total carbohydrate intake and a few individual food items (salted fish, bacon, cooked cereal, milk, and apples) were associated with increased risk. The findings of this prospective study of a high-risk population add to the limited evidence relating tobacco consumption to stomach cancer risk and suggest clues to ethnic, geographic, and dietary risk factors.\r"

We studied 199 healthy, elective surgical inpatients aged 18-70 yr to determine whether there was any correlation between the ingestion interval or the volume of fluid ingested, with the volume and pH of residual gastric fluid at induction of anaesthesia. Pregnant patients, and those with gastric disorders or who were taking medications that affect gastric motility or secretion, were excluded. Either no premedication was given, or oral diazepam 5-15 mg was given 90 min preoperatively. Of the 199 patients, 105 ingested 50-1200 ml on the morning of surgery. The ingestion-induction interval was less than three hours in 12 patients whose actual surgery time was ahead of schedule. The remaining 94 patients did not drink because they were scheduled for surgery before 11:00 (n = 51), they did not want to drink (n = 24), or they were advised not to drink by their nurse or surgeon (n = 16). Following induction of anaesthesia, gastric fluid was aspirated through a #18 Salem sump orogastric tube, the volume was recorded and pH was measured with a calibrated pH meter. Patients were divided retrospectively into four groups (in three of which patients ingested fluid) according to the ingestion-induction interval (1.3-3.0 hr, 3.1-5.0 hr, 5.1-8.0 hr, and nothing by mouth after midnight).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of a new non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent, Org 9426, were investigated. Ten patients undergoing elective head and neck surgery and anaesthetized with nitrous oxide, halothane and fentanyl, received a bolus dose of Org 9426 (1 mg.kg-1, 3 x ED90). The isometric contractions of the adductor pollicis muscle following ulnar nerve stimulation (0.1 Hz and intermittent TOF) were measured. Blood and urine were sampled over 8 and 24 hr, respectively. Concentrations of Org 9426 and its possible metabolites in plasma and urine were determined using HPLC. Pharmacokinetic variables were calculated by iterative linear least square regression analysis. Intubation conditions were excellent one minute after administration at a neuromuscular block of 88 (13)% (Mean (CV]. Onset time until maximum block, duration until 25% recovery of twitch height, and recovery from 25 until 75% of twitch height were 1.7 (32), 53 (19) and 20 (37) min, respectively. The TOF reached a ratio of 0.7 after 87 (19) min. Half lives were 1.8 (33), 19 (34), 131 (62) min, respectively, in a three exponential decay; distribution volume at steady-state and plasma clearance were 0.264 (56) L.kg-1 and 4.0 (21) ml.kg-1.min-1, respectively. Plasma concentration at 25% recovery of the twitch height was 1.0 mg.L-1. Within 24 h, 33 (37)% of Org 9426 was excreted unchanged in the urine. Metabolites were absent both in plasma and urine. We conclude that the difference in potency between Org 9426 and vecuronium is similar to the difference between their effective concentrations.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Since the pharmacodynamic aspects of alfentanil have not been well documented in children, this study was undertaken to evaluate the safety, efficacy, and dose requirements of alfentanil when used with nitrous oxide or halothane in paediatric patients. Eighty unpremedicated patients, ASA physical status I or II and aged 2-12 yr were studied. Patients were randomly assigned to one of four groups. After induction of anaesthesia with nitrous oxide, oxygen, and halothane, the groups were treated as follows. In Group 1 (n = 19), after halothane was discontinued, alfentanil 50 micrograms.kg-1 was infused over 30 sec. In Group 2 (n = 20), the end-tidal halothan was maintained at 0.5% and alfentanil 25 micrograms.kg-1 was infused. In Group 3 (n = 20), the end-tidal halothane concentration was maintained at 1% and alfentanil 12.5 micrograms.kg-1 was infused. In Group 4 (n = 21), the end-tidal halothane concentration was maintained at 1.5% and no alfentanil was administered. Patients in Groups 1, 2, and 3 received bolus doses of alfentanil 12.5 micrograms.kg-1 as needed to maintain haemodynamic stability. After alfentanil administration, there were transient decreases in systolic blood pressure in Groups 1 and 2, and in heart rate in Group 2. With surgical stimulation, haemodynamic stability was well maintained except in patients in Group 1, who had an increase in systolic blood pressure. Children Group 1 were alert sooner and their tracheas were extubated earlier than those in Groups 2, 3, and 4.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Following delivery of the infant, under epidural anaesthesia with lidocaine 2% with 1/200,000 epinephrine, patients were randomly assigned to receive either 10 ml of preservative-free normal saline via the epidural catheter or 100 micrograms of fentanyl with 8 ml preservative-free normal saline in a double-blinded fashion. On arrival in the post-anesthesia recovery room (PAR), patients were provided with intravenous PCA meperidine 12.5 mg every eight minutes as needed. Patients were visited at intervals over the next 24 hr to determine if any differences in narcotic requirements, demands for narcotics, or severity of pain were noted. No differences were observed in any values between the groups. It is concluded that a single bolus of epidural fentanyl does not provide an advantage for postoperative pain relief in this patient population.\r"

The objectives of this article are to review (1) the effects of subarachnoid haemorrhage and vasospasm on cerebral blood flow (CBF); (2) the effects of induced hypotension and hypocapnia on CBF in these patients; (3) current therapy for cerebral ischaemia from vasospasm. The medical literature was searched using Index Medicus; for the period 1983-90 this search was done on a computer with the CD-ROM version of Index Medicus, Silver Platter. Papers were selected on the basis of validity and applicability to clinical practice; animal studies are included when human data is lacking. Cerebral vasospasm may decrease cerebral blood flow, disturb autoregulation and place the patient at risk for delayed cerebral ischaemia. Intraoperative induced hypotension and hypocapnia can decrease CBF further, although effects of either on outcome have not been evaluated. Calcium antagonists are effective for both the prevention and the treatment of delayed cerebral ischaemia. Of the mechanical treatments, systemic-arterial hypertension has the firmest scientific foundation, although this is frequently combined with haemodilution and blood volume expansion. There is a need for randomized clinical trials to assess the efficacy of these latter treatments.\r"

Prophylactic carotid endarterectomy for patients with asymptomatic carotid disease before cardiac surgery is not necessary. Symptomatic carotid disease increases the risk of stroke, and the management of patients who have both symptomatic coronary and carotid artery diseases is discussed. Cardiogenic embolism is probably responsible for many perioperative strokes. Patients with atrial fibrillation, valvular disease, and prosthetic heart valves are at high risk of cardiogenic embolism.

The trachea was reintubated but she became hypoxic, PaO2-36 mmHg, produced pink frothy secretions and the x-ray was typical of pulmonary oedema. The oedema cleared within 24 hr. Tracheostomy was performed one week later as the cords were still fixed, but the latter had recovered by three months and the tracheostomy was closed. The cause of the cord paralysis is unknown but probably was a result of surgical trauma to the brain stem.\r"

A 34-year-old pregnant patient presented at 18 weeks amenorrhoea with a large ovarian cyst. She gave a history of exertional dyspnoea and orthopnoea. Clinical examination revealed a grossly enlarged abdomen and a respiratory rate of 28 breaths.min-1. Intraoperatively, ventilation was markedly impaired resulting in cyanosis and bradycardia. This was relieved by drainage of the ovarian cyst. A left lateral tilt with manual traction on the tumour may have avoided this problem. Should the above measures be inadequate, immediate drainage of the cyst is essential. Severe respiratory distress may require ultrasound-guided, percutaneous, aspiration of the cyst preoperatively. However, as in this patient, the absence of gross signs of respiratory failure does not preclude acute ventilatory failure after induction of anaesthesia.\r"

Of these, 208 had blunt thoracic injuries while 125 did not have chest injuries. Both groups were similar with respect to age but patients with thoracic trauma had a greater ISS. (P less than 0.05) and greater intraoperative mortality (P less than 0.01). The aetiology of the intraoperative deaths with one exception was exsanguination. Emergency thoracotomy or sternotomy indicated a poor prognosis with a mortality rate of 80%. The most common intraoperative problem was an elevated airway pressure. Awake intubation was undertaken in 77.5% of patients requiring anaesthesia and surgery because of the potentially compromised airways and difficult intubations due to the nature of the associated injuries. Finally, 74% of patients undergoing urgent surgery required mechanical postoperative ventilation. The presence of blunt chest trauma should be considered a marker of the severity of injury sustained by the patient.\r"

Use of blood products was compared in patients having (1) coronary artery bypass grafting, (2) valvular surgery, (3) or a combination of 1 and 2. First operations were compared with reoperations. Overall, the use of homologous blood products was greatest in patients of Group 3, intermediate in patients of Group 2, and smallest in patients of Group 1. Reoperations were associated with an increase in intraoperative transfusion of packed red blood cells, but postoperative chest drainage was similar to first operations. When all blood products (packed red blood cells, fresh frozen plasma and platelets) were taken into consideration, patients undergoing primary CABG or valve surgery were the least exposed to homologous blood donors (five and six units transfused respectively). Repeat CABG was associated with an intermediate exposure to homologous blood products (eight units). Finally, primary and repeat combined procedures, and repeat valve surgery were associated with the greatest exposure to foreign blood products (10, 13 and 10 units respectively). The data presented in this study provide a rational basis for stratification of procedures according to the expected use of blood products, particularly in view of future studies which may be planned to examine the efficiency of blood conservation strategies.\r"

Seven ASA physical status I patients undergoing general anaesthesia (enflurane 1-2 MAC, nitrous oxide 50%, and oxygen) for minor orthopaedic surgery were studied in the supine position. Changes in oesophageal pressure (delta Pes) were measured by means of a catheter-tip pressure transducer. This micromanometer was positioned according to an occlusion test where delta Pes were compared with the changes in airway opening pressure (delta Pao). Optimizing the signal/noise ratio, we observed a linear relationship between delta Pes and delta Pao. In each patient, the delta Pes/delta Pao relationship was highly reproducible. Using the linear regression analysis to characterize the delta Pes/delta Pao relationship, we have developed a different approach for the positioning of oesophageal catheter. After statistical analysis of the observed delta Pes/delta Pao relationship, a \"calibration\" factor can be used in order to correct the observed slope of the delta Pes/delta Pao relationship to its theoretical value. We conclude that an oesophageal catheter-tip micromanometer can be used in anaesthetized supine patients to measure changes in pleural pressure.\r"

  ".W": "The role of the baricity of local anaesthetic solutions in determining the distribution of local anaesthetics injected into the subarachnoid space (and hence the level of anaesthesia) has been challenged. A recent study found no difference in the extent of cephalad spread of hyperbaric and isobaric solutions and concluded that density had no effect on the spread of local anesthetics. The present study, to determine the validity of this conclusion, utilized a spinal model filled with a \"cerebrospinal fluid equivalent.\" Following the injection of hyperbaric lidocaine, the local anaesthetic was most concentrated at the lower end of the column, whereas following the injection of isobaric solution the local anaesthetic was most concentrated around the site of injection. Therefore, baricity is an important determinant of local anaesthetic distribution in the subarachnoid space.\r"

Adult male Sprague Dawley rats, anaesthetized with intraperitoneal pentobarbital, were divided into four groups. Groups I and III were pretreated with iv propranolol 150 micrograms.kg-1, and Groups II and IV received iv NS as a placebo. Three minutes later, rats in Groups I and II received plain 0.5% bupivacaine, 4 mg.kg-1, and Groups III and IV received 4 mg.kg-1 of 0.5% bupivacaine with epinephrine, 5 micrograms.ml-1 iv. Five of eight rats pretreated with propranolol survived (Group I), compared with uniform fatality with NS pretreatment (Group II) (P less than 0.05). Addition of epinephrine to the bupivacaine eliminated the protective effect of propranolol. All rats pretreated with propranolol (Group III) or NS (Group IV) died when given bupivacaine with epinephrine. In conclusion, acute propranolol pretreatment reduced the fatal cardiotoxicity due to iv bupivacaine in male Sprague Dawley rats, but the addition of epinephrine 5 micrograms.ml-1 to bupivacaine eliminated the protective effect of propranolol.\r"

DESIGN: Prospective randomized sequential alternating cycle trial comparing IUI with luteinizing hormone (LH)-timed intercourse. SETTING: Clinical infertility service. PATIENTS: Couples selected included unexplained infertility (n = 73), cervical mucus hostility (n = 24), moderate semen defect (n = 110), and severe semen defect (n = 78). Two hundred eighty-five couples undertook 600 IUI cycles and 505 LH-timed intercourse. RESULTS: Overall, IUI was slightly more effective than LH-timed intercourse with a pregnancy rate of 6.2% versus 3.4% per cycle. When individual categories were considered only, IUI for severe semen defect was significantly better (5.6% versus 1.3%, P less than 0.05). The first IUI cycle was more effective when compared with both subsequent IUI cycles and the initial LH-timed cycle. Overall, 74% (27/37) of IUI pregnancies occurred in the first cycle. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with LH-timed intercourse, IUI provided little or no improved expectation of pregnancy but was beneficial in couples with severe semen defect. The occurrence of pregnancy was limited per cycle and confined essentially to the initial cycle of treatment. Continued IUI is considered to be unrewarding.\r"

DESIGN: Sperm motility index was measured by an electro-optical device, the Sperm Quality Analyzer (United Medical Systems Inc., Santa Ana, CA). Human semen samples covering the whole span of qualities were analyzed prospectively and simultaneously by both methods. SETTING: Samples were collected from patients referred to university hospital infertility clinics. PATIENTS, PARTICIPANTS: Nine hundred sixty-eight semen samples of 812 patients and healthy men were analyzed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Sperm motility index is a measurement of optical density fluctuations caused by motile cells; therefore, a positive correlation was anticipated between its values and semen motility parameters. RESULTS: Sperm motility index values demonstrated statistically significant correlation with motile cell concentration, total cell concentration, and percent motile cells. They were also shown to reliably represent semen quality assessment obtained by two experienced andrologists. CONCLUSIONS: The sperm motility index provides a reliable and objective reflection of semen motility parameters and quality.\r"

DESIGN: Rats were injected intrabursally with protein kinase (H9 or staurosporin) or proteinase (alpha 2-macroglobulin) inhibitors and oocyte release was evaluated. SETTING: Clinical Research Laboratory, Center for Reproductive Medicine, University of Kentucky Medical Center. PARTICIPANTS: Immature rats stimulated with pregnant mare serum gonadotropin. INTERVENTIONS: Staurosporin (1 or 10 microM), H9 (1 mM), alpha 2-macroglobulin (835 microIU of activity); or vehicle was injected into the right ovarian bursa. The left ovarian bursa remained intact. Animals immediately received human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Analysis of oocyte release and ovarian morphology. RESULTS: Oocyte release from the inhibitor-treated side decreased for the H9 group (8.1 +/- 1.9 fewer oocytes released, P less than 0.001) and the 10 microM staurosporin group (5.5 +/- 0.6, P less than 0.001). No change in oocyte release was observed in the 1 microM staurosporin, alpha 2-macroglobulin, or vehicle injected groups. Histologic examination of vehicle treated ovaries demonstrated numerous developing corpora lutea (CL; 20.5 +/- 2.1 CL/ovary) and a lack of preovulatory follicles. In contrast, ovaries treated with PK inhibitors contained unruptured preovulatory follicles coincident with fewer forming CL (11.5 +/- 3.5 CL/ovary). CONCLUSIONS: Inhibition of PK activity in vivo suppresses ovulation, demonstrating that protein phosphorylation plays an important intermediary role in the ovulatory process.\r"

Three women were diagnosed as 21-hydroxylase deficient late-onset adrenal hyperplasia by a 17-OHP level greater than 1,000 ng/dL 30 minutes after acute adrenal stimulation, and one patient was diagnosed as 11-hydroxylase deficient late-onset adrenal hyperplasia when her 11-deoxycortisol level was threefold the upper 95th percentile of normal. Two patients with 21-hydroxylase deficient late-onset adrenal hyperplasia had normal adrenal glands on MRI. Another 21-hydroxylase deficient late-onset adrenal hyperplasia patient was noted to have a 2.5 x 3.3-cm left adrenal nodule, which had been documented some 4 years earlier on CT scan and had not changed in size during that interval. This patient was 40 years of age when the diagnosis of late-onset adrenal hyperplasia was established. The patient with 11-hydroxylase deficient late-onset adrenal hyperplasia demonstrated a diffuse enlargement of the left adrenal gland consistent with hyperplasia, with no focal lesions. In conclusion, although patients with late-onset adrenal hyperplasia may often demonstrate nodular or diffuse adrenocortical hyperplasia on MRI, not all patients with endocrinologically evident disease demonstrate such abnormalities, consistent with a lesser degree of ACTH stimulation compared with women with classical congenital adrenal hyperplasia.\r"

DESIGN: The study design included a retrospective anonymous survey of clinical data and screening for HIV-1 antibody by enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay (ELISA) in stored sera. Samples that were ELISA-positive were further tested by Western blot assay. Frequency distributions were analyzed by Fisher's exact test. SETTING: University tertiary care center. PARTICIPANTS: Based on availability of stored frozen sera, the total study population included 182 of 304 consecutively registered infertile couples. RESULTS: Seventy-five percent of the study population were found to have one or more risk factors for HIV infection. Of the 252 sera tested, 10 were repeatedly reactive by ELISA, and Western blot testing confirmed HIV-1 infection in one woman and two men. CONCLUSIONS: This relatively high HIV-1 seroprevalence (male: 2.6%; female: 0.6%) in a low-middle class infertile population emphasizes the urgent need to implement on-site HIV-infection counseling aimed at preventing the spread of disease to the healthy partner and fetus and to discuss therapeutic and reproductive options.\r"

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Sexually transmitted disease correlates, cervical chlamydial infection, cervical and serum chlamydial antibodies, cervical mucus qualities according to World Health Organization criteria, tubal abnormalities. RESULTS: Of the 175 cervical mucus samples studied, subnormal quality was because of imperfect timing of collection of 22 of the 23 subnormal samples. Tubal abnormalities correlated with more than five lifetime sexual partners (P less than 0.035), as well as with serum immunoglobulin G antibodies (P less than 0.05), which could be because of interaction between both risk factors. CONCLUSIONS: No correlation was found between subnormal cervical mucus and chlamydial infection. Approximately two thirds of the tubal abnormalities seem unrelated to exogenous factors, although further study seems warranted.\r"

DESIGN, SETTING, PATIENTS: Thirty-four women were investigated prospectively before a CO2-laser laparoscopy for infertility and/or pain at the University Hospital Gasthuisberg. Endometriosis was scored blindly. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The cytotoxicity, directed against the endometrium, was mediated by NK cells because this cytotoxicity could be removed by treating the effector cells with the NK-specific anti-Leu-11b monoclonal antibody. Consequently, we evaluated prospectively in those women the lymphocyte-mediated cytotoxicity toward NK sensitive (K562-assay) and autologous endometrial target cells. RESULTS: The NK activity (K562-assay) and the cytotoxicity against autologous endometrial cells were similarly decreased in women with endometriosis and correlated with the severity of the disease. Using heterologous effector cells, the decreased chromium release in women with endometriosis was less pronounced but still present. CONCLUSION: The decreased cytotoxicity to endometrial cells in women with endometriosis is mainly because of a defect in NK activity but is also partially because of a resistance of the endometrium to NK cytotoxicity.\r"

RESULTS: Chromosome anomalies were observed in 31.9% (29/91) of poor-quality embryos, 19.8% (18/91) displayed mosaicism (diploid/haploid, diploid/triploid, diploid/aneuploid), 5.5% (5/91) showed polyploidy, 2.2% (2/91) had pulverized chromosomes, 2.2% (2/91) revealed aneuploidy, 1.1% (1/91) had prematurely condensed chromosomes, and 1.1% (1/91) had structural rearrangements involving chromosome number 2. The mean age of patients showing anomalies (36.5 years) was not significantly higher than the mean for the entire group (35.5 years). CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of chromosome anomalies in fragmented human embryos is high. These anomalies originate either in the gametes or through mitotic nondisjunction within the embryos. It is not advisable to replace such embryos into patients going through in vitro fertilization.\r"

DESIGN: Of 970 IVF-ET cycles, 114 cycles (11.7%) terminated in preclinical abortions. Abortions were divided according to peak beta human chorionic gonadotropin (beta-hCG) values into chemical abortions (52%) occurring 2 weeks after ET with beta-hCG values not higher than 21 mIU/mL and peri-implantation abortions (47%) terminating spontaneously 4 weeks after ET; the latter had higher beta-hCG values for a longer period of time but without any sonographic evidence of gestational sac. No woman in the two groups needed curettage. RESULTS: After a chemical abortion, the pregnancy outcome had better ongoing pregnancy rates (24.7%) in comparison with the 17% achieved in the total IVF-ET cycles. CONCLUSIONS: It is concluded that these two groups most probably have different pathophysiological backgrounds and concomitantly different future clinical impacts.\r"

SETTING: In vitro fertilization program. PATIENTS: Thirty-three patients with positive antisperm antibodies undergoing 50 cycles of IVF-ET in which maternal serum was replaced by 5 mg/mL of bovine serum albumin (BSA) comprised the study group. Seventy-one patients with tubal infertility served as controls. In 50 of these, medium was supplemented with 7.5% maternal serum, and 21 were assigned to BSA substitution. RESULTS: Percentage of fertilization in the study group was significantly lower (41 +/- 31; mean +/- SD) than that of controls with maternal serum (77 +/- 15) and BSA (76 +/- 22). Early embryonic quality, as assessed by percentage of cleavage and morphological grading, was found to be inferior in patients with antisperm antibodies. The percentage of advanced embryos (greater than or equal to 4 blastomeres) at the time of transfer was 42 +/- 39 in the study group, compared with 65 +/- 23 and 75 +/- 35 for maternal serum and BSA controls, respectively. Percentage of morphologically favorable embryos (grades 1 and 2 in a 1 to 5 grading system) was 49 +/- 31 in the study group, compared with 78 +/- 35 and 74 +/- 23 for the controls. Percentage of clinical pregnancy was somewhat lower in the study group (12.5%) than in controls with either maternal serum (18%) or BSA (19%). CONCLUSIONS: Antisperm antibodies may have an adverse effect on fertilization and early embryonic development. Female immunological infertility may not be completely alleviated by IVF-ET.\r"

DESIGN: Women (n = 60) undergoing follicular stimulation for in vitro fertilization, using long-course analog therapy to suppress endogenous luteinizing hormone (LH), were randomly allocated to a short (34 hour) or long (39 hour) delay between human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) administration and oocyte retrieval. Each patient's oocytes were divided into two groups that were either inseminated immediately or after 5 hours. RESULTS: The incidence of polyspermic fertilization was highest in oocytes inseminated immediately after a short hCG/oocyte retrieval interval (17/100) and was significantly (P less than 0.05) reduced by preincubation and/or a long hGG/oocyte retrieval interval. Fertilization rates were higher with 39 hours than with 34 hours in vivo maturation (84.2% versus 76.8%; P less than 0.05). The incidence of delayed fertilization was reduced by extending the hCG/oocyte retrieval interval (short, 12.9%; long, 3.9%; P less than 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Extension of the in vivo maturation time increased fertilization rates and eliminated the requirement for preinsemination incubation, allowing simplification of laboratory procedures.\r"

Many physicians, lacking research resources, may generalize their own patient registry data to the community. But practice populations are likely to differ significantly from community populations. This study compared demographics, health status, and medical care utilization in a sample of 990 elderly living in the community and 250 elderly patients registered at the St. Elizabeth Hospital Family Health Center in Youngstown, Ohio. The community survey and patient registries were comparable on key demographic characteristics. But statistically significant differences were observed for functional status and a number of chronic medical conditions. Comparisons of symptomatology, use of health aides, subjective health status, depression, and stress produced no significant differences. Overall health care utilization patterns were similar. The elderly family health center patients were more representative of the non-institutionalized elderly in the community than expected. And although the clinical significance remains uncertain, these findings suggest that this practice sample may be used with caution for COPC planning. But considerably more research must be undertaken in a variety of practice settings before the use of practice populations for COPC planning is widely applied.\r"

In particular, faculty physicians were more likely to verbally reinforce residents' efforts following the intervention. Analysis of 150 videotaped consultations revealed that several teaching behaviors remained at low rates, such as discussion of family issues.

Culture (as meaning system) is not an optional factor that only sometimes influences health and illness; it is prerequisite for all meaningful human experience, including that of being ill. A more adequate model of the relationship between culture and illness would demonstrate the preeminence of culture in the experience of illness among all people, not just members of \"exotic\" cultures; would view healers as well as patients as dwellers in culture; would incorporate the role of culture as meaning system in linking body, mind, and world; and would promote the significance of the cultural context as a resource for research and therapy.\r"

Relative to other western industrialized democracies, the US rations primary and preventive care more, tertiary care less, and makes greater use of price rationing and bureaucratic controls. Because insurance coverage is not universal and the extent of coverage varies across services, the poor and those patients needing long-term care are most heavily affected by price rationing. The current system also works to the advantage of procedure-oriented specialists and to the disadvantage of primary care physicians. Major reform of health care financing could change what is rationed, how it is rationed, and who is most affected. However, some rationing will remain necessary under any conceivable financing system.\r"

There was a regional difference in programs providing training; those in the northeast were least likely to provide training and were also least likely to be actively integrating training into their curricula. The three most common barriers to colposcopy training were lack of trained faculty, equipment costs, and inadequate patient volume.\r"

  ".W": "Murine autoimmune gastritis, induced by neonatal thymectomy, bears a striking similarity in pathology to the human autoimmune disease, pernicious anemia. Autoantibodies to parietal cells are found in both murine and human diseases. Monoclonal immunoglobulin G autoantibodies, obtained from neonatally thymectomized mice, have previously been shown to recognize two groups of gastric parietal cell antigens. In the present study, it is shown that two of these monoclonal autoantibodies, designated 1H9 and 2B6, are directed against the alpha subunit and beta subunit, respectively, of the gastric hydrogen-potassium-stimulated adenosine triphosphatase (H+,K(+)-ATPase; proton pump). Monoclonal antibody 1H9 showed reactivity by immunoblotting with a 95-kilodalton component of dog gastric tubulovesicular membranes and with a fusion protein containing the hydrophilic domain of the alpha subunit of the H+,K(+)-ATPase. Monoclonal antibody 2B6 reacted by immunoblotting with the 60-90-kilodalton glycoprotein (beta subunit) of the tomato lectin-purified dog H+,K(+)-ATPase and with the 60-90-kilodalton autoantigen purified with human parietal cell autoantibodies. Monoclonal antibody 2B6 also reacted with the deglycosylated 35-kilodalton core protein of the tomato lectin-purified 60-90-kilodalton beta subunit and of the purified 60-90-kilodalton autoantigen. Parietal cell autoantibody-positive sera from 20 mice with experimentally induced gastritis showed reactivity predominantly with the alpha and/or beta subunit of the gastric H+,K(+)-ATPase. Therefore, it is concluded that the major molecules targeted by parietal cell autoantibodies from mice with neonatal thymectomy-induced murine autoimmune gastritis and from humans with pernicious anemia are identical.\r"

Four groups of opossums (n = 6 in each) were perfused with either normal saline control) or 10, 20, or 100 mmol/L isoosmolar hydrochloric acid at 2 mL/min for 90 minutes using a midesophageal catheter. The distal esophagus was cannulated via a gastrostomy, and the effluent was collected and measured for intraluminal loss of IV injected 125I-bovine serum albumin. Plasma protein loss in the control group was constant with a total loss of 3.40 +/- 0.69 mg/g dry wt. Perfusion of 10, 20, and 100 mmol/L hydrochloric acid increased total protein loss to 8.06 +/- 2.62, 13.94 +/- 2.72, and 27.34 +/- 4.34 mg/g dry wt, respectively. The protein loss was not associated with intraluminal blood loss, as measured by previously injected 51Cr-labeled autologous red blood cells. Histological changes, scored by a blinded observer, were significant only between control animals and those perfused with 100 mmol/L hydrochloric acid. Separate studies using the vascular tracer monastral blue B demonstrated an increase in labeling of lamina propria blood vessels that varied directly with the concentration of acid perfusate, thereby providing direct morphological evidence of microvascular injury. These studies suggest that increased microvascular permeability occurs early in the course of acid-induced esophageal injury.\r"

The cells have been in continuous passage for 46 months. Tissue culture cells produce tumors in a dose-dependent fashion after SC inoculation of cell suspensions in athymic nude mice. BON tumors, grown in nude mice, are histologically identical to the original tumor; they possess gastrin and somatostatin receptors, synthesize serotonin and chromogranin A, and have a doubling time of approximately 13 days. The antiproliferative effects of the long-acting somatostatin analogue, SMS 201-995 (300 micrograms/kg, t.i.d.), and 2% alpha-difluoromethylornithine on BON xenografts in nude mice were examined. Tumor size was significantly decreased by day 14 of treatment with either agent and at all points of analysis thereafter until the animals were killed (day 33). In addition, tumor weight, DNA, RNA, and protein contents were significantly decreased in treated mice compared with controls. Establishment of this human carcinoid xenograft line, BON, provides an excellent model to study further the biological behavior of carcinoid tumors and the in vivo effect of chemotherapeutic agents on tumor growth.\r"

In this study the same rabbit model is used to assess whether migrating action potential complex activity or fluid output is induced by recombinant strains of V. cholerae that produce no subunit of cholera toxin (CT A-B-) or only by the inactive binding subunit (CT A-B+). Three live strains were studied: El Tor wild-type N16961 (CT A+B+) and recombinant strains CVD106 (CT A-B+) and JBK70 (CT A-B-). Controls received sterile culture broth. Migrating action potential complex frequency in animals inoculated with CT A+B+ was significantly increased compared with that in all other experimental groups (P less than 0.01). Fluid output was also increased in animals inoculated with CT A+B+ compared with fluid output in all other groups (P less than 0.05). Migrating action potential complex frequency and fluid output in rabbits given CT A-B+ or CT A-B- did not differ from activity in controls. How these recombinant strains induce diarrhea is unknown, but the mechanism may involve bacterial colonization or production of an unknown toxin.\r"

In animal models of intestinal water and ion transport, neuropeptide Y decreases stimulated secretion but has no consistent effect on basal transport. In the present study, the effect of neuropeptide Y on jejunal water and electrolyte transport in healthy volunteers was investigated under basal conditions and during intestinal secretion induced by intraluminal administration of prostaglandin E2. The triple-lumen tube technique was used for perfusion of the small intestine with a plasmalike electrolyte solution containing polyethylene glycol as a nonabsorbable volume marker. After an initial control period (saline IV) neuropeptide Y was administered IV at a dose of 400 pmol.kg-1.h-1. Neuropeptide Y significantly increased net absorption of water, sodium, potassium, and chloride under basal conditions. The peptide significantly reduced the secretion of these electrolytes induced by an intraluminal prostaglandin E2 concentration of 5 mumol/L and reduced net water secretion by 36%. The results of the current study suggest that neuropeptide Y can change intestinal water and ion transport from secretion toward absorption.\r"

  ".W": "In this study, the presence of a bicarbonate gradient-dependent, carrier-mediated anion exchange process for butyrate (a representative short-chain fatty acid) uptake in apical membrane vesicles isolated from rat distal colon is described. An outward gradient of both butyrate- and bicarbonate-stimulated [14C]butyrate uptake and resulted in transient accumulation (an \"overshoot\" phenomenon). Butyrate gradient-stimulated [14C]butyrate uptake was not altered either by an imposed pH gradient or at different pH values. In contrast, bicarbonate gradient-stimulated [14C]butyrate uptake was stimulated severalfold by an additional imposition of an outward pH gradient (pHi = 7.5; pH0 = 6.0). This bicarbonate- and pH gradient-stimulated butyrate uptake was not inhibited by either voltage clamping, with equimolar intravesicular and extravesicular K+ and valinomycin, or 4,4'-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid (DIDS), an anion-exchange inhibitor. Increasing butyrate concentrations saturated the bicarbonate- and pH gradient-stimulated butyrate uptake with a half-maximal concentration (Km) of 26.9 +/- 1.6 mmol/L. Butyrate uptake was substantially inhibited by 20 mmol/L propionate (45%) and acetate (60%) but was not inhibited by oxalate, inorganic anions (SO4(2-) and NO3-), and transport inhibitors (amiloride, acetazolamide, furosemide, and ouabain). It is concluded from these results that bicarbonate gradient-stimulated butyrate uptake in apical membrane vesicles of rat distal colon occurs via a carrier-mediated anion-exchange process that differs from other DIDS-sensitive anion exchanges [e.g., the Cl- -OH- (HCO3-) process].\r"

  ".W": "The changes in dietary constituents during growth and development from predominantly liquid to mixed solid liquid meals places an increasing burden on the antrum, which is required to triturate solids. The authors hypothesize that concomitant with these changing dietary constituents different pathways are used to mediate contraction in response to acetylcholine. Smooth muscle cells were isolated by collagenase digestion from the fundus and circular muscle layer of the antrum in the adult cat and 1-week-old kitten. The unstimulated cells from the fundus and antrum were larger in the adult than in the kitten. In normal physiological salt solution, all cells contracted in a similar dose dependent manner in response to acetylcholine in both age groups. Fundic muscle cell contraction in response to acetylcholine was unchanged in calcium-free physiological salt solution or in the presence of the calcium channel blocker, methoxyverapamil. In the adult, antral cells contracted 50% less in the absence of extracellular calcium. In the kitten, antral cells did not contract under the same conditions. After permeabilization with saponin, fundic muscle cells from the adult and kitten contracted fully in response to 1,4,5-inositol trisphosphate, whereas contraction of adult antral cells was reduced by 50% and contraction of kitten antral cells was completely blocked. These data suggest that isolated muscle cells from the fundus of both the adult cat and newborn kitten use intracellular calcium stores to contract in response to acetylcholine and 1,4,5-inositol triphosphate. In adult antral cells, acetylcholine-induced contraction requires both influx of extracellular calcium and release of intracellular calcium. In kitten antral cells, intracellular calcium stores are not used or available to mediate contraction in response to acetylcholine.\r"

Each of 153 fluoroscopic barium swallow sequences was analyzed on a swallow-by-swallow basis. Two distinct pressure domains were identified: intrabolus pressure and pressure within a bolus-free contracting esophageal segment. Analyses in terms of these pressure domains showed specific and consistent correlations between the radiographic and manometric findings. Radiography was insensitive to contractions occurring in esophageal segments devoid of bolus fluid, whereas manometry was insensitive to contractions that did not occlude the lumen. It is concluded that using fluid mechanical principles of bolus transport allows meaningful comparison of esophageal motility as recorded by radiography and intraluminal manometry. However, the inherent limitations in the range of physical phenomena recorded by each modality make these techniques complementary for evaluating esophageal motor function.\r"

Intraluminal pH was recorded for 3 postprandial hours from the distal, middle, and proximal esophagus on two separate occasions (with subjects in upright and supine positions). With the subjects in a supine position, about half of the acid reflux episodes reached the proximal esophagus in patients as well as in controls. This percentage decreased to 25% in patients and 29% in controls when they were upright. In both groups, the pH drops in the distal esophagus were significantly greater than in the proximal esophagus for both the supine and upright positions. In both patients and controls, a 4-5-fold greater acid exposure occurred in the distal esophagus, than in the proximal esophagus. In both patient and control groups, acid exposure time, as well as the number of reflux episodes in the distal esophagus, were significantly greater than that of the proximal esophagus (P less than 0.05). Spontaneous acid clearance time in the distal esophagus was significantly longer than that of the proximal esophagus in both positions (P less than 0.05) for both subject groups. In conclusion, regional differences exist in the exposure of the esophageal mucosa to refluxed gastric acid. These regional differences are more pronounced when subjects are upright than supine. Regional differences also exist in esophageal acid clearance, with clearance taking longer in the distal esophagus than in the proximal esophagus. The net effect of these phenomena is that acid exposure time in the distal esophagus is greater than that in the remainder of the esophagus.\r"

The results indicate that adult rats readily absorbed 0.4 g of fructose, an amount equivalent to 1.4-1.6 g fructose/kg body wt. Acute malabsorption of fructose occurred with doses greater than 0.6 g (2.1-2.4 g/kg body wt). Continued exposure to dietary fructose resulted in a decrease in the evidence of colonic fermentation. Glucose or galactose administered with fructose enhanced the absorption of fructose. The greatest absorption was observed when equal amounts of fructose and glucose were given simultaneously. If glucose was ingested as a polymer (starch or dextrin), the stimulatory effect was dependent on the digestibility of the polymer. Sucrose given with the fructose and glucose diminished the absorption of fructose. Acarbazone, a specific inhibitor of alpha-glucosidases, including sucrase, also inhibited the facilitating effect of glucose and galactose in absorption of fructose. These results give evidence for joint absorption of the two monosaccharides, fructose and glucose.\r"

Eighty-five patients with documented hereditary hemochromatosis diagnosed between 1958 and 1989 and followed up at the University Hospital (University of Western Ontario) medical center were retrospectively reviewed for this analysis. The current status of the patient was assessed by interview or written questionnaire completed by the patient or the family physician. Estimates of differences in survival rates were obtained using Kaplan-Meier life-table and Cox regression analysis. Liver histology, clinical features of the disease, and number of venesections were analyzed to determine their relationship to survival. In the course of a mean follow-up interval of 8.1 +/- 6.8 years (range, 0-31 years), there were 17 deaths among the 85 hemochromatosis patients. Patients with cirrhosis at the time of diagnosis were 5.5 times more likely to die than noncirrhotic patients. Patients who were noncirrhotic at the time of diagnosis had an estimated survival that was not significantly different from age- and sex-matched members of the normal population. Diabetes did not increase the risk of death after data were controlled for the presence of cirrhosis. Early diagnosis and treatment of hemochromatosis in the precirrhotic stage can lead to long-term survival similar to that in the general population. The presence of cirrhosis significantly increases mortality and is the major clinical factor affecting survival.\r"

Dilatation is also a feature of several pathophysiological states and, therefore, the propensity of the colon to dilate might be important in disease. An electromechanical barostat was applied to the human colon, and changes in colonic tone were recorded in response to physiological perturbations. In 16 studies of 14 healthy volunteers, the colon was prepared for colonoscopy and a manometry-barostat assembly was positioned in the ascending (n = 5), transverse (n = 4), or descending (n = 7) colon. The influences of food and overnight sleep were recorded. The barostat continuously monitored, at a constant pressure, the volume of air within a highly compliant 10-cm bag. Changes in tone, as reflected by changes in bag volume, were usually unassociated with waves of intraluminal pressure recorded from adjacent manometric sites. Thus, the barostat revealed a motor phenomenon not readily apparent by conventional manometry. Food caused an immediate though slowly progressive increase in tone; however, bag volumes were greatest during overnight sleep and were decreased on waking. The barostat has the potential to explore another possibly important aspect of colonic function in humans.\r"

This severe solubility limitation has been partly overcome by intraluminal substances that bind and solubilize iron, thus increasing availability for absorption. While several dietary ligands capable of solubilizing Fe2+ in intestinal lumen have been described, an endogenous binding ligand has not been previously described. It has recently been shown that certain trihydroxy bile acids (taurocholate and glycocholate) show high-affinity premicellar and low-affinity micellar Fe(2+)-binding properties, resulting in the formation of soluble Fe(2+)-bile salt complexes. It was hypothesized that this binding would increase the intraluminal pool of soluble iron, increase delivery of soluble iron to mucosal carriers, and thus enhance intestinal Fe2+ uptake. As a first step toward testing this hypothesis, the effect of taurocholate on Fe2+ uptake from all regions of in vivo rat small intestine is reported. It is shown that taurocholate, at premicellar concentrations, produces a marked, stepwise increase in Fe2+ uptake from all regions of small bowel, with little further increase above the critical micellar concentration. Enhancement of intestinal Fe2+ uptake is a newly described effect, and potential physiological function, of premicellar bile salts.\r"

Four patients (two male and two female) with such autoantibodies were studied. Immunofluorescence analysis showed two different disjunctive staining patterns: complement-fixing apical (three of four) and cytoplasmic (the remaining fourth one), which are shown to be directed against different structures. All three patients positive for complement-fixing apical gut epithelial cell autoantibodies had abnormal T-cell responses in vitro, one of them with an immunoglobulin G2 immunoglobulin deficiency and another with an immunoglobulin A deficiency. An immunoglobulin A deficiency without T-cell alterations was also diagnosed in the cytoplasmic gut epithelial cell autoantibody-positive patient. These findings suggest that different immunologic alterations (either a T-cell abnormality or immunoglobulin deficiency) may favor the appearance of gut epithelial cell autoantibodies (complement-fixing apical or cytoplasmic, respectively). Furthermore, these autoantibodies should not be considered a specific marker of autoimmune enteropathy, because they may not always be associated with such a disease: two patients with apical gut epithelial cell autoantibodies showed no signs of intestinal lesion or diarrhea.\r"

As judged by the amiloride-sensitive component of the short-circuit current, electrogenic sodium absorption appeared unmodified in cystic fibrosis. In contrast, the short-circuit current response to specific stimuli of both cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)- and calcium-mediated chloride secretion was drastically altered in all of the cystic fibrosis biopsy specimens examined. Stimulation of the cAMP pathway by 8-bromo cAMP or forskolin resulted in a sustained increase in short-circuit current in control tissues (+ 2.51 +/- 0.63 microA/cm2) but in a slight change in the opposite direction in cystic fibrosis (-0.56 +/- 0.49 microA/cm2; P less than 0.05). Carbachol, a calcium-linked secretagogue, provoked a transient increase in short-circuit current in all of the control tissues (peak response, + 26.69 +/- 3.63 microA/cm2) but a transient change in the opposite direction in 6 of 11 cystic fibrosis tissues (-12.46 +/- 4.64 microA/cm2; P less than 0.05). In 2 of 11 patients with cystic fibrosis, however, a significant but subnormal and transient increase in short-circuit current was observed (+ 2.62 +/- 0.04 microA/cm2; P less than 0.05), whereas in 3 of 11 patients with cystic fibrosis a transient change in the opposite direction (-9.83 +/- 2.20 microA/cm2; P less than 0.05) was followed by a small and transient increase (+ 2.89 +/- 0.83 microA/cm2; P less than 0.05). Using the calcium-mediated secretory response therefore, patients with cystic fibrosis could be divided into two categories: a major population showing defective anion secretion but active cation secretion and a subclass (including three siblings) showing residual but subnormal anion secretion. The easy accessibility of rectal samples and the inversed direction of the cAMP- or calcium-provoked short-circuit current is of considerable advantage in the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis.\r"

Morphometry in parietal cells showed that aspirin induced a sixfold increase in secretory canalicular membrane elaboration. Aspirin potentiated histamine-induced parietal cell respiration and aminopyrine uptake ratio but did not increase basal respiration or aminopyrine uptake, suggesting an apparent dissociation from aspirin-induced morphological changes.\r"

Rectal mucosal biopsy specimens were obtained through a proctoscope every 2 or 3 hours for a 24-hour span. Ex vivo measurements of tritiated thymidine incorporation into DNA were made on the mucosal samples. Feeding and time of day were each found to have an effect on the rate of thymidine incorporation into the DNA of rectal mucosal cells. Both fasted and fed subjects showed significant circadian rhythms in thymidine incorporation, which peaked at about 7 AM. Fasting lowered the overall mean thymidine uptake without altering the rhythm. Thymidine uptake generally reflects the amount of DNA synthesis in the sampled tissue. Therefore, these data may be important in the design of cancer chemotherapeutic regimens that use drugs specifically active during DNA synthesis.\r"

This study examined how this increase in blood flow is brought about. When the stomach of urethane-anesthetized rats was perfused with 0.15N HCl, disruption of the gastric mucosal barrier with 15% ethanol increased the disappearance of acid from the gastric lumen and enhanced gastric mucosal blood flow. This increase in blood flow was blocked by local arterial infusion of tetrodotoxin (60 ng/min) to the stomach and by chemical ablation of capsaicin-sensitive sensory neurons. Inhibition of the blood flow increase was associated with exaggeration of gross and histological injury to the mucosa. IV injection of atropine (0.2 mg/kg) or pyrilamine (2 mg/kg) did not affect blood flow increase in response to barrier disruption, whereas morphine injection (2 mg/kg) inhibited it. The current findings show that the increase in gastric mucosal blood flow that follows disruption of the gastric mucosal barrier in the presence of acid is mediated by sensory neurons that seem to monitor acid back-diffusion and in turn signal for a protective increase in blood flow.\r"

The present study was undertaken to determine whether brush border membrane vesicles obtained from jejunal enterocytes of spontaneously hypertensive rats show increased Na(+)-H+ exchange as part of a generalized membrane disorder. Brush border membrane vesicles were prepared from the jejunum of adult spontaneously hypertensive rats and Wistar-Kyoto rats using an Mg2+/ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid precipitation method. Uptake of 22Na by these vesicles was found to be into an osmotically sensitive intravesicular space rather than mere binding. Initial Na+ uptake by brush border membrane vesicles was greater in spontaneously hypertensive rats than in Wistar-Kyoto rats (P less than 0.05). Higher total and amiloride-sensitive Na+ uptake in spontaneously hypertensive rats occurred in the presence of an outwardly directed pH gradient, and uptake became statistically similar to that of Wistar-Kyoto rats in the absence of a pH gradient. Moreover, amiloride-insensitive Na+ uptake under an outwardly directed pH gradient did not differ significantly between the two groups. The enhanced Na(+)-H+ activity in spontaneously hypertensive rats is not due to altered membrane permeability to protons, as is shown by acridine orange-quenching studies. Kinetic studies for amiloride-sensitive Na+ uptake showed a greater Vmax in spontaneously hypertensive rats compared with Wistar-Kyoto rats (1.46 +/- 0.05 vs. 1.08 +/- 0.08 nmol.mg protein-1.7 s-1) but the Km values were similar in the two groups. These finding, along with similar findings previously reported in vascular smooth muscle and renal tissue of SHR, strongly suggest that an increased Na(+)-H+ exchange is related to the development of hypertension.\r"

It was found that three antibodies against H. pylori, CB-4, CB-10, and CB-14, that cross-react with the human gastric mucosa also intensely cross-reacted with murine gastric epithelial cells. A strong reaction against autologous mucosa was also evident in the sera of mice immunized with H. pylori but not with other bacteria. A serological study performed in a group of 82 patients undergoing gastroscopy showed that the presence of seropositivity against H. pylori was strongly correlated with the presence of autoantibodies against human antral gastric mucosa. This activity was neutralized after absorption of the sera with H. pylori but not with other gram-negative bacteria. The antibodies in the mouse and in the human did not react with other segments of the gastrointestinal tract or with most of the other organs. Mice bearing hybridomas secreting a cross-reacting antibody (CB-4) had histopathologic abnormalities in their stomachs. These lesions were absent in the stomachs of mice bearing hybridomas secreting a non-cross-reacting antibody (CB-26). It was concluded that H. pylori infection can stimulate antibodies cross-reacting with gastric autoantigens and that this immunologic mechanism may represent a pathogenic link between H. pylori and gastritis.\r"

Bile acid solutions ranged in concentration from 0.3 to 10 mmol/L; histamine release was assessed by a fluorimetric assay, and cell lysis by cytosolic enzyme (lactate dehydrogenase) release. Lipophilic, dihydroxy bile acids (chenodeoxycholic acid and deoxycholic acid as well as their glycine and taurine conjugates) caused histamine release in a dose-related manner; cholic acid and its conjugates caused much less or no histamine release. Two hydrophilic bile acids (ursodeoxycholic acid and ursocholic acid and their conjugates) were virtually devoid of activity. Histamine release, which was independent of extracellular Ca2+, occurred at 0.3 mmol/L, well below the critical micellization concentration. For a given concentration, unconjugated bile acids and glycine-conjugated bile acids induced more histamine release than taurine-conjugated bile acids; maximal release was observed at 3 mmol/L for lipophilic, dihydroxy bile acids. To test whether bile acids could also cause histamine release from cutaneous mast cells in vivo, rats were injected intradermally with bile acid solutions and histamine release assessed by capillary leakage of Evan's blue dye. Cutaneous blueing was greater with cytotoxic bile acids, chenodeoxycholyglycine or deoxycholylglycine, than with ursodeoxycholylglycine and was inhibited by prior antihistamine treatment. Histamine release correlated highly and positively with lipophilicity and with bile acid surface activity. It was concluded that lipophilic but not hydrophilic bile acids possess concentration-dependent cytotoxicity toward mast cells causing histamine release, that unconjugated and glycine-conjugated bile acids are more potent than taurine-conjugated bile acids, and that mast cell histamine release is highly correlated with lipophilicity of bile acids as well as their surface activity.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of phosphatidylcholine and cholesterol on bile salt-induced cytotoxicity was investigated. Experiments were performed in both human erythrocytes and cultured CaCo-2 cells, a model system for gastrointestinal epithelium. Hemolysis induced by 50 mmol/L sodium-taurocholate was reduced by both lecithin and cholesterol in a concentration-dependent manner. Cholesterol was 10 times more effective than phosphatidylcholine. Addition of only small amounts of the sterol to phosphatidylcholine/taurocholate solutions eliminated all cytotoxicity. The protective influence of cholesterol is probably mediated through a direct effect on the membrane. Incubation of erythrocytes with a cholesterol/taurocholate mixture greatly increased the cholesterol content of the membrane. With respect to sensitivity to bile salts and the protective effect of lecithin, CaCo-2 cells behaved very similar to erythrocytes. However, cholesterol failed to have any cytoprotective effect when used in combination with taurocholate or phosphatidylcholine/taurocholate solutions. Interestingly, at relatively high concentrations of cholesterol (cholesterol saturation index greater than 1.0), the sterol even increased cytotoxicity. This correlated with a cholesterol-induced shift of phosphatidylcholine from micelles to vesicles, which normally occurs in supersaturated model and human bile. The different sensitivity of the two cell types to the effect of cholesterol on bile salt damage might be caused by the difference in lipid membrane composition. In conclusion, CaCo-2 cells represent a physiologically more relevant model system to study bile cytotoxicity than erythrocytes. When extrapolated to gallbladder epithelial cells, these results could be relevant for the pathogenesis of gallstone disease. The increased cytotoxicity might be the signal by means of which supersaturated bile induces mucin hypersecretion by gallbladder epithelial cells.\r"

Multiple cysts and microcystic (serous) cystadenomas of the pancreas have also been reported occasionally in patients afflicted with this syndrome. In the large Freiburg study of the von Hippel-Lindau syndrome composed of 66 affected individuals, pancreatic lesions were systematically studied. Fifty-five living individuals were examined by abdominal ultrasound imaging. Abnormal findings were confirmed by computed tomographic scan and/or magnetic resonance imaging. For an additional 11 decreased patients autopsy data were available. Cystic lesions of the pancreas were found in 10 patients (15%). One of these patients presented with multiple pancreatic cysts as the only manifestation of the syndrome. In one patient, a malignant islet-cell tumor was found at autopsy. Because multiple pancreatic cysts did not cause major clinical symptoms and because follow-up examinations over an average period of 5 years did not show significant progression of the lesions, it is concluded that these patients usually do not require surgical treatment. Abdominal ultrasound screening is recommended for patients at risk as a tool to identify potential von Hippel-Lindau syndrome gene carriers with pancreatic manifestations. In all patients with multiple pancreatic cysts, the von Hippel-Lindau syndrome should be included in the differential diagnosis.\r"

The bile flow rate was facilitated by stimulation of the same area. These responses were obtained even in dogs with cervical cord transection and were abolished by cervical vagotomy. The contraction response in the gallbladder was prevented by atropine, but a slight relaxation response in the sphincter remained. On the other hand, stimulation of the posterior hypothalamic area induced gallbladder relaxation and contraction or relaxation in the sphincter. The bile flow rate was decreased by stimulation of the same area. These responses were still obtained after vagotomy. These results indicate that the anterior hypothalamic area and the vagus nerves play an important role in gallbladder emptying in the cephalic phase.\r"

This study attempted to evaluate the comparative effects of two gallstone-dissolving agents, chenodeoxycholic acid and ursodeoxycholic acid, on bile acid metabolism and biliary lipid secretion in obese subjects in order to identify the bile acid of choice in preventing and treating gallstone disease in obesity. Twenty obese subjects (greater than 120% ideal body wt) were randomly treated with ursodeoxycholic acid (10 mg.kg-1.day-1.1 mo-1) and then with chenodeoxycholic acid (15 mg.kg-1.day-1.1 mo-1) or with chenodeoxycholic acid first and then with ursodeoxycholic acid. Patients 1-10 were studied while eating an unrestricted weight-maintenance diet, whereas patients 11-20 were eating a 1080-kcal/d hypocaloric diet. Biliary lipid composition, cholesterol saturation index, and biliary bile acid pattern were evaluated in all subjects before and after each treatment period; in subjects 6-10 and 16-20, biliary lipid secretion rates and bile acid pool size were also evaluated. Both ursodeoxycholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid decreased cholesterol outputs and cholesterol saturation index. However, during the weight-maintenance period the decrease induced by chenodeoxycholic acid was not significant. Biliary cholesterol outputs and cholesterol saturation index were always lower during ursodeoxycholic acid administration than during chenodeoxycholic acid therapy. Ursodeoxycholic acid levels during ursodeoxycholic acid administration and chenodeoxycholic acid levels during chenodeoxycholic acid administration increased in bile to 50% and 77%, respectively, of total bile acid levels. Bile acid pool size remained unchanged during chenodeoxycholic acid administration and was significantly reduced by ursodeoxycholic acid administration during the weight-reduction period. In conclusion, ursodeoxycholic acid in obese subjects seems more effective than chenodeoxycholic acid, at least during weight maintenance, in reducing cholesterol saturation of bile. This effect is related to a significant decrease of biliary cholesterol output.\r"

  ".W": "The role of cholecystokinin (CCK) in the regulation of gastric emptying and pancreatic enzyme secretion was evaluated by infusing the CCK-receptor antagonist loxiglumide. Gastric emptying rates and pancreatic secretory outputs were measured in five healthy volunteers by the double-indicator perfusion technique using a multiple-lumen tube in the duodenum. Placebo or loxiglumide (22 mumol.kg-1.h-1) was infused throughout each experiment. Five hundred-milliliter liquid intragastric meals of (a) fat, protein, and glucose (Ensure; Abbott, Chicago, IL); (b) glucose, 20 g/dL; and (c) guar gum, 1.1 g/dL, were given in random order. In addition, the effect of a physiologic CCK-8 dose (20 pmol.kg-1.h-1) after an intragastric 500-mL saline meal (0.154 mol/L) was tested. Intravenous CCK-8 induced a marked retardation of the gastric emptying rate of the saline solution (P less than 0.05) while stimulating pancreatic secretory outputs; both effects were completely abolished by the infusion of loxiglumide. Loxiglumide markedly accelerated the gastric emptying rates (by approximately 40%) and simultaneously diminished lipase (by approximately 75%) and trypsin (by approximately 50%) outputs of both the mixed meal (P less than 0.01) and the pure glucose meal (P less than 0.05). Additional experiments using gamma camera scintigraphy confirmed the accelerating effect of loxiglumide on gastric emptying of the mixed meal (P less than 0.01). The gastric emptying rate of the guar meal, which did not release CCK, was not influenced by the infusion of loxiglumide. Loxiglumide distinctly augmented plasma CCK levels after the mixed (2.6 times) and the pure glucose (2.1 times) meals while markedly reducing (approximately 76%) pancreatic polypeptide release (P less than 0.02). It is concluded that endogeneous CCK exerts a major role in the regulation of both gastric liquid emptying and pancreatic secretion in humans.\r"

Five patients had a history of symptoms mimicking pancreatitis; four developed steatorrhea and/or diabetes. At endoscopic retrograde pancreatography, five patients showed an open ampulla filled with mucin, and six patients showed patchy filling defects in the ectatic main duct. Morphological examination showed extreme dilatation of the entire pancreatic duct in six patients and its tail segment in two patients. The duct segments filled with viscous mucin were lined by well-differentiated mucin-secreting cells, forming papillary foldings and occasionally showing cellular atypia. None of the patients had invasive tumor or metastasis. Six patients whose lesions were resected are alive and doing well (mean follow-up, 5.5 years). It is concluded that intraductal mucin-hypersecreting neoplasm is a pancreatic tumor with favorable prognosis. Because it shares many features with intraductal papillary neoplasm, a common pathogenesis of these pancreatic tumors is suggested.\r"

Before transplantation, her plasma apolipoprotein B concentration was less than 1 mg/dL according to enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, whereas after transplantation her plasma apolipoprotein B concentration was 76 mg/dL (all apolipoprotein B-100). Apolipoprotein B content was reduced in her intestine and liver compared with normal and cirrhotic controls. Cultured hepatocytes from the patient's explanted liver secreted a 1.006 g/mL less than or equal to d less than or equal to 1.063 g/mL lipoprotein rich in apolipoprotein E and a 1.063 g/mL less than or equal to d less than or equal to 1.21 g/mL lipoprotein containing apolipoproteins E and A-I with no immunodetectable apolipoprotein B in the culture medium. Normal hepatocytes secreted very low-density lipoprotein and low-density lipoprotein containing apolipoprotein B-100. Abetalipoproteinemic intestinal apolipoprotein B messenger RNA concentration was 4-5-fold higher than control values. However, the patient's liver apolipoprotein B messenger RNA level was one fifth that of control normal and cirrhotic liver. Analysis of the patient's intestinal and hepatic apolipoprotein B messenger RNA for posttranscriptional stop-codon insertion revealed normally edited transcripts. These results suggest that apolipoprotein B is synthesized as the product of a normally edited messenger RNA transcript, but not secreted, in abetalipoproteinemia.\r"

The current report includes four male patients with segmental ischemic colitis caused by idiopathic myointimal hyperplasia in the small mesenteric veins and their intramural branches; neither vasculitis nor arterial involvement were present. Three of the four patients were less than or equal to 38 years of age; the fourth was 67. All four patients were previously healthy and had no history of drug use of any kind. Clinical findings included abdominal pain, diarrhea, bloody stools, and colonic strictures discovered by barium enema. The intima of the mesenteric and intestinal mural veins was focally thickened by a marked increase in cells and matrix between the endothelium and internal elastic lamina, whereas the vessel walls external to the thickened intima appeared normal. Histochemistry and immunoreactivity with antibodies to muscle-specific actins (HHF-35) disclosed that the intimal thickening was caused by proliferation of smooth muscle cells in a proteoglycan matrix. All patients recovered completely after segmental resection of the ischemic portion of the colon and had no recurrence of intestinal symptoms on follow-up of up to 7 years. These unusual venous lesions do not appear to have been previously described; their etiology and pathogenesis remain unknown.\r"

  ".U": "91293520\r", 
  ".W": "Recent studies have shown that intrarectal administration of 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS) in ethanol or intramural injection of TNBS in saline produces an acute and possibly chronic colitis in rats. It has been assumed that interstitial TNBS initiates the inflammatory response via macrophage-mediated recognition and degradation of TNBS-modified mucosal cells and proteins. However, it is known that certain flavoproteins and/or reductants interact with compounds containing the nitro functional group to generate pro-inflammatory, nitrogen-centered free radicals and reactive oxygen metabolites. The objective of this study was to assess the ability of the rat colon, using either colon homogenates, isolated colonocytes, or intestinal interstitial fluid, to produce reactive oxygen species via enzymatic and/or nonenzymatic metabolism of TNBS. It was found that the addition of TNBS (1 mmol/L) to the 10,000 x g supernatant of rat colon homogenates increased the rate of superoxide production from normally undetectable levels to 2.6 +/- 0.23 nmol.min-1.mg protein-1. Addition of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, reduced form (NADH; 1 mmol/L) to colon homogenates containing TNBS significantly enhanced superoxide production to 10.4 +/- 0.9 nmol.min-1.mg-1. Similarly, addition of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate, reduced form (NADPH; 1 mmol/L) to colon extracts containing TNBS produced an even further increase in the rate of superoxide formation to 25.2 +/- 1.1 nmol.min-1.mg-1. Addition of NADH or NADPH to the colon homogenate in the absence of TNBS produced no detectable superoxide formation, suggesting that TNBS was required for the enhanced oxidative metabolism. In a separate series of experiments, it was found that isolated colonocytes produced small but significant amounts of superoxide (3.15 +/- 0.6 nmol/2 x 10(6) cells) that were significantly increased in the presence of ethanol to 6.55 +/- 1.14 nmol/2 x 10(6) cells. Using purified preparations of two flavoproteins found in the rat colon, it was shown that the addition of TNBS (1 mmol/L) to purified NADH dehydrogenase or glutathione reductase increased the rate of superoxide formation by these enzymes from normally undetectable levels to 1.6 nmol/min and 1.2 nmol/min, respectively. In addition, it was found that intestinal interstitial fluid (lymph) initiated redox cycling of TNBS such that 28.1 +/- 1.6 nmol of oxygen was consumed per minute per milliliter of lymph. This increase in oxygen consumption was inhibited by the addition of superoxide dismutase and catalase. One possible metabolite involved in both mucosal and lymph-mediated metabolism of TNBS is ascorbic acid.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Recent evidence suggests that a microtubular system-dependent, colchicine-sensitive transcellular pathway may transport both classes of these ligands. The relationship of this pathway to flux rates, however, remains unclear. Some structural evidence suggests an important role for a Golgi-associated vesicular system. Monensin, like colchicine, is a perturbing agent that is believed to target primarily Golgi and related organelles. The effects of a minimal effective dose of both colchicine (0.06 mg to 0.12 mg/100 gm body wt) and monensin (0.6 mg/100 gm body wt) were examined in the isolated perfused rat liver in a single-pass mode. The nonbile salt cholephile, phenol red, was studied at two doses: 1 nmol and 5 mumol. Sodium taurocholate was studied at three doses: 2 nmol, 1 mumol and 5 mumol. Colchicine affected the transcellular transport for both classes of organic anions equally. Partially inhibitory effects on both anions occurred only at high ligand flux rates. In contrast, monensin greatly impaired the transport of nonbile salt cholephiles but had no influence on transcellular bile salt flux. We conclude that the monensin effect appears to define a distinct transcellular transport pathway for each of the two classes of organic anions.\r"

  ".W": "It has been proposed that a microtubule-dependent transport of vesicles derived from the Golgi apparatus may play a role in biliary secretion of bile salts and other cholephilic anions. To test this hypothesis, we examined the influence of colchicine and vinblastine, two microtubule inhibitors, on diethylmaleate-induced bile flow and on the biliary secretion of diethylmaleate, an organic anion whose glutathione conjugates may be secreted into bile through the Golgi apparatus and Golgi-derived vesicles. Rats were pretreated with colchicine or vinblastine, and diethylmaleate was injected intraperitoneally at doses of 28 to 400 mumol/100 gm body wt. Basal bile flow was unaffected by colchicine or vinblastine. In contrast, diethylmaleate-induced bile flow and the secretion into bile of diethylmaleate conjugates (estimated by the cation-anion gap in bile) were significantly lower in colchicine-treated and vinblastine-treated animals than in controls. Diethylmaleate-induced bile flow was reduced in proportion to diethylmaleate conjugate secretion. A linear relationship was seen between bile flow and biliary output of diethylmaleate conjugates: this relationship was similar in colchicine-treated or vinblastine-treated animals and in controls. At electron microscopy, diethylmaleate had induced distension of the Golgi saccules of the hepatocytes. In conclusion, colchicine and vinblastine inhibited the secretion into bile of diethylmaleate conjugates and diethylmaleate-induced bile flow. These results support the view that microtubule-dependent transport of Golgi-derived vesicles is involved in the biliary secretion of diethylmaleate and, perhaps, other cholephilic organic anions.\r"

To reassess this we used recombinant human C-peptide to measure C-peptide clearance in cirrhotic patients and controls and thus derive C-peptide and insulin secretion rates after a 75-gm oral glucose load and during a 10 mmol/L hyperglycemic clamp. Cirrhotic patients were confirmed as insulin-insensitive during a euglycemic clamp (glucose requirement: 4.1 +/- 0.1 mg/kg/min vs. 8.1 +/- 0.5 mg/kg/min; p less than 0.001), which also demonstrated a low insulin metabolic clearance rate (p less than 0.001). Although intolerant after oral glucose, the cirrhotic patients had glucose requirements identical to those of controls during the hyperglycemic clamp (cirrhotic patients: 6.1 +/- 1.0 mg/kg/min; controls: 6.3 +/- 0.7 mg/kg/min), suggesting normal intravenous glucose tolerance. C-peptide MCR was identical in cirrhotic patients (2.93 +/- 0.16 ml/min/kg) and controls (2.96 +/- 0.24 ml/min/kg). Insulin secretion was higher in cirrhotic patients, both fasting (2.13 +/- 0.26 U/hr vs. 1.09 +/- 0.10 U/hr; p less than 0.001) and from min 30 to 90 of the hyperglycemic clamp (5.22 +/- 0.70 U/hr vs. 2.85 +/- 0.22 U/hr; p less than 0.001). However, with oral glucose the rise in serum C-peptide concentration was relatively delayed, and the insulin secretion index (secretion/area under 3-hr glucose curve) was not elevated. Hepatic insulin extraction was reduced both in fasting and during the hyperglycemic clamp (p less than 0.001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Clinical features, bacteriological data and outcome in 22 cirrhotic patients with asymptomatic bacterascites are reported and are compared with those of a group of 36 cirrhotic patients with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. Eleven patients had gram-negative bacteria and 11 had one gram-positive bacteria. Only in three patients (13.6%) did peritonitis develop. Twelve patients received no antibiotic therapy, and in none did peritonitis develop. At 1 month, 27% of patients with asymptomatic bacterascites had died. Patients with asymptomatic bacterascites had less-severe liver disease; they more frequently had gram-positive bacteria in ascitic fluid and had a lower 1-mo mortality rate than did patients with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. We conclude that asymptomatic bacterascites is usually the transient residence of bacteria in ascitic fluid.

  ".W": "Immunological factors are important in the pathogenesis of a spectrum of hepatobiliary diseases. To characterize the nature of specific immunological responses in liver disease, we determined lymphocyte changes in liver tissue and in blood using flow cytometry. A total of 113 liver biopsy specimens was collected from patients with the following diseases: 19 chronic hepatitis B; 39 chronic non-A, non-B hepatitis; 27 alcoholic liver disease; 10 hepatic malignancy; 8 autoimmune hepatitis; 6 fatty liver and 4 primary biliary cirrhosis. The lymphocytes were isolated from the liver biopsy specimens by mechanical and enzymatic methods. The lymphocyte yield was 7,901 +/- 575 cells/mg of liver tissue. The viability of lymphocytes was 97.7% +/- 0.3%. Lymphocytes were stained with four pairs of two-color mixed fluorescein-conjugated monoclonal antibodies, including T4-T8 (CD4/CD8), T11-B1 (CD2-CD20), NKH1-T8 (CD56-CD8), IL-2R1-T11 (CD25-CD2), and the ratios were determined by an Epics Profile flow cytometer. Immunophenotyping of lymphocytes in whole blood samples was simultaneously analyzed. Variability in lymphocyte yield and different patterns of lymphocyte subsets were found in the liver biopsy specimens. The yields of lymphocytes from patients with chronic non-A, non-B and autoimmune hepatitis were highest, and the lowest yield was from patients with fatty liver. Patients with primary biliary cirrhosis, fatty liver and hepatic malignancy had relatively high ratios of CD4/CD8, CD56/CD8 and CD25/CD2; whereas patients with chronic hepatitis B, autoimmune hepatitis and non-A, non-B hepatitis had lower ratios of CD4/CD8, CD56/CD8 and CD25/CD2. No difference in lymphocyte ratios between the patients with cirrhotic and noncirrhotic alcoholic liver disease was found.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

A modified procedure using a silicone elastomer catheter as a stent for the biliary-enteric anastomosis resulted in biliary obstruction within 3 wk after surgery. Our experimental bile duct implantation technique is a simple and useful experimental method for the investigation of chronic biliary diversion and biliary physiology. Additionally, it can be performed safely and easily in a rodent model without sophisticated microscopic techniques.\r"

  ".W": "To examine the distribution of intrasplenically transplanted hepatocytes, we used HBsAg-producing G7 HBV transgenic hepatocytes or cells labeled with 111In. Most hepatocytes translocated to the liver (55% +/- 7%; mean +/- S.D.); the spleen retained a smaller fraction (15% +/- 3%); and some transplanted cells localized in lungs (3%) or pancreas (1%). Transplanted hepatocytes were rapidly assimilated into the liver lobule. Morphometrical quantitation indicated that the numbers of transplanted hepatocytes in the liver at 48 hr and at 9 mo after transplantation were similar. Serum HBsAg was detected in recipients of the G7 HBV hepatocytes during the 1-yr experiment. These results indicate that a large number of hepatocytes can be reproducibly delivered to the liver by transplantation into the spleen. Transplanted hepatocytes engraft rapidly, assimilate into host liver, maintain normal function and survive permanently. Systems for safe delivery and localization of hepatocytes in the liver represent a critical step toward successfully accomplishing hepatocyte-directed gene therapy and repopulation of the acutely devastated liver.\r"

  ".W": "The purposes of this study were to determine the pH dependence of lethal endothelial cell injury during oxidative stress and the pH dependence of those cellular mechanisms proposed to result in endothelial cell killing. Oxidative stress was produced in rat liver sinusoidal endothelial cells with H2O2 (5 mmol/L). Cell survival was dependent on the extracellular pH. Indeed, after 180 min of incubation with H2O2, cell survival was only 27% at pH 7.4, 45% at pH 6.8 (p less than 0.05) and 62% at pH 6.4 (p less than 0.05). Despite improved cell survival at pH 6.4 compared with pH 7.4, the magnitude of ATP hydrolysis and glutathione depletion was similar. In contrast to cell survival, lipid peroxidation as measured by malondialdehyde generation was increased twofold at pH 6.4 compared with pH 7.4. A rapid and profound loss of the mitochondrial membrane potential occurred during oxidative stress at pH 7.4 that was delayed at pH 6.4 (0.3% vs. 20% of the initial value at 30 min, p less than 0.0001). After 60 min of incubation with H2O2, NAD(P)H oxidation was greater at pH 7.4 than at pH 6.4 (100% vs. 64%, p less than 0.05). The results indicate that the protective effect of acidosis against cell death during oxidative stress is associated with the inhibition of NAD(P)H oxidation and delayed loss of the mitochondrial membrane potential. Acidosis appears to maintain organelle and cell integrity during oxidative stress by influencing the redox status of NAD(P)H.\r"

  ".U": "91293715\r", 
  ".W": "The effect of two hydrophilic bile acids, murideoxycholic acid (3 alpha,6 beta-dihydroxy-5 beta-cholanoic acid) and ursodeoxycholic acid, on cholesterol and bile acid metabolism and hepatic pathology and gallstone composition was studied in the prairie dog. Cholesterol gallstones were induced by feeding a diet containing 1.2% cholesterol for 75 days. The animals were divided into six groups, and gallstone regression was studied as follows: groups 2 and 5, chow plus 0.2% cholesterol; groups 3 and 6, chow plus 0.2% cholesterol plus 0.15% ursodeoxycholic acid; groups 4 and 7, chow plus 0.2% cholesterol plus 0.15% murideoxycholic acid. Animals in groups 2 to 4 were killed after an additional 6 wk; animals in groups 5 to 7 were killed after an additional 12 wk. Gallstone dissolution did not occur in any group. The gallstones in groups 2, 3, 5 and 6 were typical cholesterol aggregates, as determined by polarized light microscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectrometry. The gallstones of the murideoxycholic acid group were large, solitary, dark stones that appeared radiopaque under 22 kVp x-ray examination. Scanning electron microscopy showed that in these stones the cholesterol crystals had been replaced by an amorphous material, both within the stone and on the stone surface. Chemical analysis indicated that at the end of 12 wk the calcium/sodium salt of the taurine conjugate of murideoxycholic acid (murideoxycholyl taurine) comprised 70% of the stones; protein, cholesterol and small amounts of other bile salts were also present. In vitro studies confirmed the insolubility of the sodium and calcium salts of murideoxycholyl taurine. These studies indicate that the hydrophilic bile acids, murideoxycholic acid and ursodeoxycholic acid, did not achieve gallstone dissolution under the conditions used. In the animals fed murideoxycholic acid, an insoluble calcium salt of murideoxycholyl taurine replaced cholesterol as the major constituent of gallbladder stones. This is the first example of an insoluble dihydroxy taurine-conjugated bile acid; administration of the unconjugated bile acid induced precipitation of a kind of gallstone not previously reported. The final result was transformation of cholesterol stones to bile salt stones.\r"

Nineteen woodchucks chronically infected with woodchuck hepatitis virus were treated with adenine arabinoside monophosphate or acyclovir monophosphate, either free or conjugated with the liver-targeting molecule lactosaminated human serum albumin. Circulating woodchuck hepatitis virus DNA levels remained unchanged in untreated animals and in those receiving the carrier lactosaminated human serum albumin alone; in contrast, they were consistently lower after 5 days of treatment with the antiviral drugs. Free and conjugated adenine arabinoside monophosphate were active at doses of 10 and 0.75 mg/kg, respectively, and free and coupled ACVMP were active at doses of 20 and 2.6 mg/kg, respectively. These results indicate that the dosages of adenine arabinoside monophosphate and acyclovir monophosphate required to inhibit hepadnavirus growth can be sharply reduced by coupling the drugs to lactosaminated human serum albumin.\r"

  ".U": "91293717\r", 
  ".W": "One drawback to using perfluorochemical emulsions as blood substitutes is that perfluorochemical particles are cleared from the blood by the reticuloendothelial system, primarily liver and spleen. We measured the impact of two perfluorochemical emulsions on clearance of colloidal carbon (less than 1 microns) and 51Cr-sheep red blood cells (about 8 microns) by the reticuloendothelial system in vivo and in the isolated perfused liver. Male rats were injected with 2 ml/100 gm body wt of Fluosol-DA or Oxypherol-ET for 4 consecutive days. Carbon (1 ml/100 gm body wt) or sheep red blood cells (0.05 ml of 5% vol/vol/100 gm body wt) were then injected intravenously (in vivo) or added to perfusate. Samples were taken at several time points for 1 hr. In the isolated perfused liver, carbon clearance was depressed by 25% 1 day after treatment. Rates returned to control levels by 12 days in Fluosol-DA-treated rats but remained depressed by 67% in Oxypherol-ET-treated rats. Sheep red blood cell (8 microns) clearance was two to five times slower than carbon clearance and depressed by 40% in livers from Fluosol-DA rats 1 day and 12 days after treatment. Added serum did not improve phagocytosis. In vivo carbon clearance remained normal in Fluosol-DA-treated rats but decreased by 74% in Oxypherol-ET-treated rats 1 day after treatment, returning to normal by 12 days. Clearance rates were similar in control rats in vivo and in the perfused liver. We conclude that the isolated perfused liver is a good model to measure liver clearance function. Although low doses of perfluorochemical emulsions may depress Kupffer cell phagocytosis, general reticuloendothelial system function is not significantly compromised.\r"

  ".W": "During a recent study using isolated perfused rat liver, we concluded that the effects of vasopressin on biliary excretion of several anionic and cationic cholephilic probes could best be explained by passive diffusion of these probes through a paracellular pathway with permeability increased by vasopressin. Replication of the results of that study in an in vitro dialysis system would support the passive nature of the selective efflux of these cholephilic probes from the rat biliary tree and render metabolic events an unlikely explanation for the biliary excretory patterns of the probes. We studied biliary excretion of two bile acids-taurodehydrocholate and taurocholate-and two cholephilic cations-propidium and tributyl-methylammonium-perfused single-pass through the isolated rat liver. We collected bile and measured probe output before and during infusion of 10(-8) mol/L vasopressin. We also studied rates of diffusion of these probes in artificial solution and in whole rat bile through a 3,500 mol wt cut-off cellulose dialysis membrane. The relative order of probe efflux rates from the biliary tree with vasopressin administration paralleled their diffusion rates through the dialysis membrane. The only exception was that the biliary tree manifested charge selectivity. The data are compatible with the passive efflux of probe from the biliary tree, and metabolic events need not be invoked to explain their pattern of biliary excretion with vasopressin administration.\r"

  ".W": "In a previous report we showed that cholestasis in diabetic rats is due in part to hyperglycemia. To gain information about the mechanism responsible for this phenomenon, bile flow was studied in isolated perfused rat livers. The perfusion media were modified erythrocyte-free Krebs-Henseleit solutions. Under these experimental conditions, no cholestasis was observed in isolated rat livers obtained from rats treated with streptozotocin (6 mg/100 gm body wt) 6 days before the experiments. We then proceeded to use normal animals. The composition of the perfusion media was modified to maintain the osmolality even after increasing D-glucose concentrations from 0 to 35 mmol/L. Bile flow was not affected with doses up to 15 mmol/L D-glucose. Beyond a threshold value for plasma D-glucose concentrations between 15 and 20 mmol/L, cholestasis was observed. Using D-glucose analogs such as L-glucose and 3-O-methyl-D-glucose, bile flow was also reduced (by 0.54 and 0.53 microliters/min/gm liver, respectively). Isosmotic sucrose-containing perfusion media were also observed to impair bile flow (by 0.66 microliters/min/gm liver). However, i-erythritol and D-mannitol failed to inhibit bile formation. The study of bile/plasma concentration ratios determined using tracer amounts of radioactive sugars indicated that this value was much lower for cholestatic sucrose (0.11) and L-glucose (0.31) than for noncholestatic i-erythritol (0.99) and D-mannitol (0.98). Cholestasis was partly reversed after induction by 35 mmol/L D-glucose if perfusion media were replaced by sugar-free ones, but also by media containing 25 mmol/L D-glucose. Insulin given during the perfusion with sugar-free media was observed to have no effect on bile flow.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The high molecular weight IgM form (19 S) was predominantly detected in acute hepatitis delta virus cases, whereas the low molecular weight (7 S) form was found in chronic hepatitis delta virus cases. The serological profile of these two forms of IgM antibody to hepatitis delta virus was investigated in serial samples from five patients with acute hepatitis delta virus superinfection that evolved to chronic hepatitis delta virus. We found that, in the acute stage of the disease, the 19 S form was predominant, whereas 6 mo later a predominance of 7-8 S IgM was observed. These results suggest that IgM antibody to hepatitis delta virus antibody forms are different in acute and chronic hepatitis delta virus infection and that their detection only helps in differentiating an acute infection from a chronic infection but not a hepatitis delta virus-hepatitis B virus-HBV coinfection from hepatitis delta virus superinfection in the acute stage of the disease.\r"

These tissues were also stained for the HBsAg and HBcAg by the peroxidase-anti-peroxidase method. Among patients with chronic hepatitis, 86% were HBsAg positive in liver cells, 60% were surface antigen positive and 32% were core antigen positive. Among patients with cirrhosis, 97% were HBsAg positive in liver cells, 72% were surface antigen positive and 17% were positive for core antigen. Staining specificity was demonstrated, in part, by using preimmune sera in the place of primary antibody, by blocking of the primary antibody with the appropriate antigen before assay and by testing uninfected liver controls. The persistence and high frequency of HBxAg in liver cells from patients with chronic liver disease suggest that it may play one or more important roles in the pathogenesis of chronic infection. It is possible that detection of HBxAg in the liver could be an additional new diagnostic marker for hepatitis B virus infection. However, the function(s) of HBxAg in the pathogenesis of the chronic liver disease, if any, remains to be explained.\r"

The specific binding curves generated were analyzed according to the method of Scatchard to determine cell surface receptor numbers and dissociation constants. A single class of cell surface tumor necrosis factor-alpha receptor was demonstrated on peripheral blood mononuclear cells and mononuclear subsets. The median number (range) of cell surface tumor necrosis factor-alpha receptors on peripheral blood mononuclear cells from controls (n = 11), chronic hepatitis B virus patients seropositive for hepatitis B virus DNA (n = 8) and seronegative for hepatitis B virus DNA (n = 8) were 2,329 (range = 1,538 to 3,133), 3,375 (range = 2,300 to 6,718) (p less than 0.01) and 3,113 (range = 2,229 to 5,246) (p less than 0.05) sites/cell, respectively. They all had similar dissociation constants of 8.4 x 10(-10) mol/L (range = 4.1 to 16.9), respectively. Further dissection of the peripheral blood mononuclear cells showed that this increase in cell surface receptor number was confined to the monocyte fraction (p less than 0.01). Plasma tumor necrosis factor-alpha levels in five patients with increased monocyte cell surface tumor necrosis factor-alpha receptor numbers were also elevated.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Chronic hepatitis B virus infection is a major medical problem worldwide. Apart from HBsAg carriers, hepatitis B virus has also been identified in some HBsAg-individuals with or without antibodies to viral antigens. The molecular mechanisms underlying hepatitis B virus persistence in HBsAg-individuals are unresolved, however. To identify a possible genetic basis for viral persistence, we cloned the viral genome from the liver of a patient serologically immune to hepatitis B virus infection. DNA sequence analysis of the complete viral genome identified numerous mutations in all viral genes. Analysis of the biological effects of these mutations revealed three major findings: a low level of HBsAg synthesis, absence of HBeAg production and a defect terminating viral replication. These data suggest that mutations accumulating during the natural course of hepatitis B virus infection may be a mechanism underlying viral persistence in HBsAg-individuals, presumably through escape from immune surveillance.\r"

  ".W": "We assessed the prevalence and clinical significance of antibodies to hepatitis C virus among a cohort of 148 patients with chronic hepatitis B virus infection. Sixteen patients (11%) had anti-hepatitis C virus detectable by enzyme-linked immunoassay. The results from eight of these patients were positive by recombinant immunoblot assay. The results of recombinant immunoblot assay testing were not consistent; therefore the analysis of the patients' data was based on anti-hepatitis C virus enzyme-linked immunoassay results. Patients with chronic hepatitis B with anti-hepatitis C virus were more likely to be cirrhotic (44% vs. 21%) and to have decompensated liver disease (24% vs. 6%). Hepatitis B virus replication appeared to be suppressed in patients with both infections as measured by hepatitis B virus-associated DNA polymerase activity (mean = 2,055 vs. 2,555 cpm). Human immunodeficiency virus infection was more common in the anti-hepatitis C virus positive group (36% vs. 11%). Thus hepatitis C virus appears to suppress hepatitis B virus replication and to cause more severe liver disease in patients with chronic hepatitis B infection.\r"

  ".U": "91293734\r", 
  ".W": "Serum alpha-fetoprotein level is often elevated in patients with chronic liver disease and patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. One of the most difficult problems frequently encountered in practice is differentiating hepatocellular carcinoma from chronic liver disease. This study investigated the specificity and predictive value positive of serum alpha-fetoprotein at various levels in the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma, using 54 patients with histologically proven hepatocellular carcinoma and 200 patients with chronic liver disease (40 patients with chronic active hepatitis and 160 patients with cirrhosis) as nontumor controls. Among 254 patients, 170 (66.9%) were HBsAg+. A wide range of overlap (from 0 to 6,400 ng/ml) in the distribution of serum alpha-fetoprotein levels between hepatocellular carcinoma and chronic liver disease patients was observed mainly among HBsAg+ patients. In contrast, the overlapping range of serum alpha-fetoprotein levels between HBsAg- patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and chronic liver disease was remarkably narrow (from 0 to 200 ng/ml). Therefore the specificity and predictive value positive of alpha-fetoprotein at a given level were significantly lower in HBsAg+ than in HBsAg- patients, especially when alpha-fetoprotein was between 25 and 200 ng/ml. The specificities of alpha-fetoprotein at 200 ng/ml and 400 ng/ml in HBsAg+ patients were 79.8% and 91.5%, respectively, whereas these specificities were both 100% in HBsAg- patients. The predictive values positive at 200 ng/ml and 400 ng/ml in HBsAg+ patients were 53.6% and 72.5%, respectively, in contrast to 100% at both levels in HBsAg- patients. The serum alpha-fetoprotein level, which showed a predictive value positive of 95% in HBsAg+ hepatocellular carcinoma patients, was 3,200 ng/ml, whereas that in HBsAg- hepatocellular carcinoma patients, was 200 ng/ml. We conclude that serum HBsAg status should be considered when serum alpha-fetoprotein is measured as an independent test to diagnose hepatocellular carcinoma, and suggest that regular serum alpha-fetoprotein determination may be more useful in HBsAg- patients with chronic liver disease for the early diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma than in HBsAg+ patients.\r"

  ".W": "To clone and characterize hepatitis C virus strains present in Taiwan, RNA was extracted from liver tissue collected from a patient during the acute phase of posttransfusion non-A, non-B hepatitis. RNA was then subjected to complementary DNA synthesis and the polymerase chain reaction, using primers derived from the original nucleotide sequence of the United States hepatitis C virus strain. A complementary DNA clone, HCV-T3, containing 552 base pairs of hepatitis C virus complementary DNA sequences was isolated and characterized. The homologies in nucleotide sequence between the Taiwan isolate and either the United States or Japan isolate were 80.1% and 91.5%, respectively. However, most of the nucleotide changes occurred in the third base positions, resulting in much higher homologies in amino acid sequence of 91.8% and 97.3%, respectively. Amplification of the less conserved region of hepatitis C virus genome with the polymerase chain reaction was improved by use of primers with nucleotides matched to the local strain. Finally, in addition to the liver and serum, the viral genome was also demonstrated in the spleen tissue by similar methods, suggesting another possible target for hepatitis C viral infection. These findings indicate that there is considerable heterogeneity in hepatitis C virus genomes isolated from different areas of the world.\r"

For this purpose, the fluorescent phospholipid analog 1,1'-dioctadecyl-3,3,3',3'-tetramethyl indocarbocyanine perchlorate was used to label the lipoproteins. The involvement of both parenchymal and nonparenchymal cells in the uptake of 1,1'-dioctadecyl-3,3,3',3'-tetramethyl indocarbocyanine perchlorate-labeled low density lipoprotein and acetylated low density lipoprotein was studied using in vitro perfusion of human liver tissue blocks. In addition, primary hepatocyte cultures were used to visualize the interaction with 1,1'-dioctadecyl-3,3,3',3'-tetramethyl indocarbocyanine perchlorate-labeled apolipoprotein E-free high density lipoprotein and (modified) low density lipoprotein. 1,1'-dioctadecyl-3,3,3',3'-tetramethyl indocarbocyanine perchlorate-low density lipoprotein showed a time-dependent and concentration-dependent interaction with both hepatocytes and Kupffer cells, although the intensity of the interaction with parenchymal cells varied strongly among the liver donors. Uptake of 1,1'-dioctadecyl-3,3,3',3'-tetramethyl indocarbocyanine perchlorate-low density lipoprotein by both cell types was strongly inhibited by the presence of excess unlabeled low density lipoprotein in the (perfusion) medium. Methylation and hydroxyacetaldehyde treatment of low density lipoprotein prevented the uptake of low density lipoprotein. This indicated that the uptake of low density lipoprotein by Kupffer and parenchymal cells was mediated by the low density lipoprotein receptor. 1,1'-dioctadecyl-3,3,3',3'-tetramethyl indocarbocyanine perchlorate-acetylated low density lipoprotein was mainly taken up in situ by liver endothelial cells and by a minor population of Kupffer cells. Polyinosinic acid, a known inhibitor of the scavenger receptor, prevented the uptake by liver endothelial cells. Therefore human liver endothelial cells express active scavenger receptors on their surface. Apolipoprotein E-free 1,1'-dioctadecyl-3,3,3',3'-tetramethyl indocarbocyanine perchlorate-high density lipoprotein was found to be associated with the membrane of cultured liver parenchymal cells but was not taken up intracellularly, indicating a cholesterol exchange process occurring extracellularly at the plasma membrane. The cellular localization of lipoprotein receptors and uptake of the various classes of lipoproteins are comparable with the situation in rats.\r"

  ".W": "Aztreonam and cefotaxime were compared in 44 cirrhotic patients who had 52 episodes of gram-negative spontaneous peritonitis. Patients were randomized into two therapeutic groups of similar characteristics. Group A (28 episodes) received 0.5 gm of aztreonam every 8 hr, and group B (24 episodes) received 1 gm of cefotaxime every 6 hr, for a planned 14-day period. Peak and trough serum and ascitic fluid levels of both antibiotics were several times higher than the minimum inhibitory concentrations of causative microorganisms. Eleven patients (21%) died within the first 48 hr after beginning therapy, which included seven in the aztreonam group and four in the cefotaxime group. In the remaining patients, signs and symptoms of infection were promptly controlled, and ascitic fluid cultures became negative after 48 hr in all cases, except in one patient from the aztreonam group, who was a clinical failure. Two patients from the aztreonam group and one from the cefotaxime group relapsed after treatment. The overall mortality rate was 50%, which was lower than classically reported: 12 patients (43%) died in the aztreonam group, and 14 (58%) died in the cefotaxime group (p = 0.265, NS). Hepatorenal syndrome and digestive tract hemorrhage were the most frequent causes of death occurring after the first 48 hr of treatment. Streptococcal superinfections developed in three patients (14.2%) in the aztreonam group. We conclude that both antibiotics at the low doses used in this study are similarly well tolerated and effective in controlling this infection. Because the use of aztreonam as the initial empirical treatment requires a concomitant antibiotic against gram-positive infections and the possibility of streptococcal superinfections, cefotaxime seems to be a more advantageous therapeutic alternative for this patient population.\r"

There was an increase in cases in the second half of the decade, attributable to the start of a liver transplantation programme. Liver transplant recipients and patients with haematological malignancies were at significantly greater risk of acquiring aspergillosis than kidney transplant recipients or those with solid malignancies treated with chemotherapy. There was also a greater risk of haematogenous dissemination in liver transplant recipients than in all other groups, and this was significantly associated with the use of high dose steroids as anti-rejection treatment. Aspergillus was isolated during life in only eight cases, which indicates a continuing need for and emphasises the value of necropsy.\r"

These strains were tested for cytopathic effects in Vero cells; B pumilus and B cereus strains were also examined for haemolytic activity, lecithinase production, and proteolytic action on casein. Rounding and clumping of the Vero cells occurred after the addition of supernatants prepared from B pumilus and B cereus strains; finger-like projections developed in the cells treated with B pumilus supernatants. Minimal effects occurred with B subtilis and E agglomerans. After two hours of exposure B pumilus (M11) produced the greatest effect, but treatment with trypan blue showed that most cells exposed to the M11 strain were still alive after 96 hours of exposure; those exposed to the supernatant prepared from the M38 strain of B pumilus were dead. Sheep erythrocytes were lysed more rapidly by B cereus than by B pumilus, B cereus (strongly positive) had a greater effect on lecithin than either of the B pumilus strains (M38 weakly positive, M11 negative). All hydrolised casein but the effect was more rapid with one of the B pumilus (M11) strains. It is concluded that not only do the toxins of B pumilus differ from those of B cereus, but there are also differences between the toxins produced by the two strains of B pumilus (M11 and M38).\r"

Two children died from acute splenic sequestration and a third died from fulminant pneumococcal septicaemia: none was taking prophylactic penicillin. Acute chest syndrome was the cause of death in eight young adults and one child. Three deaths occurred after surgery. Cerebrovascular accidents contributed to the cause of death in three cases and there were two sudden unexplained deaths. Ten of the deaths occurred at home or within 24 hours of admission to hospital. Post mortem examinations were made in 14 cases, but the histological appearances of acute chest syndrome were often not recognised. In most cases for whom information was available, the cause of death (chest syndrome, pneumococcal sepsis, postoperative complications) could have been prevented.\r"

One girl developed early organ failure which was not prevented by standard chelation treatment. The combination of modest iron burden and putative intrinsic mitochondrial dysfunction could have accounted for the clinical picture. The other girl remained well, receiving regular transfusion and standard chelation treatment. She had normal liver function and no other evidence of organ damage. The syndrome is unlikely to be due to extreme lyonisation in carriers of the usual X-linked condition. The contrasting clinical patterns seen in these two patients suggest that transfusion dependent congenital sideroblastic anaemia may comprise a heterogeneous group of disorders. It is suggested that such children be carefully monitored for evidence of increasing iron overload so that organ damage can be prevented.\r"

  ".W": "Immunohistochemical staining for parathyroid hormone-related protein was performed in 27 tumours from 19 normocalcaemic and eight hypercalcaemic patients with cancer. All the tumours from hypercalcaemic patients stained positively for the protein, as did 17 tumours from normocalcaemic patients. Only hypercalcaemic patients had biochemical evidence of increased bone resorption and abnormalities of renal tubular reabsorption of calcium and phosphate, consistent with the presence of parathyroid hormone-related protein. While tumour mass was higher in hypercalcaemic patients, only one of the initially normocalcaemic patients with positively staining tumours subsequently went on to develop hypercalcaemia and more advanced disease. These data confirm the importance of parathyroid hormone-related protein as a mediator of humoral hypercalcaemia in patients with solid tumours and suggest that low tumour mass may be one reason why serum calcium values are not increased in all patients with tumours containing parathyroid hormone-related protein. None the less normocalcaemia, despite tumour progression in patients whose tumours stained positively for parathyroid hormone-related protein, suggests that other factors may also be important, such as differences in the rate of secretion of the protein by different tumours, or the production of different forms of parathyroid hormone-related protein with varying biological effects.\r"

The heparin concentration and the incubation time in the assay were optimised specifically to permit the detection of heparin binding defects of antithrombin. The sensitivity of antithrombin assays for the detection of this type of variant was significantly impaired when an incubation time of more than 30 seconds was used. Several commercially available assays recommend a longer incubation time than 30 seconds and therefore some patients with heparin binding defects of antithrombin may not be identified. The assay described here allows heparin binding variants of antithrombin to be identified and distinguished from other types of antithrombin deficiency in a simple two stage procedure.\r"

Serum total ALP activity was increased in nine out of the 41 patients (22%), serum bone ALP activity was increased in 10 (24%), and serum non-bone ALP activity was increased in three (7%). There was no significant difference when the mean of the patients' serum total ALP was compared with that of the controls. Twenty per cent of the patients with increased serum bone ALP had normal serum total ALP, indicating that increased serum bone isoenzyme activity may precede an increase in the total enzyme activity. This should be considered when interpreting results of increased total ALP in epileptic patients.\r"

Frozen cores from 33 staging procedures were tested with UJ13A and UJ127.11. Immunopositive tumour cells were found in 10 of 17 staging procedures in which tumour was detectable by routine histological methods. Positive cells or stromal material were also found in eight of 12 staging procedures in which distorted architecture and fibrosis, but no obvious tumour, had been noted. Paraffin wax embedded cores from 29 of the same staging procedures were tested with antibodies against neurone specific enolase and neurofilament. Only a single core reacted with anti-neurofilament antibody. Neurone specific enolase positive cells or stromal material were found in nine of 15 staging procedures in which obvious tumour was detectable. Although these immunohistochemical techniques proved inferior to routine histology in their ability to detect obvious tumour, the demonstration of immunopositive stromal tissue which was not frankly malignant supports the view that distorted, fibrotic marrow may reflect persistence of neuroectodermal tissue and justifies its distinction from normal marrow when reporting the response to treatment.\r"

The method uses a repeated sequence of the EBV genome as a probe, labelled with the novel reporter molecule, digoxigenin. The method can identify individual copies of EBV by detection of both EBV DNA and highly localised RNA transcripts. A combination of careful proteolytic digestion of tissue sections, high temperature denaturation of probe and target DNA, and sensitive immunocytochemical detection are used to attain single copy sensitivity. The technique is quicker and simpler to perform than some other methods used for the identification of EBV, and provides simultaneous morphological information which cannot be obtained by methods using tissue extracts. This method permits the investigation of the role of EBV in neoplastic conditions of lymphoid and epithelial cells, and may prove valuable in determining the sites of latent virus in healthy subjects.\r"

The most appropriate measure of specimen report time for histopathology was assessed. The simplest method is to calculate the mean or median number of days from receipt of specimens to issue of report, but this takes no account of clinical practice. An alternative approach is to compare the laboratory's performance with the clinicians' requirements. Clinicians were invited to complete a questionnaire specifying the reporting times they required subdivided by tissue type, clinical suspicion of malignancy, and bed occupancy of the patient. The questionnaire showed that there were distinct differences in clinicians' requirements. The turnround time for each category of specimen was calculated and expressed in three ways. The traditional method of quoting a median value showed very few differences among the categories. A comparison of the department's performance with the clinicians' requirements, using an arbitrary cut-off point of satisfying at least 80% of the clinicians' most stringent requirements or an achievement index, however, provided useful information for refining laboratory priorities.\r"

Eleven showed the histological features of giant cell arteritis and six showed no evidence of arteritis. All were examined for the expression of LFA-3, ICAM-1 and its receptor LFA-1, and HLA-DR. Temporal arteries with early features of arteritis, as well as histologically unaffected skip areas, showed a regional induction of ICAM-1 expression, but not HLA-DR, on smooth muscle cells of the media. ICAM-1 expression was detected in areas where a clinically important mononuclear cell infiltrate had not yet developed. In more florid cases of giant cell arteritis there was an additional widespread induction of ICAM-1 expression on intimal myofibroblasts. Strong expression of ICAM-1, HLA-DR, and LFA-3 was found on macrophages, epithelioid cells, and giant cells comprising the granulomatous lesion. The pattern of expression of these adhesion molecules suggests that they have a role in leucocyte traffic into the vascular lesion as well as in mediating the intercellular interactions which constitute the granulomatous response.\r"

Its design overcomes many of the limitations of existing expert system technologies when applied to breast disease. In particular, the system can quickly focus on a differential problem and thus reduce the amount of data necessary to reach a conclusion. The system was tested on two sets of samples, consisting of 14 retrospective cases and five hypothetical cases of breast disease. Its recommendations were judged \"correct\" by the evaluating pathologist in 15 cases. This study shows the feasibility of providing \"decision support\" in histopathology.\r"

There was some overlap between adenomas and carcinomas, however, when the mean of the 10 largest values of the major nucleolar diameter was considered. In follicular carcinoma the percentage of marginated nucleoli--that is, those touching the nuclear membrane--was, in general, greater than 20%; in adenoma the values were equal to or lower than 16%. The overlap index showed that the percentages of marginated nucleoli and nucleolated nuclei are the two best discriminatory features between adenoma and carcinoma.\r"

This previously unreported association suggests that leptospira may induce vascular endothelial injury in severe cases and expose crypt antigens or induce conformational change of cell surface phospholipids. Leptospirosis may provide a model for an infective origin of some cases of the antiphospholipid syndrome.\r"

The sensitivity of this procedure is sufficient to show virus in most acute phase sera, and is equal to that of the antigen capture enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The immunoelectron microscopy fluid technique can differentiate among antigenically distinct filoviruses in less than three hours.

  ".U": "91294515\r", 
  ".W": "The regulation of gastrin secretion from antral G-cells is of major importance in the physiologic control of acid secretion. Gastrin secretion is highly dependent upon gastric intraluminal pH and is inhibited significantly by a pH of less than 3.0. Acute gastric alkalinization greater than pH 6.0 with antisecretory agents such as H2-receptor antagonists or H+/K+ ATPase inhibitors has little impact on fasting serum gastrin levels but promotes an enhanced sustained rise in meal-stimulated gastrin release. Courses of standard therapy with both H2-antagonists and H+/K+ inhibitors cause a significant rise in 24 h integrated plasma gastrin levels that is inversely correlated to the 24-h integrated gastric acidity. The rise in fasting or integrated plasma gastrin levels observed in patients treated with H2-antagonists is small and of unclear clinical significance. Therapy with antisecretory agents leads to earlier ulcer relapse than with other agents. A variety of factors have been proposed to explain the earlier ulcer relapse rate, including secondary hypergastrinemia with rebound acid hypersecretion after discontinuation of the drug. Secondary hypergastrinemia may also lead to tolerance to prolonged courses of H2-antagonists therapy with a decrease in acid inhibition. This may contribute to break-through ulcer recurrence during maintenance H2-antagonist therapy. However, the relative importance of hypergastrinemia and tolerance to H2-antagonists compared with other factors such as baseline gastric acid secretion, smoking status, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use, and Helicobacter pylori status is difficult to assess.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We searched the English-language literature for studies of the postoperative mortality after resection of GLH and of the outcome of expectantly treated patients. The results of the data synthesis showed an operative mortality of 1.5% (90% confidence intervals, 0.1-3.0%) and an early surgical morbidity of up to 13%. Mortality among the 37 reported cases with ruptured GLH was 78%. There were no cases of spontaneous or traumatic rupture of unresected GLH during a follow-up of a total of 282 patient years. The main source of ambiguity regarding the management of GLH is the uncertain risk of its rupture. Rough estimates of this risk based on published data suggest that surgical resection is not justified in asymptomatic GLH. Yet, although rare, rupture of GLH does occur with disastrous consequences. Future research may attempt to define patient subsets whose GLHs are at higher risk of rupture, and in whom preventive resection may improve survival.\r"

In the present communication, I hope to shed light on the pathogenesis, investigation, and treatment of these manifestations. The levator ani is the principal muscle of defecation; together with anorectal reflex actions, it conducts the act of defecation. Strainodynia is the term I give to excessive and exhaustive straining at defecation. Band strainodynia has normal stool character but elevated rectal neck pressure due to the presence of a fibrous band in the rectal neck. Diet strainodynia presents with lower stool weight and frequency than normal; the internal anal sphincter is fibrous. The stools in levator strainodynia have been repeatedly obstructed at defecation due to levator dysfunction. Idiopathic oligofecorrhea or infrequent defecation was studied in 146 patients. Three stages could be identified: the deep and the everted intersphincteric groove and the cone anus. Fecoflowmetry is introduced as a new method for investigating anorectal disorders. It measures the defecated volume per time unit, and provides quantitative as well as qualitative data concerning the act of defecation. Changes in the fecal flow parameters or curve configuration from normal point to a defecation disorder.\r"

There were no significant differences in the management of the patients, except for the more frequent use of upper gastrointestinal radiography at hospital 3 and the more frequent use of cimetidine at hospital 2. Only a small percentage (3-7%) of patients required surgery, and overall mortality (0-8%) was low. The average cost of hospitalization, determined by using the New England Medical Center cost model, was calculated for direct costs ($3,180). The majority of costs incurred were for hospital bed or intensive care unit stay (63%) and transfusion of blood products (14%), with costs for physicians' services (9%), endoscopy (2%), and upper gastrointestinal radiography (1%) accounting for only a small percentage. This study demonstrates remarkable similarity in practice patterns and resource utilization at three different hospitals and provides data on the actual costs involved in hospitalization for noncirrhotic, upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage.\r"

The incidence of EGC decreased slightly during consecutive 8-year intervals. There were 16 men and 12 women (mean age 64 and 66 years, respectively). Standard biphasic contrast radiographic studies of the upper gastrointestinal tract diagnosed or suggested malignancy in all but one patient. Endoscopy with directed biopsy diagnosed malignancy in all patients. Twenty-one lesions (67.7%) were localized to the antral region. Type IIc was most frequent (38.7%). There were 21 intestinal-type and 10 diffuse-type EGC by the Lauren classification. The incidence of intestinal-type EGC decreased during two consecutive 8-year periods. All type I and IIa lesions were of the intestinal type, whereas all diffuse-type EGCs were either type IIc or III. Lymph node metastasis was observed in 9.7% of the lesions. The incidence of lymph node metastasis increased from 0% in mucosal cancer to 20% in submucosal cancer. The overall 5-year survival rate was 91.3%: (diffuse type 100% and intestinal type 85.7%).

  ".W": "We assessed the effect of long-lasting inhibition of gastric acid secretion on basal and meal-stimulated serum gastrin and gastric acid secretion in 37 patients on long-term maintenance treatment with H2 antagonists for severe relapsing and/or complicated duodenal ulcer disease. After a mean of 142 weeks (range, 28-324 weeks) of continuous treatment, gastric acid secretion, basal plasma gastrin, and gastrin response to a test meal were evaluated. All tests were performed a week after drug discontinuation to exclude rapidly reversible hypergastrinemia. Gastrin levels were above the normal range in seven patients (18.9%). After H2 antagonist were stopped for 6 weeks, basal gastrin returned to normal levels in all cases [from a median of 180 (range, 130-350) pg/ml to 58 (25-90) pg/ml] and peak meal-stimulated gastrin significantly decreased from a median of 500 pg/ml to 245 pg/ml (p = 0.02). In patients with hypergastrinemia, the discontinuation of H2 antagonists for 6 weeks led to a significant decrease of gastric acid secretion. Patients who developed hypergastrinemia spent more weeks on full-dose treatment and had more recurrences during therapy. The results of the present investigation demonstrate that a long-lasting inhibition of gastric acid secretion can induce, in a small percentage of patients, a reversible sustained hypergastrinemia and a consequent increase of acid secretion, which conceivably could lead to more frequent relapses of duodenal ulcer disease.\r"

With placebo, significantly lower median 24-h pH values were detected in patients with resistant ulcer than in responders (1.13 versus 1.63). On the contrary, no statistical difference was detected between the two groups during any time of day after administration of either ranitidine or famotidine. Within each group, no significant difference was noted between the two different H2-blockers. Thus, our data suggest that patients with resistant duodenal ulcer display an increased gastric acidity in control conditions but a \"normal\" response to administration of antisecretory drugs.\r"

The patients investigated had basal and pentagastrin-stimulated gastric acid hypersecretion, but normal gastric emptying times. Ranitidine brought about a significant improvement of endoscopic and histological features compared with the pretreatment findings. Endoscopic but not histological improvement was significantly better than with placebo. Furthermore, ranitidine brought about a significant reduction of weekly antacid consumption compared with placebo. Both ranitidine and placebo induced significant symptomatic improvement over basal conditions, but the difference between the two treatments did not reach statistical significance. Gastric secretory and motor functions, as well as the response to therapy, were similar in duodenitis patients with and without previous history of duodenal ulcer; the only exception was in antacid consumption, which was higher in the placebo group in those with past evidence of ulcer disease. Our results suggest that duodenitis patients have secretory and motor functions similar to those of duodenal ulcer patients. Therefore, further trials on large populations of duodenitis patients with antisecretory drugs are justified.\r"

Mild abnormalities in the AST and ALT levels were seen in more than 65% of patients. Patients with cirrhosis had significantly greater elevations in AST, ALT, and alkaline phosphatase, and a significant decrease in albumin (p less than 0.05). Proband cases had more frequent abnormalities than discovered cases within families. Accordingly, we find that mild abnormalities in the biochemical liver profile are common in hemochromatosis and suggest that patients with an unexplained abnormality in the liver profile should be screened for hemochromatosis with a serum ferritin and transferrin saturation.\r"

Global endoscopy fees depreciate the nonprocedural aspects of the gastroenterologist's care. In concert with other physician income reduction provisions of the 1989 and 1990 Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Acts, global endoscopy fees will dramatically alter the future behavior of gastroenterologists and their attitude toward Medicare patients. The deadline for writing HCFA has passed, but concerned gastroenterologists should protest this plan at once to their Senators and Congressional Representatives.\r"

  ".W": "Cyclosporine is used widely to prevent transplant rejection. Unfortunately, this drug causes both renal glomerular and tubular damage. To develop a stable reproducible noncatabolic animal model of cyclosporine nephrotoxicity, rats were fed a special liquid diet and daily administered 7.5 mg/kg of cyclosporine intramuscularly. Twenty-one days after this regimen was started, the body weight of cyclosporine-treated rats had increased 15%, a value only 38% less than the increase in pair-fed controls. After 21 days, glomerular filtration rate fell 34% in cyclosporine-treated rats (p less than 0.001) compared with the pair-fed controls. Simultaneously, citrate and N-acetylglucosaminidase excretion increased significantly. When isolated proximal tubules obtained after 21 days from the cyclosporine and pair-fed rats were incubated by using 1.0 mmol/L glutamine and 1.0 mmol/L citrate substrates, ammonia production was reduced 40% and glucose production reduced 20% (p less than 0.001) in the cyclosporine-treated rats. Discontinuing cyclosporine for 7 days partially reversed all these changes. The glomerular filtration rate in cyclosporine-treated rats now was only 15% below that in controls (p less than 0.05), N-acetylglucosaminidase excretion was the same in both groups, and urinary citrate excretion in the cyclosporine-treated rats fell from 122% to 62% above that in controls. In vitro differences in tubular ammonia and glucose production also narrowed. In summary, these experiments describe a stable reproducible noncatabolic and at least partially reversible rat model for studying cyclosporine nephrotoxicity.\r"

  ".W": "The activity of phosphate-dependent glutaminase and glutamine metabolism by tissues known markedly to utilize or synthesize glutamine (or both) were studied in rats made septic by cecal ligation and puncture technique and compared with the same measures in rats that underwent sham operation (laparotomy). Blood glucose level was not markedly different in septic rats, but lactate, pyruvate, alanine, and glutamine levels were markedly increased. Conversely, blood ketone body concentrations were significantly decreased in septic rats. Both plasma insulin and glucagon levels were markedly elevated in response to sepsis. The maximal activity of phosphate-dependent glutaminase was decreased in the small intestine, increased in the kidney and mesenteric lymph nodes, and unchanged in the liver of septic rats. Arteriovenous concentration difference measurements across the gut showed a decrease in the net glutamine removed from the circulation in septic rats. Arteriovenous concentration difference measurements for glutamine showed that both renal uptake and skeletal muscle release of the amino acid were increased in response to sepsis, whereas measurements across the hepatic bed showed a net uptake of glutamine in septic rats. Enterocytes isolated from septic rats exhibited a decreased rate of utilization of glutamine and production of glutamate, alanine, and ammonia, whereas lymphocytes isolated from septic rats showed an enhanced rate of utilization of glutamine and production of glutamate, aspartate, and ammonia. It is concluded that, during sepsis, glutamine uptake and metabolism are enhanced in renal and lymphoid tissue but decreased in that of the small intestine, with increased rates of release by skeletal muscle; however, the liver appears to utilize glutamine in septic rats.\r"

Catecholamine-stimulated ACLase activity was assessed relative to the fine structure of cardiocytes. The most intense ACLase activity was found in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), but activity was also present in the sarcolemma. The enzyme activity was present in a wide morphologic spectrum of components of the SR, including junctional SR of internal and peripheral coupling (12 cases), free SR in association with myofibrils (6 cases), and free SR in association with mitochondria (5 cases). ACLase activity in junctional SR in the human myocardium resembles the findings in hearts of other mammalian species. The enzyme activity in human myocardial SR may represent a local regulatory function of the ACLase-cyclic AMP-phosphodiestrerase system in the SR components.\r"

  ".W": "Deposition of fibrin within the peritoneal cavity is an integral host response to local infection. To directly assess the role of fibrin deposition in the pathogenesis of intraabdominal abscess formation, the ability to induce abscesses in fibrinogen-depleted mice was examined. We hypothesized that systemic defibrinogenation with ancrod would limit the availability of fibrinogen for deposition within the peritoneal cavity and would therefore impair intraabdominal abscess formation. A gelatin capsule containing 50% sterile feces plus Bacteroides fragilis 1 x 10(9) CFU was inserted IP into control or defibrinogenated mice. System defibrinogenation resulted in alteration of the character of abscess formation, as manifested by reduced abscess size and degree of purulence. Abscesses were significantly smaller (0.18 +/- 0.02 gm [n = 29] vs. 0.09 +/- 0.02 gm [n = 11], p less than 0.01) and less purulent (p less than 0.001) in the ancrod-treated mice than in control animals, despite equal numbers of bacteria in the abscesses recovered from both groups. The effect of ancrod was specific for defibrinogenation, because IP repletion with fibrinogen reversed the ancrod effect on abscess size. In addition to its local effects, systemic fibrinogen depletion resulted in a significant elevation in mortality following IP infection (1 of 30 control animals vs. 10 of 23 ancrod-treated animals, p less than 0.01). However, this was not due to an increase in the magnitude of the B. fragilis bacteremia. These studies demonstrate that fibrin deposition contributes to the pathogenesis of purulent abscess formation and that systemic depletion of fibrinogen may alter host susceptibility to the consequences of infection.\r"

  ".W": "Octreotide (Sandostatin), a potent and long-acting octapeptide analogue of somatostatin, exhibits variable metabolic effects in type 1 diabetes. We have postulated that interindividual variability in octreotide metabolism could be responsible in part for the differences in metabolic responses reported in previous clinical studies. To this end, we determined plasma levels and MCR of octreotide during 24-hour continuous SC infusion (low dose, 200 micrograms; high dose, 400 micrograms) in nine female, C peptide-negative patients with type 1 diabetes. The metabolic effects of the analogue were assessed by measuring serum glucose, free insulin, glucagon, GH, and PP levels before and at 1- to 2-hour intervals during each dose of the analogue or control (0.9% saline solution) infusion in a single-blind randomized manner. Mean daytime (0800-0000 hours) and bedtime (0000-0800 hours) serum glucose levels decreased significantly (p less than 0.05 to 0.02) during analogue therapy compared with control. Mean serum free insulin levels were significantly (p less than 0.02) greater during octreotide infusion compared with control, despite the similar daily insulin requirements. Both doses of the analogue effectively suppressed 24-hour GH by 50%, glucagon by 50%, and PP by 80%. Steady-state octreotide levels varied considerably among patients (low, mean +/- SEM), 1000 +/- 101, range 638 to 1375 pg/ml; high, mean 1940 +/- 147, range 1032 to 2462 pg/ml). Although mean MCR values were similar with both doses, we observed greater interindividual variability (low, mean 2.45 +/- 0.30, range 1.31 to 3.78 ml/kg/min; high, mean 2.36 +/- 0.19, range 1.68 to 3.48 ml/kg/min).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In each instance, precordial compression and external defibrillation failed to restore a viable rhythm. ECC was begun at 15 minutes at an average flow rate of 183 ml/kg/min. In each of eight animals, sinus rhythm was restored. In six of these eight animals, spontaneous circulation was reestablished after an average interval of 152 minutes. When epinephrine was administered concomitantly with ECC in an additional eight animals so as to maintain mean aortic pressure between 60 and 100 mm Hg, sinus rhythm and spontaneous circulation were reestablished in each pig after an average of only 23 minutes. The effects of ECC in conjunction with epinephrine were then compared with those of conventional precordial compression in conjunction with epinephrine (sham ECC). In contrast to ECC, which successfully resuscitated each of five animals, none of five sham ECC-treated animals was resuscitated by continued precordial compression and maximal doses of epinephrine (p less than 0.01). We conclude that ECC in conjunction with epinephrine emerges as a highly effective experimental intervention for resuscitation when conventional techniques of precordial compression and external defibrillation fail to reverse cardiac arrest.\r"

  ".W": "To investigate the relative importance of catalase and glutathione in erythrocyte oxidant defense, human and mouse (normal and acatalasemic) erythrocytes were reversibly lysed and resealed in the presence of exogenous catalase or glutathione. This resulted in an increase in intracellular catalase activity or glutathione concentration in the resealed erythrocytes while normal cellular structure, hemoglobin concentration, cell volume, cellular deformability, and adenosine triphosphate concentration were maintained. Resealing alone had no effect on oxidant sensitivity. In human cells, a threefold increase in catalase activity resulted in the maintenance of glutathione levels in response to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) challenge. Reconstitution of congenitally acatalasemic mouse erythrocytes, which were extremely sensitive to even micromolar concentrations of H2O2 with purified catalase resulted in complete protection against H2O2. Indeed, the catalase-reconstituted acatalasemic cells were less sensitive to H2O2-mediated damage than were normal, catalase-replete mouse cells. In contrast, alteration of the glutathione status of human and mouse (normal and acatalasemic) cells had no significant effect on oxidant sensitivity. Even a five-fold increase in intracellular glutathione concentration (greater than 30 micromoles glutathione per gram of hemoglobin) in normal or catalase-deficient (azide-treated or acatalasemic) red blood cells had no protective effect against H2O2-mediated lipid peroxidation or methemoglobin generation. Similarly, depletion of glutathione by 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene also had no effect on erythrocyte H2O2 sensitivity. These results suggest an important role for catalase in protection against H2O2-mediated damage at physiologic levels and that catalase is as at least as important as glutathione in cellular defense against H2O2.\r"

We analyzed whether this could be caused by a lower rate of transport in CAPD when compared with hemodialysis. Mass transfer area coefficients (MTCs) for urea, creatinine, uric acid, and pseudouridine were determined in nine patients undergoing hemodialysis as dialyzer clearances and in 14 patients undergoing CAPD during a 4-hour dwell with 2 L dialysate with glucose, 70 mmol/L. The theoretical MTC of pseudouridine (TPSI), calculated by extrapolation to its molecular weight by use of the MTC of urea, creatinine, and uric acid, was higher than the observed MTC of pseudouridine, both in hemodialysis (136 vs 112 ml/min, p less than 0.025) and in CAPD (6.9 vs 3.4 ml/min, p less than 0.001). The pseudouridine/TPSI MTC ratio was lower during CAPD than during hemodialysis (0.47 vs 0.83, p less than 0.0005), indicating a lower level of transport during CAPD. In vitro experiments with nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy supported the hypothesis of glucose-induced molecular association of pseudouridine. Therefore, dialysate containing 10 mmol/L glucose was compared with that containing 70 mmol/L glucose in eight patients undergoing CAPD. The MTC of pseudouridine was higher during the experiments with dialysate containing 10 mmol/L glucose (3.5 +/- 2.0 ml/min vs 2.7 +/- 1.9 ml/min, p less than 0.05). This was also found for the pseudouridine/TPSI MTC ratio (0.61 vs 0.41, p less than 0.02) and the pseudouridine/creatinine MTC ratio (0.33 vs 0.25, p less than 0.02), favoring glucose-induced decrease of MTC-pseudouridine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The present study was undertaken to determine the effects of high-dose interleukin-2 administration in normal rats. Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with intravenous recombinant interleukin-2 (900,000 IU/kg/day) for 9 consecutive days. Animals were placed in individual metabolic cages, and arterial blood pressure, food intake, body weight, and urine output were monitored. On day 10, animals were killed by exsanguination, various tissues were harvested, and a variety of hematologic and chemical assays were performed. The results were compared with those of placebo-injected normal control and pair-fed groups. The interleukin-2-treated group exhibited anorexia, weight loss, hypotension, anemia, leukocytosis, lymphocytosis, eosinophilia, hypercalcemia, azotemia, and a marked urinary concentration defect. Histologic examination of various tissues revealed widespread infiltration with mono-nuclear cells and eosinophils in most organs, especially in the lungs and liver of interleukin-2-treated animals. Other abnormalities included severe panlobular hepatitis, hepatocellular necrosis, and thymic involution. Renal involvement was mild and consisted of focal interstitial infiltration by mononuclear cells. According to these observations, administration of high-dose interleukin-2 in normal rats results in a score of significant functional, biochemical, and histologic abnormalities.\r"

Mice were fed pulverized chow with cholate, chenodeoxycholate, or ursodeoxycholate, with or without griseofulvin. After 1 to 4 weeks, bile flow, bile acid excretion and composition, biliary protoporphyrin excretion, hepatic protoporphyrin contents, liver histology, and griseofulvin plasma concentrations were determined. Additionally, bile acid absorption was measured. Griseofulvin induced a progressive increase in liver weight, hepatic protoporphyrin content, and histopathologic evidence of cholestasis. Biliary protoporphyrin excretion increased and pigmented gallbladder microliths developed. Bile flow and bile acid excretion fell in relation to liver weight but not in relation to body weight. Cholic acid augmented biliary protoporphyrin excretion, markedly reduced hepatic protoporphyrin content, and obviated the development of intrahepatic biliary thrombi. Ursodeoxycholate and chenodeoxycholate both reduced biliary protoporphyrin excretion. This was associated with bile acid compositional changes, particularly a fall in cholic acid. Although histopathologic abnormalities were not altered, these bile acids reduced hepatic protoporphyrin contents. Bile acid treatments with griseofulvin all increased bile flow and bile acid excretion relative to controls, but differences in the relationship of bile flow to bile acid structure on protoporphyrin disposition. They document biliary excretion as the principal mode of cholic acid amelioration of griseofulvin-induced hepatopathy. They also suggest distinctive roles for griseofulvin and protoporphyrin in the generation of the cholestasis.\r"

We have confirmed reports that preincubation is required for growth hormone-induced lipolysis in isolated fat cells. Isolated fat cells were prepared from the epididymal fat pads of normal and spontaneously diabetic BB Wistar rats (weight, 250-400 gm) and their nondiabetic littermates by collagenase digestion. Lipolysis was measured by glycerol release after sequential perifusion with buffer alone, bovine growth hormone 1 microgram/ml, buffer alone, and epinephrine, 0.5 mumol/L. In each case isolated fat cells from control, nondiabetic, and spontaneously diabetic rats were perifused under two conditions, with and without preincubation with bovine growth hormone. Isolated fat cells from control and nondiabetic rats did not respond to bovine growth hormone without preincubation. When preincubation with bovine growth hormone, response in control rats increased from nonpreincubated glycerol values of 4.9 to 13.5 nmol glycerol released/10(6) cells/min. In contrast to controls, non-preincubated isolated fat cells from spontaneously diabetic rats that were stimulated with 1 microgram/ml bovine growth hormone went from 18.0 to 42.6 nmol of glycerol released/10(6) cells/min. No preincubation was necessary in spontaneously diabetic rats. In addition, in all situations in which preincubation or the diabetic state enhanced lipolysis with growth hormone, similar enhancement was seen with epinephrine. For nondiabetic rats both preincubated and nonpreincubated isolated fat cells respond minimally to bovine growth hormone. In conclusion, preincubation with bovine growth hormone is not required to elicit lipolysis in perifused isolated fat cells from spontaneously diabetic BB rats.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Age, ischaemic heart disease and function group on arrival at the hospital were independent risk factors for death. The main cause of death was ischaemic heart disease in the NVAF group, and complications to the initial stroke or a stroke recurrence in the SR group. Thus a higher risk of death, stroke recurrence and peripheral embolism was evident only during the first month after stroke.\r"

Both snuff-users and smokers showed increased levels of alcohol and coffee consumption and a decreased level of physical exercise compared to non-users. Both groups of tobacco-users showed increased serum insulin levels compared to the control group at similar blood glucose concentrations. In contrast to the smokers, snuff-users showed no significant elevation of diastolic blood pressure, haemoglobin concentrations, white cell count, serum cholesterol or triglyceride levels. Snuff users had higher plasma fibrinogen levels than non-users (P = 0.07). The use of snuff by young men appears to have less impact than smoking on cardiovascular risk factors, with the possible exception of elevated serum insulin and plasma fibrinogen levels.\r"

A significant dose-dependent reduction in serum levels of total and LDL-cholesterol, Apo B and the ratio of total cholesterol to HDL-cholesterol was noted. Improvement in red blood cell filterability and an increase in fibrinogen levels were also observed. We conclude that the hypocholesterolaemic effect of lovastatin in familial hypercholesterolaemia is accompanied by changes in blood rheology. While some of these haemorheological changes may be considered beneficial, others may be regarded as unfavourable. The net effect of lovastatin therapy on the coronary risk of familial hypercholesterolaemic patients warrants further investigation.\r"

  ".W": "The need for treatment of mild and apparently asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism (HPT) is questioned, but a raised incidence of cardiovascular disease has been regarded as evidence in favour of surgery. While it is well known that several risk factors for cardiovascular disease (hypertension, hyperlipidaemia and diabetes mellitus/impaired glucose tolerance) are overrepresented in HPT, it is not known whether surgery provides long-term normalization in these respects and reduces the risk of premature death. In a 15-year follow-up of a cohort of 172 subjects in whom mild hypercalcaemia was initially detected during a health screening, it was found that 56 subjects had died. 17 individuals had been operated on for HPT, 47 individuals were persistently hypercalcaemic, while 45 subjects had serum calcium within the normal range (seven individuals were lost to follow-up). There had been no significant differences in blood pressure between these groups of mildly hypercalcaemic patients and age- and sex-matched controls at the initial screening, but at follow-up blood pressure was significantly higher not only in subjects with persistent hypercalcaemia, but also in those who had been successfully operated on for HPT. Neither of the hypercalcaemic groups showed any significant deviations from the controls with regard to indices of lipid or glucose metabolism. These findings suggest that there is no simple cause-and-effect relationship to account for the propensity toward high blood pressure in primary HPT. Consequently it cannot be assumed that surgery for HPT will eliminate the increased risk of cardiovascular disease in patients with mild HPT.\r"

Three women, aged 51, 53 and 73 years, were taking L-tryptophan for 2 months to 2 years, at 500, 1500, and 2250 mg d-1, respectively. All developed disabling myalgias, fatigue, and a variable skin rash, in association with marked eosinophilia. In one patient, symptoms and eosinophilia reappeared after rechallenge with L-tryptophan. Discontinuation of the drug resulted in gradual disappearance of the symptoms, signs and laboratory abnormalities in two patients. One patient was treated with corticosteroids because of persisting myalgias. Because of the non-specific clinical manifestations, clinicians from all subspecialties of internal medicine might be confronted with such patients and should be aware of this new entity.\r"

Spectrophotofluorometry and ethidium bromide visualization on minigels were used to estimate the quantity and degree of degradation of DNA. The DNA from several blood-bone pairs is shown to give concordant restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) typing results by two different typing protocols with five different single-locus probes. DNA from several additional blood-bone pairs is shown to give concordant results for human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-DQ alpha phenotypes following polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification and hybridization to specific allele-specific oligonucleotide (ASO) probes, and for the variable numbers of tandem repeats (VNTR) length polymorphisms 3' to the human apolipoprotein B (APOB) gene following PCR amplification with specific primers and analysis of the products by electrophoresis and ethidium bromide visualization.\r"

Using the procedure developed, as little as 50 pg of TNT could be detected. Accounting for sample size and dilution, the 50 pg equates to 15 ng of TNT recovered from the hands. Following contact with TNT, amounts ranging from 53 ng to more than 1500 ng were recovered from hands. The monoclonal anti-TNT antibodies showed no cross-reactivity with several other explosives or common contaminants. These preliminary results indicate promise for the development of a simple-to-use, immunoassay-based field test kit for TNT and, ultimately, other explosives.\r"

They consumed either neat whisky in amounts corresponding to 0.34, 0.51, 0.68, 0.85, or 1.02 g of ethanol per kilogram of body weight or 0.80 g/kg ethanol solvent diluted with orange juice. The peak blood-ethanol concentration (BEC) increased with the dose administered, but the time required to reach the peak was not markedly influenced over the range of doses studied. At a dose of 0.68 g/kg, the peak BEC ranged from 52 to 136 mg/dL (N = 83), and slow absorption (a late-occurring peak) produced a lower peak BEC. The peak BEC was reached between 0 and 45 min for 77% of the subjects (N = 152) and between 0 and 75 min for 97% of them. The time of peaking in venous blood occurred, on average, 10 min later than in capillary (fingertip) blood although the peak BEC was not appreciably different; the mean venous BEC was 97.0 mg/dL (range, 76 to 112 mg/dL), and the mean capillary BEC was 99.6 mg/dL (range, 75 to 123 mg/dL). When subjects drank 0.80 g/kg ethanol diluted with orange juice over 30 min, the average BEC increment between the end of drinking and the peak was 33 mg/dL (range, 0 to 58 mg/dL). The rate of absorption of ethanol was 1.78 mg/dL/min (range, 0.52 to 4.8 mg/dL/min), and the peak BEC occurred within 60 min after the end of drinking in 92% of the trials. The largest BEC increment (mean, 21 mg/dL; range, 0 to 44 mg/dL) was seen during the first 15 min after the drinking period.\r"

  ".W": "Four individuals died as the result of a propane explosion. As with many propane explosions, the question was raised as to the adequacy of the product's odorization after the autopsy studies had been conducted. In most cases, this question leads to litigation. Ethyl mercaptan is a widely used odorant for propane and was used in this instance. Three of the four victims had blood available at autopsy for study. Quantitative analyses of the victims' blood, obtained during autopsy, were performed using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, without subjecting the samples to hydrolysis. These analyses determined the relative amounts of propane and ethyl mercaptan in the blood to be 90, 63, and 175 mL/m3 headspace, and 0.36, 0.34, and 0.77 microgram/L blood, respectively. Since mercaptans have been reported in human blood as products of metabolism, modeling studies were conducted to establish the validity of the autopsy data and to develop an autopsy toxicology protocol for investigating explosion deaths. When subjects were not exposed to an atmosphere containing ethyl mercaptan, dimethylsulfide was the only mercaptan detectable in their blood without severe hydrolysis prior to analysis. Metabolic ethyl mercaptan is sufficiently bound to be undetectable by the methods used without hydrolysis. Human subjects were exposed to a flammable mixture of air and propane odorized with ethyl mercaptan. The analyses of the blood from these subjects produced results which were comparable with those for the explosion victims, establishing that the question of odorant adequacy can be addressed at the autopsy of propane explosion victims. It is extremely important that the pathologist and toxicologist investigating gas explosion deaths recognize the valuable evidence existing in the victim's blood.\r"

The false positives were due to the constipation often associated with the narcotics abuse. The false negative X-ray diagnosis was attributable to an inexperienced radiologist. False negatives may also be associated with packets containing marijuana, packs with few wrappings, aluminum-foil coated packs, and machine-packed narcotics. Searching for trapped air in radiographs, repeated X-raying by an experienced radiologist, use of computed tomography, or combined urinary drug screening may be applied to diminish false findings and to avoid unnecessary arrest for the purpose of fecal screening over several days.\r"

Fracture-dislocation of the mid-thoracic spine, as a result of blunt thoracic trauma, can tear the azygos vein. Four such fatal cases (three motor vehicle accidents and one fall) were studied, only one of which was recognized prior to death. The vein can also be torn, in the absence of skeletal injuries, by horizontal acceleration/deceleration forces. The pathologist must consider azygos vein laceration as a possible cause of either hemothorax or hemomediastinum or both in a victim of a blunt chest trauma, if that individual had persistent hypotension during the few hours before death and no identifiable source of hemorrhage can be found postmortem in sites such as the heart, great vessels, lung, and chest wall. A fracture-dislocation of the thoracic spine may not necessarily be present. Azygos vein laceration seems to be an uncommon cause of hemothorax and hemomediastinum; however, this injury is probably more frequent than is implied by the few cases described in the medical literature.\r"

  ".W": "Since 1979, the potent narcotic analgesic fentanyl and its analogs have been synthesized in clandestine laboratories and sold as heroin substitutes. At least 112 overdose deaths have been associated with their use. In this study, toxicology data, autopsy findings, and coroners' investigative reports were reviewed in order to construct a profile of the typical fentanyl overdose victim and to identify any factors that might heighten the risk of death from fentanyl use. The \"typical\" fentanyl overdose victim was 32.5 +/- 6.7 years of age (range, 19 to 57 years), male (78%, compared with 22% female), and Caucasian (50%, compared with 29% Hispanic, 20% Black, and 0.9% Asian). With the exception of his or her age, the typical fentanyl overdose victim is quite similar to the typical heroin user. Nearly all the deaths (94%) occurred in California, yet within the state they were widely distributed throughout 17 counties and 44 cities. Pulmonary edema and congestion and needle puncture sites were consistent postmortem findings. No preexisting medical conditions were identified as possible risk factors. Although most of the fentanyl victims had a prior history of intravenous drug use, morphine or codeine were not commonly found, which suggests that the victims had little or no opiate tolerance. Ethanol was present in 38% of the cases and is thought to be a significant risk factor. Mean fentanyl concentrations in the body fluids were quite low: 3.0 +/- 3.1 ng/mL (0.3 +/- 0.31 micrograms/dL) in blood and 3.9 +/- 4.3 ng/mL (0.39 +/- 0.43 micrograms/dL) in urine, measured by radioimmunoassay. Although the potency of the analogs and the purity of street samples varies considerably, it is probably the general availability of the drug rather than the potency of a particular analog that determines the incidence of overdose deaths.\r"

All involved young males who had a history of abuse of controlled substances; all but three were under the influence of cocaine, phencyclidine [phenylcyclohexylpiperidine (PCP)], or amphetamine. All were behaving in a bizarre or unusual fashion which necessitated calling the police. The cause of death was an overdose of drugs in eleven, gunshot wounds in three, heart disease and Taser shock in one, and an undetermined cause in one. All were considered to be under the influence of PCP by the police at the time of the incident. All were unarmed, which was the reason a Taser was used instead of a more lethal weapon. The conclusion reached after evaluation of these cases is that the Taser in and of itself does not cause death, although it may have contributed to death in one case.\r"
