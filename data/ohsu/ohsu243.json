  ".W": "The present experiments were undertaken to assess dynamics of hepatic lactate and glucose balance in the over-night-fasted dog during 150 min of moderate-intensity treadmill exercise and 90 min of exercise recovery. Catheters were implanted chronically in an artery and portal and hepatic veins 16 days before experimentation. 3-3H-glucose was infused to determine hepatic glucose uptake, as well as tracer-determined glucose production by isotope dilution (Ra). At rest, net hepatic lactate output was 0.33 +/- 0.15 mg.kg-1.min-1 and increased to 2.26 +/- 0.82 mg.kg-1.min-1 after 10 min of exercise, after which it fell such that the liver was a net lactate consumer by the end of exercise and through recovery. In contrast to the rapid release of lactate, net hepatic glucose output rose gradually from 2.58 +/- 0.20 mg.kg-1.min-1 at rest to 8.87 +/- 0.85 mg.kg-1.min-1 after 60 min of exercise, beyond which it did not change significantly until the cessation of exercise. Hepatic glucose uptake at rest was 1.38 +/- 0.42 mg.kg-1.min-1 and did not change appreciably during exercise or recovery. Absolute hepatic glucose output (net glucose output plus uptake) rose from 3.96 +/- 0.45 mg.kg-1.min-1 at rest to 10.20 +/- 1.09 mg.kg-1.min-1 after 60 min of exercise and was 9.65 +/- 1.15 mg.kg-1.min-1 at 150 min of exercise. Ra rose from 3.34 +/- 0.21 mg.kg-1.min-1 to 7.58 +/- 0.73 and 8.59 +/- 0.77 mg.kg-1.min-1 at 60 and 150 min, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Nine male marathon runners were exercised to exhaustion to determine the effects of a 27-h fast on endurance performance. Each subject completed two exercise tests at the same treadmill speed (set at 70% maximal O2 uptake), one following a 27-h fast and one 3 h after a preexercise meal, in random order. Fasting caused a 44.7 +/- 5.8% (SE) decrease in endurance performance (P less than 0.01). Blood, muscle, psychological, and ventilatory data were examined to determine the cause of the decreased performance. Fasting caused significant increases in O2 uptake (9.3 +/- 2.0%), heart rate (8.4 +/- 2.4%), and rating of perceived exertion, ventilation, and psychological fatigue, evident within the first 60 min of exercise. There were no differences in plasma glucose or epinephrine levels. Muscle glycogen degraded at the same rate (0.482 +/- 0.146 vs. 0.470 +/- 0.281 mumol.g-1.min-1 in the nonfasted and fasted tests, respectively) despite lower respiratory exchange ratio and elevated free fatty acid levels, which may partially explain the elevated O2 uptake. Lactate, insulin, and norepinephrine were all increased in the fasted test (P less than 0.05). The increase in norepinephrine (r = 0.79, P less than 0.01), the diameter of type I muscle fibers (r = 0.70, P less than 0.05), and ending insulin levels (r = -0.88, P less than 0.01) were correlated with endurance time in the fasted state. Fatigue in endurance running for 27-h fasted humans appears to be related to a combination of physiological, psychological, metabolic, and hormonal changes.\r"

Starting from pioneering work done 20 years ago by Alexander and coworkers, neutrophil dysfunction after major thermal injury has been well documented. Defects in neutrophil function have been recognized as being serum-borne. Additionally, a review of granulocyte function in burns was presented in 1984, at the Conference on the Immune Consequences of Thermal and Traumatic Injuries. Because of methodologic difficulties, however, our knowledge of granulocyte kinetics has increased very slowly. Although the bone marrow produces 1.5 billion granulocytes per kg body weight per day and the marrow granulocyte reserve is enormous, the hematopoietic tissues, along with the release, distribution, and possible role of granulocytes in the pathophysiology of burns, have not been studied thoroughly. This article presents a current review of our knowledge of granulocyte kinetics in burns and the production and possible fate of granulocytes in tissues.\r"

In the clinical setting, efforts to prevent or control sepsis, or both, should include an understanding of normal host resistance, proper resuscitation techniques, and nutritional support. Previous studies have identified T suppressor cell abnormalities following thermal injury and have suggested macrophage defects after traumatic injury. Although major thermal injury is easier to quantify than mechanical trauma, both insults can stress patients' host resistance to a maximal degree, leading to profound and often fatal immunosuppression. Recent studies summarized in this paper have suggested that the macrophage and the interleukin system may play a major role in initiating some of these immune abnormalities following injury.\r"

Our ultimate goals for such allografts are their lifesaving capabilities in addition to their utilization in functional and aesthetic surgical reconstructions. The potential for such a treatment regimen to produce anatomical replacement of lost parts is a primary motivating reason to pursue such studies. Permanent host-accepted integumentary/musculoskeletal allografts would appear to offer much greater promise in comparison with recent synthetic and cultured tissue replacements. Summarized topics covered in this review include short- and long-term use of cyclosporine in a 30% body surface area rat burn model; bacterial studies in this model; primary wound excision and use of cyclosporine in a massive 80% body surface area rat burn model; pathological skin alterations in cyclosporine-treated rats; the synergistic immunosuppressive effects of prior blood transfusions and cyclosporine; long-term residual cyclosporine levels assayed in various long-term surviving allograft-recipients; and the use of cyclosporine and cadaver skin allografts to treat massive full-thickness burns in patients.\r"

The criteria for defining radiation-induced tumours of the central nervous system are proposed as follows: the tumour has a long quiescent \"latency period\", a location in the previously irradiated field, a verified histological difference from a primary condition, and does not arise from a primary condition associated with a genetic syndrome such as neurofibromatosis or tuberous sclerosis. The reported case fulfilled these criteria but appears to be the only reported radiation-induced oligodendroglioma.\r"

The basis of addiction may involve neurochemical changes in the brain that distort and redirect the drive states (instincts). Tolerance and dependence may only be incidentally associated with addiction as a result of a nonspecific adaptation by the body to the presence of a drug. The cellular adaptation may be the same in all organs. Addiction to alcohol and drugs may have no specific relationship to tolerance and dependence. Addiction occurs in the absence of observable tolerance and dependence to alcohol and drugs. Alcohol and drug addiction is probably more complex than tolerance and dependence. Addiction is difficult to study because of the variability of behavioral phenomena and the underlying intricacies of the neurosubstrates. Tolerance and dependence are still useful as they are indicators of drug use. It is a misconception that long term chronic use is necessary for tolerance and dependence to develop. Some studies have shown that tolerance can develop within hours and days to a single dose of alcohol or other drugs. Anxiety, depression and insomnia can occur after a single dose of ethanol in humans. These symptoms of withdrawal from the alcohol or drug constitute dependence. Redefining the criteria for addiction tolerance and dependence to alcohol and other drugs may be in order. A neurochemical model may provide a more definitive and uniform basis for considering addiction, tolerance, and dependence to alcohol and drugs.\r"

Two patients presented with cerebral hemorrhage, five with epilepsy, three each with a progressive focal neurological deficit, and one with papilledema. The unruptured lesions had a heterogeneous density on computed tomography with relatively little contrast enhancement. Two lesions contained major cysts. In one of these cases, the cyst measured 5.5 cm in diameter, had an enhancing membrane, and was surrounded by brain edema. Angiography did not show hypervascularity in any instance. During exploration and histological processing, special attention was paid to signs of previous silent hemorrhages and to the degree of encapsulation of the lesion. Iron deposits (signs of previous hemorrhages) were seen to varying degrees inside all cavernomas as well as in the surrounding gliotic cerebrum, and a causal relation between iron deposits and epileptic seizures seems likely. Encapsulation was minimal with the ruptured cavernomas and particularly prominent with the cystic lesions. The membrane of the giant cystic lesion with peripheral brain edema had a histological structure similar to that of the membranes of chronic subdural hematomas. It is suggested that continuous growth of cavernoma cysts is the result of recurrent hemorrhages from sinusoids of the malformation and from the neocapillary network of the cyst membranes.\r"

Of reported series, this one has the largest number of patients and the longest period of follow-up. The mean age of patients in this study was 51.2 years. The mean length of follow-up was 80 months. Patients had experienced pain for a mean period of 65 months before DBS was attempted; all patients had exhausted other medical and surgical therapies. For the purposes of this study, pain states were characterized as being either nociceptive or deafferentation in nature. Nociceptive pain was treated primarily by stimulation of the periaqueductal or periventricular gray, and deafferentation pain was treated primarily by stimulation of the sensory thalamus. Eighty-four patients were treated for deafferentation pain, which included the thalamic pain syndrome (25 cases), peripheral neuropathic pain (16 cases), anesthesia dolorosa (12 cases), paraplegia pain (11 cases), postcordotomy dyesthesia (5 cases), phantom limb pain (5 cases), thoracic neuralgia (4 cases), and miscellaneous pain states (6 cases). We treated 57 patients with nociceptive pain states, 51 for low back and skeletal pain and 6 for pain from the invasion of cancer. Initial relief of pain was obtained by 83 patients (59%). After the mean follow-up period of 80 months, 42 patients (31%) continued to obtain significant pain relief with DBS. Some pain states, particularly anesthesia dolorosa and paraplegia pain, did not seem to respond to DBS. Major complications of therapy included wound infection (12%) and intracranial hemorrhage (3.5%); there was one death in the series (0.7%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

A review of the literature suggests that 1% of all cases of meningitis are caused by more than one bacterial species. Before 1950 such cases occurred predominantly in children and were caused by combinations of bacteria commonly associated with meningitis. Since 1950 a largely adult population has been affected by mixed bacterial meningitis, with a higher incidence of gram-negative bacillary organisms cultured from the cerebrospinal fluid. Common predisposing factors in this older group of patients include infection at contiguous foci, tumors in close proximity to the central nervous system, or fistulous communications with the central nervous system. Mortality was 26% for cases occurring before 1950 and 63% for those occurring after 1950. Failure to recognize one of the organisms present in the cerebrospinal fluid may result in the initiation of inadequate therapy in as many as 67% of cases. Empiric broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy is indicated in symptomatic patients predisposed to mixed bacterial meningitis until culture results become available.\r"

The organisms possess numerous virulence factors that can act independently to induce various symptoms and lesions. Chemotherapy has changed the clinical spectrum of staphylococci but has not eradicated serious staphylococcal infections. An evaluation of the interaction of antibiotics, staphylococci, and host defense will help to identify those factors that determine the success or failure of therapy for staphylococcal infections. The activity of antibiotics is usually expressed in terms of concentrations that either inhibit or kill microorganisms in vitro or in experimental infections. Subinhibitory concentrations of antibiotics may induce changes in bacterial properties both in vitro and in vivo. An understanding of the mechanism of such changes would allow a more rational application of antibiotics that have both specific antistaphylococcal action and positive effects on host defense mechanisms.\r"

Underlying disorders included alcoholism, atherosclerosis, malignancy, surgery, diabetes mellitus, and dental caries. Clinical features included gastrointestinal tract signs and symptoms in 17 (77%) of 22, fever greater than 38 degrees C in seven (37%) of 19, and leukocytosis of more than 10,000 cells/mm3 in 11 (58%) of 19.

At least five rickettsioses exist in China: scrub typhus, murine typhus, epidemic typhus, Q fever, and one or more spotted fever-group (SFG) rickettsioses. Although epidemic typhus has been controlled and scrub typhus has abated in many areas, murine typhus, Q fever, and SFG rickettsiosis are important public health problems. Serologic surveys indicate high prevalences of antibodies to Coxiella burnetii, Rickettsia tsutsugamushi, and SFG rickettsiae in some regions; these rickettsiae have been isolated from humans, arthropods, and animals. Doxycycline has emerged as the best treatment for murine typhus, epidemic typhus, and scrub typhus. China offers both opportunities and challenges for the investigation and alleviation of the problems of rickettsial diseases.\r"

Fibronectins play important roles in the maintenance of hemostasis and in the organization of developing tissues.

One receptor, a 140-kilodalton complex, has been identified in a variety of cell types and is believed to mediate the attachment of cells to fibronectin-coated substrata. The existence of a second receptor has been proposed but it has not been identified. This receptor may function in the assembly of soluble fibronectin into the extracellular matrix. In this paper some of the recent developments in the identification and characterization of fibronectin-binding molecules on the surfaces of eukaryotic cells are outlined.\r"

  ".W": "Fibronectin binds specifically and irreversibly to Staphylococcus aureus. The expression of fibronectin-binding sites correlates with the invasiveness of the isolate. It has been suggested that the fibronectin receptor of S. aureus is either a protein or a carbohydrate that localizes at the surface of the bacterium, permitting interactions of the bacteria with the fibronectin of the host. Sites at which S. aureus typically initiates infection are rich in fibronectin, e.g., blood clots and subendothelium; the cells of the luminal surface of intact endothelium are among the few cell types that are relatively devoid of fibronectin. Removal of fibronectin receptors from S. aureus by mechanical means or by growing the bacteria in an antibiotic-containing medium decreases their ability to adhere. Thus, the fibronectin receptor appears to play a role in the initiation of S. aureus infections. These findings offer hope for the development of a vaccine that will prevent invasive disease-if the S. aureus fibronectin receptor(s) can be purified, proves to be immunogenic, and inhibits bacterial adherence to host tissues.\r"

The preferential adherence of a bacteria to a particular tissue influences the site of infection and the virulence of the organism. The glycoprotein fibronectin mediates adhesion of the bacteria to eukaryotic cells. Recent investigations have revealed that the precise locations of the binding sites for Staphylococcus aureus are close to the NH2-terminal and at the COOH-terminal regions of the fibronectin molecule. Teichoic acids are major cell-wall components of staphylococci that have been found to mediate the capacity of the bacteria to adhere to epithelial cells. By use of biologic assays based on the specific adherence of S. aureus to nasal epithelium, it was determined that the binding site for fibronectin appears to be teichoic acid.\r"

The major receptor on the surface of buccal mucosal cells for S. pyogenes is fibronectin. Fibronectin is a complex glycoprotein found in blood, extracellular matrices, and saliva. Many species of streptococci bind to fibronectin, although the characteristics of these interactions are different. Furthermore, whereas LTA is an efficient inhibitor of the binding of fibronectin to group A streptococci, it has little ability to inhibit the binding of fibronectin to Streptococcus pneumoniae or Staphylococcus aureus. Studies conducted with fibronectin show that different bacteria bind to different sites. The ability of various bacteria to interact with different domains on the fibronectin molecule may play an important role in bacterial adherence and tissue tropism.\r"

Several lines of evidence suggest that fibronectin may have a role in this adherence process. Fibronectin is an important component of the extracellular matrix of endothelium and fibroblasts and is exposed when these tissues are injured. Fibronectin binds to platelets and fibrin and thereby contributes to the thrombogenicity of surfaces. Because the structure of fibronectin consists of multiple functional domains, fibronectin can bind simultaneously and specifically to microorganisms and various tissue elements such as collagen and cells and may facilitate the uptake of microorganisms by endothelial cells and fibroblasts. Subinhibitory concentrations of certain antibiotics interfere with the expression of bacterial fibronectin receptors and inhibit the binding of Staphylococcus aureus to collagen matrices; this interaction may have implications for antibiotic prophylaxis of infective endocarditis.\r"

Moreover, a unifying hypothesis concerned with the role of fibronectin in the pathogenesis of syphilis cannot be limited solely to early events.

  ".W": "Fibronectin, a major interstitial matrix protein with binding sites for a variety of molecules and with multiple biologic activities, may play an important role in certain parasitic diseases. Leishmania and Trypanosoma cruzi bind host fibronectin, which, in turn, facilitates their association with the cells they parasitize. Invasive Entamoeba histolytica and Schistosoma produce proteases that degrade fibronectin and other matrix proteins, presumably facilitating the breaching of intestinal mucosa and dermal barriers to infection. The granulomatous inflammation that accompanies tissue deposition of schistosomal eggs promotes excess matrix production and scar formation. Granuloma macrophages and fibroblasts secrete fibronectin, which may serve to recruit additional fibroblasts and also may aid in maintaining the structural integrity of the granulomas. These early findings suggest that parasite-fibronectin interactions may be a fertile area for further research.\r"

  ".W": "Adherence of Candida albicans yeast cells to mammalian cells in vitro is promoted by a cell-surface adhesin that is probably a mannan or a mannoprotein. This observation is based on results of studies that utilized either lectins or antibodies to Candida that block attachment. Selective enzymatic degradation of cell wall constituents has been used to define the surface ligand of the candidal cell. Recently, nonadhering, spontaneous mutants of C. albicans, from both yeast and mycelial forms, that lack specific mannoproteins have been described. In addition, such mutants are avirulent, an indication that attachment plays a role in the disease process. The mammalian receptor for Candida has not been identified, but in endocarditis it could be fibronectin, both because fibronectin is present at the endocardial lesion and because those Candida species that bind to fibronectin in vitro exhibit a high disease potential; i.e., Candida species that bind to fibronectin in vitro also cause endocarditis, while those that do not bind in vitro do not cause disease. Attachment of yeast cells both to human buccal and vaginal epithelial cells is reduced significantly if yeast cells are preincubated with fibronectin, a finding that indicates a possible role for fibronectin as the epithelial surface receptor for Candida.\r"

  ".W": "Fibronectin is a dimeric high-molecular-weight glycoprotein composed of two similar but not identical subunits. Differences have been observed between plasma and cell-derived fibronectins, and molecular and sequencing studies have revealed a domain structure. The characteristic features of fibronectin include its various molecular and biologic interactions, which can be assigned to the different domains of the molecule. Fibronectin was originally discovered as a protein missing from the surfaces of virus-transformed cells. The importance of functional oncogenes in the loss of extracellular matrices was later established in a number of studies using virus mutants that are temperature-sensitive for transformation. The loss of the extracellular matrix appears to be a result of multiple events in cells but is not a prerequisite for malignant growth in vivo. There appear to be multiple transformed phenotypes, and the loss of extracellular fibronectin may be due in part to proteolytic activity by the cells and other alterations caused by functioning oncogenes. The wide distribution of tissue and soluble forms of fibronectin offers multiple occasions for interactions with other molecules. Binding of fibronectin to viruses and purified viral proteins has been observed in a number of studies. Neuraminidase-sensitive virus-binding sites in the fibronectin molecule have tentatively been identified. Fibronectin also is capable of binding to various complement components, possibly making clearance of viral antigen-antibody-complement complexes, which are observed in the circulation during viral infection, more rapid. The virus-binding ability of fibronectin may play a role in modifying viral infections in the body.\r"

Fragments of fibronectin released by neutrophil proteases are chemoattractants for monocytes. Moreover, subendothelial matrix fibronectin and \"inflammatory\" fibronectin released from phagocytes enhance phagocyte adherence to host tissues at an inflammatory site. Fibronectin also increases chemokinesis. Once the phagocyte enters tissues, fibronectin promotes C3- and Fc-receptor activation, allowing complement-coated bacteria to be ingested. Finally, fibronectin enhances the bactericidal activity of monocytes. Thus, fibronectin plays an important, but indirect role, in the activities of phagocytes.\r"

This paper reviews recent studies that have sought to characterize the natural history of plasma fibronectin during sepsis, as well as those studies that tested the effect of therapy with concentrated fibronectin in sepsis. The decrease in plasma fibronectin that generally is seen in humans during sepsis probably is due to many factors, and it has been difficult to produce a similar pattern in animal models. Depletion of plasma fibronectin is not a sensitive or specific predictor of imminent sepsis, and once sepsis is established, the concentration of plasma fibronectin is no more sensitive a predictor of mortality than are many other clinical markers. Early, uncontrolled trials of therapy with a fibronectin concentrate in patients with sepsis appeared to indicate a propitious effect on organ function. However, more recent controlled trials have failed to show a significant effect of therapy with fibronectin concentrate on either organ function or patient survival.\r"

Although the mean rate of clearance from lung to blood (T1/2LB) of 99mTc DTPA was more rapid in the patients (T1/2LB = 29 (SEM 3.2) min than in 42 normal subjects (T1/2LB = 59 (1.8)min), there was no difference between the clearance rate in the 18 patients who recovered from respiratory failure (T1/2LB = 31 (5) min) and the 14 who died (T1/2LB = 27 (4) min). Additionally, not all patients studied had abnormally rapid clearance rates. In 12 of the 32 patients the T1/2 fell within the range for normal individuals; this was found more commonly in patients who were predisposed to develop adult respiratory distress syndrome by pancreatitis or massive blood transfusion. These data suggest that a single measurement of 99mTc DTPA clearance in patients with established respiratory failure and adult respiratory distress syndrome is of no value in assessing the likelihood of recovery from this condition.\r"

Lipase intake was equal to the patients' previous requirements and was the same during the two months. Patients performed 72 hour faecal collections at the end of each month and completed diary cards daily throughout. Comparison of the month of treatment with enteric coated microspheres with the month of standard enteric coated tablets showed a significant increase in body weight on microsphere capsules (p less than 0.02). There was also a reduced frequency of bowel actions (p less than 0.001) and abdominal pain (p less than 0.05), and improvement in stool character (p less than 0.001) on microsphere capsules. Faecal fat excretion was reduced by 44% with the microsphere capsules (p less than 0.01), and 86% of patients showed an increased coefficient of fat absorption (mean increase 13%, 95% confidence limits 6.5-19.1%; p less than 0.001). Eighty one per cent of patients preferred microsphere capsules of the two treatments. Thus enteric coated microsphere capsules are more effective in treating steatorrhoea in cystic fibrosis than standard enteric coated tablets.\r"

For 24 h after administration of all doses, mean concentrations in serum exceeded MICs for Coccidioides immitis (trough concentrations, greater than 1 microgram/ml). Mean peak concentrations occurred 4 to 6 h after administration, ranging from 7 to 17 micrograms/ml for doses of 400 to 2,000 mg. Incremental increases in peak concentrations in serum were greatest at doses of less than or equal to 1,200 mg. To investigate whether long-term therapy altered concentrations in serum, serial data were studied by several methods. The results suggested a trend to increased levels in serum with prolonged therapy, but were not statistically significant. All 168 cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from meningitis patients contained less than or equal to 2.9 micrograms/ml, and only 6 contained greater than 1 microgram/ml. There was no apparent relation between dose, time after dose, site of CSF sampling, or concurrent inflammation and CSF ketoconazole concentration. Neither concentration in serum, toxicity, nor outcome correlated with dose, calculated in milligrams per kilogram at the fixed doses (400-mg increments) under study. Likewise, at the various doses, concentration in serum did not correlate with outcome or toxicity, suggesting that individual drug disposition was not an important factor in outcome or toxicity. Toxicity was reversible, and principal side effects were nausea and vomiting (50%), gynecomastia (21%), decreased libido (13%), alopecia (8%), elevated liver function tests (5%), pruritus (5%), and rash (4%). Gastrointestinal and endocrinologic toxicity were dose related and increased at doses greater than 800 mg.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

It was up to four times more potent than erythromycin against Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae and twofold more potent against Branhamella catarrhalis, Campylobacter species, and Legionella species. It had activity similar to that of erythromycin against Chlamydia spp. Azithromycin was significantly more potent versus many genera of the family Enterobacteriaceae; its MIC for 90% of strains of Escherichia, Salmonella, Shigella, and Yersinia was less than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml, compared with 16 to 128 micrograms/ml for erythromycin. Azithromycin inhibited the majority of gram-positive organisms at less than or equal to 1 micrograms/ml. It displayed cross-resistance to erythromycin-resistant Staphylococcus and Streptococcus isolates. It had moderate activity against Bacteroides fragilis and was comparable to erythromycin against other anaerobic species. Azithromycin also demonstrated improved bactericidal activity in comparison with erythromycin.

Maximum activity was observed at pH 7.0 to 7.6 in the presence of 5 mM MgCl2 and 100 mM KCl. 3'-Azido-3'-deoxythymidine triphosphate competed with dTTP for binding to HIV reverse transcriptase. Different kinetic constants were obtained with different primer-templates. Km and Ki values of 2.8 and 0.04 microM, respectively, were obtained with poly(rA)-oligo(dT)12-18. The corresponding values were 1.2 and 0.3 microM, respectively, with activated calf thymus DNA and 0.3 and 0.01 microM, respectively, with extracted virus and native template.

The resulting incorporation of 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine triphosphate into poly(rA)-oligo(dT)12-18 caused chain termination and premature deceleration of the reaction. The terminated primer could not be elongated when incubated with dTTP and HIV reverse transcriptase.\r"

In vitro erythrocyte lysis was prevented by using the liposomal forms of all drugs tested alone or in combination. Presumably, AmpB increases accessibility of the fungal cell membrane to the gramicidins, while liposome encapsulation decreases the rate of transfer of the drugs to the mammalian cell membrane. Liposome encapsulation of inactive or toxic drugs, used in combination with liposomal AmpB, may give new life to drugs previously believed to be inactive or too toxic for therapeutic consideration.\r"

Ciprofloxacin was the most active fluoroquinolone tested on a weight basis, as it inhibited approximately 50% of the isolates at achievable drug levels in serum. Ceftriaxone and cefpirome were the most active cephalosporins in this system with MICs of 8 micrograms/ml for 80% of strains tested. Imipenem, amikacin, and minocycline were the most effective agents tested.\r"

They were intensively treated with epipodophyllotoxin (VP-16-213) alone and subsequently had complete remission. One patient showed apparently dose-dependent cytotoxic effect. All three patients have maintained complete remission for 6, 7, and 11 months, respectively. Toxicities, including myelosuppression, alopecia, nausea, vomiting, and renal dysfunction, were well tolerated. Intensive treatment with VP-16-213 alone was thus found to have a potent therapeutic effect on acute monocytic leukemia in children. VP-16-213 deserves a further assessment in the therapeutic protocol for patients with childhood acute monocytic leukemia.\r"

In all eight cases positive immunoreactivity for keratin was found in carcinomatous areas and for vimentin, in the spindle cells. It is interesting that five cases demonstrated focal immunoreactivity to keratin in the spindle cell component. Trace positivity to vimentin was seen in the carcinomatous areas in one case. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that esophageal carcinoma with prominent spindle cells is of epithelial origin and may represent a morphologic variant of squamous cell carcinoma.\r"

Twenty-seven patients survived 1 year or more, but nonresected patients constituted 81.5% of this group. The only 5-year survivor did not undergo resection. Forty-seven percent of patients who survived 1 year and had not undergone gastroduodenal bypass, developed duodenal obstruction. It was not possible to identify a subset of patients with a favorable prognosis. A review totaling approximately 37000 patients, of whom 4100 had undergone resections, revealed only 156 survivors, 12 of whom had not been resected, for an overall survival rate of only 0.4%. No author had more than 3.4% of the total number of patients as 5-year survivors.\r"

The results of studies to detect neurosecretory granules were positive in seven of the 20 cases. Not only small cell carcinomas, but also tumors classified as undifferentiated carcinoma and poorly differentiated, adenosquamous carcinoma contained cytoplasmic granules consistent with neuroendocrine carcinoma of the cervix. The prognosis for survival appears poorer for patients having tumors with neurosecretory granules after controlling for stage and histologic grade of the neoplasm.\r"

Thirteen patients had an open defect that required an osteomuscular or osteocutaneous graft; the other three had a closed segmental osseous defect and the graft of the iliac crest was transferred without soft tissue. The average length of the osseous defect was seven centimeters. For the defects of the lower extremity, the average time to osseous union was 8.8 months. For the defects of the upper extremity, it was four months. Three patients had delayed union due to difficulty in positioning the graft on the tibia and maintaining circulation to the overlying skin; this led us to modify our method of transfer. In six patients, we used an osteomuscular graft and a separate skin graft instead of the osteocutaneous flap. When performing the transfers to the tibia, we tried to place the graft in the coronal plane against the fibula for better alignment and stability. For the transfers to the distal part of the forearm, we did a double microvascular anastomosis.\r"

  ".W": "Constrained replacement, like all prosthetic replacements, is constantly undergoing change and will improve as the current state of the art changes. It is not a standard, usual operation like unconstrained arthroplasty, and it should be reserved for the patient who requires arthroplasty and does not have a functional rotator cuff mechanism. If, in addition, the acromial fulcrum and loss of deltoid is present, then there is a greater reason for constrained replacement; it is a salvage procedure that is not as durable as the unconstrained device. Constrained arthroplasty has much merit if the risks and possible complications are well understood; however, pain relief and improved function will be lost if the device fails. The dislocation feature of the MRTS is desirable in order to minimize the risk of scapular fracture. Its disadvantage is that, with this complication, open operation is needed to reduce the assembly and insert new polyethylene components. The method of surface mounting of the metal glenoid component without removing the glenoid subchondral plate or cancellous bone of the vault is believed to lessen the risk of glenoid component loosening or pull-out. Finally, active function always depends upon residual deltoid muscle power. Thus, a poor or absent deltoid will only permit passive motion.\r"

The stature of 38 juvenile skeletons and their canal size were compared with those of the adults. By 4 years of age the midsagittal diameter and the area of the vertebral canal was fully mature and the mean interpedicular diameter 87% of adult size. There was a differential pattern of growth, with the proximal spine maturing first. The trefoil shape was not seen at L5 before puberty. Dental hypoplasia correlated with a small interpedicular diameter at L1, L2 and L3, and Harris lines with a small midsagittal diameter at L1, L3 and L5, a small area at L5 and a more trefoil canal at L4 and L5. There is evidence that adverse environmental factors are associated with the development of spinal stenosis.\r"

Compared with measurements for the same autoantibodies, in sera from 25 healthy blood donors, the burned patients' sera showed the presence of anti smooth muscle autoantibodies in 81.2 per cent, anti brush border autoantibodies in 56.2 per cent, antimitochondrial autoantibodies in 31.2 per cent and antinuclear autoantibodies in 12.5 per cent of the sera. Autoantibodies to gastric parietal cells were not detected. A correlation was noted between the presence of antimitochondrial autoantibodies and alterations in liver function. In contrast, no correlations were found between the raised levels of the various autoantibodies and resuscitative fluid or antibiotic therapy, intercurrent infections, serum immunoglobulin levels, surgical treatment or the duration of stay in hospital. The high titre of autoantibodies to anti smooth muscle could have arisen from tissue protein degradation associated with the raised requirements for energy by the hypermetabolic patients.\r"

However, by individualizing therapy for each patient, it is possible to prevent life-threatening acute infections, reduce the severity of chronic upper and lower respiratory tract disease, improve pulmonary function and achieve normal levels of IgG. These are the currently acceptable goals of therapy in patients with hypogammaglobulinemia.\r"

A total of 86 patients (61 men and 25 women with a mean age of 49.4 years and a mean blood pressure [and standard deviation] at entry into the trial of 155.5 [15.7]/101.0 [6.3] mm Hg) received enalapril, and 94 patients (63 men and 31 women with a mean age of 50.9 years and a mean blood pressure at entry of 156.6 [16.6]/101.2 [5.7] mm Hg) received atenolol. After a placebo run-in period the patients received increasing dosages of medication every 2 weeks until the target diastolic blood pressure of 90 mm Hg or less was achieved on two consecutive visits, the maximum dosage was reached, or the patient withdrew because of adverse effects. At 14 weeks the mean blood pressure was 141.6 (18.0)/90.1 (9.5) mm Hg in the enalapril group (61 patients) and 140.0 (17.1)/88.4 (8.7) mm Hg in the atenolol group (54 patients). The target diastolic blood pressure was achieved on completion of therapy (between weeks 10 and 14) in 67 (77%) of the patients receiving enalapril and 75 (79%) of the patients receiving atenolol. Compliance was similar in the two groups. Seven patients withdrew because of adverse effects, three in the enalapril group and four in the atenolol group. The results suggest that once-daily monotherapy with enalapril, 10 to 40 mg, is effective in the treatment of mild to moderate hypertension and is as effective as and tolerated as well as once-daily therapy with atenolol, 50 to 100 mg.\r"

After histological diagnosis, all patients were treated with 3 intravenous high-dose methylprednisolone pulses and then with low-dose oral steroids and 31 with cytotoxic drugs. Renal and extra-renal exacerbations were also treated with intravenous high-dose steroids. Patients were followed for 1 to 13 years. At 10 years the patient survival rate was 87% and the kidney survival rate was 79%. If 3 extra-renal deaths are excluded, the actuarial 10-year kidney survival rate is 91%. At present, 21 patients do not show any renal abnormalities, 13 patients have normal plasma creatinine but proteinuria, 3 patients have stable renal function impairment, 2 patients have worsening of their renal function, 1 is on regular dialysis. The other 3 patients died (from cardiac failure, cerebral hemorrhage and a car accident). The incidence of flare-ups was low (0.1 episodes per year). Severe side effects were rare in this series. It is concluded that the long-term prognosis of diffuse lupus nephritis is becoming considerably better. Therapy based on a short course of intravenous high-dose methylprednisolone and on a maintenance regimen with low doses of steroid and cytotoxic agents can contribute to preserving renal function while avoiding severe side effects.\r"

  ".W": "This work was undertaken to examine the immunoregulation of T lymphocytes in patients with IgA nephropathy. Fifty patients and thirty-seven control subjects were studied in an infection-free interval. T lymphocyte subpopulations were determined using OKT monoclonal antibodies against helper (OKT4) and suppressor (OKT8) T cell subsets. The proportions of T lymphocyte subpopulations did not differ between patients and controls. Patients with significant renal impairment demonstrated a reduced OKT4/T8 ratio (p less than 0.001) due to an absolute reduction of T helper cells (p less than 0.02) and an increase of T suppressor cells (p less than 0.001). Longitudinal studies performed in 13 patients revealed consistent findings during clinical quiescence. However, synpharyngitic macroscopic haematuria was associated with a rise in T4 positive cells and a simultaneous reduction of T8 positive cells; these changes reverted to pre-infection values when the infection subsided. Functional studies assessing T lymphocyte activities including in vitro immunoglobulin synthesis by cultured peripheral blood mononuclear cells, thymidine uptake by cultured lymphocytes and T lymphocytes activation with expression of interleukin-2 receptors were measured in unstimulated and mitogen stimulated cultures. No significant difference between patients with IgA nephropathy in clinical quiescence and the control subjects was demonstrated. Our results failed to support a shift in the immuno-regulatory T lymphocyte subpopulations during clinical quiescence but a more profound defect in immunoregulation may probably occur during clinical exacerbation.\r"

At 10 weeks of age mice were randomly assigned to cohorts of 20 to receive either no treatment, vehicle control, PGE1, iloprost or TSI. Proteinuria, mortality, systemic blood pressure, renal immune complex deposition, urinary TX B2 and 6 keto PGF1 alpha levels were measured. Mice receiving PGE1 and iloprost had a significant delay in the onset of proteinuria and reduction in mortality at 40 weeks. The TSI treatment had no apparent effect on proteinuria or mortality. The amelioration of the nephritis was not associated with an alteration in immune complex deposition in survivors at 40 weeks. Although PGE1 and iloprost lessened the age related increase in urinary TX B2, increased the urinary 6 keto PGF1 alpha levels and the ratio of 6 keto PGF1 alpha to TX B2; so did the TSI. The PGE1 treated mice did experience a marked and persistent reduction in blood pressure but this was not observed in the iloprost- or the TSI-treated mice. All drugs tested reduced the age-related increase in thromboxane B2 but only the PGE1 and iloprost had a significant effect on the evolution of the nephritis.\r"

Therefore, we project a lesser role for cardiac catheterization in the future, limited to definition of the coronary anatomy. Aortic valve replacement remains the proven therapy for patients with symptomatic aortic stenosis, although the decalcification/lithotripsy and balloon valvuloplasty techniques appear to be promising options in selected patients.\r"

One hundred ten patients undergoing routine diagnostic upper gastrointestinal endoscopy received diazepam intravenously in a dosage sufficient to achieve adequate sedation. On completion of the endoscopy, patients received either aminophylline (1.5 mg/kg) or placebo. Recovery from sedation was assessed on clinical grounds by a nurse, objectively using a serial reaction time test, and by the patient on a visual analogue scale. The number of patients judged to be fully alert at 30 and 60 min after the procedure was significantly greater in the aminophylline group than in the placebo group. Compared with values obtained before sedation, the placebo group had significantly prolonged reaction times 30 min after completion of the endoscopy, whereas patients who received aminophylline did not. However, according to their self-assessments, patients in both groups felt more uncoordinated following sedation. Aminophylline appears to hasten recovery from sedation with diazepam, and its use may permit earlier mobilization of patients after endoscopy.\r"

These are the free radicals (FR) superoxide and hydroxyl, hydrogen peroxide and the singlet 1O2. Their toxicity is primarily expressed through the peroxidation of membrane lipids, resulting in mitochondrial, lysosomal and parietal damage. It is enhanced by the presence of metals in trace amounts. Imbalance between the production of FR and the availability of FR scavengers (superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, etc.) may underlie different human pathologies. FR have been thought to play a part in inflammation, the aging process, carcinomatous transformations, damage due to recirculation and autoimmune diseases. As far as the kidney is concerned, the intervention of FR has been demonstrated or can be postulated in various contexts in the light of what has been observed in other pathologies: immunological nephritis, toxic nephropathies, microthrombotic and microangiopathic processes, damage caused by post-ischemic reflow, and problems in the preservation and rejection of transplants. FR have also been incriminated in lung lesions following intradialytic leukostasis and some aspects of toxicity ascribable to uremia. Subject to the precautions imposed by the need for theoretical, experimental and clinical verification, FR biochemistry offers new keys to the interpretation of a variety of kidney pathologies and opens up new prospects for treatment, both through a better understanding of the mechanism of action of drugs already known and employed, and with regard to the practical possibility of using alternative or combined forms of therapy.\r"

The application of the single patient (N of 1) trial to common clinical problems is a simple way to analyze the value of different therapeutic approaches. The time-consuming, expensive, multi-patient trial with ultimate extrapolation to the individual patient can be avoided. Single-patient trials can influence management and improve patient care and have potentially wide use in patients with gastrointestinal disease.\r"

The results from the analysis of seven clinical trials where ranitidine was directly compared to cimetidine indicated that 8.4% fewer patients experienced an ulcer recurrence on ranitidine (p less than 0.01). The estimate of the common odds ratio was 1.63, which indicated higher odds of recurrence versus nonrecurrence for cimetidine than ranitidine patients. The 95% confidence interval for the odds ratio ranged from 1.21 to 2.21.

The two drugs appear identical in their pharmacologic and biologic effects. Azathioprine is converted to 6-MP while in the body. Conflicting reports on the effectiveness of Aza have been published. The major National Cooperative Crohn's Disease Study (NCCDS) has found no advantage in Aza over placebo. In contrast, 6-MP was found to be effective in a large randomized trial. The shortcomings of the NCCDS reports are discussed with possible explanations for their negative findings. Our own studies, dating from 1968, are reviewed with 38 patients having been treated for up to 18 years, always in combination with small doses of steroids. Our results with Aza are similar to those of Present and Korelitz with 6-MP; about 70% of previously intractable patients improved substantially. Both Aza and 6-MP bring about healing and closure of most fistulas. Side effects can be serious but are usually manageable and, to some extent, preventable by appropriate dosage schedules. Since Aza has been approved for another benign, presumably autoimmune disease--rheumatoid arthritis--and because of its extensive use in other autoimmune diseases, we prefer to use Aza in selected patients with Crohn's disease who have failed to respond to more conventional modes of therapy. The use of immunosuppressants in ulcerative colitis is less clearly indicated.\r"

Inclusions alone were present in three patients; liver cultures alone were positive for CMV in three; and both were present in seven. Although the presence of CMV inclusions was the only histological feature that clearly separated the groups with and without hepatic involvement, two items helpful in finding inclusions were lobular aggregates of polymorphonuclear cells and portal karyorrhexic debris. The presence of liver involvement had a significant correlation with multiple organ infection, indicating it is a good marker of widely disseminated disease. This study indicates that liver histology and culture are useful and complementary methods for documentation of hepatic involvement (hence, tissue invasion) in immunocompromised patients with CMV infection.\r"

An important consideration in diagnosing antibody-mediated infertility is to use an immunoglobulin-specific technique that employs intact or living spermatozoa. Once this is done, a search should be made for what functional deficits in reproduction are associated with the presence of the antisperm antibodies. This would include postcoital testing, tests for ovum penetration (human sperm/hamster egg penetration assay), and tests for the ability of the sperm in the presence of antibody to undergo the acrosome reaction. Once the extent of the reproductive deficit is known, appropriate therapy can then be suggested. I believe that a \"case\" must be built to prove that antibody-mediated fertility actually exists in a particular couple, even in the presence of a positive test that is known to be highly specific. Sperm antibodies can attach to the sperm's surface without detrimentally affecting reproductive function. In a similar vein, low levels of sperm antibodies could give a positive test result, but the level may be insufficient to be a major detriment to fertility. It is hoped that in the near future isolation of specific sperm antigens will be used to identify antibodies against antigens critical to reproductive function. It may be possible to determine the minimal amount of antisperm antibody that is necessary to disturb each individual step in reproductive function. If a patient is found to have sperm antibodies whose quantity exceeds this amount, then the patient can be appropriately labeled as having antibody-mediated infertility. The array of therapies available for the couple's unique fertility problem(s) can then be described to the patient, and an appropriate therapeutic choice made.\r"

Techniques are gradually becoming available to identify the source of the parental gametogenic area. In addition, new methods to detect molecular mutation in euploidic abortion are gradually evolving. The establishment of normal protein profiles by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis in normal abortions should enable one to screen recurrent embryopathy in man for abnormal proteins. Abnormal proteins, once identified, can enable us to identify the specific DNA mutation that may be at the heart of the problem.\r"

Couples in whom oligozoospermia has been identified as the principal cause of infertility do not benefit from therapeutic insemination by husband. Because of this low success rate, intrauterine insemination to provide sperm in closer proximity to the egg has become popular, but intrauterine insemination also has a low success rate. We suggest that intrauterine insemination should be approached aggressively in cases of male factor infertility. The recipient should be stimulated to enhance egg production and closely monitored for ovulation. A semen specimen of not less than 1 X 10(6) motile sperm with antibiotics added should be placed in the uterus the day after ovulation. If no pregnancies occur within four cycles, alternate approaches should be considered. Therapeutic insemination by donor involves careful donor selection to avoid inheritance of malformations and familial diseases. Because of the possibilities of sexually transmitted diseases, careful and repeated screening should be conducted. A complete sexual history should be obtained, and donors should be excluded if they have had any homosexual contact since 1978, if they have been an intravenous drug user, if they come from a geographic area where the sex ratio of AIDS is close to 1:1, or if they have recently had multiple sexual partners. A permanent record preserving the confidentiality but allowing the tracing of genetic anomalies, even if not present at birth, should be kept.\r"

In our clinical experience, oligo-ovulation, manifested as oligomenorrhea or frank amenorrhea, associated with an acyclic estrogen milieu, is a consistent finding. This may be associated with hyperandrogenemia, hirsutism, inappropriate gonadotropin levels, hyperprolactinemia, obesity, insulin resistance, and ultrasound evidence of multicystic enlarged ovaries. A common presentation is infertility or irregular menstruation secondary to oligo-ovulation and hirsutism secondary to altered androgen metabolism. A challenge in diagnosis is to differentiate polycystic ovarian disease from latent cases of congenital adrenal hyperplasia. Although the precise mechanism in the pathogenesis of polycystic ovarian disease remains undefined, altered function of the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian and adrenal axes is both involved and integrated. Results from clinical trials of ovulation induction using different agents have implicated one site or another as the major progenitor of the \"vicious cycle\" but with no definitive pathway established. Restoring fertility to these patients can be challenging in that not all patients with polycystic ovarian disease respond to clomiphene or do so satisfactorily. The use of glucocorticoid suppression, pituitary suppression with GnRH analogues, or the use of FSH alone may be of benefit in clomiphene treatment failures.\r"

Presently, it is not clear why some individuals with endometriosis develop infertility and pelvic pain, whereas others with a similar degree of disease do not. Several tantalizing clues have been extracted from studies of the molecular pathogenesis, immunology, and biochemistry of endometriosis. Investigations are now under way to determine the specific relevance to infertility of macrophage aggregation; prostaglandin and related metabolite production by endometriotic lesions and macrophages; specific factors released by endometriosis that might directly impair ovum pick-up, fertilization, embryo transfer, or implantation; and ovulatory dysfunction including luteal phase deficiency and LUFS. There are probably a host of potential mechanisms of infertility in endometriosis; additional research should enable us to determine their regulatory features and to formulate effective clinical intervention. We now have a broader array of options for the treatment of endometriosis than ever before. However, most of the extant reported clinical experience consists of case reports and limited series of patients without the use of controls, follow-up intervals, and appropriate statistical analysis. The diverse course and presentation of the disease have limited our ability to develop a staging system that provides consistent scoring among different clinicians and appropriate relative emphasis on the various manifestations of the disease. Some additional resolution will be necessary to assess the relative contribution to infertility by fresh and recurrent lesions, endometriomas, and adhesions. These problems are now in sharp focus, and data should be available in the future giving us an accurate appraisal of the clinical effectiveness of danazol, gestrinone, GnRH analogues, conservative surgery, laparoscopic surgery including use of the laser, IVF-ET, and GIFT. Also, it is anticipated that potentially fertile patients with endometriosis might be identified so that they could avoid therapy altogether.\r"

The device contains eight marking-suction holes that make circular marks in the periphery of the donor cornea and fix the tissue in position during trephination. The eight peripheral marks correspond in location to meridians of an eight-blade radial keratotomy marker. When used in conjunction with this marker for the host bed, the donor cornea marker facilitates alignment of meridians on donor and host tissues, radial placement of sutures, and quantitative placement of sutures equi-distant from the wound margin.\r"

The first was a 30-year-old man with a 14-month history of hepatic and neurological impairment. In spite of treatment with d-penicillamine, he developed increasing dysarthria, dysphagia, akinesia and rigidity of all four limbs, and required continuous nursing care. Following transplantation, liver function was almost normal from four weeks onwards, but recovery of neurological function was much slower and was not seen until two to three months after surgery. By four months he was sufficiently mobile to be discharged, and when he returned for assessment at eight months, no abnormal neurological signs were detectable. The second patient was a 27-year-old woman with worsening liver dysfunction for eight years; one year previously she had developed dysarthria, akinesia, a fine tremor and moderate rigidity of all limbs as well as marked psychological impairment. There was no improvement on treatment with d-penicillamine or trientine, but as liver function returned to normal two months after liver grafting, her neurological and psychological function began to improve so that by three months she could be discharged.\r"

Aqueous in the subconjunctival space may then exit by multiple pathways. Bleb failure most often results from fibroblast proliferation and subconjunctival fibrosis. Factors associated with an increased risk of bleb failure include youth, aphakia, active anterior segment neovascularization, inflammation, previously failed glaucoma filtering surgery, and, possibly, race. Several surgical and pharmacologic techniques have recently been introduced to enhance success in eyes with poor surgical prognoses. To elucidate the scientific rationale of these methods, we summarize the process of wound healing after glaucoma filtering surgery and describe postoperative clinical and histopathologic features, factors which may affect success, and specific methods to improve surgical success.\r"

Using energy levels of 2-8 millijoules per shot and 1-3 shots per treatment, most irides can be penetrated in one sitting. Nd:YAG laser iridotomies show very little tendency to close, except in patients with active intraocular inflammation. A small amount of hemorrhage is common following YAG laser iridotomy, but clinically significant hyphema is rare. Significant lenticular or corneal damage is extremely rare. Although longterm follow-up of large numbers of patients is lacking, Nd:YAG laser iridotomy appears to be a safe and effective alternative to Argon laser iridotomy in selected patients.\r"

The therapeutic decision making process is complicated by the necessity for prompt, effective parenteral therapy, frequent coinfection with other sexually transmitted diseases, and emergence of antibiotic resistance. Because of the evolving problem of antibiotic resistance and the need for cost containment, the current recommendations of hospitalization for intravenous penicillin may need to be modified. The third generation cephalosporin, ceftriaxone, has properties that suggest it may be the best available antimicrobial agent as a single-dose treatment of gonococcal conjunctivitis. Spectinomycin may be a useful alternative in the penicillin-allergic adult patient.\r"

Recent studies on the mechanism of this leukocyte-mediated cytolysis have demonstrated that these cells, on stimulation, release a variety of reactive products. These metabolic products consist of superoxide and hydrogen peroxide, which in turn can form highly reactive species such as hydroxyl radicals. It is believed that these oxygen products play an important role in the tissue damage that occurs in inflammations such as uveitis. The ocular structures contain various antioxidant enzymes that normally protect against free radical mediated injury. In experimental animal models of uveitis, it has been shown that antioxidants and free radical scavengers can function as antiinflammatory agents and can protect the eye from inflammation-mediated tissue damage.\r"

However, at that time, the vertical meridian separating nasal from temporal retina was believed to be located at the optic papillae. This theory was disproved in 1870 by two Philadelphia ophthalmologists, who demonstrated and documented the vertical meridian at the macula during their examination of an injured Civil War soldier.\r"

  ".W": "We describe here several African isolates of HIV, compare them to U.S.-European prototype isolates and to each other, correlate the number of isolates with serological results, and provide insights into the disease spectrum associated with HIV infection in Africa. Three of 25 healthy Zairian donors and 54 of 87 Zairian patients selected for specific pathology and hospitalized in the internal medicine department of the University Clinic of Kinshasa, Zaire, were HIV positive over a six month period in 1985 either by serum antibody (42 cases) or virus isolation (40 cases). The virus positive cases showed a decrease in number of T4 cells and interleukin-2 (IL2) production by mononuclear cells. Restriction endonuclease analysis of HIV sequences from these isolates showed that genomic diversity is also observed in the Zairian isolates but closely related viruses could also be found, similar to the spectrum of diversity among isolates obtained from the U.S. and Europe. A number of isolates (12 of 40) were obtained from serum antibody negative adults. These results are difficult to explain by viral antigenic diversity alone since hybridization with a HTLV-III-B (clone BH10) probe under stringent conditions indicated an overall high degree of relatedness. Rather, these results indicate that some African HIV infected patients fail to make detectable antibodies to HIV or the antibodies were bound in immune complexes not detectable by current techniques.\r"

Modern technology has led to a considerable increase in our understanding of the physiology of motor function and has brought us to a stage where small intestinal motility is amenable to study in man. It is clear that coordinated motor function of the small intestine is central to integrated digestive function. Normal patterns, and in particular normal variants, are still being defined, and both the investigator and the clinician need to be particularly aware of interspecies, intersubject and interregional variations. While in some instances, abnormal motility is clearly related to an underlying disorder of intestinal neuromuscular function, in others, and in particular in functional gastrointestinal disorders, the overall experience of intestinal motility recordings in man is still too limited to allow us to declare with confidence whether reported abnormalities are, indeed, truly aberrant patterns or whether they are causally related to a given patient's symptoms.\r"

Twenty-five patients were withdrawn, 12 in the propranolol and 13 in the placebo group. No deterioration in clinical condition or liver function tests was observed in the propranolol-treated patients, although serum testosterone levels fell significantly compared with the control patients. This study shows that long-term treatment with propranolol is safe in patients with chronic liver disease but further studies are required to define whether or not patients will benefit. Our observations on the response to placebo suggest that a significant proportion of patients are not likely to tolerate drug treatment for portal hypertension well.\r"

Quantification refers to the expression of such outcomes as effect sizes and the coding of study characteristics. Integrating outcomes involves the pooling of results from individual studies. Critics of meta-analysis have focused on aspects of the methodology, but careful meta-analytic procedure protects against most potential biases.

  ".W": "Increased Mr 60,000 protein phosphorylation has been found in the cytosol fraction of brain tissue from Alzheimer's disease patients. A correlation between this biochemical change and the morphologic abnormalities found in Alzheimer's disease was sought. Three neuropathologic features were studied: neurofibrillary tangles and neuritic plaques, findings characteristic of Alzheimer's disease, and gliosis, a non-specific change. The number of tangles correlated well with the extent of Mr 60,000 protein phosphorylation (p less than 0.001); but the number of plaques did not. To investigate the possibility that gliosis causes the increased Mr 60,000 protein phosphorylation, cases of Pick's disease and multi-infarct dementia were also studied. The levels of Mr 60,000 protein phosphorylation in these cases were comparable to those seen in normal controls. These findings suggest that the increased Mr 60,000 protein phosphorylation is closely related to diseased, tangle-bearing neurons and is not directly related to neuritic plaque formation or secondary gliosis.\r"

  ".W": "Normal blood vessels invading a growing neoplasm undergo dramatic changes in morphology. Whether vessel characteristics are dictated entirely by the tumor, or from developmental restrictions in normal vessels from which tumor vessels originate is not known. To address this question we challenged two morphologically different types of capillaries (brain and muscle) with the same tumor environment (C6 astrocytoma), and quantified the invading vessel morphology. A vascular spheroids of C6 astrocytoma cells were implanted singly into rat cerebral cortex or iliacus muscle. Microvessels from the tumor, peritumoral tissue and control tissue were examined ultrastructurally and quantified. Tumor vessels differed significantly from host vessels but not from each other, regardless of implantation site. Neoplastic vessels were thick-walled relative to normal host vessels, had low densities of mitochondria and vesicular structures, and had both fenestrations and enlarged junctional clefts characteristic of highly permeable vessels. Control brain vessels were typically thin-walled, had a high density of mitochondria, a low density of endothelial vesicles and continuous tight junctions. Control muscle vessels were thin-walled with a low density of mitochondria, high density of vesicles and junctional zones with occasional enlarged clefts. Peritumoral vessel morphology was intermediate between that of tumor and the corresponding control tissue. We propose that C6 astrocytoma cells influence invading endothelial cells to develop a permeable phenotype radically different from host tissue endothelium, and host vessel phenotype does not influence tumor vessel morphology.\r"

  ".W": "The frequency of demyelinated fibers in mixed nerve and cutaneous nerve and the relationship of the frequency of demyelination to internodal length were assessed in a model of tellurium neuropathy in the rat. Twenty-day-old Long-Evans rats were fed chow containing 1.25% elemental tellurium for seven days and subsequently killed at 34 or 41 days of age. Teased-fiber preparations revealed a higher frequency of demyelinated fibers in sciatic nerve (mixed nerve) than in sural nerve (cutaneous nerve). The frequency of demyelinated fibers was positively associated with internodal length in both nerves. The type of nerve (mixed or cutaneous) was not a significant predictor of the frequency of demyelinated fibers once internodal length had been taken into account. These data indicate that there is a hierarchy of vulnerability within the population of myelinating Schwann cells to tellurium toxicity, and that this hierarchy is related to internodal length. The hierarchy of vulnerability may reflect intrinsic differences among Schwann cells, such as the volume of myelin each cell is synthesizing and maintaining, or a gradient of unrecognized axonal abnormalities.\r"

These neurofilamentous collections are not cross-reactive with antibodies directed against paired helical filaments and the microtubule associated protein tau. In addition, diffuse staining for phosphorylated neurofilament epitopes in chromatolytic anterior horn perikarya was significantly more frequent in ALS patients than in controls.\r"

Sensitivities and specificities for alcohol-use questions were calculated using the MAST diagnosis of alcoholism. The questions \"How much do you drink?\" and \"How often do you drink?\" yielded low sensitivities of 34.0% and 46.8%, respectively. The question \"Have you ever had a drinking problem?\" considered alone had a high sensitivity of 70.2%; when combined with \"When was your last drink?\" this question had a sensitivity of 91.5%. We recommend the routine incorporation of these last two questions into the medical history in light of the high prevalence of alcoholism in this outpatient population.\r"

Compared with seronegative wives, the seropositive wives were older (median ages, 54 and 62 years; P = .08) and actually reported somewhat fewer sexual contacts with their infected husbands (means, 156 and 82; P greater than .1). There was no difference in the types of sexual contact or methods of contraception of the seropositive and seronegative spouses. There was no evidence of HIV transmission to the 63 other family members. Although most husbands and wives remained uninfected despite repeated sexual contact without protection, some acquired infection after only a few contacts.

Women aged 25 to 58 years in whom cervical cancer was diagnosed and reported to the National Tumor Registry were examined as two separate case groups: invasive cervical cancer and carcinoma in situ (CIS). Controls were women aged 25 to 58 years identified through a national survey. Women who had used OCs had no increased risk of invasive cervical cancer compared with women who had never used OCs (relative risk, 0.8; 95% confidence interval, 0.5 to 1.3). Women who had used OCs had an increased risk of CIS compared with those who had never used OCs (relative risk, 1.6; 95% confidence interval, 1.2 to 2.2). However, further analyses indicated that this increased risk was confined to those who had recently used OCs. Also, the risk of CIS was not elevated in subgroups in which a history of cervical smears was not strongly linked to OC use. The elevated risk of CIS among OC users may therefore reflect a bias caused by enhanced detection of disease rather than a causal association.\r"

We conclude that despite the lack of experimental evidence of the long-term effectiveness of clinically based efforts to promote occupant restraint use, such efforts may be warranted because of the enormous social and economic costs of automobile injury.

Because F- binds to Ca2+ to cause marked hypocalcemia, lowered serum Ca2+ concentrations have been thought to be a major underlying factor in the ventricular irritability of F(-)-toxic patients. However, correction of the hypocalcemia does not prevent sudden death. Paradoxically, while decreasing extracellular Ca2+ levels, in vitro studies have shown F- increases intracellular Ca2+, which is thought to trigger Ca2+-dependent K+ channels and produce a K+ efflux. The K+ efflux may be important clinically, as patients with F- overdose can exhibit hyperkalemia shortly before cardiovascular collapse. In erythrocyte suspensions, we found that propranolol, which increases the sensitivity of the Ca2+-dependent K+ channels, exacerbates the efflux, and quinidine, which blocks the channel, prevents the efflux. In six dogs, 35 mg/kg of sodium fluoride given intravenously produced intractable ventricular fibrillation within 140 minutes. Four dogs given 200 mg of quinidine sulfate with the sodium fluoride developed no ventricular arrhythmias. The data indicate that F--induced hyperkalemia is important in sudden cardiac death following acute fluoride toxicity and that this hyperkalemia is mediated by Ca2+-dependent K+ channels.\r"

We sequentially measured Pcjo2, Pcjo2/Pao2, blood pressure, and pulse rate in five healthy adults after controlled phlebotomy of 450 mL and after intravenous fluid repletion. No significant changes occurred in either the Pcjo2 or Pcjo2/Pao2 after phlebotomy or after fluid replacement. We conclude that a blood loss of 450 mL in healthy, euvolemic adults is insufficient to perturb the conjunctival index. The lower limits of sensitivity of changes in Pcjo2 and Pcjo/Pao2 in response to acute blood loss remain to be established.\r"

We prospectively compared the utilization and yield of drug screens based on urine and of identical tests of gastric contents under actual clinical conditions in a busy metropolitan emergency department. During the 4.5-month study period, physicians ordered drug screening in 405 of 582 (70%) study cases. Screens of both types of body fluid were ordered in only 95 cases (16%), suggesting study physicians regarded these tests to be functionally equivalent. Drug screens of gastric fluid were favored in cases involving acute ingestion and in medically complicated cases requiring gastric lavage. Urine drug screens were favored in clinically stable cases with primarily thought or behavior disorders. In the 95 cases for which both drug screens were ordered, gastric screens in 18 cases detected 20 drugs not detected by urine drug screening. Urine screening, on the other hand, identified 74 drugs not found on gastric screening in 48 cases. Gastric drug screening also performed poorly in comparison to quantitative serum drug levels. Seventeen false-positive urine or gastric screens were noted as well. Despite significant technical limitations, physicians frequently order drug screens in our emergency department. Qualitative drug screening of gastric fluid may prove useful in cases involving acute ingestion, but samples of urine and serum must also be submitted for analysis if optimal test performance is to be achieved.\r"

The responders to UPPP were less severely affected preoperatively regarding apneas and hypopneas, the mean number of which (+/- SD) were 32.7 +/- 20.8 compared with 64.6 +/- 26.0. They also had a lower body mass index before UPPP (31.3 +/- 4.1 vs 36.0 +/- 7.0 kg/m2). Preoperative computed tomography and cephalometry indicated that the nonresponders had narrower upper airways.

In the present studies, competition binding isotherms (n = 9) using paraformaldehyde-fixed platelets showed that [2-3 H]ADP bound to two sites with a small amount (approximately 5% of total) of nonspecific binding: 410,000 +/- 40,000 sites of low affinity (Kd 7.9 +/- 2.0 mumol/L) and 160,000 +/- 20,000 sites of high affinity (Kd 0.35 +/- 0.04 mumol/L) corresponding to the ADP concentration required for activation in fresh platelets (0.1-0.5 mumol/L). All agonists and antagonists examined were able to compete with ADP at the high-affinity site. The strong platelet agonists 2-methylthio ADP and 2-(3-aminopropylthio)ADP competed with ADP at the high-affinity site with dissociation constant values of 7 mumol/L and 200 mumol/L, respectively. The partial agonist 2',3'-dialdehyde ADP and the weak agonist GDP also competed at the high-affinity site with Kd values of 5 mumol/L and 49 mumol/L, respectively. The sequence of binding affinities of other adenine nucleotides at the high-affinity site corresponded to their relative activities as known antagonists of platelet activation by ADP; namely, ADP(Kd 0.35 mumol/L) approximately equal to ATP (Kd 0.45 mumol/L) much greater than AMP (Kd 360 mumol/L). Adenosine and 2-chloroadenosine did not compete with ADP. ADP binding to the high-affinity site was inhibited by p-mercuribenzene sulfonate (Ki 250 mumol/L) but only very weakly by 5'-p-fluorosulfonylbenzoyladenosine (Ki 1 mmol/L). All the above nucleotides also competed with ADP at the low-affinity sites but, because of the high concentrations of competing nucleotide required, dissociation constants at this site were obtained only for ATP (21 mumol/L), 2-MeS ADP (200 mumol/L) and 2',3'-dialdehyde ADP (270 mumol/L). 8-Bromo ADP competed strongly with ADP at the high-affinity site (Kd 0.40 mumol/L) but weakly if at all at the low-affinity site. 8-Bromo ADP inhibited platelet activation induced by ADP (EC50 approximately 100 mumol/L) but not by collagen, thrombin, or ionophore A23187.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Ninety patients with progressive recurrent lymphoma were treated with a combination of cisplatin 100 mg/m2 intravenously (IV) by continuous infusion over 24 hours, followed by cytosine arabinoside in two pulses each at a dose of 2 g/m2 given 12 hours apart. Dexamethasone, 40 mg orally or IV, was given on days 1 through 4. Vigorous hydration was reinforced by routine use of mannitol. Treatments were repeated at 3- to 4-week intervals for six to ten courses. Most patients had not achieved complete remission (CR) with prior therapies, which included Adriamycin (all patients) and methotrexate and VP-16 (58 patients). Median patient age was 55 years. Intermediate-grade lymphoma was the most frequent pathologic diagnosis. Seven patients died within two weeks of therapy; of the remaining 83 patients, 28 (34%) or 31% if all patients are considered, achieved CR, and 22 (26.5%) achieved partial remission (PR). Response was evident after the first two cycles of chemotherapy and appeared to be independent of the histopathologic type of lymphoma. To date, only eight of the complete responders have relapsed at a median follow-up of 11 months. The overall 2-year survival in 25%. Further analysis showed that patients with low tumor burden and normal lactic acid dehydrogenase (LDH) had a high CR response rate (67%) and a survival rate of 61% at 2 years. In contrast, patients with both high tumor burden and elevated serum LDH levels had a negligible CR rate, and only 5% are surviving at 1 year. Patients with either high tumor burden with normal LDH or low tumor burden with elevated LDH had an intermediate survival. Myelosuppression-related infection was the most frequent serious complication of this regimen (31%) and the cause of death of ten patients. Acute lysis syndrome was also observed in five patients with high tumor burden and was the cause of death in three of these patients. DHAP has proven to be an effective non-crossresistant regimen for patients with relapsing or refractory lymphoma, particularly for patients who have favorable prognostic characteristics.\r"

  ".W": "Fibrinogen is a cofactor in the aggregation of human platelets, and is required for ADP-induced aggregation of washed platelets; however, exogenous fibrinogen is not required for ADP-induced aggregation of washed platelets from rabbits or rats. Because with human platelets the cell adhesion peptide, Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser (RGDS), inhibits aggregation and the binding of 125I-fibrinogen to ADP-stimulated platelets, its effects on rabbit and rat platelets were studied to investigate the differences in the fibrinogen requirements of platelets from the three species. RGDS (50 mumol/L) caused greater than 80% inhibition of thrombin-induced or (ADP + fibrinogen)-induced aggregation of human platelets, but only 3% to 9% inhibition of the aggregation of rabbit or rat platelets, regardless of whether fibrinogen was added. RGDS inhibited the binding of 125I-fibrinogen to ADP-stimulated human platelets by 80% to 90%, but by only 15% to 27% in the case of rabbit or rat platelets. The differences were due to the species of platelets, since human and rabbit fibrinogens gave similar results. In addition, RGDS failed to displace fibrinogen from the surface of rabbit platelets that had been stimulated with ADP. Thus, there are species differences in the ability of the cell adhesion peptide, RGDS, to block the platelet fibrinogen receptor, even within the mammalian species.\r"

  ".W": "Platelet-activating factor (PAF) is a proinflammatory lipid that has both platelet- and phagocyte-stimulating properties. Because several known activators of calcium-, phospholipid-dependent protein kinase (protein kinase c, PKC) also stimulate neutrophil responses and because neutrophil stimuli such as phorbol diesters and the chemotactic peptide f-Met-Leu-Phe are reported to increase protein kinase activity in neutrophil (PMN) particulate fractions, we investigated the effect of PAF on neutrophil protein kinase activities. In neutrophils exposed to 10(-6) mol/L PAF, cytosolic PKC activity was 521 +/- 38 pmol 32P/10(7) PMN/min (mean +/- SEM), which was not significantly lower than cystolic activity in buffer-treated controls (558 +/- 32 pmol 32P/10(7) PMN/min, n = 14). PAF-exposed cells exhibited a concomitant rise in protein kinase activity associated with the particulate fraction with 53 +/- 4 pmol 32P/10(7) PMN/min compared with 32 +/- 2 pmol in control cells (n = 14). Particulate protein kinase activity was independent of the presence of calcium and phospholipid in the assay medium. The specific PKC inhibitor H-7 inhibited particulate protein kinase activity, however, which suggested that the enzyme activity assayed in this fraction may be PKC in a constitutively activated form. The increase in particulate protein kinase activity induced by PAF required the presence of cytochalasin B, was detectable within 5 seconds of exposure to PAF, and was not reversed by washing the cells free of extracellular PAF after initial exposure. Although PAF did not have a direct effect on PKC activity from cytosolic fractions from resting cells, the increase in particulate protein kinase activity induced by PAF was inhibited when the cells were first depleted of calcium by incubation with Quin 2. These results suggest that PAF induces an increase in particulate protein kinase activity in neutrophils by a calcium-dependent mechanism and that the induction of membrane-associated protein kinase activity may be involved in neutrophil-stimulating actions such as superoxide production, which occur at higher concentrations of PAF.\r"

  ".W": "Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph1) acute leukemia is a heterogeneous subset of acute leukemia with a poor prognosis. We studied five patients to determine the potential for phenotypic and molecular heterogeneity. Cellular characterization studies included light myeloperoxidase (L-MPO), terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT), ultrastructural MPO (U-MPO), and immunophenotyping by flow cytometry using T11, T3, T4, T8, Leu 1, B1, Leu 12, HLA-DR (la), CALLA (J5), OKM1, My4, My7, My8, My9, and My10. DNA was analyzed for rearrangements of the breakpoint cluster region (bcr), immunoglobulin heavy chain, joining region (JH), immunoglobulin kappa light chain constant region (C kappa), and T cell receptor (TcR beta). RNA dot blots were hybridized by using molecular probes for MPO and TdT. We found that four of five cases were acute mixed-lineage leukemia (AMLL). One patient had acute unclassifiable leukemia. Of the four patients classified as having AMLL, three showed myeloid and lymphoid features, with one patient showing myeloid, T cell, and B cell features. The last case showed T cell and B cell features only. In one patient MPO/RNA was positive in spite of insufficient L-MPO or U-MPO to diagnose acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), thereby suggesting significant MPO gene expression before the production of sufficient MPO protein to meet the French-American-British criteria for AML. Three of the five patients showed rearrangement of bcr (cases 1, 2, and 5). Studies of these five patients support the concepts of molecular and phenotypic heterogeneity in Ph1 acute leukemia, demonstrate a high incidence of AMLL in this subset of acute leukemia, and support the use of lineage-associated molecular probes to define lineage at an earlier stage than previously possible.\r"

Radiolabeled AP-1 bound specifically and saturably to HUVEC in suspension and detected a single class of binding sites (100,000/cell). When Triton X-100 extracts of HUVEC were chromatographed on wheat germ agglutinin (WGA)-Sepharose, radioiodinated, precipitated with AP-1, and subjected to reduced sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), major radioactive bands of 228,000, 145,000, and 130,000 were seen. The latter two bands correspond to the 156,000 and 140,000 bands, representing GpIb alpha and glycocalicin, respectively, which are seen when platelets are subjected to the same procedure. The 228,000 band corresponds to a band previously noted in immunoprecipitates of platelet GpIb but not fully explained. When HUVEC were grown in the presence of 35S-methionine, extracted with Triton X-100, chromatographed on WGA-Sepharose, immunoprecipitated with AP-1, and subjected to reduced SDS-PAGE, radioactive bands of 210,000, 156,000, and 90,000 were seen. We conclude that cultured HUVEC synthesize and express on their surface a glycoprotein immunologically related to platelet GpIb.\r"

Three cell hybrids containing only a portion of chromosome 3 were analyzed in order to further localize protein S. Based on the somatic cell hybrid analysis, protein S is assigned to a region of chromosome 3 that contains a small part of the long arm and short arm of the chromosome including the centromere (3p21----3q21). In situ hybridization of the protein S cDNA probe to human metaphase chromosomes permitted a precise localization of protein S to the region of chromosome 3 immediately surrounding the centromere (3p11.1----3q11.2). Protein S is the first protein involved in blood coagulation that has been mapped to human chromosome 3.\r"

C3 bound to red cells was measured by radiolabeled monoclonal antibody to C3, and fluid-phase C5a was determined by radioimmunoassay. Heparin and protamine in clinically relevant concentrations caused the binding of C3 to red cell membranes, and the measurement of C3 binding provided a sensitive indicator of complement activation produced by these complexes. Complement activation by these reagents occurred at concentration ratios of protamine and heparin at which protamine neutralized the anticoagulant effect of heparin. Heparin-protamine complexes appeared to bind to red cells and produce complement activation by the classic pathway. C5a generation with heparin-protamine complexes in serum was greatly enhanced in the presence of red cells and increased with increasing red cell concentration. This enhancement of complement activation in the presence of red cells was also seen as measured by depletion of available C3 hemolytic complement units in the fluid phase. Thus red cells seem to play an important role in activation of complement by heparin-protamine complexes.\r"

When less dense SS discocytes were deoxygenated slowly by flushing with 95% N2 and 5% CO2 at a rate of 3 mL/min, the percentage of ISCs increased from 5% to 26.5% after 24 hours. In contrast, upon rapid deoxygenation (10, 35 mL/min) ISC formation was reduced significantly. The difference may be related to fact that more sickle-shaped cells were formed upon slow deoxygenation than upon the rapid deoxygenation that resulted in the formation of star-shaped and granulated cells. So-called ISCs were formed more easily from sickle-shaped cells. To express the shape of sickled cells numerically, we calculated the mean maximum cell length (MCL) after cells were incubated under various deoxygenation conditions. The MCL of slowly deoxygenated SS cells after 24 hours of incubation was about twice (20.0 +/- 7.0 micron) that of quickly deoxygenated (35 mL/min) SS cells (12.5 +/- 5.0 microns) (initial MCL, 8.0 +/- 1.0 micron). The decrease in potassium content was greater with slow deoxygenation than with rapid deoxygenation. Because the increase in sodium influx was less than that of potassium efflux under slow deoxygenation, SS cells became more dense than those rapidly deoxygenated. In the absence of Ca2+, morphological changes were the same as in the presence of Ca2+; however, under this condition there was no change in density, and no ISCs were formed regardless of the rate of deoxygenation. These results demonstrate that the number of ISCs formed correlates with the MCL. The length of fibers of sickle hemoglobin may be a determinant of the length of sickled cells. This suggests that membrane stretching plays an important role in cell density and irreversible membrane deformation.\r"

Inasmuch as fibronectin and synthetic peptides containing RGD enhance ingestion of opsonized particles by monocytes, we investigated the effects of vitronectin on phagocytosis by monocytes of sheep erythrocytes bearing IgG (EA) or complement C3b (EC3b). Peripheral blood monocytes were isolated by countercurrent elutriation and allowed to adhere to slides that had been coated with either vitronectin or fibronectin. Next, EA or EC3b were incubated with the adherent monocytes, and phagocytosis was subsequently quantified. Vitronectin caused the same dose dependent increase in phagocytosis as fibronectin. The augmentation of phagocytosis of EA induced by vitronectin could be inhibited by the F(ab')2 fragments of anti-vitronectin IgG but not by preimmune F(ab')2. The maximum phagocytosis of EA induced by vitronectin could not be enhanced by the addition of fibronectin, suggesting that vitronectin and fibronectin act on the same population of monocytes and that the two proteins stimulate the same mechanism through which the enhanced phagocytosis is mediated. Fibronectin and vitronectin caused a tenfold increase in the attachment of EC3b to monocytes, but phagocytosis was augmented minimally. These studies demonstrate that vitronectin modulates interactions between monocytes and opsonized particles.\r"

There were five thoracic injuries, one cervical injury and one lumbar injury. All seven bony injuries healed. Four of the patients had permanent neurologic sequelae; two of the four had paraplegia. All seven patients suffered disability that impaired work performance; all five farmers suffered some loss of income.

High incidence rates are expected among children 5 to 9 years of age because of their susceptibility and their greater exposure in school. Low incidence rates among older age groups are expected, because most of these people have already been exposed to the virus. The disease is more serious among infants than among other children. The risk of death from chickenpox is also highest among infants. More patient-specific information and improved collection of incidence data are required to measure any impact from future control procedures, including the use of vaccines currently being developed.\r"

Following increase in tumor size, the number of cases of nondiploid increased. The DNA pattern closely correlated with the morphologic grading and age of patients, yet there was no correlation among DNA pattern and presence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) or presence of liver cirrhosis. Regarding the prognosis of patients with HCC, there was no statistic difference between DNA pattern and prognosis. The present study suggests that the DNA pattern relates to the biologic characteristics of the growth pattern of HCC.

This report describes the independent flow cytometric analysis and interpretation of \"unknown\" paraffin-embedded bladder tumor specimens by the five Network institutions. Although important differences in method existed among the institutions, substantial agreement was achieved in actual data generated and their interpretation.

  ".W": "Forty-five patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), with progressive inoperable tumors were treated. Twenty-three patients were of \"limited\" stage. Six patients had received previous thoracic radiotherapy. Patients with central nervous system (CNS) metastases, Karnofsky scores of less than 30 or more than 70, and patients over 70 years of age were excluded from the study. Cyclophosphamide (2.5 g/m2) was infused intravenously over 3 hours with the same Mesna dose. At the midpoint of the infusion, 3.5 g/m2 infosfamide was delivered as a bolus. Additional Mesna was administered over the next 8 hours. A maximum of four courses were given at three weekly intervals. One-hundred-thirty-eight courses were administered and 53% of patients completed all four treatments. The response rate was 38%, with three (7%) complete responses. Seven additional patients (15%) with stable disease symptomatically improved by two steps or more on the Karnofsky scale at the end of treatment. Median survival for all 45 patients was 7 months, range less than 1 to 25 months. Sixteen courses were complicated by Grade 3 thrombocytopaenia and/or leukopenia (Grade 4 on six occasions, Grade 3 on seven occasions) on the blood count taken immediately before chemotherapy. Intravenous antibiotics were required on 14% of the total number of courses; and three patients died of probable treatment related causes. Two episodes of severe ifosfamide encephalopathy occurred but recovery was complete, and four episodes of frank hematuria also occurred. The Karnofsky score was more than 70 in 33% of patients one month after the end of chemotherapy compared with 0% before treatment. Unlike many chemotherapeutic regimens for NSCLC, double alkylating agent treatment with ifosfamide and cyclophosphamide improved the performance status without major toxicity in a selected patient population. The overall survival, however, remains short and further alkylating agent combinations need to be considered in the future.\r"

In a retrospective analysis, 113 patients (male-female, 3.5:1) with carcinoma of the larynx were examined. Sixty-seven patients (59%) were between 50 and 60 years of age. There were two patients (2%) with carcinoma in situ, 15 (13%) in Stage I, 40 (35%) in Stage II, 39 (35%) in Stage III, and 15 (13%) in Stage IV. Of the 113 patients, 70 (62%) were treated surgically, Group I; 24 (21%) received radiotherapy only, Group 2; and 19 (17%) refused treatment or died before therapy initiation. For patients in Group 1, the 1-year survival rate was 68% (43 of 63), the 3-year survival rate was 38% (20 of 53), and the 5-year survival rate was 15% (7 of 47). For Group 2, the survival rate was 48% (11 of 23), 30% (7 of 23), and 14% (3 of 22), respectively. In this patient population, laryngeal carcinoma occurred at a younger age than other reported groups, had a higher incidence in females, and had a lower 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival rate.\r"

  ".W": "The possible association between the risk of breast cancer, blood level, and dietary intake of preformed Vitamin A (retinol) and beta-carotene was investigated in a case-control study carried out from May 1982 to June 1985. The patients studied were 214 previously untreated individuals with T1-2, N0-1, M0 breast cancer admitted to the National Cancer Institute of Milan and 215 controls admitted for conditions other than neoplastic or metabolic disorders. Both cases and controls were selected from an age group ranging from 30 to 65 years old. Plasma levels of retinol and beta-carotene were tested from blood samples drawn during the first day after admission to the hospital. A questionnaire about diet was used to estimate the mean intake of 69 food items from which a daily dietary index of retinol and beta-carotene intake was computed. Information relating to the woman's history, socioeconomic status, and known risk factors for breast cancer was also collected. No association was found between beta-carotene (in the diet or blood) or dietary retinol and the risk of breast cancer. As for blood retinol, our data show a significant trend of increasing risk with higher levels; multivariate relative risk for subsequent serum levels based on the control quintiles, are 1, 1.5, 1.8, 1.7; (test for linear trend: chi-square = 8.26). Thus, these findings, together with the results of other studies, suggest that retinol and beta-carotene are unlikely to be related to the risk of breast cancer.\r"

The case series consisted of 120 consecutive patients with histologically confirmed breast cancer admitted to either of two teaching hospitals over a 12-month period. The controls were 120 patients admitted to a teaching hospital for trauma and orthopedic conditions during the same period. Dietary histories concerning the frequency of consumption of 120 foods and drinks were obtained by interview. Nutrient intakes for individuals were estimated by multiplying the nutrient content of a selected typical portion size for each specified food item by the frequency that the food was used per month and summing these estimates for all food items. Cases reported significantly less frequent consumption of vitamin A after controlling for total caloric intake, potential external confounding variables and other nutrients associated with breast cancer risk. The odds ratio estimated for consumption of vitamin A equal to the value of the 90th centile versus consumption equal to the value of the 10th centile was 0.46 with 90% confidence limits 0.26-0.82. There was no evidence that high intake of dietary fat increases the risk of breast cancer.\r"

Unlike most African countries, however, disease occurred most commonly in teenagers and young adults. Nutritional status was poor in just under 50% of the patients. Clinically, the extent of disease at presentation was striking, with over 90% of patients having advanced stage disease in spite of the stated duration of symptoms being moderate. The histologic and clinical findings resembled those reported from other African countries, but in certain aspects the epidemiologic pattern was intermediate between those of affluent and underprivileged communities.\r"

The doxorubicin dose is approximately 33% to 42% of the typical single-agent dose, thus suggesting that the clinical toxicity from these two agents is additive.\r"

The EOD on the scan correlated with survival. The 2-year survival rates for EOD I to IV were 94%, 74%, 68%, and 40%, respectively. The survival of patients in categories EOD I and IV significantly differed from the other categories. Men with metastatic prostate cancer entered into trials designed to evaluate the impact of treatment on survival should be stratified based upon the EOD on the bone scan. This analysis also indicates that patients in the EOD IV category have a particularly poor prognosis and may be candidates for alternative treatments.\r"

Risk estimates from this case-control study are derived from self-administered comprehensive risk factor questionnaires distributed to newly registered patients at The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Hospital and Tumor Institute, Houston. Cases included 185 white patients with histologically confirmed squamous cell carcinoma of the upper aerodigestive tract. An equal number of age-frequency and sex-frequency matched patients was randomly selected from the same patient population excluding only patients with diagnoses of squamous cell carcinoma of any site. A statistically significant dose-response relationship for three categories of cigarette pack-years was evident for both males (odds ratios [OR] = 1.8, 4.0, and 7.5) and females (OR = 1.5, 9.0, and 12.0). Highest risks were documented for laryngeal cancer (OR = 15.1) and lingual cancer (OR = 14.5). There was interaction between alcohol use and smoking among men, but no independent effect of alcohol consumption among either gender. After 15 years of smoking abstinence, males no longer exhibited increased risk (OR = 1.0) whereas the risk for females after 15 years of cessation was 1.5. There were also significantly increased risks among men associated with snuff dipping, cigar, and pipe use (OR = 3.4, 2.8, and 1.8, respectively). The differences in the magnitude of the risk estimates and dose-response curves by subsite and by sex suggest a variable susceptibility to carcinogenic action.\r"

From January 1, 1981 until February 28, 1985, 93 patients were registered at the trial office from 54 participating institutions in West Germany, Austria, Switzerland, and the Netherlands. On February 1, 1987, 54 of 93 patients were disease-free. Using the Kaplan-Meier life table analysis, the estimated disease-free survival (DFS) rate was 60% at 36 months and 55% at 69 months. The median period of observation was 29 months, ranging from 22 months to 69 months. Twenty-one of 93 patients (23%) had local failure, 18 of 93 patients (19%) developed systemic metastases. The local failure rate was particularly high in patients treated with radiation and was reduced when radiation planning was centralized within the study based upon the extent of disease at diagnosis. Cox regression analysis of prognostic factors showed that tumor volume was a significant factor influencing prognosis. The estimated 3-year DFS rate was 80% for patients with small tumors (volume less than 100 ml) compared to 31% for patients with large tumors (volume greater than or equal to 100 ml). In patients who had surgery for local control, the histologic response to chemotherapy was analyzed on the surgical specimen and had a strong influence on survival: 79% DFS at 3 years for patients with less than 10% viable tumor (good responders) compared to 31% DFS for patients with more than 10% viable tumor (poor responders). Tumor load and responsiveness to chemotherapy are the two major factors influencing prognosis in patients with primary Ewing's sarcoma of bone.\r"

Twenty-two primary soft tissue sarcomas and their xenografts were compared histologically and flow cytometrically over numerous passages. More than 30% of transplants showed a variation in cell differentiation, cell content, frequency of mitosis, tendency to necrotize, and connective tissue content compared to the original tumor. Furthermore, transplants from various regions in one tumor showed divergent results. Analyses of serial transplants showed histologic and flow cytometrical discrepancies in about 50% of cases, and new cell lines occurred in 26%. Our results show that the genetic instability found in human neoplasias also applies to xenotransplants and that the therapy-related usefulness of the nude mouse model is limited.\r"

  ".W": "The analysis of 288 cases of polycythemia vera (PV) with a minimal follow-up of 10 years enabled us to study the characteristics of acute leukemia as observed in 33 patients (11.4%). In 50% of the patients (16 of 33), the malignant transformation is of the refractory anemia with excess of blasts (RAEB) type. Half of these further transform to acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL). Their life expectancy is not better than patients who abruptly develop ANLL. Leukemic transformation shows a frequency peak in the eighth year after initial evaluation in PV treated with chemotherapy and in the 11th year in patients treated with radiotherapy. In 30% of the patients myelofibrosis, or the spent phase of PV, is present before the transformation to acute leukemia (AL). This complication is, however, part of the natural history of PV and is observed in 20% of PV patients at 10 years when leukemic transformation is absent. Marrow fibrosis can therefore not be considered as a preleukemic phase. It was also noted that the occurrence of myeloid metaplasia/myelofibrosis is more frequent and begins earlier in patients treated by phlebotomy alone, and who do not transform to leukemia. The clinical characteristics of these AL, including high frequency of partial marrow invasion, difficulties in cytologic classification, a peak incidence similar to that in patients treated by chemotherapy or radiotherapy for a prior malignancy, multiple chromosome abnormalities, and poor response to therapy are all highly suggestive of secondary leukemias.\r"

In a group of 160 patients with a negative standard staging work-up, BMB was positive in two (1%). Both of them had negative x-ray but bone scan was positive in one and doubtful in the other. Bone marrow biopsy was positive in 31% of 13 additional patients with metastatic disease and in 44% of the nine among them with radiologically involved skeleton. These results exclude that BMB is able to discover micrometastatic foci of neoplastic disease. Its positivity appears strictly correlated with that of bone x-ray and scan. Based on the results of this prospective study, BMB is not required when both bone survey and scan are negative, but could be useful in clarifying diagnostic doubts of skeletal involvement.\r"
