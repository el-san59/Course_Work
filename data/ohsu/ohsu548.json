During this period, five cases of intra-atrial smoke-like echoes were diagnosed. The four patients with dense smoke-like echoes in the left atria all had echocardiographic evidence of severe mitral stenosis and thrombi in the left atrial cavity, both of which were confirmed at open-heart surgery. One patient with right-sided cardiomyopathy had echocardiographic evidence of dense smoke-like echoes and thrombus in the right atrial cavity. One of our five patients was receiving anticoagulant therapy, and none had a history of thromboembolism. We conclude that using conventional two-dimensional echocardiographic techniques, smoke-like echoes in the atria are a very infrequent finding and are very commonly associated with formation of thrombi.\r"

One hundred fourteen of these patients (88 percent) were available for follow-up at a mean length of time of 5.0 years from ileostomy closure (range, 16 to 88 months). The mean number of pouch evacuations was 5.4 +/- 2.5 during the day (range, 1 to 12) and 1.5 +/- 1.0 at night (range, 0 to 6). Ninety-one percent of patients reported perfect or almost perfect daytime continence, and 74 percent found this true at night. Sixty-three percent of patients believed their pouch function continued to improve over many years. Ninety-five percent of patients questioned would choose an ileoanal reservoir again instead of a permanent ileostomy. This long-term assessment of the function of the ileoanal reservoir confirms that it is a viable, although not perfect, option in the management of ulcerative colitis and familial adenomatous polyposis.\r"

Many modifications of the systems, with different standards of evidence, are currently used for a variety of purposes. It is not yet possible to readily exchange data from one staging system to another because of the lack of uniform anatomic and pathologic subdivisions. It would also be an advantage if staging systems more confidently predicted potential for cure. It is proposed that the TNM based system be modified to satisfy these requirements. Modifications identify common ground between the various systems, use prognostic variables shown to be significant by multivariate analyses, and introduce an abbreviated form of tumor grading. Grading improves prediction of cure and allows standardization of the composition of stages and substages because distant metastatic potential is shown to be related to the presence of high grade. The modifications are considered necessary and appropriate for epidemiologic and clinical studies.\r"

Average age at operation was 61 years; 15 (23 percent) were men and 50 (77 percent) were women. Operations included abdominoperineal resection in 37 patients (57 percent), low anterior resection in 20 patients (31 percent), and Hartmann procedure in 8 patients (12 percent). Additionally, 34 of 42 women (81 percent) with intact uteri underwent en bloc hysterectomy, 37 of 48 women (77 percent) with intact ovaries had oophorectomy, and 25 of 50 women (50 percent) had partial vaginal resection. Seventeen of the 65 patients (26 percent) had a cystectomy, and 2 patients had a portion of small intestine resected in continuity with their tumor. Pathologic examination revealed lymph node involvement in 29 patients (45 percent) and histologic confirmation of adjacent organ extension in 37 patients (57 percent). There were no perioperative deaths, the average survival was 5.7 years, and 25 patients (38 percent) were alive after a mean follow-up period of 9.3 years. Overall five-year survival was 52 percent. Forty patients died during the follow-up period, with 26 (65 percent) of the deaths attributable to either recurrent carcinoma (25 patients) or a new primary lesion (1 patient).

Fifteen complications required reoperation. Five of these procedures included stoma revision. Total numbers of complications were not related to the stoma site, the disease process, the urgency of the procedure, or the segment of colon used. Wound infections, however, were increased in urgently made stomas. The incidence of hernia was equivalent in stomas brought out through the incision or at a separate site. Forty-one patients (30 percent) had 43 colostomies closed an average of 3.5 months after creation. Thirteen patients had 14 complications--5 wound infections, 6 hernias, 2 small-bowel obstructions, and 1 rectovaginal fistula. One patient died. Four patients required reoperation. There were no anastomotic leaks. Complications were equivalent in Hartmann closures and transverse colostomy closures. Complications were similar in stomas created for cancer and those created for diverticular disease.\r"

The therapy was prescribed preoperatively most recently for 11 patients with rectal cancer. The authors used a radiofrequency system involving an endotract electrode with thermosensors for the hyperthermia. The effectiveness of preoperative HCR therapy was evaluated by irrigography, fiberscopy, and histopathologic findings in the resected specimens. Reduction in tumor size and amount was evident in all patients, with all modes of assessment. Histologically, no or only a few viable cancer cells were seen in the resected specimens in six patients, a small number of viable cancer cells in three, and a fair number of viable cancer cells in two patients; there were no complications. This method of treatment is expected to play an important role in the interdisciplinary treatment for rectal cancer.\r"

The results suggest that there is no advantage to the three-stage procedure except in the following circumstances: when urgent surgery is required for the complications of ulcerative colitis, when malignancy or Crohn's disease cannot be ruled out, and when a patient with active colitis has a combination of a low hemoglobin value (male less than 13.5 g/dl, female less than 11.5 g/dl), a low serum albumin level (less than 40 g/l), and is taking oral steroids.\r"

In spite of showing tumorigenicity in nude mice after subcutaneous injections, anchorage-independent clonal growth in soft agar, and invasion in the chick embryo skin, the Colo 205 cells failed to metastasize to the lung or liver after intrasplenic injections. The effects of interferon, and interferon in combination with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), on tumor formation in the spleen, were studied. The combined interferon- and 5-FU-treated animals displayed a significant difference from the controls in the generation of spleen tumors. This combination may possess potentially useful applications in the treatment of solid tumors such as those in the colon and rectum.\r"

  ".U": "89170464\r", 
  ".W": "Biosynthetic experiments were carried out in cultures of human malignant trophoblast cells (the JAR cell line) and in explants of normal first trimester human placental tissue to test the hypothesis that the O-glycosylation of the glycoprotein hormone alpha-subunit at Thr-39 regulates the assembly of the CG alpha beta dimer. This modification of alpha has been shown to ablate its ability to combine in vitro with the beta-subunit of bovine LH and might explain why JAR cells and placental explants secrete uncombined alpha- and beta-subunits in addition to the hCG alpha beta dimer. We have previously detected an O-linked carbohydrate chain at Thr-39 in preparations of secreted free alpha-subunit, but not dimer CG alpha from JAR culture medium. We report here evidence that the O-glycosylation of alpha does not regulate the biosynthetic assembly of the hCG dimer in cultures of JAR choriocarcinoma cells or first trimester placental explants. The intracellular precursor forms of alpha and beta that accumulate in the endoplasmic reticulum and combine in that compartment are not yet modified with O-linked carbohydrate, as determined by measurements of their [3H]galactosamine content after biosynthetic labeling of amino sugars with [3H]glucosamine. Furthermore, only half of the free alpha-subunit secreted by JAR cells and less than 10% of free alpha secreted by 10-week-old placental explants received the O-linked chain. This was shown by determining the ratio of the unglycosylated and glycosylated forms of the tryptic peptide from free alpha that contains the O-glycosylation site (residues 36-42). Based on these findings, we make the following conclusions. 1) O-Glycosylation of alpha-subunit is a late event in the secretory pathway of trophoblasts compared to the rapid combination in the rough endoplasmic reticulum of hCG subunit precursors to form alpha beta dimer. 2) Association of alpha with beta precludes the subsequent addition of the glycan to alpha at Thr-39. 3) The alpha molecules that fail to combine with beta in the endoplasmic reticulum are substrates for the later addition of O-linked carbohydrate, presumably in the Golgi complex, but only a fraction of the free alpha molecules are modified with O-linked carbohydrate.\r"

  ".W": "The free (uncombined) alpha-subunit of hCG is secreted in excess over alpha beta dimer from both malignant and nonmalignant trophoblast cells and is secreted ectopically from a variety of other malignant cell types. The free alpha-subunits from various sources are distinguishable from those that combine because they migrate more heterogeneously and more slowly on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) than dimer alpha. We have previously identified three posttranslational modifications that may contribute to the altered mobility of the free alpha-subunit and to its inability to combine with the beta-subunit: 1) preferential phosphorylation of the free alpha-subunit, 2) O-glycosylation of free alpha, and 3) differences in the processing of the asparagine-linked oligosaccharides between the free and combinable forms. We have purified three populations of the alpha-subunit from the JAR choriocarcinoma cell line and from ChaGo, a bronchogenic carcinoma cell line that ectopically synthesizes only the alpha-subunit, in order to identify the posttranslational modifications that contribute to the altered mobility on SDS-PAGE. Fractionation of the oligosaccharides released from the alpha forms with peptide N-glycosidase has shown that the faster migrating alpha forms on SDS-PAGE have less completely processed oligosaccharide chains. Twenty-two to 25% of the JAR free alpha and 35-41% of the ChaGo alpha forms that migrate the fastest on SDS-PAGE recombine with beta in an in vitro recombination assay under conditions where 62% of the dimer alpha form recombines. In contrast, only 5-12% and 16-21% of the JAR free alpha and ChaGo alpha forms, respectively, that migrate the slowest on SDS-PAGE recombine with beta. The form of JAR free alpha least capable of combining with beta contains on O-linked glycan on Thr-39. This same site is a substrate for phosphorylation by JAR cells. However, most of ChaGo alpha fails to recombine with beta even though ChaGo alpha contains little O-linked carbohydrate. These results suggest that the larger asparagine-linked complex glycans on the slower migrating alpha forms are the major limiting factor for subunit combination. Although these modifications may not be rate limiting for combination in the rough endoplasmic reticulum, they may prevent dimerization of the free subunits later in the secretory pathway.\r"

  ".W": "Steroid hormones are thought to play a role in controlling placental endocrine function. Since maternal free cortisol levels increase during gestation, and glucocorticoid receptors have been identified in placental tissue, we examined the effects of glucocorticoids on the production of CG by cultured human cytotrophoblasts. Treatment of cytotrophoblasts with 1 microM dexamethasone increased CG secretion by 6- to 10-fold over a 72-h period, whereas progesterone (1 microM) had no effect. The stimulatory effects of dexamethasone were blocked by the glucocorticoid antagonist RU 486, indicating a requirement for the glucocorticoid receptor. Intracellular accumulation of the CG alpha-subunit in response to dexamethasone was demonstrated by immunocytochemistry, and Northern blot analyses revealed that dexamethasone treatment increases CG alpha- and beta-subunit mRNA levels. Dexamethasone also enhanced the stimulatory effects of 8-bromo-cAMP on CG secretion. We conclude that glucocorticoids as well as cAMP modulate human trophoblast endocrine functions.\r"

  ".W": "We determined whether the reduction in placental progesterone (P4) production observed after administration of the antiestrogen ethamoxytriphetol (MER-25) to pregnant baboons was associated with a decline in activity and/or content of the placental mitochondrial cholesterol side-chain cleavage system (P-450scc). Pregnant baboons (Papio anubis) were untreated (n = 9) or administered MER-25 (25 mg/kg BW, orally; n = 6) daily on days 140-170 of gestation (term = 184 days). Placentas were obtained by cesarean section on day 170 of gestation, and P-450scc activity and cytochrome P-450 content were determined on mitochondria-rich fractions. Administration of MER-25 to pregnant baboons resulted in a 40% reduction (P less than 0.01, by Student's t test) in the mean (+/- SE) peripheral serum P4 concentration (6.3 +/- 0.3 ng/ml) compared to that in untreated (10.4 +/- 0.3 ng/ml) baboons. P-450scc activity, as determined by formation of pregnenolone (P5) and P4 during a 30-min incubation (picomoles per mg protein), was 37% lower (P less than 0.01) in placental mitochondria obtained from MER-25-treated baboons (179.8 +/- 25.0) than in that from untreated (285.4 +/- 13.4) baboons. Mitochondrial cytochrome P-450 content, assessed by spectral analysis, was 28% lower (P less than 0.02) in antiestrogen-treated (46.7 +/- 2.1 pmol/mg protein) than in untreated (64.8 +/- 5.2 pmol/mg protein) baboons. The initial (time zero) free cholesterol content (nanomoles per mg protein) of mitochondrial-rich preparations was not significantly different in antiestrogen-treated (189.3 +/- 13.0) and untreated (225.0 +/- 15.1) animals. Collectively, these results suggest that the decline in placental P4 production observed in baboons in response to MER-25 occurs at least in part as a result of a decrease in cytochrome P-450scc activity. The loss in P-450scc activity appears to be an intramitochondrial event and not a result of depletion of the total mitochondrial cholesterol pool. We propose, therefore, that one mechanism by which estrogen may regulate the production of P4 by the placenta during primate pregnancy is via the maintenance of placental mitochondrial cytochrome P-450, the terminal oxidase of cytochrome P-450scc.\r"

  ".U": "89170469\r", 
  ".W": "Serum hormone profiles for women and animals with cystic ovaries have led to the hypothesis that elevated serum LH and androgens are involved in the induction of ovarian follicular cysts. To test the ability of LH-like activity to induce cysts, immature rats (bearing progesterone implants to suppress endogenous LH secretion) were assigned to treatment groups that received 0 (control), 0.1, 0.5, or 1.5 IU hCG twice daily for 9 days beginning on day 27 of life. Serum progesterone concentrations were maintained at approximately 156 ng/ml throughout the in vivo treatment period. By the morning of day 36 (day 10 of treatment) the largest follicles in ovaries from control animals were at the small antral stage of development. In contrast, the largest follicles in ovaries from rats receiving 0.1, 0.5, and 1.5 IU hCG were primarily at the large antral, precystic, and cystic stages of development, respectively. On all days tested, progesterone, androstenedione, and estradiol accumulation in medium alone was greater for follicles from rats receiving hCG than for follicles from control rats. Progesterone and androstenedione increased in response to cAMP in vitro in follicular incubations from both control and hCG-treated animals. Only estradiol production by follicles from rats treated with 0.1 or 0.5 IU hCG increased in response to cAMP in vitro. Follicles from all treatment groups produced significantly more estradiol in the presence of a saturating amount of aromatizable substrate than in medium alone. Indeed, on day 36, cystic follicles produced more than 8 ng estradiol when incubated in the presence of either androstenedione or testosterone. In addition, more androstenedione was accumulated in vitro when developing cysts were incubated with exogenous testosterone than when noncystic follicles were incubated under similar conditions. The results of these experiments demonstrate that chronic stimulation by LH-like activity is capable of inducing follicular cysts in a time- and dose-related manner in intact noncycling immature rats. The ability of these cysts to produce 1-2 ng estradiol in medium alone and even greater amounts of estradiol in the presence of exogenous androgen indicates that inhibition of the ability of FSH to induce and stimulate follicular aromatase activity is not a prerequisite for the induction of follicular cysts in these animals. Finally, the increasing ability to accumulate androstenedione in the presence of exogenous testosterone suggests that follicular 17 beta-hydroxysteroid oxidoreductase activity increases in response to chronic stimulation by low doses of LH-like activity during the development of follicular cysts.\r"

  ".W": "The role of cytosolic T3-binding protein (CTBP) in the regulation of nuclear T3 binding was studied in vitro. Nuclear [125I]T3 binding was observed in the presence of 1.0 mM dithiothreitol (DTT). When the nuclei prepared from rat kidney were incubated with inactive form of CTBP which was also prepared from rat kidney, [125I]T3 binding to nuclei was not affected. When the nuclei were incubated with inactive form of CTBP in the presence of NADP, [125I]T3 binding to nuclei was increased, whereas binding was diminished when nuclei were incubated with CTBP in the presence of NADPH. The inactive form of CTBP was activated by NADPH. NADP also activated CTBP in the presence of DTT. Both active forms of CTBP were again inactivated by extraction with charcoal, and these inactive forms were reactivated by NADPH or by NADP and DTT, but not by NADP alone. Although the nuclei treated with 0.3 M NaCl lost the binding activity for [125I]T3 in the absence of NADP, the nuclei retained the binding activity for [125I]T3 in the presence of NADP and the inactive form of CTBP. Treatment of the nuclei with 0.5 M NaCl lost the binding activity for [125I]T3 not only in the absence but also in the presence of NADP and CTBP. These results suggested that NADP and NADPH play roles as counterregulatory factors for nuclear T3 binding in the presence of CTBP. Further, it was speculated that binding sites for the T3-CTBP complex, which is generated in the presence of NADP and DTT, are present in nuclei, and that binding sites for the complex are different from nuclear T3 receptors.\r"

  ".W": "The osteoclast is the cell that resorbs bone. It is known to derive from hemopoietic precursors, and a series of recent experiments has used enumeration of the tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP)-positive multinucleate cells that develop in cultures of hemopoietic tissue as a means to analyze the regulation of osteoclast generation. These multinucleate cells have never been definitively characterized as osteoclasts, however, and we elected to assess the relationship among bone resorption (the primary function of the osteoclast), TRAP, and multinuclearity in mouse bone marrow cultures. Mouse bone marrow cells and peritoneal macrophages were incubated on plastic coverslips or bone slices for up to 14 days in the presence or absence of 1 alpha, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1 alpha,25-(OH)2D3]. Osteoclast generation, as judged by bone resorption, occurred in marrow cell cultures only in the presence of 1 alpha,25-(OH)2D3. However, TRAP-positive multinuclear cells developed both with and without the hormone. The multinuclear cells bound F4/80, a marker for macrophages that does not bind to osteoclasts. Peritoneal macrophages became multinucleate and developed TRAP positivity in culture to levels similar to those in freshly isolated osteoclasts, especially with 1 alpha,25-(OH)2D3, but remained nonresorptive. In cultures of marrow cells incubated with 1 alpha,25-(OH)2D3 bone resorption was more extensive than could readily be accounted for by the number of multinucleate cells present, and the size of excavations and extent of resorption suggested a major contribution by mononuclear cells with osteoclastic function. Thus, while TRAP and multinuclearity are reliable markers for osteoclastic phenotype in bone, they are unreliable markers in culture. Experiments designed to evaluate the regulation of osteoclast generation through enumeration of TRAP-positive multinucleate cells formed in bone marrow cultures will not only overstate, to an unknown and probably variable degree, the number of multinucleate osteoclasts that develop, but will also fail to even identify what may be a considerable and more substantial population of mononuclear cells that possess osteoclastic characteristics.\r"

  ".U": "89170476\r", 
  ".W": "GnRH regulates the secretion of LH and FSH, which stimulate the secretion of testicular hormones. Acting in a reciprocal fashion, these hormones, including testosterone and inhibin, exert a negative feedback effect on GnRH and gonadotropin secretion. Endogenous opioid peptides (EOPs) have been implicated to play a role in steroid-mediated regulation of gonadotropin secretion. In this context, certain steroid hormones (e.g. testosterone) increase EOP activity and ultimately inhibit GnRH secretion; however, the cellular mechanism by which this occurs is unknown. beta-Endorphin is one of these EOPs, and it is derived from a larger precursor molecule, POMC. We tested the hypothesis that testicular hormones and testosterone, in particular, stimulate POMC gene expression in the arcuate nucleus of the male rat brain. First, we compared POMC mRNA levels between intact and castrated male rats. Adult male rats were killed 4 days (n = 4) and 21 days (n = 5) after castration. Intact animals (sham-operated; n = 6) were used as controls. Using in situ hybridization and a computerized image analysis system, we measured the POMC mRNA content in individual cells of the arcuate nucleus. POMC mRNA signal was significantly lower (P less than 0.0003) in both 4-day (126 +/- 2 grains/cell) and 21-day (117 +/- 5 grains/cell) castrates than in controls (142 +/- 2 grains/cell). In a second experiment we tested whether testosterone would reverse the castration-induced loss of POMC message. Again, we castrated animals and immediately implanted them with either empty (sham; n = 6) or testosterone-containing Silastic implants (n = 5) of a size that would deliver physiological levels of testosterone (3.6 +/- 1.5 ng/ml). We observed that testosterone-treated animals had significantly higher levels of POMC mRNA signal (121.8 +/- 3.8 grains/cell) than sham-treated castrates (111.4 +/- 3.6 grains/cell; P less than 0.03) and that the testosterone-treated castrates had POMC mRNA signal levels indistinguishable from those of intact controls (122.0 +/- 1.1 grains/cell). These observations lend credence to the theory that one mechanism by which testosterone may regulate GnRH secretion is by increasing the synthesis of POMC in the arcuate nucleus.\r"

  ".W": "The estrogenic and antiestrogenic activities of derivatives of estradiol and estrone were determined in vitro using the ability of primary cultures of immature rat pituitary cells to synthesize PRL. Estradiol derivatives were the most potent estrogens in the assay. Large ethinyl substitutions in the 17 alpha position generally caused a decrease in estrogenic potency (up to 1000-fold). The 3 phenolic hydroxyl was important, but not essential, for the estrogenic activity of the estradiol molecule. Estratriene was approximately 1000 times less potent than estradiol. However, significant estrogenic activity was observed with the compound anordin (EC50, 8 x 10(-9) M), which could potentially be converted to a dihydroxylated derivative but without an aromatic A ring. Similarly, the steroid androst-5-ene-3,17-diol was weakly estrogenic (EC50, 3 x 10(-8) M). Steriods with a ketone in the A and D rings were generally inactive as estrogens and antiestrogens. Estradiol derivatives with 17 beta amines were only weak estrogens. Estrone derivatives were less active than the corresponding estradiol derivatives. 4-Nitromethoxyestrone exhibited weak antiestrogenic properties; however, 4-nitroestrone and methoxyestrone were both estrogens. The reason for the antiestrogenic properties of 4-nitromethoxyestrone is obscure, as the compound does not have structural features similar to those of known nonsteroidal antiestrogens. Minor alterations to the estradiol molecule at the 11 beta (OH) or 6 (ketone) position had little effect on estrogenic potency; however, large substitutions at the 11 beta (RU 39,411) or 7 alpha (ICI 164384) position produced antiestrogenic compounds. RU 39,411 was approximately 10 times more active as an antiestrogen than 4-hydroxytamoxifen, whereas ICI 164,384 was approximately 10 times less active than 4-hydroxytamoxifen. A series of hypothetical models is proposed that could explain the antiestrogenic properties of RU 39,411 and ICI 164,384 by an interaction with the estrogen receptor steroid-binding site.\r"

  ".W": "We have used the rat C6 glial cell line as a model system to study the role of insulin-like growth factors (IGF) in neuroglial cells of the central nervous system (CNS). Northern blot analysis of C6 RNA demonstrated the presence of IGF-I mRNA and undetectable IGF-II mRNA. IGF-I and IGF-binding protein(s), but not IGF-II, were detected in C6 glial cell-conditioned medium. The level of IGF-I was 1-4 ng/ml in conditioned medium based on a human IGF-I standard. The immunoreactive IGF-I inhibited [125I]IGF-I binding to the IGF-I receptor on chick embryo fibroblasts and stimulated [3H]thymidine incorporation into chick embryo fibroblast DNA. Competitive binding and affinity cross-linking experiments using [125]IGF-I and [125I]IGF-II demonstrated the presence of IGF-I receptors (type I) and IGF-II/mannose 6-phosphate receptors (type II) on C6 glial cell membranes. An immunoglobulin (no. 3637) directed against the rat IGF-II receptor blocked the degradation of [125I]IGF-II added to C6 glial cells, presumably by blocking receptor-mediated internalization. We were unable to demonstrate an autocrine role for IGF in the C6 glial cell line, since [3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA was stimulated equally well by IGF-I-deficient rat serum and normal serum, and added IGF did not stimulate [3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA when tested alone or when added to IGF-I-deficient serum. We propose that neuroglial cell-derived IGF-I may serve as a paracrine growth stimulus in the central nervous system.\r"

Adult male rats were injected with STZ (50 mg/kg) or vehicle and tested for copulatory behavior 7, 14, and 21 days later. The rats were killed 1 month after STZ or vehicle treatment for measurement of plasma hormone levels, hypothalamic catecholamine turnover, LHRH content, and in vitro pituitary function. The STZ rats showed significant deficits in mount, intromission, and ejaculatory behaviors. Plasma levels of testosterone, LH, FSH, and PRL were all significantly reduced in the STZ compared to the control rats, but in vitro LH secretion was enhanced after STZ treatment. In vitro PRL secretion and the inhibitory response to dopamine did not differ between the two groups. The levels of LHRH were reduced in the medial basal hypothalamus (MBH), but LHRH levels in the median eminence (ME) and anterior hypothalamus (AH) were unchanged after STZ treatment. Norepinephrine turnover was reduced in the ME, MBH, and AH of the STZ rats, while dopamine turnover was unchanged in the ME, increased in the MBH, and reduced in the AH of the STZ rats compared to those in the vehicle-treated controls. These results suggest that changes in pituitary and testicular function in rats made diabetic by STZ treatment are secondary to changes in hypothalamic catecholamine metabolism. Changes in copulatory behavior could be due to both reductions in plasma testosterone levels as well as changes in central neurotransmitter metabolism.\r"

While varying immune responsiveness may be due to qualitative and quantitative T and B cell differences, the role of thyroid cell MHC class II antigens may be pivotal to the onset of autoimmune thyroiditis in such animal models. We, therefore, examined the induction of MHC class II antigens in thyroid monolayers derived from Buffalo and Fisher rats treated with methimazole (0.1% in their water) for 4 weeks to induce mild thyroid hyperplasia. After thyroidectomy, thyroid cell monolayers were prepared and exposed to recombinant rat gamma-interferon (gamma IF; 10-1000 U/ml) for 1-7 days in the presence and absence of TSH (1 mU/ml). Both Buffalo and Fisher thyroid monolayers responded to gamma IF with MHC class II antigen expression when assessed by laser flow cytometry using MRC OX-6 monoclonal anti-RT1.B. In both types of culture, TSH enhanced MHC class II antigen expression in the presence of gamma IF to the same degree. However, there was a consistently earlier and greater degree of MHC class II antigen expression in Buffalo thyroid monolayers compared to Fisher monolayers, a phenomenon not explicable on the basis of fibroblast contamination as assessed by cytokeratin staining. These data demonstrate that end-organ sensitivity to MHC class II antigen expression may be important in the pathogenesis of autoimmune thyroid disease.\r"

Prenatal exposure to PGE2 and PGF2 alpha on days 11-17 of gestation (the critical period of the differentiation) increased the anogenital distance of the female fetuses in a dose-dependent manner. PGE2 also increased the anogenital distance of male fetuses in the presence of an inhibitor of testosterone synthesis, namely estradiol (2 mg/kg.day), and in the androgen-insensitive Tfmy males. Internally, PGE2 induced the epididymal duct in the females, estrogen-exposed males, and Tfmy males. However, no other changes were noticed in the internal genital tract of these fetuses. To avoid the problems associated with the placental transfer of any external agent, we also studied the effect of PGE2 in an in vitro system. Female genital ducts on day 13 of gestation were cultured in the presence and absence of different concentrations of PGE2 for a total of 6 days. PGE2 at doses 0.2 and 1 microgram/ml induced and stimulated the Wolffian and epididymal ducts. Thus, PGs appear to have a masculinizing role in androgen-induced sexual differentiation.\r"

AS was induced by 1 h of music (less than or equal to 86 decibels) played through earphones and was accompanied by a 382% maximal rise in plasma cortisol after 15-30 min. Administered orally 30 min before the AS session, both U-50488 (0.1 mg/kg) and PD 117-302 (0.05 mg/kg) significantly (P less than or equal to 0.01) decreased (by 71.2% and 80.9%, respectively) the maximal increase in plasma cortisol induced by AS, while bremazocine, morphine, as well as iv administration of U-50488 at similar doses were ineffective. The effects of U-50488 and PD 117-302 orally administered (0.1 mg/kg) on the hypercortisolemia induced by AS were abolished by pretreatment with iv naloxone (0.1 mg/kg) or MR 2266 (0.1 mg/kg). Naloxone given alone significantly (P less than 0.01) increased basal plasma cortisol, without affecting cortisol increase induced by AS. Vagotomy abolished the effects of orally administered U-50488 on the AS-induced increase in plasma cortisol. Neither U-50488 nor PD 117302 (0.1 mg/kg, orally) reduced the increase in plasma cortisol induced by intracerebroventricular administration of ovine CRF (100 ng/kg). It is concluded that kappa- but not mu-opioid agonists are able to inhibit the stimulation of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenocortical axis induced by AS by acting selectively on peripheral kappa-receptors located in the wall of the proximal gut. This action is neurally mediated through afferent vagal fibers affecting central nervous system release of CRF induced by a centrally acting stressor.\r"

The interaction of these inhibitors of GH was, therefore, tested in primary rat pituitary cells grown in serum-free medium. Maximal inhibition of GH secretion (to 30% of the control value) was achieved by 13 nM IGF-I, while 5 nM SRIF suppressed GH to 36% of control secretion. The respective ED50 values for IGF-I and SRIF inhibition of GH secretion were similar (approximately 2.5 nM). Treatment of cells with the two agents together resulted in a further inhibition of basal GH secretion to 18% of control untreated cells (P less than 0.005). Increasing doses of SRIF (2.5-10 nM) in the presence of IGF-I caused a dose-dependent suppression of GH secretion. PRL levels were not altered by these treatments, indicating a selective effect on GH. GRH-induced GH secretion was further attenuated by combined IGF-I and SRIF treatment compared to the effect of either of these two agents alone. Northern analysis showed that IGF-I suppressed GH mRNA transcripts, while SRIF did not alter GH mRNA levels. The results indicate that physiological concentrations of both IGF-I and SRIF suppress long term basal GH secretion. Only IGF-I alters GH mRNA levels. These two peptides, therefore, appear to attenuate in vitro GH secretion by different mechanisms.\r"

  ".W": "The ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus (VMN) is thought to constitute an essential neural substrate for hormonal induction of female sexual behavior. In previous work, implants of dilute (0.4%) estradiol (E2) have been found to prime progesterone-facilitated female sexual behavior in rats only when they are within or very close to the VMN. In other studies, induction of cytosolic progestin receptors (PRc) in the hypothalamus has been correlated with systemic E2 priming of receptive behavior. We combined dilute E2 implants with a Palkovits punch microassay for PRc in the an effort to examine the relationship between estrous behavior and estrogen-induced PRc in the VMN of individual female rats. Ovariectomized rats were given bilateral guide cannulae aimed at the VMN and were primed for 3 days with 1) blank implants plus oil sc, 2) blank implants plus 0.5 micrograms E2 benzoate sc, 3) implants of 0.4% E2 in cholesterol, or 4) implants of 2.0% E2. On day 4 all rats received progesterone (P) sc and were tested for receptive behavior. The following week all subjects received the same estrogen-priming treatment but were killed on day 4 without P treatment. The VMN was punch dissected and assayed for PRc. High levels of lordosis were seen in the E2 benzoate-treated and 2.0% E2-implanted animals, while little behavior was seen in the oil-treated animals. Among 0.4% E2-implanted animals, higher levels of lordosis were observed in subjects with implant placements in the rostral than in the caudal VMN; however, lordosis quotients were not correlated with PRc induction measured in the entire VMN of individual animals. In general, our findings suggest that local estrogenic stimulation of target cells in the VMN is capable of both priming the estrous response and induction of P receptors. Whether these two effects are causally related awaits future study.\r"

Thiocyanate-induced transformation to the DNA-binding species was also accompanied by a 2.1-fold decrease in the rate of [3H]aldosterone dissociation from type I receptors as well as by an increase in the apparent positive charge and hydrophobicity of the surface of these receptors, as revealed by DEAE Bio-Gel ion exchange and pentyl agarose hydrophobic interaction chromatography. Sucrose density gradient sedimentation and Sephacryl S-300 gel exclusion chromatography revealed a reduction in the sedimentation coefficient and Stokes radius of the steroid-receptor complex from 9.6S and 8.0 nm before to 4.7S and 6.1 nm after transformation, respectively. These changes in hydrodynamic parameters were found to correspond to a 2.8-fold reduction in the apparent molecular mass from 331,000 before to 120,000 after transformation. In view of these various findings as well as the known differential affinity of protamine sulfate for the 90K heat shock protein, we suggest that thiocyanate-induced transformation is initiated by the dissociation of two molecules of heat shock protein from each steroid/DNA-binding type I receptor subunit.\r"

Since the mutation has been linked to the thyroglobulin (TG) gene, we have studied the immunological and physical properties of TG in cog/cog mice. +/Cog mice, which are phenotypically normal, were used as controls. In a mouse TG RIA the displacement curve produced by cog/cog thyroid extract was not parallel to normal murine TG, and at maximum displacement 15.4% of the tracer was still bound to the antibody. Extract from +/cog thyroid tissue produced parallel and complete displacement. Sucrose density gradient velocity centrifugation followed by RIA was used to determine the sedimentation properties of cog/cog TG. An abnormal pattern was obtained; a small peak in the 3-8S area and a broad, poorly defined peak at 12S and extending to above 27S were present. By comparison, +/cog thyroids had sharp peaks at 19S and 27S. These findings suggest that normal TG contains some immunological determinants that are absent, and some that are altered, in cog/cog TG. They also indicate that the association of 12S subunits to form 19S TG in cog/cog mice is weak and abnormal. Thyroid tissue was labeled with Na125I in vivo and with [35S] methionine in vitro. In cog/cog mice iodine was incorporated predominantly into albumin and other non-TG proteins. However, by polyacrylamide gradient gel electrophoresis, distinct 125I-labeled bands comigrating with normal TG were present. The bands migrating with TG were also precipitable with anti-TG antiserum. In +/cog mice TG was the predominant iodinated molecule. With [35S]methionine labeling, cog/cog and +/cog thyroids formed TG with the same electrophoretic mobilities. These data indicate the cog/cog thyroids synthesize TG of normal, or very nearly normal, size. The immunological and sedimentation properties of this TG are abnormal, supporting the possibility that the cog mutation is in the TG gene.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) on thymidine incorporation into DNA and glucose and neutral amino acid uptake were studied in endothelial cells cultured from macrovessels (bovine aorta and pulmonary artery) and microvessels (bovine fat and mouse brain). Similar to previous studies, PDGF did not bind to macrovessel cells, nor did it influence their metabolic function. In contrast, PDGF bound specifically to the two types of microvessel cell culture and in these cells also stimulated the uptake of glucose and neutral amino acids as well as the incorporation of thymidine into DNA. Stimulatory effects of PDGF occurred at concentrations of 2 ng/ml, with maximal stimulation up to 5-fold of the control value for amino isobutyric acid and glucose uptake and up to 8- to 10-fold for thymidine incorporation. The maximal effects of PDGF were additive to those of insulin-like growth factor, I, a known stimulator of all three metabolic processes in microvessel endothelial cells. The binding of PDGF to the endothelial cells was, in general, equivalent to PDGF binding to human foreskin fibroblasts, both in the magnitude of tracer binding and in the affinity of binding. Similar effects were found with recombinant and platelet-derived PDGF. We conclude that these two cultured microvessel endothelial cells not only produce PDGF-like material, but are capable of binding and responding to PDGF.\r"

  ".W": "Although high density lipoprotein (HDL) is a promoter of cholesterol efflux from peripheral cells, in steroidogenic tissues it has been shown to provide cholesterol for steroid synthesis. The present study examines the dynamics of cholesterol exchange between HDL particles and rat luteal cells. Cholesterol influx was measured by following the uptake of label from HDL particles labeled with [3H]cholesterol or [3H]cholesteryl linoleate. The efflux of cholesterol was simultaneously measured by incubating [3H]cholesterol-labeled luteal cells with unlabeled HDL. Conversion of endogenous and lipoprotein-derived steroids to progestins was also determined. The results showed that HDL promotes both influx and efflux of cholesterol in those cells. The amount of influx exceeds efflux, thus resulting in a net uptake of cholesterol from HDL by rat luteal cells. The relative utilization of endogenous vs. HDL-derived cholesterol for steroid synthesis was also examined. The results show that only a fraction of the HDL-derived cholesterol was converted directly to steroids. The fraction that was converted depended on the HDL concentration and had no apparent relation to the incubation time. These results show that although cholesterol flux in luteal cells is bidirectional in the presence of HDL, the influx exceeds the amount of efflux, and the internalized cholesterol is diluted with the endogenous cholesterol pool before it is converted to steroids.\r"

This study analyzed the acute changes induced by E2 in proteins synthesized in the VMN in vivo as measured by 35S incorporation into protein, two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, autoradiography, and computerized optical densitometry. Ovariectomized rats received vehicle or E2, Hamilton syringes were placed stereotaxically in the VMN bilaterally, and 0.9 mCi 35S-labeled methionine and cysteine was infused over 1 h. After 6 h, rats were killed, and VMN samples were subjected to isoelectric focusing and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Resultant gels underwent autoradiography, and the optical density of each of 240 spots was quantitated using a flat-bed laser scanner. Using a quantitation algorithm based on the linearity and reproducibility of the scanner and film, 123 spots were analyzed for changes in optical density and relative mol wt (MW) and isoelectric point (pI) induced by E2. The spot induced most prominently by E2 had a MW of 70K and a pI of 6.0, confirming previous results. Three spots were quantitatively induced by E2: 1) a 47K MW, pI 5.4 phosphoprotein (96% induction); 2) a 45K MW, pI 5.2 protein (72% induction); and 3) a 100K MW, pI 5.5 protein (82% induction). Two spots increased pI with E2: 1) a 110K MW protein increased from pI 5.4 to 5.5; and 2) a 50K MW protein increased from pI 6.3 to 6.4. Under these conditions and using a quantitative algorithm, only a small number of proteins synthesized in the VMN were induced by E2 in vivo. E2 also exerts effects on the posttranslational modification of another select group of proteins. These proteins may subserve at least part of the physiological effect of E2 in the VMN.\r"

  ".W": "We have found a complex alteration in the expression of the glucose transporter protein and mRNA in developing rat brain tissue. Before birth (gestational days 19-20), the rat brain glucose transporter was comprised of a diffuse protein doublet of approximately 43,000 and 50,000 mol wt (Mr) by Western blot analysis. Immediately after birth (1-2 days), the total amount of immunoreactive glucose transporter decreased approximately 5-fold, primarily due to a loss of the higher (50,000) Mr component with a relatively smaller decrease in the 43,000 Mr band. Subsequently, the amount of the 43,000 Mr band progressively increased from days 5 to 60 and the 50,000 Mr band increased from days 15 to 60. By 60 days postdelivery, the relative amounts of the glucose transporter protein were similar to those on the 19th gestational day. N-Glycanase treatment of the developing rat brain membranes demonstrated that the regulation of the two different Mr weight glucose transporter species occurred as a result of differential glycosylation. In contrast to the Western blot analysis, [3H] cytochalasin-B binding studies demonstrated no significant developmental alteration in the total amount of glucose transporter protein in rat brain tissue. However, consistent with the Western blots, Northern blot analysis using rat brain transporter cDNA revealed a dramatic decrease in the content of the glucose transporter mRNA immediately subsequent to birth, followed by a gradual increase back to the prenatal levels. These data suggest that the rat brain-type glucose transporter is developmentally regulated, but may be associated with the compensatory expression of another unidentified glucose transporter protein in newborn rats.\r"

  ".W": "The binding characteristics of 125I-labeled Leu15-gastrin and the molecular identification of the gastrin receptor was investigated in dispersed guinea pig gastric glands. The binding of [125I]gastrin to gastric glands was temperature dependent, saturable, and specific. At 37 C, the binding was rapid, became maximal within 10 min, and declined after 30 min; at 24 C, binding reached a steady state between 30 and 60 min. The dissociation of specifically bound gastrin was also rapid, with 35% of the radioligand dissociating in 5 min at 37 C. Gastrin displaced [125I]gastrin in a dose-dependent manner, with 50% displacement at 4.4 nM. Scatchard analysis of the saturation curve was best described by a one-site binding model with a Kd of 2.3 nM and maximum binding of 6.0 x 10(-10) M/mg DNA. A significant reduction of [125I]gastrin binding to glands occurred in the presence of GTP (0.1 mM), (Bu)2-cGMP (1.0 mM), and protease inhibitors. Chemical cross-linking studies using the cross-linking reagent disuccinimidyl suberate and sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis identified a major band with a mol wt of 78K and several other lower mol wt bands in the range of 60K, 48K, and 38K. Identical electrophoretic patterns were obtained when glands were bound and solubilized in the presence and absence of dithiothreitol, showing the lack of disulfide bonds in the gastrin receptor subunit structure. Since dithiothreitol significantly enhanced radioligand binding when present during binding, its observed actions are most likely in the intracellular processing of the radioligand and not at the receptor level.\r"

  ".W": "Recent studies on the regulation of aldosterone biosynthesis have revealed that inhibitors of sodium influx, e.g. amiloride, can inhibit adrenal steroidogenesis with a pharmacological profile suggestive of a Na+/H+ antiport system. We have examined the existence of a Na+/H+ antiport system and its regulation of Na influx and intracellular pH (pHi) in bovine adrenal zona glomerulosa cells. NH4Cl-induced 22Na uptake by zona glomerulosa cells was dose dependently inhibited by ethylisopropylamiloride (EIPA), amiloride, and benzamil with ED50 values of 0.02, 4.30, and 199 microM, respectively. Angiotensin II (AII; 100 nM) caused an initial transient acidification, followed by prolonged alkalinization. The hormone equipotently increased pHi and stimulated aldosterone secretion, with ED50 values of 1.2 and 1.4 nM, respectively. AII-induced alkalinization was suppressed by EIPA, amiloride, and benzamil, with ED50 values of 0.6, 79, and 440 microM, respectively. This increase in pHi induced by AII was dependent upon the extracellular sodium concentration (ED50 values = 2.8 mM) and was blunted in sodium-free medium. AII-stimulated aldosterone synthesis was also inhibited by EIPA, amiloride, and benzamil, with ED50 values of 0.07, 34, and 330 microM, respectively. The time course of activation by angiotensin II on aldosterone secretion was also dependent upon extracellular sodium concentration during a 2-h period. These results document that intracellular pH is regulated through the Na+/H+ exchange system and suggest that the pH change induced by AII might be associated with its regulation of steroidogenesis in bovine adrenal zona glomerulosa cells.\r"

  ".W": "The present studies were undertaken to explore further the mechanism by which T3 increases adenylate cyclase activity and the uptake of the sugar analog 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) in freshly isolated rat thymocytes. In studies of cells preloaded with the fluorescent probe quin-2, whose fluorescence intensity increases linearly with increases in cytoplasmic free calcium concentration [( Ca2+]i), we have now demonstrated that T3 increases [Ca2+]i in thymocytes suspended in buffer containing 1 mM Ca2+. This effect was extremely prompt, becoming evident much less than 1 min after the addition of T3 and reaching maximal values in about 5-8 min. The subsequent time course of the T3 effect was obscured by an increase in fluorescence intensity in control thymocytes not exposed to T3, beginning after about 8 min of incubation. However, the T3 effect, after reaching its peak, appeared to remain stable for about 5 min and then to decline, abating completely in 18-30 min. No effect of T3 on [Ca2+]i was observed when thymocytes were suspended in Ca2+-free medium. The effect of T3 on [Ca2+]i was concentration dependent, and as with its actions on thymocyte adenylate cyclase activity, cAMP concentration and 2-DG uptake, the lowest effective concentration of T3 was 1 nM. Among several thyronine analogs studied, L-T3 was the most potent, followed in decreasing order of potency by L-T4, D-T3, 3,5-diiodo-3'-isopropyl-L-thyronine, and D-T4. rT3, 3,5-diiodo-L-thyronine, and D,L-thyronine were without effect. l-Alprenolol alone (10 microM) produced a modest increase in thymocyte [Ca2+]i, but, as it does with the effect of T3 on cellular cAMP concentration and 2-DG uptake, it markedly inhibited or abolished the stimulatory effect of T3 on [Ca2+]i. From these observations we conclude that T3 initiates the increase in thymocyte [Ca2+]i by enhancing the influx of extracellular calcium, though the possibility that it also releases calcium from an intracellular calcium pool cannot be excluded. Since the effects of T3 on thymocyte adenylate cyclase activity, cAMP concentration, and 2-DG uptake occur subsequent to these effects on calcium metabolism and require the presence of Ca2+ in the extracellular fluid, we suggest that an increase in [Ca2+]i, due at least partly to an influx of extracellular calcium, is the initiating event in these plasma membrane-mediated responses of the rat thymocyte to T3.\r"

GCs were harvested from human preovulatory follicles in the course of oocyte retrieval for in vitro fertilization. Cells grown on ECM secreted by bovine corneal endothelial cells (BCE) produced significantly higher amounts of progesterone (up to 3-fold) than cells on uncoated dishes. Culturing of cells on BCE-ECM in the presence of hCG resulted in a further increase in progesterone production; in the first 2 days an additive effect was noted, and on days 3, 4, and 5 a synergistic effect became evident (1.2- to 1.8-fold above the sum of the individual treatments). LH/hCG receptor content on day 3 of culture was 4-fold higher in GCs grown on BCE-ECM compared to that in uncoated dishes. A similar elevation was found when cells were grown on ECM secreted by PFHR-9 mouse endodermal cells. Cells grown on both types of ECM maintained their epithelioid shape but, in addition, formed cytoplasmic processes interconnected with neighboring cells by gap junctions. Morphometric analysis revealed that the area of cell membrane occupied by gap junctions increased by 3- to 4-fold on ECM compared to that in cells grown on plastic. Enlargement of endoplasmic reticulum was evident on ECM along with clustering of numerous mitochondria, lipid droplets, and lysosomes characteristic of highly luteinized cells. Cells grown in the presence of hCG on ECM showed morphological modulation similar to that of cells cultured on ECM alone. These observations suggest that growing of human GCs on a ECM similar to a naturally produced basement membrane enhances morphological and biochemical differentiation, and that ECM and gonadotropin affect synergistically the extent of luteinization in these cells.\r"

The initial rate of T3 uptake was energy dependent and saturable with both a high affinity (Km = 3.6 nM) and a low affinity (Km = 503 nM) process. Phloretin produced a dose-dependent decrease in [125I]T3 uptake by Hep G2 cells (IC50 = 88 microM) and also inhibited nuclear uptake in intact cells and isolated nuclei. The solubilized nuclear receptor in the Hep G2 cells had a Kd of 0.14 nM for T3. Phloretin inhibited [125I]T3 binding to the solubilized nuclear receptor by competitive inhibition. Phlorizin, the beta-D-glucoside of phloretin, had no effect on T3 binding to the solubilized nuclear receptor. The inhibition of T3 cellular uptake and nuclear receptor binding is probably due to structural similarities between T3 and phloretin.\r"

Dopamine synthesis and release in vitro by TIDA neurons were determined by 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) accumulation in the median eminence and endogenous dopamine release from the median eminence, respectively. Three weeks after a single injection of 2 mg estradiol valerate into ovariectomized rats, there was a marked increase in the weight of anterior pituitaries and the concentration of serum PRL, but a decrease in K+-induced DOPA accumulation in vitro in the median eminence. Twelve weeks after estradiol treatment, by which time pituitary weights and PRL concentrations declined considerably, K+-induced DOPA accumulation in the median eminence rose 5-fold compared to that in control animals. This change in DOPA accumulation persisted for 24 weeks. Increases were observed at 12 weeks in K+-induced as well as basal and (Bu)2cAMP-induced DOPA accumulation in the median eminence. The increases in basal and (Bu2cAMP-induced DOPA accumulation were not altered by Ca2+ removal from medium. In parallel to the changes in DOPA accumulation, basal and K+-induced release in vitro of dopamine from the median eminence into the medium were decreased 3 weeks after estradiol treatment, but increased at 12 and, in part, 24 weeks. The increases in basal and K+-induced dopamine release were observed even after Ca2+ removal from medium. These results suggest that basal, extracellular Ca2+-dependent, and cAMP-dependent dopamine synthesis as well as basal and depolarization-induced dopamine release in TIDA neurons are stimulated during the period of involution of pituitary tumors associated with estradiol withdrawal.\r"

We have previously demonstrated prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) release in amnion after treatment with phorbol and oxytocin, but other potential agonists of the inositol phospholipid/protein kinase-C system have not been investigated. The effects of extracellular ATP on cytosolic calcium concentration [( Ca2+])i) inositol phosphate (IP) accumulation, and PGE2 production were studied in cultured human amnion cells. Intracellular free calcium [Ca2+]i was measured using the fluorescent dye fura-2. Addition of 0.01-30 microM ATP resulted in a [Ca2+]i transient which peaked within 15 sec and returned to baseline over 10 min. UTP (1 microM) was more effective than ATP (1 microM); [Ca2+]i levels rose from 233 to 2880 nM (UTP) and 2320 nM (ATP). A reduced effect was observed with other nucleotides in a rank order of agonist potency of ITP greater than CTP greater than ADP greater than GTP greater than TTP. No effect was seen with AMP, cAMP, or adenosine. This is consistent with P2 purinoceptors, as described in other tissues. ATP (100 microM) also dramatically increased IP accumulation. Inositol triphosphate, inositol bisphosphate, and inositol monophosphate were increased 7-, 9-, and 16-fold respectively. The agonist potency order of other nucleotides for IP accumulation was the same as that of [Ca2+]i. Pharmacological concentrations of ATP (1 mM) were required to increase PGE2 production. Many other nucleotides were equally effective at this concentration. ATP activates the phospholipase-C system in human amnion, as demonstrated by the increase in [Ca2+]i and inositol phosphates. The physiological significance of purinergic stimulation of this tissue remains unclear.\r"

Acidic extracts of human placental tissue collected at term pregnancy contained high irNPY concentrations. The extracted irNPY eluted from HPLC with the same retention time as synthetic NPY. The presence of the peptide in placental cells was confirmed by immunohistochemical findings showing numerous cells of the cytotrophoblast layer positively staining for NPY. Further supporting local production of the peptide, primary cultures of human placental cells released irNPY into the culture medium and the addition of high K+ concentrations increased the release of the peptide. The finding of irNPY in human placenta stimulated the characterization of binding sites of NPY in the same tissue. Using autoradiographic techniques we showed specific binding of [125I]NPY in human placental tissue. The binding of [125I]NPY to the placental receptors was saturable and widely distributed within the placental tissue. Finally, the addition of NPY to the medium of cultured placental cells increased the release of immunoreactive CRF, suggesting a possible role of NPY in placental hormone production. The effect of NPY was dose related and augmented by the addition of norepinephrine (10 nM). These results showed that human placenta produces and secretes irNPY and that NPY receptors are present in placental tissue. Moreover, the evidence that NPY stimulated the release of immunoreactive CRF from cultured placental cells suggests an action of NPY in placental hormonogenesis.\r"

  ".W": "Pituitary PRL mRNA concentrations were measured during the 4-day rat estrous cycle. Adult female Sprague-Dawley rats were killed at 3-h intervals throughout the cycle and hourly between 1000 and 2400 h on proestrus (n = 5-12). Serum PRL was increased on the afternoons of proestrus (P) and estrus (E), with peak concentrations at 1700 h (P, 624 +/- 126; E, 261 +/- 107 ng/ml). PRL mRNA concentrations were elevated during the evening on P and E (2300 h: P, 14.4 +/- 1.5; E, 16.1 +/- 1.3 ng cDNA bound/100 micrograms pituitary DNA) to values 2-fold higher than those at 0800 h on each respective day. On diestrus (D) PRL mRNA levels decreased abruptly during the morning (1100 h, 1.7 +/- 0.3 ng cDNA bound), followed by a 6- to 7-fold increase between 1700 and 2000 h on the same evening. In contrast, PRL mRNA levels were elevated at 0800 h on metestrus (M). The changes in PRL mRNA concentrations obtained on M and D were not associated with increased PRL secretion. A more detailed examination of P revealed that PRL mRNA levels increased during the morning (1000 h, 9.9 +/- 2.6 ng cDNA bound), then decreased abruptly at 1100 h (4.9 +/- 1.2). The morning rise in mRNA concentrations was followed by a 2-fold rise in pituitary PRL content. As serum PRL rose during the afternoon surge, a coincident decrease in pituitary PRL content and an increase in PRL mRNA levels were observed. The relationship between PRL secretion and gene expression was further examined in ovariectomized estradiol-replaced rats receiving either bromocriptine (1.2 mg/day, sc) or vehicle control sc. The vehicle-treated group expressed a characteristic afternoon PRL surge between 1500 and 2100 h. Pituitary PRL decreased during the surge to 10% of morning values, and PRL mRNA levels increased 2-fold beginning 2 h after initiation of the surge. These changes in serum PRL, pituitary PRL, and PRL mRNA levels were abolished by bromocriptine administration. These data reveal that alterations in PRL mRNA concentrations occur on a daily basis during the rat estrous cycle. Increases occur during the evenings of P and E at the time of the increase in PRL secretory activity. The effect of blocking the PRL surge in ovariectomized estradiol-replaced rats suggests a regulatory interaction between secretion and gene expression.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "89170521\r", 
  ".W": "P19 EPI-7, a differentiated murine embryonal carcinoma cell line with an epithelioid morphology, does not require external growth factors for proliferation under clonal and subconfluent conditions. At saturation density, however, cells become quiescent in the G1/G0 phase of the cell cycle from which they can be restimulated, particularly upon addition of epidermal growth factor. Medium conditioned by confluent P19 EPI-7 cultures is able to enhance clonal outgrowth of this cell line, suggesting that autocrine growth factor loops may be acting in these cells. Analysis of conditioned serum-free medium shows that this cell line produces a platelet-derived growth factor-like growth factor, next to a type beta transforming growth factor and large amounts of insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II) and an IGF-binding protein with high specificity for IGF-II. This latter observation has been confirmed by the use of a specific bioassay for IGFs, based on their ability to specifically stimulate proliferation of MCF-7 human breast cancer cells. The amount of IGF-II produced (0.5 mg/liter conditioned medium) makes P19 EPI-7 one of the best producing cell lines for this factor described so far. Receptor cross-linking analysis shows that this cell line contains IGF-I receptors, but no specific receptors for IGF-II. Depending on the conditions tested, transforming growth factor-beta 1 either act as a growth-stimulating factor or as a strong growth inhibitory factor. These data demonstrate that upon cellular differentiation, embryonal carcinoma cells can be formed which produce polypeptide growth factors and are also able to respond to such factors. These observations are discussed in the light of the role of autocrine and paracrine growth stimulation processes during early murine development.\r"

We report a new technique which permits detailed mapping of the epileptogenic activity in the basal temporal lobe and the convexity of the temporal lobe. The technique consists of placement of at least 16 basal temporal electrodes and an additional 64 electrodes covering the temporal convexity. This extensive coverage permits accurate definition of the limits of the epileptogenic focus and also of adjacent functional areas and therefore allows more significant determination than have previous techniques of the ideal extent of the surgical resection. This accuracy cannot be achieved with depth electrodes or the limited coverage provided by previously reported epidural or subdural electrode techniques.\r"

All patients later received anterior temporal lobectomy. Volumetric cell densities and percentage of principal cell loss relative to normal controls were determined in several different areas of each resected temporal lobe. The percentage of drug-induced beta activity was then compared with the percentage of cell loss by (a) making precise topographic correlations between induced beta and cell loss, (b) relating the overall degree of left/right beta asymmetry to cell loss averaged over wide regions, and (c) comparing the likelihood of left/right beta asymmetries in patients with and without extreme cell loss. The results obtained were consistently negative and were unaffected by whether EEG data were analyzed by computer or visual inspection. These results indicate that the well-known loss of drug-induced beta activity found in epileptogenic regions is not an indicator of the degree of cell loss or sclerosis. The underlying focal dysfunction measured by EEG beta activity remains unknown, and factors such as focal hypoperfusion, hypometabolism, and the microanatomic features of the cells remaining in the focus should be investigated.\r"

  ".W": "A group of 18 patients with chronic epilepsy were followed in an outpatient clinic for 1-6 years. Month-by-month seizure records were kept and the response to treatment was systematically explored. The present study was prompted when three patients became seizure-free, apparently in response to major life events (marriage, parenthood, and retirement) rather than to changes in treatment. All the subjects were interviewed in their own homes with a companion, friend, or relative present. The interview was based on a standard instrument (Life Experiences Survey, LES). The home environment was chosen to facilitate recall of events and to enable subjects to confirm dates. The seizure record was then compared with the parallel life events record. Two methods of analysis were adopted. In the first, each life event was assumed to have impact on seizure frequency only during the month in which it occurred; life event months were compared with non-life-event months. In the second, a life event was considered a watershed; seizure frequencies before and after the event were compared. Nonparametric statistical methods were used. These approaches revealed associations between life events and seizure frequency in three additional patients (total six). Most of the patients who showed an association experienced partial seizures.\r"

  ".W": "We evaluated the nature and significance of seizure problems in an emergency department (ED) by studying seizures in an urban community hospital. In 6 months, there were 29,131 ED visits; of these, 200 (0.7%) were for diagnosed seizures. Among these 200 seizure visits, were 69 (34.5%) new-onset seizures, 30 (15%) febrile seizures, and 92 (46%) seizures in epilepsy patients with prescribed antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). These seizures were often serious and complicated by medical and psychosocial problems; e.g., 37 patients (18.5%) had multiple seizures, 14 (7%) had status epilepticus, and 63 (31.5%) required hospitalization. Associated psychosocial problems included 61 patients (31%) who had no medical insurance, 62 others (31%) who were judged indigent, and 60 (30%) who abused alcohol. Of 92 epilepsy patients receiving AEDs, 52 (56.5%) had subtherapeutic blood levels and were noncompliant with AED prescription patients. Problems with continuity of care were demonstrated by the failure of the ED to communicate with primary care providers about drug levels, noncompliance, and changes in therapy in greater than 85% of patients. A hospital ED is a major source for epilepsy and seizure care, but this care is not always optimum. EDs need to be prepared to manage common acute seizure problems. However, EDs must also place greater emphasis on significant nonemergency aspects of seizure care such as AED compliance, associated psychosocial problems, and effective communication with primary care providers.\r"

CBZ was associated with statistically significant prolongation of SEP latencies. When the drug was switched to GVG, shortening of the peak latencies was observed. Prolonged pattern-VEP peaks were observed both during CBZ and GVG monotherapies. A similar but more subtle tendency of the peaks was observed in P100 latencies. Spectral EEG revealed a slowing of the occipital rhythm with CBZ. No QEEG changes related to GVG were found. The use of multimodal evoked potentials and QEEG should be considered in studying the effects of new antiepileptic drugs (AEDs).\r"

Patients with abundant FIEDs during the control night showed a mean increase of 39% in the rate of FIEDs per unit of time during the naloxone infusion night. During the naloxone infusion night, mean nocturnal plasma prolactin (PRL) concentrations in this group of patients showed significant elevation, which was correlated with increased density of FIEDs. All-night infusion of naloxone failed to show any effect on the remaining three patients with minimal or no FIEDs during the control night. Mean nocturnal plasma PRL concentrations in this group of patients was significantly lower than in the former group. Our data support the notion that, in response to interictal or ictal discharges, endogenous opioid peptides may exert an inhibitory action that is reversible by administration of naloxone.\r"

A rat model was developed to examine the effects of chronic CBZ treatment on folate concentrations in the rat. In the course of developing this model, a common vehicle, propylene glycol, by itself in high doses, was found to exhibit protective properties against induced seizures and inhibited weight gain. Seizures induced by hexafluorodiethyl ether (HFDE) were also found to be a more sensitive measure of protection by CBZ than seizures induced by maximal electroshock (MES). Oral administration of CBZ as an aqueous suspension every 8 h at a dose of 250 mg/kg was continuously protective against HFDE-induced seizures and was minimally toxic as measured by weight gain over 8 weeks of treatment. The CBZ levels measured in plasma and brain of these animals, however, were below those normally considered protective. This treatment with CBZ had no apparent adverse effect on folate concentrations in the rat, and, indeed, the folate concentration increased in liver after 6 weeks of treatment and in plasma at 8 weeks of treatment.\r"

A retrospective chart review (1979-1985) yielded 96 cases (90 patients), meeting both clinical and laboratory criteria for PHT intoxication. Seven patients, all with epilepsy, had one or more seizures while toxic. However, in only two patients (2.1%) with serum concentrations of 93.2 and 69.7 micrograms/ml was a causal relationship deemed highly probable. Seizures did not occur in most toxic epileptic patients with total serum PHT concentrations as high as 85.1 micrograms/ml or in any of the nonepileptic patients with concentrations as high as 64.2 micrograms/ml. The lack of convulsant action of PHT in these patients suggests that seizure risk may be multifactorial and also that PHT is a weak convulsant. We conclude that PHT at very high concentrations can rarely exacerbate seizures or even precipitate generalized status in some epileptic patients, a paradoxical effect.\r"

A sufficient volume of IF was obtained through a multiperforated polypropylene ball implanted into the left parietotemporal region for 4-5 weeks. PHT brain distribution coefficient values ranged between 1.9 and 3.75, while the ratios of IF to free serum PHT concentrations ranged between 0.19 and 1.04; thus, our data indicate that most of the free unbound PHT which enters the brain parenchyma accumulates in the cellular compartment. Furthermore, at 60 and 90 min the peak CSF and IF concentrations are delayed; thus, for PHT, an apparent diffusion front from the CSF into the extracellular space of the brain seems to occur.\r"

The present study was designed to evaluate the potential mutagenicity of PHT in a more objective and reliable way than has been done previously. Following careful screening procedures, 16 adult male patients with epilepsy receiving long-term PHT monotherapy and 16 healthy controls were selected for a study of SCE frequencies in peripheral lymphocytes. The patients and controls were matched for sex, age, and smoking habits. Strict exclusionary criteria were observed, including all factors known to affect or suspected of affecting the SCE frequencies. Statistical analyses did not reveal any significant differences between the SCE rates of PHT-treated patients and controls, indicating a lack of PHT mutagenicity as expressed by induction of SCE in adults.\r"

The diet was modified in groups A and B. Group A received a mixture of FA, Vit, and AA, while group B received FA supplementation alone. Groups C and D received a regular diet. We found that PHT, when administered without dietary supplementation, resulted in a decrease in weight and length of the fetuses, an increased rate of subcutaneous (s.c.) bleeding, a retardation of ossification centers, and an increased number of malformations. Supplementation of the diet with FA alone or FA with Vit and AA resulted in statistically greater fetal weight and length, decreased subcutaneous bleeding, more ossification centers, and fewer malformations. The mixture of FA and Vit and AA was superior to FA alone in reducing the incidence of internal abnormalities, ossification abnormalities of the distant phalanxes, and s.c. bleeding.\r"

All underwent serum sampling for P and luteinizing hormone (LH) at 20-minute intervals for 24 hours, beginning at 9:00 A.M. of day 7 post-LH surge. No significant differences were noted among the three groups for LH area under the curve, pulse frequency, or pulse amplitude. Furthermore, no differences were ascertained for P area under the curve. However, individuals were identified who had one or more hormonal abnormalities but no abnormal biopsy, as well as patients with normal hormonal profiles but having abnormal endometrial development. Receiver Operating Characteristic curves demonstrated that pooled morning serum P levels provided optimal predictive ability of biopsy results. The authors conclude that luteal phase insufficiency is a heterogeneous disorder, and that neither endometrial biopsy nor serum hormonal analysis obviates the need for the other.\r"

In the authors' series of 21 women treated with methotrexate for ectopic pregnancies, only two ruptured. In both cases, hCS levels continued to rise during and after methotrexate treatment. Concomitantly, beta-hCG and P decreased in both of these patients. The authors thus interpret increasing hCS as a reflection of continued syncytiotrophoblast growth, signalling impending rupture. Furthermore, patients with levels of hCS less than 10 ng/ml may require neither medical nor surgical therapy.\r"

Fifteen women were identified as carriers for the Duarte (GtD) or galactosemia (gt) variants of transferase--genes associated with reduced transferase activity compared with normal (Gt+). The mean age at menopause for 8 women with a natural menopause who were GtD/Gt+ or gt/Gt+ was 44.8, significantly younger (P = 0.007) than the mean age of 49.2 reported by 31 naturally postmenopausal subjects with Gt+/Gt+ genotypes and normal transferase activity. Compared with the latter group, women who were Duarte or galactosemia carriers were 13.7 times more likely to have a menopause before age 48 (with 95% confidence limits of 2.0 to 95.5). Six of 13 (46%) married women who were GtD/Gt+ or gt/Gt+ reported more than 2 years' trying to achieve a pregnancy, compared with 11 of 74 (15%) with normal genotypes and activity (P = 0.02). The authors conclude that genetic deficiency of transferase may be associated with infertility and early menopause.\r"

A slight (7.2%) decrease in mean SHBG from 4.25 +/- 1.67 (standard deviation) mg/l to 3.95 +/- 1.61 mg/l was observed within the 6-month period encompassing the menopause. More specifically, the decrease appeared to commence at the menopause and to become clearly significant (P = 0.01) some 2 to 6 months later. During the subsequent year, a further decrease to 3.64 +/- 1.42 mg/l was observed, amounting to a total decrease in mean SHBG by 14.4% (P less than 0.001). Of the hormones, only E2 exhibited a marked decrease (P less than 0.01) within this same 6-month period. The changes in SHBG during the 6-month transition period from premenopause to postmenopause correlated significantly (P = 0.013) only with those of E2. It is concluded that decreasing E2 levels appear to play a significant role in the downward modulation of SHBG levels commencing at the menopause.\r"

All recipients were cycled on a program of incremental oral micronized estradiol and intramuscular progesterone-in-oil. Thirteen candidates for oocyte donation were screened to obtain 8 donors. One donor candidate was excluded because of her medical history. The psychological screening of 2 of the other donor candidates (who subsequently did not complete the donation cycle) revealed a primary motive of financial gain. In general, the psychological profiles of donor candidates revealed a high incidence of troubled families and either reproductive loss or loss of a parent. Ovarian stimulation of the donors followed our standard in vitro fertilization protocol. The recipients' exogenous steroid replacement continued until days 97 and 101, respectively, of the two gestations. Both pregnancies resulted in the delivery of normal singleton males--the first at 40 weeks, the second at 35 weeks.\r"

One hundred twenty-nine IVF trials were performed with either fresh (59%) or frozen-thawed (41%) donor sperm. Characteristics of sperm preparations were significantly lower in the frozen-thawed group (P less than 0.001). In the latter group, fertilization rates had slightly decreased (but without statistical significance); embryonic vitality scores and cryopreservable spare embryos had significantly decreased (P less than 0.05). However, cumulative ongoing pregnancy rates were strictly equivalent in both groups (40% after three trials). Frozen-thawed sperm thus can be substituted for fresh donor sperm without entailing impairment of the outcome of IVF, and this method must be preferred for its greater safety regarding transmission of human immunodeficiency virus.\r"

In each controlled assay, the authors compared sperm binding of proven fertile men with that of patients undergoing IVF. Human oocytes stored in a salt solution were used in the study, and binding results were correlated with the fertilization rate of preovulatory oocytes during IVF. Patients with poor fertilization rates in IVF had significantly lower binding than those cases with successful fertilization (7.3 +/- 1.4 versus 62.1 +/- 10.9, respectively; mean +/- standard error, P less than 0.02). Based on current standards, the HZA was able to predict fertilization accurately in 26 of 28 cases (sensitivity of 83%, specificity of 95%, positive predictive value of 83%). The authors conclude that the HZA is a valuable tool for evaluating dysfunctional sperm-zona pellucida binding, with good predictive value for fertilization in vitro.\r"

Glass wool filtration tended to be more successful than Percoll centrifugation when the ejaculates were asthenozoospermic or produced a suspect/abnormal HOS test. After selection, the acrosin activity increased approximately two- to threefold, but no significant improvement in the percentage of normal sperm forms occurred. Experiments with mixtures of untreated and frozen-thawed ejaculates confirmed that glass wool filtration is more effective in removing nonmotile and HOS-negative spermatozoa than the two-layer Percoll centrifugation technique when the percentage of these types of spermatozoa in the ejaculate is high. The simplicity of these techniques and the good recovery of apparently viable spermatozoa makes these methods more desirable than other, more complicated techniques or procedures that yield a lower recovery of motile spermatozoa.\r"

Zona-free hamster oocyte penetration was abolished in all oligozoospermic samples at the end of treatment. Twenty of the 21 oligozoospermic samples yielding at least 0.6 to 5.0 million motile spermatozoa showed a complete absence of oocyte penetration. Semen parameters returned to normal, although some took up to 12 months. These findings demonstrated an antifertility action of MPA and T enanthate on the functional capacity of residual spermatozoa and support the view that extreme oligozoospermia may be a tenable target for reversible steroid male contraception.\r"

In contrast, the uterotropic effect of danazol was reduced by the antiestrogen, LY156758. The estrogen-sensitive endpoints, vaginal keratinization and uterine progesterone receptor concentration, were enhanced by treatment with a combination of flutamide and either danazol or gestrinone.

A solution hybridization/RNase protection assay was used to simultaneously quantitate the relative tissue content of the variant IGF-I mRNA species arising from alternative splicing in the region encoding the COOH-terminal extension E-peptide (IGF-Ia and IGF-Ib). IGF-Ia and IGF-Ib mRNAs were markedly decreased in liver, kidney, and lung tissues of diabetic rats. Although GF stimulates IGF-I gene expression, chronic GH excess from implanted somatomammotropic tumors did not appropriately induce tissue IGF-I mRNA content in diabetic animals. Treatment of diabetic rats with insulin for 1 wk restored basal and GH-stimulated IGF-Ia and IGF-Ib mRNA content toward that present in tissues of nondiabetic rats. The ratio of IGF-Ia to IGF-Ib mRNA remained relatively constant for each tissue and was not affected by the diabetic state, chronic GH hyperstimulation, or insulin therapy, suggesting that posttranscriptional splicing is not a regulated event in these conditions. Thus, both circulating IGF-I levels and tissue IGF-I gene expression are profoundly decreased in this model of experimental diabetes. Diminished tissue availability of IGF-I from endocrine and/or paracrine sources may be responsible for the growth retardation seen in uncontrolled diabetes mellitus.\r"

No cases were diagnosed in less than 35-yr-old subjects, and the incidence was strongly related to the duration of diabetes. The cumulative incidence of proliferative retinopathy after 20 yr duration was 14%. All cases of proliferative retinopathy occurred in subjects with background retinopathy. Younger age at diagnosis of diabetes was associated with a higher incidence of proliferation when subjects with diabetes of similar duration were compared. A higher incidence of proliferative retinopathy, after controlling for age, sex, and diabetes duration, was associated with hypertension, proteinuria, renal insufficiency, absence of Achilles tendon reflex, elevated total serum cholesterol concentration, and insulin therapy.\r"

For both sexes, diabetes was associated with a two- to threefold excess risk of intermittent claudication compared with its absence. A pronounced excess risk was also observed in subjects on oral hypoglycemic therapy and in women receiving insulin. Although diabetes was often associated with an atherogenic-risk profile, controlling for age and several concomitant risk factors failed to eliminate the association with intermittent claudication. Those who developed both intermittent claudication and diabetes were at an especially high risk of incident cardiovascular events. In women, the risk of coronary heart disease, stroke, and cardiac failure was increased 3-4 times when diabetes and intermittent claudication occurred together compared with when either condition existed alone. In diabetic men, the presence of intermittent claudication doubled the risk of stroke, and cardiac failure was approximately 3 times more likely in subjects with both conditions compared with either alone. We conclude that diabetes is an important risk factor for intermittent claudication, which in turn confers a serious prognosis for subsequent cardiovascular outcomes in the patient with diabetes.\r"

Behavioral counseling and office procedural skills training were found to be complementary in areas of content, in teaching methods, and in maintaining variety and interest in the training experience.

The resulting eight factors were rank ordered according to program type (eg, medical school based) based on mean scores of items that loaded on each factor. The factor most influential in students' selections of programs was the \"quality of training\" they perceived they would receive, while the least important factor was \"resident compensation and benefits.\" Students who selected medical school based programs and community based, medical school affiliated programs differed significantly as to the importance they placed on the \"academic orientation of the program\" and the \"attitude toward family physicians\" in their program selections.\r"

We surveyed 1,182 graduates of the University of Washington (1978-84) inquiring about residency training, current clinical specialty, influences and attributes in specialty selection, satisfaction with current specialty, and timing of the decision. Usable responses were 56% of the total surveyed (67% without 194 undeliverable surveys). When rates of non-response, bad address, and usable response were compared across graduating classes, no significant differences were found. The data also do not overrepresent a particular training choice or specialty group compared to all graduates. The majority of respondents (n = 404, 62.3%) were in practice at the time of the survey. The distribution of specialty groups was significantly different for those in practice compared to those still in training (X2 = 27.28, P less than .001). Although the groups were somewhat different, these differences did not lead to major changes in responses. Sixty percent of graduates choosing family medicine did so either before or during the first two years of medical school. This contrasts with other specialties, where the majority of students did not make a decision until the third year of medical school. Medical school courses were an important influence.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Approximately 10.7% of the 15,947 graduates of United States medical schools between July 1987 and June 1988 were first-year residents in family practice in October 1988. This compares to 12.0% in the previous year. The Mountain region reported the highest percentage of medical school graduates who are first-year residents in family practice programs in October 1988; the Middle Atlantic and New England regions had the lowest percentages. Medical school graduates from publicly funded medical schools were twice as likely to be first-year residents in family practice in October 1988 as were graduates from privately funded medical schools. The percentages for each medical school have varied substantially from year to year in the eight years that the AAFP has reported this information. The average percentage for each medical school for the last eight years, as well as the cumulative percentage for each medical school, are reported. Although school-specific percentages may show wide year-to-year variations, the total percentage of U.S. medical school graduates entering family practice residencies has been generally stable near 12.0% in the previous seven years. The decline to 10.7% for 1987-88 is cause for careful review.\r"

Better education is one of the revitalizing factors. General practice is currently taught as a mandatory subject at all four universities in Norway. The practice apprenticeship is the essential element in our undergraduate curricula. In their fifth year, the students spend three to eight weeks in a structured training program supervised by general practice faculty. Approximately 500 general practitioners take part in this decentralized training network. In 1985 general practice was recognized as a specialty in Norway. The obligatory requirements in the five-year educational program are: -courses, 400 hours -hospital training, one year -general practice training, four years -group-based training program, two years The last element is based on a decentralized concept where a group of two to 10 trainees meet for three hours every two weeks during a two-year period. The group is headed by an appointed and qualified trainer. Besides being in accordance with the geography and demography of Norway, this model gives substance to the slogan \"general practice can only be learnt in general practice.\"\r"

Evidence that C. pylori may be the causative agent or at least a major contributory factor in peptic ulcer disease has generated intense interest in the development of reliable methods for detecting C. pylori infections. We have developed a specific and sensitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) that detects serum immunoglobulin G antibodies directed against high molecular weight cell-associated proteins (HM-CAP) of C. pylori. In a blinded fashion we tested sera from 300 individuals and found that all of 147 HM-CAP ELISA-negative individuals were also negative for C. pylori, as documented by a negative urea breath test; also, 151 of 153 C. pylori-positive (by urea breath test) individuals were HM-CAP ELISA-positive. Campylobacter pylori was cultured from the two ELISA-negative but infected patients and these isolates did possess HM-CAP antigens, showing that these two individuals had failed to seroconvert. Thus, the specificity and positive predictive value of the HM-CAP ELISA were each 100%; the sensitivity of the assay was 98.7%, and the negative predictive value was 98.6%. The HM-CAP ELISA and the urea breath test both proved valuable for detecting C. pylori infection, the urea breath test being a more direct method whereas the ELISA is less expensive and easier to perform. Furthermore, the results of a serologic test such as the HM-CAP ELISA would not be influenced by recent ingestion of bismuth compounds or antimicrobial therapy, which might suppress C. pylori and cause a transient false-negative result in the urea breath test.\r"

  ".W": "Genetic factors have been implicated in the etiology of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) because of the increased occurrence of IBD in relatives. To further characterize the familial aggregation of IBD, we obtained family histories by interview on 188 IBD patients, including 154 Ashkenazi Jews (82%), ascertained through a Los Angeles gastroenterology practice. Thirty-three index cases (17.6%) had at least one affected first-degree relative; an additional 11 had more distant affected relatives. Thus, 23.4% of our sample had a positive family history. The quantification of empiric risk estimates for various classes of relatives has been quite limited and has been reported in only a few series. An important goal of our study was the determination of the specific empiric risk figures for relatives. We obtained uncorrected risk estimates of 2.5% to off-spring, 5.2% to siblings, and 2.9% to parents. Although the highest risk we observed is to siblings, IBD has a variable and often late age of onset, and it is likely that many relatives, particularly offspring, of patients in this sample have not reached the age at which they will manifest clinical disease. Thus, these uncorrected risks as well as those reported in the literature are an underestimate of the true empiric risks. To provide an estimate of the true lifetime risks, we utilized age-specific incidence data to calculate the following age-corrected empiric risk estimates for IBD: 8.9% to offspring, 8.8% to siblings, and 3.5% to parents. It is these latter age-corrected estimates that are most appropriate for both genetic counseling and genetic modeling.\r"

  ".W": "To define the myenteric plexus along the human gastrointestinal tract, we studied three neonatal and six adult specimens, postmortem, by silver impregnation. There were no clear differences between the neonatal and the adult gastrointestinal tracts. In the body of the esophagus, the plexus was sparse, with few ganglia; 30%-40% of fascicular intersections were devoid of ganglia. In the lower 5 cm, the esophagus had thick bundles of nerve fibers (\"shunt fascicles\"), which crossed the gastroesophageal junction and radiated to the periphery of the stomach through several branches. The plexus in the stomach was uniform, with intermediate and intrafascicular ganglia. A thick nerve bundle encircled the pylorus and gave branches on either side to the antrum and the duodenum. Shunt fascicles in the stomach did not cross the pylorus but extended to the distal antrum. In the duodenum and proximal jejunum, the plexus was regular, but in the mid-small intestine, the longitudinal interganglionic fascicles were more prominent than the circumferential fascicles. Distally, this pattern was reversed; circumferential fascicles were more prominent and ganglia were dense in the terminal ileum. Thin, short shunt fascicles were scattered along the entire small intestine, becoming more abundant in the terminal ileum. Short, thick shunt fascicles traveled proximally from the ileocecal junction for about 25-30 cm. As in the stomach, shunt fascicles did not cross the ileocecal junction, but a thick nerve bundle encircled it. In the cecum and proximal colon, the plexus was sparse with large intermediate and intrafascicular ganglia. In the rectum and distal colon, the plexus was dense, with parafascicular and intrafascicular ganglia. Long ascending nerves extended from the distal rectum into the midcolon. In addition, there were short, thick nerve bundles in the rectum that traveled proximally.\r"

Fifteen patients had iterative biopsies. Twenty-one subjects with normal endoscopy, serum gastrin, and acid secretion served as controls. Individual fundic argyrophil cell density was above the highest control value in 77% of the patients, whatever the treatment. Argyrophil cell densities tended to be higher in women than in men. During the survey, fundic carcinoids developed in one ranitidine- and in one omeprazole-treated patient. Fundic argyrophil cell densities were correlated with serum gastrin levels (r' = 0.730, p less than 0.001). Antral somatostatin cell density was not modified in any patients as compared with controls, nor was antral gastrin cell density except in omeprazole-treated patients. In these patients, gastrin cell density and gastrin to somatostatin cell ratio were significantly higher than in all other patients or controls. Such increases may indicate true gastrin cell hyperplasia in relation to drug-induced profound acid inhibition.\r"

  ".W": "To evaluate differences in the expression of cystic fibrosis (CF) transport defects in the gastrointestinal tract of subjects with CF, in vivo measurements of colonic and esophageal transepithelial electrical potential difference (PD) were performed before and during amiloride superfusion in CF and healthy subjects. Esophageal PD before (-16 +/- 2 vs. -16 +/- 3 mV) and after (-14 +/- 2 vs. -15 +/- 0.3 mV) superfusion with amiloride were similar for CF and healthy subjects. Basal rectosigmoid colon PD was also similar (CF: mean -23 +/- 6 and maximal -37 +/- 9 mV; normal: mean -26 +/- 5 and maximal -45 +/- 11 mV) in both groups. However, with amiloride superfusion (10(-4) M) the colonic PD in CF subjects was almost abolished (95% +/- 15% inhibition), whereas the PD in healthy subjects was only partially reduced (42% +/- 6%) (p less than 0.05). The greater inhibition with amiloride in CF, which was evident in absolute terms (26 +/- 4 vs. 16 +/- 3 mV for controls, p less than 0.05) as well as relative terms, could not be ascribed to a difference in mineralocorticoid secretion rates, because 24-h urine excretion of aldosterone and 17 hydroxy and 17 ketosteroids were similar in both groups. Freshly excised colonic epithelia from 1 CF and 3 non-CF subjects were studied in Ussing chambers, and a similar difference in amiloride responsiveness noted: PD and short-circuit current declined 33% +/- 2% and 37% +/- 4%, respectively, in seven tissues from the colons of 3 patients without CF, whereas both PD and short-circuit current were fully inhibited (100%) in all three tissues from the CF patient. As the presence of an amiloride-insensitive component of short-circuit current in non-CF colon is largely due to electrogenic Cl- secretion, the demonstration that this component was absent both in vivo and in vitro in CF colon establishes the presence of a defect in electrolyte transport in CF colon, a defect consistent with recent reports of absent electrogenic Cl- secretion in CF intestine.\r"

  ".W": "Pepsinogen granules were isolated from the rabbit stomach using isoosmotic Percoll density gradients, low free calcium (10(-7) M), and conditions that minimize physical damage. These granules were enriched approximately eightfold with respect to pepsinogen and were free from contamination by mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum. Electrophoretic examination shows pepsinogen to account for approximately 80% of the Coomassie Blue-stainable intragranular protein and the granule membrane to yield a simple spectrum of proteins similar to other granule systems. In addition to purity, the isolated granules displayed a high degree of osmotic stability at physiologic conditions of pH, temperature, and ionic strength. This stability suggests strict regulation of the granule electrolyte transport pathways, which are shown to include a Cl- conductance, Cl-/anion exchange, and a K+ conductance. These transport systems in the granule membrane are consistent with the promotion of primary fluid secretion. Furthermore, granule-mediated ion transport would allow the chief cell to couple fluid secretion directly to exocytotic pepsinogen secretion and flush the enzyme from the base of oxyntic glands.\r"

Four types of processing were studied: N-terminal proteolysis (at the N-terminus of component I, gastrin 34, and gastrin 17); C-terminal proteolysis (at the C-terminus of the amide donor, glycine93 in preprogastrin); alpha-carboxyamidation (of phenylalanine92); and O-sulfation (of tyrosine87). The results show that progastrin during permanent G-cell hypersecretion is less completely processed with respect to C-terminal proteolysis, alpha-amidation, and tyrosine-sulfation. In contrast, the degree of N-terminal proteolysis is normal. Thus, the processing of progastrin adjacent to the active site of gastrin is more restrictively controlled than N-terminal processing during G-cell hypersecretion associated with pernicious anemia.\r"

By analysis of estrogen binding data of crude cytosol, saturable estrogen binding showed a Kd = 4.7 X 10(-10) M. High levels of nonsaturable binding were also detected. The estrogen-binding activities detected could be distinguished by their steroid specificity, hydrodynamic parameters, ionic properties, and sensitivity to proteolytic attack. Our findings also confirmed that the moderate-affinity estrogen binders found in rodent liver cannot be detected in human tissue. We concluded that the properties of estrogen receptor of human liver cytosol allow its separation from nonsaturable estrogen-binding components.\r"

  ".W": "The results of a study to characterize the effects of the oral administration of isosorbide-5-mononitrate (Is-5-Mn), the active metabolite of isosorbide dinitrate, on portal hypertension in 23 patients with cirrhosis are reported. Patients received 20 mg of Is-5-Mn (n = 10), 40 mg (n = 9), or a placebo (n = 4). No significant changes were observed after the administration of the placebo. However, both doses of Is-5-Mn significantly reduced portal pressure, as evaluated by measurements of the hepatic venous pressure gradient. The fall in portal pressure averaged 10% after the 20-mg dose and 18% after 40 mg and was maintained for the 2 h of observation. Reduction of portal pressure was due to a decrease in the wedged hepatic vein pressure, with no changes in the free hepatic venous pressure. After the 20-mg dose, the decrease in portal pressure was associated with an increase in hepatic blood flow (16%), suggesting a fall in hepatic vascular resistance. However, after the 40-mg dose, a reflex splanchnic vasoconstriction elicited by the fall in arterial pressure (-19%) appeared to contribute to the greater reduction in portal pressure, as suggested by a significant decrease in azygos blood flow (-15%). These beneficial effects on portal pressure were not associated with adverse effects on liver function, as evaluated by measurements of the hepatic clearance of indocyanine green and the hepatic intrinsic clearance. Neither dose of Is-5-Mn caused significant changes in these quantitative parameters of liver function. These findings suggest that Is-5-Mn could be a potentially useful and safe agent in the treatment of portal hypertension.\r"

  ".W": "Gallbladders removed at cholecystectomy are a potentially useful source of human receptor for the gastrointestinal peptide hormone cholecystokinin (CCK). Seven healthy gallbladders (removed incidentally at time of resection of hepatic metastases) and 50 diseased gallbladders were studied. Cholecystokinin radioligand binding to an enriched plasma membrane preparation from these tissues was shown to be rapid, reversible, temperature-dependent, saturable, specific, and high-affinity. Computer analysis of equilibrium binding data using the Ligand program best fit a single class of binding sites with Kd = 1.0 +/- 0.1 nM (mean +/- SEM). This was similar in health and disease, with no apparent differences related to age, gender, or body habitus. The structural specificity for binding to this site correlated well with relative potencies for CCK-gastrin peptides to stimulate gallbladder contraction. To biochemically characterize this receptor, we used a battery of reagents, including \"long\" (125I-Bolton Hunter-CCK-33) and \"short\" 125I-D-Try-Gly-[(Nle28,31)CCK-26-33] probes that were cross-linkable through their amino terminus and a monofunctional probe with a photolabile group at its carboxyl terminus 125I-D-Tyr-Gly[(Nle28,31,pNO2-Phe33)CCK-26-33]. All probes specifically labeled a human gallbladder muscularis protein of Mr = 85,000-95,000, which was also independent of diagnosis. Labeling of this band was inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner by CCK-8 and by L-364,718. Thus, the CCK receptor present on the very common surgically removed human gallbladder is functionally and biochemically intact and is useful for further characterization.\r"

Since the marketing of this drug in 1984, more than nine million prescriptions have been dispensed. Several cases of jaundice and hepatic dysfunction have been observed and reported to the Food and Drug Administration and the pharmaceutical company (Beecham Laboratories). A review of 18 of these cases revealed a predominantly cholestatic syndrome in 7 cases, a mixed hepatocellular-cholestatic picture in 6 cases, a hepatocellular pattern in 4, and in 1 case the injury could not be clearly defined. No fatalities were observed, and all cases had reversal of hepatic dysfunction upon cessation of the drug. Fever was present in 2 patients and eosinophilia in 6 of 10 patients tested, suggesting a hypersensitivity phenomenon contributing to hepatic dysfunction in some of the cases. A percutaneous liver biopsy had been performed in 7 of 18 patients and four of these were reviewed by the authors. Prominent centrizonal cholestasis was seen in all four biopsies. Additionally, 1 patient had periportal and another had midzonal cholestasis. Although infrequent, recognition of an often benign cholestatic syndrome associated with amoxicillin-clavulanate potassium will help avoid unnecessary, invasive, and expensive diagnostic studies and also ameliorate symptoms upon withdrawal of the drug.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of five bile salts, deoxycholate, chenodeoxycholate, cholate, ursodeoxycholate, and ursocholate, possessing (in decreasing order) different hydrophobicity, on bile flow and biliary secretion of total calcium, magnesium, sodium, and potassium was studied in 10 patients with T-tubes. Each subject was infused intraduodenally with one or two bile salts, given separately, to produce a selective enrichment of biliary bile salts with the infused bile salt. The choleresis induced per 1-mumol increase of bile salt output was greater during the secretion of 7 beta-hydroxylated bile salts, ursodeoxycholate (0.029 ml), and ursocholate (0.027 ml), followed in decreasing order by deoxycholate (0.023 ml), chenodeoxycholate (0.019 ml), and cholate (0.009 ml). Deoxycholate stimulated the greatest increase in cation secretion per unit increase in bile salt output, followed by chenodeoxycholate and cholate. The two 7 beta-hydroxylated bile salts induced greater cation secretion than did their 7 alpha-epimers. Whereas biliary concentration of divalent cations differed depending on the structure and concentration of the infused bile salt, the concentration of monovalent cations was constant for any species and concentration of infused bile salt. Relationships between bile salt and divalent cation concentration indicate that 1 mumol of secreted biliary deoxycholate, the most hydrophobic bile salt, associates with the greatest amount of calcium (0.046 mumol) and magnesium (0.022 mumol), followed by chenodeoxycholate (0.020 and 0.010 mumol, respectively) and cholate (0.012 and 0.008 mumol, respectively). The capacity of ursodeoxycholate and ursocholate to associate with calcium and magnesium seems to be less than that of their 7 alpha-epimers. These data suggest that of the common bile salts, the more hydrophobic bile salts stimulate bile flow and cation secretion better than the more hydrophilic bile salts, whereas ursodeoxycholate and ursocholate are more effective than their more hydrophobic 7 alpha-epimers. Whereas different bile salts seem to influence the secretion of sodium and potassium mainly by virtue of their choleretic properties, the effect of bile salt structure on biliary secretion of calcium and magnesium suggests the presence of a secretory link that might be consistent with cation-bile salt binding.\r"

Binding was found to be reversible, saturable, and specific. Scatchard analysis revealed a single class of 3,5,3'-L-triiodothyronine receptors in the pancreata of adult rats. The dissociation constant was 0.29 +/- 0.02 x 10(-9) M, and maximal binding capacity was 242 +/- 10 fmol of T3 bound per milligram of nonhistone protein at 30 degrees C (n = 20). Both parameters are comparable with those of adult rat liver nuclei. The degree of receptor occupancy was 30%-40% of the total sites in the adult rat pancreas. Developmentally, 3,5,3'-L-triiodothyronine binding was not detectable at birth and very low in pups less than 5 days old. It reached a peak at the third to fourth weeks. The degree of receptor occupancy changed with development from a low (19.2% +/- 2.0%) in 5-10-day-old pups to a high (50.5% +/- 3.0%) in 11-20-day-old pups, then returned to a moderate level (36.9% +/- 3.0%). The dissociation constants remained unchanged at various postnatal ages. Our data suggest that the rat pancreas is a target tissue for thyroid hormone and that thyroxine plays a role in pancreatic development.\r"

The study population consisted of 240 patients (men = 208, women = 32; alcoholic = 210, nonalcoholic = 30) followed for a mean time of 8.7 yr. The status of the patients (dead or alive) was recorded in February 1987. Mean age at onset of chronic pancreatitis was 41.5 yr. Fifty-seven patients died. Mean age at time of death was 52.3 yr. \"Overmortality\" after 20 yr of course was 35.8% in comparison with a matched French population (p less than 0.0001). Chronic pancreatitis was the direct cause of death for only 19.3% of patients. The main causes of death have been alcoholic hepatopathy (n = 10), cancer (n = 9), postoperative mortality (n = 8). Unidimensional analysis of mortality rates showed that male sex (p less than 0.03), surgery (p less than 0.007), hepatopathy (p less than 0.01), diabetes mellitus (p less than 0.02), and absence of attack of acute pancreatitis (p less than 0.02) were associated with mortality. Multidimensional analysis showed that the following variables were linked with mortality: in a first model including the totality of the study population: surgery (p less than 0.006), hepatopathy (p less than 0.008), no attack of acute pancreatitis (p less than 0.03), male sex (p less than 0.03); in a second model excluding cirrhosis: surgery (p less than 0.001), male sex (p less than 0.06), diabetes mellitus (p less than 0.09). Nevertheless, surgery did not seem to interfere with long-term mortality. The lower mortality of patients with attacks of acute pancreatitis suggests a favorable influence for alcohol abstinence.\r"

Diversion of pancreatic juice from the duodenum resulted in a significant increase in plasma secretin concentration from 0.76 +/- 0.39 pM at 0 time to 3.09 +/- 0.30 pM at 4 h after diversion. This increase in secretin coincided with a steady but significant increase in pancreatic secretion of volume and bicarbonate. Intraduodenal administration of fresh pancreatic juice completely reversed the diversion-induced increases in both plasma secretin and pancreatic secretion. Intravenous injection of a rabbit-antisecretin serum blocked the increase of pancreatic secretion during diversion of pancreatic juice from the duodenum. Thus, we conclude that endogenous secretin is involved in a hormonal mechanism regulating increased pancreatic exocrine secretion in pancreatic juice-diverted rats.\r"

All patients had had failed endoscopy-alone procedures and had contraindications to surgery. The indication was palliation of malignant biliary obstruction in 66 cases (41 common bile duct, 25 hilar), assistance with sphincterotomy for the removal of common bile duct stones in 6 cases, and management of benign biliary stenosis in 2 cases. The initial procedure was percutaneous transhepatic access to the biliary tree, which was successful in all but 1 case (99%). The bile duct was drained externally for an average of 3.4 days before the combined procedure. One patient died during this period from hemorrhage associated with liver puncture. Combined procedure was performed in 72 cases and was successful in 60 [53 malignant stricture (53/66 = 80%), five common duct stone (5/6 = 83%), two benign stricture (2/2 = 100%)]. Procedure-related morbidity and mortality, respectively, were 12.5% and 0% for benign disease and 36% and 3% for malignant disease. The total (initial endoscopy included) morbidity and 30-day mortality were 33% and 0%, respectively, for benign disease and 62% and 27% for malignant disease. Subsequently, stent change has been required on 16 occasions, with endoscopy-only successful in 13 (81%) and repeat combined procedure being required in three (19%). The combined procedure improves the ability of endoscopy to offer nonsurgical therapy to poor risk patients with both malignant and benign biliary disease but is associated with significant morbidity and disease-related mortality.\r"

Renal sodium excretion was significantly reduced in group 2, whereas it exceeded threefold the salt intake in group 1. Its circadian rhythm was disrupted in both groups of patients. Significant inverse correlations with plasma aldosterone were found erratically in controls, never in group 1, and at every 4-h interval in group 2. In the latter, the indexes of tubular activity and effectiveness of aldosterone were also significantly increased. Urine norepinephrine excretion was never related to sodium excretion in either controls or patients; in group 2 it was directly correlated with glomerular filtration rate in many instances. The cortisol-related circadian rhythm of kaliuresis was retained only in group 1. The 24-h renal potassium excretion of controls and patients was comparable, in spite of the striking hyperaldosteronism, and the more than doubled contribution of aldosterone to kaliuresis shown in group 2. The influence of aldosterone on potassium excretion was also witnessed by the direct correlation between these variables found in group 1 and, when kaliuresis was corrected by the distal sodium delivery, group 2. Renal sodium handling in cirrhosis is altered even before ascites formation and compensated patients can undergo \"spontaneous natriuresis.\" Aldosterone is the main cause of sodium retention in nonazotemic ascitic patients, while sympathoadrenergic hyperactivity may contribute to preserve renal perfusion. The influence of aldosterone on kaliuresis is enhanced, but renal potassium wasting in patients with ascites and hyperaldosteronism is prevented by reduced distal tubular availability of sodium.\r"

  ".W": "Application of an irritant to the surface of the gastric mucosa confers protection against subsequent application of a damaging agent (\"adaptive cytoprotection\"). The possibility that this adaptive response is mediated via the release of nonprostaglandin mediators was examined using an ex vivo gastric chamber model, in which the irritant (1 M sodium chloride) could be applied to only one-half of the exposed mucosa. Rats were pretreated with indomethacin and one of various receptor antagonists, including cimetidine, pyrilamine, atropine, propranolol, phentolamine, cyproheptadine, haloperidol, and BN52021. In control studies, application of hypertonic saline to the left side of the mucosa reduced hemorrhagic damage induced by subsequent application of 70% ethanol by 71% +/- 4% (p less than 0.01). Of the receptor antagonists tested, only cyproheptadine and haloperidol significantly attenuated the degree of protection afforded by exposure to hypertonic saline. Subsequent dose-response studies with other serotonergic and dopaminergic antagonists suggested that dopaminergic receptors are involved in the adaptive response to the irritant. Topical application of a dopamine agonist, bromocriptine, or L-beta-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine, significantly reduced the extent of damage induced by subsequent application of 70% ethanol. The results of the gastric chamber studies were confirmed in conscious rats in which the irritant, dopamine agonist, and ethanol were administered orally. These results therefore suggest a role for endogenous dopamine as a mediator of the adaptive cytoprotection phenomenon.\r"

  ".W": "Studies were performed to determine the mechanism by which short-chain fatty acids increase colonic Na and Cl absorption by determining unidirectional 22Na and 36Cl fluxes across isolated stripped mucosa from the rat distal colon under voltage clamp conditions. Mucosal butyrate (25 mM, in the absence of bicarbonate) significantly enhanced both net Na and net Cl absorption by 7.0 +/- 1.3 and 6.9 +/- 1.0 microEq/h.cm2, respectively, without increasing the short-circuit current. Net Na and Cl absorption in butyrate-Ringer's solution and HCO3-Ringer's solution were identical. Butyrate stimulation of Na (and Cl) absorption was Cl-dependent and prevented by 1 mM mucosal amiloride, an inhibitor of Na-H exchange, but was HCO3-independent and not inhibited by acetazolamide, a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor. In contrast, bicarbonate-stimulated Na (and Cl) absorption was also Cl-dependent and amiloride-sensitive, but was significantly inhibited by acetazolamide. The effect of mucosal butyrate on net Na and Cl absorption was substantially greater than serosal butyrate, which in the presence of bicarbonate did not alter ion transport. The stimulation of Na and Cl absorption by mucosal butyrate was significantly greater than by propionate and acetate, whereas mucosal formate did not alter Na transport. The results of this study permit the following model: short-chain fatty acid stimulation of active Na and Cl absorption involves uptake of the nonionized form of butyrate and the coupling of Na-H and Cl-butyrate exchanges.\r"

  ".W": "Electrogenic Na absorption, independent of either nutrients or other ions, occurs in the rabbit ileum. However, unlike electrogenic Na absorption in the distal colon and other tight epithelia, this ileal transport system is not inhibited by amiloride. Because of this amiloride insensitivity, ileal electrogenic Na absorption has been poorly characterized. To more clearly delineate the underlying mechanisms of this pathway, we examined the effects of phenamil, an amiloride analogue, on ion fluxes and electrical parameters in rabbit ileum in vitro under short-circuit conditions. Phenamil has been shown to have a high affinity for Na channels, but minimal effect on Na-H exchange. Amiloride (10(-8) through 10(-4) M) had a minimal effect on short-circuit current. In contrast, phenamil induced a significant decrease in short-circuit current; the maximal effect was seen at 10(-4) M phenamil. There was an associated decrease in conductance at 10(-4) M phenamil. Ion flux studies were performed in normal, chloride-free and bicarbonate-free Ringer's solution; under each condition, 10(-4) M phenamil inhibited mucosal-to-serosal Na flux, net Na flux, and short-circuit current without significantly altering other fluxes. Phenamil did not inhibit the electrical response to either 10 mM glucose or 1 mM theophylline, indicating that the drug did not block either nutrient-coupled electrogenic Na absorption or electrogenic Cl secretion, and did not inhibit sodium-potassium-stimulated adenosine triphosphatase. These results demonstrate that electrogenic Na absorption in rabbit ileum may be blocked by the amiloride analogue phenamil, suggesting that, in this epithelium, Na absorption may occur via Na channels in which the amiloride-binding site has been significantly altered.\r"

Furthermore, since bile duct ligation decreases urinary calcium excretion, we studied the role of calcium supplementation in the prevention of gentamicin nephrotoxicity in this model. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were allocated to sham groups and common bile duct ligation groups. Gentamicin at 40 and 100 mg per kg per day for 5 days induced a more severe azotemia in common bile duct ligation animals than in sham controls. Furthermore, higher levels of renal gentamicin were found in common bile duct ligation rats than in sham rats early in the course of therapy, at its termination and during the recovery period. Pretreatment of common bile duct ligation animals with dietary calcium supplementation significantly attenuated gentamicin nephrotoxicity and the increased renal gentamicin accumulation, whereas initiation of calcium supplementation concurrent with gentamicin administration had no salutary effect. We conclude that experimental extrahepatic cholestasis in the rat, in the absence of any other factor, potentiates gentamicin nephrotoxicity. The effect is prevented by pretreatment with dietary calcium supplementation but is not modified by concurrent administration of a high-calcium diet.\r"

To correct for the hyperlipidemia often found in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis and primary sclerosing cholangitis, total serum lipids were measured and vitamin E levels were expressed as the vitamin E/total serum lipid ratio. Serum vitamin A and D levels and prothrombin time were also determined. Six of 45 patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (13%) but none of the patients with sclerosing cholangitis, cryptogenic cirrhosis or alcoholic cirrhosis and subnormal vitamin E/total serum lipids ratios. Vitamin E deficiency was found in two of eight patients with asymptomatic primary biliary cirrhosis. There was no correlation between standard liver biochemical tests, fasting serum cholylglycine and vitamin E levels. Patients with primary biliary cirrhosis and primary sclerosing cholangitis had significantly lower vitamin E/total serum lipids ratios than patients with either cryptogenic or alcoholic cirrhosis. Twenty-three percent of patients with primary biliary cirrhosis were vitamin D deficient and 14% had low vitamin A levels. Two of the six patients with vitamin E deficiency were also deficient in vitamin D, only one was vitamin A deficient and none had prolonged prothrombin time. We also investigated the gastrointestinal absorption of vitamin E in nine patients with primary biliary cirrhosis and normal vitamin E levels as well as in six normal controls.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

During this period, 11 episodes of cholestasis were observed, with a mean duration of 2.6 months (range: 2 weeks to 6 months). Once, both brothers developed cholestasis simultaneously. There was a prevalence for episodes of cholestasis in wintertime. The postprandial rise in serum sulfated glycolithocholic acid was increased in the patients, and the bile acid pool was enriched with secondary bile acids. In periods prior to cholestasis, the urinary 3 alpha OH-bile acid concentration was often elevated (greater than 50 mumoles per liter) without a clear correlation with the clinical prodromata. However, it could not be used as a predictor of cholestasis. In contrast, the postprandial rise in serum 3 alpha OH-bile acids was always grossly elevated in periods just before cholestasis. An increase both in fecal bile acid excretion as well as secondary bile acids in the bile acid pool indicated an increased spillover of bile acids into the large bowel. Cholestyramine administered directly after the first signs of cholestasis appeared to shorten an episode of cholestasis. On the other hand, withdrawal of cholestyramine in a cholestasis-free period may have resulted in an episode of cholestasis. Neither taurine supplementation for 3 and 7 weeks nor calcium phosphate, which binds sulfated bile acids in vitro, for 3 weeks could prevent an episode of cholestasis, although the latter normalized the bile acid pool composition. There is a rationale for a fat-restricted diet and cholestyramine therapy only as maintenance treatment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Patients with hepatocellular carcinoma or alcoholism were excluded. The prevalences of cholecystolithiasis increased along with the increasing duration and severity of chronic liver diseases, with a significant linear trend (p less than 0.001). The prevalences of cholecystolithiasis in patients with liver cirrhosis (18.5% in males, 31.2% in females) were 4 to 5.5 times higher than that of the healthy population (p less than 0.005). In addition, the linear trend of increasing prevalence with increasing age in the healthy population was not observed in patients with chronic liver diseases. On the other hand, five of the 69 patients with early liver cirrhosis were found to develop cholecystolithiasis during a mean follow-up period of 32 months. The calculated annual incidence of cholecystolithiasis was 2.6%. The results suggest that chronic liver disease, particularly liver cirrhosis, is a risk factor for cholecystolithiasis.\r"

We examined the amount of these vesicles in 33 human gallbladder biles in relation to biliary lipid composition and to the presence of cholesterol crystals. Biliary microscopy detected cholesterol crystals in all 19 biles from patients with cholesterol gallstones but in none of 14 biles from patients with pigment stones. Gel chromatography was used to separate vesicles and micelles in the native bile with an eluting buffer containing 10 mM sodium cholate to prevent disruption of micellar lipids. Cholesterol, phospholipid and bile salt concentrations were measured in every fraction collected. Bile acid, phospholipid, cholesterol and total lipid concentrations were not significantly different in samples with and without cholesterol crystals. The cholesterol saturation index (1.4 +/- 0.11 vs. 1.0 +/- 0.08) was significantly (p less than 0.01) higher in biles with crystals than without crystals. Gel filtration revealed a vesicular peak in addition to micellar fraction in 18 (23.1 +/- 3.2% of total cholesterol) of the 19 biles with crystals but only in three (15.7 +/- 2.4% of total cholesterol) of 14 biles without crystals. There was no relation between biliary lipid concentration or the cholesterol saturation index and the percentage of vesicular cholesterol in biles with or without crystals. The close association of vesicles and crystals in human gallbladder bile supports the contention that vesicles are important in the initial nucleation of cholesterol monohydrate crystals.\r"

D-Glucaro-1,4-lactone, 50 to 2,600 mu moles, was fed to adult Sprague-Dawley rats which had a bile fistula and were kept in metabolic cages for bile and urine collection. A total of 21 feeding experiments were carried out. Quantitation of D-glucaro-1,4-lactone and total D-glucaric acid as the sum of D-glucaric acid and its lactones in the bile and urine involved extraction of bile with tetrahexylammonium chloride, adjustment of pH, boiling and determination of percentage inhibition of beta-glucuronidase activity. The maximal velocity of beta-glucuronidase in the bile was also determined by the enzyme kinetic method. The results showed that 11% of administered D-glucaro-1,4-lactone was excreted in the urine and only 0.2% in the bile, with D-glucaro-1,4-lactone accounting for 20% of the total excreted D-glucaric acid. The concentration and excretory rate of total D-glucaric acid and D-glucaro-1,4-lactone in the urine, but not in the bile, were proportional to the amount of D-glucaro-1,4-lactone fed. The mean concentration of D-glucaro-1,4-lactone in the bile after feeding was 0.06 mM, which was capable of suppression of 75% of beta-glucuronidase activity. Oral administration of D-glucaro-1,4-lactone decreased biliary beta-glucuronidase concentration, slowed bile flow rate and hence decreased biliary beta-glucuronidase secretion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Activity of purified ferrochelatase is affected by the presence of certain fatty acids. In the present study, we examined whether the activity of ferrochelatase is altered by dietary manipulation of the composition of mitochondrial membrane phospholipid fatty acyl groups. Rats were fed diets containing triolein, safflower or menhaden oil as 5% (w/w) of the diet. After 3 weeks, the animals were killed and liver mitochondria were isolated. Phospholipid fatty acid composition and ferrochelatase activity were assayed in the isolated mitochondria. Marked differences were seen. The proportion of oleic acid was highest in the triolein oil-fed group, that of linoleic and arachidonic acid was highest in the safflower oil-fed group and the proportion of eicosapentaenoic acid was highest in the menhaden oil-fed group. Ferrochelatase activity was greatest in the triolein oil-fed group and lowest in the menhaden oil-fed group regardless of whether the mitochondria were intact, sonicated or sonicated and treated with Tween 20. Mixing of mitochondria from menhaden oil-fed rats with triolein oil resulted in a significant increase in ferrochelatase activity. Membrane fluidity and activities of the mitochondrial membrane enzymes succinic dehydrogenase and cytochrome oxidase did not differ among the groups. We conclude that dietary manipulation of mitochondrial membrane phospholipid fatty acyl group composition can directly modulate hepatic ferrochelatase activity. This has potential application in the treatment of protoporphyria, the genetic disorder in which ferrochelatase activity is deficient.\r"

This elevation of fibronectin appears to contribute to increased hepatic Kupffer cell phagocytic function observed with repetitive low-dose endotoxin administration. Although numerous cell types synthesize fibronectin, hepatocytes are believed to be the major cell source of fibronectin in the plasma. Since Kupffer cells also synthesize fibronectin, we sought to determine the relative contribution of hepatic Kupffer cells, as compared to parenchymal cells, to the elevation of plasma fibronectin following repetitive low-dose endotoxin administration. Kupffer cells isolated from rats previously treated for 3 consecutive days with 100 micrograms Salmonella enteritidis endotoxin released greater (p less than 0.01) amounts of fibronectin over time in culture (3, 6, 12 and 24 hr) as compared to Kupffer cells isolated from normal rats. Experiments in which fibronectin was normalized to DNA content of the cells in culture also showed similar results for fibronectin release by Kupffer cells (normal: 2.9 +/- 0.5 ng per microgram DNA per 24 hr; endotoxin-treated: 53.3 +/- 1.3 ng per microgram DNA per 24 hr). Hepatocytes from endotoxin-treated rats released less (p less than 0.01) fibronectin over time than hepatocytes isolated from normal animals. As with Kupffer cells, results for fibronectin release by hepatocytes were similar when normalized to the DNA content (normal: 190.0 +/- 9.4 ng per microgram DNA per 24 hr; endotoxin-treated: 83.3 +/- 4.2 ng per microgram DNA per 24 hr).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Rats were treated for 5 to 14 days with perfluoroacetate, perfluorobutyrate and perfluorooctanoate. Alterations in hepatic morphology with special reference to the peroxisomal compartment were investigated by light and electron microscopy following cytochemical staining of catalase activity with the alkaline 3,3'-diaminobenzidine medium. All three compounds induced hepatomegaly and peroxisome proliferation. Perfluorobutyrate and perfluorooctanoate were found to be more active than perfluoroacetate. Perfluorooctanoate-induced peroxisome proliferation was more prevalent in centrilobular than in periportal hepatocytes. Peroxisomes in centrilobular liver cells frequently were of round shape, exhibited diameters of up to 1.5 microns and were predominantly located within smooth endoplasmic reticulum-glycogen areas. In periportal cells, however, clusters of polymorphous peroxisomes ranging from 250 to 1,100 nm in diameter were observed at the periphery of smooth endoplasmic reticulum-glycogen regions. Peroxisome proliferation was accompanied by a change of peroxisomal and mitochondrial enzyme activities, in particular an increase in peroxisomal palmitoyl-CoA oxidation. Significant alterations in the concentration of peroxisomal matrix and membrane polypeptides were also noted. Within the first 2 days, perfluorooctanoate treatment exerted a strong hypolipidemic activity and both compounds perfluorooctanoate and perfluorobutyrate raised the level of hepatic free acid-soluble CoA nearly 10-fold as compared with control livers. The results suggest perfluorinated carboxylic acids to be model substances suitable to correlate biochemical and morphological parameters with the zonal heterogeneity of the peroxisomal compartment in rat liver. Due to the manifold hepatic effects, contact of humans with perfluorinated carboxylic acids or their metabolic precursors may represent a severe health risk.\r"

Before and after the supplementation period, B6 status was assessed by measuring fasting plasma vitamer levels and response to a 25 mg oral pyridoxine load. In addition, a 24-hr urine collection was analyzed during each load study for B6 metabolites. The data indicated that supplementation achieved repletion of peripheral B6 stores, as evidenced by: (i) a significant (p less than 0.005) rise in fasting plasma pyridoxal phosphate after supplementation (mean +/- S.D. = 56.8 +/- 30.5 nmoles per liter) as compared to initial levels (17.0 +/- 17.8 nmoles per liter); (ii) a higher (p less than 0.05) percentage excretion of the pyridoxine load as urinary 4-pyridoxic acid (31.0 +/- 9.3%) compared to the initial load (19.6 +/- 5.8%), and (iii) a postsupplementation area under the plasma concentration vs. time curve for pyridoxal phosphate (377 +/- 529 nmoles.hr per liter), which was decreased (p less than 0.005) from the presupplementation value (934 +/- 756 nmoles.hr per liter). The postsupplementation fasting plasma pyridoxal phosphate concentrations were within the normal range. The consequences of B6 repletion on amino acid metabolism were measured by oral protein loads (n = 4) or oral methionine loads (n = 4). No significant changes were observed for methionine or any other amino acid in regard to plasma fasting concentration, peak concentration or AUC. Although the vitamin B6 deficiency of cirrhosis was corrected by daily oral pyridoxine supplementation, there was apparently no improvement in the deranged amino acid metabolism.\r"

  ".W": "Alcoholic liver fibrosis is a relatively common form of alcoholic liver disease in Japan. It is regarded by some investigators as a prodromal stage of alcoholic liver cirrhosis, but little is known about the volumes of the liver and spleen in this disease state. Therefore, liver and spleen volumes were measured by computed tomography in 32 patients with alcoholic liver fibrosis in comparison with 10 healthy volunteers. Patients with alcoholic liver fibrosis were divided into three subgroups (13 of Grade 1, 9 of Grade 2 and 10 of Grade 3) according to the severity of fibrosis. The volume was calculated from the sum of the area measurements of successive transverse sections of the two organs. The liver volume (mean +/- S.D.) in Grade 2 alcoholic liver fibrosis (1,281 +/- 112 cm3) was significantly (p less than 0.01) larger than in healthy volunteers (1,017 +/- 73 cm3) and in Grade 1 (1,090 +/- 157 cm3), and the liver volume in Grade 3 (1,490 +/- 132 cm3) was larger than in Grade 2 (p less than 0.01). The mean volume of hepatocytes estimated by a two-dimensional image analysis system was significantly (p less than 0.05) larger in Grade 3 than in Grade 2, and that in Grade 2 was larger than in Grade 1. The spleen volume in Grade 3 (151 +/- 40 cm3) was significantly (p less than 0.01) larger than in healthy volunteers (86 +/- 26 cm3), Grade 1 (89 +/- 38 cm3) and Grade 2 (68 +/- 19 cm3). The presumed reason for hepatic volume increase would be the ballooning of hepatocytes along with increased fibrotic component.\r"

  ".W": "An imbalance of excitatory and inhibitory amino acid-ergic neurotransmission has been suggested to play a role in the pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy. For further evaluation of this hypothesis, several parameters of amino acid-ergic neurotransmission were studied in rats with acute liver failure induced by the administration of 300 mg per kg thioacetamide by gavage on two consecutive days. By appropriate supportive care, hypoglycemia, renal failure and hypothermia were avoided. Rats were monitored clinically and neurologically. Hepatic encephalopathy evolved in four distinct, easily recognizable stages. Light and electron microscopic examination of brains of rats with hepatic encephalopathy revealed only a slight swelling of nuclei of neurons and astrocytes without signs of neuronal degeneration or brain edema. In rats with hepatic encephalopathy, the concentrations of GABA, glutamate and taurine were decreased in the cerebral cortex, the hippocampus and the striatum, whereas those of aspartate and glycine were unchanged or increased. GABAA and benzodiazepine receptors were studied as parameters for the postsynaptic GABAA-benzodiazepine receptor complex, glutamic acid decarboxylase as parameter for presynaptic GABA-ergic neurons and stimulation of benzodiazepine binding by GABA as a parameter for a GABA-mediated postsynaptic event. None of these parameters was different in hepatic encephalopathy as compared to controls. Similarly, Ca++/Cl(-)-dependent and -independent glutamate receptors as parameters for glutamatergic neurons were unchanged in rats with hepatic encephalopathy. Thus, in rats with thioacetamide-induced liver failure and hepatic encephalopathy, changes of the concentrations of neurotransmitter amino acids occur in the brain. Other neurochemical parameters, however, failed to identify alterations of GABA-ergic or glutamatergic neurotransmission in hepatic encephalopathy.\r"

  ".W": "Morris hepatoma 44, whose growth is sensitive to thyroid hormones and prolactin, contains specific receptors for these hormones. In the present experiments, male Buffalo rats bearing Morris hepatoma 7787 were studied to determine the effects of several sex steroid hormones. Castration 1 week postimplantation inhibited tumor growth relative to controls (-53%). Replacement with testosterone propionate (1 mg per day s.c. injection) restored tumor growth to control levels, whereas administration of testosterone (2 mg per day s.c. injection) to castrated controls resulted in significant stimulation. Testosterone administered to control animals at a dose of 1 mg per day stimulated tumor growth (62%), whereas 2 mg per day failed to do so. Progesterone (4-pregnon-3,20-dione) at doses of 125 or 250 micrograms per day (Silastic implants) had no effect on tumor growth, whereas 500 micrograms per day stimulated tumor growth relative to controls. Estrogen (17 beta-estradiol) at doses of 6, 12, or 24 micrograms per day (Silastic implants) did not influence tumor growth. Cytoplasmic testosterone receptors have been demonstrated in tumors (2.2 +/- 0.8 fmoles per mg cytoplasm), although specific cytoplasmic estrogen and progesterone receptors could not be identified in this model. In female rats bearing either Morris hepatoma 44, 7787 or 5123-D, testosterone markedly stimulated tumor growth (226, 328 and 58%, respectively, relative to controls). In conclusion, although Morris hepatoma 7787 appears to be androgen (testosterone) dependent and contains cytoplastic androgen receptors, it lacks specific cytoplasmic receptors for estrogen and progesterone and is not influenced by these hormones except at very high doses of progesterone.\r"

In vivo expression of antigens has been directly assessed by in situ radioimmunohistology. This technique allows one to determine the distribution and density of antigen expression at the individual cellular level on fresh hepatoma and adjacent uninvolved liver tissue. We have found two antigens recognized by monoclonal antibodies XF-8 and AF-20 that are uniformly present on 15/15 hepatocellular carcinomas tested thus far. Most if not all tumor cells highly express these antigens. Such antigens were not evident on adjacent normal liver and the XF-8 epitope was not found on other normal human tissues. AF-20 antigen distribution revealed low-level expression on a subpopulation of cells in the zona glomerulosa of the adrenal gland and on crypt cells of the small intestinal tract. We have studied the capability of radiolabeled XF-8 and AF-20 monoclonal antibodies when administered either alone or in combination to localize a hepatitis B virus-related hepatocellular carcinoma cell line (FOCUS) grown as subcutaneous tumors in nude mice. Biodistribution experiments demonstrated an excellent localization to tumor of 15 to 22% of the injected dose of 125I-labeled antibodies. Indeed, it was possible to enhance the delivery of 125I to the tumor cell surface by the use of XF-8 and AF-20 in combination. Nuclear imaging studies showed sharp visualization of tumor and demonstrate that these monoclonal antibodies have sufficient specificity and sensitivity to be strongly considered as immunotargeting agents.\r"

  ".W": "To investigate the role of vasoconstrictor hormones in vascular smooth muscle cell growth we have studied the effects of the potent vasoconstrictor angiotensin II on cell growth in a cultured rat aortic cell model. Angiotensin II was not mitogenic for these cells, as assessed by determining cell number, nor was it synergistic in this regard with 10% calf serum. However, 24-hour exposure to 100 nM angiotensin II caused an 80% increase in protein synthesis (compared with 0.4% increase with serum control) as measured by tritiated leucine incorporation. This was a \"hypertrophic\" response as indicated by a 30% increase in protein content and a 45% increase in cell volume. Angiotensin II-induced smooth muscle cell hypertrophy was maximal at 100 nM, had an ED50 of 1 nM, and was inhibited by the competitive antagonist [Sar1, Ile8]angiotensin II. The increase in protein synthesis required continuous presence of angiotensin II for 6 hours and required messenger RNA (mRNA) synthesis as suggested by complete inhibition after exposure to actinomycin D. Angiotensin II-stimulated protein synthesis was dependent on a rise in intracellular Ca2+ concentration evidenced by a 70% decrease in tritiated leucine incorporation after chelation of Ca2+ with 25 microM quin 2-AM. This treatment did not alter protein synthesis induced by 10% calf serum. Decreasing extracellular Na+ to prevent Na+/H+ exchange and intracellular alkalinization did not inhibit the angiotensin II response but decreased the 10% calf serum-stimulated protein synthesis by 35%. Downregulation of protein kinase C by 24-hour treatment with phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate did not inhibit angiotensin II-induced protein synthesis, while phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-stimulated protein synthesis was abolished. These findings suggest that angiotensin II-induced hypertrophy, acting via a Ca2+ mechanism, may play an important role in abnormal vascular smooth muscle cell growth in certain forms of hypertension.\r"

Accordingly, the present study was done to test the hypothesis that, in the absence of antidiuretic hormone and antidiuretic hormone-dependent prostaglandin synthesis, the pressure natriuresis response is blunted. Experiments were performed on Brattleboro diabetes insipidus rats (n = 7) and Long Evans control rats (n = 14). A change in perfusion pressure in the Long Evans rats from 89.3 +/- 1.0 to 108.7 +/- 1.1 mm Hg (p less than 0.05) was associated with significant increases in the fractional excretion of sodium (1.1 +/- 0.2 to 2.3 +/- 0.3%) and the urinary prostaglandin excretion (32.6 +/- 6.8 to 56.6 +/- 10.0 pg/min). In contrast, a similar change in perfusion pressure in the diabetes insipidus rat from 88.6 +/- 1.4 to 106.2 +/- 1.5 mm Hg (p less than 0.05) resulted in no significant increases in either sodium or prostaglandin excretions. Treatment of a third group of diabetes insipidus rats (n = 9) with 1-desamino-8-D-arginine vasopressin (1 microgram/day) restored the natriuretic response to increases in renal perfusion pressure. Treated diabetes insipidus and Long Evans control rats had comparable natriuretic responses to increases in renal perfusion pressure. Untreated diabetes insipidus rats, on the other hand, had blunted responses. In summary, the pressure natriuresis response in diabetes insipidus rats is blunted compared with Long Evans control rats. We conclude that antidiuretic hormone is necessary for the complete expression of the pressure natriuresis response.\r"

Renal deafferentation performed between 3 and 4 weeks after birth did not influence the course of the development of high blood pressure when compared with sham-operated rats. Mean arterial pressure, heart rate, and plasma norepinephrine concentrations were similar in both groups when measured at 13 weeks after renal deafferentation. However, blood pressure responses to ganglionic blockade with hexamethonium were significantly reduced in the renal deafferented SHR. Baroreceptor reflex sensitivity, assessed by heart rate responses to blood pressure changes induced by phenylephrine and nitroprusside, was significantly enhanced in these rats. When renal deafferentation was performed in adult SHR with established hypertension, mean arterial pressure decreased slightly but significantly by 5%. Heart rate, plasma norepinephrine concentrations, and responses to hexamethonium were not affected by this procedure. However, in the renal deafferented adult SHR, heart rate responses to phenylephrine but not to nitroprusside were significantly increased. Thus, in contrast to efferent renal nerves, afferent renal nerves do not play an important role in the development and maintenance of high blood pressure in SHR, but may contribute to the mechanisms that alter sympathetic function and baroreceptor reflex sensitivity in SHR during the development of hypertension.\r"

  ".W": "An endogenous substance in brain, clonidine-displacing substance, binds to the same receptor populations as clonidine and is biologically active. Since receptor binding sites can be modeled by using specific antiligand antibodies, we tested the hypothesis that polyclonal antibodies raised in rat and rabbit against the clonidine analog p-aminoclonidine coupled to hemocyanin would recognize compounds structurally related to clonidine, including clonidine-displacing substance. Binding to anti-p-aminoclonidine antibodies was examined by using a competitive radioimmunoassay with tritiated p-aminoclonidine as the radioligand. Central vasodepressor agents that, like clonidine, are known to bind with high affinity to both imidazole sites and alpha 2-adrenergic receptors in brain inhibited radioligand binding to anti-p-aminoclonidine antibodies. All of these agents contain imidazol(in)e and phenyl ring moieties as part of their chemical structures (e.g., oxymetazoline); a number of other compounds without one or both of these rings failed to cross-react with the antisera. Clonidine-displacing substance, partially purified from bovine brain, also inhibited specific radioligand binding to anti-p-aminoclonidine antibodies. The inhibition was dose dependent and high affinity (IC50, 4 Units). The endogenous substance had no effect on the apparent affinity of the antibodies for the radioligand, but blocked a specific number of binding sites. Immunoprecipitation experiments showed that authentic clonidine-displacing substance, that which displaces tritiated p-aminoclonidine binding to membrane receptors, is recognized by anti-p-aminoclonidine antibodies. We conclude that a unique subset of structural determinants required for ligand interaction with both imidazole and alpha 2-adrenergic receptors is critical for binding to anti-p-aminoclonidine antibodies, and that since clonidine-displacing substance is recognized by highly clonidine-specific antisera, it may also contain these determinants within its structure, namely the imidazol(in)e and phenyl ring systems.\r"

The present study, therefore, examined the effect of cyclosporine A on Ca2+ kinetics and contraction in primary cultures of vascular smooth muscle cells. Cyclosporine A (10 micrograms/ml) did not affect resting intracellular free Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) levels (151 +/- 10 vs. 146 +/- 5 nM, NS), but augmented the 10(-8) M arginine vasopressin-induced increase of [Ca2+]i (delta 76 +/- 4 vs. delta 172 +/- 6 nM, p less than 0.001). This effect of cyclosporine A was also observed in Ca2+-free medium. Arginine vasopressin-stimulated [Ca2+]i efflux within 30 seconds compared with baseline efflux rates (1,644 +/- 146 vs. 2,591 +/- 373 cpm/mg prot/30 sec, p less than 0.005), but this transient effect was significantly greater (p less than 0.001) with arginine vasopressin plus cyclosporine A (1,702 +/- 133 vs. 5,605 +/- 1235 cpm/mg prot/30 sec, p less than 0.01). Basal 45Ca2+ efflux rates were not affected by cyclosporine A, and prior incubation of the cells with cyclosporine A was required to elicit the augmentory effect. 45Ca2+ uptake was measured to examine the mechanism by which cyclosporine A may affect [Ca2+]i stores. Cyclosporine A increased Ca2+ uptake when compared with control (6.38 +/- 0.69 vs. 10.99 +/- 0.59 x 10(3) cpm/mg prot/5 min, p less than 0.001). This effect was not blocked by the Ca2+ antagonist verapamil.

  ".W": "Hearts with advanced pressure-overload hypertrophy from systemic hypertension have been shown to have an increased susceptibility to the development of diastolic dysfunction in response to tissue hypoxia and ischemia. It is not known if this propensity to develop diastolic dysfunction in response to ischemia is dependent on the presence of a substantial increase in left ventricular mass, or alternatively, is characteristic of hearts subjected to mild chronic hypertension early in the development of cardiac hypertrophy. We tested the hypothesis that systemic hypertension associated with mild left ventricular hypertrophy increases the susceptibility to the development of diastolic dysfunction in response to demand ischemia. The effects of demand ischemia (6 minutes) were studied in hearts from New Zealand white rabbits with chronic systemic hypertension produced by the one-kidney, one-wrap method (n = 15) and compared with age-matched, sham-operated control rabbits (n = 11) with similar left ventricular mass (5.4 +/- 0.2 vs. 5.4 +/- 0.3 g, respectively). The hearts were studied using an isolated, isovolumic (balloon in left ventricle) preparation with absent pericardium that was perfused with fresh whole blood. At baseline, coronary perfusion pressure was 100 mm Hg with comparable coronary flow per gram left ventricular weight; the hearts were paced at a physiological rate of 3 Hz, and the left ventricular balloon volume was adjusted to achieve a left ventricular end-diastolic pressure of 15 mm Hg in both groups. Left ventricular balloon volume was similar in both groups and volume was thereafter held constant. At baseline, left ventricular systolic pressure (114 +/- 4 vs. 95 +/- 3 mm Hg, p less than 0.001) and developed pressure (18.9 +/- 1.2 vs. 15.1 +/- 0.9 mm Hg/g, p less than 0.05) were higher in the hearts from the hypertensive group in comparison with the control group. During the first minute of global ischemia produced by reducing coronary perfusion pressure from 100 to 20 mm Hg, there was an immediate fall in left ventricular systolic pressure in both groups without an increase in diastolic pressure. In response to the superimposition of pacing tachycardia (heart rate, 6 Hz) during the remaining 5 minutes of the period of ischemia, left ventricular developed pressure was comparable. However, isovolumic left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (measured during long diastoles obtained with transient cessation of pacing) rose to a significantly higher level in the hearts from hypertensive rabbits than in those from the control rabbits (29 +/- 3 vs. 18 +/- 2 mm Hg, p less than 0.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Case-control studies suggest that increased erythrocyte sodium-lithium countertransport may predict increased susceptibility to the development of essential hypertension. To characterize interindividual variation in sodium-lithium countertransport and its relation to blood pressure levels in the general population, we studied 1,475 Caucasians between 5 and 89 years of age (711 males and 764 females) ascertained through 266 households with children in the schools of Rochester, Minnesota. Individuals who were taking antihypertensive agents or combinations of estrogen and progesterone were not included in the sample. A third-order polynomial regression on age accounted for only a small fraction of variability in sodium-lithium countertransport (2.8% in males, p less than 0.001; 2.1% in females, p less than 0.01), whereas a fourth-order regression on age accounted for a large proportion of variability in systolic blood pressure (45.7% in males, p less than 0.001; 52.5% in females, p less than 0.001) and diastolic blood pressure (39.8% in males, p less than 0.001; 33.0% in females, p less than 0.001). Mean sodium-lithium countertransport was higher in males than females at all ages; but the rank order of male and female means for systolic and diastolic blood pressure was age dependent. Positively skewed distributions for age-, height-, and weight-adjusted sodium-lithium countertransport in male and female cohorts between 5-19.9, 20-49.9, and 50-89.9 years of age were explained significantly better by postulating a mixture of two partially overlapping sodium-lithium countertransport distributions rather than a single normal distribution (p less than 0.01). Among men in the 20-49.9-year-old cohort, adjusted sodium-lithium countertransport values in the upper distribution were associated with higher systolic and diastolic blood pressure (mean +/- SD) than values in the lower distribution (for systolic blood pressure: 115 +/- 11 vs. 111 +/- 11 mm Hg, p less than 0.07; for diastolic blood pressure: 71.2 +/- 8.0 vs. 68.4 +/- 8.6 mm Hg, p less than 0.08). Among females in the 50-89.9-year-old cohort, adjusted sodium-lithium countertransport values in the upper distribution were associated with significantly greater diastolic blood pressure than values in the lower distribution (77 +/- 10 vs. 70 +/- 9 mm Hg, p less than 0.03).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Hemodialysis with the cuprophan membrane caused no significant changes in plasma MMS levels or in the neurological condition of patients. The effect of dialysis with AN 69 membrane depended on initial plasma MMS levels. Initially high plasma MMS levels decreased significantly and significant improvement of neuropathy was achieved. In neuropathic patients with plasma MMS levels similar to those of symptom-free patients, hemodialysis with AN 69 membrane had no effect.

As regards glucose metabolism, after one month of regular HD-HP treatment glycemic curves during the intravenous glucose tolerance test (IVGTT) were perfectly matched with those in HD. However, insulin production was lower, with a reduction of the insulin resistance index. Differences did not reach statistical significance.

No difference was seen between mean FN concentrations using different dialyzer membranes. Nevertheless, plasma FN levels were significantly higher in subjects after intermittent hemofiltration. There was no evidence of activation of the coagulation system or of any correlation between FN and fibrinogen values. These findings suggest that conventional hemodialysis is not effective in improving the low levels of plasma FN found in uremic patients, whereas intermittent hemofiltration raises FN. These differences may be due to the fact that during hemofiltration, even when using the same dialyzer membranes as in conventional hemodialysis, some \"substances\" with high molecular weight that could block the synthesis of FN could be removed.\r"

A gated blood pool scan was obtained with a gamma camera after injection of 40 mCi Tc-labelled albumin. The animals were restrained in a sling to avoid movement artifacts. All animals showed a drop of 65 +/- 12% to 42 +/- 14% EF in the first postoperative (p.o.) week. Left ventricular output did not maintain sufficient blood pressure as assessed by pump-off tests. Systolic blood pressure dropped from 122 +/- 6.5 mm Hg to 81 +/- 6 mm Hg without pump support on the morning of the first p.o. day. Apical coring and possible restrained heart movement by the implanted LVAD may lead to impaired myocardial function that renders the individual LVAD dependent until adaptative corrections take place.\r"

  ".W": "The occurrence of late complications in implanted cardiac prosthetic valves has emphasized the need for the development of an animal model in which these complications are reproducible. Sheep constitute an excellent model for chronical and pathological studies of prosthetic devices. In our experience, survival of sheep following implantation of prosthetic valves is closely related to postoperative serum colloid osmotic pressure (C.O.P.). The normal range as measured in 28 healthy sheep was 16.67 +/- 0.55 mm Hg. A protocol was developed to maintain the colloid hydrostatic pressure gradient (C.H.P.G.) as close as possible to the normal physiological range, and to delay the extubation until the C.O.P. was within this range, and the C.H.P.G. greater than 7 mm Hg. Using the above protocol, a new tri-leaflet polyurethane valve was inserted into eight, five to seven month old sheep in place of the mitral and tricuspidal valves. One hour after terminating the extacorporeal circuit, the C.O.P. was measured at 13.10 +/- 0.96; but within five to six hours, it rose to 17.1 +/- 1.1. During the same period, the C.H.P.G. increased from 3.02 +/- 0.96 to 7.6 +/- 0.50 mm Hg. The postoperative period was uneventful, and all animals survived. We have thus concluded that the routine measurement and monitoring of C.O.P. constitutes a guide of great clinical importance.\r"

We have done many plasmapheresis experiments in vitro, using hollow-fiber filters (500-1000 cm2) and fresh bovine blood collected on ACD or heparin. The comparison between predicted and experimentally obtained filtration rates was good for models based on the concentration polarization theory and lift velocity theory. In other experiments with pulsatile inlet flow we found that plasma filtration rate increased by 20 to 50% compared to non-pulsatile conditions. These results are in good agreement with the modified model of ultrafiltration incorporating pulsating flow. This paper presents relationships between plasma filtration velocity (steady and pulsating flow) and hemolysis limit as a function of wall shear rate and filter size.\r"

Trasferrin saturation decreased from 90 +/- 8.7% to 17 +/- 10.6% and serum ferritin from 3164 micrograms/L +/- 1488 to 60.5 micrograms/L +/- 77.5, and liver iron content normalized in all cases. Initial serum ferritin in the patients who were iron-depleted at 18 months (50%, cumulative percentage) was significantly lower than in those still iron loaded at that time (2280 micrograms/L +/- 940 vs 4049 micrograms/L +/- 1444, p less than 0.02). Clinical improvement was noted in all cases with about a 30% decrease in insulin requirement in most diabetics.

  ".W": "The present study reports cerebral blood flow (CBF) measurements in 11 patients during attacks of classic migraine (CM)--migraine with aura. In 6 and 7 patients, respectively, cerebral vascular reactivity to increased blood pressure and to hypocapnia was also investigated during the CM attacks. The Xenon-133 intraarterial injection technique was used to measure CBF. In this study, based in part on previously published data, methodological limitations, in particular caused by scattered radiation (Compton scatter), are critically analysed. Based on this analysis and the results of the CBF studies it is concluded: During CM attacks CBF appears to decrease focally in the posterior part of the brain to a level around 20 ml/100 g/min which is consistent with a mild degree of ischemia. Changes of CBF in focal low flow areas are difficult to evaluate accurately with the Xe-133 technique. In most cases true CBF may change 50% or more in the low flow areas without giving rise to significantly measurable changes of CBF. This analysis suggests that the autoregulation response cannot be evaluated in the low flow areas with the technique used while the observations are compatible with the concept that a vasoconstrictive state, unresponsive to hypocapnia, prevails in the low flow areas during CM attacks. The gradual increase in size of the low flow area seen in several cases may be interpreted in two different ways. A spreading process may actually exist. However, due to Compton scatter, a gradual decrease of CBF in a territory that does not increase in size will also appear as a gradually spreading low flow area when studied with the Xe-133 intracarotid technique.\r"

Although commonly seen with SLE or other collagen vascular diseases, the antibodies frequently occur in the absence of any such disease. Neurologic complications include transient or permanent ischemic episodes, migraine or related phenomena, myelopathy and a Guillain-Barre type syndrome. In this report we describe the presenting features and clinical course of six patients with anti-phospholipid antibodies where migraine was an early and prominent symptom. All six patients, however, were recognized only after a second more serious event had occurred. As this entity becomes more widely recognized and better treatments evolve an earlier diagnosis of patients with migraine as the only manifestation of APA may prevent the development of other serious complications.\r"

Cell suspensions of basophils were stimulated with scalar dilutions of anti-IgE, f-met-peptide and Ca2+ ionophore A23187. Histamine was measured by an automated fluorimetric method; LTB4 and LTC4 with RIA in individual cases, and with Reverse-Phase HPLC in the two pools obtained from the supernatants of CH patients and controls. Mean values of histamine release in patients with CH were significantly lower when compared to those obtained in control subjects after stimulation with anti-IgE at the three dilutions used. LTC4 mean levels measured in CH patients were significantly lower than those of supernatants from controls after stimulation with 0.05 gamma/ml of A23187. A reduction of LTC4 and LTB4 levels in CH patients was also observed in R-P HPLC, which showed different elution patterns in the two groups. The histamine release in individual cases was related to leukotriene production: LTC4 levels were significantly (p less than .05) higher in \"high histamine releasers\" than in \"low histamine releasers\". Our results indicate that CH patients have complex abnormalities of histamine release and of leukotriene production during the painless phase of the disease.\r"

Occurrence of DM, HBP, MI and stroke was compared for mothers and fathers of migraine vs. those of control subjects and no significant differences were found. The mothers and fathers were pooled and resegregated by presence or absence of RSHA and then occurrence of DM, HBP, MI and stroke again compared. For mothers there was increased occurrence of stroke and DM in the RSHA group but the differences were not significant. For RSHA fathers there was increased incidence of MI (p less than .10) and HBP (p less than .01). Aggregate occurrence of all ASRD was evaluated for RSHA vs. no-RSHA parents. ASRD occurred more frequently in the RSHA than in the no-RSHA parents (p less than .05). Breakdown by age showed that this occurred at all ages in men (p less than .05) but in women the difference was significant only under age 60 (p less than .05). This study suggests that RSHA, which is primarily migraine, may be a risk factor or a marker for occurrence of ASRD.\r"

Reliability determined by using Cronbach's alpha revealed an internal consistency of 0.96. Concurrent validity testing with the Glasgow Coma Scale indicated a strong positive correlation, r = 0.94. Construct validity was assessed with factor analysis using 0.50 for a loading criterion. Three factors were demonstrated: general level of consciousness, muscle tone and resistance, and chewing or yawning.

Natural field observation of 30 nurse-patient dyads in three hospital critical care units yielded frequency data in four categories: form of affectional touch, Weiss' qualitative factors, accompaniments, and stimulus. Frequencies of affectional touch and of proximity without touch were also obtained. Modal instances of affectional touch in a 1-hour period were 2, with a range of 0 to 17. Form of affectional touch most frequently used was sustained stationary, with stroking least frequent. The majority of instances of affectional touch were of short duration and low intensity, with visible reaction indicating comfort in approximately two thirds of the instances. Almost three fourths of the instances were accompanied by visual regard and two thirds by vocalization. Patient stimulus before affectional touch was indirect in 52% of the instances and unidentified in another 32%. This study provides clear evidence that, although the use of touch as a nursing comfort measure is widely advocated, affectional touch is infrequent. These results provide information useful to the further development of prescriptive theory for affectional touch in nursing practice situations.\r"

  ".W": "The anticoagulant action of heparin is mediated through antithrombin III, and the postoperative decrease in the plasma concentration of antithrombin III may contribute to the relative ineffectiveness of prophylaxis with low-dose heparin in preventing venous thrombosis after total hip arthroplasty. We conducted a prospective, randomized trial to compare the effectiveness of a regimen of antithrombin III, given intravenously once daily, and low-dose heparin with a regimen of dextran 40, given intravenously, in preventing venographically documented venous thrombosis after total hip arthroplasty. The results demonstrated an incidence of venous thrombosis of 4.9 per cent in patients who received antithrombin III and heparin; this was significantly lower than the incidence (28.6 per cent) in patients who received dextran 40 (p less than 0.005). Venous thrombosis occurred only in patients who had total hip arthroplasty with a cemented prosthesis (fourteen of fifty-seven patients, or 24.6 per cent); none of the twenty-six patients in whom a non-cemented prosthesis was used had venous thrombosis (p less than 0.01). Of the patients in whom a cemented prosthesis had been inserted, the incidence of venous thrombosis was lower in those who were treated with antithrombin III and heparin (7.4 per cent) than in those who were treated with dextran 40 (40 per cent) (p less than 0.005). Postoperative levels of antithrombin III were maintained at more than 90 per cent of the baseline level in patients who received it; this was significantly higher than in patients who received dextran 40.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Only patients who were more than sixty-five years old and had a fracture of the hip were excluded. Arterial blood gases, injury-severity score at the time of admission, pulmonary function, days in the hospital, days in the intensive-care unit, and hospital costs were recorded for all patients. The patients were divided into two groups: those who had an isolated fracture of the femur and those who had multiple injuries. When stabilization of the fracture was delayed in the patients who had multiple injuries, the incidence of pulmonary complications (adult respiratory-distress syndrome, fat embolism, and pneumonia) was higher, the hospital stay was longer, and the number of days in the intensive-care unit was increased. The cost of hospital care showed a statistically significant increase for all patients who had delayed treatment of the fracture compared with those who had early stabilization.\r"

Thirty-one patients had preoperative and postoperative gait analyses. Standard parameters, such as velocity, cadence, and stride length, were evaluated, as were motion graphs of the hip, knee, and ankle. There was little difference between the preoperative and postoperative mean values for velocity, cadence, and stride length, which were expressed as percentages of normal for the patient's age. The contours of the postoperative motion graphs of the knees changed very little compared with those of the preoperative graphs; when a graph showed restricted motion preoperatively, it did so postoperatively. Although extension of the knee in stance phase improved postoperatively, the improvement was accompanied by decreased flexion of the knee during swing phase. When spasticity of both the hamstrings and the quadriceps was noted on the preoperative electromyogram, motion of the knee in the sagittal plane was markedly restricted.\r"

Twenty-eight fractures were treated with a long thumb-spica cast and twenty-three, with a short thumb-spica cast. The hands that initially were treated with a long thumb-spica cast were placed in a short thumb-spica cast after six weeks. Fractures that initially were treated with a long thumb-spica cast united at an average of 9.5 weeks and those that were maintained in a short thumb-spica cast, at an average of 12.7 weeks. There were no non-unions and two delayed unions in the fractures that initially were treated with a long thumb-spica cast, compared with two non-unions and six delayed unions in those that had only a short thumb-spica cast. Fractures of the proximal or middle third of the carpal scaphoid had a significantly shorter time to union when they were treated initially in a long thumb-spica cast.

Preoperatively, the average duration of symptoms was thirty-two months. The symptoms included a waddling gait and crepitus, pain, and tenderness over the symphysis pubis. The early radiographic signs of the disease were rarefaction of the adjacent pubic bones and widening of the symphysis pubis. Later signs included sclerosis and narrowing of the symphyseal joint space. Pathological examination of the resected joint revealed chronic inflammatory reaction in all patients. At an average of fourteen months postoperatively, all of the patients had marked improvement and were fully active. However, at an average of ninety-two months postoperatively, three of the ten patients were not satisfied with the result. One patient needed bilateral sacro-iliac arthrodesis for pain that was caused by instability.\r"

All fourteen were hospitalized, and epidural block anesthesia was instituted with an indwelling catheter for an average of four days, during which continuous passive motion, manipulation (as necessary), stimulation of muscles, and alternating hot and cold soaks were used. The average length of follow-up was thirty-two months. Eleven patients had complete resolution of the symptoms, two had sufficient intermittent aching with changes in the weather to need medication, and one had no relief. The diagnosis was confirmed if the symptoms were relieved by a lumbar sympathetic block. Pain that was out of proportion to the severity of the injury was the most consistent finding, being present in all fourteen patients. However, variation in clinical severity is characteristic of the syndrome. Eleven of the fourteen patients had had a previous patellar operation. After the onset of the symptoms, nine patients had two or more arthroscopic examinations, without notable findings. All fourteen patients had had extensive physical therapy and medical treatment before the epidural block was performed.\r"

Complete data were collected for each patient for the following variables: age; sex; location of the tumor and its size, grade, depth, and compartmental status; chemotherapy; and dose of radiation. The surgical margins were characterized as positive or negative for histological evidence of disease on the basis of an independent review of the pathological and operative reports by a surgeon and a radiation oncologist who were experienced in the management of sarcoma. Cox multivariate analysis was used to determine which of these variables contributed to local recurrence and evidence of systemic disease. Adequacy of the margin of resection was the only variable that was associated with local relapse (p = 0.0004). The size of the tumor (p = 0.0008) was the major determinant of the risk of systemic disease.\r"

Twenty patients had had an isolated atlanto-axial subluxation; five, isolated cranial settling; and four, subaxial subluxation alone. Twenty patients had an atlanto-axial arthrodesis; sixteen, an occipitocervical arthrodesis; and five, a posterior arthrodesis of the subaxial spine. In addition, two patients had a transoral odontoidectomy and one, an anterior cervical vertebrectomy. At the latest follow-up, thirty-six (88 per cent) of the patients had osseous union, two had fibrous union but were stable, and three had a non-union. All of the problems with union occurred in the patients who had had an isolated atlanto-axial arthrodesis. Clinically, twenty-seven (66 per cent) of the patients had improved, fourteen were unchanged, and none were worse. The preoperative neurological status remained the same postoperatively in thirty patients (73 per cent) and it improved in eleven (27 per cent). Twenty-one of the twenty-three patients who had had marked pain preoperatively had little or no pain at the latest follow-up. Complications included a transient hemiparesis in one patient, a superficial wound infection in two, displacement of an anterior graft in one, a broken wire in three, and erosion of methylmethacrylate into the outer part of the occipital cortex in one. Four patients died, but not as a result of the operation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Ten of the compartment syndromes were associated with an ipsilateral femoral fracture; five of these femoral fractures were open. In five patients, the syndrome followed femoral intramedullary stabilization. The remaining eleven syndromes followed blunt trauma to the thigh, prolonged compression by body weight, or vascular injury. The patients who were awake and alert at the time of the examination complained of intense pain in the thigh, and they had neuromuscular deficits. For the patients who could not cooperate with a subjective physical examination because they were under general anesthesia or because of associated injuries, the measurement of compartment pressure assumed a more important diagnostic role. All of the patients had tense swelling of the involved thigh. The predisposing risk factors for the development of compartment syndromes of the thigh, which are common in the multiply injured population, include: systemic hypotension, a history of external compression of the thigh, the use of military antishock trousers, coagulopathy, vascular injury, and trauma to the thigh, with or without a fracture of the femur. In approximately one-half of these patients, a crush syndrome developed, with myoglobinuria, renal failure, and collapse of multiple organ systems. Eight patients (47 per cent) died as a result of multiple injuries. Of the nine patients (ten compartment syndromes) who survived, infection developed at the site of the fasciotomy in six. Follow-up examination revealed marked morbidity, including sensory deficit and motor weakness of the lower extremity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

When lateral meniscectomy was done in addition to resection of the anterior cruciate ligament, anterior translation did not increase compared with that measured after isolated section of the anterior cruciate ligament.

This differed from the results after excision of the medial meniscus and section of the anterior cruciate ligament; in that situation, medial meniscectomy resulted in significantly more anterior translation.\r"

  ".W": "Using an animal model, we examined the use of pulsed electromagnetic fields, induced at a physiological frequency and intensity, to prevent the osteoporosis that is concomitant with disuse. By protecting the left ulnae of turkeys from functional loading, we noted a loss of bone of 13.0 per cent compared with the intact contralateral control ulnae over an eight-week experimental period. Using a treatment regimen of one hour per day of pulsed electromagnetic fields, we observed an osteogenic dose-response to induced electrical power, with a maximum osteogenic effect between 0.01 and 0.04 tesla per second. Pulse power levels of more or less than these levels were less effective. The maximum osteogenic response was obtained by a decrease in the level of intracortical remodeling, inhibition of endosteal resorption, and stimulation of both periosteal and endosteal new-bone formation. These data suggest that short daily periods of exposure to appropriate electromagnetic fields can beneficially influence the behavior of the cell populations that are responsible for bone-remodeling, and that there is an effective window of induced electrical power in which bone mass can be controlled in the absence of mechanical loading.\r"

The average age at the time of operation was fifteen years, and the average length of follow-up was twenty-one years. Of the thirty feet, the result in two (7 per cent) was rated excellent; in five (17 per cent), good; in nine (30 per cent), fair; and in fourteen (47 per cent), poor. Each of the fourteen feet that had a poor result had severe impairment of function and needed an orthosis. Six limbs had an arthrodesis of the ankle for degenerative joint disease. Progressive muscle imbalance resulted in recurrent cavovarus deformity in seven feet that initially had had satisfactory alignment. Degenerative changes of the ankle and joints of the mid-part of the foot were noted radiographically in twenty-three feet. The large number of unsatisfactory long-term results in these patients who had had a triple arthrodesis for deformity of the foot secondary to progressive peripheral neuropathy differs from those in earlier reports on patients who had poliomyelitis, who retained normal sensation and had a permanent, stable muscle imbalance. We believe that triple arthrodesis should be considered only as a salvage procedure in patients who have progressive peripheral neuropathy and should be limited to those who have severe, rigid deformity.\r"

The shearing force produced by longitudinal compression applied to the foot of the operated leg was recorded. The results in 41 consecutive patients all followed for 30 months, showed that fractures with early loosening or nonunion had all had significantly poorer stability than the fractures that had healed. Impaction improved stability in only 23 out of the 41 fractures; in the others stability had deteriorated or was unchanged.\r"

We used this method in 44 consecutive patients in a prospective study with no exclusions, followed for a minimum of 24 months. All fractures healed within 12 months, and there were no cases of early loosening or nonunion. In four cases, late segmental collapse had developed during the mean follow-up period of 30 months.\r"

Deep vein thrombosis was diagnosed using impedance plethysmography and the 125I fibrinogen uptake test, combined, in selected cases, with ascending contrast venography. The overall incidence of deep vein thrombosis was 20%. Nine patients (13%) developed deep vein thrombosis in the spinal group and nineteen (27%) in the general anaesthetic group (p less than 0.05). The incidences of proximal thrombosis and of bilateral thrombi were also less with spinal anaesthesia than with general anaesthesia. It is concluded that spinal anaesthesia reduces the risks of postoperative thromboembolism in hip replacement surgery. The presence of varicose veins, being a non-smoker and having a low body mass index were associated with an increased incidence of deep vein thrombosis.\r"

In 65 patients non-weight-bearing movement was assessed radiographically and compared with an earlier study of the Monk prosthesis. In 70% of patients, the only movement was between the acetabulum and the prosthetic shell, the prosthesis behaving as if it were unipolar. This did not change with time, but there was a slight improvement in the range of movement, particularly in flexion. The absence of movement between the outer shell and the metal head is most probably due to the design of the prosthesis and makes this prosthesis unsuitable for use in osteoarthritic hips.\r"

No hip has as yet required a revision operation, although eight hips (57%) show radiological changes suggestive of impending failure. All patients had severe polyarticular involvement with associated restriction of locomotor activity. Potential causes contributing to loosening such as continuing diaphyseal bone growth and increased immunocompetence in adolescence are discussed.\r"

The currently accepted classification of scoliosis is inaccurate and a modification is proposed. The three main types of scoliosis were shown to have sagittal profiles distinctly different from each other and from normal. Single structural curves had short lordotic sections at their apices, limited above and below by kyphosis. Double curves showed longer lordotic sections limited only by one area of kyphosis. Lordosis throughout the thoracic and lumbar spine was associated with triple curve patterns. The biomechanical effects of the abnormal sagittal profiles provide a simple explanation for the genesis and progression of the different types of scoliosis, and the recognition of the pattern of the sagittal abnormalities permits treatment to be designed on a sound anatomical basis for individual cases.\r"

  ".W": "We compared retrospectively consecutive series of patients with cervical dislocation treated at two Australian centres. In Perth, 82 patients were treated by closed reduction and postural nursing. In Adelaide, 85 patients had closed reduction and early surgical stabilisation by interbody fusion. There were 46 bilateral dislocations, 101 unilateral dislocations, and 20 anterior subluxations. On admission 30 patients had complete tetraplegia, 17 incomplete tetraplegia, and 120 had minimal or no neurological loss. Our results indicated that closed manipulation under general anaesthesia is a safe and effective means of reduction in the acute stage. There was a high mortality rate for acute surgery in patients with complete tetraplegia. Early surgical stabilisation by dowel fusion reduced bed and hospital stay in patients with no neurological loss, but seemed to impair neurological recovery in patients with a neurological deficit on admission. Conservative management after reduction of bilateral dislocation or anterior subluxation led to a higher incidence of instability in patients with minimal or no neurological loss; in such cases surgery to stabilise the injured segment is indicated.\r"

Human bone-derived cells were either co-cultured with myeloma cells, or cultured in medium conditioned by myeloma cells. Bone-derived cell growth was measured by cell counts and by uptake of tritiated thymidine (3H-Tdr); growth was inhibited when cultured in medium conditioned by myeloma cells and some inhibition was seen when the bone-derived cells were co-cultured with myeloma cells. The inhibiting effect was dose-dependent and also dependent upon the density of the myeloma cells conditioning the medium. The results of our study suggest that myeloma secretes an osteoblast inhibiting factor of less than 50,000 Dalton molecular weight.\r"

A repeated scan this time did not disclose new perfusion defects in any patients. In the absence of a baseline study, these scans may be interpreted as demonstrating pulmonary embolism on treatment and lead to unnecessary caval interruption procedures for failed heparin therapy.\r"

Nineteen patients aged two days to three months with TAPVC were studied. The types of TAPVC were supracardiac in 9 patients, cardiac in 4, infracardiac in 4 and mixed in 2. Profound hypothermia induced by surface cooling, limited cardiopulmonary by-pass and total circulatory arrest were used in all cases. The 4 early deaths concerned the first four neonates who were critically ill. All operative survivors are followed for a mean of 3.5 years (12 months to 8 years). There are two late deaths due to reoperation for pulmonary venous obstruction. All 13 survivors are well at last review. Eleven of them have been recatheterized 4 to 33 months after repair (19 months in average). The pulmonary artery and capillary pressures fell to a normal level after a few months. Ventricular function which was markedly depressed preoperatively, was evaluated by quantitative angiocardiography and echocardiography. It returned to normal late postoperatively. The hospital mortality for the repair of TAPVC in the neonates remains appreciable. Total correction at one operation is advisable. The incidence of postoperative pulmonary venous obstruction is of particular concern. The late postoperative functional and hemodynamic results are excellent. The repair of TAPVC can be considered curative.\r"

Five of these patients had undergone previous surgery and thrombosis had developed despite low dose heparin given postoperatively. Three patients had had an unsuccessful thrombectomy prior to spiral implantation. No complications related to the endoluminal prosthesis occurred. There was one retroperitoneal hematoma from guide wire perforation of the inferior vena cava (IVC) necessitating laparotomy and reversal of the previously constructed femoral av-fistula with subsequent iliofemoral rethrombosis. All other endoluminally reconstructed veins remained open at early and late (up to 12 months) review confirmed by phlebography. We conclude that with increasing clinical experience endoluminal relining of obstructed major veins will probably become a valuable method of venous reconstruction with minimal surgical trauma.\r"

  ".W": "Veno-venous bypass without the use of systemic heparinization has recently become of increasing interest for application during liver transplantation and surgery on the large abdominal veins. However, possible adverse effects on blood components as demonstrated by means of hematologic and hemostatic parameters or on the occurrence of thromboembolic complications are until now not excluded. No consensus has been reached as to the efficacy of heparin coated circuits in those procedures. In the present study veno-venous bypass was performed for four hours in ten dogs using heparin coated and non coated circuits without further heparinization in a randomized blind fashion. No changes or significant intergroup differences were noted in the hematological and coagulation parameters. Macroscopic evaluation of the circuits revealed small strands of fibrin on all connector rims and clots in the center part of the pump head and at the cannula tips. The lungs showed two small emboli in large size pulmonary arteries and also two minor emboli in small size arteries. In four animals the emboli were equally divided between the two groups. As expected regarding the size of the clots no influences could be seen on hemodynamic or respiratory parameters. With Scanning Electronic Microscopy a monolayer of activated thrombocytes was observed on the surface of the bypass circuits in the coated as well as in the uncoated group. This study suggests that a veno-venous bypass without systemic heparinization is possible without serious damage to blood cellular elements or impressive activation of the coagulation system.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Procedures for long-term angio access have for many years made up a major component of vascular surgical practice. A totally implantable vascular device for chronic venous access developed in the early '80s compares favorably with other methods of angio access. We implanted 76 of these devices in 73 patients on the oncology service of Fairview General Hospital between May 1984 and May 1986. The infusion ports were in place for a total of 14,509 patient days with a 3.9% rate of catheter related sepsis and 6.5% rate of catheter occlusion. Three occlusions resolved with streptokinase. Pocket infection occurred as a late complication in 3 patients. Emphasis is placed on a modified technique for device implantation. Strict adherence to a simplified percutaneous technique for the silastic catheter placement via the subclavian vein, with creation of the reservoir pocket after adequate vascular access is secure, has led to no serious complications during placement. Routine use of fluoroscopy during this procedure helped avoid potential technical complications. The advantages and disadvantages of the implantable systems compared to the dacron cuffed silastic catheters are discussed. Patient acceptance is excellent and improved cost/benefit ratio has been observed when compared to other forms of chronic venous access. Implantable vascular devices can be safely inserted with little morbidity or risk to the patient. They provide a convenient route for drawing blood, administering chemotherapy, hyperalimentation, and intravenous therapy in oncology patients and may represent an advantage over Hickman-Broviac catheters and the attendant catheter related sepsis associated with their use.\r"
