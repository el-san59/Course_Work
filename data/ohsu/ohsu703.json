  ".W": "Before treatment of 181 patients with bone marrow transplantation (BMT) for leukemia, severe aplastic anemia, or metabolic disorders, the oral condition was examined clinically and roentgenologically. Fifty-three patients (29%) had chronic dental infections (osteitis) that needed treatment before BMT. In 10 of 181 cases (6%), BMT was postponed because of oral infections. Septicemia during the neutropenic phase was caused by oral microorganisms (alpha streptococci) in 24 of 59 (41%) patients with microbiologically proven septicemia. Septicemia with alpha streptococci was associated with graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis with methotrexate and subsequent increased frequency of oral ulcerations. No difference was observed in the frequency of reactivation of latent herpes simplex virus infection between different graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis regimens. Reactivation was more frequent in patients conditioned with total body irradiation than in patients conditioned without total body irradiation. Antiviral prophylaxis, with subsequent decreased frequency of oral herpes simplex reactivation, appeared to contribute to a low frequency of septicemia with alpha streptococci.\r"

Significant dental findings were severe enamel hypoplasia, conical and misshapen teeth, hypodontia, and impactions. Craniofacial disorders were underdevelopment of the maxilla, mandible, and anterior and posterior cranial bases, low-set ears, and a wide nasal bridge. Reported for the first time is the association of this genetic disorder with bilateral microcondyles and bilateral choanal atresia. Embryologic disturbance of the neural crest ectoderm is suspected. The patient also manifested anal atresia, scoliosis, kyphosis, and short stature. A discussion distinguishing this case report from the Rieger syndrome is presented. In addition, the possibility that the patient exhibited a previously unreported syndrome is also considered, and the term Short-F-R-A-M-E is proposed to name this new syndrome.\r"

Oral fibromatosis was observed in 56% of patients with typical TS and in none of 9 \"atypical\" cases. The total prevalence was 46%. Similar lesions were not seen in the control series, and they were rare in the otherwise apparently normal relatives with TS. However, three parents of patients with TS were found to have oral fibromas even though they had no signs of TS. It is suggested that examination for oral fibromatosis should be made in all persons suspected of having TS and in their close relatives, since such examination may identify other unsuspected carriers of the gene within the family.\r"

  ".W": "Two cases of the so-called fibro-osteo-cemental lesions of the jaws, containing unusual deposits of hard tissue, are described. There were peculiar spheroid calcifications or larger masses forming small cavities with a radial arrangement and discontinuous blasts extending with axonlike cell processes toward an acellular core. For further definition, electron microscopic and immunohistologic studies were done. The most conspicuous features were abundant intracytoplasmic vimentin filaments in the blasts, tight junctions, matrix vesicle formation, a globular accretion pattern, and so-called matrix maturation. These findings militate against an osseous or cementous nature of this hard tissue. Rather, both the light and electron microscopic findings are highly compatible with the assumption that the blasts are odontoblasts and that an immature type of dentin is formed. In addition to fibroblasts, osteoblasts, and cementoblasts, apparently also a further descendant of the ectomesenchyme--the odontoblasts with dentin formation--may participate in the so-called fibro-osteo-cemental lesions.\r"

Confusion exists about the relationship of gigantiform cementoma to florid osseous dysplasia, cementifying fibroma, and diffuse chronic sclerosing osteomyelitis. It has been unclear whether gigantiform cementoma should be accorded the status of a separate entity. In this article, we report our findings on a family that, over five generations, has exhibited clinical, radiographic, and/or histologic findings consistent with the designation familial gigantiform cementoma. This pedigree consists of 55 members. Significant heterogeneity in expression of this trait was noted. The pattern of occurrence of the trait is consistent with an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance with variable expressivity of the phenotype. We suggest that familial gigantiform cementoma should be recognized as a separate entity.\r"

Two sources of ultrasonic oscillation were used: a Cavitron 2001 ultrasonic unit with a file in a PR-30 insert and an ENAC ultrasonic unit with a plugger or file. Temperature elevation in the apical third of the tooth was minimal with either instrument (1.66 degrees C to 3.74 degrees C). The temperature rise in the middle third was higher with the ENAC unit, although probably still within clinically acceptable limits (range, 6.35 degrees C to 19.10 degrees C). The time taken for each unit to thermoplasticize the gutta-percha and reach a predetermined distance in the experimental model was recorded and defined as instrument efficiency. The Cavitron unit that had the PR-30 insert with a No. 25 file required 0.48 sec/mm, whereas the ENAC unit with a No. 25 file required 10.83 sec/mm and the ENAC unit with a plugger required 8.38 sec/mm. It appears that the Cavitron unit with a PR-30 insert was more than 22 times as efficient as the ENAC unit for thermoplasticizing gutta-percha under the experimental conditions used in this study.\r"

Four milligrams of each root canal sealer was placed in each of three wells in 10 plates (five plates of each inoculant); the fourth well was left empty as a control site. Plates were incubated at 37 degrees C and checked after 2, 7, and 14 days. All root canal sealers inhibited growth of both organisms. The inhibitory zones for S. sanguis were larger than inhibitory zones for S. mutans for all tested sealers, except Diaket. Dentinol, Kerr, and Tubliseal had significantly more inhibitory effect on S. sanguis than did other tested sealers (p less than 0.05). Diaket had superior inhibition on S. mutans.\r"

In the periapical and panoramic radiographs, it is seen that the overfilled canal filling material extended as far as the angulus region of the mandible. It is also observed that the canalis mandibularis was not affected by this process and that the overfilled canal paste extended through the trabeculae of the mandibular bone. The fact that the paste disappeared after a short period of time supports the view that the canal filling material was the iodoform paste, which was resorbed.\r"

The base plus fog, film saturation, speed, gamma, average gradient, and resolution were determined. When dental receptors and screen-film systems are compared on the basis of radiographic quality (contrast and resolution), many screen-film systems have similar resolution (greater than 10 line pairs/mm), significantly greater contrast (greater than 2.0), and a substantial speed advantage (greater than 10). Thus selected screen-film systems may be an alternative to conventional dental receptors for intraoral radiography.\r"

All had at least 2 of 3 possible components to their PHN pain: continuous, neuralgic, or allodynic. In patients with allodynia, maximal reported pain and the location of maximal allodynia on sensory examination were largely overlapping and were often warm thermographically. Areas of dense sensory loss and skin scarring without allodynia were usually cool thermographically. Local anesthetic skin infiltration produced substantial pain relief in all 9 patients (essentially complete relief in 7) with allodynia: the 3 patients with predominantly continuous pain were not relieved. In 7 of 8 skin infiltration responders, the same dose of lidocaine i.m. in the deltoid muscle also produced significant, though less complete pain relief. These results suggest that PHN patients can be divided into at least 2 clinical groups: those with predominantly continuous pain localized to a region of significant sensory loss and those in whom allodynia is the most prominent sensory disturbance. The latter group has pain localized to areas with relatively preserved sensation. The differences in clinical features and response to lidocaine suggest that there are at least 2 different mechanisms contributing to the pain of PHN.\r"

Flexion reflex RIII was depressed or suppressed by AN in 11 patients (52.4%), while no modification was observed in 9 cases and a paradoxical increase during AN was evidenced in 1 case. In all but 2 patients, RIII changes were rapidly reversible after AN interruption. RIII depression was significantly associated with subjective pain relief, as assessed by conventional self-rating; moreover, in 2 patients it was possible to ameliorate the pain-suppressing effects of AN by selecting those stimulation parameters (intensity and frequency) that maximally depressed nociceptive reflex RIII. We recorded 2 cases of RIII attenuation after contralateral neurostimulation. AN appeared to affect nociceptive reflexes rather selectively, with no or very little effect on other cutaneous, non-nociceptive responses. Recording of RIII reflexes is relatively simple to implement as a routine paraclinical procedure. It facilitates the objective assessment of AN efficacy and may help to choose the most appropriate parameters of neurostimulation. In addition, RIII behavior in patients could be relevant to the understanding of some of the mechanisms involved in AN-induced pain relief.\r"

  ".W": "Four studies are presented testing the validity and reliability of pressure pain thresholds (PPTs) and of examination parameters believed to be important in the clinical assessment of sites commonly used for such measures in patient samples. Forty-five patients with a myogenous temporomandibular disorder were examined clinically prior to PPT measures. Criteria for history and examination included functional aspects of the pain, tissue quality of the pain site, and the type of pain elicited from palpation. Control sites within the same muscle and in the contralateral muscle were also examined. PPTs were measured as an index of tenderness using a strain gauge algometer at these sites. The data from the 5 male subjects were excluded from subsequent analyses due to the higher PPT in the males and to their unequal distribution among the various factorial conditions. The first study demonstrated strong validity in PPT measures between patients (using pain sites replicating the patients' pain) and matched controls (n = 11). The PPT was not significantly different between the primary pain site (referred pain and non-referred pain collapsed) and the no-pain control site in the same muscle (n = 16). The PPT was significantly lower at the pain site compared to the no-pain control site in the contralateral muscle (n = 13). The second study indicated adequate reliability in patient samples of the PPT measures. In the third study, the PPT was significantly lower at sites producing referred pain on palpation compared to sites producing localized pain on palpation. The PPT findings from the control sites were inconsistent on this factor. The fourth study presented preliminary evidence that palpable bands and nodular areas in muscle were most commonly associated with muscle regions that produce pain; such muscle findings were not specific, however, for regions that produce pain. Further, the intraexaminer reliability in reassessing these pain sites qualitatively was only fair. Referred pain had a poor association with the pain pattern and physical findings, which may suggest a need to reevaluate part of the theory regarding referred muscle pain. The reliability of PPT measures was better overall than the reliability of the signs and site-specific symptoms, suggesting that pressure pain thresholds may be an important tool in clinical studies of pain. PPT measures demonstrate a high within-subject variability in pain patient subjects as well as non-pain subjects.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

The patients were studied prior to, during and immediately after 4 identical periods of exercise (bicycle ergometer) each performed 30 min after injection with saline, repeated saline, an opioid and naloxone. All substances were given epidurally, except for naloxone which was given intravenously. Finally, with the patients resting in bed, lignocaine was injected epidurally. Physiological variables, general exertion, dyspnoea, lower extremity exhaustion, pain and tender points in the lower half of the body were examined. Resting pain and tender points diminished significantly after the opioid injection. Lignocaine completely abolished resting pain and tender points. Lower extremity exhaustion was reduced by the opioid. General exertion and dyspnoea were unaffected by the opioid. In conclusion the results support the hypothesis that the pain in fibromyalgia is of peripheral nociceptive or spinal origin. We raise the hypothesis that the fatigability is, at least partly, due to inhibition because of pain.\r"

A 'tolerance index' was calculated for each patient by multiplying the duration of previous morphine therapy with the daily dose just prior to the study and then compared with changes in the following variables measured after epidural morphine administration: with pain scores on a scale from 0 (no pain) to 10 (maximal pain), heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate and minute volume, arterial blood gas tensions of oxygen and carbon dioxide and arterial pH. There was no significant analgesic cross-tolerance to epidural morphine, but clear evidence for cross-tolerance regarding morphine's respiratory depressant action. The duration of the previous morphine therapy exerted a greater influence on the development of ventilatory cross-tolerance than the dose.\r"

In a study of 54 women admitted to a day-care unit for this procedure, validated measures were utilized to assess the incidence, intensity and duration of pain after tubal ligation (McGill Pain Questionnaire) and the impact of pain on the activities of daily living (Modified Functional Assessment Inventory). Psychological measures (Brief Symptom Inventory, Kranz Health Opinion Survey, and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory) were employed to test their use as possible predictors for pain, analgesic usage and the time taken to resume a normal activity level after tubal ligation surgery. The results showed that pain is a significant problem after tubal ligation although pain rating scores over the 7-day study period were lower than those reported after major abdominal surgery. Eighty-five percent of our sample reported that pain and/or fatigue impacted on their recovery and contributed to an average delay of return to normal activity level of 4.4 days, not including the day of surgery. The psychological measures did not prove to be strong predictors of postoperative pain, time of return to normal activity level or analgesic usage. The most powerful predictor of return to normal activity was the total amount of pain experienced, as measured by the McGill Pain Questionnaire, during the 7 day post-operative period.\r"

After many years of unsuccessful conservative treatment (mean = 12.4 years), the patients were treated surgically with good results. The radiological or electrophysiological examinations were non-specific or negative. Only vasoactive tests (provoking or relieving pain) or local anesthesia proved helpful in diagnosing and localizing the origin of pain. Intraoperatively, hemicranial attacks were found to be caused by vascular irritation or compression of the cervical nerve root C2. After decompression (n = 6) or dissection (n = 10) of the nerve root and the ganglion, 12 patients were relieved of their pain, 2 had improved relatively, 1 showed only a slight improvement, and in 1 patient no cause was found and no improvement was achieved. Two patients suffered recurrence of pain postoperatively; one had no further complaints after root extirpation following percutaneous thermorhizotomy. Electron microscopic examination of the nerve root and its ganglion revealed focal morphological changes, including proliferation of connective tissue in the endoneurium and the ganglion itself, the formation of onion-bulb-like structures around single axons, discrete signs of myelin damage and axonal degeneration. These morphological changes are possibly the result of a chronic vascular compression.\r"

A cannula was stereotaxically implanted into the anterior cingulum on one side in anesthetized rats. Seven to 10 days after surgery, the rats were infused with 1 microliter of 2% lidocaine in saline or saline alone into the anterior cingulum bundle immediately prior to testing for analgesia in the formalin or foot-flick test. Injection of lidocaine into the anterior cingulum bundle produced a significant reduction in formalin pain scores, but had no effect on foot-flick latencies. The analgesia in the formalin test persisted for the entire 40 min observation period. No analgesia in the formalin test was observed in rats that received injections of saline into the cingulum, lidocaine into the cingulum 90 min prior to testing or lidocaine into the cingulate cortex. These data suggest that the cingulum is involved in the perception of tonic pain but not phasic pain, and support previous studies which indicate that different neural mechanisms underlie different types of pain. Furthermore, these findings suggest that the cingulum is involved in the affective component of pain and that interruption of cingulum activity with lidocaine can produce analgesia.\r"

TENS significantly elevated ice pain threshold when compared with sham and control groups. TENS frequencies between 20 and 80 Hz produced greatest analgesia, while frequencies below and above this level (10 Hz and 160 Hz), although significantly elevating ice pain threshold, produced effects of a lesser magnitude. The frequency of pulse delivery was the governing factor as no significant differences in stimulus intensity were observed across the treatment groups. Measurement of ice pain tolerance was found to be unreliable under the present conditions. No significant relationships were observed between personality variables as measured by Eysenck Personality Questionnaires and the degree of TENS response.\r"

The conduction block was assessed by the reduction in the C-wave of the compound action potential. Capsaicin caused a dose-dependent decrease in the height and area under the C-wave; the threshold dose was between 0.01 and 0.3 microM and maximum C-wave reduction of about 85% occurred with doses of 5 microM or above. The C-wave reduction was divided into reversible and irreversible components which differed in dose dependency. The threshold for the reversible block was below 0.3 microM and for the irreversible block it was about 1 microM. The onset of the block took about 5 min. regardless of dose. Where there was more than 50% recovery after the block the reversible component was measured. This was dose dependent and its duration was 10-90 min. Removal of external calcium did not affect the magnitude of the C-wave block, although it did seem to prevent recovery of the C-wave.\r"

Most cases of Plasmodium vivax (80%) were acquired on the Indian subcontinent, including 2 cases of congenital malaria. Six children developed P. falciparum malaria despite chemoprophylaxis. All children had a history of fever, usually with other influenza-like symptoms. Two-thirds had splenomegaly, and one-third were afebrile on admission. Thrombocytopenia (70%) and anemia (70%) were often present. Forty-five percent received previous wrong diagnoses and treatments. Quinine or quinidine with either Fansidar or clindamycin were used to treat P. falciparum malaria. Clindamycin may be more effective if given for 7 instead of 3 days. There were no deaths or residual complications. As the prevalence and severity of drug-resistant P. falciparum spreads, prophylaxis and treatment choices become more difficult. Diagnosis requires a travel history and a high index of suspicion.\r"

Only one case had occurred in the previous 8 years. Fourteen of 15 episodes of streptococcal sepsis occurred after therapy with either continuous or large dosage intermittent cytosine arabinoside. Eleven episodes occurred at two specific treatment points. Septic episodes were complicated by shock (2 of 15), encephalopathy (2 of 15), pneumonia (3 of 15) and death (1 of 15). Oral mucosal lesions may provide a portal of entry for alpha-hemolytic streptococci. These data suggest that children receiving continuous or large dosage intermittent cytosine arabinoside for treatment of acute nonlymphocytic leukemia may be at increased risk for alpha-hemolytic streptococcal sepsis. Empiric antimicrobial therapy in these children when febrile and neutropenic should include antibiotics effective against alpha-hemolytic streptococci.\r"

Results were negative in 29 of 33 (87.9%) tuberculin-positive children and in 18 of 20 (90.0%) contacts, none of whom had evidence of tuberculosis. The sensitivity of this test was 0.51 as determined in 49 sera from bacteriologically confirmed cases; 17 of 27 smear positive cases and 8 of 22 children with positive cultures were detected. Results were positive in 32 of 114 (28.1%) patients with a diagnosis of tuberculosis not confirmed by microbiology. Consequently whereas a negative result does not rule out tuberculosis, a positive result is a strong indication of the disease. The IgM antibody determination yielded much less discriminative results.\r"

In the surgical group 311 tympanostomy tube surgeries had been performed and in the medical group 1334 episodes of acute otitis media and/or 186 episodes of otitis media with effusion occurred. Tympanosclerosis was found in 6.5% of the medical group ears and 52.3% of the surgical group ears. Tympanic atrophy occurred in 4.3% of the medical group ears and 40.7% of the surgical group ears. The duration of the presence of the tympanostomy tube significantly influenced the tympanic membrane. The presence of middle ear fluid at the time of tube insertion, particularly high viscosity (\"glue\") fluid, correlated with persisting sclerosis (P less than 0.00001) and reduced tympanic membrane mobility (P less than 0.00001) but not tympanic membrane atrophy (P = 0.94) later. Abnormal hearing, defined as a hearing threshold greater than 20 dB occurred in 9.3 to 18.7% of the surgical ears and in 3.7 to 9.0% of the medical ears depending on the hearing frequency tested. Medical management consisting of recurrent use of therapeutic and/or prophylactic antibiotics was associated with infrequent anatomic and audiologic sequelae. Repeated placement of tympanostomy tubes may be associated with the frequent occurrence of both anatomic and audiologic sequelae.\r"

The performance characteristics of a test are properly compared to those of the patient or parent, operating in the absence of the test. For streptococcal pharyngitis there would be a net increase in the number of cases correctly treated whenever the sensitivity of the home test (multiplied by the probability that the patient will act upon the test results) exceeds the a priori probability that the patient will be seen by a physician in the absence of the test. Use of home screening tests is likely to increase the number of patient-physician contacts among persons with sore throats and will do so proportionately more frequently among those with streptococcal pharyngitis.\r"

Electrospray ionization places an unusually high number of charges on a peptide yielding mass/charge (m/z) values of 600-1500; in this range at normal operating pressures (approximately 10(-9) torr; 1 torr = 133.3 Pa) Fourier-transform mass spectrometry resolving power is greater than 100,000. Although only 10(-7) torr pressure has been obtained with the initial interface, the resulting resolving power of 5000 makes possible the resolution of isotopic peaks of multiply charged ions. Mass measuring accuracies of a few daltons for molecular masses up to 17 kDa have also been achieved.\r"

The models were based on the multiple antigen peptide (MAP) system and contained the relevant B- and T-cell epitopes without any macromolecular carrier. Two peptides, representing the a determinant of the S region (S protein) of hepatitis B surface antigen, a dominant serotype of hepatitis B virus infection found in humans, and residues 12-26 of the pre-S(2) region of the middle protein were incorporated as either monoepitope or diepitope MAP models. Immunizations of outbred rabbits with the monoepitope MAP that contains the pre-S(2) antigen resulted in high-titered antibody response to the middle protein, but the other monoepitope, containing only the a-determinant peptide antigen, resulted in poor immune responses to either the peptide antigens or to the S protein. The diepitope MAPs containing both the a and the pre-S(2) determinants produced high-titer antibodies reactive to the a-synthetic peptide and the S protein, as well as to the middle proteins. Thus, our results show that the diepitope MAP models eliminate the need for a protein carrier and that the pre-S(2) peptide determinant serves as a T-helper cell epitope that enhances the immune response of the S region and overcomes the poor immunogenicity encountered with a single epitope of the S region.\r"

These encode a 911-amino acid protein (Mr 101,791) and detect a single 4.7-kilobase species in human reticulocyte RNA. The corresponding gene is located on chromosome 17. The protein is similar in structure to other anion exchangers and is divided into three regions: a hydrophilic, cytoplasmic domain that interacts with a variety of membrane and cytoplasmic proteins (residues 1-403); a hydrophobic, transmembrane domain that forms the anion antiporter (residues 404-882); and an acidic, C-terminal domain of unknown function (residues 883-911). The N-terminal domain contains several conserved sections (e.g., residues 57-86, 102-164, 219-347, and 375-403), some of which may contribute to binding sites for ankyrin, protein 4.1, or protein 4.2. The membrane domain is highly conserved with the exception of a single segment (residues 543-567) that contains several sites for cleavage of the protein by extracellular proteases. Based on hydropathy analyses and the wealth of available topographical and functional data, a model is proposed in which the protein crosses the membrane 14 times.\r"

  ".U": "90083215\r", 
  ".W": "The retinoic acid (RA)-associated differentiation of murine F9 teratocarcinoma stem cells results in dramatic changes in gene expression. The cellular gene encoding the B1 subunit of the extracellular matrix protein laminin is transcriptionally activated by RA, and its transcription is further enhanced by N6,O2'-dibutyryladenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (Bt2cAMP) during the differentiation of F9 stem cells into extraembryonic parietal endoderm cells. We now report that expression vectors encoding the human RA receptors RAR-alpha, RAR-beta, and RAR-gamma can activate chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) expression from laminin B1 promoter/CAT expression vectors (e.g., p1.6LAMCAT) in RA-treated F9 cells, as measured in a transient transfection assay. Bt2cAMP does not further enhance the RA-associated increase in CAT activity. Through the use of deletion and mutation analyses, the RA-responsive element (RARE) of the murine laminin B1 gene has been defined as a 46-base-pair element between -477 and -432 of the laminin B1 5' flanking region. Insertion of a region of DNA containing this RARE in either orientation into a thymidine kinase promoter/CAT expression vector causes CAT expression to be activated 5- to 9-fold by the cotransfected human RAR-alpha or RAR-beta constructs in RA-treated F9 cells, and this RARE also functions in human HeLa cells. In contrast, this RARE in the p1.6LAMCAT vector does not activate CAT expression when cotransfected into F9 stem cells with the c-erbA gene in the presence of thyroid hormone. This suggests that the laminin B1 gene is activated by RA but not by thyroid hormone in vivo.\r"

  ".U": "90083218\r", 
  ".W": "Thyroid-stimulating hormone alpha and beta subunit genes are negatively regulated by thyroid hormone at the transcriptional level. Transient gene expression studies were used to demonstrate that the erbA beta form of the thyroid hormone receptor mediates negative regulation of the alpha-subunit promoter in a hormone-dependent manner. In JEG-3 choriocarcinoma cells, which are deficient in thyroid hormone receptors, coexpression of erbA beta with alpha CAT reporter genes markedly suppressed alpha CAT expression after treatment with thyroid hormone, whereas a reporter gene containing a known positive thyroid response element was induced. Thus, a single form of thyroid hormone receptor mediates both positive and negative responses to thyroid hormone in this system. Transient expression analyses of alpha gene 5' flanking sequence deletion mutants localized the negative thyroid response element to the proximal region of the promoter between -100 and +4 base pairs. The location of the negative thyroid response element in the alpha gene is therefore distinct from that of previously identified regulatory elements including the tissue-specific upstream regulatory elements, the cAMP response elements, and the glucocorticoid response elements. Overlapping segments of the alpha promoter were examined for potential thyroid hormone receptor binding sites by using gel shift assays and biotinylated DNA-binding studies. A specific thyroid hormone receptor binding site was identified between -22 and -7 base pairs, which is immediately downstream from the TATA box. This region of the alpha promoter interacts with erbA beta receptor synthesized in vitro as well as with endogenous nuclear thyroid hormone receptors, and it competes for receptor binding to a known positive thyroid response element. These studies suggest a mechanism for negative regulation in which the thyroid hormone receptor interacts with the alpha gene promoter immediately downstream of the TATA box to inhibit transcription.\r"

High-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) of this derivative yielded a sharp peak with a retention time of 7.99 min corresponding to the authentic compound. The enzyme blank and boiled enzyme blank failed to show any significant HPLC peaks corresponding to retinal O-ethyloxime, retinal, or retinol. (ii) The mass spectrum of the O-ethyloxime of the enzymatic product was identical to that of authentic retinal O-ethyloxime (m/z 327: 45%, M+. and m/z 282: 100%, M--ethoxy). (iii) The specific activity of the enzymatically formed [14C]retinal O-ethyloxime remained constant even after repeated crystallization. (iv) The enzymatic product exhibited an absorption maximum at 370 nm in light petroleum characteristic of authentic retinal. Furthermore, it was reduced by horse liver alcohol dehydrogenase to retinol with an absorption maximum at 326 nm in light petroleum. This retinol was enzymatically esterified to retinyl palmitate by rat pancreatic esterase with a retention time of 10 min on HPLC corresponding to authentic retinyl palmitate. Thus, the enzymatic product of beta-carotene cleavage by the partially purified intestinal enzyme was unequivocally confirmed to be retinal.\r"

In vitro transcription-translation analysis of s-myc indicated that this gene produces a protein of approximately 50 kDa. The amino acid sequence predicted from the DNA sequence showed that the s-Myc protein is closely related to the murine N-Myc protein but lacks an acidic amino acid-rich sequence commonly present in the Myc-family proteins.

(i) There are four regions of sharp bending, two which have been seen previously by x-ray crystallography of the core particle.

VAI RNA prevents double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) activation of the interferon-induced protein kinase (DAI kinase). Activation of this kinase results in phosphorylation of the alpha subunit of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (eIF-2 alpha) and correlates with inhibition of translation initiation. In this report we show growth complementation of adenoviruses harboring deletions in the VAI gene in cell lines expressing a serine-to-alanine mutant of eIF-2 alpha. This serine-to-alanine mutant is resistant to phosphorylation by DAI kinase. These results directly show that the primary function of VAI RNA in the lytic adenovirus infection is the inhibition of eIF-2 alpha phosphorylation by DAI kinase and identify eIF-2 alpha as the target that mediates the effects of DAI kinase activation. Cells that express a mutant eIF-2 alpha will enable the isolation of specific host-range mutants for other types of viruses that are defective in the ability to inhibit DAI kinase.\r"

  ".W": "Nineteen structural analogs of 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+) were studied for their capacity to inhibit the mitochondrial oxidation of NAD+-linked substrates and the aerobic oxidation of NADH in inner membrane preparations from cardiac mitochondria. In the majority of cases, a good correlation was found between the two inhibition effects monitored. A few compounds were effective inhibitors of NADH oxidase but had only marginal effects on mitochondrial respiration. From studies of their accumulation by mitochondria, it appears likely that the latter compounds are not effectively concentrated by intact mitochondria by the electrical gradient and, in part for this reason, cannot reach sufficiently high concentrations at the appropriate binding site of NADH dehydrogenase. In addition, evidence is presented that the penetration of pyridinium analogs to the inhibition site in the NADH dehydrogenase complex may also be rate limiting. The data support the thesis that, for a substituted tetrahydropyridine to be acutely neurotoxic, its pyridinium oxidation product must be actively accumulated in the mitochondria and must inhibit NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase in its membrane environment.\r"

DI RNA G, naturally found in the TCV-B isolate, is a mosaic molecule with 5' and 3' viral segments and a repeat of 36 nucleotides at the beginning of the 3' segment. The 5'-terminal 21 nucleotides of DI RNA G were not similar to genomic TCV sequences but did resemble sequences found at the 5' end of other small RNAs associated with TCV (satellite RNAs). DI RNA G interferes with the accumulation of TCV genomic RNA and, unlike other DI RNAs, intensifies the symptoms of its helper virus. Infection of turnip with virus derived from cloned transcripts of TCV-B resulted in de novo generation of a DI RNA, DI1 RNA. DI1 RNA differed from DI RNA G by containing exact 5' and 3' ends of TCV as well as an internal virus segment.\r"

It is based on the simultaneous amplification of two or more DNA segments with fluorescent oligonucleotide primers such that the generation of a color, or combination of colors, can be visualized and used for diagnosis. Color complementation assay obviates the need for gel electrophoresis and has been applied to the detection of a large and small gene deletion, a chromosomal translocation, an infectious agent, and a single-base substitution. DNA amplification with fluorescent oligonucleotide primers has also been used to multiplex and discriminate five different amplified DNA loci simultaneously. Each primer set is conjugated to a different dye, and the fluorescence of each dye respective to its amplified DNA locus is scored on a fluorometer. This method is valuable for DNA diagnostics of genetic, acquired, and infectious diseases, as well as in DNA forensics. It also lends itself to complete automation.\r"

  ".W": "Two types (I and II) of cDNAs encoding the large (A) subunit of calcineurin, a calmodulin-regulated protein phosphatase, were isolated from human basal ganglia and brainstem mRNA. The complete sequences of the two calcineurin clones are identical except for a 54-base-pair insert in the type I clone and different 3' ends including part of the coding sequence for the C termini of the two proteins. These findings suggest that calcineurin A consists of at least two isozymes that may result from alternative splicing events. The two forms of the enzyme differ in the C terminus, which contains an inhibitory domain rapidly severed by limited proteolysis. With the exception of an 18-amino acid insert, the central parts of the molecules, which harbor the catalytic domains, are identical and show extended similarities with the entire catalytic subunits of protein phosphatases 1 and 2A, defining a distinct family of protein phosphatases. The 40-residue N-terminal fragment, specific for calcineurin, contains a sequence of 11 successive prolines that is also found in bovine brain calcineurin by peptide sequencing. A role in the calmodulin activation of calcineurin is proposed for this novel structural element.\r"

Specific binding to a homopurine-homopyrimidine sequence of duplex DNA was demonstrated by spectroscopic studies (absorption and fluorescence) and by \"footprinting\" experiments with a copper phenanthroline chelate used as an artificial nuclease. A hypochromism and a red shift of the acridine absorption were observed. Triple-helix formation was also accompanied by a hypochromism in the ultraviolet range. The fluorescence of the acridine ring was quenched by a stacking interaction with a G.C base pair adjacent to the homopurine-homopyrimidine target sequence. The intercalating agent strongly stabilized the complex formed by the oligopyrimidine with its target duplex sequence. Cytosine methylation further increased the stability of the complexes. Footprinting studies revealed that the oligopyrimidine binds in a parallel orientation with respect to the homopurine-containing strand of the duplex. The intercalated acridine extended by 2 base pairs the region of the duplex protected by the oligopyrimidine against degradation by the nuclease activity of the copper phenanthroline chelate. Random intercalation of the acridine ring was lost due to the repulsive effect of the negatively charged oligonucleotide tail. Intercalation occurred only at those double-stranded sequences where the homopyrimidine oligonucleotide recognized the major groove of duplex DNA.\r"

Based on experiments with the figwort mosaic virus (FMV), it appears that gene VI has a role in the posttranscriptional expression of the closely packed genes (VII and I-V), which appear on the larger, full-length RNA transcript of this virus. Gene VI with its flanking 5'/3' expression signals included as a separate plasmid during electroporation of DNA into protoplasts of Nicotiana edwardsonii shows an unusual type of transactivation of a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene fused at its 5' end to a small open reading frame (gene VII) of the long 5' leader of the full-length RNA transcript of the FMV genome. The level of activity of the CAT gene is increased up to 20-fold over the activity of control plasmids when gene VI is included in the electroporation mixture. Mutagenesis of the coding portions of gene VI of pGS1 RVI, a transactivating plasmid used in the electroporation experiments, demonstrated that it was probably the polypeptide product of gene VI that was responsible for the transactivating effect. Experiments with various portions of the 5' leader of the large, full-length RNA of FMV showed that the coding region of gene VII is necessary for the transactivation event. Clones of cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) or FMV with intact gene VI were found to reciprocally transactivate gene VII-CAT fusions (FMV) or gene I-CAT fusions (CaMV) located downstream of the 5' leader sequences of either viral genome.\r"

By chromatographic analyses of the 3H-methyl amino acid generated by exhaustive proteolysis of purified PDE, followed by performic acid oxidation of the digest, we have shown that this modification occurs at a C-terminal cysteine residue of the alpha subunit of this enzyme. When PDE is subjected to limited proteolysis with trypsin, a 3H-methylated fragment of 1000 daltons or less is rapidly removed prior to the degradation of its inhibitory gamma subunit. This small fragment remains membrane bound, whereas the bulk of the enzyme is released, indicating that a domain responsible for anchoring PDE to the membrane is located near the C terminus. Based on the C-terminal amino acid sequence of Cys-Cys-Val-Gln predicted from the alpha cDNA sequence, we conclude that PDE undergoes posttranslational modifications, including the proteolytic removal of two or three terminal amino acids, and methyl esterification of the alpha-carboxyl group of the terminal cysteine residue. We speculate that the sulfhydryl group of the methylated cysteine is also lipidated to mediate membrane binding. These modifications may play an important role in delivering the nascent PDE chains to the membrane and in correctly positioning the PDE molecule in the rod disks for phototransduction.\r"

In this report we have identified U2AF, purified it to homogeneity, and characterized its biochemical properties. Purified U2AF comprises roughly equimolar quantities of two polypeptides, approximately 65 kDa and approximately 35 kDa, which appear to be associated. Measured by ultraviolet crosslinking, the 65-kDa polypeptide binds specifically to the polypyrimidine tract/3' splice site region. U2AF binds rapidly at 4 degrees C in the absence of ATP and remains associated with the pre-mRNA following U2 snRNP binding. Thus, the simple binding of U2AF initiates mammalian spliceosome assembly by facilitating the ATP-dependent binding of U2 snRNP.\r"

Incorrectly synthesized sequences were separated from the wild type by DGGE as mutant/wild-type heteroduplexes and the heteroduplex fraction was used to calculate the average error rate (mutations per base duplication). The error rate induced in the 104-base-pair low-temperature melting domain of exon 3 of the human hypoxanthine/guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) gene was approximately 3.4 x 10(-5) for modified T7, 1.3 x 10(-4) for Klenow fragment, and 2.1 x 10(-4) for Taq polymerases after a 10(6)-fold amplification. The error rate for T4 DNA polymerase was not more than 3 x 10(-6) error per base duplication. The predominant mutations were sequenced and found to be transitions of G.C to A.T for T4 and modified T7 DNA polymerases, and A.T to G.C for Taq polymerase. Klenow fragment induced both possible transitions and deletions of 2 and 4 base pairs.\r"

We investigate the efficiency of a model pump that uses 6-phosphofructokinase (EC 2.7.1.11, an enzyme that exhibits highly nonlinear kinetics), chromatophores from Rhodobacter sphaeroides, and light to generate a biochemical gradient. We analyze the experimental system and an equivalent alternative configuration and show that the establishment and maintenance of a concentration gradient across a membrane is thermodynamically equivalent to the establishment and maintenance of a stationary state in a single-phase, isothermal, open, homogeneous reaction system. With a constant input of light, the system can exist in a stable node (a stable steady state), a stable focus (upon perturbation from its steady state, the system returns to its steady state with an oscillatory component), and a stable limit cycle (at steady state the system exhibits stable oscillations). We investigate the efficiency of the system with both steady and oscillatory light input and observe efficiency changes that depend upon the autonomous state of the system and the frequency and amplitude of the periodic light input. When the system is in a stable focus, an efficiency maximum is seen when the system is perturbed at its resonant frequency. When the system is in a stable limit cycle, efficiency increases are seen near the 1:3, 1:2, and 2:1 entrainment regions and an efficiency decrease is seen near the 1:1 entrainment region. We further calculate various contributions to the efficiency: the phase shift of the force and flux, the magnitude of the response to the perturbation, and changes in the average values of the force and flux during a perturbation. We show that all three changes contribute to the overall changes in efficiency, but increases and decreases in the average force make the largest contributions.\r"

  ".W": "As polar surfaces in solvent are brought together, they experience a large repulsive interaction, termed the solvation pressure. The solvation pressure between rough surfaces, such as lipid bilayers, has been shown previously to decay exponentially with distance between surfaces. In this paper, we compare measured values of the solvation pressure between bilayers and the dipole potential for monolayers in equilibrium with bilayers. For a variety of polar solvents and lipid phases, we find a correlation between the measured solvation pressures and dipole potentials. Analysis of the data indicates that the magnitude of the solvation pressure is proportional to the square of the dipole potential. Our experiments also show that the oriented dipoles in the lipid head-group region, including those of both the lipid and solvent molecules, contribute to the dipole potential. We argue that (i) the field produced by these interfacial dipoles polarizes the interbilayer solvent molecules giving rise to the solvation pressure and (ii) both the solvation pressure and the dipole potential decay exponentially with distance from the bilayer surface, with a decay constant that depends on the packing density of the interbilayer solvent molecules (1-2 A in water). These results may have importance in cell adhesion, adsorption of proteins to membranes, characteristics of channel permeability, and the interpretation of electrokinetic experiments.\r"

Here we present a combined algorithm requiring no arbitrary decisions on the part of the user, which has been successfully applied to the modeling of the individual loops in two systems: the anti-lysozyme antibody HyHel-5, the crystal structure of which is as a complex with lysozyme [Sheriff, S., Silverton, E.

The analysis presented here shows that, in the absence of significant local variation of DNA secondary structure, DNase I cleavage is strongly correlated with local variation in the bending flexibility as calculated from our elastic strain model and that the agreement is also quantitatively significant. It is proposed that analysis using elastic strain models will provide a preliminary set of biochemical and chemical tools to explore the relation between DNA flexibility and the binding of other proteins.\r"

No significant homology to other known proteins was detected. The mRNA of the par gene is approximately 900 bases long and its accumulation was detected in cultured mesophyll protoplasts as early as 30 min after the addition of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid to the culture medium. The par mRNA was not detected in leaves or freshly prepared protoplasts or in protoplasts in the absence of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid. Expression of the par gene was detected at a low level in actively dividing BY-2 tobacco suspension culture cells. The conspicuous accumulation of par mRNA before the initiation of DNA synthesis in tobacco mesophyll protoplasts suggests that the par gene product could play a role in the initiation of meristematic activity in differentiated mesophyll cells.\r"

The distribution of beta-glucuronidase activity in these transgenic plants is very similar to that of endogenous PAL2 transcripts in bean, with very high levels in petals; marked accumulation in anthers, stigmas, roots, and shoots; and low levels in sepals, ovaries, and leaves. Histochemical analysis of the spatial pattern of beta-glucuronidase activity showed that the PAL2 promoter is highly active in the shoot apical meristem, the zone of cell proliferation immediately adjacent to the root apical meristem, and in the early stages of vascular development at the inception of xylem differentiation. Wounding and light evoke specific changes in the spatial pattern of beta-glucuronidase activity in stems, including induction in the epidermis. These data indicate that the PAL2 promoter transduces a complex set of developmental and environmental cues into an integrated spatial and temporal program of gene expression to regulate the synthesis of a diverse array of phenylpropanoid natural products.\r"

The cDNAs code for 160 uninterrupted Gly-Xaa-Yaa triplets and a 252-amino acid carboxyl propeptide. Analysis of the deduced amino acid sequences indicated that the sea urchin polypeptide exhibits structural features that are characteristic of the fibril-forming class of collagen molecules. Partial characterization of two genomic recombinants revealed that the 3' end of the echinoid gene displays a complex organization that closely resembles that of a prototypical vertebrate fibrillar collagen gene. In situ and Northern (RNA) blot hybridizations established the size, time of appearance, and tissue distribution of the collagen transcripts in the developing sea urchin embryo. Collagen mRNA, approximately equal to 6 kilobases in size, is first detected in the forming primary mesenchyme cells of late blastulae where it progressively accumulates until the free swimming/feeding pluteus larval stage. Interestingly, collagen transcripts are also detected in the forming secondary mesenchyme cells of late gastrulae, and by the prism stage, their derivatives appear to be the most intensively labeled cells.\r"

  ".W": "The high affinity of 45Ca binding to the low density lipoprotein receptor (LDL-R) and the LDL-R-related protein (LRP) was utilized to study the subcellular distribution of these two proteins in rat liver. Like the LDL-R, LRP was manyfold enriched in rat liver endosomal membranes with a relative distribution in early and late endosomal compartments consistent with recycling between endosomes and the cell surface. The high concentration of LRP in hepatic endosomal membranes greatly facilitated demonstration of Ca-dependent binding of apolipoprotein E- and B-containing lipoproteins in ligand blots. LRP was severalfold more abundant than the LDL-R in hepatic parenchymal cells, showed extensive degradation in hepatic endosomes, and was found in high concentrations in the Golgi apparatus and endoplasmic reticulum. These data suggest a high rate of synthesis of LRP that appeared to be unaffected by treatment of rats with estradiol. The repeating cysteine-rich A-motif found in the ligand-binding domain of LRP appeared to be responsible for Ca binding by LRP, LDL-R, and complement factor C9 and accounted for immunological cross-reactivity among these proteins. Weaker ligand-blotting properties and an extraordinary susceptibility to proteolysis most likely contribute to the difficulty of detecting LRP in conventional assays for lipoprotein receptors. Our data suggest an extensive proteolytic processing of this protein and are consistent with a functional role of LRP in lipoprotein metabolism.\r"

  ".U": "90083261\r", 
  ".W": "The nuclear envelope (NE) separates the two major compartments of eukaryotic cells, the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Recent studies suggest that the uptake of nuclear proteins into the nucleus is initiated by binding of nuclear location signals (NLSs) contained within these proteins to receptors in the NE, followed by translocation through the nuclear pore complex. To examine the binding step without interference from intranuclear events, we have used a system consisting of (i) purified rat liver NEs fixed onto glass slides and (ii) the prototype simian virus 40 large T antigen (SV40 T) NLS conjugated to nonnuclear carrier proteins, and we have visualized the receptor-ligand interaction by indirect immunofluorescence. In this system, incubation of isolated NEs with the wild-type SV40 T NLS conjugate with carrier proteins resulted in binding that was signal sequence-dependent, could be competitively blocked with excess conjugated and unconjugated wild-type peptide, did not require ATP, and was not affected by the transport-inhibiting lectin wheat germ agglutinin. In contrast, only minimal binding was observed with a mutant SV40 T NLS conjugate. These results are consistent with those obtained in other, more complex in vitro systems and suggest that binding of the SV40 T NLS is receptor-mediated. Binding is largely abolished by extraction of the NE with the nonionic detergent Triton X-100, suggesting that the receptor is soluble in detergent. We find in the Triton X-100 supernatant four major NLS-binding proteins with apparent molecular masses of 76, 67, 59, and 58 kDa by photoaffinity labeling with a highly specific crosslinker, azido-NLS. The reduced complexity of the system described here should be useful for the functional study of other potential NLSs for the identification and isolation of their binding sites and for the screening of antibodies raised against these binding sites.\r"

The use of selected cAMP analogs indicated that the exogenous cAMP functioned by activating the cell surface cAMP receptor and not by interacting with the regulatory subunit of the intracellular cAMP-dependent protein kinase. Although some genes in Dictyostelium appear to be regulated by intracellular cAMP, these data suggest that this is not the case for all genes regulated by cAMP. Intracellular second messengers other than cAMP may, therefore, promote the expression of these other genes. Here, we have examined inositol trisphosphate and diacylglycerol as candidates for such mediators of signal transduction. We have studied three genes that exhibit disparate modes of temporal and spatial expression during development of Dictyostelium. In shaking cultures, maximal levels of expression of each are dependent on the accumulation of or exposure to extracellular cAMP. We show that the addition of inositol trisphosphate and/or diacylglycerol to cells in shaking culture has distinct effects on the expression of each gene and, under specific conditions, can bypass the requirement for extracellular cAMP. These data suggest that extracellular cAMP interacting with its cell surface receptor may promote synthesis of inositol trisphosphate and diacylglycerol to regulate gene expression and aspects of differentiation in Dictyostelium.\r"

This method has been applied to study mtDNA sequence variation among 15 members of the !Kung population. A genealogical tree relating these aboriginal, Khoisan-speaking southern Africans to 68 other humans and to one chimpanzee has the deepest branches occurring amongst the !Kung, a result consistent with an African origin of human mtDNA. Fifteen cases of unrelated individuals having identical sequences in the most variable parts of the mtDNA control region were found within populations of !Kung, Western Pygmies, and Eastern Pygmies, but no cases of identity were evident among these populations. This and other evidence of geographic structuring of the mitochondrial diversity in Africa, together with knowledge of the rate of accumulation of base changes in human mtDNA, implies that the average rate at which female lineages have moved their home bases during hunter-gatherer times could be as low as 13 meters per year. The technique of enzymatic amplification and direct sequencing applied to readily collected, highly stable biological materials such as hairs makes it possible to examine with high resolution many representatives of virtually any population.\r"

  ".W": "At the extremes of its natural distribution, populations of the common killifish Fundulus heteroclitus experience a difference of more than 15 degrees C in mean annual temperature. These populations are virtually fixed for two different codominant alleles at the heart-type lactate dehydrogenase locus (Ldh-B) which code for allozymes with different and adaptive kinetic responses to temperature. Two populations near the extremes of the species range (i.e., Maine and Georgia) were further studied for thermal adaptation at this locus. In the absence of any kinetic differences one would predict that to maintain a constant reaction velocity, 2 to 3 times as much enzyme would be required for each 10 degrees C decrease in environmental temperature. Consistent with this adaptive strategy and in addition to the adaptive kinetic characteristics, the LDH-B4 enzyme (EC 1.1.1.27) concentration and its mRNA concentration were approximately twice as great in the northern population as in the southern population. Acclimation experiments allow us to conclude that these differences are due to a combination of fixed genetic traits (evolutionary adaptation) and plastic responses to temperature (physiological acclimation). Furthermore, our calculations show that the LDH-B4 reaction velocities are essentially equivalent for these two populations, even though they live in significantly different thermal environments.\r"

Examination of three independently derived late-appearing trypanosome clones expressing VSG-78 revealed that the expressed gene in all cases is composed of sequences derived from three or four individual silent genes. The 182 base pairs at the 3' end of the coding sequence are derived from one silent gene, the 3' donor. The remaining 5' segment is a mosaic structure containing variable-length segments derived from two, or perhaps three, related silent genes. All of the silent genes that participate in the construction of the VSG-78 expression-linked copy (ELC) genes contain multiple stop codons and are unable to code for VSGs. Individual silent pseudogenes complement one another in the mosaic structure of the 5' portions of the ELC genes and create functional VSG genes. The joining of the 3' and 5' portions of the composite genes occurs in short regions of homology and suggests a mechanism by which the ordered expression of the VSG genes is generated.\r"

Such variation was detected in all of the alpha satellite arrays examined (chromosomes 1, 3, 7, 10, 11, 16, 17, X, and Y) and thus appears to be a general feature of human centromeric DNA. The length of individual centromeric arrays was found to range from an average of approximately 680 kilobases (kb) for the Y chromosome to approximately 3000 kb for chromosome 11. Furthermore, individual arrays appear to be meiotically stable, since no changes in fragment lengths were observed. In total, we analyzed 84 meiotic events involving approximately 191,000 kb of alpha satellite DNA from six autosomal centromeres without any evidence for recombination within an array. High-frequency array length variation and the potential to detect meiotic recombination within them allow direct comparisons of genetic and physical distances in the region of the centromeres of human chromosomes. The generation of primary consensus physical maps of alpha satellite arrays is a first step in the characterization of the centromeric DNA of human chromosomes.\r"

In the present studies we aimed to ascertain whether perception of X chromosomal and Y chromosomal odor types, like the perception of MHC odor types, exerts a spontaneous influence on reproduction. By making use of reciprocal F1 hybrid males and males of the congenic B6.YAKR strain, males differing solely in their X chromosomes, their Y chromosomes, or both were tested in the conventional pregnancy-block system in which isolated females in early pregnancy are known to be subject to a heightened incidence of failed pregnancy when confronted with the scent of a male whose MHC type differs from that of the missing stud male. As previously established for MHC disparity, perception of X chromosomal disparity or of Y chromosomal disparity between stud and secondary males caused a highly significant rise in the incidence of terminated pregnancy. Thus perception of differential odor types other than those specified by the MHC may also be concerned in aspects of selective reproduction.\r"

  ".W": "A cloned gene can be of interest because of its expression in a particular tissue or at a certain developmental stage, or because of homology to an interesting gene from another organism. In Drosophila its location in the genome is readily determined by in situ hybridization to the banded larval salivary gland polytene chromosomes, but it is more difficult to isolate mutations that may reveal its function. This paper describes a general method for detecting transposable element insertions into the gene in question. This \"reverse genetics\" then offers the possibility of observing a consequent mutant phenotype, providing a key to the normal function of the gene. The sensitivity of the polymerase chain reaction makes it possible to detect the occurrence of a single appropriate P-element transposon insertion among a population of mutagenized flies. This is accomplished by the use of oligonucleotide primers--one a sequence from within the cloned gene and the other homologous to the terminal sequence of the P-element DNA--to prime synthesis into the DNA flanking an insertion site. A segment of DNA, bounded by the two primers, will be a target for amplification only in a fly in which a P-element has inserted within about 2 kilobases of the gene primer. This technique has been used to detect P-element insertions near a gene expressed in the Drosophila compound eye. Potential problems with the technique and possible refinements in the screen are discussed. In principle, it could be utilized to detect insertion of a foreign element into any gene for which at least a partial sequence is known and could be extended to other organisms.\r"

The method is applied to data from 12 relatively unacculturated Amerindian tribes for whom census data and independent estimates of the number of different electrophoretic variants at 27 loci are available. Because of tribal demographic structure, Ne should be less than the current number of reproductive-aged adults. In fact, it is substantially greater for 7 tribes, most likely due to intertribal migration and a recent decrease in tribal size. Estimates of locus mutation rates for the 27 loci vary by more than a factor of 20, with an average of 1.1 x 10(-5) per locus per generation. This latter estimate is in satisfactory agreement with the results of other indirect approaches to the estimation of mutation rates in these tribes but about two times higher than the results of direct estimates based on these same loci in studies on civilized populations. This discrepancy could be due to the above-hypothesized migration and to decreases in tribal size.\r"

  ".W": "Urate oxidase, or uricase (EC 1.7.3.3), is a peroxisomal enzyme that catalyzes the oxidation of uric acid to allantoin in most mammals. In humans and certain other primates, however, the enzyme has been lost by some unknown mechanism. To identify the molecular basis for this loss, urate oxidase cDNA clones were isolated from pig, mouse, and baboon, and their DNA sequences were determined. The mouse urate oxidase open reading frame encodes a 303-amino acid polypeptide, while the pig and baboon urate oxidase cDNAs encode a 304-amino acid polypeptide due to a single codon deletion/insertion event. The authenticity of this single additional codon was confirmed by sequencing the mouse and pig genomic copies of the gene. The urate oxidase sequence contains a domain similar to the type 2 copper binding motif found in other copper binding proteins, suggesting that the copper ion in urate oxidase is coordinated as a type 2 structure. Based upon a comparison of the NH2-terminal peptide and deduced sequences, we propose that the maturation of pig urate oxidase involves the posttranslational cleavage of a six-amino acid peptide. Two nonsense mutations were found in the human urate oxidase gene, which confirms, at the molecular level, that the urate oxidase gene in humans is nonfunctional. The sequence comparisons favor the hypothesis that the loss of urate oxidase in humans is due to a sudden mutational event rather than a progressive mutational process.\r"

This change results in substitution of a histidine (CAC) for a glutamine (CAG) at position 48 of the TCR beta chain, a position predicted to be in the TCR antigen binding site. The V beta 1 polymorphism was found by DNA sequence analysis of V beta 1 genes from seven unrelated individuals; V beta 1 genes were amplified by the polymerase chain reaction, the amplified fragments were cloned into M13 phage vectors, and sequences were determined. To determine the inheritance patterns of the V beta 1 substitution and to test correlation with V beta 1 restriction fragment length polymorphism detected with Pvu II and Taq I, allele-specific oligonucleotides were constructed and used to characterize amplified DNA samples. Seventy unrelated individuals and six families were tested for both restriction fragment length polymorphism and for the V beta 1 substitution. The correlation was also tested using amplified, size-selected, Pvu II- and Taq I-digested DNA samples from heterozygotes. Pvu II allele 1 (61/70) and Taq I allele 1 (66/70) were found to be correlated with the substitution giving rise to a histidine at position 48. Because there are exceptions to the correlation, the use of specific probes to characterize allelic forms of TCR variable genes will provide important tools for studies of basic TCR genetics and disease associations.\r"

The jimpy mutation jp of the mouse is an X chromosome-linked disorder of myelin formation. The mutation is at an intron/exon splice site in the mouse gene for proteolipid protein (PLP). With the jimpy mouse mutation as a precedent, we focused our attention on the human PLP gene, which is found at Xq22. The polymerase chain reaction was used to amplify the exons of the PLP gene of an affected male from a large Indiana PMD kindred. DNA sequencing showed a C----T transition at nucleotide 40 of the second exon. An affected third cousin also showed this sequence variation, while two unaffected male relatives (sons of an obligate carrier female) had the normal cytidine nucleotide. Allele-specific oligonucleotides were used to generate data for linkage studies on the above mentioned PMD kindred. Our results show tight linkage (theta = 0) of PMD to PLP with a lod (logarithm of odds) score of 4.62. In six other unrelated PMD kindreds, only the normal-sequence oligonucleotide hybridized, which indicates genetic heterogeneity. The radical nature of the predicted amino acid change (proline to leucine), suggests that the PMD-causing defect may have been delineated in one kindred.\r"

One member of the first class, SP1, was identical to an internal fragment of human HeLa cell Topo II cDNA described earlier. A member of the second class, SP11, shared extensive nucleotide (75%) and predicted peptide (92%) sequence similarities with the first two-thirds of HeLa Topo II. Each class of cDNAs hybridized to unique, nonoverlapping restriction enzyme fragments of genomic DNA from several human cell lines. Synthetic 24-mer oligonucleotide probes specific for each cDNA class hybridized to 6.5-kilobase mRNAs; furthermore, hybridization of probe specific for one class was not blocked by probe specific for the other. Antibodies raised against a synthetic SP1-encoded dodecapeptide specifically recognized the 170-kDa form of Topo II, while antibodies raised against the corresponding SP11-encoded dodecapeptide, or a second unique SP11-encoded tridecapeptide, selectively recognized the 180-kDa form of Topo II. These data provide genetic and immunochemical evidence for two Topo II isozymes.\r"

  ".W": "Metachromatic leukodystrophy is a metabolic disorder caused by the deficiency of arylsulfatase A. Deficiency of this enzyme is also found in apparently healthy individuals, a condition for which the term pseudodeficiency was introduced. The arylsulfatase A (cerebroside-3-sulfate 3-sulfohydrolase; EC 3.1.6.8) (ASA) encoding gene was isolated from an individual homozygous for the ASA pseudodeficiency allele. Sequence analysis revealed two A----G transitions. One changes Arg-350 to serine, which leads to the loss of a utilized N-glycosylation site. This loss explains the smaller size of ASA in ASA pseudodeficiency fibroblasts. The introduction of Ser-350 into normal ASA cDNA does not affect the rate of synthesis, the stability, or the catalytic properties of ASA in stably transfected baby hamster kidney cells. Therefore, the loss of the N-linked oligosaccharide does not contribute to the reduction of ASA activity in ASA pseudodeficiency. The other A----G transition changes the first polyadenylylation signal downstream of the stop codon from AATAAC to AGTAAC. The latter causes a severe deficiency of a 2.1-kilobase (kb) mRNA species. The deficiency of the 2.1-kb RNA species provides an explanation for the diminished synthesis of ASA seen in pseudodeficiency fibroblasts. Amplification of genomic DNA and hybridization with allele-specific oligonucleotides detected both mutations in four unrelated individuals with ASA pseudodeficiency.\r"

Such a hybrid protein exhibits high alkaline phosphatase enzymatic activity. When alkaline phosphatase is fused to the cytoplasmic domain of a membrane protein, it remains, for the most part, in the cytoplasm. Such fusions exhibit low enzymatic activity. However, stable retention of alkaline phosphatase in the cytoplasm requires the presence in the fusion protein of the cytoplasmic loop ordinarily present in that position in the native, unfused protein. Using oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis, we have shown that positively charged amino acids are required for the stable cytoplasmic localization of the fused alkaline phosphatase. We propose that, in addition to hydrophobic transmembrane segments, positively charged amino acids in the hydrophilic cytoplasmic domains of a membrane protein are determinants of the protein's topology.\r"

We show here that breaks occur with high frequency at or near the locus of a structure consisting of a 2.5-kilobase (kb) terminally deleted or fractured Ac element very tightly linked to a second, intact 4.6-kb Ac element. This structure has the features of a macrotransposon and may behave like one. Loss of the tight linkage abolishes chromosome breakage.

This IL-2 mRNA can be translated into functional protein. However, no steady-state mRNA for gamma-interferon can be detected under the same experimental conditions. Furthermore, when cycloheximide is administered at time 0 of activation, no IL-2 mRNA is seen. Nuclear run-on experiments indicate that IL-2 transcription in T helper 2 cells depends on the presence of cycloheximide. It is likely, therefore, that activation of T helper 2 cells leads to the production of a labile regulatory protein that represses the expression of the IL-2 gene. These findings provide insight into the molecular mechanism that governs the differentiation of interleukin 4-producing T helper 2 cells from IL-2-producing precursor cells.\r"

The 5' end of the human MC-CPA transcript was defined by direct mRNA sequencing and by isolation and partial sequencing of the human MC-CPA gene. Human MC-CPA is predicted to be translated as a 417 amino acid preproenzyme which includes a 15 amino acid signal peptide and a 94 amino acid activation peptide. The mature human MC-CPA enzyme has a predicted size of 36.1 kDa, a net positive charge of 16 at neutral pH, and 86% amino acid sequence identity with mouse MC-CPA. DNA blot analyses showed that human MC-CPA mRNA is transcribed from a single locus in the human genome. Comparison of the human MC-CPA with mouse MC-CPA and with three rat pancreatic carboxypeptidases shows that these enzymes are encoded by distinct but homologous genes.\r"

  ".W": "The interleukin 2-diphtheria toxin-related fusion protein (IL-2-toxin) rapidly inhibits protein synthesis in IL-2 receptor (IL-2R)-bearing phytohemagglutinin-activated T cells but transiently stimulates DNA synthesis. At 7 hr after interaction with IL-2R+ phytohemagglutinin-activated T cells, IL-2-toxin-treated cells bear augmented steady-state levels of c-myc, interferon gamma, and IL-2R mRNA; these effects are indistinguishable from those produced by recombinant IL-2. Amplification of IL-2 sequences by the polymerase chain reaction reveals an increased level of IL-2 mRNA in cell cultures treated with recombinant IL-2, IL-2-toxin, and cycloheximide. These results suggest that IL-2-toxin can affect de novo IL-2 gene transcription/mRNA stabilization through independent mechanisms exerted by both the IL-2R binding domain and ADP-ribosyltransferase activity of the fusion protein. After 20 hr of culture, IL-2R mRNA was markedly decreased in both IL-2-toxin- and cycloheximide-treated phytohemagglutinin-activated T cells. Although interaction of IL-2-toxin with IL-2R+ T cells initially mimics the stimulatory effects of IL-2 upon c-myc, interferon gamma, IL-2R, and IL-2 gene expression, the consequences of inhibition of protein synthesis mediated by the ADP-ribosyltransferase activity of the toxin dominate after 7 hr and are indistinguishable from those effects mediated by cycloheximide.\r"

In the presence of LiCl, the murine fibrosarcoma cell lines L929 and WEHI 164 clone 13 became greater than 10 times more sensitive to TNF-mediated cytotoxicity. The human tumor cell lines BT20 and HeLa D98/AH2 were also responsive to the cytotoxicity-enhancing effect of LiCl. Other monovalent or divalent cations did not affect TNF-mediated cytotoxicity. The potentiating effect of LiCl on TNF cytotoxicity was largely independent of transcription, and LiCl could be added to the cells as early as 2 hr before or as late as 4 hr after TNF without loss of effectiveness. The mechanism by which LiCl increases the cytotoxic response seems to differ from the sensitizing effect of actinomycin D or interferon gamma, since the latter treatments overcame TNF resistance of several cell lines, whereas LiCl did not. Evidence is presented that LiCl acts, either directly or indirectly, via the TNF-activated phospholipase A2 pathway. In nude mice, a combination of TNF and LiCl led to hemorrhagic necrosis and growth inhibition of L929 tumors, whereas little effect was observed when TNF was administered alone. HeLa D98/AH2 tumors also were sensitive to the potentiating effect of LiCl in vivo. We conclude that LiCl enhances the effectiveness of TNF in vitro and in vivo, results that may have therapeutic implications.\r"

In depression, these areas are not affected, but the pars opercularis and temporal pole are smaller than in controls. Results expressed per unit mass of total protein indicate selective reductions in both disorders of serotonin 2 recognition sites in all areas examined and of somatostatin content in only the temporal pole of the six areas examined. In dementia alone a selective loss was found of somatostatin content of the superior parietal lobule and of serotonin 1A sites and choline acetyltransferase activity in all areas examined. Results for depression expressed per entire area indicate additionally reduced somatostatin content and serotonin 1A sites in the pars opercularis and serotonin 1A sites in the temporal pole. These multiple analyses performed on each sample provide further support for a prominent disorder of pyramidal neurons in dementia as well as more evidence for alterations in cortical neurons in depression, either as a result of the disease itself or its treatment.\r"

  ".W": "The parafollicular-cell (C-cell) hormone calcitonin (CT) can preserve or even augment skeletal mass by inhibiting osteoclast-mediated bone resorption. The possibility of an additional anabolic skeletal influence has also been raised: C cells might, via CT or other secretory products, affect osteoblast-mediated bone formation. The 57-residue amino-terminal procalcitonin cleavage peptide, N-proCT, has recently been identified in human and rat C cells, where it is made and secreted in equimolar amounts with CT. The coelaboration of N-proCT and CT and N-proCT's sequence conservation during evolution prompted us to investigate the potential skeletal bioactivity of N-proCT. We found that synthetic human N-proCT, at nanomolar concentrations, stimulated proliferation of normal and neoplastic human osteoblasts. At maximally effective doses, human N-proCT caused more than a 100% increase above the control rate of DNA synthesis, an effect comparable to the maximal growth effect of insulin, a potent mitogen for osteoblasts. Human N-proCT exerted a similar maximal mitogenic effect in chicken osteoblast cultures but at 1000-fold greater concentrations than in human bone-cell cultures. The bone-cell action of N-proCT was potentiated with insulin with a greater than 200% increase in DNA synthesis at high insulin concentrations. In sharp contrast to these findings for N-proCT, the other bioactive C-cell peptides, CT and somatostatin, showed no mitogenic effects in human or chicken osteoblast cultures. Our results indicate that the action of N-proCT on cultured bone cells is separate from and potentiated by insulin, a known growth factor. Unlike insulin and related growth factors such as insulin-like growth factor I, N-proCT is not mitogenic in skin fibroblast cultures. We propose that N-proCT is a C-cell hormone that promotes bone formation via stimulatory actions on osteoblasts and preosteoblasts.\r"

  ".W": "Two epithelial tumor cell lines were established from biopsy specimens of nasopharyngeal carcinomas (NPC). The specimens were taken from poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinomas of the nasopharynx. The tissues were prepared for cell culture and eventually two continuous epithelial cell lines were obtained and designated HONE-1 and HNE-1. Light and electron microscopic examination of these two cell lines demonstrated cells with an epithelial morphology including the presence of desmosomes. The HNE-1 cell line has been passaged more than 100 times and the HONE-1 cell line has been passaged more than 90 times. It was found that early-passage uncloned HNE-1 cells (passage 23) could be superinfected with the B95-8 and NPC-EBV isolates as demonstrated by the induction of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-specific early antigen(s) in a small percentage of the cells; HONE-1 cells could also be superinfected with EBV. Southern blot analysis detected EBV DNA in samples from uncloned HNE-1 cells at passages 12, 17, 21, 27, and 35. However, by passage 45, EBV DNA could no longer be detected in HNE-1 cells by Southern blot analysis. The EBV genome was detected in parental HONE-1 cells at subculture 9 and in clone 40 cells up to passage 40 thus far. When HNE-1 cells were examined for the expression of the EBV-encoded nuclear antigen (EBNA) at passage 12, only about 10% of the cells were found to be positive. The percentage of EBNA-positive HNE-1 cells decreased as the cells were passaged. A similar loss of EBNA was observed in uncloned HONE-1 cells, but not in HONE-1 clone 40 cells. In clone 40, which has been passaged 40 times thus far, 85-90% of the cells are still EBNA-positive. The data suggest that EBV genome-positive HNE-1 and HONE-1 cells were lost as the cells were cultivated in vitro and that cloning the cells at an early passage level may be critical in maintaining EBV genome-positive epithelial NPC cells. These EBV genome-positive epithelial NPC cell lines will be useful for studying the association of EBV and NPC.\r"

Sequence analysis of amplified exons demonstrated within the AR steroid-binding domain (exon G) a single guanine to adenine mutation, resulting in replacement of valine with methionine at amino acid residue 866. As expected, the carrier mother had both normal and mutant AR genes. Thus, a single point mutation in the steroid-binding domain of the AR gene correlated with the expression of an AR protein ineffective in stimulating male sexual development.\r"

The relationship of a recently isolated cDNA clone, designated rnat, to genetically polymorphic arylamine N-acetyltransferase (NAT; acetyl-CoA:arylamine N-acetyltransferase, EC 2.3.1.5) of rabbit liver was established by its expression in monkey kidney COS-1 cells: (i) cytosols from transfected cultures contained high levels of an Ac-CoA-dependent NAT activity, which was kinetically indistinguishable from that observed in cytosols from livers of genetically rapid-acetylator rabbits; (ii) transfected cells also contained an immunoreactive protein, recognized by NAT-specific antibodies, with identical electrophoretic mobility to NAT from rabbit liver. The rnat clone and anti-NAT antibodies were then used to study the relationship between NAT activity, liver enzyme protein, and the level of mRNA in livers from in vivo phenotyped rapid- and slow-acetylator rabbits. Livers from slow acetylators were devoid of both immunodetectable NAT protein and its corresponding mRNA. Analysis of genomic DNA with a panel of restriction enzymes revealed the loss of specific hybridizing bands in the DNA of slow-acetylator rabbits. These data strongly suggest that defective arylamine N-acetylation in the rabbit model is caused by a gene deletion resulting in an absence of specific mRNA and NAT enzyme protein.\r"

  ".W": "Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) efficiently transforms B lymphocytes to perpetual proliferation. The EBV laboratory strain P3HR-1 is transformation-incompetent and lacks a DNA segment that includes the EBV nuclear antigen 2 (EBNA-2) gene and a portion of the EBNA leader protein (EBNA-LP) gene. These two genes are expressed in transformed B lymphocytes. Recombinant transformation-competent EBVs were produced by transfecting P3HR-1-infected cells with a cosmid containing the DNA deleted in P3HR-1. Deletion of 105 nucleotides from the middle of the EBNA-2 gene had no discernible affect on transformation. Two larger EBNA-2 deletions abolished transformation but did not affect EBNA-2 nuclear localization. Two naturally occurring EBV variants (EBV types 1 and 2) differ extensively in their growth-transformation phenotype and in their EBNA-LP, EBNA-2, and EBNA-3A, -3B, and -3C genes. Recombinant P3HR-1 carrying EBV-1 EBNA-2 has many of the EBV-1 in vitro growth-transforming effects; recombinant P3HR-1, isogenic except for EBV-2 EBNA-2, has many of the EBV-2 growth-transforming effects including slow emergence of transformants, growth in tight clumps with few surrounding viable cells, and early sensitivity to dilution with fresh medium. Thus, EBNA-2 is an essential molecule in lymphocyte growth transformation by EBV and a major determinant of the differences between EBV-1 and EBV-2 in lymphocyte growth transformation.\r"

Studies of the cyclase in mammalian cerebral cortex have suggested that Ca2+/CaM sensitivity is confined to a subpopulation of total cyclase activity. We investigated the properties of cyclase from Aplysia, rat, and bovine central nervous system membranes by using CaM-Sepharose chromatography. Although only a minority of total cyclase activity bound to the CaM column, both bound and unbound fractions of cyclase from all three species showed comparable stimulation by Ca2+ in the presence of CaM. When solubilized bovine membranes were first depleted of most of their endogenous CaM by prior chromatography, binding to the CaM column was substantially increased and Ca2+ stimulation of the unbound fraction was somewhat reduced. However, this reduction in Ca2+ sensitivity resulted from the loss of Ca2+ sensitivity during prior chromatography, rather than from the more efficient separation of Ca2+-sensitive and -insensitive forms. This finding, together with the fact that we never observed any enrichment for Ca2+ sensitivity in the bound fraction over the level in the starting preparation, suggests that the vast majority of the cyclase present in solubilized central nervous system membranes is Ca2+/CaM-sensitive.\r"

This paper completes the model by showing how bidirectional control of synaptic weight could be achieved. It is proposed that the quantitative level of the activity-dependent rise in postsynaptic Ca2+ determines whether the synaptic weight will increase or decrease. It is further proposed that reduction of synaptic weight is governed by protein phosphatase 1, an enzyme indirectly controlled by Ca2+ through reactions involving phosphatase inhibitor 1, cAMP-dependent protein kinase, calcineurin, and adenylate cyclase. Modeling of this biochemical system shows that it can function as an analog computer that can store a synaptic weight and modify it in accord with the Hebb and anti-Hebb learning rules.\r"

This peptide fragment displaced 125I-labeled galanin in receptor autoradiography experiments on rat forebrain and spinal cord and in equilibrium binding experiments from high-affinity binding sites in the ventral hippocampus with an IC50 of approximately 3 nM. In tissue slices of the same brain area, galanin-(1-16), similarly to galanin, inhibited the muscarinic agonist-stimulated breakdown of inositol phospholipids. Upon intracerebroventricular administration, galanin-(1-16) (10 micrograms/15 microliters) also inhibited the scopolamine (0.3 mg/kg, s.c.)-evoked release of acetylcholine, as studied in vivo by microdialysis. Substitution of [L-Trp2] for [D-Trp2] resulted in a 500-fold loss in affinity as compared with galanin-(1-16). It is concluded that, in the ventral hippocampus, the N-terminal galanin fragment [galanin-(1-16)] is recognized by the galanin receptors controlling acetylcholine release and muscarinic agonist-stimulated inositol phospholipid breakdown as a high-affinity agonist and that amino acid residue [Trp2] plays an important role in the receptor-ligand interactions.\r"

The trypsinized channels opened repeatedly in bursts of several seconds duration, as would be expected for channels whose fast inactivation process had been removed. Furthermore, they have a higher conductance, different voltage-dependence of gating, and a remarkably higher selectivity (PNa/PK = 41) than sodium channels bound by batrachotoxin or other activating neurotoxins; these properties of the trypsinized channels are probably closer to those of channels in intact electrocytes.\r"

M. H., Koller, K., Zaczek, R., Coyle, J. T., Hori, N. & Carpenter, D. O. (1985) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 82, 3897-3900]. However, we have been unable to reproduce this observation using synthetic NAAG, and instead we offer an alternative explanation. In our experiments, iontophoresis of the sodium salt of synthetic NAAG did not induce single-unit spiking at sites in slices of rat piriform cortex that responded vigorously to L-glutamate. In contrast, iontophoresis of the potassium salt of synthetic NAAG or of potassium ions alone induced single unit activity. The responses to both NAAG/KCl and KCl alone were inhibited by L-2-amino-4-phosphonobutanoic acid and desensitized rapidly, as previously reported for NAAG. These results suggest that residual potassium ions, remaining after the original purification of NAAG, were responsible for the excitations attributed to NAAG.\r"

Bleached rods do not recover sensitivity, or do so only very slowly, after exposure to 11-cis-retinol. The latter retinoid is \"toxic\" in that rods actually lose sensitivity in its presence. In contrast, bleached isolated cone cells recover sensitivity when either retinoid is supplied. It is suggested that the major pathway for rhodopsin regeneration during dark adaptation in the intact eye is transport of 11-cis-retinal from the pigment epithelium to the retina. The results also suggest that there may be separate pathways for visual-pigment regeneration in rods and cones during dark adaptation.\r"

One such cell line, L-S1, possesses features of 5-[3H]HT uptake similar to those previously characterized in the central nervous system and blood platelets: (i) specificity for 5-HT; (ii) antagonism by imipramine, a known inhibitor of high-affinity 5-HT uptake; (iii) both Na+ and temperature dependences; (iv) kinetic saturability; and (v) high affinity for 5-HT (Km = 0.39 +/- 0.10 microM; Vmax = 2.14 +/- 0.55 pmol/min per mg of protein). This cell line can be used to compare the relative efficacies of known blockers of 5-HT uptake and thereby offers a rapid and reliable assay system for testing novel inhibitors of this system. Since L-S1 contains stably integrated human DNA in its genome, we postulate that the observed 5-HT-uptake system resulted from the expression of human gene(s) coding for the 5-HT transporter. Thus, cell lines such as L-S1 may represent novel means for screening and developing therapeutic agents specific for neurotransmitter-uptake systems as well as substrates for the cloning and elucidation of the genes encoding the various neurotransmitter transporters.\r"

To examine possible mechanisms by which these peptides induce their physiological actions in brain, the effects of Som-14 and Som-28 on voltage-dependent K+ currents in rat cerebral cortical neurons in culture were examined by using whole-cell patch-clamp techniques. Som-14 increased a delayed rectifier K+ current (IK) in the cortical neurons, while Som-28 reduced IK in the neurons, both in a concentration-dependent manner. Som-14 and Som-28 could induce opposite changes in IK in the same neurons. Elevating intracellular cAMP in the cortical neurons did not modify the effects of Som-14 or Som-28 on IK, indicating that the peptides can regulate this ionic current through cAMP-independent mechanisms. Pretreatment of the neocortical cells with pertussis toxin, which inactivates inhibitory GTP-binding proteins, abolished both Som-14 and Som-28 modulation of IK, indicating that Som-14 and Som-28 receptors are coupled to IK via GTP-binding proteins. These studies show that Som-14 and Som-28 can induce opposite biological effects, suggesting that Som-14 and Som-28, acting through distinct receptors, may function as different neurotransmitters or neuromodulators.\r"

In spite of the apparently random genetic basis of the process of antigenic variation, the relapsing parasitemias are characterized by an as yet unexplained order of appearance of major VSG variants. Here we mathematically test hypotheses concerning the blood-based parasitemia. In our model the antigenic switches occur at random at the DNA level. A variable proportion of the switches has a short intermediate phase in which two different VSGs simultaneously occur on the cell surface. We show that, in a theoretical population of 230 single expressor variants in an immunocompetent or in an immunodeficient host, it is not possible to explain the ordered appearance of variants by affecting the growth coefficients of single expressors or double expressors or by affecting the antigen switch probabilities. Rather, a realistic parasitemia can be obtained if the majority of switches has a double expressor switch-intermediate phase and if the double expressors have a differential susceptibility to the immune control. This study is significant in providing a theoretical basis for the ordered appearance of variants and in explaining previously unresolved discrepancies between the rate of appearance of new variants in culture and in vivo. In addition, testable predictions as to the development of the infections, switch rate of variants, fraction of double expressors, and parasite mortality coefficients are generated.\r"

The induced reduction of apparent contrast is greatly diminished when (i) the texture patch and background are filtered into nonoverlapping spatial frequency bands or (ii) the texture patch and background are presented to different eyes.

The records of infants born with facial weakness or paralysis over a 5-year period at Brigham and Women's Hospital were reviewed, and criteria were defined to assign a diagnosis of acquired facial palsy based on birth history and documented physical examinations. The majority of patients were followed up by interview with a family member. Among 44,292 infants born between October 1, 1982 and July 31, 1987, there were 92 recorded cases of congenital seventh nerve palsy. Of these, 81 were acquired, for an incidence of 1.8 per 1000. Seventy-four of the 81 (91 percent) were associated with forceps delivery. By contrast, obstetric forceps were used in 19 percent of all deliveries during the period of the study. The average weight of subjects was 3.55 kg, versus a mean overall birth weight of 3.23 kg. Fifty-nine percent of mothers of affected children and 37 percent of controls were prima gravidas. Forceps delivery, birth weight of 3500 gm or more, and primiparity were all significant risk factors for acquired facial palsy. The incidence of additional birth injuries also was substantially higher among affected subjects than among the general population of newborns. Sixty-six of 81 patients had adequate follow-up. Recovery has been complete for 59 patients (89 percent) and incomplete for the remaining 7 (mean follow-up 34 months). In summary, congenital traumatic facial palsy has definable risk factors and a predictably favorable outcome.\r"

In the first patient, one implant alone was used, and in the second patient, two implants in separate but adjacent pockets. The resulting double contour is more pleasing than that after a single implant, and there also appears to be more flexibility with shoulder motion. This method is suggested as an excellent means of reconstructing the contour of the shoulder area following resection for cancer.\r"

  ".W": "Use of enteric grafts is a popular method for reconstruction of the cervical esophagus and hypopharynx. Free jejunal transfer (FJT) and gastric pull-up (GP) are the most popular methods used. This discussion is a retrospective review of our experience with 50 cases of free jejunal transfer and 15 cases of gastric pull-up. The graft survival rate was 94 percent (47 of 50) for free jejunal transfer and 87 percent (13 of 15) for gastric pull-up. Successful swallowing was achieved in 88 percent (44 of 50) of free jejunal transfers and 87 percent (13 of 15) of gastric pull-ups. Patients with free jejunal transfers were able to swallow and leave the hospital sooner: 10.6 versus 16.0 days and 22.3 versus 29.0 days, respectively. Fistulas occurred in 16 percent (8 of 50) of free jejunal transfers, most of which (6 of 8) healed spontaneously. Fistulas occurred in 20 percent (3 of 15) of gastric pull-ups, only one of which healed spontaneously. Stricture was the most common late complication for free jejunal transfers, 22 percent (11 of 50), whereas reflux was most common in gastric pull-ups, 20 percent (3 of 15). In patients with advanced cancer, extensive esophageal resection into the chest is often required, and gastric pull-up seems to be an easier and more direct form of reconstruction. In limited resection of the hypopharynx and esophagus, especially with proximal lesions, free jejunal transfer is simpler and avoids mediastinal dissection. This concept as well as other advantages and disadvantages of both techniques will be discussed.\r"

The previously developed medial plantar fasciocutaneous island flap has been adapted to cover soft-tissue defects over these areas. This fasciocutaneous flap based on the medial plantar neurovascular bundle is capable of providing sensate and structurally similar local tissue. Application of this fasciocutaneous island flap is demonstrated in 12 clinical cases. Successful soft-tissue cover was achieved on the plantar calcaneus (four patients), tendo calcaneus (four patients), lower leg (two patients), and plantar forefoot (two patients). Follow-up ranged from 6 months to 5 years. All flaps were viable at follow-up. Protective sensation was present in 11 of 12 flaps evaluated at 6 months. In addition, all 11 patients were able to ambulate in normal footwear. The medial plantar island flap seems to be more durable than a skin graft, and the donor site on the non-weight-bearing instep is well tolerated. This study demonstrates that the medial plantar fasciocutaneous island flap should be considered as another valuable tool in reconstructive efforts directed at the plantar forefoot, plantar heel, posterior ankle, and lower leg.\r"

Quantitative and qualitative data were analyzed and contrasted at both periods of evaluation (1.5 and 3.0 months). The embryonic origin of onlay bone grafts to the rabbit snout is significantly correlated with graft surface area, volume, weight, and recipient bed union for up to 3 months postoperatively. Over this interval, membranous bone (calvaria) grafts either persist in their entirety or increase, whereas endochondral bone (iliac) grafts resorb. Neither the number of cortices (unicortical or bicortical) nor the orientation of unicortical grafts (cortex-to-bed relationship) affected graft fate regardless of embryonic origin. Bone density remained unaltered during both resorption and deposition. Osteogenesis, demonstrated by serial fluorochrome markers, occurs in both membranous and endochondral bone grafts. Histologically, bone grafts of membranous and endochondral origin differ greatly in their cortical to cancellous diploe ratios and architectural configuration. We hypothesize that the differences found are related to the three-dimensional osseous architecture rather than to the embryonic origin of bone per se.\r"

Thirty male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized to receive either 2.5 mg/kg nifedipine in chocolate PO t.i.d. or plain chocolate according to protocols. Serum nifedipine levels were determined by gas chromatography. Dorsal cephalad-based random vascular pedicle flaps (2 X 6 cm) were elevated, sutured to their beds, and photographed for computer-aided surface area determinations. The extent of distal flap necrosis was expressed as a percentage of the total flap area, and differences were studied by one-way analysis of variance. The differences between the mean percentages of necrosis at 1 and 2 weeks for the groups were not statistically significant. We conclude that nifedipine has no effect on the extent of necrosis of the random skin flap in the rat.\r"

Under the microscope, grafts are anastomosed to peripheral lymphatics distal to and central lymphatics proximal to the regional blockade. In this way, the diminished transport capacity can be restored. In the case of unilateral blockade at the groin or pelvis, the grafts connect the lymphatics of the thigh of the affected leg with lymphatics in the contralateral healthy groin. Between June of 1980 and December of 1986, 55 patients with lymphedemas have been treated by lymphatic grafting. The effect of lymph vessel transplantation has been evaluated by volume measurements and lymphatic scintiscans, showing a persistent patency of grafts, improvement of the transport index, and a persistent reduction in volume of the affected limbs. The reduction reached a level of 80 percent in patients with a follow-up of at least 3 years. The transport index showed an improvement of 30 percent. Autologous lymph vessel transplantation has been shown to be a fundamental step toward the microsurgical treatment of lymphedema.\r"

This experimental study in sheep was to answer the question of limitation of elongation of a motor nerve by grafting, the question of the optimal time for suturing the nerve graft to the muscle nerve, and the question of the successful application of this surgical technique in extremities. In 18 sheep, the vastus nerve was elongated by a saphenous nerve graft as long as possible up to 30 cm (step 1). In 10 animals the nerve graft was applied ipsilaterally, and in 8 animals it was used as a cross-over nerve graft to the contralateral limb. The time between nerve grafting and connection of the distal end of the nerve graft to the freshly cut rectus nerve supplying the rectus femoris muscle (step 2) was variable: 0, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. In all animals, the final experiments (step 3) were performed 6 months after the last operation (step 2). Muscle force measurements in the rectus femoris muscle and quantitative analysis of the number and diameter of myelinated nerve fibers in cross sections of the nerve biopsies at different levels showed that elongation of a motor nerve by nerve grafting is principally not limited. The functional results were rather inhomogeneous and therefore unpredictable (ipsilateral group: maximum tetanic tension = 27 to 172 N; cross-over group: 0 to 227.5 N). Nevertheless, crossover nerve grafting is recommended for selected cases even in extremities. There was no correlation between the time interval between the two operations and the functional or morphologic results, although better functional results were obtained when the distal nerve suture (step 2) was performed some months after nerve grafting (step 1). A clear correlation was found only between the number of regenerated axons in the rectus nerve behind the second suture line and the muscle function.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of catecholamines on skin necrosis independent of their vasoactive effects. Rat abdominal or human breast skin was excised, pinned flat, and incubated at 37 degrees C for 6 hours in a buffered salt solution containing catecholamine. At 0.1 and 6 hours the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) released from the skin and appearing in the buffer was determined spectrophotometrically. All groups showed similar LDH levels at 0.1 hour. Rat skin treated with greater than or equal to 10(-7) M epinephrine (33 times less than the 1:200,000 used clinically) or greater than or equal to 10(-5) M norepinephrine showed a significant increase in the LDH released at 6 hours versus controls (18.75 +/- 1.25 versus 13.75 +/- 1.25 and 29.25 +/- 2.96 versus 22.00 +/- 1.96 IV, respectively). Total tissue LDH levels were not significantly different at 0.1 or 6 hours. The toxic effect of epinephrine was eliminated by the addition of propranolol or selective beta 2 blockade, but not by alpha or beta 1 blockade. Therefore, this effect appears to be mediated largely by beta 2 receptors. Similar toxic effects were seen in human breast skin treated with 1:200,000 epinephrine and were blocked with propranolol. Phenylephrine at 1:20,000 demonstrated toxicity, but angiotensin II and vasopressin did not. These studies indicate that addition of catecholamine to ischemic rat or human skin accelerates skin death within 6 hours, but that the toxicity can be reversed with beta blockade.\r"

The effectiveness of these univariate methods was then compared with that of multivariate models based on discriminant function analysis. The multivariate models were somewhat better at predicting death within the first month in newly-admitted patients, and in predicting lack of functional improvement between one and six months in those still in hospital at one month. Even so, these predictions could not be made with certainty and the improvements in probability offered by multivariate over univariate analysis are unlikely to be of practical benefit to the clinician. Single variables such as power in the affected arm and continence were as good as the discriminant functions at predicting discharge within the first month and first six months, respectively. The predictive power of these single simple clinical variables was validated in a separate group of 277 stroke patients. The various proposed methods of prognostication in stroke need to be compared in prospective studies, but until this is done, we recommend a simple approach using the best available clinical information.\r"

There were 310 patients who received dialysis, 53 with acute renal failure and 211 with chronic renal disease. Renal transplant patients were not included in the study. Apart from infections related to dialysis access, patients on maintenance haemodialysis or continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis developed few serious infections unless they had another disease causing suppression of immune function. A total of 97 urinary tract infections were seen; in patients with chronic renal disease not receiving dialysis the incidence of urinary tract infection was significantly associated with increasing uraemia, with diabetes, and with treatment with azathioprine or cyclophosphamide. In patients with acute renal failure, Gram-negative septicaemia and fungal infections were important causes of morbidity and mortality, but cardiovascular disease caused 42 per cent of the deaths unlike results from other series where sepsis has been by far the commonest cause of death.\r"

Hypocalcaemia and hyperphosphataemia were apparent in all subjects at presentation. Parathyroid hormone levels were absent or inappropriately low in all. Important features highlighted were the long duration of symptoms before diagnosis, the suppression of tetany by treatment with diphenylhydantoin, the association of idiopathic hypoparathyroidism and epilepsy in adults, and the occurrence of reversible cardiac muscle dysfunction.\r"

A significantly higher number of non-insulin dependent diabetic patients had abnormal albumin excretion compared with the insulin-dependent group (X2 = 15.2, p less than 0.002). Ten per cent of non-insulin-dependent and 7 per cent of insulin-dependent diabetic patients had albumin excretion rates in the range 30-150 micrograms/min and thus were at risk of the cardiovascular and renal complications of diabetes. Six per cent of non-insulin-dependent and 5 per cent of insulin-dependent diabetic patients had albumin excretion rates above 150 micrograms/min and thus were entering the phase of clinical diabetic nephropathy. Multivariate analysis revealed that male sex and retinopathy in insulin-dependent diabetes, and systolic blood pressure and retinopathy and peripheral vascular disease in non-insulin-dependent diabetes, were significantly related to albumin excretion. Only one patient with insulin-dependent diabetes of less than 5 years known duration had an albumin excretion rate in the range 30-150 micrograms/min, whereas such an excretion rate indicating patients at risk was observed at all durations of non-insulin-dependent diabetes. It is possible that during the long silent phase of non-insulin-dependent diabetes, before diagnosis, significant renal damage occurred.\r"

No endocrine or neurological cause for hypothermia could be distinguished. Physiological investigation, including a sympathetic release test, exposure to gradually increasing environmental temperatures and prolonged exposure to a high temperature suggested she was at that time regulating her core temperature around a set value which was several degrees lower than normal. Metabolic rate was 42 per cent below the value predicted from standard tables. Further measurements over a one-month period in a warm climate suggested a poikilothermic temperature control mechanism, with a possible risk of environmental hyperthermia. No pathological basis for this disorder has yet been identified, but it is suggested that a small localized hypothalamic vascular event has occurred.\r"

  ".U": "90083632\r", 
  ".W": "Studies were directed to characterization of the anaemia of renal failure of 11 patients on haemodialysis and determination of the way in which it is corrected by human erythropoietin derived from recombinant DNA expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells (r-HuEPO) administered intravenously. Erythrokinetics before treatment showed that total red cell mass was below normal and that both erythron transferrin uptake and red cell survival were modestly reduced; treatment increased both total red cell mass and erythron transferrin uptake but did not change red cell survival in previously untransfused patients. When BFU-e and CFU-e from patient bone marrow were cultured in autologous serum we found no evidence for inhibitors of erythroid progenitor maturation in patient serum compared with normal. Erythroid expansion in response to r-HuEPO was not limited by the availability of iron, iron requirements for new red cell formation being met from stores (if adequate) or from oral iron supplements. In pharmacokinetic studies the plasma clearance of r-HuEPO could be expressed by a three-parameter exponential curve with T1/2 range of 2.3 to 7.3 h. T1/2 after the first dose of r-HuEPO was not significantly different from that after 14 to 54 weeks treatment when the erythron had expanded to a new steady state. Erythron transferrin uptake before treatment was related to endogenous production of erythropoietin estimated from the plasma clearance of the first dose of r-HuEPO administered intravenously. This finding suggested that the availability of erythropoietin was the main factor limiting expansion of the erythron. This conclusion was supported by the continuity of the relationship during the response to treatment.\r"

The only demonstrable abnormalities of her immune system were impaired T-cell function and antibody production by B-cells (detectable to smooth muscle, mitochondria and gastric parietal cells). The T-cell abnormality may have been part of a more generalized cell defect, resulting from an unidentified genetic abnormality, whilst the circulating antibodies could have been a response to tissue damage.

  ".U": "90083634\r", 
  ".W": "The development of anterior pituitary hormone deficiencies has been studied in a group of 165 patients who underwent external radiotherapy for tumours of the pituitary or closely related anatomical sites, and who have been observed for up to 10 years. One hundred and forty had undergone pituitary surgery before radiotherapy. All patients received external radiotherapy by a three-field technique, giving 3750-4250 cGy in 15 or 16 fractions over 20-22 days. A combined test of anterior pituitary function using insulin hypoglycaemia or glucagon stimulation in conjunction with thyrotrophin and gonadotrophin releasing hormone tests and basal estimations of prolactin, thyroid hormones and testosterone or oestradiol was performed before radiotherapy. This was repeated six and 12 months later and subsequently annually. Before radiotherapy, 18 per cent of patients had normal growth hormone secretion, 21 per cent had normal gonadotrophin secretion, 57 per cent had normal corticotrophin reserve and 80 per cent had normal thyrotrophin secretion. Life table analysis demonstrated increasing incidences of all anterior pituitary hormone deficiencies with time: by five years all patients were growth hormone deficient, 91 per cent were gonadotrophin deficient, 77 per cent were corticotrophin deficient and 42 per cent were thyrotrophin deficient. At eight years, respective incidences of deficiencies were 100, 96, 84 and 49 per cent. Radiation-induced hyperprolactinaemia was seen in 73 patients; mean serum prolactin concentration rose from 227 +/- 11 mU/l to a peak of 369 +/- 60 mU/l at two years and subsequently declined towards the basal value. The primary diagnosis, patient age, sex, irradiated tissue volume and previous surgery were examined as variables that might influence the rate of development of anterior pituitary hormone deficiencies, but none of these factors had a significant effect. The radiation induced hyperprolactinaemia was however more marked in female patients. Although anterior pituitary hormone deficiencies most commonly developed in the order growth hormone, gonadotrophin, corticotrophin, thyrotrophin (61 per cent of patients), other sequences were evident. Most notably corticotrophin deficiency occurred before gonadotrophin deficiency. There is a high incidence of anterior pituitary hormone deficiencies in patients treated surgically for pituitary tumours and the incidence increases after external radiotherapy. Deficiencies may occur in an unpredictable sequence and endocrine testing is recommended on an annual basis.\r"

Fifty-four per cent of our patients were older than 65 years and 66 per cent suffered from chronic ill health. Their mean APACHE score was 18 +/- 8 (mean +/- SD). Quality of life was assessed by the Karnofsky index of physical performance; the linear analogue self assessment (LASA) score; sleep index; level of employment; sexual activity; housing status. Thirty-seven per cent of the patients died in ICU and another 10 per cent in hospital. The one year survival of the entire group was 37 per cent. Survival rates were significantly higher in patients with a Karnofsky index of 6 or more, LASA score of 55 or more, in employment, and with sleep index of 2 or more (p less than 0.05). The 12-month survival among patients with four favourable indicators was 59 per cent, with two or three favourable indicators 36 per cent (p less than 0.05), and in patients with no favourable indicators of quality of life or only one 17 per cent (p less than 0.001). Quality of life in patients who survived longer than six months after ICU care was high (Karnofsky index 7.9 +/- 2.0; LASA score 71 +/- 20 (mean +/- SD) and unimpaired when compared with their ratings before admission to the unit. These findings indicate that quality of life before admission is an important predictor of survival and that a high proportion of critically-ill subjects whose quality of life was relatively good before the episode requiring admission will be long-term survivors whose quality of life is comparable to that preceding critical care.\r"

The NK cell isoform was not expressed on the surface of COS cells unless cotransfected with a subunit that was expressed in NK cells and that was identical to the gamma subunit of the high affinity IgE Fc receptor (Fc epsilon RI). However, the CD16 sequence and not expression of the gamma subunit is dominant in regulating PIG reanchoring.\r"

  ".W": "One action of cyclosporin A thought to be central to many of its immunosuppressive effects is its ability to inhibit the early events of T lymphocyte activation such as lymphokine gene transcription in response to signals initiated at the antigen receptor. Cyclosporin A was found to specifically inhibit the appearance of DNA binding activity of NF-AT, AP-3, and to a lesser extent NF-kappa B, nuclear proteins that appear to be important in the transcriptional activation of the genes for interleukin-2 and its receptor, as well as several other lymphokines. In addition, cyclosporin A abolished the ability of the NF-AT binding site to activate a linked promoter in transfected mitogen-stimulated T lymphocytes and in lymphocytes from transgenic mice. These results indicate that cyclosporin A either directly inhibits the function of nuclear proteins critical to T lymphocyte activation or inhibits the action of a more proximal member of the signal transmission cascade leading from the antigen receptor to the nucleus.\r"

  ".W": "The pituitary hormone thyrotropin, or thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), is the main physiological agent that regulates the thyroid gland. The thyrotropin receptor (TSHR) was cloned by selective amplification with the polymerase chain reaction of DNA segments presenting sequence similarity with genes for G protein-coupled receptors. Out of 11 new putative receptor clones obtained from genomic DNA, one had sequence characteristics different from all the others. Although this clone did not hybridize to thyroid transcripts, screening of a dog thyroid complementary DNA (cDNA) library at moderate stringency identified a cDNA encoding a 4.9-kilobase thyroid-specific transcript. The polypeptide encoded by this thyroid-specific transcript consisted of a 398-amino acid residue amino-terminal segment, constituting a putative extracellular domain, connected to a 346-residue carboxyl-terminal domain that contained seven putative transmembrane segments. Expression of the cDNA conferred TSH responsiveness to Xenopus oocytes and Y1 cells and a TSH binding phenotype to COS cells. The TSHR and the receptor for luteinizing hormone-choriogonadotropin constitute a subfamily of G protein-coupled receptors with distinct sequence characteristics.\r"

We prospectively studied 33 consecutive patients with pleural effusions to determine whether the fluid arose from a transudative or an exudative process. Clinical judgment by an internist before thoracentesis and both serum and pleural fluid protein and lactic dehydrogenase levels (commonly referred to as \"Light's criteria\") were compared to the patient's final diagnosis. The internist correctly classified 15 of 17 exudative processes and all 16 transudative processes; the presence of any one of Light's three criteria correctly classified 15 of 17 exudative processes, whereas the absence of all three criteria correctly classified 14 of 16 transudative processes. Clinical judgment and Light's criteria are comparable in their ability to predict whether an exudative or transudative process was responsible for the effusion. Both methods are associated with errors, though of different kinds; these errors occurred infrequently. Recognizing the limitations of these methods will permit the most accurate effusion categorization.\r"

Factors not associated with an increased risk included age, sex, a history of pulmonary disorders, previous abdominal operations, operative time, and need for transfusions, management of the pelvic peritoneum, or perineal drainage.

Numerous patients were subsequently found to have onset of diarrhea shortly after the initiation of treatment with theophylline elixir. Although theophylline can promote gastrointestinal secretion and motility, this effect should be independent of the route of theophylline administration and the stool should be characteristic of secretory rather than osmotic diarrhea. Patients taking no food orally while taking theophylline elixir continued to have osmotic diarrhea in excess of 1,000 ml/24 hr. Patients whose therapy was switched to intravenous or solid oral theophylline had resolution of diarrhea within 24 hours. The brand of theophylline elixir used was formulated with 30 gm of sorbitol per 240 mg of theophylline; thus a standard regimen of theophylline elixir was delivering four laxative doses of sorbitol daily. A cursory review revealed that many medicinal elixirs are formulated with sorbitol, despite being designated \"sugar-free.\" When patients have osmotic diarrhea in the hospital, beware the medicinal elixir.\r"

Seventy-five percent of patients had localized disease, primarily in the rectum and appendix. Colon and small bowel tumors were often manifested with metastatic disease. Complete surgical excision of all localized disease was curative in 94% of patients. Corrected five- and ten-year survival rates were 90% and 58%, respectively, in cases of localized disease, whereas in stage III disease, the rates were 46% and less than 30%, respectively. All patients with liver metastasis died within 25 months. A second malignancy, most often adenocarcinoma of the colon, occurred in 25% of patients. Carcinoid syndrome was found in 6% of patients. The best survival rates were noted for appendiceal and rectal carcinoids, and the worst for colon and stomach carcinoids.\r"

The intent is to integrate endoscopy into the mainstream of surgical education such that it will be approached and used the same as any of the many diagnostic and therapeutic tools at the surgeon's disposal. The current feeling is that although endoscopy should be intimately incorporated into training, there is a level of technical expertise required such that a dedicated teaching experience must be provided. This education must be directed by a surgeon experienced in endoscopy; we should not abdicate this responsibility to others. The training program should be founded on education, clinical practice, and research, with technical skills to begin in PGY 2 or PGY 3 and be incorporated throughout the remainder of training. Quality assurance should be monitored closely but not separately from that of the surgical service. Certification of the resident should not depend on numbers, nor be specifically singled out from the body of surgery. There is adequate patient demand to establish the endoscopy unit under the supervision of a surgeon, either as a separate unit or as part of the surgical clinic. However, as the number of endoscopic procedures performed approaches 600 per year, a fully dedicated endoscopy room and full-time gastrointestinal assistant technician are required. The most efficient method of postsedation recovery is through coordination with an ambulatory surgery unit or postoperative recovery room. The current standard for equipment is video endoscopy in order to provide the most efficient method for surgical training.\r"

  ".W": "Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, endoscopic sphincterotomy, and endoscopic biliary drainage have dramatically changed the diagnosis and management of disorders of the pancreas and hepatobiliary tract. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography will provide a high-resolution study that will define accurately the nature and location of the disease process involving the pancreas or bile ducts. Although sonography, CT, and, recently, MRI may provide clues to the diagnosis, it often remains for endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography to establish the diagnosis with certainty. Endoscopic sphincterotomy has been invaluable in the management of common bile-duct stones. In patients who have had their gallbladders removed, sphincterotomy has avoided reoperation in the same field and the risk of general anesthesia. Sphincterotomy also is assuming an increasingly important role in the management of common-duct stones in patients with their gallbladders in situ who are poor operative candidates. In these patients, sphincterotomy likewise avoids the risk of general anesthesia and the surgical stress of opening a major body cavity. The technique has also proved to be helpful in the palliative treatment of ampullary and distal common bile-duct carcinomas in those patients who are poor operative candidates. Finally, sphincterotomy has found a role in the treatment of choledochal cysts and may provide relief of pain in those patients with the elusive diagnoses of postcholecystectomy syndromes, biliary dyskinesias, and sphincter of Oddi dysfunction. Endoscopic biliary drainage is becoming an increasingly popular option for the palliation of malignant biliary obstruction. In those patients who are poor operative candidates, the risk of general anesthesia and major surgery is avoided. In those patients with obviously incurable tumors, endoscopic drainage allows for a brief hospitalization without surgery in the face of a short life expectancy.\r"

  ".W": "Surgical exploration of the common bile duct is performed blindly, and perhaps this is one of the reasons the incidence of retained stones is higher than it should be. The introduction of the choledochoscope was promising, but a recent survey found that although a majority of hospitals where biliary surgery is performed have the instrument in the operating room, only a small percentage of surgeons use it routinely. This means that the general surgeon is not an endoscopist and choledocholithotomy cases are only 10 to 20 per cent of the existing biliary material. The introduction of the video choledochoscope shortened the learning curve for the surgeon significantly. The enlarged image can be seen conveniently from a distance with both eyes. Intraoperative stone retrieval requires four hands, and with video endoscopy, movements are coordinated, as the entire operating team can see the process. Therefore, the procedure is more precise and faster. The few missed stones can be removed with ease in the postoperative period through the T-tube tract. The procedure is safe and accurate and can be performed on an outpatient basis.\r"

  ".W": "Methods of diagnosis and treatment of lower gastrointestinal bleeding depend on the rate of bleeding and the amount of blood lost. If bleeding is occult, colonoscopy is the single best way to determine the source, if bleeding is gross but mild, causing melena or small amounts of hematochezia, colonoscopy or a combination of flexible sigmoidoscopy and double-contrast barium enema should be used to evaluate the colon. In most patients with melena, the upper tract must be examined endoscopically. Acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding stops spontaneously in 75 to 90 per cent of patients, permitting preparation of the colon before colonoscopy. If bleeding is continuing, diagnostic options include colonoscopy with no preparation of the colon, relying on the cathartic effect of blood, or a red cell radionuclide scan followed by angiography if the scan is positive. A bleeding lesion seen on angiography is usually treated by infusion of vasopressin. Colonoscopic treatment of a bleeding site uses the BICAP probe, heater probe, or argon laser. Patients who bleed severely and those who do not respond to treatment or rebleed after treatment are candidates for operation. Segmental resection is preferred if the bleeding site is known. If not, total colectomy with ileorectal anastomosis may be necessary. A mortality rate of 10 to 15 per cent in patients with severe bleeding reflects the advanced age of many of these patients and the difficulty of managing gastrointestinal bleeding in the presence of associated medical conditions.\r"

Patients with stage III disease received adjuvant chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and vincristine). Pneumonectomy was undertaken in 75 patients, lobectomy in 21, and wedge resection in one patient. Three patients died within 30 days of operation. The cumulative five year survival of all patients, irrespective of tumour stage, was 17%. The cumulative five year survival was 35% for patients with stage I disease, 23% for stage II, and zero for stage III. The median survival for patients with stage III tumours was 17 months. There was no significant difference in cumulative survival between patients with stage I and II disease. Cumulative survival, however, was significantly better for patients with stage I and II disease than for those with stage III disease. The data suggest that for patients with stage I and stage II disease surgery offers the prospect of long term survival.\r"

The diagnoses determined by biopsy were: tuberculosis (11); carcinoma (12); chronic inflammation (9); and pleural fibrosis (4); one biopsy showed nothing abnormal. In 23 (62%) patients both biopsy needles produced adequate diagnostic material; in eight the Tru-cut needle alone produced diagnostic material and in six the Abrams punch alone. Thus diagnostic material was obtained in 31 patients from the Tru-cut needle and in 29 from the Abrams punch.

A diagnosis of chronic bronchitis was reported by 3.9% of the men and 2.1% of the women, and a diagnosis of asthma by 4.7% of the men and 3.3% of the women. Wheezing in the preceding year was reported by 18% of the men and 15% of the women, and 16.7% of the men and 7.1% of the women satisfied the Medical Research Council criteria for chronic bronchitis. Bronchodilator treatment was being taken by 12% of the patients with symptoms, regular cough linctus by 10%, and regular antibiotics by 5%. After the frequency and severity of respiratory symptoms had been controlled for wheezing patients reporting a diagnosis of asthma were prescribed bronchodilatory drugs three times more often than those labelled as having chronic bronchitis and 12 times more often than those without a diagnostic label. Eleven per cent of general practitioner consultations resulted in a referral to hospital. Referral was unrelated to the diagnosis given, but depended on the degree of respiratory disability and handicap experienced by the patient. Our findings confirm the relevance of the diagnostic label to the drug management of chronic wheezing disorders, but further investigation of the diagnostic process is needed to establish why some patients with severe wheeze remain untreated.\r"

The mean fall in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) between 16.00 and 04.00 hours was 21.9% in group 1 and 2.3% in group 2. Selection of patients was based on the amplitude of change in peak expiratory flow (PEF) measured every four hours for three consecutive days at home. The study was performed in hospital on four consecutive days. Medication was withheld for three days before and during the measurements at home and in hospital. On the first day in hospital (day 4) FEV1 was measured every four hours for 24 hours. On day 6 inhaled histamine provocation tests were performed at the same times as the FEV1 measurements on day 4. Both groups showed a nocturnal fall in the provocative dose of histamine causing a 20% fall in FEV1 (PC20). The mean change in histamine PC20 from 16.00 to 04.00 hours was 1.1 doubling doses of histamine in group 1 and 1.5 doubling doses in group 2. The results indicate that the increase in nocturnal bronchial responsiveness that occurs at night is not due to an increase in airflow obstruction.\r"

Rats exposed to both hypoxia and hypoxia with hypercapnia developed selective right ventricular hypertrophy. Exposure to hypercapnia alone did not alter right ventricular weight. No change in right ventricular papillary muscle contractility per unit muscle mass was observed as measured by maximum active tension, maximum rate of rise or fall of tension, or time to peak tension. Rat cardiac muscle adapts successfully to the altered acid-base environment and increased work load associated with prolonged exposure to hypoxia and mild hypercapnia.\r"

  ".W": "To determine whether patients with chronic airflow limitation have a specific alteration in skeletal muscle performance, the strength and endurance of inspiratory and limb muscles were compared in 11 patients with chronic airflow limitation and 11 control subjects during maximal voluntary contractions. Peak inspiratory pressure at observed functional residual capacity (FRC) was significantly less in the patients than in the control subjects (mean 72 (SD 25) v 93 (21) cm H2O), though only two patients had low maximal pressures across a wide volume range. Maximal voluntary torque of the elbow flexor muscles was also reduced in the patients but the difference was not significant (60 (17) v 72 (18) Nm). During the endurance sequence of 18 maximal voluntary contractions (10 s duration, 5 s rest interval) the decline in peak and average force was less for the inspiratory muscles than for the elbow flexors in both groups. Inspiratory muscle endurance was slightly greater in the patients with chronic airflow limitation than in the control subjects, whereas limb muscle endurance was slightly impaired in the patients. In three patients with chronic airflow limitation, two of whom had low maximal inspiratory pressures at FRC, the ability to drive the diaphragm voluntarily was examined by stimulating the phrenic nerves during maximal inspiratory efforts. Each patient was capable of full activation of the diaphragm during the maximal inspiratory efforts. These results suggest that the relative preservation of inspiratory muscle performance in patients with chronic airflow limitation may be an adaptive response to respiratory \"loading.\"\r"

Five had histologically proved small cell carcinoma of the lung; the sixth later developed metastases from an unknown primary site. Two patients had ventilatory failure, one without respiratory symptoms; another, who had emphysema, had dyspnoea and orthopnoea. The remaining three patients had no respiratory symptoms. Four patients had limb muscle weakness as judged by the maximal voluntary contraction of the quadriceps muscle (range for all subjects 32-100% predicted). Transdiaphragmatic pressure (Pdi) was measured during a maximal unoccluded sniff (Pdi: sniff), a maximal sustained inspiratory effort against a closed airway (Pdi: Pimax), and phrenic nerve stimulation (Pdi: twitch). Mild to moderate diaphragmatic weakness was present in all six patients in proportion to the degree of leg weakness (Pdi: sniff 30-64% predicted; r = 0.6; Pdi:Pimax 6-69% predicted, r = 0.8); this was associated with very low or absent Pdi:twitch during phrenic nerve stimulation. Four patients had weakness of the expiratory muscles. Improvement in muscle strength was documented in two patients after tumour chemotherapy and specific treatment with 3,4-diaminopyridine and prednisolone; one patient was still alive five years from first diagnosis. It is concluded that the respiratory muscles may be implicated in this condition more often than has previously been recognised. As the lack of mobility may cause respiratory symptoms to be minimised, the presence of respiratory muscle weakness may remain undiagnosed unless formal measurement of respiratory muscle function is made.\r"

All but seven patients had asthma, six of the seven being in the group who did not have allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis. The patients with allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis were more often male and had a greater incidence of asthma and an earlier age of onset of asthma than those without aspergillosis. The patients with aspergillosis had lower mean blood eosinophil counts and more episodes of pulmonary eosinophilia and more commonly had radiographic shadowing that suggested fibrosis or bronchiectasis (20 v 7). Pulmonary eosinophilia associated with allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis appears to be a distinct clinical syndrome resulting in greater permanent radiographic abnormality despite lower peripheral blood eosinophil counts.\r"

  ".W": "The acute change in pulmonary artery pressure in response to oxygen may have prognostic value for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease treated with long term domiciliary oxygen. A study was carried out to elucidate the mechanism of the acute cardio-respiratory response to oxygen in such patients and to determine whether it can be quantified non-invasively. The effects of acute oxygen administration (100% for 20 minutes and 28% oxygen for 24 hours) were assessed by non-invasive means and right heart catheterisation in 17 patients with severe stable hypoxaemic chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Measurements included change in the ratio of dead space to tidal volume (VD/VT), effective pulmonary capillary blood flow (by rebreathing and single breath soluble gas uptake: QRB, QSB), left ventricular ejection fraction (radionuclide ventriculography), and M mode echocardiographic estimates of ventricular diameters and fractional shortening. These values were compared with those obtained from right heart catheter measurements of pulmonary artery pressure, cardiac index (thermodilution and direct carbon dioxide Fick: QTD, QFICK), and pulmonary vascular resistance. Oxygen administration resulted in a significant fall in pulmonary artery pressure, QTD, and QRB and a significant increase in VD/VT. The fall in QRB after 100% oxygen breathing for 20 minutes correlated strongly with the fall in pulmonary artery pressure (r = 0.86). There was no correlation between the fall in pulmonary artery pressure and the fall in QSB or the risen in VD/VT. Left ventricular ejection fraction did not change significantly. Echocardiography was technically unsatisfactory because of lung hyperinflation. Apart from a possible relation between VO2max and fall in pulmonary artery pressure after 24 hours of 28% oxygen breathing (r = 0.49, p less than 0.1) none of the baseline respiratory function measurements predicted the fall in pulmonary artery pressure or QRB. It is concluded that the cardiopulmonary response to acute oxygen breathing in patients with hypoxic chronic obstructive pulmonary disease includes a reduction in pulmonary artery pressure and cardiac output and a redistribution of pulmonary blood flow, and that rebreathing measurements of effective pulmonary blood flow can be used to quantify this response non-invasively.\r"

All patients had a forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) less than 50% predicted, an arterial oxygen tension of more than 7.3 kPa, and no severe locomotor, cardiovascular, neurological, or endocrine disorders. Exercise performance was assessed from a 12 minute walking test; body weight (as a percentage of ideal weight), creatinine height index, and serum concentrations of albumin, transferrin, and prealbumin were assessed as measures of nutritional state. Mean values of the nutritional variables were within the normal range. The mean (SD) 12 minute walking distance was 686 (254) metres. Walking distance was positively associated with serum albumin concentration and creatinine height index but not with body weight, serum prealbumin, or serum transferrin concentrations. When patients were categorised into low, medium and high performance groups on the basis of their walking distance, a very low creatinine height index (mean (SD) 59% (19%] was found in the low performance group. Albumin explained part of the variance in walking distance independently of pulmonary function in a stepwise regression analysis. The findings suggest that in patients with chronic airflow obstruction skeletal muscle mass and serum albumin concentration are positively associated with exercise performance as measured with a 12 minute walk.\r"

Exercise tests were performed on a bicycle ergometer after administration of nebulised salbutamol or matched saline placebo. In the asthmatic subjects salbutamol increased the resting FEV1 by 11%. The mean (SD) percentage fall in FEV1 after exercise did not change significantly (salbutamol 9.4 (12.8); placebo 15.0 (8.0], but because the FEV1 before exercise was increased the lowest FEV1 after exercise was also significantly higher after salbutamol than placebo (3.60 (1.13) v 2.85 (0.80) litres). Despite the improvement in FEV1 before exercise there was no significant difference in maximal workload, oxygen uptake, heart rate, or ventilation during exercise after salbutamol compared with placebo in the asthmatic patients. Tidal volume was higher at maximal exercise after salbutamol but there was no change in perception of breathlessness or exertion in the asthmatic subjects. During submaximal progressive exercise the perceived rate of exertion was reduced in the asthmatic patients and oxygen pulse was reduced in both groups owing to a small and non-significant increase in heart rate. The FEV1 and cardiorespiratory response to the progressive maximal exercise test in the non-asthmatic subjects were otherwise unchanged after salbutamol. The results suggest that 5 mg nebulised salbutamol has little effect on the cardiorespiratory responses to progressive maximal exercise in patients with mild asthma and in non-asthmatic subjects. Salbutamol in this dose may reduce the severity of exercise induced asthma, but no ergogenic effect on maximal exercise performance was shown.\r"

There was no difference in the prevalence of asthma, other atopic diseases, family history of atopic diseases, or positive responses to skinprick tests (nine versus five) in the two groups. The prevalence of bronchial hyperreactivity, however, was significantly higher in the group with bronchiectasis than in the control group for both histamine (7 v 0 patients) and methacholine (6 v 0 patients). The group with bronchiectasis had more airflow obstruction (mean FEV1 67% predicted), but there was no correlation between spirometric indices and log PD20 (the log dose of histamine or methacholine causing a 20% fall in FEV1). This suggests that, although reduced airway calibre may be a factor underlying bronchial hyperreactivity in bronchiectasis, it is not the only mechanism. Further studies are needed to determine whether bronchial hyperreactivity has a causative role in the pathogenesis of bronchiectasis or whether it occurs as a result of the disease.\r"

  ".W": "Transbronchial biopsy is the technique of choice for obtaining tissue for histological diagnosis in many pulmonary disorders. The procedure has usually been carried out as an inpatient procedure with the use of fluoroscopy, though this policy has recently been questioned. This report concerns a five year experience of 174 transbronchial biopsies performed without fluoroscopy as an outpatient procedure in patients with interstitial lung disease or a suspicion of sarcoidosis. Chest radiography was carried out only if the patient developed symptoms. No major complications were encountered and the overall complication rate was low. Pneumothorax occurred in six patients (3.4%), only one of whom required intercostal intubation, and bleeding of more than 30 ml occurred in two patients. Histological diagnosis was obtained in 154 patients (88%). In the experience of this group transbronchial biopsy has been safe when carried out as an outpatient procedure without fluoroscopic guidance.\r"

In 17, 24, and 23 patients, respectively, 300 mg/day aspirin, 200 mg/day ticlopidine, and 81 mg/day aspirin plus 100 mg/day ticlopidine were administered orally. Aspirin alone markedly inhibited platelet aggregation induced by arachidonic acid, partially inhibited platelet aggregation induced by adenosine diphosphate, and did not inhibit platelet aggregation induced by platelet activating factor. Ticlopidine alone inhibited platelet aggregation induced by adenosine diphosphate and platelet activating factor, but did not inhibit platelet aggregation induced by arachidonic acid. Combination therapy with aspirin plus ticlopidine markedly inhibited platelet aggregation induced by all three agonists. Plasma concentrations of beta-thromboglobulin and platelet factor 4 remained unchanged by aspirin alone, were slightly reduced by ticlopidine alone, and were markedly reduced by aspirin plus ticlopidine. Plasma concentration of thromboxane B2 was reduced by aspirin alone or with ticlopidine, but not by ticlopidine alone. The level of 6-ketoprostaglandin F1 alpha was reduced only by aspirin alone. Bleeding time was significantly prolonged by aspirin alone and by ticlopidine alone, although the greatest prolongation was produced by aspirin plus ticlopidine. Our results indicate that the combination of aspirin plus ticlopidine is a potent antiplatelet strategy, although the clinical importance of the changes observed need to be determined by a properly designed and controlled prospective study.\r"

Embolic infarction associated with heart disease other than nonvalvular atrial fibrillation was seen in 23 cases (17%), and that from nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis was seen in 15 cases (11%). Thrombotic infarction or infarction of nonembolic cardiac origin was found in only 39 cases (30%). Of 56 patients with fatal massive cerebral infarction who died less than or equal to 2 weeks after their stroke, 25 (45%) had embolic strokes associated with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. Our study shows that nonvalvular atrial fibrillation is a very important cause of fatal massive cerebral infarction in the elderly.\r"

In a quantitative study of 103 patients with cerebrovascular disease, 21 had a free protein S that was less than 20% of the average normal total protein S concentration (normal range 20-40%); 19 had suffered cerebral infarction and the other two had suffered intracranial hemorrhage. The frequency of free protein S deficiency in this group of stroke patients was far higher than the expected prevalence in the general population.\r"

To determine if a shorter course (4 days) of antifibrinolytic treatment before the expected onset of ischemic complications might reduce the rate of rebleeding yet avoid ischemic complications, we prospectively studied a series of 119 patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage; 479 patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage from our previous randomized double-blind study (238 treated with placebo, 241 with long-term tranexamic acid) served as historical control groups. At 3 months' follow-up, the outcome of patients treated with short-term tranexamic acid was not different from that of patients treated with long-term tranexamic acid. The rate of rebleeding (24 of 119, 20%) was near that with placebo (56 of 238, 24%). In contrast, the rate of cerebral infarction (33 of 119, 28%) was almost identical to that after long-term tranexamic acid (59 of 241, 24%), although mortality from cerebral infarction was reduced. Compared with historical control groups, treatment with tranexamic acid for 4 days fails to reduce the incidence of rebleeding but still increases the rate of cerebral infarction.\r"

Compared with two control groups (one comprising 25 elderly patients with various acute medical disorders and the other comprising 33 80-year-old volunteers), stroke patients had higher postdexamethasone cortisol levels (p = 0.08 and p = 0.001, respectively). By multiple regression analysis, high postdexamethasone cortisol levels in the stroke patients were significantly associated with proximity of the lesion to the frontal pole of the brain (p = 0.008) and with disorientation (p = 0.03), whereas no association with major depression was seen. Many stroke patients are exposed to hypercortisolism, which may have negative consequences upon organ functions. The extent to which dexamethasone administration suppresses cortisol levels seems to be determined mainly by the site of brain lesion and cannot be used as an indicator of major depression early after stroke.\r"

Bolus injection or continuous intravenous infusion of uridine 5'-diphosphate 26 hours after a lesion was established had adverse effects, such as increased intracranial pressure and lowered systolic arterial blood pressure and cerebral perfusion pressure for approximately 10-29 minutes, but these parameters did not change appreciably from 29 minutes to 3 hours after administration. Intraperitoneally administered uridine 5'-diphosphate did not affect these parameters appreciably during 3 hours. Thus, the intravenous administration of uridine 5'-diphosphate is harmful under neurosurgical conditions. In contrast, 10 mg/kg/day i.p. uridine 5'-diphosphate pretreatment and posttreatment, beginning 24 hours before and continuing until 24 hours after the insult, significantly reduced neurologic abnormalities, Evans blue extravasation, water content in the injured gray matter, and intracranial pressure without affecting water content in the white matter. Intravenous dexamethasone pretreatment and posttreatment in this setting significantly reduced only neurologic abnormalities. However, there were no significant differences between intraperitoneal uridine 5'-diphosphate and intravenous dexamethasone effects on cold-injured brain.\r"

Reference memory is thought to depend on invariable and working memory on variable spatial information. We assessed the effect of training before ischemia. In Experiment 1, rats trained for 36 trials on 12-arm radial mazes before ischemia demonstrated a persistent impairment on the working memory task but eventually performed the reference memory task comparable to controls. Ischemic rats made more working memory errors as the number of choices increased. This pattern of working memory errors was similar to that in controls except, as expected, ischemic rats made many more errors. In Experiment 2, training for 80 trials before ischemia in rats decreased the severity of both the working and the reference memory impairment. Ischemia did not affect motor behavior in either experiment. These results characterize the working memory deficit in ischemic rats and demonstrate the importance of experimental factors, particularly in the design of treatment strategies to reduce functional impairments caused by ischemia.\r"

  ".W": "Hyperglycemia is associated with three- to fourfold larger infarcts than normoglycemia following permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion in cats. We investigated the effects of glycemia on brain outcome when middle cerebral artery blood flow was restored (clip release) after 4 hours of occlusion. Seven of 13 hyperglycemic (22 mM) and one of 12 normoglycemic (6 mM) anesthetized cats developed total middle cerebral artery territory infarcts and hemispheric edema and died of brainstem compression. The remaining six and 11 cats recovered fully and later showed no or only small infarcts. Compared with permanent occlusion, restoration of blood flow after 4 hours reduced infarct volume in all normoglycemic and hyperglycemic cats that survived, but caused a much higher proportion (54% vs. 17%) of hyperglycemic and, for the first time, one normoglycemic cat, to die of infarct extension, hemorrhagic infarct conversion, and total territory edema. Thus, clip release after 4 hours caused some cats to show reduced and others to show augmented tissue damage. Rendering cats hyperglycemic substantially worsened their outcome after reperfusion by increasing their death rate from total territory edema sevenfold. Our results demonstrate that risk/benefit analyses for recanalization efforts in humans should take serum glucose concentrations into account.\r"

Cerebral blood flow in the parietal cortex and caudate nucleus was measured to determine the lower limit using the hydrogen clearance method. The lower limit in both cerebral regions was significantly higher in 10 untreated spontaneously hypertensive rats than in 10 Wistar-Kyoto rats. The upward-shifted lower limit was restored to close to normal in the caudate nucleus and was partially restored in the parietal cortex of nine rats by 9 weeks of treatment with the high dose (50-68 mg/kg/day) of budralazine, which kept blood pressure constant at approximately normotension during the treatment period; the lower limit was slightly restored in both cerebral regions of seven rats by 4 weeks of treatment with the high dose. However, 9 weeks of treatment with the low dose (19-27 mg/kg/day) of budralazine, which produced moderate continuous hypotension in nine rats, did not apparently influence the lower limit. Our results suggest that long-term antihypertensive therapy with budralazine reduces the upward-shifted lower blood pressure limit of cerebral blood flow autoregulation toward normal and that the restoration induced by budralazine depends on the degree of blood pressure reduction as well as on the duration of the therapeutic period.\r"

Four patients (31%) presented with compressive symptoms and 10 (77%) with ischemic symptoms; one patient presented with both types of symptoms. No patient presented with rupture of the fusiform aneurysm. Based on the attending physician's choice, treatment included antiplatelet therapy in five patients, anticoagulation in seven, and no medication in one. Five patients died, four treated with antiplatelet agents and one not treated with any medication. The cause of death was progressive brainstem ischemia in three, sepsis in one, and gastrointestinal bleeding in one patient. All seven patients who received anticoagulants were alive, with no recurrence of symptoms or hemorrhagic complications after a mean follow-up period of 18 months. Based on previous and current series, we conclude that rupture of fusiform aneurysms is rare. Our results suggest a more favorable outcome in the management of these aneurysms with anticoagulation therapy to prevent progressive thrombosis and embolization.\r"

Incisional pain was completely eliminated in 96 percent of patients. Epidural analgesia diminished pain-related pulmonary complications without sedation. Complications were tolerable and manageable. Hypotension due to sympathetic blockade responds to intravenous fluid administration. Urinary retention is avoidable if the epidural infusion is discontinued prior to removing the urethral catheter. Itching is an undesirable consequence observed by 20 percent of patients when morphine is used.\r"

  ".W": "Twenty-one patients with high-stage transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) of the bladder were treated with a combination of methotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicin (Adriamycin), and cisplatin (M-VAC). There was a minimum follow-up of thirty-six months (range 36-45) in all patients. Patients were divided into three groups: 10 patients with recurrent TCC post radical cystectomy, 6 patients staged as T3/T4 or N1 treated in a neo-adjuvant setting, and 5 patients who received adjuvant M-VAC four weeks post radical cystectomy. The overall initial response rate in patients with measurable disease was 68 percent (11 of 14), complete response rate 31 percent, and partial response rate 37 percent. There was no response in 31 percent. The durability of response in this series was very disappointing with all complete responders having recurrence of disease, with duration of responses ranging from eight to twenty-one months. Of the 5 patients who received M-VAC as adjunctive therapy, only 1 remains disease-free; the other 4 patients experienced disease progression four to seventeen months postoperative, and all have died. There was one drug-associated death due to nadir sepsis, and myelosuppression occurred in 12 patients. While M-VAC seems to be the best protocol currently available, the real durability of response is most disappointing.\r"

We report on the histopathologic changes of bladder transitional cell carcinoma following M-VAC chemotherapy in our protocol for treatment of bladder cancer. The main histopathologic findings after M-VAC therapy are squamous metaplasia, necrosis, fibrosis, and persistent transitional cell carcinoma. In 2 cases, there were persistent adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma. The importance of these observations in terms of diagnostic and therapeutic implications is reviewed.\r"

We performed a retrospective review of 11 consecutive patients who had their resected residual tissue cultured in a soft agar clonogenic assay to determine if there were any biological data that could be obtained in this setting. Twelve assays were performed on the 11 patients. Some colony formation occurred in 10 of the 12 assays, including 4 of 5 assays in which cancer was found and 6 of 7 in which no cancer was found. The rate of colony formation, however, was significantly less for the noncancerous tissues than for the ones with cancer noted (p = 0.019). Three of the patients with cancer are dead, while all of those with benign tissue remain free of disease, with follow-up ranging from three to six years. Our data suggest that clonogenic growth from resected tissue after chemotherapy has the potential to supplement histologic findings, possibly as a predictor of the future biologic behavior of a patient's disease process.\r"

Of the 43 patients (24 men, 19 women), 23 (53 percent) were taking chronic (greater than 2 mo) calcium-channel blocker therapy. Nifedipine 10 mg capsules were chewed and swallowed with repeat doses given at hourly intervals if necessary. Target BP was 140/90 mm Hg, which was achieved in 31 of 43 patients (72 percent). In patients already taking calcium-channel blockers, target BP was achieved in 18 of 23 patients (78 percent). Response in patients not taking chronic calcium-channel blockers was observed in 13 of 20 patients (65 percent). Overall, adverse effects occurred in 16 of 43 patients (37 percent): 11 of 23 patients (48 percent) taking calcium-channel blockers, and 5 of 20 patients (25 percent) not taking calcium-channel blockers. Nifedipine is equally effective in lowering BP in patients taking calcium-channel blockers as it is in patients not taking them. Although associated with a higher incidence of adverse effects in patients already taking calcium-channel blockers, these effects were not considered serious. Nifedipine is an effective agent in acute hypertensive episodes, even in patients receiving chronic calcium-channel blocker therapy.\r"

This study examined prednisolone pharmacokinetics and cortisol suppression in four healthy male volunteers following administration of prednisone 20 mg. Studies were performed with and without ketoconazole 200 mg po for six days. Blood samples were obtained serially over 24 hours and serum prednisone, prednisolone, and cortisol concentrations were determined by HPLC. Prednisolone clearance before and after ketoconazole therapy was not significantly different (160 +/- 38 vs. 148 +/- 23 mL/h/kg). In addition, no significant differences were found in mean residence time (5.03 +/- 0.69 vs. 6.18 +/- 1.77 h), terminal slope (0.23 +/- 0.03 vs. 0.19 +/- 0.05 h-1), or volume of distribution (0.79 +/- 0.11 vs. 0.84 +/- 0.12 L/kg). The ratio of cortisol area under the concentration versus time curve (AUC) 0-24 hours after prednisone administration to the AUC under baseline conditions was used as a measure of adrenal suppression. This ratio was not significantly different after prednisolone with and without ketoconazole (0.40 +/- 0.10 vs. 0.45 +/- 0.03). Renal excretion of prednisone and prednisolone was not significantly changed with ketoconazole. Based on this preliminary study, ketoconazole minimally alters prednisolone clearance in contrast to the significant ketoconazole-methylprednisolone interaction previously reported.\r"

A majority of respondents indicated that they include information on the indication and mode of administration in more than 75 percent of their counseling episodes. However, on average, rare but serious adverse effects were less frequently discussed. The frequency of verbal communication was analyzed according to the pharmacist's gender, number of years since licensure, employment status, work setting, and perceptions of both professional and commercial dimensions of the pharmacist's role. Regression showed that perception of the professional dimension of the role, gender, workload, and floor surface of the pharmacy were related to provision of verbal information on new prescribed medications.\r"

The error variances were controlled to simulate research problems commonly studied by linear regression. The total error of each method was assessed by the absolute value of the bias in the estimate of slope. Whenever differences among methods were observed, the mean of the slope determined by two reciprocal techniques performed as well as or better than orthogonal regression, regression of y upon x, or x upon y. All the methods studied appeared to perform equally well when x and y errors were heteroscedastic or when the data set was small (n = 7). Regression of y upon x was equal or superior to other methods when n = 7 or n = 20 and y and x errors were homoscedastic. When the data set was large (n = 50) and the error in x greater than that in y, the standard method (regression of y upon x) was inferior to all other methods. It is suggested that linear regression by the traditional method of y upon x (a method present in many hand-held calculators) is appropriate in the majority of clinical situations, but when n is large and errors in x are much larger than those in y, orthogonal regression or the averaging method may be preferable.\r"

In 1988, the clinical pharmacy faculties from the four colleges of pharmacy in New England met to discuss the \"Directions for Clinical Pharmacy Education in New England.\" Through a series of workshops, and stimulated by challenges from keynote speakers, the participants focused on the current status of clinical pharmacy education in New England, the barriers to change, and the strategies required to accomplish these changes. Consensus on prioritization of changes and their strategies was reached, and those that could be implemented in the near future were identified. Since the conference, changes have occurred and the professional networking that began at the conference has continued. This paper is a summary of the proceedings of this conference.\r"

The relation between drug action and cardiac excitability, orthodromic/antidromic conduction through Purkinje fibers and ventricular muscle and the restitution of premature action potential duration was studied. Drug classifications were: group A, VFT markedly increased; group B, VFT moderately increased; and group C, no significant change. Group A was subdivided according to presence or absence of the dip phenomenon and supernormal period in the anodal strength-interval curve. Drugs in group A significantly reduced the difference between effective refractory period of orthodromic and antidromic conduction and the range over which the premature action potential duration reappeared. In groups B and C, the effective refractory period in orthodromic conduction was longer than that in controls, and the range of the restitution of premature action potential duration for Purkinje fibers was reduced only slightly.\r"

In contrast to previous reports, the development and recovery from the Vmax blocks of action potentials by disopyramide and lidocaine were best expressed by 2 exponential functions, not 1, suggesting that there might be 2 different processes for the sodium current block. A near-therapeutic concentration (11 microM) of disopyramide depressed Vmax at frequencies of 0.1 to 2.0 Hz decreased action potential amplitude and shortened plateau phase in ventricular myocytes. Action potential duration was prolonged by the drug in most of the preparations but shortened in some. Disopyramide prolonged the refractory period and increased threshold current for excitation. The drug was also shown to depress both the calcium current and the delayed outward potassium current. These multiple actions of disopyramide may explain its variety of antiarrhythmic properties.\r"

  ".W": "The electrophysiologic properties of atrial muscle were studied by programmed atrial stimulation in 42 patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF) and in 53 control patients without PAF. Single premature atrial stimulation was given at the right atrial appendage following 8 basic stimuli with a basic cycle length of 500 ms. Repetitive atrial firing (RAF) was defined as the occurrence of 2 or more successive premature atrial activations following single premature atrial stimulation. Fragmented atrial activity (FAA) was defined as an increase by more than 75% of the duration of the atrial electrogram in response to a single premature stimulation. Interatrial conduction delay was defined as an increase of the conduction time by more than 50 ms in response to a single premature stimulation. RAF was induced in 26 of 42 patients (61.9%) with PAF and in 14 of 53 control patients (26.4%). FAA and interatrial conduction delay were elicited in 69.0 and 80.9% of patients with PAF and in 34.0 and 56.6% of control patients, respectively. In 16 patients with PAF in whom RAF was not induced, FAA developed in 11 patients (68.8%). In 88.1% of 42 patients with PAF and in 41.5% of 53 controls, RAF or FAA, or both, were elicited by atrial premature stimulation. It is concluded that the incidence of RAF and FAA were significantly higher in patients with PAF than in the control group, and the induction of RAF or FAA, or both, was closely related to the vulnerability of the atrial muscle to atrial fibrillation.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of hypoxia and a metabolic inhibitor, sodium cyanide (NaCN), on the spontaneous action potential and membrane current systems were studied in small preparations (0.2 x 0.2 x 0.1 mm) of rabbit atrioventricular node. When the PO2 of the superfusate was lowered from 500 to less than 20 mm Hg, all the preparations initially showed reductions in the spontaneous firing frequency (due to the decreased rate of diastolic depolarization) and maximal rate of depolarization, which were followed by a cessation of automatic activity with subsequent membrane hyperpolarization to -57 +/- 3 mV (n = 4). Voltage clamp experiments using double microelectrode techniques revealed that hypoxia reduced the slow inward current by 20 to 80% without affecting its inactivation kinetics. The delayed rectifying potassium current tail was also reduced or abolished by severe hypoxia, whereas the background outward current was greatly increased. The hyperpolarization-activated inward current was decreased by hypoxia. Similar changes in the spontaneous action potential and membrane currents were obtained on adding 0.1 to 0.5 mM NaCN to the superfusate under conditions of normal PO2. Hypoxia-induced suppression of automaticity was reversed completely by 5 mM glucose, and partially by 40 mM valine. These results suggest that (1) hypoxia impairs atrioventricular nodal conduction by reducing the slow inward current and the delayed rectifying potassium current; (2) hypoxia depresses automaticity by increasing the background outward current and, to some extent, by reducing the slow inward current; and (3) glucose and valine contribute to the generation of high-energy phosphates in cytoplasm and mitochondria, respectively, and protect the atrioventricular node from hypoxia.\r"

Several recent studies have suggested that the arrhythmia may be due to bradycardia-dependent early afterdepolarizations and triggered activity. These drugs produce 2 types of triggered activity, each with a different frequency profile. The possible role of each type in arrhythmia generation is discussed. The existing evidence suggest that drug-induced triggered activity may originate in the Purkinje system. Triggered activity can be abolished or prevented by various interventions that are also effective clinically. The results of studies at the cellular level, when compared with recordings of monophasic action potentials in vivo, suggest a role for early afterdepolarizations in torsades de pointes arrhythmias.\r"

  ".W": "Several electrical stimulation techniques have been used to measure ventricular fibrillation (VF) threshold such as single pulse stimulation, train of pulses stimulation, continuous 50-Hz stimulation and sequential pulse stimulation. This study was undertaken to clarify the difference in VF threshold values obtained by each method. The development of VF was classified into 4 stages. Stage 1 is the phase in which fragmented activities are generated at the stimulated area of the ventricular muscle. In stage 2, the local activities propagate to surrounding ventricular muscle, causing ventricular excitation. Stage 3 is characterized by repetitive ventricular excitations. In state 4, repetitive ventricular responses in a form of accelerating tachycardia induce disorganized excitations that finally degenerate into fibrillation. Based on this classification of stages between local excitation and fibrillation, single pulse stimulation is considered to measure VF threshold for stages 1 to 4, continuous 50-Hz stimulation for stages 2 to 4 and sequential pulse stimulation for stages 3 and 4. Thus, the antifibrillatory effect of drugs can be interpreted with some significance by using different stimulation methods. The sequential pulse stimulation method revealed that some antiarrhythmic agents caused a dissociation between repetitive nonstimulated excitation (RE) threshold and VF threshold. Procainamide and disopyramide increased RE threshold while decreasing VF threshold. Mexiletine and lidocaine elevated both RE and VF thresholds. Local infusion of procainamide at the site of test stimulation reduced both thresholds. However, after the application of procainamide to the whole heart, RE threshold remained decreased but VF threshold was elevated. It is likely that the antifibrillatory effect of the drug includes 2 different processes: antireentrant and antimultiple reentrant effects.\r"

This is particularly important in patients with reduced left ventricular function. In the clinical setting, different compounds have been described to depress cardiac function to a variable extent. The results are not uniform. In an experimental model, the hemodynamic effects of different drugs in the intact circulation as well as under isovolumic conditions in vivo after short cross-clamping of the aorta were tested. The results indicate that all antiarrhythmic compounds with the exception of class III drugs have a similar negative inotropic action on the heart muscle. However, the drugs have different effects on peripheral resistance, thus influencing cardiac afterload. These differences seem to be responsible for the different hemodynamic effects of the drugs observed clinically.\r"

The upper threshold above which the extrasystoles disappear, and the lower threshold below which they are not observed can be defined for longer or shorter periods of recording, and they can vary according to changes in the autonomic nervous system balance. The coupling interval of extrasystoles tends to shorten when the adrenergic drive increases, but is also strongly dependent on the duration of the immediately preceding RR/cycle lengths: the rate dependence and the adrenergic dependence explain why the coupling interval is often slightly variable rather than classically fixed. The complex interactions of these phenomena are more compatible with an underlying mechanism of parasystole, and determine the existence and the importance of repetitive activity following the initial premature beat in many forms of ventricular arrhythmias.\r"
