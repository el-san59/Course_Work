  ".W": "Oviductal damage from infectious salpingitis is a principle cause of ectopic pregnancy. To examine the role of Chlamydia trachomatis in patients with ectopic pregnancy, 24 patients undergoing laparotomy for ectopic pregnancy were evaluated by assessment of chlamydial serology and chlamydial cultures of tubal biopsy specimens. The patients were divided into two groups based on the presence or absence of gross abnormalities in the fallopian tube contralateral to the ectopic gestation. Ten patients in group I showed gross evidence of chronic salpingitis in the contralateral tube; 14 patients in group II had normal-appearing contralateral tubes. Chlamydial cultures were negative in both groups. Chlamydial immunoglobulin M antibodies assayed by indirect microimmunofluorescence were negative in both groups (less than or equal to 1:32). Mean geometric immunoglobulin G titers for C. trachomatis were significantly higher in the patients with evidence of contralateral chronic salpingitis (78.9 versus 13.1). These findings suggest that C. trachomatis may be a major cause of oviductal damage, which predisposes to ectopic pregnancy.\r"

Flow rates of 12 to 35 ml/minute per artery were fully distributed into the organ, with pressure values ranging from 80 to 120 mm Hg. Arteriovenous gradients of oxygen and carbon dioxide tensions as well as the levels of lactate, lactic dehydrogenase, and creatine kinase released in the perfusate, indicators of tissue ischemia or cell necrosis, showed a good preservation of the organ for up to 48 hours. The light- and electron-microscopic examinations of endometrial and myometrial tissues taken before and during perfusion confirmed this result. The extracorporeal perfusion of uteri with buffer containing estrogens plus progesterone exhibited secretive modifications of the proliferative endometrium, thus suggesting the viability of the organ and its responsiveness to sex steroids.\r"

Most patients' infertility was due to tubal disease (n = 8) or pelvic endometriosis (n = 14). The mean number of preovulatory and immature oocytes recovered per laparoscopy was 2.53 +/- 1.73 and 1.57 +/- 1.58, respectively. There were no statistically significant differences between the number of preovulatory and immature oocytes harvested, fertilized, or transferred in this group and the number in patients younger than 40 years of age. No statistically significant differences were observed between peripheral estradiol and progesterone levels in patients 40 years of age or older and levels in patients 39 years of age or younger. There were 15 pregnancies in this group of patients, for a pregnancy rate of 23.4% per stimulated cycle, 27.7% per laparoscopy, and 29.4% per transfer. The ongoing pregnancy rate (12%) was lower, and the total abortion rate (60%) was higher, in patients 40 years of age or older in comparison with patients 39 years of age or younger. Patients 40 years of age or older should be counseled regarding the high abortion rate in this group.\r"

A detailed morphologic study concerning 19 volunteers exposed for 6 to 24 months demonstrated that the overall increase of the mean percentage of abnormally shaped spermatozoa resulted from the percentage increase of elongated, thin, and irregular heads and of bent tails. This increase is probably caused by the rise in environmental testicular temperature induced by AC. A return to baseline values was observed within 12 months after the end of the experiment.\r"

The embryos cultured for 24 hours or longer in protein-free medium demonstrated significantly reduced growth rates. An additional 770 embryos were cultured in BSA-supplemented medium initially and then transferred to human fetal cord serum (HCS)-supplemented medium. Significantly reduced growth rates were observed when transfer from BSA to HCS occurred at 48 hours or earlier, and an increased hatching rate was seen if culture in BSA-supplemented medium continued for up to 57 hours. Another 492 embryos were cultured in HCS-supplemented medium and then transferred to BSA. Significantly reduced growth rates were observed when the transfer occurred at 24 hours or later. HCS was then separated by ultrafiltration (10,000 mol wt cutoff), and 1109 embryos were cultured in the media with BSA, whole HCS, small molecular weight fraction (SMCS), or large molecular weight fraction (LMCS) of HCS or BSA and SMCS. The embryos cultured with SMCS demonstrated a significantly reduced growth rate even if BSA was added in the medium. In summary, it appears that the type and timing of protein supplementation of the culture medium is important to embryo growth. Moreover, it seems that serum contains properties that may even be toxic to embryo survival in vitro.\r"

All patients were followed for at least 18 months of exposure to pregnancy. Cumulative pregnancy rates were determined by life-table analysis. At 30 months, pregnancies resulted in 55% of group I (controls), 71% of group II (MPA), and 46% of group III (danazol). There were no significant differences among these rates. Similarly, there was no significant difference between the cumulative pregnancy rates for stage I (59%) and for stage II (57%). Abortion rates for the various treatment modalities were the following: MPA 6.3%, danazol 11%, and no treatment, 14.3%. The spontaneous abortion rate in stage I and stage II disease was not significantly different. The results of this study suggest that a period of expectant management with correction of other infertility factors may be warranted in patients with mild to moderate endometriosis before medical therapy is contemplated.\r"

In 4 women studied on days 1 and 8 of the same treatment cycle in the luteal phase, a smaller rise in serum P following suppository administration on day 8, compared with day 1, was found. Overall, a highly significant negative correlation between change in serum P from baseline and duration of vaginal suppository treatment was found. This observation does not appear to be related to the achievement of a pharmacokinetic steady state. Possible mechanisms for this observation are discussed.\r"

Preliminary data on eight control patients are presented to establish a normal range of epithelial and stromal lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), beta-hydroxyacyl-CoA-dehydrogenase (beta-OH-acyl-CoA-DH), and citrate synthase (CS) enzyme activities. Significantly higher enzyme activities were found in the epithelial cell type, compared with the stromal cell type for all three enzymes.

Enzyme activities are expressed as moles of substrate reacting per kilogram dry weight per hour (mol/kgD/hour).\r"

There was a major increase in risk beginning in 1982; the incidence almost doubled from 3.5/100,000 in 1970-1981 to 6.6/100,000 in 1982-1984. The pattern of IDDM in the high-risk period was different from that in the low-risk period, with an altered seasonal pattern and unusual increased incidence in younger children. The rapid increase in incidence as well as altered epidemiologic patterns during this period suggest that major alterations of environmental factors were responsible for the change in risk.\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies indicated that protein sparing in skeletal muscle during prolonged starvation depends on the availability of lipid fuels. To test this relationship further, fasted rats conserving protein were treated in vivo for 6-8 h with the antilipolytic agent nicotinic acid (NA) or with tetradecylglycidate (TDGD), an inhibitor of long-chain fatty acid oxidation. After treatment, protein synthesis and degradation in skeletal muscle were evaluated with the perfused rat hindquarter. NA treatment decreased plasma 3-hydroxybutyrate and free fatty acids and increased plasma urea and urine urea excretion, indicating increased breakdown of body protein. TDGD produced similar metabolic effects, except that plasma free fatty acids were markedly increased as a result of inhibition of fatty acid oxidation. NA and TDGD also decreased plasma insulin and increased plasma corticosteroid. Inhibition of lipid metabolism in vivo resulted in accelerated loss of protein from skeletal muscle due to decreased protein synthesis and increased protein breakdown. NA increased both total (i.e., tyrosine release) and myofibrillar (i.e., 3-methylhistidine release) protein breakdown, whereas TDGD increased the breakdown of only nonmyofibrillar proteins (i.e., 3-methylhistidine release by perfused hindquarter was not altered). These data indicate that lipid fuels may directly modulate protein metabolism in muscle during prolonged starvation and may prevent a rise in catabolic hormones. They also indicate that free fatty acids may directly attenuate the breakdown of myofibrillar proteins in muscle during prolonged starvation and that this may be unrelated to their oxidation.\r"

Subjects with diabetes had no overt neuropathy, with R-R variations and postural plasma norepinephrine increments that were similar to those of controls. The diabetic subjects exhibited normal increments in plasma growth hormone (GH), norepinephrine, and cortisol but blunted or absent responses in plasma epinephrine and glucagon when hypoglycemia was severe (less than 40 mg/dl). During a 60-min clamped reduction in plasma glucose at approximately 65 mg/dl, plasma GH and epinephrine increased 6- to 15-fold in controls but 2- to 4-fold in diabetics (P less than .05). However, when subjects were exercised at this plasma glucose level (50 W for 10 min), plasma epinephrine and GH in diabetics rose markedly by 150-400% to attain the peaks reached by the controls. Plasma norepinephrine and cortisol increased to similar levels in both groups, and plasma glucagon was not significantly changed. We conclude that epinephrine and GH secretion in response to hypoglycemia are reduced in type I diabetes but that these defects are stimulus specific because the responses to exercise are not reduced.\r"

Previous data have also suggested that central and upper-body adiposity are relatively uncorrelated and hence may measure different aspects of regional body fat distribution. We assessed body mass index (BMI), the ratio of subscapular-to-triceps skinfold (STR), the ratio of waist-to-hip circumference (WHR), lipids, lipoproteins, and glucose tolerance in 738 Mexican Americans (ages 25-64 yr), who participated in the San Antonio Heart Study, a population-based study of diabetes and cardiovascular risk factors. NIDDM was diagnosed according to National Diabetes Data Group criteria. In general, STR and WHR were associated with high NIDDM rates, low HDL cholesterol levels, and high triglyceride levels, although WHR was somewhat more predictive of these than STR. In females, BMI, WHR, and STR all made independent contributions to prediction of NIDDM and HDL cholesterol; in males, WHR and STR both made independent contributions to prediction of triglyceride levels. This suggests that both indices may measure different aspects of body-fat distribution. Investigators should consider measuring both of these indicators of body-fat distribution in studies of diabetes and other cardiovascular risk factors, although if only a single measure is feasible, WHR appears to be preferable.\r"

Five of 10 IAA-containing sera from insulin-naive nondiabetics that bound whole human (H) insulin did not bind whole porcine (P) or whole bovine (B) insulins. These sera bound H insulin B-chain but not P B-chain or desalanated P insulin, suggesting they were dependent on the presence of threonine B30. The other 5 IAA-containing sera bound H, P, B, and desalanated porcine insulins, but only 1 bound isolated B-chains. All 10 IA-containing sera from insulin-treated diabetics bound H, P, B, and desalanated P insulins, but only 1 bound to human (and porcine) B-chain. Further binding studies with ovine, rabbit, rat, and guinea pig insulins confirmed the H (threonine B30) specificity of the 5 IAA-containing sera. B30 residues do not appear to be dominant, however, when insulin is administered exogenously. Instead, IA bind predominantly to A-chain or conformational determinants involving both chains. Scatchard analysis of a representative H insulin-specific IAA serum suggested that it contained a single binding affinity, whereas analysis of a representative IA-diabetic serum suggested it contained several different affinities.\r"

  ".W": "The effects on renal function of moderate restriction in protein intake were studied in 14- to 20-yr-old type I diabetic patients who had no clinical renal disease or hypertension; matched normal subjects served as controls. After assessment of protein intake and renal function, studies were conducted at the completion of each of two consecutive dietary periods of 1 wk. Diets containing 3.5 and 1.5 g X kg-1 X day-1 protein were provided during the first and second periods, respectively. Baseline protein intakes were substantial in both controls (1.86 g X kg-1 X day-1) and diabetics (2.17 g X kg-1 X day-1). Baseline creatinine clearance was increased in diabetics (P = .043). At the end of the high-protein intake period, both diabetics and controls showed similar high values of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and renal plasma flow (RPF). GFR and RPF decreased markedly (P less than .001) and to a similar degree in both groups after normal protein intake. GFR and RPF in diabetics were not higher than in controls at this point, but filtration fraction was increased in diabetics. Albumin excretion rates were similar in both groups and not influenced by renal function changes. GFR and RPF values correlated significantly with the quantity of protein intake, as estimated from the urea nitrogen appearance rate in both groups. The results suggest that the functional response to variations in protein intake is not altered in the diabetic kidney. In addition, increased renal function in diabetics may be related partly to the excessive protein content in commonly prescribed diabetic diets.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The families of 554 type I (insulin-dependent) diabetics were genetically analyzed according to probands' sex and age at onset applying a modification of Stromgren's method of age correction. Lifetime recurrence risk of type I diabetes (risk up to age 80 yr) for first-degree relatives in three consecutive generations was calculated. The overall risk (+/- 1 SE) for siblings was 6.6 +/- 1.1% and for children was 4.9 +/- 1.7%. The similar risks among siblings and children argue against a simple autosomal recessive trait. The results do not permit a conclusion about a distinct mode of inheritance. Regardless of age at onset, offspring of male probands always had a higher risk than offspring of female probands. Among all probands, fathers were significantly more often affected with type I diabetes (about twice) than mothers (4.1 +/- 0.9 vs. 1.7 +/- 0.6%, respectively). The risk for further siblings of the proband was significantly increased in the presence of a type I diabetic parent (25.2 +/- 10.3 vs. 5.8 +/- 1.0% for remaining probands), indicating a nonrandom clustering type I diabetes in families. Younger age at onset (less than 25 yr) was not associated with an increased risk to siblings. Type II diabetes was not more frequent among parents and siblings of type I diabetics than in the general population. The calculated risk estimates are of practical value in genetic counseling and are important for genetic models concerning type I diabetes.\r"

  ".W": "Alteration of the components of the mixed-function oxidase system, including cytochrome P450, cytochrome b5, cytochrome P450 reductase, and cytochrome b5 reductase, was examined in liver microsomes prepared from needle biopsy samples of 12 patients with intrahepatic cholestasis. The rate of p-nitroanisole O-demethylation in the microsomes was also measured as the activity of cytochrome P450-dependent drug oxidation. The cytochrome P450 content (0.29 +/- 0.05 nmol/mg microsomal protein) in the patients was significantly lower than that in the 11 control subjects (0.41 +/- 0.09). The rate of p-nitroanisole O-demethylation was also significantly lower in the patients. However, the cytochrome b5 content and the activities of the reduced forms of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate- and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide-cytochrome c reductases did not differ between the two groups. Thus, selective reduction of cytochrome P450 seems to play a major role in the impairment of microsomal drug oxidation during intrahepatic cholestasis. Moreover, the reduction of cytochrome P450 was correlated with the serum concentrations of total bilirubin and bile acid but not with the serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase value. These observations suggest that the reduction of cytochrome P450 might be related to the severity of cholestasis.\r"

  ".W": "The pattern of serum bilirubins was determined in serum of humans and rats with unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia due to increased pigment load or defective hepatic conjugation. Bilirubin ester conjugates were present in all serum samples tested and were identified as bilirubin 1-O-acyl glucuronides. In Gilbert's syndrome, the concentration of total conjugates was comparable to the values in healthy control subjects. Because the concentration of unconjugated pigment was increased, the fraction of conjugated relative to total bilirubins was markedly decreased. Sera from patients with Crigler-Najjar disease differed from those with Gilbert's syndrome by the higher unconjugated bilirubin levels and the undetectability of diconjugated bilirubins. A striking finding was that in hemolytic disease, the concentration of both monoconjugates and diconjugates was enhanced in parallel with the increase of unconjugated pigment. Therefore, the fraction of conjugated relative to total bilirubins remained within the normal range. As in Gilbert's syndrome, heterozygote R/APfd-j/+ rats with impaired hepatic bilirubin conjugation exhibit an increased unconjugated bilirubin level in serum, whereas the concentration of total conjugates was comparable to the values in normal rats. In serum of normal rats loaded intraperitoneally with unconjugated bilirubin, both unconjugated and mono- and diconjugated bilirubins were increased in parallel so that the ratio of unconjugated to esterified pigment remained unaffected. Decreased hepatic conjugation or increased bilirubin load was associated with a lower percentage of diconjugates relative to total conjugates both in human and rat serum. The present results are consistent with a compartmental model in which there is bidirectional transfer across the sinusoidal membrane for unconjugated bilirubin as well as for the bilirubin glucuronides. Because typical patterns of serum bilirubins are found in Gilbert's syndrome and patients with hemolytic hyperbilirubinemia, determination of esterified bilirubins in serum is of value to study the pathophysiology and the differential diagnosis of unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia.\r"

This study was undertaken to determine if any clinical, endoscopic, microbiologic, or histologic parameters can be used to make this distinction reliably and quickly. Forty-eight patients with ASLC, 36 patients with chronic ulcerative colitis during their first attack [CUC(F)], and 84 patients with recurrent flares of chronic ulcerative colitis [CUC(R)] were studied prospectively. The presence of fever (temperature greater than 100 degrees F), abdominal pain, or the time from onset of bloody diarrhea to presentation were not discriminatory. Overall clinical and endoscopic severity were identical among the three groups. Microbiologic studies identified an infectious agent in only 42% of patients with ASLC. Histopathologic features always distinguished patients with CUC from those with ASLC. No case of ASLC was misdiagnosed histologically as CUC or vice versa. Plasmacytosis in the lamina propria extending to the mucosal base and mucosal distortion were present in all cases of CUC(F) and CUC(R), but were absent in all cases of ASLC. The finding of focal cryptitis during the resolving phase of ASLC could be confused with similar lesions in biopsy specimens from patients with Crohn's disease and mandates clinical follow-up. Histopathology is thus the only reliable diagnostic tool for the rapid differentiation of ASLC from CUC. However, biopsy specimens are only diagnostic when obtained during the acute phase of illness; that is, usually within the first 4 days from the onset of symptoms.\r"

Subclinical activation of blood coagulation was measured using a radioimmunoassay for fibrinopeptide A. Fibrinopeptide A levels were strongly correlated with the level of disease activity as measured by the Crohn's disease activity index. Patients with active disease who were successfully treated either medically or surgically demonstrated a reduction of fibrinopeptide A levels. Failure of fibrinopeptide A to return to the normal range predicted an early relapse. Monocyte tissue factor generation was assessed in both unstimulated and lipopolysaccharide-stimulated mononuclear cell cultures obtained from the peripheral blood of patients with Crohn's disease. A strong correlation (r = 0.89) was observed between plasma fibrinopeptide A levels and monocyte tissue factor generation. These results suggest that monocyte procoagulant generation may contribute to the activation of blood coagulation in this inflammatory bowel disease. Moreover, fibrinopeptide A levels in Crohn's disease may provide a useful quantitative measure of inflammatory activity.\r"

Within 2 days after benzalkonium chloride treatment, there was a 40% reduction in the activity of choline acetyltransferase, a specific marker for cholinergic neurons, and a 25% reduction in the amount of vasoactive intestinal peptide per centimeter length of jejunum. By 15 days, levels were comparable to those in control segments, and by 45 days after myenteric neuronal ablation, levels in treated tissues were twice those in controls. In contrast, we observed no reduction in the amount of leucine-enkephalin per centimeter length of jejunum at early times after benzalkonium chloride treatment, although by 45 days, levels of this neurotransmitter in treated segments of jejunum were more than twice those in controls. Significant increases in muscle thickness and tissue weight were also observed at 15, 30, and 45 days after myenteric neuronal ablation. Thus we have observed that in response to chemical ablation of myenteric neurons in the rat jejunum, there is a thickening of the smooth muscle layers and a compensatory increase in the production of certain neurotransmitters by the surviving neuronal elements in the gut.\r"

Over the range of submaximal to maximal concentrations of secretagogues, discharge of exocrine proteins in vitro into the incubation medium and in vivo into the pancreatic duct increased and morphologic analysis indicated that exocytosis of zymogen granules occurred exclusively at the luminal membrane. Under in vivo conditions, supramaximal stimulation with caerulein or carbamylcholine resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in amylase release into the pancreatic duct and increase in the appearance of amylase in the blood circulation. Under in vitro or in vivo conditions, supramaximal secretagogue stimulation resulted in marked inhibition of exocytotic activity at the luminal plasma membrane, the appearance of intergranule contacts and fusions within the cytoplasm, and the appearance of exocytotic activity at the lateral plasma membrane. Lateral exocytotic images were observed with individual and fused zymogen granules and autophagic vacuoles. This redirection in the final step of the secretory pathway provides in part the biological basis for the increased appearance of pancreatic (pro)enzymes in the interstitial fluid and serum during supramaximal secretagogue stimulation.\r"

This study examined the importance of specific dietary components in the etiology of this enhanced toxicity. Rats were given their respective diets for 7 days, whereupon methotrexate (20 mg/kg) was given intraperitoneally, and percent of survivors was recorded. Varying the concentration of carbohydrate as polysaccharide (0%, 50%, 100%) (n = 30) had no effect on survival. An increase in the percent of protein as polypeptide (0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 100%) (n = 50) in the elemental diet resulted in a progressively significant increase in percent survival. Addition of either fat or bulk to this elemental diet had no effect on survivorship. Serum and bile methotrexate levels of rats fed an elemental liquid diet (whether or not all of the protein was provided as polypeptide) were significantly increased from 12 to 72 h (p less than 0.03) compared with rats fed a regular Chow diet. When the protein content of the elemental liquid diet was provided as 100% polypeptide, serum and bile methotrexate levels were significantly lower at 48 h compared with the elemental diet group given 100% of protein as amino acid. Administration of methotrexate to rats fed an elemental liquid diet in which all of the protein is provided as amino acids is extremely toxic to the gastrointestinal tract, probably as a result of delayed clearance of the drug from the systemic circulation and from bile. This toxicity is alleviated by the provision of protein as polypeptide in the elemental diet. No toxicity to the drug is seen at this dose in rats fed a regular Chow diet. If these results are applicable to humans, the use of elemental liquid diets as the only source of enteral nutrition would appear contraindicated in patients receiving methotrexate.\r"

  ".W": "Electrical stimulation of the mucosal innervation of the guinea pig ileum results in an increase in chloride secretion that is mediated in part by excitation of muscarinic cholinergic receptors on enterocytes. This study investigated the involvement of vasoactive intestinal peptide in the cholinergic and noncholinergic phases of the secretory response evoked by electrical stimulation of submucosal neurons in the guinea pig ileum. Flat sheets of ileum set up in Ussing flux chambers responded to exogenous vasoactive intestinal peptide by an increase in baseline short-circuit current which was reduced by furosemide and by vasoactive intestinal peptide antiserum. When submucosal neurons were electrically stimulated, a biphasic change in short-circuit current was evoked. Vasoactive intestinal peptide, forskolin, and isobutylmethylxanthine enhanced the cholinergic portion of the response, whereas the antiserum prevented or reduced the effects of the peptide but not of forskolin. In the presence of atropine to eliminate the cholinergically mediated response, vasoactive intestinal peptide reduced the noncholinergic phase of the response and its action was prevented by the antiserum. Vasoactive intestinal peptide enhanced the increase in short-circuit current evoked by the muscarinic agonist bethanechol. These results demonstrate that vasoactive intestinal peptide and other substances that stimulate secretion by increasing cyclic 3',5'-adenosine monophosphate levels in enterocytes potentiate the calcium-dependent, cholinergic phase of the chloride secretory response evoked by neural stimulation of the guinea pig ileum. No evidence was found for vasoactive intestinal peptide as the mediator of the noncholinergic phase of the response.\r"

Esophageal samples were collected for 30 min in the fasting state and for 3 h (as hourly samples) after the ingestion of a test meal (egg salad sandwich, peaches, and milk). Bile acids were assayed by a standard enzymatic assay and also by a sensitive and specific assay, liquid secondary ion mass spectrometry. Bile acids were not detected by enzymatic assay in any of the fasting samples. In 6 of the 8 normal subjects and 15 of the 16 patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease, bile acid-like reactivity was detected by the enzymatic assay in postprandial samples. However, bile acid-like reactivity was also found by enzymatic assay in aliquots of the homogenized test meal in concentration similar to the highest concentrations detected in esophageal aspirates. Bile acids were not detected by the liquid secondary ion mass spectrometry method in any of the fasting or postprandial esophageal aspirates (limit of detection greater than 2 microM). However, this assay accurately identified samples to which exogenous bile acids were added as controls. Our results suggest that bile acids did not reflux into the esophagus of patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease whom we studied and caution must be exercised in the use of enzymatic assay for bile acids in postprandial gastrointestinal fluids, as the commonly used hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase assay is not specific for bile acids alone.\r"

In the strips of the lesser curvature, CCK-OP produced a concentration-dependent tonic contraction, which was significantly reduced by atropine, but not by tetrodotoxin. In contrast, CCK-OP caused a relaxation of the preparation of the greater curvature in a concentration-dependent manner. The relaxation induced by the peptide was enhanced by atropine, whereas it was blocked by tetrodotoxin. Propranolol, phentolamine, desensitization to adenosine-5'-triphosphate, and desensitization to vasoactive intestinal polypeptide had no effect on CCK-OP-induced relaxation. Cholecystokinin-octapeptide evoked the release of acetylcholine from strips of both sides, and it was not blocked by tetrodotoxin. These findings indicate that the mechanism of action of CCK-OP on the lesser curvature differs from that on the greater curvature. The peptide seems to act directly on smooth muscle cells and to stimulate cholinergic neural activity by sodium channel-independent mechanisms. Additionally, nonadrenergic inhibitory neurons appear to be activated by CCK-OP in the greater curvature.\r"

Breath H2 increased well above that observed in fasting subjects after ingestion of 100 g of carbohydrate in oats, whole wheat, potatoes, corn, and baked beans. Rice caused only a minimal increase in H2 excretion and hamburger was associated with no increase. We estimated the malabsorption of fermentable material by comparing the H2 excretion for 9 h after ingestion of various complex carbohydrates with that after 10 g of lactulose. The mean malabsorption of fermented material after 100-g carbohydrate meals was 20 g for baked beans; 7-10 g for wheat, oats, potatoes, and corn; and 0.9 g for rice. Whole oats or whole wheat resulted in 2-5 times more H2 than did the refined flours. As purified fiber appeared to be a poor substrate for H2 production by fecal homogenates, we conclude that most complex carbohydrates, with the exception of rice, contain a good deal of fermentable material that escapes small bowel absorption and it seems likely that this fermentable material is malabsorbed starch.\r"

Lipoprotein composition was characterized by normal apoproteins, high phospholipids, and low cholesterol. Increased triglycerides were present in low-density lipoproteins. Immunoperoxidase localization of apolipoprotein B on fasting biopsy specimens showed increased staining of the lipid-laden intestinal epithelial cells compared to normals. On electron microscopy after a fat load, the enterocytes contained large numbers of fat particles vesiculating the endoplasmic reticulum. These particles, morphologically similar to chylomicrons, were also present as aggregates of well-individualized lipid droplets within dilated vesicles in the Golgi zone, but were not seen in the intercellular spaces and lacteals. This recessively transmitted condition differs from abetalipoproteinemia and from the homozygous form of hypobetalipoproteinemia and may be caused by a defect in the final assembly of chylomicrons or in the mechanism of their exocytosis.\r"

Collagen synthesis increased during the first 15 days in culture at a time when the rate of cell proliferation was maximal. When confluent, these cells produced significantly more collagen than human dermal fibroblasts cultured under identical conditions. The smooth muscle cells required daily replenishment of ascorbate for maximal collagen synthesis. The types of collagen produced by human intestinal smooth muscle cells in culture were the same as those collagens extracted from strictured human bowel (types I, III, and V). These findings suggest that collagen production by human intestinal smooth muscle cells has a role in the repair as well as the fibrosis of the gastrointestinal tract.\r"

In vitro, stimulation of gastrin release by acetylcholine was slightly enhanced after 1 day of treatment but no further effects were observed compared to placebo controls. Four weeks of treatment evoked marked gastrin hypersecretion, which was atropine-resistant. Stimulation of gastrin release was inversely correlated to enhancement of basal gastrin levels. Chronic achlorhydria distinctly reduced somatostatin responses to isoproterenol, whereas potent stimulation was observed in controls. Treatment with BY 308 for 1 wk was associated with fully developed gastrin hypersecretion but isoproterenol-stimulated somatostatin release was still unaffected. Hypergastrinemia accompanied by increased antral gastrin and reduced antral and fundic somatostatin concentrations was also found in vivo after 4 wk of treatment with BY 308. It is concluded that chronic achlorhydria not only enhances storage and secretion of gastrin but also diminishes the secretion and tissue stores of somatostatin; adaptive changes of the somatostatin cell occur, however, with a much longer delay.\r"

Three patterns of abnormal motility were observed in 68% of the patients: (a) isolated anal sphincter dysfunction (20%), (b) a generalized disorder of gastrointestinal motility (24%), and (c) rectosigmoid dysfunction (24%). The remaining patients had either a previously unrecognized primary disorder leading to constipation or the irritable bowel syndrome. Duration of symptoms, laxative usage, or other historical features failed to distinguish each of the groups. Anal sphincter dysfunction was diagnosed by demonstrating impaired sphincter relaxation during rectal distention. Generalized motor disorders were diagnosed by demonstrating impaired colonic and esophageal function together with an abnormality in gastric emptying. Rectosigmoid dysfunction was manifest by an impaired rectosigmoid motor response to feeding without evidence of other organ dysfunction. These studies indicate that a high percentage of patients with more severe degrees of constipation have a serious but sometimes treatable disorder of bowel function, rather than the irritable bowel syndrome.\r"

We determined the dose-response relationships of pentagastrin for gastric and pancreatic secretion. Doses that stimulated gastric and pancreatic secretion were given every 8 h for 3 or 5 days; trophic responses of pancreas, oxyntic gland area, duodenum, and colon were compared. Interaction of secretin and pentagastrin on pancreatic growth was measured after 5 days of treatment. Pentagastrin was 250 times less potent for stimulation of pancreatic versus gastric secretion. A submaximal dose of pentagastrin for stimulating pancreatic enzyme secretion doubled pancreatic deoxyribonucleic acid synthesis after 3 days. Pentagastrin caused dose-related increases in pancreatic weight after 3 and 5 days. Pentagastrin had no effect on weight, deoxyribonucleic acid synthesis, or deoxyribonucleic acid content of oxyntic gland area, duodenum, or colon. Secretin had additive effects on pentagastrin-induced pancreatic growth. The pancreas appears to be more sensitive than other organs to trophic effects of pentagastrin. Secretin has additive rather than inhibitory effects on pentagastrin-induced pancreatic growth.\r"

Nineteen slow-growing (Runyon groups I and III) and 17 rapid-growing (Runyon group IV) mycobacterial isolates were obtained. Slow-growing mycobacteria were recovered from approximately one-third of intestinal biopsy specimens from Crohn's disease, one-quarter of ulcerative colitis biopsies, and 40% of biopsies from noninflammatory bowel disease patients. Isolates were most commonly members of the Mycobacterium avium-complex. One isolate (from an ulcerative colitis patient) was biochemically similar to the Mycobacterium strain previously associated with Crohn's disease, and one from a Crohn's disease patient was Mycobacterium kansasii. The rapid-growing organisms were members of the Mycobacterium fortuitum-complex. In addition to conventional mycobacteria, spheroplasts (cell wall-defective forms) were isolated from 12 patients with Crohn's disease (most often from surgically resected colon) and 3 patients with ulcerative colitis; none were isolated from non-inflammatory bowel disease patients. We have been unable to identify a consistent relationship between the presence, or the species, of Mycobacterium and Crohn's disease. Our results do not support the proposed role of a specific mycobacterium in the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease. The cause of Crohn's disease remains unclear.\r"

These were compared with peptide distributions in pyloric samples from unaffected infants and adults. In the normal pylorus the circular muscle was richly supplied with fibers reactive for enkephalin, neuropeptide Y, substance P, and vasoactive intestinal peptide. In pyloric stenosis, these immunoreactive fiber bundles were either missing or less than 5% of normal. In contrast, there were reactive cell bodies and nerve fibers in the myenteric plexuses of both normal and affected specimens. In the samples from cases of stenosis, swollen nerve fibers that appeared to be in the process of degeneration were frequently encountered. It is concluded that infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis is associated with a loss of peptide immunoreactivity in nerve fibers in the circular muscle, although the same peptides are still revealed in fibers and in nerve cell bodies in the myenteric plexus.\r"

  ".W": "Using a specific radioimmunoassay for cholecystokinin (CCK) we have studied the relation between circulating CCK concentrations and the feedback regulation of pancreatic enzyme secretion in conscious rats. Recirculation of diverted bile-pancreatic juice into the duodenum or intraduodenal perfusion of trypsin during biliary-pancreatic juice diversion produced basal output of amylase and trypsin and low portal CCK levels (less than 10 pmol/L). Biliary-pancreatic juice diversion or inactivation of trypsin caused increased CCK concentrations (peak values 50-100 pmol/L) and enzyme outputs. During biliary-pancreatic juice diversion, infusion of the CCK receptor antagonist proglumide suppressed the enzyme response without altering the increase in CCK. Measurement of portal and peripheral CCK during biliary-pancreatic juice diversion yielded values of 131 +/- 37 and 32 +/- 5 pmol/L, respectively. The peripheral CCK levels corresponded to concentrations achieved during exogenous CCK-8 infusion which resulted in similar enzyme outputs. Gel chromatography of portal plasma during diversion of biliary-pancreatic juice revealed one peak of CCK corresponding to CCK-8, and a larger peak eluted between CCK-33 and CCK-8, probably representing CCK-22. Similar CCK components were found in water extracts of jejunal mucosa, whereas the acetic acid extracts mainly contained CCK-33/39. We conclude that the negative feedback regulation of pancreatic enzyme secretion in rats is mediated by the release of CCK from the intestine and that the major molecular form of CCK in plasma is probably CCK-22.\r"

Moreover, the influence that the gastric emptying rate may have on patterns of reflux during the day or night, as well as on esophagitis, is not known. In this study, we compared the gastric emptying rate of solid food (in vivo intracellular labeled chicken liver) observed in asymptomatic control volunteers (n = 15) with that of symptomatic patients with an abnormal 24-h pH record who had either the presence (n = 22) or absence (n = 11) of endoscopic esophagitis. We found no significant difference in the gastric emptying rate between the asymptomatic control volunteers and the symptomatic patients with and without esophagitis. Moreover, there was no significant correlation between the gastric emptying rate and the degree of daytime or nighttime distal esophageal acid exposure found during 24-h intraesophageal pH monitoring. Only 6% of the symptomatic patients had a gastric emptying rate that exceeded the mean value plus 2 SD of that found in the asymptomatic control volunteers. We believe these support a de-emphasis of the role that delayed gastric emptying of solid food may play in the pathophysiology of gastroesophageal reflux in most patients.\r"

In this study we used a modified sleeve device to record upper esophageal sphincter pressure continuously in 8 normal volunteers. Intraesophageal pH and electroencephalogram activity were also recorded to document the occurrence of spontaneous gastroesophageal reflux and sleep. After an hour of baseline recording, the subjects ate a meal. Recording was then resumed for an additional 7 h during which period the subjects slept part of the time. The mean upper esophageal sphincter pressure was measured for each 10-min epoch. Electroencephalogram recordings were read blindly for the presence and stage of sleep. Periods of sleep were then correlated with the manometric tracings. Mean upper esophageal sphincter pressure during wakefulness, stage 1 sleep, and deeper sleep was 40 +/- 17 (SD), 20 +/- 17, and 8 +/- 3 mmHg, respectively. A significant change in upper esophageal sphincter pressure did not occur postprandially or during episodes of spontaneous gastroesophageal reflux. Upper esophageal sphincter pressure was observed to increase transiently with each inspiration during periods of restfulness and sleep, a response consistent with the hypothesis that one function of the upper esophageal sphincter is to exclude air from the esophagus during respiration. The demonstration that upper esophageal sphincter pressure falls markedly during sleep may have significance in that this diminishes the barrier to nocturnal regurgitation and potential aspiration.\r"

Motility was determined by two methods: myoelectric activity was monitored with indwelling bipolar electrodes, and intestinal transit was measured by the movement of radiochromium (Na51CrO4). Only the animals injected with the two higher doses had two distinct patterns of altered intestinal myoelectric activity within 2 h of drug administration. The first alteration occurred 44 +/- 6 min after vincristine administration and consisted of a marked increase in action potential activity with disruption of the migrating myoelectric complex. The second alteration consisted of a reappearance of the activity front of the migrating myoelectric complex with a significantly shorter periodicity. A marked reduction in spike activity occurred 3 days after vincristine injection in 3 of 10 animals receiving vincristine. A biphasic response was noted in intestinal transit. Disrupted activity front formation was associated with a significant delay in small bowel transit. In contrast, frequent activity front formation in rats was associated with significantly hastened transit. In summary, vincristine administration induces alterations of myoelectric activity of the small intestine in fasted rats and is associated with changes in intestinal transit.\r"

Immunoglobulin G and immunoglobulin M antibodies to cow's milk proteins were significantly elevated in patients with inflammatory bowel disease as compared to controls. In contrast, no significant increase in immunoglobulin A antibodies to 3 of 5 proteins was noted. The increased titers of antibodies to milk proteins seem to be specific and not due to a polyclonal immunoglobulin activation, as naturally occurring blood group antibodies were not elevated in patients with ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. A good correlation of disease activity, as measured by serum alpha 1-acid glycoprotein concentrations, and immunoglobulin G and immunoglobulin A antibody titers against certain cow's milk proteins could be demonstrated in Crohn's disease, but not ulcerative colitis. These findings suggest that production of antibodies to cow's milk proteins reflects specific immunization with these antigens. The study of antibody isotypes and correlation with disease activity may provide better insight into the immune response to dietary antigens and its possible role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel diseases.\r"

Patients had markedly increased fecal carbohydrate excretion, up to 65% of dietary carbohydrate intake. When the diet contained oligosaccharides, measures of total reducing substance greatly underestimated fecal carbohydrate excretion and were unreliable for quantitation. Stool weight correlated with total fecal carbohydrate excretion and with total reducing substance (r = 0.79, p less than 0.001). Multiple balance studies in 2 patients suggested a relationship between both the amount and type of dietary carbohydrate and fecal carbohydrate excretion.

Neural stimulation caused chloride secretion in cecum, reduced chloride absorption in sigmoid colon, but caused no change in transverse colon; sodium absorption decreased in cecum. A neurotransmitter of unknown identity affects baseline short circuit current in sigmoid colon. Half of the increase in short circuit caused by neural stimulation in sigmoid colon is mediated by muscarinic receptors. The identity of the other transmitter(s) is not known.

A decrease in gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, alkaline phosphatase, lactase, sucrase, and glucoamylase activities was observed in the explants cultured in the presence of ovalbumin. In contrast, a large increase of those enzymatic activities was noted in the culture media, the overall effect observed being a net stimulation of the total enzymatic activities of the culture system. The enzymes accumulated in the particulate fraction of the medium (brush border membrane fraction) suggesting an increased turnover of membrane components by a process of shedding or microvesiculation. This model serves as a useful tool in evaluating the local response of the small bowel mucosa induced by a specific protein.\r"

We have further investigated cholesterol synthesis in coeliac disease by determining the concentrations of faecal steroids and cholesterol precursors in serum, with and without a gluten free diet and while taking cholestyramine. The levels of unesterified methyl sterols and free and esterified lathosterol, but not those of squalene and desmosterol, were increased in proportion to the level of cholesterol synthesis, as measured with the sterol balance technique. Serum esterified methyl sterol concentrations were also slightly higher but, unlike free methyl sterols or lathosterol, they were not significantly correlated with cholesterol synthesis. The gluten free diet decreased the level of cholesterol synthesis, and the levels of lathosterol and free methyl sterols. There was less decrease in the concentration of esterified methyl sterols, and an insignificant decrease in the concentrations of squalene and desmosterol. Cholestyramine lowered the serum cholesterol concentration and increased that of serum free methyl sterols less in the patients than in the controls, and the increase was proportionate to increase of cholesterol elimination (or synthesis). The increase of serum free methyl sterols per unit of the increase of cholesterol elimination (or synthesis) was three times higher in the bile acid malabsorption caused by cholestyramine than in the cholesterol malabsorption caused by gluten enteropathy. On the other hand, the decrease in the level of serum cholesterol relative to the increase in cholesterol elimination (or synthesis) was higher in cholesterol malabsorption due to coeliac disease than in cholestyramine induced bile acid malabsorption.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Damage to the colonic surface was monitored with light microscopy, transmission and scanning electron microscopy and with measurements of deoxyribonucleic acid and carbohydrate in the perfusate. New scoring techniques for monitoring alterations in surface epithelium of light microscopy sections were used. The damaging effect of 5 mM deoxycholic acid to the colonic epithelium is inhibited by lowering the pH of the perfusion fluid from 7.9 to 5.5, or by increasing the calcium concentration from 0 to 4 mM. This inhibition is shown to be because of a decreased amount of bile acid in solution. Thus it is not the total concentration of deoxycholic acid in the colon that is responsible for the colonic damage, but the concentration in solution. Although extrapolation to the human situation must be made with caution, the concentration of bile acid in solution in the faecal water may be more relevant to colonic mucosal damage than total bile acid concentration.\r"

The range was of log normal distribution and declined with age (p less than 0.05). Acceptable 'within-day' and 'between-day' reproducibility was found. All patients tested with untreated coeliac disease, pancreatic insufficiency and most with symptomatic small intestinal Crohn's disease had subnormal values. Twenty per cent of those with irritable bowel syndrome had subnormal values. Patients with ulcerative colitis were all normal. The reagents used and the breath samples after collection were stable. In our experience the 14C triolein test is simple, inexpensive, and helpful in the detection of diseases associated with fat malabsorption. It is of value in monitoring the response to treatment of individual patients with coeliac disease.\r"

In addition, greater seroreactivity to M paratuberculosis has been reported in patients with Crohn's disease. In the present study, we have evaluated the serum antibody response to disrupted M paratuberculosis using ELISA and serum specimens from 33 people with Crohn's disease, 21 with ulcerative colitis, and 12 non-inflammatory bowel disease controls. We failed to find a consistent IgG, IgM, or IgA antibody response to Mycobacterium paratuberculosis. The results indicate that, as in bovine paratuberculosis, serum seroreactivity is not a reliable tool for examining the relationship between human intestinal disease and mycobacteria.\r"

The ability of this test to determine steatorrhoea of pancreatic origin, and its relationship to a wide range of exocrine pancreatic function were assessed. Serum trypsinogen was measured in 32 children with steatorrhoea, 10 with pancreatic and 22 with non-pancreatic causes. In patients with pancreatic steatorrhoea, serum cationic trypsinogen was 4.9 +/- 4.9 micrograms/l (mean +/- SD), significantly below values in patients with non-pancreatic steatorrhoea (47.0 +/- 22.1 micrograms/l, p less than 0.001) and 50 control subjects (31.4 +/- 7.4 micrograms/l, p less than 0.001). Serum cationic trypsinogen values in patients with pancreatic steatorrhoea all fell below the lower limit of our control range and below all values for patients with non-pancreatic steatorrhoea. Serum cationic trypsinogen was also evaluated against pancreatic trypsin output in 47 patients (range 0.2-17.0 yr who underwent a hormonal pancreatic stimulation test. In 17 patients, serum cationic trypsinogen was low (less than -2SD or less than 16.6 micrograms/l), and associated with greatly impaired pancreatic trypsin output, ranging from 0-8% of mean normal trypsin output. Five of these 17 patients did not have steatorrhoea. In 30 patients with normal or raised serum cationic trypsinogen (greater than or equal to 16.6 micrograms/l), pancreatic trypsin output ranged from 15-183% of mean normal values. In conclusion, low serum cationic trypsinogen suggests severely impaired exocrine pancreatic function, with sensitivity extending above the steatorrhoeic threshold. In the presence of steatorrhoea, low serum cationic trypsinogen indicates a pancreatic aetiology.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In contrast, both male and female mortality from gastric and duodenal ulcer were highest in those born around 1875-1885. From the lack of coincidence in the trends of peptic ulcer mortality and cumulative cigarette consumption it is concluded that changing smoking habits were not responsible for the birth cohort patterns of the death rates from gastric and duodenal ulcer.\r"

Pruritus was significantly less common in men than in women both at diagnosis and throughout the period of follow up (p less than 0.01). The difference in incidence of pruritus at diagnosis was most evident when the male group were compared with a group of premenopausal women, an observation which is consistent with involvement of sex steroid metabolism in the origin of pruritus. Skin pigmentation was also less marked in men at diagnosis (p less than 0.05). Autoimmune associated conditions, especially sicca syndrome, were more common in women. Survival was similar among men and women although hepatoma developed significantly more frequently in male patients (p less than 0.01).\r"

Lethargy and anorexia (70%) jaundice (56%) and abdominal pain (48%) were the commonest symptoms and less common were intellectual deterioration (22%) and recurrent epistaxes (22%). The duration of symptoms before diagnosis ranged from five days to three years (mean 10.5 months) and in only five of the patients was the diagnosis established before referral. Analysis of the physical signs at presentation showed hepatomegaly (81%) and splenomegaly (70%) to be common and the only signs which were significantly more common in the 13 fatal cases were jaundice and ascites. In three of these and in one other patient who survived the clinical course was exceptionally severe and was indistinguishable from fulminant hepatic failure. Based on the severity of abnormality of serum aspartate aminotransferase, bilirubin, and prothrombin time on admission a prognostic index was derived which enabled complete separation of fatal and nonfatal cases and when subsequently used in a further nine index cases correctly predicted the outcome. Two further cases found to have indices in the fatal category did well after liver transplantation, which needs to be considered as soon as the diagnosis is established in cases with such severe liver damage.\r"

Measurements were performed in baseline conditions and after the blind administration of metoclopramide (20 mg i.v.) (12 patients), domperidone (10 mg i.v.) (12 patients) and placebo (9 patients). Both metoclopramide and domperidone caused a significant reduction of azygos blood flow, that decreased by 11.5% (p less than 0.01) and 15.6% (p less than 0.02) respectively, while no change was observed in patients receiving placebo (+1.4%, not statistically significant). Reduction of azygos blood flow represents a selective effect of metoclopramide and domperidone on the esophageal circulation, since portal pressure, hepatic blood flow, cardiac output, heart rate and arterial blood pressure were unchanged by the administration of metoclopramide, domperidone or placebo. These results indicate that the administration of drugs that increase the lower esophageal sphincter pressure may reduce the inflow of blood into the esophageal varices in cirrhotic patients with portal hypertension.\r"

After 2 to 3 years of oral or parenteral vitamin E therapy, there was no improvement in fecal fat losses, severity of vitamin E malabsorption (as measured by an oral vitamin E tolerance test) or total serum fatty acid concentrations. Serial analyses of liver function blood tests demonstrated a marked decline in fasting serum cholylglycine concentrations during 18 to 31 months of vitamin E therapy, while other liver function tests showed no consistent changes. We conclude that vitamin E deficiency does not appear to alter intestinal absorption of fat or vitamin E; however, vitamin E deficiency may further impair already compromised hepatic function during pathologic conditions such as cholestasis.\r"

  ".W": "The clinical and pathologic findings in 12 patients with medium-chain acyl CoA dehydrogenase deficiency and three patients with long-chain acyl CoA dehydrogenase deficiency are summarized. Although these inborn errors of intramitochondrial beta-oxidation of fatty acids present with similar findings to Reye's syndrome, there are clinical, laboratory and hepatic histologic differences. Younger age at presentation, history of unexplained sibling death, a previous episode of lethargy, hypoglycemia or acidosis precipitated by fasting stress and only mildly elevated serum transaminases with normal or only mildly prolonged prothrombin time may all suggest an acyl CoA dehydrogenase deficiency. Long-chain acyl CoA dehydrogenase deficiency is differentiated from medium-chain acyl CoA dehydrogenase deficiency by younger age at presentation, more profound cardiorespiratory depression, evidence of cardiomyopathy, and sequelae of muscle weakness, hypotonia and developmental delay. Definitive diagnosis is made by assay of medium-chain or long-chain enzyme activity in cultured skin fibroblasts or in leukocytes. Hepatic light microscopic alterations are essentially limited to steatosis, which may be either macro- or microvesicular. The cases with microvesicular steatosis can be differentiated morphologically from Reye's syndrome by electron microscopy, showing the absence of the mitochondrial changes characteristic of Reye's. Four of seven cases of acyl CoA dehydrogenase deficiency showed some variations from normal in the appearance of the hepatocyte mitochondria. The relationship of these variations to the basic metabolic defect(s) remains to be determined.\r"

  ".W": "Twenty-nine patients with a positive antimitochondrial antibody titer greater than or equal to 1/40, who were detected during screening for other autoimmune disease, are described who had a normal serum bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase and transaminase and who had no symptoms of liver disease at presentation. Liver biopsies in 12 of the 29 fulfilled diagnostic criteria for primary biliary cirrhosis; a further 12 were consistent with primary biliary cirrhosis, but only 2 were normal. There was a high incidence of other autoantibodies and autoimmune diseases, especially thyroid antibodies and disorders. Sixteen of these patients have been followed for over 4 years since diagnosis (mean = 6 years, range = 4 to 9 years) and for a mean of 8.7 years since initial detection of the antimitochondrial antibody (range = 4 to 13). Five of 16 developed symptoms suggestive of primary biliary cirrhosis, and 11 of 16 developed elevation of alkaline phosphatase. The antimitochondrial antibody activity in these patients was in the same IgG subclasses (predominantly IgG1 and IgG3) as that seen in a group of 23 patients with clinically, biochemically and histologically advanced primary biliary cirrhosis. All showed the same abnormalities on quantitative estimation of the total IgG subclasses in serum; relative excess of IgG3 and, to a lesser extent, IgG2 was exhibited. It is concluded that, in this study, the finding of an antimitochondrial antibody titer greater than or equal to 1/40 is strongly suggestive of primary biliary cirrhosis even in the absence of symptoms and the presence of a normal alkaline phosphatase.\r"

  ".W": "Stimulated by observations in an outbreak of hepatitis delta-virus infection among Yucpa Indians in Venezuela, in which unusual histologic features were found, we studied 100 cases of fatal hepatitis from Colombia, South America, which had been obtained by autopsy or viscerotomy. These cases were considered to be \"Santa Marta hepatitis,\" or \"hepatitis of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta,\" which has been observed in this region for more than 40 years. Of the 100 cases, 19 had a variety of histologic lesions or were normal, and hepatitis delta-virus antigen was not demonstrated immunocytochemically in any of them. By contrast, 81 cases had a characteristic histologic picture with intense microvesicular steatosis associated with conspicuous eosinophilic necrosis of the hepatocytes, which apparently were sluggishly removed by cytolysis. Hepatitis delta-virus antigen was detected in 70% of the 81 cases, and the absence of detection of this antigen was often associated with poor tissue preservation and more extensive hepatocyte necrosis. A smaller percentage of patients had hepatitis B virus antigens detectable in liver tissue. The characteristic lesion in these 81 cases could be distinguished from other causes of microvesicular steatosis by the extensive eosinophilic necrosis. Other variable accompanying features included intraacinar, mainly macrophagic, scavenger cell inflammation, intense portal inflammation, a parenchymal regeneration, and ductular and arteriolar proliferation. Santa Marta hepatitis as a severe form of hepatitis delta-virus infection differs markedly from fulminant delta-hepatitis in Europe and the United States in which the microsteatosis with marked eosinophilic degeneration is not found. The causes for these differences are unknown but may relate to nutritional factors or environmental toxins.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "\"Santa Marta\" hepatitis has been recognized as an unusual type of severe hepatitis occurring in northern Colombia since 1930. Liver specimens from a historic viscerotomy series, used by Gast-Galvis to identify cases and describe epidemiologic features of this disease, were available for review and histopathologic staining for delta-virus. Of 86 liver specimens examined from cases of fulminant Santa Marta hepatitis, 81 showed a distinct histopathologic picture, in various stages of progression, with features of eosinophilic necrosis, microvesicular fat infiltration of the liver parenchyma and morula cells; 69% were positive for delta-antigen by immunoperoxidase staining. This disease occurred predominantly in several small towns within 50 km of Santa Marta, with mortality reaching 1.25 per 1,000 inhabitants per year during the 1940's. Children under age 15 were most commonly affected and males affected twice as frequently as females. Liver specimens obtained from children, or within 15 hr of death, or which showed early histologic stages of disease were most likely to be positive for delta-antigen. This and the accompanying study confirm the existence of a distinct type of fulminant hepatitis in Colombia for over 50 years. The epidemiologic and histopathologic features are comparable to severe hepatitis in Venezuela Indians and in the Amazon basin of Brazil, suggesting that all are caused by delta-superinfection of hepatitis B virus carriers.\r"

  ".W": "Hepatitis D virus is a defective human pathogen that requires hepatitis B virus for its replication. A hybridization-based assay for the 1.75 kb RNA genome of hepatitis D virus was developed using as probe a radiolabeled transcript of a cloned cDNA fragment (pKD3 hepatitis D virus DNA). Sera from 120 chronic carriers of HBsAg with confirmed hepatitis D virus infection were analyzed for the presence of hepatitis D virus RNA. Serum hepatitis D virus RNA was detected in 43 of 74 (58%) patients with chronic liver disease; some patients were positive for hepatitis D virus RNA in multiple samples over a period of several years. Serum hepatitis D virus RNA was present in 17 of 28 (61%) patients during the acute phase of clinical hepatitis and was not detected after recovery from acute disease or in 18 asymptomatic chronic HBsAg carriers with antibody to hepatitis D virus. The presence of hepatitis D virus RNA correlated with other known markers of active hepatitis D virus replication; all chronic active liver disease patients with serum hepatitis D virus RNA were positive for antihepatitis D antigen IgM, and 34 of 37 (92%) had hepatitis D antigen in their liver biopsy specimens. The assay for hepatitis D virus RNA provides a direct and noninvasive method for the detection of hepatitis D virus in serum and will be useful in the study of the natural history of type D hepatitis, the identification of chronic hepatitis D virus carriers likely to transmit hepatitis D virus and the selection and monitoring of patients for potential antiviral therapy.\r"

There was no histologic feature distinctive of hepatitis delta virus from other types of viral hepatitis. Biopsy specimens of patients with chronic disease exhibited portal and periportal inflammation with piecemeal necrosis, conforming to a picture of aggressive hepatitis often accompanied by cirrhosis. Characteristic was a marked intralobular infiltration by mononuclear cells and a degenerative eosinophilic change of the hepatocytic cytoplasms conducive to the formation of acidophilic bodies. Liver specimens from patients with hepatitis delta virus hepatitis exhibited aspects of focal, confluent and bridging necrosis. The disease progressed to chronicity irrespective of the original histological features. The expression of intrahepatic hepatitis delta antigen was reduced in the phase of the acute hepatitis but increased in parallel with the development of chronic active liver disease. In late-stage cirrhosis, expression of hepatitis delta antigen was usually low.\r"

One of these assays, Corzyme-M (Abbott Laboratories, North Chicago, Ill.), recently became commercially available. The present study was undertaken to evaluate the clinical utility of this anti-HBc IgM test in establishing the diagnosis of acute hepatitis B using sera from a group of 42 prospectively followed individuals who had been exposed to hepatitis B virus. The Corzyme-M test was highly sensitive in detecting recent hepatitis B virus infection. All 30 patients with symptomatic and 12 with asymptomatic acute hepatitis B virus infection developed anti-HBc IgM. However, the timing of sample testing relative to onset of symptoms in symptomatic patients was important, inasmuch as 2 of 23 patients were negative for anti-HBc IgM early in the symptomatic period, although all were HBsAg positive. The duration of anti-HBc IgM positivity after acute infection was variable, ranging from 2 to 134 weeks. In 14% of patients, anti-HBc IgM remained detectable for more than 1 year. From the data, recommendations are given regarding the usefulness of anti-HBc IgM testing in the diagnosis of acute hepatitis B virus infection.\r"

In rats with acute liver failure induced by a low dose of galactosamine, supplementation with purified plasma fibronectin at 3 hr after the administration of galactosamine provided significant increase of plasma fibronectin levels and augmentation of reticuloendothelial system function at 4 hr, significantly higher plasma fibronectin levels and significant protection of liver damage with shorter prothrombin times, lower AST and less histological damage at 48 hr as compared to control animals. Plasma fibronectin levels were inversely correlated with both plasma prothrombin times and AST. Fibronectin supplementation at 6 hr also resulted in the significant decrease of liver damage at 48 hr as evaluated histologically. When rats with liver failure, induced by a high dose of galactosamine, were supplemented with fibronectin at 3 hr, the survival rate was significantly higher than that of control rats. The results indicate that fibronectin supplementation in the early stages of acute liver failure could reduce liver damage and improve the survival of rats with galactosamine-induced liver failure.\r"

  ".W": "The low density lipoprotein receptor activity was measured in primary cultures of human hepatocytes. The receptor-mediated association and degradation of low density lipoprotein increased gradually up to 140 and 190%, respectively, upon incubation of the cells with increasing amounts of whole serum (up to 100%). Preincubation of the cells with low density lipoprotein resulted in a weak downregulation of the receptor-mediated association of low density lipoprotein (only 35% reduction at 100 micrograms low density lipoprotein per ml). However, preincubation with high density lipoproteins with density between 1.16 and 1.20 gm per ml (heavy high density lipoprotein) resulted in a more than 2-fold stimulation of the receptor-mediated association of low density lipoprotein. This heavy high density lipoprotein-mediated stimulation could not be antagonized by a simultaneous addition of low density lipoprotein during that preincubation. We conclude that, in primary cultures of human hepatocytes, the downregulation of the low density lipoprotein receptor activity by low density lipoprotein is weak and completely overruled by heavy high density lipoprotein. If these results for human hepatocytes in vitro hold true for hepatocytes in vivo, our results might explain why in vivo liver cells still display low density lipoprotein receptor activity notwithstanding the exposure of these cells to physiological concentrations of low density lipoprotein.\r"

  ".W": "The uptake of cystine in isolated rat hepatocytes was enhanced after incubation of the cells with sulfobromophthalein. The enhancement was time- and dose-dependent, with a lag of about 6 hr, and an approximately 4-fold increase in the activity occurred after 24 hr with 0.2 mM sulfobromophthalein. Actinomycin D or cycloheximide completely blocked the time-related increase in the uptake. The enhanced activity of cystine uptake was almost entirely Na+-independent and inhibited by some anionic amino acids, such as glutamate. The uptake of glutamate was also enhanced by sulfobromophthalein. It is concluded that sulfobromophthalein induces the activity of the Na+-independent, anionic amino acid transport system (System x-c) which mediates the transport of cystine. Some other electrophilic agents also enhanced the cystine uptake. The glutathione level of hepatocytes was rapidly reduced by sulfobromophthalein to about 10% of the control level at 6 hr, but at 12 hr it began to rise. It seems likely that this restoration resulted from the induced activity of the cystine uptake because inhibitors of the cystine uptake blocked the restoration and because the uptake of other sulfur amino acids was not enhanced significantly by sulfobromophthalein. System x-c may thus participate in the detoxication of electrophilic agents in hepatocytes.\r"

Alcohol dehydrogenase activity was highest in hepatocytes harvested from hypophysectomized rats. The enzyme activity remained stable in hepatocytes harvested from normal rats during 2 to 6 days of culture but declined steadily in hepatocytes cultured from hypophysectomized rats. The combination of growth hormone (1 microgram per ml) and corticosterone (1 microM) increased alcohol dehydrogenase activity in hepatocytes from normal rats, while neither hormone alone had an effect. Corticosterone (1 microM) prevented the decline of the enzyme activity in hepatocytes from hypophysectomized rats, and the combination of growth hormone (1 microgram per ml) and corticosterone (1 microM) resulted in a further increase in enzyme activity. The increases in alcohol dehydrogenase, due to the exposure of the hepatocytes to the combination of growth hormone and corticosterone, were associated with increases in the rate of ethanol elimination. These observations indicate that growth hormone enhances liver alcohol dehydrogenase activity and ethanol elimination, and that this effect is dependent on the permissive influence of corticosterone.\r"

Untreated spontaneously hypertensive rats had higher values for thromboxane excretion in the urine and higher values for blood pressure than did normotensive control rats. Administration of OKY 046 decreased systolic and mean arterial blood pressure and urinary excretion of thromboxane and protein in spontaneously hypertensive rats. Administration of OKY 046 decreased thromboxane excretion in the urine of normotensive control rats but had no effect on blood pressure or protein excretion. Renal function, as assessed by the clearances of inulin and p-aminohippuric acid, was greater in spontaneously hypertensive rats treated with OKY 046 than in those receiving vehicle alone. In normotensive control rats, OKY 046 administration did not affect renal function. These results suggest that increased renal synthesis of thromboxane may play a role in the pathogenesis of the elevated blood pressure of spontaneously hypertensive rats.\r"

  ".U": "87082187\r", 
  ".W": "In the rat, angiotensin II receptors of the adrenal glomerulosa and smooth muscle undergo reciprocal regulatory changes that parallel the changes in target cell sensitivity to angiotensin II during altered sodium intake. In primates, the relative importance of angiotensin II receptor regulation during sodium-induced changes in angiotensin II sensitivity is not clear. To evaluate the role of angiotensin II receptor regulation in the primate, we analyzed the changes in angiotensin II receptors of adrenal and bladder membrane-rich particles after 4 to 6 days of high or low sodium intake in the monkey (Macaca fascicularis). Consistent with the decreased pressor response to angiotensin II, smooth muscle angiotensin II receptors were fewer in sodium-restricted monkeys (93 +/- 17 fmol/mg) than in sodium-loaded monkeys (171 +/- 6 fmol/mg). However, in contrast to the rat, changes in zona glomerulosa angiotensin II receptors in monkey adrenal were similar to those in smooth muscle, decreasing with sodium restriction and increasing with sodium loading (344 +/- 64 and 660 +/- 68 fmol/mg, respectively). There was no change in angiotensin II receptor affinity in either smooth muscle or adrenal particles during altered sodium intake. Concomitant with the decrease in adrenal angiotensin II receptors, 18-hydroxylase activity was increased twofold in adrenal mitochondria from sodium-restricted monkeys (74 +/- 8 fmol/mg/min) compared with sodium-loaded animals (28 +/- 11 fmol/mg/min). The increased sensitivity of the primate adrenal to angiotensin II despite a fall in angiotensin II receptors indicates that full activation of steroidogenesis by angiotensin II can be maintained with partial receptor occupancy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Normal and two-kidney, one clip hypertensive rats (0.2-mm silver clip on the right renal artery 3-4 weeks before study) were prepared to allow study of each kidney. Mean arterial blood pressure of two-kidney, one clip hypertensive rats fell significantly from control values of 149 +/- 6 to 135 +/- 6 mm Hg after denervation of the nonclipped kidney.

Sinoaortic denervation and nucleus tractus solitarii lesions both eliminated the reflex bradycardia to a phenylephrine-induced pressor response. No difference was found in the average level and lability of the mean arterial pressure between 1-hour and 24-hour recordings for any group. No elevation in the average mean arterial pressure of rats with nucleus tractus solitarii lesions was observed, although a mild hypertension was noted in half the sinoarotic-denervated rats, while the other half were normotensive. Group differences were not found for heart rate or heart rate variability; however, 24-hour recordings yielded significantly higher values than 1-hour recordings for all groups. Both medullary lesions and sinoaortic denervation significantly increased the lability of the mean arterial pressure, but the magnitude of the increase was significantly greater in the rats with lesions. The lability of the mean arterial pressure in sinoaortic-denervated rats depended largely on movement-related depressor responses that produced a negative skew in the frequency distribution of their mean arterial pressure. Rats with nucleus tractus solitarii lesions exhibited both pressor and depressor responses that resulted in pressure distributions that had a slight positive skew similar to that displayed by control rats. It is concluded that short-term continuous recordings of mean arterial pressure and heart rate accurately estimate the altered cardiovascular activity of baroreceptor-denervated rats. The differences in the cardiovascular responses of central and peripheral baroreceptor-denervated rats are believed to be due to the more extensive destruction by nucleus tractus solitarii lesions of central neurons and pathways involved in cardiovascular regulation.\r"

The 174 hypertensive male adolescents studied further showed pathophysiological features such as a significantly higher frequency of obesity, higher 24-hour urinary sodium excretion, higher hematocrit value, higher sodium and lower potassium concentration in red blood cells, and higher ouabain-sensitive sodium efflux compared with the control group (231 male students; p less than 0.05). When used alone, the ordinary 10-week period of counseling about a low salt diet failed to significantly reduce the blood pressure of hypertensive students. However, when education and counseling efforts were combined with self-monitoring of salt (chloride) excretion in overnight urine samples using a new salt titrator tape developed in our laboratory, 24-hour urinary sodium excretion, weight, and blood pressure decreased significantly over 10 weeks (mean reduction: 52 mEq/day for 24-hour urinary sodium excretion, 1.7 kg for weight, 12/7 mm Hg for blood pressure). These results indicate that blood pressure of borderline hypertensive adolescents could be effectively reduced with this nonpharmacological method of dietary education. Such systematic management might be of importance for the prevention of essential hypertension.\r"

After 20 minutes of supine rest, no significant differences in total, ouabain-resistant or ouabain-sensitive sodium efflux rate constants were apparent between the two groups. In normotensive subjects with no family history, there was no significant change in any efflux rate constant during cold pressor test, although there was a highly significant negative correlation between change in total efflux rate constant and change in norepinephrine levels (r = -0.82, p less than 0.01, n = 12). During cold pressor test in subjects with a family history of hypertension, there was a significant rise in the ouabain-resistant efflux rate constant (1.5 +/- 0.1 vs 1.0 +/- 0.1 hr-1; p less than 0.01, n = 10); this level was also significantly higher than that in control subjects (p less than 0.002). In this group, the ouabain-sensitive efflux rate constant fell slightly but not significantly (1.8 +/- 0.2 vs 2.1 +/- 0.2 hr-1; n = 10). These results suggest that stress in the form of a cold stimulus produces qualitative differences in leukocyte cation transport in normotensive offspring of hypertensive patients as compared with subjects without such a family history.\r"

  ".W": "Numerous studies have reported the mean value for Na+-Li+ countertransport to be increased in red blood cells from patients with essential hypertension. Although concomitant variables including age, body size, national origin, geographic location, gender, and family history of hypertension may affect Na+-Li+ countertransport values, most case-control studies have failed to assess the contribution of these factors to the differences in Na+-Li+ countertransport between hypertensive and normotensive groups. The present study was undertaken to provide estimates of Na+-Li+ countertransport in hypertensive and normotensive subjects after taking into account these potentially confounding sources of variation. In 187 subjects undergoing medical evaluation at the Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, the combined effects of variation in age, height, and weight accounted for 20.6% of the interindividual variability in Na+-Li+ countertransport. After adjustment to remove variability due to these concomitants, differences in national origin, region of birth, and place of current residence made no additional contribution to variability in this trait. There was no significant difference in mean adjusted Na+-Li+ countertransport between men and women (0.41 +/- 0.17 vs 0.40 +/- 0.12 [SD] mmol Li efflux/L red blood cells/hr; n = 107). The mean value for adjusted Na+-Li+ countertransport was significantly greater (p less than or equal to 0.001) in subjects with essential hypertension (0.44 +/- 0.15 mmol/L red blood cell/hr; n = 104) compared with normotensive subjects (0.31 +/- 0.07 mmol/L red blood cells/hr; n = 39) or subjects with borderline blood pressure elevation (0.35 +/- 0.11 mmol/L red blood cells/hr; n = 21). Subjects with a family history of hypertension in at least one parent or full sibling had significantly higher (p less than 0.02) Na+-Li+ countertransport values (0.42 +/- 0.16 mmol/L red blood cells/hr; n = 111) than those with no family history of hypertension (0.37 +/- 0.13 mmol/L red blood cells/hr; n = 76). These results suggest that increased mean Na+-Li+ countertransport in hypertensive subjects in this sample cannot be attributed to confounding effects of variation in age, body size, gender, national origin, birthplace, or residence. Forty-eight percent of subjects with essential hypertension had adjusted Na+-Li+ countertransport values above the range observed in normotensive controls.\r"

In supine resting subjects, dihydroergotoxine significantly decreased systolic blood pressure (from 175 +/- 5 to 156 +/- 4 mm Hg; p less than 0.001), diastolic blood pressure (from 109 +/- 4 to 95 +/- 3 mm Hg; p less than 0.001), and heart rate (from 71 +/- 2 to 63 +/- 2 beats/min; p less than 0.001) as compared with the results of placebo treatment. Moreover, dihydroergotoxine reduced plasma levels of norepinephrine (from 368 +/- 39 to 238 +/- 33 pg/ml; p less than 0.001) and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (from 1.57 +/- 0.21 to 1.22 +/- 0.13 ng/ml; p less than 0.01). The time course of the blood pressure decrease paralleled that of plasma norepinephrine concentration. Dihydroergotoxine did not suppress the cardiovascular and plasma norepinephrine concentration. Dihydroergotoxine did not suppress the cardiovascular and plasma norepinephrine response to standing. The effect of domperidone, a peripheral presynaptic dopamine receptor antagonist, on dihydroergotoxine response was studied in six of the 20 subjects (3 men and 3 women 48-64 years old). The intravenous administration of domperidone (0.3 mg/kg) prevented the dihydroergotoxine-induced reduction in blood pressure and heart rate and the fall in plasma norepinephrine and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid levels.

Renal vasoconstrictor responses to renal nerve stimulation and alpha 1-adrenergic receptor agonists (norepinephrine, phenylephrine) were inhibited by an alpha 1-adrenergic receptor antagonist (prazosin) but not by an alpha 2-adrenergic receptor antagonist (rauwolscine). A semilog plot of renal vasoconstrictor responses a fraction of control renal blood flow versus agonist dose (in nanograms) was linear with the slope, k, taken as the fractional decrease in renal blood flow per nanogram. The alpha 2-adrenergic receptor agonists (clonidine, guanabenz) produced minimal renal vasoconstrictor responses (fractional decrease in renal blood flow per nanogram: norepinephrine, 0.011; phenylephrine, 0.003; clonidine, 0.00087; guanabenz, 0.000037). The small renal vasoconstrictor responses to clonidine and guanabenz were more inhibited by rauwolscine than by prazosin. Low frequency renal nerve stimulation produced antidiuresis and antinatriuresis without decreasing glomerular filtration rate or renal blood flow. The antidiuretic and antinatriuretic responses were inhibited by prazosin but unaffected by rauwolscine. The magnitude of the renal vascular and tubular responses and their adrenergic receptor mediation were not different between spontaneously hypertensive, Wistar-Kyoto, and Sprague-Dawley rats.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Thirty of the 39 animals were subjected to biweekly systemic arterial blood pressure determinations with femoral arterial puncture and were placed into two hypertensive and two normotensive groups based on mean blood pressure: Group 1 (mean blood pressure, 128 +/- 12 mm Hg), Group 2 (mean blood pressure, 121 +/- 3 mm Hg), Group 3 (mean blood pressure, 114 +/- 8 mm Hg), and Group 4 (mean blood pressure, 101 +/- 9 mm Hg). Groups 1, 2, and 3 had mean blood pressures significantly higher than that of Group 4 (p less than 0.05). Ten dogs (representatives from Groups 1, 2, and 3) were subjected to more detailed clinical testing including angiography, echocardiography, ophthalmic examination, plasma catecholamine and renin activity measurements, plasma lead and cadmium determinations, cerebrospinal fluid examination, renal profile, and serum chemistry and hematological analysis. Five unrelated normotensive Siberian huskies were compared with colony dogs by using echocardiography. Groups 1 and 2 showed a clear but statistically insignificant upward trend in left ventricular wall thickness indexed against body weights when compared with that in Group 3 and in the unrelated five normal Siberian dogs. Thus, the only specific difference from group to group in the colony at the termination of this study was the difference in mean blood pressure. Based on these data, it is possible and likely that aging will reveal changes secondary to chronic primary hypertension. The pathogenesis of this hereditary disorder remains unknown.\r"

At the time of fixation all vascular tone had been abolished. Scanning electron microscopy analysis revealed that all Wistar-Kyoto and spontaneously hypertensive rats at a given age have spindle-shaped vascular smooth muscle cells of comparable length and longitudinal width for a given branching order of arterioles. However, normal maturation is associated with elongation and widening of the vascular smooth muscle cells. Light and scanning electron microscopy indicated that a monolayer of vascular smooth muscle cells, wrapped at almost 0 degree to the vessel's radial axis, is maintained in adult spontaneously hypertensive rats. The radial thickness of this vascular smooth muscle cell monolayer was significantly (p less than 0.025) increased for only the largest arterioles of young and adult spontaneously hypertensive rats. This radial thickening of individual vascular smooth muscle cells increased the muscular component of the wall area for the largest arterioles by about 50% in adult spontaneously hypertensive rats. Other smaller submucosal arterioles of young and adult spontaneously hypertensive rats had normal vessel wall and vascular smooth muscle cell characteristics. These data indicate that hypertrophy in the smooth muscle cell's radial dimension is the primary morphological change in intestinal arterioles of spontaneously hypertensive rats. However, the vascular smooth muscle cell hypertrophy is confined to the largest arterioles such that the remaining smaller arteriolar vessels in the spontaneously hypertensive rat retain a normal smooth muscle cell and overall wall morphology.\r"

Since efferent renal nerve activity is increased in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and renal denervation delays the onset of hypertension in SHR in association with increased diuresis and natriuresis, the present study was undertaken to examine whether renorenal reflexes were altered in SHR compared with normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY). In WKY mean arterial pressure was 113 +/- 2 mm Hg and remained unchanged during renal mechanoreceptor and chemoreceptor stimulation. Increasing ureteral pressure 35 mm Hg increased ipsilateral afferent renal nerve activity 4.5 +/- 1.7 resets/min, decreased contralateral efferent renal nerve activity 3.2 +/- 0.8 resets/min, and increased contralateral urine flow rate 33 +/- 4% and urinary sodium excretion 49 +/- 8%. Similarly, retrograde ureteropelvic perfusion with 0.9 M NaCl increased ipsilateral afferent renal nerve activity 2.5 +/- 0.6 resets/min, decreased contralateral efferent renal nerve activity 2.4 +/- 1.1 resets/min, and increased contralateral urine flow rate 39 +/- 5% and urinary sodium excretion 38 +/- 8%. Stimulating renal mechanoreceptors and chemoreceptors to the same extent in SHR failed to increase ipsilateral afferent renal nerve activity, decrease contralateral efferent renal nerve activity, and produce a contralateral diuresis and natriuresis. It is concluded that renorenal reflexes are impaired in SHR. Failure of ipsilateral afferent renal nerve activity to increase during renal mechanoreceptor and chemoreceptor stimulation indicates a peripheral defect at the level of the renal sensory receptors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Several laboratories have reported that the activities of sodium-lithium countertransport are increased in red blood cells from patients with essential hypertension. Based on the many similarities between this transport system and the renal sodium-proton exchanger, a hypothesis has been put forth in the literature that increased red blood cell sodium-lithium countertransport activity may be a marker for increased sodium-proton exchange activity in the renal proximal tubule. The present studies were designed to test the hypothesis that sodium-lithium countertransport in red blood cells from humans or rabbits is mediated by the same transport mechanism that mediates sodium-proton exchange in the renal brush border from those species. Similar to what has been reported for the rabbit, the present studies show that an amiloride-sensitive sodium-proton exchanger is present in human renal brush border vesicles. However, Na+-Li+ countertransport in human and rabbit red blood cells, assayed under several different conditions, was not inhibited by amiloride. In agreement with what has been reported for humans, the present studies show that extracellular proton-stimulated sodium efflux is inhibited by amiloride in rabbit red blood cells. These data demonstrate a difference (amiloride sensitivity) between the red blood cell sodium-lithium countertransporter and the renal brush border sodium-proton exchanger in humans and rabbits. These experiments detract from the hypothesis that increased red blood cell sodium-lithium countertransport activity in patients with essential hypertension is a marker for increased sodium-proton exchange activity in the renal brush border.\r"

  ".U": "87082207\r", 
  ".W": "The possible role of catecholamines in the abnormal renal response to salt loading, a genetic defect resulting in hypertension in the salt-sensitive strain of Dahl rats, was investigated by measuring the adrenal synthesis of norepinephrine, epinephrine, and dopamine as well as their content in several tissues and the urinary excretion of these catecholamines as well as some of their metabolites at the height of salt-induced hypertension. We found that salt-sensitive Dahl rats, compared with salt-resistant Dahl rats, have a higher adrenal synthesis of [3H]norepinephrine following a pulse injection of [3H]tyrosine, a higher adrenal norepinephrine and epinephrine content but a lower kidney and heart ventricle content of dopamine and norepinephrine, and a decreased excretion of urinary dopamine, dihydroxyphenylacetic acid, 3-methoxytyramine, and homovanillic acid. These data suggest that the primary abnormality in salt-sensitive Dahl rats may be their inability to turn off, during high salt intake, their increased adrenal norepinephrine synthesis from dopamine. The abnormal catecholamine response of salt-sensitive Dahl rats to high salt intake indirectly suggests increased noradrenergic activity and decreased dopaminergic activity in the kidney, which may be important mechanisms in the sodium retention and hypertension of these rats.\r"

  ".W": "We tested the hypothesis that the antihypertensive effects of dietary taurine supplementation in deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA)-salt rats may be attributed to the suppression of sympathetic nervous system activity. In uninephrectomized rats treated with DOCA while receiving 1% NaCl solution for 2 weeks, systolic blood pressure was significantly increased as compared with that in control rats treated with vehicle suspension and tap water. Sympathetic nervous system activity was assessed by tissue norepinephrine turnover, which was determined from the rate of decline of tissue norepinephrine concentration after the administration of alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine, a potent inhibitor of the rate-limiting step of catecholamine synthesis. Cardiac and splenic norepinephrine turnover during either normal conditions or cold exposure (4 degrees C, 8 hours) were markedly increased in DOCA-salt rats as compared with control rats. Also, DOCA-salt rats had increased depressor response to hexamethonium bromide, a ganglion blocker. In contrast, supplementation of 1% taurine in DOCA-salt rats attenuated the development of the hypertension associated with the normalization of both the increased depressor response to ganglionic blockade and the accelerated cardiac and splenic norepinephrine turnover during either normal conditions or cold exposure. Taurine supplementation in control rats, however, had no effect on blood pressure or norepinephrine turnover during cold exposure. These results suggest that taurine supplementation suppresses sympathetic overactivity in DOCA-salt rats, thus leading to inhibition of the development of hypertension.\r"

In this study, we increased plasma phosphate in SHR by a dietary phosphate intake and followed the effects on blood pressure. Fifteen male WKY and 15 male SHR were housed from 4 weeks of age up to 26 weeks. At 4 weeks of age all SHR manifested a hypophosphatemia compared with age-matched WKY (F = 62, p less than 0.0003). At 5 weeks of age, the rats were divided into three diet groups: a control group, a group receiving 1.41% (wt/vol) KCl in drinking water, and a group receiving 2% (wt/vol) K2HPO4 X KH2PO4 in drinking water. In the control (F = 16.2, p less than 0.02) and KCl groups, (F = 36.3, p less than 0.03), hypophosphatemia persisted throughout the study. The phosphate-supplemented diet normalized plasma phosphate level in SHR but did not change plasma phosphate level in WKY. As a consequence, no difference in plasma phosphate level between WKY and SHR was present in the group receiving additional phosphate from that time on (F = 1.2, p greater than 0.41). The phosphate-supplemented diet significantly decreased systolic blood pressure in both strains. In phosphate-supplemented SHR, a significant decline in systolic blood pressure was observed from 20 weeks of age on (at 20 weeks of age: 222 +/- 3 mm Hg for control SHR vs 198 +/- 5 mm Hg for phosphate-supplemented SHR; p less than 0.0003).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The flap was delivered into the neck through a subclavicular tunnel. The procedure was performed in 55 patients, with a bilateral simultaneous flap used in one. Four instances of flap necrosis occurred, although it was felt that they were not related to the modified technique, and no damage to the subclavian vessel occurred. In the first 25 flaps, we did not identify the neurovascular bundle supplying the preserved musculature. Eighteen of these flaps were evaluated, and atrophy was encountered in 10. Of the latter 31 patients, only one suffered atrophy of the sternocostal bundle. The technical modification of preserving part of the muscle and its neurovascular supply is especially important in manual workers. Twenty-eight of 38 patients with preserved muscle function at the donor site were manual workers, and 10 of them returned to normal activity. None of the patients who developed atrophy of the pectoralis major muscular remnant was able to return to work within 1 year or longer after treatment. In the successful cases, there were no functional sequelae of the arm, visible depressions in the infraclavicular area, or loss of the anatomic configuration of the anterior axillary line.\r"

One patient developed a transient hemiparesis that resolved in 3 days, and in another, a permanent hemiparesis occurred. Three patients have survived longer than 12 months. One patient is free of disease at 42 months following two salvage operations. We attribute the low operative morbidity to the frequent use of the subclavian artery for proximal anastomosis and myocutaneous flaps to resurface cutaneous and mucosal defects. We conclude that salvage surgery with carotid artery replacement can be performed on selected patients who have failed combined therapy as a palliative and possibly curative measure.\r"

Diagnosis of a Brown tumor was delayed despite serial computerized tomography of the head and repeated transnasal and transethmoid sphenoid biopsies demonstrating diffuse fibrosis. Only detection and medical evaluation of hypercalcemia, demonstrating elevation of both serum calcium and C-terminal parathyroid hormone with an elevated chloride/phosphate ratio, prompted neck exploration, thus confirming a solitary left superior parathyroid adenoma. Postoperative normocalcemia occurred synchronously with the return of light perception and the arrest of sphenoid sinus and parasellar erosion. Although maxillary Brown tumors of secondary HPT have been reported, this is the first report of osteitis fibrosa of the sphenoid sinus. Differential diagnosis of an erosive sphenoid lesion with cranial nerve dysfunction, exclusive of inflammatory or vascular disease, should include sarcoidosis, primary and metastatic sphenoid carcinoma, fibrous dysplasia, giant cell reparative granuloma, midline lethal granuloma, chordoma, and chondrosarcoma. Furthermore, the bony destructive lesions with concomitant hypercalcemia of sarcoidosis and HPT are distinguishable by radiographic and laboratory analyses and by the Dent corticosteroid suppression test. Hypercalcemia of primary HPT is associated with elevated serum C-terminal parathormone, osteitis fibrosa, a negative Dent test, and a chloride/phosphate ratio greater than 33 in 94% of primary HPT patients. Hypercalcemia of sarcoidosis is associated with a normal or decreased C-terminal parathormone assay and a positive Dent test, as well as elevated serum immunoglobulins and erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and a positive angiotensin-converting enzyme assay.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "It is well known that in patients with Graves' disease there is dissociation among values for TSH receptor antibodies such as TSH binding-inhibiting antibody (TBIAb) and thyroid-stimulating antibody (TSAb). This study was designed to compare TSH receptor antibodies in serum and in culture supernatants of lymphocytes transformed by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection. TBIAb was assayed using solubilized porcine thyroid membranes and TSAb using cultured porcine thyroid cells. Transformation of peripheral lymphocytes by EBV was performed in eight untreated hyperthyroid patients with Graves' disease who had a clear dissociation between values for TBIAb and TSAb, even after multiple dilutions of serum. EBV-infected lymphocytes from a patient were distributed into the wells of 4 24-well culture plates. After the first 4-week culture, the cells in each well positive for TBIAb and/or TSAb were further distributed to 12 wells and cultured for 2 weeks. In the supernatants of 372 wells of the second culture in the 8 patients, 31 were positive for TBIAb, and 41 were positive for TSAb. Among the 76 wells positive for TSH receptor antibodies, 72 wells (94.7%) were positive in only 1 assay. These results suggest that there are two types of TSH receptor antibodies, one having a single function (TBIAb or TSAb) and the other multifunctional (both), in Graves' patients. The incidence of the single functional type is much greater than that of the multifunctional type. We conclude, therefore, that the heterogeneity of Graves' immunoglobulin G is due mainly to multiple antibodies with a single function.\r"

Anderson Hospital and Tumor Institute between January 1950 and July 1984, 125 had a history of external irradiation to the head and neck region during childhood. This study was a comparison of the characteristics and disease course of thyroid carcinoma in these patients with those of patients who had not received such irradiation. Each irradiated patient was matched to 3 nonirradiated patients by age, sex, and extent of disease. The groups had similar distributions of histological type of lesion, surgical procedures, and number of patients who received radioactive iodine as part of their initial treatment. The two groups' recurrence and mortality rates were similar as well, although patients who had head and neck irradiation as children more often presented with thyroid cancer not limited to the thyroid gland and bilateral thyroid lobe involvement (P less than 0.005). The data indicate that patients who received head and neck irradiation have, at the time of diagnosis, more extensive thyroid carcinoma. However, the prognosis of well differentiated thyroid carcinoma in patients who have a history of head and neck irradiation is similar to that in patients without such a history.\r"

  ".W": "There are two forms of autoimmune thyroiditis that may cause hypothyroidism: autoimmune atrophic thyroiditis (primary idiopathic hypothyroidism or primary myxedema) and autoimmune goitrous thyroiditis (Hashimoto's disease). Patients with the former have impalpable thyroid glands, and those with the latter have goiters. We studied TSH binding inhibitory immunoglobulins (TBII), TSH-stimulated cAMP response inhibitory immunoglobulins (TSII), and TSH-stimulated cell growth inhibitory immunoglobulins (TGII) in 42 patients with the former (group 1) and 115 patients with the latter (group 2). Porcine thyroid cells in primary culture and rat thyroid cells in continuous culture (FRTL-5 cells) were used to study TSII and TGII activities, respectively; TSII was expressed as percent inhibition of 0.1 mU/ml TSH-stimulated cAMP response by the patient's immunoglobulin (IgG; 1 mg/ml) during 2-h incubation, and TGII was expressed as percent inhibition of 10 mU/ml TSH-stimulated [14C]thymidine incorporation by the patient's IgG (1 mg/ml) during 24-h incubation. The new findings in this report are: some patients in both groups had TBII, TSII, and/or TGII; the frequency of the presence of TBII, TSII, and TGII in the patients with autoimmune atrophic thyroiditis was higher than that in the patients with autoimmune goitrous thyroiditis, and TSII and TGII were significantly associated with autoimmune atrophic thyroiditis; no correlation was found between goiter size and TBII, TSII, or TGII activity; and there were good correlations between TBII, TSII, and TGII activities. We also found that TSH-stimulated thymidine incorporation was through cAMP production and that the inhibitory IgGs inhibited TSH-stimulated thymidine incorporation by decreasing cAMP production in FRTL-5 cells, but not in porcine or human thyroid cells.\r"

  ".W": "It is not clear whether dopamine (DA) has a central stimulating activity on GH secretion in patients with acromegaly, as it does in normal subjects. To clarify this, we compared the GH inhibitory potencies of DA, which does not cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB), and L-dopa or bromocriptine, which do cross the BBB, in 23 patients with acromegaly. Further, we examined the central effects of L-dopa after selectively blocking peripheral (median eminence and pituitary) DA receptors with domperidone (a DA D2 receptor blocker which does not cross the BBB). After the administration of DA (5 micrograms/kg X min, iv, for 90 min), L-dopa (500 mg, orally), or bromocriptine (2.5 mg, orally), the mean plasma GH decrease was greatest after DA [maximum decrement, 71.9 +/- 3.8% (+/- SEM); n = 21] compared to L-dopa (44.1 +/- 5.6%; n = 23; p less than 0.001) or bromocriptine (58.9 +/- 5.0%; n = 20; p less than 0.02). Eleven of these patients received a single infusion of domperidone (0.22 mg/min, iv, for 180 min) or a combination of domperidone and L-dopa. Mean plasma GH levels did not change during domperidone alone. However, plasma GH levels in these patients increased significantly when L-dopa was administered 30 min after the start of domperidone infusion (vs. control study: at 90 min, 137.3 +/- 10.8% vs. 100.2 +/- 3.9%, p less than 0.01; at 120 min, 138.8 +/- 19.7% vs. 106.5 +/- 3.1%, p less than 0.05). In contrast, one patient who had a distinct plasma GH increase in response to the domperidone-L-dopa test had no increase in plasma GH when given L-dopa 30 min after the start of a sulpiride infusion (DA D2 receptor blocker which crosses the BBB; 1.1 mg/min, iv, for 180 min). Unlike GH, plasma PRL responses to domperidone infusion were not modified by the additional administration of L-dopa. These results suggest that in acromegaly, DA has not only direct suppressive effects on the pituitary tumor somatotrophs, but also indirect stimulatory effects via the hypothalamus; therefore, the hypothalamic GH-releasing system is not entirely suppressed by excessive tumor GH secretion.\r"

  ".W": "The ability of TSH or immunoglobulin G (G-IgG) from untreated patients with hyperthyroidism due to Graves' disease to stimulate thyroglobulin (Tg) release from human thyroid cells was studied. Thyroid tissue obtained from antithyroid drug-treated Graves' hyperthyroid patients was dispersed enzymatically and cultured in monolayers; medium was changed every 3 days. The cultured cells initially released large but declining amounts of Tg, independent of the presence of TSH (approximately 5 micrograms/dish on day 3 and approximately 1.5 micrograms/dish on day 6). After 6 days, TSH had a dose-dependent stimulatory effect on Tg release, and the peak response occurred on day 15. G-IgG-induced Tg release was found on the 12th day of culture and was maximal on day 18. Thyroid cells cultured for 12 days in the absence of TSH responded to TSH and G-IgG in a time- and dose-dependent fashion. Using 12-day cultures, Tg release-stimulating activity (Tg-RSA) was tested using 5 mg/ml (7.5 mg/dish) G-IgGs from 20 patients and 72-h incubation. The Tg-RSA of individual patients varied. However, significant correlations were found between Tg-RSA values and serum Tg concentrations or Tg-RSA and thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin activities. No correlation was found between Tg-RSA and TSH binding inhibitor immunoglobulin activities. These results suggest that Tg-RSA can be an indicator of abnormal IgG of hyperthyroid Graves' patients. Whether the activity is identical with thyroid-stimulating activity remains to be clarified.\r"

Each man wore a placebo membrane and three doses (5, 10, and 15 mg) of testosterone-containing membranes for 22 h/day. Each dose was worn for 1 week, and one dose was worn a second week. Blood was sampled frequently for one 22 h period on the seventh day of each treatment period. After the application of a membrane, the serum testosterone concentration rose rapidly, reached a peak in 2-3 h, and decreased slowly to 60-80% of the peak value by 22 h. The mean (+/- SE) 22-h average testosterone concentration during the wearing period was dependent on the testosterone content of the membrane (placebo, 135 +/- 38 ng/dl; 5 mg, 348 +/- 66 ng/dl; 10 mg, 455 +/- 77 ng/dl; and 15 mg, 624 +/- 65 ng/dl; P less than 0.001, by analysis of variance). When the same dose was worn twice, the mean coefficient of variation was 13.9%. We conclude that the transdermal application of testosterone to hypogonadal men reproducibly raises their serum testosterone concentrations to within the normal range, and that it, therefore, warrants evaluation as a treatment for male hypogonadism.\r"

GSA was determined every 14 days, and glucosylated hemoglobin (GHb) was measured once or twice. Capillary blood glucose records were used to determine mean fasted and mean daily blood sugar concentrations (mean of fasted, preprandial, and bedtime values) during serial 7-day intervals preceding each GSA and GHb determination and also for 28-, 56-, and 84-day intervals preceding each GSA determination. GSA positively correlated with preceding weekly mean fasting and mean daily blood glucose concentrations for 1-11 weeks (r ranges, 0.40-0.64 and 0.46-0.64, respectively) without a temporal pattern. GSA positively correlated with mean fasted and daily blood sugar levels determined over the preceding 28, 56, and 84 days (r range, 0.54-0.74). In addition, GSA correlated with GHb when drawn within 14 days (r = 0.72) or 28 days (r = 0.65) of each other. When monitoring the glycemic control of stable insulin-requiring diabetic patients, GSA offers similar information to GHb, and the two tests may be used interchangeably.\r"

Parasympathetic function and plasma hPP response to a standard mixed meal were evaluated in 10 long term insulin-dependent (type I) diabetic patients (group A), 6 age-matched newly diagnosed type I diabetic patients (group B), and 8 normal subjects. The indices of vagal function (beat to beat heart rate variation during deep breathing and the Valsalva maneuver) were uniformly altered in group A, while they were in the normal range in group B, thus excluding in these latter patients the presence of vagal damage. Plasma hPP in response to standard mixed meal was measured at 5, 15, 30, 60, and 120 min. Fasting plasma hPP concentrations (determined by RIA) in groups A and B (mean +/- SEM, 113 +/- 21 and 83 +/- 21 pg/ml, respectively) did not significantly differ from normal (59 +/- 12 pg/ml). In group A, the initial meal-induced hPP increase was significantly lower than normal (5 min, 139 +/- 12; 15 min, 173 +/- 24; 30 min, 137 +/- 17 pg/ml; P less than 0.01 vs. 5 min, 412 +/- 76; 15 min, 446 +/- 57; 30 min, 325 +/- 56 pg/ml). All group B patients had a marked early increase in the peptide, similar to that in the normal subjects. These results suggest that diabetic autonomic neuropathy is associated with dysfunction of hPP secretion, and the evaluation of hPP in response to SMM may be considered a sensitive and nonstressful method for the assessment of parasympathetic impairment in diabetes.\r"

This study examined in vivo the relationship of changes in ambient serum calcium (serum Ca) to ACTH- and AII-mediated aldosterone release in hypoparathyroid subjects. Plasma aldosterone (PA) responses to graded dose infusions of ACTH and AII were examined in hypoparathyroid (HypoPTH) patients before (n = 8) and after correction of hypocalcemia (n = 6) and compared to responses in 20 normotensive normocalcemic subjects. ACTH and AII were infused for 90 min at rates increasing from 12.5 to 50 mIU/30 min and 0.5 to 2.0 ng/kg X min, respectively. Pretreatment mean serum Ca was 6.8 +/- 0.2 (+/- SEM) mg/dl, and it rose to 9.3 +/- 0.2 mg/dl after 3-8 weeks of vitamin D administration. In the untreated HypoPTH patients, basal mean PA (5.4 +/- 1.3 ng/dl) was lower (P less than 0.01) than in the normal subjects (10.6 +/- 0.6 ng/dl) or treated HypoPTH patients (9.5 +/- 1.8 ng/dl). There was a marked reduction in PA responses to ACTH at all doses in the untreated HypoPTH patients compared to the normal subjects. With normalization of serum Ca in four patients, the mean peak PA response to ACTH (25.1 +/- 6.0 ng/dl) was not significantly different from normal (28.9 +/- 1.7 ng/dl). During graded dose AII infusion in five untreated HypoPTH patients, mean PA levels increased from 6.9 +/- 1.2 to 11.6 +/- 2.2 ng/dl; when the serum Ca was normal, the corresponding values were 8.7 +/- 1.8 and 20.2 +/- 3.61 ng/dl. There was a positive correlation (r = 0.475; P less than 0.05) between basal PA and serum Ca levels. In addition, maximum changes in mean arterial pressure in response to AII infusions were significantly greater after correction of hypocalcemia. These observations indicate that in HypoPTH patients, extracellular Ca concentrations can influence humoral aldosterone response to ACTH and AII and pressor responses to AII.\r"

This RIA was highly sensitive to free beta hCG; the minimum detectable concentration was 0.4 ng/ml. alpha hCG, LH, beta LH, and FSH had little effect in the assay; the cross-reactivity of hCG was about 4%. Using this RIA, we measured serum free beta hCG concentrations in 38 normal pregnant women and 72 untreated patients with 3 types of trophoblastic disease: hydatidiform mole (n = 15), invasive mole (n = 29), and choriocarcinoma (n = 28). All of these samples were simultaneously assayed for hCG by RIA. In normal pregnant women, serum hCG changed as pregnancy progressed, but serum free beta hCG was not detected at any time. In contrast, serum free beta hCG was measurable in the majority of patients with trophoblastic disease. Strong correlations were found between the concentration of free beta hCG and that of hCG in each type of trophoblastic diseases. The mean free beta hCG to hCG ratio was lowest for hydatidiform mole and highest for choriocarcinoma, and the difference between the ratios in these 2 groups was statistically significant. Serial measurements in 7 patients with trophoblastic disease failed to reveal remarkable changes in the free beta hCG to hCG ratio throughout their clinical course. We conclude that the production of free beta hCG increases with the immaturity of the trophoblastic cell, and the degree of differentiation of trophoblastic cells may be reflected by the free beta hCG to hCG ratio.\r"

  ".W": "Fibronectin (Fn) is a glycoprotein composed of two different subunits, each with a mol wt of approximately 230K. Fn is important for cell adhesion and for maintaining normal cell morphology. Recent in vivo studies suggested that thyroid hormone affects the plasma Fn level in man. The aim of this study was to determine whether T3 regulates the synthesis of Fn in cultured human skin fibroblasts. Skin fibroblasts obtained from seven normal subjects were grown in Minimum Essential Medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. After reaching confluence, the cells were exposed for 3 days to the same medium in which fetal calf serum was replaced by 10% thyroidectomized bovine serum without or with added T3. At the end of this period, the cultures were incubated with [35S]methionine (95 microCi/dish) for 4 h before harvesting. Cell lysates and corresponding media were combined, and 35S incorporation into total protein and Fn was determined by trichloroacetic acid precipitation and immunoprecipitation with antihuman Fn immunoglobulin, respectively. Analysis of the immunoprecipitated material by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed that most of the 35S activity migrated as a 230K band which was displaced by excess unlabeled Fn. Addition of T3 did not affect trichloroacetic acid-precipitable 35S activity but decreased the 35S activity precipitated with anti-Fn in a dose-dependent manner. While addition of 10(-10) M T3 to the medium had no effect, 35S incorporation into Fn was inhibited by 22.5 +/- 7.4% (mean +/- SD) with 10(-9) M T3 (free T3, 6 X 10(-12) M) and by 31.3 +/- 5.8% with 10(-7) M T3. To assess whether the inhibition of Fn accumulation by T3 was due to suppression of Fn synthesis or enhanced Fn degradation, cells were labeled for 4 h with [35S]methionine and chased for another 4 h with excess unlabeled methionine. T3 had no effect on the rate of decline of [35S]Fn during the chase. We conclude that physiologic T3 concentrations inhibit the synthesis of Fn in normal human fibroblasts. This effect provides a new method to study the action of thyroid hormone which may prove useful in the tissue diagnosis of resistance to thyroid hormone.\r"

The mean (+/- SEM) OT MCR was 16.4 +/- 1.7 ml/kg X min and was independent of the rate of infusion. A method for measuring OT in urine was developed using an octadecasilyl-silica column for extraction of the hormone. The extracted residue was reconstituted in potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, for RIA. The minimum detectable level of OT in urine was 0.2 microU/ml (defined as a bound to free ratio of approximately 90%). The mean recovery of OT was 77 +/- 2%. The mean (+/- SEM) concentration of endogenous OT in urine was 10.2 +/- 1.4 microU/ml. Endogenous OT in urine eluted from a reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography column as a single peak of OT immunoreactivity in the position of synthetic OT. Urinary OT excretion during infusion of synthetic OT was linearly correlated with plasma OT concentration whether calculated as microunits of urinary OT per mg creatinine (r = 0.89) or urinary OT per min (r = 0.93). Mean urinary fractional clearance of OT (OT clearance/creatinine clearance) was 3.6% renal clearance of OT (5.5 ml/min or 0.43% of MCR). Thus, OT MCR was constant over a wide range of physiological plasma OT levels and was similar to MCR in pregnant women studied previously in this laboratory. Less than 1% of OT was cleared in urine. This study defines the relationship between urinary and plasma OT during steady state infusion of physiological concentrations of the hormone and indicates that measurements of OT in urine by RIA may prove helpful for pharmacokinetic and physiological studies of OT-related events in humans.\r"

To test this hypothesis we investigated the interaction of plasma immunoglobulin G (IgG) with the binding sites of estrogen receptors (ER) from uterine or mammary tissue. Using ER isolated from uterine cytosol we found that IgG from normal subjects shifted the position of purified receptor in sucrose gradients and displaced [3H]estradiol (E2) from its receptor-binding sites. Equilibrium studies revealed competitive inhibition by IgG of E2 binding to the ER. IgG isolated by adsorption on a rat uterine cytosol-Blue B matrix gel column also bound to the ER, and this binding was inhibited by an excess of E2. After an 18-h exposure of MCF-7 mammary carcinoma cells in monolayer culture to IgG (2 mg/ml), Scatchard analysis of [3H]E2 binding revealed a reproducible decrease in the available receptor sites from 2.52 +/- 0.56 (+/- SEM) to 0.68 +/- 0.48 fmol/microgram DNA (n = 10). This effect was selective, since enriched anti-ER IgG obtained by adsorption on purified receptor was 20 times more potent than total IgG, whereas IgG identically prepared but not retained by affinity chromatography had no activity. Exposure of the cells to the IgG for 45 min also revealed, as with isolated ER, specific competition of the IgG with E2 for the E2-binding sites; the Kd increased from 10.5 +/- 1.6 to 27.5 +/- 7.2 X 10(-11) M (n = 7). Enriched antireceptor IgG was a 20 times more effective competitor, and the IgG not retained by affinity chromatography had no activity. In conclusion, our observations indicate the presence of ER on the cell surface, interaction of ER with IgG from plasma of normal subjects, and competitive antagonism of these IgG with E2 uptake leading to a decrease in effective ER concentrations.\r"

To do so, we measured serum total and free thyroid hormones and TSH, in addition to several serum markers of peripheral tissue response to thyroid status, in 21 hypothyroid patients treated with 50-micrograms increments of T4 to a maximum of 200 micrograms daily (group I) and in 104 clinically euthyroid patients receiving a long term constant replacement dose (group II). In group I patients, dose-dependent increases (P less than 0.05) in serum glutathione S-transferase, sex hormone-binding globulin, and angiotensin-converting enzyme occurred, whereas serum T4-binding globulin, creatine kinase, and creatinine levels decreased (P less than 0.05). In both patient groups, abnormally high levels of glutathione S-transferase, sex hormone-binding globulin, angiotensin-converting enzyme, alanine aminotransferase, and gamma-glutamyl transferase were found in some patients during treatment. One or more of these biochemical abnormalities suggestive of hyperthyroidism occurred in 15 (71%) group I patients and 27 (26%) group II patients. These were associated with an undetectable serum TSH (less than 0.1 microU/ml) and raised free T4 concentrations in 13, and raised free T3, T4, and T3 concentrations in only 8, 6, and 1 group I patients, respectively. In group II patients, they were more closely associated with an undetectable TSH (67%) or raised free T4 (85%) level than with raised concentrations of free T3 (33%), T4 (26%), or T3 (0%). The use of high sensitivity TSH assays will permit more accurate adjustment of T4 replacement and minimize abnormalities in peripheral tissue biochemistry indicative of overtreatment.\r"

  ".W": "Arginine vasopressin (AVP) was measured in the plasma and its ultrafiltrate in 11 patients with end-stage renal failure treated by hemofiltration. Nineteen liters of ultrafiltrate were produced in 170 min and continuously replaced by an isoosmotic substitution fluid to maintain constant body weight. Plasma and ultrafiltrate AVP concentrations were not significantly different and did not change with time. The AVP clearance rate due to hemofiltration was 114 +/- 2.6 (+/- SE) ml/min, which represented more than two thirds of the predicted MCR in these patients. Corrected plasma osmolality, body weight, mean blood pressure, hematocrit, and PRA did not change during the hemofiltration session. These results indicate that there is a compensatory increase in AVP production which maintains plasma AVP unchanged in response to the increased MCR resulting from hemofiltration. The responsible stimulus could be a direct effect of the decrease in plasma AVP on the AVP-secreting neurones. Alternatively, ultrafiltration itself, via the hemodynamic changes it produces or the loss of an unrecognized inhibitory substance, may be the stimulus to AVP secretion.\r"

This report documents exacerbation of a PRL-secreting tumor after two separate 200-mg testosterone enanthate (T) injections despite continued bromocriptine (BRC) therapy. A 37-yr-old man with a 60-mm invasive tumor and a serum PRL level of 13,969 +/- 332 ng/ml (mean +/- SD) responded to BRC therapy with rapid disappearance of visual field defect, headache, and facial pain as well as decrease in serum PRL to 5,103 +/- 1,446 ng/ml. T injection was followed by severe headache, facial pain, and increase in PRL to 13,471 ng/ml. Visual field deterioration and increased tumor size (height, 40-43 mm) by computed tomography were documented. A relationship between T injection and exacerbation of the prolactinoma was not recognized until after a second T injection 3 months later. After that therapy, baseline PRL increased from 6,900 to 12,995 ng/ml. The hypothesis that T was aromatized to estradiol, directly stimulating lactotrophs, was supported by an increase in serum estradiol from 24 to 51 pg/ml after the second T injection. Although T treatment is accepted as appropriate therapy for hypogonadism in men with prolactinomas, it may not only interfere with the response of the tumor to BRC therapy, but even stimulate tumor growth and secretion.\r"

Our results demonstrate a significant reduction in conduction velocity (0.78 +/- 0.38 vs. 0.31 +/- 0.12 m/s, P less than 0.001), space constant (1.05 +/- 0.42 vs. 0.45 +/- 0.12 mm, P = 0.004), resting membrane potential (81.3 +/- 2.5 vs. 61.7 +/- 7.8 mV, P less than 0.001), action potential amplitude (94.1 +/- 4.2 vs. 64.1 +/- 1.5 mV, P less than 0.001), and dV/dT (164.7 +/- 37.3 vs. 52.6 +/- 19.7 V/s, P less than 0.001) in postischemic reperfused myocardium.

Modulation of tissue factor (TF) and thrombomodulin (TM) expression on the endothelial surface may be relevant pathophysiologic mechanisms. Stimulation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells with endotoxin (1 microgram/ml) increased surface TF activity from 1.52 +/- 0.84 to 11.89 +/- 8.12 mU/ml-10(6) cells at 6 h (n = 11) which returned to baseline by 24 h. Repeated stimulation at 24 h resulted in renewed TF expression. Endotoxin (1 microgram/ml) also caused a decrease in TM expression to 55.0 +/- 6.4% of control levels at 24 h (n = 10) that remained depressed at 48 h. Both effects were dose and serum dependent. A temporary rise in TF expression accompanied by a sustained fall in TM expression comprise a shift in the hemostatic properties of the endothelium that would favor intravascular coagulation and may contribute to the pathogenesis of DIC in gram-negative septicemia.\r"

Urea permeability was measured in isolated perfused IMCDs dissected from carefully localized sites along the inner medullas of rats and rabbits. Mean permeability coefficients (X 10(-5) cm/s) in rat IMCDs were: outer third of inner medulla (IMCD1), 1.6 +/- 0.5; middle third (IMCD2), 46.6 +/- 10.5; and inner third (IMCD3), 39.1 +/- 3.6. Mean permeability coefficients in rabbit IMCDs were: IMCD1, 1.2 +/- 0.1; IMCD2, 11.6 +/- 2.8; and IMCD3, 13.1 +/- 1.8. The rabbit PSE was dissected free from the underlying renal inner medulla and was mounted in a specially designed chamber to measure its permeability to urea. The mean value was 1 X 10(-5) cm/s both in the absence and presence of vasopressin (10 nM). Morphometry of renal papillary cross sections revealed that the total surface area of IMCDs exceeds the total area of the PSE by 10-fold in the rat and threefold in the rabbit. We conclude: the IMCD displays axial heterogeneity with respect to urea permeability, with a high permeability only in its distal two-thirds; and because the urea permeability and surface area of the PSE are relatively small, passive transport across it is unlikely to be a major source of urea to the inner medullary interstitium.\r"

We found that a wide range of naturally occurring glycoproteins, including ovalbumins and ovomucoids from chicken and turkey eggs, and mucin derived from bovine submaxillary glands, inhibit the replication of rotaviruses in MA-104 cells. Our studies further indicated that the glycoproteins bind directly to rotaviruses and that virus-glycoprotein binding is dependent largely upon interactions with sialic acid oligosaccharides. We found that accessible sialic acid oligosaccharides are required for efficient rotavirus infection of MA-104 cells, thus demonstrating that sialic acid oligosaccharides play an important role in the interactions of rotaviruses with both glycoproteins and cells that support rotaviral replication. Bovine submaxillary mucin and chicken ovoinhibitor can also prevent the shedding of rotavirus antigen and the development of rotavirus gastroenteritis in a mouse model of rotavirus infection. Our findings document that a range of glycoproteins inhibit the in vivo and in vitro replication of rotaviruses and suggest that the alteration in the quantity or chemical composition of intestinal glycoproteins is a potential means for the modulation of enteric infections.\r"

However, recent observations support the existence of anatomically distinct, independently regulated renal 1 alpha-hydroxylase systems in mammalian proximal convoluted and straight tubules. To more completely define the extent of the 1 alpha-hydroxylase regulatory defect in Hyp-mice, we compared enzyme maximum velocity in normal and mutants after infusion of calcitonin. Upon stimulation, renal 1 alpha-hydroxylase activity increased to similar levels in normal and Hyp-mouse renal homogenates. Moreover, time-course and dose-dependence studies revealed similar patterns of response in the animal models. Subsequently, we examined whether PTH and calcitonin stimulatory effects on enzyme activity are mediated through different mechanisms. In both animal models administration of PTH and calcitonin increased enzyme activity to levels greater than those obtained after maximal stimulation by either hormone alone, consistent with additive effects. These observations indicate that a calcitonin-sensitive component of 1 alpha-hydroxylase is not compromised in the X-linked hypophosphatemic syndrome.\r"

During a cell-cell interaction between stimulated platelets and unstimulated neutrophils, platelet 12-HETE is metabolized to 12,20-dihydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12,20-DiHETE) by neutrophils. Characteristics of the enzyme system in unstimulated neutrophils responsible for this omega-hydroxylation were investigated. A broad range of cytochrome P-450 inhibitors, as well as leukotriene B4, blocked formation of 12,20-DiHETE. Owing largely to released proteases, neutrophil homogenization abolished activity. Pretreatment with diisopropylfluorophosphate preserved activity in neutrophil homogenates. omega-Hydroxylation of 12-HETE was confined solely to the microsomal fraction. Specific activity increased 6.6-fold compared with neutrophil sonicates. The electron donor NADPH was a required cofactor. These results indicate that the enzyme in unstimulated human neutrophils, which metabolizes 12-HETE from stimulated platelets to 12,20-DiHETE in this cell-cell interaction, is a cytochrome P-450 monooxygenase.\r"

In each experimental group, animals received either a control diet or a high potassium diet. In ADX animals with basal aldosterone levels, a high potassium intake increased but did not completely restore the ability to excrete potassium and induced proliferation of the basolateral membrane of principal cells in the collecting tubule (i.e., morphologic adaptation). In contrast, increased aldosterone did not induce functional adaptation. Elevated aldosterone and dietary potassium intake were required to produce functional potassium adaptation indistinguishable from that in potassium-loaded, adrenal-intact animals.\r"

Using monoclonal antibodies in both direct-binding studies and flow cytometry, we found that resting neutrophils (polymorphonuclear leukocytes [PMN]) expressed 10(4) DAF molecules on their surface, and that surface DAF expression more than doubled when the cells were activated. Upregulation of surface DAF occurred within minutes, paralleled the upregulation of complement receptor types 1 and 3 (CR1 and CR3), and was not dependent on new protein synthesis. It was unaffected by EDTA but was inhibited by 10 microM trifluoperazine, suggesting involvement of intracellular Ca2+ and calmodulin or protein kinase C. Upon activation, the affected PMN lacking surface DAF from patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobulinuria failed to increase DAF expression. In contrast, these cells increased CR1 and CR3 expression normally, suggesting that DAF deficiency in affected cells involves abnormal synthesis or packaging of DAF for intracellular storage. Translocation of DAF to the cell surface induced by chemoattractants may be important in allowing PMN to survive and function at inflammatory sites where there is rapid complement turnover.\r"

The increase in inositol triphosphate production was accompanied by a minor increase in inositol phosphate and no significant increase in inositol bisphosphate production. Associated with the changes in inositol triphosphate and diacylglycerol, there was an immediate hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4'5-bisphosphate. The effect on phospholipid hydrolysis was followed by stimulation of phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol 4' monophosphate and phosphatidylinositol. PTH produced a sudden increase in cytoplasmic Ca2+ in opossum kidney cells that persisted for approximately 1 min. Inositol triphosphate transiently increased cytoplasmic Ca2+ in saponin-treated opossum kidney and primary culture proximal tubule cells. The effects of PTH were not mimicked by cyclic nucleotides. In fact, cyclic AMP appeared to diminish inositol triphosphate production. These results demonstrate that PTH may activate renal tubular epithelial cells by the production of inositol triphosphate and diacylglycerol.\r"

There was no increase in HLA-DR3 on nonextended haplotypes or in other extended haplotypes with HLA-DR3 or DR7. The distribution of homozygotes and heterozygotes for HLA-DR3 and DR7 was consistent with recessive inheritance of the major histocompatibility complex-linked susceptibility gene for gluten-sensitive enteropathy. On the other hand, by odds ratio analysis and from the sum of DR3 and DR7 homozygotes compared with DR3/DR7 heterozygotes, there was an increase in heterozygotes and a decrease in homozygotes suggesting the presence of modifying phenomena.\r"

In the present paper, the relationship between SIRS production and nephrotic syndrome is further characterized. A striking correlation was found between detection of SIRS and the presence of steroid-responsive nephrotic syndrome (SRNS). A potential mechanism of SIRS production in SRNS patients was identified, in that lymphocytes from patients produced SIRS without requiring activation by exogenous agents, and incubation of normal lymphocytes with serum from patients activated the cells to secrete SIRS in culture. Although SIRS disappears rapidly from urine or serum after initiation of corticosteroid therapy, hydrocortisone (10(-6)-10(-7) M) did not block secretion of SIRS by activated suppressor cells. It did, however, inhibit in vitro activation of lymphocytes to produce SIRS by concanavalin A, interferon, or SRNS patient serum. The association of suppressor cell activation with SRNS and the sensitivity of both to steroids suggest that the pathogeneses of albuminuria and SIRS production are related.\r"

Ischemia without reperfusion blunted contractile reactivity to potassium chloride (KCl), whereas ischemia plus reperfusion augmented contractile responses to both KCl and ergonovine. The response to acetylcholine, an endothelium-dependent vasodilator, was abolished in reperfused arteries, whereas the response to nitroprusside, an endothelium-independent vasodilator, was intact. Verapamil pretreatment restored KCl contractile responses to normal in reperfused coronary rings and partially restored endothelium-dependent relaxation. Electron microscopy revealed a nondenuding epicardial coronary endothelial injury in reperfused arteries. These data support the hypothesis that reperfusion of ischemic myocardium augments reactivity to vasoconstrictor agents by causing endothelial cell damage, excessive calcium influx, and loss of modulating vasodilator function.\r"

Moreover, when the hormone was added to serumless cultures of 426 isolated single megakaryocytes derived from megakaryocytic colonies, erythropoietin induced a significant increase in the diameters of these cells.

  ".W": "To determine the role of dietary sodium intake in the reduction in beta-adrenergic sensitivity in hypertension, lymphocyte beta-receptors from 8 borderline hypertensive and 16 normotensive subjects were studied after 5 d on a high sodium diet (400 meq/d) and also following a low sodium diet (10 meq/d). During the high sodium diet, lymphocyte beta-receptor-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity, expressed as the relative increase over basal levels stimulated by the beta-agonist isoproterenol, was significantly (P less than 0.025) decreased in hypertensive (24 +/- 5%, mean +/- SE) compared with normotensive (42 +/- 4%) subjects. Neither beta-receptor density nor the proportion of nonsequestered beta-receptors differed between groups. A low sodium diet significantly increased beta-receptor-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity in hypertensives (low sodium, 51 +/- 7%; high sodium, 24 +/- 5%, P less than 0.025) to a level not different than that of normotensives (46 +/- 5%). Thus, reduced lymphocyte beta-receptor responsiveness in hypertensive subjects is not due to beta-receptor sequestration and is corrected on a low sodium diet. Dietary sodium may be an important factor in the beta-receptor defect in early hypertension.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) on the expression of uncoupling protein (UCP) in rat brown adipose tissue (BAT) has been examined. Thyroidectomized rats have a threefold reduction in basal UCP levels. When exposed to cold, they become hypothermic and show a fivefold lower response of UCP than euthyroid controls. T3 augments the basal levels and the response of UCP and its mRNA to cold in a dose-dependent manner. However, to normalize the response of UCP, T3 has to be given in a dosage that produces systemic hyperthyroidism. Mere T3 replacement corrects the systemic hypothyroidism but not the hypothermia or the low levels of UCP. In contrast, replacement doses of T4 prevent the hypothermia and correct the UCP level. Both effects of T4 are blocked by preventing T4 to T3 conversion in BAT. Thus, the optimal UCP response to cold and protection against hypothermia require a high BAT T3 concentration, which is attained from euthyroid levels of T4 via the activation of the BAT T4 5'deiodinase during cold exposure, but not from euthyroid plasma T3 levels.\r"

The protein has an inferred mol wt 6,080 that is in agreement with its apparent monomeric mol wt 6,000, estimated previously by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Phospholamban contains two distinct domains, a hydrophilic region at the amino terminus (domain I) and a hydrophobic region at the carboxy terminus (domain II). We propose that domain I is localized at the cytoplasmic surface and offers phosphorylatable sites whereas domain II is anchored into the sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane.\r"

We tested whether this transport mechanism participates in active NaCl reabsorption in the rabbit proximal tubule. In proximal tubule S2 segments perfused with low HCO-3 solutions, the addition of formate (0.25-0.5 mM) to the lumen and the bath increased volume reabsorption (JV) by 60%; the transepithelial potential difference remained unchanged. The effect of formate on JV was completely reversible and was inhibited both by ouabain and by luminal 4,4'-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulfonate. Formate (0.5 mM) failed to stimulate JV in early proximal convoluted tubules perfused with high HCO-3 solutions. As measured by miniature glass pH microelectrodes, this lack of formate effect on JV was related to a less extensive acidification of the tubule fluid when high HCO-3 solutions were used as perfusate. These data suggest that chloride/formate exchange with recycling of formic acid by nonionic diffusion represents a mechanism for active, electroneutral NaCl reabsorption in the proximal tubule.\r"

Compound heterozygotes for each deletion had intermediate values. Although deletion forms of alpha 0 thalassemia were not found in this survey, nondeletion alpha-thalassemia was present at low frequency. Since the predominant rightward deletion in this population, -alpha 3.7III, entirely removes the alpha 1-gene and the 4.2-kilobase deletion deletes the alpha 2-gene, these data indicate that the alpha 2-globin gene has a higher output than the alpha 1-gene, on single alpha-gene chromosomes.\r"

In the present study, we investigated whether the airway epithelial defect was in the cell path by characterizing the relative ion permeabilities of the apical membrane of respiratory epithelial cells from CF and normal subjects. Membrane electric potential difference (PD) and the responses to luminal Cl- replacement, isoproterenol, and amiloride were measured with intracellular microelectrodes. The PD across the apical barrier was smaller for CF (-11 mV) than normal (-29 mV) epithelia whereas the PD across the basolateral barrier was similar, (-26 and -34 mV respectively). In contrast to normal nasal epithelium, the apical membrane in CF epithelia was not Cl- permselective and was not responsive to isoproterenol. Amiloride, a selective Na+ channel blocker, induced a larger apical membrane hyperpolarization and a greater increase in transepithelial resistance in CF epithelia. Both reduced apical cell membrane Cl- conductance and increased Na+ conductance appear to contribute to the abnormal function of respiratory epithelia of CF patients.\r"

Thus, quantitative bone histology and measurements of bone formation were done at three skeletal sites in piglets given aluminum (Al) parenterally, 1.5 mg/kg per d, for 8 wk (Al, n = 4) and in control animals (C, n = 4). Bone Al was 241 +/- 40 mg/kg per dry weight in Al and 1.6 +/- 0.9 in C, P less than 0.001. All Al-treated animals developed osteomalacia with increases in osteoid seam width, osteoid volume, and mineralization lag time at each skeletal site, P less than 0.05 vs. C for all values. Mineralized bone formation at the tissue level was lower in Al than in C, P less than 0.05 for each skeletal site, due to reductions in active bone forming surface. Bone formation at the cellular level was similar in each group, however, and total osteoid production by osteoblasts did not differ in C and Al. Aluminum impairs the formation of mineralized bone in vivo by decreasing the number of active osteoblasts, and this change can be distinguished from the effect of aluminum to inhibit, either directly or indirectly, the calcification of osteoid.\r"

Abnormal mitoses seemed to be a good indicator of CIN and were present in about 50% of cases of CIN associated with either HPV 6 or HPV 16 infection. This finding provides no support for the view held by some investigators that associated HPV 16 infection can be predicted by the presence of abnormal mitoses. Expression of HPV antigen was shown in about 40% of cases with a slight, but not significantly, higher prevalence in cases of combined HPV 6 and HPV 16 infection. Conventional histology and immunocytochemistry could not distinguish CIN associated with HPV 6 from CIN associated with HPV 16 infection.\r"

Intimal area was measured and artery size defined as total length of internal elastic lamina (IEL). Intimal abnormality was expressed in the form of an intima index calculated by dividing intimal area by the area enclosed by the IEL in its theoretically unwrinkled state. Mean intima indices were calculated for arteries in four size groups: less than or equal to 600 micron, 601-1200 micron, 1201-1800 micron and greater than 1800 micron length of IEL. For all subjects intimal abnormality was most severe in the smallest muscular pulmonary arteries; values for mean intima indices decreased with increasing size of artery. There were no lobar differences. The amount of intimal abnormality increases with age in all sizes of artery: in the 600 micron size group this could average a 32% reduction in lumen calibre in those aged 60 or more. We were unable to detect any correlation between intimal abnormality and the subject's smoking history.\r"

Both ventricles were affected by confluent granulomas with an ill defined patchy appearance. Histologically these lesions consisted of round cells, histiocytes, eosinophils and myogenic giant cells. The findings were compatible with those of interstitial myocarditis associated with a proliferation of giant cells. Both atriums were also affected to a minor extent, detectable only by histological examination. Electron microscopy and cytochemistry showed that most giant cells noted in the lesion showed myofibrils and primary lysosomes in the cytoplasm. Giant cells were positive for myoglobin. Though the macrophage origin of the giant cell in this disorder has been emphasised in a recent report, these cytological results suggest that giant cells observed in the cardiac granulomatous lesions of this case were mainly myogenic in origin.\r"

Ex-alcohol users who were much older than current alcohol users had lower systolic and diastolic blood pressures. The association of body mass index with sustained raised blood pressure was apparent. When body mass index was eliminated as a variable there was an appreciable residual effect on mean arterial pressure. Alcohol users and controls did not differ in mean plasma sodium concentration. Red blood cell intracellular sodium concentration, however, was higher in beer drinkers than in controls. On the other hand, red blood cell intracellular concentration of magnesium in beer drinkers was decreased. It is suggested that definite interactions between sodium, magnesium, and calcium ions may have some vital roles in the sustained rise in blood pressure in alcohol users.\r"

The severity of the coronary stenosis decreased significantly at each evaluation; the mean diameter stenosis was 66 +/- 13% before angioplasty, 30 +/- 13% immediately after and 26 +/- 16% and 19 +/- 13% at 6 months and 3 years, respectively. Exercise time increased from 9.8 +/- 4.4 minutes before angioplasty to 18.3 +/- 4.5 minutes immediately after the procedure and remained at that level at 6 months (20.3 +/- 4.6 minutes) and 3 years (18.2 +/- 4.5 minutes). Left ventricular ejection fraction during exercise decreased 4 +/- 6% compared with rest before angioplasty, but increased 7 +/- 7% immediately after angioplasty and this increase was maintained at 6 months (+/- 6 +/- 7%) and 3 years (+/- 4 +/- 6%). Before angioplasty, 1 patient was in Canadian Heart Association functional class 0, 15 were in class II, 24 in class III and 6 in class IV. Three years later, 25 were in class 0, 10 in class I, 7 in class II and 4 in class III. These results indicate that the short-term anatomic and functional success of coronary angioplasty is maintained for at least 3 years.\r"

The device consisted of a round sapphire probe (2.2 mm diameter) attached to an 8F catheter into which a 0.2 mm optical fiber was inserted with a tip maintained at 3 mm from the sapphire. The fiber was connected to a continuous wave neodymium yttrium aluminum garnet (Nd-YAG) laser. A saline perfusate was circulated through the catheter during laser emissions to prevent excessive heating of the fiber tip. The system was used in vitro on 16 sections of atherosclerotic calcified human cadaver aortic walls, using diluted blood as a medium, at powers ranging from 10 to 40 W and exposure times from 1 to 4 seconds. Six craters were created at each energy level. The system was also used on six human cadaver, agar-embedded, obstructed iliac and femoral arteries, using 40 W and 2 second laser emissions. Dimensions of probe-created craters were compared with those obtained using bare fibers. The shape of the probe craters was that of a truncated cone with the entry hole wider than the exit, as opposed to the cylindrical shape created with unmodified bare fibers. At 120 J (seconds X watts), areas of entry and exit probe-formed holes were greater than those created with the bare fibers (6.7 +/- 0.5 and 3.4 +/- 0.6 versus 0.2 +/- 0.01 mm2, respectively, p less than 0.001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Myocardial thallium-201 kinetics and regional blood flow alterations were examined in a canine model using 3 hours of coronary occlusion and different methods of reperfusion. Group I comprised 10 dogs undergoing a 3 hour left anterior descending artery occlusion and no reperfusion. Group II comprised seven dogs undergoing 3 hours of left anterior descending artery occlusion and rapid reperfusion through a totally patent vessel. Group III comprised 10 dogs undergoing 3 hours of left anterior descending artery occlusion and slow reperfusion through a residual stenosis. All dogs received 1.5 mCi of thallium-201 after 40 minutes of coronary occlusion. During occlusion and 2 hours of reperfusion, serial hemodynamic, blood flow and myocardial thallium-201 activity measurements were made. The relative thallium-201 gradient (normal zone minus ischemic zone activity when initial normal activity is expressed as 100%) during left anterior descending coronary occlusion was similar in all groups. Group I, 87 +/- 3%; Group II, 78 +/- 6%; Group III, 83 +/- 6% (p = NS). After 2 hours of either method of reperfusion, the final relative gradient had decreased to a similar level (Group II, 51 +/- 9%; Group III, 42 +/- 6%). These values were not significantly different from the final relative thallium-201 gradient seen in dogs undergoing a sustained 3 hour occlusion (Group I, 55 +/- 5%). After 2 hours of reperfusion, both methods of reflow were associated with similar degrees of \"no reflow.\" Transmural flows in the central ischemic zone were 89 +/- 10% of normal in Group II and 71 +/- 6% of normal in Group III after reperfusion, with both flows substantially higher than the relative thallium-201 activities in these dogs. Infarct size (percent of left ventricle) determined with triphenyltetrazolium chloride was similar in all groups (Group I, 24 +/- 4%; Group II, 29 +/- 4%; Group III, 25 +/- 4%). Thus, in this experimental canine model, 3 hours of coronary occlusion followed by either rapid reperfusion through a totally patent vessel or slow reperfusion through a critical stenosis resulted in little delayed thallium-201 redistribution or myocardial salvage as assessed histologically, despite significant recovery of regional flow.\r"

  ".W": "To assess the potential of in vivo nuclear magnetic resonance imaging for the detection of reperfused myocardium, in vivo T2-weighted spin echo images were obtained of dogs at 0.15 tesla. Imaging was done during 3 hours of coronary occlusion (group I), and during 3 hours of coronary occlusion followed by 1 hour of reperfusion (group II). On sacrifice, the hearts were drained of blood and imaged in situ to determine the effect of in vivo imaging on myocardial signal intensity. The hearts were then excised and imaged at 1.4 tesla to compare the effect of high resolution imaging on image quality. Of the six hearts in group I and the eight hearts in group II with a myocardial infarction and suitable image quality, four of the former hearts and six of the latter demonstrated a small but visible increase in infarct signal intensity at 3 hours of occlusion on the time to echo [TE] = 60 ms, single echo images. The T2 (transverse) relaxation time of the infarct (measured in vitro by spectrometer) increased by 13% when compared with normal tissue. In contrast, the reperfused infarct was more easily visualized, with signal intensity increasing by 31 +/- 17% and infarct T2 increasing by 20%. Imaged at 1.4 tesla, the excised hearts showed the infarct to be subendocardial during occlusion and extending transmurally with reperfusion. It is concluded that, although visualized, the increase in infarct signal intensity at 3 hours of coronary occlusion is small and this is consistent with the small increase in infarct signal intensity and T2 relaxation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

End-systolic relations between left ventricular pressure and volume and between pressure and wall thickness were analyzed in dogs previously instrumented with ultrasonic crystals. Progressive angiotensin infusions were used to generate computer-averaged pressure-volume and pressure-wall thickness loops. Both relations were linear in every study and highly reproducible. With low and high dose dobutamine, the end-systolic pressure-volume relations were significantly displaced, with increased slope and inconsistent changes in intercept. This relation was more useful than the ejection fraction for detecting contractility increases at different afterloads, but it showed no advantage over maximal left ventricular dP/dt at all ranges of preload and afterload. The end-systolic pressure-volume relations were insensitive for detecting mild decreases in inotropic state produced by propranolol, and maximal dP/dt was superior for detecting such mild acutely reduced contractility. The end-systolic pressure-wall thickness relations showed displacement with dobutamine, although slope and intercept changes were not significant; these relations did not detect mild decreases in contractility produced by propranolol. It is concluded that the end-systolic pressure-volume relation and a simplified end-systolic measure using pressure and wall thickness provide sensitive, load-independent and reproducible approaches for defining acute increases in left ventricular contractility in conscious animals. Maximal dP/dt was equally effective for defining these increases in contractility and more sensitive for detecting slight acute decreases in contractility.\r"

  ".W": "Ventricular arrhythmias generally result in a decrease in arterial pressure and increases in atrial and ventricular filling pressures which would be expected to induce reflex changes in efferent sympathetic nerve activity to the heart and peripheral circulation. Experiments were performed in 14 anesthetized dogs in order to determine whether programmed ventricular stimulation produces changes in renal sympathetic nerve activity; quantitate these changes; and determine the cardiovascular reflexes that mediate these changes. Arterial and right atrial pressures and renal sympathetic nerve activity were recorded in dogs before and after administration of single and double programmed ventricular stimuli. In a group of 10 dogs after single extrastimuli, diastolic arterial pressure decreased by 18 +/- 2 mm Hg (mean +/- SEM) while renal sympathetic nerve activity increased by 39 +/- 15 impulses/s. These changes were directly related to degree of stimulus prematurity. After double extrastimuli, diastolic arterial pressure decreased by 22 +/- 2 mm Hg whereas renal sympathetic activity increased by 55 +/- 8 impulses/s. In an additional four dogs, double extrastimuli decreased arterial pressure (-34 +/- 1 mm Hg) and increased cardiac (86 +/- 16%) and renal (82 +/- 12%) sympathetic traffic. After sinoaortic denervation, neither single nor double programmed ventricular stimuli resulted in alterations in cardiac or renal sympathetic nerve activity. It is concluded that the decreased arterial pressure caused by single and double programmed ventricular stimuli leads to increases in cardiac and renal sympathetic nerve activity that are mediated by sinoaortic baroreflexes.\r"

Amiodarone was judged effective in, respectively, 51 of 74, 44 of 51, 51 of 64 and 61 of 73 patients by criterion I, II, III or IV. During the follow-up period (19 +/- 20 months), there were 19 instances of recurrence of ventricular arrhythmia or sudden death.

The group of 68 men and 31 women was followed up for an average of 27 months (range 3 to 60). There were no differences in age, sex, dose of amiodarone, type or severity of underlying heart disease or baseline serum thyroxine levels in patients who developed hypothyroidism (n = 32) or hyperthyroidism (n = 5) or remained euthyroid (n = 62). Baseline serum thyrotropin levels were statistically higher in patients who became hypothyroid, but there was considerable overlap with the other patient groups. Serum reverse triiodothyronine (reverse T3), which has been suggested to be a marker of amiodarone efficacy, correlated directly with serum thyroxine levels, and was not an independent variable. There was no pattern to the time course for development of thyroid dysfunction, which occurred in 49% of those followed up and developed as early as 1 month or, in one individual, as late as after 3 years of amiodarone therapy. There are few guidelines for replacement therapy in patients with amiodarone-induced hypothyroidism. L-thyroxine dosage was adjusted cautiously in these high risk individuals to achieve serum thyroxine levels within the reference range of euthyroid individuals taking amiodarone: the mean dosage required was 136 micrograms/day. Normalization of serum thyrotropin (TSH) would have required doses of L-thyroxine that were judged to be excessively high.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "To determine whether impaired diastolic function may be an early sign of doxorubicin cardiotoxicity, a retrospective study was performed in 12 patients who had undergone serial radionuclide angiography and were found to have a left ventricular ejection fraction of 55% or more before doxorubicin (Adriamycin) treatment and during follow-up. Average rapid filling velocity and slow filling velocity were both significantly reduced after doxorubicin treatment. Rapid filling velocity decreased from 5.17 +/- 1.52 to 4.18 +/- 0.96 units/s (p less than 0.01), and slow filling velocity decreased from 2.20 +/- 1.32 to 1.42 +/- 0.62 units/s (p less than 0.05). There were no significant changes in filling volume ratio, total diastolic time or diastolic time ratio. Because a change in left ventricular diastolic function can occur before ejection fraction falls to subnormal levels, diastolic function as well as systolic function should be examined for the early detection of doxorubicin cardiotoxicity. The clinical implications of our observations can only be established by a longer-term prospective analysis of left ventricular function in patients receiving doxorubicin therapy.\r"

Plasma samples were obtained before and every 15 minutes during the infusion of streptokinase and after completion of the therapy. Streptokinase dosage in this study was 211,000 +/- 88,000 IU (+/- SD). The average time from the onset of symptoms to the start of infusion was 2 hours 50 minutes (range 1 hour 10 minutes to 3 hours 30 minutes). Reperfusion occurred in six patients and temporary recanalization in three; in three patients no recanalization was achieved. Fibrinolytic assays of pretreatment plasma samples revealed elevated levels of plasminogen activators, presumably caused by the release of tissue-type plasminogen activator after a condition of stress. Plasminogen concentrations decreased from 94 +/- 17% to 44 +/- 30%. Alpha 2-antiplasmin fell from 84 +/- 27% to 12 +/- 19%; in seven patients no plasmin inhibitor activity was measurable at the completion of the infusion. Free plasmin occurred in samples only when this inhibitor had disappeared. This resulted in a lytic state leading to degradation of fibrinogen, the levels of which fell from 2.9 +/- 0.7% to 1.5 +/- 1.1%. Fibrinogen degradation products, measured in plasma with monoclonal antibodies, increased exponentially during streptokinase infusion in at least four patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Acute rupture of the chordae tendineae of myxomatous mitral valve was diagnosed as the cause of the cardiac arrest. Mitral valve replacement was performed and the patient made an uneventful recovery. This report describes the first known case of rupture of a myxomatous mitral valve presenting as sudden cardiac death. The differential diagnosis of sudden death in this disorder is reviewed, the role of mechanical circulatory assistance in refractory cardiac arrest is discussed and several interesting hemodynamic aspects of the case are considered.\r"

A St. Jude Medical cardiac valve was placed in 33 patients ranging in age from 2.5 months to 17 years. Seven patients were less than 1 year of age. Nineteen valves were placed in the aortic position in patients aged 5 months to 17 years (mean 9.5 years). Five patients had valve replacement only, 13 had concomitant aortoventriculoplasty and 1 a Manouguian procedure. Indications for anulus enlarging procedures were recurrent subaortic stenosis or inability to place an adult-sized valve in the native aortic anulus, or both. There were no early or late deaths. Fourteen valves were placed in the mitral position. They were anular positioned in 6 patients aged 6 months to 16 years and supraanular positioned in 8 patients aged 2.5 months to 2 years. There were no deaths with the anular positioned replacements and seven deaths (two early and five late) with the supraanular positioned replacements. Four of the five late deaths were associated with marked pre- and postoperative left ventricular dysfunction. The follow-up time was 784 patient-months in 31 long-term survivors. Anticoagulation was achieved with warfarin, usually in combination with sulfinpyrazone, dipyridamole or aspirin. There were four episodes of thromboembolism, three occurring in patients with suboptimal anticoagulation, and one in a patient lost to follow-up.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

This slow dissemination may be partly explained by the varying success of these ultrasound methods in determining accurate left ventricular stroke volume. The purpose of this study was to improve the simplicity and accuracy of Doppler stroke volume determination so that it could be more easily applied to patient management. Stroke volume was measured using the product of the integral of aortic velocity obtained by continuous wave Doppler technique and the M-mode tracing of the aortic valve, validating the data against cardiac output obtained by thermodilution technique in 41 patients (r = 0.95, SEE = 7 cc). Intra- and interobserver variability was between 9 and 11%. The results of different sampling sites and the temporal relation between Doppler and thermodilution measurements were also studied. Analysis of 21 patients who had M-mode and two-dimensional echocardiographic studies of the aortic root revealed that the method using M-mode measurement of aortic valve area was most accurate in determining left ventricular stroke volume (r = 0.94, SEE = 10 cc), stroke volume being overestimated when area measurements of the ascending aorta were used. In conclusion, maximal ascending aortic velocity determined by continuous wave Doppler echocardiography with M-mode measurement of aortic valve area can be used to calculate left ventricular stroke volume and cardiac output. The simplicity and practicality of this method should enhance the clinical application of Doppler echocardiography as a noninvasive monitoring technique.\r"

In the subgroup of 23 patients who had no prior myocardial infarction or left bundle branch block and were not taking digitalis, thallium scintigraphy had a sensitivity of 80% versus 50% for exercise electrocardiography. Scintigraphy yielded a sensitivity of 84, 74 and 90% for one, two and three vessel disease, respectively. Noninvasive arm ergometry exercise-thallium imaging testing appears to be reliable and useful and should be considered in the evaluation of coronary artery disease in patients with lower limb impairment.\r"

  ".W": "Orthodromic tachycardia is the most common arrhythmia in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. It is often initiated during incremental ventricular pacing that requires the onset of retrograde block along the normal pathway (that is, atrioventricular [AV] node-His-Purkinje system) with concomitant retrograde atrial activation by way of the accessory pathway. However, the site of retrograde block, that is, the AV node versus the His-Purkinje system, during incremental ventricular pacing and, hence, the mechanism of orthodromic tachycardia initiation have not been systematically elucidated. The mechanisms of orthodromic tachycardia induction were studied in 17 patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome using a specially designed pacing protocol. A beat by beat analysis indicated that the retrograde His-Purkinje system block was the most common initiating mechanism of orthodromic tachycardia in 14 of the 17 cases. In two cases, AV node block preceded the onset of orthodromic tachycardia, whereas the data in the remaining case suggested that both mechanisms were operative but at different pacing cycle lengths. The orthodromic tachycardia induction with His-Purkinje system block occurred within the first two cycles in most cases. When orthodromic tachycardia initiation was delayed beyond the first two cycles of the ventricular train it represented either a 2:1 block in the His-Purkinje system; a linking phenomenon in the His-Purkinje system; or a block in the AV node. These data have methodologic, mechanistic and therapeutic implications for patients with the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome.\r"

The committee also developed a simplified meal planning tool, Healthy Food Choices, to be used for initial or \"survival\" level education. In poster format, foods are grouped by calories into six food groups. Approximate portion sizes of commonly used foods are listed. Blank lines are provided for the nutrition counselor to write in a suggested menu or meal plan for the client.

A survey instrument listing techniques related to changing behavior, the counseling process, and content of teaching was developed and mailed to 500 members of the ADA Diabetes Care and Education Practice Group. Responses were received from 39% of the sample. For a majority of techniques, data analysis showed statistical association between frequency of use, perceived importance, and adequacy of practitioner training. Dietitians regularly used only 40% of the cited techniques related to changing behavior and the counseling process, but they said most of the items were important. Only half of the items related to the content of teaching were rated as important, and dietitians felt prepared to use only 70% of them. Most dietitians did not teach concepts related to glucose utilization, energy metabolism, and the metabolic role of insulin in diabetes. Those findings suggest that dietitians do not regularly use many techniques considered effective in obtaining dietary adherence of patients with diabetes. Since other studies show compliance is directly influenced by skills of the provider, dietitians could improve cost-effective health care by developing further professional expertise in the area of counseling patients with diabetes.\r"

The questionnaire estimates of mean nutrient intake were within 10% of the mean diet record measurements for 11 of the 18 nutrients evaluated, and the difference was less than 25% for all but one nutrient (total vitamin A). Correlation coefficients comparing unadjusted nutrient intakes measured by the two methods ranged from 0.38 (vitamin C) to more than 0.65 (total calories, total fat, saturated fat, polyunsaturated fat, oleic acid, and cholesterol). The overall mean of correlation coefficients comparing intakes of the 18 nutrients measured by questionnaire and by diet record was 0.60. Coefficients for macronutrients decreased somewhat after adjustment for age and gender or caloric intake. The data provide further evidence that a simple and relatively inexpensive questionnaire can provide useful information on dietary intake over an extended period.\r"

Phenyl-Free at concentrations greater than 10 kcal/oz yielded high osmolalities that exceeded the recommended level for infants. Lofenalac, Low Phe/Tyr Diet Powder, and MSUD Diet Powder at concentrations up to but no greater than 20 kcal/oz exerted osmolalities acceptable for use with infants. Low Methionine Diet Powder produced the lowest osmolality of the products tested. Differences among products can be explained by the formulations of the products, with sources of nitrogen and carbohydrate and percents of protein, carbohydrate, and fat considered. Carbohydrate type significantly affected formula osmolality; differences among carbohydrate sources can be attributed to their molecular sizes. Formulas that contained glucose exerted the highest osmolalities, while those with corn syrup or sucrose yielded the next highest. Protein Free Diet Powder, Polycose, and Moducal exerted reasonably low osmolalities.\r"

The influence of peritonitis on the nutritional status of CAPD patients was evaluated. Fourteen end-stage renal disease patients being treated with CAPD and presenting with peritonitis were randomized to one group with and one without a nutritional supplement. Four CAPD patients without peritonitis served as controls. Anthropometric measurements, laboratory determinations, dietary protein intake, and protein catabolic rate were obtained. The control group lost an average of 9.6 gm protein per 24 hours in the peritoneal fluid vs. an average of 15.1 gm protein per 24 hours lost by patients with peritonitis (p less than .01). Serum albumin did not decrease except in two diabetic patients in whom it dropped an average of 42% and remained low. Nitrogen balance remained positive in all patients except one with diabetes who had very low daily protein intake and caloric intake. The catabolism produced by short uncomplicated peritonitis did not create a negative nitrogen balance in patients eating at least 1 gm protein per kilogram ideal body weight (IBW) and 25 kcal/kg IBW.\r"

One effort to achieve improvements in these two areas was the development of a structured learning experience recently field tested with undergraduate dietetics students and clinical dietitians during clinical rotations. The structured experience defined roles, responsibilities, and activities for students, clinical dietitians, and course instructors and included scheduled review meetings attended by all participants. It was implemented with nine students during pediatric rotations. At the end of the course, students completed a standardized course evaluation form to assess course content, educational strategies, and effectiveness. They also rated the structured rotation, unstructured rotations, and their \"ideal\" rotation on 16 instructional factors. Clinical dietitians were interviewed by the course coordinator to elicit reactions and commitment to future participation. When it was compared with the traditional, non-structured approach utilized in surgery, gastroenterology, obesity/diabetes, and cardiovascular disease rotations, the structured learning experience received superior evaluations by participating students and dietitians. Correlations between ratings of structured, non-structured, and \"ideal\" approaches indicated directions for further educational and managerial improvements.\r"

Three-day food records were analyzed for calories, protein, vitamin A, vitamin C, thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, calcium, phosphorus, and iron. Symptoms of anorexia nervosa were determined through the use of an objective questionnaire, the Eating Attitudes Test (EAT). The percent of subjects who consumed less than two-thirds of the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for energy was significantly higher in the dance group (28.6% vs. 10.3%, p less than .005). Seventy percent of the total study population consumed less than two-thirds of the RDA for at least one nutrient, and 24% consumed less than two-thirds of the RDA for three or more nutrients. Thirty-three percent of the dancers and 13.8% of the controls scored in the range symptomatic of anorexia nervosa on the EAT, a difference that was statistically significant (p less than .005). The results indicate that both female university dancers and female university students may be at risk for nutrient deficiency and anorexia nervosa.\r"

The PT and POW of fallers were significantly decreased for all four muscle groups in comparison to controls, with the ankles showing the greatest decrements. Although POW in fallers was significantly lower at the higher velocity in both joints, the decrease was most prominent in the ankles. Dorsiflexion POW production in fallers was the most affected of all the motions (7.5 times less than the control value). At the higher, more functional limb velocities, ankle weakness particularly involving the dorsiflexors appears to be an important factor underlying poor balance.\r"

Increased incidence of myocardial infarction appeared to be influenced by testosterone in a threshold manner, since the incidence did not rise further with lesser testosterone levels once the level was below 438 ng/dl. The incidence of myocardial infarction among patients with testosterone levels below this threshold was unaffected by their exposure to alcohol. Among the 21 formerly heavy drinkers, many (62%) showed testosterone levels less than or equal to 300 ng/dl. Formerly heavy drinkers should be routinely considered for serum testosterone determination.\r"

Clinicians considering using a variety of assessment instruments should carefully consider their goals for data collection and carefully review the validity, reliability, and population sampled for any assessment instruments under consideration.

The indexes measured the level of residential segregation of persons 65 and older, 65 to 74 and 75 and older. Results indicated a significantly higher level of segregation for persons 75 and older than persons 65 to 74 in both 1970 and 1980. The difference in the level of residential segregation between persons 65 to 74 and 75 and older significantly increased from 1970 to 1980. When measured as a single age group aged 65 and above, there was no significant change in the level of residential segregation from 1970 to 1980. This result indicates that failure to disaggregate the elderly population into two distinct age groups would have resulted in missing changes in the level and trend of residential segregation among the elderly population.\r"
