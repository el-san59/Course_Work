  ".W": "The effects of pulsatile and nonpulsatile perfusion on local cerebral blood flow (CBF) and on computerized mapping (CME) of electroencephalograms (EEG) in nonischemic and ischemic brain were studied using a canine stroke model. Nine anesthetized mongrel dogs were placed on normothermic right atrial-femoral artery cardiopulmonary bypass at a flow of 100 ml/kg/minute. Local CBF measurements and CME data were collected during nonpulsatile perfusion and maximal pulsatile perfusion. The stroke model was then produced, and local CBF measurements and CME data were again collected during nonpulsatile and pulsatile perfusion. In the nonischemic brain, local CBF increased 19%, from 32 +/- 10 to 38 +/- 11 ml/100 g/minute (P less than 0.01), when perfusion was changed from nonpulsatile flow (pulse pressure less than 4mm Hg) to pulsatile flow (pulse pressure 39 +/- 11 mm Hg). In the ischemic brain, local CBF increased 55%, from 11 +/- 5 to 17 +/- 7 ml/100 g/minute (P less than 0.01), when perfusion was changed from nonpulsatile (pulse pressure less than 3 mm Hg) to pulsatile (pulse pressure 36 +/- 7) flow. EEG power data, expressed as a power ratio index (PRI = low frequency power/high frequency power), improved significantly, from 110 +/- 33 to 101 +/- 41 (P less than 0.01) with pulsatile perfusion. These data demonstrate the importance of pulsatile blood flow in ischemic brain.\r"

Using both interview data and mean data from the Sickness Impact Profile questionnaire, impaired quality of life was observed in the areas of psychosocial functioning, social role functioning, leisure activities, and, to a lesser extent, physical functioning, during chronic phases of recovery. Relatives and close friends reported by means of the Katz Adjustment Scale that the CHI patients showed a series of negative behavioral symptoms 2 to 4 years postinjury. These data suggest that CHI patients may experience impaired quality of life in a number of domains well beyond the acute postinjury phases. An attempt was also made to compare patients' and relatives' reports of patient quality of life. Preliminary analyses indicated modest correspondence between relatives' and patients' ratings of some areas of postinjury dysfunction, including cognitive and behavioral slowing and social withdrawal.\r"

  ".U": "87065552\r", 
  ".W": "Testing of potential therapies for spinal cord injury has been significantly hampered by the unavailability of a standardized, reproducible animal model with predictable outcome at a given force of injury (dose-response). The rat was selected in the development of this model in preference to larger animals for economy and availability; this permits use of large numbers of animals to increase statistical validity. In the experiments reported in this article, a static load method (weight placed gently on cord) of inducing cord injury was evaluated. A total of 198 Sprague-Dawley rats were used. Under general anesthesia, a one-level laminectomy was carried out at T-12 with the dura mater intact. Weights varying from 80 to 150 g were lowered onto the dorsal surface of the intact dura mater for durations of 0 to 300 seconds. Recovery of motor function was assessed for up to 8 weeks using two behavioral tests, a modified Tarlov scale and an inclined plane test of hind limb motor function. A statistically significant relationship was found between force of injury and motor recovery as measured by the Tarlov scale, but this did not correlate with inclined plane performance; the duration that the weight rested on the cord did not influence outcome. Pathologically, there was variation in the extent of damage for a given injury load. A semiquantitative pathological assessment of cord injury showed a statistically significant correlation between pathological score and behavioral deficit as measured by the Tarlov scale, but this did not correlate with inclined plane performance. In view of these deficiencies, the static load technique does not seem to be an ideal model for spinal cord injury research.\r"

The model is based on experimental data generated from an investigation of the static-load technique of inducing cord injury and was derived using multiple linear regression. The regression coefficients for weight of the injury-producing load were statistically significant (P less than 0.001), and it was found that the weight of the load contributes over 95% of the posttrauma motor deficit, whereas the time duration of the load resting on the cord contributes less than 5% to the deficit. Sex, pretrauma motor performance, and pretrauma body weight are insignificant covariates. The model may be used to establish expected motor deficits and to derive dose-response curves.\r"

The aim of the present study was to study how the IC content varied with time and compare this pattern with the clinical picture. Forty-two patients presented clinical or radiological signs of cerebral vasospasm during their hospital stays, whereas 12 patients showed no such signs. The patients with vasospasm had a significantly higher amount of ICs in serum than those without vasospasm. In 37 patients with vasospasm, the changes of IC content during the 1st weeks after SAH correlated well with the clinical course. Data indicated that a high IC content preceded the onset of vasospasm and a low content preceded clinical improvement. This observation supports the idea that the presence of ICs might be the cause and not the result of vasospasm.\r"

All patients underwent an anterior decompression and fusion via the lateral extracavity approach with or without an accompanying posterior internal stabilization procedure (modified Weiss springs or Harrington distraction rods). All patients were allowed to plateau neurologically before reconstructive spine surgery was performed. The patient's neurological grade at the time of surgery and after recovery was assessed according to a seven-grade scale presented herein. None of the 34 patients with a motor and sensory complete myelopathy recovered any function below the level in injury. Of the 10 motor-complete patients with some sensory perception, 4 improved neurologically; however, only 1 of these improved to a state of limited ambulation. The rest remained nonambulatory. Of the 33 patients with significantly disabling incomplete motor and sensory myelopathies, 17 improved to a level of minimal neurological deficit; only 3 patients were left nonambulatory. Of the 21 patients whose physical finding demonstrated a minimal neurological deficit preoperatively, 17 recovered to a normal neurological state. Seven patients were neurologically normal preoperatively and were unchanged postoperatively. Reconstruction of the spine with an anterior decompression and an accompanying stabilization procedure, when appropriate, leads to a better neurological outcome than that expected with either a conservative, nonoperative approach or an operative posterior stabilization approach.\r"

Permanent neurological deficits were seen with doses of cisplatin as low as 69 mg/m2, although doses as high as 100 mg/m2 were tolerated by other patients. All 3 patients who developed permanent neurological deficits received fixed doses of cisplatin of 150 mg and supplied only 2 major intracranial branches from the infused carotid artery. In none of these patients was a filter used in the infusion line. Other risk factors identified in 2 of the 3 patients were diffuse neoplasm involving the region of the internal capsule and the use of an infusion pump rather than a pulsatile bolus infusion technique. The development of a permanent neurological deficit appeared unrelated to the dose of BCNU within the range utilized, and preinfusion administration of corticosteroids did not prevent neurological deficit. These possible risk factors should be considered in the future development of protocols for arterial infusion therapy of malignant gliomas.\r"

  ".W": "The surgical anatomy of a transtemporal approach to the structures of the clivus was defined with the aid of dissections in 10 cadaver heads. The steps in the dissection consisted of first exposing the cervical internal carotid artery (ICA), the internal jugular vein, and the caudal cranial nerves, each at the skull base; then performing small retromastoid and temporal craniotomies; and, finally, drilling away the petrous and tympanic bone to expose the intratemporal parts of the facial nerve, the petrous ICA, the sigmoid sinus, and the jugular bulb. To expose the structures of the lower clivus, the sigmoid sinus was ligated and divided, the facial nerve was displaced anterosuperiorly, and the inner ear structures were preserved. Dural opening exposed the anterolateral and anterior surfaces of the medulla, the pontomedullary junction, and the spinomedullary junction. The ipsilateral vertebral artery and often the contralateral vertebral artery and the vertebrobasilar junction, the caudal cranial nerves, and the origin of the 6th, 7th, and 8th cranial nerves were well exposed. To expose the structures of the middle clivus, we drilled away the labyrinth, the cochlea, and a portion of the clival bone. The facial nerve was displaced posteroinferiorly. Dural opening exposed the ipsilateral anterior surface of the pons, the midbasilar artery, and the ipsilateral 5th, 6th, 7th, and 8th cranial nerves. A portion of the contralateral anterior surface of the pons was also exposed at times. The superior limit of this exposure was just above the origin of the trigeminal nerve. The exposure of the upper clival structures was limited with this approach, and required medial temporal lobe retraction. Two case reports are included to illustrate the application of the transtemporal approach to the exposure and clipping of aneurysms of the vertebrobasilar system. The advantages and disadvantages of this approach are discussed.\r"

Prompt declaration of brain death is therefore possible. In addition, it is important for physicians to offer the possibility of organ donation to the patient's family both because organs are desperately needed and because many families desire this. A model algorithm for the determination of brain death, explanatory text, and appropriate references are presented to aid the development of protocols for individual and hospital use.\r"

None experienced more seizures or disruption of menses. Transient tiredness and depression were noted in some when progesterone dosage was raised above minimally effective levels. These symptoms cleared within 48 hours of lowering the dosage. The value of intermittent natural progesterone therapy as a safe, well-tolerated, and effective adjunct to antiseizure therapy should be assessed further.\r"

Nerve conduction studies demonstrated reduced amplitude and slowed sensory potentials, and mildly prolonged late responses. Sensory evoked potentials revealed prolonged latency of scalp-evoked potentials from tibial nerve stimulation with normal median nerve values. The foveal visual evoked potential was delayed in the right eye, with normal visual acuity, funduscopic examination, and spatial contrast sensitivity. Repeat electrophysiologic studies demonstrated improvement. Nitrous oxide produces multifocal reversible dysfunction within the nervous system similar to that described in patients with vitamin B12 deficiency.\r"

Fifty-three of the 59 patients randomized to radiation therapy received a 4500- to 5000-rad tumor dose in five to 6.5 weeks bilaterally to the groins and to the midplane of the pelvis even if only unilateral positive groin nodes had been detected; no radiation was given to the central vulvar area. Fifty-three of the 55 patients randomized to further surgery had pelvic node resection performed on the side containing positive groin nodes either unilaterally or bilaterally. Acute and chronic morbidity was similar for both regimens. The two major poor prognostic factors were clinically suspicious or fixed ulcerated groin nodes and two or more positive groin nodes. The difference in survival for the 114 evaluable patients was significant, favoring the adjunctive radiation therapy group (P = .03). The estimated two-year survival rates were 68% for the radiation therapy group and 54% for pelvic node resection group. The most dramatic survival advantage for radiation therapy was in patients who had either of the two major poor prognostic factors present; at this time, the benefit of radiation therapy for the remaining patients is uncertain. In this randomized prospective study, the addition of adjunctive groin and pelvic irradiation therapy after radical vulvectomy and inguinal lymphadenectomy proved superior to pelvic node resection.\r"

Nine of the tumors were well-differentiated, adenoacanthomas (six) or adenocarcinomas (three) and limited to the endometrium. In one case, a moderately differentiated adenosquamous carcinoma involved an ovary and the pelvic wall. Treatment consisted of curettage and progestogens in three patients, one of whom later bore two children. The remainder of the women were treated with abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and/or radiation therapy. All patients for whom follow-up data are available are alive and well without evidence of disease. It is concluded that in selected young patients with well-differentiated endometrial carcinoma limited to the endometrium, conservative hormonal therapy and curettage may be adequate treatment and may preserve fertility.\r"

No patients were identified as having central nervous system metastases before 1968. The median survival overall was 29 months; following the diagnosis of brain metastases it was five months. Five of eight patients treated for central nervous system metastases lived ten months or longer. Patients with isolated metastases to the central nervous system lived longer than patients with accompanying systemic metastases. Patients treated with surgical resection lived longer than those who did not undergo surgery. With surgical resection, postoperative irradiation, and systemic chemotherapy, significant symptomatic improvement and long-term remission are possible.\r"

Patients with stage I and II disease whose tumors contained elevated levels of cytosol progestin receptors had an improved survival over patients with tumors containing low levels of cytosol progestin receptors. However, patients with advanced ovarian cancers and low cytosol progestin receptors had significantly longer survival. The four-year estimated duration of survival with advanced disease and cytosol progestin receptors less than seven was 82%, whereas if the cytosol progestin receptors were seven or more, the four-year estimated duration of survival was only 10%. The explanation for this dichotomy is not evident at this time. In this study cytosol estrogen receptor levels were not associated with survival. These results suggest that measurement of cytosol progestin receptors is of prognostic value in advanced epithelial ovarian cancers.\r"

The sensitivity of this assay was 0.2 U/L. Serum levels of over 0.2 U/L were found in 27% of ovarian cancer patients, and most of these elevated enzyme levels occurred with more advanced stages of the disease. On the other hand, almost all ovarian cancer tissue contained detectable levels of the enzyme. Serous adenocarcinoma, endometrioid adenocarcinoma, and dysgerminoma had particularly large amounts. Placental alkaline phosphatase was more frequently detected in tissue than in the serum of ovarian cancer, and therefore may be a useful target in immunodetection and immunotherapy and in studying the histopathology of ovarian cancer.\r"

After instruction in self-detection of uterine activity, tocodynamometry was performed daily for 8.5 weeks per patient. Patients identified an average of 15% of their contractions during the study (range 0-78%). Numerous marks were placed in the absence of any detectable uterine activity. Of multiple obstetric variables analyzed, only multifetal gestation and preterm labor in the current pregnancy had any significant impact on perception. Results suggest that self-detection of uterine activity may not be reliable as the only means for the earliest possible detection of preterm labor.\r"

This study was designed to assess whether daily ambulatory home monitoring of uterine activity could facilitate early diagnosis of preterm labor. Of 76 patients at high risk for preterm labor who used daily ambulatory tocodynamometry, approximately half developed preterm labor. Evaluation when the diagnosis of preterm labor was first established has shown that in 8% of the patients the cervix was dilated more than 2 cm, shortened to less than 0.5 cm in 23%, and the fetal membranes were intact in all subjects. The same evaluation in 76 nonrandom contemporary controls matched for risk factors, maternal age, and parity has shown that more than 50% had a cervix dilated more than 2 cm, 38% had a cervix shorter than 0.5 cm, and 24% had rupture of the fetal membranes. Ultimately, 88% of the monitored patients and 59% of controls delivered at term. Comparisons between these groups indicate that intermittent home tocodynamometry may indeed be useful in making the early diagnosis of preterm labor.\r"

Data from 210,947 Washington state birth certificates from 1980 through 1982 were examined. The incidence was 50.2 cases of Erb's palsy per 100,000 live births. A case control study design was used to analyze 106 cases and 386 controls by both univariable and multivariable analysis. Birth weight was shown to be a significant risk factor regardless of which method of delivery was used. A high birth weight infant (4001-4500 g) had 2.5 times the risk of incurring an upper brachial plexus injury compared with normal size infants (2501-4000 g). The risk for infants greater than 4500 g increased another tenfold (OR = 21.0). When birth weight was controlled for in the analysis, midforceps (OR = 18.3), vacuum extraction (OR = 17.2), and low forceps (OR = 3.7) remained significantly associated with the Erb's palsy. Delivery by cesarean section was associated with a significant protective effect (OR = 0.5) compared with instrumental vaginal delivery. These data demonstrate a high risk for serious birth injury associated with instrumental midpelvic delivery.\r"

In six women with ovarian vein involvement and no evidence of iliofemoral thrombophlebitis, resolution followed intravenous antimicrobial therapy alone, and in three of these, resolution was confirmed by x-ray tomography. In contrast, three of five women with symptomatic iliofemoral thrombophlebitis had a prolonged febrile course despite antimicrobial and heparin therapy. The clinical courses of these 11 women were consistent with the observation that pelvic thrombophlebitis is associated with pelvic infection. Disease manifested within a few days after parturition was more likely due to ovarian vein involvement, whereas disease with later onset of symptoms was more likely due to iliofemoral thrombosis, with or without vena caval extension. Through the use of x-ray computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, the natural course of pelvic thrombophlebitis can be better elucidated and therapeutic regimens more clearly evaluated.\r"

Only one of 109 cases reviewed gave a history of birth by cesarean section, whereas ten cesarean deliveries would have been the expected number for this group on the basis of national rates. The single case was delivered by elective cesarean section before the rupture of the membranes, and the child developed respiratory papillomatosis in the first year of life. These findings suggest that in juvenile-onset disease, the transmission of infection from mother to child occurs most often during passage through an infected birth canal, but that intrauterine infection of the fetus is also possible. Papillomavirus infection of the female genital tract is common, but respiratory papillomatosis is rare. On the basis of crude estimates of annual number of children born to infected mothers and of new cases of juvenile-onset disease, the risk of developing disease for a child born to an infected mother was calculated to be one in several hundred exposures.\r"

The admission test was done in a concealed manner, and the result of the test was evaluated after delivery so as not to influence the clinical management. In part I of the investigation, the test was performed in 130 patients monitored during labor with pH determinations in scalp blood and in cord blood at birth. Patients with reactive admission tests had a low rate of intrauterine asphyxia in labor (0.9%), whereas half of the patients with ominous traces had intrauterine fetal asphyxia with a low scalp blood pH and neonatal depression. Similar results were obtained in part II, when the admission test was used as a screening procedure involving 1041 patients. The test was reactive in 94.3%, and in this group fetal distress (cesarean section, or forceps on that indication, or an Apgar score less than 7 at five minutes) occurred in 1.3%. Ten patients (1.0%) had ominous tests; four of these had fetal distress, and one of these fetuses died in utero three hours after admission, during which time stethoscopic auscultation failed to detect the fetal compromise. It is concluded that the admission test can detect fetal distress already present at admission and unnecessary delay in intervention can be avoided in such a case. The test seems also to have some predictive value for the fetal well-being for the next few hours of labor. The test is simple and convenient for screening purposes.\r"

Alterations in colloid osmotic pressure in preeclamptic patients, as well as significant peripartum changes in colloid osmotic pressure in normotensive patients, are reported. In a study of 72 normotensive and preeclamptic patients, peripartum colloid osmotic pressure, serum albumin, and total serum protein were compared. Both groups exhibited significantly lower colloid osmotic pressure in the postpartum period than that measured antepartum. The mean antepartum colloid osmotic pressure in preeclamptic patients was significantly lower than in normotensive subjects. Regression equations were calculated [colloid osmotic pressure = 5.21 (total serum protein) -11.4 (r2 = 0.851)] and [colloid osmotic pressure = 8.1 (serum albumin) -8.2 (r2 = 0.891)]. Within the physiologic ranges most commonly reported for normotensive and preeclamptic patients, the use of these equations allowed calculation of colloid osmotic pressure to within 10% of measured values in 75 and 80% of the cases, respectively. Where direct measurement of colloid osmotic pressure is not readily available, calculated values may be helpful in patient management.\r"

This study was designed to determine the mechanism for decrease in target organ sensitivity by examining pregnancy-induced changes in the affinity and number of angiotensin II receptors in myometrium from pregnant and nonpregnant sheep. Tissues were obtained from four ovariectomized sheep given 50 micrograms estradiol-17 beta on days 3 and 5 postsurgery and from four pregnant sheep (mean gestational age 136 days). Binding of 125I-angiotensin II was determined in particulate fractions of myometrium prepared by differential centrifugation. The 125I-angiotensin II binding to myometrial preparations was specific, saturable, and linear with protein concentration. In the nonpregnant group, binding capacity for angiotensin II in myometrium was 502 +/- 76 fmol/mg protein, whereas in the pregnant group it was 184 +/- 65 fmol/mg protein (P less than .01). Receptor affinity also was less (Kd 1.72 +/- 0.39 nM) during pregnancy compared with the nonpregnant sheep uterus (3.9 +/- 0.80 nM; P less than .01). These data support the hypothesis that the decrease in target organ sensitivity to exogenously administered angiotensin II during pregnancy in human and ovine species may be secondary to a decrease in the total number and affinity of specific angiotensin II receptors.\r"

Morphometric analysis of surface dysplasia in the conization specimens was performed to explain these findings. A statistically significantly greater surface area of dysplasia and greater spread of dysplastic cells in the endocervical canal was found in the positive cytology when compared to the false-negative cytology cases. No difference in vaginal spread of dysplasia existed between the two groups. The endocervical canal was sampled with a moist cotton swab in all of the cases. The results suggest that small numbers of dysplastic cells high in the endocervical canal may not be effectively sampled by cotton swabs in cases of false-negative cervical cytology, lowering screening sensitivity.\r"

These hypotheses were evaluated in a hospital-based case-control study. A total of 521 patients under age 45 with breast cancer were compared with 521 controls matched for age, time of interview, and geographic area. Oral contraceptive use before the first birth was reported by 155 patients and 137 controls. With allowance for confounding by multivariate analysis, the estimated relative risk was 1.0 (95% confidence interval, 0.6-1.5). The estimate was 1.0 (0.2-3.9) for any use among nulliparous women and 0.6 (0.3-1.3) for use before the first birth among parous women. Use before age 25 was reported by 145 patients and 141 controls, and the multivariate relative risk estimate was 1.0 (0.7-1.6); the results were similar when use of specific formulations was examined. For oral contraceptive use before either the first birth or age 25, the relative risk estimates were compatible with 1.0 for use of five or more years' duration or an interval since first use of at least 15 years. There was also no evidence of an increased risk in any subgroup including those at increased underlying risk because of factors such as a family history of breast cancer or a history of cystic breast disease. The findings suggest that, up to age 45, the risk of breast cancer is not influenced by the use of oral contraceptives before the first birth or before age 25 even if the use lasted for five or more years.\r"

  ".W": "The authors have investigated the application of mode-locked and Q-switched Neodymium:YAG (Nd:YAG) lasers in ocular surgery by means of high-speed photography and hydrophone measurements. The incisive effect relies on the optical breakdown at the laser focus. Cavitation bubbles and acoustic transients are thereby generated. Their size and pressure amplitude have been measured at various laser-pulse energies. With a pulse energy of 5 mJ, the bubble is 1.5 to 2.3 mm in diameter and the pressure of the acoustic transient is 9 to 16 bar (130 to 230 psi) at a distance of 18 mm from the focal point. Bubble size and amplitude of the pressure pulse are always approximately 50% higher with a Q-switched laser than with a mode-locked laser. However, the size of the ruptures produced in a polyethylene membrane by the laser pulses is the same for both modes of operation. The energy balance shows that not only mechanical effects, but also thermal mechanisms are responsible for photodisruption.\r"

In order to study the cause of this pressure rise, six eyes of three cynomolgus monkeys underwent extracapsular cataract extraction followed 2 to 3 months later by Nd:YAG laser capsulotomy. Eyes were evaluated clinically and examined histopathologically at 1 hour, 3 hours, 1 day, 3 days, 1 week, and 1 month after laser treatment. Although IOP did not increase after laser capsulotomy, outflow facility was decreased 80% from baseline levels at 3 hours, at 3 hours, 1 day, and 3 days. After laser treatment, the anterior chamber and meshwork contained fibrin, lens material, inflammatory cells, pigmented macrophages, erythrocytes, and free pigment. Most of these elements had cleared the meshwork by 1 month.\r"

In the following study, the metal-blade series was updated to a total of 225 procedures, and a more recent series of 300 procedures performed on 228 patients was examined in which a diamond-knife cutting instrument was used. Patients had uncorrected visual acuity determination, cycloplegic refractions with best corrected visual acuity measurements and keratometry measurements. The authors demonstrated a hyperopic shift in the distribution of postoperative spherical equivalent (SE) values across time such that higher proportions of cases in both metal-blade and diamond-knife series were at least 1.0 diopter (D) away from emmetropia at 24 and 48 months than was the case at 12 months after surgery. Regression analysis determined that none of the preoperative or surgical variables known to affect refractive outcome of RK (alone or in combination) could account for the changes in refraction seen during the course of postoperative time. In general, changes in keratometry paralleled refractive changes, but were somewhat smaller in magnitude.\r"

The anterior epithelial cell layer showed identical immunoreactivity. These studies strongly suggest that the posterior cell layer of the cornea lacks ultrastructural and immunocytochemical markers of endothelial cells and both the anterior and posterior cell layers share similar cell markers.

In two patients, the central epithelium had a stippled, almost dendritiform appearance leading to the misdiagnosis of herpes simplex keratitis. Cultures from corneal scrapings of two patients and cultures of a corneal biopsy from one patient, which included an area of presumed neural involvement, grew Acanthamoebae. All three patients used homemade saline solutions (salt tablets dissolved in distilled water). In one patient, Acanthamoebae were found in the contact lens case solution. In our recent experience, Acanthamoebae have also been found in the distilled water bottle and the saline solution made from distilled water and salt tablets in two additional patients with A. keratitis. Distilled water, which is not sterile, has proven to be one potentially avoidable source of A. keratitis in contact lens wearers.\r"

Electron microscopy revealed characteristic neuroepithelial melanosomes, distinct from those of choroidal melanocytes, and occasional annulate lamellae. A fibrovascular membrane extended over the tumor surface and was adherent to lens capsule. The association of this adenoma with a persistent stalk of primary vitreous indicates a congenital origin of this tumor. Both adenoma and adenocarcinoma of the pigmented and nonpigmented ciliary epithelium tend to be disorders of adults. The authors report the youngest presentation of a pigment epithelium adenoma, the only well-documented case associated with persistent hyperplastic primary vitreous, and the only documentation of annulate lamellae in a ciliary body tumor.\r"

The specimen studied four days after injection revealed by light microscopy scattered pigment granules within the epidermis and fine granules and small aggregates dispersed within the dermis. No acute or chronic inflammatory cells were observed in relationship to the deposits. The specimen obtained 12 months after eyeliner injection was studied by both light and electron microscopy. No pigment particles were observed within the epidermis, but rather there were coarse clumps of granular material in the dermis. Apart from scattered mast cells, which occasionally contained fine granules, and apart from the macrophages which appeared to have ingested the pigment granules, no other acute and chronic inflammatory cells were found. Electron microscopy demonstrated that while most of the granular material had been phagocytosed by macrophages, occasional granules were found in small dispersions within the cytoplasm of mast cells and fibroblasts of the dermis. Minimal migration of pigment within macrophages occurred to locations around lymphatic channels and within the superficial orbicularis muscle connective tissue.\r"

Although several scales are currently used to assess the intensity construct, it remains unclear which of these provides the most precise, replicable, and predictively valid measure. Five criteria for judging intensity scales have been considered in previous research: ease of administration of scoring; relative rates of incorrect responding; sensitivity as defined by the number of available response categories; sensitivity as defined by statistical power; and the magnitude of the relationship between each scale and a linear combination of pain intensity indices. In order to judge commonly used pain intensity measures, 75 chronic pain patients were asked to rate 4 kinds of pain (present, least, most, and average) using 6 scales. The utility and validity of the scales was judged using the criteria listed above. The results indicate that, for the present sample, the scales yield similar results in terms of the number of subjects who respond correctly to them and their predictive validity. However, when considering the remaining 3 criteria, the 101-point numerical rating scale appears to be the most practical index.\r"

Desipramine, but not amitriptyline, both increased and prolonged morphine analgesia. Neither tricyclic antidepressant reduced dental postoperative pain in the absence of morphine.

While some data suggest a similar increase in pain thresholds for pregnant women, Goolkasian and Rimer have found, using signal detection procedures, that women are increasingly likely to report stimuli as painful during the last 2 weeks of pregnancy. The present studies were carried out to assess pain and discomfort thresholds in the last weeks of women's pregnancies. In the first study, daily measures of the pressure-induced pain thresholds of 6 women who had spontaneous, vaginal births increased during the last 16 days of pregnancy and exceeded the 300 mm Hg maximum stimulus pressure for the last 9 days of pregnancy. In the second study, the discomfort thresholds of 6 women were measured each day during the last 11 days of pregnancy before spontaneous vaginal births. The discomfort thresholds of the pregnant women were higher than those of 6 non-pregnant women whose discomfort thresholds were also measured each day. Pregnant women's thresholds increased before the onset of labor, while the discomfort thresholds of the non-pregnant women were unchanged during the course of the study. These results extend Gintzler's findings of reduced sensitivity to pain shortly before parturition.\r"

There was a very strong association between stress and pain and hassles and pain. The greater the stress and hassles, the greater the incidence, frequency and severity of all pains reported. Those with high internal health locus of control are more likely to have healthy behavior, are less likely to have all kinds of pain, and have less severe pain. Stress was voluntarily mentioned by respondents as a major cause of pain in headaches, backaches, stomach pains, and menstrual pains, but not for muscle, joint or dental pains.\r"

Intravenous administration of fentanyl (100 or 200 micrograms/kg, 0.179 or 0.358 mumol/kg) also showed a similar lack of effect on the radiant heat evoked responses of single PMNs. Slight changes in the mean latencies following drug administration were recognized, which were not statistically significant. The use of morphine (1.5%, 1 ml, 19.8 mumol) with preservatives (chlorbutanol 0.5% and sodium bisulfite less than 0.1%) caused conduction block of PMNs within 6-15 min. Subsequent washout of the drug resulted in the return of the unitary discharges within 8 min. Lidocaine (0.25 and 0.5%, 10.7 mumol and 21.4 mumol) caused conduction block within 5-18 min. These data support the classically held concept that opiates, in clinically useful concentrations, do not alter peripheral nerve function.\r"

Systemic administration of strychnine (1 mg/kg/day) for 7 days at the postoperational interval of 23 days proved to be suitable for quantitating the transsynaptic degeneration at the light microscopic level. When the proximal stump of transected nerve was treated with 2% colchicine immediately after transection, 5.8 +/- 6.8 dark neurons in a single section of the medullary dorsal horn, ipsilateral to the nerve transection, were observed. Following similar treatment with 0.4% vinblastine and 0.2% vincristine, 24.4 +/- 10.5 and 9.4 +/- 7.0 dark neurons were seen, respectively. When compared with 43.0 +/- 9.4 dark neurons, which were seen in animals without alkaloid treatment, colchicine, vinblastine and vincristine significantly reduced the transsynaptic degeneration by 86, 43, and 78%, respectively. Possible mechanisms involved in prevention of transsynaptic degeneration by the alkaloids are discussed.\r"

The techniques of screening are different for each: amniotic fluid analysis for spina bifida cystica, a manual physical examination for congenital dislocation of the hip, and a visual examination for scoliosis. Properly time amniotic fluid analysis for alpha-fetoprotein is both a sensitive and specific test for neural tube defects. However, because of the low incidence of spina bifida cystica, this examination is justified only in high-risk pregnancies. Maternal serum screening has not achieved widespread acceptance because of its lack of sensitivity and the low and apparently falling incidence of the deformity. The neonatal manual examination for congenital dislocation of the hip is now well established and widely practiced. Almost all agree that the incidence of persistent congenital dislocation of the hip has been lowered as a result. However, the examination lacks both sensitivity and specificity because of intrinsic difficulties with the examination and the occurrence of late onset subluxation and dislocation. It is becoming apparent that congenital dislocation of the hip is a dynamic problem in the peri- and early neonatal period. Repeated careful evaluation of the hips during infancy is necessary to make the diagnosis as early as possible. To further enhance early detection, it may be necessary to consider obtaining an anteroposterior pelvis radiograph at age 4 to 6 months in babies at high risk. The visual evaluation for scoliosis is a very sensitive test but lacks specificity. Efforts are now being made to quantify visual screening techniques and thus decrease the numbers of false-positive examinations.\r"

Fixed forefoot equinus and heel varus characterize a clubfoot, which requires immediate treatment. Corrective shoes are not advised as the primary treatment for metatarsus varus or clubfoot but often are prescribed to maintain the corrected position after serial casts. Flexible flatfoot is a manifestation of a constitutional laxity affecting all ligaments and joints. The feet appear abnormal because of weight-bearing stresses. Most children with flatfoot achieve a partial correction spontaneously. Current research does not document that treatment with corrective shoes or inserts produces a result better than the partial correction that occurs naturally.\r"

In certain long-standing metabolic or genetic bone disorders, the effects of weight bearing produce a true bowing of the extremities with changes about the hips, knees, and ankles. The most important aspect in the evaluation of a child with a bowed appearance of the lower extremities is to determine which conditions require aggressive treatment and which ones require simply giving the parents reassurance that the condition will spontaneously regress.\r"

These models have used the serum creatinine level as either a reciprocal or logarithmic plot against time. The accuracy of such predictions are characterized by either a correlation coefficient (r value) or prediction error (time at which dialysis was predicted minus time at which dialysis actually occurred). Retrospectively, we analyzed 37 children who progressed to end-stage renal disease, grouped them by their respective primary diseases, and calculated both r values and prediction error for each individual and group. Although r values for each group (with the exception of patients less than 1 year of age) were comparable, prediction errors were widely disparate among the various groupings. Individuals within each of the groups had disparate values even though identical r values were present. These observations indicate that predictive models using serum creatinine levels are of limited clinical use and are least useful for patients younger than 1 year of age.\r"

Novelty preference scores correctly identified six of eight (75%) of the delayed children. The test identified 49 of 54 (91%) of the normal children. Validity for predicting cognitive delay was 55%. Validity for the prediction of normality was 96%. The screening device proved to be equally sensitive, specific, and valid when the sample was divided into infants born at term or born preterm. The results of the present study and of a previous study indicate that detection of cognitive delay based on early novelty preferences is as easily accomplished for infants who will later be mildly delayed (IQ scores 60 to 70) as it is for those who will later be severely delayed (IQ scores less than or equal to 50). Moreover, such results are in contrast to those obtained with conventional tests tapping sensorimotor development.\r"

In the current study, the association of physical activity to diabetic complications was assessed in 696 type I diabetic individuals diagnosed between 1950 and 1964. Participation in team sports in high school or college was not associated with a decreased prevalence of severe retinopathy or blindness later in life. There was, however, a suggestion of a negative association between physical activity and both cardiovascular disease and overall mortality, ie, individuals who participated in team sports were somewhat less likely to report macrovascular disease at follow-up or to have died than nonparticipants. The relationship between physical activity and diabetic complications only appeared in male subjects. The results suggest that activity early in life by patients with type I diabetes does not appear to be associated with an adverse health effect and may, in fact, be beneficial.\r"

This study investigated the use of toluidine blue dye in the pediatric (0 to 10 years) and adolescent (11 to 18 years) patients to detect posterior fourchette lacerations in sexually abused and control populations. Application of toluidine blue dye increased the detection rate of posterior fourchette lacerations from 4% (1/25) to 28% (7/25) (P less than .05, Fisher exact test) in adolescent sexually abused patients and from 16.5% (4/24) to 33% (8/24) (P = .318, Fisher exact test) in pediatric sexually abused patients. Posterior fourchette lacerations occurred with the same frequency in sexually abused adolescents and sexually active controls adolescents. In the pediatric aged population, 33% of the sexually abused group had lacerations detected, whereas none of the control patients had lacerations. The presence of posterior fourchette lacerations in the pediatric aged patient is strongly suggestive of sexual abuse. Toluidine blue increases the detection of posterior fourchette lacerations in children and adolescents (P less than .001, Fisher exact test). The application of toluidine blue dye to highlight posterior fourchette lacerations is an important addition to tools already used in the evaluation of the sexually abused patient.\r"

One of the children suddenly died at the age of 16 months following an episode of a rapidly deteriorating Reye syndrome-like illness with hypoketotic hypoglycemia and dicarboxylic aciduria, but without any previous alarming symptoms. The eldest sibling had died at the age of 19 months under similar conditions. The other family members had always been healthy. On fasting, all affected family members accumulated in their plasma the medium-chain fatty acids octanoic, decanoic, and cis-4-decenoic acids. Their urinary organic acid excretion profile could be characterized as \"dicarboxylic aciduria.\" A deficiency of medium-chain acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase was demonstrated in a postmortem liver sample of the index patient. Cultured fibroblasts from the father and the two healthy children had a decreased rate of [14C]octanoate oxidation. It is suggested that a deficiency of medium-chain acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase may lead to a life-threatening illness when other complicating factors such as diarrhea and vomiting result in an abnormal depletion of the body's glycogen stores. Careful monitoring of at-risk patients during a minor illness is necessary.\r"

  ".W": "Microcephaly and its etiology were studied in an unselected Swedish urban infant population. Virtually, all live-born infants (14,724) born between October 1977 and December 1983 in the city of Malmo, Sweden, were included in the study. Special attention was given to the role of congenital infections, particularly to cytomegalovirus infection. The infant population was studied from two points of view. One part of the study was prospective and based on regular cytomegalovirus isolation in urine within the first week of life. About 80% of the newborns were adequately studied by this test. None of 56 infants shown to be cytomegalovirus excreters (congenitally infected) and followed up were born with or developed microcephaly (head circumference smaller than 3 SD below the mean for age and sex) during the first 1 to 7 years of life. However, two of the 56 infants had a head circumference of -2 SD. In the beginning of 1985, an inventory was made of the presence of symptomatic microcephaly in the above mentioned population still living in the city or deceased there. Of about 10,000 such children, 12 were found to have symptomatic microcephaly. By studies of personal, clinical, and laboratory data and by retrospective serologic studies of frozen pre- and postconceptional maternal sera, a possible explanation or a recognized syndrome was obtained in ten of the 12 cases. In one of them, the mother had a primary cytomegalovirus infection, possibly in early pregnancy. Although the infant had symptoms compatible with a congenital infection, no laboratory evidence of transmitted infection was found. In no case were congenital rubella virus or Toxoplasma gondii infections suspected.\r"

Each child was screened using the DDST (revised) and another screening measure of speech and language development. Statistically significant differences were found between the DDST language sector and the speech-language screening in identification of expressive language and articulation problems. No significant difference was found with receptive language. The DDST failed to identify more than one half of the children with expressive language and/or articulation problems. These results demonstrate that the DDST may fail to identify children with speech and language impairment. Professionals involved in developmental screening need to be advised of alternative speech and language screening measures.\r"

To evaluate the effectiveness of this law, we analyzed traffic accident data for New Mexico from January 1981 through September 1984. During this period, there were 20,972 children younger than 5 years of age in motor vehicle accidents. Restraint usage increased for this age group from a low of about 10% in 1981 to more than 40% in 1984 (P less than 10(-6)). Unrestrained children younger than 5 years of age were five times more likely to be killed and two times more likely to be injured than restrained children. Analysis of motor vehicle accident fatality and injury rates pre- and post-law revealed a 33% reduction in motor vehicle accident fatality rates and a 12.6% reduction in nonfatal injury rates for children younger than 5 years. We conclude that child restraint devices are effective in reducing motor vehicle accident fatalities and injuries in young children and the child restraint law has been effective in increasing child restraint usage and in reducing childhood death and injury in New Mexico.\r"

During a 6-month period, 200 study patients treated with expired ipecac syrup and 200 control patients treated with unexpired ipecac syrup were evaluated. There were no statistical differences between the control and study groups in patient characteristics (age and sex) and product characteristics (general class, emetic potential, pretreatment, previously opened bottles, and manufacturer). In both control and study groups, emesis occurred in 100% of cases with 90% of patients vomiting with the first dose. The mean time to emesis was 24.7 minutes and 24.8 minutes in the study and control groups, respectively. Expired preparations ranged from 1 month to greater than 4 years postexpiration, with the duration of expiration not altering the mean time to emesis. Mean time to emesis between the two groups was also not affected by manufacturer, pretreatment with milk, or whether the ipecac syrup bottle was previously opened. We conclude that expired ipecac syrup (up to 4 years postexpiration date) is an effective emetic.\r"

The etiologic agents in osteomyelitis or osteoarthritis were Salmonella sp in four cases, Escherichia coli in one, Enterobacter aerogenes in one, Staphylococcus aureus in one, and Haemophilus influenzae type b in one. Five of the cases with infection limited to the joint were caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae; the sixth was caused by H influenzae type b. Fever (greater than or equal to 38.3 degrees C) was present in all children and the temperature was in excess of 39 degrees C in 62%. The mean duration of pain before admission was 4.5 days. The initial total white blood cell count ranged from 5,200 to 29,700/microL (mean 19,436/microL) and the total band neutrophil count ranged from 0 to 5,103/microL (mean 1,660/microL). The ESR was greater than 20 mm/h in eight of the ten patients who were tested. Management consisted of antibiotic therapy in all. Needle aspiration was performed in two patients with osteomyelitis and in three with suppurative arthritis. Incision and drainage was performed in two cases of osteomyelitis and in four with suppurative arthritis. The outcome was satisfactory in all except one patient who had several complications as a consequence of femoral neck osteomyelitis. Recurrence was reported in only one patient.\r"

  ".W": "We hypothesize that the respiratory and functional states of the very low birth weight infant with bronchopulmonary dysplasia can be improved in the neonatal intensive care unit by prevention of inappropriate sensory input. To test this hypothesis, we developed for preterm newborns a behavior observation method that catalogues specific reaction patterns according to putative stress and relaxation behaviors. We then collected behavioral information and heart rate, respiratory rate, and transcutaneous PO2 readings before, during, and after routine care-giving interventions. Eight control and eight experimental infants were selected for study based on the following criteria: birth weight less than 1,250 g, gestational age less than 28 weeks, on the respirator greater than 24 hours in first 48 hours of life at greater than or equal to 0.60 FiO2 for more than two hours during first 48 hours of life. Additionally, the two groups were comparable on other medical and demographic variables, including severity of respiratory status for the first ten days and incidence of intraventricular hemorrhage, patent ductus arteriosus, and socioeconomic status. Systematic observations were conducted on days 10, 20, and 30 after birth and at 36 and 40 weeks postconception. For the intervention infants, our observations were discussed with the infants' primary nurses, and individualized modifications for each infant's care plan were implemented based on these observations. Experimental infants showed significantly briefer stays on the respirator (P less than .01) and in increased FiO2 (P less than .05). Their feeding behavior was normalized significantly earlier (P less than .01). Experimental infants also showed significantly better behavioral regulation scores at 1 month after their mothers' estimated dates of confinement (post-EDC), as measured with the Assessment of Preterm Infants' Behavior, significantly better Mental and Psychomotor Developmental Indices at 3, 6, and 9 months post-EDC, as measured with the Bayley Scales of Infant Development, and significantly better behavioral regulation scores at 9 months post-EDC, as measured in a videotaped play observation. Measurements of weight, height, and head circumference at 3, 6, and 9 months post-EDC showed no differences. All assessments were performed by one of two trained testers not familiar with the goals of the study or the group status of the infant. These results support the hypothesis that very low birth weight preterm babies profit significantly both medically and developmentally from individualized behavioral care in the neonatal intensive care unit.\r"

To further differentiate the effects of asthma itself from the drugs used, we evaluated 20 asthmatic children (6 to 12 years of age) who had not received oral bronchodilators for at least 6 months. A double blind, placebo-controlled, parallel format was used with a 4-week theophylline or placebo period preceded by a 2-week baseline. Theophylline serum levels were maintained between 10 to 20 micrograms/mL. During baseline and treatment periods, the child's home and school behavior/performance were monitored independently by their parents and teachers using standardized report forms. A battery of psychologic tests was administered at the end of baseline and treatment periods. Seven children receiving theophylline were noted to have a change in school behavior and/or performance during their 4 weeks on drug compared to baseline, whereas none of the children receiving placebo were noted to be different (P = .004). Thus, the short-term administration of theophylline to asymptomatic asthmatic children not receiving oral bronchodilators can adversely affect school performance and behavior. Because this population represents the majority of asthmatic children, one needs to use theophylline cautiously in this age group, monitor school performance closely, or seek other treatment modalities.\r"

Except for mortality data by cause and age, which are based on a 10% sample, all the US data for 1984 are estimates by place of occurrence, based upon a count of certificates received in state offices between two dates, 1 month apart, regardless of when the event occurred. Experience has shown that for the country as a whole the estimates, with few exceptions, are close to the subsequent final figures. There are, however, considerable variations in some states, particularly in comparing data by place of occurrence and place of residence. State information should be interpreted cautiously.\r"

  ".W": "Emergency department utilization by recipients of Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) in a metropolitan children's hospital was monitored during a 36-month period (July 1982 to June 1985). There were 92,495 emergency department visits recorded in this interval. During 12 months of this period (July 1983 to June 1984) a pilot program (Citicare) for AFDC recipients requiring prior authorization by the primary care physician for emergency department utilization was in effect. Emergency department census dropped dramatically and abruptly upon initiation of this program. Annual census for the targeted years reveals: 35,704 visits for the 12 months preceding this novel program, 25,543 visits for the 12 months of the program, and 31,248 visits for the 12 months following the pilot program. Total emergency department census was decreased by 23% and medical assistance utilization was decreased by 46% during the Citicare program. During the target period, self-pay clients decreased by 25%, and other categories (Champus, Hill-Burton, Crippled Children's Commission, etc.) increased by 6%. There was no corresponding decline in the number of patients admitted to the hospital through the emergency department during the monitoring period with 3,545, 3,555, and 3,922 annualized admissions respectively, for the targeted 12-month periods. These data suggest that the format of Medicaid programs can dramatically alter the utilization of emergency department services. Furthermore, the primary impact of this specific program was to decrease inappropriate emergency department use.\r"

Mechanical variables include cannula number, length, brand, and gauge; tubing length, band, style, and gauge; use of extensions; and presence and type of pressure system. This study evaluated a few of these variables. The flow rates were determined for 10 brands of 20-, 22-, and 24-gauge peripheral intravenous catheters. The catheter brands were divided into two groups, slow or faster. The differences in flow between the two categories were statistically significant. The disparities between the slowest and most rapid catheters of the same gauge were only 6.6, 5.4, and 7.7 ml/min for the 20, 22, and 24 gauges, respectively. The tubing apparatus was also a significant determinant of flow. The addition of any extensions further decreased flow. The magnitude of this slowing was a function of both the tubing and the type of extension.\r"

Emergency department records of children diagnosed as being sexually abused were reviewed for the period covering January 1984 through June 1985. Of 26,000 patients seen, 300 cases of sexual abuse were identified. Of these, 57 were patients who presented with initial complaints other than sexual abuse. The data were analyzed for age, sex, chief complaint, time of presentation, physical findings, and person accompanying the child. The most common presenting complaints of these 57 patients were abdominal pain (26%) and vaginal symptoms (26%) The latter included pruritus, discharge, and bleeding. Other complaints included rectal bleeding or constipation (9%), chronic urinary tract infection (5%), straddle injury (4%), and suicide attempt (2%). The remaining 26% included fever, respiratory infections, sore throat, asthma, bronchitis, obesity, mastoiditis, and weight loss. Because resident physicians are instructed to conduct complete anal and genital examinations on all patients, sexual misuse was often diagnosed with seemingly unrelated complaints. A protocol developed for use in the emergency department is described.\r"

To test the hypothesis that burns from other etiologies are more serious and require longer hospitalizations than scald burns, a retrospective chart review was undertaken. The charts of all patients less than 16 years of age who were admitted to Harborview Medical Center Burn Unit in the years 1979 to 1984 were reviewed. Four hundred sixty-four children were admitted to the regional burn center during that time. We found that children under four years of age are at greatest risk for being hospitalized for thermal injury, that the burn most commonly occurs inside the home between 6 PM and midnight, and that scalds are the most common etiology for thermal injuries in children (54%). However, 46% of the burns resulting in admission to our burn center were from etiologies other than scald injury. There was no significant correlation between etiology of the burns and length of hospital stay, rate of infection, or need for excision and grafting. Thermal injuries to children from any etiology are serious; pediatric health care providers should be aware that children may be burned in a variety of ways and should direct some of their well-child visit time to the topic of burn prevention in the home.\r"

The shoulder mechanism provides the upper limb with a range of motion exceeding that of any other joint mechanism. The placement of the hand is determined by four components of the shoulder complex: the glenohumeral, acromioclavicular, and sternoclavicular joints and the scapulothoracic gliding mechanism. The clavicular joints permit the scapula to move against the chest wall during movements of the arm, allowing the glenoid fossa to follow the head of the humerus, and thus contribute significantly to total arm movement. The functional interrelationships between the glenohumeral, scapulothoracic, and clavicular joint mechanisms are critical in providing a full, functional ROM. Any pathological condition of any one of these mechanisms will disturb upper limb function. The ligamentous and periarticular structures of the shoulder complex combine in maintaining the joint relationships, withstanding the forces applied to the joint surfaces, and stabilizing the dependent limb.\r"

The majority of maxillae were moved in more than one plane of space. Technical details, complications, and relapse potential are discussed. Advantages of rigid plate fixation include marked reductions in the length of intermaxillary fixation with light training elastics only. Immediate postoperative airway problems are thereby eliminated. Six months of follow-up would appear to indicate a low potential for osseous relapse when compared to wire osteosynthesis, regardless of the direction of maxillary movement. The major disadvantage is the decreased ability of postoperative orthodontics to move dento-osseous segments if skeletal occlusal disharmony persists postoperatively. For this reason, close attention to preoperative planning and operative technique is critical for the success of this fixation method.\r"

Similar circumferential tears occurred on the luminal surface of resected human avulsed arteries collected at the time of replantation surgery. No consistent lesions were noted in resected veins from human avulsed amputations. It is possible that in the human artery (as in the monkey) circumferential lesions frequently extend many centimeters from the rupture point and therefore beyond resection distances. Lesions present in the vessel after resection and microsurgical repair might be the site of thrombosis and subsequent occlusion.\r"

During morphologic antegrade examination, aspirated urine can be analyzed for tumor cells (cytologic examination), infection (smear, culture), or other biochemical alterations. The use of antegrade pyelography in the demonstration of internal diversion, ureteral fistula, and the site and cause of obstruction is well established. Dynamic antegrade study is crucial in the assessment of many pyeloureteral units in which the issue of current obstruction is equivocal or uncertain. Absolute renal and bladder pressures are obtained simultaneously; these and the calculated differential pressure provide objective data relative to ureteral resistance to urine flow and renal nephron preservation.\r"

On the basis of history, the status of vascular perfusion of the involved ureteral segment and possible presence of devitalization are projected. Transluminal dilatation of ureteral strictures can be performed via a retrograde or antegrade approach. The age of the stricture and status of vascular supply to the involved and adjacent segments of the ureter are the most critical criteria influencing long-term results of transluminal dilatation. The technique of bougie dilatation and placement of balloons across strictures at various sites is discussed. The advantages of bougie versus balloon dilatation and the need for postdilatation stenting to preclude restricturing are analyzed. In fresh strictures, not complicated by devascularization, a 90 per cent salutary response to transluminal dilatation can be anticipated, regardless of location of the stricture, ureteroneocystostomy, or ureteroileostomy. Most poor results of transluminal dilatation occur in strictures compromised by severe devascularization attendant to surgical procedures, radiation therapy, fulminating inflammatory processes, neoplasms, or any combination of these. Decompression and drainage of the kidney by an internalized stent are advocated for the treatment of strictures caused by recurrent and uncontrolled neoplasm.\r"

The sparsity of reports in the literature on this subject reflects the reluctance of urologists to refer patients for balloon dilatation of urethral strictures. Every effort must be made by the radiologist to impress the urologist with the value of this procedure, which would eliminate the production of false passages and likely reduce the recurrence rate. Initial results with this procedure are encouraging, but larger series are required and long-term follow-up is necessary for evaluation of cure rate, rate of recurrence, and possible complications.\r"

In order to examine the in vivo activity of the different lytic solutions, 98 patients suffering from peripheral arterial occlusions were divided into three homogeneous groups for treatment with streptokinase, streptokinase-plasminogen, and urokinase. Although urokinase was superior to streptokinase on the fibrin plate with plasminogen, no difference was demonstrated in vivo between the two lytic agents. Streptokinase-plasminogen in a molar proportion of 1:2 showed significantly higher fibrinolytic activity than any other solution. Therefore, the fibrinolytic agent of choice for intrathrombotic injections seems to be a 1:2 solution of streptokinase with plasminogen or with the lytic enzyme plasmin itself.\r"

With the current introduction system, the possibility of filter misplacement has been essentially eliminated. No patient experienced symptoms suggestive of pulmonary embolism after filter insertion. One filter retrieval has been performed, with no complications.\r"

Doses of iohexol (300 mg iodine/ml) ranged between 150 and 660 mgI/kg (0.5 and 2.2 ml/kg). Iohexol was tolerated well, and no significant adverse reactions occurred. Sixty-five iohexol urograms were evaluated to determine the minimum dose for adequate visualization of the kidneys and collecting systems. A dose greater than 300 mgI/kg (1.0 ml/kg) always resulted in a urogram of diagnostic quality, while visualization was insufficient for diagnosis in 10% of studies done with doses of 150-300 mgI/kg (0.5-1.0 ml/kg). Another 65 iohexol urograms were compared in a blinded manner with a similar number of studies performed using iothalamate meglumine at comparable iodine concentration and dose. Visualization of calyces and pelvoinfundibular structures achieved with iohexol was rated better with statistical significance, but there was no difference in visualization of the renal parenchyma or ureters. Use of iohexol in excretory urography may be advantageous in children who are at greatest risk for an adverse reaction to contrast media or in those most likely to benefit from use of a low osmolality contrast agent.\r"

  ".U": "87068351\r", 
  ".W": "The anterior portion of the diaphragm has three typical appearances on computed tomographic (CT) scans, depending on the cephalocaudal relation of the xiphoid to the central tendon of the diaphragm. The anterior diaphragm most often appears as a relatively smooth or slightly undulating soft-tissue curve, concave posteriorly and continuous across the midline with the lateral diaphragmatic arcs. In the next most frequent CT appearance, the diaphragmatic line is discontinuous in the midline. On each of these images, the muscular line diverges rather than converges as it approaches the anterior chest wall. Less commonly, the anterior portions of the diaphragm are imaged on CT not as a thin line but instead as a broad band with irregular, ill-defined, or angular margins. Occasionally, the anterior diaphragmatic muscle is not identified on CT because the muscle fibers are inseparable from adjacent structures, or are extremely short or even absent. An understanding of these anatomic variations permits the correct diagnosis of Morgagni hernias and explains previously described variants of plain radiographic configurations of pneumoperitoneum.\r"

In normal lungs, the smallest pulmonary artery resolved by HRCT was 200 microns in diameter; the artery was accompanied by the terminal bronchiole and the first-order respiratory bronchiole. The distance from the vessel to the corresponding lobular border ranged from 3 to 5 mm. These results suggest that the centrilobular area or the area around the terminal or respiratory bronchioles can be recognized with HRCT. In addition, the authors confirmed that centrilobular emphysema and centrilobular tuberculous nodules can be diagnosed with HRCT. Thus, HRCT can demonstrate the location of pathologic changes within a lobule and may be helpful in the differential diagnosis of diffuse pulmonary diseases.\r"

When fibrosis was mild or when it was combined with emphysema, bronchiectasis was absent or mild. Specimen radiographs revealed that bronchiectasis frequently contributed to the radiographic appearance of honeycombing. Retrospective analysis of the plain chest radiographs obtained from five of the patients revealed evidence suggestive of bronchiectasis, but bronchiectasis was difficult to detect unless the surrounding lung was radiopaque. In two living patients with end-stage pulmonary fibrosis, bronchiectasis was much better depicted on computed tomography scans than on plain chest radiographs. In patients with pulmonary fibrosis, the presence of bronchiectasis does not necessarily imply the presence of primary bronchial disease. Rather, bronchiectasis can be a direct result of the fibrotic process.\r"

The authors applied the basic principles of the segmental approach to the interpretation of MR images obtained in a group of patients with levotransposition of the aorta. Results indicate that this logical step-by-step method can be used to advantage in the accurate analysis of MR images obtained in patients with complex congenital cardiac disease.

Seventy-six of the 93 side branches had minor (less than 50%) narrowing at their origin. Among these side branches, nine (12%) were compromised by PTCA. Seventeen of the 93 side branches had greater than 50% ostial stenosis. Significantly more of these side branches (seven of seventeen, or 41%) were compromised by PTCA (P less than .01). Even when compromise does occur, it usually takes the form of increased stenosis rather than total occlusion. The presence of side branches originating in stenotic lesions is not a contraindication to PTCA since serious compromise of such branches rarely results from this procedure.\r"

Selective detection of moving spins is not dependent on pulsatile flow. Consequently, not only arterial structures, but also venous structures can easily be visualized.

Nine patients had clinical symptoms of active disease. Gd-enhanced T1WI showed at least one lesion that appeared to correspond with newly reported symptoms or signs. In addition, three clinically stable patients showed enhancement. Enhancement was best seen on 3-minute T1WI. HICT scans showed enhancement in four of the nine patients with active disease and in none of five clinically stable patients. Gd-enhanced MR imaging appears to be more sensitive than HICT in the detection of the transient abnormalities of the blood-brain barrier that occur in patients with active MS and appears capable of distinguishing active lesions that may correspond to the anatomic regions responsible for abnormal clinical findings.\r"

First, for a single patient with proved hepatic metastases, a variety of imaging sequences is discussed and evaluated, leading to characterization of the patient's hepatic tissues. Then the characteristics of the tissues of a representative patient population are presented. These are used to determine two optimal pulse sequences that maximize the achievable signal difference-to-noise ratio achievable in a fixed imaging time. The recommended imaging sequence for detection of hepatic metastases at 0.15 T is either a three-dimensional volume spin-echo (SE) sequence with echo time (TE) = 12 msec and repetition time (TR) = 184 msec or a multisection inversion recovery sequence with TE = 22 msec, inversion time = 250 msec, and TR = 1,375 msec. The variation of this optimum pulse sequence with field strength is also presented.\r"

The rate of bone loss may accelerate near the time of menopause and continue for several years thereafter. Women with low baseline bone mass and women who are fast bone losers are potentially at risk for early spinal osteoporosis. In a prospective longitudinal study, spinal trabecular bone mineral content (BMC) of 83 healthy women, 47-53 years old, was measured with use of computed tomography (CT) at 0, 12, 24, and 36 months. Fifty-four of these same women had a fifth measurement at 48 months. In 51 women the rate of bone loss was less than or equal to 2% per year (average 1.96%; normal bone losers); in 32, it was more than 2% per year (average 5.61%; fast bone losers). CT studies can identify women with low spinal trabecular BMC and/or fast bone loss--women likely to be at increased risk for early spinal osteoporosis. This information may be useful in selection of candidates for vigorous preventive measures, including estrogen replacement.\r"

All MR imaging studies included T1-weighted images (T1WI) (repetition times [TR] of 400-1,000 msec, and echo times [TE] of 20-25 msec), and 15 included T2-weighted images (T2WI) (TR = 2,000-2,500 msec; TE = 60-80 msec). MR signal features of the lesions were compared with features on the corresponding CT scans. Abnormalities in the superoanterior aspect of the femoral head were noted on both image types in all 21 lesions but were more obvious on MR images in two. A characteristic margin of peripheral sclerosis seen on CT scans in 95% (20 of 21) of lesions corresponded to a line of low intensity on MR images. Fractures complicating AVN were seen in eight lesions at CT scanning. On T1WI, fractures were not clearly delineated. On T2WI, fractures were of high intensity but were depicted less clearly than on CT scans. Central signal intensity of the lesions on T1WI correlated with the presence or absence of fracture: 88% (seven of eight) of the lesions with fractures appeared less intense than fat, compared with only 8% (one of 13) of lesions without fractures (P less than .005). While MR imaging is a sensitive method for early diagnosis of AVN, CT scanning can more accurately identify fractures and is thus important for staging.\r"

The tendons and associated soft-tissue and bony structures, such as the calcaneofibular ligament, superior and inferior peroneal retinacula, fibular groove, and peroneal tubercle, which have heretofore evaded documentation on routine radiographs, are illustrated and discussed. Special attention is given to normal variations such as convex fibular tip and enlarged peroneal tubercle, which predispose the peroneal tendons to abnormal mechanical stresses. Examples of CT-established peroneal tendon abnormalities in the 30 cases examined are also demonstrated. These abnormalities include subluxation, dislocation, entrapment, and tenosynovitis of the peroneal tendons. The authors believe CT has proved to be an extremely useful and relatively noninvasive imaging tool for the evaluation of peroneal tendon injuries.\r"

Surgical findings were the objective measure of accuracy. Fifty-two patients underwent all imaging studies. Studies were evaluated for disease location and type (bone vs. soft tissue). Twenty-eight patients underwent subsequent cervical surgery at 39 levels form an anterior interbody approach. Predictions made with SCMR imaging were surgically confirmed in 74% of patients, with CTM in 85%, and with MM in 67%. There was 90% agreement with surgical findings when SCMR imaging and CTM were used jointly, and 92% agreement when CTM and MM were used jointly, In general, SCMR imaging was as sensitive as CTM for identification of disease level, but not as specific for type of disease. MM was the modality least specific for disease type. The major advantage of CTM was its ability to distinguish bone from soft tissue, for which contrast material is unnecessary. SCMR imaging is a viable alternative to MM and, together with computed tomography, if needed, provides a thorough examination of the cervical region.\r"

T1- and T2-weighted images were obtained in sagittal and coronal planes. The MR findings were correlated with detailed operative reports and diagrams. There were 11 microadenomas and 17 macroadenomas. Ten of the microadenomas and all of the macroadenomas were accurately localized and their extent delineated, particularly on T1-weighted coronal sections. Adenomas typically appeared hypointense on T1-weighted coronal sections. The appearance on T2-weighted images was variable, and generally the lesions were less well seen. Involvement of parasellar structures, particularly the optic chiasm and cavernous sinuses, was accurately depicted. Cyst formation and hemorrhage could be characterized in some instances. In general, there was excellent correlation between MR imaging and operative findings.\r"

The interaction of these mechanisms is complex, but their composite effects can be accounted for by two main categories of flow phenomena: time-of-flight effects and spin-phase changes. Of these two mechanisms only the time-of-flight effect known as flow-related enhancement produces augmentation of intravascular signal. Flow-related enhancement can potentially provide positive contrast of diagnostic value in terms of anatomic depiction of vascular detail as well as physiologic characterization of blood flow. The authors have used a single-section, selectively irradiated, spin-echo pulse sequence to maximize flow-related enhancement within a variety of intracranial lesions, as a supplement to their regular imaging. The technique was found to be diagnostically useful in improving the conspicuity of vascular lesions, in determining vessel patency, in distinguishing flow void from calcification, and in obtaining semiquantitative information about flow dynamics.\r"

  ".W": "Physiologic cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pulsation causes a harmonic modulation of proton precessional phase with two-dimensional Fourier transform (2DFT) imaging, which results in predictable regions of signal loss and the presence of phase-shift images (\"ghost images\"). CSF that is not pulsating exhibits a higher signal than does pulsatile CSF. This phenomenon can be diagnostically useful in disease entities associated with decreased CSF pulsation amplitude, such as arachnoid cyst, intraventricular cyst, spinal stenosis, and spinal block caused by extramedullary or epidural tumor. Unfortunately, this increased signal can also mimic disease such as epidural tumor in the spine or acoustic neuroma in the internal auditory canal. An abnormal pattern of CSF pulsation, as occurs in patients with arachnoiditis, can cause unusual areas of signal loss, which complicate image interpretation and can mimic pathologic conditions. Recognition of CSF pulsation effects will increase in importance as thin-section magnetic resonance imaging becomes more common, because thin sections enhance these effects with 2DFT.\r"

The section can be varied from 4 mm thick to full thickness projection. Taken singly, each image provides direct assessment of flow direction and velocity. Subtraction of image pairs eliminates signal detected from stationary protons, producing images of pulsatile flow. In this study the technique was used to image the flow of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in healthy subjects and in one patient with syringohydromyelia. The data suggest that multiphasic MR imaging provides a powerful means for the noninvasive assessment of CSF pulsatile flow dynamics and may have potential clinical application for the investigation of a variety of abnormalities such as normal pressure hydrocephalus, syrinx, and spinal block.\r"

Five patients had numerous periventricular and deep white-matter lesions, probably due to chronic ischemic disease. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging was performed 4-30 days after the ictus, preceded by computed tomography (CT) in all but one case. In most cases, the nonenhanced spin-echo (SE) images, obtained at 500-msec repetition times and 30-msec echo times, failed to demonstrate the infarct, and in general the gadolinium-enhanced SE 500/30 images matched the contrast material-enhanced CT scans in pattern. Periventricular lesions and small, deep, white-matter infarcts that were chronic and asymptomatic were not enhanced by gadolinium MR. However, three small, symptomatic capsular and brain-stem infarcts showed definite enhancement. Usually the enhancement was visible at 3 minutes, increasing to a peak at 30 minutes. At 55 minutes, the enhancement increased in the medium-aged infarcts (8-14 days), while it decreased in the late infarcts (15-30 days). The T2 relaxation time-weighted pulse sequences were most sensitive for demonstrating all infarcts, but without the aid of a contrast agent, they were frequently poor in specificity.\r"

A method of spatially resolved spectroscopy (SPARS), combined with techniques to suppress water signal, was used to overcome this problem. By means of SPARS, a signal can be obtained from a particular volume only, with no signal from the rest of the sample. Thus, a volume in the brain can be selected, and intense lipid signals from other tissue are suppressed. The SPARS technique is based on the use of pulsed magnetic field gradients, which makes it possible to select the sensitive volume on the basis of an MR image. Suppression of the intense water signal was achieved by applying a 1331 observation pulse. With these techniques, N-acetyl aspartate was successfully measured in the human brain with a 1.5-T whole-body imager, and lactate was observed in excised brain tissue of a pig. Measurement of low molecular weight metabolites has potential significance in evaluating patients with diseases of the brain; further studies are underway to assess this potential.\r"

In five of the seven patients with normal saline requirements there was no filling of superficial veins, and two showed filling in the flaccid state only. Of the thirteen patients whose conditions were diagnosed as venous leakage, seven underwent surgical ligation of superficial veins and deep penile vein arterialization by a saphenous vein bypass graft between the superficial femoral artery and deep penile vein. All these patients had reduced saline requirements postoperatively. When cavernosography is performed in the flaccid state only, filling of superficial veins can occur normally; therefore, these studies should be performed with artificial erection.\r"

To evaluate the mechanism of active erection, 69 patients also received intracavernous injections of papaverine. Venous leakage was found in 88 patients. In these patients, a higher than normal rate of flow of diluted, heparinized contrast medium was required to initiate and maintain erection. Opacification of the prostatic plexus also occurred during erection in these patients. In all patients who received papaverine, the flow rates required to initiate and maintain erection decreased.

Two patients experienced transient hypotension during induction of regional anesthesia. There were no other complications. Twelve patients who had previous biliary manipulations with only intravenously administered analgesia reported excellent pain relief with regional anesthesia and expressed a preference for regional anesthesia should another procedure be necessary.

  ".W": "After more than 30 years of experience in the United States with high-osmolality, ionic, radiopaque contrast media (HOCM), low-osmolality contrast media (LOCM), both ionic and nonionic, have recently been introduced into the marketplace. Under the current atmosphere of cost controls (prospective payment system) and consumerism in medicine, the higher cost of these newer agents has sparked heated debate, with the lingering question, \"Can we afford to use them?\" The new LOCM are not the only \"expensive\" drugs undergoing an economically constrained introduction into clinical practice, but they represent a significant challenge for radiologists in terms of our doctor-patient relationships and the monetarization of medical care. Review of the extensive literature documenting improvement in patient acceptance, tolerance, and safety, with equal or improved diagnostic efficacy, suggests that the question now at hand is, \"Can we afford not to use them?\" This premise is discussed with text and references designed to aid the practicing radiologist and referring physician in developing guidelines for utilization of the new LOCM.\r"

  ".W": "Two patients with surgically and angiographically proved partially thrombosed giant aneurysms of the middle cerebral artery were studied with computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. MR and histopathologic findings were correlated. The central location of methemoglobin, with its high intensity (surrounding the patent lumen, seen as signal void), in giant aneurysms is directly opposite the initial peripheral appearance of methemoglobin in extra-aneurysmal intracerebral hematomas. More peripherally, the thrombosed portion of the lumen is layered with intensities that represent stages of clot (methemoglobin and hemosiderin). Three characteristics enable differentiation of giant aneurysms from intracerebral hematoma: signal void in residual patent lumen; laminated, staged thrombus with intervening layers of hemosiderin and methemoglobin that is initially centrally, rather than only peripherally, located; and signal void in the vessel from which the aneurysm arises. Hemorrhage from prior bleeding can be readily identified and separated from perianeurysmal edema on MR images. MR appears to be a specific, noninvasive method for diagnosing partially thrombosed giant intracranial aneurysms and is superior to CT and angiography in characterizing these lesions.\r"

Low attenuation in the putamina on computed tomography (CT) scans is considered to be characteristic of the disease. The authors used CT to study five patients, in three of whom the disease was confirmed histologically. In one of the patients with documented SNE, there was extensive gray matter lucency with normal basal ganglia. CT scans obtained in a second patient showed diffuse, diseased white matter with focal cortical extension and bilateral caudate involvement. In the other three cases, CT scans revealed the usual changes that occur in the basal ganglia. The appearance of SNE on CT scans thus reflects the variable and widespread distribution of the disease. The absence of radiologically detectable abnormalities in the basal ganglia should not deter one from the diagnosis of Leigh disease given in the appropriate clinical context.\r"

Initial treatment was pharmacologic in nine patients, with fluid in 14 and combined fluid-pharmacologic in seven. All nine patients treated initially with epinephrine required fluid volume administration to restore blood pressure. Thirteen of 14 patients initially treated with fluids (0.5-3 liters) required no other therapy. All patients treated with the combined regimen responded satisfactorily. Complications of drug therapy included six-beat ventricular tachycardia and ventricular bigeminy (epinephrine) and exacerbated hypotension (diphenhydramine hydrochloride). No pulmonary edema was encountered as a complication of fluid therapy. Fluid therapy, alone or with drugs, with electrocardiographic monitoring appears to be a safe and effective method of treating severe IV contrast agent-induced hypotension. Pharmacologic therapy alone in the doses the authors used is often ineffective and may cause major complications.\r"

Chest radiographs taken before biopsy were available in 26 patients, clinical information in 33, and pulmonary function data in 22. These data were reviewed independently, without knowledge of the pathologic diagnosis. The clinical symptoms of BOOP were similar to those of UIP, although the duration of symptoms was longer in UIP (P less than .05), and the prevalence of systemic symptoms was higher in BOOP (P less than .025). The physical findings were similar except that finger clubbing was more common in patients with UIP than in those with BOOP (P less than .01). There was no significant difference in lung volumes, flows, or diffusing capacity between BOOP and UIP. The chest radiograph showed distinguishing features between UIP and BOOP in 23 of 26 patients. The most characteristic radiologic finding in BOOP was the presence of patchy areas of air-space consolidation (eight of 11 patients).\r"

Scans obtained with the patients' arms placed at their sides resulted in more clearly interpretable scans, especially when arm weakness or lymphedema precluded symmetric elevation of the arms out of the CT gantry. Radiation therapy produced both acute and chronic changes with characteristic CT appearances. The postoperative anatomy varied markedly depending on the previous surgery.

Of 142 patients with nonpalpable invasive lesions who underwent axillary dissection, 42 (30%) had histologically confirmed axillary metastases. Although these invasive lesions may be clinically occult, they are not inconsequential and demand appropriate treatment. For those patients in this series undergoing mastectomy, the frequency of multicentric cancer in the same breast was 39%. The past 10 years have witnessed a trend in surgical management away from the standard radical or modified radical mastectomy toward limited surgery and radiation therapy for so-called early breast cancer. When planning treatment for these occult lesions, one must consider their biological potential to metastasize as well as their propensity for multicentricity.\r"

A total of 97% of ASDs were correctly identified at high levels of specificity (primum, 100%; secundum, 96%; common atrium, 100%). Sensitivity and specificity are illustrated by receiver operating characteristic curves. Pulmonary veins were demonstrated at rates exceeding those reported for echocardiography. Further, all cases of anomalous pulmonary venous connection proved by angiography were also demonstrated by MR. Thus, MR has high sensitivity and specificity in the diagnosis and location of atrial-level shunts and is at least as accurate as, and possibly more accurate than, traditional techniques for the diagnosis of anomalous pulmonary venous connection.\r"

Six complications occurred in the 388 patients with pulmonary hypertension and/or elevated right ventricular end-diastolic pressure (RVEDP).

This conjugate was tested in varying doses for in vivo biodistribution and effectiveness in tissue relaxation. After intravenous injection of the agent in rats, T1 relaxation times were significantly reduced in samples of the blood and in lung, heart, spleen, kidney, and brain tissue. These effects persisted at a relatively constant level for the next 30 minutes. In vivo magnetic resonance imaging of the heart and lungs of rats and rabbits confirmed the prolonged contrast-enhancing effect of the labeled albumin. These preliminary studies indicate that paramagnetically labeled macromolecules that distribute in the intravascular space may be effective for MR imaging evaluation of tissue blood volume.\r"

In three (6%) patients small subcapsular fluid collections of uncertain cause were seen. Treated kidneys showed a statistically significant mean increase in size (9%) after ESWL, as measured at the axial level of the major stone fragment. Perinephric soft-tissue stranding and fascial thickening were seen in 37 (70%) of 53 treated renal fossae, with the changes ranging from mild to severe. The authors conclude that while most patients undergoing ESWL will show some posttreatment abnormality on CT scans, the procedure appears to be associated with a low frequency of serious renal trauma.\r"

Effects occurred within 30 minutes of injection and persisted for more than 6 months. MR imaging with pulse sequences that provide T2-dependent contrast demonstrated that ferrite produced profound signal loss from liver, spleen, and bone marrow. Sequestration of ferrite particles in hepatic reticuloendothelial cells was confirmed by means of light and electron microscopy. Because ferrite has a potent effect on MR signal and exhibits tissue-specific localization, it warrants further study as a contrast agent for MR imaging of the reticuloendothelial system (i.e., liver, spleen, and bone marrow).\r"

  ".W": "The potential of superparamagnetic ferrite particles to enhance detection of liver carcinoma at magnetic resonance (MR) imaging was studied with in vitro MR spectroscopy and in vivo MR imaging in animal models. After intravenous administration of ferrite, MR spectroscopy showed selective shortening of T2 relaxation times in normal liver but not in tumor. MR imaging showed that ferrite produced profound signal loss only from normal liver and not tumor; thus, differences in signal intensity between liver and tumor were greatly enhanced, especially on pulse sequences with T2-dependent contrast. Motion artifacts were reduced as well because of less signal from liver. Microscopic analysis showed sequestration of ferrite particles in hepatic reticuloendothelial cells but not in hepatocytes or tumor tissue, and there was no evidence of cellular injury. Ferrite particles efficiently and predictably enhance signal differences between normal liver and tumor and permit considerable latitude in selection of pulse sequence and timing parameters. Thus, they have considerable promise as a tissue-specific MR contrast agent for improved detection of liver carcinoma.\r"

  ".W": "To establish the normal appearance of the neonatal brain, 51 neonates, 29-42 weeks postconception, underwent magnetic resonance (MR) imaging with a 0.6-T magnet in a prospective study. T1-weighted images were used to devise stages for the appearance of gray-white matter differentiation and extent of myelination. The results show that from 29 to 42 weeks postconception, changes in gray-white matter differentiation and myelination follow the stages in an orderly and predictable fashion. Changes in white matter intensity appear related to progressive decrease in brain water content. Myelination progresses cephalad from the brain stem at 29 weeks to reach the centrum semiovale by 42 weeks. Delayed myelination, defined as the absence of myelin in the corona radiata by 37 weeks, was seen in nine infants with complicated perinatal courses. Awareness of these developmental features should help to minimize misinterpretation of normal changes in the neonatal brain and lead to earlier detection of pathologic conditions, both with MR imaging and computed tomography.\r"

In 45 neonates, the ventricular/brain ratio (V/B) at the level of the frontal horns and midbody of the lateral ventricles ranged from 0.26 to 0.34. In six other infants a V/B of 0.36 or greater was associated with either cerebral atrophy or obstructive hydrocephalus. The width of the extracerebral space measured along specified points varied little in the neonatal period and ranged from 0 to 4 mm in 48 infants. Extracerebral space widths of 5-6 mm were seen in three other infants with severe asphyxia. Prominence of the subarachnoid space overlying the posterior parietal lobes is normal in neonates and should not be confused with cerebral atrophy. The authors conclude that V/B ratios of 0.26-0.34 and extracerebral space widths of 0-4 mm represent the normal range, and that neonates whose measurements exceed these values should be followed up.\r"

Gated magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and cineangiography of the aorta were performed before angioplasty in all 12 children. In six of the nine children treated with angioplasty, MR imaging was performed between 1 day and 4 months later. Correlation with cineangiography showed that MR imaging accurately delineated the site and characteristics of the coarctation before balloon angioplasty. After balloon dilation, MR demonstrated a significant increase in the diameter of the aorta at the coarctation site in four patients and no change in two patients. No complications such as aneurysm formation, dissection, or hematoma were detected as a result of balloon angioplasty in the follow-up MR studies. A decrease in the number and size of collateral vessels was identified in successfully treated patients. MR was useful in identifying patients who were unlikely to benefit from angioplasty, determining the appropriate balloon size for angioplasty, and noninvasively monitoring patients who underwent angioplasty.\r"

Its characteristics are similar to those of a recently recognized entity reported in ten patients in the rheumatology literature. It is believed that the alterations represent a crystal-induced arthropathy because these crystals are known to cause destructive arthropathy in extra-spinal sites, the association of crystal deposits and chronic renal disease in patients undergoing dialysis is well recognized, and calcium hydroxyapatite and calcium pyrophosphate have been recovered from biopsy material in two of the reported 14 cases. Patients with chronic renal disease in whom a rapidly destructive spinal arthropathy develops should have a biopsy of the affected area to exclude infection. Because a crystal-induced destructive process may simulate infection, crystalline analysis should also be performed on the biopsy material.\r"

In addition, three fresh cadaveric spines were evaluated with MR imaging and subsequently sectioned for anatomic and histologic correlation. Macroscopic evaluation of the sectioned cadaveric specimens revealed well-defined, yellow areas within the bone marrow that correlated precisely with localized zones of signal intensity characteristic of fat on MR images. Histologic evaluation of these regions demonstrated typical focal fatty replacement of hematopoietic bone marrow. Their appearance was related to age and the presence of pathologic changes such as spondylitis, kyphoscoliosis, and spondylosis. Based upon these observations, focal fatty replacement of hematopoietic bone marrow appears to be a common phenomenon that should not be confused with localized disease processes.\r"

Data stratified as to the level of experience indicate a sharp improvement of the rate of failure and complications from 61% during the learning period to 18% thereafter. Inexperience and faulty technique rate highest as a cause for failure or complication. Underlying pathologic conditions and anatomic variants, while a relatively rare cause of failure or complication, can be diagnosed preoperatively and appropriate modification of technique instituted. The impact of technical factors such as the size of the postoperative nephrostomy tube is shown by statistical data.\r"

Increased signal in adjacent muscle was present in 22 patients, including 13 of 25 with primary or secondary malignancies of the musculoskeletal system. Biopsy specimens from the affected area in 11 of these 13 patients revealed edema (n = 8) more often than tumor invasion (n = 3). Nine of 25 patients with nonneoplastic processes had increased signal intensity in skeletal muscle because of infection, myositis, or hematoma. In patients who have not undergone previous surgery or radiation therapy and are without an inflammatory mass, increased signal intensity may be a useful indicator of malignancy.\r"

  ".W": "Quantitative computed tomography (QCT) has been used with variable success to measure the density of lung nodules, bone, and kidney stones and to determine volumes of tumor. Commercially available CT scanners vary in their ability to quantify high-atomic-number (high-Z) and low-Z components accurately and reproducibly. Sixteen models of CT scanners from eight manufacturers were compared as to their capability for QCT. Field uniformity was determined in phantoms simulating the human torso. For high-Z (250 HU) materials, the difference in CT numbers from the center to a radial distance of 13 cm ranged from 1 to 50 HU (mean, 15 HU); for water, the range was 0-15 HU. Accuracy of computed radiographic localizer systems ranged from +/- 0.5 to +/- 2.0 mm without gantry angulation and up to +/- 4 mm with an angled gantry. A variety of artifacts also reduced QCT accuracy and reproducibility. Thus, not all CT scanners are equally suited to QCT, and results on one machine may not be comparable to those of another unless correction factors are used.\r"

In the decade 1970-1980, x-ray film sales increased 57%, while the number of all types of hospital-based x-ray examinations increased by over 60%. Increases have occurred not only in hospital-based examinations but in private office examinations as well.
