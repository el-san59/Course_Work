  ".W": "We compared the activity and physiologic effects of cardiac angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) using isovolumic hearts from male Wistar rats with left ventricular hypertrophy due to chronic experimental aortic stenosis and from control rats. In response to the infusion of 3.5 X 10(-8) M angiotensin I in the isolated buffer perfused beating hearts, the intracardiac fractional conversion to angiotensin II was higher in the hypertrophied hearts compared with the controls (17.3 +/- 4.1% vs 6.8 +/- 1.3%, P less than 0.01). ACE activity was also significantly increased in the free wall, septum, and apex of the hypertrophied left ventricle, whereas ACE activity from the nonhypertrophied right ventricle of the aortic stenosis rats was not different from that of the control rats. Northern blot analyses of poly(A)+ purified RNA demonstrated the expression of ACE mRNA, which was increased fourfold in left ventricular tissue obtained from the hearts with left ventricular hypertrophy compared with the controls. In both groups, the intracardiac conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II caused a comparable dose-dependent increase in coronary resistance. In the control hearts, angiotensin II activation had no significant effect on systolic or diastolic function; however, it was associated with a dose-dependent depression of left ventricular diastolic relaxation in the hypertrophied hearts. These novel observations suggest that cardiac ACE is induced in hearts with left ventricular hypertrophy, and that the resultant intracardiac activation of angiotensin II may have differential effects on myocardial relaxation in hypertrophied hearts relative to controls.\r"

  ".W": "A cystic fibrosis trachea cDNA library was constructed and probed with a synthetic oligonucleotide containing a consensus sequence recently identified in human intestinal mucin. One of the isolated clones, AMN-22, has been characterized extensively. The cDNA sequence of this 884-bp fragment was determined, and revealed a tandem repeat structure rich in threonine and proline residues. The repeating sequence of AMN-22 was similar but not identical to that determined for gut mucin. When examined by Northern analysis, the mRNA hybridizing to AMN-22 is extremely polydisperse in cystic fibrosis (CF) trachea, with apparent message length varying from approximately 2 kb to greater than 10 kb. A similar pattern was observed, with less abundant message, in CF bronchiectatic lung parenchyma. The lung cDNA hybridized to a similarly polydisperse message in ulcerative colitis colon RNA, but did not hybridize to control RNA from U937 lymphoma cells or stomach RNA. Pedigree analysis of restriction digests of genomic DNA revealed a pattern indicating a single polymorphic locus for the mucin gene expressed in the lung and the intestine. Southern analyses of human:mouse somatic cell hybrid cell lines allow a chromosomal localization for the mucin gene to human chromosome II, within the region 11p13-11pTer. Taken together, these data demonstrate that a polymorphic gene encodes a mucin core polypeptide expressed in both lung and intestine.\r"

  ".U": "91072668\r", 
  ".W": "The carboxy-terminal region of protein S has been recently been observed to be involved in the interaction between protein S and C4b-binding protein (Walker, F. J. 1989. J. Biol. Chem. 264:17645-17658). A synthetic peptide, GVQLDLDEAI, corresponding to that region of protein S has been used to investigate the protein S/C4b-binding protein interaction in vitro and in vivo. Rabbit activated protein C possesses species-specific anticoagulant activity for which rabbit protein S functions as a cofactor. In plasma, rabbit protein S is found in complex with C4b-binding protein. GVQLDLDEAI can inhibit this interaction, resulting in enhancement of the anticoagulant activity of rabbit activated protein C. The effect of the peptide can be blocked by the concurrent addition of human or rabbit C4b-binding protein. When infused into rabbits, GVQLDLDEAI was cleared from the circulation with a half-life of 80 min. This is significantly less rapid than the clearance of similarly sized control peptides (half-life of 15 min), but much more than that of bovine protein S, a much larger protein (half-life of 15 h). Plasma samples removed from the rabbits after infusion with GVQLDLDEAI were found to have increased concentrations of free protein S and to show enhanced anticoagulation by rabbit activated protein C ex vivo in a dose-dependent manner. The concentration for half-maximal effect (5 microM) was very similar to that observed in vitro. These results suggest that the formation of a complex between protein S and C4b-binding protein is important in the regulation of protein S activity in vivo, and that modulation of this interaction allows one to influence the anticoagulant activity of the protein C pathway.\r"

  ".W": "The major purpose of this research was to gain insight into the effect of carbohydrate malabsorption on fecal water output. To do this we measured daily fecal output of total carbohydrate, reducing sugars, and organic acids (a product of bacterial fermentation). Normal subjects were studied in their native state and when diarrhea was induced by mechanisms that did and did not involve carbohydrate malabsorption. Patients with malabsorption syndrome were also studied. We concluded that: (a) Excretion of carbohydrate and its breakdown products can be expressed as a single number by converting organic acids to their monosaccharide equivalents. (b) Diarrhea per se causes only a trivial increase in fecal carbohydrate excretion. (c) The molar output of osmotic moieties in feces due to unabsorbed carbohydrate can be determined by adding fecal reducing sugars to organic acids and their obligated cations. This expression parallels almost exactly the effect of increasing doses of lactulose (a nonabsorbable sugar) on fecal water output; one excreted millimole obligates 3.5 g of stool water. This relationship can be used to predict the effect of carbohydrate malabsorption on stool water output in patients with diarrhea. (d) 12 of 19 patients with malabsorption syndrome due to various diseases had excessive fecal excretion of carbohydrate and its breakdown products; of the diseases that cause malabsorption syndrome, combined small and large bowel resection is most likely to result in excessive fecal excretion of carbohydrate and monosaccharide equivalents. In 6 of these 19 patients carbohydrate malabsorption appeared to be the major cause of diarrhea.\r"

  ".W": "Cellular constituents of the alveolar-capillary wall may be key participants in the recruitment of polymorphonuclear leukocytes to the lung through the generation of the novel neutrophil chemotactic peptide interleukin-8 (IL-8). This interaction appears to occur via the ability of human alveolar macrophage (AM)-derived monokines, tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and interleukin-1 (IL-1) to induce gene expression of IL-8 from pulmonary type II-like epithelial cells (A549). Northern blot analysis demonstrated that steady-state IL-8 mRNA expression, by either TNF- or IL-1 beta-treated A549 cells, occurred in both a dose- and time-dependent fashion. Similarly, extracellular antigenic IL-8, as assessed by specific ELISA, was expressed from TNF- or IL-1 beta-stimulated epithelial cells in a time-dependent fashion with maximal IL-8 antigen detected at 24 h poststimulation. Immunohistochemical staining utilizing rabbit anti-human IL-8 antibody identified immunoreactive, cell-associated IL-8 antigen as early as 8 h post-TNF or IL-1 beta stimulation. A549-generated neutrophil chemotactic bioactivity paralleled IL-8 steady-state mRNA levels. Signal specificity was demonstrated in this system as IL-8 mRNA or protein expression by lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated A549 cells was not different from unstimulated cells. Although LPS did not serve as a direct stimulus for the production of IL-8 by type II-like epithelial cells, the condition media from LPS-challenged AM induced a significant expression of IL-8 mRNA by the A549 cells. 24-h conditioned media from LPS-treated cells was as potent as either IL-1 beta or TNF in generating steady-state IL-8 mRNA by A549 cells. Preincubation of LPS-treated AM-conditioned media with anti-human TNF or IL-1 beta neutralizing antibodies resulted in significant abrogation of IL-8 gene expression by A549 pulmonary epithelial cells. These findings demonstrate potential cell-to-cell communication circuits that may be important between AMs and pulmonary epithelial cells during the recruitment phase of acute lung inflammation.\r"

We have now studied the effect of 1,25(OH)2D3 on the 1,25(OH)2D receptor (VDR) in the parathyroid in vivo. Rats were injected with 1,25(OH)2D3 and the parathyroid-thyroid tissue analyzed for PTHmRNA and VDRmRNA. 1,25(OH)2D3 (50 and 100 pmol ip) decreased PTHmRNA at 6 h with a maximum at 48 h (less than 4% of basal), whereas VDRmRNA was increased only after 6 h with a 1.7-fold increase at 24 h. VDRmRNA levels peaked at 25 pmol 1,25(OH)2D3 with a twofold increase. Serum calcium did not affect VDRmRNA. Parathyroid VDRmRNA ran at 2.2 and 4.4 kb, whereas duodenum VDRmRNA had a single band, all of which increased after 1,25(OH)2D3. Weanling rats on a vitamin D-deficient diet for 3 wk had a more intense 2.2-kb transcript, whereas vitamin D-replete rats had a more intense 4.4-kb band. Dispersed parathyroid-thyroid cells were separated by a flow cytometry (FACS) into a parathyroid cell peak containing PTHmRNA and a second peak with cells positive for thyro-globulin mRNA and calcitonin mRNA. VDRmRNA was concentrated in the parathyroid cell peak. In situ hybridization of parathyroid-thyroid and duodenum for VDRmRNA showed its localization to the parathyroid cells and the duodenal mucosa. Therefore, the VDRmRNA in the parathyroid-thyroid tissue represents predominantly parathyroid cell and not C-cell VDRmRNA which is also a 1,25(OH)2D3 target organ. The increased VDR gene expression in the parathyroid cell would amplify the effect of 1,25(OH)2D3 to decrease PTH gene transcription.\r"

  ".W": "Transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) is a key regulator of cell growth and differentiation. Under normal physiological conditions, it is made as a biologically latent complex whose significance is unknown. Previous work has indicated that active TGF-beta 1 has a very short plasma half-life in rats (Coffey, R. J., L. J. Kost, R. M. Lyons, H. L. Moses, and N. F. La-Russo. 1987. J. Clin. Invest. 80:750-757). We have investigated the possibility that latent complex formation may extend the plasma half-life of TGF-beta 1 and alter its organ distribution. Radiolabeled latent TGF-beta 1 was formed by noncovalent association of 125I-TGF-beta 1 with the TGF-beta 1 precursor \"pro\" region from recombinant sources. TGF-beta 1 in this latent complex had a greatly extended plasma half-life (greater than 100 min) in rats compared with active TGF-beta 1 (2-3 min). Whereas active TGF-beta 1 was rapidly taken up by the liver, kidneys, lungs, and spleen and degraded, TGF-beta 1 in the latent complex was largely confined to the circulation, and was less than 5% degraded after 90 min. The pharmacokinetics of TGF-beta 1 in the latent complex were shown to be critically dependent on the degree of sialylation of the complex. The results suggest that formation of latent complexes may switch endogenous TGF-beta 1 from an autocrine/paracrine mode of action to a more endocrine mode involving target organs distant from the site of synthesis.\r"

Consequently, glucose, glucagon, catecholamine, and pancreatic polypeptide responses to insulin-induced hypoglycemia and to stimulation with arginine and secretin were examined in 38 diabetic pancreas recipients, 54 type I diabetic nonrecipients, and 26 nondiabetic normal control subjects. Glucose recovery after insulin-induced hypoglycemia in pancreas recipients was significantly improved. Basal glucagon levels were significantly higher in recipients compared with nonrecipients and normal subjects. Glucagon responses to insulin-induced hypoglycemia were significantly greater in the pancreas recipients compared with nonrecipients and similar to that observed in control subjects. Glucagon responses to intravenous arginine were significantly greater in pancreas recipients than that observed in both the nonrecipients and normal subjects. No differences were observed in epinephrine responses during insulin-induced hypoglycemia. No differences in pancreatic polypeptide responses to hypoglycemia were observed when comparing the recipient and nonrecipient groups, both of which were less than that observed in the control subjects. Our data demonstrate significant improvement in glucose recovery after hypoglycemia which was associated with improved glucagon secretion in type I diabetic recipients of pancreas transplantation.\r"

Intracerebral CHO-TNF tumors produced increased serum h-cachectin/TNF levels with lethal hypophagia and weight loss (mean survival time of 11 d); these changes were not observed in association with nonsecretory control brain tumors. The metabolic consequences of intracerebral cachectin/TNF production were indistinguishable from acute, lethal starvation: whole-body lipid content was decreased significantly but protein was conserved. Although intramuscular cachectin/TNF-secreting tumors caused similar increases of serum h-cachectin/TNF levels, profound anorexia did not develop; wasting developed after a longer period of tumor burden (50 d) with classical signs of cachexia (i.e., anemia and depletion of both protein and lipid). These studies provide a reproducible animal model of site-specific cytokine production and suggest that, regardless of serum levels, cachectin/TNF produced locally in brain influences both the rate of development of wasting and its net metabolic effects.\r"

Eight individuals spanning three generations exhibited the abnormality. Although five of eight individuals had elevated total T4 concentrations, all affected individuals were clinically euthyroid and all had normal free T4 levels. Purified TTR from the propositus had an affinity for 125I-T4 three times that of control TTR. Exons 2, 3, and 4 (representing greater than 97% of the coding sequence) of the TTR gene of DNA prepared from the propositus' peripheral blood leukocytes were amplified using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and were sequenced after subcloning. Exons 2 and 3 were indistinguishable from normal. In 50% of clones amplified from exon 4, a substitution of adenine (ACC) for guanine (GCC) in codon 109 resulted in the replacement of threonine-for-alanine, a mutation confirmed by amino acid sequencing of tryptic peptides derived from purified plasma TTR. The adenine-for-guanine substitution abolishes one of two Fnu 4H I restriction sites in exon 4. PCR amplification of exon 4 of TTR and restriction digestion with Fnu 4H I confirmed that five affected family members with increased binding of 125I-T4 to TTR are heterozygous for the threonine 109 substitution that increases the affinity of this abnormal TTR for T4.\r"

  ".W": "To assess the mechanisms responsible for increased gluconeogenesis in noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), we infused [3-14C]lactate, [3-13C]alanine, and [6-3H]glucose in 10 postabsorptive NIDDM subjects and in 9 age- and weight-matched nondiabetic volunteers and measured systemic appearance of alanine and lactate, their release from forearm tissues, and their conversion into plasma glucose (corrected for Krebs cycle carbon exchange). Systemic appearance of lactate and alanine were both significantly greater in diabetic subjects (18.2 +/- 0.9 and 5.8 +/- 0.4 mumol/kg/min, respectively) than in the nondiabetic volunteers (12.6 +/- 0.7 and 4.2 +/- 0.3 mumol/kg/min, respectively, P less than 0.001 and P less than 0.01). Conversions of lactate and alanine to glucose were also both significantly greater in NIDDM subjects (8.6 +/- 0.5 and 2.4 +/- 0.1 mumole/kg/min, respectively) than in nondiabetic volunteers (4.2 +/- 0.4 and 1.8 +/- 0.1 mumol/kg/min, respectively, P less than 0.001 and P less than 0.025). The proportion of systemic alanine appearance converted to glucose was not increased in NIDDM subjects (42.7 +/- 1.9 vs. 44.2 +/- 2.9% in nondiabetic volunteers), whereas the proportion of systemic lactate appearance converted to glucose was increased in NIDDM subjects (48.3 +/- 3.8 vs. 34.2 +/- 3.8% in nondiabetic volunteers, P less than 0.025); the latter increased hepatic efficiency accounted for approximately 40% of the increased lactate conversion to glucose. Neither forearm nor total body muscle lactate and alanine release was significantly different in NIDDM and nondiabetic volunteers. Therefore, we conclude that increased substrate delivery to the liver and increased efficiency of intrahepatic substrate conversion to glucose are both important factors for the increased gluconeogenesis of NIDDM and that tissues other than muscle are responsible for the increased delivery of gluconeogenic precursors to the liver.\r"

  ".W": "To study chronic catecholamine desensitization, mini-osmotic pumps were implanted subcutaneously to deliver NE, (0.5 micrograms/kg/min) or saline over 3-4 wk in dogs instrumented with left ventricular (LV) pressure gauges and arterial and left atrial pressure catheters. An acute challenge to NE (0.4 micrograms/kg/min) in intact, conscious dogs increased LV dP/dt by 1,531 +/- 208 mmHg/s before NE pumps, and by a similar amount, 1,340 +/- 166 mmHg/s, 3-4 wk after NE pumps. In contrast, an acute challenge to isoproterenol (ISO, 0.4 micrograms/kg/min) increased LV dP/dt by 5,344 +/- 532 mmHg/s before NE pumps, and significantly less (P less than 0.05; 2,425 +/- 175 mmHg/s) after NE pumps. In the presence of ganglionic and alpha 1-adrenergic blockades, NE (0.4 micrograms/kg/min) increased LV dP/dt by 3,656 +/- 468 mmHg/s before NE pumps and significantly less (P less than 0.01; 1,459 +/- 200 mmHg/s) after NE pumps. Confirming this, an acute challenge to NE (0.4 micrograms/kg/min) in dogs with arterial baroreceptor denervation increased LV dP/dt by 3,732 +/- 896 mmHg/s before NE pumps, and significantly less (P less than 0.05, 1,725 +/- 408 mmHg/s) after NE pumps. In addition, in cardiac denervated dogs, NE (0.4 micrograms/kg/min) increased LV dP/dt by 9,901 +/- 1,404 mmHg/s before NE pumps and significantly less (P less than 0.01, 2,690 +/- 306 mmHg/s) after NE pumps. Desensitization of heart rate responses to NE challenge was also more apparent in the absence of reflex mechanisms. Thus, neural reflex mechanisms play a major role in physiological expression of cardiac desensitization to catecholamines in conscious dogs.\r"

Since accumulation of these acyl-CoAs disrupts normal cellular regulation, the present investigation characterized metabolism in hepatocytes and liver mitochondria from rats treated subcutaneously with HCCL or saline (control) by osmotic minipump. Consistent with decreased methylmalonyl-CoA mutase activity, 14CO2 production from 1-14C-propionate (1 mM) was decreased by 76% and 82% after 2-3 wk and 5-6 wk of HCCL treatment, respectively. In contrast, after 5-6 wk of HCCL treatment, 14CO2 production from 1-14C-pyruvate (10 mM) and 1-14C-palmitate (0.8 mM) were increased by 45% and 49%, respectively. In isolated liver mitochondria, state 3 oxidation rates were unchanged or decreased, and activities of the mitochondrial enzymes, citrate synthetase, succinate dehydrogenase, carnitine palmitoyltransferase, and glutamate dehydrogenase (expressed per milligram mitochondrial protein) were unaffected by HCCL treatment. In contrast, activities of the same enzymes were significantly increased in both liver homogenate (expressed per gram liver) and isolated hepatocytes (expressed per 10(6) cells) from HCCL-treated rats. The mitochondrial protein per gram liver, calculated on the basis of the recovery of the mitochondrial enzymes, increased by 39% in 5-6 wk HCCL-treated rats. Activities of lactate dehydrogenase, catalase, cyanide-insensitive palmitoyl-CoA oxidation, and arylsulfatase A in liver were not affected by HCCL treatment. Hepatic levels of mitochondrial mRNAs were elevated up to 10-fold in HCCL-treated animals as assessed by Northern blot analysis. Thus, HCCL treatment is associated with enhanced mitochondrial oxidative capacity and an increased mitochondrial protein content per gram liver. Increased mitochondrial oxidative capacity may be a compensatory mechanism in response to the metabolic insult induced by HCCL administration.\r"

Ito cell \"activation\" during fibrogenesis is characterized by a decrease in intracellular vitamin A and an increase in cellular proliferation and collagen production. To explore the hypothesis that retinoids have the capacity to diminish Ito cell activation, cultured Ito cells were exposed to retinoic acid and its effects assessed on three key features: cell proliferation, collagen protein production and mRNA abundance, and transforming growth factor beta protein production. Retinoic acid was 100-1,000X more potent than retinol with respect to inhibition of Ito cell proliferation. Interstitial collagen and transforming growth factor beta production were also reduced by 10(-6) M retinoic acid. The relative abundance of type I collagen mRNA however, was not significantly altered. By contrast, retinoic acid administration to rats caused a marked reduction in the abundance of type I collagen mRNA in both total hepatic and purified Ito cell RNA. The relative abundance of rat hepatic fibronectin or apolipoprotein E mRNA was not significantly altered. These studies demonstrate that retinoic acid can differentially modulate several key features of hepatic fibrogenesis in vitro and in vivo.\r"

  ".U": "91072686\r", 
  ".W": "Hereditary 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25(OH)2D3] resistant rickets (HVDRR) is an autosomal recessive disease caused by target organ resistance to the action of 1,25(OH)2D3, the active form of the hormone. The defect in target cells is heterogenous and commonly appears to be a mutation in the gene encoding the vitamin D receptor (VDR). We have studied cultured skin fibroblasts and Epstein-Barr virus transformed lymphoblasts of seven family branches of an extended kindred having eight children affected with HVDRR. We have previously shown that cells from three affected children in this group contain an \"ochre\" nonsense mutation coding for a premature stop codon in exon 7 within the steroid-binding domain of the VDR gene. In the current studies, we found that cells from affected children failed to bind [3H]1,25(OH)2D3 and had undetectable levels of VDR as determined by immunoblots using an anti-VDR monoclonal antibody. Measurement of VDR mRNA by hybridization to a human VDR cDNA probe showed undetectable or decreased abundance of steady-state VDR mRNA. Parents, expected to be obligate heterozygotes, showed approximately half the normal levels of [3H]1,25(OH)2D3 binding, VDR protein, and mRNA. The mutation at nucleotide 970 (counting from the mRNA CAP site) results in the conversion of GTAC to GTAA, which eliminates an Rsa I restriction enzyme site and facilitates identification of the mutation. We found that polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of exons 7 and 8 from family members and subsequent Rsa I digestion allows detection of the specific genotype of the individuals. When Rsa I digests of PCR-amplified DNA are subjected to polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, children with HVDRR exhibit a homozygous banding pattern with loss of an Rsa I site. Parents exhibit a heterozygotic DNA pattern with detection of both normal and mutant alleles. In summary, our data show that the genetic abnormality is a point mutation within the steroid-binding domain of the VDR in all seven related families with HVDRR. Analysis of restriction fragment length polymorphism at the 970 locus of PCR-amplified DNA fragments can be used to diagnose this mutation in both affected children and parents carrying the disease.\r"

The cDNA inserts in these clones were 1,518 bases in length when overlapped, and encoded the 427-amino acid precursor of this enzyme (45,199 mol wt). This amino acid sequence included a 33-residue leader peptide moiety and a 394-amino acid subunit of the mature enzyme (41,385 mol wt). The T2 gene expression in fibroblasts from four patients with 3-ketothiolase deficiency was analyzed by Northern blotting. The T2 mRNA in all four cell lines had the same 1.7 kb as that of the control. However, the amounts of T2 mRNA differed: the content was reduced in two cell lines (cases 1 and 3), whereas it was within a normal range in others (cases 2 and 4). Pulse labeling followed by subcellular fractionation revealed that the T2 proteins in the fibroblasts from these patients are present in the mitochondria. These results suggest that different mechanisms are involved in the enzyme defects in the four patients.\r"

The metabolism of radioiodinated IgG and albumin was studied in the two patients. The total circulating and body pools of IgG were less than 28% of normal. The IgG synthetic rates were within the normal range. However, the IgG survival was short, with their respective fractional catabolic rates increased fivefold to 31% and 36% of the intravenous pool per day (normal, 6.7 +/- 2%/d). Furthermore, the patients had reduced total body pools, normal synthetic rates, and increased fractional catabolic rates for albumin. There was no proteinuria or abnormality of renal or liver function. In addition, the patients did not have circulating antibodies directed toward IgG, IgA, or albumin. Furthermore, both patients had normal fecal 51Cr-labeled albumin tests, thus excluding excessive gastrointestinal protein loss. We propose that these siblings have a previously unrecognized familial disorder characterized by reduced serum concentrations of IgG and albumin caused by a defect in endogenous catabolism, leading to a short survival of these proteins that is associated in this family with chemical diabetes and a skeletal deformity.\r"

The PBL of MG patients proliferated significantly higher than those of normal subjects (NS) in response to the purified alpha chain of the acetylcholine receptor (AChR). Anti-AChR antibody was present in sera of 88% of MG and none of the NS. The PBL B cells from MG only, when cultured with autologous T cells and stimulated with either pokeweed mitogen (69%), or AChR-alpha chain (38%), secreted antibody to AChR-alpha chain, whereas T and B cells alone secreted no antibody. T cells from PBL of MG patients were more readily cloned than T cells of NS, by limiting dilution, in the presence of recombinant IL-2 and in the absence of AChR-alpha chain. About 50% of T cell clones from MG patients, compared to none from NS, proliferated to AChR-alpha chain. This response was HLA-DR restricted. MG T cell clones did not display significant cytotoxic activity, as compared to control T cell clones. Our results indicate that in MG, 4B4+ regulatory T cells play their role in the pathogenesis of MG, not by cytotoxicity, but more likely by their ability to stimulate specific antibody production by B cells.\r"

The descending thoracic aortae of rabbits fed either normal diet, a high cholesterol diet for 2-5 wk (hypercholesterolemic, HC), or a high cholesterol diet for 6 mo (atherosclerotic, AS) were perfused in a bioassay organ chamber with physiologic buffer containing indomethacin. Despite a dramatic impairment in the vasodilator activity of endothelium-dependent relaxing factor (EDRF) released from both HC and AS aortae (assessed by bioassay), the release of nitrogen oxides (measured by chemiluminescence) from these vessels was not reduced, but markedly increased compared to NL. Thus, impaired endothelium-dependent relaxation in atherosclerosis is neither due to decreased activity of the enzyme responsible for the production of nitrogen oxides from arginine nor to arginine deficiency. Because the production of nitrogen oxides increased in response to acetylcholine in both hypercholesterolemic and atherosclerotic vessels, impairments in signal transduction are not responsible for abnormal endothelium-dependent relaxations. Impaired vasodilator activity of EDRF by cholesterol feeding may result from loss of incorporation of nitric oxide into a more potent parent compound, or accelerated degradation of EDRF.\r"

  ".W": "The interference of the recombinant HIV-1 glycoproteins gp160 and gp120 with the CD3/T cell antigen receptor (TcR)-mediated activation process has been investigated in the CD4+ diphtheria toxoid-specific human P28D T cell clone. Both glycoproteins clearly inhibit the T cell proliferation induced in an antigen-presenting cell (APC)-free system by various cross-linked monoclonal antibodies specific for the CD3 molecule or the TcR alpha chain (up to 80% inhibition). Biochemical studies further demonstrate that exposure of the T cell clone to both glycoproteins (gps) specifically inhibits the CD3/TcR phospholipase C (PLC) transduction pathway, without affecting the CD3/TcR cell surface expression. Thus, inositol phosphate production, phosphatidic acid turnover, intracellular free calcium, and intracellular pH increase induced by CD3/TcR-specific MAbs are specifically impaired in gps-treated P28D T cells. Addition of purified soluble CD4 prevents binding of gps to T cells and overcomes all observed inhibitions. Maximal inhibitions are obtained for long-term exposure of the T cell clone to gps (16 h). No early effect of gps is observed. By contrast, gp160 and gp120 fail to suppress the CD2-triggered functional and biochemical P28D T cell responses. These results demonstrate that, in addition to their postulated role in the alteration of the interaction between CD4 on T lymphocytes and MHC class II molecules on APC, soluble HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins may directly and specifically impair the CD3/TcR-mediated activation of PLC in uninfected T cells via the CD4 molecule.\r"

Additional injections were administered if anti-antiidiotypic antibodies were not found or their titer decreased. In the first phase I trial with 16 patients the initial dose was 0.5 mg per injection and escalated to 4 mg per injection. Neither toxicity nor allergic reactions were observed despite the development of anti-mouse Ig antibodies. Minor responses were observed in three patients. In a second clinical trial MAb MF11-30 was administered to 21 patients at a dose of 2 mg per injection, since this dose had been shown in the initial study to be effective in inducing anti-antiidiotypic antibodies. Two patients were inevaluable; in the remaining 19 patients, the average duration of treatment was 34 wk. In this trial as well, neither toxicity nor allergic reactions were observed. 17 of the 19 immunized patients increased the levels of anti-mouse Ig antibodies and 16 developed antibodies that inhibit the binding of antiidiotypic MAb MF11-30 to the immunizing anti-HMW-MAA MAb 225.28. One patient increased the level of anti-HMW-MAA antibodies. One patient achieved a complete remission with disappearance of multiple abdominal lymph nodes for a duration of 95 wk. Minor responses were observed in three patients.

Vo revealed saturation kinetics (Km = 315 nM; Vmax = 361 pmol Fe3+ x min-1 x mg protein-1) was temperature dependent and inhibited by pronase pretreatment of MVM. In the presence of an inwardly directed Na(+)-gradient a typical overshoot phenomenon with maximal uptake at 30-40 s was observed. The suggestion of an active, carrier-mediated uptake mechanism for iron was pursued by isolation of a 160-kD iron-binding protein from solubilized human MVM proteins. This glycoprotein was assembled as a trimer composed of 54-kD monomers. A monospecific antibody against the 54-kD subunit inhibited vesicular influx of Fe3+ into MVM by greater than 50%. Immunofluorescence and immunoblot analysis confirmed the localization of the protein in brush border plasma membranes. It was detectable in human intestinal mucosa and liver, but not in esophagus. These data indicate that the translocation of Fe3+ across human MVM represents a facilitated transport mechanism which is, at least in part, mediated by a membrane iron-binding protein.\r"

Sera from patients with connective tissue diseases often contain antibodies against the proteins present in these snRNPs. Antibodies against the RNA components of snRNPs, the U snRNAs, are thought to be rare. We tested 118 anti-snRNP sera for the presence of anti-snRNA antibodies and found them in 45 sera (38%). In all sera the antibodies (IgG and F(ab)2 fragments thereof) were exclusively directed against U1 snRNA. The anti-(U1) RNA antibodies were always accompanied by anti-(U1)RNP antibodies but were not found in sera which contain antibodies of the Sm serotype directed against all nucleoplasmic U snRNP particles. Like anti-RNP antibodies, anti-U1 RNA activity is confined to sera from patients with SLE or SLE overlap syndromes and is rarely found in patients with other connective tissue diseases. By analyzing binding to subfragments of U1 snRNA made in vitro, it was demonstrated that anti-(U1)RNA antibodies recognize epitopes distributed throughout the U1 RNA molecule. In most sera, however, either the second or the fourth hairpin loop is the main target of the antibody. The possible mechanisms that could lead to the production of this new type of autoantibody are discussed.\r"

  ".W": "The role of pancreatic B cell dysfunction in the phase preceding clinical onset of insulin-dependent and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus has been much debated. In this investigation, the impact of a prolonged diabetic environment on pancreatic islet B cells transplanted syngeneically under the kidney capsule of C57BL/6 (B6) and C57BL/Ks (BKs) mice was studied. Alloxan-diabetic mice bearing a subcapsular islet graft insufficient to normalize the blood glucose level were rendered normoglycemic by a second intrasplenic islet graft after various period of hyperglycemia to examine the reversibility of hyperglycemia-induced B cell dysfunction. Using a perfusion technique of the graft-bearing, it was found that both strains of mice exhibited a diminished glucose-induced insulin secretion after 6 wk of hyperglycemia, when compared with normoglycemic mice carrying islet grafts. When normoglycemia was restituted by the splenic graft after 4 or 12 wk, there was a normalization of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in the renal islet grafts in B6 mice, whereas insulin secretion from the grafted BKs islets remained impaired. Morphometric measurements of the islet grafts demonstrated a 50% reduction in the graft volume in diabetic BKs mice after 12 wk, compared with normoglycemic animals, whereas no such decrease was observed in B6 mice. Islet grafts removed from hyperglycemic mice of both strains exhibited diminished insulin mRNA contents, and in the BKs mice there was also a reduced glucose oxidation rate in the islet grafts in vitro. This metabolic dysfunction can only partly be explained by a reduced graft size. The present findings emphasize the genetic constitution as a decisive factor for the survival and function during a period of sustained stress on a limited B cell mass.\r"

  ".U": "91072698\r", 
  ".W": "The role of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (1,4,5-IP3) in regulating cytosolic Ca++ by stimulating Ca++ release from intracellular organelles is well established. However, other modes of intracellular Ca++ regulation by 1,4,5-IP3 have not been determined. To determine if 1,4,5-IP3 may regulate cell cytosolic Ca++ by acting on plasma membrane bound Na(+)-Ca++ exchanger, we investigated Ca++ transport in synaptosomes using 45Ca++ as tracer. In the presence of either an inhibitor of voltage gated Na+ channels (tetrodotoxin) or the K+ ionophore (valinomycin), Ca++ uptake was significantly inhibited (P less than 0.05) by 1,4,5-IP3 in a concentration dependent manner, with half-maximal inhibition occurring at submicromolar concentrations between 10(-9) M and 10(-10) M 1,4,5-IP3. Similarly, Ca++ efflux by the exchanger was significantly inhibited 40% by 1,4,5-IP3. The inhibitory effect of 1,4,5-IP3 on the Na(+)-Ca++ exchanger was observed in the presence of Ca++ channel blockers, and in vesicles pretreated with caffeine to deplete the 1,4,5-IP3-sensitive stores of Ca++. These results suggest that during signal transduction in brain, 1,4,5-IP3 may increase cytosolic [Ca++] in part by inhibiting the Na(+)-Ca++ exchanger and thus, Ca++ efflux from cell.\r"

  ".W": "Sixty-eight cutaneous squamous cell neoplasms (in situ and invasive) and 26 basal cell carcinomas from 89 patients were analyzed for DNA sequences homologous to the human papillomavirus (HPV) types found predominantly in the genital tract. Thirty-six (53%) of the squamous cell neoplasms contained HPV DNA as detected by filter or in situ hybridization analysis. The frequency of detection of HPV DNA was dependent on the site of the lesion. Of 40 genital squamous cell neoplasms (penile, vulvar, and perianal), 27 (68%) had detectable HPV DNA. In 25 of these, the HPV type was 16 or HPV-16-related, which was similar to the results for the squamous cell neoplasms of the finger (HPV DNA in 9 of 11 tumors with HPV-16 in seven). None of 16 squamous cell neoplasms from sites other than the genital tract or the finger had detectable HPV DNA. HPV DNA was detected in one of the 26 basal cell carcinomas (4%). We conclude that, for cutaneous epithelial malignancies, HPV-16 is restricted to squamous cell neoplasms of the genital tract and finger. These data are consistent with venereal transmission of HPV-16 to the periungual region and suggests a role for this virus in the evolution of squamous cell carcinoma at this site.\r"

In addition to the extractable lipids, the residue contained an additional 0.9% lipid that could be released only after saponification. This covalently bound lipid consisted of two unusual ceramides (63.4%), omega-hydroxyacids (27.7%) and nonhydroxy fatty acids (8.8%). The composition of this bound lipid resembled that recently found in human stratum corneum, which is thought to comprise a lipid envelope on the outer surface of the corneocytes. The free and covalently bound lipids may be significant determinants of the properties of cerumen. Desquamation of corneocytes and their associated lipids from the epidermal lining of the ear canal may make a major contribution to cerumen.\r"

In five cases visceral involvement was suggestive of acute graft-versus-host disease without any drug more than \"doubtfully\" suspected. In four cases extracutaneous symptoms were absent or mild and suspect drugs (mainly sulfonamides) had been administered with a timing suggestive of \"possible\" causality. All nine patients died, mainly from infection possibly aggravated by high doses of corticosteroids. We conclude that toxic epidermal necrolysis may be more frequent than generally thought after bone marrow transplantation and has a poor prognosis. It seems to be related to a drug reaction to sulfonamides as often as to acute graft-versus-host disease.\r"

Although polypoid melanoma is considered the most malignant form of melanoma, our findings, albeit limited to three cases, suggest that early diagnosis and prompt surgical excision may provide a favorable 5-year survival rate.\r"

Four of five patients with erythrodermic stage disease had either a complete or a partial clinical remission with photopheresis alone. One patient with extensive patch/plaque disease continued to have a partial clinical remission of 7 months' duration with photopheresis alone. Of the two patients with tumor-stage disease, one remained without evidence of clinical disease at 10 months with photopheresis alone, whereas the second patient had a partial clinical remission of 5 months with a combination of local radiation therapy followed by monthly photopheresis. The skin biopsy specimen obtained from the patient with tumor-stage disease in complete clinical remission did not show cutaneous T cell lymphoma.

Angioplasty was performed on a single vessel in 70% of patients and on multiple vessels in 30%; it was performed on a totally occluded vessel in 20%. Angioplasty was successful in 90.5% of patients, unsuccessful but uncomplicated in 7.4% and complicated by myocardial infarction in 0.7%, emergency bypass surgery in 0.7% and death in 0.7%. At late (mean 3.7 +/- 3 years; range 0.5 to 11.5) follow-up study after successful angioplasty, 94% of patients were alive, 79% were free of angina and 85% had returned to work; late myocardial infarction occurred in 4%. Actuarial survival at 5 years was 95%, and 85% of patients were free from death, infarction or bypass surgery. A second angioplasty was performed in 29 patients (22%) (mean 6.1 +/- 8.4 months) and was successful in 27 (93%), with no deaths. Elective coronary bypass surgery was performed in 8.5% of patients, with perioperative infarction in 9% and no deaths. By univariate analysis, late death was more likely to occur in hypertensive patients (15% versus 2.5%; p less than 0.01) and diabetic patients (21.4% versus 3.6%; p less than 0.01). Cox proportional hazard regression analysis identified hypertension (p = 0.007) and diabetes (p = 0.04) as independent time-related predictors of subsequent death. Thus, early and late results after coronary angioplasty in young adults are favorable, but certain risk factors are important predictors of outcome. Late revascularization procedures (repeat angioplasty or surgery) for restenosis or disease progression are common.\r"

No other valve lesion, no reoperation and no congenital defects were included. The mean patient age was 62 years with 26% of the patients greater than 70 years. Twenty-six percent of the entire group was in functional class IV. Seventy-five patients received mitral valve repair and 52 underwent mitral valve replacement with a St. Jude or Hancock valve. In patients undergoing mitral valve repair, there was a higher incidence of those greater than 70 years old and of coronary artery disease and in patients undergoing mitral valve replacement there was a higher incidence of functional class IV. The operative mortality rate was 2.3% (3 of 127 patients). No patient failed to be discontinued from cardiopulmonary bypass and all three deaths occurred after mitral valve replacement, with one from complications of chronic renal failure and dialysis. There was no significant difference in patients who either did or did not have a concomitant coronary artery bypass graft and there was no difference related to age or functional class. Postoperative complications occurred in five patients in the valve repair group, including recurrent mitral regurgitation in two necessitating reoperation, and in three patients in the valve replacement group. With newer operative and postoperative management techniques, especially preservation of the papillary muscle annular continuity, the risk of mitral valve surgery, particularly of valve repair, is considerably lower than in previous years.\r"

To clarify its clinical significance, 48 patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy were analyzed. Eight patients (Group A) had apical segmental dysfunction; 40 (Group B) had normal wall motion. No patient in either group had coronary artery stenosis on selective coronary arteriography. In all patients in Group A, apical segmental dysfunction was revealed by left ventriculography; however, it could be detected by echocardiography in only two patients in Group A. Left ventricular hypertrophy by electrocardiogram (ECG) was more common in Group B (p less than 0.05). Abnormal Q waves were more frequently discovered in Group A (p less than 0.005) and were recognized predominantly in the lateral leads. On serial ECGs, a gradual development of abnormal Q waves was noted in six of eight patients in Group A. Malignant arrhythmias were more common in Group A (p less than 0.001). In two patients in Group A, left ventricular dilation and congestive heart failure developed during the follow-up period. Thus, the presence of a Q wave in the lateral leads on an ECG in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy may indicate the presence of apical segmental dysfunction. Left ventriculography should be performed to examine the presence of this abnormality and 24 h ambulatory ECG monitoring should be done to detect malignant arrhythmias in patients who have abnormal Q waves in the lateral leads. Patients with this unique type of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy need careful follow-up evaluation.\r"

  ".U": "91072828\r", 
  ".W": "Conventional coronary arteriography is able to demonstrate the presence of coronary collateral vessels but cannot delineate the specific region of myocardium to which they supply blood. To test the hypothesis that contrast echocardiography can specifically identify collateralized myocardium, contrast echocardiographic perfusion \"maps\" were compared in patients with (n = 12) and without (n = 12) angiographic evidence of coronary collateral flow, both before and after coronary angioplasty. Contrast echocardiographic images of the mid-left ventricle in the short-axis view at end-diastole were obtained after separate injections of a sonicated contrast agent into both the right and the left coronary arteries. A computer-based contouring system was used to determine the individual areas of myocardium perfused by each of the two coronary arteries and then to superimpose the images of the two perfusion beds. The resulting area of overlapping perfusion represented myocardium receiving blood flow from both coronary systems and was defined as collateralized myocardium. To normalize for heart size, overlap area was expressed as a percent of total myocardial area, which was the area between endocardium and epicardium in the short-axis view. To adjust for differences in vascular distribution, overlap area was expressed as a percent of the perfusion area of the recipient vessel. In patients with angiographic collateral flow, the recipient vessel was that vessel receiving the collateral flow. In patients without angiographic collateral flow, the right coronary artery was considered the recipient vessel. Overlap area was 1.3 +/- 0.4% of total myocardial area and 6.6 +/- 1.7% of recipient vessel area in patients without angiographic evidence of collateral flow compared with 30.6 +/- 2.5% and 89.2 +/- 6.4%, respectively, in patients with angiographic collateral flow (p less than 0.001 for both). In four patients in whom angiographic collateral flow was abolished by angioplasty, overlap area decreased from 30.3 +/- 5.3% to 6.8 +/- 2.7% of total myocardial area and from 100% to 18.5 +/- 5.4% of recipient vessel area (p less than 0.05 for both). Thus, contrast echocardiography is able to map the specific myocardial territory perfused by coronary collateral flow and document an immediate reduction in perfusion in this territory when collateral flow is abolished by angioplasty.\r"

  ".W": "The transmission of echocardiographic contrast medium and the cyclic changes in left ventricular videodensity during transpulmonary contrast echocardiography were investigated in nine adult volunteers with the use of intravenous injections of sonicated albumin (microbubble size 5.2 +/- 2.6 microns). Right and left ventricular and myocardial contrast were quantitated by videodensitometric analysis. The injections caused no symptoms, and no hemodynamic or electrocardiographic changes were observed. All injections resulted in right ventricular contrast. Mean peak right ventricular videodensity was 75 +/- 48 at end-diastole and 61 +/- 36 gray scale U/pixel at end-systole (p less than 0.05). Seventy-eight percent of injections resulted in left ventricular contrast with a mean peak videodensity of 21 +/- 33 gray scale U/pixel. Early systole was associated with a rapid decrease in left ventricular contrast intensity with near total disappearance of contrast by end-systole (from 23 +/- 33 and 17 +/- 23 U/pixel at end-diastole to 6 +/- 10 and 3 +/- 2 at end-systole at the left ventricular base and apex, respectively; p less than 0.05). None of the injections resulted in myocardial contrast enhancement by visual or quantitative analysis. Thus, left ventricular contrast echocardiography can be achieved after intravenous injections of sonicated albumin. Transpulmonary left ventricular contrast echocardiography is associated with near total disappearance of contrast during systole. This may be secondary to the destruction of microbubbles by the high left ventricular systolic pressure. These findings may help explain the limited success of this technique thus far for myocardial perfusion imaging.\r"

  ".W": "Because aortic stenosis results in the loss of left ventricular stroke work (due to resistance to flow through the valve and turbulence in the aorta), the percentage of stroke work that is lost may reflect the severity of stenosis. This index can be calculated from pressure data alone. The relation between percent stroke work loss and anatomic aortic valve orifice area (measured by planimetry from videotape) was investigated in a pulsatile flow model. Thirteen valves were studied (nine human aortic valves obtained at necropsy and four bioprosthetic valves) at stroke volumes of 40 to 100 ml, giving 57 data points. Valve area ranged from 0.3 to 2.8 cm2 and mean systolic pressure gradient from 3 to 84 mm Hg. Percent stroke work loss, calculated as mean systolic pressure gradient divided by mean ventricular systolic pressure x 100%, ranged from 7 to 68%. It was closely related to anatomic orifice area with an inverse exponential relation and was not significantly related to flow (r = -0.15). An orifice formula was derived that predicted anatomic orifice area with a 95% confidence interval of +/- 0.5 cm2 (orifice area [cm2] = 4.82 [2.39 x log percent stroke work loss], r = -0.94, SEE = 0.029). These results support the clinical use of percent stroke work loss as an easily obtained index of the severity of aortic stenosis.\r"

Eleven patients who had undergone total or partial removal of the tricuspid valve were compared with 11 age-matched control subjects; Doppler echocardiographic techniques were used to quantify changes in left ventricular filling and to relate them to changes in left ventricular and left atrial geometry caused by right ventricular and right atrial distension. The late diastolic fractional transmitral flow velocity integral, a measure of the left atrial contribution to left ventricular filling, was significantly decreased in patients undergoing tricuspid valvulectomy compared with control subjects (0.22 +/- 0.11 versus 0.32 +/- 0.09; p less than 0.04). Severe tricuspid regurgitation in these patients resulted in marked right atrial distension, reversal of the normal interatrial septal curvature and compression of the left atrium such that left atrial area was significantly smaller than in control subjects (5.9 +/- 2.2 versus 8.6 +/- 1.2 cm2/m2; p less than 0.005). Acting as a receiving chamber, the left ventricle was maximally compressed by the volume-overloaded right ventricle in late diastole, coincident with the timing of atrial systole, resulting in a significant increase in the left ventricular eccentricity index compared with that in control subjects (1.35 +/- 0.14 versus 1.03 +/- 0.1; p less than 0.001). Thus, right ventricular volume overload due to severe tricuspid regurgitation results in left heart geometric alterations that decrease left atrial preload, impair left ventricular receiving chamber characteristics and reduce the atrial contribution to total left ventricular filling.\r"

Fifty-nine patients (55 +/- 16 years of age) with technically good Doppler echocardiographic studies were studied prospectively. There were 14 normal subjects, 21 patients with left ventricular hypertrophy, 10 with dilated cardiomyopathy and 14 with other cardiac disease. The rhythm was sinus in 55 and atrial fibrillation in 4. Two distinct Doppler flow signals were detected in the left ventricular outflow tract during diastole. These were termed E' (early) and A' (active) because they occurred 40 to 100 ms after higher velocity mitral inflow E (passive filling) and A (atrial contraction) signals. Among 59 patients, E' signals were present in 48 (81%) and had a mean velocity of 0.41 +/- 0.23 m/s. In 55 patients with normal sinus rhythm, A' signals were present in 52 (95%) and had a mean velocity of 0.52 +/- 0.24 m/s. No A' signals were present in the four patients with atrial fibrillation. The E' and A' velocities by pulsed wave Doppler ultrasound were low at the left ventricular apex and increased along the basal septum in the left ventricular outflow tract. Prominent A' velocities (greater than or equal to 0.45 m/s) were seen in 62% of patients with left ventricular hypertrophy, 50% of normal subjects and 10% of patients with dilated cardiomyopathy. The A' velocity was higher in patients with left ventricular hypertrophy (0.63 +/- 0.26 m/s) than in those with a normal heart (0.45 +/- 0.16 m/s; p less than 0.05) or dilated cardiomyopathy (0.25 +/- 0.13 m/s; p less than 0.01). The major determinants of diastolic outflow tract velocity were the mitral inflow E and A velocities and left end-diastolic dimension, particularly when combined (r = 0.64, p less than 0.0001 for E'; r = 0.72, p less than 0.0001 for A'). Distinctive E' and A' Doppler outflow tract signals result from mitral inflow and may be detected in most patients with normal heart size. These E' and A' velocities increase from apex to base and are more prominent in patients with a small, normally contracting heart or left ventricular hypertrophy.\r"

  ".W": "Ten patients with chronic atrial flutter were studied prospectively using electrophysiologic mapping and pacing techniques to assess the mechanism of atrial flutter and the presence of an area of slow conduction in the atria. Electrograms recorded from greater than or equal to 30 right atrial sites for each patient during atrial flutter demonstrated that right atrial free wall activation was craniocaudal and that the interatrial septum activation was caudocranial, consistent with a reentrant circuit involving the right atrium. In six patients, slow conduction occurred during atrial flutter in the inferior right atrium and was spatially associated with fractionated electrographic recordings. In the other four patients, a \"missing\" interval of electrical activity occurred in the inferior right atrium for an average of 40% of the atrial flutter cycle. Transient entrainment criteria were demonstrated in each patient during rapid high right atrial pacing. The mean activation time from the high right atrial pacing site to the coronary sinus (inferior left atrial) recording site was long (228 ms) and consistent with activation through an area of slow conduction. During rapid pacing of atrial flutter from the coronary sinus site, no transient entrainment criteria could be demonstrated. The mean activation time from the coronary sinus pacing site to the high right atrial recording site was relatively short (134 ms) and consistent with orthodromic activation of the high right atrium not through an area of slow conduction. High right atrial pacing during sinus rhythm at rates similar to atrial flutter demonstrated a short activation time to the coronary sinus and low right atrial sites (mean 169 and 88 ms, respectively), indicating activation that did not traverse an area of slow conduction. Coronary sinus pacing during sinus rhythm demonstrated the same phenomena. Low right atrial electrograms recorded during sinus rhythm and during rapid pacing of sinus rhythm were not fractionated, although they were during atrial flutter. Thus, atrial mapping and pacing data were complementary, indicating that human atrial flutter in the patients studied was generated by a reentrant circuit in the right atrium, with an area of slow conduction in the low right atrium present only during atrial flutter.\r"

Signal-averaged ECGs were obtained during sinus rhythm from 60 patients with sustained ventricular tachycardia (Group I) and 34 patients with ventricular fibrillation (Group II). Results of signal-averaged ECG analysis were abnormal in 92% of patients with ventricular tachycardia and 85% of patients with ventricular fibrillation (p = NS). Abnormal spectra were detected in the signal-averaged ECGs from 90% of patients with ischemic and from 86% of patients with nonischemic heart disease (p = NS). In contrast, the results of programmed stimulation differed markedly between the two patient groups. Sustained ventricular arrhythmias were induced in 91% of the patients with ventricular tachycardia compared with only 46% of those with ventricular fibrillation (p less than 0.0001). Moreover, ventricular tachycardia was inducible in 81% of patients with ischemic heart disease compared with only 50% of those with nonischemic heart disease (p less than 0.02). Thus, abnormalities in the spectra of signal-averaged ECGs were found in the majority of patients with ventricular fibrillation and were detectable even in those whose arrhythmia was not inducible by programmed stimulation. These results broaden the potential clinical application of noninvasive interrogation of signal-averaged ECGs to include the prospective identification of patients with ischemic or nonischemic heart disease prone to ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation.\r"

The extent of vascular tissue resection was correlated with restenosis rates for coronary (n = 59) and vein bypass graft (n = 15) lesions. After 6 months, the overall restenosis rate was 50% (37 of 74 lesions); it was 42% (15 of 36 lesions) when intima alone was resected, 50% (7 of 14 lesions) when media was resected and 63% (15 of 24 lesions) when adventitia was resected. Subintimal tissue resection increased the restenosis rate for vein grafts (43% with intimal resection versus 100% with subintimal resection, p = 0.01) but not for coronary arteries (50% versus 48%). There was no overall difference in restenosis rates after atherectomy between primary lesions and restenosis lesions that occurred after balloon angioplasty (46% versus 54%). Among postballoon angioplasty restenosis lesions, a higher rate of restenosis after atherectomy was found with subintimal than with intimal resection (78% versus 32%, p = 0.01). Tissues from patients undergoing a second atherectomy for restenosis after initial atherectomy (n = 8) demonstrated neointimal hyperplasia that appeared histologically identical to restenotic tissue developing after balloon angioplasty (n = 37). These data suggest that the cellular response to directional coronary atherectomy is characterized by neointimal proliferation similar to that which may develop after balloon angioplasty. The extent of fibrous hyperplasia appears to be related to the depth of tissue resection in vein graft lesions and coronary artery restenosis lesions that occur after balloon angioplasty but not in primary atheromatous coronary artery lesions.\r"

Epicardial imaging showed no incidence of patch dehiscence. Residual shunting detected by color flow mapping or contrast echocardiography was graded into one of four categories (0 to III). Real time analysis of color flow mapping studies suggested no shunting (grade 0) in 2 patients, grade I shunting in 20, grade II in 8 and grade III in 1; contrast studies suggested grade 0 in 15, grade I in 6, grade II in 8 and grade III in 2. Interobserver variation in real time encoding of grade I or II shunting was 25% by color flow mapping and 6% by contrast echocardiography. Subsequent frame by frame analysis revealed that both diastolic and early systolic right ventricular turbulence gave rise to false positive results during real time analysis of color flow mapping studies. Color flow mapping allowed exact localization of residual shunting, whereas contrast echocardiography allowed better semiquantification. Postbypass results were correlated in 30 patients with late postoperative precordial studies (mean interval 7.5 months). Persistent shunts were found in 6 (20%) of 30 patients. No patient required reoperation for residual shunting. The predictive value of immediate grade I or II shunting as a marker for persistent long-term shunting was poor, whereas both patients with immediate grade III shunting had shunt persistence, indicating that immediate revision should be considered in such patients. Intraoperative epicardial ultrasound is valuable for the immediate exclusion of important residual shunting after ventricular septal defect closure. Maximal information is obtained when color flow mapping and contrast echocardiography are used in combination.\r"

The purpose of this study was to establish the prevalence of associated cardiovascular defects and the accuracy of echocardiography in patients referred for transvenous ductal closure. This study reviewed 146 patients seen from 1981 to 1988: 126 with only a patent ductus arteriosus (Group I) and 20 with additional cardiovascular anomalies (Group II). Groups I and II did not differ significantly in age, gender or physical examination except for the presence of a continuous murmur (Group I 100% versus Group II 80%, p less than 0.001). A left patent ductus arteriosus was visualized by two-dimensional echocardiography in 96% of patients and was evident by Doppler study in 100%. A patent ductus arteriosus was not seen in six patients including a patient who was found to have only a collateral network from the aorta to the main pulmonary artery. The 12 patients with noncardiovascular abnormalities such as Down's syndrome were more likely than the overall group to have additional cardiovascular anomalies (6 of 12, p = 0.001). The cardiovascular anomalies encountered were varied. Eight of the 20 patients with such anomalies had only a restrictive ventricular septal defect in addition to the patent ductus arteriosus. Significant anomalies found at catheterization included two thoracic arteriovenous malformations and an isolated right carotid artery draining into the right pulmonary artery by way of a right ductus arteriosus. This study indicates that echocardiography is an effective diagnostic technique in this patient group. A thorough cardiac catheterization with angiography should be performed before implantation of a ductal device.\r"

A miniaturized transesophageal probe (6.9 mm maximal diameter) was used in 36 patients weighting less than or equal to 20 kg. Epicardial imaging was performed with a 5 MHz precordial probe. The intraoperative transesophageal echocardiographic findings before and after cardiopulmonary bypass were correct and complete in 94% of patients. Transesophageal echocardiography correctly identified atrial septal defects, most types of ventricular septal defects, anomalous pulmonary veins, atrioventricular septal defects, tetralogy of Fallot, truncus arteriosus and double inlet ventricles. It failed to provide a correct diagnosis in only three patients, all of whom had doubly committed subarterial ventricular septal defects. Epicardial echocardiography identified all cases that had a doubly committed subarterial ventricular septal defect. A correct and complete intraoperative diagnosis was obtained with the use of epicardial imaging in 92% before and after cardiopulmonary bypass, but this technique required interruption of surgery and could not be completed in three patients because of induced arrhythmias and hypotension. These results demonstrated that intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography consistently defined important morphologic, color and pulsed Doppler ultrasound features of most congenital shunt lesions. Lesions that involved the right ventricular outflow tract are sometimes difficult to image with uniplane transesophageal echocardiography. There were no complications in any of the 50 subjects.\r"

Patients with chromosomal or syndromal associations were excluded. In the Baltimore-Washington Infant Study only echocardiographic and invasively documented cases were included. From 1983 to 1988 the birth prevalence was significantly higher in Yuma (10.5/1,000) than in Sierra Vista (5.4/1,000, p less than 0.0001). As assessed only by invasive or echocardiographic diagnosis, there was a higher birth prevalence of congenital heart disease in the study population (6.7/1,000) compared with both the Baltimore-Washington Infant Study (3.7/1,000, p = 0.0008) and Sierra Vista (4.6/1,000, p = 0.04). Families were interviewed to exclude cases in which the mother did not spend the month before conception and the first trimester in Yuma or Sierra Vista. The birth prevalence for Yuma (6.0/1,000) remained significantly greater than that for Sierra Vista (3.8/1,000, p = 0.03). The exclusion of cases in which the mother resided elsewhere suggests, but does not prove, that an environmental influence may have played a role in the increased birth prevalence of congenital heart disease in this community.\r"

Of 159 patients randomized at Westmead Hospital to the multicenter Second International Study of Infarct Survival (ISIS-2) after streptokinase and aspirin in acute myocardial infarction, 87 underwent electrophysiologic testing 6 to 28 days after infarction to determine their risk of subsequent ventricular arrhythmias (streptokinase 20 patients; aspirin 25 patients; streptokinase and aspirin 21 patients; both placebos 21 patients). Patients who underwent electrophysiologic testing had similar clinical characteristics to those of patients who did not. The stimulation protocol comprised up to and including four extrastimuli applied to the right ventricular apex at twice diastolic threshold. An abnormal result was defined as ventricular tachycardia with a cycle length greater than or equal to 230 ms lasting greater than or equal to 10 s. Ventricular tachycardia was inducible at electrophysiologic study in 8 patients who received placebo streptokinase, but in no patient who received active streptokinase (8 of 46 versus 0 of 41; p = 0.005, Fischer's exact test). Ventricular tachycardia was inducible in 4 patients who received aspirin therapy and 4 who did not (4 of 41 versus 4 of 46; p = NS). During a mean follow-up period of 39 +/- 9 months, there were no spontaneous episodes of ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation or witnessed sudden death in the streptokinase-treated group compared with three such events in the placebo-treated group (p = 0.13). When compared with placebo therapy, intravenous streptokinase substantially reduced the incidence of inducible ventricular tachycardia in infarct survivors. No similar benefit was attributable to aspirin therapy.\r"

  ".W": "In view of the high risk of sudden cardiac death and the prognostic importance of complex ventricular ectopic activity, the effects of prophylactic antiarrhythmic treatment were investigated prospectively in patients with persisting asymptomatic complex arrhythmias after myocardial infarction. End points were total mortality and arrhythmic events (sudden death, sustained ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation). Of 1,220 consecutively screened survivors of myocardial infarction, 312 had Lown class 3 or 4b arrhythmia on 24 h electrocardiographic recordings before hospital discharge and consented to the study. They were randomized to individualized antiarrhythmic treatment (Group 1, n = 100), treatment with low dose amiodarone, 200 mg/day (Group 2, n = 98) or no antiarrhythmic therapy (Group 3 [control group], n = 114). During the 1 year follow-up period, 10 patients in Group 1 died, as did 5 in Group 2 and 15 in Group 3. On the basis of an intention to treat analysis, the probability of survival of patients given amiodarone was significantly greater than that of control patients (p less than 0.05). In addition, arrhythmic events were significantly reduced by amiodarone (p less than 0.01). These effects were less marked and not significant for individually treated patients (Group 1). These findings suggest that low dose amiodarone decreases mortality in the 1st year after myocardial infarction in patients at high risk of sudden death.\r"

Twenty open chest, anesthetized cats were studied with use of a snare ligature around the proximal left anterior descending coronary artery, with a coil sutured to the epicardial surface overlying the distribution of the artery. Peak areas of phosphocreatine, inorganic phosphate and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) NMR signals were measured during 1 h of occlusion followed by 1.5 h of reperfusion. Infarct size and jeopardy area were determined in vitro by simultaneous infusion of phthalocyanine blue dye and triphenyltetrazolium chloride into the aorta and the left anterior descending coronary artery, respectively, after 5 h of myocardial reperfusion. Nicardipine-treated and control groups had similar jeopardy area values (41.2 +/- 1.6% versus 47.4 +/- 3.1% of the left ventricle), but infarct area was significantly reduced in the nicardipine-treated group (3.2 +/- 1.1% versus 24.9 +/- 7.5% of jeopardy area, p less than 0.01). High energy phosphate compounds remained markedly altered during reperfusion in both groups. No significant improvement in phosphocreatine or inorganic phosphate recovery was observed in animals pretreated with nicardipine despite an 87% reduction in infarct size. Myocardial ATP was greater during reperfusion in the nicardipine-treated compared with the control group (average over initial 90 min of reperfusion 58 +/- 6% versus 46 +/- 3% of baseline values, p less than 0.05), suggesting improved recovery of ATP. However, the measured levels of high energy phosphate compounds during reperfusion and their ratios did not correlate with infarct size and thus were not predictive of myocardial salvage.\r"

  ".W": "Despite recent reports describing survival after cardiac rupture, the effectiveness of circulatory support while awaiting definitive surgical treatment is controversial. To assess the efficacy of volume expansion and pharmacologic support in cardiac tamponade due to cardiac rupture, a model of hemorrhagic cardiac tamponade was developed and treatment with rapid saline infusion and dobutamine was compared with rapid saline infusion alone in 15 closed chest dogs. A right ventricular wound of reproducible size was produced by deflating an aortic valvuloplasty balloon that had previously been passed by way of the internal jugular vein into the pericardial space and through a stab wound in the right ventricular free wall. Hemodynamic values were compared at baseline, during tamponade and after a rapid infusion (1 liter at 100 ml/min) of either saline solution alone or saline solution plus dobutamine (20 micrograms/kg per min). Atrial and pericardial pressures increased significantly in both groups. Mean arterial pressure, cardiac output and stroke volume increased with combined saline and dobutamine infusion to values similar to those at baseline (91 +/- 19%, 114 +/- 43% and 94 +/- 37% of baseline, respectively). In contrast, saline infusion alone caused a small increase in cardiac output but failed to significantly increase mean arterial pressure or stroke volume (76.8 +/- 14.2%, 55 +/- 18% and 51 +/- 17% of baseline, respectively). Combined rapid infusion of saline solution and dobutamine infusion has a more beneficial hemodynamic effect and may be more effective than rapid saline infusion alone in resuscitating patients with hemorrhagic cardiac tamponade due to cardiac rupture.\r"

  ".W": "To determine if alterations in regional coronary vascular resistance could occur in the type of myocardial ischemia present in severe angina pectoris, regional perfusion and function were studied in 35 conscious sedated dogs. A stenosis producing severe hypokinesia of the perfused segment was created for 2 h on the left anterior descending coronary artery and 10 episodes of 1 min of high demand ischemia (atrial pacing at a rate sufficient to induce dyskinesia in the hypoperfused segment) were superimposed before reperfusion. The dogs were randomized into three treatment groups: control (n = 13), dipyridamole (n = 10) or WEB-2086 (n = 12), an antagonist of the effects of the endogenous platelet-activating factor. During stenosis, residual endocardial blood flow in the ischemic but nonnecrotic area averaged 0.72 +/- 0.14, 0.38 +/- 0.13 and 0.68 +/- 0.17 ml/min per g in the control, WEB-2086 and dipyridamole groups, respectively. Twenty-four hours after reperfusion, endocardial blood flow in the ischemic area was significantly lower in control dogs (1.04 +/- 0.15 ml/min per g) than in dogs treated with WEB-2086 (1.44 +/- 0.28 ml/min per g; p less than 0.03) or dipyridamole (3.00 +/- 0.83 ml/min per g; p less than 0.01). Accordingly, in control dogs, endocardial coronary vascular resistance in the ischemic area was increased after reperfusion from 85 +/- 11 to 124 +/- 27 mm Hg/(ml/min per g) (p less than 0.05) after 24 h. In contrast, coronary vascular resistance in the ischemic area remained unchanged in dogs receiving WEB-2086 (77 +/- 8 to 79 +/- 9 mm Hg/(ml/min per g); p = NS) and it decreased significantly in dogs receiving dipyridamole (72 +/- 8 to 44 +/- 8 mm Hg/(ml/min per g); p less than 0.01). Regional function after 24 h remained depressed in all three groups. These data indicate that low flow, high demand ischemia induces alterations in the subendocardial microvasculature. Such alterations in regional coronary vascular resistance might play a role in several forms of ischemic heart disease such as in severe angina, but they appear susceptible to improvement by therapeutic interventions that influence granulocyte and platelet activation.\r"

  ".W": "Experiments were performed to characterize the interaction of intravenous dipyridamole and aminophylline on thallium-201 transport kinetics, regional myocardial blood flow and systemic hemodynamics in the presence of a critical coronary artery stenosis. In 12 dogs with a critical left anterior descending coronary artery stenosis, arterial pressure decreased from a mean value (+/- SEM) of 107 +/- 6 to 94 +/- 3 mm Hg (p less than 0.05) and distal left anterior descending artery pressure decreased from 70 +/- 7 to 55 +/- 4 mm Hg (p less than 0.05) after intravenous administration of dipyridamole (0.25 mg/kg body weight). In the left anterior descending perfusion zone, the endocardial/epicardial flow ratio decreased from 0.70 to 0.36 and the intrinsic thallium washout rate was significantly prolonged. Intravenous aminophylline (5 mg/kg) reversed the dipyridamole-induced systemic hypotension and transmural coronary steal and restored the thallium washout rate to baseline values. In six other dogs, aminophylline alone resulted in no alterations in systemic and coronary hemodynamics or regional myocardial blood flow. As expected, dipyridamole-induced vasodilation and coronary steal were prevented by aminophylline pretreatment. These data show that in a canine model of partial coronary stenosis, systemic hypotension, adverse regional flow effects (coronary steal) and prolonged thallium-201 washout consequent to intravenously administered dipyridamole are promptly reversed by intravenous aminophylline administration. Aminophylline alone had no significant hemodynamic and coronary flow effects. This study provides further insight into the altered thallium kinetics occurring as a consequence of dipyridamole-induced vasodilation and suggests that the prompt reversal of symptoms and signs of ischemia with aminophylline in patients receiving intravenous dipyridamole for clinical imaging studies probably reflects the reversal of transmural coronary steal.\r"

  ".U": "91072855\r", 
  ".W": "Phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PNMT) is the rate-limiting enzyme in the synthesis of epinephrine and a specific marker for adrenergic neurons. PNMT protein is decreased in axon terminals in brains from patients with Alzheimer's disease due to retrograde degeneration of epinephrine neurons. To determine the subcellular mechanism underlying retrograde degeneration, the distribution of PNMT between axon terminal and cell body was calculated in early and advanced Alzheimer cases compared with age-matched controls. In early Alzheimer's disease there is a decrease in PNMT in axon terminals and in total PNMT in epinephrine cell bodies and terminals compared with control values. There is no difference in the ratio of PNMT in cell body/axon terminal compared with controls. In contrast, in advanced Alzheimer's disease, PNMT activity increases by 124% in epinephrine neuronal cell bodies compared with controls. Immunochemical titration shows that this increased enzyme activity is due to an increase in PNMT protein. The cell body/axon terminal ratio of PNMT is increased 2.5-fold in advanced Alzheimer's disease compared with controls. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that in early Alzheimer's disease there is a decreased synthesis or increased degradation of PNMT. However, in advanced Alzheimer's disease we propose that the accumulation of this enzyme in the perikarya results from a diminished transport of PNMT to axon terminals. We further postulate that epinephrine, the product of PNMT, and its further metabolites are endogenous neurotoxins. Therefore, the accumulation of PNMT in epinephrine cell bodies may contribute to the degeneration of these neurons in Alzheimer's disease.\r"

This study investigated beta-cell performance and insulin hepatic extraction under dynamic conditions in normal elderly subjects. Two strictly comparable groups of 12 young controls (Y, 27 +/- 1 (SE) years, 73 +/- 3 kg) and 12 elderly men (E, 69 +/- 2 years, 73 +/- 3 kg) were chosen on the basis of normal OGTT and normal insulin sensitivity in order to investigate a \"pure\" age effect. The subjects underwent a 4-hour frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test (FSIGT) (dose 0.3 g/kg). Although no significant differences were found between the fasting levels of glucose and insulin (respectively: E: 89 +/- 3 mg/dL versus Y: 87 +/- 2, P greater than .1; and E: 5.0 +/- 0.5 microU/mL versus Y: 6.8 +/- 1.0, P greater than .05), basal C-peptide was found to be lower in the old subjects: 0.43 +/- 0.06 ng/mL versus 0.70 +/- 0.11 (P less than .025). The patterns of glucose and insulin during the FSIGT were similar, whereas C-peptide concentration in E was systematically lower, suggesting a reduced insulin secretion. To verify this hypothesis, we analyzed FSIGT data with a mathematical model-based method that provides a noninvasive direct measurement of the time courses of insulin secretion and hepatic extraction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Repetitive hospitalizations are a major health problem in elderly patients with chronic disease, accounting for up to one fourth of all inpatient Medicare expenditures. Congestive heart failure, one of the most common indications for hospitalization in the elderly, is also associated with a high incidence of early rehospitalization, but variables identifying patients at increased risk and an analysis of potentially remediable factors contributing to readmission have not previously been reported. We prospectively evaluated 161 patients 70 years or older that had been hospitalized with documented congestive heart failure. Hospital mortality was 13% (n = 21). Among patients discharged alive, 66 (47%) were readmitted within 90 days. Recurrent heart failure was the most common cause for readmission, occurring in 38 patients (57%). Other cardiac disorders accounted for five readmissions (8%), and noncardiac illness led to readmission in 21 cases (32%). Factors predictive of an increased probability of readmission included a prior history of heart failure, four or more admissions within the preceding 8 years, and heart failure precipitated by an acute myocardial infarction or uncontrolled hypertension (all P less than .05). Using subjective criteria, 25 first readmissions (38%) were judged possibly preventable, and 10 (15%) were judged probably preventable. Factors contributing to preventable readmissions included noncompliance with medications (15%) or diet (18%), inadequate discharge planning (15%) or follow-up (20%), failed social support system (21%), and failure to seek medical attention promptly when symptoms recurred (20%). Thus, early rehospitalization in elderly patients with congestive heart failure may be preventable in up to 50% of cases, identification of high risk patients is possible shortly after admission, and further study of nonpharmacologic interventions designed to reduce readmission frequency is justified.\r"

The purpose of this study was to attempt to predict the patients' capacity to regulate their behavior independently. We hypothesized that frontal lobe disorders often impair a patient's ability to function autonomously and that the Behavioral Dyscontrol Scale, a measure of frontal lobe impairment, would best predict the capacity for independent regulation of purposeful behavior. Therefore, we examined the relationship of the Behavioral Dyscontrol Scale with spouses' and caregivers' ratings of patients' independent living skills, and with behaviors that interfere with independent functioning. The results of hierarchial regression analyses indicated that the Behavioral Dyscontrol Scale was the only predictor of functional autonomy and was the best predictor of both impulsivity and apathy among geriatric patients. The Behavioral Dyscontrol Scale appears to assess a different functional domain than do the MMSE and similar measures, which rely heavily on the evaluation of orientation and gross cognitive status.\r"

The correlation between NHLSD scores by two nurses was 0.951; the correlation between scores at two points of time was 0.922. Mean score among the 398 subjects was 27.05. Decreased vision, presence of a neurologic disease, and arthritis were all associated with lower NHLSD score. Mobility (NHLSD) score was moderately correlated with other functional characteristics such as participation in social activities (Spearman's correlation = +0.565). The NHLSD, which represents a simple and reliable assessment of mobility among SNF residents, could be used to assess the effect of interventions and to monitor changes among SNF residents.\r"

One hundred twenty-five directors of 212 responded (59%). In most of the nursing homes, no policies existed for routine tetanus immunization. Medical directors graduating from medical school after 1960 and medical directors with more than 50 nursing home patients were more likely to believe that tetanus immunization is cost-effective in nursing home patients. Only 3% of the respondents always immunize their nursing home patients with chronic skin ulcers. We believe tetanus immunization is an uncommon practice in Maryland nursing homes. Nursing home medical directors should establish policies to promote tetanus immunization.\r"

Baseline risk factors that were independent predictors of a fall at the second interview included two or more stumbles (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 2.3, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.2-4.5), one or more falls (AOR 5.9, 95% CI 2.9-12.2), having spent 4 or more days in bed in the past month (AOR 7.7, 95% CI 1.9-31.0), and self-reported declining health status (AOR 2.0, 95% CI 1.1-3.5).

To study injuries in this population, we developed an active surveillance system as part of a large injury prevention program in a poor urban black community. We report 577 cases of nonfatal and fatal injuries in a community of 12,139 persons 65 years of age and older that resulted in emergency room treatment or death between March 1, 1987, and February 29, 1988. Nearly 5% of the elderly population was treated at an emergency room for, or died as a result of, an injury during the study period; the overall injury rate was 48 injuries per 1,000 persons. Injury rates for older women exceeded those for older men and increased with advancing age in both sexes. Fall injuries accounted for 312 (54%) of all injuries and 75% of all hospitalizations for injury. Motor vehicle incidents and violence were the second and third most common injuries, accounting for 13% and 7% of injuries, respectively. Given the predominance of falls relative to other injuries, prevention of falls should receive major emphasis in injury prevention efforts in inner-city minority populations.\r"

Deaths due to cerebrovascular disease tended to decrease in the recent cohort, but the proportion of decline was more prominent in cases aged 40 to 69 years. There was a sex difference in the changing pattern of mortality from heart diseases including ischemic heart disease. Deaths by both heart diseases and ischemic heart disease increased in the more recent cohort of aged women, whereas they decreased in the aged men. Pneumonia was an important cause of death for the elderly in both cohorts. Deaths due to \"senility\" were rare, being only 1% of the deceased aged 70 or over.

  ".W": "The University of Illinois Hospital (UIH) serves an inner-city urban population in one of the highest crime rate districts in Chicago. On May 20, 1986, the city's Level I Trauma ordinance took effect with the University of Illinois Hospital declining to participate. To measure the impact of the ordinance on a nonparticipating hospital, we undertook a retrospective analysis of our trauma patient utilization statistics. Consecutive monthly patient census data of 71 months was compiled with emphasis on patient presenting complaints and related subspecialty evaluation. We observed significant decreases of patients presenting with head injuries, fractures, and animal bites as well as with major trauma, minor trauma, and general surgery hospital admission. The final disposition of the patients arriving by ambulance was consistent with the observed decrease in major traumatic conditions and in minor traumatic conditions. However, the mean number of patient presentations per day (ppd) admitted to regular medical or surgical beds decreased from 2.70 ppd to 2.30 ppd while the mean number of ppd sent home increased from 2.64 ppd to 3.49 ppd. These data suggest that loss of trauma center status designation has a profound effect on utilization of emergency departments not participating in the trauma system. Nonparticipation appears to be associated with a significant decrease in utilization rates for major and minor trauma patients and a significant increase in the number of patients discharged who had arrived by the Chicago Fire Department Paramedic System (CFD). This effect on the emergency department extends to utilization of inpatient services.\r"

Maternal outcome is dependent on the nature and extent of injury and on the delivery of appropriate care. Fetal outcome relates to the magnitude of direct injury and the maternal physiologic response. It is imperative that all physicians involved in clinical evaluation and management of injured pregnant women understand the changes engendered by pregnancy and their effects upon the mother, the fetus, and the decision-making process. The best way to secure a favorable outcome for both mother and fetus is a standardized planned approach to care provided by a team cognizant of these changes.\r"

In our urban EMS system, paramedics must contact a single base station to provide morphine sulfate (MS) for a patient with chest pain. We performed a retrospective cohort analysis of all prehospital MS requests for chest pain to determine the consistency of the circumstances for which the paramedic team was refused MS. These MS requests represented 123 of the 1,715 (7%) on-line physician consultations during the 6-month study. Only 15 of the 123 (12%) MS requests were refused. Neither the mean patient age, sex distribution, or presenting vital signs correlated with MS refusal. A maximum estimate of transport time to the hospital of less than or equal to 5 minutes was noted for 7 of 15 (47%) medication refusals compared to only 11 of 96 (11%) approvals with documented estimated transport times (P less than or equal to 0.005). A simultaneous request for nitroglycerin (NTG) was noted for 6 of the 15 (40%) medication refusals and 15 of the 108 (14%) approvals (P less than 0.05). We found refusal of MS administration to be uncommon. Supervising physicians tended to refuse MS when the transport time was short and when NTG was requested for concomitant administration. We also noted physician inconsistencies in refusal scenarios. These findings can guide physician consensus development to avoid sending mixed messages to paramedics.\r"

The most serious complications of cyclic antidepressant toxicity are dysrhythmias, hypotension, and seizures. It is predominantly the cardiotoxic effects that cause mortality. Once cardiotoxicity is evident, the treatment of choice is serum alkalinization, preferably by sodium bicarbonate therapy. In order to predict which overdose patients are at high risk for complications, electrocardiographic criteria have been identified as reliable screens. For \"first generation\" tricyclic antidepressants, QRS prolongation (particularly greater than 100 msec) and a terminal 40-ms frontal plane axis greater than 120 degrees are the most sensitive. This article reviews antidepressant pharmacology, electrocardiographic manifestations of antidepressant cardiotoxicity, and approaches to treatment of antidepressant-induced conduction disturbances and dysrhythmias.\r"

  ".W": "The viability of hamster blastocysts, cultured from the eight-cell stage using hamster embryo culture medium-2, was examined by embryo transfer. Approximately 15-20 cultured hamster blastocysts were surgically transferred unilaterally to uterine horns of pseudopregnant recipient hamsters that had been mated to vasectomized males 3 days previously. Control recipients received in vivo developed, freshly recovered eight-cell embryos or blastocysts on day 2 or 3 of pseudopregnancy, respectively. Of the successful embryo transfers, the experimental group (receiving cultured blastocyts; n = 10) gave 51.8% implantations and 28.2% live pups. These values were closely similar to those of the controls; the percentages of control implantations and offspring were 51.1 and 34.0%, respectively, for eight-cell embryo transfer (n = 7, P greater than 0.69) and 48.5 and 28.9% for blastocyst transfer (n = 6, P greater than 0.52). To evaluate the quality of cultured hamster blastocysts, the following two parameters were examined. (1) The mean number of cells per blastocyst was 24.4 +/- 0.7 for cultured blastocysts. This value was similar to that (range, 14-24) obtained in this laboratory for in vivo developed freshly recovered blastocysts. (2) Oxygen consumption analysis revealed that cultured blastocysts actively respired at a level close to that observed with freshly recovered eight-cell embryos (slopes of oxygrams: 0.25 and 0.26, respectively). From these results, it is concluded that hamster blastocysts, cultured from the eight-cell stage, are (a) qualitatively similar to freshly recovered in vivo developed blastocysts and (b) biologically viable as revealed by the production of live offspring upon embryo transfer.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We have developed a data base management system for use on a network of personal computers that takes into account the volume, intricacy, and specialized features of data generated by IVF and GIFT programs. The major products of the system are (1) compact, individual patient reports on virtually all details of each treatment cycle; (2) reports on aggregate data (e.g., monthly, quarterly, or yearly); (3) automated summaries for submission to the American Fertility Society National Registry; and (4) creation of raw data files of user-specified variables that could be used for statistical analysis.\r"

Following this protocol, and simplifying it still, the authors administered 6 mg estradiol valerate (E2) daily orally starting on day 2-6 of induced withdrawal bleeding, augmented with 100 mg progesterone in ethyl oleate (P) intramuscularly daily, starting any time between 4 days prior to and the day of oocyte pickup. All recipients underwent embryo transfer at a 2-pronuclei (2PN)-10-cell stage. A group of 21 patients underwent 26 treatment cycles, resulting in 16 pregnancies. Twelve of the patients gave birth, one to triplets, two to twins, and nine to singletons. Four patients miscarried in the first trimester of pregnancy.\r"

Of 848 patients and 848 spouses tested, all but 4 patients and 1 husband tested negative. Of those who tested positive on repeat testing with ELISA, only one was positive on Western blotting (HIV prevalence, 0.59 per 1000). During this same time period 1187 samples of human cord blood were used to make tissue culture medium for the IVF embryology laboratory. One sample was discarded because of positive HIV on ELISA and Western blotting; two other samples were discarded because of positivity to the hepatitis B surface antigen. While we believe that routine HIV screening of IVF patients and their spouses is indicated, this population is of low risk for HIV positivity. Furthermore, continued screening of human sera used to make tissue culture media for IVF is mandatory.\r"

  ".U": "91073039\r", 
  ".W": "Most IVF-ET units limit the procedure to women below age 38. Nevertheless, demands for infertility treatment, including IVF therapy, are more frequent nowadays. We compared 46 cycles for ovulation induction for IVF in 46 women aged 40 or more (Group I) to 51 induced cycles for this procedure in younger women of mean age 30.2 years (Group II). Cancellation rates due to early luteinization or ovulation were significantly higher in group I than in group II (28.2 and 17.6%, respectively) (P less than 0.001). Also, significantly higher abortion rates were observed in older women (62.5%), in comparison to the younger control group, (25%), (P less than 0.001). It is suggested that the high abortion rate considered to be due to genetic factors in older women, may possibly also be due to the aging uterine environment. Furthermore, while embryos with fragmentations may often produce clinical pregnancies in the young, the aging uterus in the elderly woman does not encourage the development of clinical pregnancies in such embryos. Consequently the higher abortion rate in the elderly woman.\r"

Post-thaw morphology and rates of in vitro fertilization and embryo development were compared with those obtained after freezing oocytes employing two established programmed cooling techniques. The rates of fertilization and development to the blastocyst stage in vitro of oocytes undergoing ultrarapid freezing after exposure to 3.5 M DMSO and 0.5 M sucrose were similar or superior to those obtained with programmed cooling techniques. Of oocytes which appeared morphologically normal post-thaw, only those which underwent ultrarapid freezing with 0.25 or 0.5 M sucrose and 3.5 M DMSO reached the blastocyst stage at rates similar to those of controls. Ultrarapid freezing may represent a viable option for successful murine oocyte cryopreservation.\r"

Group I consisted of elderly women over 40 years, and group II of women below this age. Although visualization revealed uterine abnormalities in 29.9% of all patients, abnormal findings were significantly increased in the former group in comparison to the latter (P less than 0.001). This difference was attributed mainly to uterine rather than cervical pathology. Furthermore, in elderly women age-related uterine pathology such as submucous myomata, endometrial hyperplasia, and polyps were more prominent, while in younger patients other uterine lesions such as adhesions and tubal ostia occlusion were more common. Moreover, treatment prior to IVF-ET resulted in 7 clinical pregnancies (8.9%) in group I and in 41 clinical pregnancies (19.9%) in group II, all of which failed in one to three cycles previously. It seems that hysteroscopic evaluation may reduce the IVF-ET failure rate due to intrauterine abnormalities in elderly as well as young patients, thus it becomes an absolute prerequisite for all patients scheduled for an IVF program.\r"

The volume of cytoplasm injected was critical to bringing about this maturation-promoting activity in mouse oocytes, and 20 pl of cytoplasm seems to be required to overcome the inhibitory effect of cyclic AMP on oocyte maturation. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that the microinjection of cytoplasm from immature mouse oocytes into immature mouse oocytes augmented the inhibitory effect of cyclic AMP on the resumption of meiosis. These results suggest that the appearance and disappearance of maturation-promoting and -inhibiting activities appear to be dependent on the meiotic stages in the mouse oocytes.\r"

The purpose of the present study was to test the direct effects of increasing concentrations of endotoxins on in vitro fertilization and development of mouse embryos to the blastocyst stage. Sexually mature B6D2F1 female mice were superovulated and oocytecumulus complexes were collected from the oviducts and randomized into control and treatment groups. Oocytes (n = 867) were inseminated with capacitated sperm. Treatments included Ham's F-10 supplemented with 3 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and increasing amounts of endotoxin (0.35, 0.64, 0.92, 1.5, 2.08, 3.21, 6.07, and 11.79 ng/ml). Percentage cleavage, percentage fragmentation at the four-cell stage, and percentage expanded blastocyst formation (of cleaved embryos) were evaluated. Statistically significant decreases in cleavage at 6.07 ng/ml (P less than 0.05) and blastocyst formation at 11.79 ng/ml (P less than 0.05) of endotoxin were observed. Fragmentation at the four-cell stage was significantly increased at 3.21 ng/ml (P less than 0.05) of endotoxin. We conclude that the levels of endotoxin necessary to decrease murine preimplantation development significantly is higher than that reported for human embryos.\r"

A marked decrease in very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) cholesterol and triglyceride was observed. There was an increase in high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, particularly the HDL3 component. A slight increase in low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol was observed after 12 weeks, but this had almost disappeared after 24 weeks. The treatment resulted in an increase in serum apolipoprotein A-II levels and a reduction in serum apo C-III and apo E. VLDL subfractionation by density gradient centrifugation in four subfractions of decreasing size (A, B, C and D) showed a predominant reduction of the large subfractions A, B and C, while the decrease in VLDL-D was less marked. Percentage changes from the baseline level of VLDL-A and VLDL-D cholesterol were found to be inversely correlated with percentage changes in HDL and LDL cholesterol, respectively. This might reflect a transfer of cholesterol from VLDL-A to HDL, and from VLDL-D to LDL. The above data suggest fibrate-induced stimulation of lipoprotein lipase, and indicate that the enhanced transfer of cholesterol from VLDL to LDL, induced by fibrates in HTG patients, is less pronounced after a prolonged period of treatment.\r"

  ".W": "The Copenhagen City Heart Study is a prospective cardiovascular population study designed to evaluate the incidence of and risk factors for cardiovascular disease. A random population sample comprising approximately 20,000 individuals was invited to participate. Blood pressure was measured, and information regarding the use of antihypertensive medication was collected in an initial survey during the period 1976-1978 (attendance rate 74%) and from a second survey during the period 1981-1983 (attendance rate 70%). A significant increase in systolic and diastolic blood pressure between survey 1 and survey 2 was found among both men and women greater than 40 years of age and not using antihypertensive medication. The increase in blood pressure in the follow-up survey could not be explained by changes in methods, changes in the prescription of antihypertensive medication, or selection bias. Factors associated with changes in systolic and diastolic blood pressure were examined by multiple linear regression analysis. Both increase in body mass index and increase in alcohol consumption were positively correlated with changes in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, while use of antihypertensive medication, a high value of body mass index at survey 1 and a high level of education were negatively correlated with changes in systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Female sex and advanced age were also negatively correlated with changes in diastolic blood pressure. Consumption of tobacco and alcohol, income and changes in consumption of tobacco were not significantly correlated with changes in systolic and diastolic blood pressure.\r"

In an effort to ameliorate tumour-induced fever we randomized 48 patients to receive three different non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs: Naproxen (500 mg d-1), Indomethacin (75 mg d-1) or Diclophenac sodium (75 mg d-1). All patients had solid tumours, and microbial infection had been excluded. All three drugs were equally effective in bringing the temperature down to normal for a period of 30-33 d. Naproxen had the most rapid effect. In cases of fever relapse with the first drug, when the other two drugs were given instead, both proved equally effective. No side-effects were observed. We conclude that Naproxen, Indomethacin and Diclophenac sodium are equally effective in ameliorating paraneoplastic fever. In relapse, a second drug given subsequently can be effective as well.\r"

Of 275 IDDs who were invited to participate, 52 individuals (18.9%) entered the study. Most indices of glycaemic control showed better values on CSII and also on MI compared to CT, but the differences were small. Fasting blood glucose was higher on MI/human ultralente than on MI/human isophane. Only one subcutaneous abscess and one case of ketoacidosis requiring hospitalization occurred on CSII. Serious hypoglycaemic episodes were non-significantly increased on intensified therapy. Most patients clearly preferred intensified insulin therapy; approximately one half CSII.\r"

The series consisted of a total of 101 patients, including subjects with primary hyperparathyroidism (n = 24), hypoparathyroidism (n = 18), hypercalcaemia of malignancy (n = 10), moderate chronic renal failure (n = 14), chronic renal failure undergoing haemodialysis (n = 19), and small bowel disorders (n = 16). The intact PTH assay was superior to the M/C-PTH assay in reflecting parathyroid function in primary hyperparathyroidism, hypoparathyroidism and hypercalcaemia of malignancy. In patients with chronic renal failure, both assays were indicators of a comparable number of patients with elevated PTH levels. Intact PTH proved most reliable in detecting changes in parathyroid hormone secretion in response to variations in ionized calcium induced by haemodialysis. In patients with extensive intestinal resection, both assays showed increased levels of PTH. It is concluded that measurement of intact PTH is a more reliable index of parathyroid function than measurement of midregion/C-terminal PTH. Thus such an approach should be the one of choice for clinical evaluation of calcium homeostasis.\r"

CAD was diagnosed on the basis of a history indicative of angina pectoris, an electrocardiogram diagnostic of myocardial ischaemia, and a positive coronary angiogram. Thirty-eight per cent of this population had diabetes, hypertension or both. Of the remaining individuals, 39% had a plasma cholesterol concentration greater than 5.2 mmol l-1, whereas 23% had a cholesterol concentration less than 5.2 mmol l-1. Plasma lipid and lipoprotein levels of a non-smoking subset of those subjects with a total cholesterol concentration less than 5.2 mmol l-1 were compared with values of a matched group of individuals who did not have significant vessel disease as revealed by angiography. The results of these investigations indicated that patients with CAD and a plasma cholesterol concentration less than 5.2 mmol l-1 exhibited an increase in plasma triglyceride concentration and a decrease in plasma HDL-cholesterol concentration. Since these subjects were not diabetic, hypertensive or hypercholesterolaemic, it is suggested that the observed changes in triglyceride and HDL metabolism made a major contribution to the CAD in these individuals.\r"

In both the normal milk- and 'mineral-poor' milk-supplemented groups systolic blood pressure decreased slightly. However, this decrease was persistently greater in the milk-supplemented group. The individual mean systolic blood pressure change during normal milk treatment (-4.1%) was significantly greater (P = 0.03) than that during 'mineral-poor' milk treatment (-1.3%). An effect of normal milk supplementation on diastolic blood pressure could not be demonstrated. The results of the present study indicate a small hypotensive effect of milk consumption, which is attributable to its content of essential minerals.\r"

Rogaland, located in south-western Norway, experienced a 24.1% IHD/SUD mortality rate decrease between 1966-1970 and 1981-1985, while Oppland, in central south-eastern Norway, experienced a mortality rate increase of 12.4%. Marked regional differences within these counties were found. The highest IHD/SUD mortality rate increase occurred in rural areas of Oppland. Urban areas of Rogaland had sharply decreasing rates. Knowledge of such regional mortality differences could provide useful information regarding aetiological factors and serve as a basis for preventive measures and health-care planning.\r"

Serum TSH decreased during L-thyroxine administration, with a rebound increase in serum TSH of about 6 months duration during placebo treatment, and a parallel increase in serum thyroglobulin. In agreement with previous observations by other groups, we found decreased serum concentrations of MSA during L-thyroxine treatment in three individuals. In addition, a slow but significant transient increase in serum MSA was recorded during placebo administration in the four individuals who showed the most pronounced increase in serum TSH (greater than 20 mU l-1). This association between serum levels of MSA and TSH is most probably related to antigen presentation at the surface of the thyrocyte. We conclude that changes in serum TSH concentration should be taken into account in the interpretation of MSA in patients with thyroid disease, whether untreated or treated with L-thyroxine.\r"

Plasma renin activity (PRA) increased slightly, although this rise was not statistically significant, 1 h after the first dose of nisoldipine in both normotensive subjects and hypertensive patients. After 2 h PRA had returned to the pre-treatment level. No change in PRA was observed after administration of placebo. Plasma angiotensin II (AII) levels showed considerable variation after nisoldipine administration. Plasma aldosterone levels decreased despite the increase in PRA and AII concentrations. However, no concomitant reduction in urinary aldosterone excretion was observed. Plasma noradrenaline levels increased slightly 2-4 h after administration of nisoldipine, and decreased again thereafter, but no changes in plasma adrenaline levels were seen.

The patients were randomized to an intensified conventional treatment (ICT, n = 44) or a regular treatment (RT, n = 53) group. HbA1c (normal range 3.9-5.7%) was reduced from 9.5 +/- 0.2 (mean value +/- SEM) to 7.4 +/- 0.1% in the ICT group (P = 0.0001), and from 9.5 +/- 0.2 to 9.0 +/- 0.2% in the RT group (P = 0.004). Nerve conduction velocities in the sural and peroneal nerves (P = 0.01-0.0001) were impaired in the RT group, but not in the ICT group. Retinopathy increased in both groups. The condition of 22 ICT patients (50%, 95% confidence interval 34-66%) and 37 RT patients (73%, 61-84%) deteriorated with regard to at least one microvascular complication (retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy) (P = 0.024). Lower HbA1c levels during the study significantly reduced the risk of deterioration (P = 0.01). In total, 57% of the ICT patients had at least one episode of serious hypoglycaemia, compared with 23% in the RT group (P = 0.001). The patients in the ICT group also gained weight (P = 0.0001). Improved blood glucose control slowed down the progression of microangiopathy during a 3-year period in patients with non-proliferative retinopathy, but at the price of an increased frequency of serious hypoglycaemic episodes, and some gain in body weight.\r"

Of the three major components of delay, decision time (time from onset of symptoms to decision to go to hospital), and hospital procedure time (time from arrival in hospital to arrival in the CCU), were of the same magnitude, 1 h 15 min and 1 h 30 min (median), whereas the median time for preparation and transportation to hospital was somewhat shorter, being 45 min. Decision time appeared to be similar in patients with confirmed and non-confirmed acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and was not associated with intensity of pain or infarct size. Half of the patients hesitated to go to hospital, which resulted in a prolonged decision delay (3 h). It is concluded that patient indecision to seek medical help is the most important reason for delay in hospital arrival in patients with suspected AMI.\r"

The patient, an insulin-dependent diabetic, presented with hypokalaemia, inappropriate kaliuresis and metabolic alkalosis. He had high plasma renin activity, relatively low plasma aldosterone, and resistance to infused angiotensin II. A high potassium diet raised total body potassium and serum potassium, did not affect plasma renin activity, but raised plasma aldosterone significantly and did not alter the resistance to angiotensin II. Indomethacin administered acutely reduced urinary potassium and kallikrein excretion and, on chronic administration, lowered plasma renin activity, urinary chloride excretion, and raised serum potassium. Salt restriction resulted in a prompt and significant reduction in urinary sodium and chloride excretion. Urinary kallikrein excretion was very high throughout, increased with sodium restriction, and decreased with sodium loading. Oral potassium supplementation partially corrected the hypokalaemia, but did not affect blood sugar control. In this patient the primary defect appears to have been primary urinary potassium wasting, rather than sodium or chloride wasting. The striking effects of indomethacin suggest that prostaglandins may play a fundamental role in the genesis of the syndrome.\r"

The boundaries between impressive and unimpressive distinctions were best formed by a ratio of greater than or equal to 1.2 for the smaller to the larger mean in 546 comparisons, by a standardized increment of greater than or equal to 0.28 and odds ratio of greater than or equal to 2.2 in 392 comparisons of two rates; and by an r value of greater than or equal to 0.32 in 154 correlation coefficients. Additional boundaries were also identified for \"substantially\" and \"highly\" significant quantitative distinctions. Although the proposed boundaries should be kept flexible, indexes and boundaries for decisions about \"quantitative significance\" are particularly useful when a value of delta must be chosen for calculating sample size before the research is done, and when the \"statistical significance\" of completed research is appraised for its quantitative as well as stochastic components.\r"

  ".W": "Consistency between death certificates and clinical records from 5 general hospitals in Kuwait was studied for 470 deaths with the following underlying or associated causes: hypertensive (HYP), ischaemic heart diseases (IHD), cerebrovascular diseases (CVD) and diabetes mellitus (DM). Direct causes were not considered since they are of little interest analytically. Only deaths with definite or most probable ascertainment were included. One cardiologist, who was provided with the WHO criteria and relevant documents on death certification, independently reviewed the records. To test the reviewer's bias and the reliability of his judgement, an adjudication process was effected by having one senior cardiologist re-review a random subsample of 140 records. The two reviewers showed good agreement. Specific diagnoses criteria for deciding the underlying cause of death in multiple morbid conditions by the reviewer were followed. Due to possible reviewer bias, we aimed at measuring the difference between initial certifiers and the reviewer rather than measuring the diagnostic accuracy of initial certifiers in reference to the reviewer. The agreement index kappa showed poor agreement between original and revised certificates. The original certificates under-estimated CVD as an underlying cause of death by 69.2%, DM by 60%, IHD by 33.5% and HYP by 31.8% in our sample. Associated causes were also consistently under-estimated by initial certifiers as compared with the reviewer. This bias calls for basing mortality statistics in Kuwait on hospital death committees' reports rather than on initial certifier death certificates, use of multiple-causes of death instead of one underlying cause and adequate training of the medical profession on the value and process of death certification.\r"

Positive associations of serum uric acid with body weight, body mass index, body fatness (men) and lean body mass (men) were observed, with and without adjustment for diuretic therapy, creatinine clearance and age. Serum uric acid levels, whether adjusted or not for these variables and for body mass index, were positively associated with alcohol intake (men) and consumption of meat and fish (women), and inversely with consumption of bread, margarine and milk products (women). These results indicate that limited medication with diuretics, weight control and restriction of alcohol use may help to prevent hyperuricemia in the elderly.\r"

Seventy-seven percent of respondents breast-fed their infants at 1 month of life compared to 19% at 12 months of life. Analysis of breast-feeding behavior using survival analysis showed that 50% of the mothers who breast-fed since the first month of their infant's life were still breast-feeding at 7 months of life. Also, there was a greater than two-fold increase in the rate of discontinuation of breast-feeding for infants in daycare compared to infants not attending daycare (RR = 2.08, 95% CI = 1.43, 3.01). Discontinuation of breast-feeding was not significantly associated with the number of children in the family or with social class. These results give insight into infant feeding patterns in a developed country and suggest that: (1) breast-feeding is the dominant method of feeding during the infant's first year of life, and (2) the rate of discontinuation of breast-feeding is increased by the entry of these infants into daycare.\r"

Several variables may be omitted from clinical trials, especially if two active drugs are being compared. For example, the best maximum estimate for the difference in ESR between NSAIDs and placebo was 1.0 mm/hr (95% confidence interval -1.5 to 3.4 mm/hr), and for joint size 0.44% (-1.0 to 1.9%), corresponding to a quarter of a millimeter for each of the 10 joints usually measured.

  ".W": "Our previous analyses of decision strategies in children 3-24 months with acute-onset fever greater than or equal to 39 degrees C and no evident bacterial focus of infection indicated that the risks of routine blood cultures (the unnecessary hospitalization and treatment of children who clear their bacteremia spontaneously) outweigh its benefits (the prevention of a few cases with major infectious sequelae). Because those analyses were based on parents' values for beneficial and adverse clinical outcomes, we wished to examine whether those values differed in physicians and, if so, whether the differences were sufficient to change the results of the decision analysis. Using a pre-tested linear analog utility (value) scale, we evaluated eight potential clinical outcomes in potentially bacteremic children by surveying 121 parents of healthy 3-24-month-old children attending a private pediatric group practice and 57 attending physicians of a tertiary-care children's hospital emergency room. Utilities were based on a 0-1 normalization, where 0 is the utility of the worst outcome (meningitis or other major bacterial infection, plus venipuncture), and 1 the utility of the best outcome (complete recovery without venipuncture or hospitalization), and were analyzed using a recently developed statistical model of utility. The majority of parents and physicians combined the imputed components of the outcomes (disease, pain of venipuncture, and stress of hospitalization) in a nonlinear fashion. Parents assigned substantially lower utility (i.e. greater disutility) to venipuncture, minor infection, and hospitalization than did physicians, and these utilities were even lower in parents with other children at home.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The questionnaire produced group mean nutrient estimates closely approximating the values obtained by three 4-day records, e.g. in the usual-diet group, 37.7% of calories from fat by both food records and by questionnaire, and in the low-fat group, 21.3% of calories from fat by food records and 23.7% of calories from fat by questionnaire. Correlations between questionnaire and diet records for per cent of calories from fat were 0.67 and 0.65 respectively in the two groups; most correlations were in the 0.5-0.6 range, and were similar to those achievable by a single 4-day food record.\r"

Because low gastric acid output (GAO) is an established risk factor for cholera, we assessed after validation, whether a new non-invasive test which estimates GAO by measuring breath hydrogen excess after ingestion of magnesium and a stimulant of gastric acid secretion, could discriminate between persons at high and at low risk of developing cholera. Fifteen age-matched pairs, participants in the field trial of two oral cholera vaccines in rural Bangladesh, were tested. In each pair the \"case\" was a person who had recovered from severe cholera at least 6 months before testing and the \"control\" was a person who resided in the home of a cholera patient but remained uninfected. The stimulated breath hydrogen was higher in controls (median hydrogen excess = 369 mumol/80 min) than in cases (median hydrogen excess = 150 mumol/80 min) (p less than 0.05) and was higher in controls in 12 out of 15 pairs. The results, which are consistent with past invasive assessments of the association between hypochlorhydria and cholera, suggest that this non-invasive test may be useful in evaluating GAO in epidemiological field studies.\r"

We have investigated the relationship in three population-based samples of Micronesian (Nauru), Polynesian (Western Samoa) and Melanesian (New Caledonia) Pacific islanders, who are known to be susceptible to obesity, non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), hyperinsulinaemia and hypertension. After controlling for age and body mass index (BMI), mean fasting and 2-hr (post 75 g glucose) insulin levels were not significantly different between hypertensive and non-hypertensive subjects, in any population or glucose tolerance sub-group, excepting 2-hr insulin in New Caledonians with normal glucose tolerance. Similarly, there were no strong trends for a higher prevalence of hypertension amongst those with insulin levels in the upper quartile of the distribution of each population, although it was apparent in some BMI/glucose tolerance sub-groups of two populations. Multiple linear regression analyses also showed an inconsistent and where present, weak, independent association between insulin and blood pressure in models predicting both systolic and diastolic blood pressure. We therefore conclude that the hypothesis implicating insulin as a major determinant of blood pressure and as the pathophysiological link between obesity, NIDDM and hypertension is not strongly supported either by the literature or the present data.\r"

We used data from the previously reported Tri-state study to estimate simultaneously the effects of tampon oxygen content, absorbency and chemical composition. Although the data are sparse, oxygen content was more strongly associated with risk of toxic shock syndrome than either absorbency or chemical composition. The results suggest that it may be possible to develop a highly absorbent tampon that is not associated with a high risk of toxic shock syndrome.\r"

A cohort design in which Medicaid enrollees receiving drugs that are normally used to treat similar underlying conditions is described. A period of time in which Medicaid service transactions are evident is required before an individual is eligible for selection into a cohort. Selection of study subjects and descriptions of cohorts are based on Medicaid service histories occurring during the preliminary, prerequisite period. Time at risk is considered to begin after a prescription for a study drug is dispensed and continues until either a refill is dispensed, a prescription for an alternative drug within the same therapeutic class is dispensed, or a predetermined number of days has passed. Subjects are followed forward in time and relevant health care transactions that are suggestive of suspected adverse drug reactions are noted. Incidence densities associated with sequentially ranked prescriptions within sequential courses of therapy are compared. Methods to increase the accuracy of case ascertainment are briefly discussed. Separate validation studies may be used to evaluate the validity of computerized case ascertainment methods and to compensate for misclassification of outcome. The proposed method is intended to provide timely estimates of risk for selected outcomes. For outcomes that cannot be accurately ascertained from computerized data, this method may be useful in determining the feasibility of more customized studies.\r"

Predictors of relapse (ex-smokers at NHANES I who were smoking again at time of followup) were: (1) younger age; (2) urban residence; and (3) female gender.

Mean systolic (JM and WM, p less than 0.001) and diastolic blood pressure (JM, p less than 0.002; WM, p less than 0.001) were associated with alcohol consumption in both groups. Compared to abstainers, the heaviest drinkers had the highest systolic (JM, p = 0.001; WM, p less than 0.01) and diastolic (JM, p less than 0.002; WM, p less than 0.05) blood pressures. The relation of blood pressure to alcohol intake was J-shaped in the Americans, but linear in the Japanese. Exploratory analyses revealed that the J-shape may have been due to under-reporting of heavy alcohol ingestion by American abstainers. When abstainers were excluded, the relationships were similar in both the American and Japanese. The positive association between blood pressure and alcohol consumption persisted after adjustment for age, cigarette smoking, use of antihypertensive medications, body mass index, heart rate, abdominal skinfold thickness, hematocrit, fasting blood glucose, serum uric acid levels and urinary sodium/potassium ratio. Alcohol use was also related to prevalence of hypertension. These findings confirm the presence of an independent association between alcohol intake and blood pressure in both JM and WM and suggest that, despite differences in the metabolism of alcohol, the relation of alcohol consumption to blood pressure is similar in both nationalities.\r"

A greater proportion of women (32.7%) than men (23.0%) experienced at least one fall in which there was no or minimal external contribution. Using unconditional logistic regression models we investigated the effect of physical and sociological variables on the sex difference in fall rate. Controlling for the variables age, use of psychotropic drugs, inability to rise from a chair without using arms, going outdoors less than daily and living alone decreased the relative risk of women falling compared to men from 2.02 (95% CI, 1.40-2.92) to 1.55 (95% CI 1.04-2.31). Some of the increased risk of falling associated with being a women was able to be explained and is potentially correctable. But even after controlling for the physical and social variables which we had assessed, women compared to men still had a significantly increased relative risk of falling.\r"

Crude prevalences of keratoses in the 4 groups were 67, 54, 42 and 23%, respectively. Logistic regression models showed that bladder cancer patients had a raised risk of having palmar keratoses relative to hospital controls (odds ratio = 6.95; 95% CI: 4.77-10.12) whereas blood-relatives and spouses had significantly increased odds ratios only if the case in their family (or some other blood-relative) possessed keratoses. Among several environmental and behaviour factors, only cigarette smoking was significantly associated with increased risk (odds ratio = 2.32; 95% CI: 1.63-3.29). The data suggest a genetic component may influence the occurrence of palmar keratoses, but some unknown environmental agent appears to be causing the association between spouses.\r"

We compare characteristics of responders and non-responders to a mail survey of health outcomes among participants of a longitudinal study of physical activity, physical fitness, and health. Results indicate that, at the first clinic visit, the responders were essentially the same as the non-responders on personal health history and laboratory measurements, while reporting significantly more family history of specific chronic diseases (cardiovascular disease, hypertension, stroke). The male responders were younger and reported more positive health behaviors as well as better weight and treadmill times at the first clinic visit. These results suggest that both response groups were equally healthy at entry, and that individuals who had family members with certain chronic conditions and who had positive health behaviors were more likely to respond (participate) in this health-related survey. Differences of this type could affect interpretation of future analyses. This work illustrates the importance of incorporating methods to examine non-response into any epidemiologic study.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the safety, maximum tolerated dose, and preliminary efficacy of concomitant interferon-alpha and zidovudine therapy in AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma (KS), 56 patients with biopsy-proven KS and documented human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV) infection were enrolled into a phase I study. Interferon-alpha was given intramuscularly at a dose of 9, 18, or 27 mu once a day and zidovudine was administered as 100 or 200 mg every 4 h for 8 weeks followed by a 48-week maintenance period. The major toxicities were anemia, neutropenia, and hepatotoxicity. Neutropenia was dose limiting with 1,200 mg of zidovudine/day and the lowest dose of interferon-alpha (9 mu/day). Hepatotoxicity was dose limiting with 27 mu of interferon and 600 mg of zidovudine/day. Cumulative dose-related anemia or neutropenia was not seen during long-term follow-up. The maximum tolerated doses for the combination were defined as 18 mu daily for interferon-alpha and 600 mg daily for zidovudine. Variable changes in CD4 lymphocytes occurred during the first 8 weeks of therapy. At higher doses of the combination, sustained increases in median CD4 lymphocyte numbers were noted (p less than 0.001). In HIV antigenemic patients, progressive antigen suppression was seen with increasing doses of the combination (p less than 0.005). The overall antitumor response rate was 47%. Tumor regression was associated with better survival benefits (p less than 0.001) and a pretreatment CD4 cell count greater than or equal to 200 cells/mm3 (p = 0.01). In conclusion, intermediate doses of interferon-alpha and lower doses of zidovudine appear to be relatively well tolerated and associated with disease improvement, including survival benefits.\r"

We report that as CD4+ T cells decrease, the number of CD4+ monocytes decrease in parallel. Moreover, significantly higher CD4+ monocyte counts were observed in persons with early stage HIV disease, i.e., greater than 800 CD4+ T cells/mm3, than in HIV-negative persons with greater than 800 CD4+ T cells/mm3.

To study the requirements for membrane anchorage, conservative amino acid substitutions in three residues at a time were made within this hydrophobic gp41 region. The complete gp160 precursor as well as the gp120 exterior envelope glycoprotein were exported into the supernatant of expressing cells for two mutants with amino acid substitutions in residues 687-689 and 697-699. The soluble gp160 molecules exhibited a binding ability for CD4 on the surface of SupT1 cells that was 33-36% that of the soluble gp120 glycoproteins. These results implicate residues 687-689 and 697-699 as important components of the stop-transfer signal that anchors the gp160 envelope glycoprotein precursor in the membrane. The data also suggest that characteristics in addition to hydrophobicity are required for stop-transfer signals.\r"

  ".W": "An early host defense against infection by RNA or DNA viruses is the induction, within infected cells, of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) gene transcription. The protein product of the TNF-alpha gene alone, or together with different types of interferons, inhibits viral propagation in diverse cell types. In this study, the effect of acute and chronic human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection on the transcription of the TNF-alpha and interferon-beta (IFN-beta) genes was examined in susceptible monocyte and T-cell lines as well as in primary human mononuclear phagocytes. Although Sendai virus, a prototypic inducer of TNF-alpha and IFN-beta mRNA, induced the transcription of both genes in the monocyte cell lines and TNF-alpha in the T-cell line and in primary mononuclear phagocytes, transcription of these genes was not inducible by HIV-1. Therefore, HIV-1 was able to infect these cells without triggering the transcription of genes encoding proteins important in immediate antiviral cellular defenses. These results may explain in part how HIV-1 is able to establish persistent intracellular infections and escape acute host responses that have evolved to combat viral infection.\r"

  ".U": "91073290\r", 
  ".W": "Inhibitors of glycoprotein processing, such as castanospermine (1,6,7,8-tetrahydroxyoctahydroindolizine), have been shown previously to inhibit human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) with acceptable toxicity in cultured human cells. In prior experiments, we have tested the toxicity and antiviral efficacy of castanospermine in mice infected with the Rauscher murine leukemia virus (RLV). When compared with 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine (AZT, zidovudine), castanospermine was less effective and more toxic. Since the 6-O-butanoyl analog of castanospermine was previously found to have a more favorable activity profile than the parent compound against HIV-1 in cultured cells, we compared the antiviral efficacy of both compounds in parallel in vitro and in vivo in the RLV system. Plaque formation in the XC assay was inhibited with a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 2.4 microM for the 6-O-butanoyl analog of castanospermine, as compared to 9 microM for castanospermine. For both compounds, concentrations resulting in significant cytotoxicity were about ten times higher. Both compounds significantly decreased HIV-1 env-induced syncytium formation in a novel in vitro assay. In RLV-exposed mice, the 6-O-butanoyl analog showed no advantage over the parent compound: both curves for toxicity as well as antiviral efficacy were super-imposable. We conclude that the 6-O-butanoyl analog of castanospermine as well as castanospermine itself are active antiviral agents in mice and that prolonged oral administration is tolerable. However, in comparison to AZT, their antiviral activity profiles are less favorable.\r"

  ".W": "Physical contact between latent HIV-infected monocytes and epithelial cells appears to trigger rapid assembly and release of HIV into the enclosed space between donor and acceptor cells. During this process, monocytes form microvilli that intimately associate with epithelial membrane. HIVs sequestered in these sites are then internalized in the epithelial cells within phagocytic endosomes. Morphological evidence suggests that parts of virions fuse with the endosomal membrane and escape into the cytoplasm of the epithelium before endosome-lysosome fusion. In addition, virions in the lysosomal compartment are not necessarily degraded and may cause dissolution of phagolysosome membrane before HIV is damaged. This is reflected in the observation of free coated virions in the epithelial cytoplasm. Apart from the phagocytic mode of HIV entry, two other less common routes of HIV penetration were observed. One resembles direct HIV fusion with host membrane, which is similar to the entry mode of virus into CD4 lymphocytes. The second mode of entry resembles receptor-mediated endocytosis characterized by small pits and endosomes. Cell contact-mediated viral shedding and the diversity of HIV entry mechanisms are described for an in vitro model.\r"

The plasma clearance, steady-state volume of distribution, and terminal half-life of ZDV were found not to be significantly affected by pregnancy. Based on these findings, we predict that the pharmacokinetics of ZDV in women will not be affected by pregnancy. If this prediction is found to be correct, the dose of ZDV need not be adjusted when the drug is administered to pregnant women.\r"

We find weak, but not statistically significant, evidence that the incubation period is lengthening. When the incubation period distribution is assumed not to have changed, we estimate that the proportion developing AIDS within 6 years of HIV infection is 27%, with a 95% confidence interval of (23%, 31%). However, if we assume that the incubation period distribution began to change in July 1987, then we estimate that for individuals infected in the first half of 1979, 28% develop AIDS within 6 years, and for those infected in the first half of 1983, 25% develop AIDS in 6 years. Four different hypotheses are suggested for a lengthening of the incubation period; these are a treatment hypothesis, a cofactor hypothesis, a better health care hypothesis, and a changing virus and disease hypothesis. The statistical method used is semiparametric modeling of the joint distribution of the date of infection and the incubation period for the participants in the study. These methods, although computationally intensive, are an attractive way of analyzing data from a prevalent cohort because only minimal parametric assumptions are made.\r"

Among subjects who were initially seronegative, smokers were more likely than nonsmokers to become HIV-1 seropositive (p = 0.03). After seroconversion, serum beta 2-microglobulin and CD4+ lymphocyte levels were elevated in cigarette smokers relative to nonsmokers (p = 0.02 for both comparisons), but both of these differences disappeared within 2 years. There was no detectable difference in the risk of AIDS or Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia with respect to smoking. Our data suggest that cigarette smoking may alter the immune response to HIV-1 infection, but it appears to have no marked effect on clinical outcome. They also suggest that cigarette smoking may be a surrogate marker for continued high-risk sexual behavior in homosexual men.\r"

To examine the epidemiology of AIDS in persons greater than or equal to 50 years old in the United States, we analyzed cases reported to the Centers for Disease Control. The number reported annually in persons greater than or equal to 50 years old increased from 13 in 1981 to 3,562 in 1989. Through December 1989, 11,984 had been reported, representing 10% of all cases. Although male homosexual contact accounted for most cases in persons aged 50-69, blood transfusion became a more common means of exposure with increasing age, accounting for 28% of cases in persons aged 60-69 and 64% of cases in individuals aged greater than or equal to 70. The proportion of women increased from 6.1% in persons with AIDS aged 50-59 to 28.7% of those aged greater than or equal to 70. The proportion of AIDS diagnoses made in the same month as death increased from 16% in persons aged 50-59 to 37% in those aged greater than or equal to 80, suggesting either more rapid progression of disease or increasing delay in diagnosis. As the incidence in older persons continues to increase, clinicians caring for older patients must become more familiar with AIDS.\r"

Specificity was supported by serologic retesting and virus culture of 11 donors located for follow-up. Sex- and age-specific prevalences did not differ significantly; blacks, however, accounted for 65% of seropositive donations. Within South Florida, one section of Miami had a prevalence of 4.5 per 1,000 donations, significantly above the 0.1 to 1.1 per 1,000 rates for other parts. An epidemiologic association with known HTLV-I endemic areas could account for most infections; all seven typed isolates were characterized as HTLV-I. Exposures, however, were diverse, sometimes multiple, and had no necessary relationship to personal lifestyle. This finding suggests that sources of infection were varied. Seropositive family members emphasize familial clustering of HTLV-I infection.\r"

In the patients with disease of recent onset women were slightly more numerous (56%) than men; however, in those with disease duration of 36 months there were significantly more women (72%) (p less than 0.039), suggesting a greater tendency to chronic disease in this sex. Radiological lesions of the small joints of the hands, feet, and/or wrists were found in 37% of the cases with disease duration of up to 4 months and in 91% at 36 months (p less than 0.0001). The lesions were associated significantly more frequently with Ritchie index (p less than 0.02) and with laboratory indices of inflammatory activity (erythrocyte sedimentation rate greater than or equal to 25 mm/h) (p less than 0.001) and immune response (latex test greater than or equal to 80) (p less than 0.0001).

The groups matched in most respects but the gold group had a smaller proportion of women, a shorter median disease duration and a higher median CRP than the remaining 2 groups. The penicillamine group contained a higher proportion of seropositive patients. In each group there were significant improvements in clinical score, CRP and ESR for all time points from 6 to 30 months; these improvements were maintained for longer (up to 60 months for SAS) in the SAS and gold groups but the differences between the drugs after 30 months were probably a consequence of falling number of patients, not differing drug potencies. The mean ESR and CRP levels fell to about 30 mm/h and 20-30 mg/l, respectively. Response was defined as (1) treatment duration greater than 6 months, (2) clinical score improvement greater than 4 by 6 months, (3) ESR fall to less than 30 mm/h by 6 months.

There was no significant difference between the percentage of CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes in synovial membrane compared to RA and normal PB. Double labelling experiments revealed similar percentages of CD4+ CDw29+ (helper-inducer) and CD4+ CD45R+ (suppressor-inducer) cells in RA and normal PB. In contrast, SM CD4+ CDw29+ cells were present in significantly higher proportions than in RA and normal PB (p less than 0.001). Conversely, synovial membrane CD4+ CD45R+ cells were present in significantly lower proportions than in RA and normal PB (p less than 0.001). A similar pattern of CDw29 and CD45R antigen expression was noted on CD8+ lymphocytes reflecting increased killer-effector (p less than 0.001) and decreased suppressor-effector (p less than 0.001) cells, respectively. Other experiments revealed a significant increase in the percentage of synovial membrane CD20+ cells (B lymphocytes) and HLA-DR+ cells compared to RA PB (p less than 0.02 and p less than 0.001) and normal PB (p less than 0.01 and p less than 0.005), and similar proportions of CD14+ cells (monocytes/macrophages). Our results suggest that RA synovial membrane contains populations of T and B lymphocytes that differ quantitatively and qualitatively from those in PB. These may account for some of the abnormalities in intraarticular humoral and cellular immune responses in patients with RA.\r"

In agreement with others, we believe that the only specific CT lesions of RA are erosions and cysts of the mandibular condyle, that there is no correlation between clinical and CT findings of TMJ in RA, and that the intensity of destructive lesions of TMJ on CT in RA is well correlated with the severity of the disease.\r"

Ionomycine (IM, calcium ionophore) which selectively upregulated p70/75 expression, induced less p70/75 in patients with SLE than in healthy controls. However, intracellular calcium levels of T cells from patients with SLE increased as much as those from healthy controls, when T cells were stimulated by IM or PHA. Our results suggest that an impaired expression of p70/75 IL-2R in T cells from patients with SLE is not due to a defective calcium influx but to the events after the rise of calcium levels.\r"

Direct age adjusted incidence rates were computed for race and sex, as new cases/million population/year, with the 1970 Allegheny County population as the standard. One hundred seventy-seven cases were identified during this 20-year survey for a total annual incidence of 5.5/million population. Incidence more than tripled during 1973-1982 compared to the first decade of study, with the greatest increase occurring in black women. Overall, the female to male incidence ratio was 2.2:1, but during the childbearing years (ages 15-44) this ratio increased to greater than 5:1 in both races. Detection of PM-DM is increasing, as shown by temporal trends. Although our series has significantly more adult PM and less DM and overlap cases than other published studies, annual incidence is similar to that reported in other locales.\r"

The mean initial prednisolone dose was in patients with PMR 18 mg/day and the mean duration of treatment was 17 months. In patients with TA the mean initial dose was 31 mg/day and the mean duration of treatment 16 months, and in all the corticosteroid treatment was terminated within 24 months. Patients with coexisting TA and PMR demanded longer treatment compared to patients with either TA or PMR and thus 18/91 patients were treated for more than 2 years. No visual or neurological complications occurred after treatment with corticosteroids had been initiated. Our study indicates that most patients with PMR or TA can be treated safely with an initial prednisolone dose of 10 mg given twice daily. With few exceptions corticosteroid treatment can be terminated within 24 months.\r"

All 3 agents caused a concentration dependent inhibition of MSUM induced hemolysis that was not due to a decrease in MSUM binding to the pretreated membranes.

In search for the sources of this PLA2, we cultured human articular chondrocytes and cartilage explants from healthy, osteoarthritic and rheumatoid joints. All cultures, unstimulated by cytokines, released PLA2 extracellularly. Cultures obtained from the deep layers of the cartilage released more PLA2 than those obtained from the superficial layers. Deep layer explants released 0.38 to 18.16 pmol/min/mg protein PLA2/day, whereas superficial layer explants released 0.39-3.18 pmol/min/mg/day. Chondrocyte cell cultures continuously released PLA2, in the first day 909-46347 pmol/min/(10)6 cells and after 9-26 days of culture 166-2115 pmol/min/10(6) cells. PLA2 released from chondrocytes was calcium dependent and had optimum activity at pH 7.5. Cycloheximide markedly inhibited its release. Chondrocyte cultures also released muramidase (LZM) but there was no correlation between PLA2 and LZM release. It may be concluded that cytokine unstimulated human articular chondrocytes synthesize and release PLA2 extracellularly which is similar to that found in the SF. Thus, chondrocytes may possibly serve as one of the sources of intraarticular PLA2.\r"

Pretreatment of chondrocytes with actinomycin D or cycloheximide significantly inhibited IL-1 induced PLA2 activation and secretion, suggesting that the enzyme induction process is RNA and protein synthesis dependent. Chondrocyte PLA2 is highly calcium dependent with a 1 mM optimum CA++ concentration for hydrolytic activity; little or no hydrolysis is observed in the absence of calcium and the hydrolytic activity is abolished in the presence of 10 mM ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid. The enzyme is also pH sensitive with optimal PLA2 hydrolytic activity observed at pH 6.5-7. Further, chondrocyte PLA2 was sensitive to inhibition by mepacrine, a compound with PLA2 inhibitory activity. The IL-1 induced chondrocyte PLA2 has a molecular weight of approximately 10 kDa, as determined by molecular sieve G75 column chromatography. The apparent molecular weight and CA++, pH and drug sensitivity of the extracellular and intracellular forms of the IL-1 induced chondrocyte PLA2 are indistinguishable. Since this IL-1 induced enzyme has similar biochemical characteristics to PLA2 enzymes isolated from human rheumatoid and osteoarthritic synovial fluid, we suggest that the chondrocyte may be an important cellular source for this PLA2 enzymatic activity in inflamed joints.\r"

Because a large body of evidence supports the concept that Gram-negative bacterial lipopolysaccharide (endotoxin, LPS) is responsible for many of the direct and host mediator-induced deleterious effects, recent work has been centered on the development and use of anti-LPS antibody preparations in order to ameliorate lethality. Both polyclonal and monoclonal antibody preparations directed against the common deep core/lipid A region of LPS are cross-reactive in vitro and cross-protective in vivo against a wide range of challenge organisms and LPS, and preliminary clinical trials indicate that a reduction in lethality may be possible. The precise endotoxin epitope against which antibody should be directed in order to maximize protection, however, has not been established. This modality most probably will become a standard form of adjunctive therapy within the next several years for the treatment of Gram-negative bacterial sepsis.\r"

Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), a chemotactic factor, increases synthesis of extracellular matrix and stimulates granulation tissue. We demonstrated that a single topical dose of TGF-beta increased the wound breaking strength in normal models of tissue repair as well as in models of impaired wound repair, characterized by severe monocytopenia. PDGF, a chemotactic agent for inflammatory cells, with mitogenic activity, activates monocytes and stimulates collagen production, significantly increased the wound breaking strength with effects that lasted for up to 47 days. In contrast to TGF-beta, PDGF was only active in normal models of wound healing and its effects were dependent upon the presence of macrophages. PAF is a glycerophospholipid which chemotaxes and activates macrophages, but differs from growth factors in lacking mitogenic activity. A single topical dose of PAF significantly increased the wound breaking strength and promoted macrophage migration.\r"

Basic FGF (50-1,000 ng) was incorporated into 10% Hydron, and 50-500 ng of bFGF were incorporated into 10% Elvax. Human serum albumin (HSA) (10 ng) and 50 ng of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) served as negative and positive controls. Pellets of the polymers containing test compounds were implanted in the rabbit cornea, examined daily, and after 7 days corneal angiogenesis was scored on a graded scale [(-) for no response and +4 for a maximum response]. Histologic analysis of the corneas was performed on days 2 and 7. Basic FGF (50-500 ng) in Hydron failed to stimulate significant angiogenesis, though it did induce angiogenesis accompanied by inflammation at the 1,000-ng dose. Basic FGF in Elvax elicited inflammation-associated +3 to +4 responses at all doses tested. New blood vessels did not form in response to HSA in Hydron or Elvax, while TGF-beta induced +4 angiogenesis accompanied by vigorous inflammation. In vivo release kinetics for bFGF in Hydron and Elvax were compared, and the release of bioactive bFGF from Hydron and Elvax was demonstrated in vitro. These results suggest that the bFGF and Elvax combination incites an inflammatory response which stimulates indirect angiogenesis, while the same concentrations of bFGF delivered in Hydron produced no inflammation or angiogenesis. Although bFGF alone is a potent mitogen for endothelial cells, it does not appear to directly stimulate in vivo angiogenesis.\r"

Several species of animals have been used as models for human healing, rodents being the most frequently employed. In an attempt to provide better wound tissue sampling from these animals, insertable devices have been developed that allow the ingrowth of healing tissue. Several of these devices are reviewed with reference to their advantages and disadvantages. Connective tissue deposition into wounds can be evaluated by wound strength measurement and hydroxyproline quantitation. Histologic methods are available to evaluate the cellular and matrix details within the wound. Additionally, methods developed in molecular biology are becoming applicable to healing studies and a safe means of investigating collagen metabolism in humans by the use of a stable oxygen isotope is being developed. The study of fetal wound healing provides an excellent example of the utility of many of these methods in achieving an understanding of the biology of this remarkable scarless process.\r"

The available epidemiologic, physiologic, and metabolic data are consistent with the position that a persistent degree of microcirculatory hypoxia, although it may be present in amounts that are below the sensitivity of current detection systems, becomes an increasingly less important etiologic factor as the organ failure disease progresses. Rather, aerobic metabolism appears to be the dominant mechanism of meeting the increased work loads and energy demands. There is an increasing body of evidence that cytokine release systemically, and increased cell-cell interaction through cytokines and prostanoids locally, may alter not only parenchymal function in the proximity of these mononuclear cells, but organ function at distant sites. If this latter hypothesis continues to be substantiated, it implies that the underlying cell and organ dysfunction may indeed be reversible if appropriate counter-regulatory mechanisms could be developed and the appropriate timing of their application understood.\r"

Gallbladder epithelial ion transport, gallbladder motility in vitro and in vivo, gastrointestinal motility, and flora of the stomach and small bowel were studied 2 and 24 hours after shock. Changes at 2 hours included decreased gallbladder contractility in vitro and decreased emptying in vivo, loss of coordination with intestinal motor activity, decrease in frequency of intestinal electrical slow waves, and reduced duration of the intestinal migrating motor complex cycle. By 24 hours, gallbladder epithelial permeability was increased and in vitro contractility remained reduced but the in vivo functions showed partial recovery. Gastrointestinal flora was not affected by these changes. These data demonstrate that hemorrhagic shock and reperfusion affect digestive motility. The early timing of the alterations observed and the partial recovery 24 hours post shock suggest an ischemia-hypoxia mechanism of injury.\r"

  ".W": "Decreased cytosolic [Ca2+] and impaired Ca2+ release in response to an IP3 challenge are among perturbations in hepatocyte Ca2+ homeostasis associated with endotoxemia and sepsis. These changes are consistent with the accompanying alterations in appropriate physiologic functions, e.g., activation of glycogen phosphorylase and gluconeogenesis, mediated by [Ca2+]c and defective phosphorylation of relevant enzymes. Attenuation of IP3 binding to the subcellular fractions that are imputed to be targets of IP3 and a decrease in the size of the IP3-sensitive pool of releasable Ca2+ are underlying components of the mechanism of the reduced Ca2+ release upon IP3 stimulation and its metabolic sequelae. ET treatment leads to a significant increase in Ca2+ associated with the cell surface compartment of adipocytes, a reduction in 45Ca2+ uptake by endoplasmic reticulum and higher cytosolic [Ca2+] under basal conditions and upon ACTH stimulation than that observed in cells of control rats. The reduced 45Ca2+ uptake is also manifest in adipocytes of septic rats. Alterations in adipocyte metabolism induced by ET include increased oxidation of glucose to CO2 (an insulin-like effect) and increased lipolysis upon NE and ACTH stimulation.\r"

  ".W": "Assessment of nutritional needs following thermal injury remains an important adjunct to providing dietary therapy designed to minimize the detrimental effects of hypermetabolism and subsequent catabolism. Most anthropometric measurements, frequently utilized in nonburned patients, have relatively little usefulness in assessing burned individuals. Energy expenditure can be adequately estimated for most patients by direct calorimetry, indirect calorimetry, or formulae. Direct calorimetry is the most expensive and complicated method, while use of a formula is the most inexpensive and least complicated. All yield good results in the clinical setting. Differences in estimated energy expenditure by the multiple formulae may be statistically significant, but rarely are clinically significant. Therefore selection of a formula should be based on simplicity. Estimations by formula require readjustment at intervals of 1 to 2 weeks. In general, enteral feedings remain superior to parenteral delivery of nutrients. Finally, current animal research suggests significant differences in metabolic and immunologic effects of the diet depending on qualitative make-up of dietary fat sources.\r"

Gastrostomy feedings delivered 175 kcal/kg.day. The mean rates of heat production and heat loss for the three burn groups did not differ significantly whether rats were fed chow ad libitum, or by gastrostomy early or late. Contrary to previous studies using a guinea pig model, method and timing of feeding in this burned rat model had no significant effect on the postburn increment in the rate of heat loss and the corresponding increment in the rate of heat production.\r"

Prevention of such colonization and infection through the use of topical antimicrobial agents appears to decrease the metabolic alterations resulting from burn injury. These findings indicate that appropriate use of topical antibacterial agents may decrease the metabolic demands seen in burned patients. Burn-induced translocation of intestinal bacteria has also been hypothesized to contribute to the postburn hypermetabolic response. Attempts at preventing this entity in a burned guinea pig model through the use of selective decontamination of the digestive tract by the administration of enteral antibiotics have failed to demonstrate any measurable effect.\r"

The lung therefore will receive the first volley of cytotoxins released postinjury. In addition to being a target of injury, the lung may also contribute to the injury of systemic organs. This injury may be the result of a reduced delivery of oxygenated blood or the direct release of cytotoxins into the systemic circulation. The injury to the lung may be to the pulmonary microvasculature or the airway. The bronchial circulation responds to injury by a marked elevation in its blood flow and microvascular permeability. These latter effects may be important in mediating the changes which occur in the lung parenchyma.\r"

  ".W": "Acute pulmonary failure or ARDS in severely injured patients continues to be a significant problem. The most important clinical risk factor identified is sepsis syndrome. Sepsis syndrome is the clinical correlate of a malignant systemic inflammatory process and is directed in large part by the tissue-fixed macrophage (M phi), such as the alveolar M phi. The M phi is capable of producing most of the central inflammatory mediators responsible for the pathophysiology seen during sepsis and organ injury. Two major mediators are procoagulant activity (PCA), leading to diffuse microvascular thrombosis, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF), causing much of the physiologic derangement of sepsis. Endotoxins (LPS) derived from Gram-negative bacterial cell walls are the primary inflammatory stimulus for the tissue-fixed M phi production of inflammatory mediators. It is not completely known how LPS interacts with its various cellular targets, but it is hoped that knowledge of the molecular interactions involved in stimulation of the M phi by endotoxin will lead to therapies to modulate the response and prevent deleterious processes such as ARDS. In the present studies, LPS from E. coli 0111:B4 was shown in a dose response to stimulate large levels of both PCA and TNF in alveolar M phi. LPS from Bacteroides fragilis and Lipid X (the monosaccharide precursor of endotoxin) were unable to cause stimulation of the M phi in vitro. However, both moieties, B. fragilis LPS and Lipid X, were able to effectively and specifically compete with E. coli LPS and block M phi stimulation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The development of animal models of inhalation injury has made possible the identification of both the airway and vascular responses evoked by smoke inhalation. Inflammatory occlusion of terminal bronchioles and necrosis of the endobronchial mucosa render the airway and pulmonary parenchyma susceptible to infection and the resulting pneumonitis further increases mortality. Early diagnosis, best achieved by endoscopic bronchoscopy and 133xeon ventilation perfusion scan, permits timely application of high-frequency ventilation that appears to reduce the incidence of pneumonia and to decrease mortality. Pharmacologic agents give promise of ameliorating the deleterious changes of the vasculature. The recent advances in understanding inhalation injury have identified the research needed to further improve patient salvage.\r"

  ".W": "Acute thermal injury of skin equivalent to second-degree injury and involving approximately 25% of total body surface results in a series of pathophysiologic events which lead to both local and distant tissue/organ injury. The distant effects involve intravascular hemolysis and acute lung injury, both of which can be attributed to complement activation and intravascular stimulation of neutrophils, resulting in oxygen radical production, which results in injury of red cells and pulmonary vascular endothelial cells. At the local site of thermal injury, the progressive increase in vascular permeability is linked to complement activation and histamine release, the outcome of which is interaction of histamine with xanthine oxidase, resulting in enhanced catalytic activity of the enzyme. Toxic oxygen products of xanthine oxidase, including H2O2 and its conversion product, the hydroxyl radical, appear to be linked to the damage of dermal vascular endothelial cells, resulting in progressive vascular permeability. The increased vascular permeability can be greatly attenuated by the use of inhibitors of xanthine oxidase, the inhibitor of histamine release (cromolyn), catalase, an iron chelator (deferoxamine), or scavengers of the hydroxyl radical. Interestingly, neutrophils appear to play little if any role in dermal vascular injury in this animal model of thermal trauma. Those studies suggest that pathophysiologic events following local thermal trauma are complex and involve a variety of mediator pathways.\r"

These studies provide a picture of intravascular complement activation, neutrophil-C5a interactions, and consequent disordered cellular function. Neutrophil dysfunction includes suppressed random and C5a-directed migration and hyperresponsiveness to oxidative stimuli. These observations do not explain the histologic and functional involvement of neutrophils in ARDS and perhaps other organ failure states. Circumstantial and extrapolated information suggests that macrophage-lineage cells function as regulators of neutrophil function within matrix environments in burn injury. Elevated endotoxin levels have been found in burned patients, which would support the notion of endotoxin-stimulated monocytes/macrophages as inducing neutrophil migration into connective tissue matrices (LTB4 and IL-8), inducing prolonged oxidant production (TNF-alpha, GM-CSF), and inducing neutrophil release of regulatory substances from neutrophils (G-CSF). This information suggests a variety of experimental approaches to testing this hypothesis.\r"

The trauma patients' FcRI+ MO subpopulation produced the majority of their elevated IL-6, TNF alpha, TGF beta, and PGE2. IgG stimulation of patients' MO through FcRI not only stimulated TNF alpha, IL-6, and PGE2 levels, but also greatly augmented the levels of these monokines produced after subsequent bacterial challenge. Post-trauma increased IL-6 levels can lead to polyclonal B-cell activation and high levels of circulating, nonspecific IgG as seen in trauma patients. This nonspecific IgG triggers the FcRI on the increased numbers of FcRI+ MO leading to ever-increasing monokine levels. IL-4 was found to downregulate patients' FcRI+ MO production of mediators. The cycle of altered cytokine levels, increased FcRI+ MO numbers, elevated IgG, and augmented triggering of FcRI+ MO may be broken by addition of IL-4.\r"
